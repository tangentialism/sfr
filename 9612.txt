Subject: thanksgiving thanks (saturn5)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


I wanted to thank everyone who came out to Thanksgiving this past
Thursday night. It really sucks that we were busted, but being the
only party in town meant we were the only thing for the cops to
harrass. Oh well! :) We eventually moved to Berkeley, and despite
the fact that the visuals didn't come with us, we still had a rockin'
time!!! :) We had great music, wonderful people, and lots of Chai!

This was the first party by saturn5, and it's certainly not the last!
Furture saturn5 parties will continue to have more of an emphasis on
multimedia and visual art, looking at raving as eye candy for a
cyber-culture. Also, we're looking into having permitted parties in
San Francisco, so we can avoid all of this police nonsense. :) We'll
be working with a local space owner to bring their warehouse up to
safety and legal standards for permitting. 

There are other exciting plans (shhh!) for the next party(s), so keep
your ears and eyes open for future saturn5 events! I also wanted thank
the following people for all of their hard work, and for putting up
with the aggravation of getting busted:

- Randy Cone from Dionysus Dreams for the excellent visuals and lighting
- Greg Sandler from Harmony for his techno-riffic intellibeams
- Crystal from Dimension 7 for her impromptu video mixing
- Gateway Systems for top notch sound (as always!)
- Dave from Insite Lighting for last minute blacklights
- Nub Chai Circus for coming up to serve the elixir of life
- Jon Logan, John Carel, Mystr-E, Anna (Anon), and Warren Parker for
  spinning some bad-ass sets! :)

and thanks to the rest of the crew who helped out (couldn't have
done it without ya!). AND especially to David Lowe and Sarah
for putting up with me! :) You guys *rock*.

I hope everyone enjoyed the dinner as much as I did. :) Even though
Raw could not cater due to scheduling conlicts, the all-vegan buffet
dinner really kicked ass! Hopefully, we'll continue to serve more
yummy organic food in the future. :)

Again, thanks for coming out and supporting saturn5, and we'll see you
at the next event!

Steve

Hey everybody and O ma gawd! WoooooooWoooooo! Detroit is in the mutha-phuckin' House!

So r u wondering if matter is going to say this was the best par-tay, yet [agin]? Mai 
oui, mon amis. "The best phuckin' par-tay, yet!" Here's the synapsis... uh, synopsis ;)

Connected at Pizza Papalis in Greektown [around 10:40p Detroit time]. BTW, this used to 
be a really great place for 'za and good service. Sadly, is no longer the case. I 
wouldn't recommend it agin, unless new mgmt or sumthin' changes. Meeting for dinner (I 
do the best I can here, pleez slap me): MikeyD, Gage, Tom, Ed, Kevin and Amy (dam, I 
gotta learn some of those name-tricks, cuz I know I'm forgetting several ppl). Great 2 
meet u new friends/see you all agin! Musta been around 12:00a, by the time we cut 
out...

Arrived at the space shortly from greektown. We parked and mosied our way to the 
entrance. While waiting in line, I noticed a strange (yet familiar) hissing sound. 
Hmmm, someone must have a leak in a tire or something ;). Now, the weather was fair 
(slight rain misting) and not too cold, but the line was moving way slow and it must 
have taken us 1.5 hours to get to the door. Upon entering we we're told that this 
par-tay which had been "hyped" as being a $5 event was now going to cost $10. Hmmmm, 
with all due respect to Poorboy in Detroit -> you can't do that! Plain and simple: that 
is just wrong. To change the advertised price of the par-tay at the door is not kewl. 
Especially with all of the emphasis which was placed on it being a $5 ("not a typo") 
event. Whatever... When they asked me for $10, I jus' told 'em all I had was $5 and I 
came from Chicago and "u can't do that". They were kewl about it and after a 
trouble-free search, I was in! ;) IMHO -> some ppl have gripes about security and such, 
I think it's all good, don't want to take the chance on some moron bringin' a gun or 
something into the place...

Da Shit itself: I know I always say this was the best one yet! ;) Honestly, It's nice 
that I made it to Blessings last Wednesday in Chicago, 'cause otherwise Detroit woulda 
put Chicago to shame (Blessing was the first really vibey Chicago par-tay I have 
experienced in years). I'm just talking vibe...not music, here. Detroit has the shit 
going on! :D Very simple lighting, nothing fancy: a few strobes, some green floods. 
Nice sound. The booty room coulda been a bit bigger, but oh well...

The people were so damn nice and friendly! :D Lots of hugs and love flowing all around! 
;) I don't know what 2 say, what else is there. I had a great time at this one and send 
out big love to all of the ppl who were involved w/ this one! :D I wish I could do a 
better job revu-ing the DJs, however, I will simply say they were all dam good and 
innovative. There was one guy, (I think) Derrick who provided some great techno (ahh).  
The thing went until 7:00a or so. Nice. ;)

Besides the ppl already mentioned from the pre-par-tay net.meet, I also gotta say it 
was kewl meeting Micheal, Dianna, "Troyee" and everyone else I am forgetting (duh). 

Here's a little something this par-tay inspired in me:

As we move closer, we grow.
So much is said without words,
Perhaps we have met before.
In another time, another place.
We can remember all that we have forgotten.
Regenerating the good that exists within all,
Bound by reality and dimension.
Our understanding of our world becomes clearer,
As we open up to ways of thought
Not so unlike our own.

PLUR -> Rage,
  matter

Hi everyone! :) I just thought I should share my experience with you guys..

The place had a lot of people and a lot of NEGATIVE attitudes. It was scary...
yet...I was on two hits of E and some shrooms so I was having a blast! ;) which
reminds me... People, NEVER smoke cigarretes when you are shrooming as hard
I was..
I had a bad trip :( and I guess I couldn't get out of it cause the energy was
not Positive at all... :(

I did have fun and I did not think I wasted $25 :) in fact, I take pride of
everysingle
penny I spent! :P 

Anyhow... who else was there anyway?
luv to allz
Pab

PS: G'nite ;) just got home, I'm not waking up 'till monday morning ;)

 Does anyone here have any experience with the Roland TR-626 drum
machine? I was in a music store that had used musical instruments,
and they have one for $99 ( no manual or cables, I assume ). I want
to know whether the sounds compare to TR-808 / TR-909 persussion
sounds.

 Too bad we don't have the names of the folks in "CR Power" - it's easy
to change organizational names and keep the same bunch of scamsters...

Your right Pablo.

  The place was swarming with negativity.
  After four hours of that ravE. I couldn't even crack a smile no more.
  
To much industrial house.

 I had a blast though. Things could of been worse, I guess. I mean, I could
of actually gave a shit what negative people thought about me, or
something. Besides. I rather enjoy the feeling of being back in high school
on occasion.

it was a good party to go to.  I had a lot of fun walking arround smiling
all night long, playing with my glowsticks, tripping the clubbies out with
the way I dance. :-)  I didn't like the negative vibes coming from the
enviornment as a whole, you know what I mean?  Well anyway, we were the
first people in the line, my friends and I until they moved the guys to one
side and the girls to another to get searched.  Which was funny because I
was able to sneak 3 bottles of water into the party.  The front room was
really cool with all the visuals going on the back wall.  I really didn't
like the way people would tag the back wall, there is no purpose for doing
that, execpt make a space now longer available.  I met a lot of new friends
last night, but that seems always to be the case at any party I go to. 
After the whole Ubiquitous event last night was just unbelivable, which is
scarry because it was lacking the rave vibe ;-(  Anyway, I think I will
just stick to the underground parties from now on, you know what I mean? 
Well I am going to go back to bed now.
Rave on brothers and sisters,
Eric

Hello people!

Saturn5's thanksgiving party was a success, despite all setbacks and
difficulties (our boys in blue again!)  I had a wonderful time, myself -
and everyone I spoke to had an equally wonderful time.  It's safe to say
this was my best thanksgiving ever. 

Working, early on, with Randy, Greg, Steve and company, was a blast.  Once
again, I got to feel like I was a part of creating the atmosphere of the
party - transforming a big square room into a beautiful dance floor.  The
crew was pretty small, so there was a lot of work to do, but everyone was
really together and focused, so by the time I left for the map point the
space was already looking great.

The only real bummer of the night for me is that because I was at the
map point until the bust, I never got to see the party in full swing at
150 folsom.  I've been told the visuals were really phenomenal, and I
really wish I'd had the chance to see them.  By the time I got to the
warehouse, most of the equipment had already been torn down.

Over in Berkeley, when the party got re-started, it was great.  Minimal
lighting, Nub Chai, a cozy fire, fantastic music (Mystr-E with a
familiarly great set, Anna with her beautiful goa, and Warren Parker, the
surprise of the morning, keeping the floor moving until 7:30 with a great
set) and great company.  It was really cool, really cozy and intimate...
my favourite kind of party.

Cleanup, pancakes, then sleep.  I'm happy to have been a part of a
wonderful thanksgiving that brought smiles to so many peoples' faces -
especially my own.  Thanks Steve!

See you all next time...

At last, I caught the AMP on MTV last night.  Many of the groups
deserve commendation for creating the computer graphics on some dazzling
videos. Despite what criticism people may say about commercialization of
the 'scene', if it inspires more people to create and share beauty with
the world, I'm all for it.  Saying that MTV kids don't have good taste in
music is like comparing beer at frat parties to E at raves.  There's
always more crap when we get something in plentitude(sp?) for cheap.  
It would be awesome if MTV played good stuff all the time, but the
mainstream will always be a potluck of everything good and bad.  Our
energies can be better directed at improving the music in our scene. I'd
like to see some open evaluations of groups and DJ's mixing styles.  So
far my vocabulary consists of phat, smooth (transition), dope, and
cerebral.  Some edumacation would be good.

I was wondering, if there are any non-techno bands or groups you like 
which you think share similar qualities to electronic music. I am a big 
fan of repetitive beats and find myself drawn to 'drone' bands who use 
repetition as a focal point in their music. Some of my favorites are: 
Spacemen 3, Spiritualized, Spectrum, Stereolab, The Velevet Underground,  
My Bloody Valentine and Tortoise. 

What kinds of music do you think complement your love for electronica??

I'd have to say the Swans also fit the bill. Their intense droning
textured style often remind me of layered ambient synthesis.

I'd say Slowdive fall into this category, The Verve had some good ones
along this line, as well.  And don't forget Stone Roses' "Fool's Gold".

there's a Herbie Hancock album called "Head Hunters" which was released in
the 1970s... it was some of the earliest "fusion" or "acid" jazz... there's
a track on there called "vein melter" which i would love to hear in an
ambient room... it's one of the best pieces of stoner/trip music i have
ever heard.

love,

brian

 Thank you SAmi!! I was trying to think of some groups and I couldn't
until now. I haven't listened to Slowdive since high school ('93) but a
friend introduced them to me and I really enjoyed their music. Have they
come out with any new music lately?

  U2, U2, and more U2 ;)  One of my secret fantasies is to hijack the
turntables at the conclusion of a great rave, and end the party with their
song 'Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World'  (since it's a song
written about coming home after a rave, when you're too blissed out to do
anything but smile)
  Ahhh, how I wish turntable-seizing was socially acceptable! :)
   
best,

Hmm, I'm a big fan of industrial actually, einsturzende neubauten and 
the like.  
very noisy, but they do share the repetition and slow growth of 
rythmic patterns 
that I like in techno.

oh i don't know ... since all the other groups i like use electronics to 
a large extent :)  but non-techno-yet-hypnosis-inducing for me includes 
some Spiritualized, Pink Floyd (of course!), Enya, Alan Parsons Project 
(yes!  and i'm not even blushing!), Cocteau Twins, Vivaldi, Mozart, and 
lots of early medieval madrigals and chamber music.  i'm a HUGE fan of 
thick, rich, juicy strings :)

	This was a pretty shittey post.  I'm sorry to see that you think
	E is the only way to have fun.  At least now I know where people
	like Leeza (and her crew) get the idea that raving is only about
	DRUGS!!!!!!!!!

	I  went sober with all my friends and we had lots of fun.  I'm
	sorry to see that you feel the need to be so dependent on E
	to have a good time   :(

	I went with my friends and we had lots of fun.  Yes it was hot and there
	were lots of people, but that's part of raving.

	Did anyone else hear the phat mix of Basco into that hard Skint beat.
	It kicked ass!!!!!

	I'm sorry to say though, DJ DAN's set was sorta disapointing.  It was
	kinda hard and angry....theories why:
	1) his boyfriend broke with him
	2) his boyfriend cheated on him
	3) he had a bad day
	4) he thought it was too hot and stuffy in that tiny room
	5) he's been out of the US too long
	6) he's practicing for Germany Dec. 14th

	At least there was that phat set in the room next door
	right before Dan went on.  Anyone know who that was?

hello all-

[disclaimer: if you don't like lovey-dovey posts, go away now!  otherwise,
you have no right to bitch at me for my nrr posts!
just wanted to say hello from wherever i happen to be right now (it changes
far too quick for even me to keep track of!)

i had a wonderful thanksgiving break (though i did miss my girl while she
traveled) and i wanted to spread some of that wonderful feeling i have to
you!!!!!!!!

so here goes!

LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE!!!


ok, now that i've got that out of my system, i can return to my normal
quantum flux!

i love you all-

matt


p.s. - kudos to steve s for putting together a killer party: here's my
description of the inagural saturn5: "if you took the essense of raving (the
people, the music, the dancing) stuffed it, yourself, and 50 of your closest
friends, into a little box, while some giant outside picked up the box and
shook it wildly above his head for a few hours, you'd have saturn5!"

good job steve!

love, once again-

matt

                 HOW TO SPOT A RAVER......................

           Ravers can perfectly understand and have amazing conversations
  with anyone under the age of ten.
           Ravers know where all the best toy stores are.
           Ravers get the most mileage out of their shoes. The toes and heels
  always curl up because they're so worn down.
           Ravers always wish the dj would spin that OC Transpo track that
  they keep hearing on the bus ride home.
           Ravers are the only people who don't have their age calculated in
  months, yet still wear and use pacifiers.
           Ravers always consider every new place they go to as a possible
  location for a party.
           Ravers hug EVERYONE.
           Ravers can DANCE.
           Ravers can be found dancing everywhere EXCEPT the main dance
floor.
           Ravers understand the art of the bathroom conversation.
           Ravers choose their clothes by texture, colour, and size.
           Ravers love homemade clothes because they've seen the price tag on
  a pair of Lithiums.
           Ravers get the most enjoyment out of gino/guit  stories.
           Ravers always order water when they go out to clubs.
           Ravers realize that "Evian" spells "naivE" backwards.
           Ravers notice that the doors near the Mackenzie King Bridge have
  an "e" on the handle.
           Ravers always know the most likely spot to find other ravers
  within a one-hundred foot radius.
           Ravers don't bother planning to meet their friends ahead of time,
  their friends are always already there.
           Ravers don't say "Nice shoes, wanna fu@k?"
           Ravers give the best hugs and massages.
           Ravers have a one track mind. It goes "thump thump      tweet
thump tweet thump".
           Ravers constantly point out the trippy visuals in everyday life.
           Ravers helped Adidas through the "lean" years.
           Ravers never know the name of their favorite tracks.
           Ravers know how to SMILE.
           Ravers always choose "e" on multiple choice questions.
           Ravers are good at playing "guess what he's on".
           Ravers will say "hi" to those people they don't know, yet always
  see on the bus.
           Ravers can't watch Electric Circus without it being muted.
           Ravers define the style of music they listen to as "good".
            Ravers know what to do with a dead glowstick !

I saw a Slowdive 12" in Mod Lang, Berkeley today, as a matter of fact.  I
can't remember the name nor how old it was, but there are still releases
floating around at least.

Dear SFRavefriends,

	I happened to still have this message that was sent out before the
event (I saved it because I thought I'd go -- glad I didn't.)  It lists
several promoter groups as being involved (with a nod to Jake's claim that
Ghostribe actually was not), and the sender is Ivan Vasquez, with copies
going to the other . Can you shed some light for us Ivan? 

Much love,

has anyone heard the aphex remix of curve?

how about the oval remixes of Tortoise?

if you're into music of this vein check out the latest release from
Nonplace Urban Field ("Goldenstar" on Incoming!) which has the highest
production quality i've heard in months... squarepusher meets hawtin
meets pork recordings... it's fucking mad! i tell you...

>The place had a lot of people and a lot of NEGATIVE attitudes. It was
scary...

Way too many people mostly standing around...I fault part of that to the
sets being played...nothing uplifting, straight "trancy" material but flavored
for the most part near the industrial realms of oppresive vibes...but
mostly to
the environment and people there....not to mention that damn yellow light
on the Butterfly murial that was blasting into everyone's eyes and
generally preventing that cozy feeling from forming.

>From: "Eric Vandenbroek" <eric1488@pacbell.net>
>I didn't like the negative vibes coming from the

A lot of non-friendly vibes and gangsta' types seem drawn to the various 
massive parties I've been to at the HomeBase site...

Sorry to come across so negative, but after the fiasco with UBIQUITOUS the
night before, I was really in the mood for an uplifting party.  A friend went
with us last night...anxious to participate in the event (his first)...and
after
his experience at BE HERE NOW, I'm sad to say he'll probably never join again.

As I pull on my flame-retardent rave-wear, I'd also like to say that way too
many "kids" have been entering the scene...I'm not saying that I don't
appreciate the things that the majority of this part of the crowd can bring
to a good party,
but when I start routinely running into a bunch of 12 year olds with their
parents
and the topic of conversation when meeting new people is the arithmetic
assignment due the next day in Junior High School, I question If I've made
it to the right party.

How about advertising events with a general idea of the age of the attendants.
Like:  All ages, 18 and older, or 21+....seems most of the parties I've
been to
lately indicate nothing and end up "glorified" after-school dance parties.
And maybe allow those of us that are of legal age to enjoy an alcholic
drink from time-to-time the opportunity to do so, and ban the practice of
no re-entry.

Just my thoughts....

Before I got into techno I was listening to a lot of old groove tunes by
artists like Booker T. and the MGs and the Bar-Kays... those old grooves
have teh same kind of steady rhythm, but have the funked out organ leads
and stuff...  I would highly reccommend checking this stuff out if you
haven't before 
:)

You know, I have been thinking about the roll of the DJ a lot lately.  As
I watch a lot of people jumping into the world of DJing, i see a lot of
people with different views of what the DJ is.  Now, the way I see it,
the sj is really there to help the vibe along.  The vibe is not created by
the DJ, or by the DJs music.  It is created by the people grooving.  The
DJ has to help it keep going.  The DJ is _not_ just a beatmatching tool.
Shit, we have machines that do that.  The DJ is not even required by
definition to spin 'techno' or whatnot.  The discussion of non-electronic
music made me think of that even more.  I remember on one mixtape that I
did, I put a non-beatmatched  song called "Do You Know What I Mean" by one
of the greatest keyboardists ever, Lee Michaels.  My friends called up and
said, What's with that rock song at the end?  But soon, folks were saying
that they had really started digging that tune.  It worked with the vibe.  
Just random thoughts...

I was wondering if anybody knows any online house music record ordering 
services where you can actually hear the music online.  I like DJTRAXX 
except I don't want to pay $12 for a $5 record.

hello all,

not being a participater in the E taking I was wondering how other non-drug 
people manage to stay up so long.  I usually find myself winding down around 
4:00 and after that cannot usually be revived unless there is some really 
kick-ass music going.  Being tired beyond the point of exhaustion usually ruins 
my night so I leave when I start to feel it set in.  I would like to be able to 
stay up longer but the after effects (and during effects) of stuff to keep you 
up longer does not interest me at all.  So...how do you do it? 

wish me luck for my admissions interview at FIDM tommorow, please,

later everyone,

Megan      Czefir

Regarding how to keep going sober...

	When I go sober I drink lots of water and juice.  I also never sit
down for too long, that way I can get up again.
	Also, we all know that E dialates the pupils.  Does anyone know
why, or what this may be doing to one's eyesight when the eye is so over
exposed to light.  What about other ramifications of E besides just a
hangover.  Anyone?

my friends joke that i'm always eating at raves...which is pretty much
true. i constantly snack on dried fruit/cereal/granola/whatever to keep
my energy up (and quiet my growing stomach). bananas have lotsa
potassium...good for lots of dancing. another (pretty obvious) solution
is to take a "disco nap" just before you go out. you know, get out of
work/school in the early afternoon, crash for a few hours (a little goes
a long way), then get up and party your brains out. problem is, just
before a party that you know is gonna be great, that pre-party
anticipation usually keeps you from sleeping. saturday parties are
usually easier to plan for...just stay up REALLY late friday night (i
don't work weekends, so this isn't a prob for me), then sleep in
saturday. be sure to rest enough on sunday night!
oh, and drink lots of water, even if you don't drop E. helps keep the
colds away.

crazee mad flava props to ya for raving sober!
(no, i don't REALLY talk like that!)

About Scott's idea to maybe have an age limit:  I personally hate
discriminating altogether, but it might be an ok idea, within certain
parameters.  Like Scott suggested, parties could be advertized as 18+.  I
don't think we'd have to check IDs at the door or anything, but that in
itself may weed out some of the pre-pubescents some of us are more
concerned about by virtue of the fact that they wouldn't even try to go
since they wouldn't think they'd "be able to get in".  The seventeen
year-olds and such might be more confident, but they're closer to the
more comfortable age spectrum anyway.  I mean, I hate to babysit, but at
the same time, I think we need to remember that there are certain
liabilities in everything we do.  So in at least one sense, it's not that
the young'uns are being attacked by the "older elite", but that we are
just trying to protect ourselves from <underline>our</underline> "older
elite".  Dunno, don't care.  Haven't been to  a party in over two months.
 Things just get kinda hazy when I don't dance.  Just thought I'd throw
that out at Scott on the off-chance it help a bit.  TTFN.  PLUR! : )

P.S. I'll hopefully be hitting Karma this saturday.  Gonna Dance... gotta
dance!  Hope to see a lot of smiles there! :D

TranceMission and The Rocking Horse People (Both bands share the same 
players + or - 1 or 2) are a local band with some albums out on City of 
Tribes Records, very ethnic with a modern twist. Very hypnotic.

	For your information, in that post it was stated that the only
	way anyone was going to have phun was if they took some drugs.
	I'm sorry to see your so dependent on drugs to depict your
	feelings for a certain space in the time of your now
	getting shorter (compliments of these wonderful drugs) life.

	And about the "Adidas wearing ganstas"   GET OFF IT
	I wore all Adidas down to my sports bra and socks and am I a gangsta?
	1) I didn't harrass anyone
	2) sold no drugs
	3) didn't steal anything from anyone
	4) had lots of phun dancing with my SOBER friends
	5) gave lots of hugs
	6) and SM:)ED a lot

Well obviously there is an art to sober raving, and to keep up with all 
those who are 'not' sober can sometimes be a challenge ;)

But there are tons of ways to stay alive throughout the night.  
*	Firstly and most importantly is **BAD-ASS** music (without i almost 
	always die)

*	Then Id say people and their vibes are number two...

---> but from here the rest is up to yooooou!  & theres lots of options

*	ok, theres 'Vivarin' & NoDoze, they're great for some mild tweaking,
	haha, just kidding, but they DO keep you 'UP'.  Then again they
	are very hard on your stomache, so never take too much.  It isnt
	something you should take for a long time...  theres other the ways!

*	now theres 'herbal power' stuff.  i have recently begun experiment
	ing with this and it's great!  a medium sized bottle of red ginseng
	right before a party TOTALLY energized me!  im looking further 
	into other herbal 'upers'.  SOMETHING NOT TO TRY: MaHuang
	Its as addictive as speed, and quite harmful.  DONT GO THERE :!

*	and then there are many *smart* things to do.
	- resting before partying
	- eating high protein food, some good carbos too!
	- like someone said before, lots of water & juice (ESSENTIAL)
	- take something to munch on. i remember once when i took a couple
	  of pb&j sandwiches, and i ate them when i tought i was pooped.
	  those little badboys perked me up like mad!  Try it!

*	and finally there are "energy boosters" that are available. i dont
	know much about the products that are out there, like at GNC, but
	i sell nutritional products that are sponsored by the US Olympic 
	Licensee comitee, and about 20 olympic atheletes, not to mention 
	ive tried their energy booster, its great!  cheaper than a hit 
	of E, better for you than "psuedo-amphedamines", and works well.

	e-mail me if you want more info on this, they have many other 
	awsome supplements as well. (its worth looking into if youre
		---sick'n'tired of being SICK & TIRED---- haha

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I've been reading all the postings on UBIQUITOUS and you know the good old
saying "if it's too good to be true, than it probably is" here is one
example where those one of those unwritten laws of life apply.

If you were a promoter, would you dish out $15,000 to throw a party for the
people? or would it be a scam to: 1/GET $$$ NOW or 2/GET $$$ LATER  , I
think it was both. You have to remember that money runs this world, and
even if you want to keep the "vibe" alive you will not give a crap about it
if you saw 2000 people in line with $20 bills in their hands. True there
are a lot of people in the scene who WILL keep the "vibe" going ,but
they're going to have to try very hard not to sell out, especially in the
next couple of years when MTV will be doing a live video shoot at Funky
Techno Tribe featuring DJ Dan/Bassbin twins.
It will happen eventually, If something is appealing to the young
generation,big companies will market,advertise,shrink-wrap and offer
mail-in rebates on it.

If you have been going to raves for a while, treasure the moments and  the
people you've met because you will be telling your kids about it, just like
our parents can tell us about the 60's. Any way or other, I think raves
have made our future generation better, more open-minded, understanding and
positive.

tell me what you think...I though about this

Hi all,

I want to thank everybody who voted for their favorite day.  Here are the
totals:

Thursday: 21
Sunday:   13

no preference:  2

voting twice: 1 (Shame on you, Adam!  ;>)

Thursday it is.  We are now working on confirming a date, and details like
age policy (we want to have it open to everybody, but the final decision
will not be ours to make).  It will be at Cesar's Latin Palace, so there
should be room for everybody (and then some!).

Expect a great vibe, with free vegitarian food.

More updates as they happen.

Peace and love and a full belly,
Kerry

So I guess that everyone who wears Adidas is a gangsta. 
And does alot of drugs.
And disses people who don't seem to be cool enough.
Or something. 
So does that mean that I'm a gangsta when I decide to wear an Adidas 
jacket or shirt? And all my H20 polo player and swimmer friends who wear 
the Adidas sandals or have Adidas shit, they're all druggie gangstas 
too?

Clothes don't make the person, the *person* does. At the risk of quoting 
an increasingly pathetic advertisement, as the Sprite commercial goes, 
"Image is nothing, thirst is everything, obey your thirst." What people 
look like or dress like is NOTHING. 
I've been in a "shitty space filled with a bunch of "A***** wearin 
gangstas" (and OTHER rude types) and it isn't drugs that can save your 
mood, it's your attitude. I mean you can be on DRUGS in a bad scene and 
have an even WORSE time. It's all in how you approach the whole night. 
If you go into a huge place with bad vibes you can say (soberly *or* 
high) "this sucks, I'm gonna have a shitty time, this fucking sucks! I'm 
gonna pop a few pills/tabs" and bitch and moan about it all night and 
have a bad time, or you can say "yea, the vibe's pretty nasty here, but 
i think i can pretty much ignore it and appreciate the music and 
whatever positive people there are around me" and have a not-so-bad if 
not great time. I heard alot of people saying "yea the vibe was shitty 
at _be here now_ but i had a GREAT time." It's all in the attitude, it's 
not in the drug. Raving *can* be appreciated sober. Hell some of the 
most dedicated ravers I know are straightedge! 


So if the vibe isn't all that great, try to focus on the music. And if 
you're hungry for an rEfrEshmEnt, go for it. But if you're taking it to 
avoid the bad vibes, you might end up having a worse time than you would 
have if you were sober. I kinda know from experience (can we say ground 
zero?). It's a personal choice. Stop slammin Adidas, i, and many others 
have been wearing it since they were kiddies, or since they started a 
sport, or just because they think it's a pretty dope label. I mean come 
on, it's a timeless classic. I love it..
But then, that's just me...

Smiles..

Wow. This is really lame. 

I'm tired of messages like this. So what if someone likes raves AND Phish at the same time (yes, they do 
have a lot in common, If one cannot see that then so be it, but thats your opinion, and it's not an opinion 
that calls for the e-mail equivalent of yelling and screaming).  So what if its "NRR"? It's not like this 
is a business mailing list or something A lot of "ravers" are also Phish fans, and the vibe is the same in 
a lot of cases.
 I deal with enough complaints on the job.  And I get paid to deal with those.  It's really depressing when 
on my own time I have to see crap like this.  This is a fucking mailing list about parties. So why are so 
many people on this list so pissed off at each other? I can understand the anger when it's used towards 
something like corrupt cops at a party, or other issues that affect us in that way, but when it's used 
towards someone who is just looking for fellow Phish fans who also happen to like to go to raves, or when 
someone is horribly inconvenienced for 4 seconds because there is that god-awful heathen of a NRR message 
in which someone forgot to state that in the subject field, it just seems really backwards.  
Anyway, enough of my complaining, i've unsubscribed.

Hello hello, and happy Monday everybody.....

Well here's my recap on the weekend (mind you, the weekend includes
Thursday as well...)

__Thanksgiving__   Not to overkill the positivity of Saturn 5's event I
want to express the highlights. 
Dimension 7: The lights were amazing...  Very intimate crowd and
positivity factor was the highest this weekend.
Berkeley: Getting the fire started.  The effort of a bunch of ravers
anticipating the party ready to go off (again) and putting that energy
to do something constructive.  After getting the fire going in the
fireplace we all broke off into really nice conversation until the
speaker setup got us gruuving.   
All in all Great Job!!! It was all that and cornstarch!

__Ubiquitous__  Maybe more appropriately called "whothrewthis?".  
When there is a police presence @ the map point you know it's gonna be a
bust.  I do give small props to the novelty of the location.  (I cracked
a smile thinking that when the "suits" arrive on Monday they'll have no
ider that a party was thrown there... )
The music was very east coastish from my perspective.   Lotsa breakbeat
(w/ the exception of that Eurithmetcs tune).  But this seems to be the
style that will keep techno alive, for better or worse.  Had a great
time getting to that techno level and busting a move or two.
The move busting broke @ 2AM. when the party ended.. err, uhh.  I felt
for allthose that came down from "Sacatomatos" to get the boot and
wonder what else to do...  
Highest and Lowest points: Getting caught in a breakers circle(+) and
pulling, tearing, or causing some horrible damage to my left knee(-) in
that circle... (ouch)

__Hi Fi__  Saturday night. My brother was spinning some old skool
hip-hop and despite having my knee in an Ace bandage and using a cane, I
did manage to hit the dance floor for 1-2 hrs.  The club was bumping and
it's nice to view different mixing with different a style of music.
Can't get over that alcohol consumption rate.  Man, people really need
excuses to get "loose" in this world sometimes.  Drunk people sure do
get bold!!!  But, listening to some old school hip hop was pretty dope
(remember EPMD, and the "Humpdy Dance" everyone???).

Sunday was spent mixing at home (for 3+hrs.) and resting my leg / knee
for the upcoming weekend.  

Perfecting that "Gansta lean"

Ok, I figured I was going to the Capital of Rave city...(whatever that is) I
thought i was going to check out some sick party in the Warehouse
district(wherever that is), i thought this is going to be a trip of a
lifetime!!!!=) I went completley clueless, i didn't know anything about
anything, so I figured I would just figure shit out as I went along. 

       The second day i was there, I found a piece of paper that said
Ministry of Sound...Bingo! Except the date was 9/12/96 a little to late....
:( Oh well. But there was a list of record stores where to buy pre-sale
tickets so i figured wherever there are record stores there are flyers.. I
also looked through the phonebook and every label you could imagine had n
office there, there where about 300 + record stores listed so I just went to
this place called Soho and went travelling around, I assumed that it would be
cheaper to but domestics here, because they are imports here.. But the
exchange rate was 2 bucks to 1 buck (around) in there favour, so i really
didn't do to well! ;( I did score a TON of flyers though. When I asked where
the break-beat was they guy said try stickn' your ear downstairs and listn'.

       I went downstairs at reckless records and hear some SICK jungle...
There was a huge crowd down there and this guy was in the middle of a mix...
absoulutley amazing!!! I have a lot of respect for jungle Dj's cause that
shit is hard to mix! Well there idea of breakbeat was jungle so I was on my
own. I went to some used record stores and scored some ORB on vinyl and
Vapourspace, and some classics. You can't listen to the records so i ended up
with some shit too! :(  I didn't get to check out the rave scene because I
was with my mum and pap and my brother and sister....:( but I got a glimse of
what it was like at the record stores. I have a lot of extra flyers and I can
spare some if people want some... just e-mail me and we can work something
out. Overall I froze my little arse off and had to sight see all day, but I
had a great time!

Jonathan

P.S. wasn't that really boring!!!!!!=)

Gee what would you think if someone said that about raves?!

I think you're quite confused....your giving Phish a
       bad name comparing it to a rave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Remember not everyone on this list cares about things others talk about, 
I for one don't care to get a run down on DJ Dan's personal life and how 
it relates to why his set wasn't up to par...but I don't go a flaming thar!

peace and love 
drenalin

I for one like Phish a lot, they have great talent, only wish I had known 
they were playing live...somebody let me know next time.

hello all-

very rarely do i publicly blast someone, but this message made me sick:
>

madame mercury, this message was entirely innapropriate.

you have no right to tell someone else that their definition of raving is
wrong.  we each have our own definitions, and if you don't agree, either
a)accept that other people have their own definitions and co-exist happily,
b)keep going and successfully make it into everone's kill file (you're in
many, already!), or c)go away.

i am making this message public, not as a public blast of madame mercury (i
could more easily do that privately where my language would not be so
checked) but as a message to all: (and this is matt preaching)

YOUR DEFINITION OF RAVING IS PROBABLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY ELSES!  WE
CAN EITHER BLAST EACH OTHER FOR THEIR DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS, OR WE CAN
ACCEPT THEIR DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS AND CO-EXIST PEACEFULLY!

thank you.  madame mercury, i appologize for the public confrontation, but i
was so struck by your message that i had to respond.  no offense meant to
your personally, just your message.

love to you all, goddamnit!

love-

matt

....I guess you would have to call this the art of relatively sober 
raving....not quite clean but hey no after effects the next day (although afterglow
 can sometimes be better than the original ;)

One thing that stumped me about the party was that when i got in (about 1 
am) all four rooms had the same music spinning...ok maybe thats a 
bit prejudiced....maybe not exactly the same, there was house
hard ass house, local house and really really hard house (i know 
i seem to lack the proper names)
....but it wasnt until 4AM that i first heard some breaks

i think this saved the night for me.

Regarding how to keep going when sober:

Here is an easy solution, that is well-known by anyone who has spent an 
all-nighter at a casino 
in Vegas or Reno or who has been to "discos" in many European cities:

Pump out a shot of oxygen every 20 minutes. It works!!

I don't know what tanks of oxygen cost, but I don't think they're that 
expensive. It would seem that 
they could be integrated into the fog machines pretty easily. 

Just an idea for promoters. I for one would be willing to pay a little extra to 
gain the natural, 
healty and legal energy-boosting benefits of oxygen. Because  I often have to 
work on weekends,
only at about 1/3 of the raves I go to can I be "assistEd" by things.

guys/gals:

just got back from st. louis, missouri where i feasted on you-know-what.
saw all my family, which was great, and managed to get some serious
farm-style relaxation in (sat around and watched the lake).

but here's a story that may support the "mainstreaming of techno" theory...

my cousin richie is a die-hard electric guitarist, and he and all of his
friends are traditional rock junkies.  last christmas i introduced him and
his friends to "beautiful people" (if you recall, it's the band that dubbed
jimi hendrix last year) and it went over so-so.  i thought it would fly
because of jimi, right?  but they kept switching back to soundgarden.  right.

so this thanksgiving i go back and guess what?  richie says to me, "you
gotta hear this cd, man!  i looked for it on your x-radio site and i
couldn't find it, but we all had a mega party a few weeks back and went
crusing around in our limo with this up full blast and it ROCKED!"

it was the CHEMICAL BROTHERS.

say no more?

There's no doubt that techno is about to hit in the U.S., but do you
recall which song of theirs was used in that Microsoft commercial?  There
was no way the ad people for that one would have chosen some driving,
four-on-the-floor thing -- it would have been too much of a statement, too
obviously electronic, and too "this is techno, we're hip".  The song used
in that commercial sounds very similar to garage.  The riff was some
heavily distorted loop and the beat was definitely pulled from a rock
track of some kind.

Granted, I like the song, but I think it figures that the one they would
pick sounds vaguely "conventional".

     What is a drug?
     
     People seem to think caffeine, ephedrine, ginseng, pseudephrine, and 
     their over the counter relatives are not drugs just because they 
     aren't illicit...
     
     THESE ARE DRUGS (well, ginseng might not count by some definitions).
     
     People are already moving to make 'Herbal E' style ephedrine 
     supplements illegal due to some deaths associated with misuse (all 
     cases implied 4 or more times the recommended dosage or use of other 
     chemicals).
     
     Remember that misuse of drugs, not the drugs themselves, is the most 
     common reason people die from them.  Of the three drug OD fatalities I 
     have been close to, two were on 100% legal shit.  Perhaps we should 
     have a war on ignorance instead...
     
     If anybody here has ever taken many Vivarin and can claim not to feel 
     like absolute crap the next day, please step forward.  Also, using 
     caffeine to stay awake while driving is dangerous at best.  Be 
     careful.
     
     You can stay up all night at will.  Just have a good time and you'll 
     forget what time it is.  I personally advocate raving sober AND not 
     sober.  Just enjoy yourself and those around you.  Don't mope around 
     in your sobriety like it's a cross to bear or something.
     
     Oh, and you all forgot the magic elixir that got me through most of 
     Thursday night...
     
     CHAI!!!

I wish weekend was a little longer, but that is probably because I am still
tired from going out on Saturday :(.

Wed - Wish
	Fun, fun, fun - I really like going to Wish, maybe because I really
like having a drink or two (or how-ever-many I want) and dancing to good
music.  A lot of my friends were there, and after having few beers and few
pink lemonades, I made sure I met people that I haven't met before.  And
whoever always puts alcohol down at parties is damn wrong.  I feel like I
am such a good "drinker", I always meet people, I am nice and I personally
don't think there is anything wrong with my behavior (if you ever saw me
under the influence when I wasn't behaving nicely please let me know, and I
will keep it in mind).

Thursday - Thanksgiving
	After trying to get rid of my hangover (I guess that is the only
bad thing about drinking), having little turkey dinner, I was really
looking forward to going to this party (I have been looking forward to it
since I heard of it, because my B-Day was on 29th [after midnight], and Jon
Carel and MYSTR-E were spinning).  Due to whatever (supposedly it was all
my fault) my BF Marc and I got in a pretty bad fight right before we went
out :(.  I thought the fight was over and we would have fun, but little did
I know.  So, by the time we got there, things kept getting worse.  So, if
you saw me, you knew me, and you thought I was rude because I wasn't
talking to any of you, please don't be mad at me - I was basically trying
not to be too upset and trying not to think about the whole situation...
Enough about that....

	The party itself was fun - thanks Steve and others for all the
effort you guys put in.  I had fun listening to Jon Carel (and dancing a
little bit), and I just started getting into MYSTR-E's set when the party
got broken down...  It was sad, because it was my B-Day, my eyes were all
red and big from crying, MYSTR-E was spinning, and the party just got
busted (this was my first busted party as well).  I guess I just couldn't
deal with anything any more, and although we tried calling voice-mail once
(my roomate Ana really wanted to go back), three of us stayed home and fell
asleep.

Saturday - Be Here Now / Tribal Funk
	Marc, Ana, Sy and I went together (around 11pm) and although we had
pre-sale tickets, we didn't avoid the line (the VM said if you had tickets
you wouldn't have to wait in line).  The line was not as bad, so after
getting inside the only thing I kept thinking about was FTT and comparing
it (mistake, but I guess it was still fresh in my mind).  The decorations
in rooms were nowhere close to FTTs, and for some reason the music was not
as great.  I met some people from SFR that I haven't met before (hi Micron
and MHg).

Things that could have been better:
- bathrooms inside, rather than going outside in the rain and getting all
wet and cold
- Tribal Funk's room's ventilation - it was way too hot and although the
music was my favorite there, I couldn't stay there for too long
- DJ Dan's set - FTTs was way better
- Tony spinning early *again*
- wet, dirty floors

I did have fun, but I guess not as much as at FTT.  Maybe Gathering will be
better.

Time to go to lunch - see ya,
*B*

Hmm, pure oxygen...  Isn't that, like, flammable or something?
I think the flammability factor would go down when dispersed, but a
concentrated amount coming out of a fogger???
just pondering...

opinion, and it's not an opinion 

you know, i was introduced to PHISH by a fellow raver. 

i have never had the chance to go to a phish show but have been a part of
the grateful dead scene for longer than the rave scene. 
i know i will probably be flamed for bringing up the dead, but oh well. 

you know, both the grateful dead and phish scenes have attracted a number of
ravers.  
the scenes both give you the great vibe, loving family feel that raving
inspires as well. 

rather than rehashing the view of how that was such a harsh response, i
would rather like to say that it's too bad that you have never taken the
time to enjoy something considered non rave related.  there is a whole world
of music out there of really cool things that once inspired house, techno,
jungle musicians which took their music to another level. (some of these
influnces were even sampled into the music you enjoy!) 

when i responded to the first person who posted about phish, i was invited
to a mini party in the parking lot where they would be spinning some
tunes.(thank you for the invite, i am sorry i missed it!)  in the past, dj's
we all have seen posted here, have spun in the parking lots of grateful dead
shows.

although you will never find jungle music at a phish show, you are
guaranteed to catch some really funky beats! i am sure, since many heads are
also into the phish, you are sure to enjoy some killer drum circles and
great people to dance the night away with!

you know, there are things posted that i maybe do not have interest in or
knowledge in, but i would never think to flame them for my lack of interest.
you know, i live with my boyfriend, who happens to be an electronic musician
(courtney).   i do not have the knowledge to even understand what all goes
into his music but i have had the pleasure to be at a rave where his music
has been played, and just love the end result with all the others!  there
are posts here on musical instruments that i know nothing about, i just hit
delete, no big deal. 
i strayed, i know.  point is, if your into it, go with it.  if your not or
do not choose to be a part of it, leave it out. 

just my $.02.  this was not meant to anger anyone, rather my goal is to show
you all how everything is intertwind. 

peace, 
shannon

I almost forgot to tell you guys about this:

Okay, back after the "Wrinkle in Time" party, I put up a post telling
everyone the results of having a VR set at the party. In it I mentioned
that if anyone wanted to say "Thank You" to my friend who let me barrow
the equipment, just send him email.

Welllll....

I didn't see my friend at work untill the end of that week on Fri. I
went up and asked him if he got any thank you emails from people about
the VR set.

"Yea" he said "I got so many damn emails about that I had to stop
replying!!" He got something like 30 emails!!! Even though he was a bit
overwhelmed, he was actually very gratious for everyones appreciation!!
:D

That right there shows the power of this thing we call SFRaves...

And thank you so much to everyone who sent my friend Jeff a Thank You
letter!! <<<HUGS>>>  :) <--Note the smiley.

        I will be going to the lovely state of Florida from Dec.28th to
Jan.11th and was wondering what there was to do in the Miami and Keys
areas in the way of trance/techno/jungle/etc.- friendly clubs and upcoming
parties. If anyone out there can send me some info.; I'd really appreciate
it!:). Also, is there a raves mailing list for Florida?

	We're never going to solve this, folks. On the one hand, Phish has
very little to do with the rave scene. Sure lots of phisheads like raving,
and that's cool, but it's also true that a spam of posts about a concert
with no 'NRR' tags on it is going to invite flames.

On the other hand, we'd hate to constrain this list and lose all the
extraneous, but interesting conversations we have about raver
culture..which is much larger than raves themselves. 

My two cents? If you want to see if anyone else is going to the show, then
post a message with NRR in the subject...Perhaps replies should be made in
private and not forwarded to the list. I have nothing against the band
personally, but I think a lot of fans take it personally when someone
flames them. So let's try to view both sides before posting NRR material,
and likewise do the same beofore flaming people for posting info you might
not be interested in.

-peace out-

Actually that is the issue - I think you're completely missing the point,
Matt.  If you want to talk about the effects of language then you should
consider all of them, not just those that satisify some psychological need
to believe in progress or that everything's okay.

Like I said, I'm not aware of a single case of anything like genocide
except among language-bearing humans.  I don't understand your sentence
about domesticated animals, and if I were you I wouldn't be so certain that
anyone would agree without some serious convincing from you (which remains
to be seen).  I'm open to having mind changed...but you'll have to work
harder than this.
>  And language skills are essential to _avoid_ the problems you

Correction:  Language skills MAY help to avoid such problems, though of
course history is replete with examples to the contrary.  And the problems
themselves don't arise in the first place without language and the societal
structures it engenders.  My point isn't that language is all bad...just
that there's much more to it than terms like "advancement" and moving
"higher" suggest.  I doubt whether we should ascribe something like
"progress" to linguistic-conceptual development any more than we do to
phylogenetic development.  There is change, and over time a tendency toward
more complexity.

Nice quote...of course it's about communication, not about the effects of
language on consciousness.  And language is merely one form of
communication among many.

Just wanted to update y'all on the Cabin Music Tapes.

I'm having a friend check for me on Prices for tape duplications (he's 
got 'connections').  So I should have a total price by tomorrow.  

I'll keep you all informed.

So far I've got about 30 orders for tapes.  If there is anybody else in 
SFR land that wants tapes, please send me a Mail letting me know.

peace

-M

        Killer, I got the job I wanted in Oakland. It's supposed to be kinda
hard. 
NO PROB!

        I'll be working full time and going to school, fun fun fun. . . Wish
me luck!

        Now at least, I can fix my truck the way I want it, and I can get my
bike that's been on hold for like 4 months. I'm gonna just ride, snowboard,
and dance my brains out (on the weekends). And I'll actually have
money<----WHOA!!!

        Thanks fer your support, hope I can keep up with the list n all. . . 

        No MAD for me tonight, I don't wanna go to work all dead looking.

SMILE:)

And your 37 line signature that is appended to the bottom of each and every
one of your one-line replies you make to messages does?

Come on! There are nearly 450 people on this list that have to download and
read your HUGE signature from each and every one of your posts!

I found an ad in BAM for tape duplicating. I have no idea if this place is
reasonable or what, but I figured I would throw it out.

Northwestern Incorporated

demo package
-mastering
-on-cassette imprint
-c-30 digital bin pr real time
-duplication on TDK cobalt tape
-norelco clear case

100 - $1.65 each
200 - $1.45 each.

Maybe they can give you a quote on 50? :-)

Oh, come on.  This is getting a bit rediculous.  If you are going to 
flame people for the sig not being Rave Related, you might as well flame 
them for signing their name.  Peoples names have nothing to do with 
Raves.  

People, dont sign your name to your SFR posts anymore, thats not Rave 
Related.

geez.

Is everybody having a good Moday??

oops, sorry, thats not rave related.

[ to sfraves ]

 I just wanted to confirm if Astal Matrix is doing a live set in
Santa Cruz this Thursday ( Dec. 5th ). Will it be at this weekly
event? If so, what's the start/stop times? :

Ascendance - house, techno, trance w/DJs guest DJs weekly.
1133 Pacific Ave, Santa Cruz. ( "Palookaville" club )
408.429.2330
12.5 - Astral Matrix, Greg, Kamia 

 It might be worth driving over the hills for... and I can do 
some pre-show Christmas shopping too!

[if you don't like this post, flame me _privately_. public flaming will
automatically get you added to my ever-growing kill file.]

ok, folks, let's take a deep breath and look in the virtual mirror.

we're on a mailing list. not everything that's posted to sfraves is stuff
we all want to read.

i, for one, _read_ 90% of mail marked NRR, where as i _delete_ a good 70%
of the stuff that's not, without a second glance. this is not so much
because i prefer reading NRR material, it's because all the stupid fools
(flames invited here;) who post shit i don't want to read always forget to
put NRR in the title...

but i delete a lot of rave-related material too. generally, i hear about
the good parties from my friends, not from sfraves. and i've really grown
tired of reading weekend reviews, with some exceptions. but i don't
begrudge those who want to post this stuff.

there are filtering mechanisms for those who want to avoid some mail.
because of all the fuck-ups :) who don't use "NRR", that one's of little
use, but they still can be helpful. i have filters set up to automatically
trash anything with "overpriced", "gangsta", "coolworld", "massive", or
"adidas" in the subject header, as well as filters for a few individuals
whose names i won't mention.

if you need help with filtering, please ask.

finally, many of our bandwidth/nrr issues could be resolved if we could
please _flame people PRIVATELY_. if anyone on this list actually likes
reading other people's flames, i'd love to hear about it.

so let's all chill out and respect each other, and make this mailing list a
plurrier place for all.

love (even to those i just insulted the hell out of),

brian

Well I'm an Environmental Engineer and so maybe this is something I could 
get into? I could set up a company to dispose of all drug related waste.  
all those Speed and E manufaturers could send me their remains.  You 
could even send me you resin from all the pipes and bongs in Cali.  I 
could even set up a plant here in San Luis Obisbo since the majority of 
the crank labs have been reported to be in this area.  All 
those "lawabiding" lab owners will send me their waste in exchage for a 
cleaner tommorrow.  This might drive up the price of your drugs but 
atleast we won't have hazerdouse chemicals in our groundwater.
Life is good.

Well I'm just playin' but in acctuallity it will never happen.  Its a sad 
thing but bad things happen all the time to the environment.  What about all 
those leagal companies who dump thier waste in the ground, streams, rivers,
 lakes and such with out your knoledge just to save a buck and we all suffer. 
 Maybe some day everyone will realize what we have and we should all take care
 of what we got left.

Most likely it is, in concentrated blasts.   But casinos have been pumping 
oxygen into their gambling for years, and smoking is allowed there.  Many a 
good 36-hour stint was pulled at the tables back in the good ole days of 
college thanks to the oxygen pumps. According to one dealer, they start pumping 
it up around 1 am and continue increasing it until the morning.  

Anyone from Reno on the list, to say how to set up an oxygen system?

       Isn't it funny though that the vibe is sometimes (if not always) 
affected by the non-sober folks? Both in healthy and unhealthy ways.

 Sorry but I don't consider these "non-drugs" just because they are 
legal. If anyone does you should suspect that your brain has been washed.

 Same point here. These are drug bearing plants. Which then I guess leads 
us to the chemical vs. "natrual" drug debate.
 If you talk to most homepaths and nutrtionists they will tell you that 
ANY stimulant is essientially not "good" for you.

 Ryan, I think your intentions are good here but you can't spaek for 
everyone. Each bio-system is unique and can potentially have very 
different reactions then what you (and others) have experienced. The best 
bet (IMO) is to learn to listen to your own body rather than taking the 
advice of others (ravers, doctors, whomever) blindly.

 These methods have worked really well for me also. Don't forget them 
bannanas!!

Cool World is NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT a Rave Production.
They are are a PARTY Production. They may talk about raves and Peac and
all that, but I do not recomend going to any Cool World PARTY (I
emphasize the party part) unless you enjoy, getting pushed, shoved,
stepped on, talked down to, getting a fist full of bad vibes thrown at
you, spit on, maybe even raped, you bag stolen, them taking away your
glitter, highlighter, water, and anything else that makes a rave not a
rave, because Cool World doesn't through raves they throw parties. And
anyone who saids Otherwise I have onE thing to say to them.

 This is pretty funny knowing of ARYCK's usual anti-drug position. I took 
his post to mean that the party sucked so bad that you would only enjoy 
it if completly gonzoed on whatever. As I recall ARYCK usually decries 
the anti-realness of E. And a lot of his posts are tongue-in-cheek.

hmmm, a bit sensitive and insecure maybe?

 Except here at SFraves whenever someone posts something you don't like. You 
tend to sound a bit shrill rather than trying to discuss issues. (IMO)

It would be nice to see that smile more often.

Why do I rave?
	Over time, the reason has changed as much as I have changed. 
Originally, it was the first really open environment I had found where I
didn't feel pressured to act a certain way and a place where what I did
spoke for itself and wasn't overanalysised. E in that time was a tool I
used to dig into that jar in the back of my head that made me a horrible
person and work through those things - either realizing that the things
were not so bad or that they really were, but I would look at how bad they
made me feel, feel how heavy that imprint was, and realize what was so bad
about it and then be able to "correct" my actions before I get into a
situation or made a decision that I would regret later. Also, I got over
the a of making mistakes that I had had, and realized that they were
inevitable. In essence, I moved from looking at things as "why does this
always happen to me" to "ooops, I fucked up, I will avoid that in the
future". 

	Then I moved to Stirling, Scotland for a while. Along with 
sorting a bunch of shit out there, I found something I had never 
witnessed in SF. Festis and Gabber! Somewhere along the line, raving 
transformed from what I guess people would call a healing experience to 
to an experience of the primitive energies that run through people (well, 
that's my take on it). Once I had gotten to point where I was comfortable 
with myself, raves nicely enough transformed into odd-fests where we 
pushed something further and further. Imagine the grass covered earth 
shaded by conifers, fires burning in little camps spotting the forst 
(this is scotland, you can have fires on the ground and not have to worry 
about the whole forest going up), fire jugglers, fire blowers, people 
painted blue, a procession between the sound systems lead by a piper, a 
snare drummer, and a bass drum... While this was all very silly, it was 
very tribal in a way that I cannot explain. These raves were more about 
taking the energy that gets funneled into aggression, competetiveness, or 
depression and redirecting it to a dance to fast music that pounds into one 
(not all gabber comes from LA or includes samples telling one to fuck off 
or whatever, alot of it is just fast with hard kick drums, and dark). E 
was something I might do because I liked my skin being tingly or I might 
want to go up one of the hills and chat with people - I like the way a 
little mdma can make everything have a little more weight... It was not 
necessary linked with raves.
	Back in SF, I would like to see parties that have that same edge, 
where people push as hard as in Scotland at Sativa. But maybe that has 
something to do with the weather ;)

     Anybody offended by the above, I'd be happy to accept recommendations on

     (you can never tell what's offensive anymore).  All the talk about certain 
     manners of dress and massives and MTV and mounting commercialism has really 
     gotten to me (both sides of the argument have...), so I thought it would be 
     fun to have a massive-stylee announcement for a lunch.  Everybody is 
     invited, I love you all, even if your clothes do cost more than my car.  
     Okay?  Whoever you are, be that person and stay real!!!  Have a great

Hello,

	I just thought I would post this to the list to see if there was any
interest...

	There will be a room opening up in my house most likely on Jan 1st - 5th.
It is a four bedroom house with two full bathrooms. Rent goes for $295/mo.
You would share the electric and water with three very easy going cool
roomies! We are looking for a laid back, super cool person to take over one
room. Please respond personally if you are interested... Thanks 


Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

Well I had a busy saturday evening.  I went to 2 parties that night and I 
kept going from Be Here Now to Tribal Funk and then back again.  I am so 
worn out and it's monday.

I'd have to say that Be Here Now was the better party.  Though i love 
hearing Utopia, Garth, Dan and Tony, the BHN rooms were more fun for me. 

I got to HOME around 11 and wow the place is huge.  I've been to Homebase 
many times but never when they had all the rooms open.  It was so crowded 
around 11 - 1 it was unreal.  Esp in the hallways.  

I'd have to say the lasers in the main room were mind melting.  Fantastic 
display of colors and patterns and with the sheets up in the middle it 
produced a better '3d' effect.  Too many lights though.  The big yellow 
light in the main room and all the "club" style intela lights in the Funk 
room were too much.  
   Favorite dj's - Hyperactive was sick!  And when Dan went on I could 
choose between them.  Dan's set was more hardcore than I've ever heard 
but I got down with a few good dancers for a good half hour before the 
heat got to me.    Mark Farina was good but I wanted to hear faster beats 
so I stayed in the small back room.  I heard some sick euro-techno back 
there but I never got the name of any of the djs.  I even spent some time 
dancing to jungle with Abstract.  I think I'm gonna pick up his tape. :)

DRC got me movin' most of her set.  i just got 1 of her tapes the other 
day and I love the crazy hard edge she has in her sets.  And then there 
was Peter Lazonby (sp?) UK.  He was calm, collected, focused, and played 
what seemed to be a well thought out set.  Slow and mellow at first to a 
bumpin' techno groove that had me still moving at the end of the night. 

  The vibe wasn't there for me in the beginning.  Negative and 
uninviting.  But as the night progressed I found the finer aspects of the 
party and stuck with my instincts.  I had a great time.  Many people did 
in their own way.  Too bad about the taging; the rave gunk got the best 
of my cloths; and there still is a free water shortage at big parties.

I wish I would have known when and were Jonah sharp, Dutch, Concious 
Labs, and Phil Smart were playing.  I wanted to check them but don't 
think I did.  I would love it if promoters would provide a play list with 
you ticket so you would know when and were a performer was spinning.  
Besides WOM how do you expect to know when your favorite dj will be playing?
My ESP doesn't work as well as most peoples' I guess.

Bye for now - off to study for finals 
Hope everyone's Thanksgiving went well!


PLUR,

       Austin

first:
a couple of weeks ago a friend came down to Santa Ana and visited for a
few days.  He left me with a book called "Illusions:  The Adventures of a
Reluctant Messiah".  Sadly, I haven't had time to read it until my lunch
hour today.  Now, at the Cabin, I found myself really tripping out on one
spoken word portion in the ambient stuff, and low and behold, reading
through this book, I find the same passages.  Strange...

second:
I have an interview for a position at Golden Gate University on Thursday
afternoon.  So what does that mean?  Weekend in the city!!  What's the
party of choice for this weekend?  It sure would be nice to spread some
happiness with you all while I have the chance!!  :)

third:
I hope everyone is having a nice start to their week and that everything
is bright and happy all around each and every one of you!  :)  PLUR

AGAIN!!  CALLING IT, RIGHT ON THE NAIL!!!   You sir, are an intelligent, 
conscious human being with some actual smarts in your head!  Very nice to 
see!!  Now if everyone could just think like this, Cool World could be a 
purely GANGSTA party (it's true intention), and we would all be happy!  
The gangstas could go to thier party, and people without guns could go to 
others!!  WOO HOO!!

Happy trails...

P.S.  And I too will tell any who say otherwise onE thing...

true story - i was eating lunch at guadalahara grill in concord
last weekend (great food) and at the table next to me this lady was
telling her friend what her daughter wanted for christmas.
"she doesn't care as long as it's adidas or fila".

the irony was lost on the mom who didn't grow up during the breakdancin 80s.

Well met _LiQuiD_

  I totally agree with you! ***BAD-ASS** music Must come first.
  if the music is right. Nothing can stop you. It's strange. Last night, I
was dancing at my friend Wayne's house, ofcourse, to BAD-ASS music. And
when we went outside to fire it up, Wayne says to me "You know Jeff. See if
they would of played more bad-ass music like that last night. You would of
been dancing like you were just now. Then you wouldn't be tripping off all
that negative shit people were filling you with all night"
  The music defonetly gives you more energy than any drug.


I think I may be of service in the herbal department though..  =]:..
Hey! I didn't say I was a sober ravEr or nothing!


You can get yourself a bottle of Rip Fuel at any GNC store.  That will Zoom
you for a few good Dj sets or so. I took two my first time, and... 
Weeeeee.........
 Weight trainers take it before working out.

 But now. There is a new bottle on that shelf. Also GNC. It's called
Thermadreen (Not sure of the spelling. Just ask for ther-ma-dreen. Energy
sup). This will defonetely get yea going! But I think it works with body
fat or something though, becouse I don't really get off much on it. But
Wayne (He works out, and stays in shape) He can cut down a full grown pine
tree in one day when he takes off on that stuff. And my friend Tim (He is
huge, and full of body fat. He is always on the stuff) He can make a ravE
dance circle, 20 yards wide in 6.4 seconds! The only place Tim ever gets
lonely is in the moshing pit at a Verbal Abuse concert. But don't take my
word for it. If you want to try something legal, that don't clog up your
head. Go down to GNC.
 
Hope you like um.
Jeff

In a message dated 96-12-02 20:46:20 EST, you write:

<< Cool World is NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT a Rave Production.
 They are are a PARTY Production. They may talk about raves and Peac and
 all that, but I do not recomend going to any Cool World PARTY (I
 emphasize the party part) unless you enjoy, getting pushed, shoved,
 stepped on, talked down to, getting a fist full of bad vibes thrown at
 you, spit on, maybe even raped, you bag stolen, them taking away your
 glitter, highlighter, water, and anything else that makes a rave not a
 rave, because Cool World doesn't through raves they throw parties. And
 anyone who saids Otherwise I have onE thing to say to them.
 
 PLURF
 Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, Fuck You!
 -Paul
 P.S. Good Vibes and Love To All!
  >>
Dude, dont spread shit like that around! Rape, Fuck you. thats not cool.( no
pun intended) I have never gone to one of their big productions, but I can
assure that what you say is not true. This happenes every time,. people diss
them people diss Martin, people diss people for clothes whatever.... nobody
can change that, but dont say harsh words when you can't back them up with
the truth. 
Peace,
Jonathan

P.S. how can you even expect people to take you seriously with PLURF
Peace, Love, Unity, respect, and Fuck you??? You are confused my friend.

Yes, I'd love to read this paper.

Why I rave, personally, is a multi-level question, as you are well aware.
To me the rave scene [and also the underground club scene which is
inextricably entwined (I know I will get flamed for that)] is about art.
The DJs, the lighting designers, the flyers and, above all, the people, are
all individual folk artists who come together to make this modern
performance piece.  I love to go to an event early and watch the whole
thing go by.  As the whole energy picks up and peaks and dies down.  It is
such an AWESOME spectacle, which I feel is unparalled in our modern
culture.  When a good event comes together and "pops", meaning the music
and people and vibe reach that pitch that is tangible and indescribable all
at the same time, but you know when it is happening, these are truly
epiphinaic moments for me when I gain insight into myself and my relation
to the universe.  This is the truly underapreciated side of the scene and
what I love about it most.

But also, I come for the sense of fun, elation, escape.  To be someone I am
not during the rest of the week.  I lose a lot of inhibitions when I am out
dancing and having fun.  I have no hesitation going up to people and just
starting conversations [with or without E :)]. I love creating costumes and
seeing other creative people in strange, wonderful, frightening, and/or
cool get-ups.

And then there is just plain old dancing.  That innate human desire to
fling your body about to the beat of drums and melodic strains.  What a
great stress releiver!!

that's a start, at least.  good luck on your paper

Your post defonently opens some eyes, I am sure.

  But if I am going to go ride my bike in the park to "have a great time"
and enjoy things around me. And what it means to me, to be alive. If
somebody in that park keeps throwing sticks in my spokes. It don't matter
how I approched my day. I will be pissed. And I don't concider a negative
pissed off attitude, a good time.
  Anyone thats thinks that Addidas clothing is a gangsta thing. You need to
either goto LA, or stop admiring that all beatin up red tagged jail bird
gangsta, in that movie COLORS.
  Addidas was a Break Dancing thing first off. I had just about every color
addidas sweat jacket on the market in 1983. My purple one was my favorite.
  Hello. Get a clue. Gangsta's wear Raiders jackets, and tatoo there names
on the back of there necks. Duh...   }:\

  And I wouldn't blame anyone for getting sick of my complaints. But people
that whine about the mear apperance of a fellow ravEr. You ain't seen
nothing! You ever been (by a total stranger to you), had rumors spread
about you? Been called an asshole? Or a loser, tweek, or dick? How about
"Hey man. Why don't you get out of our scene"? at a ravE!! By friendly
smiling ravEr people...  "Yea right!"  And these are people I have never
talked to! The only thing they could possibly know about me....  Is that I
am not like them. I am different..... Get that. The only person shastized
for being different at a ravE. Sad, sad, sad.
  But! I still go smiling, and in love with everyone around me. Becouse I
can feel how forgiving ravErs can be. And nobody is at fualt here. People
don't feel comfertable around people they don't understand. I know if each
and everyone of them, knew how I was inside. If I didn't have so much walls
blocking there path to understanding. They would all turn around, and
welcome me for who I am. Seriously!


Just thought I would take this opportunity to vent.  =]:..
Jeff

: And disses people who don't seem to be cool enough.

: too?
: 
: Clothes don't make the person, the *person* does. At the risk of quoting

: I've been in a "shitty space filled with a bunch of "A***** wearin

: mood, it's your attitude. I mean you can be on DRUGS in a bad scene and 
: have an even WORSE time. It's all in how you approach the whole night. 
: If you go into a huge place with bad vibes you can say (soberly *or* 
: high) "this sucks, I'm gonna have a shitty time, this fucking sucks! I'm 
: gonna pop a few pills/tabs" and bitch and moan about it all night and 
: have a bad time, or you can say "yea, the vibe's pretty nasty here, but 
: i think i can pretty much ignore it and appreciate the music and 
: whatever positive people there are around me" and have a not-so-bad if 
: not great time. I heard alot of people saying "yea the vibe was shitty

	For the book, I was simply telling that person that their
	PHISH stuff shouldn't be posted on sfRAVES w/out NRR...
	just like all the other people screamed @ me too when
	I asked a question not rave related.

	There NEVER would have a been a problem if people would
	just post Rave Related stuff on SFRAVES.

	So please just relax, and lets drop this STOOPID phish thing.
	I hate phish!!!!!  Not to mention, living in S.C. w/  90%
	of the phish followers does get to ones TECHNO craving heart.

Because it's not strictly true?  "Advanced", in this context, is an
entirely subjective term, so we can define ourselves to be either the
most advanced, the least advanced, or anywhere in between.  And the more
research I do into various social animals (chimpanzees, ravens, wolves,
etc.), the less I believe that we dominate even the traditional measures
of advancement (symbolic language, tool usage, complexity of
interaction, and so on).

In fact, the average human, from a biological perspective, leads a
stunningly featureless life of work->TV->sleep->repeat, with occasional
hunting for mates thrown in.  The fact that this average human uses a
lot of very complex technology to do so isn't interesting from a
sociobiological standpoint, as they had no hand in creating it and do
not understand it in the least.  A human driving a car is no more
intrinsically impressive than a seagull dropping a shell on the road so
that the same car will crack it open and let her eat the contents.

	I agree that sticks in your spokes could be annoying, and piss you off, 
but at a party, no matter what shit is talked, can't you just ignore it 
and LOSE yourself into the MUSIC, and dance your ass off?
	I know that when someone says something about you, because you're 
wearing this type of clothing or that, it's pretty fucking annoying. But 
why do you let it bother you, when you know these people are SHALLOW 
enough to even judge you based on what shirt you decided to wear that 
night? Their judgement should mean nothing to you, and you should be 
able to go on and keep dancing. It's hard, yea, and sometimes the sticks 
stop you.. And MASS props to you Jeff, for keeping yourself REAL.
	But HONESTLY, what can DRUGS do to get rid of the spokes? You could get 
high enough to pretend that the stick isn't there, but if it's so bad 
that you have to take drugs to get rid of the stick, the stick must be 
so big you can't even ride your bike.... Ya still with me on this 
analogy? I guess what I'm trying to say is that yea, there's gonna be 
people talkin shit and trying to ruin the vibe sometimes, but the night 
is what you make of it, not what drugs you take. Everyone has their 
choice whether or not to do E, I do it sometimes and sometimes I don't 
but I don't let other people's attitudes decide whether or not I'm gonna 
do drugs, I let myself decide it. 
But then again, that's just me...
Smiles,
LAra..

p.s. Madame Mercury, you will be MISSED gurl! *hugz*

[more snippage]

don't ya just love it when someone screams at you to (be mellow, feel the 
vibe, respect one another, insert your own euphimism here) and then 
expects your respect and understanding? Sorta like being the victum in an 
abusive relationship.
 It's especially encouraging when they take a provcative, aggressive and 
hostile tone and then don't wish to engage in a dialogue about the 
situation. Strikes me as insecure or deliberate muck-raking.

 On the other hand the association of what one wear's as to one's 
general "coolness" factor _is_ sloppy thinking. This is displayed by the 
"gangsta's" and the people that decry them.


peace y'all

Hi all!  =)

 Yes I know this is the second time on the list; I'm trying to catch all 
those who unsubscribed on turkey weekend. ;)

 I could use a ride from Santa Cruz to SF on friday for Mantra. I'm just 
bringing slides and lighting so there is not a whole lot of stuff. ;) I 
would like to leave around noon or so although this is negotionable. 

 Ideally a ride back would be ideal but I do have a way back if neccesary.
Gas, of course, will be covered and driver need not be concerned with any 
physical labor (although help is never refused ;).

 I can be reached here or called at the number below.

Thanks!!!!!  =)

The Grateful Dead certainly did.   I got into raving because the Dead got me
hooked on dancing.
Deadheads and ravers have a lot in common too.

Sorry about gettin so pissed of about COOL WORLD.
Didn't mean to be so mean, but i meant what i said earlier. And i don't
beleive that people get raped at every cool world. But i do know that my
friend knows a girl who got rapped by a bunch of gangas on E. As far as
all the other stuff. I can back it up any day because it happened to me.
As far as COOL WORLD as a production group, I don't know why this happens
at their parties. It just does. Maybe it is because their flyers are
magazines and are passed out at School, Malls (ie: Valley Fair,
Serramonte), And I even saw one on the ground oustide a Safeway. Now
raves are supposed to be an underground thing. They aren't anymore, but
we are suppose to try to keep it as low key as possible. That means small
flyers that don't attract the attention of people who don't understand
how to act at a rave such as Clubbers, Gangstas, Bad Vibes, whatever
people who don't know what a rave is truly about. PLUR not drugs, not
music, not Sex on E. It may not be very PLURish to say those things about
COOL WORLD, but i am only looking out for other ravers who have never
been to a COOL WORLD and may be planning to go to it this New Years. I
suggest going to one of the many other New Years raves. Lets leave COOL
WORLD to the Clubbers, Gangstas, Bad Vibes.  Don't go to a COOL WORLD,
its not worht the money.

PLUR,
Paul

P.S. For heavens sakes people, think about it. Angelina and Rough Neck
are preforming live their! They play their songs on WILD 107.7!

I don't know if it was mentioned at all, for my e-mail acct was not
receiving jack this weekend, but this last Friday has got to be one of the
most crazy daisy fuct things ever. 

Me and my friend hitchiked down to SF, it took us two hours than it
normally takes (a smaking seven hours, with another hitchiker's smelly dog
on my lap- not that this was bad b/c the dog was cute, but it just adds to
my complaining effect). We arrive in SF; we were going to meet his friend
staying in Modesto in Sac to go to Ubiquitous, but we find it is now in
SF. So his friend drives out to SF (and it is her first party, by the way,
and my friend can count the number of parties he's been to on his fingers,
he says).

The normal delays, we don't get to the venue until 12. Long line. We wait.
We wait. All hell breaks loose and the line is no longer a line but a
lateral lump of people holding their tickets in the air wanting to bust
past the security (the guy behind me pushing against the mass of people
saying 'you gotta take a risk, you gotta take a risk' repeatedly). What
the fuck? It's shutting down at 2?! 

"Are the cops gonna conveniently show up?" I say. Heh, heh, famous first
words.

So we go around to the side chill locale and beg mercy to the security
guy, and he lets us in b/c there's only a half hour left. We sprint in,
dance like crazy for the shortest duration that I have ever -paid- for. 
This is like the third or fourth time that my friend has had a shitty time
with SF parties, and I've been trying to convince him that SF has some
good to it. I had had a bad feeling about that party but it was supposed
to be free so he wanted to go, plus there would be no financial risk for
his friend if it flopped.

We stayed the night at his friend's cousin's house, ate lunch, and then
decided it wasn't worth it to try to go to another party. So we drove
home.

Just thought I'd post that my Company has some Tech Support/Engineering
jobs open. For more info check out...   ( www.insignia.com/hr/jobs.html#ts
)

It's not listed there, but we are looking for Tech engineers for Mac also.

If you don't have access to the web just let me know and I can email you
the info. The company is in Santa Clara. This company treats it's people
really good too. In fact sometimes too good. I guess that's why I like
working here. They notice you when you do good. It would take a BIG pay
increase to leave here. Everyone I work with are really great too.


Anyway, just thought I'd post it here so maybe a fellow 'raver' can get a
job if they want.  If you want to know more just ask.

o Don't eat a large meal before you rave.
o Take a "disco nap" betwen 8 pm and 11 pm before you go out
o And the most important thing is to get plenty of aerobic exercise and
  avoid animal products in your diet, many long term ravers are veggies and i think its for
  that reason, the less meat you eat the less uric and lactic acid (the things that trigger
  that tired feeling) build up you will have.

Good Luck on your interview!

While I have had my share of ExperiencEs, The majority of the parties that I have attended over
the past year or so I attended completely sober, even "back in tha day", Aerobics and a veggie diet
will beat Meth any day.

John, I really wish you would get off this "everyone is a racist" crap.
"Gangsta" is about attitude, not color.

And I do wish that many of you white males would stop using code words to 
indetify people of color.  Enough of the veiled racist bullshit that has 
invaded this list.

Enough of the not-so-veiled racism.  Enough of the "non-pc" ways of 
categorizing people just becuase you can.

Enough of you not understanding other peoples feelings.  

Enough indeed.

Late,
John

How about if we just stop talking about gangstas all together. What
happened to PLUR? Even if somebody is different they should be accepted by
the rave scene, shouldn't they. Have you ever considered that maybe the
gangstas are trying to make a change in their lives by going to raves? So
what if they still walk around looking like criminals, they still
contribute to the diversity that makes raves what they are today. I think
everybody should take a nice long 420 break and loosen up!

I was going through my desk at work and realized we are having a Company

campus from 7pm-midnight. Grilled fillet minion, grilled samon, grilled
portabella mushrooms for the main course. I don't have a thing to wear or
even a date to take. Why did I say I would go let alone plus one guest.
Business/Semi-formal Attire is not even in my wardrobe. Now I'm going to
have to buy some clothes, I guess that might be a good thing though.

 I was planning on maybe checking out Lepidoptera after my company party.
What is everyone else doing friday night????

>From the front page of this mornings chronicle.

>>>>
A counterattack against California's controversial ``medical marijuana''
law began on Capitol Hill
          yesterday, with lawmakers calling for stepped-up enforcement
of federal drug statutes to blunt the
          impact of the ballot measure. 

          A U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the law opened on
the eve of a meeting today in
          Sacramento of state Department of Justice agents, county
district attorneys, county sheriffs and
          municipal police to devise strategies for prosecuting
marijuana growers. 

          ``Candidly, we don't know what our options are right now,''
said Steve Telliano, a spokesman for
          Attorney General Dan Lungren, who called the meeting. ``The
law is so open-ended and vague,
          there are so few specifics, that police and prosecutors are
genuinely confused. Anything appears to
          be possible, but we won't have an idea of where we stand until
(the conclusion of the summit).'' 

          At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington
yesterday, lawmakers vowed to watch the
          impact of California's medical marijuana initiative -- as well
as a similar ballot measure passed in
          Arizona -- calling them a first step in a well-orchestrated,
well-funded plan to legalize drugs in
          America. 

          ``We can't let this go without a response,'' Senator Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, declared. 

          Senator Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., charged that Arizona voters had been
hoodwinked into supporting his
          state's measure by deceptive advertising, and he asked the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration
          to accelerate anti-drug efforts there. 

          ``I believe most of them (voters) were deceived and
deliberately so by the sponsors of this
          proposition,'' Kyl said. ``(The ballot measure) begins a road
to destruction of people's lives in this
          country.'' 

          In California, law-enforcement officials meeting today will
try to develop strategies that specifically
          address Proposition 215's vague cultivation clauses. 

          The initiative states that the seriously ill or their primary
caregivers may cultivate marijuana for the
          patient's personal use. But the term ``primary caregiver'' is
not defined, nor is the amount of pot
          specified that may be legally grown. 

          ``Everyone is up in the air about this,'' said Ed Denson,
director of the Civil Liberties Monitoring
          Project, a Humboldt County organization that keeps tabs on
police actions against local marijuana
          growers. ``There's so much about the initiative that nobody
understands. How many plants can
          patients grow? Who or what is a caregiver? Can you hire
somebody to grow for you? Can there be
          communal gardens? Nobody has the faintest idea.'' 

          Denson said it would be extremely difficult for law
enforcement agents to determine the difference
          between legal and illegal marijuana plots under Proposition
215's language. 

          RAIDING THE GARDENS 

          ``I assume that they'll continue to raid very large gardens
that they see from the air, ones that
          obviously exceed reasonable limits of the `personal use'
provisions,'' said Denson. ``But what
          happens when they come across small gardens? Especially ones
that have signs on them identifying
          them as medical marijuana?'' 

          Even Proposition 215's advocates have found themselves in two
philosophical camps about
          marijuana cultivation. 

          Dennis Peron, the co-writer of Proposition 215 and director of
a San Francisco marijuana buyer's
          club that was raided by state agents August 4, said the
passage of the initiative would generally
          ``loosen the bonds'' for pot cultivators. 

          ``You're going to see more pot and cheaper pot around,'' said
Peron. ``I suspect more people will
          grow it, for either medical (or recreational) use. What the
passage (of 215) shows is that the people
          of California want a change in legal priorities -- they're
saying armed robbery and drive-by shootings
          deserve more attention than somebody smoking a joint.'' 

          But Bill Zimmerman, campaign manager for California for
Medical Rights, the lead promotional
          organization for Proposition 215, strongly disagrees. 

          NARROW INTERPRETATION 

          ``The voters who approved Proposition 215 were not voting to
liberalize laws on the recreational
          use of marijuana,'' said Zimmerman. ``They were voting to
ensure that legitimate medical patients
          with legitimate recommendations from legitimate physicians
would have access to medical marijuana.
          We think the proposition should be interpreted narrowly to
benefit patients and only patients.'' 

          Zimmerman warned that an unregulated boom in pot cultivation
could harm the medical marijuana
          movement. 

          ``The people could take away in 1998 what they gave in 1996,''
said Zimmerman. ``If Proposition
          215 is ultimately perceived as leading to a substantial
increase in recreational marijuana smoking and
          cultivation, we could very easily see the passage of an
initiative that overturns the decriminalization of
          medical marijuana.''

Yeah, but it is perfectly acceptable to talk shit about all us evil "white
males," huh? Who is categorizing whom? 

> Enough of you not understanding other peoples feelings.  

Look in the mirror John.

A while back, I believe Larry Ching went to the trouble and did a little
survey about the use of the word "gangsta" to describe certain
individuals. The results confirmed my understanding and use of the word:
"gangsta" is about attitude and not color. 

It is only a color issue because you wish it to be one.  


                                 Just another white male
				 (and it is PC to bash us
				  so go for it!)

MHg, please don't go! I know it gets weird when people on the list
get picky about NRR and ganstas and adidas and stuff, but we're still
a big family even though we get into ridiculous squabbles about nothing. 
I didn't think it was unreasonable to ask for an NRR when posting about 
phish, so what's the big deal!? 

Hope you'll stay - I actually LIKED your cool high-bandwidth signature!

I think if you read what plur@juno.com wrote, you might consider taking 
your foot out of your mouth:

>"And i don't beleive that people get raped at every cool world. But i do know 
that my
>friend knows a girl who got raped by a bunch of gangas on E. As far as
>all the other stuff. I can back it up any day because it happened to me..."

Fist off, you (Jon"dabomb") have never even *been* to one of thier 
"parties," so where do you get off spouting off such strong opinions?  
Maybe you should get some actual *facts* to back up your mindless, 
uninformed  blabbering, huh?   I, nor others cannot see one single hint 
of a reason to defend them (Cool World) in any way - why do you?   
Everything that has been said against them is true and then some.
*Think before you speak*, and avoid unsightly, foot-in-mouth moments - 
for your own good and others.
On a final note, I again quote the wise, and informed words of 
plur@juno.com:

>P.S. For heavens sakes people, think about it. Angelina and Rough Neck
>are preforming live their! They play their songs on WILD 107.7!

Anybody that has a 107.7 preset on any piece of stereo equipment need not 
reply or comment!!!!!   Immediately disqualified!  :-)

Hello,

It looks as if I'll be spinning @ a small house/techno/ravish party in
the Oakland Hills area on Friday.  Since it is in a semi-residential
district, it looks as if it will go on till midnite-ish or so.  Methinks
that Ill be @ __Lepidoptera__ for that after party thing (granted it
might be a bit funny watching me boogie my crippled butt to techno). 

__Karma__ looks like the thing to do on Saturday.

C-U in the void,
Adam

 Sorry to have said anything, I mean everyone knows all that i say is usually

 Wait a sec. Your message really angered me so I can't really reply without
 some sort of negativity so as to prevent some huge long thread from starting
 Im just going to accept whatever it is that you where trying to tell me and
 leave it at that.
 Oh and somebody told me Voltaire said" I may not agree with what you are
 saying but I will fight to my death to protect your right to say it!!" I can
 think of nothing more fitting for Sfraves than that!
 Peace,
 Jonathan

strong opinions?" 
Wait a sec. Your message really angered me so I can't really reply without
some sort of negativity so as to prevent some huge long thread from starting
Im just going to accept whatever it is that you where trying to tell me and
leave it at that.
Oh and somebody told me Voltaire said" I may not agree with what you are
saying but I will fight to my death to protect your right to say it!!" I can
think of nothing more fitting for Sfraves than that!
Peace,
Jonathan

          I think one of the main reasons people find themselves sick
          after parties is sharing water. I know I always share my
          water with anyone around. :) And it only takes one person
          who has a cold, and doesn't have water, to infect a whole

Sir,

as much as you would have liked me to, I did NOt categorize all white 
males.  I said many white males on this list.  Many is not ALL.  Please 
re-read.  Then we can re-read the archives to see where allt his gangstah 
talk started.  I gurantee  it was not started by either Geoff or I (from 
what I know the ONLY two black males on this hokey-doke anyway).  I would 
also like to point out that this cetgorization has been leveled against 
people of color for all types of reasons.  I think your dad is an ex-cop, 
ask him how people were categorized for easy pick-up and removal.

In any case, I am categorizing the behaviour of many on this list as 
completely reprehensible and racist.  Sorry, but I like to call a spade 
a spade.  You and others would like to mask this truth by saying that 
such speech is to categorize behvaiour and not color.  Really?  And so 
plkease, educate me and others, who may  know some real gangstahs, what 
does a gangstah act like?  What is gangstah attitude?  Have you ever met 
a gangstah (traditional)?  What has been your interaction with such 
people and how did THEY get into OUR little scene?

It is only a color issue becuase it  has always been a color issue.

I will not cry for your whiteness, nor will I bash you for it.  But if 
you do like to use the term gangstah so much, I just might lable you a 
racist.  But then, white males have been labelling things for centuries.  
Let's all get in the game.

;<  this conversation sux.

So does the rampant racism on this list.  I have also understood the 
sexsim to be out of control as well.  But I can only fight one dumb 
battle at a time.  I will let my sisters do the other dirty tasks, and 
give them my 100% support.

This town needs a hihg colonic.

Out,
John

Funny how when I mentioned that "..many of you white males" used 
derrogatory code words to describe people, you were offended.  Why?  I 
mean, the list is predominantly white and male.  I of course do not 
resort to code words to describe who I am talking about, but that is not 
the point.  

The point is many on this list use the words of division to describe 
those people who are differnt than they.  We use the terms us and them, 
at first.  Then it just degrades from that point into devisive name 
calling, caode words, nonsense.

>From our history together, as party goers/ravers/list history we know 
what words will get a response.  We KNOW that we have gone round after 
round about the word gangstah, to the point where people try to re-define 
it as attitude moreso than a particular look or color.  I guess one must 
consider, before using such speech, where the words originate from 
(vocally).  Example; I as an African-American male can be in the compnay 
of my bretheren (i.e. other blakc males), and use the term n****r w/o 
fear of reprisal (pretty much).  But if I were a white male, would the 
same rules apply.  If I am a gay male and am talking to my brtheren (i.e 
other gay males), and say "Shit, I am not going to that damn party, I'm 
sick of all those f*gs."  is it the same as if I were a straight male and 
say the same words?

And that is what I mean.  Just because YOU have redfined a term does not 
mean that it has any less impact in the real world.  And in certain 
neighborhoods, talkin all that gangstah stuff will get your ass kicked.  
Just for talking noise.  I would love to drop Adder off into a veryu, 
very rough place, and have him describe to real hoodz what the term 
gangstah meant to him.  It would be like me going to Widowee, MS to 
explain my bi-racial son and present Caucasian girlfriend.  In other 
words, many aren't hearing it.

I try to be careful about people's feelings.  SOmething that has gone out 
of style.  Being PC is a very bad thing (next time LOOK at who says PC is 
a bad thing...) to many people.  To me such arguments are just arguments 
to be rude, impolite, and insensitive to others.  In the real world, 
such insensitivity can get you killed..  Or at least hurt.

I think we all should watch what we say.  I think we all should care 
about how our message is perceived.  I think we all should be sensitive 
to the likes and dislikes of others.  I think we all should try to avoid 
conflict where possible, but if it is not possible to agree to disagree, 
and strive to be respectful of each others boundaries.

Calling people names is not the answer.  For every gangstah, I will show 
you a good for nothing bridge-and-tunnel fuck.  For every nigger, a 
redneck chickshit whitebread motherfucker.  For every babe, betty, bitch, 
a stoopid hunk, dumb jock, plain dog.

When will we gorw up and stop the madness.  When can we start to realte 
to each other instead of labelling.  When will we ever celibrate the 
diversity of life, versus the current cultural war for everyone to be 
assimilated into one massive glob of, er "culture".

When will many of you, in your PLURist leanings an beliefs start to buck 
up when someone slams someone else for being different.  What is PLUR w/o 
practice and purpose.

Look, I have been to more parties than lany on this list.  I have partied 
for years and friggin years on end.  Parties were alot more fun back in 
the day when it was new, and relatively not part of the mass culture 
(which dance culture now is).  Parties used to have all kinds of 
motherfuckers in 'em.  Gay goyz w/o shirts, straight men chasing skirts, 
young girls on the move, other ladies cathchin' a groove, Gay women in 
effect, others didn't have lables yet, we all danced in fun, usually long 
after the setting sun.

Let's now get our headz out of the collective toilet.  There is no more 
room for bigotry or hatred here or anywhere else.  Stop the madness.

It starts with you.

Out & Audi from this name calling,

Ok, I've been sucked (or, er, suckered?) into this debate. 

What is wrong with Wyld 107?  What is wrong about the inevitable merging
with hip hop and dance (in which we call hi-energy).  This hoods, and
gansta stuff is really amusing, but at the same time disheartening.....
The sad truth is that we (i.e. people) DO look at face value, we DO
prejudge and make assumptions.  The difference is that some of us
realize this, and try to overcome.  Others just spout off, categorize,
and label.  Who's "Cool" and "Uncool"...  
I've ran with people who my "friends" disagree with, but the people I
run with @ that time are my "friends" as well.  I've hung with
skinheads, b-boys, rastas, and computer geeks.  Wandered the streets of
Haight one hour and "blunting" in EPA the next, dropping by Cupertino
and engaging in a net version of Marathon for 3 more hours, stopping by
@ Hayward kickin' it at an illegal "drag" and watching CRX's racing
against Nissans and ending up @ a rave by 12:15AM.   

Because I choose to associate with these kinds of people makes me
them... 
No.
Because I don't see people as skinheads, gangstas,nerds whatever...
I see them as people.
All I can do is hope that, "more people of the world can be like that."

So John, what you are saying is that the only people on this list
qualified to speak on the subject of "gangstahs" and not be racist are
yourself or Geoff?

In this thread, or all the recent discusssion about "ganstahs" who,
besides yourself has mentioned color in any of their comments?

No, what you are doing is attempting to silence a wide group of people by
accusing them of racism, where none exists.

Yes.

Does being jumped by 10 people displaying colors count? As far as their
attitudes displayed, I think the comments mentioned in Larry's survey
pretty much sum it up.

Odd, Larry's informal survey did not show this. Perhaps you are out of
touch with the context with which the term is used on this list.

I am ambivalant about the term, because it is not a racist term. *YOU*
have taken it as such.

So what's this about not bashing people for their whiteness?

You may label me a racist John, but who has made this a racial issue when 
their was never any mention of color? Who has made comments about a group
of people based on their color? 

Just you John, just you.

Dear SFRavefriends,

	I feel Lara's right that it's attitude, not clothing -- that's why
I try to avoid making negative judgements about people because of their
dress styles when I post. But at the same time, it needs to be said that
there can be a strong correlation between dress and behavior.  For
example, do you think a party is really going to go off if everyone has on
3-piece suits and cocktail dresses?
	I think the reason people often post about stuff like Adidas is
because this is something visible that they can point to.  Attitude and
vibe can be hard things to convey.  If someone just says that the vibe at
a party was bad, it's not as descriptive or informative as if they mention
what many people were wearing, especially if they think this contributed
to the negative energy, or that the dress style in question is frequently
associated with parties lacking vibe and that readers will understand
this.
	Admittedly it's a fine line between telling it like it is and
being needlessly judgemental and negative about other people yourself.
But I think it's useful to have as much info about an event as possible,
and if people dip into the realm of stereotyping from time to time, I
think nevertheless we can all differentiate between fact and opinion in
these posts and make up our minds for ourselves.

My computer tells me that on Sat, 1 Jun 1996, ess kay three shared:

I have been reading on this subject for a while and now I am pissed off.
 First off...ther e are some of us who have been partying for just as long
now and I am white but I don't care.  When you start saying white males...you
are categorizing...right?  Then why must you talk so much shit about
grouping....I am the least rascist person you will meet.   What I don't
understand is why is this all being called false..Don't people in terms group
themselves???Don't you remember high school?  Of course there is a reason for
everything but what I don't understand is why criticisize on the wrongdoings
of others when you jump in the boat yourself?

Scientists Stumble Onto Potential New Class of Drugs
           
 
            Researchers searching for a compound that could block the
            addictive effects of cocaine may have overturned an unwritten
            law of neurological drug design. For many years, scientists have
            assumed that drugs designed to target the brain have to contain
            nitrogen, because almost all molecules known to transmit
            signals between brain cells contain the element. Now
            neuroscientist Bertha Madras of Harvard Medical School in
            Boston and synthetic chemist Peter Meltzer of Organix Inc. in
            Woburn, Massachusetts, and their colleagues have found that
            compounds in which the traditional nitrogen is replaced with
            oxygen can bind to the same brain receptors as does
            cocaine--and the nitrogen-based prescription drugs Ritalin
            and Prozac, prescribed for hyperactivity and depression.

            The work, described in the December issue of Synapse, not only
            broadens the possibilities for finding new compounds effective
            in the brain, says Madras, but it may also help scientists better
            understand how neurotransmitters--the compounds that carry
            brain signals--bind to their targets. According to Ivy Caroll, a
            medicinal chemist at Research Triangle Institute in North
            Carolina, the finding suggests that combinatorial
            chemists--who assay thousands of compounds at once looking
            for useful drugs--should "take another look at
            non-nitrogen-containing compounds."

            Madras and Meltzer happened on their discovery while trying
            to design a compound that would bind to brain molecules called
            transporters, which absorb and recycle neurotransmitters like
            dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Cocaine binds tightly
            to the dopamine transporter, blocking the reuptake of dopamine
            and enhancing the signals it sends. A compound that bound
            more loosely, they thought, might prevent cocaine from
            blocking the transporter but still allow it to take up dopamine.
            And because the positive electric charge that nitrogen bears
            was thought to be crucial to tight binding, Madras and Meltzer
            decided to try oxygen-containing compounds. To their surprise,
            however, they found in test-tube experiments that some of
            their "nonamines" blocked the transporter even more strongly
            than did nitrogen-based counterparts.

            The finding means that the compounds won't help against
            cocaine addiction. But it may reveal a new mechanism by
            which compounds bind to neurotransmitter receptors, says
            Caroll. And it suggests, says Madras, that a whole realm of
            brain chemistry, including new classes of oxygen-containing
            neurotransmitters, may be awaiting discovery.

A Chink in the Brain's Defenses
            The blood-brain barrier, a bastion against harmful chemicals
            and microbes, may be a lot more permeable than researchers
            have thought. Scientists have found that in mice, at least, the
            barrier weakens during emotional stress.

            The blood-brain barrier is a layer of tightly packed endothelial
            cells and connective cells called astrocytes that strictly regulates
            the flow of chemicals in and out of the brain. Researchers at
            Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Israeli Defense Force's
            Medical Corps have found that a variety of chemicals penetrate
            the mouse blood-brain barrier much more readily when the
            mice are forced to tread water, a condition that induces stress.
            For instance, Evan's blue, a dye that stains the cellular protein
            albumin, penetrates the brain 10 times more efficiently in
            stressed mice than in unstressed mice. According to the report,
            in the December issue of Nature Medicine, increased blood flow
            in the stressed mice would account for only a fraction of the
            increase in permeability.

            "It's intriguing," says Rajesh Kalaria, a neurologist at Case
            Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Scientists have noted
            that the blood-brain barrier is weakened in some diseases such
            as epilepsy or in cases of dementia, he says, but the stress
            findings are novel.

            The study was spurred by findings in Gulf War veterans
            suggesting that they had suffered short-term neurological
            problems, such as insomnia and nervousness, after taking the
            anti-nerve-gas agent pyridostigmine. According to Hermona
            Soreq, the head of Hebrew University's Institute of Life
            Sciences and a study author, the mouse studies show that
            "Pyridostigmine penetrates the brain rather effectively under
            stress conditions." But Soreq says that the study was not aimed
            at probing the nature of Gulf War syndrome.

            The findings raise questions about the proper dosage of drugs
            that target the brain. "When you're under stress, drugs can
            have greater potency," says Kalaria. Stress, he says, "may
            compound the effect" of psychoactive drugs.

	Why am I getting involved in this?  I have no idea - probably bored
and work and maybe feeling quilty that I call some people gangsters...

	The post that started all of this (I don't know who wrote it)
>>> > fun at a party in a shitty space filled with a bunch of A***** wearing
>>> > gangstas :)

was just a joke (at least I think).  There is a :) at the end - people
cheer up, don't take stuff too seriously :P.

	So, here is a little background - I grew up in Croatia, where there
is only one race.  The very, very few non Caucasian people that are there
are African students (very rare), Asians are even smaller minority, and
basketball players that end up at Student Olympics :).  But we have
gangsters as well (maybe we just picked up a word and gave it a different
meaning) and none of them are black.  So, for me a word gangster has
nothing to do with race.  John, I feel bad that that's the way you feel
about it, because I know more people who are my friends who refer to
gangsters as Larry described it.  And most of those people are white :).

	So, my point is that the word is very relative, and it can have
different meanings to different people.  It is too bad that the word gets
some people upset (it has never, ever been my intention to classify it as a
racist word), while others use it as a description of somebody's style.
There are a lot of women that get upset when they are called girls or
chicks, and maybe because I am not an American (English is not my first
language) I use those words more than word women.  I don't feel like it has
any bad meaning in it, but sometimes some "women" look at me like I
shouldn't be saying that.  Sometimes I try to explain myself, but sometimes
there is no hope and I am classified and anti-feminist, should-be-a-male
blah, blah, blah...

	Maybe all of us should try to look at words (phrases etc.) from
different prospective and realize why people choose to use them, rather
than getting in flame wars.  Understanding each other is what will make us
grow stronger and become better people so why don't we give it a shot.  I
know I am willing to try.  Practising PLUR is a little bit more than just
signing the end of e-mail with it, and it seems to me that some people just
can't grasp that really well.

My 2 kuna's,

Hi all!  =)


 Just some more stuff; I've been involved in a lot of parties and the 
only time I had to throw anybody out of a party was when some gangsta's 
started a fight on the dance floor. They were really drunk and me and 
some other workers split them up. We were ready to let things slide but 
one of the more drunken ones (the one I was dealing with) just couldn't 
get it into his head to stop fighting. So I threw him and five of his 
buddy's out. (no fighting at my parties around my equipment!)

 I happily called these folks gangsta's for a couple of reason's. They 
called themselves a gang, acted as a group of thugs and all wore similar 
clothing (colours). They were also white.

There was a white label techno remix a couple months back of the
song where Enya is singing "Sail away" or something like that...

I am wondering.  Is this the group of people, one of which is a Dj that
spins at HiFi (Julius Papp)?
There all white, and they usually wear the same colors. (Desert storm
colors) They seem cool, although they don't seem to like me much when there
drunk..  =]:. ..

P.S.  RavErs.  Anyone looking for new insured SL-1200's with life time free
allignment, and life time advanced replacement insurance for a few spare
bucks.  The Good Guys in Hayward have them for alittle over five bills.
Great way to establish sum credit..

Getting to the word "Gangsta".....remember the old TV shows where you heard
the word gangster and thought of Bonnie and Clyde days, Al Caponne, tommy
guns and the Untouchables.

You take away the 'ER' and replace it with an "a" to get Gangsta. Which is
most commonly used in the term Gangsta Rap. Which is mostly sang by male
African-American.  So when people use the term "Gangsta" some may
automaticly think that African-Americans are having a finger being pointed
at them.

I think that by using the term "Gangsta", John is automaticly thinking that
people are talking about African-American's because of the labeling of what
I mentioned above. I'm just asumming these thoughts, sense I don't know
what John is thinking. These are all just thoughts, so don't take anything
personnal and if I'm wrong on these thought please let me know, I want to
understand why you are thinking the way you do.

John, please tell us how you would describe the type of people that some of
the people on the this are labeling as "Gangsta".

I would describe a "Gangsta" as...... A group of usually males, that hang
together looking all big and bad with an attidude to match. Usually has
some kind of weapon. Wearing the latest fashion to show that they may have
money and/or wear the same style of clothes in the group to show they have
the numbers and don't screw with them. They pick fights to usually show
they are big and bad and can kick anyones butt. By acting that way I guess
they think women will like them more. I could go on, but I think you get
the picture.

I didn't describe a race because I've seen many groups of people like I
mentioned that were of different races. There is no one race that fits
under that description.  There can be one person from every single race in
that group and I'd consider everyone of the a Gangsta.

Maybe if we knew what your definition of these type of people are, we can
all come to an understanding of how you feel.

I hope I can speak for most if not all the people here when I say that.
When people on this list use the term Gangsta, there not refering to
anything specific, there refering to the type of people I mentioned before.
A group of people, acting and behaving in a ruthless way to get what they
want by any means. Wearing the latest fasion or the same style of clothes
to be seperated and notice by others as people not to miss with. Big, bad
bully gun and knife carrying thugs that want to start sh%t to make them
look cool.



I hope this made sense and I didn't offend anyone. Like a always say, I
think faster then I type and sometimes it comes out wrong, but I think I
made myself clear. I hope.

Cool World Productions are exactly the type of big, "clearcutting" parties
that caused the scene to implode in late 92 and early 93. Exactly. It's all
about a really big party with the *sole* purpose of making $$$ over
creating a vibe or anything else that the scene is about.

If there are too many Cool World type parties, the scene will once again
implode, leaving a fragmented and disillusioned community to pick up the
pieces, once again. If that happens, how may years will it take for another
recovery?

Remember, if the scene implodes, it doesn't just mean the end of the big
parties. It means that the electornic music movement will once again be set
back, there will be less enthusiasm for buying music, gear, throwing
parties, etc. on all levels. That means that your favorite budding artists,
labels, stores, etc. could perish due to an industry-wide (community-wide)
backlash for "this crappy rave culture" once again.

But Cool World and their uncaring, exploitive fucked up ilk would have made
their buck, so it's obvoiusly good for them. I praise them on their
entreprenurial efforts, but it definitely shows they are about PROMOTING
their party to MAKE MONEY, and little else.

To prove my point that we're alreay heading down the slippery slope to a
recap of 1993's over-hyped and over-marketed large crappy scene destroying
party oblivion, I have but one word:

	"UBIQUITOUS"

I think we all just need to step back for a second, and stop jumping down each 
others throats.  I'm sure everyone else on this list does not appreciate the 
animosities that keep cropping up here.  We need to remember to take 
statements with a grain of salt.  People on this list come from many, many 
different backgrounds, and it is hardly fair to expect everyone else around 
you to have come to the same conclusions.  Let's all remember why we gather as 
a collective like this.  It's not just the music.  We all have mixes at home.  
It's the company that brings us together.  Recognize and celebrate our 
differences, and then realize how trivial they are. 
 
PLUR.

Hi everyone,

Thankyou to all who responded to my sober raving post.  I am taking it all into 
consideration and trying to figure out what I'll try first.  I figure eating, 
taking everything at the same time would not be the most wonderful idea.

and, to everyone who wished me luck at my FIDM (Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising) interview, thank you, I did get accepted and will start in July!!

Hawaii Court: Lesbian & Gay Couples Should Be Allowed To Marry

Lambda Wins Historic Ruling Against Discrimination in Civil Marriage Law

(HONOLULU & NEW YORK, December 3, 1996)   For the first time in U.S. history
a state court ruled Tuesday that civil marriage law cannot discriminate
against lesbian and gay couples. A Hawaii court ruled in the case brought by
Honolulu civil rights lawyer Dan Foley and Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund on behalf of three lesbian and gay couples.

"This is a historic moment for lesbians and gay men," said Lambda Marriage
Project Director Evan Wolfson, who with Foley is co-counsel in the case,
Baehr v. Miike, tried in Honolulu this fall.  "When required at our trial to
justify its discriminatory marriage law, the government couldn't do it.  The
court today agreed that there is no compelling or logical reason for
discriminating against lesbian and gay couples," Wolfson said.

Speaking from Lambda's New York headquarters, Wolfson said, "This case made a
major breakthrough toward ending second-class status for gay families. This
decision marks the beginning of the end to sex discrimination in marriage."

Lambda is spearheading a national movement to end sex discrimination in civil
marriage, and to protect lesbian and gay families.

>From Honolulu, Foley, who litigated Baehr v. Miike from its earliest stages,
said, "Judge Kevin Chang made the only decision that he could, given the
evidence in this case.  This decision is not only historic, but of vital
personal consequence to the couples who want to get married."

Foley added, "Now that the court has ruled, the state should immediately
issue civil marriage licenses to the couples in this case."

Foley, through the Hawaii Equal Rights Marriage Project, and Wolfson
presented the case for two lesbian couples and one gay male couple seeking
civil marriage licenses in Hawaii.

The three couples, Ninia Baehr and Genora Dancel, Pat Lagon and Joseph
Melillo, and Antoinette Pregil and Tammy Rodrigues were denied marriage
licenses by the state Department of Health in late 1990.  In 1991, they
jointly filed a lawsuit alleging the denial was unconstitutional and
eventually the case was appealed to the Hawaii Supreme Court.

In 1993, the state Supreme Court ruled that, under Hawaii's Constitution,
allowing civil marriage licenses only for opposite-sex couples and not for
same-sex couples is sex discrimination.  The court ordered the state to show
what "compelling" interest justifies such discrimination in civil marriage.

Judge Chang of the First Circuit Court of Hawaii heard the case at a
nine-day, bench trial, September 10-20.  Deputy state Attorney General Rich
Eichor argued on behalf of Director Lawrence Miike of the state Department of
Health, which has jurisdiction over marriage licenses.

Lambda Executive Director Kevin Cathcart said, "This victory is important
progress for the civil rights of lesbians and  men in Hawaii and throughout
the country.  Just as the legal protections and recognition that come with
civil marriage should be available to everyone regardless of race, religion,
and ethnicity, they should be available to everyone regardless of sex or
sexual orientation."

Cathcart added, "Just a generation ago, for example, courts ended state
discrimination against marriages between people of different races. Today's
ruling takes a similar step toward ending state discrimination against the
marriages of lesbian and gay couples."

Two of the plaintiffs in the landmark case, Ninia Baehr and Genora Dancel,
who now live in Baltimore, quickly stated their exuberance with the ruling.
 "Many people around the country helped break through this wall of
discrimination.  While we face much more work ahead to secure this right
nationally, Ninia and I are deeply honored to be part of today's victory,"
Dancel said.

"Our love made it possible for me and Genora to get through this long legal
fight," Baehr said.  "I'm looking forward to our love getting us to our
wedding on a mountain slope in Maui," she said.

Lambda Legal Director Beatrice Dohrn said.  "Without civil marriage, gay
couples often face painful, difficult situations, like being barred from the
hospital bedside of a partner in a medical emergency. Lesbian and gay couples
have had no access to the legal, economic, and practical protections of civil
marriage that non-gay couples can take for granted."

Other protections withheld from gay couples include access to family health
coverage, immigration, divorce, and inheritance rights.  Lesbians and gay men
also are denied protection for their children and may lose custody when their
partner dies.

Dohrn said, "Our society is structured so that hundreds of legal obligations
and protections are available only through civil marriage.  It's time the law
stopped saying  no' to those who want and need to say  I do.'  The choice of
whether or not two people get married belongs to the couple, not the state."

The prospect of ending marriage discrimination against same-sex couples has
fueled recent backlash campaigns by the religious right to promote state and
federal anti-marriage legislation like the federal Defense of Marriage Act,
Wolfson said.

He noted that DOMA does not ban marriages for gay couples but would
discriminate against legally married gay couples by allowing  federal
protections and benefits only for heterosexual married couples.

Wolfson said, "The absurdly named  Defense of Marriage' Act, like the 16
state bills passed against equal marriage rights for lesbians and gay men, is
unconstitutional and will be defeated.  State by state, court by court, we
will put an end to this illogical and cruel discrimination."

Lambda is the oldest and largest legal organization dedicated to the civil
rights of lesbians, gay men, and people with AIDS and HIV.

I don't know if this is very useful--I may just be lucky to have the right
sort of metabolism or something--but I can't help but repeat a certain
well-worn bit of advice: Just do it!  (See, sportswear *does* have
something to do with raving.)  If you're starting to fade, you can slow
down, relax a little, but focus on the music and keep moving and you *can*
break through to a second wind that will easily keep you going til morning.
Once that first hump is past, in fact, a lot of times I actually can't
sleep without a couple of hours to wind down.  Not to boast--well, ok, a
little bit to boast, but mostly just to show it can be done--but I've gone
out, raving and otherwise, for literally days at a time, stimulant-free.
Back in May there was one weekend...Friday night was Dreamtime down in
Soquel, back home in the morning to pick up supplies and a bite, then
duelling soundsystems at Panther beach all afternoon, dinner in SF then
over the bridge to Funky Tekno Tribe, Sunday hanging around Berkeley
checking out records til it's time for Sunset down at the Marina, then
finally back to SF for Spundae's Memorial Day special at 1015.  And then
there was the time I drove straight from here to New Hampshire...well,
anyway, with some effort and practice I really think you can develop your
natural stamina.  And you should give it a try...you know those cycling
bumper stickers that say "a better kind of high" and the sort of stuff you
hear about endurance athletes and endorphins and runner's high and so on?
Well, there's a lot of sanctimonious BS involved, but at root it's true:
prolonged physical exertion will get you high.  It's a lot subtler than,
say, tripping, but very real--your pupils will dilate, objects will take on
that preternatural glow and intense presence in your vision, there's
lightness, tingling, acute awareness of the body, spacy thinking.  Sleep
deprivation helps here, too.  But be careful!  You might try it and...get
HOOKED!  You could find yourself (shudder) RAVING SOBER.  Maybe we need
some public service announcements on this.

Anyway, besides all that, Geoff's remarks about eating right are good
advice--eating well but not too heavily is essential.  I hadn't thought
about the veggie connection before, but while I'm not strict about it (I
try to avoid strictness in anything, as a rule), I eat very little meat,
particularly when going out.  Carbohydrates--rice, cereal, bread--are key.
If I think of it, I sometimes take a general multivitamin beforehand.
Helps me feel prepared, if nothing else.

And if nothing seems to work, there's no rule that says you can't nap at a
party.  I've done that...the noise and otherwise less-than-ideal conditions
available usually make it difficult to sleep deeply no matter how tired I
am, but that's good--keeps me from dropping off until the guy with the
broom has to get me up.  The trick of telling yourself when you'll wake up
works better for me with the light, short sleep of a party than at home in
bed, too.  Even just dozing, half-awake, for thirty minutes or so can be
refreshing.

I feel bad when someone wants water and doesn't have the money to buy it
because raves are WAAAAAAAAAAy to expensive at the present moment. And
alos is water for that matter! I can buy 3 bottles at Safeway for the
price of one at  a rave. Whats with this bullcrap. But thats now what i
am here to say. I am saying that I had a cold this weekend at Be Here
Now/Tribal Funk (Vibeless rave at stupid Home Base) and i didn't ask for
water from anyone. I didn't have any money either. So i got like one
bottle of water for the whole night. Also, I rarely E so i was fine. I
told anyone who wanted water that I had a cold and they could have some
if they wanted, but at least I warned them. Most people at raves still
have the cold from the last rave and let people have their water without
warning them and they come home with 5 differnet colds, then you can't go
to school the next day cuz your sick and you miss school and you get
abscences and you parents yell at you and say why are you sick. 
If you have a cold, please don't drink other people's waters, and if they
want yours tell them your sick before they drink it. 
I guess the whole thing of everyone getting everyone else's cold promotes
the whole thing about Unity though. Everyone has evryone's cold. Sort of
Ironic in a way.

Okay man think about wha your saying, is Wild 107 related more to clubs?
or raves? Aha! I see Raves, your right. Are we ravers or clubbers, which
means at a rave you hear music that is rave type music.

Hip Hop Doesn't belong at a rave budy! Neither does Angelina and
Roughneck!
Who wants to hear, "I don' need you love love, I dont need your love no
more!"
and how about "Everybody wants to be somebody, everybody wants to be
somebody, everybody, who you gonna be, don't you wanna be somebody!"

Thats at  a CLUB. A CLUB. We go to RAVES. We would like to hear RAVE
MUSIC!
Such as
Deep, Acid, Proggressive, House
Jungle (sometimes)
Trance, Tribal, Industrial.
etc.

No one at a rave likes Proggressive Techno.

The day Carlos spins Angelina or Buffy is the day I stop raving.

And all that stuff about cool world, any RAVER( empahsise on RAVER part)
thats been to a Cool World,  (cyber fest, palnet new year, mega
buzz((actually was a cool world party)), and any other future cool world)
can you tell that its not a rave, its a PARTY
For PARTY People.

Raving is not a sexual experience.

Raving is a PLUR experience.

It may be hard to understand, but try to get it.

And there is nothing wrong with 107 or rap or hip hop. I listen to it
sometimes to.
But not at a RAVE.
That music belong at The Edge or Hollywodd Junction or maybe City Nights.

PLUR,
Paul

That space can suck, but all of my friends and I that went to the FTT Haloween massiv there had an awesome time. If they use all the rooms they had then, that place is absolutely huge.You want a bust-free event with great DJ's - there's not many locations that I've been to North or South that can match it. People in LA have to drive 100 minutes or more to San Bernadino to get a location half as good. I was a little leary of the infamous "gangster element" but saw no problems at all. Give it a break-the latino element is far more pronounced in LA and it's rarely a big deal either place.

I think the term "Gangsta" is African-American idenitified because it
comes out of African-American street venacular-the replacing of 'er' at
the ends of words with vowell.  I would also argue that lots of people
who use the word even when they are referring to 'gangstas' of other
races are implying a wanna-be black connotation to youth of that
subculture.   Maybe i am misperceiving people's use of that word but
that seems to me to be the implication in alot of the cases.
It is a loaded word for a lot of the behavior atrributed to youth who act
in this manner I think is attributed as having been derived from ghetto
culture.  As a person of mixed race who is black, white, and latino, i get
a lot that I am not "black" becuse I do not talk street and go to Stanford
and am not from the ghetto-funny since my family fought for civil rights
in the political arena as media-labeled "black politicians" though they
were really mixed.  Nowadays, I think racism and class issues are becoming
closer as certain behavior and subcultures (as in some cases before)
become racially identified.

For example, raving is considered by many people I know to be a
white-middle class phenomenom coming out of the white-middle
class phenomenom of the hippy in the 60's.  Bored kids with enough money
to spend on drugs and with enough societal safety nets to drop out for a
while.  Another example of a media construction but a construction as with
gangsta that all need to be aware of when communicating thought.

 I just
thought I would throw that thought out
there since Tim's point of need for definition is a valid one.

Anyone know where the best places to buy professional DJ equipment in San
Francisco
are?  I know of Zebra records (has some), but beyond that I've been unable
to find any
great stores with say Intimidation stuff, etc.  If not in the city, the Bay
Area or US mail order.

I'm about to go the UK mail-order route, but find it implausible that no
major DJ Equipment
suppliers/stores exist here in San Francisco....let alone Mail-order US
shops.....the UK Dance
mags are full of stores and the like, but none of the US mags seem to even
feature ads for Mail
order companies.... :-(

Anyone have any hints for the UK mail-order route if I end-up down that path?

Thanx,

Form what I have seen, from what I have heard, from what I know:

A ganster is:
-Someone who participates in illegal activity for profit power.
-People who band together to do the above (i.e. a group).
-A group of people, usually underprivildged, who join together to 
protect or enhance thier standing in their community by forming 
protective collectives, or gangs, to achieve such goals.
-groups of people wh have a set of laws and a way of existence that 
attempts to do the aforementioned.
-A group of pople who care little about life, liberty and the pursuit of 
anything other than their own defnination of happiness and pushing up.
-living the life of felony to get by in an organized group of people.
-More a matter of the colors one wears than a fashion sense (adidas is 
only one attribute SOME gangs have taken on...geez people).
-What many on this list have yet to see, and live about it to tell.  I am 
ONE very lucky individual indeed.

Now, can someone please tell me if they've seen a ganstah at a rave?

Here's another clue:

Gangnstah don't pay to get into shit.  They would just as well bum rush 
than pay.  Just as well gank than pay.  Just as well bust your jaw, face, 
teeth before you could take your eyes off of them.

Gangstahs ain't, i'm sorry, are not, living double lives.  They live the 
way they act.

So, please, someone tell me, have you seen a ganstah, ganster, gangsta at 
a rave?  And how did you know?

Now if you're talking bad attitude, then shit, I am a gangstah too.  When 
some silly ass nipple-neck jerkie comes up to me with a dumb-ass smile 
and tell me to "Hey man, S-M-I-L-E!", whilst his eyes are bulging out of 
his gourd, then the gangstah might come out of me and I might jump out of 
my trance and give the dirty look.  Is that it?  Or is it when I decide 
to wear my Adidias wear and stay behind the DJ booth, arms crossed, and a 
serious look on my face, or am I just listening and watching one of the 
masters rip shit up at the party?  Could it just be I decided to dress 
younger than I normally do, starter jacket and all, and just happen to 
not hug anyone, or kiss, or smile, I just came tohear music, and just 
happen to be one of the stand-offish shy, reposed black men who RARELY go 
out to these hoe-downs.  Or could it be that I'm a gangstah;
"Hey everyone, I went to this party the other night, and I accidentally 
stepped on this guys shoes.  He was all decked out in the gangstah look 
and vibed me really hard.  I wish people would leave their negative 
'tudes at the door.  especially the gangstahs.  WHy do they come to our 
party anyway?"

My reply is usually "Why did your clumsy ass step on my feet?"

What if broham had a bad toe, or maybe you were the umpteenth hucklebuck 
to do so, and your number was up.  Maybe homes got tired of getting his 
shit stepped on and don't wanna be your buddy.  Maybe homey came with his 
friends, and you ravers, or at least a small number of you, kept hitting 
on his girl, or the girls with him.  Maybe homes is checkin shit out for 
the first time, just took a hit of this white shit, and is waiting for 
something/nothing to happen.  Maybe he was just getting there when your 
smiling, stumbling, drooling shake-a-booty wanted to commune with him.  
Maybe homes wasn't down for that.  Maybe people just want to be left 
alone. 

Maybe next time you see him out, you say hello before you get all 
stoopid, lovey slap-happy.  Maybe you might want to give him a quick 
shout and say "Hey man, saw you last time.  Did you have a good time?" 
say later then jet.  Maybe some people take a long time to know.

Maybe gangstah ain't the word for people you hardly know.  Maybe we might 
want to stick to a more accurate description.  Why?  Becuase...gangsters 
don't go to raves.

That's why...

Words can be like a sword.  Often it is she that weilds them that gives 
it the true power.

That's why I can say some things you cannot.  That is why others can say 
things that are verboten from my lips.  In the end, it is about respect, 
and consideration of others.  That's what I'm all about.

Anyway, time to lock and load.  There is new years coming up.  I have 
already decided to go the limit.  One of my new years resolutions is to 
vibe anyone who might step on my new adidas.  If anyone, and I don;t care 
if your name IS Neils Mayer or Jack Diamond, anyone dares step on my 
shoes I'm a stomp a fuckin' mudhole in your ass...bitch!

"And if you step on mine It'll push the button, and I'll beat you down 
like it ain't nothin'!" US, Ice Cube, Death Certificate

Peace out all...really.  And don't worry, I won't stomp ya...as long as 
you don't diss my sneaks. ;)

Peace out,
John

many ;)'s

Hi Jeff!  =)

 ummmm, I don't know. I don't know where HiFi is and I'm not familiar 
with the Julius Papp crowd. The guys I mentioned were wearing all white.

John,
 
A gangstah is a ordinary person, any color at all.  You might not even
know it's a ganstah until he is in 6th or 7th grade.  Then differences
appear.  He is not interested in history or science in school, does not
do well in math class.  Hates many of the teachers; they respond in
kind.  In 9th grade, he finds he can fight well, really kick others kids
ass; makes him feel great.  He can't name 3 branches of government, or
show you were he lives on a map, but he can really bloody a kids nose.

By 11th grade, he has had several major run ins with police.  He hates
'pigs', funny, they seem to hate him too.  He hangs with others like
himself.  They all hate school, they hate college (and knowledge too).
By 12th grade, his future is all but sealed.  Zero possibility of UC
Berkley.  He drops out of school in frustration.

The primary mission of a gangstah is to fight.  They divide the city
they live in up into what they call 'turf'. ( I don't know how, I
suppose by Zip code, or phone exchange.)  Then the classic behavior sets
in.  There Zip code must be defended from kids who live in other Zip
codes.  I know it sounds stupid; but it is a VERY serious issue to them.
 The will kill or die in defending there Zip code.  Don't believe me ?
Check the TV news; check the Cron or SJ Merc.  That is EXACTLY what
happens.  Over and over.  Some guy from another Zip code (or whatever
boundaries they have agreed upon) sitting in THERE park; that is reason
to shoot somebody.

All classes of people want to be identified and grouped together.
Business men look like they are business men, a Catholic priest looks
like a priest, a cop wears his uniform, hippies (in order to show they
are all different) all dress the same, ravers, military men, Caltrans,
and everybody else.  You dress to show what kind of person you are;
where you 'fit in'.  On board a US Navy vessel; a US flag is flown.
This is called the 'colors'.  Displaying them is called showing your
colors.  It's not the flag that counts; or power business suite.  It's
what it stands for.  Everybody knows everybody else's colors; what good
would it do to fly colors if others did not know what they mean.  This
is common sense; and we all know and use it.  

You find a place to park on Mission St., get out of your car; its 22:00,
your parked 3/4 block from the place your going.  On one side of the
street appears a bunch of bikers getting out of there bar; on the other;
a number of ravers are gathering.  What side of the street do you walk
down to get to where you are going?  You read the colors of both camps
and conclude a much lower probability of engagement with ravers then
bikers and proceed.  You grouped; catorgized people, then acted on it. 

The ganstah are not interested in superposition or wave theory; they
don't care about the first 1 X 10 -20 Seconds after the big bang.  They
only know how to hurt people. They will never invent anything; solve any
world problems; or make the world a better place.  They will just cost
you money; as eventually they will go to jail.

But skin color; nope, that has nothing to do with it John.

FWT

I was given this idea while in Tahoe a few weekends ago.

Would anyone like to contribute to an e-book of tobacco smoking aperati?  
I've seen all kinds of beautiful pieces, and would love to showcase a 
collection online, especially homemade or customized items.

Anyone interested?  If so, send me a picture of your favorite item along 
with a brief description or anecdote.  Identities will be kept 
confidential.  Other thoughts?

peace

deeje

Okay this guys is the best example of the worst vibe in the world Read
this.

>Now, can someone please tell me if they've seen a ganstah at a rave?
Just about every single one at the Home base Warehouse. Usually, when
they have a tatoo that says "XIV" it means that they are affiliated with
the Home Brothers on the Eastern Portion of our city. Or When someone
makes a W letter with their fingers it is an indication that, the want
water?, no that they are down for the west side.

>Gangnstah don't pay to get into shit.  They would just as well bum 
>rush 
>than pay.  Just as well gank than pay.  Just as well bust your jaw, 
>face, 
>teeth before you could take your eyes off of them.

Well they payed for all the raves I have seen them at because the rent a
cops had bigger guns than they did and because a police car was there.
They are gangsters not stupid, they are not going to comit a felony in
front of so many cops.

>So, please, someone tell me, have you seen a ganstah, ganster, gangsta 
>at 
>a rave?  And how did you know?

I knew from his tatoos, the way he acted towards others, also because he
was wearing a red bandana.

>Now if you're talking bad attitude, then shit, I am a gangstah too.  
>When 
>some silly ass nipple-neck jerkie comes up to me with a dumb-ass smile 
>
>and tell me to "Hey man, S-M-I-L-E!", whilst his eyes are bulging out 
>of 
>his gourd, then the gangstah might come out of me and I might jump out 
>of 
>my trance and give the dirty look.  Is that it? 

No that could be anybody at a rave. That is a bad vibe, Most gangsters
fall into that catagorey, because, like most ravers, they never heard of
PLUR.

>Or is it when I 
>decide 
>to wear my Adidias wear and stay behind the DJ booth, arms crossed, 
>and a 
>serious look on my face, or am I just listening and watching one of 
>the

I wear adidas that doesn't mean shit! Who cares what you wear to a rave.
Maybe your tired from killing all those people during the week. Thats why
your arms are crossed.

THIS IS WHAT HE SAIDS ABOUT RAVERS
>"Hey everyone, I went to this party the other night, and I 
>accidentally 
>stepped on this guys shoes.  He was all decked out in the gangstah 
>look 
>and vibed me really hard.  I wish people would leave their negative

>My reply is usually "Why did your clumsy ass step on my feet?"

Thats because there are too many people to look where your going. And if
you waited a while the RAVER might turn around and say SORRY! What a
concept. Why would he say sorry? Because he knows what PLUR is. He might
even let you have a sticker or a hug or buy you water.

>What if broham had a bad toe, or maybe you were the umpteenth 
>hucklebuck 
>to do so, and your number was up.  Maybe homes got tired of getting 
>his 
>shit stepped on and don't wanna be your buddy.  Maybe homey came with 
>his 
>friends, 

Well, then he shouldn't go to a RAVE if he cant accept that. Better yet
maybe he shouldn't wear his best shoes to a rave!

>and you ravers, or at least a small number of you, kept 
>hitting 
>on his girl, or the girls with him.  

This is really stupid, because NO RAVER ever, ever hits on any girl/guy
at a rave, ever!
If a girl/guy hits on a RAVER, he will usually say no thankyou. He/she
doesn't like Homie girls/guys. He/She likes Ravers!

> Maybe we 
>might 
>want to stick to a more accurate description.  Why?  
>Becuase...gangsters

>
>That's why...

Yes they do. Maybe should look around at a rave if you have ever been to
one and count the ammount of gangster homie OGs there are.

>like it ain't nothin'!" US, Ice Cube, Death Certificate

Perfect example that he doesn't belong at a rave, because he doesn't know
what PLUR is.

I feel sorry for this guy. I can't help him at all. I don't know why he
is like this. maybe his mom beats him with a vaccum cleaner handle. Its
too bad for him.

Hi all,
  
I thought I'd jump into this thread after reading Wayne's post.  After 
some thinging I agree with Wayne here. I've been around for almost 4 
years in the scene and now can say I've seen ups and downs in this 
culture.  I can't compare what I know to the earlier days well because 
raves were so underground (from were I came from) I didn't even know 
about em'.  Shit my first party was Freedom -on the way to a ski trip and 
I saw lasers in the hills,  Went to investigate and here I am now-.  
 
  As far as I know the first party by coolworld prod was Cyberfest in 
93.  This is also Feel Good right.  I never went to a Feel good party 
because I trusted my instincts to not go.  After a few big parties I 
noticed an increase in big parties and also an increase of new faces year 
after year.  This is probably a result of the increased popularity in 
this 'alternative' culture.  Alternative to clubs, alternative to bars, 
aternative to concerts, alternative to the norm.  
   
   I found our scene through the love of music and the introduction of 
new people, races, and generations.  The unity formed by all these people 
celebrating dance, music and love drew me in and changed my outlook on 
life in many ways.  i'm grateful for the exploration of mind and culture 
I've done in these years.  Because of this I have come to a point where I 
get disappointed with crews who use this culture, and capitalize on it 
for their own benifit. Even more so, with out conributing to the scene
positively.  

    Many crews have brought positive vibes, new music, new people, and 
a higher understanding of self and society.  i don't see this in Feel 
Good and/or Cool world.

   I don't go to CW becuse I haven't any good stories about their 
parties.  I haven't heard about goodtimes had at their parties and the 
notion of getting lost in 10,000 people who don't celebrate this unity 
with each other doesn't appeal to me. 
 
   I have a big problem with FGE and CW promotion.  I bleive for the good 
of our community and the scene that raves sould stay underground.  It 
would be great if the whole world would "get it" but it won't happen in 
my lifetime.  CW promotes on the radio, at malls, shopping centers, 
schools, and anywhere to get mass people to come to their parties.  They 
promote that they are "Northern California's leading dance organization - 
5 years strong"  Sorry but everyone on this list knows this is false.  
And five years?  Cyberfest was in 93 which makes that 3 years and 1 party 
a year doesn't make you experienced or the best.

   They promote sex at their parties.  "Plus you never know you just 
might get abducted or better yet have a sexual encounter with a colorful 
alien!  Don't worry they do practice safe sex."  Ummm did someone mention 
rape.   On their flyer they don't promote drug use but they have a bar!  

    Don't forget they will be filming this event for future broadcast and 
it will be broadcast live on the internet.  Plus there is a fax number so 
the press can get a press pass.  What is this shit.  i certainly don't 
want my face plastered all over HardCopy or the SanFran Cronical the next 
morning when they print howmany Od's occured over the night.  Remember 
the last CoolWorld in Oaktown!

   I think Ray Vonnie of Fell Good is on this list but I haven't heard 
from him about this topic.  Or maybe he just subs to promote his 
"underground" parties (Spirit) and then logs off when he's finished with 
the plug.   I know there are many of you out there who dj, promote, 
contribute, and throw parties and just participate in our scene by 
spreading the positive vibe.  Those of you I love.  You are true to the 
scene.  

    You will not find me at coolworld or Feel Good (Unless I decide to 
find out for my own experience what I've been hearing is true.  And of 
course this will never happen unless I can get in for free.).  I hope 
those that go have a good time but remember Cloud Factory is also 
throwing a party, and so is Origin.  What about  F&F? (I would love to 
get to another one!)

Keep it Real!
Keep it Underground!


PLUR,

       Austin

Oh John! you just need a hug!  But you've gotta get rid of those
spoo-covered-worn-out-odor-eater-so-dookie-smellin-the-dog-won't-even-sniff-em
addidas sneaks.

Have a nice day! Take it easy! Peace! Today is the first day of the
rest of your life! And remember, love means never having to wear your sari!

Hello all u beautiful ppl.

I just have one small question for all of u.
Why is everyone, i'm sure i'm included, so damn petty on here?

When i first subscribed i was excited about this list the people and topics on here 
seemed soooo cool.  I finally had a place to talk to people about two of the things 
that i love most in this world: raves and music.  But, it seems, the longer i'm on 
here and the more i read ppl's posts the more i realize that ppl NEED to relax in 
this world.  Let ppl be, and if u must have a flame with someone, PLEASE send it 
to them privately.  I'm not trying to police the list, but some of this has gotten to me 
and made me sad about the list.  Obviously these are just my opinions, but i 
really felt like i needed to share them with everyone.

I still like the list and read about half of what's on here (down from like 90%).  I 
would just like to see it as a happier and more unified entity.  And i don't mean 
that everyone has to agree on everything to be unified.  I just think we should all 
respect each other a little more.  After all it's a BIG, CRUEL world out there and 
we should stick together.

Sorry.....i didn't mean for this to get philosophical.

Well........i'm pretty sure that was my $.02 for a while.

Thank u for listening,
Micron

Some of these are in poor taste.   I was personally was amused by items
2 and 6.  The list has been rather slow with mail today anyway, and I am
too busy at work to contribute something that is actually thought

I usually only share water with people that i know.  I bring in my own 
bottle and fill up from whatever taps are around.  I know this isn't 
foolproof, but it saves me money, and i usually know which one of my 
friends is ill :)

I used to share water indiscriminately, but being sick all the time made 
me feel that it was all right to be selfish on these occasions.  Besides, 
REAL ravers take care of their own water ;)

I have to dissagree with you Mattew; beacause, I agree 100% with MHg. I 
too get really pissed when people compare ravers to phish fans. I find it 
very insulting. I have a whole lot more in common with a bunch of trendy, 
addias wearing kids then I'll ever have with a bunch of unwashed 
PU-chewly reeking crab ranchers. What do we have in common anyway? Many 
people in both groups do drugs: so what? The whole country is on drugs. 

Sheesh all MHg asked for was a little NRR where needed. A perfectly valid 
request.

Speaking of kill files phish is definitley in mine. Gawd I love Claris 
Emailer. I think it's still free at: 
ftp://ftp.claris.com/pub/USA-Macintosh/x.Shareware-Freeware/Emailer_Seeding
/

Not only does Claris Emailer let me make kill files, it also puts all sfr 
stuff in it's own folder. Eudora Pro will do this as well, but it costs 
money. Oh yeah that address is for the MacOS version, I've no idea if 
Claris Emailer comes in any other version.

ps to MHg: please keep throwing monkey wrenches in the works; this list 
can get to be a bit of a sheep farm at times.

Wow!  I'm totally into learning about "drug-neuroscience," (for lack of a
better term), and although I really haven't been looking all that hard
(and I don't know all that much outside of what they tell me in school), I
haven't found any good *current* drug-related articles in the popular
media that are actually concerned with physical or chemical bases of
interaxn, besides the classic psychological "These are the symptoms...this
is what case studies say it's like" rhetoric.  I've always assumed that
this is because research has been slim on these things, since the drugs
involved are "illegal."  I can't imagine that it would be because the
scientific community as a whole doesn't care.  But then again, if the drug
in question were, say, illegal, physiologically nonaddictive, and
relatively harmless for the most part, there's no money in researching it,
is there?
(*sigh*; Yet again, our quest for knowledge is based on greed for wealth,
rather than the betterment of humanity.)

Anyways, the magazine, you say, is Synapse? Where can I find it?  BTW, I
would consider the article to be rave-related.  If users do ingest
psychoactives (such as E, acid, etc.), or any other drug as a
regular part of the scene, is that not justification enough to explore it
in a  rave-based newsgroup?  I would think that a lot of users would want
to know more about what they are putting into their bodies.  (I know
I would!)  Well, that's my .02, thanx for sharing, Jay!

Hey Everyone!

After digging around this town, we finally found a spot for Audio Impact.
Kinda last minute I know, but when your renegade, beggers can't be choosers!  :)

Due to the short notice, we can only do 21+  this time around. Sorry, but it
was the best we could do. Brace yourself for the 18th. We'll be getting some
guests in, do 18+ again, with a much better location!

Tomorrow, Wed. Dec 4th, 
9p - 2a
$5

Sound Specialists include:

Shoam
Hannibal Selector
Tomas
UFO

...at the VooDoo Lounge (y'know, where Headquarters is!), 601 Eddy between
Polk & Larkin, SF

Call the BASS Kru voice mail for more info:  415.332.5800 ext. 247

Got a lot to say about the state of events regarding spaces in this town
(fuckin' hell!!!). Perhaps when things slow down a bit, I'll chew your ear
off.  ;)

If there are any problems with the management, please let us know so we can
go step on their throats!

later...

Jonas J.

I just wanted to tahnk marc for the letter.  I think this 15 year old person has a 
deeper understanding than a lot of people.  While i agree that some of the views 
are simplistic, i definitely think that he is on the right track.

I wasn't sure I was going to get involved in this BULL SHIT about 
CoolWorld and all the absolutely ignorant posts.....BUT, austin draged 
me into it.   with his last post about me onlu subing to promote my 
events....Ha....Just to let you know ,  Im listening, and I have been 
around for Close to S E V E N (7) years, and I have seen and heard 
everything, More than once.  And once again here I am feeling like 
people just DON"T GET IT!!!!!

So let me try once again to shed some light on this matter so that 
everyone can have a clear understanding of what is going on.

The first thing is this:   FEEL GOOD ENTERTAINMENT  IS NOT  THE SAME AS 
COOL WORLD.    GET IT STRAIT.   This is the botom line and it is final. 
Anyone that wants to generalize and steriotype is doing just that,  And 
we all know what an ignorant act that is.

Secondly.  I see a problem arising from the rave sceen, Or atleast the 
people who consider themselves the "core" ravers, or whatever.  You are 
all geting old and are to stubern to accept the envitable change that 
takes place in everything in live.  Evolution is the foundation of our 
existance.  Nothing ever stays the same, and everything will always 
change.  get a grip on reality, and flow with it.  Enjoy the things 
while they last, and cherish the memory.
 
If you don't have anything nice to say, just don't say anything.  
Especialy when it comes to things that you do not agree with.

I have been around for a real long time.  I was one of the promoters 
that established Cool World.  I have nothing but pride in all things 
that I have come in contact with.  Feel Good Ent is my company, we have 
been around longer than CW, and we have worked with CW on all their 
events.  

For anyone who cares to know the truth about CW and what they are all 
about, Here it is:

It is all about bringing people together.  

CW is a multicultural music and dance festival production company.

CW believes that people are brought together by music.  It is not 
solely a rave production organization.  CW produces events, and 
parties, where ALL people can come, that want to.  It is just like it 
saids on all the flyers;  If you come with a positive atitude, a good 
time will be guaranteed.  

All I have seen is negative atitudes from about CW on this list for a 
long time, in fact for years.  CW has taken more shit from the sceen 
than anyone else, and yet the parties still get biger and better.  what 
does that tell you?!???

I am down for everybodies freedom of expression, and I beleive that no 
one can be wrong when it comes to their own opinion.  all I am asking 
for is that if you are not down for somthig, or you don't like the way 
things are changing, do somthing positive about them.  Flaming 
coolworld as a rave scapegoat for all the sceens problems is not going 
to make the problems, or coolworld go away, it just makes you out to be 
a negative person.

Coolworld has brought more first time ravers into this sceen than any 
other production company.  They have exposed thousands of people to the 
beuty of house music and introduced many people to sceen.  Cool World 
should get some apreciacion, and respect for their eforts, not anger 
and negativity.

I have a lot of pride in the rave sceen.  And I have a lot of pride in 
FGE and CW.  

The one thing that I have learned is that you cannot please everyone.  
There are always going to be those that go unhappy no matter how hard 
you try to do the best you can.  This is unfortunate, but it is the 
truth.  So for those of you who are unhapy about CW, just don't go.  
You probably won't be missed,  and the absence of your negative 
attitude will make the event more positive.

A party is what you make it.  It exists in you mind and is manifested 
by your attitude.  if you want to have a good time, you will.  If you 
didn't have a good time, then you didn't make the best of it.

Well spoken. John.  You have addressed a lot of things that have concerned
me since I joined the list.

Part of the Respect in PLUR requires that we be aware of those around us.
Even when different than us.  No.  Especially when different.  Make the
effort to be aware.  I do not doubt that many on the list may not have known
the impact of words like 'gangsta'.  I do not think anyone is really being
accused of racism of the Mark Fuhrman type.  But there are other kinds of
racism, kinds which can be found in our words and in our institutions.
Often without awareness, we can participate in it-- just by virtue of
picking up the dialect or living in this society.  With knowledge (and a
little of the Love in PLUR),  we can learn.  

Beware of other words, like 'PC', not because being 'PC' is problematic, but
because it is used, like an epithet, to cut off discussion.  And the
discussion is needed, for that is where the awareness starts.

Thank you for your bravery in taking something so controversial into
SFRaves.  You are not alone in your opinions.  Or your attitudes.

PLUR (and I mean it),
Kerry

  If you want to insult people, have fun - I hope it takes you as far in 
life as you want to go.  I guess I'm misinterpreting your post, because 
it seems like you're saying you like people based on how well they accord 
to your fashions, but I don't think people are ever this blatently 
shallow.  Please clarify.
  Well, if you want to impose your views of what a rave is on others, why 
not try these other restrictions...

"real raves don't have flyers" or 
"real raves are only held in broken-into spaces"
  CLEARLY, not everyone has the same idea about what raving is...

"House music gives the rave scene a bad name, trance is the only true 
music"
"Trance music gives the rave scene a bad name, house is the only true 
music"
  etc etc - why have such a narrow view?...

at phish concerts I have had complete strangers give me presents.  Phish 
phans have sent me dozens of tapes on the confidence that I will give 
them something in return.  Listening to music with people who are sharing 
in the groove and the appreciation of the tunes.  People dance.  Soem use 
psychedelics to heighten their experience.  How many similarities do you 
want?  I mean, I see as much difference between some raves as I do 
between raves and phish.  Compare Cool World events to, say BBQ & Beats 
or a Friends and Family party.  Quite different?  And there are soo many 
kinds of electronic music, many are very dissimilar.

  I don't get the crab ranching reference...

I don't know who said what about Feel Good being like COOL WORLD, which
is totally bogus. But thankyou Ray Vonie for proving my point about COOL
WORLD. They are not a rave production. They do many events as well.
Ravers can do what they want. I don't know what its like to ba at  a rave
from the promoters view with a fat wallet and all, but the fact that they
are so huge and every RAVER saids bad about COOL WORLD now. I have not
been raving all my life, I don't know how it was then or whatever. One
thing I do give COOL WORLD is that they don't false advertise for DJ and
anything that will go on at a COOL WORLD. The one thing that they cant
change is who goes to their PARTIES. But they can try to not attract
those types f people. Before a movie, play, production of whatever you
need to have a target audience in mind. Since there are no changes in the
way they do things on a down scale, that must mean they are happy with
who goes there. The term RAVER comes from the word RAVE. RAVERS are
essentially what make a rave, a rave. Sure whoever wants to go to a rave
can go and its hellza cool. Its jsut that every Raver i know, has been
brought into the scen by another RAVER. That mean that A Raver has
approved a person to become a possible raver. Sometime they may choose
wrong and that one person may not set out a good vibe. Don't know why. Or
They may be told. "Wanna go to a RAVE?" They have heard stories about it,
mostly lies concocted by the media.
They are never sat down and talked to about Vibes, Smiles, PLUR (most
important factor of a rave) and hugs. The things that every raver
treasures and hopes for at every rave. No it so happens, that i have had
been handed flyers for COOL WORLD from people who don't even look or act
like a raver.  They don't know who I am or if i am mean or what. I amy
say COOL, Angelina is going to be there. Then I go to a COOL WORLD, since
there aren't any good vibes or PLUR there i feel the same as before, but
have a good time and maybe get into a fight. I don't knwo what PLUR is no
told me. Yet i still went to a rave.
Thats the thing here. Every rave i know has been brought in the scene by
another rave. They have been sat down and have been told what PLUR is.
Their raver firiend has been educating them how to act at a rave.
Since COOL WORLD is so public, of course it will introduce so many people
to their first rave. But they will go for drugs, music, whatever. Not for
PLUR. Because its not on the flyer. I mean the COOL WORLD Magazine.
Thats what is wrong with COOL WORLD
PLUR
-Paul
(The Guy Who started this thread)
I have been to a COOL WORLD. I know how it is. 
I can back up everything i say
I am a RAVER
I know what PLUR is
Ravers make a rave.
Not Music, not drugs, not money, not visuals.

Whew.  Glad this got cleared up.  Guess all those bustiers, hip-huggers,
retro-thrift rayon shirts, and knit caps worn in 110 degree heat are
completely utilitarian in nature.  And I didn't know that all those
people laying on each other in the chill room came to the event as a
group who already knew each other, without exception.

Gosh!  I'm so naive sometimes.  Perhaps some day I will know enough to
be a Raver.

Like I said, you don't know any gangstahs.  They don't give a fuck about
cops. If you knew some you would know.  Cops are more afraid of gangstahs
than you would think.  But then agian you don't know any.

No, I am saying white males.  There are black males, white males, asian
males, all ,kinds of amles.  The variety I was talking about are the white
males that inhabit this country, and thus this list.  Or, as I more
accurately put it, SOME or MOST, but certainly not all.

Why didn't you pipe up when people start grouping others by using terms
such as gangstah.  Please apply your OWN laws equally and we might get to a
btter understanding.

Yep, I graduated in 1981.  My group of friends consisted of whites,
jamaicans (very racially diverse), one Asian brotha who is still my serious
hometown, and many hard ass brothers.  I love and loved them all.  That is
what high school was for me.  Very, very integrated.  Group mentality
started in stoopid ass college.

And WHO particiapted in the survey.  Thank you very much sir.

As for context, perhaps it is the people on this list who are out of

No not me, your society.  And the sub-society that loves to bandy labels
around like tic tacs, then when called to task try to defend their racism
with freedom of speech, non-PC, etc.

Whatever, a memeber of your community takes offense, and you say to him,
"Shut up!, We're not talking about you!".

Whatever.  The more things change the more they remain the same.

I have labled you nothing, I know you must be disappointed by this.  I said
I MIGHT call you a racist.  After all, you and others on this list use
racist speech, and categorize people who are outside of your neat rave
domain.  Which, in my not so humble estimation, is damn near completely
white.  Much like this list, much like this country.  Just a matter of
fact.  And I have noticed a certain mena-spritiedness seep in.  Oh no my
droogies, you know me, I hardly say anything, and it didn't srat with me, I
JUST chimed in today so....  This bullshit gangstah talk has run it's
course, time for a new paradigm.  Find it, and stop the racist leanings,
racist tendencies, and racist speech.  I for one will no longer sit idly by
and allow this to continue.

I have had quite enough of the bigotry.  Time for it to go.

Late,
John

That is correct.  Since I KNOW gangsters, and Geoff has had his run-in's
with a few. other than perhaps your dad, who was in Law Enforcement, you
arte quite correct.  The fact that we are of African descent (not your dad
mind you ;) ), gives us a different perspective.

I would say however that anyone who has had dealings with those in that
underworld, are better versed than many on this list who had very
middle/upper-middle calss upbringings.  I would almost venture, by the
responses, that some have had isolated interactions with Africans or other
people of color.

Your suprise at my virtriol for coded speech is just one example of the
disconnect.

That's because Adder, gangstah is perceived by myself and others as racist
code language.  Not to mention that fact would be doing you and other a
disservice.  For then, how would you know WHY I am so angered at the use of
such verbiage.

C'mon, I've played better computer chess.

Or so you perceive.  You will see what you want to see.  The world, as I
have said many times, is a much different place than you make it to be at
times Adder.  As for a wide group of racist speech users, yes, I would
rather not hear the rubbish.  I think there are some hate groups online
that are btter suited to such discusions.

I found a cool site that gives a free emial address for life.  It's really
cool because you make up the email name and what it does is when people
send email to that address it forwards it to whatever address you have
currently.  So when you change email addresses all the time, this one
always stays the same.  

The address is www.bigfoot.com.  Hope some of you like this.

   People SHOULD take care of their own water but often don't.  One of my
friends always felt bad saying no to people in need of water, and she
didn't mind giving some to them EXCEPT for the whole cold/disease factor.
Her solution:  She invested in squirt bottles, so people could squirt the
water into their mouths, and their lips never touched the top.  She felt
happy sharing and she no longer worried about sickness.

 I agree! Why talk about anything with potential depth and meaning? I

 Yea! Really! I mean we all like to dance; we should all agree with one

 Yep! Sign up them arsonists, violent crime peoples (ya know, wife

 Although I'm probably wrong here, from what I have seen written it is 
the  "gangsta's" semi-threating/gang violence attitude that people really 
don't like. The clothing is fairly incidental (for most  ;).

 Sure! Just smoke some more euphoriant and skip/dodge the difficult 
issues in our lives and at raves. After all, it is the American way.



 I sorta apoligise for the flipness I'm exhibiting in this response. It's 
finals and my brain is doing wierd things. I personally would like to see 
more discussions on tricky, hard to resolve issues that impact the rave 
communitty but would also like to see more thought and less angry, overly 
emotional reactions (from myself as well!!).

My computer tells me that on Mon, 2 Dec 1996, The Grigsbeast shared (in

	Most of us had no hand creating the technology we use, true.  But
it was created by humans, not seagulls or chimpanzees.  It is a recent,
rapid, and unprecedented development in the history of Earth.  
	I appreciate that Grigsbeast may feel that he would be exhibiting
arrogance by calling humanity the most advanced lifeform on the planet.
At least that seems to be a common concern of humans uncomfortable with
the idea of the primacy of our species.
	But the evidence we have points to this being true; surely
speaking truth does not make one arrogant.  "Disrespecting" lower life
forms is perhaps a sign of arrogance, but recognizing that they are lower
is not.
	I believe in a healthy respect for all life, even to the extent of
being uncomfortable doing anything about the ants in my kitchen.  Yet they
are still ants, and I don't hold their lives in the same regard as that
of a creature capable of love, fear, hopes, dreams, aspirations,
appreciation of the beauty around us and abstract thought, i.e. a human
being.  
	And as for the average human leading a "stunningly featureless"
life, well, that's what we have raves for.

Advocate for humanity,

Hi all!  =)


 Some of these threads going on lately (which I've dipped into here and 
there) have brought up some issues for me that I would like to share;

1)   	I am happy to be discussing 'difficult' topics, in relation to raving, 
	on this list with people. I'm a far cry from a perfect 
	communicator (whatever that may be) and these issues and topics 
   	challenge me and my ability to communicate in a manner I like.

2) 	Unfortunanetly, as I'm not perfect (HAH! Had you all fooled!) I tend 
	to fall into patterns of communicating, that I use these 
	oppertunities (on SFraves and elsewhere) to learn to avoid. This is 
	frustrating! However, I feel that the only way to overcome my unwanted 
	methods of communicating is to communicate and take the chance of 
 	sounding like an ass again.

3)	I feel enormously grateful to the human race for coming up 
	with these oppertunities to learn how to increase our ability to 
	communicate with one another. And I am grateful for the tolerence  
	and patience shown by the majority on this list, towards  people like 
	me, who are struggling to be better at communicating.



peace and hugz for all,




Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

Okay...he's got a point here. How would a first-time partyer/raver find
a tight undergroud party? not too likely, eh?  well, it's gotta start
somewhere, and CoolWorld or Funky Tekno (or some of the other massives)
are as good a place as any!

hm.  lemme explain...
here's the World According to Me:
(each being a smaller portion of the previous category)

There's the general American public,
then there's the Partyer-Ravers in the general public,
then there's the Happy Ravers inside that group of Partyer-Ravers,
then there's the Hardcore Spiritual Ravers within that group of Happy
Ravers.

it's not too likely that you could jump categories too easily...Raving
takes some getting used to. MDMA can make the acclimation faster and
easier to understand. I mean, you're probably not going to be able to
take Average Joe Blow from Kokokomo and turn him into a Hardcore
Spiritual Raver overnight. In fact, most "Happy Ravers" couldn't handle
a Spiritual Trance Rave...so why expect that first-timers could
understand an Underground party?

So Cool World serves a purpose, and should be appreciated for that very
reason. If you don't like those types of events, don't go. It's really
that simple.

But as for things "evolving"...

> Evolution is the foundation of our 
> existance.  Nothing ever stays the same, and everything will always 
> change.  get a grip on reality, and flow with it.  Enjoy the things 
> while they last, and cherish the memory.

...I don't think that Cool-World type events are the result of
evolution. In fact, the  "parties still get biger and better" (sic)
because they have stunted their own evolution, pandering instead to the
(general American public) masses who wouldn't recognize Cultural
Evolution if it walked up to them and smacked them in the head with a
ball peen hammer. The Evolution of Raving is happening, but it's at the
other end of the spectrum.

Get real! Forget the Gravitron, the Ferris Wheel, the Ecstasy, the
cigarettes and the erotic fire-breathing dancers.

You know what's not a good cure for insomnia??  Web surfing.  There is a lot
of cool stuff that's easy to find when bandwidth is relatively free...so
here's something that's reall cool.  This morning I chanced upon the site at
www.erowid.com.  It has a lot of info of spirituality, faqs on substance
use, and links to large segments of the rave culture.  Definitely worth
checking out.

I do understand all of your points regarding "soberness" and drugs being 
legal and not legal...  anything that alters your behavior/attitude/etc 
is a "drug"...

	there grey areas inbetween these "drugs" and their effects...

Sorry, what I meant to say is that ravers dont hit on anyone AT A RAVE..
And most of the people in a chill room are people to gone on e. And they
are letting the E get the best of them and they don't care because they
love each other and are together. They may be rubbing each others necks
or whatever, but as long as they are not having sex its cool because they
are enjoying their E properly. If they are having sex at a rave they dont
have any PLUR they have SEX. Thatts not PLUR.
Ravers don't hit on anyone at a rave. They become friends with a person.
I don't know what your talking about comparing people laying on each
other in a chill room to people that have got each others number and are
going to hook up later. Thats a club! You don't hit on anyone at a rave
becuase Its looked down on. I'm sorry you didn't know that, but now you
know.

PLUR,
Paul

And I thought *I* was the lawgiver.  Sheeit lesee what we have from the
mouth of the Holy Raver:

-Sex is not cool at a rave.
-PLUR is not having sex at a rave.
-Ravers don't hit on anyone.
(But they do tend to bug the shit out of gangstahs...as the great OJ
Simpson said "Go figure.")
-Paul knows everything about what it takes to be a raver.
-If you don't know something about raves, Paul is the man to see.  Go
preach that word brotha man, preach!


What we know as well:
-Gangstahs are not welcome at raves.
-You must not show any signs of sexuality.
-E, if taken, must be PROPERLY enjoyed. (huh?)
-Hitting on people at raves is looked down on.  Just ask Paul, the lawgiver.

What we also know:
-John S. Lee is NOT a RAVER!


Yessir!

Damn, some on this list are really getting full of themselves.  Time for an
enema,let the juice flow people, let it flow.  Ahhhhhh!

Out,
John

The lunch is still on for today at 12noon-1pm or whenever you need to get
back. It will be at Pedro's and the directions are as follows

   101 S to Great America Pkwy / Bowers exit Turn left and go over
   highway.
   About the second light down there will be a Marriot on the right.
   Turn right at that light.  (I think it is Mission College or something
   like that.) Second light after that is Freedom.  Turn right.
   Its down a ways on the right.

   101 N to Great America Pkwy /Bowers exit Turn right (don't go over
   highway.)
   The rest of the directions are the same.

You can kinda see it from the hwy 101.


I beleive the reservations are under SFRaves.  Hope to see as many of you
there as possible.

Damn people...I can only wonder with all this yap about what raves are and
are not, who is deciding all of this?  IS there some sort of manifesto?
Why do many of you take your dancing sooooooo seriously?  I mean, aren't
there starving children?

Sheeit, many of you are in school using school accounts, talking about what
is and is not rave.  Probably on the public dole (i.e. student loans that
my working ass *guarantees*) in one form or another when your butts should
be studying.

And all this classification, like everyone is some type of biological
specimen.  I mean all this "Real ravers are...", and the "We don't like
gangsters...", and the "PLUR is all about..."  this is all bullshit.  In
effect it is just another form of segregation.  Yeah, PLUR as long as you
look /act /dance like me.  Yeah, much love as long as you 'follow these
rules'.  Yeah we're all inclusive and everyone is welcome except type A,
type B, type C people.  Bullshit folx.

You know, I *do* wish it were back in the old days.  Why?  We didn't spend
time yapping about who was not included or who couldn't or shouldn't
go...we were waaaay to busy catchin' a groove to pay too much attention to
the other bullshit everyone now places such great value on.

Yep, at one time there were all kinds of people going to parties.  At one
time everyone was invited and accepted.  The second things became a bit
more homogenous did the problems start to happen.

Just my not so humble opinion....back to a more diverse past.  I do miss
raving.  Too bad there aren't any happening anymore.

Later,
John

P.S.  Believe me, there are no more raves.  I don't care what the flyer says.

P.S.S.  It is just a party...can we dance now?  I thought not.

A different perspective perhaps, but *not* the only valid one. Personally,
I find it difficult to believe that some one that is obviously
intelligent could be so narrow-minded and short sighted as to believe that
*they* and one other person on the list out of 400+ members that has valid
thoughts and opinions on this subject.

I absolutely agree. But you don't know my background, do you John? You
don't know the background of most of the people on this list, do you John?
You are making blanket assumptions, that are racially based on your
perception of the constituentcy of this list. 

Also, because someone may not be as well-versed does not invalidate their
opinions, nor does it make them a racist.

I am not suprised by your vitrol John, merely disappointed that seemingly

without looking through the filter of color.

And I, and others, have gone to great lengths to demonstrate that their
use of the term is non-race specific. However, you feel that you are the
only person with a valid opinion on the subject, so everyone else be
damned, we all better stop using the word or we are racist.

And it is a much different place than you make it to be John. The "Great
White Male Bigot" is not around every corner waiting to gleefully opress
someone. There are racists in every community. Hate and ignorance are not
bound by color.

I would rather not hear your racist remarks about white males. Again, the
only one I have seen made an issue of race in this discussion is you 
John. The only one that has mentioned color in making deregatory
remarks is you John. If you wish racism to stop, start with yourself.

Is this a trick question? The people that participated in this survey were
the people on this list, the people that were using the term, and the same
people that explained that this term is not about color. So, I say again,
perhaps you are out of context with which the term is used on this list.

You're welcome.

I suppose that this would depend on whose reality we were discussing. I

your prerogative.

No one is talking about you, John. No one has been talking about you John.
No one has been using this term as a code word for people of color. 

There is nothing to defend, although explanations are warranted given your
perception of this term.

You feel that this term is racist. I, and others using this term, have
explained that nothing racial is meant by the term, and it is used to
describe attitude and not color. You reject this explanation. That is your
prerogative.

John, you made a statement that you would not bash people for their

your own?

Ah, I did not say you did, but that you may. So I am not disappointed.

race when making a deragatory remark is you John.

Paul, I have been a raver since February of '92 and I met my fiance at a
Wicked party two years ago. We didn't hook up at the party, but we did
exchange phone numbers *gasp* and got together for coffee later on that week.
The rest is history. I have a lot of close friends that I have met through
raving and I also met the man who I will be spending the rest of my life
with. I didn't go to Wicked that night with the intention of meeting someone,
but I did and it was the best thing that has ever happened. People go to
raves for a lot of different reasons and no person's reasons are better than
another's. Please don't judge people you don't know. Your email name reads
"plur" meaning peace, love, unity rave. Ravers, I thought,  are supposed to
have open minds and be accepting of new ideas and different kinds of people.
We're all at raves for many of the same reasons. We feel accepted and loved
for who we are. We don't have to prove ourselves to people (or so I thought).
We have the freedom to choose (to be sober or not). We want to experience the
music. I hope that you can practice plur for real sometime.

You asked for qualifications.  I gave you mine, repeatedly.  What are your

Please enlighten me as to your background, and your various interactions
with people of color.  Since you and others have yet to pipe up about your
interactions, I can only assume, byt the nature of yours and others posts
as to what those interactions are.  I can tell you this much, people who
have dealings with people of color on a daily basis in a peer-to-peer
scenario, are a bit more sensitive to the feelings of others.  Something
currently lacking on this list.

So far Adder you are the only one at this point who has mentioned race.
 FYI.

Using racist speech makes one suspect.  You are sitting here, along with
others telling me that a word you chose does not have racists meanings.  i
am here to disagree and tell you that it does.  A community of 400+ has and
will have a difficult time redefining a negative word used in the common
culture.  SOrry, my world is bigger than 400+ people.  The real world is a
bigger and badder place.

A very real filter indeed.  Ask Mc Duffie, Nat Turner, Malcolm X, ML King,
or Rodney King.  I am disappointed that you do not have the capcity to
understand anything other than your own view; through rose colored glasses.

Nope, just more qualified, as I have made great attempts to demonstrate.
You can have whatever opinion you want.  If a memeber of your community
takes offense you can a) ignore them, b) be sensitive and not use the
speech, c) none of the above, d) all of the above.  The choice is yours.  I
will react as appropriate to your choice.

Yes I understand this firsthand sir.  Please don't preach to me about
bigotry and hatred unless you have felt it's nasty sting.  As for racism
and bigotry here on the list., it is well documented. When you stop calling
people names, and start treating them like humans, and stop the
exclusionary bullshit, we can all move along.  If you continue to insist
you have some RIGHT to use a racially charged word, then I will continue to
see the opportunity to correct you and others, and fight the racist speech.

I don't wait for bigots to appear, nor will I hide when they raise thier
ugly faces (or feces as the case might be ;) ).

>
>I would rather not hear your racist remarks about white males.

Please cite the racism in my post.  Either cite it or shut-up.  White
males, or the use of such a term, is not inherently racist.  If you took
offense, please let me know at what, and I'll try to find a suitable code
word.

Stop playing the victimized white male.  You wouldn't know victimization if
it sat on your face.

>Again, the
>only one I have seen made an issue of race in this discussion is you
>John.

The only ones I have seen use the term gangstah are certainly not me.  So
go figure.  Who are those people who use the word gangstah, or doesn't it
matter?  Who is definging or redefining the word?  Or doesn't it matter?

Race is a part of American society, face it, or not, you're living in it,
and you use the terms of opression.  You can call it what you will, I will
not shut up about it until we stop the name calling and start looking at
people as people.  Nothing more or less.

Until then, I will continue to pipe up as long as that term is used.  Part
of free speech is MY ability to respond to things I do not like to hear.
It is a double edged sword.  Use it wisely.

> The only one that has mentioned color in making deregatory
>remarks is you John. If you wish racism to stop, start with yourself.

The only one who uses code words are you and others, stop it and I will
stop in kind.

I also did not call you a racist, but accused people of using racist
speech.  There is a difference.  Unless you know ME Adder, you should watch
who YOU call a racist.  I walk the walk buddy, I walk the walk.

F.A.Y,
John

Puhleeze Adder, you're becoming tedious.  The point was that the results of
the survey would reflect the list.  No kidding.  If people on the list
found nothing wrong with the term I guess I should go in lock-step.  I find
something wrong with it, and I didn't need no damn survey to tell me how I
should feel.  It's a code word, no matter what a damn survey says.

I would advise you not to advise me on good role models.  OJ Simpson was a

No it is a racist term, you would wish it weren't and that nobody

It is called an example.  It was not meant to be directly realted to me,

oft worngheaded) opinions of the list.

It applies to more than this dumb dicussion.

Gangst(er/a)s and Wigg(er/a)s and SFRav(er/a)s :

 First, about my "gangsta/wannabe gangsta" survey of a few weeks
ago - I didn't identify the respondents in my report, and you can see
why, from the recent heat about the topics in the last few
days. If the folks who replied to my original query post
want to email me and tell me their ethnic orientation,I'll post
a summary of that too.

 There was a very interesting article in the "Magazine" tabloid
section of the Sunday, Nov. 10th San Francisco Chronicle/Examiner.
About the attraction of the black gangster rap/hip-hop lifestyle
to non-black youth ( at least the version of that lifestyle that
is sold to non-black youth in tv shows, videos, movies, and musical
recordings ). 

 The article is can be accessed at the Chronicle/Examiner
web site www.sfgate.com -

editions search engine:

to find the Sunday, Nov. 10, 1996 issue of the San Francisco 
Examiner  :

Title: CROSSOVER     By  Venise Wagner    OF THE EXAMINER STAFF

Just two juicy quotes from a very meaty article:

"The rest of America is still deeply divided by race. So how come 
so many white suburban youths want to be black? A special report. "

".... an increasing number of white youth are finding a new sense of 
self in black street life - as portrayed in rap music. Some of them 
are kids from the suburbs who dabble and pose as gangsta 
wannabes. Others are white youths living in the ghetto, from the 
Tenderloin, Potrero Hill or Hunter's Point, forced to wear the 
Teflon stares of the streets.In the hip-hop world, they're called 
wiggers (sometimes spelled wiggas), an East Coast term coined 
for white youths who try to act black. Initially derisive, for some 
it is now a badge of honor, just as some blacks revel in calling =
themselves niggas. (Fact is, the n' word has reached color blind 
status in the hip-hop world, where whites, Filipinos, Samoans, 
Latinos and blacks freely trade it with and about each other, 
regardless of their racial identity.) "


 Goddam kids these days ...     >=(   

Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - I first saw the term "wigger" in a satirical piece by the National
Lampoon, dated sometime in the late 70's.

PPS - So, are you an "SFRava" ? If you feel you are, please explain why
      you are...

<< Sorry, what I meant to say is that ravers dont hit on anyone AT A RAVE..
 And most of the people in a chill room are people to gone on e. And they
 are letting the E get the best of them and they don't care because they
 love each other and are together. They may be rubbing each others necks
 or whatever, but as long as they are not having sex its cool because they
 are enjoying their E properly. If they are having sex at a rave they dont
 have any PLUR they have SEX. Thatts not PLUR.
 Ravers don't hit on anyone at a rave. They become friends with a person.
 I don't know what your talking about comparing people laying on each
 other in a chill room to people that have got each others number and are
 going to hook up later. Thats a club! You don't hit on anyone at a rave
 becuase Its looked down on. I'm sorry you didn't know that, but now you
 know. >>

I don't know about you buddy, but when i go to a rave i think about it as one
huge dating game!!! Everyone is so gone off their asses that they will say
yes to everything and before you know it you have more dates then Palm
spring.(Palm springs has a lot of date trees!)
You are writing some pretty heavy shit, I know this has been said before but
before you post about what a raver is, remember everyone has their own
OPINION on what a raver is, so please don't asssume everyone thinks like you

jonathan, you are so right!

It's really ridiculous to assume that "ravers do this" or "ravers don't do
that." I consider myself a "raver" (whatever THAT means.. =P ) and yet I
have met people who I've been VERY into at raves, and yes, I've "hit on"
them... sometimes while sober, mind you, so remeber it isn't always an "e"
thing. I don't see how we can totally seperate ourselves from our human
nature while at a party, and I see NOTHING wrong with letting someone know
you're interested in them if you are.

I don't think hitting on people is looked down upon... I think being
disrespectful is looked down upon. Often, people are considered
disrepectful when they are unnecessarily forward or one-track-minded (I've
been on the recieving end of this kind of rude behaviour, so I'm well aware
of how annoying and off-putting it can be) at parties, which I think SHOULD
be looked down upon, but if you think so-&-so is a hottie and you can
express that to him/her gracefully without being boorish or insulting, then
why impose some kind of un-enforceable rule on yourself by saying that
"ravers don't do that."



I'm not EVEN going to add to the gangsta thread... gee whiz, people, stop
snapping! when threads like this go on THIS long, I get the uncomfortable
feeling that no one really cares about the subject anymore, they just want
to get the "last word." Now THAT'S disrespectful... I mean, we've driven
sherry (mhg) off the list with this mindless complaining; shouldn't it have
ended there? she deserves a fatty apology.

take care,
-m.

I am very sorry, but I think this statement is really stupid.  Why wouldn't
ravers hit on other ravers at a rave?  For me, raves are what I do for fun,
and majority of people I meet is at raves.  And if I didn't have a
boy-friend, and if I liked somebody at the rave (and of course had guts to
do it) I would hit on people I liked....

I met my boy-friend Marc at Sunset, and we talked couple brief times at
couple Sunsets, and that's how we hooked up - after Sunset :).  That is
people's most liked day-party, so I guess it can be classified as a rave.
I also know a bunch of people who hooked up at raves in chill rooms and
ended up going out for a while.

I think what this is turning out to be is moral issue rather than "what
real ravers" do.  Also, ways people hit on other people is different.  Some
people are smart about it, and they find out if there is any potential,
while others just go for it ignoring the signs of rejection.  Some people
have hard time going out with their friends, and the idea of meeting
somebody, hitting it off, starting going out and getting to know them is
way more appealing than the other way around (this is from personal
experience).  I am not saying that I would like the atmosphere at raves to
be like it is in clubs "let's see if I can get laid" kind of thing, but if
we can't be who we are something is wrong with that.

I really hope I don't break up with Marc any time soon, because I am sure I
will be looked down on considering that if
- I am single
- I meet somebody at the rave
- I think things could work out
- I am brave
=> I will hit on that person :)

I guess that's cool - maybe I am not a "raver" - whatever that means :P.

My opinion on this,
*B*

Last year I did a research paper on LSD and was surprised to find a couple
recent articles about it.  Of course most of the experiments are on rats
and such much still very interesting work is being done with illegal drugs.


You just have to look for them.  There are a lot of neat, IMHO, science
journals out there, you just need the time to read them all and you'll run
across some very interesting stuff, amidst some other pretty boring stuff.

No, actually you have done nothing of the sort. Let's look at the question

Your qualifications are that you say you know gangsters. Does this
give you a better insight into what a "true gangsta" is? Perhaps. Does
this give you a more valid opinion on whether or not the term
"gangsta/er/ah" is racist? Nope.

John, go reread your response to my question. You absolutely and
unequivocally stated that youreslf and one other person on the list were
the only ones qualified to speak on this subject.

John, I would be more than happy to, if I thought for a minute that it
would change your mind in the least. However, no matter what my
background, no matter what the level of interaction with people of color I
have had and currently have, it would never be enough to satisfy you, and
would just be another thing for you to attempt to pick apart.

Negative word? Yes.
Used in common culture? Yes.
Racist? No.

You have done absolutely nothing to prove your point. You have done
nothing to show that the word is used in a racist context.

No, you did not ask whther or not my opinion was more valid.  Maybe you 
should re-read the question.  You asked if I was more qualified to speak 
on the subject.  I have answered that question.  You are now engaging in 
tedious argument.

And that is what you asked.  I do not think mine is the only valid 
opinion.  I do say that I and a few others are more qualified to talk 
about the subject.  Sheeit, everyone can have an opinion.  But not 
everyone is qualified.  You drew the line, not me.

You're projecting, and as usual you did not answer the 
question/challenge.  You can assume what you wish, I gave you the 
opportunity to clarify, and I can be swayed.  But as usual, you stop the 
opportunity than embrace it.  I see you just want to argue.

The point is I took offense.  I need not go any farther than that in a 
decent society, whatever that is.  I now SFRaves may not be such a place 
on the whole, but I do know there are plenty who know what the f*ck I'm 
talking about.  No matter how clueless you and others want to pretend to be.

And you have done nothing to show my racist comments.  damn you bait and 
switch alot my man.

Sorry I live in the real world, deal with real issues and people.  Have 
beena ffected by the society and see it for what it is.  However, it does 
not taint me for I go to work each day.  i still think humanity has a 
chance, and despite what you and others might think of me, I am very 
color blind.  My son and my life are a testament to this fact.  My Jewish 
heritage, albeit adopted, is furhter proff.  As I said before my friend, 
I walk the walk.

I live a pluralistic life, with people of all backgrounds and pursuaions, 
Muslims, Jews, Christians, black, white, asian, and everyone else.  I got 
friends, friends, friends, and love all of them.  Not becuase they are 
like me, but because they are idffernt than I.  I am sensitive to each of 
them, and it is hard.  But I would rather be a gentleman sesntive to 
others, than to run roughshod over thier feelings all for the sake of my 
expression.

It's called respect.  Maybe you should give some, you might get some in 
return.

Peace out,
John

Yeah there is.  Do that PLUR thing and really mean it.  I think that is a

This is indeed getting tired.

How can it be a code word, when the people that have used it have
explained that they have applied it not on the basis of color, but of
attitude, and they have applied it to whites also?

This is exactly my point. He was a great football player. I am sure
hundreds of years from now, all of society is going to be indebted to the
great sport stars in our history for their overwhelming contributions to
the cause of humanity.

I am happy to explain my use of the word to you, given your perception
that the word is racist, and mine that it is not. 

And you should know better than to make that last remark, of course I
still see racist speech.

And I reject your interpretation of the word. And if sometime in the
future I use the word on this list, I will again happily explain that I do
not apply this word based on race.

I take this as many of the white males on this list are saying racists
things.

> >> >> But then, white males have been labelling things for centuries.

What is the point of this? Just another jab at people based on their
color.

Of course this is all "matter of fact" to you, but this makes it no less
deragatory. 

The last part of your message got garbled, so not quite sure what you
said....

Really, I don't know if it makes much difference. You believe one thing, I
believe another. We are not going to agree on this.

so, John, are you saying that using the term "gansta" is a racial slur?

I just want to understand.  Your posts are filled with so much anger that 
your points aren't as clear.

 Sorry but no. Mantra is the first friday of every month (this friday

First off, I am not angry.  Not yet that is, but give me a few days.  
I'll get there.

Yessir, I am saying that using the term gangstah to describe people is 
racially charged.  Especially within the context it is often used on this 
list.

I would like it to stop.

I take great offense.  It is just like some caucasian person who tries to 
"re-define" the racially charged word n****r so that he can use it ad 
nauseam.

I just want the name calling to stop.  Either it will cease, or I will 
not shut up.  I think we can find different ways to describe people that 
do not have the "vibe", rahter than resorting to devisive name calling, 
such as gangstah.

>From all that I have read, explanation after explanation, I *do* 
understand that many mean nothing by it.  Just like the guy the other day 
who called me colored.  He meant nothing by it, it is just a term he uses 
to describe people with my melanin rich skin content (a real belssing 
IMO! :) :) ).  But I took offense and let him know it was not 
appropriate.  He did not try to explanin waht he meant, he said sorry, 
and I have yet to hear him utter the term again.  Nice, easy resolution.  
And he never resorted to using PLUR or other slogans.  He just realized 
someone was offended, offered and apology, and now watches what he says 
and is aware of the charged nature of the word.  I said nothing more to 
him of it, and I have ha plenty of conversations with him about many 
things, race not being one of them.  That is only for my close friends. ;)

All I ask is that people be considerate of others feelings.  I don't call 
women bitches or hoes.  Why?  It is disrespectful.  Are my points so 
important as to make others uncomfortable for the sake of me expressing 
my opinion in vitriol and devisive words?  No, nothing is really that 
important.  People are important, and how they feel is important, and how 
they view themselves in our world and thier place in it is of utmost 
importance.

Gangstah reduces people to object level.  Just like n****r, just like 
bi*ch, and h*e.  Why use them  I think the people on this list, with all 
thier education can come up with other words to describe people they have 
problems with.  I have always thought humans to be better than that.

But I am always disappointed.

Anyway, I am not angry.  Furious?  Maybe.  Pissed-off?  Sometimes.  But 
not angry.... :)  <- now are you seeing this...I mean this ok? (geez)

Anyway that's about it for me.

Peace out,
John

	We humans *in our complete and total objectivity* consider a high ratio
of brain size to body size and the ability to make and use tools the main 
criteria for how "advanced" a species is. 

	Strangely enough, other species have totally different criteria. 
For giraffes, it's mostly length of the neck. The marine mammals consider
the ability to hold the breath underwater for a long time quite significant.

	Many plant species feel that if you can't maintain a perfect meditative
state indefinitely while synthesizing your own food from sunlight and taking in
only what water and minerals the universe sends you, you are a troglodyte.

But that is not what you stated originally, at all. From you and Geoff as
the only people qualified to speak on the subject, we have gone to yours
is not the only valid opinion but you and a few others are more qualified.
At least that's a start. You still have not given any qualifications that
make your opinion on whether the use of the word is racist more valid than
any other persons.

John, I don't think in the same way you do. I don't view everything as
color. I don't like to, because that is not what I feel things are about.
But since you insist on me explaining my background in your paridigm I
will: 

Childhood:
 
Military brat(my father was an enlisted man, not an officer.) The military
is indeed very racially mixed, and a lot of places that I lived were
military housing, where I played with all kinds of people. My best friend
for 3 years was Damian, who was black.

We moved from Germany back to Sausalito, where I went to Martin Luther
King Junior High, a predominately black school.

My father got out of the military, and I moved to the canal district of
San Rafael, which is primarily latino and asian-pacific islanders. 
Best friends for the 2 years I was there were Benji, a black guy, and
Alecia, a white girl. 

Moved to Fairfield.  Fairly white-bred neighborhood. Went to high-school
at Fairfield high. Hung out in the Drama dept. known as the "drama freaks"
in high-school lingo. Pretty diverse group of people. Best friend for the
first couple of years was a guy named Kelvin, who happened to be asian. 
My high-school sweetheart was Debbie, who is Mexican.

Graduated high school, got a job, yadda yadda. Moved all over the place in
Sac, Davis, Dixon, S.F., and back to Fairfield, off of Deleware, where one
could softly fall asleep to the sounds of gunshots. The neighborhood is
of mixed nationality. Got to see lots of XIV crap, and the people like the
color blue.

Currently I live in a predominately Latino neighborhood in Concord.

There. Are you happy now John? 

I'm not. I *HATE* thinking in these terms John. These are not the terms
that I think or live in. I cannot express to you the intensity with which
I abhor thinking of places I have been, and people I have interacted with
in terms of color. I really would hate to be you.

I am done with this discussion. This is your chance for the last word. Go 
for it, I will not respond. 

I will continue to use whatever language I wish, you can take it whatever
way you wish, despite explanations to the contrary. What I will not do is
limit myself, or force myself to view the world in terms of peoples race
as I have been forced to do in this form. It disgusts me. You do that
John. Keep on being angry. When your done, look at some of the words you
have written that talk about unity and try applying them, *TO EVERYONE*

I understand how people use it.  I also understand that outside the list 
it is a code word.  So, how do we reconcile realities?

Or at least the neverending cause of cutlery.

I mean, that sneak attack was brilliant.  First he cut up two people 
cause he was pissed.  Next he sneaked atacked the jury by using a racist 
cop to dismantle any argument of evidence against OJ. And he sneaked 
attacked humanity cause we still talk about the shit.  And he's still free!

Straight Jackin', the way only a human can do!

Like I said, how do we reconcile realities.  This extends beyond our 
current discussion, but I think as we approach such subjects there is a 
disconnect.  What is real and valid, and what is not?  Where are the 
lines AND who draws them?

Answer this:
-Who redefined the word.  head count please larry.
-Who , in past posts, uses or has used it?  demographics someone?

I beleive I have the answer, which is why I made the statement in the 
first place.  Like I said, if I was wrong then indicate so.  I do not see 
how my citing facts as to who uses what words, and who redefines them as 
racist.  I am not the one trying to label anyone, I just would like 
poiple to stop calling people THEY DON'T KNOW names.  And perhps these 
are inappropriate names to begin with.

Who uses terms are just as important as who they're directed at.

>

I have private correspondence, citing racist lnaguage and phrases, sexit 
shenanigans, to name a few.  Cultural insensitivity abounds.  Now of 
course, you and others may not see wht I see, hear what I hear, or live 
my life.  But that does not make the circumstances any less real or invalid.

This list is a microcosm of our bay area.  The bay areas demographics 
have changed, certainly.  But those with the technology and the know how 
has not changed.  

I do not hold anyone to a litmus test.  You are who you are.  I do expect 
though that since we've all partied together at some point, at some time, 
that we would begin to see eahc other as humans, and not degrade to name 
calling or categorizations.  I have seen plenty.

When this scene was more diverse, and yes less white than it is now, 
there was not all this talk of gangsters, bad 'tude and such.  I saw all 
kinds of motherfuckers at parties.  Many of whom fit the descripotion 
that is used here; gangstah.  And you know something, I never witnessed 
an incident.

I have witnessed people jumping on decks fighting the DJ.  I have 
witnessed people so blissed out they couldn't walk.  I have heard stores 
of sexual abuse and other rubbish.  And I must say, the perpetrators do 
not fit the "gangstah" description.  They are/were regular party people, 
or so they seemed.

I see people on the list pass great judgement against others for nothing 
more than they aren't in the same headspace, and thus they must be a such 
and such.  Don't you see what you're becoming?  Is THIS is what 
raves/parties is all about?  Is it THAT important for you and others to 
classify those who do not fit your neat mold so that you can somehow feel 
better or superior to those you reject, or are different than you?

It's really not at all, that much about race, as it is respect.  respect 
for other humans whose lives might be vastly differnet than your own.  
Hell, if most of the folx on the list were paying attention to the music 
and thier feet, they wouldn't notice WHO was crossing thier arms or 
vibing.  Why pay 5-$20 to go to a party and pay attnetion to not the 
music, but who ain't dancing?  Is this  high school or something?

I dunno.  FFOr weeks I was silent as this list wne ton and on about 
gangstah this and that.  Sheeit, and the lot of you, many of you, don't 
have any basis for comparison.  You just all jump on the "we're better 
than THEY are" bandwagon and hitch a ride.  Yep, really plur, really 
rave...really whatever.

If you, or the group spent as much time getting organized and presenting 
a political or some other force, you wouldn't be gobbling for spaces, for 
money for spaces, against cops, against promoters, etc.

But no, we got plenty of time to decide who and what is gangstah and who 
is not.

Who is dancing and who is not.

Who is judging and who is not.

What we're not doing is having a good time.  We ain't dancing because:
-You hate circle dancers (sheeit, they if nobody else has kept this sorry 
ass scene alive).
-You hate people who don't hug and smile.
-You hate those that don't embrace some rave ethic even you don't follow.
-You hate them cuz they ain't like us.

The only thing I can think that most people on the list like is people 
like themselves.  So much for a viable scene, since it was built on the 
foundation of sameness in dance, not sameness of culture.  Common or 
otherwise.

The point:  It is a mtter of historical fact that white males have done a 
greta job at pigeonholing as much as they can.  Even the concept of race 
is rooted deep in european history.  Many of our modern concepts of race 
sprang from the minds of brilliant european scientist, who spend 
centuries traveling, spreading disease, and catalogging as much as they 
could.  It's not a jab, just another point at which realities cross.  As 
the forefatthers did, so do thier sons and duaghters.

Certainly not ALL are guilty, and my comments are for those who badny 
such terms and code words around.  Not everyone is guilty, which is why I 
am very careful to limit my the population to this list.

I really do like everyone, until they fuck me over.  I got friends from 
all over, and everyone that I've met in SF, to date, has been really 
cool.  The coolest thing about my experiences here is that none of my 
friends look remotely the same.  That is where I'm coming from Adder.  I 
hate nobody, and I am not a racist.  

You use speech to categorize people, I then inform you that this is in 
context with present and past european thought.  Is that racist or is 
that a fact?

You're right.  We may never agree.

that's cool Adder.  Once again, we must agree to disagree on this issue.  
Suffice it to say it has not been the first time it has happened, nor the 
last.

I do take solace though that when the moon is right, you, I, and others 
agree.  It might happen less often, but it does happen.  And I see that 
opportunity as manna from heaven.

Why?  Because, in the end, everyone on this list, really deep underneath 
the melanin fakeout, we all want the same thing.

Like I asked before...when in the next party?

Peace,
John

I stand corrected.  Anyway, as I have said before, I am qualified,  
Unless you know have met, or hung with gangstahs, you are not.  You can 
have all the opinions you want, and that is cool.  But unless they are 
based in fact, it is nothing more than a stereotype.

Oh yeah, IMO, of course.

It is how words are perceived.  And perceptions often differ to intentions.

Adder, you don't know how I think.  The only thing you know is that I 
think the word gangstah is derrogatory for racially historical reasons.

(P.S.  thanks Adder)

I did not ask you to define your friends in terms of color.  That was up 
to you.  If you were to say I had a variety of friends, that would've 
been enough.  If you were to say to me I have friends from many different 
places and backgrounds, that would have been sufficient.

As time goes on, our country will stop thinking in racial terms, we are 
not there yet.  You may be the first Homo Nova come to think of it, so 
you may very well be well ahead of the curve.  I do admire your thought 
process though and am respectful of it.  I also know others, and many in 
society do not think in such terms.  And as long as they are in power, 
they will be defining the terms.  As long as they define the terms, we 
will be left to figure or fight it out.  In the long run, the concept of 
race will not last.

As for hating to be me, I wouldn't know.  I'm having to good of a time 
being John S. Lee that I wouldn't know what it felt like to hate myself.  
My ego is too large, my ways too flamboyant, my mind to vast, to limit 
myself to such an emotion of hatred, much less for myself.

I am very glad to be me, every day I wake up and breathe (A real gift 
considering all the club abuse to my lungs).

Peace out, and next time Adder, don't be so pensive.  Talk to me for 
g_d's sake, and tell me how you really feel! ;)

Peace out my man,
John

I see.  Please do not limit yourself, I would not ask you to do so.  And 
if you're going to check out so thoroughyl from the outside view, why not 
stop using terms used by the world so couched in race.  Come up with your 
own word for an undesirable with an attitude.


> You do that

I am not angry.  That is your limited perception from your limited view 
of who I am.  You just keep on shutting out the world, create a new one, 
and limit yourself out of the one you checked out of some time ago.

I will and have and do.  Maybe you should walk the walk sometimes and get 
some sensitivity instead.

There are, after all, more worlds than your own.  Deal with it.

Out,
John

Ok, when i go to a party i find that the people (my friends) and the music
and space all are what keeps me going. Im just trying to find out why other
people are drawn to what we call Raves. I find(since i don't imbibe in drugs,
beside's pot) that I can get high of other people who are high. Wierd I know,
but if everyone Im with is on E, i tend to get happy and feel really good.
I'm not really affected much by the people. If there are hoodlums there that
doesn't bug me, and if there are a bunch of candy ravers that doesn't bug, I
just make the most of it. SO if we could just get a comment from people here
on Sfraves as to what makes the party for you, i think we could get a better
understanding of each other!!! K? Good! = )

However, given its destructive impact on the rest of the Earth (we've
already taken out about a third of the existing species on the planet),
and the consequent impact on our _own_ future ability to survive, I
don't think that we are entirely justified in calling ourselves
"higher".  Rapid, unprecedented, yes; but not "higher".

Your second sentence shows that you're assuming the truth of your
argument.  Again, we've had more _impact_ in a shorter time than any
other species we know about, but that doesn't equate to "primacy" or
being "higher".  Is a chainsaw "higher" than a beaver because it can
cause more damage in less time?

There's nothing wrong with arrogance so long as you can back it up. 
Representing a value judgment as truth, however, is not arrogance, it's
misrepresentation.

> "Disrespecting" lower life forms is perhaps a sign of arrogance, but 
> recognizing that they are lower is not.

"Lower" is a value judgement, by which you disrespect.  If I said you
were lower than I, what would be your reaction?

It's easy to say a label isn't prejudicial when you're not the one being
labelled.  Funny how this ties in with the gangsta thread.

I agree with you here.  Raves are a good start towards reclaiming our
desires and emotions for ourselves.

 Well, the pro wrestling world is full of 300 lb guys acting out
comic book caricatures of various pop cultural stereotypes - 
I'm scaring myself with the mental image of one of these monsterously
huge guys dressed in "raver" uniform, entering the ring to the
sound of a Chemical Brothers tune...

BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER....... i Don't think so. Idon't call Homies,

company."

 BINGO..... You hit it right on the spot Production "COMPANY".There in it
for the money. They don't care if anyone is having fun.

                  "CW believes that people are brought together by
music."

How is this possible? All the non ravers at CW Raves excuse me, let me
rephrase myself CW carnivals are brought together by doing "E" 

	    " and yet the parties still get biger and better."  

Yeah BIGGER And WORSE

                    " Coolworld has brought more first time ravers into
this sceen"

NO sorry those "first time ravers"  1. aren't ravers. 2. Don't know the
first thing about a rave or PLUR or what should go on at a rave. 3. Don't
spread love, and ruin the vibe. 4. mac on girls/guys. 5. ASK YOU TO
DANCE. (personal experience)

	" should get some apreciacion, and respect for their eforts"

What efforts? I don't see how they are making things better. Us ravers
are always trying to prove and show others that we are not bad and all we
do is drugs and dance all night. Because that is not what we are about.
And CW shows the world that we are bad and we do drugs, have orgys, and
promott violence. These are all things I've seen at CW parties.

	"Okay...he's got a point here. How would a first-time
partyer/raver

	>massives)"
	>are as good a place as any!

That's the whole point of an underground party. Us ravers have to throw
and attend underground parties. So we can keep our scene real. And based
on our morals.

	".Raving
	takes some getting used to. .so why expect that first-timers
could
	understand an Underground party?"

My point being... The majority of first time people that attend CW
parties get the wrong idea and continue on to other parties with this
sense of not knowing anything whatsoever about PLUR.

 	" If you don't like those types of events, don't go. It's really
	that simple."

Exactly why I don't . Besides I'd rather go to a $10 - $15 RAVE and have
fun and sread love and enhance the vibe for people who care. And meet new
ravers. and dance all night long. And give and recieve candy and
stickers. 
Then go to a CW CARNIVAL, and pay $25-$35 , and  get bumpped into and
pushed with no "sorry, or excuse me" in return. Friends get bunk "E" I
for one do not do drugs or promott any at all. But I do have friends that
do. Have to worry about if I'm smilling at the wrong person and they
might want to kick my ass for it. Worry about some guy grabbing me or my
ass. Trying to watch my favorite Dj "Carlos" performe and am knocked to
the floor by some guys next to me who are fighting over god knows what.
Crowed hallways where you have to squeeze by and there is at least a 10
min wait to get by. Because people are not considerate and don't know how
to walk. Being rejected when asking for a sip of water. Circle dancing.
Other people who are  eing really hard and trying to clown you on
dancing. Naked people walking around. Girls trying to impress guys on
tucking their shirts under their bras or just wearing their bras. Friends
being called gay or a fag because he has stickers and a elmo backpack.
Vendding machines. Popcorn ???????? Jumping Dragons, amusment rides. If
wanted to hear Angelina, Ruffneck or Foxy brown , I'd rather turn on my
radio. CW is missing the whole point of what a rave is about. They just
see a bigger party means more people and then their eyes are filled
greed.

	" Evolution is the foundation of our 
 	existance.  Nothing ever stays the same, and everything will
always 
	 change.  get a grip on reality, and flow with it.  Enjoy the
things 
	 while they last, and cherish the memory."

Haven't you noticed things change for the better not for the worst so as
we think. CW is changing for the worst.

	"Get real! Forget the Gravitron, the Ferris Wheel, the Ecstasy,
the
	cigarettes and the erotic fire-breathing dancers."

How can you forget about those things their staring you right in the
face. I'm sorry I can't forget about things or not notice things that do
not belong at a Rave. So in conclusion I don't want you to think that I'm
saying that only ravers can attend a rave. I beleive that anyone can
attend a rave as long as they don't ruin the vibe and they  spread love.
Ravers would never exclude anyone. were always open to new things and
people. But all we ask is that if you do attend a rave and know nothing
of this subject. Just to respect us and the vibe. See I feel that a rave
is a place where I can express my emotions and feelings through dance. A
rave is my world and the other ravers that surround me. When I enter a
rave I leave myself at the door and enter as a new person. I feel that
everyone who attends a rave is reborn into the rave and will always
experience new things and people. So If you ever go to another country,
city, planet, and you don't anything about it, are you going to just
screw things up and disrespect the people? NO. of course not. That's all
I'm asking for non ravers to do to respect us as if we were another city,
state, planet. And get to know us in a way that is not affecting anyone
eles. Thank for your time. 
PLUR and keep the underground alive.
See you all at Freaky People Dec. 13 Harmony production 
Love always Victoria

I agree with jonathan here, that everyone has a different opinion as to 
what makes a rave. I also agree that it's incredibly easy to get high 
off of the people around you, and I know it's happened to me even if 
everyone around me (including myself) is sober! 
	There's something about everyone coming together to appreciate the 
music and the vibe, and also all the beautiful people that I just can't 
get enough of. Some people go to raves for music, some go for the 
people, some go because they're curious, some go because they want to be 
"cool," some go in search of a new type of family. Everyone has a 
different reason, but the fact is that everyone's there to enjoy 
themselves, NOT to start shit. At least I should hope this is the case. 
	Everyone has the right to go to a rave and enjoy it. They don't 
necessarily (sp?) have the right to ruin other people's nights. But how 
do you determine who's ruining the night for who? No one RUINS a rave 
unless they come up to you and start shit. "Gangstas" (or whatever they 
are, don't ask me i don't wanna get into the flamewar) dont ruin a rave 
for me by just being there. If they were to walk by me and say something 
rude, i could even ignore that. A word or two can't ruin my night. but 
if they were to start harassing me and kick my ass, i can see myself 
having a problem with that. BUT it's never happened, to me at least. 
They've respected my space and right to be at a rave, and i've respected 
theirs. 
	I've felt intimidated, yes, but it's ignorable during a phat set, or by 
being surrounded by friends, but how am I to know that *i* don't 
intimidate them for some reason or another? What makes *me* so much 
better than them? What if they're really GREAT and NICE people,  they 
just don't feel like smiling at the moment or all night? Instead of 
saying that a certian "type" of person doesn't belong at a rave, maybe 
we should try to DEAL with the fact that they are there, ignore them, or 
try to UNDERSTAND where they're coming from, and get on with life, 
instead of complaining, flaming, and getting all tense. They're not 
going to leave just because we complain.  And maybe if we show some 
understanding towards them, they won't seem as intimidating, and they 
might understand us more as well, and things won't be so "bad" anymore. 
	Remember, we're all ***individuals*** trying to live life and enjoy it.
But then again, that's just me..

	This is going to happen soon away because no factions of 
electronic music seem to be able to get along. People who like house 
complain about all the trance and techno out there. People who like 
trance seem to ONLY like trance. I like gabber but I wouldn't want to go 
to a party that played onlly gabber every weekend. I think I might do it 
now just because I cannot find any place that will allow it to be played. 
So nobody tolerates anyone who likes something different. As spaces 
become sarce, how long will it be before the groups start fighting over 
who will get to use a space? That seems silly now with all the peace and 
love people preach, but I wonder where that love will be when there is no 
place to have parties...

Were massives like the ones in '92 '93 or so like "Sharon" and "Tune Town"
looked down upon (by the underground or others) as much as the massives of
today?  I wasn't raving back then, but did go to a Sharon once.  It was at
the Concourse...totally massive.  Bouncy castles, human gyroscope thingy,
amongst other things.  The dj was raised up several feet above the croud.
It was my first massive, and I had a wonderful time.  Other people seemed
like they were into it as well, but honestly, I knew nothing of vibe back
then so I'm not really sure.   Let me know.

I don't feel that the massives were the same as they were back in 90-93.  I
went to alot of the Sharons etc., and it was a way different vibe.  People
would dress in costume and there were lots of different people around that
actually got together!  Its just not the same as it used to be.  I'm not
saying that it should be the same cause times change and so do scenes and
people!

Take care,

Since so many have asked.  Look at how the mass media uses the term.  
Look at how the police use the term, look at how seciurity guards use the 
term.  It is a term which usually denotes people of color, who through 
dress or style of dress, type of clothes worn, or colors worn, are 
supposed to signify some memebrship in a group of thugs commonly known as 
gangs.  It is often delivered arbitrarily, to any black or brown, and now 
yellow (if I may use that term, forgive me) youth who sport such 
clothing.  The attititude is usually the glue that seals the impression.

It is also a term used widely in the hip-0hop world, almost exclusively 
by those who "try" to be "real" (whatever that is).  Adopting the ways of 
violence to show that one is not a part of the mass culture, but part of 
a subculture, whose attitudes towards life is one of slef-fullfillment 
through being hard.

How about assholes, since evryone has one.  How about people with bad 
attitudes, since everyone at one time shares those.  I am sure if you put 
some thought into it, there are plenty of words other than gangsta that 
would fit the bill.

And that in itself is part of the problem.,  We don;t know who is on the 
other end.  It makes being insensitive easy, as well as being offended.
This virtual shit is no godsend.  Just a tool, that has the potential of 
providing communication.

[ to sfraves ]

 I'm going to try to get my thoughts together and write a mini-essay
about what I'm thinking about, but I'll try it out on you folks in
an abbreviated form:

1. Ravers want to feel safe at a rave ( no fag bashing, robbery, 
   fighting, ridicule, etc. ) - esp. important if on psychedelics.
2. Being mostly folks whom high school is a present reality or
   fresh memory, ravers want to avoid parties with the kind of folks
   that cause(d) them pain and trouble on and off campus.
3. 1 + 2 == "Nonravers" don't get invited to the "good" raves.  

 If anyone has any opinions on the hypotheses I've made above, please
email them to me!

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - I like the daytime public park raves the best, because the public
 can watch and participate. Safety factor is higher than at night, given
the light and park rangers and police and the visiblity of everyone.

	Ok, I dress in jeans that fit with a little bit of slack and throw
on T shirts that look like they might be from the Gap or Sears, some are
actually from LL Bean or from my skating days 6 years ago (damn they still
fit) or from concerts that long ago or from ski clubs that gave free
shirts. I have half my head shaved and now the other half is dreaded. I
wear Tevas or hiking boots on my feet. I throw on woolly socks and my
North Face fleecy pullover that I put a thick cotton shirt inside of for
the hood when it gets cold. I lost my gray stove top wool from Pakistan
hat but mysteriously, a new red one appeared in my coffin after a party,
so now it is red.... 

	What does that make me? A raver? A hippie (I do not have any 
dayglow)? An average joe? A crusty (shit, I took a shower yesterday, 
scratch that one)? A saracistic bastard (now that one I might just like)?

	I do not wear glitter, do not like being stuck with stickers, 
wear a lighter around my neck with my orange whistle on it (but I hide it 
under my shirt because I do not like people knowing I have it). I do not 
always have a big grin on my face but I probably am not scowling...

	What colors do I have now?

	I dance when the music is heavy and stompy kinda like Red 3 by
Dave Clarke or Sublime by Chirstian Vogel or whatever the hell that track 
was by intimidator on 25 of twisted vynil. I dance when it is trancy but
still has more of a kick drum than a click. I pull speakers out into the
woods or around in the rain and stick a flashlight in my mouth when they
aren't working right so my hands are free. I love a kickdrum you feel
pushing through you at a speed where you are almost controrted to dance in
way that would do well to be hold a spear in one hand, a shield in the
other, and be stomping around a big bonfire - but maybe with synths in the
back to drag emotional energy into the whole thing.... 

	So does this make a raver? I don't have the baggies, my jeans fit 
too normally. I suppose the hair makes me a dj in SF, as does the lack of 
a big smile (hmmm, or was that two years ago). Basicly, it makes me a

ok people, I am wanting to meet all of you.  This weekend, I will be at
X-Files on friday night and Karma on Saturday night.  If you are going to
either or both of these parties E-Mail me so I can talk to you there.  You
may already know who I am, but don't realize that I am on the list =) 
Anyway.  Try and maintain a level of peace on here, isn't that what we are
all about, the fact that our scene is set for love of one another.  And
this whole this on sterotypes makes me sad =(  I mean people have us
(ravers) sterotyped, why should we doing it back to the opressers of our
society???  Please have a wonderful Wednesday night/Thursday/Friday day,
and party of Friday night :-)  Can't wait to meet all of you happy people.
Peace, love, and Harmony,
Eric Vandenbroek

I agree 100%. Since I had a bad trip while on shrooms (not *that* bad, 
but I was very much looking for people to make me happy and couldn't 
find any at the rave :( ) I've decided to be someone at raves that 
makes people have good trips...

I'm also afraid of leaving my stuff at raves... I feel as if people
will search through my stuff, get my water, etc. ALso depends on how
big the rave is.

Hummm.... I guess you are right on this one, the people that go to 
"good" raves I've noticed aren't like the people I've seen at "bad" raves...

I'd be very careful about defining a "raver," or defining any "type" of
person whatsoever.  It can be very devisive.  I am many, many things, but
first, and foremost, I am glad I am not only ONE thing.  That's the beauty
of being human.  Tolerance for different perspectives is very important in
life.  I know, I'm trying EVERY FUCKING day.

Just be careful about narrowly defining what is and isn't a category of
people.  Humans aren't categories, we're humans, and we come with all our
faults in tow.  But, we are also unique, so NO ONE fits into a
category.

Just comments,

I am sure that if Cool World had intentions of being a brothel they would
seize your date at the door so that they could sell you a new one once you
got inside. :-)

I think that Cool World will be a really "cool" thing to do for pre-club
aged kidz who have not yet found a real rave. If you aren't in that
category then you probably shouldn't go.

I am VERY curious to learn your views on this!

And I wish we could have gotten to this point much sooner, since I think 
this is really the rub.

BUT, instead of speculation, I'd like to propose a real research project. 
 I'm going to start a net search for the word, to see if I can collect 
some statistics on usage, etc.

peace

Okay I think many people misunderstood what I meant.
What I mean by ravers dont hit on other ravers at raves is
That at a rave i have never heard about a raver, who goes up to another
raver and says. "Hey baby, whats your sign. Can I get your number."
Thats hitting on someone.
Ravers say "Hi how are you" They converse They become friends first.
Then its not. Lets hook up I want to fuck you.
Its can i get your number and call you some time and they dont leave and
get other numbers of girls. Sex is a bad vibe at a rave. My Raver Friends
never mac on anyone at a rave. They sit down and are friendly.
Raves are for PLUR
Clubs are for getting numbers.

I am sick of people saying shit to me about how I am am go and shit in a
sarcastic manor. I like all people on this post am saying how i feel and
observer and I know.
If you don't like what i say dont flame me or whatever. There's no PLUR
in that and any person who doesn't have PLUR 24/7 can not be  a raver. It
takes a long time to be a raver and understand it totaly. I have only
been raving for 6 months. I don't know much at all. My friend has been
raving for 2 years. She is a raver. She knows. She points out stuff at a
rave. I am lucky to have been brought in to the scen by a raver. Not by
someone who went to a couple raves and though it was cool. Or got a COOL
WORLD flyer at a mall. Raving is a whole new experince for me. I feel I
completley fit in. All this talk about PLUR and not many people show that
on this site. If you don't even know what PLUR is and for what its there
for then you should shut up and not say anything and learn for
experineced people. Or wait unitl you do know. I didn't write crap to
this post for a month. I didn't talk like I was a hardcore raver ever. I
am not even close to being a total raver. I have so much shit I don't
know. But i do not what PLUR is I do know what a rave is. I do know the
diffence from a Raver and a Party Person. Don't clown me for speaking
from what I know. If you seriously take raving to heart. Then you will
keep PLUR wiht you everywhere and give it to everyone.
Thats all I need to say. I probably will get soem stupid email from
saying about how much I care about raves and by trying to make our scene
better.
PLUR,
Paul

Peace
Love
Unity
Respect

A Raver: Someone who know what PLUR is and takes it serously. Thats all
that matters to any raver. And even some people who aren't, yet respect
our territory when they come to a rave and show examples of PLUR to all.

hold up a minute.  PLUR = Peace Love Unity  Respect.  I would think that a
good sexual encounter should include all four of these things.  Sex does
not negate PLUR.  I agree that having sex in a public forum may be
inappropriate at times, and surely forcing sexual energy on someone who
does not want it is wrong, but I think you should really take a look at
your views on sexual relations if you feel that sex negates PLUR and PLUR
negates sex.  

and as far as the  'proper' use of MDMA... I knw that I for one have a
real problem with interacting physically with others.  I have taken
dancing lessons, fencing lessons and other physical stuff to try to
understand where the problem is at and get past it.  Truth is none of it
has really worked.  However, when I use MDMA, I find that physical
interaction is quite enjoyable and spending some time cuddling with a
friend (old or new) is an important part of a growth-oriented trip.
I know that these views might put me at odds with many folks, but all I
can say is, hey, I don't plan to make you get a hug if you don't want one!
:)  But you should get at least one !:)  Hug sluts, back me up!

nothing personal, just views on a few important topics.

For someone who repeatedly denies having current involvement with Cool
World, you sure are quick to defend, debunk and otherwise downplay real and
potential negative aspects of COOL WORLD's large, sellout, $$$ focused
"rave parties" which are honestly all sellout exploitive cash-fests.

If COOL WORLD was really here for the rave scene, COOL WORLD would be
throwing smaller, not larger parties. They would be free or close to free,
and, in all truth, COOL WORLD wouldn't be making THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of
dollars upon which the COOL WORLD promotion team and their ilk live.

They may say "Well, it's a lot of work to throw these parties and we
deserve to make some money to keep doing it."

And I would quickly rebut that COOL WORLD really cares about the scene,
COOL WORLD would not be throwing mega budget parties with LOTS to gain,
rather COOL WORLD would throw smaller parties that are nowhere near the
hassle or expense of larger ones. COOL WORLD's reward would not be a
suitcase full of $20's from the dissappointed masses, it would be the
personal satisfaction of throwing a good party with and for your closer
friends that would leave the guests and promoters both *spiritually*
fufilled.

But we all know the real truth about COOL WORLD -- AND THEIR DEFENDERS.

Frankly, there's a lot of shit sent in COOL WORLD's direction because we're
collectively more pissed that COOL WORLD would insult our intelligence by
attempting to make us believe that COOL WORLD is in it for the vibe and
community when we ALL know COOL WORLD is in it for the money.

So just say it. Call it like it is. Tell us COOL WORLD is really in it for
the money. It's OK that COOL WORLD makes THOUSANDS of dollars off the rave
community as long as COOL WORLD is straight up about it.

I personally like entreprenuers but I despise liars and cheats.

I have a feeling that there are more than less that would agree with me on
this point.

This may be COOL WORLD's "market" but this is our PASSION.

Look here ya cunts, both of you sticking to your own systems and not 
looking at what the other is saying, or if yer are, ye not doing anything 
about it.
	I called both of you cunts knowing full well that here in the
California, most people are going to take great offense at that right? 
Hell, when I lived in Oakland, I would have gotten my ass kicked nicely if
I walked out and looked at my neighbors and asked how all ya cunts were
off. But I go to Glasgow and do that and I will get a pint shoved in my
hand and patted on the back as a forgiener who can cross some terrioritial
barrier and not bring all my vocabulary prejudices with me, or something
like that (well, if it was the right cunts ken?).  I come back to the
States with a new word and explain and no one will hear it, it does not
have the same meaning, those rude Scots are just shovonist pigs simply
saying they have changed the meaning to imply.... 

	Ok, that was a lame attempt to kind of shed a little bit of ease 
into this conversation as it seems to have become a "no it's this way, no 
it isn't, it's this way, no......" discussion. First, we have that in 
some circles, a gangster is black - the original gangstahs were black and 
all these other types are idiots who are trying to copy the original 
hoodz and walk the walk without the background that brought about that 
walk. If you're out in Oakland were I lived with anyone and you saw some 
hot assed asian or white frat boy go by all laid back and looking like a 
hard cunt, someone who pipe up about him trying to be all gangstah like, 
I suppose that was because only a black could actually be a gangsta. And 
I assume that is because these little shits grew up down in LA with a 
million bux in the bank and thought it would be all cool to be doing the 
gangstah walk but they kind of missed out on growing up in the ghetto 
with bangs in the night and having to learn to do the walk or else you 
were meat to be eaten. How can one be a g without that? That's my take 
from the time I lived in North Oakland on 63rd and Market. It's my take 
from when I talked to the people who had been there much longer than I 
was and who weren't going anywhere else soon cuz they couldn't get out. 
And than, maybe they didn't want to get out, cuz they knew that shooting 
the shit up in the hills was shit too, just different shit.

	Well, the original gangstas it was pointed out are from New York 
running alcohol during prohibition. So the original gangstah were white, 
they ran around with guns killing each other and protececting their own. 
That sounds kind of familar. And for some reason, its the in thing to do 
now. Be all hard and run around like a hard cunt. When it comes down to 
it, what is a gangsta? And what do you call those people who think their 
all hard cunts but when the shit hits the fan, they aren't.

	So how do people communicate? We have words and people use 
different rules for the words based on their understanding of the rules 
when they learned the words. Whose rules for the word gangsta apply here? 
People don't want attitude filled assholes who think they are hard cunts 
coming to parties and standing on the walls scoping women and trying to 
start fights - is that what people mean?
	What I get from what I read of John's posts he takes offense at 
sfravers saying they do not want people of color who live in the ghetto 
and have a certain way of life coming out to parties period and that we 
are simply redefining his term so that everyone can feel good about 
themselves for not being racist. And since sfravers are all doleys up at 
univeristy (I dropped out of Berkeley a while back but still have this 
account which I use for sfraves so I am no longer a "student", don't let 
the address fool you) have no experience in the streets and no experience 
being locked into a community for life which is pretty much true of 
everyone I met at Berkeley. Am I getting this right?

	On my own note, if people are turned off by people from where 
life is a little bit more worrisome not running around with glitter and 
shit eating grins on their faces, I wonder why? Is this the mark of 
attitude? Or is there something else like the way a group of circle 
dancers kind of close themselves off from everyone that is disturbing 
everyone? And by closing off, I do not mean forming a circle cuz those 
always form as people turn around and look about, but there is something 
different like the circle becomes its own entity. Or is it something 
else....

  I am usually in the Quaker State for an hour or so. 
  Each night before I goto bed, i pop on my 808 state head set, slip a
jungle CD into the  8x, and I take out around 20 to 40 people! Using my
axe! Or else I will force the poor, helpless little nerds into suffercating
under water by using my rocket launcher to keep them from coming to the
surace! Hey.. You don't wanna drown? Fine, I am sure that internal
combustion would be alot less painfull anyways.
  You can find me on 207.48.50.5 most of the time. But if I am smoking a
cigarette, and you just happen to stroll along. You just might see some
ravEr come swingin at you on his grafling hook, swinging like freakin
Tarzan in the jungle! But you can be assured that you will die before I
have the chance to swing into your face.  =]
The rules on 207.48.50.5 are very lenient. Random weapons pop up, You can
use your grafling hook, special weapons.

  The only thing that sucks though is, my server is slow. Hooked.net lags
nStuff. So does PacBell.com. Makes my TR5/P-133/96RAM/2MEG-64bit Video card
run like a 386sx IBM Blue Lighting with 512k RAM. Sometimes. =]:..
I need an ISDN modem or Terminal card. 
We gotta get Digital!

Thank you very much. I am glad someone understand what my goal is.
I will post your link on my homepage soon. Thanks for being open minded.
My friend Victoria wrote mail about COOL WORLD.
Ray Vonnie himself answered back. Please Read it and tell me how he is
lying through his teeth. Also. If Feel Good is not COOL WORLD. Then why
is he sticking up for them. I don't see all the other people from
Harmony, Ghosttribe, Spundae, Charity, ,etc. saying anything.
Thanks

Okay you guys. Ravers who have been to an UN-COOL WORLD party know what
its like and don't like it.
I have never been to a Feel Good.
I have never been to a COOL WORLD
I have been to  a party thrown by the BUZZ Line
That was Mega Buzz, or the better name. Mega Bad Vibes.
Oh wait. Since The BUZZ Line is by Feel Good then I have been to a Feel
Good.
Oh I also forgot that Feel Good IS IS IS IS IS IS IS IS IS IS not mater
how much they deny and lie and cheat and whatever, they are and forever
will be COOL WORLD.
And that means I have been to a COOL WORLD
Did anybody know that COOL WORLD is run by the Persian Maphia in LA?
Hmmm maybe thats why they don't care about ravers and goov vibes.
I am sure  Ray Vonie, if thats his real name. Sounds pretty peculiar to
me.
rayvonie say it 10 times fast. Hmm are you saying RAVE ON E?
I think you are. never noticed that. Anyway I am sure Mr On E will email
me back with blah blah blah about how much they love everyone and are not
in it for the money. its just EVERYONES word agains ONE, oh now I am
sorry THREE Production parties.
Who are you going to beieve? Some one with a fat huge wallet or someone
who pays to rave and spread love and peace and unity and respect and
stickers.
I  feel sorry about COOL WORLD People. They don't get it. Its too bad.
You know, actually i take alot back now that i think about it. I guess I
would be blind to anything that happend at my party with millions of
dollars in my hand. I wouldn't care what girl got tied to a stick and
raped. Who care I have money right.

PLUR
Paul

Everyone better think who really has PLUR before emailing me back. I am
trying to warn everyone. If you have never been to one of these
productions don't counter email me. If you have and you think otherwise.
You better check that you underwear says GOOD VIBE on it and not BAD
VIBE. I know what mine says. GOOD VIBE. I don;t even need to check. Hope
you all take this serously because its no joke. Its not funny to ahve
your bag stolen at a rave. It hapened to my friend Kate and no one did
shit about it except for the ravers. And they weren't on E.

First of all I never said I have no involvement with CW, in fact I said that 
I have a lot of pride in CW and their eforts to extend house music to the 
masses.  I did however say that CW is not the same as FGE, our directions and

These are just your own opinions and do not justify any coment, being that 
they are totaly wacked.

You know nothing about CW, or the reason that they do the things they do.  
You have your own narow minded interpitation of what a party is suposed to 
be, and thats perfectly fine, there are plenty of those for you to go to.  As 
far as haviong a lot to gain, don't forget about the other side, there is 
also a lot to loose.

Once agin you are mistaken, and have substituted your own opinion for 
reality.  And no one is trying to insult your intelegence, you are doing a 
fine job yourself.

CW is in no way trying to market its events to the underground.   everyone is 
invited, as always, but most core ravers just don't bother going to CW events 
because of all the bad vibe, Rumors, and hostile atitudes that have been 
created by the so called rave sceen about CW events.  CW would love to see 
core ravers outnumber first timers at their events.   This way you all could 
put your PLUR were your mouth is and guide the first timers in the right 
direction.  But unfortunently the reverse discrimination that has pleaged the 
rave sceen for the past too years will probably not alow this to take place.

Its funny that the exact reason why we all went underground, to escape 
discrimination, and unjustified persecution, has resurfaced within our ouw 
sceen.

We all have a passion, and a vission.  CW tries to bring people together 
throught the beaty of house music and dance.  ALL peoples, not just ravers.
I have been producing parties for 6 years, and if I was in it for the $$$, I 
would have quit a long time ago. 

You remember that time you were dancing to that certain beet at that one 
party and it felf so dam good, and you thought to yourself, 'wouldn't it be 
wonderful if everyone in the world could feel this way??'  well its 
production crews like CW, FGE, and many others that are reaching out to the 
masses and doing something about it.   Its just a shame that there will 
always be people like yourself that would rather knock someone down than lend 
them a hand, or tear apart somone trying to to a good, thing, and yet do 
nothing yourself.

Thats all I have to say, and I hope I have said e-nuf
Bad spelling is my trademark.

Your logic is so wacked that I bet you could convince yourself of 
anything.  Smoke another bowl and try to justify how it is that someone 
like yourself, who has been raving for a whole six months, can blatently 
call someone like me, who has been raving and producing for SEVEN years & 
who you have never met a .... liar??!!??  .

The funny part of this statement is that you think that people of Persian 
descent don't care about a good vibe.....prety un-PLUR to me.

Of course thats not my real name....Like duhh.  It used to be my dj name, 
but I gave up spining because I was making to much money, and decided to 
throw parties instead.

I have seen your stickers thay have as much respect as the rest of the

longer be used because of their presence.

I feel sorry for you, mabee you should get of the drugs and get a real 
dose of life.  Your Idea of PLUR is wonderful, But you are taking to the 
wrong people.  Try to practice what you preach and do it in a positive 
direction, Or else no one will take you seriously.

PLUR,   Vlad,   FGE

A while ago, in the midst of discussions about massives, I posed the
question "What is so bad about Cool World" to the list, never having been 
to a Cool World. I received a flood of responses. Not one of them
positive. All I have ever heard about Cool World, from people that have
attended, is that it is all together a bad experience. 

So I would not be so quick to state that it is only Wayne's opinion in
this matter. Cool World has a lousy reputation, and it is difficult for
me to believe that all of the people that have spoken of their
experiences are somehow out of touch with reality.

I think Wayne was asking you to admit that which is fairly obvious, that
CW is out to make money first. 

As far as "rumors" and hostile attitudes, if CW truly threw great
parties, there would be no such attitudes.

No, you do not. CW brings together people that can afford the high price
of admission. This is not *ALL* people. Not even close.

What is our cut of the admission price?

Sorry, i wrote the first reply before I scrolled to the bottom and read this.

THIS MAKES ME MAD, but im sure im not the only one. Ive been classified by
many people because of who I am, or what I do, but to be classified as a
raver??? Sorry but  i never would have suspected that I would be labeled here
on Sfraves. Ironic.
Oh and by the way, for all the years i have been raving, i have been on both
sides, i have gone as someone who attends a "rave" and I have even thrown a
"rave", more often then not people don't know what the fuck plur is, and
after reading half the posts I still don't think they know. And you know
what, im not sure I even know.

 Actually, the first ambient room I ever performed in (Mr. Rogers 
Neighborhood in 1992 or 93, Santa Cruz Civic) I had a couple grouping 
each other right next to me while I was playing. While it was a bit 
distracting (what WERE those hands doing in there?  ;) I was complimented 
that I was helping to create an enviroment where folks felt comfortable 
enough to be intimate with each other (they were relativly discreet).

 By the way; I think it is wonderful you have Marc in your life and I 
wish the two of you much happiness together.

You know, maybe for a "true raver"(whatever that is) cool world would suck
because it glamorizes what they try and keep so private so underground, but
if people would just understand that, and let it be, i think everyone would
be happy. NOBODY is benifitting from all this negativity really folks, can't

NO!!!!  MORE FLAMES!!!! 

 What can I say? I'm cheap and I havn't paid the heating bill in a 
while.  ;)


 I like being able to discuss controversial topics with people. It gives 
me a chance on how to learn to stay cool when someone else is gettin' 
riled (not easy for me at times :(  ). It's almost like being able to 
talk about those things your family never talked about as certain members 
couldn't handle it. Well, if you don't use it you lose it. Communication 
skills are no different.

 While I would like to see more respectful posts (from myself included!!) 
I will not tell someone to shut up (on this list) because I'm feeling 
uncomfortable with what they are saying. I may ask them to consider my 
perspective. When I lose it say I may say something I will later regret 
(then again maybe not  :). But most of all I try to learn from my posts, 
others posts, from other perspectives. I would like to say that when 
people resort to abusive verbal violence, it makes it tougher for me to 
learn and grow from what that person may be sharing. But again, if I can 
learn from an abusive post, rather than angerily typing or signing off, I 
benefit, I win.

peace y'all

The only reality that I think people are out of touch with is this ridicules 
notion that there is an obsurd amount of money being made at these parties.  
If this was realy the fact, don't you think more people would be throwing 
them, and don't you think there would be more than one CW party this year.
The chance to loose a fortune is a lot grater then the opertunity to make a 
little profit in this buisness.   


>I think Wayne was asking you to admit that which is fairly obvious, that
>CW is out to make money first. 

To be seccesful in any form of entertainmnet production, the enetertainmnet 
has to come first.  In rave production the rave also has to come first.  If 
your audience is not happy, they will not come back.  That means you have to 
give people more than their monies worth in order to maintain a folowing.  
Since CW is always growing, I think that that saids that there are a lot of 
people out there that enjoy the events.

And whats so wrong with making money, especialy if it is in doing something 
you enjoy, and it is something that bring joy and pleasure to many people??  
Can you think of a better way to make a living??  

>As far as "rumors" and hostile attitudes, if CW truly threw great
>parties, there would be no such attitudes.  

People in the sceen use CW as a scapegoat for all the sceens problems.  
Why?, Because its easy.  But it does not solve anything.  It just 
contradicts the ideals of the sceen.

>No, you do not. CW brings together people that can afford the high price
>of admission. This is not *ALL* people. Not even close. 

New year is a very expensive night, and it costs a lot to throw a party on 
NY's eve.  People are used to paying that much, check around, its just the 
way it is for a production of this caliber.  On regular weekends during the 
year CW parties cost the same as any other large party.  

I hope this clarifies everything.

I was just wondering why you gave up DJing.  Because you made too much
money?  
I'm not saying that's bad, but i'm sorry, that's the last thing that I'd do. 
If I ever got to the point where I was making good money for doing what I
love, I don't think I'd _EVER_ quit doing it.  Just wondering why...

I am truly sorry for anyone who thought the same. Actually I have not
recently changed my views on the rave scene. I only put it up in Sptember
when i was not completly understanding everything. i have all the pages
ready to be changed on my computer. As it saids its under construction.
And it still is. I am having a huge problem with my homepage provider.
they were doing something to make the system better and run faster and in
turn they have lost many people's password files. i have not been able to
change anything on my homepage since the day after my review of smiles. I
will be changing the Homie Hoe Score part. I am considering removing it
totaly. I am sorry about all that. It not very PLURisha t the moment. I
am waiting  for my homepage provider to email me back with my password
ASAP. They just finished fixing their problems and as soon as I can I
will change the homepage. Check back maybe in January.
PLUR

Once again.
Ray Vonie comes and email us back insultin all ravers of kinds with stuff
about stikers being graffiti??????? Guess We'll never win on this one hu?

I must comend you Ray i think that you are very good with your words and
that you beleve every single thing you are saying. I am glad you have so
much faith in yourself.
I ams sorry about that crack about RAVE ON E.
Remeber have not been raving for vey long and never knew that you used to
be a DJ.
And you quit cuz you had too much money?
Okay I guess. 

But about the Persian Maphia was totaly twisted around by you. Just take
out the word Maphia and ignore the Persian part. I am jsut trying to
calrify which Mafia i mean. And by the way I know plenty of Persians who
spread the PLUR at raves.

I am sure you will respond with a huge email about how good COOL WORLD
is,
but this will be an on going battle. No one will win. I see your points
vivdly and clear. I understand what you are trying to say, but I have
been to a Feel Good and it was not full of good vibes and there were many
ravers there. I don't care about Homies Hoes or Sakter or Persians going
to parties.

I ahve gotten more than my share of rides to a Rave by actual Homies. The
difference is that the Homies are not Bad Vibes. they don't refuse candy.
they understadn that a rave is raver's territory and they relaize how
deeply the vibes affect us and effect us in so many ways. Raves are for
everyone. Like you said, but some people shouldn't be raving. Instead of
wasting all that Paper for huge flyers maybe you should add one about
rave etiquette. What PLUR is and spell it ou for them.

If you really cared so much you would understand that its not safe to
advertise a rave to anyone. Only people which exibit some kind of PLUR
some time.

Anyone who kills people for fun or is in a gang, should not be there,
unless they want tu change their life drasticly.  Like all Good Vibes, I
have been sat down by a raver and been eduacated before the rave and on
the way up there on how to act.

I still  don't get everything, yet I try my hardest not to be a bad vibe.

Sorry for anything i said to you personaly
Its not directed towards you. You just seem to be the ambassador for COOL
WORLD/FEEL GOOD/BUZZ LINE/GLOBAL PARTY NETWORK.
its not an attack on you. Dont take the personally.

PLUR,
Paul

P.S. I jsut feel sorry that every raver know how much you bull shit
everyone and i am tired of you pulling the wool over our eyes and saying
how ravers are a plauge and are more prejudice to the fact that we dont
want anyone, but ravers at a rave.
the fact is that most homies are a bad vibe. Not all. A Homie can up to
my friend and asked her for stickers. I give him props whoever he is. he
is not a bad vibe. He is a good vibe.

....when I visited SF back in July I stayed with Claire Korich for a week 
and had a brilliant time. I've since not been able to get hold of Claire 
despite sending a card to her old address which was sent back to me, calling 
Gateway which is the company she runs with Rob and John and her old AOL 
email is no longer apparent.  She's well known at the outdoor parties and 
goes to the 'Friends & Family' set ups.  I was going to repay the 
hospitality she showed me as she was due a visit to the UK sometime in 
November.

If anyone knows where Claire is or has seen her recently please ask her to 
get in touch. I really would like to keep in contact with her !!

Thanks a lot

All,
	I gotta add something to this thread. I hope it makes sense.
	Firstly I come from a Gangland but was smart enough to not get
involved (not too much). It was mostly of Latin pursuasion (sp?). Sooo,
every time I hear of gangstas from this list, I see Latino hoods in my mind.
Maybe thats why Mr. Lee believes that the List is always refering to people
of color. Because thats how he sees it. 
	I see it differently now. I see any reference to gangstas, equally
to that of a hoodlum or troublemaker or people who put up a front so
that you may not see their weaknesses. They come in all different sizes,
colors and sexes.But i think they are slowly evolving to ravers and we gotta
show them we accept them for who they are 
		I hope that made sense.
					TAKE CARE ALL

Kaytee [member of sfraves] called me and told me that you alot of you were
in disagreement over alot of things and you guys just didnt seem very
cheery. My name is Eric and I am a member of Socal-Raves. I normally only
post my massive messages to the friends I have at Socal-raves, but I think
all of you could use a little positive light and I would just like to remind
you all about what we are all in this for. We often think of raving as our
weekend release at an event with dj's, an interesting environment, and the
use of drugs (for some of us). We spend nearly $20 to get into these events,
dance all night and when its over, we consider the journey over. But it is
not. Raving is something that comes from WITHIN you. We all have felt the
incredible vibe at some point, and what you need to do is carry that peaking
vibe with you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can have the greatest time
with your buddies without spending mega-money. All you need to do is care
for those around you, and have love for everything and everyone. You all
have that love. You all care about the peace we experience together and what
good it does us all. You all care about the love that binds us in an eternal
journey of music and people. You all care about the unity that we feel each
time we reunite. You all care about the respect that is deserved by everyone
on this planet, no matter what. I am here to tell you all that you are not
alone in your journies. I will always be with each of you. If you ever feel
alone and that all is lost, you only need to remember that I am with you
projecting energy upon you. Not only am I doing so, but so is the love that
comes from all ravers. Our always in the atmosphere. It is the most powerful
thing on this earth.  It is incredible to me, the journies we have
experienced together as ravers, and the boundaries we have crossed in
relation to the rest of mankind. Its almost as if ravers have unlocked a
part of the brain that has been lying dormant for millions of years, perhaps
forever. This part holds our concepts of PLUR, our appreciation for nature,
our love for our beautiful music, and our ability to enter a trancelike
state almost at will. If only everyone could experience what we experience.
If I should die tommorow, I want you all to know, from the depths of my
heart and my soul, that I TRULELY love each and everyone of you. I admire
and respect all of you and I will continue to do so for as long as I shall
remain on this planet. Remember my words during the week, if you are sad or
depressed or just dont feel well. Be safe and take care this week. You need
know nothing else about me other than that I care about you all and your
saftey and well-being. I want you all to remember that. My love for you all
has no boundaries. Bring your love together for one another now....

Lots of love,

Hey folks. Got a problem. Myself and my roommate are looking for housing. 
You may have read a post from Jason Green a while back looking for "3bdrm 
house for 3 professional males" well that is now 2 professional males Jason 
has decided not to move right now. This leaves me and my roommate in a 
predicament. We NEED A PLACE. 2bdrm or 3bdrm can be afforded. Keep in mind 
that we have 2cats and one small lovable dog. Also we NEED a tekno friendly 
environment as I spin. If anyone knows a possible option for us please 
respond as we have already put notice in to move out of our current location 
by Jan. 1rst.

I left my mail for a day and GREAT SCOTT!

But I think I'm gonna stick my foot in this long tirade.

The last few times I've gone down to the city all I've been thinking of so
many things (where's my life going, do I want to transfer to SF, the
nature of friendship, you know that intense stuff that everyone thinks
about) and something I've really been thinking about is the ever present
"Ah, but what is a rave really?"

Now, really what is this thang all about? I had such ideals when I first
started partying. But has taken me a while to realize that people are
people-- everyone has their goddamn mannerisms, or faults, or however you
want to take it. Yet people (individuals) fail to realize that they are
people too. "The world is such a cruel place...", and the only -good-
individuals are themselves and their friends. What I guess I'm trying to
say is that jumping onto a purist platform doesn't resolve much; everyone
is massively hypocritical, everyone 
has a tinge of racism (don't try to deny it, we live in a racially 
tense society and you're going to pick it up).

I asked a friend of mine once, -when did you consider yourself a raver?
He said that he didn't consider himself a raver until a few parties ago,
when he had fully been alive in the music -sober- (and this guy has been
partying a long time). I thought that was so beautiful--anything "plur"
was his own, he didn't need to be a raver to be plur.

So what is this "plur" thing? If we would truly desire to characterize
ourselves as such, we wouldn't give a shit if people were doin the -honk
honk mack truck- in the chill room. Unity and respect are not juxtaposed
with separatist "idealism". We are an amalgamation of people; therefore it
is -impossible- to tell others what constitutes a rave other than what it
means for yourself. So- argumentation cannot function if it is not
constructive.

Also, the massive thing- I've been to some damn good massives that far
surpass underground "vibey" parties, and vice versa... 

Not sure what I tried to say but...

Northwestern (the one here in Portland, right?) duped my "Soularium" tape
in 1994 and I was quite pleased with it.  Good quality tape, excellent
reproduction and they sent a delivery guy to drop off my order rather
than having to go out and get it (of course, I'm local).

Dear Rob,

	This is fascinating!  When did the giraffes and whales and plants
tell you all this?  Or did you read it in the adventures of Dr. Doolittle
-- no, wait, those books were written by a human!

Much love (& too much sarcasm, probably),        ;)

Dear SFRavefriends,

	I believe the fact that many of us are concerned about this
"destructive impact" is further evidence that we have reached a higher
level of evolution. What other animals (or plants!) worry about protecting
the environment, or whether they may be causing other species to become
extinct?
	With greater ability comes greater capacity for both good and
evil, something we definitely need to keep in mind.
	
Much love,

I've been reading the messages about CW, and how the people on this list 
feel about it, and then that one guy (ray?) trying to defend CW. anyway, 
let me just state a few things. i said before last week that there is no 
way i will go to the upcomming CW because of the price tag. on the other 
hand, at the CW raves i've been to, i had a relative good time. Who ever 
funds and promots CW is in it for a certain market. and the market is 
there. if people didnt want to go to big raves with tons of people, then 
CW would be out of business. perhaps CW will fall if they keep raising 
the price tag of admission. let the market work things out for them. CW 
is the only group of people willing to put a large ammount of money into 
a into their investment. if the returns dont come in, then they will have 
to change how they do things. but for now, they have the market for large 
raves. let the people decide if they want to spend $25-plus on CW. but 
its really no need to bad mouth and complain as much as most people do. 
if you dont like CW, dont go.

on another note, CW also creates a trickle down effect. if first timers 
go to CW, and love it. they are going to be hungry for more raves. they 
will start going to smaller (and perhaps better, as some people would 
say) raves. If these people dont "understand" raves (as some people on 
this list would assume), then the smaller raves would give them the 
dirrection they might need to enjoy small raves. if people feel that only 
a select ammount of people should even go to raves, then thats fucked up, 
and in my opinion (although others will dissagre) is segregation. 

all in all, let the market system work it out for CW. also remember that 
CW helps the total rave community by getting more people involved in raves.

hm. and if i said that Europe didn't exist, 'cuz no one ever told me

(i seen 'em myself!), but maybe you're just not finding out about

the place where i work (graphic design/print/copy place) made copies of
the HUGE stack of news/magazine articles & research on LSD... i managed
to get my hands on a copy. my guess is that it's about 500 or so pages
of photocopied and downloaded articles. interesting reading...

I was mulling around various newsgroups and arcticles and web sites
about drugs, and specifically E.  I ended up reading "E is for Ecstasy"
off of the hyperreal site.  I read this passage in the part about
various people's experiences and it struck me as such a great summary of
what E does to people.

"There's a very basic misunderstanding here about the ways Ecstasy
works. I don't think the drug is manufacturing an experience of love. I
think it is doing something far humbler and more specific than
that. 

It takes fear away.  It is as a consequence of this subtraction of fear
that love appears. "



just thought id share it w/ y'all.

luv,

Hello,  I was wondering if there are other alternatives to driving to
sfraves other than taking a taxi cab.  Going to sfraves has been quite
difficult for me and my friends since we're not used to driving in SF and we
always get lost and going home is even more tedious since I live in the
north bay.  One of my friends suggested that we drive up all the way to
richmond then take the BART from there up to Market and from there we are
thinking of a way other than taking a taxi to whatever map point or venue
we're supposed to go.  Thanks for your time.  PLUR =]

Hi Eric,

	Thanks for the sentiments. My take on all the recent flaming is:

	"Where there is ANGER, there is PAIN,
	 Turn it around & let LOVE live AGAIN"

     I found an interesting article in this month's Details magazine about
21 year-old Sean Shayan who founded and expanded the herbal ecstacy drug
craze. I have to be jealous of this guy who at *my* age has made: $300
million ! Good lord that's alot of money. The article goes on to say how
Sean has never taken a single drug in his life (?) and exposes his long
running scam. After numerous tests were done on some of his products
including; Cloud 9, Magic Mushrooms and Ultimate Xphoria doctors
discovered that taking these drugs were "like drinking 7 cups of coffee or
taking a lot of Sudafed." Sean can't confirm or deny this since he states
that he's never tried any of his products. He's advertised herbal ecstacy
as a safe natural alternative to taking drugs bought on the street.But
according to the FDA, ephedrine ( the main ingredient ) has been linked to
17 deaths and 600 health complaints. We have heard about how MDMA has
caused it's own problems and unfortunatly deaths. But, this guy knows what
he is doing and how can you trust someone who hasn't even felt the effects
of his own product. Again, he's gained a shitload of money from this scam,
but I don't see him ever gaining the public's trust. If you happen to read
this article tell me what you think.

Boy, making an easy $100,000+ by throwing a party sounds great. That's how
much at the least they will make off this. You figure they can get about
around 7000-8000 people maybe more. They expect 15,000 people. There
charging $25-$35 for this party. They will clear more then $200,000 just
off ticket sales, and if all 15,000 people show and only pay $25 they will
get $375,000 off tickets. Selling over priced water and food and booze will
clear even more money. So figure $500,000.  A quarter of a million dollars
mostly on ticket sales alone. I highly dought that the party will cost that
much. Probally more like half that. So an easy $200,000 to $250,000 is
great.. That's not including what the sponsors will be giving them either.
Damn, I'm in the wrong job.  So please tell me it's NOT a money thing.

If my heart wasn't in the right place, I'd be doing it too. But it is in
the right place and I wouldn't be in it for the money. God knows I like to
have money, but not by doing it the way CW does it. Check out there
website..www.coolworldprod.com...and look under attraction....caged
futuristic Go-Go dancers. Erotic/futuristic fasion show..Alien girls with
sugar treats....what the hell is this.


I don't know, it just doesn't sound right to me. Remember, I was using $25
as the price which stopped on the Dec 1st...Now it's $30 until the day of
the event and then $35 at the door. So they may very will get close to the
$1,000,000 mark depending on when people buy tickets.

I don't know, sounds like an over priced, wacked out, let's make the 11
O'clock news again, drug and sex infested night mirror to me. Remember,
these are the promoters of Cyberfest were they made the news for kids
overdosing and being killed at that event. These are facts.  So when people
say that CW sucks, I'll tend to beleive them with those facts backing them
up. There not in it for the people, and certainly not to help the scene any
with those stats.

     this reminds me of the refrigerator.
     
     
     huh?
     
     
     well, you see...back when the refrigerator first came out,
     
     approximately...
     
     25% of the people bought one right away and threw away their icebox.
     25% said "my parents didn't have one, why do I need one"
     25% just didn't want one (they were skeptical)
     25% said "refrigerator?  icebox?  what are those?"
     
     we have now evolved to just about everyone having some type of 
     refrigeration.  now it's "you don't have a refrigerator?"  <---what 
     kind of kook is that?
     
     NOW YOU MAY ASK..."what does that have to do with cool world?"  
     
     well, it's the same type of mentality.  someone filled this world with 
     a substantial number of stupid people (maybe stupid's not the right 
     word, how about people with a low awareness level).  some of these 
     people are the same type of people that say "there's no problem with 
     the environment".  Now I know who you are... (hee hee)
     
     so, there are a lot of consumers out there that will just mindlessly 
     pay $35 to go to one of these events.  i'm not saying it won't be a 
     good party, it might well go off.  these types of massives can be fun 
     a few times a year.  i say let them charge that if they want.  
     
     in order for our society to evolve to one where people in business 
     charge only enough to cover costs and make a little for themselves to 
     live on, it has to be voluntary.  look at the refrigerator.  what 
     shelf are you on?  or do you still have an icebox?

I'm in no way being disrespectful. CW has a poor reputation. Ray Vonie
chooses to believe that it is because everyone has used Cool World as a
scapegoat. Having spoken with several people that have been to Cool World
events, the it seems that the reputation is earned. I am not calling Ray
names, I am not making fun of him, all I am saying is that from what I
have seen and heard, CW has earned its own reputation. Please do not
confuse a negative statement with a disrespecful one.

How much do you know about animals?

How about apes that kill their "stepchildren" when they take over
another apes
	female?  In fact, humans behave the same way?  There was an
	article in Science that examined child abuse.  It turns out that a
	LARGE portion of child abuse if from step-parents (origins of
	"evil stepmothers" in Fairy Tales?).   Step-parents (according
	to this article were 60-70 TIMES more likely to abuse their
	non-biological children than parents their own biological
	off-spring......

How about hyena cubs that kill their own siblings?

This argument is pointless, as we have to trust someone to tell us how
much money is made, as no books will be opened. I'm sorry, but when there
is that much money involved, I would have a hard time trusting certain
family members. There are absurd amounts of money being taken in, you
cannot reasonably dispute that. How that money is distributed, who knows?

CW's books are their business. However, I find no credibility in your
statement without evidence to back it up. There is far too much money
involved.

Thank you for two things. The first is seperating CW from a rave, the
second for being honest about the intentions. This is what is lacking in
the literature CW produces.

Please explain why anyone would make a scapegoat out of CW? Are the people
I have spoken to who had bad experiences at CW events scapegoating CW? 

I would agree that I see a general sense of animosity towards Cool World.
I bear some of that animosity myself. But for what to me is a very real
reason:

CW has taken Raving, and made a spectacle out of it, in order to make a
buck. There is also bad press that has resulted from CW events, which does
us all a disservice, including CW.

If CW were honest about it, they would immediately stop billing their
productions as raves, which they are not, and as you have said as
"entertainment."

Fair enough. But the point still stands. CW exists to bring together
people that can afford the price of admission, and that is not all people.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEEEEEEEEEZ take this "gangsta this gangsta that I'm right
you're wrong" discussion off the list! It's passed the point of being a
valuable educational discourse *long ago*, and if you guys want to keep
arguing off the list that's just super, but I don't think I can deal with
much more of this. There's probably alot of really cool posts getting lost
between the cracks, 'cuz I tend not to read stuff when every other subject
line is "re: shitty post--> blah blah blah."

I'm cross-posting this to the list because you two aren't the only ones
involved, just the most prominent ones.

I know I'm not *even* the final judge on what should/shouldn't be on SFR,
and I know there's a huge gray area, and I know that adidas and gangsta's
and race and creed and shit are all rave-related, but once the discussion
gets so out of hand that every post is a direct comeback to another direct
comeback and the other list members are being ignored while spammed, I
think that's where the gray area ends.

thanks and take care,
-m.

       COEUR D'ALENE, IDAHO - The
                               Associated Press via Individual Inc. : Police
                               were amused when Harlan Collinsworth gave
                               them a list of items stolen from his home: a
                               VCR, a bong used to smoke marijuana and a
                               film canister containing pot. 
                                      - ``We won't generally get lots of calls
                               about stolen controlled substances,'' Capt. Carl
                               Bergh said Monday. 
                                      - When Officer S.W. Childers arrived at
                               Collinsoworth's home Friday in this Idaho
                               panhandle city, Collinsworth showed him a
                               metal container where he'd stored the canister
                               of marijuana. 
                                      - ``While showing me this container, he
                               explained that the suspect had failed to take his
                               marijuana pipe,'' Childers wrote in his report.

  INNOVATION

  What Is Cool? Certainly Not a Campaign for It

  Trends: Although many companies would like to appear 'with it,' the true
  cutting edge emanates from the streets.

  By Gary Chapman

  Copyright 1996, The Los Angeles Times

  Microsoft Corporation has launched a new advertising and public 
relations
  campaign, and the mission, according to some people who work at the
  company's ad agency, Wieden & Kennedy, is a seemingly impossible one: to
  make Microsoft cool.

  "Cool" is the holy grail of the cyber-elite. It's the only word that
  conveys success, that draws crowds in virtual space and that indicates a
  company "gets it," in the cultural vernacular of the times. Cool is
  completely binary -- a company or a Web site is either cool or it's 
dead,
  cold. In cyberspace, "cool" and "hot" are the same thing.

  What is cool? Where does it come from?

  It comes from the streets. And more often than not, it comes from the
  streets of the working poor, especially from the vibrant culture of poor
  African American and Latino kids. It comes from the opposite pole of our
  society than the one Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and his peers 
inhabit.
  Increasingly, immense multinational corporations are dependent, for 
their
  marketing, on the culture of young people who are the losers in the
  Information Age.

  At the recent Conference on Technology, Jobs and Community held at Cal
  State L.A., I spent some time talking with some young hip-hop artists,
  black, white and Latino. Carlos "MARE 139" Rodriguez, a former graffiti
  artist who grew up in the South Bronx, put it rather succinctly: "The
  'soul' of this country has always been rooted in poverty."

  This is an old phenomenon. European bourgeois discovered the vitality of
  urban bohemian culture in the late 19th century, resulting in Puccini's
  great opera, "La Boheme." Harlem's renaissance in the 1920s was due to
  wealthy white patrons spending their time and money in black nightclubs.
  All the forms of that global cultural juggernaut, rock 'n' roll, were
  born in black juke houses in the South or in the ghettos of factory
  cities in the North.

  The predominant cultural expression of the inner city for the last 15
  years, hip-hop, has been a brilliant marriage of street slang and
  technology. Hip-hop got its start in the 1970s when street DJs started
  manipulating records on turntables to produce rhythms and surprising
  collages of sounds and words.

  Hip-hop musicians have absorbed computers and turned them into bold 
music
  machines with sampling, synthesized bass and dense layers of sound and
  expression. Hip-hop swept the suburban world of white youth as much as 
it
  did the mean streets of the ghetto.

  Just as corporations swallowed up the music of the '60s to sell products
  to baby boomers, companies have sanitized hip-hop, punk and surfer
  culture to appeal to the young computer generation. Coca-Cola, perhaps
  the ultimate brand-name standard, has a home page (
  http://www.cocacola.com) that features text of surfer "valley talk" in a
  jagged punk font. One page describes "a guy with a full-body tattoo
  covered with links" -- cyberpunk meets the soft drink business.

  Brett Webb runs a Web site called Art Crimes (http://www.graffiti.org),
  an international database of graffiti art. Webb says he got an offer 
from
  Levi Strauss to buy the entire site.

  It's long been an axiom of cool that whenever something cool shows up in
  commercial use it's no longer cool.

  What is obvious is that the great factories of style and coolness that
  are constantly churning out ideas in places like East L.A., Watts,
  Harlem, the South Bronx and elsewhere are always "pushing the envelope"
  of what mainstream white society will accept. When someone like Dennis
  Rodman starts showing up in TV commercials and People magazine, it's 
time
  to move on to something new.

  But the deepest irony is that the global information economy is pushing
  the working poor of all races to the wall. In previous eras, it was
  possible to have a vital working-class culture that survived on factory
  and service wages. That's no longer true. Despite the recent boost in 
the
  minimum wage, most of the working poor, tens of millions of people, are
  barely making ends meet.

  The fact that billionaires and millionaires are stealing or faking the
  culture and imagery of the ghetto is not lost on the people who live
  there. What was once a mostly happy and carefree hip-hop culture has
  already turned into something angry and dangerous -- gangsta rap, for
  example -- and now that's devolving into something even angrier and more
  confrontational.

  There are edgy fault lines between the artists of the ghetto and
  high-tech imitators of cool that could eventually register on the 
Richter
  scale. Advertising firms may want to make their clients cool, but 
they're
  playing with fire.

It is certainly even more difficult if there is a map point clear across 
town from the location of the rave.  If one relies on bus transportation, 
I could see that taking up another hour or hour and a half.  I plan to 
give up my car when I move there, thank goodness I still know folks who 
have vehicles!  Just my thought, sorry I could not give any solutions...

This reminds me of a birthday present I bought a friend a while back.  I 
was kinda broke at the time, but still wanted to get my friend a birthday 
present.  So I went to my local Safeway, wondered into the Produce 
section, purchased a couple of beets, and gave them to him as "A Couple 
of Phat Beats"

He said it was the best birthday gift he has ever received :)

I might be able to give you a ride.  I drive a toyota pickup.  So if your
record crate could sit in the middle or on the floor I could take you.
Whats the agenda for tonight?

I live very close to you.  I live right by Mitty high school.  I met Mat
last night at City Expresso.  I believe thats your roommate, right?  I also
met Lee and Sharon (I think that was her name, she had the rather large

Anyways, let me know!

     Who are we to say that we know better than 15,000 people?
     
     If people will pay $25-$35 to spend an evening having safe sex with 
     aliens, watching fire breathing whatnot and seeing two hundred DJ's 
     and live acts in eight hours, let em.
     
     If Cool World had such a bad reputation, they would change their name 
     to something new and continue to do business.  I for one have met 
     people who are excited about going, and I honestly hope they have fun. 
      Not everybody enjoys weird parties with one blacklight on a beach and 
     two DJ's playing trance all night long.  We're all different.
     
     Vlad (Ray Vonie) has been very cool with me as he has been with most 
     of us, if only in e-mail.  He seems to understand what being nice and 
     respectful is all about.  Even when we're raking him over the coals he 
     takes it in pretty good stride (except that spelling!  Egad!).  The 
     parties (both FGE and Cool world) seem well organized considering 
     their size and what a soft target they are for police, nobody runs out 
     of toilet paper, and Joe and Joanna Average can have a damn good time 
     there.  It's probably less unwholesomely profitable than Disneyland or 
     running a store that sells sportswear with a ridiculously high mark 
     up, and Cool World tries to make people smile and laugh and remember 
     what they did for New Year's for a change, rather than another boring 
     evening at a house party with their alcoholic high school buddies.
     
     We should treat our massive promoters with some respect (remember 
     PLUR, I think that might apply to everybody, even massive 
     promoters)... they are the ones who are going to have lawyers and 
     loopholes and pave the way for obtaining permits and maybe even prove 
     to people that big parties can be fun, positive and profitable for 
     promoters.  Massive promoters probably will never have a monopoly on 
     parties, because there is a hardcore group of people who will always 
     like smaller parties of various styles.
     
     Am I going?  No.  It's not really my thing, but that shouldn't affect 
     anybody else's decision.  We're all big kids here.
     
     If you're going, bring a smile.  Have a good time.  If there's no vibe 
     get to work on getting one going with the people around you.  I've 
     seen some amazing things and I'd love to read a review where some 
     people had a great time and got things going for others.
     
     If you think Cool World is only in it for the money, don't pay to go.  
     Duh, that's how to hurt a business after all... it's cool to be 
     anti-profit, but it would be damn hard to find E, acid, blowpops, GHB, 
     bodypaint, chai or any of the other consumables we embrace without 
     considerable markup (like 300%+).  Buy what you like, don't buy what 
     you don't like.
     
     We keep talking about how positive and vibey we are and I open my mail 
     to bitch bitch bitch every day.  Talking shit about a party that 
     hasn't even happened yet isn't about Love, Unity or Respect.  It would 
     be pretty nice to be able to make a living for me and some friends by 
     throwing parties that allowed people to feel the way I did at the 
     first party that worked for me.  I mean, if only 1% of the people at 
     Cool World end up "getting it", that's 150 more people that will be of 
     definite benefit to the scene.  How could that be bad?
     
     I haven't been in the scene for long at all, and maybe that undermines 
     my opinion, but I think this raving stuff shouldn't be a treehouse

Please circulate this and perhaps by the time Christmas comes,  everyone 
will have read it.  
 
                         DEATH OF AN INNOCENT 
 
I went to a party, Mum, I remembered what you said. 
You told me not to drink, Mum, so I drank coke instead. 
I really felt proud inside, Mum, the way you said I would. 
I didn't drink and drive, Mum, even though the others said I should. 
 
I know I did the right thing, Mum, I know you are always right. 
Now the party is finally ending, Mum, as everyone is driving out of sight. 
As I got into my car, Mum, I knew I'd get home in one piece. 
Because of the way you raised me, so responsible and sweet. 
 
I started to drive away, Mum, but as I pulled out into the road, 
the other car didn't see me, Mum, and hit me like a load. 
As I lay there on the pavement, Mum, I hear the policeman say, 
the other guy is drunk, Mum, and now I'm the one who will pay. 
 
I'm lying here dying, Mum.  I wish you'd get here soon. 
How could this happen to me, Mum?  My life just burst like a balloon. 
There is blood all around me, Mum, and most of it is mine. 
I hear the paramedic say, Mum, I'll die in a short time. 
 
I just wanted to tell you, Mum, I swear I didn't drink. 
It was the others, Mum.  The others didn't think. 
He was probably at the same party as I. 
The only difference is, he drank and I will die. 
 
Why do people drink, Mum?  It can ruin your whole life. 
I'm feeling sharp pains now.  Pains just like a knife. 
The guy who hit me is walking, Mum, and I don't think it's fair. 
I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare. 
 
Tell my brother not to cry, Mum.  Tell Daddy to be brave. 
And when I go to heaven, Mum, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave 
Someone should have told him, Mum, not to drink and drive. 
If only they had told him, Mum, I would still be alive. 
 
My breath is getting shorter, Mum.  I'm becoming very scared. 
Please don't cry for me, Mum.  When I needed you, you were always there. 
I have one last question, Mum, before I say good bye. 
I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die? 
 
            ************************ 
Someone took the effort to write this poem. 
 
So please, forward this to as many people as you can. And see if we can get 
a chain going around the world that will make people understand that 
drinking and driving don't mix. 
 
TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, so please forward this letter to as many 
people as you can.

I wrote something about CW parties the other day and you responded to me
as if I was saying that only ravers can attend raves. Well if you knew
how to read you would of read that I said.....
I don't want you to think that I'm saying that only ravers can attend
raves. Because I believe that anyone can attend a rave just as long as
they don't ruin the vibe and they spread love. Ravers would never
excluded anyone because of who or what they are. We are always open to
new things and new people. But not if they are going to affect us. But
all we  ask is if you do attend a rave and know nothing of the subject
just respect us and those who surround us and keep the vibe alive. 
	
	The reason I take this so personally is because a RAVE is not
just something to do on the weekends or just to be cool. A RAVE is a way
of my life, a way I choose to live. It is a part of me so are all of you
beautiful people who rave out there. Everytime I go to a RAVE i go decked
out in my biggest bell bottem  plaid pants or my homade clothes and my
clunky platform shoes. I smear my eyelids with glitter and stickers
aglore. I stuff the blue teddy bear  back pack (My friend Paul made) with
stickers, candy, glowsticks, and anything eles I can imagin to give away
to all the beautiful Ravers. I don't know about anyone eles but when I'm
at a rave and I see all the wonderful people having fun and smiling and
spreading love and expressing themselves through dance. It makes me feel
so good about who I am and what I do. I love raving and I never want to
stop. THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE who attend CW parties are there just to
be cool or to do something that weekend. They ruin the vibe and don't
spread love, they have a bad atitude about the whole situation. This to a
raver is dissapointing to see this, and brings them down. I had a friend
who drove from Sac. to go to Mega Buzz and paid $25 and left a 1:00
because they were not having a good time. A rave is a place where PEOPLE
or RAVERS go to get away from the cruelness of the outside world. And be
able to meet new people and enjoy themselves without having to worry
about what others think or feel towards them because at raves everyone
loves one another. And when a raver goes to a rave to do this and feel
good about themselves and to spread love, and they see the vibe being
ruin, and the scene being disrespected or TAKEN FOR GRANTED. This is a
wound in the heart and we don't take it lightly. Because if you are
hurting the scene you are also hurting apart of all ravers. 
Thank you I hope you don't take any offense. 
may love and great things come to you all  
PLUR
Smile always
Smile I love :)
Never frown
Love always Victoria :)

Hi. I know the message of this poem is critical, but it has been posted to
this list at least 3 times in the past few months. I'm sure it's been
circulated three times around the world by now. :)

I agree. AT Mega Buzz a CW party my friend put her bag on the ground for
a second and turned to say hi to someone and the turned back around and
her bag was gone. Just like that. She immediatly found us and told us
what happened while sobbing on my shoulder. We rushed to the front the
main entrance where all the CW people were. We told them what had
happened and got no help what so ever. I myself asked the rent a cop for
his flash light and had to shove and yell and threat my way back into the
party. After they had known what I was doing they wanted me to pay to re
enter the party. Even though my friends bag was still in there.  Finally
after some arguing with the gut he let me in. While my friend watched
people as they left to see if her bag was near. I then Searched each room
up and down and all around for the bag. Still we haven't got any help
from the CW people. From about 2:30 am to about 5:00 am I searched for
the bag, each room over and over again. Till finally I found the bag. I
was so relived. I ran as fast as I could to return the bag to my friend. 
Now I want you all to know that her car keys were in the bag. We would
have no ride home If we didn't find the bag. But CW people still didn't
care. Finally after my friend had been harrassed by the CW people se
searched her bag to see what was missing she had $100 stolen from her.
Very dissapointed and rudely upset we drove home after paying $25. This
proves that you don't give a dam about the party or people, only the
money. If this were at any other party ecspcially HARMONY this would of
never happened and if it did we would get more help. But most likley it
wouldn't .

In response to your comment on aliens.. Haven't they been here always
influencing our lives through religion.  What I mean is who were the Gods
and Godessess anyways?  And what about the Jehovah who rescued the
Israelites from the land of Egypt?

And if they are here and if they have been here for some time, they are not
really aliens or extra-terrestrials are they?  The word alien is almost
another discriminating word that we humans have created to seperate us from
everything else.  If the goal is to come together back into some sense of
unity and oneness with everthing than we have to include the cosmos and
everything in it or else we will always be seperate from something.

Just out of curiosity did you or anyone find any information on the CIA's
use of LSD and psilocybin mushrooms for mind control experiments?
Apparently Timothy Leary got his first knowledge of LSD by volunteering for
these types of experiments.

> Today DEC 5th is the birthday of Walt Disney...just thought
> I'd tell everyone.

Great! Let's celebrate the birthday of a well-known racist and
anti-semite.

As far as I'm concerned, the fucking bastard can rot in hell. W/r/t 
Disney's works, yes, there's some great Disney art, but that was
produced by talented artists who labored in relative poverty and
anonimity, while Disney profited off their sweat and took all the
credit. Then he used all his money and power to incorporate  anti-black
and anti-semitic sentiments into the Disney Corporation, while turning
in every jew he didn't like to the McCarthy witch hunts as a "communist
sympathizer." Such a sweet and loving man, he!

What next, an NRR post celebrating David Duke's birthday?  Hey, what
about Jerry Falwell, he's a man who righteously defends PLUR!

PS: If I see one more PLUR-spouter talking about how HOMIES shouldn't
be at raves, the stark fist of removal is going to plunge so far up
your ass you'll need a speculum to brush your teeth. What next, you're
going to say that KAIKS or WOPS or SPICS can't be at raves! I'm getting
the feeling that when anybody mentions PLUR on this list, they might as
well stick a stamp on their forehead saying kick me, I'm an ignorant
racist doofus. Why don't you do us all a favor and shove yer glowstick
where the sun don't shine to enlighten yourself. We don't even need to
worry ourselves with racist code-words like "gangsta" when you got
people unabashedly dissing "HOMIES" as being un-ravey. If "HOMIES" are
unravey, then I certainly don't want to be a raver.

Well, it was a strange nite. Voodoo lounge was having some leak-problems,
so there was a bucket in the middle of the dance floor. Sound was off and
on, too. Regardless, I had a blast hearing Hannibal Selecta and Tomas play
some booming deep tunes.

Thad played a short set around 12:30, but was having technical difficulties
with  one of the decks. The hi-point for me was when he dropped
his own dubplate, and though the sound made it seem a bit muddled, it was
great. There's a bunch of dj's making their own tracks and paying 30-40
dollars to get them pressed themselves (1 copy). This is exactly what we
need to help create our own grass-roots jungle scene in the states. 

-peace-

Here we go; it's biological evolution on the line, so I gotta' get
involved... (WARNING: COMPLETELY NRR!! AND LONG!!)

Animals (and, yes, humans) that attack step-children/cubs/what-have-you,
do so because, unfortunately, this means that if/when they actually have
their own children with their mate, then their own children (and hence
their own genetic pool) will receive that much more attention and
sustinence from both parents (i.e. breast milk in primates), than they
would if the step-children were still in the picture.  No, the animals
don't sit around and actually *think* this (because evolution doesn't
*think*, it *responds*); it's just that animals (in the wild) that engage
in this behavior tend to have more of their own genes survive through
their progeny than animals that don't.  Why else would the trait be
present?  

Now this may seem silly in such a modern society of convenience as ours,
where hunger (at least in the "first"-world) and predation are 
considerably less significant than they were when we were living in the
wild.  But if you consider a situation where food is scarce, and
malnutrition can lead to a host of fatal diseases, every head takes up
that much more food that your own progeny could use.  Yes, I personally
find it sick, twisted, and terribly depressing, but evolution doesn't
care about ethics. Ethics are human notions.  Evolution is but a process,
where the most successful make more copies of themselves.  (I believe
that's why we as humans developed civilization in the first place, in
hopes of staving off some of the harshness of this "unethical" pure
natural selection.)

I believe that this human step-child abuse phenomenon is a hazy vestigial 
aftereffect of this trend in our primal evolution, but that is no longer
necessary or even fit in a modern society, due to the protection and
provisions civilization allows for (not to mention, it's mean!).
Unfortunately, evolution is *very* slow (given our generation time, on the
order of millions or at the very least tens of thousands of years), and
there has not been sufficient time to weed out the trait completely.  But
4000 years is a fairly good chunk of time (i.e. since the beginnings of
civilization, more or less), and these tendencies undoubtedly have been
slowly disappearing as the years progress (since there is really no
selective pressure for them at all anymore).  Most importantly, though,
(to end on a brighter note), fortunately, our minds, as humans, are
sufficiently advanced that many of us can control our instincts (to some
degree).  So anytime we feel an emotion, we don't necessarily act
whole-heartedly on it, without at least considering the consequences,
aftermath, etc.
Well, I've rambled on enough. ;)  I'd love comments, etc.  plur-

Joe

How about "Email that Spammed the Innocents"

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much.....It's too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)

     Fortunately I have reconfigured my positronic matrix to look through 
     the posts on sfravers (I've met some absolutely WONDERFUL people on 
     this list, too :) and decide if the post has a negative connotation or 
     is just plain too negative my brain now goes "ehh.  too negative.  
     NEXT."  
     
     y'all need to take a lesson from the farmer.  life is like a farm.  
     we'll get to that tomorrwo.  
     
     anyway, do you want to know how to program your positronic matrix 
     (yes, you all have one, Mr. Data is not that out of the ordinary)
     
     yeah, i'll bet you would.  email me privately if you want to know the 
     REAL secret.  talk to you tomorrow, happy clan!

hello everyone-

this post is totally non rave related (flame me now, if you wish!)

sometimes i like disney films (flame me now, if you wish!)

sometimes i take drugs at raves (flame me now, if you wish!)

sometimes i go sober to raves (flame me now, if you wish!)

sometimes i may make a snap judgement about someone's character by their
exterior appearance (flame me now, if you wish!)

sometimes i ignore their appearance, and talk to them (flame me now, if you
wish!)

so, if you're still reading this and you haven't flamed me yet,

I love you!

have a wonderful day!

love-

matt

 Well I'll miss you Tim!!  =(

 Yea, Neil was way out of line. He could have shared info with us about 
Walt without being just plain nasty about it. As a result anything he has 
to say I'm not going to want to listen to.

 Tim has been one of the most generous and giving, loving people I have 
ever run into, and has done so much (selflessly) for our scene. I love 
Tim and wish there were a milliion more of him around. Tim did not 
deserve what Neil threw his way and I feel he owes Tim an apology.
 
 I don't know what is eating at Neil but I hope he gets over it. I almost 
wonder if that was really Neil who posted?

Since there seems to be a bunch of new people on the list, and several
who seem to be bickering...I think it's about time to bust out with
another set of SFRaves laminates!

I'll be printing up a small batch to distribute at The Gathering on Dec.
21st. They'll be free...It's Christmas!!

Sometimes people can come off so intimidating and mean over email, but
in person I know you are all a bunch of crazy-silly-wacky and very PLURY
people.

Like Troy Sheets said to me once, "I've never met a net-raver I didn't
like".

So come find me there, I'll post a description a day or so before.

As far as the current state of the list, I am extremely heartbroken.
This list has done so much for so many people's lives...it's brought so
many of us together. You are all my closest friends, and it hurts me to
see my family fight like this. This is ridiculous!! I love you guys!!
Why else would I drive 9 hours every other week so I can see all of
you??!?!?? So let's stop it, NOW!! OKAY!?!? 

Here's a digital hug for all of you that I originally received from
Sarvi long ago. Please forward it to anyone on the list that you would
like to apologize or give you love to:
                                                  
                           EVERYONE NEEDS A HUG!!!!!

hello all-

for the sfraves scene, tim has:

1)selflessly organized multiple barbeques

2)offered his cooking services/equipment to any happy raver who wishes to use it

3)been an active member of the sfraves community for quite a while before
many of us were even thinking or raving

4)stood out in the rain so that ravers could come and eat, dance, and enjoy
each other at pt. malate.


so, let it be heard that:

tim is a cool guy.
tim is a key member of the sfraves community.
give the boy some respect.

love-

Don't leave us. This list has turned into something it was never intended to
be, a NON-RAVE RELATED waste of bandwidth. You, knucklehead, are one of the
people that I like reading posts from. Instead of leaving, please stay and
help us bring back the good old days when the posts on this list were about
rave and music, not shitty poems and our theories on the existence of=
 aliens.

actually, i never singled *YOU* out. i purposefully kept your name out
of it when posting about walt disney 'cause it's very likely you don't
know his history and are just referring to his companies' animated
movies (which i too admit to liking). i wasn't flaming *you* I was
flaming walt disney.

though, to tell you the truth, the fact that it's walt disney's
birthday is about as NRR as you can get, and so was my reply. but if
you're going to bring up walt disney as something even vaguely rave
related, I feel compelled to indicate that the man himself was the
antithesis of rave. about the only relation i can think of is that
occasionally people project "fantasia" for rave light shows. now what
the hell does walt disney's birthday have to do with that?

w/r/t the other ranting, i was referring to the posts of
plur@somethingorother who keeps going on and on about HOMIES in his
posts (and his web site) while spouting a bunch of crap about how
people just need to fully accept PLUR and they'll be REAL RAVERS! This
just further fuels my belief that people that talk about PLUR are
hypocrites first, and ravers second. Not that I have any idea what
"raver" means. i agree with JSL, it's about music and dance... "it's
just a party"...

Replace every mention of PLUR on this list with "take jesus into your
heart" and y'all begin to sound just like a bunch of baptists at a
revival, and that, I find sickening.

Ok folks,

This is to let you all know that I've had it with this list. I'm on several
other mailinglists (the Goa-list and two Swedish rave-lists), and I get more
SHITTY, NON-RAVE RELATED posts from SFRaves in a day than I get from the 3
other lists in a month. Let's see, today we got Aliens, a shitty poem about
drinking, discussions about Disney's b-day (with an OUTRAGEOUS reply that=
 had
absolutely no place on this list), the possibility of waterslides as a means
of transportation, and probably something that I MANAGED to miss. (That=
 CTRL-D
combination is very useful these days...)
What am I trying to say? Well, to me, this list is not a place to post your
theories on aliens or attack innocent ravers over Walt Disney being a racist
or not. This is a place to post things about RAVES, CLUBS, AND ANYTHING=
 MUSIC-
RELATED. (Perhaps if you look at the name, SF RAVES, long enough the penny
will
fall down...)

Well, just thought I'd get that off my chest before I sign off.

reespect and hugs to the people who deserve it,
jonas

Bandwidth is simply a measure of how much information can be conveyed
over a given channel in a unit measure of time.  Often referred to as
"bits
per second".   Since ANY type of information today (video, audio, text)
can be
sent "digitally" as packets of numbers over computer networks, the
higher
the bandwidth the faster data can be sent....

See Claude Shannon and Information Theory:

"A graduate of Michigan, he went to MIT where he wrote a thesis on the
use of Boole's algebra to analyse and optimise relay switching circuits.
He
joined Bell Telephones in 1941 as a research mathematician. He published
A Mathematical Theory of Communication in 1949. His work founded
the subject of information theory."

	Interestingly  (to me anyway!), the more random the data the
	higher the information content.  Therefore, totally random
	data has the highest information content of all!

According to numerous sources, this is not correct. Timothey Leary got his
first knowledge of LSD from a person referred to him by a friend. I believe
it was Michael Beresford, though I will have to look this up. This was the
guy with the mayonaise jar filled with water, powdered sugar, and 1/2 gram
of LSD. Leary was said to have had his first acid trip by taking a spoonful
of this concoction, which I calculated to be about 2-3000 Mics or 2-3
miligrams!! He had been doing numerous psilocybin experiments at the time,
but this affected him so profoundly he gave up other psychedelics after
that.

On the other hand, your are correct when you state the CIA, FBI, DOD and
many other government organizations did mind control/interrogation research
using just about every psychoactive chemical known to man, including LSD. I
found it somewhat interesting that they tested using THC (the active
ingredient in marijuana) as an interrogation tool, but quickly gave up. It
took them longer to give up on LSD. Check out the excellent books "Acid
Dreams" or "Storming Heaven" or email for more info.

Now back to your regularly scheduled raving.

It is possible for a person to dress out of class.  But you would not.
People dress the way there friends do; in order to 'fit in' like I said.
 Everything you describe is so typical for a person your age, the Bay
Area, the California look.  Put on a power business suite; see if you
can fit in a rave.  Did you happen to go to that guy Greg's Birthday
party a few months ago.  Everybody there was in standard rave dress; but
some guy was wearing a power suite (I assume he had been else where and
was checking out Greg's party along with others).  The suit just did not
make it.  Period.  But the suit would do well talking to a hiring
manager at TRW.  Of course people wear different cloths.  Depends on the
occasion; what you want to communicate to the person your trying to
communicate with.

My main point is your clothes; looks; the way you speak.  It is used by
others to evaluate if your a threat, a potential friend, etc.  A cop can
look at the occupants of a car and almost tell if they are likely to
have dope in the car.  It's almost common sense.  The cop looks you over
and decides how to react to you.  Everybody does that.    You might want
to say, "oh how unfair"  Yes it is.  Do you think life is fair ?

Talk to people who hang out on the street a lot.  The Haight street
crowd for example, or a homeless.  They get quite good at figuring out
if the person walking towards them is going to be a problem.  I am not
going to write thousands of pages of text to say "if this then that."  I
am not sure you can quantify it at all.  But it's there, people do use
it.  A cop see's a man and he makes a decision to shove the guy against
the wall and spread his legs if the guy has a certain 'look'.  Or simply
asked the guy for some ID if he has another look.  The cop acts like
that because hundreds of times in his experience; people who look a
certain way act a certain way.  Do you find it hard to believe a guy
going down the street with a beard; hair to his ass; a backpack; weird
clothes is more likely to have dope on his person then a guy who looks
like the people you see on TV advertising cars ?  TV  and movies are
quite good at 'casting' people.

In fact; to me; it's common sense to read how somebody looks and deal
with them on terms based on how they look.

	Jesus was a Jew who preached Love.  Loving your
	enemies is a concept that even today, 2000 years later,
	is too revolutionary a concept for many to grasp.

	One should not reject the message because of the messenger.

	Whether you believe in the divinity of Jesus or not, the concept
	of Love without reservation is one that Humans STILL have to
	learn.....

	Likewise, whether Disney was good or evil should say nothing
	about whether his Art was good or not.....  I find in general it's
	best to not inquire too deeply about ANYONE whose work
	you respect because you will find that they are ALL FLAWED.....

	Raving is supposed to about MORE than just dancing and
	having a party.  Otherwise, why is Raving any different or any
	better than ballroom dancing to Lawrence Welk?

(Doug says that Timothy didn't get it from the CIA.)

However, Ken Keasey (of Merry Pranksters and Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test
fame) got turned on to acid in the early 1960s when he was administered
the drug at the VA hospital in Palo Alto.

Yeah, it was pretty cool meeting living bodies behind the screen pixels.
Hope we have more of these. A scene can't live by computers alone! I'm
sorry I don't remember everyone's name, but a big "Hi y'all!" to ya.

Just in case anyone cares, a good chunk of the time was spend bemoaning the
pitiful club scene in the South Bay. Mucho jealousy of SF residents who
don't have to drive > 1  hour to go to a fine event. If anyone wants to
discuss plans for South Bay events, knows of any venues/spaces that would
be available to do such a thing, or whatever, please let me know!

Anyways, I hope to see you all again for another fine meal. Maybe Asian
next time?

Supposed to?  According to whom?  And why is it an issue that raving is
better than something?  Did you have fun at the last rave you went to?  If
so, what more justification do you need for going than that?

I've been going to parties since 1991 -- I attended the first rave ever
thrown in Houston, TX, and have not looked back since.  PLUR was nowhere
in sight then -- I anxiously awaited the weekend parties to *dance*, to
stomp my feet to fat beats, to have a good time, basically.

This notion of PLUR has emerged I'd say within the last two years.

Ultimately, I think "plur" is bad for raving.  Why?  Because it's a
pigeon-hole.  Because once you've categorized yourself like that, you're
doomed to be exploited until the thing you love is dead.  Why does the
underground continue to survive?  Because it has no face -- it has
no quick, one-line summary.

Now, raving is far from underground, but when we start seeing PLUR-like
video montages on MTV and this list erupts with complaints that "they're
ruining our scene", I'm going to say, what did you expect?  Professing
that raves are all about *this* (gesturing to PLUR) is essentially handing
yourself over to be exploited.

As far as Neils' post goes, perhaps he was a bit rough.  But he's got an
excellent point: replace "plur" with "jesus" in your standard-fare sfraves
post and you've got yourself a religious zealot.

Regarding the conversations about SFR seeming like a "social circle" or "clique"
... some interesting points were brought up ...  and ... surprise, surprise... I
have something to add!

I can see the point that the social aspect of the group can seem alienating if
you didn't go to a certain place, meet certain people, whatever -- There are
lots of people on this list who don't live in the Bay Area, or can't go out
often because of schedules, school, finances, etc.... 

But I for one am VERY THANKFUL for the opportunity to meet so many people with
whom I have one huge thing in common ... we love the music, we love the vibe.  

The SFR picnic for me was an example of that -- it was like going to a family
reunion where you don't really know all the people who are there, but you have
an undeniable common thread, so there's never a question of whether you belong
there or not.  If you're there, you belong.

When I post what I'm wearing, it's my sincere invitation for any SFRaver to come
up to me and introduce themselves, so we can meet face to face.  I love that.
When I post after a party and list the people I met, it's my way of saying
"thank you for being part of one of the most important nights of my week" to
those people (sometimes because I wasn't able to express that in person at the
party for whatever reason, mental incapacity/ sound too loud/ got lost,
whatever).

For those of you who feel like you're on the outside looking into a smaller
group, come on in!  There's no secret password, there's no attitude, everyone is
part of this family if they want to be .. and there's still plenty of room for
your own individuality in the group, too.
 
Don't want to post?  You don't have to, but it's a good idea, because then we
get to recognize your name and know a little about you when we meet in person.
Even if you're not ready to post, seek out someone you recognize as an SFRaver
when you're out, because you'll quickly discover the warm welcome you'll
receive!

A friend of mine sent this to me today.  I'd like to share it with my old
friends, my current friends, and my future friends.

peacelovejoy,

David

p.s. - Happy Birthday Steph and Tony!!!

                               Friends

   It all started so innocently.  We met as strangers, thrown
together by fate.  Some of you grow up with me, others I have only
known a short while.  Some of you I have hugged constantly over the
years, and others I met at a time when hugging was 'un-cool', and
it has stayed that way, though the times have changed around us.
Some of you I have not yet met in person.
   Every one of you has enriched my life.  You have helped to teach me, to
guide me on this often turning and forking road of life.  You have
been with me through the good times and the bad.  You have comforted
me when I cried,  held me when I was afraid, and laughed with me when
I was happy.
   And now we are in college.  And though the distance between us is
not great, it is great enough.  I am no longer afraid to reach out
and hug you, in fact I long to do it.
   You had walked with me for so long that I was afraid to venture on
alone. Yet even as I feared the dark of night, along came others to
help me on my journey, in hopes that I would walk with them so they
need not journey on alone.  They picked up where you left off, and
now they are no longer strangers.
   Who are you? You might be my brother, my sister, my cousin, an
old aquanitnce or a new one.  But first and foremost, I call you
friend.  And I miss you if you are away, and if you are here, then I
thank you for standing by my side.
   And so I send you this, so that you might know that someone,
somewhere, is thinking of you, praying for you, and loveing you.  And
that person is me.   May God grant you peace and happyness in your
times of trail, and watch over you, so that one day we will meet
again.

   Friendship is a strange thing....we find ourselves telling each other the
deepest details of our lives...things we don't even share with our families
who raised us...But what is a friend? A confidant? A lover? A fellow email
junkie? A shoulder to cry on? an ear to listen? a heart to feel?...A friend
is all these things...and more.
...Whether we met IRL, over The World, over Resort, or SE, or anywhere...I
call you friend. A word so small...yet so large in feeling...a word filled
with emotion. It is true great things come in small packages. Once the
package of friendship has been opened, it can never be closed...it is a
constant book always written...waiting to be read...and enjoyed.
We may have our disagreements...we may argue...we may concern one
another...friendship is a unique bond that lasts through it all....
........A part of me is put into my friends...some it is my humor...some it
is my listening ear...some it is real life experiences...some it is my
romanticism...but with all, it is friendship.
...................Friendships forged are a construct stronger than steel...
built as a foundation....necessary for life...and necessary for love.
Friends...you and me...
..you brought another friend...and then there were 3...
....we started our group....Our circle of friends...
.....and like that circle...there is no beginning or end....

Here is a tale of ravers in love...of a boy and girl going to a rave
together with a mutual friend...and the boy warming the girl's heart with
his floppy hat and big happy smile, and how he ran all around the party in
glee and bounced up and down on the dance floor...and the two then going to
Sunset, and Mad, and Chrysalis...of sitting in a car the morning after for
four hours, still soaked in sweat and covered in sparkles, discovering that
the love they shared for raving was based on their deepest personal beliefs
and experiences, and the bond that created between them...of touching each
other for the first time with Orbital playing softly in the background...of
knowing that they found each other because of the openness of their hearts
and the willingness to give love a chance...

RIGHT ON JESSICA! -- I think I'll typeset this and post it at my desk and on my
bulletin board at home.... and if I get it really together, make some up to
bring to Chrysalis to share ...  thank you!

Yes, I'll be there!  That will perhaps give me an opportunity for:
receiving my chart, introducing Sara and Cheyenne, giving you a massage,
talking about my difficulty with homosexuality, and sharing more love and
positive vibes (and maybe a puff or two ;))!

I was flipping through a book the other day and I found something that I 
thought was totally true and beautiful-and all though its not exactly 
rave related- I think it after all the negativity being 
posted as of late, I thought we could all use a good dose of something 
positive...  

The guide to what is essential..

1.  Right knowledge:  to supply you with the tools necessary for your voyage

2.  Wisdom:  to assure that you are using the accumulated knowledge of 
the past in a manner that will best serve the dicovery of your presence, 
your "now."

3.  Compassion:  to help you accept others whose ways may be different 
from yours, with gentleness and understanding, as you move with them or 
through them or around them on your own way.

4.  Harmony:  to be able to accept the natural flow of life

5.  creativity:  to help you to realize and recognize new alternatives 
and unchartered paths along the way

6.  Strength:  to stand up against fear and move forward in spite of 
uncertainty, without guarantee or payment.

7.  Peace, to keep you centered

8.  Joy:  to keep you songful and laughing and dancing all along the way.

9.  Love:  to be your continual guide towards the highest level of 
consciousness of which man is capable.

                        AND FINALLY, MY FAVORITE...

10.  Unity:  which brings us back to where we started- the place where we 
are at one with ourselves and with all things....


smiles and love,
-jessica

Hi!  This is Thomas.  I'm one of SDream's hamstas.  Since SDream is still 
really upset about his camera being stolen, he doesn't want to write a 
review of Harmony's 3 year anniversary.  Me and the other hamstas had such a 
great time, and we feel so bad for him, we decided to write a review ourselves.

We caught a ride in SDream's backpack (as usual).  At one point we knew we 
weren't in the car anymore but we were in some kind of vehicle.   We sent 
Spaz topside to figure out what was going on.  He said we were on a school 
bus!  There was a cool couple in front of us talking to SDream and Marty.  
Marty is the cool girl that lives in Fresno.  She comes up and parties with 
SDream now and then.  She's really cool, with long curly red hair.  She 
brings us peanuts and sneaks them to us when SDream isn't looking.   Anyway, 
there was also this cool dog on the bus named Amber.   She was the coolest 
rave dog we've ever seen, with sparkles in her fur.

After a while we came to a stop, so we sent Spaz up to look around again.  
He came back down, his eyes huge!  "Dood!", he says, "It's SO COOL!"  We all 
looked at each other and then scrambled to see what was up!  We were all 
hanging out every available opening in SDream's backpack as he walked 
around.  The main room was classic Harmony, with fantastic artwork and the 
best music you've ever heard!  Spaz couldn't wait -- he jumped down, 
scrambled up one of the speakers, and started bopping like crazy!  I think 
he stayed there the whole night, bumming water off other ravers and 
worshipping the best visuals in the rave scene!

Then we headed out to where the tent city was.  Wow!  Life size hamsta 
nests!  People would wiggle in through the holes, nibble on some goodies, 
hang out, curl up, sleep for a while, then wiggle back out to dance some 
more!  Tim K. was there, and Tony R.  We were waving at all the little rave 
kiddies, but we didn't want to venture out just yet.

SDream walked over and checked out the chill space.  It was the best chill 
space we've seen!  SDream found Eric P. there -- Eric is so cool!  Brownie 
and Grumpy jumped ship at that point and spent the better part of the 
evening doing a slow groove to funky slow beats.  I guess they caught the 
live performances.  We wanted to see them but we didn't get back in time.  
At one point this girl's necklace broke, and Brownie and a bunch of other 
ravers helped pick up the pieces.  Isn't it cool how everyone helps each 
other out?  Then they spent part of the evening sneaking up on people that 
were almost dozing off and jumping up and down and squeezing their 
shoulders.  Of course, to a people raver, this feels like a backrub.  Then 
the person would turn around to see who it was and Brownie and Grumpy would 
jump down and run off before they were seen.

At this point the rest of us jumped down and started doing our own 
explorations. 

We found the "Fairy Ring", a tight ring of huge redwoods with chairs and 
Christmas lights in the middle.  Tiny crawled up and turned on the Christmas 
carol boxes, but after a while the people ravers turned them back off (thank 
goodness).  It was beautiful, a truly incredible touch.

We danced with Rikki in the main room, raced around Kirsten's silver tennies 
(very quickly -- she really goes crazy, jumping around and stuff), and we 
hitched a ride in Marcy's Dr. Seuss hat (it looked a lot like SDream's if 
you ask me).  Several of us came to the conclusion that Kirsten was in fact 
the embodiment of the Rave Goddess!  At one point I looked up and saw Spaz 
circle dancing on top of Wayne's head.  Twinkletoes and Starchild were 
discussing libertarian issues and sharing a doobie in the corner.  

CTD and Rlunatic were looking around for their glo-sticks, which Cutey and 
Slim and made off with and using to play swordfight across the stacks of 
records behind the DJ.   Slim got to be Darth Vader since he's taller, and 
Cutey was OB1 Kenobe.  Cutey forced Slim back until he fell into a huge cup 
of water.  He was spluttering and spitting, with the glo-stick floating on 
the surface.  Pretty funny stuff.

While SDream was hanging out with Rikki, I met Ariel.   <whistle through 
teeth> What a babe!  We've seen her at a couple of Bps, and she's such the 
PLUR kiddy!

Speaking of kitties, about that time we saw DJ Log Cat spinning!  Well of 
course all the little hamstas ran up to the speakers and started squeaking 
at the top of their lungs.  We danced and bopped our stumpy little tails 
off!  After his set, he and Moonpup were talking music, and we dragged them 
off for an adventure.  We decided to sneak off into the woods and have a 
little mini-rave among the trees.  Unfortunately one of the security guards 
saw Moonpup and made him come back.  Which was too bad cause DJ Log Cat laid 
down a set among the trees that was Da Bomb!  We were dancing among the tall 
grass and bushes...

Finally everyone was winding down, so we went back to the chill space.  
Brownie was hanging out with Leslie, giving her a scalp massage.  This means 
running through her hair and jumping up and down on her head.  If anyone saw 
Leslie's hat doing strange things, that's what that was about.

Grumpy got caught in one of those lotion-hand-orgy things where everyone is 
rubbing all their hands together.  He was greasy from one end to the other, 
but I've never seen him so happy...

We found SDream there sitting next to Amber and curled up under his shirt to 
doze for a while.  It's nice and warm in there.  Then, suddenly, SDream was 
moving.  Security was kicking us all out.  I guess none of us saw SDream 
leave his camera in the chill space.  We heard later that someone did find 
it, but in spite of security asking him to drop off the camera at lost and 
found, he kept it.  What a jerk!  The guy had purple shorts and a blue 
backpack, and his friend was wearing a Kelly green tank top.  If you know 
this guy please oh please drop Sdream a line, ok?  He's left voice messages 
for the Harmony crew but hasn't gotten a message back yet one way or the other.

Well, it was about time to bug out, but there was this huge crowd waiting 
for a bus.  At first we hung with SDream and Marty, munching on sunflower 
seeds and watching this cool whistling football fly through the air while 
listening to the drummers do their thing.  

But after a while we got  bored so we called a cab -- not easy, it took Slim 
and Cutey both to hold the receiver while Spaz jumped on the numbers to dial 
the phone.  And then of course we have to shout in the phone to be heard.  
Geez.  They've got a button on the phone for mutes, you'd think they'd have 
one on there small rodents or something...

So if you saw a cab drive up with some guys in it and then leave empty, 
well, it wasn't empty.  If you'd looked close enough, you'd have seen tiny 
little faces at the window and little paws waving goodbye...

Slim stuck around and helped clean up, but all he could pick up were the 
cigarette butts, and there were a BUNCH!

Thanks go out to the Harmony crew for creating such an incredible event!

Thomas Covenant Hamsta, esq.

...I was already gonna post this but I figured now would even be a more 
appropriate time with all this rave shutting down...

		...we should have the right to rave
		...we only want to spread SM:)ES and happiness, and dance

(off of flyer I was handed @ HUNNY)

	Why are you at this event? The rave scene is not just about techno.  
	This scene is not just about drugs this scene is no just about fashion.
	It is something special about unity and happiness.

	It is about being yourself and being loved for it.  
	It should be a harbor from our society.

	BUT our scene right now is disintegrating!!!!!!!
	Old style ravers -- remeber when everybody HUGGED all the time 
	-- not just to say hello and goodbyes?
	Remember when people just said hi to be your FRIEND?
	Remembver how good that felt?
	Why don't we do it anymore?
	New comers -- you are wanted and you should know that this scene 
	is about openess.
	
	We all share a bond -- the desire to groove to a good beat ALL 
	night long -- and no one is an island.
	Everyone needs friends and the OUTSIDE WORLD is tough enough.
	We don't need fronts and attitudes in our scene.
	Open your hearts and let the good feelings flow =)
	Look around you, pick a person, ask them their name, and make a FRIEND,
	eliminate boundaries.
	
	OPEN your hearts and minds, RAVERS UNITE and keep our scene alive!!!

The way I see it- This list is a way of communication for people who have one
thing in common-their love of music (rave).  talking about raves only gets a
little stale, especially for someone whose been in the scene almost 7 years.
 But it does give me a chance to talk to people with the same interests as me
and maybe discuss other things.  Thats the way I feel about it.

	Ok, so what type of love are we talking about here. It is very 
hard for me to love someone who has totally different ideals which are in 
conflict with my own like I the person who I call a lover. So what is it 
that we mean by love in the state Love thy enemy? Should I go around 
hugging them all and sprinkling glitter on my enemy like people do in the 
"lovey" chillrooms? Do I taunt them by purposefully taking a different 
meaning than the one implied from a sentence like I do with my lover? If 
I do that, how do I keep from getting my brains splattered all over the 
pavement?
	What I am trying to get at here is Jesus had a neat message, but I
am not sure how many people understand it because I am not sure if anybody
has any idea what love is... Its one of those emotions that there is no
rules which are mirrored in behavior and it becomes very difficult to talk
about first person impressions in the third person (wait did I say that
right, hopefully this will explain what I mean, it is difficult to explain
what pain is like without refering to something happening like it feelings
like a knife was thrust into my side or the wound is buring - what does
burning feel like? Basicly, it would be silly for me to go look in a
mirror to see if I was exhibiting the symptons of pain to see if I was in
pain or in other words to go about determining if I am in pain by the way
other people determine if I am in pain because I have the first person
knowledge of the pain. But to learn the word pain, I have seen how people 
react when they touch a hot burner and than I touch it and I make a 
connection - this is how people act when they feel a pain. But then, what 
is love, how to we know where in "love" as those people are, so we know 
we are using the word to convey the correct meaning as per the rules of 
the word love. Ok, this is something like what people were talking about 
a little while ago with concepts and language which I stayed out of 
because I disagreed with the basis of the arguement on a different point 
than was being discussed, but that is in my system of beliefs and may not 
apply to yours).  

> 	Whether you believe in the divinity of Jesus or not, the concept
> 	of Love without reservation is one that Humans STILL have to
> 	learn.....

	Again, what type of love are we talking about here. It's a grand 
message as I see it but grabled as fuck. Grabled enough that most everyone 
writes it off as fucking silly. I have no idea how to love my enemies 
in any other way but letting them run their course and do my best to not 
play the little power games and just go about my business even if my 
business puts me in direct breach of their "laws". Hmmm, anyone up for 
enlightment, just sit down and figure it out.

Hello friends, Romans and countrymen,

I'd like you to konw that my recent negativity has been nothing more than a
mirrorlike reflection of what I have been getting from this list of late.

I subscribed on June 12, 1995, I found the it to be a really beautiful
world full of intelligent conversation about music, parties, and other
related information. It was like an extended collection of the very people
I found at beautiful undergrounds like "Harmony" and "Friends and Family".
Those parties and this list were a direct catalyst for my personal
transformation.

It's different now, I will not bore you all withy what I think happened
that turned this list into a "Cool World" -- it's fairly obvious.

What's here now is no longer an online community to complement those
beautiful parties. It's no longer the SFRAVES I knew and loved. It's more
like ALT.RAVE now. No community, just spew.

So I am leaving.

I offer my condolences for my now-dwindling-in-numbers friends that
continue to impale themselves with the net.wasting crap that seems to have
fully overtaken the beautiful online community of yore that many of us used
to know.

I have heard rumors about a new 'sfraves' type list for non-boneheads will
be forming on the horizon. Non-boneheads: keep your ears open. Boneheads:
please stay here and continue as you will.

Thank you, and goodbye.

In response to jonas:  My comment was this:

        "The word alien is almost another discriminating word that we
humans have created to seperate us from everything else.  If the goal is to
come together back into some sense of unity and oneness with everthing than
we have to include the cosmos and everything in it or else we will always
be seperate from something."

And if we are coming together at parties or raves to celebrate unity and
love for life and one another then shouldn't we be aware of all that we are
drawing towards us in our invitational thoughts of moving towards a sense
of oneness in relationship to all that is.

>How about bringin two water bottles...one to share and one for yourself?

I think its cool that you want to share what you have with other people.  I
wouldn't want to have other people share their colds by touching the bottle
with their lips.  I usually tell people not to touch the bottle when they
drink.  I usually don't touch my own bottle.  That way no body fluids, just
love.. :)
I think the squirt bottle is the best idea I've seen.

Anyone see those glowsticks in the water bottles?

Nope, I don't agree.  Been to too many raves, been to too many massives.
All that are left are massives.  It requires no work, no effort, no danger,
no diversity, and often for some no fun.

I am glad that there are circle dancers, since they, single hadedly, have
kept this thing going, even when it seemd like it was running out of juice.

But, like everything else, my view is from my singular perspective.  Your
mileage may vary depending upon the amount of time you've spent in the
"scene", and of course what YOU consider important.  Hell, if you can catch
a groove, it's all good.

I just haven't seen a rave since, oh about '92-'93, when THE last great
massive was held by Toon Town at the fashion center.  Of course there was
the Toon town and 5ft tounges before then but...there I go again showing my
, for lack of a better term, rave age.  MArtin then picked up the ball and
did the Gatherings, Basics, etc.  Definitely one of the good , and last
standing raves..I think. Of course there were the FMM (Full Moon Massives
or Full Moon Raves by the one & only & definitive) Wicked crew...left all
others to be second best...sorry.

I haven;t seen or been to one since Martin's a while back.  Toon Town and
MArtin's gigs....always the bomb!

Oh, only if you coulda seen it...if you coulda seen it!

Out,
John

I thought Neils was, as usual, right on.  People need to look before they
leap.  I know my brotha can get a bit vitriolic, but he usually is very
adept at targeting his message to ideas, not people.

I shopuld know.  I've known the hucklebuck for years now, and when I first
got on the list we , and others, mixed it up.  I am happy to say that
myslef and many others are now friends.  There IS a such thing as history,
and people, especially we stoopid Americans, should be well versed in ours.
Especially before we speak.  Ignorance, in this age of information, is no
longer an excuse for stumbling.  Too many tools.  Maybe not enough time,
but certainly too many tools.  ABout Disney and other tidbits, did you know:
-When Disney created that, thing called Disneyland, it was located in
Anaheim?  Yeah, yeah, BUT did you ALSO know that that city had THE LARGEST
POPULATION of KLANSMEN IN THE COUNTRY.  Klansmen sat on the city council of
Anaheim, the same council the approved his megaflopolis ideas.  And he was
VERY WELL AWARE OD THIS FACT.  It is NO suprise Anaheim was where it was to
be.  FYI.
-Where in the hell were negroes in the tomorrow land exhibit?  Much like
the Jetsons someone really didn't plan on US being here for that long. ;)
-Who was the first black mousketeer?  I dunno was there one? ;)

I'm out, this shit is funny.  Neils was right on IMO.

He owes nobody nothing.  He did his job by informing the public of what a
racist Disney was.  I do not think Neils meant to harm Tim, but I DARE NOT
speak for homes, he can do that very well himself.  The words weere harsh,
but the truth was clear.  People really should think about what they say,
before they say it.  Sorry Tim may have gotten hurt in the process.  Much
like I have been hurt by gangstah this, homies, and other stuff.  But, I'm
gonna last.  Tim MAY be back, after things cool down.

I have been reading a lot of the stuff lately and have decided just as well
to stay out of most of it...

Something that I've come to realize and I think a lot of people are losing
touch with is that we're all here for the same reason - WE ALL LOVE TO
RAVE.  Music, dancing, and having a good time is something that brings us
all together.  Albeit that we all come from different backrounds and have
different morals, we need to respect each other and their right to his or
her own opinion.

When I went to my first rave, I was so amazed that people accepted me for
who I was, I didn't have to put up a front.  The thing that I have observed
lately is that people on this list keep on knocking each other and ranting
about who does and doesn't belong at raves.  Each and every person has just
as much right to be at a rave as the other person.  I have gone to many
raves where there are "gangstas" or "hoochies" or whatever the hell you
want to call somebody, they have just as much right to have fun as I do.
They get to be exposed to house music and dancing instead of gangbanging
and killing, that's a great compromise if you ask me! 

Back to my point.  I have learned to just have fun with this list.  Getting
to hear different opinions and viewpoints is great!  We shouldn't be
fighting here, since we're all here to have fun, right?

Anyways, my brain is tapped out and I have some partying to do right now!
I hope that this doesn't sound like I'm preaching.  This is just something
that I've been thinking about.  We seem to all take it for granted that we
have this great opportunity to discuss raving with hundreds of other great
people who are in it for the love.  I would just wish that this forum was
used for that, not as a medium for attacking other people.

Thank you for all of your time,

Warning:  This is where Leslie loses it, and if you don't want to watch,
you'd better avert your eyes now, because I'm more pissed than I've ever
been on here...

What the hell is going on on this list????  Those of you who have been
using this forum for your neurotic argumentative pleasures -- and you know
exactly who you are, each and every one -- are bulldozing your ridiculous
shit over people who HATE IT!!!

I have had three phone calls and several private emails today from people
who have asked for ideas of how to stop this shit!  As if I have some
solution?!? For those of you who are participating it...  Guess what?  Most
of people on this list think you are all being fully unpleasant,
inconsiderate and obnoxious!  We think you're acting like jerks, and you're
forcing it on us in the rudest of ways.

(And if you don't think I have the 'right' to make that generalization
about others on this list, too goddamn bad, because I claim that right, and
I am speaking the truth.)

Is driving people away your goal??? Do you really want to drive away all
the positive people so you can have the list all to yourself for your nasty
games?  Fine, drive everyone away -- except of course for the lurking drama
voyeurs who tell me they love watching this kind of soap opera, which
boggles my mind.

Soon you can just change the list to SFIDIOTS or SFIGNORANTGOATS or
something that'll give you that emotional charge you all seem to like so
much.

Many of the people who have have quit the list, or are now planning to, are
the VERY people who put consistent time and energy into the positive side
of this group.  For chrissake, Knucklehad quit??   Shame on you and your
immature behavior.

These are the times I'm glad I'm NOT really the fucking "rave mother"
because I'd be so ashamed to see my own "kids" behave this way.  Rude,
crude, disrespectful, closeminded and meanspirited. Intellectual abilities
gone awry.

I'm giving it 24 hours, and then I, too, am gone.

Leslie

Oh, and by the way, please take ALL RESPONSES PRIVATE to me.... don't copy
the list by "mistake" (yeah right, it's always a mistake when a private
discussion suddenly gets taken public ... not, and isn't it interesting how
really really nasty those posts have usually become by the time one of the
particpants decides to "share" it with us).

I have no intention of joining any arguments, enough time wasted with this.

Death:          You're speaking of a true or actual world.
                Imagine, if you can, a world so blurred
                that its inhabitants are one another
                --an idiotic monster of negation:
                so timid, it would rather starve itself
                eternally than run the risk of choking;
                so greedy, nothing satisfies its hunger
                but always huger quantities of nothing--
                a world so lazy that it cannot dream;
                so blind, it worships its own ugliness:
                a world so false, so trivial, so unso,
                phantoms are solid by comparison.
                But no--you can't imagine such a world.

Santa Claus:    Any more than such a world could imagine me.

Death:          Very good. Now as to this ungivable something
                you're trying to give, this gift which nobody can take
                --what, just exactly, is it?

Santa Claus:    I don't know.

Death:          I do.

Santa Claus:    Do you?

Death:          Yes. It is understanding.

Santa Claus:    Understanding?

Death:          Yes.

Santa Claus:    Tell me, how do you know?

Death:          You told me, when you answered "I don't know."
                And when you said you had something to give, you told me;
                for isn't understanding the only gift?
                Well there's precisely your predicament.
                We are not living in an age of gifts:
                this is an age of salesmanship, my friends;
                and you are heavy with the only thing
                which simply can't be sold.

I joined this list three days ago and I'm disgusted.  I joined because I will
be in the area next month and wanted to find out what is going on.  I was
looking to hook up with people that could show me around.  This is not what I
expected of San fran.  I live in Houston and have always looked up to san
fran as inspiration.  I don't know what to think anymore.  I always hear how
great the scene is, but think i was misfed info.  If I wanted this much
drama-I'd watch soap operas.  Now maybe I'm wrong.  Please prove me wrong.  I
don't want my visit to be disappointing.  I have a feeling it won't.

positive things to say are leaving to and I really don't want Sfraves to die!

"
We were talking -- about the space between us all
And the people -- who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth -- then it's far too late --
when they pass away.

We were talking -- about the love we all could
share -- when we find it
To try our best to hold it there -- with our love
With our love -- we could save the world -- if they only knew.

Try to realise it's all within yourself no-one else
can make you change
And to see you're really only very small,
and life flows on within you and without you.

We were talking -- about the love that's gone so cold
and the people,
Who gain the world and lose their soul --
they don't know -- they can't see -- are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself -- then you
may find, peace of mind, is waiting there--
And the time will come when you see
we're all one, and life flows on within you and
without you.
"

hey peeple-de peeps,

	i'm the little raver girl, JULIAN M.O.D.,

		 taking care of CT while he's

		venturing down here in SD,

	and all i can say is, he is in good hands.


		in fact, he's quite occupied in fending

			off all the little girlie whirlies
	
	who are attracted to the "dust"---


			see, everytime CT comes back into town,

	he's covered with a light coating of "dust"

		from SF-----------he  calls it  his "love dust"

		but truely, it's the vibe that he brings down from the great SF.


				personally, i think it's something related to.....


						angel dust ......hmmmmmmm 


		 i recently saw a video from the HARMONY party

				where Caryn was selling H2O,


		and let me just say...Absolutely RAD....Phatty phat phat.


			Caryn was buying H2O for peeple!!

		You GUYS!!!! She was S'posed to be sellin' DAT watah!!

				KNOT buyin' it for da other ravers!

		i sed' VWAT!!!!?????

				that's comepletely INSANE!!?

			"i like that girl !!  i gotta meet her!!  gotta !!

		who is SHE?!?!"	and CT, wiped his love dust from

				his brow, and revealed her name.....

			she's one of the RAD SF RAVERS that i have YET to meet.


			( i say YET, because i'll GET ther soon enuf,

					and once you meet me, there's no turning back!)

		****just a warning*** hahahaha!

			ok, so seriously, this is impt., so keep reading.

		when i saw Caryn givin', buyin', whatever it was

					----pure giving.

				it really inspired me, 

		gave me back a little bit of that lost hope

 	that sometimes overwhelms us all when we


	look at society and all the horrible cruel things going

					on in the world.....

		so, anyWHO, my point is, that it's peeple like CT (love dust )

		and Caryn and Wayne (you crazy NUT!---i LOVE YOU!!) who

			remind us that there really is a reason

					that 

							our

									souls
		
			
											are

					brought together.......


		i believe that we're all here--living in these turbulent times 

			to attempt to bring some kind of peace to humanity,


					and teach people what love and the powers

					of the universe are all about......


			SO, keep the spirit, keep the vibe.....


		(Caryn, thanks for your spirit-----it's beautiful)

			
			
			xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

			love and groovelicious hugz,

				Julian M.O.D.

		ps:  socal-raves groodies are rootin' for you guys in your
			rough waves......sendin' good energy and love to the
			sf ravers---   =)

well, i've been toying with the notion of unsubbing now for a week since
all this nonsense started. sitting next to wayne while he unsubbed seems to
have kicked me in the ass.

it's been fun, kiddies. i'm sure it will be a lot more fun without me. 

and remember: doing lots of e makes sfraves a tolerable read.

So where are you guy's going to go on Dec 6, I was thinking about going 
to Lepidoptera. It sound like it will be pretty cool. It's also pretty 
good price, don't you think. I am personally tired of paying $15 - $20 
for a party, but if it's a good party then I guess you can find the money 
somewhere. 

 About cool world, I think it's good that people are say that they don't 
like it or what they think and have experienced because as a new person 
into the scene ( about a year ) it gives me some input. But I know that I 
am not going, but my friends are totally into going and I am just not. So 
I guess they will have to go without me.

Peace and love

I find it fasinating that there seems to be more of a sense of kaos on 
this list lately. 
I haven't been reading all the posts as I've found many to be 
redundant, but there is something appealing to this sense of kaos.  
There have been some very REAL feelings bubbling on the list lately. 

I wonder if many of us have been dancing enough?
Parties have been getting busted a little more lately.  Its seems that 
there has been more verbal dancing lately here, though it seems like it 
has been more of the slam dancing as of late.

The thing that keeps me going to these parties is the love of the music 
and the love of dancing.
One of the reasons I read this list is to feel connected with others 
who love techno and dance.
Seeing whats been going on here lately, makes me think even more so how 
wonderful this scene can be.  Here we have people arguing, insulting, 
misinterpreting....but we all, (I'd like to think) or most of us share 
that bond that can come from some music playing through the speakers.  
When that happens, its so cool how all these people with their 
differences can come so much closer to one another on the dance floor.

Even as we have our differences here which is definitely cool, the beat 
of the music is alive in us all.  It is so wonderful that we share, and 
it is ours to enjoy.

peace and whatever else you may be feeling,
:)

Me and my friend Victoria were going to go to LA this weekend to go to a
rave called Global Gathring. It has DJs Trance, Thomas Micheal (like
Carlos), Dimitri, Mojo, Dan, & Donald Glaude. But things happened like.
Our rides to LA faking, people not having money. Stuff like that, so we
aren't going to go anywhere this weekend, i don't think.

Next week we are going to Candy Land though, and maybe even Freaky
People. We are deffnetly going to The Gathering. Who was the one offering
Free Laminates to Gathering? I'd like to take him/het up on that offer.
Sounds like a really cool person.

My friend Victoria is going to bring someone knew into the scene for
Gathering, we hope she has fun. Hope she likes it as much as me and all
of you guys do too.

We are going to this rave in LA called Care.a.Lot. The flyer isn't too
attractive and there are too many rainbows on the flyer for any mean
people to attend. I think it really will be good. Hope we go. If anybody
wants info on it, ask me. Let me tell you guys LA raves are really cool.
They are so nice down there, we could learn alot from them, ya know.
They give tons of candy, they are really colorfull, they go all out too.
Really nice people down there. If you never have been to an LA rave you
should go. We went to OZ and it was really good. I had so much fun, made
my change my view about raving. 

I hope that our scene tones down a bit and quites down for a while and
gets more into the love and stuff like theirs does. Raves down there are
only $20. Thants five buck you can save.  That would be terrific if stuff
like that went on here, but raving is starting to become a bit too
commercial here, its real sad. Keep It underground.

Peace, Love, Unity, Respect,
-Paul

Still reading? Did I make it past the kill-filter? Wow.

An observation:

Many of you seem rather upset about all the negativity you perceive on
this list, and are making a big show of leaving or threatening to leave.
To those people I would ask this: What positive contributions to the list
have *you* made recently?(I am not bitching, so don't try to throw this
back in my face.) 

You don't like the discussions going on; they are bitchy, crappy,
disrespectful, or whatever, fine, by all means *START YOUR OWN* Inject
something positive into the list if that is what you are looking for, if
that is what you need to see. Put a little effort into putting forth the
kinds of posts that you want to see on this list, without expecting
everyone else to do so, and then being pissed off and upset when you do
not see those types of posts you want to see here. 

Myself, I am a pretty serious, and vocal person most of the time, and most
of my posts are not shiny and happy. I do not apologize for this, that is
my nature. 

But dammit, you all have the power to post whatever you want. CT has taken
to re-posting old "positve" posts from the archives. Is that what we are
left with? Does no one have anything original to say? 

The next time you start to complain about the negativity on the list ask
yourself what you have done to change the tone of the list recently, what
you have contributed. It's not a spectator sport folks.

ok, some people are participating positively... but not enough. and it's
also important not to contribute to the negativity. (which you, jonathan,
haven't particularly, i'm not directing this at you...) as i said before,
when you see a post you don't like, responding critically only fans the
flames. best just to ignore it and start a discussion about something you
want to discuss.

love,

brian

Dear SFRavefriends,

	Wile E. Coyote comes to mind... (hee hee)

	But seriously, folks, I think most people concerned about the
environment are not so much worried about their own actions as those of
the human species en masse.  In having this capacity (to worry about
creatures we may have never even seen) I think we are unique, setting
aside for the moment Amy's comment about the aliens.  8)  
	And certainly many past extinctions have resulted from the 
actions of members of nonhuman species, this is part of evolution.

Waiting for the aliens,

Subject: A Modest Proposal
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

sfraves has gone through shitstorms before, and will survive this
too, but the volume and extent of the last week convinces me that
all this has escalated to a new and dangerous level.  

A modest proposal: we are as a group being very hard on ourselves here.
Everyone here has a valid point of view, but that is starting to be
lost in the effort to "win" on every nuance. 

Facts are facts.  Observations and opinions are important, but are
no more than what they are.  Respect only survives when it goes both
ways.  

I'm not going to preach and lay down "rules of good online behavior."
Y'all already know 'em anyway.  

A lot of us rely on this list to keep up on the electronic dance music
scene, to stay in touch with our friends, to laugh a bit and learn
something.  I don't mind disorder and disagreement.  I don't mind
people testing the envelope of what is 'appropriate' for the list.
I do mind it a lot when this important resource in my life starts
taking on the flamewar symptoms that burden many other online areas.

Whether you've been on this list five days or five years, it is
your responsibility, it is all of our responsibility, to circulate
facts, opinions and respect for positive purposes.

peace out
phred

 Of course John. As one of our prime examples of the succes and

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

In response to what has been written about Cool World and PLUR:  Which can
also be applied to the gangster issue as well.

(by the way Paul, I think I am qualified to respond, although I can't check
my tag because I really dislike underwear...its too restricting!)

PAUL WHOA!  Slow down and think about how you are responding here.  I agree
with you I believe that we come together at raves to experience and
celebrate peace, love, unity, and respect for all.  But in living and
holding this light you must view the world compassionately instead of
agressively or negatively.  To love means to love all and to love all you
must understand another persons logic.  Although you don't have to imbibe
their logic into your reality.  If change in others is what you seek then
you must project love to them and understand the motive that drives the
others logic and visualize and manifest the change through your thoughts
and love.

Through thoughts and fears the hegemonous race ties us to this action of
continually attacking back.

But with our beliefs it is waste of time and energy to be angry about
another persons actions.  If they affect your life as in a stolen article
you have to look at it as being only their response and their response does
not have to trigger a release of emotions of hatred or anger on your part.
It is uncomfortable to have a pocession or loved one removed from your life
or to experience pain but if your happiness lies in what you own or having
your loved ones near or alive or in having all your limbs then what happens
if you lose these things.  Will you no longer generate happiness and love?
Will you carry a grudge of hate with you for whomever brought upon this
horrible experience?  How will that assist in healing the planet or
mankind?

Focus your thoughts to visualize powerful change instead of wasting them on
attacking or complaining about another.  When you attack or complain, by
actions or thoughts, you only feed into this continous struggle that
charecterizes our human existence.  A person will be as you see him as.
The student whose teacher believed in him succeeds while the students who
were put in lower level classes with teachers that saw them as slower than
others continued to fail in life.  The world is a mirror of your beliefs.
You draw into your life exactly what you fear and believe.

If you truly wish to integrate Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect into the
world than consider the idea of unconditional love.  Where love is not an
emotion it is a state of being.  Love has no object.  Unconditional love is
the experience of BEING; there is no I or no "other" and anyone or anything
it touches is experienced in love.  You can only BE unconditional love.  It
is a sense of oneness with all that is.  This experience arises when we
surrender our seperateness into the UNIVERSAL.  It is a feeling of unity.
You don't love another, you are another.  There is no fear because there is
no separation.

As humans we learn by right association.  What works for another is
observed and integrated into our own lives.  Concentrate on the holding the
light of the ideas of PLUR.  The hegemonous culture will self destruct.  We
are destined for so much more.

This is indeed a fact...there are several books about it and even movies of
the CIA or military experiments.  Sorry I don't have any titles off hand
but this did happen.

Ahhh, you are taking this way too personally, he was spewing his same old
shit.  He doesn't stand for ignorance and somewhere in there he does make a
valid point.  If you didn't know about Walt Disney then hey not your fault.
But its pretty well known that Walt worked for the CIA and government in
some way to help black list minorities.

I love Disneyland though and I love their movies so I know you were just
trying to pass along a little tidbit of info in a good way, but Neils took
it the wrong way, thats not the first time for him.

And people on the list are being more and more stereotypical and somewhat
racist by talking about gangstas and stuff all the time in a negative way.
This is steretypical and prejudice.  Niels takes as being racist because
most people associate gangstas with blacks or latinos.

Hope you a stay strong and don't give up on us on the list, and don't take
it personally, you just didn't know.

I think this is such a good idea.

obmusic:

Eric and I ran through our first recording a new RE: tape last night.  It's
all original music.  The mixes need a little work, but I'm sure we'll get it
in the next couple of trys.  Then it will be availble for all to enjoy.
It's pretty chill on one side and more upbeat amb/idm/intellijungle on the
other.  Have a good weekend everyone, and lets hope some of those wonderful
people who left us recently check back in after all this blows over.

I'd just like to take the time to send a group fare-thee-well to
everyone else who's leaving on this list.  Me, I'm stayin' ... There
will always be newbe's arriving, and there will always be olde-timers
leaving...  It has happened and never ends.  It's the cycle. And it's a
good one. 
I view SFRaves as a marriage of sorts, there are High times (E-times)and
Low times(Spun-times).  The communities mentality in general is
reflective to society in the fact that, "if I don't like it, then I'll
leave."
That's why divorce is so popular nowadays, & , it seems a lot of
sfravers want a divorce from sfraves.
But it's all good, I've gone thru this stage two years ago (willfully)
and last year as well(against my own will)...  Unlike a divorce SFRaves
will take you back...

Even if your on or off the list you are my dear friends (and you know
who you are...)  I tend to keep friends close to me unless you royally
screw me (and I haven't been screwed for quite some time... =])...

Take care friends and lovers,

---Adam

Short ASCEDENCE Report
1. Nice venue! Wood floors!
2. Good and loud sound system.
3. Should have put the drummers across the room away from the 
   DJ and Astral Matrix.
4. Nice crowd.

 I'd go again sometime - maybe to DEEP at the same place on Tuesdays. I 
hear there's a jungle night too ??

Good morning!

The list isn't really that bad all the time.  I've been on this list for
over 4 years, and I have seen so much drama tear thru the list it has made
me sick.  But it's all done at certain times of the year.  We get this huge
flux of crap about two to three times a year.  It's like the list gets
constipated and then everyone starts spewing out there opinions like a
heavy dose of laxatives!

I personally just leave it all alone and sit back and watch as people come
and go.  I've learned that the list isn't going to change and that leaving
the list isn't the right answer let alone fueling the fire.

So everyone relax cause this will all be better soon enough and we'll all
be back to our normal selves soon.  I'll give everyone the benefit of the
doubt and blame it on the holidays and finals!

I hope everyone is having a wonderful Friday.  What is everyone doing this
weekend.  Maybe a few of us can get together and do something!

Take care,

Noah Ruiz =)

SFRaves will be here, as it always has.  Sorry you're leaving, and will
leave the fight of positivity to others.  The list is not over, it is just
burping (and I've been a part of that gas).

It will all end as soon as we all take a deep breath.

And of course a high colonic.  I had mine, and feel ohhh so refeshed.

Scatalogically yours,
John

Hey All,
I wanted to take a second to thank everyone who went out of their way to
send me a quote on why they rave for my paper on Ecstasy and the Rave
culture. It is by no means a "difinitive" work, but simply a few pages
of my take of Raving and E.  Its done! I think it came out really well,
I only wish I wasn't being held to 10 pages. (Its 15 anyway!) I will
gladly forward it to anyone who would like to read it. If you sent me a
quote and asked for a copy, I'll do my best to get those out asap. Could
take a while. I'm out in Boulder, CO and Lust 5 is going off in Denver
on Sat. nite....should be fantastic! I'm so psyched! Any of you MTN
people going?? Have a groovy weekend....lots of love....
Ari

Sometimes some of us want to discuss these issues that are hot topics and 
may seem negative to some.  What everyone here I think needs to realize n 
some sense is that just because this is a rave related list doesn't mean 
the content is going to be all pretty/happy/candy/lovey and such.  There 
are negative threads on this list yeah.  There are happy threads yeah.  
There's lot's of complaining lately.  I've been on the list for over two 
years now, folks sometimes life's hard, but you still make it through the 
tough parts.  When my life is difficult I don't just say, I'm 
unsubscribing from my life to get away from it all!  I think everyone 
should just calm down and relax. 

love drenalin

I'm sorry, but I cannot take the insensitivity that abounds on this list.  
Thank you, those of you who took even a moment to make me feel welcome.  I am 
deeply indebted to you.  My address is lritting@us.oracle.com for those who 
would care to keep in touch with me. 
To thine own self be true.

Due to conflicts and confusions NUB Circus will not be able to bring 
Chai to Mantra tonight (12/6).  However, all is not lost because if 
anyone is going to Mantra from Santa Cruz or San Jose we would be happy 
to send them with the fully brewed and sweetened goodness.  Call us at 
408-458-2071 or send e-mail so we may arrange bringing Chai to this 
gathering!

Someone will be the bearer of Chai!

I joined SFRaves in June of this year and it is thanks to it that I met many
of the people I now consider my friends.  I think one of the most important
functions of this list is to help those new to the SF area or to the rave 
scene to find people they have things in common with and to find parties
where they can meet these people.  I no longer need the list to know what 
parties are happening.  I know enough people to find that out myself.  My main
reason now for being on the list is to help out those that have come after
me.  

I think a lot of the recent posts have not only caused a lot of longtime
SFRavers to unsubscribe but scared away pontential new ones as well.  We are
not only hurting ourselves but also the scene.  

I will be go back to school on the east coast in January and will be unsubbing
from the list on my last day of work December 20th.  Until then I encourage any
of you new people out there that may be looking for a ride to a party or just
someone to go with or meet up with to contact me.  I'll be going to Freaky
People on the 13th, The Gathering on the 21st, and some New Year's party.

I really hope this list can continue to be a gateway to the rave scene for many
people and that when I come back in the summer I find it prospering.

love to all,
j

P.S.  For those wishing to stay in contact with me when I go back to school
email me.

Thank you SO MUCH, Terry, for posting this!!

I wrote this post in the first blush of love last spring... and promptly 
lost it.  After eight months, me and the "boy" in question have scaled the 
heights of happiness, experienced the lows of a romance gone sour, and 
finally settled on a good friendship.  But in all that time, I never got to share this first post I 
wrote of us when I very first fell for him... and now, thanks to you, 
I belatedly get to share it with him.

:)
Thank you!

love,
N

Here is a tale of ravers in love...of a boy and girl going to a rave
together with a mutual friend...and the boy warming the girl's heart with
his floppy hat and big happy smile, and how he ran all around the party in
glee and bounced up and down on the dance floor...and the two then going to
Sunset, and Mad, and Chrysalis...of sitting in a car the morning after for
four hours, still soaked in sweat and covered in sparkles, discovering that
the love they shared for raving was based on their deepest personal beliefs
and experiences, and the bond that created between them...of touching each
other for the first time with Orbital playing softly in the background...of
knowing that they found each other because of the openness of their hearts
and the willingness to give love a chance...

DaveQ on this list, I believe, will be throwing his 1st (?) party tonight,
Lepidoptera,  with  Greg Sandler (Harmony), Shilo Maggi (Journees), Tom,
Zach.
   $10 before midnite, $8 presale.
   $12. 408.535.0432

I'm pretty sure it will be in SF.  I don't know what's up with the 3 prices
listed, I just copied this out of Derek Chung's post.    Oh yeah, $12  for
ugly people.  JK. We're all beautiful and you know it. :o)

Actually, I don't want to give ALL the credit to Q, I believe he's working
with some other folks on this.

I'll be the guy dancing on the speakers and macking on everyone's
girlfriends. :0 !  This is a joke which I have made.

Seeing wayne, brendan, leslie, sherry, jonathan and tim tell us they're
unsubbing in the course of a day is the saddest thing I've ever seen on
this list, and I'm  wondering why???

People, please, stop JUMPING on each other!

I'm serious. Every one of you is thinking "damn, I wish all these SFR
assholes would stop arguing" but many of you still do it! every little
negative post contributes toward a bigger group of negative posts that just
snowballs into the kind of shitfest we're seeing here right now. with that
in mind I have two things to say:

1) before you post, THINK. think about who will gain from it, who will be
interested, and what your motives are for sending an e-mail to 400 people.
if it's for selfish reasons or you think people might not be interested or
you just feel like being a jerk, DON'T POST IT PLEASE. I get enough e-mail
as is without a bazillion "you're a jerk and I'm right" posts every day.

2) there are certain people on this list (I'm so CLOSE to naming names it's
not even funny) who I have NEVER, in my year and some-odd months on SFR,
seen a positive post from. These people (i think you know who you are;
you've all been posting alot lately) seem to think that their vitriolic
commentary, "back in the day" bitching (it's not back in the day... it's
TODAY so make it a good one!) and endless "FUCK YOU's" somehow benefit the
community. Well, they don't. I'm not being a PLUR cop, but I do think this
list could stand to live without alot of assholes who seem to think they've
subscribed to SFSoapBox. This list is a local mailing list, and when you
get 400 people together, most of whom hang out together on weekends, you're
going to get a lot of NRR fluff, which is just something you'd have to deal
with. think of it as a virtual rave... when I go to a party, I LIKE making
NRR conversation. Same goes for SFR: I see it as a way to bring parties
into our everyday lives, rather than keeping them restricted to weekends.

        And who the hell wants to go to a rave to hang out with some
asshole who
        probably had a "fuck you" key installed in his keyboard to cut his
        typing speed in half???

I'm unsubbing in a few weeks too, because I'm spending my xmas break in
Poland. I'll see my mom and my little bro for the first time in many moons,
and I'll be over there hanging out with the fam and thinking of the
gathering and fnf and harmony and all the beautiful people and beautiful
parties I'm missing, and although seeing my family i something I've been
looking forward to for awhile,  ---->I'll be glad to come home.<-----

I just hope SFR is still around when I get back.

I feel like I had some way of starting all this blasting on the list. I
made the comment about the Phish concert, and if anyone had seen them.
Suddenly, everyone starting coming out and arguing over something that
is so meaningless in the whole spectrum of what is really important;
which is: we are all different, we all have different tastes, yet we can
come together and bounce ideas off eachother.
I'm very new to town, three months actually. I joined the list a month
ago, and the Phish comment was the first thing I posted. Now I'm not too
sure I want to post anything else. Call me ignorant, but I had no idea I
was supposed to put "NRR" in front of things that weren't rave related.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause a stir. I personally think Phish is a
rave within itself. Just my opinion. Please don't blast me for that. I
hope this note doesn't sound negative, that wasn't my intention. 
I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend, full of fun and energy.
Thanks for spending a few of your minutes reading this.

just kidding :)
There is no way that any one person is responsible for all that goes on 
on this list.
I think most people know its time to lighten up now.

Don't feel too bad!  I'm sure I've done my bit to ramp things up a bit!
I've been trying to inject some (what I thought was) intellectually
stimulating discourse onto the list but I find that there are too many
people (who consider THEMSELVES to be open-minded!)  who are
too intolerant of differing views or take their own opinions so
seriously that when you present evidence that conflicts with
their views they get mad at YOU.....

No, no, no, Tim don't  go! I know some of  these threads has caused some
very nauseating vibes lately. 

This should be a lesson to the people out there duelling away on their
keyboards.

I agree, but otherwise I thought the drumming was pretty good...you hear a
lot of drummers who don't really...ah, mesh, for whatever reason, but those
folks sounded all right.

Not that I know of.  There's funk, soul, disco some Fridays, but other than
that it's just Ascendance and the Deep.  But neither one is focused on a
particular style, I think...I'm sure one or the other could put together
some jungle.

BTW, who's Kamia?  I liked his stuff a lot.  I'll look for him in the future.

MY new response:

I am very familiar with the dmt experience and actually don't even need to
partake anymore to experience an encounter with entitys living in other
dimensions. Alien means not of this world and extra-terrestrial means not
of this planet earth, So I guess if you consider anything that does not
exist in our 3-dimensional space of which all humans can view by
3-dimensional perception it does not exist in this world or on earth.  But
if you consider the other dimensions to be existing on this earth and if
other entitys are viewable to those who selective people who use dmt or
those who have their third eye open then they must exist here.  I am under
the understanding that they affect our lives on earth as a whole through
the collective consiousness and our individual unconcious reality.  So in
my mind they are a part of this world and really are delineated in an
unapproprate manner with names like alien as I responded earlier.

It our fears of of what we don't understand that seperates us.

MY RESPONSE NOW:
I try not to subscribe to the conspiracy theory.  Don't get me wrong I
belive all that exists, the illuminati and the regressive aliens paths to
the control the world.  But personally I believe that my reality is a
product of my thoughts, and the world is a product of the collective
thoughts of all humans.  So really I think that they can be what ever you
request them to be.  And if you find ones that seem to be on a more
regressive, dominating, or hegemenous than I think you will find that they
even know that we are more capable and powerful than them by being
spiritually aware through love.  And at this moment in time there are more
progressive positive entitys surrounding us, assisting in raising our
conciousness (hence raves).

I'm not sure who originally wrote this, but as far as I know Oxygen itself
is not flammable.  It is necessary for the combustion of other materials:
the more that is present, the faster the reaction.

I've heard of some science geeks who use liquid oxygen to prepare a
barbecue pit.  The fill it with charcoal and light it on fire.  Then they
use a LONG board with a 1 gallon bucket of oxygen on the end of it to pour
in the oxygen from a safe distance.  In 1 hot second, the charcoal is
reduced to coals, perfect for cooking. 

Just my $.02...

>Regarding mind control experiements with LSD or other psychedelic drugs:

Broadcasting has been popular theme at parties lately and if I and some of
my friends are aware of it then definitely the government has played with
it.  I believe that it is occuring and that the test of it has been with
psychedelic drugs but actually is happening to all of the world by some
sort of world management team consisting of humans and/or other entitys
through microwaves.

So there is really is not alot you can do except be aware of it and
recognize why you feel a certain way and be in control of your thoughts and
what is driving them from inside of YOU.  No one can really force you to
think anything, you accept it and it then becomes your reality.  But in the
beginning its only a thought or an illusion passing through your mind.  I
say it is an illusion because it is but that illusion can seem so real
sometimes.

I'll more than likely show up Alex!  Since its right by my house.  And for
those of you who don't know where it is its on Stevens Creek and Lawrance
expressway right across the street from Safeway and McDonalds!  City
Expresso is right by Rokin Tacos.

Take care everyone and have a wonderful weekend!  I'll be at Boreal Ski
resort on Sunday snowboarding. =)  If people want to meet up with me I'll
wait by the Ticket booth from 9:00am to 9:30am with my SFRaves laminate
visible.  I'll also be wearing my orange Burton jacket if that helps any.
Otherwise look for the laminate during the day if we miss eachother!

Don't blame yourself. I signed off over the extended thanksgiving weekend,
so I'm not to sure exactly all that happened. Most likely it was a
cumulation of several posts which set people off.

True, this is a rave list, but I enjoy some of the other periferal topics
that come up. The volume can be upsettingly high on some days, but then I
always just scan the subjects and elminate the ones I don't think I'll be
interested in.

I'm fairly new also. I've lived here for a year, and I've been on the list
for  just over a month. I haven't met any of you, though I've enjoyed the
feeling of community I've found here. I do want to go to more parties and
meet some of you, but logistics have always seemed to get in the way. I
think there is a good thing here and it would be a pity to write it off.

A young man thought the world was a pretty shitty place.  He wore a 
lot of black and generally avoided people he didn't already know.  
Then one evening he and a friend decided to go to a rave.  whoo hoo 
he
thought, a bunch of mindless happy people, targets for his caustic 
wit.  So off they went, and to their amazement, people weren't afraid 
of them, or ignoring them, them were just happy to meet them.  This 
was 
not normal.  And after a little while, he began to smile back at 
people.  And for a little while, left his self-
conciousness on the wall and danced.  
He smiled all the next week.  Said hello to people he'd never seen 
before.  And wore something that wasn't black.  The very next weekend,
 he was off to another rave.  He danced a bit more, gave and recieved 
hugs (perhaps from some of you, we don't know), and kept smiling.  
Pretty soon weeks went by and he didn't stop smiling, and he started 
to think maybe the world isn't a big 
heap of trash.  He had new friends, and old friends, and a much 
better attitude towards his life.
Someone told him one night about a mailing list, and he thought, oh 
I'm on the net, let's see who else is
out there.  He posted a few short notes, mostly read and watched, and 
said hi when he saw people he'd 
read.  
Well, now I'm here, and I'm posting something a little longer, just 
to say hello.  Thanks for being
wonderful people, and for every smile I see at every rave I go to.  
  Happies to all of you.  

               Mike.
Only 5 short months and you too can be a much more well adjusted 
person.  
See you all sooner or later!

   I have kept quiet for a few weeks now and listened to all sides of the
story (stories, arguments, whatever).  After all that listening I have come
to a conclusion and have decided to break my silence.  I am the youngest
member of SFRaves and that's a lot younger than most of you would think.
 Here's my story in an abreviated sort of way...

          I was bored over summer and looking for interesting URL sites
having to do with the love of my music life-- techno.  As luck would have
it... I came across a site called #evarneet (an internet chat for teen
ravers).  The site has since been shut down... but I followed the links to
the Hyperreal site.  Much to my surprise there was a mailing list for Bay
Area ravers to talk about their passions.  My excitement rose as I hastily
subscribed.  I didn't know what I was getting into, but the whole idea
sounded wonderful.  
           The list was great.  You could sit for days and listen to peoples
stories.  It was like a soap opera-- you can come in at any point in the
story line and easily become a part of the characters' lives.  Only on
SFRaves the people were real.  The posts were about music, raves, friendship,
politics, jokes, troubles, or whatever was on the writer's mind.  They could
write anything and get support for it, whether it was RR or not.

        ....That story wasn't too short, but it will do.  Since that day when
I signed on, members have left and new members have signed on.  The feelings
have become more hostile because people no longer want to hear anything other
than RR topics.  The point is, that I love SFRaves for it's community and
posts.  If I'm having a bad day, I want to be able to write in and get a lot
of smiley huggy PLUR messages in return.  I want to hear what people do
outside of the raves, and how it contributes to their raving life-style.
 Maybe some of you older people take it for granted.  You have jobs, and you
just want mail about the music and parties.  Raving is a privilege.  I can't
go to many raves because of my age, but I stay on this list to learn from
people.  The NRR posts are just as enjoyable as as the RR ones.  No one
should be Flamed or shunned for wanting to address an issue outside of
parties.  
            Now I've rambled so much longer than I usually do that I've lost
my point.  I'm just so sad that something that was created to bring people
together in a common interest is turning into one big argument.  If you don't
want to read NRR posts then don't.  And don't yell at a person for writing
them.  It has been pointed out numerous times that there are other mailing
lists available.  Some of them may be more rave related or friendly than
ours.  However, I wouldn't switch over.  I've grown to love the posts on this
list and the people who write them.  You're all sort of my role models.
 Someday I'll get to meet you all and talk with you in an enviroment that is
less hostile.  So no matter what anyone puts on this list, it should be
regarded with the PLUR motto.  So that's my pent-up opinion that I've been
saving forever.  WE ARE THE FUTURE OF SFRAVES.

            hugs,

tell me which list you are switching to so I don't loose contact with the

...on what I've gained from raving.  I remember times in my life where I
wished I had more friends, good friends.  I remember feeling lonely and
insecure, something we all go through from time to time.  Finding people,
thinking they were friends, then sadly realizing they were not.
Graduating from college, unsure what the hell to do with life.  Not
surrounded by people anymore.  Worried I'd never find friends.  Suffering
some difficult realizations about my life.  Going to raves.  Overcoming my
fear of dancing.  Discovering how amazing it feels.  Wow!  Having special
connections with people.  Seeing those people turn into friends.
Overcoming the fear of "not being enough".  Learning to love myself so
others would too.  Learning that to not judge others is the best way to
not be judged.  Learning that I am the sole root of my own fun.  Finally
going out by myself to create the time I wanted ALL BY MYSELF.

On May 3rd, 1996 I attended Beautiful People with a dear friend with whom
I "discovered" what raving means to me.  That night, if I had to pick, was
probably my favorite party.  I met about 6-8 sfravers, saw a ton of really
happy, sharing people, was blown away by the vibe that was so thick you 
could cut it like a knife, and danced for hours upon end. I watched the
sun come up while dancing like my life depended on it (maybe it did), and
was flabbergasted that I had the capacity to experience
such joy.  If you remember the story I wrote (Children of the Night), a
lot of the "feeling" came from that night.  I no longer try and explain to
people what that feeling is because, if they don't know, they just won't
get it.  

So, tonight I am having a party, partly in celebration of my birthday,
partly to, as my roomate put it, to get loaded with your friends.  And,
THERE is the key word, FRIENDS.  I can't believe that what I always
dreamed about came true.  I don't know how because I thought I was doomed
to a life of solitude.  Something in me changed.  I became less judgmental
of myself, and somehow I have quite a few friends.  And, I am happy to say
that some, if not most, of this came from realizations I had while raving,
simple self-discovery.  Some of these people I developed
friendships with as a direct result of the shared interest of raving and
the music.  

If you had told me three years ago that I was going to have a party
tonight, and that so many people will be there we have to worry about the
cops, I would have said "Bullshit."  Only other people had parties like
that.  Not me.  So, now I have begun to create the life I want to live
rather than let someone else do it.  And, if it weren't for raving, who
knows when, or if, this would have happened.  

In short, I grew up.

I'll be unsubbing for a week because I'll be gone, but I wanted to write
this before then.  How do I say this without being totally corny?  I guess
I don't, but believe me, it ain't all fluff.  There are aspects of raving
that are more than just a party, and raving touches people's lives.  I
just hope that that continues, and doesn't get swallowed up by the desire
to be cool and get fucked up.


Chau, nos vemos pronto...

cheers,

KaySEE

Having not danced for awhile, I am defintely feeling the anxiety of not
having done it.  I plan on going to Freaky People, and I hope to meet some
people, and re-live the little things that are important to me.

Et Tu Wayne?

Wayne you and Vince were one of the first people I met on the list when I 
subed back in the summer of 95.  I really haven't seen you since then but 
I'd always recognize ya!  Take care man. I'm getting the same feelings so 
who knows how much longer I'm staying.  I've been conversing more with 
Socal raves.. you might want to check out their list for a little more 
positivity.  

You'll be missed 

PS what's Vince up to these days?

This isn't a reply to austin's post, it's just a general reply on the topic.

        I just can't possibly have fun at a party where: 

                There's no room to dance
                It's sweaty, humid, and slick
                The people are just all f*****
                There's too many people
                You can't breathe
                You can't get away from all the commotion 
                You can't even sit down, either from the floor being all
disgusting and greasy, or there's just no damn place to sit!


        Even if the music's bad-ass, Even if there are just some PISSED OFF
visuals,
        Even if the fairy rave mother sprinkled her magic dust upon my
noggen, THE 
        PARTY WOULD STILL SUCK (to me), unless of course. . . I was all
under the         influence of some little pill or whatever.

ALSO: Cool World just pisses me off!!! (But that's somethin else)

Most of the talent lined up is really good, and despite the cost, I 
believe there will be enough to experience and enjoy to make it worth 
it.  I enjoy and sometimes dearly miss underground raves, but for New 
Year's Eve, perhaps a "party" would be good.  I (as do most of us) rave 
every weekend/(day:).  But I don't "party" very often.  I am still 
considering the Cloud Factory event, but only because my friends are 
going to it.  (I don't recognize any of the dj's; if someone does maybe 
say what you think of them?)  To hear some incredibly phat beats 
including drum and bass/jungle, I pretty much have to go to Cool World.
About people who say the party will suck, I would wonder if they would 
say that out loud in room with JasonMouse, Flux, Jeno, Tony, Graeme, 
Carlos, JonWilliams, FreakyChakra, Darkhorse, Thomas, CrystalMethod, and 
the other DJ's...  Is their music going to "suck"?  Ahem.  I wouldn't 
care if they were playing in a cave!!  (Thomas is billed to play in NYC 
the same night so unless he's going to fly in a concord someone is going 
to be dissapointed)
I understand the resentment I've been reading about.  I understand the 
*huge* difference between a beautiful rave versus a massive party.  I 
just think all things considered, CW will be a fun place to be.  After 
all, everyone seems to agree it's the people who make the party.  Well 
whereever we go, there we are - each of us will make our own good time of 
what we have around us.

Why am I posting about this thread?  Who knows.  Human nature urges us to 
speak out and contribute our views.  Perhaps my meaning is "have fun 
wherever you may go!"

love,
Max

       "Race is a part of American society, face it, or not, you're living
in it,"   written by deeje.

There is no such thing as race.  Race is a myth that we svbscribe to the
color of our skin.  But can we really define color? There are so many
shades that it all becomes a blur.  We are all one human race.  And because
we allow ourselves to channel or be a receptacle of fear we use words to
create differences where there really are none.  We attempt to dominate
what we don't understand.

I think that we can better term the differences as differences in cultures
(the imprints that we have been given and raised in since our birth) and
instead of attacking others for what they are doing wrong in our own eyes
we should try to understand why they are feeling a certain feeling and why
they need to react in the way that they are reacting.  Only by
understanding another person's logic can you really love them.  And only
through love can you visualize that person actually changing. If it is
change you really seek.

It is my understanding the reason we rave is to bring people together to
create a sense of unity and love for one another.  So if this the goal for
coming together than by being together in all of our cultural differences
we must experience unconditional love.

Unconditional love does not set one apart from anyone else it is a state of
being.  Unconditional love has no object.  You  cannot have unconditional
love for another because it is an experience of being.  There is no "I" or
no "other" and anyone or anything it touches is experienced in love.  You
can only be unconditional love.  It is a sense of oneness with all that is,
This experience arises when we surrender our separateness into the
universal.  It is a feeling of unity.  You don't love another, you are
another.  There is no fear because there is no separation.

If indeed another life force from the cosmos is about to make public
contact with earth in the near future.  How will we be receptive to it if
we are still in fear of each other?

Subject: How to handle negativity on sfraves in a positive way

Friends,

it saddens and disturbs me to see people unsvbscribing from this list due
to recent negativity.

i have two observations:

1.      when positive, loving people unsvbscribe from the list, the list
loses that person's warmth, becoming more negative.

2.      the best way to influence the direction of the list is by posting
the kind of material that you want to read. that is to say: if you don't
like NRR posts, you will be much more effective by bringing up a
rave-related discussion topic rather than criticizing the NRR material.
even more relevant right now: if you don't like
negative/critical/"unplurry" posts, the best thing to do is to ignore them
and post something positive/fun/loving.

negativity, hate, violence, etc. feed off of themselves. this can be
observed all over the real world as well as right here on this list.

the best way to stop violence is to be peaceful.
the best way to stop hate is to be loving.
the best way to stop negativity is to be positive.

plr (unity can wait),

brian

Sorry all but I got to go.  I must buckel down with my finals and throw 
my TV away so I can study.  
I too am dissapointed about all the good people leaving.  I've learned 
alot from this list and have contributed when possible.  I will be back 
after winter break is over.

Hopefully I'll see some of you at the Gathering or Maybe Cloud Factory 
NYE or Origin's (But since I turned 21 last Monday I might hit the clubs 
and bars for this NYE to check out a new scene).  

Hopefully this will be a whole new list in Jan!

Smile, Happy Holidays and New Year to you all!

PLUR,

       Austin

<h2>Supreme Court to Decide Internet Indecency Law</h2>
<!-- TextStart -->
<p>
	    WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The Supreme Court agreed Friday to
decide a landmark case on free-speech rights in cyberspace
arising from a federal law that effectively bans indecent
material on the Internet global computer network.
<p>
	    The U.S. high court said it would hear a Justice Department
appeal seeking to reinstate the law's prohibition on the
dissemination of sexually explicit material to those under 18
years old.
<p>
	    Backed by President Clinton, the Justice Department asked
the Supreme Court to overturn a precedent-setting ruling in June
by three federal judges in Philadelphia declaring
unconstitutional key parts of the Communications Decency Act.
<p>
	    The nine high court members will hear oral arguments in the
case early next year, with a decision due by July.
<p>
	    The law, signed by Clinton in February as part of a
telecommunications overhaul, bars the distribution to minors of
indecent or &quot;patently offensive&quot; materials on the Internet,
which is used by an estimated 40 million people.
<p>
	    The law defined indecent as anything that &quot;depicts or
describes in terms patently offensive, as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities
or organs.&quot; The law does not target obscenity or child
pornography, which already are illegal.
<p>
	    Violators face criminal punishment of as much as two years
in prison and a $250,000 fine. The ruling barred the Justice
Department from enforcing the law.
<p>
	    The law had been challenged on free-speech grounds by the
American Civil Liberties Union and groups representing
libraries, publishers and the computer on-line industry.
<p>
	    They charged the law essentially bans indecent material,
limiting the adult on-line population to &quot;only what is fit for
children&quot; and transforming the Internet into the most heavily
censored form of communication.
<p>
	    Acting Solicitor General Walter Dellinger of the Justice
Department warned in the appeal that the ruling by the three
judges would have far-reaching consequences.
<p>
	    &quot;The decision ... imperils the government's ability to
protect children from exposure to sexually explicit material
that is now widely disseminated on the Internet,&quot; he said.
<p>
	    &quot;Equally significant, the decision leaves many parents who
do not want to expose their children to sexually explicit
material with little choice but to severely limit or altogether
deny their children's access to the Internet,&quot; Dellinger said.
<p>
	    He defended the restrictions as necessary. &quot;Patently
offensive material is widely disseminated on the Internet, and
computer-literate children -- of whom there are many -- can
easily find and retrieve it.&quot;
<p>
	    If the high court upholds the law, rapid technological
changes may result in new ways to restrict access to children of
sexually explicit material, Dellinger said.
<p>
	    Many commercial sites on the World Wide Web that display
sexually explicit content already use credit cards and other
adult verification devices to screen for age. Chat-room users
can set up rules limiting participation to adults, he said.
<p>
	    American Civil Liberties Union attorney Christopher Hansen
urged the justices to affirm the June decision.
<p>
	    He said the judges correctly found it economically and
technologically infeasible to comply with the law. The
restrictions infringe on constitutionally protected speech on
topics such as safe sex and gay rights, he added.
<p>
	    Lawyer Bruce Ennis, representing the other parties who
challenged the law, agreed the lower-court ruling was correct.
<p>
	    But he did not oppose the government's request for Supreme
Court review because the case involved the first application of
constitutional free-speech principles to an important new
communication medium.

FnF, like a lot of groups, is looking diligently for the right space to
throw a quality party.  There is no immediate plan for an FnF, but we are
working hard at it.

Thanks!

So how come is it that we get more angry at the person who calls out
injustice than the person who committed it?

I sense a dangerous trend here.

Also, can we please not use the word 'fuck' as a pejorative?  What's
_bad_ about fucking?  Thank you.

*** begin skippable digression about Disney ***

And for those who don't believe Disney isn't all harmless fun, check out
the messages that their films send.  I take the Lion King as an example
because it's the only recent one I've seen:

1) Leadership has nothing to do with talent and everything to do with
heredity (divine right of kings).
2) Females are helpless without the male around to lead them.  (Unlike
real prides, where the lionesses do most of the hunting.)
3) You can tell what others are like by what race and color they are. 
Jackals, for instance, are bad (note that they're black, unlike real
jackals), and Scar is dark-skinned too.  (Also note that in reality
lions frequently steal kills from jackals, being bigger.)
4) We are all helpless without the proper leader.  Once we restore him,
even his prey will rejoice.

Insidious, ain't it?  I don't claim that there has to be any conspiracy
involved, just a pandering to existing prejudice.

I have just one comment on this whole thing, and I've been trying not to
get sucked into giving it, but this finally tipped the scale (cause I feel
the same).  I don't think anyone really cares exactly what's going on at
this CW deal--I'm sure there are dozens, if not hundreds, of other New
Year's affairs far more non-ravey, non-PLUR, non-techno, whatever bugs
you--but the *claim*, by the CW producers, to represent the underground
dance culture (implicit, but definite) pisses people off.  The people that,
rightly or wrongly, feel themselves true members of the culture they see
misrepresented.  I think CW probably will be a fun party, though I wouldn't
pay to go myself, and I have nothing against people who will enjoy it, but
it does bother me that those people may go to CW and think that they have a
good understanding of rave culture and, by extension, me.  It's a natural
phenomenon, unfortunately, just part of the process that is moving rave,
house, techno, whatever, towards the mainstream.  What to do about it?
Beats me.  Just get up and do your part to distinguish whatever *you* love

People!

What is with this unsub bs..,since I've been on this list for over a year I've felt the heat of the flamethrower before: and I get over it...it's just e-mail,  yes there may be fools on this list but there are everywhere you go.  Do the people who are leaving want to go to a list where everyone thinks alike, has the same oppinions, smiles for no reason, sounds wack to me.  In the rest of the world people are rude, ignorant, stupid, why should it be any different here. This aint no digital utopia.
Just deal with it.... and at least dont just quit.

>Does anyone know of any raves going on in Las Vegas this weekend? Is there
>an emailing list for vegas raves?

Hello Ivan,

        Being a former Sin-city resident, I can tell you that the rave scene
there is pretty much dead.  Last time I was there (8/96), I tried my
damndest to find a rave (I was just in one of those moods, you know?).  I
came up empty handed, so took some Vitamin X and grooved with some friends
at their house.  I think the scene there is really unorganized right now,
but it looks somewhat promising.  I gathered from some talk that the local
DJs seem to like mostly West Coast progressive trance.  But whatever you do,
_stay_away_ from the weekly called Utopia, I made that mistake, it's held a
club that I can't remember the name of right now (Gee, what happened to my
memory?) somewhere on the Strip.  Basically, it's a bar with a pretty cool
dance floor.  I, personally, don't beleive that alcohol and raves mix.  The
night ended up really bad, basically a bunch of drunk UNLV frat boys making
asses of themselves and the second DJ I saw couldn't spin worth a damn (I
think Hellen Keller could have done a better mixing job, maybe he was
trashed too? :-) )  Ok well that was my $.02

If you want more info, I hunted down a web page while I was there,
http://www.unlv.edu/~bright/LVraves , not too sure if its still there or if
I remembered that correctly but it's worth a try, eh?

Happy Groovin',

Dear SFRavefriends,
	
	I don't think Jim meant to say that raves are only about PLUR, or
that PLUR is the be-all end-all of raving.  What I understood him to be
saying is that raves are about more than music and dancing, and I consider
that to be something worth saying.  PLUR is a simple saying, it need not
be taken as the sum total of everything we want to express, only a hint of
it.
	While the acronym PLUR may not have emerged until a couple years
ago, the scene's positivity that inspired it has been around much longer,
and I think was strong in many ravers in 1991-92 as it is strong in
many now.
	It's true that MTV could start throwing PLUR up on the screen, and
"exploiting" the term, or ravers could be ridiculed for it, as indeed we
already are being ridiculed for it even on this list.
	Personally though, if we as a movement/scene are going to be
pigeonholed, I think being labeled as people into peace, love, unity, and
respect would not be such a bad thing.  
	Should we take raves seriously, or just have fun?  Who says we
can't do both?  

PLURally yours,

	"Beyond Rage"

	They're a band.

	Who are they (really)?

	Where are they (playing)?

	Why are they (making it so hard for people who like their
			music to find them)?

	How are they (alive)?

	At least one inquiring mind (mine) wants to know.

	Anybody on this list know anything about them?


	P.S. to the "is this rave related" police:
		they do live tekno-ish stuff.

This may not be the song you're thinking of, but I do know that the UK
group "Dub Syndicate" had a song called "night train" that repeated
this sample that said "all aboard the night train". Whether that was
James Brown or not, I couldn't tell you; I always thought that it was
Bim Sherman (occasional vocalist for dub syndicate back then, now solo)
who was just singing that sample.

It's not techno, it's a unique blend of high-tech dub/mixing by Adrian
Sherwood played by both Englishmen and Jamaicans-living-in-the-UK which
thrived from about 82-90 in the UK and is clearly a forebearer of some
of the dubby sounds you hear in modern rave music (IMHO).

You can get the track on On-U Sound's "Dub Syndicate Classic Selection
vol 1" 1989. The single was previously only available on an import 12"
from Contempo Records (Italy).

PS: one of the best live shows I've EVER seen was a Bim Sherman show in
London ca 1988 with Adrian Sherwood on the decks and many members of
the Dub Syndicate "band" playing their instrumens (guitars, drums,
congas, keyboards, bass, etc). Yeah, the Spectrum and Shoom and the
Ibiza scene were fun too.

FYI, the reason why all those Helen Keller jokes existed is that the
press and politicians and people in power at the time couldn't actually
argue with her political activism (voting rights for women, labor rights,
socialist-tending ideology that made the captains of industry afraid of the
potential power of the people). So instead, they trashed her for her
disabilities, plastered the newspapers with cartoons and jokes about
her, and thereby conveniently got people to focus on her as a joke
so that nobody would take her message seriously. 

Nowadays, it's much easier -- one would just say, "oh she's just a
negative person who doesn't understand PLUR" and you'd effectively tar
and feather the message and the messenger that the establishment
doesn't want you to hear -- after all, this is the best of all possible
worlds and we should just accept our fates as being part of the natural
order. Let's all just be peaceful and fluffy while the man has his way
with us. SO drop another hit of X and bleat on little sheep, bleat on!

now that we have 20 minute extended ambient/techno noodlings that
starts from nowhere and ends up nowhere. now that we have a cult of
musician idol worship... it's becoming just like the mid-70's prog-rock
scene again -- boring! I think it's high time for a punk rock attitude
to reenergize the somnolescence of the rave scene... or maybe the next
clintonesque mothership needs to land and show us all how to groove
with the funk, pop us out of this suburban white rocker attitude. the
rave scene has grown long-in-the-tooth and boring what with much
talking about PLUR and not enough dancing and grooves and real honest
emotion (you know the kind that would make you bust out in tears of joy
right in the middle of the dance floor). I guess that isn't allowed
anymore, we just need to glue that sparkly plastic smile on our faces,
cast a veneer of sameness over vast underlying differences -- when you
pass people on the streets you say "have a nice day" like an automoton
but nobody really means it. I don't think that's what the "house
nation" was supposed to  be about.

(wake up ya bloody PLUR wankers!)

Discuss.

wouldn't that be nice - i found this thought especially amusing in the 
context of this:

replace ambient/techno with jazz-funk, and it sure sounds like an early
funkadelic album to me ...

Yes!

Chai can be enjoyed at home...

Dice up fresh ginger and cinnamon and cloves and cardamom and licorice 
and any other spices that meet your fancy and simmer them to create a 
tea.  Strain the tea, add lots of yummy natural organic sweetener and 
your milk choice.. enjoy to warm the body and soul!

There are many pre-mixed herbs available as Chai in natural food 
markets... I recommend, of course, Organic Santa cruz NUB Chai because 
it has been carefully blended from only the finest certified organic 
ingredients (no easy task).  

Organic Santa cruz NUB Chai will begin to show up in Bay Area stores in 
the next few weeks (even sooner if you request it of your local market!) 
but you can order it from us by calling 408-458-2071 or sending email.  
Also, for more information on Chai than is available anywhere else, 
point your web browser to the NUB in cyberspace at 

http://members.cruzio.com/~nubchai 

Happy brewings-

Hi, everyone! 

 I just moved up to the bay area about 2 months ago to take a cool job
in San Jose..  I was on the Socal-Raves list for a few years
(lurking)..  So I just wanted to introduce myself..  some of you have
met my brother Deeje, and some of you may have met me.. we did the web
camera a few weeks ago at a party up here, and everyone seemed to like
the idea.  We'd like to do that again, but next time, the web page is
going to be 1.) publicized better to other rave lists, and 2.)written
better so that we can have multiple pictures on the page at one time, or
even making a quicktime movie.

so again, Hi!  I'm going to avoid saying anything about that whole
conversation y'all just had.  There's so much traffic on this list, has
anyone brought up the idea of changing this to a newsgroup lately?

take care..
Steve Cooley

Short Reviews this month. Hope it's useful!
-alex

-------------------------------------------------------------->
Dispatches- Hidden Agenda- Metalheadz

Incredible considering the jazzy style they've been hanging with for the 
past year. Sharp, crisp beats as always, but they're charting darker 
territories these days. "Intelligent" doesn't even come close.
-----------

Split Personality- Total Science- Timeless

Also known as Q-Project and Funky Technicians, this 12" has one dark 
amen stomper and a more jazzy steppers track on the flip. Useful and 
quality.
------------

Da Flow- Tobestar- Glow

German Jungle which sounds a year behind the times. Nevertheless, top 
notch arrangement on all 3 tracks. Melodic, dark, uplifting...it's all 
combined to gether onthis great 12". Too bad the pressing's wack...
------------

Hardstep- DJ Rap- Proper Talent

Infectious hard jump-up number. One cheesy sample can be forgiven. 
Proper indeed.
-------------

1,2,3- Keen (ss rmx)- Formation

Another quality jump-up track from the formation camp. SS takes this 
song and delivers the craziest bassline I have yet to hear. Warp 10.
--------------

The 3rd Sequence- Photek- Astralwerks

Get this now. Master Rupert Parks has so much material recorded that 
even songs for video-games turn out like butter. From the Wipeout XL 
video gamesoundtrack, only 1,000 of these were pressed. domestic, too. 
Everything you'd expect it to be.
----------------

Hold it Now- Majistrate- Splash

Solid roller from one of the reigning kings. Deep and energetic. 
-----------------

The Wind Changes- Mission Control- Genetic Stress

Label that juno reactor releases jungle on. Cool mellow electronic 
piece. Will go over well with the intelligent crowd. Very pretty:)
-----------------

Bladerunner- Forensic- Flavour Vinyl

Amazing track is the Flavour label's 4th release. Almost like a Goa 
jungle song, but with incredible drums and bass-line.
------------------ 

Out There- Higher Sense- Moving Shadow

What is up with this label lately? Recent releases have been much harder 
and aggressive as of late. Really moving away from the wimpy edge of 
intelligent which they'd cornered. 2 solid hard but melidic pieces here. 
Out There starts off jazzy, but don't be fooled. Everything, the flip, 
is a sinister stepper.
---------------------

Beings- Tecnical Itch- Moving Shadow

Wimpy A-side by funky technicians. The flip side by tech itch, Beings, 
is a brilliant stormer with extra-terrestrial themes. Metallic and dark.
----------------------

Reprazent- Roni Size- Mo'Wax

Really good 2x12" from Bristols favorite jungle producer. Along with 
Tricky, Massive Attack and Portishead, Roni Size becomes the next star 
to come out of this unassuming town. 4 solid crisp numbers definately 
more on the jazzier tip than usual. Still dubby and sparse. For those 
who like reading between the lines.
------------------------------------

Well, I'm too tired to do more. Check out my top 10 on the sfjungle 
homepage. www.sfjungle.com/charts

the following is taken from the Praxis label newsletter in England 
(issue#10)

More and more signs appear that the age of techno is fading, that rave 
culture is finished, or become part of an industrand therefore stripped 
of the elements that made it interesting for us.  Of course that is a 
question of definition - and we should remember that the tyranny of the 
4/4 beat was pointed out years ago by some people (e.g. Force Inc. in '92 
when they embraced the more subversive potential of breakbeat), certainly 
with the domination of trance the 4/4 beat became a tool of power and 
control which eliminated the associate concepts of liberation.  From 
being futuristic and experimental per se Techno became a style and 
largely conservative.  Hardcore tried to escape this development by 
becoming even harder, faster and more extreme; but it is only a minority 
scene that is too busy with little feuds and sectarianism - attacking 
each other rather than the real enemy (like the entertainment industry 
for example, and its role as a ministry of propoganda for the current 
political and social system).  I am not proposing a hypocritical concept 
of unity here, the diversity is a strength, what i am suggesting is that 
changes are about to happen and a new scenery will establish itself in 
which neither those plagued with petty bitter jealousies nor those 
preoccupied with niche marketing will play a role.
     I shall quote from the book "The Sekhmet Hypothesis" by Iain Spence 
(1) where in one chapter he elaborates a thesis about the coming 
youth culture he calls "Storm" which comes after the Hippie / Punk / Rave 
trilogy and completes the "cosmic mandela", an ultra-aggressive and dark 
movement that is more militant and politically sussed than Rave, more 
organised than Punk and totally hostile to bourgeois society in general. 
 It will also be misunderstood and misrepresented as 
'fascist','totalitarian' and 'apocalyptic' by the media, but with its 
brutal force it will ravage old age values over the next few years...

naturally the politically situation is different with the ultra right 
wing criminal justice bill slingin rascal mystery schools (hell, even in 
ontario, canada we have governments with police welfare state agendas)... 
we need to move forward, not go back into punk... this cycle is 
complete... we have to evade "the game" once more... chaos lingers in the 
subgene xenophrenic... because we choose to know the score...
please. discuss.

Hi there friends, bruddahs, sistahs!

What's going on tonight? I NEED TO DANCE!!! Damn, I've got so much pent-up 
energy, I'm bouncing off the f@*%$ng walls!!!  I've got not sexual frustration, 
but something even worse- RAVE FRUSTRATION!!

What made it even worse, is that after listening to a jungle CD all day (which 
gets me wired!) I convinced one of my roomies to go out last night. The deal 
was, I would go with her to some Irish bar, if she would go with me to X-files 
or King street garage. Well, we went to the bar, then around 1:00 went to King 
st. garage, but through several complications which I won't go into here, did 
not go in. She wouldn't go to X-files, so we went home. How was King Street? 
Did anyone go? But more importantly...

WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYONE GOING TONIGHT???   Karma? or, the place on Broadway? 
How are the dj's scheduled for Karma- opinions, please. Or is there anything 
else going on that's not on the calendar?  


Vielen Dank fuer deine hilfe!!

Nathan


ps- I'm playing taxi tonight, so there may be space in the silver rocket (86 
jetta) for one or two people if you live in the city and are going to Karma (or 
somethng else(??))

You Wrote:
 "Beyond Rage"
 They're a band.
 Who are they (really)?
 Where are they (playing)?
 Why are they (making it so hard for people who like their
   music to find them)?
 How are they (alive)?
 At least one inquiring mind (mine) wants to know.
 Anybody on this list know anything about them?
 P.S. to the "is this rave related" police:
  they do live tekno-ish stuff.


I think their name is actually "Beyond Race", but I could be wrong. I saw them 
at Burning Man, and they blew my mind ('course I was pretty far gone to begin 
with!)  They had a drum machine, a "techno-machine" (don't know what it's 
called, but I see them all the time at raves), a live drummer, a bongo player, 
maybe a keyboardist, and a distortion-guitarist. Just an incredible sound- very 
raw, powerful.  I posted back then to the Burning man list about how to find 
them.  Someone else posted back a message with a phone number. Called it, left 
a message, never heard from them.  Possibly have an album, that may be sold at 
Amoeba in Berekeley?   If you DO find out where to buy  some of their music, 
would you please email me?  Thanks!!

     I have to agree that punk rock and techno/rave/whatever it's called 
     this week have many similarities. Punk rock was/is Do It Yourself 
     music. It was no longer necessaary to have the right suits, haircuts, 
     equuipment, accents to form a band. Guitar, bass, drums and  an 
     attitude were all that was needed. 
     From the raw energy of Iggy Pop wearing stockings and disfiguring          
     himself with beer bottles to the nihilism of the Sex Pistol's "anarchy     
     in the uk" punk spoke for a generation that felt alienated by              
     commercialism, corporate cock-sucking and the bloated, self-indulgent rock 
       dinosaurs of the seventies.
        Similarly, dance music grew out of a reaction to the stale musical 
environment of the 1980's. When I look back on that decade I see much pomp and 
preening but little real social commentry coming from the manufactured pop 
groups of the period. Spandau Ballet, Kajagoogoo, Duran Duran, The Human league,
ABC, Alphaville, and countless other lipstick and tea-towel wearing good looking
boys from middle England may have looked good on Top of the Pops but said 
nothing much to their audience about life in the real world. 
        In my opinion, the only real group of substance to emerge from the 80's 
were Manchester's The Smiths. This was in fact a group with real punk 
sensibilities, albeit playing in a more pop idiom. I think Morrisey summed up 
the whole 80's music scene succinctly in the song "Panic" : " Hang the DJ, Hang 
the DJ, Hang the DJ, because the music that he constantly plays says nothing to 
me about my life, hang the blessed the DJ".
        Anyway, back to the techno/punk comparisons. As sure as punk meant 
everyone could form a band with "three chords and the truth", techno meant that 
anyone that saved up enough to buy some basic equipment could put together a 
dance track in their own bedroom . No need to play the shmoozing game, 
developing an image, concentrating on market segments, having a musical vision 
watered down or altered by a producer who couldn't care less. Many a classic 
dance tune has been made inexpensively not in a 32 track recording studio but in
the home of someone with imagination, time and creativity.
        Many of the people working in techno today cut their musical/creataive 
teeth in the punk scene of the seventies. It is the whole DIY spirit that is the
most important comparison between the two scenes in my opinion. As punk reacted 
to the right-wing Tory  governemt, un-employment, stale rock acts with big stage
shows (Spinal Tap/Kiss anyone ?) and bigger hair, similarly the dance movement 
can be seen to setting itself up against the right wing. The government in 
Britain recently passed the Criminal Justice act. An act of Parliment which 
forbids the playing of electronically generated music in public places. Talk 
about targetting minorities. In retaliation, a group going under the banner of 
"reclaim the streets" has recently taken to turning up in public places in 
groups of up to 10,000 and basically setting up sound systems and partying for 
hours on end. 
        I've always felt that good music should have the power to move you in 
many ways. To make you feel happy, sad, angry, elated, ecstatic, relaxed, horny,
hopeful, etc.,. In the heat and confusion of a rave or party it may not be the 
time or place for political discussion but by virtue of thr fact that most 
people on the scene with a political/world view would tend toward Leftism then 
perhaps we have the means to force social/political change in ther same way punk
tried to....


Just my two pennies worth,


COH.

now that we have 20 minute extended ambient/techno noodlings that 
starts from nowhere and ends up nowhere. now that we have a cult of 
musician idol worship... it's becoming just like the mid-70's prog-rock 
scene again -- boring! I think it's high time for a punk rock attitude 
to reenergize the somnolescence of the rave scene... or maybe the next 
clintonesque mothership needs to land and show us all how to groove 
with the funk, pop us out of this suburban white rocker attitude. the 
rave scene has grown long-in-the-tooth and boring what with much 
talking about PLUR and not enough dancing and grooves and real honest 
emotion (you know the kind that would make you bust out in tears of joy 
right in the middle of the dance floor). I guess that isn't allowed 
anymore, we just need to glue that sparkly plastic smile on our faces, 
cast a veneer of sameness over vast underlying differences -- when you 
pass people on the streets you say "have a nice day" like an automoton 
but nobody really means it. I don't think that's what the "house 
nation" was supposed to  be about.
     
(wake up ya bloody PLUR wankers!)

If any of you South Bayers know awk and would be willing to sit with me for

     Hello all, I decided to put this letter into an  e-mail of it's own 
     with a new subject line. Also ran spell check to catch all those 
     mistakes. Maybe we can start a thread or something......
     
     
     I have to agree that punk rock and techno/rave/whatever it's called 
     this week have many similarities. Punk rock was/is Do It Yourself 
     music. It was no longer necessaary to have the right suits, haircuts, 
     equipment, accents to form a band. Guitar, bass, drums and  an 
     attitude were all that was needed. 
     From the raw energy of Iggy Pop wearing stockings and disfiguring      
     himself with beer bottles to the nihilism of the Sex Pistol's "anarchy 
     in the uk" punk spoke for a generation that felt alienated by          
     commercialism, corporate dick-sucking and the bloated, self-indulgent 
     rock dinosaurs of the seventies.
     
     Similarly, dance music grew out of a reaction to the stale musical 
     environment of the 1980's. When I look back on that decade I see much 
     pomp and preening but little real social commentary coming from the 
     manufactured pop groups of the period. Spandau Ballet, Kajagoogoo, 
     Duran Duran, The Human league, ABC, Alphaville, and countless other 
     lipstick and tea-towel wearing good looking boys from middle England 
     may have looked good on Top of the Pops but said nothing much to their 
     audience about life in the real world. 
     
     In my opinion, the only real group of substance to emerge from the 
     80's were Manchester's The Smiths. This was in fact a group with real 
     punk sensibilities, albeit playing in a more pop idiom. I think 
     Morrisey summed up the whole 80's music scene succinctly in the song 
     "Panic" : " Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, because the music 
     that he constantly plays says nothing to me about my life, hang the 
     blessed the DJ".
     
     Anyway, back to the techno/punk comparisons. As sure as punk meant 
     everyone could form a band with "three chords and the truth", techno 
     meant that anyone that saved up enough to buy some basic equipment 
     could put together a dance track in their own bedroom . No need to 
     play the shmoozing game, developing an image, concentrating on market 
     segments, having a musical vision watered down or altered by a 
     producer who couldn't care less. Many a classic dance tune has been 
     made inexpensively not in a 32 track recording studio but in the home 
     of someone with imagination, time and creativity.
     
     Many of the people working in techno today cut their musical/creative 
     teeth in the punk scene of the seventies. It is the whole DIY spirit 
     that is the most important comparison between the two scenes in my 
     opinion. As punk reacted to the right-wing Tory  government, 
     unemployment, stale rock acts with big stage shows (Spinal Tap/Kiss 
     anyone ?) and bigger hair, similarly the dance movement can be seen to 
     setting itself up against the right wing. The government in Britain 
     recently passed the Criminal Justice act. An act of Parliament which 
     forbids the playing of electronically generated music in public 
     places. Talk about targeting minorities. In retaliation, a group going 
     under the banner of "reclaim the streets" has recently taken to 
     turning up in public places in groups of up to 10,000 and basically 
     setting up sound systems and partying for hours on end. 
     
     I've always felt that good music should have the power to move you in 
     many ways. To make you feel happy, sad, angry, elated, ecstatic, 
     relaxed, horny, hopeful, etc...,. In the heat and confusion of a rave 
     or party it may not be the time or place for political discussion but 
     by virtue of the fact that most people on the scene with a 
     political/world view would tend toward Leftism then perhaps we have 
     the means to force social/political change in the same way punk tried 
     to....
     
     
     Just my two pennies worth,
     
     
     COH.

      It seems that the horrific torrent of mean and NRR stuff that belongs
on private channels has finally slowed down.  I checked my mail several
minutes ago and found everything that belongs there:  party reviews, music
reviews, music-related discussion.  Maybe the weekend brought about some
good vibes. I dunno.  The purpose of this is simply to thank everyone on
this list for (seemingly) calming down. This is a valuable community and it
hurts to see so many members unsub -- on less than voluntary terms.  We've
weathered the storm and now it's time to rebuild.  Thanx for listening =)

     What is the differece between a clubber and a raver ? 
     
     As far as i can make out a rave seems to entail having my eardrums 
     battered into submission by Goa trance for 10 hours and if this is the 
     case I don't want it. I'm sure there are renegades going on that cater 
     for more than the one type of music, but where ?
     
     And while I'm at it. I Don't mean to dis Goa which I was into a lot 
     more a couple of years back, especially as the people that go to these 
     parties are the coolest/most beautiful etc.,etc., but if you are 
     throwing a Goa party PLEASE PLEASE have an ambient room. People need a 
     place to chill/retreat. 
     
     The open policy ambient room at Karma tonight sounds cool.

>>Response:

If the ideals of peace, love, unity, and respect are ones in which we as
ravers or humans wish to incorporate into our life rather than the ideals
that are opposite or move in the direction towards the opposite than by
living this we must become these ideals and others who see ideals working
for another will change for that reason.

If the world is eventually to see world peace then words like peace, love,
unity, and respect have to be so imbedded into our collective conciousness
and must be understood for what they have to offer us rather than the only
looking at them as ideas or slogans.  And yes MTV and Coca cola will have
to assist in spreading this message.  Why would anyone want to keep the
ideas of peace, love, unity, and respect underground.

Why fear what others will think of you if truly believe and practice your ethos?

Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, Understanding, Compassion, Unconditional love
... I am not ashamed to be labeled any of these ideas and hope, pray and
visualize the mainstream effects of these ideals in place upon the world.

Only by integrating these into society and raising spiritual awareness can
world peace come about and dissolve the dominator paradigm that we have
been living under for so long.  All these ideals have made attempts into
the world through religions or other groups such as the 60's but hegemoney
took over suppresed them through division, rules, policys or what ever to
see that true ideals were not upheld.  With raves this is happening through
cliques and egos.  Personally I have always seen the parties as a stage
that brings us together to celebrate to the music the ideals of peace,
love, unity, and respect.  I don't see these ideals as being a part of some
cult practice.  Loving and respecting another means loving, respecting and
understanding anothers logic and differences but no longer keeps them in
division against each other.

An example that the "Church", that preaches love, has brought in that has
been used to control people is the institution of monogamy that we uphold
in this culture.  The institution of monogamy breeds fear.  If we truly
lived in an unconditional love society there would no rules because there
would be no fears we would not harm each other because we would have no
fear driving us to harm, regulate or control others.  We wouldn't choose
one over another we would love all.   Homosexuality and even incest
wouldn't be thought of as taboo.  Sounds crazy huh?   We would be like
children promiscuously playing in the Garden of Eden.

[the following text written by my roomate Susan. -brian]

"Vibe So Thick You Could Eat It With A Spoon"

        The space was excellent, the decorations were glorious, the music
was sublime, and the vibe was maple syrupy, sweet and thick. Tyler
particularly enjoyed giving anteater kisses to all the shiny happy people.
Here are a few highlights:

        --Dave's proposal to Tuvee!!! the music kept building and swelling,
so i knew something was up, then a glowing "Marry Me Tuvee" banner was
hoisted aloft. a huge circle of cheering ravers formed around the couple,
for amazingly intense energy.

        --the kiddy pool filled with big 3D foam snowflakes. I met Bridget
&    Mick lounging in the pool-- we instantly became "foam friends" and
they spent the morning recovering at my house

        --dj tom's set in the morning! for the first time i was able to let
go and dance myself into an ecstatic state. i have never been so
un-selfconscious; the music left me no choice but to jump, shake, scream,
and grin.

        --meeting:
                -Aphrodite (Heather) who _radiates_ beautiful energy
                -Eric, who came with 250, yes 250, Blow-Pops (tm) to give away
                -Jamie, who was at his first party, on his first E, who
                 completely understands - he's part of the family
                -kelly, who is tuvee's dad. {a raving dad- it just doesn't get
                 and cooler than that}

        Lowlight: grafitti in the guy's bathroom. the dance studio is a
wonderful space and i'd hate to see us lose it...

        This party was 100% happy. I'm prone to really worrying about
trivial little things at parties- last night I didn't think at all, I just
felt. Many hugs to the stupendous Lepidoptera crew; they are now on my list
of "can't miss" parties.

Love and oozing golden vibes to all,
Susan & Tyler-the-Raving-Anteater

talk is cheap. even in this wonderful scene, so many people talk about PLUR
but don't demonstrate it. hearing "plur, plur, plur" can get tiresome when
the words seem empty, which i think was the original complaint.

ok, I'm not new to the scene.  I've been partying in LA for a few years
now.  In LA, there was no concept of "Goa Trance"...  not at the paties
I was going to, (FAMILY, fresh produce, insomniac, Insight, Equal) ...

Is "goa trance" the music that has no beat at all, just weird things
bleeping in and out... just pretty much random noises?  Or is it the 4/4
acid trance.. kinda hard, maybe 140 bpm.. heavy analog use..?
or something else altogether?

disclaimer:  I'm not trying to start a lengthy flame war that devides us
down the middle over what we consider to be "Goa Trance"..  please. :) 
*email* me what YOU think "goa Trance" is..  posting it to the list may
not be the best thing to do.  I've seen the Socal-raves list get crazy
over a topic like this.. :)

          First off I'd like to say I just moved to the Bay a few weeks ago
and I wuz wondering if anyone could hook me up with the 411 on the dopest
raves.  It wuz easier in LA, even the 7-11's had lists.  Now that I got that
out of the way I'd like to say although I see the similarities with raves and
punk what about the funk era?  I see more similarities with the funk of the
60's and 70's then punk.  Dance to music with a dope beat, have sex, and if
there's time left over trip out on ecstacy too.  A lot of the stuff worn to
raves comes from the funk era , glow in the dark paint and the whole
whatever.  That's all I'm trying to say, and I have an open mind so you can
try to change it if u want.

well, the goa trance that _I_ have seems to be good uptempo 4/4, about 
150 or thereabouts. lots of high end hypnotic soaring things over a 
relentless beat.  The only reason i know this is goa is cos it says so 
right on the tape.  otherwise, i would have assumed it was just plain ole 
trance :)

    I have now heard from two people independently that the name
of the band is "Beyond Race", not "Beyond Rage".

    So does anybody know anything about "Beyond Race"?

 P.S. to the "is this rave related" police:
  they do live tekno-ish stuff.

 P.P.S. to the "is this race related" police:
  it's not race related. it's only a name. damn fine name, though.

Wow I'm sooo glad I went!  I met susan and tyler-the-raving-anteater (and
tyler gives super cool anteater kisses! =) Eric was an amazing bundle of
positive energy, and Jamie had a really cool experience!  I really missed
warm raves like that with phat thick vibe, and it felt really good to go to
one again..  I didn't dance much because I seem to be fading from the joy of
trance... I guess my heart is in house/jungle/ambient raving now... that's
what reaches in and moves me.  Ah well, but still still I had an awesome time!
Warm thanks to everyone who came, and special thanks to Victoria for
introducing me to so many new beautiful and positive friends,
plur...

The early settlers of North America set up missions to school the Native
Americans in the ways of religion -- to embed the idea of salvation into
their collective consciousness.  The settlers' intentions were good, they
really believed that their way was *the* way to a better life.  What wound
up happening, though, was a near total destruction of the Native
American's culture.

So... in what way does your goal of ingraining PLUR into the collective
consciousness differ from that of the early settlers?

And this will be accomplished by attending raves?

Now there are PLUR-like things I do appreciate: when I step on someone's
foot accidentally while moving through a crowded rave, I apologize and I
get a smile and a pat on the back in response.  Or when a total stranger
offers me water while dancing.  Or when there's a goddamn *rainbow* in the
sky at F&F when the sun rises, the warehouse door rolls up, and people
tumble out dancing to house.

I think the danger lies in formalizing experiences like these into an
ideology.  My knee jerk response to "peace, love, unity, respect" is
"just do it".

Heelo SFR,

You know, I really never thought I would write this at this time.  I am
pretty much a stalwart, and am not likely to retreat, but after some
reflection, I have decied to leave SFR permanently.

The reasons are varied, but to say the least, I find the actions of many on
the list to be arrogant, and short sighted.  I have found a rave "religion"
to enter the list, and it is really not to my taste.  I have seen long time
contributors to the list heckeld for not upholding some dynamic the more
vocal ones adhere to.  I have found many new people on the list to be open,
but some others to be a closed-minded as the people they despise.

My most recent interaction with one of the more "elder" members of the
list, to be less than tasteful, very judgemental, very predjudical, and
generally  very shrill.  I have found the attitude of SFraves , over the
years to be very open, and generally open-minded.  I have found, in the
past, the people on the list open to new ideas.  I have had the great
fortune of inciting enough discussion so that memebrs of the list would do
thier own thing.  F&F is part of the result.  It was because of OPEN
discussion that it ever came to pass.  This and a host of other SFR-type
events are due to open and free dicussion.  Often times of things that are
not RAVE RELATED.  It has also been my fortune to make friends with the
people I have had the most lively discussions with.  Neils P. Mayer being
one of them.  Phred, Larry, Sun...Jeno, Markie, Martin, Preston, Jack D.,
Ethan, Bryce, Brenda B., Moni & Tom, Roxy, Amy S., Cassandra, and all you
other lovely sisters and brothers who escape me at the moment. and the
trest of you old-skool motherfuckers!  Love you guys, seriously!

But as I was told, things change, get with it.  It seems to me the
open-mindedness is gone.  Replaced by the drone and happy go lucky PLUR.
Something touted but often not practiced on this list, nor in life.  To
some people SFR is a major part of thier life, it is no longer just a
party, but a church.  And I don't want to be known as the artist who did
"Piss Christ" in this church.

I have plenty of things going on in my life, rave and parties are
definitely a back seat item.  But I look at SFR than so much more than
parties.  It thought it was a good thing; the dicssuion of 209, race,
colloquialisms, etc.  I think all these are about rave, because these are
all about the experiences we have at parties.

One of the things I had to think about is "What value do I provide to the
list?"  I have my criticisms of others, but in the end I have to look at
myself.  I can say this, I hardly go out anymore, primarily because I have
been there and done it all.  Before most of you, and will continue long
after most of you are as experienced, or jaded as I. Getting back to the
point, I hate long protracted battles.  I love argument, but hate to fight.
If I have to fight I want it to be very physical, so that I can feel each
blow, and deliver them accordingly.  Virtua Fighter I am not.  It just
don't translate well to this medium.  Debate?  Not on the list anymore,
things degrade to fighting and nothing is accomplshed except alot of bytes
being sent to plenty of people.  There is little argument, just preching,
and fighting.  Hta is CERTAINLY what SFR is NOT!  I often define things as
to what they are not that way what they are becomes much clearer.

One of the reasons I haven't gone to any SFR events can be seen through the
eyes of Jack Diamond, who has gone to far more events than I.  I have
always found SFR to be very cliquish.  But that has not stopped me from
making friends from SFR away from the SFR sponsored events.  To me this is
golden.  I am sorry that I have not had the good fortune to meet many of
you, but you will know wherre to find me, at Wicked or Stompy, period.
Nope I am not open to new shit. Why?  Becuase I know what I like ,simply
said.  I go to some smaller events, by the Good Times Kids, and of course
D7 parties when they happen.  UG's will always be  a part of my life, but I
cannot share them here or else hear the cry;s of "Why didn't you tell us?"
to which I reply "why didn't you know?".  UG should be that, publishing a
UG to the list is not UG to me, but maybe that may be one of my arcane
rules. UG's are word of mouth, not word of computer, IMO.

Some beefs:
I would like the lot of you to look up the word racist, not the redfeined
for your digestion by the more "vocal-that-be" on the list, but the
perscribed definition.  And please check yourselves.  I checked myself to
day and found some bigotry, but racist, no.

People, you can redfine what words you want.  Do not be suprised if someone
in the real world bucks up against your SFR definition.  We exist, here on
this list, as a subculture.  Just as hip-hop does to the larger culture.
In the end, bad is BAD, dope is DOPE, and a racist is a RACIST.
Colloquialisms or not, there is a defninition, and unless it is accepted by
the bulk of humanity, you are left in subculutre status.  Is it any wonder
people within the same super-culture and same country cannot understand
each other?  It is becasue of the flexibility of language.  Unfortunately
for language reality crosses.  I cannot walk into Apple and start throwing
around my redefinitons (colloquialisms) of things.  I have to be
understood.  The same with you.  So please next time you want to call me a
racist, be sure we agree to the definition.  And no , it is not ok to label
me unless we agree. It's the human thing to do.

Just because I say that Larry is Asian, I am African-American, and Jack D.
is white, does not make me a racist.  Look up the word.  It may make me a
categorizer, it may make me annoying, it may make me plenty of things, but
a racist?  Get real folx, get real.  Unless you have felt the sting of it,
please do me and every other person who is reminded of it in the
super-culture, shut up, you really don't know what you're talking about.  I
truly think that if this list were comprised of mostly my Jewish bretheren
(Iam I racist for citing Jewish?), we would probably not be having the
discussion of what is a racist, since both sides have felt the stings, in
history and recently.

have time for what I see to be the rampant religion and intolerance on the
list.

I found parties  much more fun when I didn't know as much as I did.  The
same can be said of SFRaves, I was alot happier when I didn't even know
about it.  No, I have no regrets.  One of my good plas , my best friend, I
met over argument on this list.  His name is Geoff White, and he will
always be my homie, in the true black, African-American, Raza, Son Of
Abraham, sense of the word.  I have learned much from him and will continue
to learn.  I leave he and other warrirors to the fight that looms ahead.
For I think there will be much more nonsense, more religion, and more
predjudice than even he can shake a stick at.

As for the ladies; Sisters, I am really sorry if I sadi anything to offend
you.  My Bra & Booty Betty's was an attempt at humor, and it did not take
into account your feelings.  I meant it in fun, but am sorry I ever used
it.  I am sorry.  I have great respect for the ladies.  I never hit on any
ladies while at parties, and have enjoyed thier company for the most part.
So, for you my sisters, keep up the fight, the boys are in the house, and I
do mean boys.

AS for the rest of you, my white borthers, my brown brothers, my yellow
brothers, and sisters in kind, much, much love.  I do hope you all get
along.

Sheeit, I've had a great time here, and hope that new people who come to
the list have as good of a time as I have had.

To all you newbie screwheadz, yo, it's all about having a good time.  It's
all about dancing, it's all about the music, and it's all about the people.
There are LOTS of good parties going on.  Do 'em all.  You ain't no damn
raver unless:
- You spend $35 to get into the party of the century
- You are excited about going to a party
- You dance your ass off and can hardly walk the next day
- (optional) You take soooo many drugs that your eyes are like slot
machines in vegas
- You catch the blue buddah, or at least see it.
- You make tons of friends, some for years on end
- You get to know who does what party
- You get to know the DJ's
- You get on the guest list (at least once) <- this is highly optional, but
you gotta at least try.
- You become an experienced raver who despises the term because you are now
a partygoer. ;)

Yep, that's it.

Yo baby, pump up the volume...Ima go and spin some records.  And that's
where I'm at today.

Much love, Much peace, I'm Audi 5000,
John

P.S.  There was a time, oh my little droogies, that we didn't need no
fucked up enumeration of PLUR.  It was understood in the dance, and in the
music.  The second you try to define something so special, and reduce it to
4 componenets, it loses that which made it special in the first place.
Just a thought; there was a time you couldn't define rave...but there I go
again, looking to history to understand today.  Man am I dumb.  :)  Audi 5

Well, as we've heard, it's actually Beyond Race.  They're an SF band, been
around about two years.  I love em.  Trippy blends of fast noisy funk and
different Mideast/Indian/tribal sounds, with a dash of electronica.
Sometimes hard-edged, sometimes very spacey and atmospheric.  Some good
players...I think they've had a slightly different lineup every time I've
seen them, but the core is a drummer and a pair of guys trading off bass,
guitar, and keyboard, variously embellished with didgeridoo, tabla, violin,
other drums, more.  They were at Be Here Now last week as, I think, a
five-piece--drums, bass, and keys plus an additional guitarist, so there
wasn't any switching around, and some more drums.  Seemed to be having some
technical difficulties, unfortunately--sound was bad, and they didn't play
long.  Like Nathan mentioned, they were at this year's Burning Man--they
played on the central stage after the burning, with a really elaborate
coterie of dancers and freaks up on stage with them, fantastically
costumed, including a huge puppet alien menacing the crowd [Cap'n
Crunch!--I ran into you there].  They also played the earlier nights, much
more stripped down, just out in the camp.  They were at last year's, too,
the same way.  They have an album, Reptilian Confunktion, but I don't know
where you'd find it (I got mine from them direct).  For info, try
415-331-1500 x407.  I haven't called, but it's on the album liner--"ask for
Dan or Phaaron."  I've seen Dan and Phaaron (Aaron) at occasional raves,
and I've gotten flyers for their shows there, too.  Keep your eyes open!

What? Are you nuts, your asking for a feed back. You should automaticly
know how terrific your rave was? How can you even question the fact that
there might be a slight chance that even one person had a bad time. This
must be one of the best raves I have ever been to. Had a great time. I
loved it so much and it made me realize that we have some great people in
our scene. Everyone was so nice and loved each other. This was truly an
amazing rave, maybe the essence of what raves were when the vibe was the
best in the world. It had a vibe i never felt before. I felt so
incredibly comfortable there. I felt like i could do anything.
Please, please, please throw another one soon.

Lepidoptera had to have been the best thing to come our way since...
since...
I dont know. But whatever it was it was the best possible.

Incredible that this was their first rave ever.

The location was CLEAN. Can you beleive that? I didn't find my pants
dirty or anything. I went home feeling sweaty, but not dirty. I sat on
the dance floor and it was dry. Not wet & dirty.
I had sooo much fun

DJs were hellza good.
Music was great.

I met so many people there, but can't remember anyone's name. I am sorry,
but there were so many names to remember.

There was Apherdite (Heather) she was with Lepidoptera and she was so
cool
There was Adam, who I met in the girls bathroom. He was cool too.
And there were about a hundred others which i will describe here.
Some girl who was really nice, who asked me to make her some pants like I
made my friend Anny. The pink fuzzy ones. She said she was going to email
me and whould hit send when she got home.
Some really cool guy with blue eye lashes.
Some gilr with plastic pants who was really nice.
This guy who was always sitting down by the entrance to the dance floor
with a big smile.
Some Club Kid with cool hair.
Some girl who was Eing for her first time, I met her early in the
bethroom.
Some girl who was wearing Red, White and Blue (I think ) and was blonde
with blue eyes and had a friend and they went to my web page at school.
Some cool guy with sparkle stripes on his pants and a visor with sparkle
stuff.
So many cool people that i can't remember also.
Probably forgot so many.
Oh and some girl with a Rave diary that people wrote in.

Most of these people are on sfraves.

If you met me there, email me.
I was the guy with the GI Joe shirt, a big whistle and i made the fuzzy
pants for my friend anny.

I loved Lepidoptera and i hope they throw another real soon.

The only thing I have asked from you intelligent beings is the capability
to understand others outside your realms.  Unfortunately all I have
encountered is intolerance.  Some of it surely from me, but for the most
part, over the past 2 years, I have said little, very little, a result of
me unsubbing last time, and being more tolerant.  Stop the categorizations
and the rubbish and get on with the dance.,  After all, that is why you're

This list is going to be godawfully monochromatic, boring, uninspired
if you're not here to check 'em and lend us your experiences.  I
personally think you should stay and perhaps we can all come to an
understanding that this is SFRAVES not SFPLURBAPTIST-REVIVAL.. You let
them win by driving out diverse elements and voices that don't fall
into the uniform drone of boring unintrospective groupthink. And you
make it easier for them to believe PLUR has a meaning because it is oh
so easy to think that a group of uniform race, outlook, ethos and
economics can all share common language/referents and appear to be
unified simply because they've effectively exluded diverging opinions
from ruffling the group featherbed.

Instead, why don't all the PLUR heads unsubscribe and start your own
list where you can drone on and on about how fluffy your teddy bears
are, and how you got glitter in your eye one night and thought you were
a fly. And any time anything that interrupted the monotonous mantra of
PLUR-testimonials started happening, you could all just reply in unison
-- "oh you just need a hug" (vapid as that may be over e-mail versus a
real hug) -- then the conversations could go back to the usual drone 
"i truly had PLUR in my heart last night: i passed out 12.1lbs of candy
last night, and felt a frightful lack of PLUR from the diabetic that
refused me, as well as the overweight person who said he was on a diet
 ... i then affixed 131 stickers to 131 bodies, and told 13 people that
i didn't know that i loved them because they looked and dressed just
like me".... Groupthink posting that is tantamount to saying "look at
me, I'm so hip!"...

As far as I'm concerned, what's really going on in PLUR-land is you are
cheapening the meaning of the words Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.
Notice that PLUR doesn't include the word DIVERSITY. How convenient.
You can't have peace without war, you can't have love without hate,
etc. And I personally never thought the word Love should be diluted
into a marketing slogan.

At one point in time christian AGAPE had meaning, but how much LOVE is
present when that state of GRACE is reserved for the whitebread upper
middle class middle-amerikkkan nuclear family, not for single mothers,
single fathers, fatherless children, people of color, people of
different sexual persuasion, people of different politics, people of
different beliefs. When you can reduce a complicated concept to a
marketing slogan, you're just begging for trouble, as with AGAPE, as
with PLUR.

I think what happened was that Clinton et al wanted to do the crossover
thing given that extended psychedelic jams were the money-making thing
of the time. And black artists were still not getting paid. But it
wasn't long (like 1975-77) before they launched themselves into
mothership space with some tight funky numbers. Mothership Connection
AND Chocolate City albums were released in '75 and it was a  totally
new sound -- tight and emotional and booty shaking. I see the early
funkadelic era as chops-development for the group as musicians
exploring perfusing acid rock with a soul sound. The
parliament/disco/dance stuff of 75 was when the mothership really took
off. Their songs had a point, had a story (even if outrageous), and had
brevity, soul, and wit.  Real emotions were happening while Rick
Wakeman was pounding out has-been pretentious wanna-be classical music.
By the late 70's Parliament paid another visit back to earth finding
their black funk monolith misinterpreted into milquetoaste and treacle
by a bunch of white brits and australians and amerikkkan bandstand
sensibilities. SO they relanded to "rescue dance music from the blahs",
and hit us with their bop gun.

And it was an era of change, the MC-5, Iggy, Bowie were in the air,
punk's ugly (but truthful) head would be rearing by '77. The Meters had
just partially completed a tour with the rolling stones, introducing
funk to the white rocker audience....

I couldn't go, but I do have a question:  Is there a meaning behind your 
name? What is the definition of Lepidoptera - I've never heard it before.

ever-craving more knowledge,

Omigod, are you kidding?  Please try the animal shelters!  Look in the phone
book under shelters, or SPCA, or Humane Society, or under the city or county 
listings for shelters!  There are so many cats and kittens that need homes,
and there just aren't homes enought for all of them, it's so sad (dogs too).

Take care.....

Greetings,

I have recently moved to the SF Bay Area from the Reno/Tahoe area and 
am looking to meet other people either new to the area or new to raves. I 
live in San Jose and am looking forward to seeing what's out here!

Peace,
Hempman (Tony)

>     What is the differece between a clubber and a raver ? 

        CLUBBING: 
        You go out on weekends, pay $5-10bucks to get into a club
        at around 9 or 10pm (always the same location) sit around, 
        chat with some people, drink a little (or a lot), dance to 
        EuroDisco, House, and Pop music. The bar closes at 2am, most people
        leave and go home. If you are not 21+ then some of the above
        might not apply.

        Clubbers dress far too formal yet casual at the same time (I forgot the 
        word) in other words, Jeans, Nice Collared shirt, etc. (some of course
        might go to a club wearing a Tshirt, shorts and tennis shoes. The
        idea is (depending on the club) to pick up on someone else. (Cruising)

        RAVING:
        You go out on weekends, pay $5-15bucks and get to a rave at
        around 9 or 10pm (most of the time a different location). You
        can choose to sit around and chat with EVERYONE, Drinking (besides
        water is not usually found at raves) so people take things like
        E, Acid, Shrooms, etc etc. (drugs). Some people choose to dance
        for hours to loud repetitive techno, and some just decide to 
        relax and enjoy themselves and each other in the Ambient room.
        (depending on rave). Since there is no bar, the rave lasts 'till
        the sun comes up. Often till 7 or 8am. (unless the party gets 
        broken up by the police)
        
        Ravers dress according to their persona. The buy their clothes based
        on Color, Texture and Size and on who their character is. Some go
        to raves wearing fabulous fluoresent colored jackets and some
        baggy jeans, some go wearing just a tshirt and some will come in shorts 
        and some tennis shoes. The idea is to be yerself.

        Ok...I agree to this 100%. What if someone is 'Sober' at a party
        or are sick! and want to stay the whole night at the party but
        are a bit tired of dancing. Where would they go!?

>     The open policy ambient room at Karma tonight sounds cool.

        KARMA...(disappointed).. Where was the Ambient room anyway?

  What crap and condescending bull shit you whip up..... As soon as you get
your head out of your ass and quit being blinded by your own shit filling
your eyes - you can step (or perhaps you are now so blind that you will
fall) off of your thrown from where you've made yourself judge of the
universe....

  My beef with you is that you've become so mind blowingly self-rightous
in your pronouncements about how EVERYONE besides you and John on the list
are. THAT IS PURE BULL SHIT.... Now if you want to make everyone aware of
how SOME people on the list are like that - I buy your words... BUT your
BLANKET WAY, WAY overgeneralized pronouncements are more bull than ANY of
these people have EVER spewed.... Plus, YOU are being overly cruel if
not to say unkind in your pronouncements. I've met John and the smiling
man which I met was one of deep thoughts, feelings and comittments... IF
that man really thinks about what ( and the way you made) your post said,
he'll realize in a heatbeat that what you said comes from the EXACT same
prejudicial space that other forms of bigotry, racism and hate arrise from.
 
  Since I'm one of the "elders" who lurks on the list - I like, John, have been
there, done that etc.. BOTH in the rave scene and more importantly life itself.
Many of the people you would accuse are young and by taking the strong mind
drugs are opening themselves for the first time to the "potentials" of the
human spirit.... They are like young eagles trying their wings and soaring
for the first time but as such many don't soar as fast or as high as the
elder more experienced birds - so what? At least they're out of the nest.
At least they're loving someone, even if as you would accuse it's a smaller
group of ravers... later it will be others. In my youth people like Tim Leary,
Ram Dass ( Dick Alpert ), John Lilly etc. were doing the very same explorations
with in many cases, the same limitations, as you would accuse people on this
list of having. But once you begin trying to reach out - especially when it
involves opening your mind to expanded potentials, things have a way of growing.
Of course, at first many are trapped by the phenomenon of the experience and
many become over enthusiastic in their descriptions of the "joy" of first
contact with a deeper self. As life goes on, many will trap themselves in the
current of life and fall into eddies of tritness and shallowness, but I am
convinced that many of the "next" generation of great thinkers will some day
arrise from the rave scene ( and other "scenes" of course ).... BUT at first
there will be what I call the  "OH WOW look at that shiney glitter phase"...
( As I say this I see many of the hippies and explorers of the 60's doing
the EXACT same thing...) 

  I've been quiet thoughout this "funny" discussion until I read your last
post. Then your bull shit and implications of how "advanced" you are just
got to me... especially after arguing with Leslie last night about how
raving and its simple minded PLUR is not going to change the world directly..
in the final analysis MOST of raving is about going to PARTIES. It's just
a party folks. BUT because of the use of drugs and the opening of community,
it's a party of a difference sort and it will be the seed of change in many
of its individual participants. They will move on to things that grow beyond
the party EXACTLY like some of the people from the 60's grew beyond the
boundaries of the bull shit "summer of love"... the hype then as now was 
often way beyond the reality where many people like Clinton didn't inhale -
hell I even tried acid but I didn't absorb was, of course, the "unasked"
question answer.  Many of the people from the 60's and summer of love hipe
got high, got fucked( many times) , avoided the war ( once was enough here )
and then proceeded to fold themselves back into the mass of racist, greedy,
dishonest consumers that we are surrounded with today but (and a VERY important
BUT ) not all did.... So it will be with the ravers. So it's always been
with any movement. SO what's new there? 

  It's your condescending tripe about YOU and JOHN being the saviors of the
world by being the only ones on the list who are not PLUR churchmembers etc.
(Not your EXACT words of course BUT those WERE your implications.) So please,
do me a favor and take your stupid, bull shit ass else where - you obviously
don't enjoy it where you've put it, you think WAY too highly of yourself 
and you're the worst example of a blind "archie bunker" dumb shit I've had
the opportunity to read on the NET.... previously, I read your posts with
humor and thought of you as thoughtful but now you come across  as one of
the most bigoted dumb fucks I ever been mistaken enough to read....
Damn people who make statements like you just made who come in any color
make me mad.... I'm pissed as hell that dumb fucks like you even exist much
less on "the list" and I don't even give a flying fuck about PLUR as
preached by ravers.... but I DO respond to calls for respect as preached by
the likes of Martin L. King, Ghandi, M. Theresa etc. AND what you just
said makes their work all the more important and your thoughts about your
supposed superiority all the more small and trite.....

 Signed mad as hell,

Mike

        Hi Guys, I just thought I should review KARMA.
        
        Eric and I got the the mappoint at around 9pm soon after the line
started to build up
        (it almost seemed as if the party was on the street) Anyhow, payed
our 8bucks and headed
        on to 973 MINA ST. (between 10th and 11th). Got there at around 10pm
or so,got in. The 
        place wasn't all that IMHO. It seemed to be someone's house. (I
would love to have a house
        like that though). Anyhow, music was playing, people started dancing
and taking their drugs 
        (I had decided to be sober for the night... and forced Eric not to
take anything 'till midnight) ;) 

        Anyhow, at around 10:45 or so the music goes down low. People wonder
what's up. Some
        say the police are driving by or whatever... music comes back up.
5minutes later, the
        music stops. 10mins later it starts again... then it STOPS
completely and the DJ comes
        out and says the party has to end.

        So the police clear everyone out and the party is over at 11pm....

        SO, we headed down to the Friends&Family party just down the
street... (about 6blocks)
        Eric and I got in, the place seemed to have nice vibes, nice people
and nice music
         
        Anyhow, thats my feedback.
        love, harmony and art
        Pab

On Monday, Strange Universe(ch 44, 10 p.m.) will feature a story on
Burning Man.  It's usually a good show, they eschew the tabloid TV
approach for a semi-serious look at paranormal topics such as the
Unarians and Bigfoot.

Still on the list

Hi Ryan!   =)


 First off I hope your Mom has a happy 50th! Wow! I wonder what I'll be 
like when I get there.

 Second I would like to recommend to you (and folks on the list) to 
consider your local SPCA for pets. Many animals are put to death as no 
one claims them. Not only are you saving a life but you are saving 
resources and taxpayers money. An overall good thing to do. Plus you help 
to cheer up the SPCA workers who have one of the worst jobs in the world.

peace out,



Ran D.Dreams

don't worry about it. The people who post NRR stuff aren't to blame, it's
the self-appointed SFR cops who go overboard jumping on their asses who are
the real problem.

seems like the younger members of the list understand it in a special way...

I've never gained any enlightenment from anyone who likes to use the words
"back in the DAY..." but people with a fresh outlook on the things that are
happenning RIGHT NOW are the ones who seem to have the most to offer. If
you must dwell on the past, use its' lessons to brighten the future.

props to all SFRkids! (although I'm less than one year away from the end of
my teenage years, so I don't know how much longer I can be considered a
"kid")

Hi all!

 Well I heard Saturn might have something to do with all the (ahem) 
nastiness floating around the communication byways. Maybe it didn't hit me 
too hard as Saturn is my ruling planet. Of course I'm certain the 
holidaze stress factor had nothing to do with it.  ;)

 Ascendance was really fun! Pallokaville is a nice dancehall with wood 
floors. Sound seemed pretty good (for a shoebox ;). There is an 
alternative refreshment bar there (smothies and such) in addition to a 
regular bar. My fav part though was NO SMOKING!!!! I hate tobacco smoke 
and inhale way too much at raves in general (lousy ventilation in 
combination with the inconsideration most smokers show for non-smokers in 
combination with no in/out policys at most partys). This place has great 
ventilation and it never got too muggy.

 The music was really nice. Ther openers were the promoters (?) or maybe 
just one and a friend; Joe was playing some really nice trance (almost 
psi-trance) but the other person was playing something like a  
house/hip-hop/trip hop thang. Not so much to my tastes but okay if you 
like that stuff.

 Greg Sandler came on next and played his usual eclectic set; 
housey-trance, hard house and a tiny bit of acid and acid house. Very 
tasty and fun to dance to. Astral Matrix was at bat last and played some 
really good trance and psi-trance. My ride wanted to leave a litle early 
so I had to go. :( It was all good as I had to study.

 The decorations were simple yet very nice. The crowd was really friendly 
with a notable lack of hard looks from the usual hard look crowd.

 I'm looking foward to more Ascendance and recomend it highly to the 
Santa Cruz crowd!!

 It was nice to see some familiar faces there; Larry Ching, friends from 
SC and the extended Harmony family.

peas,

goa trance has a really simple 4/4 beat (usually in the 140-160bpm range, I
think) that keeps you dancing, but sits still in the background while
complex washes of layered 303 tunes and other shit give it a rich
complexity unlike any other kind of techno. if you're from LA, I'm sure
you're familiar with Thee-O's style: he plays straight up dead-center goa
trance. Around here, dj's to watch for are Dutch, Tom, and anyone from
C.C.C.

it's an interesting form of music, because each song is so complicated and
textured that it doesn't really NEED to be mixed. for example, goa gil (the
most famous goa trance dj in the world) keeps all of his tracks on DAT and
uses a pair of DAT walkmans instead of 1200's. apparently, he considers it
a desecration of the music to mix it up, letting each track do its own
thing. the result is that you can hear pretty clearly where the mixes
occur, but it doesn't matter because his music (I do mean "his music:" much
of his arsenal was produced by him, and exists only in his little box of
tapes) is so powerful... plus the idea of a 10-hour set of driving pounding
superfast techno is an attraction in itself.

if anyone disagrees, let me know 'cuz I'm in no way an authority on this
subject.

(don't tell anyone, but I had the time of my life last night!)  

(I went to a bad-ass party thrown by Tony...thick with vibe, smiles,
friends, joy, celebration, and the music that moves my soul...)

(It reminded why I'm a raver...I had forgotten!...It gave me hope for
the scene in this city.)

(It was the first time I felt truly positive again about raving...I even
wore glitter!)

(It was a beautiful night (and morning)...thanks! :) 
(but....shhhhhh....don't tell anyone, k?)

the happy phlea

Hi all!  =)


 Mantra was really fun!! 

 We had an all nite location (YEA!). The basement was used for the main 
dance floor, with the upstairs used for the ambient room. The dance floor 
looked really wonderful (as usual) with all the fluro banners and Dave's 
black-lites. Ravens altar was an amazing space again and Brendan's smart 
bar was perfection (and a main social area!).

 The music was electrifying! (sp?) Dutch on first. He was mixing his 
usual acid-trance seemlessly. I just loved dancing to his set and 
listening hard to what he was doing.

 Anon was on next. I didn't hear much of her set due to my work upstairs  
=(  but what little I heard brought a smile to my face.

 Caban was then on. He has a full on GOA sound not dissimilar to what I 
heard from Goa Gil when he was in town a couple months back, except 
Caban's sounded just a bit harder and faster. It really moved my body in 
that uncontrolable yet synchronus way that I love; busting a move to a 
break I didn't know (consciously) was coming, etc. .

 The next person I checked out was Jeremy Starseed. I really like the 
changes and evolution he has taken with his music since the last few 
times I've heard him. Really good stuff!!!

 I had fun in the ambient room but was ultimately not really happy. The 
doors that were used for the entrance were supposed to not have been used 
and I based my design around that preconception. Oh well (shrug).

 I was really happy that we stopped letting people in when we did. Around 
3 am we had this huge influx of the under 18 crowd. The basement got 
really slippery and muggy but one person said they liked the dance floor 
slippery. It was kinda fun. It would have been nice to have better air 
flow though.

 HUGE thanks to the folks that helped me!! Dhiran and Ben just completly 
kicked booty and C-Jay was indespensible in the morning with his good 
humor and help.

 Special bonus prize!! I met Nichole from the knowoneness list. YEA!! She 
is the first person from the list that I have met since I signed on. It 
was wonderful talking to her. I really felt a tunnel of calmness open 
between us as we talked.

 Also very nice was the young lady I met very near the end of the party 
whose name was way too unfamiliar for me too remember. We had an amazing 
discussion about trance states and their percursors and such.

 Some of you may have read my last post and noticed that I said that 
the next Mantra would be on Jan. 3rd. We don't know for certain that it 
will be so please stay tuned.

hugz y'all,


Ran D.Dreams

I rally like the Strange Universe Show.  If I can watch it, i record it 
so that I do not maiss an episode.  It is like (fore those of you old 
enought to remember) a peranormal and acult version of Real People, or 
the Riplies Belive it or Not, or Thats' Incredible.

But I am not writing this to inform you of my tv viewing choices.  I 
have a serious question.  

    This is something to think about.  This show has aired some realy 
interesting stories, and has made public things that I never new 
existed.  Strange sightings, ufo abductions, and bigfoot, yah sure 
thats ok, wee all belive in ghosts and aliens, and telepathy.  but this 
show has bradcast stories of things even I never heard of and mabee 
never would have been exposed to if I had not seen the program,  
Therefore I feel like it is a good thing.  But what about the people 
that make it their careers to solve these misteries, and are the true 
core fersion of the topics of the stories covered by this show??  do 
you think that they are happy or even like this show "trivializing" 
their reaserch.  Or mabee taking stories, and experiences that are very 
personal to them, and airing it out to the world??  Do you think that 
those people feel like there is some substance lost, or taken away by 
the show as the information is passed on to the uninformed public, even 
though the information is important to be shared, and needs to be 
known???
    And what about the TV station, arn't they just in it for the 
rating, which translate to comercial sales and the botom line of 
money??  Do you think this ofends the people or the subjects which the 
stories are based.
    But if it were not for this show, how would sa many of us find out 
about such reclusive events that are not in the normal media, andwhat 
about the educational benefit that these shows provide by bringing this 
type of information to the public??  It certainly does a good job of 
exposing unaware people, if just slightly to interesting subjects, 
sparking intrest in those who might waht to persuit it to a deeper 
level,....Mabee....posibly some people, but definently not all.

    Does anybody see were I am going with this analogy, or am I just 
working on my typing skills???     

    Yes, there is a lot of corolation between this, and the issues that 
were debated about the Massive Parties (Cool World in perticular) and 
the undergrounds feelings about them. 

    In every form of entertainment the isues of tradeofs and values are 
going to be debated.  The comprimises of dilution of substance, as a 
tradeoff for mass exposure are in every form of entertainment ever 
imagined.  It is a natural conflict that is all too common in the 
industry. 
    Yes, thats right, I did just imply that raving is an entratinmnet 
industry, and it is seceptable to all the BS that entertainment comes 
with.  
    The nice thing about raving, vs. amany other forms of 
enetertainmnet, is that it has stayed undergroung long enought to 
develop a fery deep and powerfull meaning and message that comes with 
it.  This message, In the form of PLUR, is very substantial, as we all 
know.  This is why so many people get so hot and bothered by the 
direction that raving is going. 
    Yes, It is all going to be mainstreem eventualy, and the 
underground will gradualy decline with the expansion of the market, but 
it will still exist, and its message will still be present in the mass 
exposure of the mainstreem.  This is where the most positive evect of 
the rave sceen,...Mabee.... will be felt.  By its efect on the public.

    This is where things get Lost, as far as the concentraton of PLUR, 
and a lot of the substance and meessages in the music, but the tradeoff 
is the knowledge and exposure of the message to a large audiance.  
Those who take it to heart will persue it and become true suporters, 
and those who are just touched, In any way, are still benefited by the 
knowledge they experience by being exposed to the music, and message.

    Evolution in any form of entertainmnet takes usualy 2 directions, 
which are usualy inversly related.  When any sceen is mostly 
underground, there is still a small aspect of it that is mainstreem, 
that is where it gets its influence.  When a sceen gets blown up and 
goes mostly mainstreem, it still retains a samller, but very focused 
underground origin, which serves as the source of the mainstreem 
reflection that becomes the publics perception of the way it apears.
(that is a hard thought to grasp)  

    Anyways, this hapens, and the easeist thing for many of us to 
undrstand is that it is enevitable.  The rave sceen will eventualy go 
very mainstreem, Radio stations, MTV, the groups Images , Agents, Huge 
Festivals, and so on.  And with this, the underground will take a new 
influence from the mainstreem, merge it with the concentrated rave 
underground, and remaining core, and a new underground will be born.

    This has hapened to RAP, Hip Hop, Grunge, Ragea, and is now going 
to hapen to raving, and after that probably to Gothis, and Jungle, ad 
everything else.  
    Change is inevitable.  Fighting it gives us character, and 
divirsity, and makes us all human.

Please do not get me wrong.  I love the Rave sceen.  I have spent the 
last 7 years of my life in it.  I am in no way sying that we sould lay 
down and let huge record labels, and holywood, and MTV rol us over like 
bolwing pins.  But I am trying to explain to those that have bothered 
reading this far, that it is natural, and the best thing we can do is 
guide the expansion of the rave sceen into its mainstream directiuon 
with as much positive influence as posible.  Going out and being 
present at large festivals, masives, clubs, and other forms of 
entertainment that are picking up the sceen and educating people on the 
meaning of PLUR, and its importance to the origin of the culture.  

If we do not make our presence know, the mainstream will eventualy faze 
us out compleatly.  This way we can make a stronger influence and feel 
positive about our contribution towards something that meens so much to 
all of us.

I am not sure why I wrote all this, but I just wanted to represent my 
perspective on whats going on in our culture.  Those of you who belive 
that raving is some form of religion, or a way of life, or anything 
more than just entertainment will never agree with me.  And I certainly 
wouldn't expect you to.  You are going to be the people whose beliefs 
will influence the next underground.  Weather its Jungle, or Politiacal 
Music(which is going to be very cool when it comes out) or spken word 
or rave-gothic, or Undeground Ragee....The point is that no one should 
give up their individuality or desires because of the natural course of 
entertainmnet, or eventualy, all entertainmnet, Music, and Dancing will 
go stagnent, and dull, and mabee even die.

Believ in Yourself....You are the one that will make the difference.

PLUR.   Ray Vonie.

You know pretty soon I think I'm going to start calling that place a Rave
Studio. But regardless Lepidoptera was a BIG positive mental pickup for
me. I NEEDED THIS PARTY!!!

Memorable moments:

Talking with 2V's Dad (Adopt me!! J/K), Eric's Bag-o-Blowpops, Sitting for
a spell with LeftJab, That guy (who was it??) who gave out thoes little
AA batery powered lights, seeing all the people that I love so much ( That
means YOU! ), having my keys returned to me even before I knew I lost
them (Whew! Thank You!).

This party was such a unique trip for me because Dave, 2v & Clinch
were some of the 1st really good friends that I have made during the
short time I've been raving. And it just totally tickles me pink to see their
party go off in a maijor way. YOU GUYS DID IT!!!!!

The things that pass for Raves now are just mere imitations of what once was.
Most of the people who participated when there tryuly was a rave scene don't
go out any more. This is sad but considering the attitudes expressed here and the fact that
folks seem to be more interested in who is the kooler most PLURRiest raver I'm not surprised.

Don't know what the solution is, I think carlos and I are gonna try to start up the FMR again.
maybe that will help.

I didn't make it either (*sigh*, judging from what people say about it),
but "Lepidoptera" is the scientific name of the order of insects more
commonly known as butterflies!  

                                {\/}
                                (/\)

Just keeping you posted with useless bio-trivia--  ;)

It true that there are many young people who still go to parties that do "get it"

they are the ones who stroke an Eed out "old (35)geezer's head" when his E is kicking his butt.

The raver girl who goes up to a "latino gangster" and offer's him a piece of candy eventhough
she's scared.

They've never heard of PLUR because they are too busy dancing and trancing to sit at a computer terniinal

I agree but if someone tells you that the water is more polluted NOW then it was 20 years ago
you had beter listen because in another 20 years it will be unfit to drink, some of the old  timers
are just trying to alert you to the fact that your making raving into a religion which is definitely not
living in the present, it's not living in the past either, it's living dogma, which is always a lie


hang in there, you'll still be young when the energy comes around again in 2012 :)

hi all:

we're preparing to put our RealAudio 3.0 server into full operation, and i
wanted to hear your thoughts on a simple question:

for 28.8 bps encoding, we've got a few options, but they all boil down to
the following: would you rather have (a) a mono codec with 5.5 kHz frequency
range, or (b) a stereo codec with 4.0 kHz frequency range?



also, for those of you who haven't heard, i have two RA 3.0 files on the
test server for you to try:

if you've got dual-channel isdn, point your realaudio player at :

pnm://mouth1.x-radio.com/x-radio/music/EQ2006/6.ra

and if you've only got a 28.* line, try:

pnm://mouth1.x-radio.com/x-radio/music/EQ2006/8.ra

both the tracks are from an Eye-Q release graciously supplied by Rich Sihiling 
( mailto:rich@eye-q.com ), so thank him if you can!

let me know how it sounds, i'm dying to hear the DC-ISDN myself!

take care,
pauly

I think the thing we sometimes continually reiterate is "if you don't have
anything nice to say, then don't say it at all." Fuck that (and I will use
'fuck' as a pejorative, b/c really all our swear words have nothing wrong
with them, ie whore and shit, ha ha)! Question always, question always.
Questioning indicates a search for what is real.

I prefer, "If you don't have anything nice to say, try not to be an
asshole when saying it." I found no question, or anything that could be
construed as such in the above statement, just an indictment.

Punk is even more moribund than rave right now, as a culture.  Doesn't
mean there aren't spots of genuine fun and coolness in both, just that
the "culture" has become codified, with lots of glossy magazines ready
to show you what a raver looks like if you're not sure, and about 10,000
derivative clone tracks for every genuinely innovative, booty-shakin',
foot-stompin', bouncing-off-the-walls track.

I see the problem as "Now that everyone has agreed to be nice to each
other, what's the next step?"  To me, this was the _big_ revelation of
the rave scene -- a bunch of total strangers being nice to each other
instead of projecting heavy 'tude.  And for the person who first
discovers it, it is a revelation indeed, and I don't want to trivialize
anyone's first encounters with it, or the fact that it is a wonderful
thing.

However!

All that this radical niceness does is _allow_ something to happen.  To
me, it almost feels like we're on this huge mothership, engines warm,
and it's still sitting on the ground because everyone's still so excited
about finding it, and after a while we start thinking that it's just a
big dance space.

This potential energy could go in any number of directions.  There's the
full-on Dionysian sex-mosh of Crash Worship (well, CW two years ago),
the extended-play art madness of Burning Man, the street
takeover-festivals of everything from Critical Mass rides to SRL shows
to Earth First! lockdowns -- add your own to the list, please.

Just some thoughts.

I guess I've just been thinking about that lately and well, whether or not
that statement was an indictment or not I won't go into it but let's just
say maybe it is something we should be aware of.

HEY RUDE PERSON!!! (not the people I know)

 I do not appreciate you taking the address's I included, on a post I sent 
out, just for your commercial purposes. The people I wrote I know 
personally and was giving them info I thought they may be interested in. 
Common courtesy would suggest you ASK (me) before apprehending those 
address's for yourself.

 Of course I guess I should thank you for alerting me to the prescence of

Subject: i go to raves, dammit!
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

ok, folks. just had to jump in to this one.

i'm getting really pissed off at some of the "older" ravers who keep
bemoaning that there just aren't "raves" anymore, 'least not like there
used to be...

especially when these same ravers don't go out to parties anymore.

y'know what? when you leave a scene (or a mailing list) because that scene
just isn't good enough for you, you are (1) sure not helping the scene any,
and (2) being just a little bit holier-than-thou, don't you think?

i really honestly believe that it's backwards to say "i'm not going to this
party because it's just not up to my standards"  -- 'cuz you know what?

_your external reality is a mirror of your internal reality_.

in "raver lingo": Create Your Own Vibe.

what i'm trying to say here is this: if you believe and expect that a party
isn't going to do it for you, guess what? it's not. not only will you not
have a good time, but you'll bring others down, actually affecting the real
vibe of the party. on the other hand, if you go with a good attitude, you
will most likely have a good time-- and if enough good attitudes show up at
the party, the vibe _will_ be rich. i've seen it happen.

and for goodness sake, anyone who has posted negative material on sfraves
has no business complaining about the negativity on the list. your
negativity may be a mirror of the list's, but you'd better believe the
converse is true too.

so if you want to believe that raves don't exist anymore, go right ahead
and believe it. just don't show up at my party if you're not fully ready to
have a good time. and don't subject me to this belittling crap.

i've only been raving for 4 months, so what the hell do i know, right?

i know that i have seen people transformed by what we call raves. i have
seen my life totally turned around. i have seen one of my closest friends
change from one of the most negative, unpersonable people i'd ever met into
a positive, loving human being. i've seen raving provide a much needed
support group for many friends with difficult issues. i've seen people
learning to discard their inhibitions and DANCE for the first time in their
life.

i've seen a hell of a lot in four months-- more beauty and positivity than
i'd seen my whole life before that.

if you belittle that, then you're putting the nails in the coffin of
whatever's left of that precious rave scene whose supposed death you're
mourning.

love to all, and respect to those who haven't utterly pissed me off--

brian

Well, after venturing to the city for a job interview Thursday and making
it to Davis with the help of my friends, I found myself wanting a party.
My buddie Joe was itchin' to dance and so was I and seeing as I don't get
to spend enough time with all you happy people, I wanted a good old
fashioned SF rave, ya know what I mean?  Anyway, as Saturday evening drew
upon me, I found that I had no way of getting to the city as every raver
in Davis was going to a house party in town (with the Davis DJ posse:
Hannibal Selecta, Jeyson, Jericho, Brian, etc.).  My personal vibe got
thrashed as I realized that I had let down my friend who really wanted to
go have fun in the city.  

So I ventured across town to the house party.  I found the greatest vibe!
Now, I have to say, the Davis house parties that I describe aren't the
bumbin' bass, get a chic go get laid kinda house parties that you'd
normally expect in a college town.  These parties attract the ravers and
extend into the morning with solid breakbeats and skillful DJs and folks
who seem to really buy into the whole PLUR thing.  Anyway, the party
started with a little group that consisted of a drummer, a guy with a
keyboard and a rad sampler and a very talented singer.  It was kind of
Portishead-like and a great start to the vibe.  Then the decks came out
and the wax started spinnin.

Of course, I loved Jeyson's set, but the highlight of the evening was
Hannibal Selecta's old skool techno set.  With the old skool revival
ripping through SoCal, I felt right at home.  The DJ of the evening award
has to go to Jericho, however, as he kept the folks jumpin' until damn
near 2.30am.  This boy has some real talent and it's amazing how similar
his musical tastes are to mine.  He's a great guy.  :)  Check out his show
on KDVS sometime!

Anyway, I know that I let down my buddy and that makes me feel really low,
but I did get to hear some great tunes and show him that there is an
active scene right under his nose that doesn't require much more than some
shoes that are good for walkin' in.  :)  

So the trip north was good.  The interview went well, I danced and I got
home in one piece.  Can't ask for much more!

PLUR!!

ps:  I'm not leaving the list :) *HUGS TO EVERYONE*

Health Report:
 Starting Friday , I got progressively sicker at work, and finally left
30 minutes early due to a strange weakness. I've been sick with some
sort of intestinal thing from Friday evening until tonight , Sunday
evening. Slight nausea, fever, and an ache in my guts in the area 
between my ribcage and my navel after I ate anything. My wife Mary
took very good care of me, and I got a lot of sleep. Feel much better
now ( - actually, I knew I was going to be better tonight when I woke 
up at 5PM and thought it would be nice to have a medium-rare rib eye
steak, nice and warm from the grill, with me grinding into it bare-handed
like some velociraptor ...)

 Anyways, I haven't read my SFRaves email since Friday afternoon -
sheesh! Too much to reply to individually or in detail. Here's
some short takes -

RE: SFRaves Stuff Recently
 I said this to Randy when I saw him at ASCENDENCE - SFRaves can be like a
family reunion get-together. Two of the uncles start arguing about some
damn thing or another ("Clinton's nuthin' but a goddamed fornicator
draft dodger!""Well, your Perot's a nutcase with too much money who 
wants to be an American Hitler!") , and the rest of the family just 
moves off and has conversations of their own until the temperature of
the argumentation lowers.  

Punk Rock Comparision
 Something I remember from the early days - I think The Dammed and some
other punk band was touring in England with some other more established
( pre-punk ) bands , in the time period just after The Sex Pistols first
album had been released. One thing a remember from the article was how
much condesending attitude the punkers got from their "elder" tour mates.
Of course, the journalist who wrote the story was definitly on the side
of the punkers, so what the other side of the story was, who knows?

I'd like to say something about this subject, but I think it deserves
more work than I feel like putting into a post just now, before I go
to sleep:

 Since I'm not feeling too energetic, I'll just use Randy's reveiew of
ASCENDENCE instead of writing my own -

 This is a nice venue. And I was wondering what was missing from my
hair when I got home - the smell of tobacco smoke ( just fog machine
juice )

 I liked their set(s) a lot! I've been over-Goa'd lately, and something
more funky was certainly called for! 

 Just before Greg's set, the last tune they spun was that Los Kings Del 
Mambo's song ( which proper title I can't remember just now ) with the
"I'm so in lovelovelove with you girl" chorus. It was so good to here
this! A real nostalgic shot - this tune was popular when I first got into
raving back in 1992 , and always brings back memories of Bonny Doone
beach and the One Step Beyond club in San Jose.

ditto!

 After the trance set he did some drum & bass! That was good to hear & dance
to . The closing music was good too -

 Seemed like the "Santa Cruz" type of crowd - mixed and friendly/tolerant.

I'm sorry that your getting pissed off but in my opinion this is true, but this
is just my opinion.  Some people said this back in 92 (that there were no
longer any raves).  I know it may hurt but I will still stand by the statement,
you need more than just an illegal party in a wearhouse to call it a full on rave.
Occasionally a party comes up that fits the bill, some of Ethan's FnF parties definitely
do. But much of the action that happens right now falls far short.


> especially when these same ravers don't go out to parties anymore.
> 

Well I don't go out to parties 3 times a week like I used to (the vibe just isn't there)
But I still might go out more often then you :) Just because you don't see me at the
parties that you go to doesn't mean I don't go out. I prefer smaller undergrounds these days
most of which are not on this list.

Hmm I can't agree with this, people make choices of where they party, get educated,
buy their food, eat out all on standards.  Some people don't go out because the
parties and people that they used to meet were so amazing and the Scene now just doesn't have those
types of opertunities anymore (or at least not as consistantly)


> in "raver lingo": Create Your Own Vibe.
> 
Some folks are trying, they are throwing their own parties or becoming DJs.
When you learn to DJ it's great cuz you have the capability to ignite the vibe in foreign places.

I myself am looking forward to going to Brazil sometime next year, to help 
a brazilian brother who used to live here get things started, I think Brazilian culture with is
earthy sensuality and love of music and dance is prime to be the next spot for Rave culture to explode.

This is very true, but you do need a critical mass of people who can consistantly
generate the Vibe to realyy make this happen else the only thing that happens is the
Vibe Generators just get burned out.

Negativity comes in many forms on this lists not nust in "negative" posts.
Besides sometimes the self-righteousness gets so high that a few short fused
people feel that the list needs some shock treatments.

I'm sorry you feel this way but I'm entitled to my opinion as well.
Therer aren't any be-ins or love-ins any more either.

No one is belittling those experiences, and no one is saying that Transformation is no
longer available on the dance floor, I've been to massives and seen it with my own eyes as well.

But things are different, the Police are different, the party goes are different, they have moved from
co-conspiritors to spectators and consumers.

Brian
the people who piss you off deerve your respect even more,
some times a little respect for your supossed ennemies goes a long way.

Eventhough I never liked and sometimes feared the cops, I gave them props
and proper respect and they very often would let our parties continue, Galen and
the Sun Set Crew are prime examples of what a little respect can do.

I'm going to planet new Year, it sounds hella dope. 15,000 people!!!  I'm
there.  What are the best new years raves? Where are y'all goin'? I was
wondering who the best SF BAy DJs are, like I said in another message I just
moved here and need more info.  What is the drug scene at the raves here, big
or small.  In LA raves were almost an excuse to get high.

Noah, I'm so so sorry you felt that I thrashed your vibe Sat. night!  You
didn't let me down.  I had a fabulous time at... who's house was that,
anyways?  ;)  It started a little slow, but before I knew what hit me, I 
stepped back for a minute, and realized that the vibe in that place was so
rich I just couldn't stop dancing, and I think I got the workout of my
life!  Yeah, we missed the city, but so what?  Another weekend, 
another opportunity.  And in considering what we had to work with,
I am absof$%kinglutely amazed what a blast I had!  For free!  And you
even got to spin (albeit, for only a few tunes)!  (btw, nice choices!) So
please please pleeeaaze don't feel down about it; I'm certainly not! 

(Virtual hug; everyone's more than welcome to join in on this!)

hey! i was JUST thinking that we should start a s-bay ravers coffee/chai
thang. my suggestion would be to have it at Cafe Leviticus (on The
Alameda, quite close to hwy. 880) They have EXCELLENT drinks, lots of
vegan desserts and a really beautiful building. my favorite cafe of all
that i've been to...and the people who regularly go there are a really
nice bunch.

...and digressing,

	This is just a thought, but have you thought about wearing ear plugs?
I always have two (one to use, and one to share :) ) clean sets in an empty 
film cannister in my rave-survival backpack (which elicits many stupid 
comments from bouncers, e.g. "Why do you go to raves/clubs to wear 
earplugs?", etc.).  This is not as lame as it sounds. The music volume 
at raves (especially by the speakers; my usual hangout) is literally deafening.
I am all for that 
sitting-with-your-back-against-the-sub-woofer-getting-your-world-rocked-by-the
-bass-while-dropping-a-pill experience, but there is such a thing as 
common sense. I have found that one (or dare to be safe and use both 
according to manufacturer's specs--I recommend the squishy yellow ones) plug 
half-in in one ear is enough to eliminate that shrill next-day-dog-whistle-
noise many of us have known. Besides, the music is loud enough that 
you _will_ hear/feel it through the plugs.  You can always take them out 
at any time (it helps to take them out during conversations--as well 
as your pacifier).

*Hugs*
MellowDrama


Post Scriptum:	I usually don't need my ear plugs when peaking, but have 
found them indispensable when raving sober.  Has anyone else noticed the 
difference concerning their ear sensitivity before and after a pill?

Well put John.

That was a nice lil' story. I enjoyed reading it.  I, in a strange sorta
way, hope that this was a true unsub and not a hallow threat. Since a
three part unsubbing message truly leaves a lasting impression....

Cheers John, may your Way be a true one...

--	Bad idea.  For anyone going to London to party for the first 
time, I suggest buying a copy of the weekly Time-Out at the first newstand 
(in London) you see.  And for your second purchase, make it a pocket 
sized color A-Z street index, also at the same newstand ;) .  For some 
reason (I still haven't figured this one out yet) almost all happenings, 
wether club/rave/party, are listed in Time-Out.  I don't think raves are as
frowned upon by the local authorities there as at home.  Of course, 
depending on press time and other stuff, flyers in record stores never 
hurt.

--	Thank God you didn't end up there.  The Ministry is basically a 
Palladium (I assume all SF'ans have somehow ended up there once in their 
lives) for rich Chelsea teeny-boppers.  The first and last time I was 
there, feather boas/bare midrifs/and halter-tops seemed to be the rage 
(it was supposed to be a smashing party as well.  It was put on by Puschka, 
and had some wannabe drag queens--Okay, i'm a bit judgemental there, but 
San Francisco has elevated drag into an art form--so I figured I couldn't 
lose...wrong.  
^	From what I remember, The Fridge (Brixton tube) offers two 
rotating Goa nights.  One was called Return to Samsara and the other had 
some similar name.  I believe one was a monthly and the other was weekly 
(or I could be completely wrong and they rotate every two weeks).  I was 
at the gala RFSamsara and wasn't too impressed.  Be sure to 
check the listings, 'cause you might end up at hip-hop night in this venue.
A cool place is Plastic People right on Oxford street (Tottenham 
Court Road tube).  It is a really small intimate club with good music 
that is super cheap (about 3 quid I think).  I really liked the vibe at 
club DTPM on Sundays.  It is a predominantly gay club, but there are 
cool ravers there as well _and_ the DJ's can _spin_.  I haven't had a 
silly grin like that on my face for a long time.  Besides, you won't find 
anything that comparable on a Sunday; all the Night-owls converge there.  
On the way there or home, don't miss out on the bus shelter that pumps 
excellent-- get this--techno 24 hrs a day.  Another good intimate club is 
the Gardening Club @ covent Garden (next to the RockGarden restaurant).  
That's were I had my first intro. to London Garage (I still don't know 
what it is--house/jungle?) in a Catacomb-esque venue.  It's somewhat hit 
and miss though, due to its variety.  I still have to find that 
ever-famous rave-in-a-hanger-at-Heathrow-airport party that keeps being 
mentioned to me. This is all I could think of at the moment (and probably 
angering the purists of SFRaves, but if Jonathan had some information 
before he left....), I hope someone can get some use out of this bandwith.

--	Depends on what you buy.  Only certain albums/music are only 
released in the UK (like Suede or certain Moby releases), so if you get it 
there, it wuold save you money from dealing with import prices--if you can 
find a source for that specific CD in the states of course.

Goa trance is very similar to any other kind of rave dance music... 4/4,
a speedy beat, ect.

I think what makes a track "goa" is a particular texture of the synths
used, and how they are layered.  Goa trance usually has several layers
of synthesizer sounds, including a several high speed, high pitched 
bleeping patterns that have a tendency to resonate inside of your head
and may serve to induce a trance state faster.  These blippy patterns
often sounds like "pure energy" being pumped into my head from the speakers.

All music blurs in and out of different styles these days, so it is unlikey
you would hear traditional, pure goa trance at a party.  It will probably
be mixed in with techno and other types of traditional trance music.

Personally, I am desperately awaiting the Goa/Jungle fusion!

Earplugs are an outstanding idea. I am surprised more people don't 
use them. What will kill your hearing the fastest is the 
treble/higher pitched sounds. Big bass isn't that detrimental to 
hearing.

The squishy yellow earplugs are pretty good. They are sufficient for 
most parties/clubs I have been. It is better to get 
fitted ones that have multiple gaps in them - they fit better and 
they provide much better ear protection, but I haven't seen those 
readily available in the civilian world. Maybe from doctor ?

Can't say much on how you perceive sound on drugs, as I don't use them, but using any sort of drug 
won't reduce your ear's physical sensitivity to the sound waves blasting the ear drum.

There should be a FAQ file in the archives about earplugs if there isn't
already.  This topic comes around about every 6 months.

I got mine from my docotor.  Just went in for a hearing test and told him I
was a dj/musician and wanted to check and protect my hearing.  We did a test
and found I had minimal damage but still within the normal hearing range.
They took molds of my ears and gave me custom plugs.  My insurance covered
all of it.  They work great, and I've even used them while dj'ing when the
monitors and headphones had to be screaming loud to drown out the sound from
the main room.  They cut out the harmful sounds while letting the rest
through.  I was told many big time muscians use this particular brand on
stage.  They are called "Rock Star Sound Suppressors."  :) Dig that name.
But hey, they work.  Being that this music and these parties we call Rave
are of primary importance in most of our lives, I think it's really
important for everyone to consider ear safety.  What would you do if you
lost your hearing?

Rick 

ps. They are also really good for campout parties where you can't really get
away from the music, just pop them in and go to sleep.  Used them at BM as
well.

On October 4th, Charity Productions first party (Charity =) )
was held, to raise money for the LACY (Legal Advocates for 
Children & Youth) program and the Omar fund.  

A check for $2059(!) was presented to LACY.  Charity Productions 
recently received a thank you letter from Rochelle McNamara, the 
Executive Director of the Santa Clara County Bar Association 
Law Foundation!    

This "thank you" really goes out to all you Ravers out there
who showed up and supported Charity!  I have reproduced the
letter below, give yourselves a hand, you deserve it!!  Special
thanks to everyone who donated equipment and time, otherwise
it could never have happened!

Thanks again for all your support, and I hope to see you all
at a future event!

Smiles,
     Chin

-------------------------------------------------------------

On behalf of the Board of Directors, my sincere
appreciation for the generous donation to our Legal
Advocates for Children & Youth (LACY) program.

We are very honored to be the first charity to benefit
from your Rave fundraiser and wish you the best of luck
on your future events.  It is heartwarming, indeed, to see
a group of young people interested in helping the needy
in our community.

Please know that the money generated by your hard
work will be used to help children to lead happier and
healthier lives.

Best regards,

     Rochelle McNamara

Hello survivors of the SFR Exdious....

Well, well, well, a fine weekend was had.  And I have the bruises to
prove it.

Friday-  House party in Mountclare.   Yours truly spun at this lil
event, along with German Progressive acid house DJ Sahid and the Hostess
of the party, (She doesn't have a DJ name so I'll call her Special
Guest).  The  party in itself was intimate with a younger crowd (17 -
21yrs) but with a message was conveyed ,throwing down a fine blend of
European acid and trance.  Things went strong till about 12:30 - 1 ish.
I helped break down/ clean up, chilled for a bit and  drove off to one
of my secret hilltops to watch the sunrise....

Saturday :  Karma  Dropped by F-8 to see an exasperated Mars running
around issuing tickets... 
The dilemma of space was very prevalent here... On one hand (talking to
Thomas Trouble)  the promoter didn't want to oversell the venue ( Thomas
called  2 or 3 times telling us "ok, stop selling at 275" ,  "Stop
selling at 300 it won't hold anymore"  
And on the other coin, partygoers coming from Napa, San Jose, Valejo
(even two from South Carolina) that would get really bummed if we turned
them away because of no space...
Helping Mars, the mappoint soul'd out @ 11...
The sight of some fine SFPD crusers greeted us (us being Mystr-E, Mars,
and a few friends ) @ the venue @ 11:30 .  Everyone was pretty much
mulling around giving info about the other parties going on  ( A friends
and family in the SOMA and another party going on in the mission @ the
dance studio).  Thomas was trying to get everyone to skate and come back
in an hr or two and restart the party, but the fire marshals had other
plans...

@ about 12:15 everyone pretty much went their separate ways, a few
people to whom I discussed with told me that FnF were letting people in,
"by invite only"... 
Which is cool, 
                     I guess.  
Although I do know of the FnF crew I wasn't invited , so off to the
Mission....

Arrived @ the dance studio @ about 12:30 and hit the dance floor. Housey
mostly but some trance, jungle, and breakbeat tossed in for good
measure.  Danced only for two hours, until I re-strained my leg...  So
now it's restive for Mr. Crazy Dancer  ( I NEED to be better by NYE).
Chilled for about 1 1/2 @ the venue until the police showed up @ 4AM to
shoo away all us happy scenesters...  
Two busts in a night, Guess the KARMA was on the Yang side Saturday...

Too bad no Sunday parties happen cos that would round of the weekend to
a T.  Maybe someone has a garage some of us happy scenesters  can spin
out at in the AM while listening to some cool tunes (I'll provide the
cool tunes...)...

With the current damage done to Mr. Leg.  the possibility of raving
might be on  hold for the next few weeks...

Just a note here.  I can assure that the party that you are referring to 
was not an FnF.  There were several people helping who do normally help 
with FnF but the party was a small party mostly organized by our friends 
Greg'n'Cindy and Tony.  In their promotion of the party they specifically 
told anyone invited that it was an invite only party and that the doors 
would close at 1am.  Thing s were going fine until unfortunately someone 
at the busted Karma told many people that they could use their tickets to 
get into tony/greg/cindy's get together.  We ended up having to be very 
strict at the door because of the influx of people, even turning away 
people who had been invited at some points because of the size of the 
space.  I was at the door part of the time and my feelings go out to 
anyone who was hoping to party that night but couldn't find somewhere to go!

love drenalin

> The squishy yellow earplugs are pretty good. ...

	Short of the incredibly excellent but expensive earplugs that
you can get from Kath Peck & the H.E.A.R. foundation in SF, my favorite
type of earplugs are the silicone things that are designed mostly for
swimmers to keep water out of their ears. They provide about a 25 dB cut,
but you can adjust this for more or less cut by thinning or thickening
the silicone. You can also use them to make the opening of your ear smaller,
rather than completely blocking it.

Hi all!  =)


 Once again my stellar ability to identify DJ's is biting me in the ass. 
I've been corrected and would like to correct my earlier statement that 
Jeremy Starseed played at the 12/6/96 Mantra. It was instead Douglas from 
the group I can't mention  ;)

 My apologies to the concerned DJ's and a tip of the hat to the person 
who pointed out the error of my ways. I'm really sorry Douglas. You were 
fantastic and had me dancing when I shouldn't have been  :)


hugz,

Make sure to look at the date in which the poor helpless little kittenz
will be terminated.
Try to get one that has no chance of survival unless you claim him today.
You need to pay for registration and shots before you can take the little
wuvinz home with you.
Make sure the kitty cat is in good health too.  That means no gooie stuff
in the eye ball.
Don't let the little critters sad face fool yea.
And make sure he stares you straight in the eyes.
Fluffy kittiez are a plus.

Lets face it.
  Were banned from San Francisco.   =[
  Rumor also has it that. The city of San Fran is only honoring club passes
to promoters. Meaning they will shut down the party at 2:00AM. If rumors
are true. Bummer.  San Francisco is like getting further away from my house
each week.
  There are so many warehouses in Oakland for lease... I ain't even
trippin.

OHHH MYYY!
		Bear with me. This is the first time I've been excited enough to post 
on this list. It's crazy--I just downloaded so many damn postings. I 
guess now I'm contributing to the havoc. Almost too Amazed to write! 
Lepidoptera was just incredible and to think that the idea had just been 
casually suggested during a visit to Dave Q's house. Dave!!! 
		Lepidoptera was so much more special to me because I knew Dave in high 
school before he met Tuve and to see how much he's become because of 
that love awes me. I could not keep my mouth from hanging open when he 
had told us he was going to propose to Tuve and showed me the ring. So 
many people special to me worked on this party and it became such a huge 
success despite "setbacks." 
	That studio is my favorite Location. It was a last minute thing too 
since the location they were supposed to use was raided on Thanksgiving. 
Small blessings.
	But God!!!Brett and I will never be able to step into that place again 
without going insane. It was those crazy photographs on the walls. The 
men had no penii and we were seriously convinced the women had no 
Vaginii. And the hotdog pictures afterwards?!Crazy.
	And most importantly I FELL IN LOVE with Youses. OK--you are free to 
go.

We Are Not

for their first party, these gals and guys pulled together a wonderful 
vibe. sort of a mixxed harmony/ gateway style, with great energy and 
enthusiasm, despite teh police and sound complaints people there made it 
great anyway...
it was nice to return to the studio, as i havent been there for months. i 
always enjoy teh cleanliness of that space... and it being winter, as 
well as big fans and not overcroded conditions, it wasnt nearly as hot as 
ive experienced it before...

cosmic love,
tom

Time for my .02c for all u2c on the state of raves.  
You really should read this for the better of the future of raves as we
know it.

I was clubbing in Chicago when the whereHOUSE scene was born.  The
housescene started in response to clubs becoming too expensive with
covers and too crowded with the suburbanites - the worst of ignorant
rank amateurs.

The dance crowd, a truly open mix of strait, white, latino, black,
didnt have the cash for covers or the tolerance for rank amateurs
flooding the floor. So they started the house scene. Chicago had empty
wherehouses everywhere so finding a FREE spot usually was no problem.
These non-public House parties kept out the rank amateurs, gave us room
to move, and were usually FREE. The vibe was positive - no bashing, no
bangin, and no suburbanites. I was drawn into the House in 1987 by the
Berlin Crew :). 

OK.  So, why are we "old-timers" dissin' the current scene?  The only
real shit I've heard and agree with is about the corporate raves - back
to paying $35 to get in?!!! And fucking waiting in line with 3,000
people? With fuckin wank meathead security!  Of course it sucks. Were
faced with what we left in the first place!

But my attitude is it's ever evolving.  I totally dig on how raving
really flipped positively when it returned from England - E took over
the snow monkey cocaine - and that's exactly what was needed - a new
more positive love child hyper drug - which probably made the dress &
scene evolve to its current state.  

I love todays raves - the technology, the visuals, the people, the
mostly positive vibe..........
(HEY GANGSTAs - try walkin through the projects at midnight, bangin
aint no shit to be you stupid fucks - wait till your faced with a
wacked trigger itchy twelve yr old packin a Glock - your baggies gonna
be filled faster than you can scream PLUR - death is final - you dont
need an agro attitude to be noticed or get respect - let go, be you, be
happy and live).

If any "old-timers" don't like the newer rave scene, just wait till
1999. Guaranteed there will be a corporate sponsored "free rave",
policed by a serious hardcore gang. Some gangstas gonna blow away a
raver front and centa'.  Happened in 69 at Altamont during the Stones
show (after their well documented corporate sell-out) courtesy of the
Hells Angels, to sadly end the Hippie 60s era. The way things are
going, MslutTV will throw a free rave, the corporates thinking they are
all hip with the hardside will get the Crips doin security, and Bang -
there it goes. :(

THATS WHY CORPORATE RAVES SUCK. Corporates are the death of raves. 
They are back to what we escaped (hi cost and rank amateurs*) and the
its leading towards the end. And thats why old-timers who really know,
can be legitimately bummed on the current scene.

Love what you have, and lets try and change the future.  Instead of
death and the end in 99, I hope someone gives birth front and center to
a future raver. And I hope to be right there, trancing my little mind
away.

* Rank amateur is based on ignorance and stupidity - not on how long
your in the scene.  Someone that is just a complete intruding idiot. 
ie. He can't handle his alcohol / drugs = he's a rank amateur.

Monday Night Dinner, (always at 8:30 pm) a different cuisine and location
 each week, yet somehow they all taste the same.  
 
 Dependably-bland dinner companions, gathering awkwardly each week to
 silently chew their cut-rate dinners (while expertly avoiding direct
 eye-contact with the Newbie on the other side of the table).  Surly wait staff
 always manage to surprise us with a new insult, and once again you can bet
 that certain person is going to be three dollars short on their bill!
 
 Everyone who reads this is welcome to come (I guess).   Be there or be
 talked about!
 
 Join our happy group tonight at:
  		Caffe Freddy's Eatery in North Beach
 
 Italian cuisine at 901 Columbus Avenue (at Lombard), San Francisco
 Telephone:(415) 922-0151
 
 Prices:   Inexpensive, entrees between $5-$9.  They spoke excitedly about how
 their veggie dishes could become vegan dinners, so vegans are safe to attend!
 This colorful North Beach retreat attracts a younger crowd, and is known for
 it's fine pizzettas, delicious pastas, and abundant portions.  Can you
 believe that they are also known for their sketchy service!
 
 Afterwards; we go mad at MAD, <<Bahia Cabana - 1600 Market @ Franklin>>
 Prizes too.

       An old woman came into her doctor's office and confessed to an   
     embarrassing problem. "I fart all the time, Doctor Johnson, but 
     they're soundless, and they have no odor. In fact, since I've been   
     here, I've farted no less than twenty times. What can I do?"
     
       "Here's a prescription, Mrs.Harris. Take these pills three times a 
     day for seven days and come back and see me in a week."
     
       Next week an upset Mrs. Harris marched into Dr.Johnson's office.   
     "Doctor, I don't know what was in those pills, but the problem is
      worse! I'm farting just as much, but now they smell terrible! What do 
     you have to say for yourself?"
     
       "Calm down, Mrs.Harris," said the doctor soothingly. "Now that we've 
       fixed your sinuses, we'll work on your hearing."

Adding to what Troy said:

It seems to me that most of the Goa that I have uses square wave LFOs
and MIDI clocked tapped delays alot (which I totally love!). That's
what gives it that strobbing, pulsating, 1/16 note hipnotic effect. I
love the "pure energy" it gives you, and this pulsating is a big part
of that energy. I workout to Goa every morning.

> Personally, I am desperately awaiting the Goa/Jungle fusion!

YEA! DO IT!

Hello,

Im looking for you!   Yes you, Mr (or Ms)  Jungle DJ....  I wanna hear
you mix your funky stuff...  You know who you are.  You come home from
work / school / wherever and jump on dem turntables (maybe MK II's, but
most likely Gemini's or realistics...)  mix for 1-3 hrs.  And although
they may not be beat matched all of the time, there are 3 or for
transitions that floor ya when you play it back on your Sony HF  60min
tape.   
Your a DJ in training, you don't think you got it yet.  Ya get a little
nervous when more than 3 people are listening to you spin live...  Every
set "could of been better"...  But I wanna hear you.  So you know who
you are,  email me back and I'll send a mixtape of my trance / hard-core
/ house whatever music.

O.K.?

""trying to spread the seeds of the underground..."

And if you don't spin drum and bass,   respond anyways..."   =)

Yes, MTV is getting in on the act. Camel (RJ Reynolds Tobacco) already is.
The corporate rave is not new. The idea has been alive and well in Europe
for years now. Rave is BIG BUSINESS. As soon as money and fame enters the
equation you kiss goodbye to your principles, unless you are very careful.
(Witness the political bullshit that already exists between promoters and
DJs.)

PREDICTIONS FOR 1997

More vibeless, money oriented parties.
Promoters who resemble your bank manager and insurance salesmen.
DJs who resemble Bon Jovi  -the DJ as rockstar. Can't wait for the videos.
Bad drugs in the scene, in higher quantities (remember the end of "hippy"?)
More kids getting fucked up on bad drugs, and not knowing why.
Hoards of clueless "ravers" who go 'cos it's trendy.
Bad attitudes.
Billboards advertising "raves"
TV commercials (we already have radio ads.)
DJs will get booked because of their image rather than their abilities
(this already happens to some extent.)
The music will get REALLY commercial and shitty and generic (it's getting
there already.)

If this is raving, then I quit.

Time to take the underground back. You have to create it YOURSELF.

RAVE IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE UNDERGROUND.

I'm going to planet new Year, it sounds hella dope. 15,000 people!!!  I'm
there.  What are the best new years raves? Where are y'all goin'? I was
wondering who the best SF BAy DJs are, like I said in another message I just
moved here and need more info.  What is the drug scene at the raves here, big
or small.  In LA raves were almost an excuse to get high.

	Actually, no one that has only been to raves in the US has ever
been to a rave! Nope sorry, all these parties fall far short, never has
been one, never will be. See, the only raves happen over in Europe, and I
am not talking the huge 60,000 Budweiser sponsored things, some people
call them Teckinvals now because everyone has distorted the meaning of
rave applying it to their own parties, just look at us here.... Hmmm, 
since they are not calling those raves anymore even though they started 
out as raves it actually looks like no one can ever go to another raves 
because they do not exist...
	I came into the realm of SF raves when the old raves were dying 
out and have seen parties which fit the bill far better since then. Where 
I was missing something in those early days, or if things just 
progressed, there still are raves around. There is a lot of "fresh meat" 
who do things some "old-timers" think silly or stupid, but be I guess 
they/we? are just being old timers....

I saw a fascinating documentary this weekend that really echoes this 
discussion about punk/rave underground sensibility and death by corporate 
takeover.  "HYPE!" chronicles the birth and rise of the "grunge" music 
movement in Seattle - a type of music I had previously held in some 
disdain because of its inseparability, in my mind, of the music with MTV 
and big record labels and packaged teen culture commodity.

But the documentary took me to the beginning, before the product of 
"grunge" had been retooled and packaged to be sold to me.  It explored 
the feeling of Seattle back in the 80's, all the tiny clubs where anyone 
could get up and play for their friends, how so many people came together 
and found a positive, creative outlet that drew more and more 
converts.  It was about audience participation and forming your own 
labels, making your own music.  It showed how punk directly gave rise to grunge and how the entire movement 
formed a collectivity intent on DIY, self-expression and group experience.

But then Nirvana's single hit and the corporate vultures descended on the 
scene - the place overrun with media, copycat bands proliferating, one 
sound being identified as "grunge", even "grunge" fashion layouts in 
Vogue.  Because of its marketability to "alienated youth," this concept 
of "grunge" was seized upon and sold, and its repackaged form was 
baffling to most people in the true scene, even people in the film like 
Eddie Vedder, who has of course become a multi-millionaire off of it.

The commodification of the concept, of course, effectively ended the grunge 
underground.  The movie was really a sobering experience - but also 
educational.  It really showed me the difference between the genesis of 
something, something real, and the form in which it is sold to mainstream 
America by corporate America.  We all know that corporate raving doesn't 
resemble what a lot of us think of as raving - in fact, I think it almost 
bastardizes the word until "rave" has lost its real meaning.  Rave as a 
concept, a product, is obviously being sold - just not on the scale as 
"grunge" because (record companies and MTV being economically short-sighted 
here) its potential marketability has not been realized.  I think MTV, 
etc. still think this is a passing fad (at least, I sure hope so!).

"HYPE!" also reinforced my feelings that commodification and the real 
experience are mutually exclusive.  To get real, you have to go back to 
the people, not to corporatism, which acts to homogenize everything in 
hopes of selling it to as many consumers as possible.  It's the 
difference between the crap that is mainstream radio and the incredible 
music we hear in the underground.  It's like the instant something is 
taken over and refashioned as a product, it is cannibalized by its own 
bizarre hybrid and is destroyed.

<sigh>
We need to keep the underground as strong as possible.  Let's not give 
into the cynicism of the "real world", abandoning SFR and treating each 
other with the coldness of capitalist culture - let's rededicate 
ourselves to creating the scene we want!  Because it really is up to us - DIY - it 
must come from the hearts of the people.  Who else will create it if we 
won't?

Much Love,
Nancy

Usually, I don't post a "me, too" message, but when it comes to this
issue, I feel I need to say that I agree with you!  I *do* enjoy being
washed over with sound, but I don't need to go deaf doing so.  I've been
using cotton/earplugs at raves for about 3 years now, and I'm glad to
say that I can't tell any difference in my hearing range. 

Please, people! use SOMEthing in your ears.  You're going to need your
hearing when you're older.  (I felt like a parent there.. whew.. weird)
..  but on the real, take care of your ears.. there's *no* difference in
sound, and in fact, you can hear a broader range of sound when you do
use some protection in your ears.

Oh yeah, and I don't wanna hear any of that 'Oh, it's already too late,
my ears are fucked up and why bother now?" ... 'cause that's bullshit! 
Cells *DO* regrow, and if you're not fuckin' em up every weekend by not
using at least a ball of cotton (last time I checked they're about $0.01
apiece) you'll be doing yourself a favor.. 

ok.. 'nuff said.  I just care, that's all.

not me, no, it was the spirit of Lucifer, forgive me lord, forgive me.

YALL, Switch! <- The Nigga You Love To Hate, Ice Cube, Amerikkkas 
Most Wanted

I heard my brothers and sisters voices calling me across the plain.  I 
heard their cries of woe as I left the fold.  I thought I could turn my 
back and start anew, but that was not to be so.  For I had left for them 
an empty space.  A space that would be filled with anger, intolerance, 
and most of all ignorance.  I knew then what work my brothers and sisters 
wanted completed.  I knew then my job was NOT done.

I AM BACK!

As the Great Minister Louis Farrakhan said To some I am a dream come 
true, to others I am a nightmare!.  Indeed.

After much thought and deep contemplation, I have decided that SFRaves, 
like the rest of San Francisco, is at a critical juncture.  Will SFraves 
become like the rest of San Francisco, washed out, lilly white, bland, 
like the Fillmore, like the Haight has become, like theyre trying to do 
to the Mission, or the other side of Potrero Hill (hows that for code 
words).  Or will it, like the Phoenix rise to the DIVERSITY it once had.  
I think my going was premature, this list needs some color, less it 
become as sorry, and as bland as its namesake San Francisco.  Nope, this 
list needs some color, and an enema.  It needs people who have been here 
for more than a tepid 3 years raving or listing.  It needs people who 
know the movers and shakers.  It needs people who still know what rave 
WAS (since there arent any any more), and what underground still is 
(since there it still exists in small WORD OF MOUTH pockets), it needs 
people who have seen the blue buddah, and have wiped tears off thier 
faces because the energy and the music reached deep spiritual wells.  
This list, like SF needs people with a sense of history, its , for lack 
of a better word, rave elders, who helped build this house we now all 
live in.  It needs people who can live in several worlds at once, 
understanding the delicate balanace between them.  It needs people who 
are raising children, one of the REAL and most SIGNIFICANT contributions 
one could make to a society.  It needs teachers who can show the new 
people what IT really was so that they may know what IT really is to 
them.  I may not be all these things, but I am certainly most of them, 
along with the others here on this list who have, paid thier dues, and 
done thier time.  As well as others who have learned through doing.  And 
those who just enrolled.

It takes more than a TV interview to raise conciousness, it takes real, 
and dedicated people who understand the value of what this is, and its 
place in the larger society.  For how would many of you know what a 
corporate rave was unless it was for the old-skool who knew what it was 
like to live in danger by throwing an underground.  Nope, I cannot leave, 
to many dummies and know-nots still out there.  Too many unititiated who 
think rave is some religion, complete with slogans, and methodology.  To 
many people not practicing what they preach.  Too many hypocrites and 
rules-makers who come from the ranks of the unitiated.  These people MUST 
be saved.  If nothing else, they must be taught.  I dunno if Im the 
teacher, or necessarily the ONE to do it.  But with my other brothers and 
sisters, whose voices mixed with mine make a beautiful chorus, we will 
strive to help the ignorant, or at least attempt to inform them of a 
different truth, a different reality.

Some have said I am spoiling it for the newbies.  No I am not, you are 
with your intolerance, and sloganeering.  Rave is about expereinces, not 
about an ethos.  Rave is about dance and music.  Bonus round for making 
some pals for the long term.  Double bonus if youre on a REAL guest 
list, that is in a list of people who you call friends.  The other kind 
of guest list is a bonus too ;), but that one pales in comparison to 
being with friends, listening to tunes.  Or buying records with friends, 
or going out with friends, or hanging out with friends.

As for the name calling categorizers who say what people belong and dont 
belong at raves, lemme help you out:  Fuck All Yall!  Everyone, I said 
EVERYONE belongs at parties.  As long as you are there, and cause nobody 
pain, you belong.  As long as you can be there in peace, you belong.  As 
long as you dont jump on turntables you belong.  If you want to cross 
your arms, and have a furrowed brow, you belong.  Rave is about dancing 
and music, rave is not about passing some silly-ass PLUR litmus test.  
Like I have said, the best parties were the ones w/o slogans.  The ones 
promising to blow your fucking mind with music.  Anything more is just 
hype, anything less aint nothin but a tea party.  Check you own damn 
selves.  So if you wanna wear some Adidas and call your homies from 
Potrero Hill, the Mission, Oaktown, or anywhere else, you are welcome as 
long as you come in peace.  And that is the ONLY pre-requisite to having 
fun.  I should know, I had all KINDS of hometowns in my parties, and 
never had any trouble.  Check that!

One more lesson for ya, and you know who you are: 209 is blocked!  NAH, 
NAH, NAH NAH, NAH! ;) No more rolling back the clock.  Thank g-d for 
liberal judges.  Thank g-d for some good BLACK African-American liberal 
ones to boot.

Black, White, Yellow, Brown, all points in-between.  African, Asian, 
Caucasian, all the same.  All artificail, I know, but all REAL here in 
the US of KKK.  Until such time passes, I beleive were all in the same 
family.  Making such categorizations makes one a categorizer, or a 
racialist.  Passing judgement, cuasing harm, supremacy becuase of it 
makes you a RACIST.  There are plenty of those everywhere.  Next time you 
buy some gas at Texaco, remember those jellybeans.  And I was NOT the one 
who coined the phrase, or I should say the people who did sure as fuck 
didnt look like me, nor act like me.  Get the point?  Didnt think so.  
Oh well, a lost cause anyway for the blind ones, for the ones who refuse 
to see a dual reality, since they never have to live in one.  Open your 
reality, and your mind, maybe your ass will folow and you will learn how 
to dance to the rhythm of life.

In your face, that is how I am sometimes.  Often times I will continue to 
be silent so you wont have to wipe me off ;).

I remain ever vigilant in the face of adversity, and lack of diversity.

To my brothers and sisters whose voices I heard, I love you.

I am here to stay.  YOU dont like me?  LEAVE! 

C-Ya,

DJ Chief Boot Knocka

But you may know me as John S. Lee

P.S.  I love you old-skool, and some of you new skool too!  Shall we dance?

P.S.S.  Less I be branded a hypocrite like some of you, here is a code 
word list and the real meanings behind the phrases:
-like theyre trying to do to the Mission, or the other side of Potrero 
Hill 

theyre refers to the power structure.  Who is primarily the wealthy 
white land barons who run this land-filled peninsula.  Theyre also 
refers to the political engine and its big headed leader one Willie 
Brown.  BTW, I like Willie, but I KNOW who he really represents other 
than himself.

other refers to the black side of Potrero Hill.  One side of that hill 
is pristine and one of the OLDEST neighborhoods in SF.  It is also one of 
the most desireable with GREAT views of the city.  It is like South 
Africa over there.  The whites live on one side and have walking patrols 
(I was there when they started that crap), the blacks live on the other 
side (BTW this is OJs old neighborhood, remember him?  hes The butcher 
with the sharpest knife has the warmest heart Simpson.) primarily in 
low income housing and projects.  But fear not, gentrification has 
already started, theyve moved plenty of the others to other places in 
the bay area, and are ready to make Potrero Hill one big milk factory, 
despite the impending defeat of 209.  yay..one great bland city filled 
with money grubbing yuppies.

Are there any other questions?  

My pleasure.

Bye now.


I must say, I had a good time with this message.  And yes, I am really 
glad to be back!

So true! THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN UNDERGROUND! 

I often get quite depressed about commercialism, submission to
institution, sheepishness, etc. At those times I repeat one of my
favorite mantras:

THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN UNDERGROUND! 
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN UNDERGROUND! 
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN UNDERGROUND! 

Then I remember that there are so many truely wonderful, original,
creative, glowing people who know how to have real fun without anger
or hate toward others. And as many as those are, there are always more
just looking for a way to become like them.

And of course "raving" won't be around forever, but the results of it
will, and the people will, and there might be something even better
the evolves from it! THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN UNDERGROUND!

Yes, I'm still here, and at this point, I'm not going anywhere.  SFRaves is
important to me, and so many of you are part of my life.  We have much to
learn from each other.

Because I took a stance in the recent inferno, I wanted to say a couple of
things that I believe to be true.  These are some of my fundamental
personal beliefs. Take them as you will...

1 ---------------------

The only thing you should expect to have in common with anyone on this list
is a love of raving ... but they may see raving entirely different than you
do.

Some people have been raving for many years, some have only been to one or
two parties ever, in fact there are people on this list who for whatever
reason (age, location) haven't been to a real party yet at all.  It's fresh
and new and eye-opening to some, and it's tired and redundant and burnt out
to others.

Some of us think it's only about the music, that it's just a party, and
some of us find a deeper meaning in raving that affects us and changes us
forever. Some of us pretty much have our heads in the clouds, some are
wisely realistic through observation and/or experience, some of us are
incorrigible  cynics and pessimists to the core.

Is there one right way to be a raver?  Obviously not.

There are many paths for many people, and each one is doing what they need
to do. So remember when you post that you are talking to 450 different
people, and don't be surprised when you hear a point of view that's totally
opposite of yours ... you might learn from listening to those points of
view, so it's always at least worth listening with an open mind.

2 ---------------------

The person you appear to be on the internet is probably very different from
who you really are.  It is critical -- if you want people to understand
your point of view -- that you word your messages as carefully as possibe.

Especially when you're talking about subjects that may trigger emotional
reactions (you'll usually know what those subjects are but sometimes
someone will come out of the blue with a reaction when you least expect
it).

Write and rewrite, edit and soften, try to read the words through the eye
of the reader who cannot see your face, hear the tone of your voice.  Work
hard to say what you need to say in a way that will be understood by the
people who read it, because if what you say just pisses them off, they'll
never be able to get your point.

3 ---------------------

Each one of us can truly make the world a better place, every day.  Whether
its on the internet, at the grocery, in your workplace or classroom, or
walking down the street, be someone who leaves positive change behind them
as you pass.

I'm not talking about shallow 'have a nice day' lip service, I'm talking
about making a real difference, even if its small.  Smiling directly at and
complimenting someone on the street, being gracious to others while
driving, simple politeness and manners are a great start.  Taking time to
help someone who needs help, to share what you have with someone else, to
give your time and effort to change something that needs changing.

If you act with an open heart and an open mind as your starting point, and
you make all of your encounters sincere and personal, you will be someone
who lifts the spirits and the hearts of others around you, and your
influence in the world will be felt.

4 ---------------------

The internet is not real life.  Use it to gain information, use it to make
connections with new people, use it for entertainment.  But be aware of how
your online behavior might be different if you actually personally knew the
person you are talking to.  Would you scream at them? Would you use
profanity and a nasty tone?  Would you call them names?  And would you do
it in front of 450 people?  No? Then don't do it, hiding behind the
anonymity of your computer.

Your rules of behavior online should be the same as the rules in real life.
Be polite, listen to other points of view (how else will you learn
something new?), avoid rudeness, don't embarrass people in front of others,
and if you don't like someone, you don't have to talk to them, just like
real life.

Show respect and consideration ... and remember that you have a right to
expect it to be shown to you in return as well.  We do not have to quietly
accept rudeness and personal attacks, but neither do we have to retailiate.
We can simply refuse to participate in that low level of communication.
It's your choice.

These are not "raver" rules, this is not new-age-speak "PLUR" -- these are
some basic guidelines for civilized behavior.  Of course you can disagree
with people, but do it in a respectful manner, and you'll usually get the
same in return.

5 ---------------------

People change.  For those of you who just started raving, or just fell in
love, or just started anything, cherish that excited feeling, but don't
forget that you will evolve and change and your feelings will change.
Better or worse, they will change.

Nothing stays the same, and we wouldn't like it if it did.

One of the biggest lessons I've learned in life is that it's important to
see when you're "over" something, and do something about it.  Don't let
your unhappiness fester, because it just makes everyone miserable, and
you're wasting precious time in your life being unhappy.

Everything we do in our life is a process, it goes up and it goes down and
it changes. When we learn what we need to from something, or when our
interest wanes, that's the time to move on to find something else that
sparks your passion again.

Whether it's your romance, your job, or raving, when you need a break, take
a break. When it's not fun any more, then move on.   If you're not happy
any more, figure out what's wrong, and take responsibility for bringing
that excitement back into your life with something new.  Change can bring
wonderful new experiences into our lives, so embrace it.

6 ---------------------

Don't live in the past, don't wait for the future.  This is now, and it's
all we have.  Make today count, because no matter what you did yesterday,
no matter what you're hoping for in the future, this moment is all you can
count on.



I am looking forward to seeing this list regain its momentum as a forum for
some of the most interesting and interested people around to discuss their
likes, dislikes, ideas, concerns and experiences.

Some of you feel shy to post (no wonder, really!) and some of you are such
lurky lurkers you don't even want people to know who you are (ah yes, but I
do, V!) -- but each one of you has something meaningful to contribute.

Share your ideas and thoughts, and try to make them from the heart and with
some substance.

For those who may find this post "preachy" ... oh well, after all, I am the
Fairy RaveMother.  Sometimes.

Much love and support,

Leslie

The evolution of the 'rave' scene has got me thinking a lot lately.  At
one point a few months back, I was talking to a friend who is a professor
at a local University.  He said another prof's son was doing documentary
research on the punk scene, so as to create a record of what the scene
really was and to try to lend academic validity to the experience of it.
I started thinking, hey a cool Master's program would be : Counter Culture
in America:  'Genreation X' and the Rave Scene.  Is anyone out there
thinking of/working on this kind of thing?  With all the talk about how
much the scene has changed, I bet in a few conversations you could get
enough sociological data to create a real sincere and kick-ass thesis.  
Or should we let the scene become documented only by Hard Copy
'investigations' and faded memories of an Altimont-like event with a
day-glow MTV hanging in the background?  I am starting to give this some
serious thought as a project, so if anyone else thinks it might be
interesting, let me know, okay??
PLUR
KEEP RAVING!

I liked your message... well put. I have come very close to leaving sfraves
a couple of times, either I get fed up or feel like I've outgrown it. But
then I realize that you can't just ignore a part of something you love. You
can refine your relationship with it, minimize that part or purify it, but
you can't really turn your back on it. Otherwise it will just keep tapping
you from behind, and start itching at and annoying you. I'm sure that some
day, maybe even soon, I will unsubscribe... but it will be because my life
will be so rich with other things that I lack the energy to make my
relationship with it worthwhile, not because I think it has turned into a
negative thing. cause the only real negativity is in me, and if I see it as
negative, it's the perfect place for me to try and start spreading the
positive, and help myself grow into something more than I already am.

But more to the point, welcome back. I'm glad to see your kick ass spunk
shake this list and help it to shine.

I will never see it. Your public postings will not reach me as well -- it's
all good. Also, feel free to add my address to your mailfilters -- I will
be happy to register a resounding thud as my ASCII hits the bitbucket. This
way we can customize our world-view to correspond to our tastes or

 I like your point. But I don't think the music will get to commercialized
though.
 Well atleast not "underground"
 Bon Jovi DJ's.  Thats comedy! Long hair, bleach blonde brunets with lip
stick, head banging over turntables. Scratching while posing for the camera
all trying to be pretty for the little ravE girls. Strap on turntables for
optimal stage presence. Eddy Vetter & Neil Young on four turntables.

 To be honest though.  I want MTV to film me at a ravE sometime in the near
future. I would love to give my contribution to the ravE, to anybody in the
world interested in Techno and dancing.

 Any tips for a future mix master?  =]:..
 How bout a list a the first few affordable things I should get to create
music from the ground up. Drum Machines, Keyboards, Recording tools and
technics, ect.
 All I really got right now to create music, is my lungs, my body, and my
soul. And most of that don't fit on tape.

I think I am gonna dance for awhile before I goto bed all sweaty.

Sometimes mother knows best, other times she is as clueless as Mr. Smith
(remember him from "Lost in Space"). There are plenty of "mothers" of the
rave scene, all sisters, like:
Charlotte, Dani, Nikki Rivera, Stephanie (DJ), Gina, Sally, Trish, Sharon,
DRC, Maria, Diane, Stephanie (promoter),Polywog, to name a very, very few.

These ladies are the pioneers of SF Rave and are long to receive THEIR
propers, they helped forge and build this house, They continue to
contribute positively and constalty to an ever changing scene.  They are
the bomb!

Just a shout out to MY ladies.

Peace out,
John

>From my humble beginnings as a techno-enthusiast, I later came to know a
wonderous realm of beautiful people and beautiful music that came together
in a fusion of love and dance. The music and the people created a mystical
atmosphere and a generation of energetic individuals with love in their
hearts and rhythm in their souls. Everything that encompassed this realm
became less of an escape and more of a way of life. For the earlier part of
my life, I had been living in something of a temporal present that gradually
unfolded itself into a romantic lifestyle of futuristic subsistence. This is
where I stand now. When I drive down the long freeways toward Los Angeles,
the expanse of intense road lights become the hazy glow of some dense
metropolis in a fanciful japanimation flick. When I stand outside on the
steps of a cafe, I smoke a cigarrette with the style of a hard-edged
day-dreamer straight out of some future landscape not yet realized. Im sure
some of you may feel the same way. I could be wrong. I know some of you feel
different. That's simply because its true. We are different. We are the
future. It it us that make up the embodiment of a premature generation of
loving individuals, slowly but constantly creating a utopia of love and
light in which music of the future unites us in a dreamscape that will
eventually become a reality. It begins with a positive attitude, which I
know you all carry with you. Sure, we get upset at times and have a negative
outlook on a lot of things, but we are humans. It is the foundation of our
minds that count, the love that swims through our consciousness. We are the
balanced people that the earth has been waiting for to come along and take
society under our wing for the sole purpose of letting love loose into the
heart of mankind. We have danced with each other, shared the same smiles,
gazed upon the beautiful things in nature, and done it all on our own. We
are a team of spiritual soldiers and love is our weapon. We inject love into
everything we come across and that is our power. I am proud to be a part of
you all, and I hope you all realize how special you all are. Don't let hard
times get the best of you, share your love with others and they will do the
same to you. Be safe, and take care my beautiful friends.

Love,

One comment here, nothing to do with tsheets particularly...there ought to
be an established term in rave culture for a rhythm based around a steady
bass drum (or synthesized drum sound, yes) at one kick per beat, and "4/4"
is not it.  "Four on the floor" is pretty good, and generally means what I
think a lot of people want to mean when they say 4/4.  4/4 means only that
there are four beats for each periodic section of the music, which goes for
almost every piece of contemporary dance music that I've ever heard.  The
most fucked-up funky jungle break you've ever heard probably still has a
four-part measure, even if it doesn't have exactly four even bass thumps.

>[...]
>Personally, I am desperately awaiting the Goa/Jungle fusion!

I think there is some music like this...not really goa-jungle, maybe, but
goa sound with more prominent, complex drum tracks, breakbeat style.  I've
never heard much of it, mostly just flashes in larger sets.  There was some
stuff like that, a bit slower than your average goa, sometimes an
almost...uh, illbient?, atmosphero-jungle? (whatever...I can't even pretend
to be familiar with all the nuances of genre labels in the synthetic music
realm--but that's good, you know, all the uncertainty and variety indicates
a flourishing synthetic scene; when there's a particular couple of labels
that each mean something everyone knows, that's a constricted musical
world) feel (wow, what a complicated sentence), going on downstairs at the
Goa Gil birthday affair in Berkeley...anyone know who was responsible for
that?  I'd love to hear more.  I love goa, but my favorite techno style has
always been hard breakbeat, which I don't hear nearly enough of these days
(around here...things may be better elsewhere).  A fusion would be
wonderful...

As long as we're on the topic of goa varieties, does anyone have any
suggestions for some seriously aggro goa?  Actually, I don't know quite
what to call the music I'm thinking of, but it's definitely a goa
sound...the best example I know of is whatever was played for CCC at
Burning Man (this year) just as the alien invader was being immolated.
Anyone know what that was?  Evil goa?  Acid-core?  Whatever it was, I
haven't been able to get much more...I have one tape (Thee-O) that was
described as "dark goa," but though I like it a lot, it's not quite what
I'm thinking of.  Theta Blip, Dutch also approach what I mean, but that's
not quite it.

Isn't there a Goa list?  I haven't looked, but anyone interested ought to
check Hyperreal (http://hyperreal.com).

I don't know if the kind I use are for swimmers, but I like silicone
plugs--they seem to have a flatter attenuation than the foam kinds, and
they're also usually not as strong.  But...they have one big problem: when
things get hot and humid and sweaty they don't adhere to my ear canals as
well as the foam kind.  Fine if you're using your plugs to inspect an
industrial worksite or somesuch, as I'm sure they were designed to do, but
problematic in a rave environment.  I still use them, but I try to bring
along a foam pair in case my jumping around happens to dislodge one of
those sweat-slick blobs...I find that the foam "Noise Husher" variety,
available in most drugstores, are excellent, although they really kill the
treble and they can make casual conversations difficult.

I suppose I should admit that I often give in around 4 am or so and ditch
the plugs...good hearing is wonderful, of course, in the long term, but I
just can't deny the joy of pure volume, RIGHT NOW.

I'd imagine that a goa/jungle fusion would be pure noise. Frenetic
breakbeat drums with complex layered synthesizers? It might be too
much...space and air are nice. The nice thing about goa is the simple
kick pattern that allows the music to breathe. Vice versa with jungle.

But(!) it might be neat to experiment with. Anyone out there in SFR-land
who's writing jungle? I'll make trance, you'll make jungle, together
we'll make noise.

	Now I have to take severe exception to all this.  I'm well used to
people dissing "Europop" (aka New Wave) groups like Duran Duran and the
Pet Shop Boys.  Putting down these type groups seems to be for the '90s
what "disco sucks" was for the '80s, which I heard constantly during
junior high school.
	However I think the criticism is misplaced.  If some of them wore
lipstick, is that a crime?  If I was of a John S. Lee mindset, I'd call
it homophobia. Is looking good (as opposed to making oneself ugly, which
punk made an art form of) something to criticize?  Isn't this the same as
all the dumb blonde jokes -- assume that if someone's a babe (guy or
girl), they must be an airhead?
	The same school of thought that says "real men/women like rock 'n
roll" by way of dissing pop, also generally puts modern techno and house
into the same category of lightweight music.  Just look through a rockers'
magazine like BAM and see how much credit they give to techno artists or
any form of dance music, from ambient to jungle.
	Before there was techno-house, there were groups like Tears For
Fears, Dead Of Alive, Cyndi Lauper, and all kinds of great artists that
everybody puts down because they sold a lot of records, were too
androgynous, had big hair, used other instruments besides the guitar, saw
the value of a catchy beat and hook in their songs, etc.  I'll bet many of
the people on this list enjoyed this music.  I still do, and I'm not
ashamed to say it.  New Order, Blondie, Style Council, General Public,
Alison Moyet, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones, they're all good.   
	But the best way to judge these pop artists is to let their lyrics
speak for themselves.  Tell me these words are shallow, tell me these
words are not poetry, or say nothing about life in the "real world":

"All day, hiding from the sun
 Waiting for the golden one
 Waiting for your fame
 After the parade had gone
 Outside was a happy place
 Every face had a smile like a golden face
 For a second
 Your look was white as your fingers curled
 The shot that was heard around the world, for a second
 It took seconds of your time to take his life
 It took seconds"
		-Human League, "Seconds" (a song about the killing of JFK)

"When your world is full of strange arrangements
 And gravity won't pull you through
 You know you're missing out on something
 Well that something depends on you
 All I'm saying, it takes a lot to love you
 All I'm doing, you know it's true
 All I mean now is one thing, this one thing
 That turns this gray sky to blue
 That's the look of love"
				-ABC, "The Look Of Love"	

"We're miles away from nowhere
 And the wind doesn't have a name
 So call it what you want to call it
 Still blows down the lane
 People tell me I haven't changed at all
 But I don't feel the same
 And I bet you've had that feeling too
 You just can't laugh all the time
 And if the fires burn out there's only fire to blame
 No time for worry cause we're on the roam again
 The clouds all scatter and we ride the outside lane
 Not on your own so help me please hold back the rain"
				-Duran Duran, "Hold Back The Rain"

	Yeah, the Smiths were great!  But I don't only like them because
their music had a little harder edge to it generally than the other bands
mentioned above.  Morrissey is simply a great poet, imho, and his singing
with Johnny Marr's composing made a terrific contrast.
	If you like the sentiments Morrissey expresses in "Panic," there's
another great song along similar lines called "I'd Rather Jack" by the
Reynolds Girls, which is more purely pop, and again imho, a no-apologies
string-em-up defense of the music, not to mention a fine dance track.
	
"All we wanna do is have a good time
 Then they went and took our house away
 No one ever asked for our opinion
 No, no we don't get a say
 AM, FM, all that jazz
 We'd rather sing along with Yazz 
 What happened to the radio?
 They never play the songs we know!
 Golden oldies, Rolling Stones, we don't want 'em back
 I'd rather jack than Fleetwood Mac
 I'd rather jack!
 No heavy metal rock-and-roll music from the past
 I'd rather jack, than Fleetwood Mac
 I'd rather jack! 
 Can't they see that every generation
 Has music for its own identity?
 Why the DJ on the radio station is always more than twice the age of me?
 Who needs Pink Floyd, Dire Straits?
 That old music's out of date
 Demograpic stereo,
 They never play the songs we know..." (etc.)

	Now personally, I like Pink Floyd and Dire Straits too, so please
don't jump all over me about that!  I didn't write the lyrics, I just
thing they sound good.
	I just couldn't let somebody get away with saying '80s music is
shallow.  The '80s get dissed way too much as a decade already.  I'm not
buying into all that media crap about the "decade of greed."  That came
out of the frustration the left felt at having 12 years of Republican
Presidents Reagan and Bush, not out of any solid statistics about people
being greedier or anything.
	But I digress.  The point I basically wanted to make is not only
did the artists have style, but their music had substance as well.

Much love,

I never thought I would respond to a completely asenine post like this.

Niels, you are way out of line...and I have no problem telling the other
500 people on this list, plus the 600 others on socal and SD, that you
are a complete idiotic jerk!! And they will believe me. So retreat while
your ass still looks better than your face, okay!?!?!?

Same goes for you, JSL!!!!

You guys have some vendetta out for somebody but it's none of us and
certainly no one on this list!!! 

Some of us may have our head in the clouds, and maybe in the sand, but
it's sure the hell better that having it up our own ass!!!!

Everything the two of you have said has given me diarrhea for the last
year or so, Knock this shit off and be cool!!! You have a right to be on
list, you have a right to have an opinion, you have a right to voice
that opinion, but you have NO right to *SLANDER*!!!! those on the list
who have done nothing but give selflessly to others, on and off the
list.

I know what has been going on, publicly and privately, so don't even go
there!!!

A word of advice, and I know the both of you BETTER THAN YOU THINK....
Go to a party and meet some new faces, we're not the close minded,
racist gangsters that you think!!!! We are not some crazy ass religion!!

You guys conjour up these insane ideas in your twisted minds!!!!

ToonTown may be dead but........

         the scene is alive more that you know!!!!!

Um terry, YOUR way out of line! Admit it, we have been discovered. Sfraves is
head of a new "gang" that is sweeping the underground all over the nation and
MAtt, Leslie(the so-called rave-mother) Mike, and Mr. Clay, are all
ringleaders in this ferocious gang. They cirlce-dance, wear Fila, rudely, and
crudely hit on innocent little candy ravers, they throw parties, and charge 5
dollars for tap water and 50 bucks just to get in all the time they get some
actor to prtend to spin while they play mixtapes... SHEESH consider them
armed and dangerous!!!

Jonathan

First time I got this, I saved it (that was yesterday morning) and I was
considering going to it, but this is the 3rd exactly the same post.   I am
starting to think about skipping it...

Is it really necessary to remind us of something twice a day?????

Waiting for the explanation,

 I've never used a "kill" file or filtering yet, because I've yet to
find a person I've gotten email from via SFraves that consistently
pisses me off with every post. Even the worst ones < and my list of those
folks will remain private for now > post something cool every once and awhile.
And my 'd'elete finger isn't sore yet...( I am using it more , tho ).

PS - I wonder what would happen if you did use "*@*.com" in a mail filter?
 Probably end up with a lot of sophomoric stuff from *.edu sites... < duck! >

The only plugs I'll use are the North Sonic-II earplugs. They are available at any good 
music store. They run about $15 (worth it) and they have metal filter elements in a 
soft rubber fitting. The elements are removable for cleaning of the fitting, which 
inserts in your ear. Their basic function is to rollof the mid-highs and highs, such 
that you can still hear, but not at dangerous levels. Check 'em out if you are looking 
for a single pair to last a lifetime (or until u lose 'em). ;) What's really nice about 
these is that you can actually make out conversation better with them in (I guess that 
voice is more low-mid and doesn't get filtered as much by the plugs). I've also never 
experienced any difficulties with them jumping out of my ears! :D

With all this talk about Goa, I feel compelled to mention the Dragonfly 
label. If you're not familiar w/ the Order Odonata CD's, get familiar w/ 
them. Particularly the Experiments that Identify Change ('96, white 
cover). The newest one, Technical Use of Sound in Magik, is pretty bomb 
too.

Of course, there are a lot of other cool labels out there too (Blue Room, 
TIP Records, etc). Get yer butts out to Frequency 8 (this is not an 
ad) for some good recommendations.

Hm, it really depends on the angle you are going to take.  Formalizing and
quantifying the "rave experience" will probably produce something on the
order of PLUR -- which, besides being way, way off the mark, would
probably *not* be good thesis material ;)

However, recently on PBS there was a multipart documentary on several
different kinds of music and their associated cultures.  Each part
consisted of a two hour segmented cusing on a particular genre.  I was
only able to see the piece that traced the origins of rap and dance music,
and it was *excellent*.

Unfortunately, I don't remember the name -- has anyone else seen it?  It
was incredibly thorough, well thought-out, obviously well researched, and
included interviews with people like Derrick May an De La Soul.

Noah, if you're serious about pursuing this, I would highly recommend this
documentary as a starting point.

A friend of mine said that he djs by the name of Neil and is

spining from vinyl, cds, and dat too! Unfortunately, I haven't

SBL will be happening *again*.

When: 	Thursday - noon

Where: 	Queen House (Chinese noodle soup etc.)
	Castro - downtown Mt. View
	between Villa and the next street closer to El Camino
	if you are facing El Camino, it will be on your left and it is a
small
	place, in the middle of the block, so pay close attention


This is my fav noodle place - it's cheap ($4.00 for a huge soup), great
food, and what else do you need :P.

Please let me know if you are planning to come, so I can go earlier and get
us a table (or try to call in, although I am not sure if they take
reservations).

Phone - 415-691-6645

        Maybe. Seems most likely.

        But possibly ...

        MTV videos go from 3 minutes to 9-12 hours in length. From
sundown to sunrise MTV plays *one* video that consisits entirely of
a single mix. The visuals are usually limited to kaleidoscopic 
patterns, fractals, other abstract psychedelia.

That's good to hear. Welcome to my kill-file, sucka! Any more? Sign up now!

Also, I never ever ever posted anything to the "socal" or "SD" rave
lists. Perhaps i need to start copyrighting my messages as both my

Recently, matter <arduous@mcs.netmentioned a good pai of earplugs:

 I've owned a pair for over 15 years, and the rubber fittings are still
soft and resiliant. I do keep them in their container.

 They also do a good job of evenly rolling off the bass too - very 
musical compared to other foam and silicone earplugs available to the 
general public.

 However - sometimes the sound at amplified music events has too much 
mid-highs and highs than would be musical anyway! I think this is due to
a combination of hi-frequency deafness in the over-stressed ears of the
soundman, and distortion caused by redlining the volume. In those cases,
the foam earplugs give a better spectral low-mid-high balance than the
high quality Sonic II plugs.

 I was able to test this out last Thursday at ASCENDENCE. I tried both my
Sonic II earplugs and my favorite dayglo orange fish-shaped foam earplugs 
that I bought in the gunnery section of my local sporting goods store.
Both seemed to affect bass evenly, but the Sonic II plugs gave a more
even , "musical" reduction in mid and high freq sounds. However, if 
I wanted to concentrate on midrange stuff , I did better with the foam
fishes in my ears.  But, of the two, I detect more distortion from the 
foam earplugs than the Sonic II plugs .

 I can verify that by my experience at ASCENDENCE too. Better voice
comprehension may also be caused by the higher fidelity of the Sonic II 
plugs.

 Gotta get them in good tho' - they can back their way out if you put 
them in casually. That rubber's wiggly. On the other hand, if you're
speaker tweeking, it'll be VERY OBVIOUS that you've lost one!

I want to second Nancy's comments.  Hype! was great because it brought
back some of my own history.  In the mid-1980s I was involved somewhat
in what, for lack of a better term, I would call the "alternative"
scene in Portland.  We really did't have a name for it.  It had two
main genres, punk/hardcore and, for lack of a better term, "underground
pop."  The Wipers were the foundation of the first -- the real progenitors
of the grunge sound, but I was more in the second, with bands like the
Dharma Bums here in Portland through whom I met the Young Fresh Fellows,
Conrad Uno and so forth.  It's their sensibility that informs the
viewpoint of the movie.  As Kurt of the Fellows and Fastbacks says in
the movie, "Yeah, every so often we wake up and find out Seattle got
famous and we missed out."  

But the grunge sound and sensibility tapped into a much wider interest
or need of a mass audience than the smart (and smart-aleck) rock
sensibility of bands like the Fellows.  I remember one year at Bumbershoot,
the huge Labor Day music and arts festival at the Seattle Center, my
old housemate Mike (who was tight with the whole Bums/YFF/Replacements
crew) and I went with the gang to see NRBQ play outside in front of the
Space Needle.  There we all were -- Scott McCaughey, Joey Kline, Mike,
me, a bunch of others, right up at the stage jumping up and down with
the Q and having a great time.  Then we went inside of one of the halls
and watched a much larger crowd absolutely surging back and forth to
the new crop of grunge bands (I believe Alice in Chains was the main
attraction, unknown except in Seattle at that point).  

This is, in essence, what happened to "rave" in Europe already.  It
started as a small, dispersed, underground network of musicians and
other participants playing utterly obscure, cutting-edge records in
out of the way places because there was no acceptance of the sounds
in any of the standard venues.  

But soon events grew to the thousands and have now been held in arenas,
stadiums and old airports, to name a few of the largest locations.  
In 1992, when 177 Townsend and the Galleria were probably the largest
venues going in the SF scene (and those were infrequent), Universe was
holding outdoor events in the UK for 25,000 people.

I've often felt we have been doubly blessed in the SF scene by having
things be relatively small but benefitting from the music coming out
of Europe.  Now things are starting to catch up.  Cool World and Autechre
and the Chems on MTV are only the leading edge.  We have a new generation
for whom the idea of turntables in a bar, a warehouse or a stadium is
the most natural thing to imagine.  But the music they are inclined to
hear -- sorry, but I'm going to express an opinion here I know is not
fully shared -- is the grunge of the late 1990s, epitomized in my view
by the slow, grinding sound of the Chemical Brothers and the crossover
sounds summarized by the term "funky breaks."  Which, in my own view,
have as much to do with house, acid house and techno as Alice in Chains
does with the Young Fresh Fellows.

There will still be a dance music underground, as there is still a
guitar-alternative-band underground.  But facts are facts: no longer does
this represent the cutting edge that it once did.  The juice, the momentum,
is swinging toward the mass audience.  It won't be the same as the overnight
sensation of grunge.  This will have its own history too, and it's hard to
predict where it's heading.  But just pick up a recent issue of Mixmag,
DJ or Muzik to see some clues ...

I predict more dope UG's with a killer vibe and a beautiful crowd

witness 'em, andrew, because there's still people out here who care. =)) (I
think the response to lepidoptera and wrinkle and the *anticipated*

--	I saw the coolest thing this past summer.  I was at the Zurich 
Energy Parade (excellent vibe, BTW), and some people were handing out 
free foam ear plugs to the crowd.  I thought it was the most superb product 
promo.  It was warranted, because these European-techno-float-parade 
things pump out a lot of decibels.
	Maybe the SF party organizers can incorporate that into their 
future offerings.  Since there are free fruits, candy, and stuff, why not 
have a bowl of cotton balls marked as "ear-protection" or sumfin?  
	At a massive after the parade, I ran into a stand that gave out 
free ecstasy information flyers.  It was non-biased, had the _correct_ info 
concerning physiological effects (or the basics of it anyways), proper 
care during and after ingestion (drink liquids, milk, etc.), what to do 
in an emergency, overdose symptoms, how to behave around cops, and lots 
more.  It wasn't extravagantly published (printed both sides on one 3" x 5" 
flyer), but best of all, it didn't preach, but advocated self-control and 
common sense (I thought the max of one pill a week was rather high, but 
then again, I know someone who takes six pills a time  X-P~~ ).  I 
thought it was a good idea, since not everybody has access to this type 
of information (I was lucky I had very knowledgable and caring friends, 
however, not all newbies are so privileged).  Shouldn't our rave 
community have some responsibility to help its members in certain ways as 
well?

private party (I say "I", but really, myself and two others were the main
organizers, and a whole bunch of people helped pull it together...), but
rather to educate some misguided people.

I'm sorry that you have to read/hear this, if you have no idea what party
I'm talking about.  I know most people on this list are cool, but if we, as
an online group can convey a message to the ravers at large, then I use
this forum to do so...

I believe that to truly learn, you must choose mentors, friends and
coworkers who will offer you insight, knowledge and time in the areas you
are passionate about.  In the past couple years I have been fortunately
enough to become part of some of the finest production groups in the Bay
Area Underground Rave Scene (BAURS).  I have learned a lot from these
people, who include members of Friends and Family, Cloud Factory, Harmony,
Syntonic, and a host of others.  I have worked just about every kind of
shift you can think of.  I did it willingly, so as to learn, and give to
those people I feel honored to be around.  Honor is a funny thing...it can
really motivate you if you let it.

I believe that to truly teach, you must lead by example.  You also must be
open, and tolerant and brave.  You must be able to accept your mistakes and
take responsibility for them, teaching yourself and anyone around you the
lessons to be learned.

I got a call from a friend about a space he is moving his company into, and
he explained that I could throw a party there, but it had to happen fast,
and there couldn't be too many people.  I decided, with the direct
assistance of two friends, and the indirect assistance from members of
Cloud Factory, FnF, and Syntonic, to throw a word of mouth party, limiting
attendance to those people myself and the two friends know.  That's the
bottom line.  The party originally had no name, but eventually got dubbed
WOMO (word of mouth only).  =)

I threw this party for myself, and my friends.  I threw this party to show
people what I have learned under their tutelage.  I threw this party to
give back to my friends, my mentors, essentially...my rave family.  It was,
for me, a final exam.  And I'm so fucking proud to say...I passed.  The
party rocked!  It wasn't flawless, but it was pretty damn close, and for
that, I have a million thanks to spread to all the people that helped.

I didn't throw this party for the whole underground scene, just a piece of
it.  I didn't throw this party for SFR and all it's members.  I didn't
throw this party so someone at another party could dish surplus people off
on me, right at the peak of the night, so their party could continue.

With that said, if you didn't get invited, well, there's always next time.
I refuse to apologize for that.  It didn't matter if you know every member
of FnF, this was not an FnF party, it was WOMO, it was me and my friends,
and no one has the right to say word one about getting in, or not getting
in.  If that sounds selfish, then so be it.  I have the right to throw a
party and invite anyone I want...

As do you.  If you felt slighted by not getting in, then throw a party of
your own, invite who ever you want.  If I don't get in, I'll live with
that.  I'm rather perturbed at the ruthless nature of people at the door.
The excuses and lies to get through the door.  The complete lack of respect
for the door people.  I live by a few simple rave rules:

1) Always bring your sunglasses, no matter how long you PLAN to stay.  =)

2) Respect the door, the space and the people

3) If possible, thank the organizers for their hard work

4) Don't dance too hard, too close to the decks

5) If you have energy, offer to help clean-up

Anyway, until you experience it for yourself, you can never understand how
hard it can be working the door.  On one hand, you'd love to let everyone
in, on the other, you have to limit the crowd to the space, the
temperature, the toilets, and the attitude.  And it's all on your
shoulders.  I wish you all luck in going out and discovering places to
throw parties and pulling them off.  It can be very rewarding.  Even when
people disrespect you and your space.

The BAURS will survive.  I can't believe the energy, talent and enthusiasm
of the people around here.  It is what we make it, and in my eyes, it will
be alive and well in 1997.  Even if SFR dwindles to a few bickering
people...

Thanks for your attention,

Tony

Well, it's all about the drugs right?

Offer slots to upcoming DJs, make them work to find the right music...

     you know i was watching somehtin on a&e yesterday hosted by mr spock 
     about the history of substance usage.  it was pretty cool.  they 
     traced usage from "soma" used by the aryans through the greeks, romans 
     and even jesus of nazareth (darn druggie, i always knew :) ) and the 
     rituals still used today with SP cactus.  at the end, some lady said 
     the biggest problem with today's drug scene is "there's no rituals 
     involved.  it's just recreational use..."  i've never heard someone 
     explain what the problem is with the whole drug thing in such a way 
     that i think even closed-minded people might be able to relate to.

 Well, at first I thought the "free book to a child with every 25 emailings"
was suspiciously like an urban legend/hoax, but it seems to be on the level.
You can get the details at the Houghton-Mifflin web site:

http://www.polarexpress.com    

and

http://www.polarexpress.com/96screens/HTML/aboutsts.html#2

 It's "Polar Express" because that's the book that's going to be donated
( that or some other book by the same author ). The campaign is called
"The Polar Express Share The Spirit Campaign" .

 As with all emailings sent around the Internet via "word of mouth", many
"fine print" details are missing from the message that has reached us
here at SFRaves. Check out the web site for full details,then email
is it feels right to you. I'm still thinking about it.

 Let me propose the following - 

1. Those who go to underground raves in our area ( ie not flyered or posted
  on SFRaves ), please review them on SFRaves. Please include "how-to"
  details as well as the usual "the vibe was HUGE!!!/no vibe AT ALL!!!" 
  comments.

   I think this would be of special benefit to everyone, and may encourage 
  folks here on SFRaves to hold their own! Also to get away from the
  "I paid my ticket, now show me a good time" concert mentality.

2. We others on SFRaves who weren't in on the "special elite super secret
  attendee list" solemnly PROMISE PROMISE PROMISE not to bug the poster
  of the review with whiny requests for invitations to the "next one". 

   Given that a lot of the folks in SFRaves use SFRaves to learn about 
  raves, not how to do one, this may be an impossible request. Maybe
  a special "anonymizer" email address that would strip off the sender's
  email address befroe sending off to SFRaves?

 What do you folks think?

Hello SFRaver people....

I wanted to extend a thank you for the responses of my inquiry... I
received a Mixture of old and new DJ's and all are welcome...  Right now
it seems I'll be producing a few mixtapes for an exchange program for
the dozen of you that replied.... 

So here's the REAL REASON for the info...   Im looking to throw a
(series??) of beach parties in the spring of 97'  I think it's about
time for me to progress past the house party scene to which I've been
catering for the past two years...  Im looking for a theme for these
parties to be a mixture of Trance, Drum and bass, and hardcore /
experimental / gabber:   The new underground.  I think I'll most likely
not make a cent off these ventures, but hey, you can't put a price on
LOVE, right???  So in January I'll begin begging for volunteers and
looking for decent equip. rental places...  Again, I think that the new
breed of DJ's will show all the scensters that the underground is quite
alive...

I will be hanging out with some old friends in Frankfurt soon, But they don't
do the nocturnal nightlife like I do. Does anybody have any recommendations
as to good clubs and DJ's to check out? Any genre of techno/house/etc... is
good to me, I like it all.

hello everyone, just thought i'd send a plea for help ...
chicago is desperately in need of a trance scene, and i thought that sf
would be just the place to turn to... is it possible to import good vibes
and great music to a place that hails harsh attitude and deep house as the
great gods of raving??? i thought LA was style-conscious, but this is out
of control...
anyhow, for all the nastiness there may be in the sf scene, look at what
you have and give it lots of love, and give yourselves lots of credit,
because it fully beats what's going on here. 
happy winter and all the fun things that go along with it!!!
stay warm!!! (i'm trying)
joy and peace to all; CAN"T WAIT TO SEE EVERYONE!!!
love and smiles,
allegra :)

stuttering deleted...

I am not so sure this is true...what do you consider a ritual.  Lots of
people here on this list get all dressed up, go to a rave, meet new and
see old people...is this a ritual?  Obviously this isn't like Indian
other cultural rituals but it is today's ritual for many ravers.

i must absolutely concur. getting hit by a bunch of RUDE, SNIVELLING,
ATTITUDE INFESTED
NON-RAVERS at 2 in the morning was a real jolt.

and get this...at about 4am one of those ungrateful bastards had the
unmitigated gall
to complain to me that the line for the bathroom was"SOOOOO LONG"!

an open word to thomas trouble

you are responsible for the people you solicit for your parties. the
indignant pigs that showed up at my PRIVATE, UNFLIERED party waving their
tickets to your party and saying we OWED them entry
are proof that once you bow to the all-mighty buck you'll pimp yourself out
to anyone...
it may not have been YOU, but it was probably one of your patrons, and a
man's reputation is
usually reflected is his associates...

and i'll say this. this scene is going back underground just because of
this shit.
i don't do flyer drop parties because the potential grabber of that flyer
these days is
not consistently trustworthy any more. after every big rave there's always
the usual banter about
posers and circle jerkers and attitude flashers and thieves.

HELLO!

THESE PEOPLE AIN'T RAVERS!

THESE AIN'T RAVES!

this is why i run with friends and family. this is why we suffer the slings
and arrows or our peers,
to keep raves enlightening and meaningful.

this is also why people influential to our community seek us out!
i have never had such a great honor in my life as when dennis p. and his
band of raving revelers
from the CBC showed up sat. nite.

this is why our alters are more than candy tables.
this is why i push a cart with 25 cases of water around the most crowded
costco in the world
on sat afternoon, and give it away on the dance floor at 3am
 this is why i can make 3 phone calls and get big sound for many rooms
FREE! and jk's finest to
run it!

these parties we do, to the disgust of the folks stuck in line behind Home
Base, will continue.
they will continue to be the crucibles in which people with vision can
visualize the harmony
that will be crucial to our advancement as a community.
they will continue to seem elitist, because they , like adulthood,drugs,
sex, they demand the
responsibility on the part of the participants. if it means a secret code
to separate the riff raff
out so we can get on with the transformation, then so be it.

peace and positivity,
greg
P.S. neils- did it occur to that the only victim of your censorship is
yourself?
add me to your list if you wish...

     yes, you see i am actually on your side, maybe i didn't make it fully 
     clear.  this would be perhaps the difference between having a glass of 
     wine at dinner as a social function (which i suppose we could call a 
     ritual) and getting sloshy drunk.  yes, maybe some people consider 
     getting sloshy drunk a ritual, but...
     
     how about this?  when there's no personal or spiritual growth 
     involved.   it's hard to pin this one down.
     
     but a lot of people just do drugs to escape the physical world.  
     they're meant, i think as a stepping stone.  but when we get down to 
     it, we really don't need drugs to step into the other realities, they 
     can be gotten by meditation and such.  
     
     i don't think there's any clear definition, though we could probably 
     start a whole ong string on that, which im sure has been done before.  
     i suspect a large portion of you already know what i mean.

I think that's one aspect of raves that appeals to me: the return of 
family, ritual, tradition.

        Ritual won't protect anybody from their own drugs. 

	Drugs can occasionally be helpful for personal development
	for certain people, but mostly they're a trap. I'll bet
	everyone on this list knows at least one casualty.

	If you've lost faith that the walls of ego can be broken down
	at all, then *maybe* something like E or acid can help you.

        If you already know that the walls come down when you take E or
        acid - but you think that's the *only* or the *best* way to do
	it, then you're probably already caught and don't even know it.

     well, that's true too...
     
     meditation is the better route, because you have to really focus and 
     work hard to get there.  
     
     they (drugs) do lift us up, but only to a limit, and then they limit 
     us because it takes a while for the chemicals to leave our system.  
     then were tired or cant sleep.  
     
     obviously these substances wouldn't be here if we werent meant to use 
     them if we want.  but someday hopefully we will be able to move on 
     once enough people are enlightened.

yeah, i suppose. but i'm pretty frustrated...my love for this forum and its participants eclipses
the negativity i'm feeling right now. 


 As you can see, this post is directed to only yourself, since I try TRY to keep the scene in

i'm going to respond to this on the list because i feel everyone
on the list should read my next words. hope that's o.k.

 my point here was not to dis' thomas trouble. but i was working the door at my party when a
surly "vato" type arrived and told me i should let him in. i happen to see that thomas trouble evidently
espouses many of the same traits for his parties as we do-low cost,etc... i respect that.
i just wish to point out some of the behavior that we all suffer from. this just happened to be the
incident that i experienced. it's the kind if thing we all need to avoid...

 If this event was a word of mouth, then SOMEONE mouthed off and

  And if there is a beef

god no, i don't even know the dude, but i said it before, we're all responsible for the crowds

And there's nothing better than a crowd of people in baggy pants
clawing at a warehouse door to attract Officer Bob... That sucked. I'm
honestly surprised that the party wasn't busted. There was, after all,
a police car hanging out on 6th and Mission when I showed up.

Terrible. Go in or go home.

Remind me never to throw a private party at my apartment...Who knows
what random ravers might show up, waving the tickets of a busted
party. ;)

Good point!  But I think that problems can arise in ritual as well.  Ritual
can become monotonous and eventually lose its meaning.

Having a reason, a search, a question to be answered, a vision quest, in
other words needing to break free of pressing constraints of ones reality
to see or perceive something new, is in my opinion, the only reason to
partake of a substance, in any form, that will alter my reality.

But if one sees life as an illusion then this reality doesn't seem so
restricting and being able to make new perceptions comes quite easily.  So
then is the substance really necessary since reality can be altered so
easily within?

     true.  we really don't need them to travel to those distant places.  
     but it makes sense that people would have done them all throughout 
     history, because we were not aware.  wait, maybe not true.  well, 
     societies are full of unaware masses that think they need these to 
     cling on to because it 'relaxes' them.  
     
     i mean unless we are the Q and can already do everything and know 
     everything, we are going to evolve.  and even as a Q, they don't know 
     some things, like what it's like to be mortal...

But if one sees life as an illusion then this reality doesn't seem so 
restricting and being able to make new perceptions comes quite easily.  So 
then is the substance really necessary since reality can be altered so 
easily within?

And that's the point that I was trying to make about people being able to
miss a party...I kept telling people that by them being in the street, our
party would get busted too...

Here's how it went down with the cop.  As he approached about 30 people
scattered to a distance of about 25 yards on either side and watched like a
rumble was about to being.  Our story was straight...we were having a
private party celebrating the moving in of a software company (actually,
multimedia), and it was a free party, by invitation only.  Officer Tim
waved me out, I approached confidently.  He asked what was going on.  I
said, "We are having a moving in party for my friend's software company."
"These people," pointing left and right, "don't look like software types."
I smile.  "You're right.  A party was busted down the street, and they came
here thinking it was an open party.  It's not."  "I see.  What's the
address here?"  "xxxx Mission Street."  "Okay..."  "Thank you, my name's
Tony."  "My name's Tim."  Shake hands, Tim goes to his squad car, I shut
the door tight.  Within 5 seconds, people are again rushing the door....

Crazy!  He was soooo cool, I thought we were going to have the swat teams
on us in minutes.  Never saw another cop.  Maybe they were busy down the
street?  =)

Does anyone want to go to Kirkwood this weekend???  I really want to go,

Please pass this on to people you know.  The poor woman!
     
This is a true story that was forwarded to me.  Read it and learn.  Bake 
the cookies and enjoy them and then forward this to all you know!
     
My daughter & I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas
& decided to have a small dessert.  It was so excellent that I asked if
they 
would give me the recipe and the would you let me buy the recipe?
With a cute smile, she said, "Yes."  I asked how
much, and she responded, "Only two fifty, it's a great deal!"  I said 
with approval, just add it to my tab.  Thirty days later, I received my 
VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00.  I looked again and

I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a

scarf.  As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, "Cookie 
Recipe - $250.00."  That's outrageous!!  I called Neiman's Accounting 
Dept. and told them the waitress said it was "two-fifty," which clearly 
does not mean "two hundred and fifty dollars" by any *POSSIBLE* 
interpretation of the phrase.  Nieman-Marcus refused to budge.  They 
would not refund my money, because according to them, "What the waitress 
told you is not our problem.  You have already seen the recipe - we 
absolutely will not refund your money at this point."  I explained to her

the criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas, I threatened to refer 
them to the Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney General for 
engaging in fraud.  I was basically told, "Do what you want, we don't 
give a crap, and we're not refunding your money."  I waited, thinking of 
how I could get even, or even try and get any of my money back.  I just 
said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have $250.00 
worth of fun."  I told her that I was going to see to it that every 
cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 
cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for free.  She replied, "I wish you 
wouldn't do this." I said, "Well, you should have thought of that before 
you ripped me off, and slammed down the phone on her.
     
So, here it is!!!  Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you can 
possibly think of.  I paid $250 dollars for this...
     
I don't want Nieman-Marcus to *ever* get another penny off of this 
recipe....
     
     
   (Recipe may be halved.):
     
     
     2  cups butter
     4  cups flour
     2  tsp. soda
     2  cups sugar
     5  cups blended oatmeal**
     24 oz. chocolate chips
     2  cups brown sugar
    1  tsp. salt
     1  8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)
     4  eggs
    2  tsp. baking powder
    3  cups chopped nuts (your choice)
     2  tsp. vanilla
     ** Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.  Cream
the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with 
flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda.  Add chocolate chips, 
Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a 
cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.
     
     
Have fun!!!  This is *not* a joke --- this is a true story..

	This is something I have been kind of struggling with. What 
exactly are each of us going to call the underground? It is a select 
crowd of people we know that come out to parties and act the same, go to 
all the same parties? Or it something little more open than that? If it 
is something that is a little more open, how do you filter out the 
trendies who go around demanding to smear glitter all over you? How can 
something be open so it does not get stale without getting bogged down in 
attitude or people who are going to request some nice goa (sorry if that 
offends someone, it is not meant to, just it is what is liked by a lot 
now, so I am using it as an example) when I play gabber ;) How do we 
expect to "evolve", as I have heard just about every group that has a 
name out say they are trying to do, with stagnation?
	Why don't small parties even consider trying something new, and 
saying so - We are going to try something new and drop the price to just 
cover our costs with the additional influx of people, (or donate the 
extra money to the same or additional charities it has always been going 
to).
	My last observation is about individual responsibility. We work 
to put on parties and one of the things I would like to see come out of 
that is having people learn how to handle themselves a little better. 
This is one of the reasons I like bringing people out into the middle of 
no where, it is one of the reasons I like Burning Man so much, and it the 
biggest stumbling block I see for opening parties up to more people - the 
party will get busted because dumb shits sit outside the party with their 
car stereo blasting, or walking across 1 in bright reflective gear after 
parking in a visible location, or just plain looking like they are going 
to a rave by walking down the street with 10 billion stuffed animals, all 
glittered up and being loud and loud outside is gonna get you busted 
inside right? enough sermoning.... take what you will, I don't know how 
to say this in any other way than I just have...

OK I'm back - after hitting the wrong key and sending my message prematurely
(this has happened to me so many times now it's driving me crazy!!)
Anyway, this is an emotional situation and I do not want to discuss the
details online. If anyone needs to they can telephone me on 415 552 6507.
Mantra will NOT be resurrected but a new trance event (with a slightly
different theme and different people involved) will appear in the New Year.
Keep your eyes peeled.
In the meantime we at Space Station Russ St, Hunab Ku, CCC (and anyone else
who is interested) will be collectively throwing a beautiful full-on trance
party on New Years Eve. Looks like we'll have an amazing new space, we're all
meeting this week to sort out the details. Contact me if you're interested.
CCC will not have a party on the 13th, we may still on the Solstice (21st
Dec) it hasn't yet been decided.
Love and light

I wonder what would happen if we eliminated PLUR, love, and fuck from 
 our vocabulary?  Would we learn how to communicate better?  Would we want to?

I have a ten year-old son, Nicholas, who's quite intelligent (IMBO).  
 Whenever we go to 80 Acres (some land a friend of ours has), we tell 
 the kids they could cuss as much as they want to.  They speak foul, 
 unspeakable combinations that are often funny but it would often last 
 for about five to ten minutes and then they'd go back to being their 
 wonderful selves.  Nowadays, I tell him he can only use words 
 (including profanity) if he understands their definitions and usage.  
 Sometimes he tells me funny jokes that use profanities but overall, he 
 doesn't swear.  I wonder if we, as grown-ups, can do the same?  
 Finding clarity in describing what's ganking us can be difficult but 
 it could also avoid alot of flame wars, too.  Lord knows how many 
 posts I delete just to get some pertinent info on this list!

So, remember:  children can be great teachers.  Think of an infant who 
 knows and asks exactly what s/he needs--s/he cries when he's hungry, 
 wet, or tired.  And we provide... (Note the difference between needs 
 and wants!)

So I'm asking each of you to try and simplify the verbosity and 
 aggressiveness on the list by checking our attitudes at the door while 
 getting back down to the basics that brought us together:  music and dance.

Nah, it doesn't have to be pretty, well versed, or spelt correctly!  We 
 all have our special way of expressing ourselves and our humble 
 opinions.   But to tell someone to fuck off, etc. is showing something 
 that should be taken off the group list and into a personal 
 communication.  So show the entire list some respect and take it off 
 the group list.  We know you're intelligent and better than the 
 average bear, so show it!

Breathe deep and let's get real!  (Personal flames can be received at 
 tabellij@adoc.xerox.com and then there's always the delete key!)

See ya on the dance floor!
Diane

So,
	I was at Mantra on Friday ight and I met a really cool girl named
Sara.  Unfortunately someone stole my bag that night and took my money
stash (never fear I only had two bucks) but when they took it they took
the little piece of paper with her number on it.  I got my bag back, sin a
couple of things I have learned to let go of, but the number is pretty
much lost to me, unless, Sara, you are out there in sfraves land.  If you
are, then please e-mail me back, and... we'll go from there.

Dear Sir Niels,

  Well it's nice to see that you exercise your close-mindedness in your
email correspondence as well as your posts.  I wish you luck in continuing
your list and hope that one day you'll only get mail from people you feel
are qualified to talk to such a high and mighty person as yourself.

forgive me, your excellency, if my message took too much of your precious
time to read.  And if I'm not already on your list please feel free to put
me at the top.

yours truly,
Jayson

   Gulp!.... ahhhhhh..... imaginary sedative taken...
   
   So when I was starting on the internet, I was told, imagine you're in person 
   with the person you're writing to.
   
   So I guess kill files are like putting your hands over your ears and 
   screaming "I can't hear you".  Well, at least nobody's bragging about or 
   publishing who they've cut off... oh wait...
   
   I suppose I can understand... I want to be able to post to 500 people, but I 
   don't want to have to listen to them in return.
   
   Kill files were set up as an Anti-Spam measure.  Don't associate yourself 
   with SPAM production and distribution and I guess you don't belong on one.  
   Not everybody likes "Hi, it's a great day HUG" messages (that's the only 
   common thread I could think of among those people who appeared on the 
   published Kill List).  I myself personally sometimes very much appreciate 
   them and sometimes just ignore them.
   
   Anyway, at the risk of ending up on a dreaded Kill List myself, that was 
   pretty cruel.  Whether you read their posts or not, we all got that message.
   
   As for the responses, well... group unity is a weird thing.  Whenever you 
   have three or more people, shit like this is eventually going to happen.  I'd 
   hate to hear that somebody is going to kick some ass or some other crap.  
   Suffice to say that there is one benefit of Neils' Kill File list... those on 
   it can now freely spout evil devious shit about him without his knowledge.
   
   It's not about PLUR, or even raving.  It happens everyday on the net.  Don't 
   make a big deal out of it... it's just one person on a mail list being 
   inconsiderate (as in "I don't even consider reading mail from you and you and 
   you and you"), that's all.
   
   It leaves us open to a better understanding of tolerance of interests.... 
   Neils' well informed political commentary and Matt's super warm bear hug 
   posts are probably both relevant to a group of us, and probably equally rave 
   related.  Do we bash both or tolerate both?  I choose tolerance...
   
   Peace,
   AndyW
   
   Oh... and Neils... HUG!!!  ;)

You know, up here in Portland we're used to the rain, though it's a bit
much this year with almost 55 inches of the stuff so far (compared to our
normal 38) even for us.

But I have observed that rain makes Californians crazy, or at least it's
the only explanation I can come up with for what's happened on sfraves
since Thanksgiving time.  Old friends of mine are yelling at each other
online and it don't make no sense.  People are expressing opinions on the
list that may or may not be thought-out or based on reality, but then
others jump in with flamethrowers on full without considering the dynamic
this sets up.

I'm no longer one to preach, but let me quote one of my current favorite
records, one that Allen Ameba played about a month ago at 1015.  As a
non-believer in the organized-church sense, I think it still stands as a
startling reminder of how amazing life is and how easy it is to lose that,
in the rain or otherwise:

  Not to condemn you
  Not to put you down
  To raise you up
  Elevate your sights
  To let you know
  That there's something MORE out there
  That God wants you to HAVE.

It's the season for honoring our earth and ourselves, whether you are
a fan of Christmas, Hanukkah, the Solstice or None of the Above.

peace out
phred

I was wondering what your definition of ganking is...And where you have

all right kids - KNOCK IT OFF!!  if i see ONE more person wasting
bandwidth by complaining about/insulting someone who's wasting bandwidth
with non-rave or TOO-rave-related stuff, i'll have to get nasty!  :)

Being a member of a community means dealing in a responsible, reasonable
fashion with the downside of the community.  Cursing and swearing and
personally jabbing at people is hardly constructive.  If you must do this,
take it off the list where it belongs.

The way i see it (and i've said this before) these mailing lists were
created to be used by the rave scene about the rave scene.  I have no
problem with NRR posts, as they're being posted by people who do have
something in common with me and are part of the scene, therefore they have
a right to post anything they want.  By that argument also i shouldn't
really bitch about all the annoying arguments and flames either, but to
me, these are less necessary and nowhere near as interesting.  :)

my only $.02 about the issue is ... if you're responding to a post ...
DON'T include the whole damn message in your response with only a "yeah,
right on" at the very end.  THAT is truly annoying.

it's unfortunate that while we flee an evil, we bring it with us ... so
much for unity :P

I guess the question I was asking myself, is why would any of the people

Maybe your friend Terry pissed Neils off.  I dunno, just a thought. I get
riled up too.  Enough threats of near phyisical violence. Look, let's not
get out of hand, there will be no fighting.  Unless of course it's "Kung-Fu
Fighting".  Ever wonder who made that song?  Chinese Negroes, that's who.

Now lighten up.

Peace,
John

P.S. Neils is a good man.  There are pople on this list who pissed him off.
At least he is offering to put people in his kill file instead of doing an
OJ.  I mean things COULD be worse.

Now back to the third round.  My money is on Neils in round 5, TKO by
unanimous decision.

Krista is from Montreal.  I personally didn't get a chance to get awary
from studying for my finals to see her spin but I did get to spend a little
time with her while she was in town.  Hopefully she will come again.

The top reasons when it's time for a new dj:


Top Several Signs It's Time For a New DJ.

  -  Four words: James Brown Is Dead.

  -  The mixing sounds like it was done on a veg-o-matic

  -  The DJ is just standing there staring at the way cool
      label design and it goes round and round and round . . . .
      (this is only really bad if the needles hit the inner groove
      when shes doing this)  <Actual Anecdote>

  -  Two Words: Amtrax Derailment

  -  You lose your sanity and proclaim "even breakbeat would be better
        than this junk!" (of course assuming that you realize that
breakbeat
        is the most annoying gunk in the galaxy...reminds me of being
forced
        to clean my room as a child)

  -  The dj actually *starts* spinning breakbeat
    
  -  You begin to humm your favorite classic rock song
    
  -  Wax in your ears turns out to be a GOOD thing
    
  -  Ready ready SKIP!
    
  -  Amtrax Just Had Another Acciednt
    
  -  You hear crickets between songs
    
  -  Dj starts screaming "lets scratch the night away!"
      or alternatively and more effectively "its breakbeat time!"

  -  When there are more backspin segues than grooves on the record

  -  The dj picks up the needle and move it back a couple inches
      cuz it was about to end and they were talking to other people

  -  A pair of headphones comes flying out of the booth...

  -  Someone walks up and requests prince or janet jackson
      and the dj is glad to hear a good request finally


had to share it....

plur everybody,

--adam--

i have heard it!  'bout a month ago at LunarSeed...
pure noise?  nah...pure heaven!  it was a track that started with a
fairly light 4/4 beat...added a layer of goa-ish synth bass, started to
build...then busted out with a floaty-spacey drum'n'bass line.  yikes! 
it sent tingles down my spine!

this is why DMT is so convenient... all the information received on a 48 
hour acid stint can be obtained in ten minutes...  a very quick and deep 
in and a very quick out... and the fact that its metabolized within half 
an hour makes it the safest psychedelic on the market... hell, caffeine 
stays in your system three times as long... but DMT is not an escapist 
tool... this is a biotechnology designed to instruct on how to coexist in 
parallel spacetime continuums... not that you have to take it seriously, 
but don't take it without the commitment to gain something from the 
experience... wave probability isn't something to fuck around with, 
especially when your mind is the link...

notice how psychedelic art (circa the 60's) is now being produced by 
people who never touched psychedelics in their lives... this is because 
LSD now sits comfortably within the collective subconscious... it is far 
more accessible now than in 1960... i wonder what will happen once DMT 
consciousness sits this comfortably a decade or two down the line... 
perhaps this is the quantum leap Mckenna and so many others expect to 
happen in 2012, coinciding with some astrological developments...  Leary 
said on his spoken word LP "once that last person turns on, it will be 
like an enormous ripple of laughter... everyone will just start 
laughing..."  biotechnological invention spawns viral induction...

anyone i know who became a casualty was using drugs recreationally, 
and not integrating their experiences before dosing again... this was not 
for mere adventures in spiritism, but for the banal intoxication of it... 
i've seen the downward spiral in a few cases actually... it starts with 
weekend use which accelerates into twice a week... and as usage increases 
the subconscious residue of undealt with trips builds- even if they're 
totally unaware and thinking they're still having a good time... it's at 
this point that Spalding Gray's metaphor to a pile of shit brown energy 
piling on a stainless steel counter, and this is attatched to a pile of 
bubbly pastel positive energy so if you pull the negative off you're left 
with nothing but a stainless steel counter... some casualties just go 
catatonic for awhile... others let the negative build under the surface 
until WAMMO!  the BIG BAD TRIP... after which they go straight edge and 
deny all their experiences or at least quit drugs for a long period of 
time... many of this type of casualty finds it convenient to blame the 
drugs for all the terrors of their own subconscious mind...

...the key in all of this is to remember that we are using drugs for 
PURSUITISM NOT ESCAPISM... take responsibility for what you ingest... 
know what it is at least... take the time to research it... i read as 
much as i could find by Grof, Leary, Hoffman, McKenna and several other 
research engines that spent their careers studying psychedelics before i 
dropped my first tab, and i didn't stop there...

as a sometimes practicioner of chaos magick, i know myself that rituals 
needn't have any orthodox form... but there needs to be some forethought 
put into the act... a goal to accomplish through sleight of mind 
technique... this does not include simply dropping acid with a bud and 
going to a party and seeing what happens... more empirical methods yield 
better results... the most one could observe from a party experience, and 
 vaguely at that, would be how the collective subconscious affected their 
consciousness throughout the evening... in throwing parties and djing i 
have had a better position of observation, watching how the programming 
affects the environment... and how a subconscious message can be sent 
with specific resonance at peak astrological dates to exact results 
within the scene... xenophrenic was an event that changed the london, 
ontario rave scene for 2 years and the boob series in toronto is 
currently invoking experimental drum+bass as a force to be reckoned 
with... we took away the four-on-the-floor for a night and everyone lost 
it!... (timothy leary once said "it becomes necessary to go out of our 
minds in order to learn how to use our heads")... the best parties are 
always planned around key dates, even if the promoters are totally 
unaware of occultural phenomenon... some promoters do it out of instinct, 
the ones who are more aware of it (at least the ones out here) seem to 
have the most intense parties... it's too bad we couldn't post suggested 
"drop co-ordinates" like the Operation Organic series out here (E23, A2) 
and get more people involved in a feedback process to make the craft even 
more effective... 

...but it has to be a responsible combination of science and religion, 
art and logic, 23, not some new-age quackery which can't be objectively 
discussed...


perhaps i digress into esotericism, but i hope those of you out there who 
understand will appreciate this...

HI!

I'm new to the area and the list. I was just wondering if there is
anything going on in San Jose next weekend that is not on the Sfraves
Calendar.

                                                Thanks

That's right, I'm posting again. This time it's to tell EVERY single person
on here that if this crap does NOT stop here and now, I will make it a
point to have you taken off this list for good or at least I'll die trying.
I don't just mean Neils and John, I mean ANYONE. This does NOT belong on
this list. If your going to fight, take it off this list after the first
flame. You would not believe what things can be accomplished off in
private. Neils and myself worked out our little tiff, so why can't everyone
else do the same.

You do NOT have to CC: the list when your flaming someone, do it off the
list. I'm here to meet new people, talk about parties and read the BSP's.
Not F-you for saying this to so and so. If you don't like Neils post to the
list then I suggest you put him in YOUR kill file, otherwise take it off
the list. People flaming him for what he is saying only makes it worse. So
let's stop this nonesense.


I think EVERYONE needs to take a good look and read the Welcome to SFRaves
letter again. It's cut and dry about what should and should not be on this
list. If your not sure, then either don't post it, or re-read the Welcome
message again, if what your going to post doesn't have anything to do with
"raving" or what it describes on the Welcome letter, then DON'T post it to
the list, post it privately to the person that you want to address.


Take this warning however you want, but believe me when I say I'll make it
a point to have you removed from this list, or die trying, if you don't
comply with the rules of this list. And this my friends goes for EVERYONE.


I don't need a post saying, "I agree, or way to go, or even, I'd like to
see you try it". Just comply to the rules of the list and everything will
be fine.

 Hey! I think some raves could use a LOT MORE breakbeat in the mix! Check
out some of the CDs from the Moonshine label to hear what I mean...

 Adam - what's your opinion of jungle/drum & bass ?

--	Frankfurt is chock full of techno clubs.  It is the most 
"American-like" city in Germany.  The architecture and skyline is 
wonderful because it is a big banking city with many skyscrapers and 
such.  However, be careful when you travel because Frankfurt's crime rate 
is also infamous.
	I haven't had the chance to go to certain big name clubs in 
Frankfurt myself, but the clubs there are well known.  As far as I know, 
 "Omen" is supposed to be by far the best.  There is also the "Tunnel 
club," which seems to be very popular.  The third that comes to mind is 
"Dorian Gray."  It is located in Frankfurt airport itself and the club DJ 
is Mark Spoon (extremely famous techno-DJ in Germany who has taken all 
his hype to heart).  I personally do not care for Mark Spoon because he 
is too arrogant and his DJ-ing is over-rated.  He has gotten so fat off of 
his profits that he doesn't even try to please the crowd anymore--he 
spins whatever he feels like spinning (which resulted in an extremely bad 
session once that completely overwhelmed me with disgust).  However, 
personal dislikes aside, everyone knows that he is a master at his craft 
and you should go hear what the best of German techno culture has to offer.
A more comprehensive listing can be had by the monthly _Frontpage 
magazine_ which contains almost all German party dates in its 
"Silverpages" (You have to buy Frontpage itself, but you can get just the 
Silverpages free at any techno type store).  Another mag with listings is 
_Groove(y)_ which is a freebie at techno-culture stores.  Another option 
is the city specific _Prinz_ which isn't too expensive with decent listings.
You can also surf the rave homepages on the net which contain specific 
German/European party information.

Hope this helps,
MellowDrama

P.S.  You can always contact me personally for more information.  Also 
keep in mind, that since Germany is so small (compared to CA) that 
traveling to other towns for parties is a common occurence (there are 
many gems out there).

i suppose. i guess my point was that there are a lot of folks who are
really throwing their all into
this effort for the pure joy of it. let me put it to you, since you have
one of the most phat portable
systems in the area-where do you throw your allegiance when faced with a
choice of gigs?
there seem to be a lot of folks in this community willing to give of
themselves to friends.
i was really trying to convey a sense of empowerment that i feel as part of
this community,
and am really quite humbled by it all, actually. no 'tude intended: hope

Hmm, 
We have digressed down to threats now?  Very totalarian...  I couldn't
STAND bullies in schoolyards when I was a kid I still cant stand
them....  Im not trying to act tough, thoese that know me know I don't
have to be.  And allthough I live by my creedo of, "if it's not
benifical then keep it off the list".  However to all rules there are
exceptions, and this is one...  

Tim, if you post such a threat (and that's what your inital post was, a
threat) how do you think newbe's will react?  The young follow by
example of the old so I wouldn't be suprised if, in the oncoming months.
more verbal threats are posted...  Animosity created, and if you are
able to unsub people from the list,  then is this listing going to be
ruled by fear?   Very George Orwellish.  To the best of my knowlage 1984
wasn't a very PLURRY book... 

Hmm,  nice chapter in the SFR storybook though.  Im not upset, im not
happy..
Im just trying to...

This is so stupid.  I have great respect for many of you on the list.  I 
would dare say just under a majority (since the bulk are often silent).  
In any case, knuckleheads threah...geez, I dunno what to say.  At first I 
was pissed my name was mentioned, but then I was just pissed that a 
threat is used to cancel another threat.

Keep your threats to yourslef.  There is no net police.  If you want to 
die trying to get people removed from the list, please be my guest.  I 
have always thought higher of human life.  this list is NOt worth your life.

The threats are really dumb people. Let's stop the insanity now.  Many 
ahve already chose to ignore all of this and startr to ask relevant 
questions (Laary Ching, I applaud you my brother !).  Can we get to these 
issues instead of the dumb stoopid threats.

Nobodoy is going anywhere, nobody is going to be removed, nobody is going 
to die trying.

There are some good threads going on like UG's which I think should be 
discussed.

Can we get to it now ladies...I'm glad.

Later on,
John

P.S.  Next time you use my name sucka, you had better be prepared to pay 
my some jackaranda.  My name is copyrighted, and a trademark.  You are 
not allowed to use it unless you pay.  Dig?  But I'll allow a waiver 
since you're a knucklehead and may not know better.  Besides, I like you.

Peace out now.

Pax.

Subject: 10 Best Experiences in 1996
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

This is the end of the year, and my first year in SF.  Its also time to
introduce a new topic with a positive vibe to the list, "Your Top 10
Experiences of 1996".  

I'm going to propose to XLR8R's editor's that these postings be featured on
their new site, so there's some kind of record of this...  If you don't want
yours republished, please say so.

These should be somewhat rave/techno related, but any "satori" experiences
would be cool too!  

Here's my top 10 (not in any order):
----------------------------------

1.  Burning Man -- Meeting my new friend, Charles Uzzell-Edwards in the Chai
tent, after a night of dancing by fires in a hallucinogenic state, he played
Money Mark's "Keyboard Repair" entire album and maintained the chill Buddha
posture even though someone was having an acid freakout.

2.  Burning Man -- Having gotten jungle DJ's UFO and Noel up to the desert,
watching them take over the beautiful Wicked sound system.

3.  Going to the Top in lower Haight every Saturday to hear jungle music
mixed by my favorite jungle DJ's, hangin' out in the back with happy junglists.

4.  Seeing the Chemical Brothers three times!  Also, seeing Meat Beat
Manifesto for the first time, after listening to their albums for years.
Seeing Goldie and Doc Scott too!

5.  Burning Man:  Driving our rented Chevy Blazer over to the naked people
mud pit and playing Noel's remix of Alex Reece's "Everybody Loves the
Sunshine" while we watched mud-covered people slip 'n' slide.

6.  Driving to Big Sur once a month to work on the Henry Miller Library web
site; once I climbed to the top of a mountain with my friend Eddie, got
baked and could see the coast, the ocean, the mountains and sunset -- a
"satori" moment for sure, another time with Charles Uzzell-Edwards and his
wife it was raining and I was very sick so we huddled by a fireplace
listening to ambient music while the rain drummed against the roof all night.

7.  Seeing cool sci-fi/technology/nature movies, especially "Bladerunner" at
the Castro on the widescreen; "Synthetic Pleasures" twice and "Baraka"
twice.  The Low Res techno show at 111 Minna was great too, especially the
FSOL film, which blew my mind.

8.  Free Tibet Concert:  Laughing to myself when Beck made a joke about
jungle when he sped his drum machine up to 180 bpm (he's got a sense o'
humor) ....  Interviewing Tibetans, Adam Yauch and Cibo Matto and having my
article published in Giant Robot magazine.

9.  All the times that I met and got to know the DJ's, web hackers and
techno enthusiasts (especially junglists) of San Francisco, including Jonah
Sharp, the XLR8R Andrews, Charles U.E., Noel, UFO, DJ Thad, Abstract, Tomas,
Flux, the Hotwired BetaLounge crew, Dina Marie Alegmana, Freaky Chakra, DJ
Steve from Noc Noc, Raven Lafay, Jessie Singer and many many other cool
people, including the ones I danced with but never met.

10.  Seeing the Survival Research Labs show in that big construction pit,
which made me think a lot about explosions, violence and the ability of
people to create art and destroy it too.  

--------------------------------------------------------

A note on this last one:  Art, especially DJ performances, etc., is
sometimes at its most beautiful when it is only there for a moment, making
it more valuable and memorable.  Its just like all of us -- someday we'll be
30, 40, 50 and will be thinking back about our 'raving' days.  I don't know
how I'll explain all of this to my kids, but these memories are something
I'm going to hang on to.

Thank you SF Raves, San Francisco and everyone else for making this a great
year for me!

OK, I give myself one more since I'm posting the first message:

11.  DJ Gamall (now in NYC) sold me his mixer for $20 -- much less than its
worth -- I have to attribute this to good karma. I'd thought he was an aloof
kind of guy before, but some people you just have to get to know.  Seeing
such good karma, so unexpectedly, was an eye opener for me.  Don't judge people!

I am writing you all to get a feel for your interest in the following:  A
few friends and I have concidered (but havn't acted) for quite some time now
throwing a party that would be idm/intellijungle in one room, and ambient in
the another.  The space would be set up like two big ambient rooms
basically, but there would be some dance space as well as
couches/carpet/pillows and what not in the idm room.  You could dance if you
like, or you could just relax and consciously listen.  The chill room would
be chillin as usual.  

What I want to know is, what is the interest level for an event like this?

Rick

I had good intentions. Most everyone knows me enough to know I was spitting
hot air. I couldn't and wouldn't try to have people taken off the list.

I think it's time for another BBQ&BEATS ..hehehe yeah right, it would
probably rain again. But we did have fun for those who showed up. Stay
tuned for the next one in the New Year sometime around late Feb early
March.

What everyone doing besides going to Freaky People this weekend????

that's nuts! I've never thought of that... did the lack of mixing bother
people at first, or were they OK with the fact that they were basically
dancing to mixtapes?

I'm not sure how varied the tastes are throughout Germany...but if the 
music is at all similar to what I experienced this summer at the Love 
Parade in Berlin...then expect gabber/trance hardcore (whatever its 
called) at 200 bpm.

There was some variation but not much. I think there was 750,000+ people 
for that parade, so its ok to say techno is mainstream pop culture there.  They
just love it FAST and HARD...

Well the list manager is Brian B. and as far as I know, he is the only one
who can throw people off the list, I think it has only happened once or
twice (if at all)
in SFRAVES history. Over the years the list has gone through changes but I
for
one feel that the current squabblings are rather constructive, I admit
people need to
put less PLUR suffixes on their sentences and try actualizing more of the
real thing (respect that is)
for indeed that is what it's all about.  But it does seem that issues of
race, code words and the like 
keep cropping upe list at least once a year so it seems that this is
obviously a subject that
is crying to come out.  Rather then sweeping it under the rug, (as it
always is) maybe folks should try to deal with
it in a loving and respectful manner.  Denial and vitrol will get no-one
anywhere and the tacking of a PLUR
onto the end of a sentence doesn't gurentee your admission into "raver
heaven" on judgement day.

Maybe what needs to happen is Connection 4 :)

Alot of it has to do with them making there own music and putting it on DAT
like I believe Goa Gil does. That's why you find him mixing DATs often.
It's mostly his own music.

	this is a "pure" acid/E casualty scenario, which is relatively
rare. it's much more common for someone to use a powerful psychedelic
infrequently,  but to combine it with regular use of something "harmless"
like humboldt green, which slows down processing of the experience enough
that the same psychic gunk accumulates. this type of drug user takes a lot
longer, and the exact causality is harder to pin down, but it's pretty much
the same process you described so well. 

> some casualties just go catatonic for awhile... 
> others let the negative build under the surface 
> until WAMMO!  the BIG BAD TRIP... 

	... but most just start acting like bigger & bigger assholes
more & more of the time until nobody wants to be around them. they don't
even want to be around themselves. so they switch over to the pure escapist
drugs & they're left with only drugs & other people motivated primarily by
drugs for company. 

	does any of this sound familiar to anyone here?

Yeah, I know... I guess that's the attraction, right tim? that you won't
hear his music *anywhere* else? I know alot of people (esp. dj's) who
disrespect goa gil because he doesn't mix, (the mixes on his tapes sound SO
BAD =) but no one can deny that his music is the BOMB.

I have a couple quick terminology questions: 

please describe both technically (bpm, layering, etc.) and in "feel", the 
following:

-gabber
-breakbeat (what is a breakbeat?)

also, where does the word Goa come from? I seem to remember reading that it 
references to a meditation or trance (practice??) (sect??) (style??)

His music is certainly good, funny thing is that his CDs are mixed better
the when he mixes at a party. Go figure. He may not be able to mix well,
but the music make up for a lot of it.

Indeed, the PLUR and un-PLUR are but the yin and yang of the essence of
existence.  While their duality is evident, they are both essentially one.
Look at any point in human history, you'll see PLUR and un-PLUR.

Give me some of that DOUBLEPLUSGOOD!  ;)

>Experiences of 1996".

I agree, though I think this should be somewhat limited to even vaguely RR
experiences, so the NRR cops don't get itchy trigger fingers...

here's my top ten:

10: FnF at pt. molate 2.24.96. My first genuine good-vibe rave experience.
Meeting a ton of SFRavers and dancing in the mud for fun.

9: Mad Mondays. I went to Mad almost every monday in february and march
(until it got shut down for awhile) and LOVED IT! Ethan's sets consistently
blew me away, and he even gave me one (2.12.96) on tape for free...thanks
ethan!! I still listen to it regularly!

8: Viberation on the beach 8.17.96. This was my first experience putting
together a party, with my boys Terry and Adam and Tim and Tom and Jonathan
and others... It's paved the way for another viberation, coming out
blastin' like yosemite sam sometime this spring. =)

7: CCC/Goa Gil 10.5.96. A genuine trance party at my own house? fuckin' A!
Goa Gil absatively posolutely TORE SHIT UP.

6: Freedom 7.6.96. The first massive I've ever had a really good time at.
Meeting Andy W., who was cool enough to give me a ride (but hogged the
fries =). Meeting a ton MORE SFRavers, including (but not limited to)
brendan and phelps and re-meeting a bunch more. Also had my first
ExpEriEncE there. =D

5: FnF, 7.27.96. Yowza! My first all-night friends and family. The space
was so perfect, the people so open, and everything worked out wonderfully.
Left with a feeling of deep satisfaction. Also this is where the seeds of
viberation were sown.

4: Harmony 3-year 9.14.96. My first time helping out as a member of
Harmony, as well as having a great time with a ton of friends new and old.
This party was so well-excecuted I don't even have the words to describe
it...

3: FnF 10.26.96. despite the early bust which almost left me in tears, we
moved to a dinky little garage in Redwood City where the party continued
'til noon. In the immortal words of Wayne: this party was "pure."

2: Wrinkle in Time 11.16.96. My favorite b-day party EVER.

1: right now. the culmination of all the great moments and the memory of
all the good times I've had is really giving me the warm fuzzies.

didn't you see the finale of star trek the next generation... alternative 
realities are what DMT invokes... everything around us is a mass a 
energy... LSD strips it down to particle theory... you can reduce the 
world to molecules, and then fuck with your perception to paint it 
differently... or, if you just let the drug ride you (instead of 
vice-versa) your subconscious will paint it for you... on large doses, 
you can slip into wave probability theory... but the come-down usually 
confuses the information gained... DMT literally throws you in an 
alternate probable reality... that's why it seems so inhuman at first, 
then you realize thats why we're all here... to transmute realities... 
just like Picard... of course this can all be accomplished without 
drugs... in order for drugs to work, your brain has to be able to perform 
the same functions to start with... the ohm symbol is an abstraction of 
the original yin-yang which was a black circle with a white dot, a white 
circle with a black dot and a circle (representing the mu, or void from 
which all has come)... the little dot and wavy line above all of this is 
theorized as representing particle theory and wave probability theory... 
of course they didn't call it such, they had more of a poetic 
worldview... but they discovered what science has discovered in the last 
century thousands of years ago... compare the layout of the I Ching to 
DNA... and did you ever notice how the arms and legs on the dancing shiva 
are extended and coil around, not unlike a DNA helix?

shit to think about...

You can't get a virus by reading an email message -- you have to run a
program.  The real virus here is that people waste bandwidth by sending
and resending the message.  Remember the "Good Times" virus?

Now if someone mails you a program as an attachment, and you decide to run
that program, all bets are off.  But your computer cannot be harmed simply
by reading mail.

That's what I thought!  However it has happened with the person I got the
message from. I'm trying to figure out how that happened. I still can't
believe it, but then what happen to this persons machine???  I havn't
called the number yet but I'm about to.

the following critical words in my reply to someone else's humorous
post -

 to which someone else reacted -

 Gosh -  things ARE getting pretty dogma-tic here on SFRaves ...

Well, sorry for adding to the bandwidth. But as someone who likes to play
with virus's and see how they work and how they are made. This got my
attention because of the fact that the person that sent me mail about it,
happen to have gotten a real virus at the same time they read this email
and they didn't know it was a hoax and blamed it on that. I just found out
from the Web that it was a hoax. Kind of funny though, getting that message
and a real virus at the same time.

hi all,

just want to introduce myself and hopefully meet some of you at freaky
people. charity in october was my first rave, but i've been hitting one
almost every week since then. although i was a dj at kalx for a period of
my existence, the music didn't hit me until i was introduced to the
accessories associated with raving.

although i've only been on the list for only a couple of days, i think the
community isn't too atypical of the others i am a part of. you have your
periods of flaming and trivalities, but its got real substance as a
community.

i'll probably be a cocteau twins freak this friday, so say hi to me and
i'll speak gibberish...

ooze out and anyhow

ps hi to maly and minor minor if he's around....

1)	really discovering how important it is to be giving of yourself,
to think compassionately of others no matter who they are; to really feel
that to find something in yourself that you can give unselfishly that will
benefit others once you have shared it...not just money but a "vibe" or an
attitude or a perspective too. look for love inside and share it...

First half of the year went kinda slow/bad for me, So most of my top ten 
has been in the past few months.. PLUS I think I'm losing my long-term 
memory (eek!) ANYWAY, Here's my top 10...

10) December 18th, Ed Rush and Dj Trace. If it goes off, it's definitely 
gotta be in my top 10. Heard (from a friend in NZ) Ed Rush is too much 
to handle!

9) 2o12 - although i ended up falling asleep for an hour or 2, i got to 
watch my goa-head friend dance for hours on end to psychedelic trance, 
and gained an ultimate respect for him :) plus the friendships i made 
there, the group hug at the end and the chai was just too good :)

8) Fantasy Island - because I brought my best friend to her first rave, 
danced next to a guy who brought a whole drumset in to play with the 
house (breakbeats manmade live! hehe!), running around filling 
waterbottles all night for people and watching the sun rise off the 
ocean with the bay bridge in the background.. beautiful

7) Lucky Charms. March 31 - not only my favorite cereal! :P :P :)

6) Famtasia - Meeting tons of friendly beautiful people, alot from the 
SFraves list, chilling in the ambient room and not falling asleep to 
ambient for once (hehe), jonathan's set making me dance on NO sleep :)

5) Rhythm and Sound - WENT OFF. 150 Folsom turned into a jungle haven. 
Being turned away at the Wrinkle in Time mapoint was a bummer, but this 
was a way to end the night on a phat junglist positive note. 

4) some sort of massive at Home Base on March 2nd, the night before my 
birthday, got so many birthday greetings and hugs it overwhelmed me! :) 

3) The second Audio Impact - Aint nuthin better than going off on some 
phat jungle sets with your friends for only $5 and having the bass 
rattle your soul! (GREAT SOUND SYSTEM! Gateway was it?) Stareyes and 
Fluxs' intelligent sets rocked my mind. :) YUMM!!!!!!

2) Halloween Tribal Massive - Listening to Dj Rap go off on the tables 
and losing my mind and soul in the music. And I can say she's as 
beautiful as the beats she drops. Also that night, Dieselboy dropping 
"wishing on a star". and walking in to "Code Red - Conquering Lion," a 
CLASSIC and one of my favorites. Great night, met some beautiful 
junglists, and introduced my friend to jungle, and left with a smile on 
my tear-stained face! :)

1)In general: hugging, smiling, loving, and meeting wonderful people. 
Finding a second family. Experiencing the ultimate love for music, 
particularly jungle/drumnbass. As my friend Paul put it, (and he puts it 
so right!) "Music is food for my soul, and people are food for my 
heart." Could anyone say it better? SMILES and HUGS to all of you, 
espscially those who have helped make these top 10 the most wonderful 
experiences of my life! I LOVE YOU ALL! :) 
See ya all at freaky people and/or audio impact!

Yeah, while we're at it, let's invite all of the TV reporters and camera men to shoot 
it, so they can twist it even more!  No, really...

Dylan, u r so right on! Anybody can see this evil is at work around us right now. 
Urbana/Bloomington, IL has got the nicest vibe going and it's just starting (and that's 
why). There is little to no drug activity in this scene. As opposed to Chicago, where 
most of the bad vibes and attitudes (IMHO) are from the drugs and pushers who are 
trying to make a living by fucking over others. I will flat out say that anyone who is 
selling K, cocaine or herion is an asshole. Further, I am going to disassociate myself 
with all people who choose to associate with these creeps. Sadly, this includes a few 
freinds of mine, but they are going to have to decide where they stand, 'cause I know 
where I stand on this! ;-)

Just like standing up to the crap promoters who continue to rip us off with shitty 
"events", we have to stand up against these assholes and get them the hell out of our 
scene. They are messing it all up and worse yet, hurting our friends!

PLUR -> RAGE!

killer time! Watching the crowd during a break in a song, everyone screaming,
and the beat came back in and the whole room just started jumping!!!

1. FAMTASIA 11/15/96 This was one of the best learning experiences in my
life! I have so much more respect for the promoters and people involved in
throwing a party! and playing for a packed house!!! I was on cloud nine!!!

Jonathan

sorry i have to make this eleven: being on Sfraves and meeting so many
wonderful people thru it! It has really changed my life! (Sounds like some
religous thing or something!)

I have to agree with Mike Migurski that there is no reason to get cynical
about 1997. There are way too many dynamic, energetic, and creative people
to allow for stagnation in the scene. I've been fortunate enough to be
friends with many of these people because there's nothing as satisfying as
watching people you care about do monumental things. These are the people
involved with Progress, Harmony, and Lepidoptera. I know for a fact that
these same people care enough to never let "it" turn into the nightmare
vision suggested above.

I use "it" because we have yet to see what it turns into and I'm DAMN
optimistic! This scene has been so good to me and my friends. I think we of
the North have less to fear than our Southern brethren in regards to
commercialization. I think Southern California is a good example of how
prolific, adaptable,  and resilient this scene is.

As For Memorable Events of 1996:

1)Harmony 3 year

2)Progress on 4/20

3)Evolution/Deharo- February

4)Bravo Co. E-Party(hands down)

5)A Wrinkle in Time

6)Harmony-February

7)Lepidoptera(OF COURSE!!!)

8)Spending a weekend with the Cocteau Twins in Charles Manson's old Mansion
off         the Haight and         being corrupted while I was
there!!!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
9)VISUALS!VISUALS!VISUALS!VISUALS!VISUALS!VISUALS!VISUALS!VISUALS!VISUALS!

10)Being iebriated and stoned and seeing the TUNNEL all at the same time.

Ok--you can go.

Are there any recommendations for weekly events out of town ravers should
check out, and anything other than Cool World on New Year's?  I have
printed out the SFRaves Calendar, but the it doesn't give me a good feel
for what the crowds are like at the various weekly events.  We're curious
about what we could expect at Cloud Factory, too.

Summer and I would also like to find out if the Monday Night Dinner is
still planned for 30 December, we would like to join that since it reminds
us of the small weekly Wednesday coffee house meets ravers hold here in
Austin.

my name is Clinton, I live in Minnesota. and I thought 
i should let you know i am taking yet another vacation
 to san francisco after a nine month wait!

i was subbed to the sf list last april and march for
a while before coming to visit over spring break. i 
wonder if some of you remember me. well, here i am
listening in on the west coast conversation again.
i'll be in town january 4-10 and i am excitedly looking
for things to do and fun people to hang out with.

When i was in SF last, i had a blast at Mad at the Bahia
and at a party at the Berkeley Marina where i met some
of the nicest ppl in my life! I also played some gabber
on the epiphany of sound show on KZSU-Stanford.

Please help me enjoy this trip once again. I know i will
anyway, but it's so much more fun when you make new friends!

yours,
clinton

	I think there's a double urban legend: One about the good-times
virus, and another that its impossible.

	Actually, you can get a virus from email, in at least three different
ways:

	- running an encapsulated program (usually requires approval)

	- AOL has escape codes which can be activated by mail

	- some "intelligent terminals" of the early 80's also had dangerous
		escape codes, and some emulators may emulate them (although
		most manufacturers now know its a bad idea).

	However if you get one of the common DOS/WIN viruses, and havent
actually executed something you got in a message, its probably a coincidence.

I dont know if these are my 'best' experiences, but they certainly were some
of the most significant(in no particluar order)
1. Seeing Stacey Pullen spin at the Space Children party.
2. OD'ing on 2CB.
3. The Gateway party in Portland(Pure Energy!).
4. The 2nd Sunset Boat party.
5. Witnessing THE car accident at Burning Man.
6. Being mistaken for Chez Damier at the Summer Love Party, Vancouver BC.
7. Having Dinner with Carl Craig and his girlfriend.
8. Walking out of my job at Silent Records/Pulse-Soniq Distribution after
being dared to do so(what fun!)
9. Listening to Dave Clarke go on and on about how much SF reminded him of
London, and how he wished he had a rental car to ruin on all the hills in the
city.
10.Hasnt happened yet........

Strollin down Telegraph today I decided to do something I haven't in the 
longest time - pop into Wicked and Primal and pick up some flyers!  I am 
proud to say, as an arrogant Real Raver ;), that I haven't gone to a 
flyered party in forever.  So, I was wondering what wuz up in the land of 
the glossy 4-color...

New Year's Eve
in addition to the infamous CW (the flier is beyond description), Spundae 
and Origin are throwing parties.

Spundae - Laurent Garnier from France, John Howard, Speedy from Vegas, 
and 14 other Spundae regulars.  (415) 974-9389
A club it may be, but their special parties are often very good!

Origin - (lookin' like a UG next to CW!)
Check this out - Minor Minor, Polywog (and others) and Dubtribe and 
Beyond Race LIVE.  (415) 675-5605

Saw a few fliers I didn't bother to pick up (why waste trees?) but 
upcoming are Kundalini, a Ghosttribe production (forgot the name), 
Gathering 5-Year, All in the Family, sumpin called "Acid Breaks" and 
sumpin else called "Candyland".

Things are the same in flyer-land.  Bright colors and cartoon mushrooms.

I also saw an old flyer (Thanksgiving) for Thurzdaze.  This used to be a $5 
bi-weekly 
with RESIDENTS DJ Dan and DRC - is it still goin on??  Or was this a 
one-time only party?

Love, Conservation,
and the Supa-Dupa Underground -
Word of Mouth Parties Rule!

1.) Running an encapsulated program you have received from a group is DUMB.
2.) Escape codes can easily be displayed by any ANSI supported system 
that can reprogram your keyboard.  Its always fun to hit "d" and have a 
bunch of stuff including echo y | del *.* pump out on you.

Other than the reprogrammed keyboard it is not possible for you to obtain 
a virus by reading your mail.

[ to sfraves ]
[ vaguely rave related ]

 Tomorrow night is our projects big Christmas Dinner at a hotel ballroom.
Free food, no host bar, door prizes, etc. Very conservative company.
In past years, the music was provided by a DJ, spinning
"Music of The Big Chill Generation" CDs ( or swing music for the older
members of upper management ) or "Hits Of The 70s and 80s" for us
youngins.

 Maybe, tomorrow night will be a little more contemporary. On the 
admission ticket, this is what's listed:

 Entertainment - Pure Ecstasy  (!!!!)

 I will attend this unflyered , private underground event, and post
a review here on SFRaves if enough people are interested...  :->

        My comments were more in relation to the scene in general, as a
whole in the US. I agree that there are plenty of good people involved with
the local scene. However from my perspective as one of editors of XLR8R, I
get to see and hear alot of stuff that goes on "behind the scenes" of the
parties, and folks it ain't pretty. PLUR is something very much talked
about, but when it comes down to the nitty gritty of putting on events, it
is VERY political, and egos and money enter into the picture way too much.
It's almost as if the more cool PC talk gets used to promote an event, the
more phoney those sentiments are. Let's face it, if you really are throwing
a solid, underground and spiritual vibey event, then you don't need to let
everyone know about it. They'll figure it out for themselves.
        As for me, I'm finding that the connection and vibe I used to find
at parties happens less and less, and therefore I go out hardly at all.
Maybe I'm cynical, maybe I'm just really picky. I don't know. I DO know
that the underground takes care of itself, and that it will change as the
people and parties change. IMO, DIVERSITY is the key to pushing the
underground forward, not more blinkered categorization and single genre
parties, which seems to be the norm everywhere, whether it's House, Techno,
Trance or Jungle. Hearing different music at a party is GOOD. Same stuff
all night is BORING. Raving was supposed to mean having an open mind.
Diversity of music, diversity of people.
         Unfortunately I think that my fears about commercialization and
losing of "rave" values is already with us. Most of the "nightmare vision"
I mentioned already happens, I just exaggerated them to make them even more
ridiculous.             Here's a musical example. Last year at this time
the quality of record releases in all genres was outstanding. This year
sadly the majority of music is  derivative, uninspired and frankly pretty
dull. Perhaps 2 out of 10 records is something worth playing. (I am VERY
picky, but my standards haven't changed that much since last year...)
        A case in point is jungle/drum and bass, which in the start of '96
was simply outstanding. Just about every record I heard was amazing. Since
the genre's acceptance and commercial success in the UK, the quality of
records has decreased to the point where I might buy one jungle record a
week. There is still solid underground music out there, you just have to
search harder to find it. Similarly there are still good underground
parties going on, they're just less frequent.
         RAVE IS DEAD! Like Punk, Rave was more an attitude than a style,
and also like Punk it will take 20 years till most people realize.
        THINK about WHY you're raving and the underground will take care of
itself.

Respect
Andrew

Ugggg.  when ever I think of "big Spundae Event" I can't for the life
of me shake the feeling of emptyness and disgust when the "live performance
of Jam and Spoon" turned out to be the diva women yelling "whats up
san francisco?!" over a vocal-less Jam and Spoon dat, while two dudes (who
did NOT look German) air-banded it on big, ugly synths that had neither Audio 
Outs or MIDI plugged in.  IMHO:  Avoid Spundae at all costs.

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

        The new issue of XLR8R (#25) is out on Thursday. We've taken a
slightly different approach to both the content (more broad based and
diverse subject matter) and presentation (much nicer looking with better
paper and more color.) Hope everyone digs it. Let me know what you think.

We're having a RELEASE PARTY on Friday 13th from 10pm till whenever. Should
be fun. If you come, make sure you say hi!
As usual, eclectic music.
Lineup is:
                 MARK E QUARK (hard house and disco)
                 TOMAS (downtempo/hiphop/jungle)
                 MATTY B (garagey house)
                 ETHAN JENKINS (jungle 'n funky shit)
                 ANDREW RAWNSLEY (techno and tribal)

$8, 18 and up. Info on 415.739.5281


        We are also looking for some new writers, both for
features/news/scene writing, and reviewers. I need reviewers of underground
Techno (esp: harder European stuff and Hardcore/Gabba), Trance and
Downtempo/Experimental stuff. if you're interested, get in touch with me
via this e-mail, or via xlr8r@cyborganic.net, and I'll pass on your info
the relevant editor, or get in touch myself.

what's wrong with James Brown is Dead?

this must've been written by a deep house fan or a hardcore fan...

what a great topic!
okay:
10) When the program director of KDVS said, when asked about techno on
KDVS at a new DJ training session, "Well, we like the ambient stuff, but
that T99 stuff that Noah plays:  we don't like that!"

9)  A house party at Jeyson's that lasted unitl about 2.30am and DJ
Marcone was spinning and a woman got up and danced in nothing but a
floor-length blonde wig and velvet undies.

8)  Q: A Celebration of Spring -- a party I tried to throw for my dorm
that wound up being me and DJ Marcone spinning rekkids in Oxford Circle
Park in Davis until the amplified sound permit went bad at like 11pm

7)  A Family Affair (Davis) -- a small party at the domes with lots of
friends...  the first time I took MDMA...  :)  really a change in my life,
I tell ya!

6)  One of my KDVS shows where I was so in the mix that I didn't answer
the phone because I forgot to look at the flashing light that signals an
incoming call.. when I finally answered, it was DJ Jericho and he said,
"Jesus Christ, Noah!  I've been sitting here for a half hour!"

5)  Sending out my Midsummer '96 tape to about a dozen folks who didn't
know it was coming.  :)

4)  Getting my diploma.  I had to go to the post office and sign for it
and everything!  I got it out and danced right there in the middle of the
post office.  Everyone thought I was a nut.  They were right.  :)

3)  Elevation II (SoCal-Raves party):  Jesus... what an event.  The start
of a three week high.  I met so many great people and was given the nicest
little knitted thingy that I wound up showing to Toby at the cabin party,
and it turns out his friend made it!

2)  SFRAVES Cabin Party III:  That weekend was so much fun!  It was so
nice to meet so many wonderful people and it had been so long since I had
spun for anybody besides my tape deck that I didn't know what to expect.
But it was _wonderful_.  I made great friends, got to see Joey get loose
and I even got to drive a rental car that was purple!

1)  Re-joining SFRAVES:  At first I just intended to stay on to read cabin
chatter and then unsub again, but I am glad I've stayed.  Even with the
bullshit, I still have much love for all of you and I love our scene!

So that's what I think
:)
PLUR!

I actually like Niels posts.  I especially liked the one he sent us right
after the elections.  Well-written and interesting...it made me want to
meet him in the flesh.

If he's getting a little testy lately...well..everyone has pressures and
bad moods.  I'm willing to put up with a little kvetching now and then.

By the way..how does one write a "killfile?"  I've always been slightly
curious about this.

Hey now...I totally agree as far as Jam and Spoon is concerned--I literally
listened to the first one minute of their set and then took off
downstairs--but I had a great time overall.  EFX?  Dan?  Tony, Carlos, Jon
Williams?  Stellar sounds from all of them, plus more from guys I never did
identify.  And the similar production on Memorial Day was a lot of fun,
too.  I definitely won't go to the New Year's affair, but I wouldn't
dismiss these special Spundaes out of hand.

While I would be the last to deny the attraction of a good Beyond Race
show, let's not neglect Dubtribe...they ROCKED the house last night in
Santa Cruz.  Too short, though, and a bit repetitive of the last time I saw
them...well, whatever.  Great fun, anyway.

If you like flyers, you might as well pick them up; the trees are already
wasted.  I like flyers, and I think I have most of these...I have an Acid
Breaks flyer that's pretty neat--it's mostly your basic super-modern
technological text styles floating over a swirly multicolored backdrop, but
what I like is that it manages to look really good in blacklight... it
glows well.  Intentional or not, I don't know, but it's very cool.  I'll
admire it, though I don't think I'll be paying the show a visit.

I am against this 100%.  Why?  Simply put, I think people need to grow
their relationships outside of the list.  Get to know some pople by going
to other events that are not necessarily SFR based.  Make some friends, get
invited.  I think it is as easy as that.  By providing reviews I think it
takes away from the magic, since I think UG's are very, very personal
events.  As for how-to's , I think I just gave THE formula for success.
It's not about being elite, it's about expanding your horizons, getting
out, and making friends, outside the list.

Not to be negative, but I am not down with the 1-2-3 cookbook of getting
into undergrounds.  To me it is the same thing that happened to raves in
teh first place.  At once intimate, now wholly exposed.  The "special"
quality is lost in the mass of people.  Nope, I think UG should be just
that.  Word of mouth or phone, not word of computer.  I think posting
reviews would just fuel the already annoying cries of elitist, and just
prove to be a "I'm in, you're not", that ain't necessarily right, and that
is not the spirit of UG, IMO.

Just my .02 worth.  I'm keeping my mouth shut.  To me UG is way to special
to "give" away.

Peace,
John

P.S.  SFR is pretty UG itself BTW.  How many people outside the list w/o
computers even know we exists.  I would call that special in it's own right.

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I really don't know why many of you have jumped on Neils and my shit.  I
can understand that many of you are upset that we've "ruined your vibe".
By now, I fully expect to be in many peoples kill file.  But I also know
that I am still on many people non-kill list.  The attacks on my brother
Neils have been even more aggregious.  Suprisingly, Adder has probalby not
been attacked publicly and it was HE and I who got into words.  Neils came
to my defense when many of you wanted to jump in and chime negative on me.
I guess in a certain way many were supporting Adder.  Hmmm...interesting.
In any case, I find the attacks on my brother distateful and wrong.

My man, and I am PROUD to call him my man, is a proud brother, who knows
plenty about history and could teach many of you quite a few lessons.  Not
only of history but of life.  Now some of you will say that "How do you
know that he has anything to show me...you don't know my life!".  Or don't
I?  If many of you can glean from MY posts that I am some angry man, you
can only imagine what I see from my view.  I wont enumerate it, just think
about it.  Neils has many experiences, and many views.  He is by far not so
one sided, and is a very fair person.  Like me, he jumps when he gets a
slight smell of those who are or who condone injustice.  I think, NO I
KNOW, it has something to do with his family and his life.  Much like
myself we have both felt the sting of injustice first hand.  It is not, as
it seems  for many of you, an excerise of academics.

Speaking for myself, I see the world as both good and ugly.  The good is
sometime hard to find through all the shit.  Yeah, we can rave, but there
are children who are starving, fighting wars, and being raped.  I can take
all the E and hug a teddy bear, and give out candy to my hearts content,
and I will ALWAYS know that no matter how good life is for me, for someone
else it is shit.  Why do I care?  Becuase I am raising a child, and
children matter to me.  SOmeone said to me, and I paraphrase, "..would you
want to ruin your childs view of wonder, with what could be called the ugly
truth, ruining the wonder." .  Since my son is Jewish and Bi-Racial, I
cannot let him walk this earth thinking that pevery person will perceive
him as an equal.  That would do him a disservice.  That is my world, and it
is a very, very real one.  Ask any jellybean ;(.

For all the negative you might see, there is a positive side to both Neils
and I.  It might require some work on your and OUR part to find it, but it
is there.  I used to fight viciously with Neils, read the archives.  But in
the end, we found we had more in common than difference, now I consider him
a strong brother, my man.  We BOTH had to work at it.  If you beleive in
all this religion you spout,all this PLUR, then you'll do the same.  If you
only look for the negative, then you will reap what you sow.

Any more negativity about Neils or I should be directed in private where it
can be handled properly.  Remember, pimp slaps are given at NO EXTRA
CHARGE! ;)

Now, lighten up...let's talk about UG's.  I'll whoop your butts in private,
or you can take it to my face.  That is MUCH better to me anyway.

Peace out, now time to answer all that private e-mail,
John

     Firstly, lets all be honest with ourselves : "Raving" in this or any 
     context basically means dancing to electronic music under the 
     influence of ecstacy or some other libido reducing, tactile 
     sensation-increasing empathogen.
     
     Do you know what impresses the shit out of me about dance culture ?
     
     Scantily clad beautiful girls (or boys) giving you smiles that melt 
     your heart.
     
     Tough lads that used to pick fights hugging each other and not being 
     worried about looking like a sissy.
     
     Those same guys that are the toughest heads in my hometown shaking my 
     hand and being *scarily* cheerful.
     
     Straights and gays dancing together to pumping toooons.
     
     Not having to bother with that whole pain in the ass chat up line 
     bullshit routine. If you chill, act natural, hang out the beautiful 
     people will come to you.
     
     Girls not having to listen to tired old chat-up lines.
     
     Being able to forget about your pains and troubles in the real world.
     
     Kicking it with your brother, your sister and feeling pure fucking 
     love so strong you don't even need to say it.
     
     Catholics and Prods coming together in Northern Ireland, nationalist 
     tattoes/union jack tattoes exposed and going for it.
     
     Talking to complete strangers and realising that the more you are your 
     own person the more people will like and respect you for being that 
     person.
     
     
     Partying hard like my friend Randolph to embrace what is left of life.
     
     
     Btw folks, you can take what you learn while under the influence and 
     bring it into your everyday life. After a while you may even attend 
     the occasional party sober and still have a good time. If I can do it 
     anyone can...

Most undergrounds are just that, Undergrounds.  They are not about elitism, but they are about being
connected, and I'm not talking about 28.8.  They're about expanding your horizons, a smile on the dance floor.
Surrendering into the now, and not having a job (or not caring that you have a job) to go to in the morning.
Mostly they are about being in the Tao.  I was out last saturday with a new friend who just came to visit from
Austin. Unfortunately the party fare seemed pretty lame, There was lovegarage. a full on deep house groove but
the crowd is way to clubby and pretentious (still the music is killer).  We first tried to go to the burning man
X-mas thing but discovered that that was Sunday not Saturday, still it was fun to crash some fashion show at the Somar gallery.  I
stepped outside LoveWorks to make a phone call and someone jumped out of a car and handed me a flyer for
Anarchest's Disco!! Donavan's underground being held in the mission, full on with Ernie Munson playing! (I first
achieved Trance at the hands of Ernie, at the Scandia Russian River Rave of 92.  Leave it to donavan to not decide to have
a party till thursday, and have the venue packed saturday night so that you couldn't get in. And indeed a UG it was.
Full on crackerjackin on the dance floor, E-piles, everything. Only problem was it was way too hot!, Garth was just
getting ready to spin (around 5 am) when the po-pos came and turned off the music.

Actually, Gil *can* beatmatch but the style of music he favors doesn't
generally seem to require it.  I think of him more as a "textures" DJ
than a "groove" DJ.  He has an uncanny ability to build up the energy
within a set.  That's almost the rarest quality of all.  Haven't seen
him spin for a while, but the first time was maybe mid-1992 at a small
party where the lineup was Gil, Carlos and Darwin Chambre (that's how
they spelled it then) playing live.  Now *that* was variety!

No, sigh.  No email message can cause a boot sector virus (what KIND?
Mac? PC? Sun? Linux? -- of course these so-called "alerts" never say).

For those who aren't aware, the comp.virus newsgroup on Usenet continues
to be an excellent resource for absolutely up-to-the-minute information
about viruses of all types (boot sector, "Trojan horses," macro viruses,
polymorphics, etc.).  And there are many Web sites devoted to this issue.

Hi all!  =)

 Well, I'm just recently finished with finals and can now focus on 
upgrades for Dionysus Dreams. I have some really big things plan so that 
my E package of entertainment is more portable and better looking than 
ever. 

 I would at this time like to thank all the folks who have personally 
helped me in some way. Thank you!! That was for the folks I will forget 
'cause my brain is feeble.

Andrew Knutsen.		For patience and financil support.
Steve Oppelt.		For more financil assitance and being a true friend.
Harmony crew.		You guys make me cry. Thanks everyone!!
Mike Clay.		For inspiration and support.
Nick Farwell.		For support and selfless help.
To the zillions 
of volunteers.		I could not have done it with out you folks!!
SFraves.		The fucking best group of people anywhere!!!!
crazy hugging ravers.	ahhhh, what can I say. I love you all!
The folks at various
warehouses.		Thank you for letting me be there with you.
The DJs			For thrilling my system!
The promoters		For making it happen!
The dancers.		For helping me move.
Mantra.			Hard core!
Gateway			For inspiration.
FnF			For keeping the faith.
Craig Larson		For intruducing me to this crazyness. I've come 
			home at last.


 Last but not least to Gregory Sandler;

 For giving me a chance at the first Harmony party and being true 
throughout the years. I love you.


 I'm certain I have not caught everyone who deserves to be thanked for 
helping me and specifically Dionysus Dreams. D. Dreams is a life long 
goal (well, since 1978 anyways) for me and thanks to the above people 
and more the Dream is coming alive.

 Look for better and deeper shows from Dionysus Dreams in the future. I 
can do it because you folks have supported me and I do do it because I 
love to.


peace and Happy Holidaze to all,





Ran D.Dreams

        Anyhow, I better get to the point before some of you guys (and
girls) get on
        my case about wasting bandwidth,etc.

        So, how's going to FreakyPeople this Fri???? :)
        I'll be there (hopefully if I can get my mom's car or a ride --I
don't want to 
        take BART into the city)  

        I'll be wearing my 'Marshmallow Suit' :) (its not edible -just looks
like a big
        marshmallow) and I'll bring lots of stickers and candy for everyone :)

        C-you all there! :)

Will these are not necessarily the best experience, but also best times,
feelings of 96 that I remember. There are several others, but I would be
listing them for days.

10. Viberation: My first party I spun at. Thought every mix sucked, but I
was told I did good. Too nervous though, and I guess you get over that
after awhile.

9. Spinning for 2 1/2 to 3 hours at Wayne old Loft for about 7-10 people.
Sitting next to Burger Kings roommate Brad, after every mix we'd look at
each other and go "Damn that was good" and then when I was done standing up
and the people sitting down on the floor said it was an awesome set. Great
Feeling.

8. Many trips to Sacramento with a case of beer and going to BioJeff house
to spin with him and listen to him spin. Trying to either trade a record or
have him make a mixed tape. Some of the best sets are done like that. Also
going to see a movie and having lunch with Amy S. and Melanie.

7. 2012

6. Sunsets/Sunset Boat partys

5. Cooking a shit load of lasagna for about 10+ people at Waynes old Loft
right before going out to a party. I love cooking for people.

4. WOMO, Now that was a party.

3. All of the Harmony parties I helped out with and went to.

2. All the FnF parties.

1. Throwing the BBQ & BEATS daytime parties. Even the one in the rain.

And of course meeting everyone I know in the "rave" scene the past two
years. All you guys and gals will never know how much you really mean to
me. I've never had a better time in my life, then I've been having the past
two years since I've been out of Navy.

        Welcome to the San Fransisco/Bay Area RAVE mailing list!
     
        NOTE:  This is a very high volume mailing list, consisting 
        mainly of topics of interest to those who live in the Bay 
        Area or plan to visit here.  Many new subscribers find the

*******************************************************************************
     
     
                       ***PLEASE READ THIS***
     
        This mailing list is dedicated to discussion involving the
rave/ underground club/techno scene now developing here in the Bay 
Area. But first, a little history....
     
        I moved up here from LA in the August of '91, fresh from being
heavily involved in the techno scene there for a couple of years.  I 
loved the scene down there, from breaking into aircraft hangers on a 
particular New Year's Eve, to sliding down a water slide at 2 in the 
morning, to picking up dozens of flyers with the most gorgeous artwork 
on them, to hitting all the local techno record stores and spending my 
life savings on compilation CD's, to having my mind twisted by the DJ 
work of Doc Martin, Barry Weaver, and count- less more..... and then 
when I moved up here to school, it was like culture shock to me - it 
was hard finding out about events, about clubs where the music wasn't 
Top 40 drivel, where there wasn't an age limit, etc.  But, I started 
picking up some flyers, meeting other people up here who knew about 
such-and such going on, going to rave-style concerts (The Orb was 
GREAT), and I came to realize that even though the scene wasn't as big 
up here, there was a much greater sense of _community_. By that I mean, 
people going to these parties and meeting lots of other people, all 
sharing a love for the music and the atmosphere; I guess the best way 
to descibe it is that it's very social, without being "cliquey" or 
exclusionary. And the best part of all is - the ravers go for the love 
of the music, much more so than for the drugs. Down south I was 
beginning to wonder whether the scene would degenerate into an excuse 
for teenagers to inhale nitrous or take X. The scene up here has 
restored my confidence in the future of this music, and of the culture 
that has developed around it.
     
        Well, that's my sentimental view of it all. Now for the meat
of the matter - the list. I want to promote the close-knit feeling of 
the scene up here by providing a forum for discussion about it. I knew 
from postings to the machester list as well as ba.music and 
rec.music.industrial that there must be quite a few people online in 
the Bay Area who were itching for some way to talk about the scene 
without annoying manc-list subscribers in Australia or USENET sites in 
Iceland. Well, here it is.
     
        Appropriate topics include: announcements of upcoming events;
reviews of previous shows/DJ's/new records, etc; discussion about 
SF-related and rave- culture-related topics, like smart drinks; 
discussion about rave-related stories on TV/in the newspaper, etc. 
Ideally we should try and stay away from, "Hey, did you catch that 
Orbital song on "Beverly Hills 90210" last week?"  stuff, or from 
over-generalizing ourselves: "Can Depeche Mode be considered "techno"? 
", etc. But, other than that, I want it to be pretty free form. The 
list should _not_ be about rave scenes in other parts of the world; an 
occasional post about a huge megaevent in LA or a monthly report on the 
scene in other cities might be okay, but remember there was a reason 
this is called SFRaves; if you want to start a mailing list for your 
area, ask your sysadmin, as that was all I had to do. If that fails, 
there's alt.raves, the USENET newsgroup, where you can post just about 
anything you want.
     
        This is how most of you got on this list:  you sent a message
to majordomo@hyperreal.com with the line
     
subscribe sfraves
     
in it.  Cool, perfect.  now, if you want off, you send the following 
message:
     
unsubscribe sfraves
     
And if you just want Derek Chung's weekly calendar, you can send
     
unsubscribe sfraves
subscribe sfraves-calendar
     
It's that easy :)
     
        Normal etiquette is to wait around 2 weeks or more before you
start posting anything; that ensures that you don't tread on old 
ground and that you have a reasonably good idea of the mindset of we 
who have been here for months. Another piece of bad etiquette that 
holds for most mailing lists on the net is to use the list to 
blatantly advertise or promote yourself; you can post info about where 
to buy smart drinks, for example, as a satisfied third party, but 
selling your own wares is somewhat verboten.
     
        Even though this list is geared to the Bay Area, anyone is
welcome to join. (Though you might get a little frustrated at being so 
far away!) As long as your comments stay within the context set above, 
no problem. I wouldn't mind if Mr. Ashdown wanted to post a review of 
the next rave he holds there in Utah :-).
     
        Please bear in mind that you are entering a virtual community;
that the people here exhibit a friendliness and familiarity with each 
other, and while criticism of posts is not discouraged, please treat 
other people's posts with the same respect you'd want yours treated.
     
        SFRaves itself has a great history - we've been up and running
since February, and since then we held a rave-nic in May (a picnic in 
the Oakland Hills where everyone brought food, I brought a sound 
system, a permit was obtained, and the Hardkisses and several sfravers 
DJ'd), as well as a full- out rave on a beach in Santa Cruz in August 
(called Connection, with Carlos, Dutch, Moonpup, SFRaver Jon Drukman, 
and others, lasted until 9 in the morning, free w/donations, and people 
called it the best rave they'd ever been too).  There may be references 
to past events and such... you can try mailing me first if you have 
what might be a "newbie" question (or I might say it's something you 
could ask the list).
     
        There is now an FTP/gopher/WWW archive installed on this
machine - that means, if you have direct Internet access, you can
     
1) do anonymous ftp to hyperreal.com and pick up any and all
files in the sfraves directory (the ambient directory is pretty cool too).
     
2) access it via gopher, i.e. "gopher hyperreal.com"
     
and the best, 
     
3) point your WWW browser to http://hyperreal.com/
     
There should be an up-to-the-minute calendar in there; if you have 
info on events that aren't listed, send me your info and I'll add it. 
If you have any other files you think would be appropriate, put them 
(via anonymous FTP only) in /incoming.  In the /sfraves directory 
there are also archived posts since March 1992, the month we started.
     
        The list's home was originally on a machine here at Berkeley
called Petrus - that machine was transferred to a different 
department, so I had to move the list to the OCF. However, the list 
was far too big for the OCF's mail handler to deal with, so it was 
moved to Stanford. Finally, in July of 1994, Stanford wanted their 
machine back, so I scrounged together some money and borrowed some 
bandwidth and put hyperreal.com online as a home for this culture we 
suddenly had.  Still, with over 6000 messages a day going through due 
to sfraves, there may be problems every now and then (multiple copies 
of messages, etc.) If everyone keep their cool and doesn't worry about 
it, it'll be fine. I read the group every day, so I see problems as 
they're happening.
     
        So, enjoy! For new subscriptions, write to sfraves-request at
the same address, and I'll be sure and respond promptly. And if you 
have a problem with a particular post, write to owner-sfraves (that's 
me, too!), and I'll look into it. Remember, this is _our_ list, so 
make it great!
     
        Love, happiness, peace, and respect,

In no particular order:

1.  The Chai hut at Burning Man.

2.  Spinning for six hours Friday night in the Chai hut at Burning Man.

3.  Strapping huge stalks of bamboo from my back yard to a ski rack on top
of my car, driving with them sticking out like antlers out in front of my
car and then setting them up like a bamboo forest at Burning Man.  The
"Bamboo Family!!" clanking our respective sticks of bamboo together on the
night of burn, then spearing the fallen BM.

4.  The rainbow out side FnF in the morning.

5.  All the live shows we were fortunate enough to play.

6.  The last to Tahoe cabin trips.

7.  My kind Lama after I asked him what I might do to purify my self of some
stuff I wasn't happy with anymore, requesting that I do what turned out to
be three to four times the amount of meditation per day than I was
previously doing.  I said "Lama I don't know if I can," and with out
hesitation he said "I think you can if you try."  He was right :)

8.  The Light camping party by the stream.  Hanging out with 20 or so
beautiful men, women and children as well as animals, all naked and natural
down stream at the swimming hole.  The warm feeling of love I felt in seeing
a beautiful couple naked, on the grass under a tree taking the braids out of
the womens hair.  A very primal feeling watching such a grooming ritual.  It
was just beautiful.

9.  Playing music at RAW and meeting Cami, Andy, John and several other
sfraves because of it.  Working there for food.  Getting paid for playing
there with a huge box of organic fruit.

10. Taking a trip to Salt Lake City to visit a friend and go camping in the
Rockies.  Seeing Meat Beat Manifesto who just happened to be playing in Salt
Lake while I was there.  Going out to dinner and while on our way to one
place, stopping suddenly at an Indian resteraunt and deciding to go
there.....and while there, meeting a Rinpoche (high Lama) from Tibet, being
blessed and reminded of the importance of compassion for all sentient beings.

Well,Mark...... it just so happens that Krishna and I just moved ALL our
stuff (we need to have a garage sale!) up to Tahoe Tuesday-Wednesday.  We
might be going back Sat or Sun, so.... we could get you there but I don't
know about back.  maybe if someone else can drive you up and back you all
can crash amidst our boxes and board and hang with us.  So, let this be an
open invitation to (up to four more people only due to box/moving stuff)
anyone/anypeople who want to take Mark boarding  :)  Maybe we could do a
dinner at our place?

You are SO sexy when you beg.... yum ;)

Hi,

This is Thomas, SDream's hamsta.  I regret to inform you that SDream met
with a horrible fate: he has stopped partying.  Yes, sad, but true. 
See, it seems that there was this picture taken of him being smooched by
a girl.  The smooch itself wasn't a big deal, but it was a very hot and
humid rave, and neither were wearing shirts. Said picture found it's way
into his girlfriend's hands.  His girlfriend had only having been to a
couple of parties with SDream, both of which were not so hot that people
were shedding clothing, before she decided that raving was not her gig. 
She flipped.  To head off any possible break-up, SDream had to swear off
raving.  The hamstas helped him pack up his funky hats, his rave album,
his flyers, etc., and put them in a large box up in his closet.  Now he
listens to his tapes and wishes...  He values his relationship with his
girlfriend very much, and would rather she didn't feel threatened, so he
stays away from the parties.

Rumor has it though that she has seen a difference in his demeanor since
then (he seems older?) and may be pressuring him to go to one again, so
who knows?  

Me and the other hamstas are still throwing raves in SDream's study, but
we're a little more underground about it.  We had too many uninvited,
non-vibey squirrels showing up.  Our rave scene goes through phases that
way.  Most squirrels are cool, but you get these ones that just put out
a scarey, tough-rat vibe.  Some rodents just don't get it...  And we
always invite SDream.  Sometimes he comes in and dances, and you can
tell he really misses it.

Anyway, for those of you who wonder what happened to SDream and why he
doesn't show up anymore, that's why.  He raved his brains out for a
year, but had to make a sacrifice for someone he really cares about.

Thanks for your time,

Thomas Covenant Hamsta, esq.

I thought this might be of public interest so I am posting it publicly.

I use a package called procmail available on most UNIX platforms. If you
are using a UNIX shell and have procmail available create a file called
.forward in your home directory like:

"|IFS=` `&&exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f-||exit 75 blkadder"

and replace blkadder with your user name. The placement of the quotation
marks is crucial. Also the procmail program may not be in
/usr/local/bin/procmail. You can find out where it is on most platforms by
doing a "which procmail" or "whereis procmail" which should tell you where
it is located, and is what you would replace the /usr/local/bin/procmail
statement above with.

Then, create a file named .procmailrc in your home directory like:

# .procmailrc

PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
LOGFILE=$HOME/log
SHELL=/bin/csh

:0:
* ^Sender:.*sfraves
* ^From:.*Foo Bar
/dev/null


where Foo Bar is the name of the person who you do not wish to receive
mail from. The beautiful thing about this is that you never see the mail,
it just silently goes away. 

Procmail can do a lot more than this, but this is the easiest way to
implement a killfile with it.

If you are using a PPP account, using something like Eudora Pro is
probably your best bet. It is much easier to set up as opposed to all this
UNIX-weenie stuff.

     Well...
     
     There was a time when cocaine was the drug you did casually, and acid 
     and pot were for fuckups (and the BeeGees were the b*o*m*b).  Now it's 
     cocaine that's for fuckups, while some of my partying friends do LSD 
     somewhat regularly.  If somebody wants to put something in their body, 
     let em.  I don't care if it's cocaine, ketamine or John Holmes.  
     Personal liberty is weird that way.  It's not for me to decide what is 
     right for you.  The safest drug tends to be going sober, but it's not 
     for everyone all the time.
     
     As for the scene, I think it's a good general rule to consider raving 
     as "going out".  Don't do large amounts of GHB or get piss drunk, 
     don't use dissociatives at parties that might get busted because 
     passed out, immobile, incoherent people suck in that circumstance.  
     But in your own home... shoot all the smack, smoke all the crack you 
     want.  Just don't croak or get sick... we like you and we'd hate to 
     read about you in the paper.
     
     Determining which drugs should and shouldn't be okay is about as fair 
     as deciding which people should be tried as witches in early Salem.
     
     I think we should work on enforcing laws that punish harmful 
     behaviors, not alternative lifestyles.  Perhaps if all drugs were 
     legal we could address some of the real problems.  It would be really 
     hard to have to steal for drugs if they were cheaper, which they could 
     be if they were legal.  Drug dealers wouldn't have turf wars, because 
     they'd have no money except what they make from pimpin and stealin, 
     and nobody supports their pimp or their fence like they do their drug 
     dealer.
     
     But the argument goes on...
     
     Peace,
     AndyW

     Well... a lot has happened.  I joined the list and started partying 
     out here.  Been to parties before in Utah and LA, but only midway this 
     year did I start getting to the good stuff up here.
     
     10.First time really 'getting off' on E at Promise.  Lying with my 
     head in a new friends lap, as her friends all find me pretty funny/or 
     cute because they're all giggling as they bring me stuffed animals and 
     toys.  Most spoiled rotten moment of my life...
     
     9. Attending St.John's Divine Rhythm Society.  Dancing in a church to 
     house when I most needed it (I had OD'ed on trance & goa a half month 
     earlier) was pretty divine in my book.  Thank you to everybody who 
     invited me to an UG party... it's most appreciated.
     
     8. DJ Random's set at Elevation in LA.  Tacky, sloppy, almost clubby 
     music, but the guy knows how to spin at a party.  Had the crowd the 
     whole time, and whipped em all over the place.
     
     7.  Cloud Factory's Planetarium.  After having six thousand things go 
     wrong with the newbies I brought, they finally went to sleep.  I went 
     to see what was going on at the top of the hill by myself and caught 
     the best sets I've heard from Saben and Deaks then going into morning 
     at the little stage.  Freezing cold, amazing vibe, economy 
     pyrotechnics display at the BBQ, tired for weeks afterwards, but all 
     the way worth it.
     
     6. Juan Atkins at Space Children Three Year.  Amazing E, the Godfather 
     of Techno going off, my best friends from LA coming up to see me, and 
     my 25th birthday all in one.  Damn cool laser at that party... I don't 
     usually like lasers.  
     
     5. Meeting the really cool people from the bizarre booth at the back 
     of Freedom.  They were giving away stickers and had a blacklight.  
     That's about it.  Some of the coolest people I have ever met, and I've 
     been seeing them at parties on and off ever since.  I guess I'd have 
     to put meeting all the amazing people I've met this year here.
     
     4. The realization that a set can be anything the DJ desires at the 
     moment they pick their next record while listening to Brian spin at a 
     Moontribe.  The common thread doesn't have to be the sub genre of 
     music being played... it can be anything disco to minimal techno to 
     house to gabber to goa and be a great journey regardless.  The lines 
     we draw exist only because we draw them.
     
     3. Getting more involved.  Helping clean and setup at a couple parties 
     has been really rewarding, and an opportunity to really get to know 
     some of them smiling faces.  Even got offered to play a party... wee!
     
     2. All the mail list and mail list related events: BBQ & Beats, Monday 
     Night Dinner, Thursday Lunch, meeting all these list people.  Well and 
     those nice people that I always end up hooking up with too.  You're 
     all spiffy.
     
     1. Seeing the spirit of misfit power in it's purest forms time and 
     time again.  I keep remembering images of people...
     
          : a woman at a busted rave  gathering about twenty people 
          into singing and clapping techno (including a drag queen 
          making 303 growls) as the cops stood there staring
          
          : kids gathering around the car with the loudest stereo in 
          the parking lot after Blitzkrieg got busted shouting 
          hardcore! hardcore!
          
          : Energy Circles
          
          : Driving Crunchman's car past a forest fire as he's 
          tripping out of his gourd on the sky glowing all red and not 
          knowing where the hell we are and pretending to be confident
          
          : Waking up to a gabber set with my aching head practically 
          in the speaker at FNF (July).
          
          : Meeting someone who raves that speaks Polish (there is

hello all-

disclaimer: this message is not rave related in the strict sense, but it is rave related in my sense of the word, i.e. having to do with ravers.  besides, the people who flame me already have me in their kill files, already! =)

i'm going through the same shit in one of my vocal groups that sfraves is going through right now.  and i just want to say:  hey, it happens!  this group is growing, reforming, and changing, and who know's what the hell it will turn into.  i just know that i'm along for the ride, and i'm amicable to whatever sfraves, the living, breathing, organism that it is, becomes.

i know that it's not cool to say this anymore (but hey, i'm going for the kill file record!), but here goes:

i love you all!

later-

Dear Thomas Covenant Hamsta, esq.

Please tell SDream we Love him very much and very much notice his lack of
presence in the community.  It is unfortunate that his as yet uninformed
girlfriend was not able to see the beauty and freedom of raving before this
tragic incident, or at least get to see a hot, sweaty, can't stand it so I
gotta take my close off rave.  Let him know that I once quit skateboarding,
something that was very dear to me at one time, for a girl I loved.  Said
girl is now gone, and so is skateboarding.  (I did pick it up again, but it
was just never the same)  It still bums me out sometimes.....I was pretty
good at it ya know, and had a lot of fun doing it.  I guess it's all about
choices, and I hope this is the correct choice for optimum learning of
SDream's spirit.  Make sure he knows he is loved, and that I respect his
devotion to his loved one.  That much devotion is a truely beautiful thing.

Love 

Rick

 Suggestions -
1. Wait for Sunsets and outdoor parties to start up again, so she can 
   be there to "picnic" without having to be part of the action. She might
   even be seduced into raving!
2. Chastity belt.
3. Ball gag.
4. Have a shirt printed that says "Don't kiss me, I have herpes!" Promise
   to wear it at every party. Get photographic proof.
5. Have a photo of SDream being kissed by a shirtless guy ( umm, might
   make things worse... )

 Continue moping to a higher degree... 
6. Start dying individual hairs gray.
7. Sigh a lot in her presence. 
8. When she's around,  dance every time you hear "ravish" music , 
   especially during commercials. 

I hope these doesn't hurt ...

150-200bpm slamming hammer drums and people hollering and lots of samples
that are so horrifying, so shocking, they're comical. I can't for the life
of me take gabber seriously, but I like it. is it supposed to be take

not even going near this one... I can recognize breakbeat but I'll be

"goa" is the geographical name of a certain part of India where the goa

Ok, here are my highlights.  They are few, but they were grand:
-Stompy Cafe Jan 1, 1996.  "Uhhh, ok, lemme have some of that." 3:00 p.m.
"Damn, hwere was I for the past 5 hours?" 8:00 p.m.  Damn!  ABS in full 
effect (if you don't know, you're not supposed to!). ;)  I remeber seeing 
Alan Ameba, and  looking for my glasses.  I was told I had a great time, 
all smiles, with shades all  night.
-Stompy Cafe July 4, 1996. Took the S.O. out for our public debut.  I 
don't remeber too much, not even the after party at Johnny's, where I was 
told I had a great time smootchin the girlfriend, and sitting in a 
doorwell.  I was told I had a good time.  I didn't wear shades, but 
could't see.  I drank alot of booze, smoked alot of weed, and injested 
lotsa stuff.  All smiles, and I swore off substances.  Yeah right.
-Stompy in Octiober.  the music wasn't all that hot, but I was high.  
Time to go home, gather a group of friends, start to drink, get higher 
and spin some rekkids.  Statyed wrecked all day on Saturday, woke up on 
Sunday @ 8.  I am old, I cannot do this anymore.  From here on in no more 
"stuff" unless it is green and tokeable.  I hang up my psychedelic hat 
for the last time.  Stay tuned.  It was an OK partay, but eh music left 
plenty to be desired.  Saw Rawno, and a host of other motley characters.  
Matty chases Preston in a wig, classic.

The rest I dare not talk about.

Hey Rawno:  When in the fuck are you spinning again and where?  Lemme 
know, I want to hear you play sucka!

Peace,
John

I usually hate virus warnings on the list but since this ghost exe was
posted here I thought it should be posted.  I'm skeptical that simply
removing the file will remove the virus because infections occur when a
file is executed, not when it is simply sitting on your hard drive.

It has come to my attention that a rather nasty virus sent our around
Halloween may have been circulated  among AT&T Wireless Services
employees.

This virus is scheduled to detonate on Friday Dec. 13th.

If you did receive ghosts.exe delete it immediately.

FORWARDED MESSAGE FOLLOWS

Just to be on the safe side - make sure the original mail message is not
saved in your mail folders, if you forwarded it - check your sent items
folder, and do a search for ghost.exe on your hard drive.  If you
forwarded the message, let those people know, and so on ...

 ----------

Um, if any of you guys received the file with the flying ghosts and
witches
I sent to a bunch of people recently for Halloween, DELETE IT
IMMEDIATELY--meaning the ghosts.exe file. Apparently it is set to
destroy
your PC on Friday, December 13.

 ----------

Now that Halloween is over... everybody must remove the Ghost.exe file
from
their computers by December 12th.  If not this enjoyable trojan Horse
will
crash your files and system.  Up until December 12th, the Ghost.exe file
will
remain harmless.

The following message comes from another law firm.   I haven't verified
the
accuracy of  the information but due to the nature of the problems it
describes,  I feel it is in the firm's best interest to forward it on to
EVERYONE.  As it states, please delete both files if you have them and
inform MIS.  Also, if you have installed any unauthorized software
please
call MIS
for assistance in removing it.  Thank you for your cooperation.

     It has come to my attention that a couple of ghoulish visitors have
taken up residence on our network in the last week or so.  These
visitors,
one a
mouse cursor locator called EYES, and the other an animated screen
add-on
called GHOST.EXE, are both apparently harmless and very "cute".
 Actually, they are anything but harmless.

     EYES creates a serious drain on your PC's resources and will cause
system freezes and general protection faults on a regular basis.  This
may
result
in the loss of edits to documents or corruption of files that are open
at
the time your system fails.

     GHOST.EXE is a much more serious problem.  GHOST is a "trojan
horse"
virus which is scheduled to become active on the next Friday the 13th,
which
happens to be in December.  This virus will attack and delete
SERVER-based
system files and could potentially bring down the entire network.

     IF YOU ARE RUNNING EITHER OF THESE PROGRAMS ON YOUR PC, DELETE THEM
IMMEDIATELY.
     This situation highlights the seriousness of the problem we have at
 {firm name deleted} surrounding the unauthorized loading of software on
firm PCs.
 It is impossible for most users to determine if a game, screensaver, or
other software add-on poses a potential threat to the information
systems
at the firm.

Subject: Children of the Light: Rave Documentary

Let me begin by apoligizing for the cross-posting, and plead that any
discussion relating to this subject be mailled to me and kept in it's
perspective mailling list so as not to flood all US raving lists with
unwanted mail. If you want to skip reading all this just aim your
browser to:   http://www2.cybernex.net/~tranced/coftl/
All the information, developments and updates will be added to this
page.

with that said on to the topic:

Recently, our scene has been the attraction of a lot of negative press
and one sided bias portrayals by the mass media. This as always been an
issue within our sub-culture (among many others), but more so now, that
raves are getting bigger, and sparking up attention within the
mainstream. Personally I do not fear the growth and development of our
music and our scene as long as it is depicted for what it really is, I
do although fear the distorted and bias representation of what we really
are about... It is very disturbing to know that the evil many of us call
tabloid news shows as well as reputable news broadcast network stations,
have taken something that is so special to so many and twist it to
extended measures for ratings.=20

I will not deny that drugs are in part an issue within our scene, but I
find it highly disrespectful that the mass media choses to focus and
magnify this consequence, which is obviously out of reach of the
promoters hands anymore than inner city public school principals are to
blame for drugs inside their schools. =20

More so than any other music scene, whether it be rock-&-roll or
country, I have never been part of such a tight movement, but much like
any other musical culture, it is the expression within the techno beats
mastered by the talented DJ=92s that perform at these parties that bring
us together, as we all know. The DJ=92s are our rock stars, and raves are
our concerts. Just because it isn=92t a mainstream activity and it isn=92t
presented in the same format as other popular events such as concerts
(were you sit and listen to sound as opposed to letting it guide the way
your body moves), why should it loose its validity as a scene and a
culture???=20

Most news reports are only aiding the side of our scene the media
disapprovingly portrays, by tempting young kids to attend these parties
and do drugs. Most news stories are nothing more than negative
advertisements for who we are trying to exclude from our culture, those
whose sole purpose at these events is mainly to get their fix and have a
place to recover just in time to go back home. We within our own scene
are trying to combat the plague that haunts us, and it's bias media
reports that have turned something special into something
negative.=20

There as been much bickering and complainting on this issue both among
the net and outside as well. Many of us have responded to some of the
stations and program producers, and most to no avail. We can all just
sit back complaint and let things develop as they are either for the
better or worse, or we can take charge and try to do something with our
resources. There have always been negative depictions of our scene
through out most of it=92s existence, and some may think this doesn=92t pos=
e
an immediate threat to our culture, and there=92s no need to worry about
it. The difference now, is that our scene is rapidly and unavoidingly
rising. We have the choice to either let it escalate in the public eye
with the negative reputation it=92s been represented as, by the
pessimistic media, or we can use our means to present it for what it is,
and reveal that we are not just freaky teenagers looking for places to
invade and get drugged. During the last month, there have been several
mis-informed and terribly uneducated attempts to define the rave scene
within my area (New Jersey/New York), including a WNBC news report, an
American Journal story, among other ignorant rants on several prime-time
shows and News Channels. I have also been informed that many other local
news stations around the United States have been focusing and negatively
reporting the rave experience.=20

Me, along with a group of ne-ravers have decided to produce a
documentary video contrasting and combating the negative publicity
that=92s been degrading our scene as the =93new teenage trend known for its
open and accepted drug use=94 that has been depicted through many
wide-scale news stories Our sole purpose (or at least mine) behind this
project is to have something out there in the basic "media" format to
portray our scene for what it is, as seen by it's true participants as
opposed to what people on the outside perceive it to be...=20

As of now, I'm just trying to get footage of past events and start
laying down some kind of format or outline for the program. I'm hoping
that all footage and interviews necessary will be gathered and ready to
cut by around the end of Mosaic II (NE-RAVES party scheduled for middle
of February).=20

As of right now, I would just like some input and comments on creating
an outline.. The basic idea I have for the project is a professional and
journalistic look at the rave scene in general, covering all aspects
that make up our sub-culture, be it the music, drugs, the internet,
history, legalities and so on... and portray it in a positive,
educational manner..=20

And for any of you out there who have ventured into raves with your
video cameras and have some sort of rave footage, wether it be a DJ
spinning, someone comenting on the scene (you can even do this
yourself), or people dancing, and wouldn't mind sharing in exchange for
credit please e-mail me so we can work something out... I'd be more than
willing to exchange a blank video tape along with S&H charges for tapes
with footage, or if someone doesn't have access to 2 vcrs or any copy
equipment, I'd be more than glad to copy and immediatley return the tape
along with any other charges... Thanks :)=20

Everyone remember, this is a no-budget, no-profit project relying only
on the effort of those willing to contribute their labor, time, etc.. We
are following a couple of promoters around with our cameras as they
organize, prepare and throw a party as well as interviewing willing
attendees on their take of the rave scene. If you are a promoter or an
active member of your local rave scene, and are interested in
participating in this project, please e-mail for more information. We
are covering several parties here in the north east in the coming
months, but I would like extend the proposal and footage to the entire
United States in general. If you are throwing a party and/or attending
one in which you know the production staff, and wouldn=92t mind taping
some footage as well as interview some of your peers, promoters, local
authorities etc. and would like to be part of our team please e-mail me
for further discussion. Again, any contribution/opinion/constructive
criticism is welcome!=20

All we really need as of now is to gather up footage, work on a
narration, interview the right sources and get the thing cut... If you
have any footage or anything that could help or contribute to the
project I'd be glad to hear from you.=20

Remember, it is either up to the mass media to portray our scene as they
see fit to it=92s zombie-like audience who will never question their
sources, or it its up to us to inform and educate the mass public as
well as the media that our scene is not just another night out on the
town doing drugs and getting wasted...=20

If anyone knows of any current documentaries or related video tapes out
there please inform me???=20

Thank You
                                                   Daniel.Ferreira

Is there anything decent going on tonite, that isn't listed on the 
SFRaves calendar ? The response has been anemic.

Otherwise I'm headed to Endorphin, Jungle Love 
and/or whatever is going on at the Top. Any comments on these

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I have experienced the Plenum.  The Plenum would be a great place for a
party should one have access to said Plenum.  But knowone will be able to
throw a party in the Plenum so Rick is just pipe dreaming at this point.  Ya
see there's this building at the UCD Med Center in Sacto that has a
Plenum...which I experienced yesterday.  Old buildings have Plenums I am
told.  You are wondering what a Plenum is? No?  Well it seems that this
building has one centeral devise to move air throughout the entire two story
building.  This area has three gigantic fans (bigger than you and me put
together) in it that move the air throughout the building.  To get to the
Plenum you need a key to go through one door, then you must shut that door
because a Plenum has something to do with air pressure being greater in some
areas than others.  Then you open another door to an empty room with a
grated floor.  You have to shut that door as well....something about
pressure.  Then you go through a grated stair case in the grated floor down
to the sub/sub level.  This pipe dream of a party would truely be the
"underground."  In that room there is a big metal door that says "DO NOT
ENTER, OPEN BY PERMIT ONLY"   I asked what would happen if I opened that
door, and our escort said we'd be sucked into one of the fans and surely
parish.  This would add a sense of adventure to the whole party atmosphere,
cuz you could die.  That room wasn't very big anyway.  Then there was the
next room which was really big and had a huge fan (safely contained behind a
chain link fence) about 10 or more feet tall blowing air every which way.
The room was big, plenty big enough for a 100 person party.  And there was a
constant stream of air, not so strong as to blow you over, but you could
really feel it.  Then further back the floor raised up about three feet and
the room continued on for another 40 or so feet turned a corner and went
back another 50 feet.  A great big cubby hole chill space if you ask me.  I
could just see it.  Psychadelic lighting all over, and streamers and strips
of cloth attached to the walls, or sheets attached to the ceiling and walls
on one side so the other would blow in the wind.  I'm sure the sensation of
flying could be easily simulated.  Then music of course.  And 100 happy
raves raving in the Plenum.

Just a dream, thanks for listening.

Rick

Isn't this more of a New year's thing? But since I'm off to get video of
whales and volcanos in Hawaii over the break I'll look back now:

1) St. John Rhythm Soc events (all of 'em) Best joyful moment looking up and
  seeing Rachel dancing on the high alter... talk about dedicating a celebration.

2) New Moon at Goat Rock... wonderful outdoor beach celebration. Bonnie reminded
   me how good short hair feels... smiles all around.

3) Tribal Future ... the Ameba's rock - garden's of delight.

4) 3rd Year Harmony... I loved the ambient room and outdoor setting.

5) Light outdoor at the Berkeley Marina... what a way to change the seasons.

6) Gateway 4th of July campout... stars all around. dave abel woke up the forest
   with lights and lasers til even the trees were dancing... creeks help make
   for ambience.

7) Organic in LA ... band after band until Orbital live split my mind... I 
   resolved to play more e-music... inspired at 8000 feet.

8) Mad at the Bahia... what a way to hang out for a short evening..

9) Planetarium Campout.... when clouds float up to the mountain top watch out...
   The cloud factory makes things happen... looking forward to another.

10) Last but not least FnF where it all began (for me).... whenever you are
   blessed with a rainbow floating overhead in the morning you know the gang
   must have done something right....

 Rave culture-related topics mean in my mind everything that I communicate
with people and think about, regarding the future of humanity when I am in
an altered state at a high energy rave party.

Does this relate?

Allright, already.

I can c this is gonna be on of those discussions...

I'm not out to flame here, but simply clarifying my views on this topic...

Hmmm, u remember things differently than I do. This is all IMO, of course... I never 
thought the BeeGees were much of anything at all. :D I never thought acid and pot were 
for fuckups. ;-) I've only known two people in my 29 years of existence who were able 
to do cocaine casually.  Everyone else is who does it becomes an addict. It so happens 
that cocaine and herion and K are physically addictive drugs, whereas the substances, 
which I don't disapprove of, are not.  People may become mentally or emotionally 
addicted, but when they have to stop using them, by choice or otherwise, they don't 
start shaking, hallucinating, and spasmodically convulsing on the floor. :-O

I c your point on personal freedoms, however when people are going to expose their 
negative energy to a group, which is supposed to be about love, fun, happiness, good 
times and the like, I do care, deeply. Because it's not just what they are doing to 
themselves, they are affecting the entire group by their self-destructivity and bad 
vibes.

Burn the witch, burn the witch!!! ;-)

That's not where I'm coming from... I'm sure there are some exceptions to the rule. 
There are a handful of people out of a thousand who can have a good time and spread 
love and happiness, while they're all strung out on some barbituates and/or 
amphetamines. But, I have been around and I have seen a lot of stuff. It's not the norm 
and that's for sure. I had a friend in the Detroit area who, now, sells her body to 
support her herion addiction. She's lost all of her friends, her future as a school 
teacher and her health in general. All I know is that usually the aforementioned 
(junk), causes big health problems, physical addiction and bad vibes for everyone who 
is exposed to the individual "under the influence". Most psychedelics don't seem to 
have this effect, in fact from my experiences, the effect of psychedelics on a group is 
usually quite pleasing, as long as everyone maintains some sense of reality.

I pretty much agree with u here, except the law part. I think we need less laws and 
more conscience-motivated (pro-active) behavior regulation. I guess, that's pretty 
ideal. In a way, karma is gonna get u, anyway so who needs laws? Laws are only good for 
something after it's been done and it comes time to punish. Karma lasts a lot longer. 
But hey, we're only human and we do the best we can. It's discussions like this, that 
help us to grow and learn and at least consider other people's opinions...

Yeah and I'm right! (just kidding) ;-)

pluricity,

P.S. Even the guy in my quote below, got all screwed up on all kindsa bad stuff near 
the end of his life (27 years).  It's a shame, really it is -> mostly smoking, drinking 
and cocaine...

I think almost everything we do, in some way, realtes to tother things we 
do in life.  I mean partying/raving whatever, is just another extension 
of yourself.  So why shouldn't other aspects, even (yikes) spirituality, 
come into play at some point.  Same thing with socialization, etc.

I think also that since we live in such close proximity to the epicenter 
(which I consider SF to be when looking at the bay area), other things 
will come into play.  At times it will get muddy, but I think there are 
very few topics that don't relate.  Energy levels?  Sure why not.

It is all good, IMO, all good.

But as the great Marcus Mark was heard quoting "Everything in moderation, 
even moderation!".  Maybe applying this to all aspects of SFRaves topics 
might be a good idea.

Hmmm...I MAY even follow this example....naw, I don't listen to nobody.

Fuck off Marcus! ;)

Peace out,
john

P.S.  I think Markie was right on.

Audi.

It looks like I'm no longer on the list or something!  I haven't got any

something, but Jay says its still up and working.  Hmmm!  So I
re-subscribed to sfraves.

What have I missed?

I know I missed lunch.  That sucks!!!!!  Where did everyone go???


Warning: in need of love and energy from all on this list...

Last night I found out my fathers battle with cancer is going to be fatel.
He is really sick!  The cancer has spred and the doctors say its really
bad.  I guess the operation failed! =(

We don't know how long he has, but I really need some sort of support.  I'm
scared and emotionally out of it.  So tomorrow when we're all at "Freaky
People" I want us to dance real hard for my pop!  If anyone wants to write
me personal email about my father please do cause I'm not feeling to good
today.  I could use lots of hugs from you all.  And my father could use all
your energy!

Peace,

Noah

Why do I often get replies to messages before I get the original?  Does this 
happen to everyone from time to time, or is it just me?

Ramtin is probably going to do a live performance, (but I am not sure about
that)

Yeah, Ramtin is from Switzerland and his friend is a designer from Moscow who
was working in a very famous  rave club. He is doing design for this party,
but we don't have enough materials, so I don't think design is going to be
superb

I know people who are going to cool world, one who even stopped raving
becuase he felt and I quote "that my drinking and speed taking turned me 
into something not a raver" who are going becuase of that very
line...don't joke when you are advertisinbg an event for a flyer is the
first way an event's tone is set.

     If you live in or near Campbell/Saratoga/Los Gatos and would be 
     interested in something to do other than read your damn email, just 
     reply with the first line of this message intact to me (NOT 
     SFRAVES!!!), or call 408-378-0580 between the hours of 7:00pm and 
     midnight tonight (no later please!).
     
     If you don't get the email back with directions, it might be because I 
     just made this auto reply thingy, and it might not be working 
     correctly, or the I-net gateway is bogged down.  If so, just call.
     
     Peace,
     AndyW
     
     P.S. This is not a rave or even a party.  More like a coffee house but 
     with a DJ instead of a bad poet.  It is a small gathering and 
     opportunity to meet others and share thoughts and ideas.  I haven't 
     even bought chips and dip (the nerve!).  Read: Mellow... 
     
     I will be lovingly kicking everybody out at midnite.  If you're 21, 
     that still leaves you almost two hours of Velvet Shop (only minutes 
     away!), or some other clubby thang to let you dance your the 'weekend 
     is almost here' angst away.

Hey people.  Thanks so much for all the nice comments I found in my inbox
on my return to the Bay Area.  Totally cheered me up after a grueling week
at an annual convention for scientists.  I've been unsubbed, but I a
little birdie told me things have been more cheery on sfraves.  I hope
so!!  

Thanks again, you truly made my day!!

won't reach a lot of the people whoi have unsubscribed I do want to say
one thing though to those you are still here:  the only way we are going 
to get through this negativity is by continuing to communicate and not
unsubscribing or by trying (and maybe this is what needs to be done)
having the people who are having a problem meet in person, out of this
sometimes diificult to commmunicate medium, and hash it out in real deep 
discussion.  Some of my best times at raves have been in the ambient
room with  people I was feeling negative with.  Being in the rave
environment helped drop the fear and start the communication.  that is
what I have always liked best about ther social space of raves.

IMHO,
Cassandra

P.S. 
I wouldn't mind facilitating such a discussion if necessary now that
school is out of session.

     I am thoroughly interested by the post below. In the interests of 
poloitical correctness I believe that not wanting to have sex with an alien 
based on their (the alien's) planetary origin is an act of gross discrimination.
        Being a *resident* alien myself I would be greatly preturbed if anyone 
was squeamish about having sex with me based on my alien status. However, if the
person didn't wish to have a sexual encounter with this alien owing to the fact 
that I have two heads, two penises, eight arms and three buttocks thats another 
matter altogether.

        BTW, the (green) Orion slave woman from the opening sequence of the 
original star trek series is quite sexy. Discuss.

how about that sexy momma from the V mini-series... what was her name... 
the one they always alluded to a lesbian side with... but these are 
fictional characters...
  ... there is nothing more intense than an hermaphroditical experience 
with one of those tall tentatcled beasts from  the depths of atlantis... 
the ones that are a cross breed of Yetis and the giant Squid breed 
Australasiapolithicus Tentecalus.... oh their puckered orifices... 
slurping like a starving old mans face before a bowl of tapioca, while 
he's got his dentures out!... while the purple-brown tentacles thrill the 
WoMan in me like a thirsty dog drinking from his water dish...

goa trance has its origins with the band Ministry (yes, ie Alain 
Jourgenson)... ministry's second record (the first one was a pop sell-out 
to generate income for the record company and hence doesn't count) 
"Twitch" was produced before they introduced guitars into the equation... 
this LP spawned much of what became the new-beat movement (black turtle 
necks, industrial dance types) in Europe... when the likes of Darren 
Emerson (Underworld) among others started frequenting the beaches of goa 
as an inexpensive escape from Europe, the music fused with East Indian 
culture and the hippie culture that had fled to Goa from the fallen 
60's... full moon parties, eastern spiritualism, the aggressive driving 
beat borrowed from industrial (you can the origins of goa in Ministry's 
"over the shoulder") this was a crazy fusion if you think about it!  as 
goa got media attention, the locals seemingly cracked down every other 
year... so there were "on" years and "off" years... for the most part, 
the authorities were easy to pay off, and the parties went off without a 
hitch... recently with all the media attention in the club scene that 
goa's been getting, the scene is falling out there and many of the true 
"goa" parties don't even happen in india anymore... you would be better 
off visiting somewhere like Thailand... most goa is made in the UK and 
Isreal though, many of the artists having never been to india...
 
this is goa to the best of my knowledge.... word up to Neerav (canada's

"The President has kept all of the promises he intended to keep." 
 -Clinton aide George Stephanopolous speaking on Larry King Live 
     
     
     
     
   CAREER OBJECTIVES
     
     
If I ever become an Evil Overlord: 
     
1. My legions of terror will have helmets with clear plexiglass visors, not 
face-concealing ones.
     
2. My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through. 
     
3. My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept 
anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.
     
4. Shooting is _not_ too good for my enemies. 
     
5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the 
Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons of 
Eternity.  It will be in my safe-deposit box.
     
6. I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them. 
     
7. When the rebel leader challenges me to fight one-on-one and asks, "Or 
are you afraid without your armies to back you up?" My reply will be, "No, 
just sensible."
     
8. When I've captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you kill me, 
will you at least tell me what this is all about?"  I'll shoot him, and 
then say "No".
     
9. After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in 
a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks time during 
which the final phase of my plan will be carried out.
     
10. I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely 
necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled 
"Danger: Do Not Push".
     
11. I will not order my trusted lieutenant to kill the infant who is 
destined to overthrow me -- I'll do it myself.
     
12. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel 
well outside my borders will work just as well.
     
13. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to 
prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker 
enemies alive to show they pose no threat.
     
14. I will not waste time making my enemy's death look like an accident: 
I'm not accountable to anyone and my other enemies wouldn't believe it. 
     
15. I will make it clear that I _do_ know the meaning of the word "mercy"; 
I simply choose not show them any.
     
16. One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in 
my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.
     
17. All slain enemies will be cremated, not left for dead at the bottom of 
the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying 
celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.
     
18. My undercover agents will not have tattoos identifying them as members 
of my organization, nor will they be required to wear military boots or 
adhere to any other dress codes.
     
19. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other 
form of last request.
     
20. I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that 
such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the 
counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation. 
     
21. I will design all doomsday machines myself. If I must hire a mad 
scientist to assist me, I will make sure that he is sufficiently twisted 
to never regret his evil ways and seek to undo the damage he's caused. 
     
22. I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there's just 
one thing I want to know."
     
23. When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their 
advice.

Hey Everybody!!!

        I told Blake I would pass the word along: he has been UTTERLY
CRUSHED by the flu for several days, confined to bed and therefore 
separated from his Internet connection, and wanted to say "whassup" and 
"love all you" and "stay positive" and "keep on truckin'" and "icky-icky- 
icky paTAANG-zip-oingg!" and "BLARBLARBLAR"..okay so I made a few of 
those up.

        But seriously, he didn't sound too good. He could probably use
TONS of healing thoughts and energy from each and every one of you SFRave
All-Stars!

                                                Hugs :)

     At this time of year it is easy to succumb to the effects of 
     influenza, infections, the common cold and other nasty air-bound 
     viruses. The situation can be exacerbated by staying up all night in 
     draughty warehouses and not getting any sleep.
     I recommend the following : Eat well, take your vitamins (especially 
     your C and B's), stay away from Billy whizz and take lots of rest at 
     the first sign of coming down with something.(Also, be careful where 
     you put your tongue) Remember the free clinics : Haight Ashbury, 
     Clement, 50 Ivy street in the Tenderloin. 
     
     Wish someone gave me this advice last week. (cough cough splutter..)

When I went to the Mac World convention in San Fran
2 years ago, I stayed at the Marriot and a group called
Pure Ecstasy played in the bar area on the top floor.

My friends and I laughed about the group's name, wondering
what they might play  ;)  They ended up playing (live, not records) 
soul and some funky stuff, if i remember correctly.

all in all, it was fun... even though they didn't play
any techno...  =)

hi all:

a few people have sent me notes saying they can't get it, and i realized
that i'm broadcasting from our new server and the DNS change prolly hasn't
filtered throughout the world yet.  

i know sirius hasn't gotten it yet...

anyway, the real url is:

http://140.174.242.150/x-radio/test.html

i'm brodcasting at a relatively low frequency response so i don't
_completely_ soak my modem line.

good luck,
p.

I've never posted before, so I hope this works!  I just had to respond to
this letter, though.  I read this cookie story before in a book of urban
legends by a man named Jan Harold Brunvand.  I believe he's a professor
of mythology and folklore at the University of Utah.  Apparently he's
been collecting stories like this one for several years, and he's written
four books:  The Vanishing Hitchiker, The Mexican Pet, The Choking
Doberman, and Curses! Broiled Again!

Urban legends are false stories that are circulated by word of mouth
around the world.  There are variations of every story.  In fact, Jan
Harold Brunvand lists most of the variations in his books.  The one I
read was not about Neiman-Marcus cookies, but about Mrs. Field's.

So, no, it's not a true story, but the recipe's still good! ;)

have going on now, but I little more.  Not everyone will agree, but that's
whats so great. We will get a chance to see what everyone likes and
dislikes.  And remember, these are all personal opinions, you don't have to
agree, just respect there opinion.


1. Best party you went to in 96?

2. Worst party you went to in 96?

3. Best local DJ for 96?

4. Best Non-local DJ for 96?

5. Best record for 96?

6. Worst record for 96?

7. Best mixtape for 96?

8. Worst mixtape for 96?

9. Best track for 96?

10. Worst track for 96?

11. Favorite location for a party in 96?

12. Least favorite spot for a party in 96?

13. Favorite thing to do after a party in 96?

14. Favorite thing to wear to a party in 96?

15. The most you ever spent in one night at a party in 96?

16. If you can change one thing about raving in 96, what would it have been?

17. What the best DJ name in 96?

18. Worst DJ name in 96?

19. Best name for a party in 96?

20. Worst name for a party in 96?


That should keep everyone busy and thinking.

Went to the jungle thing at the Trocadero last night and wow!  what a fun
thursday night.  Got there at around 10:30 and the place was pretty sparse,
but by 11:30 the floor was populated with people funking out to Star Eye's
set.  The Troc has a great system and it is a thrill to feel those jungle
beats vibrate your insides.  The vibe was friendly and mellow, something
I have not experienced in either the Troc or 1015 for awhile.

A few reasons I like jungle:

1.  Its a music scene.  People are into jungle because they dig the sound
of it.

2.  Its very dynamic.  Jungle never gets boring.  Its always right there
in your face.

3.  You can explore many more different dancing styles with jungle.  You can
mix up moving to every beat, then every other beat, and generally twisting
your body all around.

4.  After 2 hours of jungle, it feels like you have been dancing all night
to regular trance!

Support your local jungle scene,
-troy

Well, it IS nearing New Year's Resolution time...  Just in case any of us
suddenly gets an Evil Empire (tm) for Christmas, thought I'd share this:

Smiles,
     Chin

>> If I ever become an Evil Overlord:
>>

>>     Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box.

>>  6. I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.
>> 
>>  7. When the rebel leader challenges me to fight one-on-one and asks, "Or

>>     "No, just sensible."

>>  8. When I've captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you kill

Whoops!  I just got Claran's Evil Overlord post about
ten minutes after I sent mine...  and it's dated 
yesterday!  *@&%in mailer...  I notice that sometimes
I get mail a day or two late, and often get replies to
messages before the messages themselves.  Does this
happen to other people?  

Anyways, sorry about the (accidental) spam!

Here at work, 5 hours after getting back from Jungle Love and 
whatever was going on at the Top.

THURSDAY THE 12TH of DECEMBER: JUNGLE LOVE AND THE TOP

Jungle Love was pretty kool, although the lack of people contributed 
to the corresponding lack of vibe. Wasn't exactly dead, but far from 
jumpin'. The dj's were pretty good, although this D&B stuff takes a 
little getting used to with all of the bridges/drops where the drums 
and bass stop and a unsettling silence or melody takes over for up to 
30 secs. As for the club itself, the lights were a bit annoying - all 
night, non-stop UV+white light intellibeams roaming all over the 
place - most noticeably in your eyes, where you stood. The drinks 
were stiff, though and the staff was pretty mellow. The three buck 
cover was definitely well spent.

Next stop was the Top at about 1:00am, which pretty much defined cozy 
- which equals 
dead if you're looking to shake your money maker. About 20 people all 
snuggled up with one another and not a soul on the dance floor the 
entire time we were there, which admittedly wasn't much more than 45 
mins. However, a tremendous bright spot was the free beer the barman 
sent our way - apparently he poured the wrong one and gave us the 
ale. Not an ale man myself, but it was free and cold. The staff was 
way kool (free beer!) - the cheery doorman promised to recognize us if we 
wanted to come back so we wouldn't have to pay the $2 cover - it 
wasn't going to be a difficult task given the traffic. It looked like 
it had potential, but Thursday night at the Top was defintely a dud. 

So we headed back to Jungle Love and got down to the funky 
jungle/breakbeat/D&B/whatever sounds until it started to die. Then it 
was off to Chinatown for a little early morning BBQ pork and beef egg 
rice. Buts that's a different story!

Endorphin gets a dishonorable mention. After reading their flyer 
which stated people with invites before 10pm get in for half price 
($5 instead of $10), i thought i'd call them up and see what exactly 
was an invite and how do i get one. So i'm talking to the guy who 
answered the phone and he tells me that, no, the flyers aren't 
invites, no, they don't have invites at all for this party despite 
what the flyer said and yes, i'd have to pay the $10 cover. Ouch! ten 
bones for a rainy thursday night ? Maybe i'm still living in the past 
or maybe Endorphin was the party of the year - If anyone was there, 
i'd like to hear wha'ppend!

 Well, seems to be an Internet "feature" - I guess it has to do with

If money was no object? hmmm.
for sound I would take mark wanes(e.a.r.) full sound system and place 
it in the center of this perfect space(come on, use your imagenation!)
in a complete circle.(360 sound!) The dj would be on a scissor lift
in the center of it all. Mark and I actually talked about this a 
couple years ago. I dont think it would work because of feedback and
it would be hard to switch djs without the needle skipping. but
if money was no object I could hire any dj I liked and lock them
at the top for 6 hours.("here is some water and food, see ya in the 
morning!)

[ to sfraves ]
Tim (knucklehead) put out this question: 
> If you can throw a party and money was no object, what would you do and
> have that you never saw at any other party before?

here's my attempt at some suggestions

( Some of the things I suggest below are not so much "never saw" things
  as "very rare" things ) 

1. Chill/non-dance music rooms with perfect sound isolation from the 
   dance rooms!
2. A full-up medical team with a 100% legit personelle.
3. A seaside site that gave people the option of indoor ( warm/dry )
   or beach ( fresh air/nature ). 
4. Smiling security!
5. Free smart drinks and sports drinks.
6. Free keyed lockers to hold your personal posessions, right next to the 
   dancefloor.
7. Water fountains right next to the dancefloor.
8. Showers with soap, shampoo, and towels !
9. Clean, polished wooden floors. 
10. Places to sit near the dancefloor and talk/yell at your friends, or
   just to rest your feet for awhile.
11. Free earplugs.

 That's it for now ..

     Thank You to all that showed up at my house last night.  I had a great 
     time and hopefully all in attendance did as well.  It feels good to 
     open your house to nice people who really seem to appreciate it.
     
     Sorry though about:
     
     A. Getting the post out late (I haven't even gotten it back from 
     SFRaves yet...)
     
     B. My mail being bogged down.  Turns out coworker decided last night 
     was high time to send a mail with 50 attachments totaling 34mb last 
     night.  So our puny link was kinda choked for a while.
     
     C. Even thinking about getting automated e-mail directions to work 
     with the above two conditions in place.
     
     Tim, thank you very much for  spinning (you got that little system 
     going!), as well as everybody who stepped up after Tim left (some damn 
     tasty goa flavored goodies all around)... details are really blurry 
     though.  I can still hear the faint static of brain cells moving back 
     to their original pre-altered locations.  Funny how I get that way 
     sometimes... 
     
     See you all at Freaky People!!!  I hope I get to take a nap beforehand 
     though... *ughmyhed*.  Two jobs and weeknight indulging can make your 
     skull's contents feel pretty unspunky.
     
     Peace,
     AndyW

more in the vein of Monty's list of memorable moments from this year, my
top ten list would read something like this :

* Aires ((w/ Garth + Mark E Quark)) crazy fucking CIA front party on
Market & 6th, compleate with bogus painters to throw off the cops and
street traffic. never seen a party like that before or since.

* being uninspired at the Pt. Molate FnF party untill the storm comes tru
and Mother Nature starts tearing shit up. danced through the rain and hail
untill the bitter end. didn't even get a cold afterwards.

* while waiting for the bus on Market, crazy fucking homeless guy charges
me and goes, "*you* saved my life in Nam ! i thought that Charlie had us
for sure ! here's my lucky dog-tags !" and then he bolts. this being only 
1 of many random unsolicited weird-shit happenings that have either been
thrown my way or that i have found myself throwing at other people this
year.

* first Sunset of '96, the one that was moved from Dog Shit Park to Pt.
Molate.

* for the 2nd time in as many years, finding myself spending almost the
entire day of the Haight St. fair just head-tripping in Ameba.

* driving Sun & Dave Foust 5 hours to a Sacramento mountain retreat party
that Dave was to spin at. make the last 2 miles on pure fumes alone. being
1 of 5 people to dance at the 75+ person party and thinking to myself,
"there sure are a lot of dancers in San Francisco." having to steal most
of the generators gas to get out of there come morning. 

* the Twilight Zone acid

* showing up at 2pm to help set up at the August FnF party. swept a floor,
hung a banner, and did not much else. listening to Ethan and others give
hippy-isk speaches to the troops and for some reason not feeling the
natural urge to make some sarcastic comment. end up staying till noon the
next day. takes a week for my lips to heal after that night.

* while playing frisbee by Hippy Hill, accidentlly tag this sketchy
drifter type. almost get shot that day. 

* somehow driving people from Berkeley Marina to Pt. Molate to catch
Garth's set during that raided Sunset.

* Dave, Sun, Nick, Michelle, and i taking the magic bus to Burning Man.
spending saturday night feeling like a cross between Lawarance of Aribia
and Charles Manson. come morning, seeing Kevin for the first time in 6
months at Wicked and beeing offered free DMT. for some reason turning that
offer down...

* 818 Divesadero, World Headquarters.

* working on the prop 215 party and seeing Peter Pan.

* Freaker's Ball 2 : Kevin's party in Santa Cruz. naked teenage acid
casualities attacking cars and other inanimate objects in the parking lot,
breaking into homes and bleading all over cops. for some reason the party
continues ...

* getting a new lucky hat.

* going home for the corporate holidays and getting a $20 rave ticket and
mushrooms for my birthday from my kid sister.

* feeling young and immortal and ending up puking for 5 hours straight on
the last sunset boat party. learn something about restraint that day.

* while walking to Roots, stumble across a huge stuffed teady bear that
one of my neighboors is tossing out. decide to show the bear a night out 
on the town. getting weird looks from cops and having girls in wheelchairs
asking me and the bear to help them across the street. the more i think
about it the more i decide that i really like having Roots around. it's no
psychadelic orgasm of epic proportions, but it's more like a good night of
bowling. girls i don't know are giving me a back rubs, Poppy even
comes over and talks to me and the bear for about 10mins. that was cool. 

*  being surprised by the large crowds of people and the large
number of absentee raver superheros at this year's last sunset. the next
day, Kevin and i get up at 4:30am to be extras in some added scenes for
Return of The Jedi. meeting other Burning Man survivers and aspiring
jungle DJ's there ((whassup Dena)). 

* graduating from The State ((next week)) with my BA in video production.
using that to land a job as a copy clerk in a downtown legal firm. score
one for higer education -

* developing meaningful drug relationships, making friends and a few
enemies, dancing more, being high, being in love, being stupid, being
alive -

room one:

full concert-block jbl sound sytem place in four corners... pretty much a 
separate system in each corner...

the mixer:  a cloud mixer... capable of separate channel eqing, panning 
and two FX sends per channel... divide the mixer into four rails (volume 
control) per turntable (four turntables of course) so you could control 
where in the room the sound traverses... assign each rail to a corner...

then hire Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Algorhythm... whoever could handle 
it-- to play... where you stood in the room would depend on where you 
were in the mix...


room two:

40 cerwin vega bins, 30 JBL full range cabs

Derek Carter, Mark Farina, Stacy Pullen, Andrew Rawnsley

four turntables, cloud mixer... wall-stereo sytem to push that bass to 
its max...


room three:  outdoors

blue room speakers on a 50,000 watt system... hung from trees, hiding in 
shrubs, etc etc...

GOA:  Guy Sebbag (isreal), Goa Gil, Neerav (montreal), Eat Static LIVE, 
Infinity Project LIVE,Infinite Wheel LIVE, Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia LIVE


room four:  in a bunker type basement room


drum+bass:  full JBL system, overkill on bass... 4 corners

DJ phantasy, Photek LIVE, Squarepusher LIVE, Subtropic LIVE, 
 David Kristian LIVE, Mixmaster Morris, Jonah Sharpe (DJing)



room five:  in a steam bath facility, with lots of foam cushioned floors

turbosound... eight stacks set about the room with a sound spatializer 
running each frequency band in an infinity symbol around the floor...

Chris Meloche LIVE, Cosmic Trigger LIVE, Irrestible Force LIVE...



i digress...


if anyone has a large trust fund or 7 digit bank account figures and 
would like to invest, contact me...


so on and so forth...

     well,, it might be nice to rethrow FOUNDATION, which was at 8th and 
     Gilman in Berkeley in the summer of 1993.  only thing is i would put a 
     little more air conditioning in there.  one room, one sound system, 
     one vibe.  :)

I would have sensors all over the dance floor and cameras on the ceiling
that were feeding environment information to a cray supercomputer that was
processing the mood and reaction of the crowd to the environment and
adjusting the environment suitably. The supercomputer would be  able to be
set to super-cheesy-happy mode, where its goal is to build <us> into a
super-cheesy-happy vibed party, or spiritual setting would take us on that
vision quest...also, anyone that wanted to could wear a suit of some sort
that was taking biological readings (EEG's etc) as to your personal
response to the environment and adjusting accordingly. 
	the dj would be more than a record spinner...the dj is completely
wired into the ultimate music processing machine, with a glance and a
thought the dj spins that new record, throwsthe base line into effects
processor 12, and the synth line into effects processor 9, removes to
vocals and samples the dancers exstatic clapping response  in real time
and feeds that back into the mix...

Okay you all will think I am crazy and a little out there.  I would have a 
party outdoors in the mountains, and at one point, a group of whoever 
wanted to participate would take a little hike into the woods (preferably 
a clearing).  In our group, we would all concentrate and by using CSETI 
protocols (Center for the Search of Extraterrestrial Ingelligence) we 
would vector in an ET ship.  Don't you think a close encounter of the 5th 
kind would make a rave to remember??  Not to mention the incredible 
visuals it would provide. ;)

yea, I'm obsessed...

        Being an employee of the trocodero usually means putting up with
evil drunks, bad music, and way too much misplaced sexuality.  Not to
mention the notoriously aggro security (that are normally on my side), or
the tweeky management.  As lighting designer/operator, I get a unique
perspective of the club, and see things there that sometimes go completely
unnoticed.
        Thursday night was different in many ways, the music was great!
Thanks Star Eyes for the wonderfully inspiring set.  ::hug::  The vibe was
there, not too much negative nastiness.
        Unfortunately some things remained the same...  I watched one
?security? guard elbow someone as he was passing by, and witnessed some
(though not horrible) management attitude.  Can these problems be resolved?
Could a $25.00  cash incentive keep the security friendly???
        On the tech side of things, the equipment was not happy...  The fog
machine, and video projector both died, and three of the seven intellabeams
were down for most of the night...  =(
        Overall I thought it was a great event, and I'm looking forward to
the next one, on January 23.  Feel free to find your way up to the lighting
booth and say hi, it gets lonely up there...  =)

        Thanks again!                   ::hugs::

        e

Rent the Altavista Blimp.

...and have it travel around the country picking up and dropping off
ravers.  Need a break?  Camp out in Kings Canyon until it comes by
again.  Need your Ethiopian food or some funky clothes?  Get off at the
GG Panhandle stop.  Every so often the route culminates in a massive,
held in the Moffett Field blimp hangar.  Just imagine the laser shows.

Raygun and I have solved the problem for ourselves:

Don't go to the Trocadero. I know that we miss some good shows, but we had
it to here(mental picture not included, some assembly required) with the
asshole security and management there about a year ago, and haven't been
since.

The only way to effectivly stop this type of treatement is to stop giving
them your money.

Hi =

Just wanted to comment on the dance music scene.  I have been producing mus=
ic =

since the early days of Hip Hop.  In the mid 80's in LA we were having litt=
le =

dances at various venues.  Break dancing was the shit, and groups like Newc=
leus, =

Africa Bambaataa, Herbie Hancock ('Rockit'), Egyptian Lover etc. provided t=
he =

tunes.

LA had dance venues all over, and you could hear a variety of all the dance=
 styles =

including European electronic music (Kraftwerk etc.) besides Disco, etc.

There is very little in modern dance music to distinguish much from the mus=

ten or 15 years ago.  While newbies want to argue the differences of variou=

genres (Jungle, Rave, House, Acid & etc.) and various idiots try to proclai=

demonstrate their ignorance and recent climbing on the bandwagon.

To a veteran like myself it's all Hip Hop,  from Electro to House to Jungle=

experimentation and evolution.

While debates rage over "Is Techno Dead?" to "Will commercialism ruin the =

scene"  the same thing was going on before most of you were born.  Look at =
the =

Rock/Hippy culture.  The drug addled hippies of the 60's are now running =

corporations and government (Clinton?) and "We have met the enemy and it is=
 =

us..."

Can I speak with any authority?  I was making dance jams with the Fairlight=
 =

sampler in the early 80's before MIDI keyboards and sequencing existed (God=
zilla =

"P is for Party" 1984;  Blackbird Crew "Missle Man" 1984.)  I had barely he=

the Chicago scene but believe me the same shit was going on in LA and NY wh=

there were jumping music scenes with all the hottest dance jams from all ov=

The irony is that in the same sense that white people co-opted the Blues an=
d R&R =

from underground black music=8Bmodern wanna-be's are just recycling most of=
 the =

same conventions from Hip Hop, including sampling and speeding up old break=

beats.

So a new generation comes along ignorant of the past and rails about how "o=
ur" =

music is being corrupted.  People don't want to print R*ve like raves are a=
 dirty =

word=8Blike that "scene" is dead and now only newbies are into "corporate r=

Commercialism isn't "threatening to take over" it took over in the early pa=

'underground' music in the US is Top 40 in Europe, where even Jungle etc. i=

played on Top 40 stations.

Drugs have been around forever (since cave man days at least.)  Some people=

want to be totally straight, others want to experiment with substances the =

If there was any justice on this planet the people into psychotropics would=
 rise =

up and rebel against their fellow alcohol/tobacco/coffee addicts who restri=
ct =

our drugs of choice while they have theirs (besides theirs are nastier.)

It's history that the European underground dance scene merged out of a mixe=
d bag =

of hippies, punks, rockers, gays, straights, trippers, etc.  This music evo=
lved =

from the Hippy/Punk/Rocker drug scene and drugs have been a part of the gen=

just as in Disco, Rock, Blues, Jazz, and even County (Johnny Cash :) )

If you listen to all the drug references in early Swing music (Benny Goodma=
n, =

Count Basie, Billy Holiday, etc.) you will wonder how we all didn't grow up=

drinking cocaine laced Coca-Cola (it used to be in Coke=99  :)  )

Now I'm not advocating drugs for the masses and most kids would be better o=

It's cool that you wrote this review, Ed, because I felt like the entire
Troc staff were complete assholes - I stand corrected!!

I did have a great time regardless of the musclehead security walking
around being assholes (on the dance floor!)... but just one request - the
lights were starting to bother me by midnight, due to the fact that they
were constantly swinging around and catching me right in the eyes.  A
little more variety and less bright flashes in the lights would be great!

Just gotta say, props to Dropbeat records in Oakland and URB mag for
putting it on - great sets by all three DJs - and where's the Jungle on the
weekends???!

Junglistically,
Jonathan

     I would fly 1,000 partiers to the moon for a new years eve 1999 rave 
     on ice. Visuals supplied by Mother Earth lighting (un) incorporated. 
     Sound would obviously be a problem so  there would actually be ambient 
     music piped into everyones' space suits for the moon skate. 
     The main dance area would take place on all surfaces inside a  
     geodesic, hermetically sealed plexi glass dome and would be broadcast 
     live to earth.
     
     (Magnetic dancing boots are available free of charge for those that 
     wish to indulge in more traditional dance movements)

        I agree with Blackadder on that one. The security at the Trocadero are a
bunch of anal wankers.

Raygun and I have solved the problem for ourselves:
     
Don't go to the Trocadero. I know that we miss some good shows, but we had 
it to here(mental picture not included, some assembly required) with the 
asshole security and management there about a year ago, and haven't been 
since.
     
The only way to effectivly stop this type of treatement is to stop giving 
them your money.

guiltrip on you ;)

I want to bea Character in the FreakyPeople Story (to me, raves are like 
a story in which you are your own character) I want to be part of all of 
all of you tonight... I really need your help.


If someone can help me out with Ideas on what to do and such, please give 
me a page.
I'm in the Benicia area (707)550-2083, I might not get a car 'till 
midnight...so that is why I need to know what I can do in order for me to 
get to FreakyPeople. I do have other compromises from like 9 to 11 or 
so....but I can't bail out on those. I need help. please?

        Yeah the gear was in pretty bad shape...  I really only had 3 or 4
programs to work with...  They have been trying to get the gear working for
weeks.  Last month there were only two intellabeams.!.!.!   With 3 light
techs constantly writing over everyone else's programs, it is nearly
impossible to gather a set that works well...  sucks!  Fog also tends to
make them much less blinding...
        I hate to have to apologise for someone else's equipment not
staying properly maintained, but the troc tries to put as little cash as
possible into thier equipment, and as a result it constantly dies.
        I totally know what you're saying though, hopefully next month
everything will be functioning properly...  But knowing the troc, it is
very possible that it won't....   =(

        Nice to get an "old skool" perspective, but remember "it ain't
where ya been, it's where ya at."
         The reasons that dance music has remained underground in the US
for so long is a) the music industry SUCKS. b) Americans are too
conservative in their approach to music, hence the 7 or 8 year lag behind
European (especially UK) styles. The music originates here, is picked up by
savvy Europeans, developed and mutated, then gets sold back here years
later. The ones who lose out are the originators. Happened in the '50s,
'60s, '70s and '80s.
        Also, hip-hop is only one of a myriad of styles of the past which
went into the melting pot that is '90s dance. NY disco ala
Levan/Kevorkian/Sleeping Bag Records, electro from Detroit (Cybertron aka
Juan Atkins) and LA aswell as NY, '70s Jazz-Funk-mutated into Nu Funk in
the UK in the early '80s, Georgio Moroder, and the almighty Kraftwerk's
back catalogue (without which there would be NO TECHNO, ask anyone in
Detroit) all point us in the direction of mid '90s dance music. Less
obvious, but certainly integral are people like Steve Reich, Brian Eno,
Stockhausen, and many other electronic and minimalist pioneers who
championed texture and rhythm (the mainstays of all innovative '90s dance)
YEARS before it was even remotely hip. Add to this rock bands like Talking
Heads, Can, Tangerine Dream, Pink Floyd, the psychedelic era outfits, and
African juju (King Sunny Ade), Joy Division (and archytypal electronic
DANCE band) and things become even more blurred.
        Sadly though hip-hop was once a magnificent and innovative beast,
what has become of it? The music biz really put it thru the ringer, huh? So
much for the positive vibe it had back in the day. It has become merely a
cliche of itself, much like contemporary R&B, heavy metal and punk.
        I've been doing this "dance thang" for years now (though I'd hate
to call myself (old-skool") and one of the things that amazes me is how
little musical background and history people have. Sometimes you've gotta
go backwards for a while, to go forward. Even so, there ain't no better
place than RIGHT NOW. And right now means a summation of all that has gone
before, with an eye and an ear on the future.
Respect,
Andrew R

Well, it's timely that you ask that question.  Though we're not really 
 doing a party but a celebration of prayer/meditation/visualization and 
 dance based around the GaiaMind project, it'll be free and we're in 
 the midst of planning it with others.  Read below and come join us to 
 see what transpires when money is not the object.

Evolution - A Celebration of Life
---------------------------------------
On January 23rd, 1997, the Evolution Collective is facilitating a free 
 Bay Area gathering for the GaiaMind global meditation and prayer.  
 Evolution gatherings are a forum for relation, creation, and 
 manifestation integrating ritual, movement, and rhythm.  We invite you 
 to contribute to the realization of this goal.   For more info, call 
 415.908.6717.

GaiaMind Global Meditation and Prayer
January 23, 1997
9:30am - 9:35 am PST

Imagine people all over the world sharing a moment of meditation and 
 prayer, a moment of unified global consciousness when people from the 
 world's many diverse spiritual traditions simultaneously focus 
 attention on our interconnected relationship with Gaia--the living 
 earth.  Each persons brings love, compassion and understanding to 
 embrace the possibility of healing the social, ecological and 
 spiritual challenges before us.  As we approach the interdependence, 
 we may choose to join together as a global community in such a moment 
 to catalyze planetary transformation by both envisioning the light and 
 facing the darkness of our times.

On January 23, 1997, there will be an exceedingly rare and archetypally 
 appropriate planetary alignment, a moment in time express in the 
 heavens as a perfect six-pointed star.  This pattern comes on the 
 exact day that three outer planets, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune are 
 cojoined together for the first time in almost two hundred years.  Not 
 since the Renaissance have all five out-most planets been so 
 harmoniously arrayed.  On January 23rd, this cluster of planets will 
 center on the first degrees of Aquarius, joined by the Sun, with the 
 Full Moon opposite them all.

The geometric perfection of this pattern serves as a symbol of a unique 
 moment of opportunity, a day on which people all over the world may 
 come together to participate in an intentional expression of the 
 emergent unified planetary consciousness--to affirm that we are all one.

Participation is simple.  On January 23rd, meditate, pray or do 
 whatever brings you into closer contact with the Divine for five 
 minutes starting at the local equivalent of 9:30am PST.  Then, at 
 9:35am PST, join in a minute of focused visualization.  White light 
 seems to be the most universal spiritual archetype, so we suggest 
 envisioning white light in unison as a way to bring ourselves into 
 resonance at the moment the astrological star pattern become exact in 
 New York City.

In addition to the simultaneous global meditation and prayer, many may 
 choose to celebrate the moment when this pattern in the heavens become 
 exact at their own unique place on the Earth.  The alignment pattern 
 will sweep around the plane over 24 hours like a vast relay race in 
 consciousness, perfecting sometime between noon and 1pm across each 
 time zone.  The easiest way to find the precise time for your location 
 is to have an astrologer cast a chart with four degrees Gemini rising 
 on January 23rd at your latitude and longitude.  Astrologically, this 
 particular date represents the first of a series of exceedingly rare 
 multiple conjunctions in the first degrees of Aquarius spanning 
 several weeks.  Archetypically, the major planets involved represent 
 the benevolent expansion of spiritual liberation.

Your help is crucial to spread awareness of this opportunity to 
 catalyze the transformation of global consciousness.  By sharing this 
 information with others in your community, you will help ensure this 
 is truly an international event.  Please photocopy and distribute this 
 flyer to anyone who might be interested.

If you can throw a party and money was no object, what would you do and
have that you never saw at any other party before?

Just wanted to drop a personal line to Tony and say THANKS  for throwing that 
schwa party last weekend.  It really "hit the spot", exactly!  I had tried to 
go to a party on Friday, but ended up driving a friend all over the city 
looking for her boyfriend. Saturday, I got a flat trying to get to F-8 to buy 
tickets to Karma, got there and it was sold out, but a couple kids on the 
street had two extras (thanks!).  Then, ten minutes after getting to Karma, it 
was busted. Went to 6th and Mission, went in, and was told that street cleaning 
was that night, so I should move my car. Very thoughful. Then, went on an 
errand and bought a little JD for the guy groovin in  his wheelchair. Finally, 
danced danced danced danced.  So much pent up energy was released, It  felt 
truly amazing.  

The party was great, a very diverse crowd: gay and straight, a couple folks in 
wheelchairs, and a slightly older crowd (which is nice to see every now and 
again for us old ravers [scenesters?]!).  Brought a newbie there, and she had a 
great time!  It was really interesting to ask here on the way there what her 
expectations were, and then afterwards what she thought of it. Anywayz, 
hopefully will see y'all at Freaky ppl tonight, but I'm a little hung over from 
a crazy xmas party at the Cal. Culinary institutes. Adios!!!!!

        The bay area is racially and culturally diverse. I want to see this more
        in the parties i go to. If it's not happening I want to stay away or    
        make my own......

        Why oh why oh why is there such a tendency for people to pigeonhole     
       themselves to the extent that your into industrial so you wear black,    
       you like trance so you wear glitter,etc. etc., 

        All this talk about gangstas (sic) at raves seems like a load of bs to  
      me. Are certain people not acceptable at a party because they are not     
        middle class and white ? 

        Why does (for example) Live 105 "the alternative station" not play any  
      dance music.            Dance muisc is the real "alternative music" these 
       days.

	Hmmph... Yes it is my usual spouting place. Gabber starts around 
170, 150 is a little slow, and heads up above 300 bpm (though I cannot 
keep up with beats that fast). Samples, I assume voice samples, can be 
present, especially in the shit coming out of LA which oozes attitude. 
Some people like those samples, I do not. There are some labels out of 
France and Scotland that produce >driving< hard kicked gabber that pushes 
hard and makes me dance and stomp and growl and howl... Just like most 
other types of music, there is gabber that is complete SHITE and gabber 
that is really good. SF doesn't seem 
to like it, so I routinely get up on my soapbox to hopefully keep people 
somewhat open to it....
	If goa can be considered driving and full of energy, then gabber 
that has been pressed well with some attention payed to some that 
kickdown sounds when a needle plays it back should knock those people's 
socks off as they stomp harder and harder ;)

Gabber is the Punk Rock of Rave... spouting forth from the football
hooligan and fascist infected terraces of Rotterdam. Working class music of
the '90s.

the best party I went to this year was Vibrator in the Anza Borrego
desert. Beautiful flat translucent desert, pooled heavens... and the
people were truly extensions of their surroundings. I cannot express how
much FUCKING fun I had. It was one of those parties that you always think
you've had but don't really realize what its all about until you're there.
I feel that it was by far the most positive, sincere, sharing, absolutely
free party I have ever been to, 
and maybe it will be that way forever. I guess I won't
know until I get there. 

Definitely up there: Ascension, also in the Anza Borrego.

Sorry about being n+1 person to post Christmas Spirit stuff. Here's the
deal: I haven't checked my mail all week,
got home, started up Eudora and all the sfraves stuff went to one mailbox,
and other personal stuff went to another, which I read first.  I was over
taken by the kind thought and forwarded without checking sfraves first.
My apologies to all!

        Where do all y'all buy your rave clothes?   I like some stores on
Haight, but especially Mr. Rags in the Hillsdale Mall right next to Macy's.
 It's got all the stiff Haight stores have except the clothes are new, wide
variety, and a helll of a lot cheaper.  I got these dope JNCO pants that are
32 inch wide legs and have big ass Jnco Label and stripes that glowin the
dark, a must for any rave! 

         Who are the best Djs and hot spots for funk type techno-ish
spinners?  

          I would like to say thanx to all of u who answered my questions
before about whether to go to Planet New Year and I found out nothing except
half of u would and half wouldn't.


Peace out,  V3!

This is a hoax.
The responses have been overwhelming Houghton Mifflin's mail servers

Thanks to all who dug my message.  I probably jumped a little hard for a first 
posting so apologies if I offended anyone.  

As one sees the dance music movement crystallizing into a solid entity and 
greedy hucksters try and turn it into the next Rap Industry it stirs the emotions.

I remember ghetto kids with their cardboard and boomboxes breakdancing on the 
streets of LA and you couldn't give Hip Hop away to the record labels there.  They 
wouldn't touch it and laughed at it like it was worthless junk.

Same for Punk Rock, New Wave, etc. etc.

The True Underground will never die and we don't need to cry over "the dayz" 
because the best are yet to come.

My most positive thought is that if there is any chance for world peace and unity 
among all Earthlings then it might come about through dance music and partying 
because no matter what your persuasion the pretenses end on the dancefloor.

Love to All Dancers and Peacemakers

"party" clothes??  i just go to secondhand stores and grab what i wanna
wear, period.  Almost all my party gear is stuff i would wear to any
casual occasion in one form or another.

Mind you, i'm tight for cash, so i have to be practical .. no silver
sequinned dry-clean-only numbers for me!

uuunnnnnhhhhhh


oh uuh I mean; Hi!  =)

 Where to start;

Favorite moments:  seeing Gregs lights kick full on booty!  =)

            	Lee's set: will someone _please_ pick up my jaw for me!
		
		Meeting Ann!
		
		Having a nite off!!!!!!!  ;)

Less than favorite;	breathing WAY too much dust!!!
			
			Red light district elements. Mind you I like lewd 
			(at times) but just too much drunken lewd/club 
			feeling lewd. ick. Esepecially distasteful after 
			the memory of Harmony 3
			
			BATHROOM!!!!!!! (only one)
			
			party overcrowded (just a bit but combined with 
			dust and no chill area (well...) and sketchy folks from 
			down town SF made it just a tad wierd)

			Dealing with a violent individual who took 
			wayyyyy too much LSD and who knows what else. 
			Since the person was violent, lunging at 
			passerbys and I was concerned he might hurt 
			himself I had an ambulence called and helped to 
			restrain him until medical help arrived. He was 
                        goin to detox when they wheeled him out. That 
			really shook me up as I was pretty blasted at the 
			time and had 6 officers around me while they were 
			trying to strap this poor SOB down.


		way icky-poo!


Props to Minor for great stuff! Gieger-house!!

Thanks to Rebecca for puttin' up with me. ;)

Props to Gateway (especially John!!). There was some audio system no-nos 
but these were taken cared of.

We miss you Omar.

I was there, didn't find any sfravers though.. What a blast it was!
You may have seen me wearing all black-- glasses-- i spent time 
sitting by the corner of the hallway leading from the front room - and
danced mostly by the far right corner of the room :D

Took a couple of wrong turns last night and ended up at 1015, instead of 
the original destination of :) Freaky People.  Had to do with a non-raver 
friend's birthday, and me picking up a nasty cold.  Saw the doctor Friday 
morning and she said there was (quote) an "epidemic!"  (Right, KaySEE?!) Be 
careful, folks.  Be mean ravers and don't share those water bottles, 'kay? ;)

So after a day of sleeping, and a couple of WEEKS of anticipation, I 
could not stay in last night, though an all-night freak fest was out of 
the question.  My booty wanted to DANCE!  After hitting up the cheesy 
Cadillac Bar (which features the world's best bartender, spinning bottles 
and building glass pyramids - I love a showman!), 1015 was on - Donald 
Glaude and Scott Henry (Wash DC) guestdj'ing.

But folks, I am here to officially announce that Nikita is DEAD.  I was 
hoping that at least Donald would induce some of the family to come 
out.  Instead, as Donald dropped the fat beats, only me and like five 
other gruvers were gettin down on the dancefloor.  The rest of the 
crowd consisted of single guys, clutching beer bottles and STANDING on 
the dancefloor.  The high sausage ratio created the very weird vibe of an 
intended pick-up scene thwarted - lotsa guys bemoaning the lack of 
chicks, unable to pick up on anyone and unable to think of anything else 
to do.

Donald's dreads were flying, he was jumping up and down, scratchin' and 
rappin' (I love a showman!) and I was dancing all over the place - until 
my medicinal pot cookie wore off and the body aches and fever came back 
full force.  I had to leave, sorry to miss the end of a tight set, but no 
regrets about abandoning the venue.  Ironically, the front room (rap and 
Wild107 house) was much more crowded - couples doin their thing.  I can't 
report on the 3-hour set by Jerry Bonham in the (so-called) "Underground."

Clubland - when will I learn?  I just want to dance to some great dj's in 
a comfortable locale with some alcohol.  But the majority of people who 
come are there for a different purpose, and enduring the pick-up vibe can 
ruin a night.  I love all the other dancers on the floor though - 
watching others last night I had the wonderfully warm feeling that these 
were my brothers and sisters - Brothers and Sisters of the Groove! :) :)

a good party, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I should have. =(

anyway, it was also my LAST s.f. party for 1996. since on wednesday I'm
cruising off to poland to see the fam... I'll be back in time for some
end-of-january ragers though.

It was great seeing you all and I can't wait to return!

take care,
-m.

 Not really a "hoax", as this books-for-email campaign was started by
HMI, and there is an official web site about it. I just think that HMI
never realized how wide the Internet's reach is nowadays. I bet they don't
do it the same way next year, if at all. 

 Considering that SFRaves got this 4 or 5 times since Wednesday, I can
imagine how it's going around in the "outside" Internet world...

hi sfravers,

i've been lurking for a while on the list, but now have a relevant 
question to pose to all of you: 

does anyone know where i can hunt down a copy of the UK production "loved 
up", about the E and the UK dance scene?  i've looked in Le Video with no 
luck.  

also, if anyone has any suggestions of other movies, or even better, 
DOCUMENTARIES, on rave culture, it would be much appreciated...

thanks in advance,

there's a video by an up'n'coming film maker named Kenji Williams (from 
Boulder, Co) called Moment Utopia which is amazing... it juxtaposes raves 
and aboriginal culture... with some great footage of toronto and LA 
parties (i beleive it's moontribe)...

contact him at  
        Ian.Williams@Colorado.EDU

i think he sells them for $20, maybe less...

still trying to find a word for the positive vibes and NRG that i felt 
last night...
	fucking BEAUTIFUL?!?!?! 
	no, that doesn't even give it justice. the music was pumpin, excuse me 
did i hear JUNGLE there? (when ah pull mah trigga fingah...) ahh ya :>> 
dancin so hard i feel like i'm floating (or was it the fact i was 
standing in the sand? yay!)
	the people were beautiful, and happy. i didnt meet a single person with 
negative vibes. and all the silver came out of the stuff in my hair, but 
if anyone ever gets the chance to strip up an emergency blanket and put 
it in their hair, it feels so neat! especially running down the street 
at 6:30 in the morning! major props to the guys who dressed as women 
(nice beard!) and everyone else who got funked out last night! i didn't 
feel alone! :>> 
 i'm still high off the love in that party last night.... and HELLO to 
all you SFRavers who i saw and hugged and smiled to!!!! YOU are ALL 
beautiful!!! :>>> 
Take care and much love,

Side effects?

  What do you mean? The only side effects of antibiotics I know of is, it
cures you of any infection you may have.
  But if you meant like, taking E when on Antibiotics. I was on the stuff a
couple of months ago for my tooth ache. And I E'ed my balls off!

  I am sure there are side effects though. But thats why you only take what
the doctor perscribes.

>17. What the best DJ name in 96?
ghost (I like the name! so shoot me...)
Ya know mike,
	Liking Ghost's name is nothing to be ashamed of, I don't think anybody
should shoot you for anything--much less for liking Ghost's name, man. 
Have you ever sat down and talked to Ghost?  He's got the biggest heart
of anyone I know, being quiet IS NOT a crime!  Anyway glad you like his
name, he was very happy to hear that.

  OK... since I missed Freaky People.. here is my Kirkwood review.  

        While I failed to see any of the people that said they would be up
there, everyone was friendly and stoked about the snow.  Very windy, very
cold.  Had fun, came home, now it's time to party.

       Oh, the real reason for this message was on the way home I saw a jeep
with a bumper sticker reading:

      Burning Man--     Been there    Touched that

hi all:

after a long day of coding, i've got the site set up to generate playlists
based on genre and codec.  i also modified the code to generate a more
random playlist.

anyway, if you have RealAudio 3.0 and a 28.8 modem, you can get a feel for
what's coming by hitting the following url:

http://www.x-radio.com/xradcgi/make_playlist.cgi?genre=trance&codec=ra3.288

i've only got TWO songs encoded for RA 3.0 right now, so it's a tiny, tiny
playlist, but it sounds a lot better than the old RA 2.0 codec...

there's been a lot of people hitting the server tonight, so you might have
trouble getting a slot.  just keep trying and you'll slip in soon enough..

also, i'm getting a 100-cd changer that i'll be connecting up.  (yeah!)

have a killer Saturday night!
pauly

rawnsley@hotwired.com (Andrew Rawnsley):

First, there's nothing wrong with being working class. Just because you
work on computers doesn't suddenly make you rise above the working
class. In fact, knowing the way HotWired pays&treats people, you're
prolly working class too :-). Within 10 years, all of us computer
literate technoid folks will be like plumbers -- working class. So
instead of dissing the working class, you should seek solidarity with
your future bretheren. Either that, or get real good at wearing a tie,
fuck over a few honest hard-working coworkers, and you may be given the
credentials to rise out of working class and into "upper management."
...

Second, I don't think yours is an accurate comparison because punk rock
originally was not "fascist infected" nor "hooligan". It was anarchist,
it fully realized that the pseudo-liberalism of the hippies wasn't
actually helping the majority of people, just an excuse for people to
act flakey, take lots of drugs, and fuck a lot while claiming they were
doing their own thing. The government loved this as it made a whole
class of people too caught up in hedonism to be effective at achieving
political change. Once the young hedonists became "of age" (i.e. over
50), you could throw a few bribes at the average "inhaler" (e.g. Bill
Clinton) and they'd be happy to sell out their college-bred liberalism
to the all-powerful cororate hegemony which governs the nations of the
world.

I think the hooligan/fascist aspects of punk happened once punk was
"dead" (about '81). Of course groups like Television, the Buzzcocks,
and even Devo continued doing the punk thing with "art school"
sensibilities. No fascists there, no hooliganism -- in fact, some
incredibly well-written and poignant songs. I still play them nowadays
to hear how a song *SHOULD* sound now that "punk" is  defined as the
unintelligable muttering of strung out seattle heroin addicts, or
musclehead racist idiots ranting hatred.

Post-death, punk spintered off into new wave (e.g. elvis costello,
talking heads), and experimental synth noise ala Psychic TV, Cabaret
Voltaire, Nervous Gender, etc. In the latter group, we see a lot of
techno progenitors setting up shop (Genesis P Orrige, Richard Kirk).
Not a fascist or hooligan in the whole lot mentioned above. Anarchist,
perhaps... twisted unchristian noise torturers, definitely.

The "fascist" aspect of punk also raised it's ugly head in the mid 80's
-- long after punk was dead. Oi Music, and in the USA, the Aryan
Nations neo-nazi movement (Metzger) embranced the power of punk to
disseminate a message of racial hate and fascism. But that's not punk
-- that's skinheads. And I believe they're glomming on to the raw
energy of gabber in europe in order to disseminate hate amongst the
downtrodden "poor white trash" of europe. Wide distribution of
methamphetamines is fueling the fascist gabber wave of europe, just
like it fueled the armies of Hitler and Hirohito. (did you know that
the US Armed forces *ordered* battlefield soldiers to take
methamphetamines under penalty of court martial in order to be able to
fight the tweaked-out german and japanese armies? Brings a whole new
meaning to "war on drugs" eh?).

Anways... Certainly some punks played fast and loose with fascist
sybols (e.g.  swastikas). I never appreciated that, but I certainly
understand it -- shock value to rattle a society composed of idiotic
corporate drones spouting about freedom and democracy while not even
noticing their own shackles.

Like I said before, what the rave scene needs nowadays is to get back
to "punk" sensibilities of DIY parties and music (not the fascism).
At least they're not playing Jungle on Live 105...

Rantingly yours,
	Niels...

Excellent rant.  I don't detect any disdain from Rawno about the "working class,"
actually.  The UK and Europe have gone through at least two generations now of
having a permanent "dole class" of working-class kids who in fact don't end up
getting work, mostly because there isn't any.  For good or ill, the Sex Pistols
articulated their perspective and ignited the musical styles and sensibilities
of a generation.  It's a mixed bag.  The Clash, the Two-Tone bands, 
"We Don't Need That Fascist Groove Thang," the Summer of Love and the UK/European
rave scene at its best represent to a great degree a positive response to those
conditions of social and economic repression.  The National Front, football
(soccer) hooliganism and all kinds of protofascist musical styles borrowing on
the harder-edge rock, punk and techno schemes are another direction.  

In my view, class and race divide us here as they do in Europe and the UK, but
in different proportions.  Race is the more predominant factor here.  House music
(and E) had, for at least a while, the miraculous effect of lowering those 
barriers at least for some people, at least for a time.  Which is why many of us
latter-day-old-skoolers still believe in the House Nation (though we do't tend
to preach about it, knowing that actions are more persuasive than words, especially
now).  One of the things I was rather surprised to learn was the lowering of
social barriers across class lines in the UK and Europe during the post-Summer of
Love era, especially across relatively artificial geographic barriers epitomized
by football rivalries -- Manchester vs. Leeds, UK vs. Germany, etc.  More
recently, even our house and techno heroes seem to be reinforcing those trends,
though -- note the tremendous response in the UK to "lager, lager, lager," which
has no cultural handles for us Americans.  

Gabber is fast, hard, uncompromising, insular.  The energy is well-aligned with
the groups that Rawno was talking about.  As music, I don't think much of it,
but like anything there is some of value and I'm actually quite glad Dave Bayer
among others has gotten into it and presents it publicly in a serious way.  
It's one of the many styles of music I see rooted in the disaffection of an
increasing number of people about how our society is running our planet -- not
in a conscious 'political' sense but one that is an expression of personal
emotion, just like hip hop was before Madison Avenue took control.  At the same
time, gabber has a bit of an admittedly Beavis'n'Butthead humorous stance.

So here's a situation where I find myself pretty much in agreement with what
both Rawno and Niels said.  Music has always been used to draw support for
populist movements -- "We Shall Overcome" is probably the most famous example.
The "Christian rock" and "fascist punk/techno" trends both represent to me 
the way other groups have learned to use music to get out their messages.
Even though we may like to think of music as being removed from the political
and social sphere, it never is and the picture is always getting murkier.

One correction.  "Skinheads" come from all across the political spectrum, 
although attention generally gets focuses on the neo-fascist ones, who are
certainly at least a substantial minority.  One response to this I've often
heard is, "there are no racist skinheads, just bald-headed fascists" sums
up the view of the other side.  Again, many of the cultural shadings here are
lost in translation across the Atlantic.  The Two-Tone era (the "first ska
revival" of 1979-80 with bands like The Selecter, Madness and so on) was 
basically a biracial antifascist skinhead movement.  Something that only ever
had faint echoes here in the US . . .

Just my rant-o-the-week . . .

living in canada, which has closer ties to the UK, we have more of a 
two-tone skinhead movement than the US... so i can attest to this...

it's too bad such a sick slant was thrown into something that gave 
working class kids an identity... which was positive in the day, although 
i feel the lack of individualism inherent in skinhead and mod "fashion", 
much like "raver" fashion does nothing to progress youth culture or 
consciousness...

here. here. good rant.

andrew... educate yourself to the world of "crass".


the vancouver punk scene is floweringly anarchist, yet uses the chaos 
symbol instead of the slashed A for it's symbol...

as far as genesis p-orridge is coumcerned, he did explore facets of 
neo-facism in the Throbbing Gristle days which co-existed with punk...


so on and so forth...

        Hello again,
        Hummm.... so I gathered with my friends and decided to go to
        CandyLand cause I didn't have anything to do and I was wide awake.
        
        We find out the party is in Pittsburg, we drive to Pitts and 
        arrive to the skate thingy.

        My friends then get scared cause there are a lot of "HomieG's"
        at this location... 

        We then don't go.. :(

        Can someone tell me how CanDyLand went? :)
        Thanks! :)

Here's a list of some of the things that I like in the morning after a fun
party:
-being barely able to walk straight enough to get to my Bug, but somehow
having no problem driving properly all the way home, and then being barely
able to walk out of the Bug and into bed
-listening to that "Stayup" guy on KLON 88.1fm playing Dixieland Jazz as I
try to drive home properly :)
-trying to remember who all I promised to give mixtapes to this time :D
-looking at my rekkid crate and thinking, "Wow, I think I spun 8 rekkids
tonight and I brought about 40!"  But if those other 32 hadn't been there,
I know it wouldn't have been the same :)
-knowing that sometime next week a memory is going to hit from that party
that I have just not been able to remember until that point, and at that
moment, I will feel all the love and happiness that kept me vibin' all
night :)

*hugs* to everyone, it's time for Uncle Noah to go to bed.
PLUR
sweet dreams! :)

Yeah, I agree I too-strongly pigeonholed skinheads. However, IMHO, the
skinhead movement pretty much died around 81 along with the death of 
punk. I was totally in to the "two tone" skin (and punk) stuff myself
when i was in high-school, and from my POV it truly was not a racist
movement.

However, IMHO, anybody that calls themself a skinhead today is pretty
much a "bald-headed fascist"... yeah, there are the "straight-edge
skins" and other such movements, but they really dwarf the fascist
skins, at least in the US. If nothing else, the remaining non-fascist
skins probably get too tired saying "no, i'm not a racist" to society
at large...  at some point they decided it isn't worth it and seek
another clique. But that's just my opinion.

The Alchemist sez:
> as far as genesis p-orridge is coumcerned, he did explore facets of 
> neo-facism in the Throbbing Gristle days which co-existed with punk...

I screwed up in my post when i tied GPO/Psychic TV/punk together. Yes,
I really meant Throbbing Gristle, but due to a brain glitch, I didn't
say that. 

I actually was a little into Throbbing Gristle back in the day, and
even saw them live once. I personally didn't think they were exploring 
neo-fascism. I do think they were exploring paganism, shock-value, and 
any fringe they could exploit. Buncha weirdoes. But they beat the hell
out of REO Journeywagon shite that most everybody else in my town were
listening to at the time!

--------------------

Getting back into the two-tone/mod/skin thing -- i think y'all should
check out the Who's movie "Quadrophenia."  Provides some interesting 
historical parallels on every new genre of music that has emerged since
the 60's... Seems like each generation's coming-of-age
music/fashion/ethos is really the same old thing with a different beat
and different drugs.

I often wonder what happens to the people that were fully into their
"youth culture scene" when they were 16-24 and now they're just more
same-looking blue-haired middle-aged drones inhabiting a mini-mall,
clutching gifts of plasticene consumer goods. If you look closely
enough at some of those 50ish ladies, you might see the ghost of a the
high-school girl in the miniskirt that was partying down to rock and
roll and riding around in a  souped up roadster, hair flying in the
wind... Sometimes you see that 70 year old who musta been the king of
the jazz juke-joint dance floor, flipping his partner overhead while
dressed sharply, cept now he's walking all jittery with a cane. So...
when y'all are 50, will you still be wearing silvery pants and
clutching teddy bears and raving all night? If not, why not? Will you
miss it?  Will you diss the music your children are listening to as
"noise"?? Will you spend hours boring your grandchildren with stories
about how you saw the great starspangled fritillary one morning at 7AM
and the kids'll just look at each other and say, "yeah, gramps is
losing it again... let's hope he doesn't start yammering on about about
how thick the vibe was back in the day!"

I had a great time. 

Good points:
-DIVERSITY of people...yay!
-best and most consistent mixing I've heard in a long time.
-Good friends, good fun.

Not so good points:
-the usual (lines for bathroom, too crowded, dusty)..but what can you do


Afterwards a bunch of us headed to a little after-party...nothing like 
drinking tea with some friends...and then when we woke up...ANOTHER 
little after-party! Noah, Andy and I spun rekkids till we passed out 
late last night...nice on, guys. :)

you lucky bastard!  did you see the final show in frisco?  gen did 
explore neo-facism through throbbing gristle for a while (songs like 
"discipline" etc... they built it up until their following started 
wearing the military garb the band was donning at the time, and when it 
reached the peak of all these kids in army duds with arm bands and the 
lot, they appeared on stage wearing white frilly gowns and the crowd lost 
it... saying "throbbing gristle has sold out!" ...interesting cultural 
experiment... i wonder how many people caught on that they were mere 
pawns in a game...

heya,
 so i found this groovy little sound tool called "making waves", you can find
it at: http://www.pslnet.demon.co.uk 
 it allows you to create sequences based on samples, rather than midi 
instruments.  i was wondering if someone more in-the-know could check it out
and tell me what they think of it and whether it's worth sending the 45
pounds to the UK for it (and how many pounds one dollar will buy :) or if
there is something better that does a similar thing..

thanks muchly,
 justin

Hello everyone!

	Well, we have to give massive thanks to all of you who came out and showed
your support! (that includes all 10,000 of you ;)
	The party was insane! The music rocked hard all night long! And the energy
seemed to never stop peaking! The whole dress up thing was pretty cool. You
guys should dress up all the time. I would have but I didn't get my neon
fuzzy fur in time! So with our tradition of Friday the 13th, we got busted.
Although, it was late (or early) enough not really make that big of a
difference. (6:30 am) But all in all, we all had lots of fun and it was
really beautiful. So once again, <<<Thank you>>>
	Also, a super, duper, HUGE thank you to however clean that party up. I
fell asleep and little elves came and cleaned the whole thing! (Thank god!)
You guys know who you are!

	Now here are some of my gripes:
		1. Never before have I ever had to bring this up after a Harmony party,
but 		someone finally screwed up.- We got tagged. It was actually the same
person that 		tagged Lepidoptra. The person tags, "PLUR." Note to this
person-the "R" stands 		for Respect. By tagging you do not respect the
space in which you are parting in. 		You do not respect the promoter/s who
have to go and clean it up. Nor do you 		respect the money that the
promoter looses when you decide to do the stupidest 		thing in the world.
(tagging)
		"Art" has it's place, but tagging is not "art." If you want to express
your "art" at one 		of my parties, you are more than welcome to. In fact, I
can arrange an entire wall 		for your "art." But just sneaking into the
bathroom and tagging a TOILET, is really 		immature and has no place at the
Harmony events. So please do not do this any 		more. We respect you by not
searching your bags (and taking you pens) on the 		way in, so respect us by
not tagging our spaces. Space owners do not like this! 		And of course this
is why there aren't that many spaces left. You need to realize 		that
promoters are loosing spaces because of your actions. Pretty soon you'll
have 		no spaces to tag anyway! Hmmm. I wonder if you'll tag your own toilet?

		2. Beautiful people, I am sorry if any of you got hurt when there was
someone 		loosing control of their trip. Those things just should not
happen, but when it does, 		we all need to be aware that "these things
happen." If anyone hears of any info 		about the man we had taken to the
hospital, please send it to me. -thanks and 		once again, sorry if you had
to deal with that.

		3. Sorry if you missed the map point. We sold out way fast! And then
sorry to all of 		you guys that we packed like sardines. We over estimated
the ticket count. Oops!

	So look for the next party in Jan. of '97. And we'll see you all soon.
Take care.

 What I thought of was "what happens when ravers become parents?". So
many of the "youth cultures" , identified by definition with adolescence
and just-post-adolescence , pay little attention to the baby-raising aspects 
of life. 

 Being a raver and being a parent - would people who are in that
position please clue us in on your experience?

PS - I've never worn silvery pants or danced with a stuffed toy (yet).

Larry, okay, I'm not a parent.  I am still my parent's child.  But as I am
in the throws of early adulthood I do know one thing: Among the many things
around me and about me that I don't know, I do know that I am me.  The
culture that I'm "into" is an expression of a part of me and if there are
other people around me who desire to express their selfs in a way which is
harmonious with my own expressions, then that is an experience.  For me I
can't really allow that to make the leap into "culture".  I know for myself
that I am individualistic in a lot of ways - I will not do what everyone
else is doing because it is fashion/fad/in/pop/culture just as I will not
go against something just for the sake of individualism/rebellion/anarchy.
I am wrong often more times than I am right, but I try my hardest to do
what I think is not only is "best" for me, but also make me feel good while
enhancing my "self" without compromising the belief systems, moralities and
makeup of others.  Yes I am young, but these ideals are a part of me and
who I am, not implanted by a scholastic/religous/cult/pop institution and I
hope to live by them and carry them with me all of my life - whether it is
now, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred,
married, single, with children, emotionally stable, flipping out, happy,
sad, here in the S.F. Bay Area or whatever/whoever/whenever else because
there's really only one person I have to be comfortable with, and that's
me.

Peace, Daniel

Friends, I need your help in making a serious decision in my life...

It's been six months since I graduated college and still I sit in student 
housing, working for the University, dealing with Telegraph every day, 
and going to the same old Berkeley house parties on the weekends.  And as 
the year comes to a close, it's becoming more and more clear that it's 
time to MOVE ON - to allow the tides of change to sweep me along to a new 
phase of my life.  It's scary to leave something safe, something known, 
but I know in my heart resisting the flow is wrong.  And everything in me 
says to let go of my old life and take a deep breath and go...

So, I am thinking of abandoning all here and... (TA DA!) moving to San 
Francisco!!  I'll need a job, and an apartment, and new San Francisco 
friends, and it all seems like so much - but I don't want fear to keep me 
chained to a way of life that no longer offers growth for me.

Unfortunately, I'm pretty clueless about the City.  What I really need 
from all of you SF people are your experiences in the City.  What are the 
best neighborhoods?  How much does it really cost to live there?  What 
do you love/what do you hate?  Is it really impossible to have a car?  
And whatever else comes to mind...  And if anyone has been through 
the dislocating experience of graduating and having no clue what to do 
with yourself, a note of support would be MUCH appreciated!!  Change can 
be the hardest thing to deal with...

Thank you in advance!

Nancy

Sorry 'bout adding to the high volume of mail (no, I won't use the term 
bandwidth), but Jonathan, I need you to contact me. You must have changed 
your address, cause you apparently haven't gotten my other 
correspondence. But, as always, SFRaves comes thru again: whatever your 
address, I know you're on here. Pleez get back to me.

If anybody else out there has some pertinent info for me ("LeftJab joined

This just reminded me of a passage from a book:

"An experience fell to my lot this night of the Ball that I had never known
in all my fifty years, though it is known to every flapper and student--the
intoxication of a general festivity, the mysterious merging of the
personality in the mass, the mystic union of joy.  I had often heard it
spoken of...  Even in recent days I had marveled at and loved and mocked
and envied this gleam and this smile in my friend, Pablo, when he hung over
his saxophone in the blissful intoxication of playing in the orchestra, or
when, enraptured and ecstatic, he looked over to the conductor, the drum,
or the man with the banjo.  It had somtimes occurred to me that such a
smile, such a childlike radiance could be possible only to quite young
persons or among those peoples whose customs permitted no marked differnces
between one individual and another.  But today, on this blessed night, I
myself, the Steppenwolf, was radiant with this smile.    I myself swam in
this deep and childlike happiness of a fairy tale.  I myself breathed the
sweet intoxication of a common dream and of music and rhythm and wine and
women--I, who had in other days so often listened with amusement, or dismal
superiority, to its panegyric in the ballroom chatter of some student.  I
was myself no longer.  My personality was dissolved in the intoxication of
the festivity like salt in water.  I danced with this woman or that, but it
was not only the one I had in my arms and whose hair brushed my face that
belonged to me.  All the other women who were dancing in the same room and
the same dance and to the same music, and whose radiant faces floated past
me like fantastic flowers, belonged to me, and I to them.  All of us had a
part in one another.  And the men, too.  I was with them, also.  They, too,
were no strangers to me.  Their smile was mine, and mine their wooing and
theirs mine."

That's from Steppenwolf, by Hermann Hesse, published 1927 (tr Basil
Creighton, 1929, revised).  You could see the whole book as about raving,
actually--it's basically the story of this guy who's depressed and solitary
but then meets a woman who teaches him how to party, and he wakes up to
things.  It's all encrusted with weighty philosophical veneer in typically
Germanic fashion, but that's the core of it.  The music is jazz, the drug
is alcohol, the dances are foxtrots and box-steps, but the vibe is the
same.

They do play a little, though strictly in the Prodigy, Chemical Brothers,
etc hit single vein--in other words, probably a negative rather than a
positive sign.  They used to do real dance music, actually, with proper DJs
coming in and spinning house and techno late Friday and Saturday nights.
That was three or four years ago, though.  I don't know when it stopped,
exactly, but it's been a long time.

Chemical Brothers at the Trocadero (maybe that doesn't really count, but
all the real parties were pretty good).

I'd like to give an honorable mention here, since I didn't get to bitch
about it when it happened, for the worst party of ALL TIME: Dubtribe in
Santa Cruz, August, I think, of 95.

Big black boots and piece-a-shit jacket.  Course, I have a pretty limited

there were a bunch of great events that happened in the year of 1996...
but if i had to narrow it down to just 10, i guess these would be mine in
no particular order:

1- seeing dj Rap @ Funky Tekno Tribe-Tribal Massive (damn, it didn't look like
	home base to me! did you see those water fountains?)
2- Unity (the ohm chant brought a chill to my back! it was sooo awesome!)
3- driving down to LA for Funky Shit Happens with raf, sarvi, doug, and
	bryan (oh, and taking that picture under the hollywood sign)
4- watching carl cox @ nikita (enough said)
5- seeing the sun rise @ freedom on that tall ass hill we had to climb!
6- watching psychobitch and ms thang @ fusion (i've gotta go to chicago!)
7- all the parties @ 818 (james,mike, michael, doug, bryan-when are you guys
	gonna have another?)
8- making fun of sarvi every time she sees dj dan (and that thing she has
	in her wallet-HAHAHA) 
9- kickin' it with the Right Front Speaker Family before/during/after
 	each party (i love you guys! don't matter what STATE/city/mind we're
	in,  we'll always be family!)
10- celebrating 1 year with raf (who could believe things could be this
	good? i love you babe)

tah dah! there it is! i hope to add the gathering 12.21.96 to my list too!
(it made my '95 list for sure) i hope to see all of your guys there!

Hey hey, tommorrow's monday, and that means only one thing:
Monday Night Dinner! :)

(well, it means other things, too, like going back to work,
but we won't get into that!)

This week, we'll be dining at the ever delicious...
Phuket Thai (248 Divisadero @ Haight) 415.864.8584

featuring yumm-erific Thai cuisine that vegans, veggies, and
carnivours can all agree on...and an extra bonus surprise to whomever
can come up with the best pronunciation that won't get your mouth
washed out with soap. ;)

And of course, after dinner, we go to Mad...as always, at the fabulous
Bahia Cabana on Franklin and Market.

See ya then!

 I hadn't checked my sfraves mail for several days last week, so I
missed hearing about Jungle Love until after the fact. I had heard
about another thing going on at 330 Rich street. Did anyone else go?
Noel was spinning, who I had heard before and liked, along with a
couple other DJs I hadn't heard of. 

The place was not really at all what I was expecting. It struck me as
being a dinner club and coctails sort of place. When I first arrived
the music was not jungle and the few people there were either playing
pool or sitting at the shiek stainless steel candle-adorned tables.
I'm not sure who was creating the music or how I would go about
describing it, but it seemed at least partially live.

After about an hour, maybe, the jungle did start up and my body
obeyed. Through the whole course of the evening there were probably
never more than 15 people dancing at once.  I thought it was pleasant
to be completely uncramped. I had a really great time and the music
was excellent. 

I see that it is listed as a regular event on the calendar, described
as being a "showcase or all that encompasses electronic musiq." Does
this mean it is only occasionally a jungle happening? What sorts of
things do Miquel, Laron, Gabe Real, et. al. spin? What is the current
state of Audio Impact? The info in the calendar is incorrect now,
right?

Now that I have your attention.....

My friend amy reallyreally needs a ride to the gathering on saturday!
She is really cool but has only been to one party (lepidoptera).  I
would take her of course, But I'm gunu be in portland next weekend.  She
is from new york, and totaled her car last week so she has no way of
getting there.  If you have an extra seet in your car, please give her a
call.  

her # is 408-867-5037

She lives in Saratoga, but I'm sure she could arrange transportation to
anywhere in San Jose or Southbay to avoid you having to drive to pick
her up.

Thanx guys!

There are parties going on that tend to be more "diverse".
Unfortunately today the music scene has become somewhat segragated based allong musical styles and unfortunately race.  You
generally won't
find many people of color at a gabba or hard trance party, the high speed and pounding rhthyms tend to be contrary to what AA and
Latinos's groove to. Goa tends to be frequented primarily by Euros as well.  I don't think these people are exclusionary and almost
all of the CCC people that I've met have been wonderful loving people, the problem is I don't feel the music in my soul (and more
important, my pelvis :)

For a more diverse crowd you might want to check out the House and the Jungle scenes.  The legendary Wicked parties (now
infrequent) had a reputation for being very pan-cultural and pan-sexual.  If large massives are your thing, try Funky Techno Tribe
(the promoters themselves are about as diverse as you can get) and The Gathering.  For smaller parties it's more difficult because
the best ones nowa days are underground, but
for New Years day, stompy cafe will be the place to be, homeboys, crackerjacks, dancers, hookers and hos, DJs, DJ wanna bes, suits,
biker shorts, tank tops and ties. Don't forget your sunglasses and it's BYOB :)
(Bring you own Bottle- can I get a witness JSL )

If you are into the stylish house crowd (which is very mixed up culturally) try loveworks at 111 minna,  Also Culture/Root on
Wednesday nights at 1015 Folsom street. Harmony is a wonderful diverse party for all ages.
Look out for UGs like Anarchist's Disco and the up and coming Flava!
by me and JSL.

It seems to be the nature of groups to factionalize, which is unfortunate, but remember that House music was originally an
Afriamerican creation, it sprung up in parties that were mostly black and brown,  initially these parties were primarily the abode
of Gay Brothers but the music diversified (there is still a whole section of house that you will only here in black gay discos),
whites, straights started coming and indeed the true mission of House music is Universal Love so noone was ever excluded.  As it
bounced over to europe (the heart of Whiteness :) obviously the music mutated and the complexion of the parties changed, some of
the music generated was not a palatable to the "old skool" chicago crew, but as any of the Wicked DJs can tell you, you play what
you like and what is effective on the Dance Floor, Im a DJ, not a "house" Dj or a "trance" Dj or a "techno" DJ, but simply a DJ.  I
will play what moves me and the crowd at the moment. So since that thime the music has been fragmenting and spreading out, this is
a good thing. What is not a good thing is people who are talking about excluding various folks from their parties because of the
way they dress or their "tudes", let's remember we were all newbies once and " And, you see, no one man owns house because house
music is a universal language, spoken and understood by all." The goal is for each and every "raver" to generate so much Vibe, that
it melts the hearts of the toughest gangsters.
I've seen what a masterful DJ with the right records can do to a crowd that might have some of the toughest homies in it. PLUR
means absolutely nothing if it can't achieve this feat, for that's how the mesage is spread.

Back in '93 there was a sound system company from LA that had alot of Gs in their employ.  They would come up here to set up the
systems and groove with us, the manager used to tell us "If you have any problems with Gs coming to your party don't worry, just
talk to one of my boys and they'll sort it out". G recognizes G no matter where your from, but JSL is right when he says that real
Gangsters don't go to Raves, the ones that do are looking for a way out of the Life that's why they're there.  We need to welcome
them and realize that their sensibilites, culture and experience can be different form ours.

For the same reason they don't play any "modern rock" either.

"And in every house, you understand, there is a keeper.

And, in this house, the keeper is Jack.

Now some of you who might wonder, 

"Who is Jack, and what is it that Jack does?"

Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body!

Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake.

Jack is the one who gives you the key to the wiggly worm. 

Jack is the one who learns you how to walk your body. 

Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all Jackers together under one house.

You may be black, you may be white; you may be Jew or Gentile. It don't make a difference in OUR House.

And this is fresh.



See you on the dance floor.

Yeah, I was reading something about La Scala (the legendary opera house)
and it was going on about how the opera house and the music was the
backdrop for an enire social scene that included, drug taking, gambling, cruising, tea-room sex, etc. Seems like there always is an
underground :)

I had a full on weekend of partying  (which I haven't done in a while :)
I started at the XLR8R release party, arriving with a friend who is sort of new to the whole SF Rave/House thing. Props go to the
XLR8R crew.
The space, (next to 111 minna) was totaly Rad, large and spacious, with plenty of room to dance. 

When i got there, there was some kick ass jungle going down. I liked what I heard but it didn't inspire me to dance, still, I could
see that some junglist seemed to appreciate what was going down. Mark E. Quark followed next on the house tip and I must admit that
I did catch a groove which felt good cuz I hadn't caught one in a while. When you go out, and really slide into trance long and
deep, it's like a night of excellent sex, the next morning you feel all content and relaxed and mellow and together. Wow.
I left rather early because I was to be the pilot on a special mission the next day.

Chico.

A party? In Chico!? Way out there? My stereotyping kickes in.
Oh no way man, beer guzzling meth sniffin farm boys? I ain't goin out there! 
"No Geoff, It's not like that, the kids are a little provintial but really kool"
"Hrummph, You want me to do what? drive out there? How far is it?
PAST SACREMENTO! 85 MILES TO THE NORTH!!, NO WAY MAN!!!"

I call Jeno at 11:15 to see if he's ready. I had wanted to leave an hour ago, but no-one was answering the phone :).  When I went
to my favorite car rental place, they didn't have any small cars so they had to give me a Jeep Cherokee for the price of an Economy
:) we would ride in style. 
11:30 comes, I get there ring him up on the cellular and tell him to come down stairs.  Some homies from the early days of the FMR
were around,
they were going to carry him if he haden't managed to get a ride (which was me) they weren't going to go because their car didn't
have a tapedeck
but my Jeep did so we all piled in, loaded the records, stopped at the store so I could get 3 bottles of diet pepsi (my fav driving
tweek), a serious gensing, superfood and some chips. Off we go by 12 (oops) Jeno is suppose to go on at 3:30 and it is a 3 hour
drive. We immediately hit heavy traffic on the the bay bridge going out of SF, (oops again) still, after we got over to the east
bay it was smooth sailing, up to Sacto and on over to 99. Driving through the dark, at one point we came to this bizarre sight! for
about an entire mile, there were hundreds of rabbits (maybe they were hares) on the right side of the road, hopping sitting,
standing, fucking, etc. it was truly bizzare, then  a road intersection and no more. Freaky.  99 is not a high-speed highway
straight through and I was not disposed to speed through an area that is foreign to me so I never went above 69.
Still we arrived at the venu at about 3:35. The promoter was freaking cuz he thought we weren't coming (oh ye of little faith). It
was different for me but then I haven't really experienced rave life much outside of the Bay Area. The clothes that the kids were
wearing were not quite the trendiest or the freshist and there did seem to be a lot of meth in the air, but all in all the party
was going off in a way that we no longer really see here in The City. La Ron had opened followed by Dj Tracy, this was a home-comin
for her since she lived there for 3 years. She now has her own fan club and young female proteges, one was really excited to tell
her that she had just got her mixer today! After a little freak-out of the promoter (who didn't think Jeno would show so he had
started to play) Jeno took the decks and played a realy great set to a very appreciative audience (this makes all the difference in
the world) Dimension 7 did the lights and the dancefloor had more vibe then I've felt at most SF parties in a while.  Indeed the
openess and enthusiasm shown there did make me realize raving is not dead it's,
"just sleeping in the hills". At one point there was a ruckuss at the door so the police were called, they came promptly and the
matter was sorted, I have to say that I never met nicer police, the woman gave us her card, said that she would be on duty till 3
am and told us who would replace her and if we had any trouble to just call, they seemed really happy and relieved that kids had a
place to go where alcohol was frowned upon (Chico is the home of sierra-nevada brewing company, can you say lots of cheap good
beer?). Still, if all promoters had police like these, the scene would be really different. It was soo nice to chill with the Chico
possee after Jeno's set, I brought 4 issues of XLR8R and the kids had never seen it before, they asked me how much they were and I
told them it was free, they couldn't believe it, a magazine that was filled with rave culture, one EmotivE young lady clutched her
magazine all night and kept hugging me saying to me thank you, thank you!
I have to say that I was skooled that evening, about the dangers of stereotypes, the power of the vibe, and the universaity of
House Music.
I caught a groove long and hard and looked over to my new found friends on the dance floor with that look that every raver knows is
available at around 4 am when the barriers come down and you find yourself "deep in the vibe of House", we connected and know that
we will always have that moment in eternity.
That party had more honest vibe and love then a stack of SF parties, it was well worth the 6 hour commute, and I would do it again
at the drop of a hat.  To the Chico Rave posse, Jeno and I had a wonderful time, thank you for your expression of love and respect.
Looking forward to seeing you again soon.

Hi all!  =)


 Forgot to say Hi to a few people I met Friday night. Hugs to Janel and 
Celesate! Hi to Micron! Hello again to Jess (he of the space gun). Hi Ian!
I know I'm missing a few folks here but Hi anyway. 
 And while the crowd was a tiny bit wacked (compared to Harmony 3) the 
diversity was great.


hugs,



Ran D.Dreams

The Corpse Had A Familiar Face: Covering Miami, America's Hottest Beat
        -- by Edna Buchanan (New York: Random House, 1987), p.157:

The stories about drugs in Miami are also larger than life. So many are
true that even the myth of the dead baby has become accepted as modern
Miami-American folklore.

Let's get this straight right here and now: There is no cocaine-stuffed
dead baby, at least at this writing.

The dead baby resurfaces frequently, reported as fact in otherwise
responsible and prestigious -- and some not so responsible and prestigious
- -- publications. It has appeared on the front page of _The Washington
Post_, in _Life_ magazine, and in the _National Enquirer_.  The story,
with minor variations, is that an alert customs official, or airlines
employee on a Colombia-Miami flight noticed that a baby in the arms of a
woman passenger did not look well. Closer scrutiny revealed that the baby
was dead and its body stuffed with high-grade cocaine in an attempt to
smuggle the drug into this country.

The dead baby is reported at least once a year. Each time, I am one of
the many reporters assigned to check it out. It is fiction. It did not
happen.  I have laid the dead baby to rest so often that I can now see
its poor little pasty face in my mind's eye.

Edna Buchanan is a crime reporter for the Miami Herald.

Hello,

Well, when your buying a 10$ ticket from the back of a hatchback in an
alleyway off the SOMA district, you KNOW it's a UG party... 

Got there when the first DJ was spinning, danced a bit.  Really "got
there during MARS set, however, my leg re-pulled some muscle in my leg
in another (sigh) circle...

Chilled out a bit with the two newbes I brought along , did that, "mind
over matter thang" and went off during Mystr-E' s set (meditation is a
powerful tool).  Didn't do too much floor work, fast stepping, but did
some upper movements (and man are my shoulders sore).  

Getting pretty hardcorish in the morning  (DJ Tom?), but getting a bit
hungry @ about 5:30. Nice party all in all, bust out @ 6AM with some
friends to Dennys in Japantown....

Spent the rest of Sunday with my good friend Nature @ two different
beaches off Hwy 1.

"It sucks being misunderstood..."

_Adam




"Stay Connected..."

DAMN!! my ass got rocked!!!! My friend called me last night to go and see
orbital and chemical brothers...it wasnt until later that I realized it
was going to be 45 minutes of orbital and only an hour of chemical bros,
interspersed between...ummm other bands ;) well, anyways...orbital was
pretty good, it seemeed like alot of people didnt quite know what to do to
the sound of a beat...but we sure did!...but the highlight of the show was
the chemical brothers...one solid hour of serious getting down! those guys
did not let up the whole time...
	I was wondering how much of what they were playing is
pre-recorded? I've heard that alot of 'live' techno acts simply throw in a
dat and just jump around on stage...

<<1. Best party you went to in 96?
(tie)Emotion, Vancover BC, February
       Gateway, Portland OR. February
       Burning Man
2. Worst party you went to in 96?
I forget the name of the party, but it was at the ACME and Dan Curtain spun
there.  His set was dissapointing, and we had to wait thru some pretty bad
music until he came on.

3. Best local DJ for 96?
 Assuming that it is unfair to vote for one's self,there are several whom I
consider for this.  They are(in no particular order):
-Solar
-Joe Rice
-Felix

4. Best Non-local DJ for 96?
Stacey Pullen

5. Best record for 96?
Impossible to choose.
6. Worst record for 96?
The Macarena. Hands down.

7. Best mixtape for 96?
Assuming that a DJ only puts music he really likes on his/her mixtapes, I'd
have to vote for my own tape "Visions" on this one.  Forgive me.

8. Worst mixtape for 96?
I have no clue, but I'm sure there are many....

9. Best track for 96?
Impossible to choose.

10. Worst track for 96?
See # 6
11. Favorite location for a party in 96?
A boat.
The Black Rock Desert
12. Least favorite spot for a party in 96?
ACME

13. Favorite thing to do after a party in 96?
Sleep.

14. Favorite thing to wear to a party in 96?
Headphones.

15. The most you ever spent in one night at a party in 96?
I'll have to confer with my accountant on this one....

16. If you can change one thing about raving in 96, what would it have been?
I would make it so there were more new/relatively unknown DJ's played more;
There would 've been more FnF's; There would've been more cross-polination
between Deep House & Deep Techno, and  I would ban Goa Trance :) 

17. What the best DJ name in 96?
Who gives?
18. Worst DJ name in 96?
See above.

19. Best name for a party in 96?
Justice.
20. Worst name for a party in 96?
>>NYC

Well I got this idea from Socal-raves which is similar to the 10 best we
have going on now, but I little more.  Not everyone will agree, but that's
whats so great. We will get a chance to see what everyone likes and
dislikes.  And remember, these are all personal opinions, you don't have to
agree, just respect there opinion.

Hey all! Just wondering how Out-a-Sight Friday night was on Saturday, and 
what did everyone think of the Kundalini party @ Big Heart City also, on 
Saturday night.


			Just curious. . . . Bill

(1.)  Best event- Freedom @ the ranch for the 5th year
		  Also seeing the space shuttle return back to earth!

(2.)  Best mixtape- As usual, from my favorite- Tony @ The Gathering 
		    back on April 6th.

(3.)  Fav. DJ's- Tony, Josh; also opening up my ears to the other sounds 
of the scene @ The Gathering chill room in April- Joe Rice, and Darkhorse.
(Great sets guys! I just wish there were monitor speakers in that room 
that night.)

	That's all I can think of right about now! Peace ----> Bill
			    Have a great day! :)

    Everything is subjective.

    Kundalini - 

	When I heard this thing was in Big Heart City, I had high
    hopes for it. I've been in this space to hear bands live, and I
    knew it had a good sound system, decent acoustics, good ventilation,
    and plenty of comfortable spaces for people to chill in. It seems like
    the promoters mostly took a tech/lighting approach to the space, which
    unforunately doesn't kill the clubby vibe. This space needs more emphasis
    on art objects. Something must be done about the pool tables. The club's
    owners were involved, keeping the bar open until 2AM. I only checked
    this place out for about ten minutes around midnight. I meant to get back
    to it later after the bar closed, but reality intervened. Anyone else know
    what happened here? If this space stays available, I'm sure someone will do
    some very cool things with it. 
 
    Digital Balance - 
	Map point in the Haight, party in Emeryville. It was busted by the time
    I got there. Oh well. Back to Soma for ...

    Galactic Tunnel - 

	Did somebody say underground? The party had this dark subterranean 
    ambiance. The name was apparently inspired by the shape of the main room, 
    which had the approximate relative dimensions of four shoeboxes laid 
    end-to-end. The speakers were positioned on either side of the tunnel,
    about midway down, facing the DJ. This is an acoustical nightmare. Once 
    the music got loud, every bass drum kick came back with a couple out of 
    time slapback echoes. Throw in long periods of time where the only
    lighting on the dance floor is a strobe light that's not synced to the
    beat. I'm surprised we're not seeing more epileptic seizures. Many people
    are apparently nodding out - slumped down along either side of the long wall
    of this dark tunnel. Are they wisely shutting this out? Is this meditation? 
    Or have I walked into a shooting gallery? Well, my mood is shot, anyway.

Well, this is the first review I've posted in a while.  Its also my last one
for a while. 

I'm glad I got the chance to meet everyone that I have in the past 6 months.

Thanks to the Harmony crew for letting me help out and be a part of your 
wonderful parties.

The party on Friday night was CRAZY!!  I was working water when Li started
spinning and by the time I made it to the dane floor a little after midnight
people were screaming and yelling and dancing like mad.  Magically the lighting
sequences somehow seemed to match with Li's set perfectly.  Minor Minor came on
and I got lost in the music.  Next thing I know I'm sitting on the chill room
floor and everyone seems to be getting up and leaving.  The night ended way to
fast for me but I had a blast.  

I took pictures for the first time at a party.  If I don't get them developed
before I head back to school I'll get them scanned in and put them up on a 
webpage.

CONFESSIONS OF RAVE ROOKIE II

Pulled up to the 'map point' and gave the man $$$ for the tix. Turned 
out to be more of a 'direction point' as the event turned out to be all of 
two blocks behind us on the same road. No worries, tho - Parking was 
easy and we bopped right in.

Since it was the first time at an SF 'rave' for me and the first time 
to any rave-type dealie for my two companions, we weren't sure what 
to expect. We cruised up the stairs and found a very dark, possibly a 
chillout room halfway up. Kept on truckin as discovered a sparse 
crowd jammin to some good beats. Moved in closer and started to get 
funky. The crowd was a bit younger than I had expected -average was 
seemed to be hovering around 17 - I felt ancient at 26! 

The sound was excellent, although the bass could have been even better, 
given the tremendous stack of Crest amps they had. What a sight ! The 
dj's were good, mixing seamlessly, although there were a few lapses 
and awkward gaps in the music. 

The lightshow had potential, but it seemed like the operators kept 
forgetting about it.

The place never really filled up (at least up to when we scooted, 
which was 3ish) but varied between almost-empty and half-full. 

All in all, t'was a good night.

None of these responses have anything to do with any sort of self 
promotion, because you know I would just dominate all the best 
categories.  Plus I'm modest.

>1. Best party you went to in 96?
Sunset, April 28

>2. Worst party you went to in 96?
I don't remember the name, but it was at Third Wave dance studio.  It was 
so hot and crowded that I never even made it to the dance floor.  I left 
half an hour after arriving there.  I did meet Jondabomb there though.

>3. Best local DJ for 96?
Mark Farina

>4. Best Non-local DJ for 96?
Carl Cox (but I heard Laurent Guarnier was badass)

>5. Best record for 96?
Probably the one I got most mileage out of...Ken Ishi "Extra",  Wagon 
Christ rmx

>6. Worst record for 96?
I don't remember any titles, cuz I didn't buy them, but there were some 
real stinkers!

>7. Best mixtape for 96?
I don't dance to tapes, I chill to them.  My favorite background music 
that was released on Tape would have to be Everett's Trip Hop (volume 2 I 
think).  Really nice music.

>8. Worst mixtape for 96?
Anything by Keoki (pitch control anyone?)

>9. Best track for 96?
Either the Ken Ishii track or the (kind of) new Eon

>10. Worst track for 96?
see #6

>11. Favorite location for a party in 96?
I really liked the main room @ 80 Oak Street

>12. Least favorite spot for a party in 96?
pACkME!

>13. Favorite thing to do after a party in 96?
Eat. Shower. Sleep.

>14. Favorite thing to wear to a party in 96?
Pasties!

>15. The most you ever spent in one night at a party in 96?
$19.95 + shipping and handling

>16. If you can change one thing about raving in 96, what would it have been?
better vibe.  DJ's who are hired more for their skills and taste in music 
than for their status.  Organization of DJ's by types of music for better 
flow at events.

>17. What the best DJ name in 96?
PSYCHOBITCH is still my favorite.

>18. Worst DJ name in 96?
Superstar DJ Keoki

>19. Best name for a party in 96?
F'TUMSH!

>20. Worst name for a party in 96?
All in the Family/Lucky Charms (tie)

     *******Freaky People**************************************************
     
     Seeing as you got this far, I'd like to leave you with my Freaky 
     People review:
     
     Location:  I really liked it.  Danced all night with my shoes off.  
     Heard next day that there might have been some nails sticking out of 
     the boards in the floor.  But luckily, I can not have my foot pierced 
     by a nail I firmly believe does not exist, I guess.  The crane arm 
     with the disco ball, the sand, the floorboards, the DJ setup (even 
     though I could never tell who was there), the lights (hail hail to the 
     intellibeams... really varied themes for three little elements), the 
     crusty brick walls, the visible semi-chill room, I liked it all.  It 
     was a good rave location.
     
     The People:  I hate some types of extremes.  It seems like people 
     either go to parties militantly sober, or insist on taking so much 
     shit that they spend at least part of their night wrapped up in a ball 
     trying to talk themselves out of scratching their eyes out.  Perhaps I 
     could remind you that you can have a good time at a place like that 
     under the infuence of nothing, or even with a cough and a bad day 
     behind you.  Or even on a reasonable amount of drugs.  Stop taking too 
     much shit.  It will eventually kill the scene.  Ask a cop or a 
     politician why they hate raves... OD's and bad trips.  I should hope 
     it's not all about the drugs.  But the people who do too much drugs 
     will end up fucking it up for those of us who enjoy using moderate 
     amounts of goodies to enhance an already good evening.  Also, if 
     somebody is having a shit time (curled up in ball, obviously tripping 
     out in a not so great way, etc), and you're fairly okay and feeling 
     confident about your own psyche, talk to them, or at least introduce 
     yourself with a smile.  Sometimes just knowing caring people are 
     looking out is all the reassurance you need to start the road out of a 
     bad experience.
     
     If you're wondering what too much is, I don't know what's too much for 
     you and it's not for me to tell you.  It's your own personal 
     responsibility.  I'm a lightweight with some things, and a bear with 
     others.  But if it takes you three or four hits of E just to get off, 
     stop taking it so often (save your body and mind some damage, and save 
     your money for some records or mixtapes).  I saw some guy at Wrinkle 
     that claimed to have taken 10 hits of E.  He was MISERABLE.  If you 
     read about your drugs, you'd realize there are recommended dosages, 
     and good reasons to stay near them (for example, the more E you take 
     past 150mg's or so, the more the 'speedy' side effects become 
     pronounced).  So what gives?  I get the sneaking suspicion there's a 
     lot of people who talk about raves in terms of what they took.  I 
     assure you, I may be newer to this than a lot of you, but there's a 
     lot more going on than drugs.  Perhaps you should experience it with 
     more of you there, mentally.  It's really amazing.
     
     The Vibe:  Yeah, it was definitely there (specially going off on the 
     floor), but almost hard to enjoy.  Lots of people waaaay too fuckin 
     spaced in the corners to really enjoy themselves, and for me that 
     takes away from it.
     
     The Music: Yay!!! More DJ's spinning more variety.  I like four bar 
     snare drum builds, I like jungle, I like trance, I like so much of it. 
      It was so fun looking out at everybody when that Depeche Mode tune 
     came on, because everybody was looking at everybody else wondering 
     what to think.  Fun fun fun!!!  Shilo really pushed some of my 
     perceptions of what a DJ can get away with when the mood is right.  
     Also had a lot of fun listening/groovin to Li's set in the line for 
     the bathroom (which by the way, thanks to so many people cutting in 
     front of me, I was in that line for his whole set).
     
     Best moment:  When the lights first got cut and we went into 
     discoball-and trippy lights world.  One wall of visuals would have 
     made it super peach, but it was really cool in it's own dark way.
     
     Thank You's:       Harmony for a great party and for a nifty space 
     (pleasant change), SFPD for not being bigger assholes (I've seen much 
     worse ways of busting a party), the DJ's for some really good music 
     (you were all the shit!), everybody who "let me in" while they were 
     too high and too scared, and everybody I talked to, danced with, etc.  
     All my bitching aside, there were some beautiful people having a 
     magnificent time and sharing in life, experience and love.
     
     No Thank You's:    Whoever stole the red ski hat right off my head and 
     walked out the door never to be seen again (I saw it happen, I just 
     thought it was somebody I knew and that they were picking on me).
     
     AND A SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL THE PEOPLE I AFTERPARTIED WITH!!!!
     
     Especially Alex and Noah for spinning some great stuff!!!
     
     NEVER QUIT!!!!
     
     Peace,
     AndyW

	Yes, it is hard, fast and uncompromising, that is why I like it ;)
Though, I wonder what you mean by gabber being insular.  Is my viewpoint
the same as the Adias decked out skin in Rotterdam or Frankfurt? What
about the dread-headed traveller up in Scotland?

	Granted this is true of a lot of what comes out, but album's like
Lenny Dee's Emotion Response (yes Lenny Dee doing something that is not
completely hard, noisy, and angry) and Wedlock's Ganjaman and that one
Semtex EP I had covered just about all the ranges of slower techno in
terms of emotional weight conveyed, the driving energy of the tracks, and
the smile parts will bring to my face (ok, this is really subjective and
you have to know me pretty well to know what will and what will not do
this).... It really depends on the production and the aim of whoever is
laying down the track - I can point to tons more shitty house than I could
ever point to what I call good house, most people can point to more shitty
trance than they could to good trance (or wouldn't djs be carrying 50
record boxes because they have so much good material).
	Thing is, just about anywhere you go, the good stuff always seems
to be buried deep in the record crates among tons of poorly put together
stuff... I know a lot of people like the gabber I don't like for the
reasons I do not like - it's either full of attitude or has been so poorly
produced that the kick drum has lost all of its presence in the track... 
I can understand both reasons for liking those forms but I do not like
those forms being the "definitive" gabber types, I definitely cannot go
into someplace like Flop or District 23 or Avalanche (some records shops I
get good stuff in) and read the little review of what type of music is on
the disc in the corner and then go with my stack to the listening
stations, because first there is no little thing in the corner and second
gabber is shoved into the "techno" or hardcore bin. Granted, I listen to
more of what is out there over here, but I find none of what I am really
looking for... 

	But this has all moved off topic, gabber is portrayed as the music
of rasict or fasict skinheads in Europe. Gabber is music that skinheads go
out and dance to in Rotterdamn, Amsterdam, parts of Germany;  whether
those skins are facist or racist, I think we would need to go over with an
openmind to their culture and see if we are just moving our definitions of
what skins are to their culture... Gabber is also played at the free
festis, in little sweaty clubs with jungle netting hung all around with a
jazzy swingy type band upstairs in the ambient? room, in horrid clubs
(what I call horrid) that have tons of neds trying to be hard, eyeing you
up and down from the little doorholes when the club lets out (shivers go
up my spine)... But guess what, it isn't the only music most of these
groups listen to... Gabber covers a wide range of hard, fast, and pretty 
aggressive (my use of aggressive comes from webster:
   2a: marked by driving forceful energy or initiative,
   2b: marked by obtrusive energy
    3: HARSH, INTENSE) music, there are different sounds to gabber and 
each will pull you in a different way - I like it because I have seen it 
pull (maybe push is a better term in this case) people together like nothing 
else...

Craig Roseberry, "the boy most likely to", C&S / Adrenalin Records, New York,
NY  212.253.9613x14  cnsrecords@aol.com.  I have avoided writing this for
some time, but, there's sooo much to say!  So here goes...Hope everyone had a
wonderful holiday.  Thanks to all of those who gave us much love in '96!  And
to everyone else, look for us to blow up in "97!  On your desk soon will be Si
gnify, the new full length from London's space-rock, avant jazz, electronic
experimentalists' Porcupine Tree.  Prog-rock alive in 1997? Who knew?! Chill
into the new year with Night Shift - a dope compilation of laid back trip
hop, electro, and ambient grooves featuring:  The Chemical Brothers, DJ
Spooky, Baby Buddah Heads, and more. Radio will buzz with Soul Tequila, the
smokin', 100% pure funk and rare groove debut from the Soul Providers (think
vintage JB's).  And if all that wasn't enough, Adrenalin comes back at ya
with the long anticipated debut from Manchester's Cotton Club.  For all those
wax heads, the double 12", "Hear The Drummer" & the ultra rare "Nu Jack" 12",
should more than satisfy (the album is gonna be the bomb!).  If you want to
get serviced with vinyl, call me.  Look out for new releases from:  The
Tweakers (12"), DJ Ed (12"), De Donatis III (12"), Stryke (lp "Reality Base")
and, of course, a wicked compilation from DJ Hardware called Rhythm Chamber...
Until next time...I'm out!

Which means I'm missing:

        .
        .
        .
        -and all y'all.

anyway, europe will be great but I'll miss everyone here, and I can't wait
to see you at acid breaks or meridian or whatever the hell greg has in
store for january... something BIG. =)))

I will not have access to e-mail while I'm gone so if you want a timely

Hi all,

Just tuning in from NYC for the next couple of days to see what you all had
to suggest for the night of the 21st...

My eyes lit up when I saw that Alex Patterson will be playing the Gathering
reunion...but not knowing the scene in SF, I don't know if it will be worth
going to.

I tend to like mostly trance and acid...so does that sound like the party
for me??

And yes, I'm the dork that posted about a month ago...I was so thrilled to
have my plane ticket in hand, I jumped ahead a bit too soon. (Thanks for
all your suggestions back then, too!)

But here's the deal...I'm going to drag my two extremely cool and mello
brothers out with me so it's really important that I try and find the right
vibe...cuz they're totally new to this and I don't want to haul them to
some tiny party where they'll be too intimidated to get at it! Plus they're
slightly older than your average raver (uh, just what is an "averge
raver??"),  so I'm thinking lots of variety, not too small, and I'm not
going to overwhelm them with any drugs...I think the whole thing will be a
big enough trip for them.

So please e back if you think I'm on the right track with this
party....also, I've tried calling the number...anyone know any details yet
(at least if tix need to be got, or when the address might be offered up?)

Also, feel free to suggest any other parties you think might be good, just
in case I need a back up!

Thanks SO much, this is going to make my night and probably change my bros
forever!!

-Suzanne

I have a phone number...

To an underground party that some nice ravish gal gave me...

It looks pretty hardcorish and I've NEVER heard of this event before
(which makes it 'o' such fun...)

                 ,and it's on Saturday - same night as Gathering...

(Major points for running an UG same night as a massive)

If you're interested, I can provide you with this number....

This comparison has to do with the INTENT of the music more than anything.
The impact of the gabber styles is similar to the effect that Punk had back
in the day (and I'm old enough to remember it.) Attitudes aside, the
Rotterdam styles are completely connected with bored youth, attitude,
pissing-off your parents and the authorities, spitting, football and
copious amounts of amphetamines. Leaving football out of the equation, not
that different from Punk really.

I found all these after a girl posted that alien head link on this list.

The main thing that bugs me is how all this stuff looks like the signs
in Revelations (New Testament) like (to paraphrase;)

"There will be signs in the heavens... " (last year big comet, also
collision of another comet into Jupiter, face on mars)  "All eyes will
see him...  "Like the lightning from east to west...etc."

This Hale-Bobb companion has huge spikes sticking out of opposite
sidesalmost like Saturn's rings but from the sides.   To most
astronomers it appears to be traveling with the comet.

I don't want to lecture re religion (I'm more of a Taoist myself) but
even athiests will be praying after checking the above sites out.

Just more reasons to drop out of the world domination system and go
underground...  small rave cells...  email links...  need to know...
survival research...  don't be so drugged and partied out that we snooze
while paramilitary govt's take over.

Read up on the law in England that allows rounding up ravers with
martial law and no civil rights.  Police use similar tactics and laws to
shut down partys here--that's why we left England (or wherever) a few
hundred years back....

I'd stock up on whipped cream...

        I've been out for a bit, work's been taking up a lot of my time and
school is right after work so I've been pretty damn busy lately. 

        I'm gettin my check friday, and it should be pretty well sized so I
think I'll go party somewhere (finally). 

        WHERE SHOULD I GO?????

        I like work a lot, I'm training on diffirent ssorts of copier
machines to repair n all out in the field. The job's good. I't giving me
good experience, but by no means would I call the potential pay with this
job a career. That's why school has to be a constant thing. I graduate Heald
in April, so that's cool. A little break, and then I'll go back to school
after the pressure of my new job is gone.

        Sorry I can't reply all too soon. . . 

Luv Ya All Babes. . . 

Aryck

 Eerrrr... this pretty much goes against the definition of "underground",
I think. SFRaves is a much more public forum than word-of-mouth, 
telephoning, or letter writing. If that "nice ravish gal" finds out
about this well-intentioned offer, there'll be no more phone numbers from
her to Adam. 

 Unless Adam only gives the number to SFRaves he's met in person and can 
vouch for... ( that would cause another bunch of hassles for Adam , tho' ).

Greetings,


 I'm hoping to take part in a private psi-trance party on New Years. I 
need transportation help and crew help. I am not making a dime on this 
party so voluteers only need apply. I'm totally upgrading the look of my 
visual show as well as it's transportability. Either a large covered 
truck or van will do. Or possibly two vehicles. 

 I can be contacted here or at the # below.

peas,

A moment of personal reflection:

1996 was easily the best year of my life! I broke up with my
ex-girlfriend (whew!), graduated from college, drove cross-country,
started working in Silicon Valley (every geek's dream), and
experienced a music scene that I had always dreamed about (raving is
just NOT the same where i used to live).

Many of you have become an important part of my life in 96...enriching
it through the friendships that we've formed. I owe quite a bit of it
to SFRaves (egads!) and to living in this beautiful city. This truly
has been a year I'll never forget.

Now if I could only figure what I'm going to do for New Year's...
I think I see a 2 hour road trip in my future...hrm. maybe...

Steve

(please excuse if you've already seen this)

 
Looking back at 1996, it was a pretty good year for dance music overall.
But that's starting to sound familiar, and now I think we aren't going
to see the likes of 1993 (or any year back to about 1987) for a long time.
 
My interests ranged pretty evenly across a good portion of the musical map,
and since I am as always unable to whittle things down to a mere Top 10
picks, herewith ten each in the Canonical Genres (including four techno
albums that each have lots of great stuff), noting that some of these
may actually be late-1995-but-who's-counting:
 
 
Alana Dante - Think Twice (Next Plateau)
Floorbanger - Five
H2O - Livin' for the Future (Liquid Groove)
House People - Music (D-Vision)
Johnick - Play the World (Henry Street)
Andrew Pearce vs Urban Soul Gallery (Damier/Trent + KMS) - Day By Day (Six6)
DJ Pierre vs. Danell - I Love the Way You Love (Emotive)
Salt City Orchestra - The Book (Paper)
Swag - Creative Biting (Jus' Trax)
Winx - How's the Music (Sorted)
 
 
Aux 88 - Exile (Direct Beat)
Brooks - Ascension (Smart)
Fred Gianelli/Daniel Bell - 1st Premonition (Supersition/Telepathic)
DJ K-1 - Metaphysica (Direct Beat)
Monolake - Magenta (Chain Reaction)
Professor Smith - Remember 48024 (XLR8R Traks)
Blood Sugar: Levels (Emissions Lo-Fi)
Detroit: Beyond the Third Wave (Astralwerks)
Dhamas: '96 (First Impression)
Relative Progress: Illustrated Primer (Deep End)
 
 
Bizzy-B - 16 Track Ting (Brain)
DJ Die - Hydroponics (Music Bizness)
Free Hand - I Can't Stop (Smooth)
Funky Technicians - Airtight (Legend)
Mind 21 - Mindz (Urban Gorilla)
One Motive - Real Solutions (Fresh86)
Phume - Freefall (Selector)
Alex Reece/Kruder & Dorfmeister - Jazz Master (Island)
The Mack - Another Playa (SOUR)
Wax Doctor - The Rise (Metalheadz)

Any ravers going to The Gathering this saturday who has an extra space
in
their car and can give a ride to me?  Driving to San Francisco from the

without worrying about drivng home and have a relaxing trip home on the
BART instead.  So if you are headed for The Gathering this saturday and
willing to give me a lift give me a call at 707-552-2894 or e-mail me.
I'll pay for your gas, tickets, glow sticks, gummi worms, E, etc...

Waiting to hear from ya!

That was a *GREAT* Show! So many bands, so much music...and yes, ORBITAL &
CHEMICAL BROS ROCKED THE HOUSE!!!! Orbital gave people a taste of fully
immersive beats with incorporated visuals that was entirely unique....You
could hear all the ravers and people gettin' down cheering big-time!
Definately the highlite of the show for me....

FYI: The Bands were
Fiona Apple, Failure, Lemonheads, Mazzy Star, Allen Ginsburg (Poet/tripper),
ORBITAL, Republica, Eels, Cake, Beck, & The Chemical Bros....

Yeah, I was curious about that as well....either way tho, they throw down
some awesome beats!
Have a Wonderful week everyone!

So, what arte everyones plans for Holidays.  For me, the 20th going to a
nice small party. 21st I'm probably going to Sacramento to help setup a
friends (BioJeff) computer, and pick up 4 15" cabinets. Then come home on
the 22nd. Work the 23rd, 24th, sleep in on Christmas, maybe watch a movie.
My mom and brothers are going north to Gridley, CA just past Orville on the
23rd to visit grandparents and since the only day I have off is the 25th, I
won't be able to go visit my grandparents. So I'm staying home alone with
only my cat this Xmas.  Not sure what New Years Eve party I'm going to yet,
but I do have the 30th thru Jan 6th off. So I'll think of something. Maybe
this would be a good time to just sit in front of the turntables and
practice.

Hi.

Okay, here's the  drill:  The RCA plugs that are hard-wired into the
turntables and connect on the other end to the mixer are tweaked and need
replacement.

I was thinking I could just go out & buy an RCA cord, splice it, and bolt
it (or whatever) into the underside of the record player.  last night I
tried to take the old boy apart, but I didn't get past 4 screws before I
started getting scared, thinking I was opening up pandora's box here.

Also, I heard from someone that the wire needs to be soldered, not bolted.

Would anyone be willing to run me through this?  I live in berkeley, I
could jam over to your house with a pizza & a six pack if you'd be
interested in showing me what screws to unscrew .

thanks,

b))m

Something like Tech 1200 FAQ or something.  I've seen it before and printed
out stuff for a friend.  It exists, but I'm not sure what it's called.

There's a 1200 tech sheets on hyperreal somewhere. I use to have it
bookmarked but not anymore. It tells you how to fix your own 1200s...maybe
someone else know where it is and can tell ya.

Hello everyone,

I would first like to thank everyone for their continued support of Wish
Wednesdays at the Bahia Cabana.  We are in our 34th consecutive week of
weekly Wednesday parties, and are stronger than ever.

I wanted to apologize to all of you who attended Wish last week, the 11th of
December.  As most of you know, we promised a big event with headlining dj
Scott Henry from Fever in Baltimore, Buzz in Washington DC, and Sm:)e
records, New York.  We worked for 3 months getting plane tickets, organizing
accomodations, transportation, etc for Scott, and we were very excited about
bringing out one of the world's top drawing dj's from the east coast.
 However, Scott came down with Pneumonia early last week and was
hosipitalized in Baltimore up until Tuesday night.  He was unable to fly the
next day, and consequently unable to make it to Wish.  Scott Henry did
however play at both Nikita on Friday and Spundae on Sunday night, and for
those of you who attended either of those shows you witnessed an incredible
show.

We found out about Scott Henry not coming to Wish, early on Wednesday, and
with little time to find a new headlining dj, other than the Wish residents,
we came up with Al-Jay from the beach raves and nightclubs of Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, who was in town visiting with some of the Hardkiss crew.
 Al-Jay played very well, and we had another great Wednesday night.

We aren't giving up on bringing Scott Henry to Wish, we are working with him
again at another attempt in the spring of '97.  Also, we are very proud to
bring you European sensation DJ and recording artist, Peter Lazonby from
London, England this Wednesday December 18th.

Wish will be closed for Christmas on the 25th, for our first wednesday off
in over 7months!  =)  After the break however, we are coming back strong on
the 1st day of the new year, with a New Year's Eve after party at Bahia
starting at 7am, and continuing through to 2am...yep those times are right!
 DJ's for the all day event will be David Michael, Shiloh, Kenneth Sol,
Henrik, MARS, Mystr-E, and lots of others, including special guest dj's?
 Come early though, as we might close in the middle of the day for a short
nap.  Call the Wishline for info - (415) 436-0663.

Take care everyone and see you at Wish!

Happy holidays.

Kenneth Sol  =)

SO sorry to spam the list with this, but I know there's plenty o' 
computer geeks out there! ;)

Here's the deal:
My 1982 PC with 5.25 drive, one program eating all its memory, and no modem 
capability finally died (it is a miracle it lasted this long!) -- the thing was laughable, really, but it 
got me through college.

Time to go shopping!  Though I'm computer literate, I know 
nothing of hardware, so I was hoping for some advice...

All I need is a cheap, no-frills, but fundamentally good machine that  
has a word processing program and a fast modem, for $500 MAX.  Does 
such a thing exist?  What should I be looking for?  I'll be hunting through the classifieds, and 
I need to know what sort of questions I should be asking...

Thanks SO much!

Signed,
Clueless and Computerless

	Easy, undo all the screws on the rubber bottom. There are what 
like 20 of them, and if I remember correctly, three sizes. Each of the 
three sizes come from a different pattern area on the bottom so it is 
pretty easy to remember which came from where... Make a map if you need to...
	Undo the plastic thing in the corner that holds the wires in place.
	Heat the solder points for all four wires and blow/clean all the 
old solder out while removing the wires without letting the solder 
make bridges over the little circuit board underneath.
	Solder the new wires on, don't melt the circuit board...
	put the crimp hold down plastic thingy back together...
	Put the bottom on, pulling all the wires through the correct holes
	Put all the screws in the right places....

Probably not a big production, but then, how much does it cost? Who is

I fixed this on a Technics1200 once--it's not that hard but if you go
inside the machine you will need to solder the lead.  Makes you wonder
why the RCA's don't plug in a piece of pro gear.

First I suggest removing the headshell and fastening the tone arm down. 
Use a box or something sturdy (a friend) to hold the 'wheels upside
down.  There aren't a million parts gonna jump out and its pretty
straightforward.  Don't rest the deck on the tone arm!!!

If this is too much for you you might try cutting the lead about six
inches from the deck and splicing a new RCA cord--but in my case the
problem was at the circuit board.

To strip the wire slice the sheath lightly with a knife or wire
snipper.  When you have about an inch of braid spread it near the cut
and pull through the inner wire.  Pull the braid taught.  You can just
wrap both leads to the spliced in wire (or solder to board) and wrap
with electrical tape.  Of course shield>shield/core>core, and it helps
to keep "Red for right"  don't cross the leads!

Soldering isn't hard and radio shack can get you a setup for $8-10.

You just touch the tip to the wire and circuit trace and flow a little
solder at the junction.  Don't over solder or over heat!!!

Afterwards you may want to reset your tone arm weights.  Check the wt.
for your cartridge (2-5 grams usually.)  Rotate the whole weight until
the tone arm hovers at a balanced position.  Hold the main weight still
and rotate the scale until it reads zero.  Now turn the entire mass to
the setting.  My Stanton 500's rate 2 g's and the less weight the less
record wear (though they may skip on a dance floor unless you go about
3-4 g's)  You also set the anti-skating to the same weight as the tone
arm.

While I'm on this subject I'd like to diss club owners who never clean
their cartridges or records (let alone replace a worn out stylus)  Radio
Shack has all the stuff you need and it's cheap compared to replacing
vinyl.  If you guest in a club I'd suggest bringing your own cartridges
'coz old dirty ones will ruin your records in one pass. 

Final tip:  Always plug AC wires with the raised/white stripe going into
the fat (negative) plug hole of the electric plug to avoid ground loops
(buzzing).  If the problem continues use ground lifts (3 prong adapters)
to lift all the grounds.  Then run a ground from the mixer to a H2O
pipe, earth ground, (or last resort)) the safety ground or screw on the
wall plug.

My recommendation (I've done it with all of my 1200 and 1210's): There's no
need to even remove the base of your decks or worry about solder. There's an
excellent chance that the cords aren't bad at or near the soldered end
because a plate and screw protect the soldered end of the cord (I've rarely
seen a short in a cord near the base of a turntable). Simply, make a clean
cut of the cord at about 3" from the plate, then strip the insulation clean
to expose roughly 1/2" of the bare wires. I'd recommend purchasing a 12' HOSA
stereo RCA cord (orange for right, grey for left) and several small threaded
electrical caps. Cut the HOSA cord in half and strip to expose the insulated
wires. Mate your new cord with your deck's cord, twist the caps on, and
voila! you've got 6' leads. Tuck the caps and a portion of your cord into the
1200's plate compartment (The hole at the base where the RCA cord comes
from). If this doesn't work, then you'll definitely have to replace the
entire cord. :) MODA

Hi all!  =)


 First of; THANKS to all the replies I recieved about my test on 
thursday! You folks are great!!! (says Tony) With all the good input I'm 
sure I'll be fine.

 Next off is I need info on The Gathering. If anyone has a file lying 
around on it could you foward it this way please?

 The second item is; someone posted their perspective on the start of 
raves in Chicago about two or three weeks ago. If anyone still has it I 
would love to get it also. Something about how it started as a response 
to high priced discos with warehouses being plentiful and free (ahhh the 
goood ol' days  ;)


 Thanks in advance.

hugz,

Aw itz jus' a low tech hookup testing the concept.  I just leave my
email checking every 1 minute and pass messages/party
announcements/shouts live on the air to DJ Penny on Radio KMUD serving
Humboldt and Mendocino counties and much of N. Cali.

Her rave show is called INFINITE SPACE and she's an English DJ who has
worked with some of the greats.

I run down the big parties from SF to VAN, give descriptions of kewl
sitez, and towards the end of the show we check out some of the more
sci-fi weird web sites.

Anyone with mixes contact me or send to her at:   INFINITE SPACE   
KMUD  POB135   REDWAY CA 95560 

I was also monitoring the mailing lists for any listeners online or just
chatting with SFRavers

Peace Out

Morning!

Yes, thats right folks I go home yesterday to find out that I have 30 days
to get out of the place I live in.  Boy, when it rains it pours!

So if anyone knows of a place that needs a roommate/dj/raver thats not to
far away, but we'll discuss that when you email me, then drop me a private
message and we'll go from there.

I guess this is my birthday/x-mas present from my current landlord! =|  How
nice!  [sarcasm]

Currently I live by Mitty high school off of Lawrence and 280.  Just to
give you all a point of orgin.

Other than that it just gives me more reason to party with you all at the
Gathering! =)

peace,

Siphon

If only it were that easy, right?  Two words of advice:  Get Involved.
Find one underground...There's one this Friday that someone posted about on
SFR.  Go to that, help carry speakers through the woods.  Bring some fire
wood, bring coffee for the crew, stay until the party's over, carry
speakers out of the woods, befriend people, ask for names, shake hands,
hug, offer your strong back or other talents to the group, bring altar
items and help set it up and light candles when they blow out, bring
insence, take pictures...Then, in return, "they" will invite you to the
next party they throw.  Do that for other groups, ask nothing in return but
knowledge of when and where the party will be...and on, and on...

It would be to easy for someone to just TELL you where the party is...

=)
Peace!

Tony

Yuck, yuck, yuck! Never use those silly electrical caps unless you know
that the wires aren't going to be moved. Those electrical caps are
appropriate for things like house wiring. If you are scared of solder, at
least use butt splices.(huhuhu Hey Beavis, he said butt-splice.)

Hey man, that's elitist!  Whaddya mean I got to *do* something before I 
am invited?  Hell, I been going out since 1989, isn;t that worth 
something?  Sheeit, I paid my dues already, now bust yourself and TELL me 
where it is.  Why should *I* have to do the hard work.  I am shy, and I 
don't approach people easily, as a matter of fact, I break out in warts 
everytime I try to talk to a DJ or something.  They get all over my 
assneck like little pissclams.  Anyway, I just hope that you and other 
elitist stop all of this "You gotta work to get undergound..." attitude 
you and others spout.

Why not do us all a favor an be quiet.  if you're not going to tell, why 
tease?  Teasing, after all, is not very PLUR at all, not at all.

I feel so dissed.  I asked someone on the hpone where hte UG was, and 
here are some of the answers that I got:

Question: "Where's the underground party at?"

Answers:
-In my pants.
-If you don't know, I can't tell you.
-You mean you didn't get a flyer?  Sorry, I can't help you.
-I dunno.
-What are you asking me for?
-You mean you don't know?
-There's a BART on 16ht & Mission, but I didn't hear of any party.  
They're gonna have a party in the BART?  Cool!

Peace out, and many many many ;)'s.

John

These threats to leave the list have just got to stop.  Tony, I know you add
to the list, but if you need to leave thats your business.  Hope to see you
around if you do.  Anyway:

Yea, you should expect to help out.  How long you've been partying doesn't
mean that much.  Gravity and the weight of the speakers does.  The winding
and unwinding of cords.  The pictures on the walls, etc.  Don't be a
spectator.  If something needs to be done, do it.  I'm sorry if you are shy,
but this is a great opportunity to overcome that fear.  I don't think anyone
was trying to be elitist.  What I read was a good example of how to get
yourself connected.  I personnally have more fun when I'm involved somehow.
A sense of accomplishment or satisfaction or something ya know.  Try it.

A big thanks to the list for your great responses to my question about the
Gathering.

As if I wasn't already excited enough just to be back on my home turf, NOW
I'm ecstatic that I stumbled on such a great party for the only night that
I'll actually be IN the city!!!!

YES!!!

See you all there!

Out from NY,
Suzanne

How to calculate your current _shaman level_ of raving to determine whether
or not you belong to the "underground".  Formula from wise old raver spirit
that appeared in the backyard one time about an hour into a trance set:

SL=(Mass of speakers carried + length of spare speaker wire currently in
trunk/age) + (3.1415927 * no. of vinyl in collection that is kept in an
earthquake,fireproof,floodproof location...squared) + (# of times per week
you spot new & creative places for DIY) + (#of burn scars from lighting
candles, insence, etc.) - (# of times you spent more than $20 to get in a
mega-commercial-party * 303) - (# of times you've wired an amp backwards)

 Actually, we all like to watch John's wartification ( at the few parties
he's actually attended after overcoming his terrible shyness ). It's
very decorative, and much better than Odo's Cardassian Neck Trick.

 Actually, I was just getting nostalgic recently for the Atomic * parties
that used to be held in the Oakland Colesium parking lot during the last
show of a Grateful Dead appearance. First rave I've been to with easy BART
access!

 Now, maybe if PHISH plays the Oakland Colesium ...

     Hello You Splendid Folk You...
     
     I've noticed when I'm having fun, people get affected by it.  I've 
     also noticed that when people have good energy around me, it increases 
     my energy.  I've also noticed that when this is most pronounced, 
     really good things start to happen.  Like people noticing and inviting 
     me to parties, or asking me to join in on ideas or really great 
     conversations or even FREE DRUGS.  Some people think I have fun at 
     parties, and maybe it adds to their fun.  Wouldn't that be nice (oh... 
     thank you for the hug that destroyed my shit mood last friday MattK).
     
     Is it underhanded or elitist to work to get into a party... no.  I 
     think it's a more honest transaction than paying for it, especially if 
     it's your mommy and daddy's money.
     
     Is a small party elitist?
     
     YES.  Almost by nature.  Not everyone can go... so how do you spread 
     the word to ONLY 80-150 people?  Well, they could be your friends, or 
     people who can afford it, or people who are wearing one red sock, or 
     people who have met both Andy Gibb and Shaun Cassidy...
     
     Grow a brain everybody. We keep talking about how massives suck, so we 
     increase the demand for attendance of small parties.  We talk about 
     parties that very few people get to as if they were the stuff of 
     legend (as I am sure some of them are).  Fact is, WE LIKE TO BE LET IN 
     ON A SECRET.
     
     We have placed such a value on small parties, but only a small amount 
     of us can go to any particular one (did anybody see how many E'd out 
     ravers were walking around the Haight after Freaky People sold out?).  
     So we can do two things... throw more parties, or start segregating 
     the scene into various music genres (goa, jungle, hardcore, house, 
     deep house, straight up techno, trance, hard trance, etc).  I would 
     much rather see lots of small parties ALL playing a variety of crazy 
     music.  I love it all... as long as it's got a heart and a groove.
     
     If you're not getting invited to these bomb parties, throw your own.  
     Even a lame party at your house can be a shitload of fun if people you 
     like to party with show up.  Fun people can have fun wherever you put 
     them together.  And that's what makes a party.
     
     I've been invited to parties by people I have never met (some through 
     this list *thankyouverymuchyoujamandilickyoursoles*).  Whoever you 
     are, and whatever you're into, there are like minded people somewhere 
     who would probably like to boogie with you.
     
     Be yourself, speak your mind, be true to yourself, stay involved.  
     Share dammit.
     
     Go to the freak parties, like an outdoor in the middle of winter (hee 
     hee hee.. anybody know where to get some of those gloves without 
     fingertips?), or a BBQ in the rain, or call that obscure number that 
     somebody you've never met before gave you.  Don't 'out' parties that 
     are word of mouth (I liked the way Adam did it... by individual 
     mailback) by posting to the whole list or by showing up with twenty 
     friends that you told.  Keep it quiet.  Keep it sweet.
     
     Peace,
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       Being alone or with a friend or two and having a good time 
     is the most "underground" party of all... anybody else here ever dance 
     in their room to a damn good mixtape?

yesterday I sent out a massage asking for help rewiring my technics....I
got at least 20 !!! responses, most from people who were willing to do the
work for me,(!) or at least talk me through it on the phone.

You guys rock my world.   I finally chose Jerimiah to be my Soldering Guru
because it was the best option for me.  But for everyone else who offered
help, thanks a million.  I truly wasn't expecting so many people to
respond.

Afterwards I was overwrought with emotion, and on my way back to the Fidget
Farm I was weeping so uncontrollably with joy that as I spun into the
dooryard I plowed right into Grandpa Fidget chopping wood, and landed poor
old Gramps in a traction.


God bless you all.

That's what Stanton recomend; however, I prefer to set mine at about 1/2. 
Your best bet is to just fuck with it until you find what wotks best for 
you. Antiskating is supposed to stop the needle from skipping forward. 
Therfore, if your needle usually skips forward use more antiskating, and 
if your needle usually skips backward use less.

Best is to drop an uncut vinyl on the platter and adjust the anti-skate till
the needle remains in place (no drifiting into or out of the record center).

Hey everyone-

	just a quick FYI for y'alls. After all the virus crap that's been 
rolling through sfraves (and the entire Net), I thought this website might 
help clear some things up (Whaddya know?!? The goverment actually IS good for

   -------------------------- [Original Message] -------------------------    
  
When dealing with viruses and virus warnings, it is perhaps better to
be safe than sorry.  When the virus is a hoax, the "damage" is the fear
and time lost responding to the warnings.  I suggest checking with the
U.S. Department of Energy CIAC virus database whenever you have concerns
about any virus.  The CIAC virus database home page is at:

http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHome.html

 
  According to the CIAC virus database the "Irina" virus is a hoax. 
CIAC's "Internet Hoaxes: PKZ300, Irina, Good Times, Deeyenda, and Ghost"
can be found at:

http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/h-05.shtml


The CIAC description for Irina is:

"The "Irina" virus warnings are a hoax. The former head of an electronic
publishing company circulated the warning to create publicity for a new
interactive book by the same name. The publishing company has apologized
for the publicity stunt that backfired and panicked Internet users
worldwide. The original warning claimed to be from a Professor Edward
Pridedaux of the College of Slavic Studies in London; there is no such
person or college. However, London's School of  Slavonic and East
European Studies has been inundated with calls. This poorly thought-out
publicity stunt was highly irresponsible. For more information
pertaining to this hoax, reference the UK Daily Telegraph at
http://www.telegraph.co.uk."


  Since viral code MUST be execute to infect a system, it is not
possible to be infected by a virus by simply reading email.  It IS
possible to be infected by an email enclosure which is an executable
file.  As with any executable file from an unknown or questionable
souce, care should be exercised before running them.  Application macro
files may seem to infect your application when simple opened but in
reality infection only occurs when they are executed perhaps by the
applications auto-execute function.

Mis-labeled, should be "How to tell if you're really at a ug!"

A few simple signs that you have gotten to the UG:
-None of your friends are there the first time around, if they are, they 
are not real "ravefriends" since they didn't help you figure out where 
the UG was in the first place.  Traitors!
-You look around and ask yourself "Is this place safe?" as you see the 
condemned signs, black widows, health warning concerning carcinogens, and 
of course, someones handily discarded bolt cutters.
-There is a funny odor, and you can't really tell what it is (for 
old-skool; remember Halloween '94, A rave Called Sharon out near Bayview, 
some stinky old warehouse, lotsa sound, plenty of odor).
-There are no lights, except for the one illuminating the dex.
-The muddies most beautiful sound you've heard , EVER!
-Everyones eyes are as big as golfballs.  No extra charge for the sweat.
-You clothes have a greyish film of unidentified origin after the shindig.
-As you approach your car you think to yourself "Hmm..I don't 
remember leaving the window down."

Yikes!

Be careful.  Take lotsa, lotsa.  And please remember, especially you 
stinky ones, BATHE BEFORE YOU RAVE.  

Peace or peas out,
John

Nevertheless, in a month or two some unwitting soul will again post a
virus warning here. The "Good Times" type viruses are truly amazing in
their survival ability.

Well, I find setting mine at about 1/2 works best... I think it's because my
finger placement from backwards to forwards tend to be a little sharper as
opposed to changing from forwards to backwards.  But thats my quirk... hence
... hence... my setting.

Hey Kids,

Turns out, those wankers Ed Rush and Trace didn't get on their plane for
tonite's gig. Fuckin' weak!

So here's the deal. Since we won't be charging $10, we'll be changing
locations so we can charge the usual $5. Stay in touch with your usual
sources, and we'll see you there!

Ciao!

Hey Dood!

Is this tonite? Let me know, since I'll be at 115 Minna for Audio
Impact. Perhaps I can drop by and say "HI".

I can think of a few posts I've seen on SFR that would qualify as a
virus.

I think it goes something like this...

Input (TOPIC);
   if TOPIC = POLITICS then run CAN0WORMS
      else 
   if TOPIC = RACIST then run UNSUBSCRIBE

I could go on but I just thought "Boy, I'm such a nerd sometimes!" :P

Well, I'm 99% sure that John's original post was meant as COMPLETE
sarcasm (note the "many, many :-)'s" note at the end of it.)  And
I'm kinda feeling that Tony's reply was also meant to be sarcastic
(although it didn't seem as blatantly so).

So let's just call John a Troll, and leave it at that. 

(And I mean Troll in the 'Net sense of the word, as opposed to
the traditional; but then again, I've never met him in person. :-) )

I like Knucklehead's virus.  That one makes sense to me :-)

For those of you who have access to the Wall Street Journal, there is a good
little article on "Penpal Greetings," "Good Times" and the other pseudo-viruses
on the bottom left of page B1 today.

Ok people, I don't know if ANY parties this weekend except for Eurotika in
Modesto.  Now I hope that some of you remeber me :-)  I'm Eric with 250
blow pops at every rave, very happy looking, talking to everyone, making
sure everyone is ok.  That would be me.  I am hoping someone out in SF rave
landcan help a fellow rave so that I don't end up at some Homey G party. 
Have a wonderful weekend.
PLUR,
Eric Vandenbroek

P.S.
Hope to see all of you at The Gathering on Saturday.

Virus this and virus that. You know, things don't have to be the way
"they" tell you it is -- as if computer viruses are something
intrinsically inherent to modern computing. There is a reality beyond
the crap commercial software they shove down your throats, and it isn't
plagued by virus susceptibility. ANd it will never come from Microsoft.

If ya wants some virus protection, the best thing to do is run a  REAL
OPERATING SYSTEM. Windows95 and NT and MacOS suck the hairy donkey
dick. They are not real operating systems, just glorified program
loaders with a bunch of lame GUI chrome that mostly gets in the way.
Since they have few notions of system-level versus user-level
protection they are very susceptible to viruses or rogue activity from
an infected user-level-program. Interpreting some mail message in your
mail reader, or running some random Java in Netscape, or
installing/running some shareware you loaded off the net etc. shouldn't
inherently make your system susceptible to software-damage.
Unfortunately, that is not the case with most Microsoft-based shitware
people run. Even worse, you can inadvertently install trojan horses and
latent viruses that you won't even know are there until it's too late
-- until your private data (e.g. your credit card numbers,
tax/financial data, correspondences, etc.) have been made accessible to
people that may wish to do you harm, or until every program you run and
all data you use are infected/corrupted, or until some special doomsday
date hits and your hard-disk gets wiped clean.

I personally prefer Linux, which is a popular Unix variant developed by
thousands of hackers internationally, security-verified by hundreds of 
wizards internationally, and is available for free (as in the source is
free for you to use/modify/sell/fix/extend). For those of you that want
something easy to install, check out www.redhat.com (RedHat Linux 4.0),
which is damn cheap, reliable, simple, and a real, professional, and
intrinsically better-protected-against-viruses OS than any of the crap
that Bill Gates is going to shit down your throat. Y'all should know
better than most that popular doesn't equate to "good" -- the
underground is where it's at.

Windows 95, NT, and MacOS are the CoolWorld of operating systems. Yeah,
they're popular, yeah every doofus with a few hundred extra $$$ can get
it, yeah you can pickup tickets for this "party" at any EggHead
software and any mall across the country ... but once you're in and
committed, chances are you're going to spend a lot more than that
$20.00 admissions fee just staying alive (all those lame anti-virus
programs are like being stuck in a no-ins-and-outs rave where they sell
you $5.00 bottles of watter and make you pay $20.00 for a mini-thin).
Why is it that people who are so insistant on being underground in
music and raves won't go underground with operating systems like Linux?
It's free, tons of free software available, and it blows away windows
95, NT, and MacOS, especially for internet related applications.

PS: some pedantic people are going to say, "but Linux is also
susceptible to viruses." Yes, it can be susceptible, and there are a
few security holes -- the problems are minor compared to the well known
holes in NT or W95... Given Linux's free source, the large
international developer community, etc -- the problems are uncovered
quickly, and fixed even more quickly, and tested by a worldwide
community for which quality secure software is a passion, rather than
"just a job." This means that security problems are discovered and
fixed far more quickly in the Linux community than the lumbering Q&A
processes used by a behemoth like Microsoft. Just like "peer review"
has increased the quality of science worldwide, "free software" and
nonproprietary source makes Linux a higher quality and more robust OS
than any of the "professional" proprietary code coming out of
Microsoft. If there's a problem in a Microsoft OS, you'll never know
because it's a proprietary trade secret, and you'll never be able to
fix it according to your schedule, or to your satisfaction. You are
given the freedom of choice to bow down to the great Micosoft, pay alms
for upgrades, and perhaps the gods of redmond will answer your prayers
in the next release. Or you can tell them to fuck off and run a real
operating system controlled by DA PEOPLE!

The following are derived from koans in "The Zen of Programming":
--------------------------------------------------------------------
One day a novice was arguing with the Master about operating systems. 
"Significant in-roads are being made in security and ease-of-use,"
claimed the novice.  "Soon, there will be no more manuals.  Programs
will be self-evident."

The Master pondered this for a moment and replied, "Last week I decided
to chop some wood for a fire, but my old axe had become dull and worn,
and since I had not treated the handle or protected it, it was infested
with termites.  So I went to the hardware store and purchased a new
one."

"Um...  That's very interesting, I'm sure, but what does that have to do
with operating systems?"  asked the novice.

"The new axe came with an eight page instruction booklet."

Operating systems are mastered through experience.  Operating systems
are protected by not letting viruses (virii?) get to them in the first
place, ie. safe computing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hearing a disturbance, the Master went into the novice's cubicle.

"Curse these personal computers!" cried the novice in anger, "I've
gotten another virus, and this OS was supposed to have the latest
advances in security!"

The Master spoke:
"There is a cycle, a rhythm to the universe.  Today one OS will be
popular, tomorrow another.  Today 500 viruses will be destroyed,
tomorrow another 500 will rise up.  To understand Life is to 
know that the rhythm exists.  To understand Zen is to live outside
this rhythm, detached from the everyday concerns of life.  Only then
can the mind be free."

"But Master, this is intolerable!"

The Master stared at the novice.  "So what will you do?"

The novice thought on this for some time, then cried, "I know!  I'll
write my own operating system!  It will be called TriNext and it will
combine all the best features of all the other OS's.  It will replace
all the others."

Suddenly the Master struck the novice on the side of his head.  It
was not a heavy blow, but the novice was nonetheless surprised.
"What did you do that for?!" exclaimed the novice.

"I have no wish to learn another OS," said the Master.

Does the UNIX community need :

"Hi Everybody.  I'm going to this Harmony party.  I'll be wearing glitter and 
suspenders and give you candy if you see me.  So if I give you candy, that's me"

Just think about who you're trying to sell.  Consequently, I'd agree, but I get 
paid to know this crap (MS/Mac).  The only UNIX box I've set up has NEVER gone 
down, and I really appreciate the OS and how solid it is but sometimes it's a 
pain in the ass to deal with...

I guess I just forget shit and type 'man' a lot... if I used it more I'd 
probably like it more.

Huh?  I can tell your head is up your butt again Neils, all that stoopid
unix talk.  Yeah, REAL secure.  Heard about a web site, run on THAT OS
(unix or some other type of emasculated OS) got it's shit shut down over
the weekend.  Unix, schmoonix.  All of this techweenie BS war crap is for
the birds.  In the end, the only two forces stopping bill gates from TOTAL
world domination is Mac OS and Netscape, period.  Unix and varieties
thereof have been or are being replaces, albeit slowly by Windows NT.  But
this is all a matter of record and quite academic (I love these unix headz,
they are some of the most religous zealots, second only to Mac users).

In any case, there are far FEWER viruses on the Mac thna any OS, bar none.

Doesn't make it a good OS by your standards, but viruses are less of a
problem for us than most other OS's, your other pointys notwithstanding.

Nice try old friend, your almost as good as me trolling for an easy catch.
Look, go find a box, load up Linux, unix, or any other nix, and watch weird
warts grow on your assneck like little liver pissclams.  It is quite
obvious to me, with all that OS religion, that they have already taken hold
on your brain.

Linux/Unix, the choice of carpal tunnel victims everywhere.

John

There's plenty of GUI front ends to Unix that can easily make it as
point-and-click as any microsoft desktop. For Linux, Caldera's desktop
is held in esteem; Red Hat Linux 4.0 has a lot of "use it right out of
the box" GUI front ends to help people administer and run programs. And
the full OS is still available under the hood for when you need to do
something the geniuses at microslotht forgot you needed.

If you're willing to pay the big bucks (as I have), the "desktop"
software on SGI's Irix and the GUI system admin tools are (IMHO) at
least as easy to use as Microsoft's NT. I know a few
secreterial/marketing types that sat down in front of an SGI
workstation and "figured it out" without having to ever type "man" ...

Why is it that when I try to be a "normal windows 95 user" I end up
spending a lot of time messing with the system directory/dictionary and
manually moving DLL's around (or reinstalling old ones) as every other
program I seem to install breaks every other working program on my
system. The coolest is when this supposedly user friendly software 
breaks right in the middle of an installation leaving me to manually
delete files from the system directory because uninstall won't work
correctly. I'd rather use "tar" myself. It's easier, and I know exactly
what it's doing, and exactly how it is breaking when things go wrong
(which they invariably do when you're using computers).

Ahh, most of these viruses attack either PC's or Unix boxes.  They do not
appear as frequently on the Mac.  Very, very, difficult to write viruses
for that OS.  IMO, a good thing.  If it were just a bit more stable.

San Francisco - On Monday, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel struck down Cold War
export restrictions on the privacy technology called cryptography.  Her
decision knocks out a major part of the Clinton Administration's
effort to force companies to build "wiretap-ready" computers,
set-top boxes, telephones, and consumer electronics.

The decision is a victory for free speech, academic freedom, and the
prevention of crime.  American scientists and engineers will now be
free to collaborate with their peers in the United States and in other
countries.  This will enable them to build a new generation of tools
for protecting the privacy and security of communications.

The Clinton Administration has been using the export restrictions to goad
companies into building wiretap-ready "key recovery" technology.  In a
November Executive Order, President Clinton offered limited
administrative exemptions from these restrictions to companies which
agree to undermine the privacy of their customers.  Federal District
Judge Patel's ruling knocks both the carrot and the stick out of
Clinton's hand, because the restrictions were unconstitutional in the
first place.

The Cold War law and regulations at issue in the case prevented
American researchers and companies from exporting cryptographic
software and hardware.  Export is normally thought of as the physical
carrying of an object across a national border.  However, the
regulations define "export" to include simple publication in the U.S.,
as well as discussions with foreigners inside the U.S.  They also define
"software" to include printed English-language descriptions and
diagrams, as well as the traditional machine-readable object code and
human-readable source code.

The secretive National Security Agency has built up an arcane web of
complex and confusing laws, regulations, standards, and secret
interpretations for years.  These are used to force, persuade, or
confuse individuals, companies, and government departments into making
it easy for NSA to wiretap and decode all kinds of communications.
Their tendrils reach deep into the White House, into numerous Federal
agencies, and into the Congressional Intelligence Committees.  In
recent years this web is unraveling in the face of increasing
visibility, vocal public disagreement with the spy agency's goals,
commercial and political pressure, and judicial scrutiny.

Civil libertarians have long argued that encryption should be widely
deployed on the Internet and throughout society to protect privacy,
prove the authenticity of transactions, and improve computer security.
Industry has argued that the restrictions hobble them in building
secure products, both for U.S. and worldwide use, risking America's
current dominant position in computer technology.  Government
officials in the FBI and NSA argue that the technology is too
dangerous to permit citizens to use it, because it provides privacy to
criminals as well as ordinary citizens.

"We're pleased that Judge Patel understands that our national security
requires protecting our basic rights of free speech and privacy," said
John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
backed the suit.  "There's no sense in `burning the Constitution in
order to save it'.  The secretive bureaucrats who have restricted these
rights for decades in the name of national security must come to a
larger understanding of how to support and preserve our democracy."

	Reactions to the decision

"This is a positive sign in the crypto wars -- the first rational
statement concerning crypto policy to come out of any part of the
government," said Jim Bidzos, President of RSA Data Security, one of
the companies most affected by crypto policy.

"It's nice to see that the executive branch does not get to decide
whether we have the right of free speech," said Philip Zimmermann,
Chairman of PGP, Inc.  "It shows that my own common sense
interpretation of the constitution was correct five years ago when I
thought it was safe to publish my own software, PGP.  If only US
Customs had seen it that way."  Mr. Zimmermann is a civil libertarian
who was investigated by the government under these laws when he wrote
and gave away a program for protecting the privacy of e-mail.  His
"Pretty Good Privacy" program is used by human rights activists
worldwide to protect their workers and informants from torture and
murder by their own countries' secret police.

"Judge Patel's decision furthers our efforts to enable secure electronic
commerce," said Asim Abdullah, executive director of CommerceNet.

Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington-based Internet advocacy group, hailed the
victory.  "The Bernstein ruling illustrates that the Administration
continues to embrace an encryption policy that is not only unwise, but
also unconstitutional.  We congratulate Dan Bernstein, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, and all of the supporters who made this victory
for free speech and privacy on the Internet possible."

"The ability to publish is required in any vibrant academic discipline,"
This ruling re-affirming our obvious academic right will help American
researchers publish without worrying," said Bruce Schneier, author of
the popular textbook _Applied Cryptography_, and a director of the
International Association for Cryptologic Research, a professional
organization of cryptographers.

Kevin McCurley, President of the International Association for
Cryptologic Research, said, "Basic research to further the
understanding of fundamental notions in information should be welcomed
by our society.  The expression of such work is closely related to one
of the fundamental values of our society, namely freedom of speech."

	Effect of the decision

Judge Patel's decision today only legally applies to Prof. Bernstein.
Other people and companies are still technically required to follow
the export restrictions when speaking or publishing about
cryptography, or when speaking or publishing cryptographic source
code.  However, the decision sends a strong signal that if the
government tried to enforce these rules against other people, the
courts are likely to strike them down again.

Judge Patel has specifically not decided whether the export controls
on object code (the executable form of computer programs which source
code is automatically translated into) are constitutional.  Existing
export controls will continue to apply to runnable software products,
such as Netscape's broswer, until another court case challenges that
part of the restrictions.

	Background on the case

The plaintiff in the case, Daniel J. Bernstein, Research Assistant
Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, developed an
"encryption algorithm" (a recipe or set of instructions) that he
wanted to publish in printed journals as well as on the Internet.
Bernstein sued the government, claiming that the government's
requirements that he register as an arms dealer and seek government
permission before publication was a violation of his First Amendment
right of free speech.  This is required by the Arms Export Control Act
and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations.

In the first phase of this litigation, the government argued that
since Bernstein's ideas were expressed, in part, in computer language
(source code), they were not protected by the First Amendment.  On
April 15, 1996, Judge Patel rejected that argument and held for the
first time that computer source code is protected speech for purposes
of the First Amendment.

	Details of Monday's Decision

Judge Patel ruled that the Arms Export Control Act is an
unconstitutional prior restraint on speech, because it requires
Bernstein to submit his ideas about cryptography to the government for
review, to register as an arms dealer, and to apply for and obtain from
the government a license to publish his ideas.  Using the Pentagon
Papers case as precedent, she ruled that the government's "interest of
national security alone does not justify a prior restraint." Under the
Constitution, he is now free to publish his ideas without asking the
government's permission first.

Judge Patel also held that the government's required licensing
procedure fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.  When the
Government acts legally to suppress protected speech, it must reduce
the chance of illegal censorship by the bureacrats involved.  Her
decision states, "Because the ITAR licensing scheme fails to provide
for a time limit on the licensing decision, for prompt judicial review
and for a duty on the part of the ODTC to go to court and defend a
denial of a license, the ITAR licensing scheme as applied to Category
XIII(b) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the
First Amendment."

She also ruled that the export controls restrict speech based on the
content of the speech, not for any other reason.  "Category XIII(b) is
directed very specifically at applied scientific research and speech on
the topic of encryption."  The Government had argued that it restricts
the speech because of its function, not its content.

The judge also found that the ITAR is vague, because it does not
adequately define how information that is available to the public
"through fundamental research in science and engineering" is exempt
from the export restrictions.  "This subsection ...  does not give
people ... a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited." The
failure to precisely define what objects and actions are being
regulated creates confusion and a chilling effect.  Bernstein has been
unable to publish his encryption algorithm for over three years.  Many
other cryptographers and ordinary programmers have also been restrained
from publishing because of the vagueness of the ITAR.  Brian
Behlendorf, a maintainer of the popular public domain "Apache" web
server program, stated, "No cryptographic source code was ever
distributed by the Apache project.  Despite this, the Apache server
code was deemed by the NSA to violate the ITAR."  Judge Patel also
adopted a narrower definition of the term "defense service" in order to
save it from unconstitutional vagueness.

The immediate effect of this decision is that Bernstein now is free to
teach his January 13th cryptography class in his usual way.  He can
post his class materials on the Internet, and discuss the upcoming
class's materials with other professors, without being held in
violation of the ITAR.  "I'm very pleased," Bernstein said.  "Now I
won't have to tell my students to burn their notebooks."

No, none of these viruses attack UNIX boxes. To date, to the best of my
knowledge, there has never been a documented UNIX virus. Worms, Trojan
horses, and all kinds of various and sundry security exploits, but no
viruses.

As to why there are more viruses for the Mac than for the PC, it is quite
simple. It is the same reason there are so many more pieces of software
for the PC as opposed to the MAC: Programmers looked at it and said:
"Why bother?"

Niels,
    
	I find your oversimplification of alternative culture a bit
condescending, and, frankly, a little insulting.  First, who are you to
suggest that there is something wrong with raving as a youngster and then
settling down and doing a variety of different things (which may or may
not include visiting a shopping mall) when you're older?  Perhaps I won't
*want* to be running around with teddy bears and day-glo paint 10 years
from now, just as today, I don't really *want* to do the things I wanted
to do when I was twelve, and when I was twelve, I didn't want to do the
things I enjoyed doing as a two-year old.  It's called maturing and
cultivating new interests--maybe down the road, I'll be interested in
opera and archaeology, and sitting at home with my wife on a Saturday
night, just talking, or hell, even going to a mini-mall and purchasing
something--if that's what I enjoy, will you have the right to call me a
"drone?"  
	And your thinking is all muddled, too: first you say that "every
generation's coming of age music/fashion/ethos is really the same old
thing".  Okay, if that's true, and each generation of young adults' ethos
*is* the same thing, then doesn't that prove that the stage is a
developmental one?  By that corollary, wouldn't someone be in arrested
development if they *didn't* leave that stage of their development as a
human being and enjoy new ones, too?  But then, for some unknown reason,
you go ahead and CRITICIZE previous generations for leaving their youthful
years behind them!  So what are you proposing that they do?  Embrace the
"same old thing"?  You've given individuals two options, and then have the
gall to call both of them foolish.  And if that isn't disorganized logic I
don't know what is. 

	And finally, the structure of your logic aside, I don't even think
that your assumptions are correct!  Each generation's "ethos" is not the
same:  the problem with the 60s' Flower Children was that many of them
were so angry at The Evil And Demonical And Oppresive Mainstream Culture,
that they never learned how to communicate with their purported enemy.
They shouted at demonstrations, hurled everything from insults to rocks,
and were so divisive, that they were unable to gain enough credibility in
their adversaries' eyes so as to be able to persuade them of their
position.  Ravers though, I think, have taken all the beautiful ideas that
the hippies uncovered and have embraced them, emulated them, but have
never forced them down the maionstream's throat: the result?  THe rest of
the world is listening!  Rave elitists may scoff at the techno that now
appears in commercials, or the advertising slogans like "Be Happy", or the
present political climate of inclusion for all, or the fact that
advancement in telecommunications technology is finally bringing about the
idea of a global community, but these are all things that ravers have been
hoping for for a long time, and now that the mainstream is joining in,
it's proof of the power of persuasiveness, and persuasion comes POLITELY.

	So in conclusion then, what do you think it says about you that
your posts *always* seem to generate bad feelings and ill-will?  I think
it's because your tone is so caustic and oftentimes even mean.  And what
good is an idea if it's always rejected? ANd no one listens to it?  Maybe
you should try to be a little more humble, and then maybe you could make
your ideas, many of which are really cool, I think, stick.  Otherwise, why
write posts that result in a flurry of angry responses?  You don't want to
see your ideas die, do you?  So present them as they should be presented-- 
with politeness and thoughtfulness. I mean come on--you really should know
better.

Yeah that's why the director of NetOps for MSNBC dumped those NT boxes

Umm I'm sorry my botty snatchin friend, but let's face it for years and years
the backbone of the Internet was routed by big IBM boxes with romp chips.
These boxes ran the legendary GateD software which _only_ runs under unix.


I have ALL three platforms in use in my company.  The breakdown is as follows:

Mac-			Accounts manager, interns, graphic design
Windows NT	My desktop, I run all the MS shit like Office, Photoshop, Internet Billing software, Business Plan Pro, etc. I also run
an X-windows server so I can talk to....

My 7 Suns running Unix which handle :

		webservers (Apache )
		sendmail (mail for 100+ domains)
		inn	netnews
		DNS for 100+n domains
		pop mail servers for 30 domains
	  	NOCOL network monitoring software
		IPWATCH to monitor net traffic across my lan.
		Tpage paging software.
		GCC for compiling all of the freewear that I use to keep my site running.

Let's be real here, and please get you figures right, the reason that it was reported that Mac make up 60% of the web servers on
the net is because the stooopid
reported thought Apache was a webserver that only ran on the Mac :)

Now I don't mind the mac, in fact I'm getting a new Mac clone in about a month...
It'll be running BeOS.

Um, the reason why you are at your terminal now and not in a rice patty in Vietnam
or on the russian front is because those "flower children" hurled insults and rocks and got shot at and killed at Kent State and
finally America listened.

It's a lot easier to be polite when you don't have your Uncle pushing an M-16 in your hand 
and loading you on a C-130.  The young people of today do have the apparent luxury of 
being polite. And it is true that you can win over more people with love then with violence, 
but bear in mind that in 1974 I had a number assigned to my name, it was my draft lottery 
number attached to my birth date, my number was 234, doubtful that I was going, even if 
the war had lasted . My friends who were a year older then me had 34 and 78 respectively, 
they were out of high school and did not do well on their SATs, they were about to go 
enlist in the Air Force (cuz you could choose your assignment, maybe) when finally, an 
NVA tank bashed through the US Embassy gate in Saigon and the war was over.  I guess 
that tank wasn't too polite.  But when someone comes 10,000 miles to your country, turns
your women into whores and your rice fields into death traps and then accuses you of 
agression, well  I guess you could get a little riled up :)

Actually, Macs have long been prone to many relatively benign viruses.
Until mid-1995, I'd say that there were more viruses per capita (or per CPU,
I suppose) in the Mac realm than on PCs.  In fact, I didn't even observe a
real live PC virus until early 1994 (a copy of the classic Stoned).  Now
I'd guess that probably 10% to 20% of all PCs have at least one, and
probably half that percentage on Macs.

Unix is relatively untouched by viruses, though Linux boxes and others running
on PCs are at least vulnerable to boot sector viruses (BSVs) if booted from
an infected disk.  Same for NT.  DOS and Windows programs running within the
NT environment can be infected, but NT's protected-kernel architecture prevents
BSVs -- the most common type -- from infecting the system.  As NT becomes more
widespread, no doubt native NT viruses will be written, but the technical
hurdles are considerable since you can't boot NT directly from a floppy.
Other non-BSVs could develop, though.  

Macro viruses are quite common too, and run on whatever platform the app might
run on.  This gives new credence to the sarcastic acronym my friend Randal
Schwartz gives to a certain hot new programming language: Just Another
Virus Attractor.  It's true that the Java bytecode system for online apps is
designed not to let any nasty stuff happen to your system, and it's also true
that there are holes in its security scheme.  

The worst thing is that as we become more dependent on GUIs that hide and even
deliberately lock away the internals of our systems from us, we become more
vulnerable to viruses.  And *that*, my friends, is one of the true legacies
of the Mac OS.

I should clarify one little point that was unclear in my last screed on
viruses.  NT is not vulnerable to boot sector viruses directly because it can't
(as I stated subsequently) be directly booted from a floppy.  But just as with
Linux, BSDI, Netware and other OS which either require DOS to boot or can be
dual-booted under DOS, the DOS BSVs like AntiCMOS can, obviously, infect those
systems and pose a risk in future DOS sessions (though Linux, Netware and NT
and so on prevent them from doing anything once DOS is out of the way).

Couldn't possibly be the fact that Netscape is so poorly written that it
REQUIRES a large memory model to run?  Nah, couldn't be ;).

As for your other nonsense about Macs, it figures YOU and other UNIX
nutcases would say something like that.  Just face the facts weeneies, your
shit is being replaced by NT, and there ARE few people to stop him.  So be
nice, or else you will be in the fight by yourself.  And we KNOW who will
win.  ;)

Out,

John (who has seen a dozen crashes from poorly written software).

With system 7.5.1,2,3, or 5....Doh!! where the hell did my memory go, what
to you mean I have to reboot to get my memory back....7.5.5 was supposed to
fix that problem.  Keyword "Suppose to".

All I have to say is that NTRIGUE is all you need. For any platform. It can
deliver "95, NT, 3.x to all desktops..ie  PC, X terminal, UNIX, MAC,
network computers, and even JAva Desktops eithier local or remote. You can
access any windows based app directly or from a web page on the internet or
intranet. It has extensive network support...TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, Appletalk,
NetBEUI, Lan Manager, NFS, ICA,WINS, DHCP and more.   It's a pretty good
software package for just about any user on any platform. If you want to
know more about it, just ask. I'll give you some of the info I have on it.

Unlike many of you, I was alive at the time and quite able to read the newspaper and watch telivision. First of all, there were no
molotov cocktails being thrown at the Guardsman.  Second of all, rubber bullets (which were available at the time were not being
used) third it was not an individual guardsman's decision but that of the commanding officer.  The fact that the NG was dispatched
in the first place for a civil disturbance of that nature should have been brought into question.   Where do we draw the line? bear
in mind that some of us have been at FMRs where the police don riot shields and battons and bring out dogs,
just for a bunch of people dancing.

     funny.  that [mr. spock linked with drugs] show showed me how many 
     times over again history has repeated itself.  we think this drug war 
     is new?  NOT.  there have been drug wars as long as there has been 
     societies.  why am i not surprised that we are still wallering in 
     these pointless affairs.

        you know, we should all be picking a nice safe place in the hills or the
outskirts of town somewhere that we (individually) could go in case there is 
some kind of invasion.  it may never happen, but you never know.

hello all-

[warning:  statistically, topics that are believed by matt to be rave related tend to be interpreted by most as non rave related.  read with caution, and direct all flames to /dev/null.  -mdpkl]

this is matt's message to stressed out ravers-computer geeks-students:   DON'T GET MONO!  PROTECT YOURSELF!!!  NO PAPER, PROJECT, PARTY, OR OTHER COMMITTMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HEALTH.

i'm kinda pissed at a society that teaches us that our committments are more important than our health, that it's perfectly justified for a student to not sleep during finals, that a boss has every right to instruct an employee to not sleep and to finish a project.

because of the way i've bought into these attitudes that production is more important than health, i've got a mild case of mono.  it sucks.  that raise is not worth it, that grade is not worth it, that committment is not worth it.

thanks for listening to matt's griping for the day.  now return to your normal routine.

love to you all-

matt

Well, I just barely tapped into my e-mail when your post caught my eye.  I
am a parent (23) in that Post-adolescence stage, I guess if that's what you
want to call it. Even though I'm pretty young I don't look like a raver
during the day.  My typical look is a pair of jeans and a shirt.  My
appreciation for the rave scene is shown by just attending a rave and
enjoying the music and the people. Sometimes I do feel like me and the
youth around me are in two seperate worlds, only because of my experience.
But then again, I think about my old "youth culture" and say been there,
done that.  Were different because of experience, and I'm still not
finished experiencing yet. Only this time my son is a part of everything I
do. He's involved with the music because daddy's a D.J. and mommy loves to
dance. He's already been to his first little "rave".  (during the day, of
course).  But as he grows older he'll be going to more raves with us.
Daddy and I definately dress normal, and at raves wear the old school
clothes, an ameba shirt and a pair of wide legged jeans, and some
Addidas's.  Nothing outrageous, just normal.  I guess when we get old I
still plan to be a part of the rave culture and hopefully my son will too.
I hope to bring him up with a talent for mixing and record knowledge, and
hopefully someday he'll make us happy and press his own label. Eitherway,
he will contribute someway to rave culture.  No I don't think you'll see me
with a pacifier in my mouth, or a stuffed animal, at a rave, but my three
year old son wouldn't mind.

San Francisco - On Monday, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel struck down Cold War
export restrictions on the privacy technology called cryptography.  Her
decision knocks out a major part of the Clinton Administration's
effort to force companies to build "wiretap-ready" computers,
set-top boxes, telephones, and consumer electronics.

The decision is a victory for free speech, academic freedom, and the
prevention of crime.  American scientists and engineers will now be
free to collaborate with their peers in the United States and in other
countries.  This will enable them to build a new generation of tools
for protecting the privacy and security of communications.

The Clinton Administration has been using the export restrictions to goad
companies into building wiretap-ready "key recovery" technology.  In a
November Executive Order, President Clinton offered limited
administrative exemptions from these restrictions to companies which
agree to undermine the privacy of their customers.  Federal District
Judge Patel's ruling knocks both the carrot and the stick out of
Clinton's hand, because the restrictions were unconstitutional in the
first place.

The Cold War law and regulations at issue in the case prevented
American researchers and companies from exporting cryptographic
software and hardware.  Export is normally thought of as the physical
carrying of an object across a national border.  However, the
regulations define "export" to include simple publication in the U.S.,
as well as discussions with foreigners inside the U.S.  They also define
"software" to include printed English-language descriptions and
diagrams, as well as the traditional machine-readable object code and
human-readable source code.

The secretive National Security Agency has built up an arcane web of
complex and confusing laws, regulations, standards, and secret
interpretations for years.  These are used to force, persuade, or
confuse individuals, companies, and government departments into making
it easy for NSA to wiretap and decode all kinds of communications.
Their tendrils reach deep into the White House, into numerous Federal
agencies, and into the Congressional Intelligence Committees.  In
recent years this web is unraveling in the face of increasing
visibility, vocal public disagreement with the spy agency's goals,
commercial and political pressure, and judicial scrutiny.

Civil libertarians have long argued that encryption should be widely
deployed on the Internet and throughout society to protect privacy,
prove the authenticity of transactions, and improve computer security.
Industry has argued that the restrictions hobble them in building
secure products, both for U.S. and worldwide use, risking America's
current dominant position in computer technology.  Government
officials in the FBI and NSA argue that the technology is too
dangerous to permit citizens to use it, because it provides privacy to
criminals as well as ordinary citizens.

"We're pleased that Judge Patel understands that our national security
requires protecting our basic rights of free speech and privacy," said
John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
backed the suit.  "There's no sense in `burning the Constitution in
order to save it'.  The secretive bureaucrats who have restricted these
rights for decades in the name of national security must come to a
larger understanding of how to support and preserve our democracy."

	Reactions to the decision

"This is a positive sign in the crypto wars -- the first rational
statement concerning crypto policy to come out of any part of the
government," said Jim Bidzos, President of RSA Data Security, one of
the companies most affected by crypto policy.

"It's nice to see that the executive branch does not get to decide
whether we have the right of free speech," said Philip Zimmermann,
Chairman of PGP, Inc.  "It shows that my own common sense
interpretation of the constitution was correct five years ago when I
thought it was safe to publish my own software, PGP.  If only US
Customs had seen it that way."  Mr. Zimmermann is a civil libertarian
who was investigated by the government under these laws when he wrote
and gave away a program for protecting the privacy of e-mail.  His
"Pretty Good Privacy" program is used by human rights activists
worldwide to protect their workers and informants from torture and
murder by their own countries' secret police.

"Judge Patel's decision furthers our efforts to enable secure electronic
commerce," said Asim Abdullah, executive director of CommerceNet.

Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington-based Internet advocacy group, hailed the
victory.  "The Bernstein ruling illustrates that the Administration
continues to embrace an encryption policy that is not only unwise, but
also unconstitutional.  We congratulate Dan Bernstein, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, and all of the supporters who made this victory
for free speech and privacy on the Internet possible."

"The ability to publish is required in any vibrant academic discipline,"
This ruling re-affirming our obvious academic right will help American
researchers publish without worrying," said Bruce Schneier, author of
the popular textbook _Applied Cryptography_, and a director of the
International Association for Cryptologic Research, a professional
organization of cryptographers.

Kevin McCurley, President of the International Association for
Cryptologic Research, said, "Basic research to further the
understanding of fundamental notions in information should be welcomed
by our society.  The expression of such work is closely related to one
of the fundamental values of our society, namely freedom of speech."

	Background on the case

The plaintiff in the case, Daniel J. Bernstein, Research Assistant
Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, developed an
"encryption algorithm" (a recipe or set of instructions) that he
wanted to publish in printed journals as well as on the Internet.
Bernstein sued the government, claiming that the government's
requirements that he register as an arms dealer and seek government
permission before publication was a violation of his First Amendment
right of free speech.  This is required by the Arms Export Control Act
and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations.

In the first phase of this litigation, the government argued that
since Bernstein's ideas were expressed, in part, in computer language
(source code), they were not protected by the First Amendment.  On
April 15, 1996, Judge Patel rejected that argument and held for the
first time that computer source code is protected speech for purposes
of the First Amendment.

	Details of Monday's Decision

Judge Patel's decision applies throughout the country until and
unless it is overturned by a higher court.

It is not yet clear from the decision whether the export controls on
object code (the executable form of computer programs which source
code is automatically translated into) have been overturned.  It may
be that existing export controls will continue to apply to runnable
software products, such as Netscape's broswer, until another court
case challenges that part of the restrictions.

Judge Patel ruled that the Arms Export Control Act is a prior restraint
on speech, because it requires Bernstein to apply for and obtain from
the government a license to publish his ideas.  Using the Pentagon
Papers case as precedent, she ruled that the government's "interest of
national security alone does not justify a prior restraint."

Judge Patel also held that the government's required licensing
procedure fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.  When the
Government acts legally to suppress protected speech, it must reduce
the chance of illegal censorship by the bureacrats involved -- in this
case, the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls.  Her
decision states, "Because the ITAR licensing scheme fails to provide
for a time limit on the licensing decision, for prompt judicial review
and for a duty on the part of the ODTC to go to court and defend a
denial of a license, the ITAR licensing scheme as applied to Category
XIII(b) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the
First Amendment." Professor Bernstein is now free to publish his ideas
without asking the government's permission first.

She also ruled that the export controls restrict speech based on the
content of the speech, not for any other reason.  "Category XIII(b) is
directed very specifically at applied scientific research and speech on
the topic of encryption."  The Government had argued that it restricts
the speech because of its function, not its content.

The judge also found that the ITAR is vague, because it does not
adequately define how information that is available to the public
"through fundamental research in science and engineering" is exempt
from the export restrictions.  "This subsection ...  does not give
people ... a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited." The
failure to precisely define what objects and actions are being
regulated creates confusion and a chilling effect.  Bernstein has been
unable to publish his encryption algorithm for over four years.  Many
other cryptographers and ordinary programmers have also been restrained
from publishing because of the vagueness of the ITAR.  Brian
Behlendorf, a maintainer of the popular public domain "Apache" web
server program, stated, "No cryptographic source code was ever
distributed by the Apache project.  Despite this, the Apache server
code was deemed by the NSA to violate the ITAR."  Judge Patel also
adopted a narrower definition of the term "defense article" in order to
save it from unconstitutional vagueness.

The immediate effect of this decision is that Bernstein now is free to
teach his January 13th cryptography class in his usual way.  He can
post his class materials on the Internet, and discuss the upcoming
class's materials with other professors, without being held in
violation of the ITAR.  "I'm very pleased," Bernstein said.  "Now I
won't have to tell my students to burn their notebooks."

In 85 Mac's had MIDI sequencing programs and sample editing programs for
the EMU Emulator I, which for about 6-10 grand gave you the power of a
$50,000 Fairlight CMI

The GUI was basically the same as OS 7.5.5

The IBM PC had amber monitors that looked worse than the Commodore 64
with the stupid DOS command line.  Microsoft bought the system from some
guy in Seattle for about $30,000 after IBM threw together off the shelf
parts for their first PC, waking up to the fact that the C64, Apple and
Mac created a new market.

The average user is not a computer science major so now Windoze 95
virtually xeroxed Apple's GUI.

It's ironic that Apple became IBM after the 1984 commercial.

How about a clone from Woz and Jobs, made by Motorola & Sony?

This party was the shit! 115 Minna Street is MUCH MUCH better than the 
cocodrie... No nasty security guards shining a flashlight in your faces, 
MUCH MUCH more room to dance, um was it me or was it louder too? Doubt 
it, it was Gateway systems like last time, the music blasted out onto 
the street... NO BAR (yay!) and thus no rude drunk people. It started up 
slow, we got there fairly early, and thought "hmmm i dunno," but as 
usual, the place kicked up arould 11, 11:30... 
	The party had some fouls beyond the control of the b.a.s.s. kru, such 
as Ed Rush and DJ Trace missing their flight (bastards) and sometime in 
the night the mixer busted, and we thought that the party would be over 
incredibly early. But no, the b.a.s.s. kru found another location for 
the party so it could return to $5 without Rush and Trace, and when the 
mixer busted, someone went 6 blocks to get another one, and the party 
started up just where they left off. MAJOR PROPS to the b.a.s.s. kru for 
that one! I know that other parties might have given up by the time the 
mixer busted.. Abstract and Flux's sets stood out in my mind that night 
for some reason (perhaps because they kicked ass? yes, i think so!) 
	All in all, the night was a great night. The jungle was hard, lots of 
beautiful bass, synth and rolling, or hard and bumpin.. Loud enough to 
rattle your body and get you on the dance floor.. Can't wait for the 
next Audio Impact...
Smiles and Love,
LAra

I got my mom a sweater, and I got my Dad and Stepmom two tickets to one of
those dinner theater shows where the cast poses as members of the audience
and there is a murder or something and the remainder of the evening is spent
solving it.  I think they'll be pretty stoked on it.  I don't know if they
have anything like that in the City.  This one's in Sacto.  Good luck.

Well, I just barely tapped into my e-mail when your post caught my eye.  I
am a parent (23) in that Post-adolescence stage, I guess if that's what you
want to call it. Even though I'm pretty young I don't look like a raver
during the day.  My typical look is a pair of jeans and a shirt.  My
appreciation for the rave scene is shown by just attending a rave and
enjoying the music and the people. Sometimes I do feel like me and the
youth around me are in two seperate worlds, only because of my experience.
But then again, I think about my old "youth culture" and say been there,
done that.  Were different because of experience, and I'm still not
finished experiencing yet. Only this time my son is a part of everything I
do. He's involved with the music because daddy's a D.J. and mommy loves to
dance. He's already been to his first little "rave".  (during the day, of
course).  But as he grows older he'll be going to more raves with us.
Daddy and I definately dress normal, and at raves wear the old school
clothes, an ameba shirt and a pair of wide legged jeans, and some
Addidas's.  Nothing outrageous, just normal.  I guess when we get old I
still plan to be a part of the rave culture and hopefully my son will too.
I hope to bring him up with a talent for mixing and record knowledge, and
hopefully someday he'll make us happy and press his own label. Eitherway,
he will contribute someway to rave culture.  No I don't think you'll see me
with a pacifier in my mouth, or a stuffed animal, at a rave, but my three
year old son wouldn't mind.

Happily Addicted to the Web
 ---------------------------
 (to the tune of "Winter Wonderland")

 Doorbell rings, I'm not list'nin',
 From my mouth, drool is glist'nin',
 I'm happy--although
 My boss let me go--
 Happily addicted to the Web.

 All night long, I sit clicking,
 Unaware time is ticking,
 There's beard on my cheek,
 Same clothes for a week,
 Happily addicted to the Web.

 Friends come by; they shake me,
 Saying, "Yo, man!
 Don't you know tonight's the senior prom?"
 With a listless shrug, I mutter, "No, man;
 I just discovered letterman-dot-com!"

 I don't phone, don't send faxes,
 Don't go out, don't pay taxes,
 Who cares if someday
 They drag me away?
 I'm happily addicted to the Web!


 The Bill Gates Song
 -------------------
 (to the tune of "The Christmas Song")

 Netscape roasting on an open fire,
 Apple begging on its knees,
 Photo popping up on Time magazine,
 Yes, Bill Gates dreams of days like these!
 Everybody knows he's never fully satisfied,
 Throws himself behind each task,
 World dominion is his company's goal.
 Well, hey, is that so much to ask?
 He knows the world is in his sway,
 We'll buy whatever software he might toss our way,
 We'll surf his Internet, watch his TV,
 He'll take us anywhere we ask him--for a fee.

 And so we're offering this simple prayer,
 To Bill and all his MS grunts:
 Since we all follow any standard you write,
 Make it good, please,
 Make it good, please,
 Make it good, please, just once!


 Microsoft
 ---------
 (to the tune of "Jingle Bells" starting with 
"dashing thru the snow...")

 Nine-tenths of a gig,
 Biggest ever seen,
 God, this program's big--
 MS Word 15!
 Comes on ten CDs,
 And requires--damn!
 Word is fine, but jeez--
 60 megs of RAM?!

 Oh! Microsoft, Microsoft,
 Bloatware all the way!
 I've sat here installing Word
 Since breakfast yesterday!
 Oh! Microsoft, Microsoft,
 Moderation, please.
 Guess you hadn't noticed:
 Four-gig drives don't grow on trees!


 I'm Dreaming of a Clean System
 -------------------------------
 (to the tune of "White Christmas")

 I'm dreaming of a clean System,
 Something that fits on one CD.
 Each component matches,
 Not bits and patches,
 Unlike 7-5-point-3.
 I'm longing for a dream System,
 Small, stable, fast, and trouble-free.
 What we want, I think you'll agree,
 Is called System 6-point-oh-3!


 Violent Night
 -------------
 (to the tune of "Silent Night")

 Silent Mac, broken Mac!
 System bombed, screen went black.
 Books suggested things; I tried 'em all:
 Shift key, desktop file, clean reinstall.
 Now my deadline is tight,
 This Mac's been silent all night.

 Violent night, horrible night!
 Lost my cool, filled with spite,
 Threw my Mac through the balcony door
 Watched it fall from the 20th floor,
 Now I'm sleeping in peace;
 Thank God I had it on lease.


 Prove It's So!
 --------------
 (to the tune of "Let It Snow")

 Oh, the papers say Apple's dying,
 But before we start good-byeing,
 We should call them all up and go,
 "Prove it's so! Prove it's so! Prove it's so!"

 They say "Mac OS software's scarcer."
 We say, "Read those numbers, there, sir,
 Sales continued this year to grow.
 There ya go, there ya go, there ya go!"

 When they tell us Win 95
 Made the Mac's famed advantages ebb,
 We'll say, "Why, then, do Macs now drive
 60 percent of the Web?"

 We can win our PR reversal--
 Make the Mac be universal--
 Though we may have some years to go,
 Make it so, make it so, make it so!


 Gil Amelio's Coming to Town!
 ----------------------------
 (to the tune of "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town")

 You better watch out,
 Absurd as it sounds,
 'Cause Apple's about
 To lose a few pounds--
 Gil Amelio's coming to town!

 He's making a list,
 And trimming the rolls
 Of projects that missed
 Their revenue goals--
 Gil Amelio's coming to town!
 He knows what's losing money,
 Like eWorld, PowerTalk . . .
 You'd better make your project work
 Or prepare to take a walk!

 Though you follow his lead
 Right out the back door,
 You know he'll succeed--
 He's done it before!
 Gil Amelio's coming to town!


 God Rest Ye Copland Programmers
 -------------------------------
 (to the tune of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen")

 God rest ye Copland programmers,
 It's finally Christmas Day.
 You've all worked 20-hour shifts
 Beginning back in May.
 No wonder after such neglect
 Your spouses moved away.
 The last real meal you had
 Was late last year--
 That's what we hear;
 And since then you've lived on
 Pizza, Coke, and beer.

 Your bosses change, and change their minds,
 Is Copland off or on?
 Are last week's OS plans in place
 Or now completely gone?
 God rest ye well this Christmas Day,
 You'd better sleep in late--
 It's the last sleep you'll get till '98.
 Isn't that great?
 It's the last day off you'll have till '98!

hello all unix people-

[standard nrr disclaimer: send all flames to /dev/null]

this is an odd favor to ask-

does anyone who used procmail have a .procmailrc file they could send me to use as a basis for making my own?  especially one that sorts mail into folders and does (gasp!) kills.  i just want to look at someone's file, and use it as a template for my own.

anyone secure enough in their unix ability to help?

thanks, and love to you all-

matt l

Well my parents are very cool. My sister and I always pick a theme for
them. This year it's lunch boxes. My mom was the type that would make
our lunches everyday for school and in them she would right little notes
on our napkins(cute huh!) and she would cut out comic stripes too. 
So this year I bought her an old vintage lunch box and my sister and I
are going to put all sorts of goodies in it that tell her how much we
appreciate all the cool things she did while we were growing up. We
bought my dad an original Lone Ranger lunch box, well because he knows
the theme by heart and he always called me Tonto. 
I say pick a theme and have fun with it.

But it ain't 1985 anymore....

For the record my favorite computer ever was an Apple: 2e, the only good
computer Apple ever came out with. The only one that was true to the
nature of the founders of the company. You want access to all the good
stuff inside? Pop the cover off. No screws, no guy in a suit that has to
come on site to do it for ya, etc....

Well its been fun, but now its time to go.  At least for a few months anyway.
I'll be going to The Gathering this Saturday and to the Cloud Factory party
for New Years and then I'll be returning to school on the east coast.  I'll 
probably check in every once in a while to see what you guys are up to but I 
will mostly be concentrating on school.  I may throw a party while I'm in
Pittsburgh so watch for that if you feel like taking a vacation.  And if you
are ever in Pittsburgh for any reason look me up.   My email address will 
probably be jwiley@andrew.cmu.edu but sending it to Jay.Wiley@andrew.cmu.edu
will work.

Thanks to everyone and if I don't see you at one of the above parties I'll see
you in June.

        Funny that you should mention "xerox", because Apple
stole all their ideas from the Smalltalk project at Xerox PARC.

	It is only karmically just that somebody else should then
steal "Apple"s GUI and render thereby render them obscure by comparison.

	And, in closing I'd just like to add:

	SMALLTALK IS THE ONE TRUE OS!!!

	SMALLTALK IS ALSO THE ONE TRUE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!!!!

	SMALLTALK UBER ALLES!!!!

Hey!

It looks as though some of us in SFR-Land want to exchange some, ahem,
"good cheer" on Saturday...

So Instead of talkin'  Lets get down to planning!!! 
I say we meet somewheres (ie coffie shop)  in The City or east bay
(Berkley is always a good choice) around 7 -8 ish or so and motor to
someones pad to exchange, um... "gifts".


I don't know where any of you's are but.. Im sure we can come to a
common ground by Saturday...

As with ususal gift exchanges - lets keep it to a reasonable medium. But
of course, the more the merrier...

" ok, who has the pad?"

If you're running a real operating system, you should be able to run
*ANY* software on your system, no matter how badly written, and it
shouldn't be able to do anything worse than crash the program (not the
whole computer) or corrupt your own personal file-space. When the usual
user-level-program crashes the whole computer, requires you to reboot
your system, or can corrupt system-level files (including boot sectors,
other applications, DLL's etc) then you're not running on a real OS,
you're just running a glorified loader. 

On a Unix-based system, it's easy enough to enable a capability-based
protection (as opposed to the superuser-versus-user dichotomy) which
enables individual programs or calls to access a single facet of
protected system-level functionality. This idea was fully understood
and implemented as far back as the mid-60's (the classical era of
computing), but was somehow forgotten during the dark-ages of DOS and
Windows, along with the burning-at-the-stake of academic software
infidels that wouldn't bow down to the herd mentality of the mass
market and microsoft.

In the upcomping englightenment, some variants of Unix are already
doing this, including Linux. Capability-based OS's give a user an
arrays of non-overlapping capabilities based on their needs/usage which
grant them temporary access to a small subset of protected system
resource for just as long as that access is needed. THis can
significantly minimize the ability for a virus/worm/trojan-horse
inadvertently run by a user to do damage to the system, or even the
user's own personal file-space. It's too bad the dark-ages morons that
invented Java forgot this lesson (which you'd learn in the first few
weeks of any OS class) when designing their language/OS. It would be a
whole lot safer than it currently is, especially when running on
Windows/Mac/NT.

The fact that most people have actually never run software on a real
operating system leads people to accept that user-level software can
crash your computer, or hang your system in an infinite loop, or
corrupt  your system with "viruses" and that those hazards are all just
part-and-parcel with "progress." People supplicate to the misunderstood
and oft-angry gods of computing by rebooting often, or by waving around
magic disks of "anti virus software". Never suspecting that their
unwavering allegiance to the faulty gods of "Windows" and "DOS" may be
the source of their troubles and the cause of all their superstitious
behavior.

But the fact is, the OS's run by the majority of people today are WORSE
than 1960's and 1970's computer technology which solved all those
problems long before most of the new generation of self-designated
"computer geniuses" were born. Multics or Tops-20 had all the necessary
OS concepts you'd need to run safe, virus-free computing environments. 
But since we've lost the capacity to learn lessons from the past in our
headlong rush towards the future (and riches, and commercialism and
market-share/monopoly), it seems some valuable ideas were lost in the
name of progress. ANd most people are paying the price for the
foolishness of a few overzealous snake-oil salesmen/missionaries who
claimed to bring the fire of the gods down from the ivory tower and
into the hands of 'da people.

Part of the problem here is that computer engineering/science is
neither engineering or science, just a bunch of hacks that managed to
get something to work and shipped/productized the hacks w/o concern for
the monster that might have been unleashed. The self-designated
"computer wizards" rush to release often resulted in much
reinventing-of-the-wheel, often forgetting the lessons that can be
learned when you stand on the shoulders of giants that did the exact
same thing just a generation earlier.

In the midst of these dark ages, we find ourselves dealing with
computer alchemists that don't really know what they're doing (compared
to the "real" sciences and real engineering) but will wow us with
bubbling test tubes and melting oxidizing metals... And rather than
understanding what they're doing, why they're doing it, and the role
their inventions are playing in mapping out the future, they're busy
fulfilling quarterly profit-to-earnings ratios, figuring how to
undercut a competitor, and how to monopolize a market. The alchemy of
economics. In these dark ages, we're wowed with the massive twinkling
cathedrals of McNealy/Gates/Clark who will bestow "progress" upon the
unwashed masses by singing the hymn "start me up". In these dark ages,
we hope that the wizards of market-share will show us the light, invite
us into their cathedrals ... meanwhile, some try to ignore the
burning-at-the-stake of any software infidels that will not bow down to
the monopolistic forces at hand, that shout "there is a better way".

The response, fortunately, is coming from Europe, Asia, Australia, and
Japan where lots of people *ARE* ignoring the hype of Pope Gates and
running software that serves their interests, nationalities, and desire
for controlling their own destinies -- Linux.

Com'on peaple the candy fad is played out!

Everyone knows that candy use leads to drug addiction.  

Ask any heroin addict, he probably started on Hershey's kisses and
M&M's, worked his way up to  candy cigarettes, chewing gum cigars,
chocolate covered expresso beans, coffee milk, tobacco, airplane glue,
whipped cream cans, and from these stepping stones on to harder drugs
like alcohol and No Doze, ultimately leading to crack and smack.

This is part of the Peer Pressure all kids go through.

"Hey, jump off the roof and land on your head... you'll get a head
rush!"

or

"Take a drag on this, it's really cool, you'll feel like throwing up,
get a splitting headache, your lungs will feel like you poured lighter
fluid in and lit it, and then you feel like you are dying...  You'll
feel mature and can hang out with the big kids"

Besides the above candy causes lots of other health problems like
cavities, hypoglycemia, loss of vitamins, etc. etc. so substitute with
honey, Sucanat, barley malt, raisens, etc

And if you don't believe tying candy to raves is a plot look at
Halloween and Xmas...  big candy rush holidays... like we should
associate candy with fun and being a kid!

Lastly, candy at raves is a sign that people have the "munchies" which
is a sure indicator of possible drug use so please point these people
out to the nearest undercover deadhead type (these days the undercover
narcs have the hippest tie dye shirts--watch out for them!)

I was just looking at a book called  Smalltalk/VMac  Object-Oriented

Well, I just barely tapped into my e-mail when your post caught my eye.  I
am a parent (23) in that Post-adolescence stage, I guess if that's what you
want to call it. Even though I'm pretty young I don't look like a raver
during the day.  My typical look is a pair of jeans and a shirt.  My
appreciation for the rave scene is shown by just attending a rave and
enjoying the music and the people. Sometimes I do feel like me and the
youth around me are in two seperate worlds, only because of my experience.
But then again, I think about my old "youth culture" and say been there,
done that.  Were different because of experience, and I'm still not
finished experiencing yet. Only this time my son is a part of everything I
do. He's involved with the music because daddy's a D.J. and mommy loves to
dance. He's already been to his first little "rave".  (during the day, of
course).  But as he grows older he'll be going to more raves with us.
Daddy and I definately dress normal, and at raves wear the old school
clothes, an ameba shirt and a pair of wide legged jeans, and some
Addidas's.  Nothing outrageous, just normal.  I guess when we get old I
still plan to be a part of the rave culture and hopefully my son will too.
I hope to bring him up with a talent for mixing and record knowledge, and
hopefully someday he'll make us happy and press his own label. Eitherway,
he will contribute someway to rave culture.  No I don't think you'll see me
with a pacifier in my mouth, or a stuffed animal, at a rave, but my three
year old son wouldn't mind.

If PLUR means "shut up, I am not interested in what you are talking about"
I guess you are right.

When you wield a term like PLUR, take your own lesson and exercise some.
"Wanks?" Puleez....

The only reason I'm giving Mac props on SFRaves is that after leading
all other computers as THE recording studio computer for music
production the last 10 years, for the money it has the most powerful,
easy to use music apps barring getting a $150,000 digital audio
workstation.

Also any Mac with stereo in/out can be a 16 channel digital recorder
with basic software, and the stock OS 7.5.5 makes it a 10 second digital
sampler, with freeware and shareware programs for longer sampling.

Macs can also read IBM and Amiga MOD files and create loop style songs
in that underground format.

Unfortunately as we move towards the Common Reference Platform the Mac
OS seems more like Windoze 95.

Yeah I know about Xerox PARC but the Mac was the first commercial market
GUI that made computing simple and intuitive for non-programmers.  I
consider myself a power user but when the Apple Internet Connection Kit
takes days to set up right then we're getting to be like the DOS world.  

Most people want to use a computer system like a telephone, not be a
programmer and know how the damn thing works, remember Apple? 

Anyone notice that the govt wants do declare Sony's internet/tv box a
weapon and prevent the rest of the world from having cheap internet
access?  Do we come off like the Nazis of the "Information Superhighway"
or what?

If anyone knows the whereabouts of these two amazing women Dina Alemagna,

deleted it.  Anyways, were planning a snowboarding trip in January, and I
thought this would be a perfect opportunity to gather and board.  I'd kind
of like it to be a female gathering, the guys can hang out with my "hot
shot boyfriend" just cuz he has more experience than I do,(boarding, that
is.) This invitations open for any female boarders, or anyone who wants to
try it.

Oh, yeah, Dina, if you're reading this I love the picture you sent me -you
shredder!  I envy you. I can't even get to that point yet,literally.  And
Melissa, wherever you are, we could learn alot from Dina, I think she's
really got it all together.


Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I don't see why I would want to do this. I want my antiskating set to 
work best with my scratching and backspinning on rekkids with grooves on 
'em. How the needle moves on blank vinyl when I'm not scratching or 
backspinnig is of no concern to me. Your methode will of course provide 
true neutral tracking; however, neutral is not necessarily corect for my 
DJing style.

Myth; Apple paid Xerox in stock to allow Jobs to visit on site.  I have
sent a more detailed response to Rob; please ask for it if interested,
sfraves is not really the place to discuss this.

I heard somewhere that its the oil in the Peanut Butter that actually 
does the job of getting the gum out.  Might work for pants too.....

or you could just buy a new pair of pants.

 When I'm bored my mind begins to wander  to a faraway land, and my
imagination begins to explore. And I wrote this poem. So here is a poem
from me to all you beautiful people.

P.L.U.R...........
What is PLUR?
Peace is when two people of a different country share advice.
Love is when you show great emotions for one.
Unity is to bring all together and accept each other.
Respect is the care and tenderness you show one another.

Please let your mind explore.
Let your body experience a whole new world.
Unite and believe in one another.
Revive and feel the trance.

LET THE VIBE TAKE YOU AWAY.........................................

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoyed. And I
hope this made your day a little brighter.
This is what I feel PLUR means. This it what PLUR means to me.
Love always Victoria
XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOOXOXOXOXOXOXO

Got gum on your pants!?  We go the perfect solution...

Buy a Friends & Family patch!!!  =)

Okay, seriously, I have a new batch of FnF patches in (hats too!), so if
you see me out, hit me up for one.  I prefer to not sell single patches
mail order, but if you want to place an order, send me some email.

I am offering price discounts for large orders:

1 patch = $3
5 patches = $13
10 patches = $23
20 patches = $42

Hats are $7!

Thanks for your time!

Tony

HEY everyone, THANKS for your suggestions!! :>>
My friend ran home to try every one of your suggestions.. For future 
references, here are some of the suggestions i recieved:
	1) Try the peanut butter anyway, cuz the oil in the PB will loosen up 
the gum.
	2) Apply ice directly to the pants and chip it off as you go along
	3) Try using gasoline on the gum to loosen it up.
	4) Let it sit in the sun and dry out the gum then try.
	5) Put a piece of newspaper/other paper over the gum and iron it off.
	6) Buy new pants. 
	7) a FnF patch.. ;>
	8) Don't sit in gum. (hahahahahahahaha)
Thanks again, you're all great people! 
Love and Smiles,
		LAra

Does anyone know if the gathering is going to be in SF?

Someone told me it's going to be in Sac and this creates a problem for me.

If anyone can confirm and give any additional info it would be greatly appreaciated.

Thanks,

I say free speech is free speech, even if you are spewing bullshit.  Someone
said something about a year ago when this exact same topic came through sfr.
"Let them have thier web page so we can send e-mails telling them what we
think."  or words to that effect.

Anyone know of anything happening in the Cleveland, Akron, Columbus area
around 12/23-12/30....I know Mark Farina is playing at MOIST in Cincinnati, OH
on 12/21 (the same night DJ Dan and Liquid Journees are playing ELEMENTAL II
in Chicago), but both occur before I'll be in the area....anything not
listed on the
mw-raves list during this time?

     maybe instead of a bong you might want to give them tickets to the 
     gaslight theatre in campbell.  this is a real vaudeville theatre, 
     complete with popcorn to throw (and sometimes eat).  i went there with 
     my arms crossed, thinking that since it wasn't a rave, and ravers 
     were'nt going to be there dancing doing thousands upon thousands of 
     drugs and(a couple of bong hits) that i wouldn't have fun.  WRONG!  
     this place was a blast.  i think any parent would enjoy it.

As a raving newcomer (to this highly esteemed bbs) who drops into waves
while cybersurfing and snaking all shoulder hoppers I appreciate why
this is exactly the kind of message one should find on a rave list
instead of scholarly dissertations on the history of disco or the Rules
of Dance Music.

Why I dropped into SFR so hard?  Besides living in N Cali for most of
this decade I've been a little teed about  some of the opinions coming
out of SF through some local dance trades.

As I dropped into SFR I thot, "Kewl, this is almost as good as AOL
was!!!" and I guess I got back into that hacker mentality that does
battle with P.E.T. teams (Isn't that the name of the AOL S.S.?) and fake
hackers working for the other side.

The other aspect was a little research project re Fads and Turf Wars in
the Music Industry, particularly re dance music.

Don't mind me I'm just a fool!

You Windoze 95 types will have to understand that some of us ravers are
what society labels "sociopaths" which is like being dislexic to rules. 
I'm worried about the immanent mutation of XLR8R into Rolling Stone
complete with university degreed Music Critics.

Once a new fad has reached the phase of having preachers describing it
for the masses the ka is usually dead.

By controlling the Terms of the Fad one gains Territory which must be
defended at all costs.  Music Critics become the preachers of the Fad,
dividing the followers into sects based on Genre.

As the Fad grows more and more Record Label dollars flow to the fad
media, and they begin to Smooze with Record Labels.

By controlling the local media one can hype one's friends and business
relations and Record Sales fuel this vicious cycle.

I believe we have now entered a time when commercials are more cutting
edge than "serious media."   Watch Saturday morning cartoons for a
while--you are being massaged with a rave of information cultivating
your commercial tastes, attitudes, and of course the usual programming.

To me cyberspace is like the ocean---I don't check in with the etiquette
(sic) FAQ anymore---but then I guess that's why I dropped out of school.

Anyway I saw all the different "stoopid" conversations and rants and
thought at least it was a change from the "Professional" Rave Media.

Will someone please direct me to the Grand Puba of the Mailing List to
have my Bootay Spanked and then force me to read a 3" Internet book 100
times, finally sending me a copy of the Allowable Subject Matter List
for this list?

     well, if you all worked at farinon i'd say "go to periscope depth" 
     which means "stick your head above the cubicle"
     
     anyway, find me at the gathering.  ill most likley be wearing a blue 
     t-dhirt with a gold door above the heart chakra, on the bottom of the 
     door it says 'journey beyond perception' or some shit like that.  
     please enter the passcode 'bongrip' or i might think you're a 
     cardassian or something.

Okay, now I'm really confused.  I visited the Communion homepage 
www.communion.com/gathering and there it says it is going to be in San 
Francisco. Oooo, I thought, could it be at the Concourse again, like it 
was in 93???  Then I hear from another source that it is going to be in 
East Bay.  Now Sacramento!  I have NO idea now.....

lying in wait,

It's not Sacramento, and the San Francisco on the homepage should really be
bay area. I'll change that. I know Martin's been trying everything he can
to have it in the city, meeting with several city and SFPD officials, but I
can't say what the final outcome was.

Subject: shit, did I say that, why?

I would like to sincerely apologise for feeling the need to tell 
everyone on UKD what a lucky bastard I am.   I was just too excited 
about actually having a decent NYE that the part of the brain that 
usually detects potential cheesy or embarressing statements temporarily 
shut down, I'm sorry...
Having said that I think we should start arranging some kind of meeting 
point for everyone going to Mount Universe so I can share some of this 
free booze around and avoid feeling anonymous amongst the 12000.  Also, 
has anyone got any idea about the level of searches employed at these 
events?
- ----------
Did anyone catch the Psychonaughts on the Essential Mix at the weekend?  
Phenomenal, 75 records in two hours apparently, hard to describe but I 
suppose eclectic would be one the words used.  Has anyone taped it?, I 
only got he last 45mins due to Caffreys induced forgetfulness, mail me 
privately if you're prepared to do some copying duties, normal 
arrangement..

     Well yeah, thats what I'm talking about! 
     
     When something starts off so good, and it also happens to be 
     psychotropic, you can end up overdoing it without even realising.
But 
     when eventually you have a moment of insight, and stop, and then 
     reality returns, you see what you were missing before (and also
what 
     you were missing before you started doing pills), and then when you
go 
     out, if the atmosphere is good, you can get so high naturally.
     
     Its a cycle that takes you down so low, that you are forced to see
so 
     much more value in life, in order to dig yourself up out. And 
     once you're out, you actually keep going so that you end up higher 
     than ever before - I love it!

Lucky Bastard! 
Anyway Steve, I hope it is the big one... Drink a quadruple Brandy

>I'm so fucking excited it's pathetic, where's me gear?

The only option possible in a situation like this I think everybody will
agree.

Subject: A Jammy Bastard Speaks

I was strolling down Berwick Street on Monday (as you do) when I
happened to 
pass the door of Sister Ray, the well-known and much-loved popular music 
record emporium. What should I hear coming from the speakers inside but 
something that sounded suspiciously like Daft Punk, although nothing I'd 
heard before. Intrigued, I went inside and asked the friendly fellow
behind 
the counter what was playing. "Daft Punk's new album", he replied. 
"But...but...but..." I blurted. "Let me pre-empt you there old boy," he 
said. "You don't think the album's out for a few weeks yet do you?" I
dumbly 
shook my head. I was confused.
"Well, we got 15 vinyl copies of the blighter this morning and there's
one 
left!" he exclaimed. Hardly believing my good fortune I whipped out my 
wallet and bought the bastard there and then, thanking all that is
sacred 
that I recently bought a new belt for my turntable (yeah, yeah, I know
DD's 
where it's at, but what the fuck eh?)
And my verdict? Well, no time/inclination for a detailed critique now,
but 
it sounds like the proverbial bollocks to me. There are a couple of 
bowel-loosening steroid-pumped mutant techno battle chargers from Hell
in 
there, some oh-so-funky disco-stabbed-by-techno-down-a-dark-alley
numbers, 
some willfully obscure pony-tailed knob-twiddling chancer shows off like
an 
only child moments and some *gorgeous* 
quite-hard-to-categorise-but-don't-wear-your-best-pants-when-you-listen-to-it 
type of stuff too.
All in all, a bit of a result. Finally, something that lives up to the
hype.
I'll tell you more about it when I know it a bit better.
Shame about those copyright laws isn't it? I could organise tapes if it 
wasn't for that. Still, it's only a few weeks...

The Gathering is the big event this weekend...it's hard to believe it's
been five years!  SFRaves itself has been around for almost as long, so
our 5 year anniversary will be coming up.  

Also, this is the last calendar before Xmas, since it's on a Wednesday,
the next calendar will come out on Thursday as usual (not early)...

	I won't really worrying about XLR8R becoming like Rolling Stone or
Spin or whatever. If people read it like they do Rolling Stone or Spin, it
is the people you should be snickering at. Now if XLR8R becomes all high
and mighty because they turn out a free mag which I guess is suppose to
chronicle the rave scene, then they are nice hypocritical human beings who
like most high and mighty types, simply have their heads up their asses
(albeit in top fashion with 100 million people worshipping the words that
fart out of that asshole, but who am I to find that silly). Either that or
their "rave scence" isn't the same one I am involved with.

	Well, do you mean that once a movement or religion or the like 
has someone telling you what "it is all about", that that movement or 
religion has lost its meaning? It no longer gives people the chance to 
find their own meaning in what they are doing I would agree. Here have 
this spoon fed meaning, I trust you understand it don't you....

I suppose I'm just venting a little as the "history" of rave and the
dance scene becomes codified by scribes.  Half the time it sounds like
the usual record industry hype, fluff, and commercialism we see in all
the other music genres.

A rule of nature prevails.  Magazines tend to hype labels that buy ads. 
DJ's tend to play the labels who send lots of freebees and extra
records.  The farther one works up the chain to the big bucks and big
record labels the shmoozing is like some kind of EST program.

Worse than the big labels are phony "peace & love " promoters who are in
it for the money and care nothing about the music or scene.

I'd rather see some of the wacky stuff when rant3rs can really  rave on
this list but maybe I was a little overboard which can happen to silly
fools.

The thing I enjoyed most were the criticisms which make ya check
y'rself.

:D

I guess I'll have time to switch when NT 6.0 comes out, cuz after years
of telling us that NT will rock the internet, 4.0 *STILL* sucks the
hairy donkey dick. Is this "beta" or a 4.0 release. I can't tell:

And it could be the reason why Nasa will NOT pull it's Macs from it's
locations.  At one time they were going to replace them with, er NT or some
other dreck.  Fact is Macs can do just about any job a single user might
want.  I said user, not programmer/techguru so stop it! ;)

I saw the movie last night... It was pretty funny. If you're a Beavis and
Butthead freak (like me) then you should go see it. If you only kinda like

[ to sfraves ]

 Well, it's been actually a hectic week, and I intend to just veg out
tonight (Fri). But, I am finally seriously considering going to the
Gathering tomorrow night ( I was going to a thing tonight, but am going
to pass on that for the TV couch and a warm bed ).

 I was watching last night, and the weather reporter was doing the 
five-day forecast thing. On Saturday's graphic was a footnote : "Winter
Solstice" (!) - Oh duh! The Gathering is going to be on the Winter
Solstice! I had completely missed that point in all the recent 
discussion about it ( I've just been skipping over the "Gathering"
related posts so far ).

 So - it'll be a huge crowd, so I'm not going to bother posting about
what I'm going to be wearing or look like. Well.. I might wear my old
red cap with "SFR" painted on it, but that's the only unique thing
I think I'll be wearing.

 CUCMe ? In any case - let's rock the place!!!

Ok, one last question:

I'm a bit worried about flying into SF and not having access to this list,
and the number I have for the Gathering not providing a location...

Anybody feel like offering up an opinion on that? (like, chill, it'll be
there by Sat., or go to a certain record shop, etc.)

Or if any adventurous souls would be kind enough to offer me a back-up
phone number, so I at least have someone to ask come Sat. eve...

(yeah, this is pre-trip stress-out just-chill-babe holiday shit)

Just checking!

Cheers - Suzanne

Is this a good thing or a bad thing. Sound to me like a Commercialization
thing to me, I don't know.


What are all your opinions on this?

Commercialization IS inevitable.
Now
The question is who will be in control and who will be profiting
from this unfolding. Will the rave scene follow the model of The
Grateful Dead and keep the expansion, and subsequent exploitation
of the music, culture, image under it's own control?

or will it go the way of Hip-hop and let the record companies pimp it.

Being a parent both limits and expands one as a raver. 

The children come first. I try to keep my raving from detracting from their
care. I go home afterward. 

My after-rave glow is always so rewarding in their company.  In the Summer,
a day at the pool is a perfect capper.

Some of my favorite raves are those my children went to: Tribal Future,
Harmony 3 yr., outdoors in daylight.  Kids know how to play!  They love glow
sticks and lasars and hot springs and stickers and glitter and stuffed
animals.  And so do their grown up companions at a rave!  it's a great
equalizer.  

Ruth and Darrell love knowing what I'm up to.  Until this summer raves were
very mysterious.  Now they know and appreciate what it's about.  Great quote
on leaving our last rave as a family "we want to come back and bring our
friends."  Looks like they *got it*!

        I missed something here. Rave Design of what??? Clothing?
        Buildings? Speaker systems? Tents?

        Anyway, assuming it is clothing, and assuming I happen to
        randomly encounter this exhibit in some way, I will probably
        amuse myself by making a point of *not* wearing anything
        labeled a "rave design" to a rave.

        Is it good or bad? I think it has about as much relevance to
        my life as any other fashion show - little to none.

	On the other hand, if they've come up with a new design for
	speakers that are very loud & also very light, that would
	be good in my opinion.

	I am not on any mailing lists for records so I don't know 
anything about labels who send freebies, but as most djs I know, I buy 
the records that sound good in the headphones that are in the bins or 
that some friends over in the UK have told me sound really good though 
the headphones in the stores (ie, they have listened to them). If a label 
were to send me extra records and those extra records were good, I would 
play them. Most of what I consider good is not coming from people who are 
trying to "promote" their labels by giving away free records. Is it a 
label's fault if djs cannot make up their own mind on what they want to 
play? And how much good techno is coming out on the "big" labels? How are 
big labels different from small labels (how much you have to "scmooze" to 
get freebies? Distribution?). I have a hard time getting vinyl because I 
am the only one who seems to want it (that is what I am told when I walk 
in and ask for something a little harder than what I have found ;) )... 
Anyway, if the big labels start pushing into the little record stores, 
then I will make a fuss, but right now, big labels are just silly and if 
a group is silly enough to sign on to some contract for x albums in y 
years, then that group has decided their fate.
	If djs want to play freebies that are shitty, or they just don't
know what they like to play, then those djs might want to start playing
weddings or big events. If people who put parties on ask a dj who plays
freebies from bigger labels to play at their party, then those people have
made a decision.If you start treating people like they can figure out 
what they want to do, they might just start making their own decisions, 
right? The mainstream leads people allow nicely, do you want to follow 
ait or find your own thing?

It will be the latter. Their is entirely too much money to be made for
the record companies not to take advantage of it. There is entirely too 
much money to be made by greedy promoters for them not to take
advantage of it. The Dead scene has a very specific market. If you are
"in" the scene, you generally like the Dead. The rave market on the other
hand has a much broader base of potential revenue as it can be
mass-marketed and mass-produced in many different ways, with many
different bands, and events.

Once again, I have to protest Niels including NT with DOS and Windows.
NT is *not* DOS or Windows.  It is a different operating system, based
in large measure on the architectural concepts of VMS.  It is a threaded,
message-passing, protected-kernel, modular-subsystem operating system,
in other words, a *real* OS.  You can quarrel with some of the things
that have been done with it (the security model is weak, for example),
but it is *not* like the other Microsoft operating environments.

	The Grateful Dead kept its expansion and subsequent exploitation 
under control? Maybe their own exploitation but the exploitation of those 
people whom they preformed for? I hope the rave scence does not follow 
the model of the dead, or we are doomed to big commerical raves with big 
djs that can spinning fucking amazingly, or, hmmm, seems to the 
commerical megaraves in Germany. Gone will be the free festivals (how 
many free shows did the dead do? How many low cost shows? How many fields 
in the last 15 years did they rent out to have people come to? Ok, they 
couldn't just pop on to someone's land because too many idiots would turn 
up who would cause trouble, get too fucked, or take a peaceful concert 
and turn it into a violent troubled land, so were they throwing 
"underground" dead parties like the old acid tests, or had they become 
another band, playing huge gigs to buy "beautiful" homes in desirable 
areas?). People who go out to raves still have a certain level of 
awareness in some parts of the world, I would hope we do not lose that, 
but maybe that is eneviable as well?

Careful Niels, Phred does NT consulting. ;-)

NT is in a different category that DOS and Windows, yes. I still find it
severly lacking in many areas, including security, performance vs. price,
and remote management capabilites. I find none of these lacking in many of
the various Unices around. Arguably the only thing lacking on a UNIX
system is really slick GUI's and a lot of commercial packages.

I will agree with Niels, though, that NT 4 has some problems (though
I'd say they are sporadic).  The biggest issue on the Usenet newsgroups
I've been monitoring is the difficulty in getting it to work with
audio cards and scanners.  

Anyway, remembering that there are plenty of people who would love to
have our misery dealing with all these badhorriblebroken operating
systems, I'd like to suggest we lay off the OS Wars and get back to
things of more direct concern to the list.

As for viruses, which started all this, my recomendations are: (1) don't
ignore; (2) don't overreact; (3) stay informed.

...consider it most alarming that while I am a conductor of classical
symphonies during the week, I frequent these so-called "Techno-Rave
Concerts" on the weekends.  But I find electronic music most extraordinary
and not dissimilar in mathematical structure, to the works of Beethoven and
Mozart.

Some of my most recent symphonies have been plagued by a rash of ill
fortune.  The lesser of these incidents is that I have been misplacing the
sheets of the score, so that, when I turn a particular page in mid-concert,
I discover that the next leaf is missing.  This has led to much
embarrassment for me and for the San Francisco Junior Symphony.

The more disturbing of my recent misfortunes involves the addition of two
young hoodlums to the bass section.  This pair of neandrathals, who call
themselves Slider and Duke, are the most uncivilised half-wits I have ever
had the misfortune to publicly perform with.

By the grace of genetics and thoughtful breeding I am a patient man, but
the shenanigans of these two rapscallions has left me in a bind.
Undoubtedly they prepare for our concerts not with the usual musical
exercises, but more likely by smoking dangerous cocktails of LSD and
hallucinagenic toadstools.  This theory is unproven, I admit, but it
provides the only logical explanation for their incoherent rantings and
bourgeousie behaviour.

Had the choice been mine, I would have expelled these genetically malfunct
mavericks at my inception, but as I am only a junior conductor, the matter
is beyond my power.  Studying music at Berkelee, I was trained to be
patient while conducting an orchestra, but I fear that the boorish
blitherings of my newest pupils has pushed my nervous system to its limits,
causing me to lie in bed at night trembling with fits of sleeplessness.

I originally met Slider and Duke at a Techno-Rave Concert called Harmony,
and was initially pleased with their friendliness and vivacity.  I learned
that they both played the bass, and eagerly encouraged them to join the
symphony.  It wasn't until later that I considered that  their friendliness
during our first meeting was probably inspired by hallucinations from
sniffing rocket fuel or marihuana dust, or a dangerous combination of the
two.

Just last week the orchestra was scheduled to perform its most important
concert to date.  Critics from the Post and the Times would be there, and
if the reviews were in my favour, I would be selected for the London
Symphony Orchestra.

The night before the performance, dear Mother Fidget, at my request, came
up with a plan to arrange the musical score so that it wouldn't become
disorganised as it has in previous concerts.  She divided the score into
the 9 sections that the symphony was to play, and tied a piece of string
around each section, so that as one section ended and the next began, I
could simply untie the string from the pages, and continue without pause.

As for Slider and Duke, they appeared at the concert hall in remarkable
condition--rested, clean and well-groomed.  The first 8 sections were
impeccable; the entire orchestra was in tune and on the beat.  I should
interject here that there is a period at the beginning of the 9th section
in which Slider and Duke are scheduled to step off-stage during a lull and
the music, and return to their instruments for the grand finale.

The first part of the 9th section went smoothly, until I noticed that
Slider and Duke, instead of standing patiently off stage, were carousing in
the lounge across the hall, drinking  glasses of spirits and swallowing
large quantites of narcotics from a pill jar.

I began trembling in horror, unable to stablise the hand that guided the
orchestra.  As the grande finale neared, Slider and Duke emerged from the
lounge and swaggered back onstage, giggling amongst themselves, shuffling
their feet like peasants, and tripping over instruments.

>From behind, I heard horrified gasps from the audience.  Surely, my career
would be ruined because of these two bourgeousie buffoons. With fidgeting
fingers,I tried to remove the string that dear Mother had so craftily tied
to the score, but the knot stayed fast!

As a man of cultured upbringing, I am not the sort to sweat, even under the
most rigourous activities, but I was chagrined to feel perspiration beading
on my brow as I envisioned my own ruin.

Dear friends, I beg you to imagine the pressure I was under:  it was the
bottom of the ninth, the score was tied, and the basses were loaded.

hey yall,
is anybody planning on going up to stargate from the south bay around six
or seven o'clock?  those maniacs ben and dhiren are starting the action at
five, and without informing my boss that i need the afternoon off!
the nerve ... 

anyway, if anybody has room in their vehicle for me, i would be overjoyed!
plus, i have an assortment of glass beads, spare change, and other
attractive barter items from which i'm sure we can negotiate some mutually
rewarding form of exchange.
matt.

It is just an expression.  The thought behind it is that if the 2 DJs
are in "competition", then they will both spin extra good.

Also see "2x4", where you've got 2 djs mixing in and out of each
other's tracks.

Let me take a few semi-informed guesses here:

 If you go to some stores that sell music on vinyl, you may find some
videotapes for sale of actual DJ contests! Each DJ gets to show off
their fancy scratching and mixing skills and taste in music. In this
case, the "vs." really stands for a competative situation between one 
or more DJs.

 I think , at raves and some other events, the term "vs." is kept,
but more in a nostalgic or satirical sense, as the DJs are more 
into "team mixing" then a real competition.

I've always wondered...don't they get really bored?  You hafta wait twice
as long before you can play another record, unless you're like Dreamer and
Carlos, where you're like....wicka-wicka-wicka-wicka-woop-woop every 2
seconds with the scratching to occupy your time.

yup, tis true, tomorrow i'm loading my car and i'm moving from santa 
rosa area down to the San Jose area to find a *job* wheeee..(morgan 
hill, specifically, for those hardcore southbayers) ;> 
	why should you care? 
1) because i am more than willing to rideshare/ridegive to events that 
i'm going to, and i'm not annoying in the car unless you hate listening 
to mixtapes to/from events.
2) because i love 2 hang with people and dont know enough (you can never 
know enough) ravers in the south bay
3) just cuz. 

hopefully i'll see you at the gathering, i'm still working on how i'm 
gonna get there ($-wise)! if not, i wish you all a phat holiday season 
and big *HUGS* to all of you out there!
Love and smiles,
LAra

an alternate method: each dj is given a dose of a highly toxic mutogenic
psychedelic plastered on a rave biscuit*, which they must lick clean
without using their hands.  normally, one dj is transmogrified into
godzilla, while the other takes the role of mothra.  the titans battle it
out in a post-industrial urban nightscape under the glare of glo-stix.

*recipe for rave biscuit: take a scratched-up 12" vinyl, an insane dose
of drugs, mix well and <bake> at 200 degrees for eight to ten hours.

        anyone who has any further questions regarding this matter, i
assure you that @ our New Year's Eve party, the Cloud Factory will do our
best to clarify this matter by demonstrating right before your very eyes
various techniques of multiple DJ collaboration for 8 hours (along with
several "DJ vs her/himself" single DJ sets and even a live performance at
7:30am for good measure).

The Dead crossed over inevitably into Massive Land, and for that part of
the U.S. rave scene that will take on the characteristics of massives, they
should learn from the lessons of the Dead on how to deal with the problems
of putting on large, loud gatherings for thousands of people, many of whom
might be interested in breaking the law.  I felt a lot more free at an
Oakland Coliseum Dead Show than at a HomeBase rave 200 yards away.  What
I've always appreciated about the underground rave scene is the relative
freedom afforded, at least in part, by the lack of authorities (official
security or police); massives and Dead Shows take on a different character
because of the presence of people in uniform, although we Deadheads in the
Bay Area were spoiled because the authorities basically winked at the
lawbreaking & drug use.  This freedom is also represented by the relative
democracy of the rave scene, without the separation of "artist" and
"audience" (which couldn't be done as much by the Dead, although Deadheads
were pretty active participants in the process).

Within the Dead community the wealth of the band in their later years was a
big point of controversy.  Given that for their last ten years they played
an average of about 80 shows a year for 2.5 million people, employed a lot
of their own people and paid them well (plus medical, pension), kept ticket
prices relatively reasonable compared to other acts of their size, and
played numerous benefit shows for some important, underfunded causes, I
didn't begrudge them their relative wealth much.  More of an issue for me
was the fact that their own personal drug use made it difficult for them to
criticize the DEA's targeting of Deadheads, and that they didn't do enough
at the end to help Deadheads take responsibility for the scene (i.e., just
lack of communication and enough help for self-policing & crowd control).

Yes, the Dead became massive, but they became massive doing what they
wanted to artistically.  Could they have stayed more UG?  Perhaps, but by
the end perhaps it was too late given how much they were dependent on the
scene they created.  The individual members of the band had their niches,
however -- Jerry Garcia Band shows at the Warfield theater during the 90's
were very low-key, mellow, family affairs, even though at $21 a show and
with a capacity of 2500 they would be classified as "massive" raves.

As for "free festivals," the Dead played a lot more free shows in their
youth than there are free raves today, just taking their equipment into GG
Park, the panhandle or Haight Street itself and playing.  With the
exception of Sunsets, how many public & free events have there been in the
last year here?  A handful, because they are difficult to pull off and
"nothing comes for free."  Obviously there are extremely generous people in
the scene who enable free or inexpensive events to go off through their
work and donation of equipment & energy sources. There are also people who
criticize $15 Gateway & Harmony parties despite the fact that the people
who put those parties on have donated so much to our scene and have to pay
for spaces, equipment, etc.

To get back to Sub-Commander Lycos's original point -- Commercialization is
inevitable, but not commercialization of OUR Underground.  What we need to
do is protect the UG as much possible so that the problems caused by a
larger scene are kept away.  But to the extent that there will be
semi-public massives where certain facets of the UG poke their heads
through -- such as the Gathering tomorrow -- let's hope that promoters can
do as well as the Dead did.

As for commercialization of the music, well, just let the audience tape
everything ;)

...of so many happy ravers...

I am HYPED BEYOND BELIEF for this party!!  It has been so long since I've 
really gotten down, raver-style... Look for me, I intend to be decked out 
in full regalia... a long 70's gown adorned with glowsticks, a blinking 
tiara, and a big pink furry bathrobe!... I want to look as ridiculous as 
possible :) :)... though I MAY opt for comfort (good ole tank top and 
tennis shoes), because my main prerogative for the party is to DANCE DANCE DANCE!

Does anyone know how much this is gonna be?  I guess $25 ("$20 with a 
toy!"), and as far as location - can anyone say, "Home Base?!"

cya there
:)

I love the idea of Monday Night Dinner (and I hear last week's was a 
doozy, more than twenty people!), but I may need to inaugurate a new 
weekly get-together, _especially_ if I move to the city...

How does
Thursday Night Boozin'!
sound?

A weekly tour of the city, from the perspective of a barstool...

Who says ravers don't drink? ;)  I say we can party with the best of 'em...

I know that ESWH stands for Eternal Spirit Will Higs.  The last name may 
be wrong.  Will is a friend of Martin's that got killed in a motor 
cycling accident a few years back.    HOBM is Heal Our Brother Malachy 
(SP?).  Not sure what the rest mean.

the Grateful Dead was 5 guys doing things their own way.

The rave scene is millions of people doing things their own way.

Only 5 guys could play a Dead show.

Anyone can throw a rave.

Raves *are* commercialized.  See Planet New Year flyers, MC'd by Live 105's
very own Web Fingers as an example.

But there are also millions of other folks who would never  invite Alex
Bennett to their parties. That's what's so beautiful about our scene.  No
one owns the music.  We can do whatever we want with it.  We can throw
monsterraves or teeny tiny rosey-faced candyraves.  It's a free world in
the underground.  Nothing wrong with commercialism, nothing wrong with
microraves.

Techno music kicks ass.  No wonder everybody wants to be involved!  It has
the potential to open us up to the budding spiritual flowers that we were
before we dropped out of the womb into this stinkin' latrine!

It can HEAL US!

I say, the more people raving, the better off the world will be.

But I gotta admit, I'd rather be at a Harmony party.

	It also could mean that they are tagteaming (one spins a couple

Props:  Huge Waste of Bandwidth Follows, Delete at Will

Well a few people asked my qualifications for shooting my mouth off and
making a fool of myself (which is one definition for raving...as in
"he's a raving lunatic") so I'd better qualify my shoot from the hip
style.

I come from the Hip Hop dance world, and unfortunately being from the
old skool we wern't all huggy, kissy, feely in our actions or gigs.  

Before that I had a brief flirt with punk rock that lasted about as long
as the Sex Pistols, but which shaped my attitudes about the Biz. 
Thirdly I'm an LA boy (born in Boston thank God!) so my vision of the
music industry is a little jaded via Hollywood Pap.

In the Hip Hop world it's more competitive, obviously there are lots of
negative vibes because it comes from the streets where it's survival of
the hardest.  At a gig if you MC or DJ and you ain't cutting it you will
be told or the next boaster will tear you to shreds.  They have their
own squabbles now i.e. East coast vs West coast, Gangsta vs B Boy,
misogamy vs consciousness, etc.

When I used to go to gigs in downtown LA you hoped your car wouldn't be
stolen or you wouldn't get mugged afterwards.  There was no record
labels, no media, and hardly any white people at these underground
events.

On another level I hit all the dope LA clubs (1980-1987) and you could
hear a variety of dance music that was not all that different from
today's music (OK the BPM's are faster)

In music production I was lucky (or cursed, as the case may be) to work
with the following people:

Norman Whitfield (Temptations, Motown, WB. "Heard it Through the
Grapevine")
Lanise Hughes (Rick James Stone City Band, drummer on 'Superfreak')
Duke Jobe (Rose Royce, bass player)
Lenny Kravitz (Virgin)
Tony Lemans (Paisley Park,WB)
Jerry "ZO" Mosely (Motown, Fairlight CMI, Billy Ocean, Boy George)
Stephan Frank (George Clinton, Atlantic Records, 4 On the Floor)

I had some independent releases in 1984 that were played on Agent Ava's
college show in LA (KXLU), made it to some European shows, and were
reviewed in Op (now Option), Fortnightly College Radio Report, and
others, and I was distributed by Systematic Record Distribution formerly
in Berkely (where's my last check!#%*^@@)

My first release "Godzilla Red Dragon Punk Funk"  (1984) had several
songs including punk jazz, a house/disco tune "P is for Party", and a
punkish version of Gloria.

I later (84-85) did a band project (Blackbird Crew) with Lanise Hughes
and Duke Jobe,  two of the baddest funk rythym sections of the decade. 
I played guitar synthesizer and I guess the closest description of what
I was doing was trying to be the Bootsy of guitar--making bleeps, farts,
underwater sounds, and scratching noises while they laid down funk
grooves from Hell (down.)

The cuts played on LA college radio (KXLU) in 1984 were a jam with the
above people "Bubble Pop" which was a slap/pop bass guitar synthesizer
line (yes more farty, underwater sounds) against straight ahead live
drums and manic Hendrix style guitar and my Fairlight sampler opus
"Missle Man" which took a breakdance style rythym track originally made
for some weightlifting twin brothers' "rap" called Brute Strength.  I
had "ZO" Mosely reverse the 2" tape and threw down two reverse guitar
solos, adding a vocal that went like this:

Once I had a vision
That I was the atoms in a nuclear warhead
And I was jazzed because
I was doing what I was made for
Flying to some distant country

And I was thinking to myself
Yeah cool I'm gonna explode
Expanding in a big flash of light
Vaporizing everything I see

And I was flying
Daydreaming to myself
Meanwhile back at mission control
Calm voices marked my destination

Got to fly so fast
Got to expand
You know it's all in your mind baby...

(c) 1984 A.S. Bryson

As I said in another post I was following the E Coast school
(Grandmaster Flash, Newcleus, Afrika Bambaataa, etc)  and the offshoots
drifting into punk/disco like Blondie, etc.

Of course ALL the dance clubs/LA radio were playing Kraftwerk, Egyptian
Lover, Rockit, etc. so pumping dance music through large club sound
systems was no novelty.

Almost any dance you went to had at least a few break dancers/pop
lockers (I was into the latter)  while most people leaned towards the
New Wave/Gothic look/music  (Devo, KROQ, etc.)

Must give props to the Venice Beach skater/dancer street jams--where you
could hear tunes played nowhere else (even for LA) and while the music
played there was little vibes no matter race, genre, etc.

Working with the Fairlight in about '84 (the first practical
sampler/sequencer) opened this guitar player to the world of sampling,
computers, and digital audio, and by '86 I had an Ensoniq Mirage sampler
and  a portable Commodore 64 (the lunchbox style) for MIDI seguencing,
along with a DX drum machine and MIDI Bass.

I put together a project studio with an 8 track Tascam and 20 input
M-520 mixer.  At that point ('86) I got a gig as Lenny Kravitz's (he
wasn't signed then) loft studio engineer handling the pre-production for
Tony Lemans on his Paisley Park debut.  My mixes were going to Prince
every day and I thought it was my "big break" but a fight with the
artist's manager left me unpaid for 10 weeks work except for a $100
check from Warner Bros (FU*&^%$4*## Prince & Paisley Park!)  I still
have a dope 8 track of Lenny playing  Sly Stone's "Thank You" on guitar
& bass with Lemans singing and another "demo" with Prince on
guitar--what a bunch of talented wankers--so I guess I own part of the
copyright as a producer's lien.

I was fairly close to the Motown/Warner Brothers-- Lost Angeles funk/R&B
crowd and they had little or no interest in Hip Hop, House, or Electo
styles at the time, preferring "sophisticated" dance music like Donna
Summer, Bee Gees etc. and the upscale disco scene a la "Saturday Night
Fever" complete with polyester suits and gold coke spoons.

In '86 Jeffery Conners, a hot black bass player who hung with Fishbone
and Miles Davis' bandmembers, was programming jacking house beats into
my DX and introducing me to this East Coast style.

Jerry "ZO" Mosely was leaving for England where he was working with
Billy Ocean and Boy George and yapping about the big dance music scene
over there.  Through 86-92 I had my own project studio and engineered
all kinds of music for my clients--Country, Ranchero, Hip Hop, Metal,
Dance, etc.

What I'm seeing as I get feedback from other scene scribes is that one's
views on the history of modern dance music are colored by your
background--if you were in Hip Hop then it seems like that style.  If
you were in the Gay underground House/Disco crowd then it seems to have
evolved from there, Reggae to dancehall to jungle etc. etc.

I think that the music is better than ever, there are dozens of sub
genres that are all valid and interesting, but there are a lot of
newjacks who don't know where the music came from and they think they
just invented a whole new movement whereas if you've been with dance
music all along you see the same kind of repackaging as when Led
Zeppelin released some old blues jams they claimed to have written--it
goes on all the time in the music biz.

As a musician, producer, programmer, recording engineer & DJ who is ear
trained (I don't read music) I tend to think that all this dance music
is just a variant of Hip Hop/Electro/Disco which if you follow the
evolution you see there are no great leaps of creativity that
distinguish a new art form--but that there are new sub genres in the
same style.  This is my personal opinion and nobody has to accept it.,
just as the term Rock Music covers everything from Little Richard to
Beck for most people.  

Having made a career in the music biz I have a tendency to not like what
comes from music critics--there are very few with any talent at that
game which has mostly evolved as a PR tool for the labels and as a means
to sell magazines and ads.  Then again I have no great love for the
incestuous Music Biz, i.e. big labels picking up on genres 5-10 years
after the independents kept the scene alive.

My other peeve is people who are experts on one or two genres and
discount all the other sub genres.  Even if you hate something (say
Country or Classical, I used to...) why slang it to the public or tell
its followers they are idiots?  You only expose yourself as a narrow
minded bigot with a low IQ, but the people who do this the most are the
newjacks who got into this music in the last 5 years or so.

I kind of saw the whole loop again as ex-Ravers dogged that scene as
"already over" and now people act like you are totally square and un-hip
if you like that.  First it was maybe a few genres--Techno, Acid, House,
etc. but now some idiot will say you are nowhere if you like/don't like
(____________) fill in blank.

Overall I think the SF scene is great, there are great bands, DJ's,
XLR8R, obviously great web resources (like this list) of course the
place is filled with incredible artists of all types.  It's nice to see
a resurgence of unity fostered by the progressive people of this highly
evolved area--which might be closer to the spirit of late 80's European
raves than anywhere in the US!!!

I hope the people into Unity will predominate, but I suppose there is
also a place for the competitive hip hop types as that is the core of
that music that keeps it fresh while it becomes watered down by
commercialism.  You have to be open to criticism and controversy to
evolve and grow also.

OK I hate long music rants too so hopefully this is the last--

Peace Out.

I guess you picked up it was a parody of the anti-drug hysteria creeping
on the list.  The war on drugs did it's program on the next generation
but it's ironic because the first ravers (whether high or not) were
about as anarchic and crazed as any group from cubists to punk.

Should we hold drug users in contempt like they are dirty or have a
plague?  
Should we be afraid to talk about drugs and that they are common at
raves?  The other side is already talking about it.  Maybe drug users
can be the new "queers" or "niggers" for straight society.

Drugs, police, govt repression are large factors in the European scene
and the same repression will grow here from the same ignorance.

If I've learned anything from being on both sides at times--

Some assholes are straight
Some assholes use drugs
Thank heaven for the nice people in the world!

Yeah I'm getting my mixes together for a release and I might just drop
one this month (well at least they were made in '96) but it's along the
lines of <this may be a bite off another's title> 'If 1996 Turned Out to
be 1969'

	Which part will be cut up and sold off by "promoter" pimps? No 
labels used to exist that would take techno, so basement musicians made a 
tape, sent to the pressers and then off to the distributors you can find. 
Well, people are still doing this kind of thing even though labels like 
like Virgin and Island and BMI are starting to sign on a few artists. 
There are labels like EyeQ and deconstruction that are big in the techno 
world, but as far as I know, they aren't evil crank out three LPs every 
quarter type of labels... People still form their own labels to get their 
music out and as long as you can get some type of word out some how, some 
disturbtor WILL pick up your vinyl. As long as techno is sold in big 
crates that you have to sort through and can hear it BEFORE you buy it, 
no big labels will be able to control what you hear, because there will 
always be obsecure distributors (like Jack Acid) who gets stuff that few 
people want to buy, but some people want to hear nonetheless...
	Stores like Tower and Virgin with their nice and easy displays 
and classifications and big posters telling you want the latest great 
albums are cater to one type of crowd. Back ally vinyl shops with 
listening stations cater to another... You don't like vinyl? That could 
be a problem if you don't have the cash for a CD burner... Of course 
there are problems with this, maybe get the distribution company a call 
to get the artists phone and then try and setup a way to get it pressed 
to a CD... I think that people who are open to this knid of thing will 
find it - just remember that those artists going through BMI are probably 
getting bigger offers than the basement artists who press the vinyl to 
have it heard...

Room for rent in large San Carlos home.

Looking for cool, mellow, creative types to share a 3 bed/2 bath house with
two others in San Carlos, which is about 5 minutes from both 280 and 101.

I am a software engineer at Apple Computer, and a budding DJ. I used to do
radio shows on KFJC where I would spin an ambeint mix, and did live events.
I also play drums and guitar occaisonally, and would be wanting to have
parties once in a while (not too often; I'm no party animal or anything).
If there is enough interest, I may work on putting wiring in for a shared
Internet connection. Obviously, I would only do this if the costs were
split by everyone.

I would prefer professionals in the computer/technical fields of any
gender, race, age, etc who are easy-going and mellow. However, I would like
people who also are into alternative/experimental music: ambient/ techno/
dub/ psychedelia/ whatever. Also, anyone with a a sampler or a pair of
Technics SL-1200's gets special brownie points!!

No flakes or drug abusers!! If you fit in this category, I do not want you.

But the bottom-line is I am looking for anyone who is responsible and easy
to get along with.

Available now. Hurry!

Rent will be $675/month + security deposit.
Contact Doug at 408-974-5913 or 408-972-9177. Or reply to this email.

I believe the person who passed away in the abbreviation E.S.W.H. was Will
Higgs. I produced an event with Will in Dec. '92. Will was a very good person
who enjoyed life to the fullest. A month before our event, Will was hired by
a motorcycle magazine as a journalist. He loved to write and he loved to
ride. Unfortunately, at (I believe 23 years old) he was killed in L.A. I
believe it was raining and he spilled his motorcycle in an intersection. It
was not the fall that killed him, but the vehicle that hit him after the fall
at 40+ mph. Before Will died, He wrote something that we printed on the back
of the event's t-shirts. It reads as follows:

House music knows no boundaries, no prejudices.
It transcends the territorial lines that divide the planet.
People of every size, shape and color continually join together
to share this music and the joy of sharing.
It is quite possible this music may someday unite the world.
Join us as we celebrate with music and musicians from around
the globe and show the world the potential of people and music.

	Go to a festival in Europe, thousands and thousands of people at 
a free party put on by a bunch of nutters. The ones I have been to had no 
cops, just a bunch of traveller types and students out in the woods.

	I see a band that was making literally millions off of album 
sales, millions off of merchandizing, money off of books and side projects, 
and still charging $20+ for their shows (am I wrong here). I do not 
begrudge the band for doing that. I do however think that a number of 
people put the dead on pedestal as the people who could save the 
Universe. It was those people who I thought lost whatever the dead and 
its community may have had going (and may still have going in small 
underground type places).

	Here it is difficult to pull these off, I agree. What is more difficult is 
getting people to come out in the middle of rainy Feb to full moons. It 
is difficult to get people to realize that if they make a scence on the 
way to a rengade party, it will get busted. I know people that have tried 
this and frankly, those were some of the best parties I have ever been 
(one in the rain in back of Travis AFB comes to mind). I don't know if 
the Dead played more free parties than are going on today though. There 
is Sunsets like you said, there have been free full moons going on for the 
last four years or more (put on by different groups, but there has not 
been a break in them for four years as far as I know, except maybe last 
June 1 when everyone I know who was involved went up to tribal future and 
I was in Scotland). There is a free party tonight, there is a free party 
tomorrow night. The dead could do theirs openly because things were 
either a little looser with the law or the people had their shit more 
together back then... 
	I heard about systems such as the Sativa Clan and those people
that are now in Network 23 touring through the continent in the summer
doing totally free festivals, people would house them, and feed them as
they past through, but those people throwing the parties are not coming
out of it with a huge wad of cash, just a bunch of memories and a battered
sound system and friends ALL over the world that will help them out when
they need it... There was one system called desert storm that brought a
new lorry and headed down to I guess Siberia (the one states of former
Czech). Went down and through festis in the middle of a war (they had to
buy the new lorry because their van was all done up in camoflague. In this
country, I know a group that has travelled across the country for AT least
two summers in a row doing FREE festivals, pulling off free parties all
over the country - they got burned in NYC, but they pulled themselves back
together.
	So why don't these happen here? How many people are willing to 
come help move speakers in the pouring rain? How many people will come 
out and keep their wits about them and work together to keep things quiet 
for rengades? How many people will go out into the night when it is 
chilly? How many people will drive more than 45 minutes to get to a 
party? Now you know why they don't happen here....

     A thought struck me today as I was stuck behind a stuck Muni bus on 
     Market street :
     
     Is it time for a new definition of the scene that this list relates 
     too ? The word "rave" came to prominence during the heady days of acid 
     house circa 1988 (86 ?). To me, the word is synonymous with cheesy 
     compilations, straight-assed marketing execs trying to tap into the 
     "yoof" market and a whole bunch of generic techno by numbers (such as 
     2 unlimited, rednex "cotton eye joe", scooter, etc.., etc..,)
     Would sfdance be a better moniker ?
     
     It seems to me that there has a lot of bandwidth on this list devoted 
     to discussion regarding the state of the scene. i.e.. will MTV 
     trivialize the music, will XlR8R preach electro-dogma now that it has 
     a different format, will gangstas (sic) ruin the vibe, will the 
     underground become commercial, etc.., It seems to me that the word 
     "raver" itself lends itself to compartmentalization. A case in point : 
     I went looking for a full-moon party at candlestick park a few weeks 
     back with a friend of mine. Finally found it at about 8 in the morning 
     and I met someone who I'd seen around before. She mentioned during the 
     conversation that she was "more of a clubber than a raver". 
     
     It is apparent that there are a wider assortment of people on this 
     list than the word "raver" can attempt to describe. There are those 
     that go to clubs, those that go to raves,  there are those that like 
     Jungle, those that like house, hip-hop, trip-hop, gabber techno, 
     detroit techno, euro-techno, goa-trance, funk, not forgetting all 
     producers, dj's and artists that keep pushing the musical boundaries 
     and keeping everything fresh. 
     
     
     Back to my main point : when the mainstream starts to appropriate 
     terms such as "rave" for themselves then it is also time for those 
     that like the music, the scene, etc..., to rename the subclulture 
     themselves. For to me it is all dance culture, meaning that no matter 
     what the color of your skin, family background, sexuality, 
     nationality, gender, religion, marital status or age we are all united 
     by the love of not just partying but also being part of something.
     
     We, the clued-in, the hip, the underground will ALWAYS be able to keep 
     ahead of the tabloid journalists, tv talk shows, the corporation you 
     may work for, members of fraternity houses, network tv. In a nutshell 
     the MAN. 
     
     We all have the power of speech and we can use new words to define the 
     lifestyle that we partake in and no-one need ever know what we're 
     talking about. Except those in the know. 
     So we are all part of the wider "dance culture" and as a minority I'd 
     say we would have considerable political clout.
     
     
     
     Peace,
     
     
     Ciaran, O!
     
     
     P.S. Phew, I just ran a spell check and "Raver" is not in the 
     dictionary. The world hasn't caught up with us yet !

Just a point of correction here:

Ray Vonie who is/has been associated with Cool World states that Planet
New Year is *not* a rave, a point on which I agree. Why it even appears on
the calendar is an exercise for the reader....

Whatever part needs to pay their bills. I'm sorry, and I don't mean or
desire to start a flame war, but I see some top talent playing shitty,
fucked-up, greed driven parties. People that I like to listen
to. When I have questioned people in the past, I am told that it is "just
a gig." Like it or not, the best and brightest is being sold or selling
themselves, right along with the crappy and commercial, willingly.

I disagree with part of this. Tower has listening stations, which I
was shocked to see, not having been there in almost a year(albeit select
titles.) Go into Rasputins. See any listening stations? Go into Amoeba(not
Ameba.) See any listening stations? While maybe not "back-alley" they
certainly aren't the big guys. Know what I see in these places? Attitude. 

I totally dig the ability to go into Ameba or F-8 and listen to anything I
want with nice friendly people offering suggestions, but I wouldn't
classify Tower as being in a totally seperate category. Tower has some
damn good releases(dunno about techno in particular but their indie
section is cool) and pretty friendly staff.  


> You don't like vinyl? That could

I don't think this holds true any more. I can get a burner for less than
$500. I wouldn't even know where to begin to try to find out how much it
would cost for a vinyl press, or the media itself, but I almost positive
the equipment is more, if not the media as well.

I used to LOVE Motif.  Just the way it looked, slick, and clean.  But for
all around user feel, Windows sux rocks, the Mac rules in this area IMO.
There are others that may look a bit better (I like windows/nt interface),
but none act as predictable as the Mac OS in terms of user interface.

Pax thru UI,

Cleaning up electronic music studio:

Korg Poly 800

-> fully analogue
-> fully MIDI
-> fully programmable
-> polyphonic
-> mine's fully functional

$140 firm.

------------------------------------------------

Yamaha MT1X 4 track cassette recorder with FSK Sync box.

Yamaha multitrack in great shape, recerntly serviced.  4 channel input... each
channel has "sliding" fader, 2 band EQ, LED UV meters, AUX Send level, pan, 
gain.  Monitor mix section with fader and pan on each channel.  Mono
AUX send, stereo return with master AUX OUT and master AUX in.  Sounds
great with DBX noise reduction, integrated SYNC switch for use with...

Yamaha YMC10 MIDI/FSK sync box.  You can use this to sync the multitrack
to a computer or external sequencer.  For example, you first record
a track of timecode, then you sync the sequencer to the timecode to
record the POLY 800 bass line, then rewind the tape and do it again, this
time recording the lead POLY800 line... in perfect sync with the bassline.
In short, this allows you make a real multi-track song with just 1 
synthesizer using tape sync.

Price for both multitrack and sync box: $160 firm.

------------------------------------

Bad news:  it is not worth it to ship these devices, so San Francisco Bay
Area people only for face-to-face transaction.

A monopoly that the public has willingly given them. To make this in the
least bit rave related, think about that the next time you(not
necessarily you personally)  attend or work at 
"conglomo-I'm-just-trying-to-make-the-payments-on-my-beemer" rave. Then
in a year, come back and bitch about the state of the scene. Then ask
yourself, what have you done to contribute to the situation.

I say we should be like Zero pilots about to scream Kamakazi! as they
descend into Pearl Harbor---RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Rave attempted to fuse the best notions of the emerging countercultures
and was wildly successful which is why the govt, already prepared since
the 60's anarchy and rebellion, moved about 10 times faster to shut down
raves than they moved on hippy rockers

The best way to beat the commercialization and govt interference is the
underground family parties as is springing up everwhere.  I suppose a
few artists could do the big record label sellout and buy an island
somewhere

Commercialization and a good underground product.  Take the Macintosh. 
If they kept it an underground hacker computer it'd be like the Sinclair
or Commodore.  Now they license it's OS and every big corp is after
them.

Also it seems rave is about jacking pop culture and the media and
feeding it back to the masses using the same subversive, subliminal
techniques as our media masters

Anyway your post rocked shit but I've wondered the same thing--the past
re-invents itself--but I say come out of the closet and give respect to
our teachers, and those jams still rock today!!!

Raver should be good for half a century at least if rock is still
going...

Well apparently I've  stepped into a domain that might not live up to
it's name because I wrongly assumed that this would be an open forum for
any rave related discussion including rave culture and media.

Though I checked it out for a few days at least, and I've seen a cross
section of things from party reviews to computer OS comparisons, besides
personal messages and even a few odd things that you have to stretch
your mind to connect to rave music, it all seems to fit somehow so it
puzzles me how the content is censored when anyone can just delete  or
bozo filter any maniac they don't like.

While I can imagine there has been huge turf wars here over a myriad of
subjects and the focus is supposed to embrace rave music and events it
would seem logical that rave culture would also be a focus but maybe I'm
just naive.

While my rants have probably gotten me about 5 to 1 favorable responses
apparently I set off the shit detector alarms of the moguls who control
this forum and  have gotten ominous little hints that I'm rocking the
boat (or status quo)

God what a great feeling!

All the talk about bandwidth...do they mean download time or disk
space?  I thought bandwidth wasn't as big an issue nowadays.

So if somebody would be kind enough to forward the FAQ, Boy Scout
Manual, or Robert's Rules of Order I'll try and OBEY but as I said
before I'm kind of dislexic to rules it's a hazard of being mental.

The other option would be to direct this handicapped person to the
nearest liberal rave forum.

There's a "RAVE" retail store in the Northgate Mall. Their chain used to be
called "Wet Seal". Off of this subject and onto another; Glanced at the

(UK's first female jungle DJ). In my opinion, she looks as good as she spins.

First off, I hope this isn't being contentious.  I don't think underground
"raves" will or should be commercialized, and there isn't anything the UG
community needs to learn from the Grateful Dead organization, which was
Dave's original point in responding to Sub-Commander Lycos.  Massives and
commercialized raves, however, are another issue, and so are misconceptions
about the Dead.

[liberal re-quotes from Dave Bayer's post]:

>        Go to a festival in Europe, thousands and thousands of people at
>a free party put on by a bunch of nutters. The ones I have been to had no
>cops, just a bunch of traveller types and students out in the woods.

        In Europe, not here, which has more to do with cultural differences
than organization.  Did you enjoy these events or not?  It sounds like you
did, but don't think they can work here, even though you personally have
worked very hard and successfully in smaller events.  My point is that the
Dead were sometimes able to spread a vibe to arena or stadium size
audiences in the U.S., in a public way with sometimes heavy police presence
and surveillance, while the massive raves in the U.S. don't seem to be able
to do that so well.  On some level it would be great to have a super large
scale rave scene that kept the vibe here, but I don't see it coming.  I
also don't feel the need to convince non-ravers of the value of raving,
either in massives or the UG -- people will seek it and find it for
themselves if they want it.  I do try to bring newbies who are ripe.

       Sort of -- they were NOT making millions from albums that hardly
sold well (and which usually sucked in comparison to their live shows) --
really, about 200K copies per album with only a couple of exceptions, and
they usually spent so much time in the studio, and had such shitty
contracts, that they made little if any profit from their albums until In
the Dark in 1987.  Merchandizing was usually bootleg until the 90's.  The
Dead made virtually all their money, and indeed became wealthy, from
touring and touring alone.  They laid off most of the people in the
organization when Jerry died and the endless tour stopped.  Only since
Jerry died has there been a boom in official merchandising, but not even
close to make up for the loss of concert revenue.  I've been to the
Grateful Dead Merchandising warehouse in Novato this year, and it's barely
big enough to hold a small rave.  But yes, the Dead did charge about $30 at
the end for admission, and only a handful of people would get "miracled"
and get free tickets.  The rest of us paid for our experience.

 I do not
>begrudge the band for doing that. I do however think that a number of

True enough. Much of it was from the sense of a feeling of deserving what
people "got" from the Dead, and being parasitic towards the band, rather
than giving back to both the Deadhead community and the world as a whole.
It was also a matter of abuse of freedom.  This is a problem in the rave
community as well, and potentially more so because we are more
self-reliant.  This self-reliance, in turn, also leads to greater karmic
rewards in the rave scene when everything clicks.

        I underestimated the virulence of the full moon scene, but as you
pointed out it is true that the free events today can't often be open.  I
think the Dead could get away with it in '66-'68 because they did guerilla
actions back then, and even a long concert lasting 3-4 hours is shorter
than a rave.  Plus the Dead used to do it in the afternoon, which threatens
the authorities less than overnight events.  And all the audience had to do
was show up -- the Dead hauled the speakers in themselves.

        Maybe we are wimps when it comes to wind & rain, because maybe
there are people who find it harder to enjoy raving in foul weather.  Why
should outdoors in lousy conditions be equated with free UG events and the
spirit of raving?  I saw a bunch of people hauling up the speakers from
Harmony's Panther Beach event in early July after a beautiful summer day :)
But it's hard to complain about a non-publicized party, even if free, not
attracting enough people.

        I don't personally have a problem at all with UGs charging what
they do for indoor events in SF, and all power to people who organize and
work on free parties.  The eternal contradiction is for those people who
believe the world would be a better place if more people raved and want to
get more people involved ideally, yet who prefer small UG events to
massives.  If there are going to be massive raves in the U.S. which succeed
and bring a good vibe despite commercialization, the Dead are not such a
bad role model.

The Grateful Dead sponsored the Lithuanian basketball team; which allowed
them a financial opportunity to go to the olympics. (which i think is pretty
damn cool) 

The team was affectionatly known as "Team Tie-Dye"

fyi: their team shirts are for sale on the official grateful dead website @

Dear Nuncleheads ;)

Just want to say any opinions expressed  under my moniker are solely my
own and do not reflect on DJ Penny Andrews and her show Infinite Space
on KMUD Garberville.

Yes I am doing some live commentaries from the Internet, and I intended
to be available to read any shouts, party listings, or comments from
these lists or my email directed to her audience in N. Calif--as her's
is one of the few Rave shows between SF and Portland for all of us in
the boonies--and it's on non-commercial public radio.  By the way she
will most likely be on Xmas eve and NY eve for those wishing to party
over the airwaves>  Tues 10PM-1AM

She was part of the English scene in the late 80's and has worked with
some of the major acts from that time--besides her brother is a Drum &
Bass producer in England so she gets lots of fresh cuts from that scene.

Some people think I'm spamming and "shouting" too much so if the above
announcement is a spam then I guess I'm trouble :P'''

Perhaps the most interesting thing going on here is the politics,
pecking order, and territoriality you see in all human endeavors, and
it's really a microcosm of the world at large.

It's the job of fools like me to say the crazy shit that would get most
people's heads chopped off in the King's Court.  If someone has a
problem with me then why don't you quote me (out of context of course!)
and we can have a public or private debate on whatever subject, instead
of quietly suggesting I go to the back of the bus for unspecified
remarks.

In the world of street knowledge it's not about muscle or physical
prowess it's about KNOWLEDGE and anybody is free to make any boast or
statement--they will just have to live with the responses.

Some of you might remember when punk came along and challenged the
complacency and commercialization of the Hippy/Deadhead scene... when
"Peace & Love"  became a front for a bunch of farts making millions and
buying condos on Maui.

Some of my best friends are "hippys" who wear tie dye and listen to the
Grateful Dead--but that original movement was about challenging the
power structure, non-conformism--and don't forget, originally,
"revolution." 

Now dance music has a hierarchy, priests, scribes, historians...
essentially a "power structure" where none existed.  Millions of dollars
are revolving around it--record labels, big radio (it's Top 40 in
Europe--your "underground" music)--advertisers and sponsors.

One element wants to infantize the scene... make it purely hedonistic. 
Like ALL we should do is party, suck lollypops, play with dolls,take
drugs, and vegetate like the hippy movement.  THAT whole cycle worked
for the gov't in undermining the 60's revolution.

Look at the "Peace & Love" hippy scene now with 3rd generation stoners
who grew up in that scenario.  On the one hand you have highly conscious
people who have transcended a lot of the programming of our
materialistic society--people who value communal values over society's
values.

On the other hand there are lots of "wolves in hippy clothing" like the
street people that steal other's backpacks or drugs, or will freak out
over something and start smacking heads--a lot of drug addicts who will
do almost anything for drugs--or take any drug>  speed, smack, coke,
etc.  and a lot of those types are throwing parties for the same reasons
since order arose out of anarchy--to get laid and make money.

I'm not dogging drug use (as you may know I'm for ending Prohibition)
but to a lot of people drugs are their gods and they lose their souls in
the pursuit.

Hey the best occupation in life is to do something you love and make a
living at it.  We should use all the tools of the Establishment to stake
our claim to exist, have a self-sustaining economy, and avoid political
repression.

Before someone takes my last ruckus out of context re candy, dolls,etc.
what brought it up for me was remembering the Seattle scene a few years
ago and the faddism and cliques that were forming.

People had their own crews and if you didn't have the right candy or
know their slang "codewords" you weren't gonna be invited to their
afterparties, and were given the "vibe" like you were an outsider.

This scenario is familiar to anyone ever having been in Jr. High school.

On the surface it was playing out with people busting each other's
parties (calling the cops) and spreading massive disinformation
(dissing) each other.

I believe the cartoonish aspects of rave originated from the psychedelic
experience and not from regressing to childish "in crowd" behavior.

Yeah--be as innocent as children but don't act out the stupid pecking
order rituals kids play just like their parents.

This is directed to those kind of people, not the rest of you.

Enjoy the Turnaround,

DJ ASB

Hey kiddees!!!

As promised, I made another batch of SFR badges for this party. I'll
probably be wearing a get-up that says "GREEN" in big letters on the
front. Or find Adam (R.lunatic) in his standard attire, all Adidassed
out with a b/w Dr. Suess hat. Or ask anyone with a badge already, and
hopefully they'll know me.

N-E-ways...It's gonna be Phatty phat phat, everyone come out and play
tonight. It's a beautiful evening for a party......

love, energy, and viberations,

Terry

P.S. Surprise, surpise...it's at Homebase!!!!!

P.P.S. My socal cohort, Rodrigo, came up for this too so say Hi if you

  Well we didn't mean to confuse anyone out there! In this case what we
meant by vs. was simply side A <MYSTR-E> vs. side B <MARS>.
  We felt that any other term such as MARS "Likes" MYSTR-E or MARS "plays
with" MYSTR-E wouldn't have sounded right, nor fit the theme of this tape.
   We've been best friends for most of our lives so it definitely was more
of a fun thing for us to do. It probably has to do with our more
competitive nature growing up in L.A.
     Anyways, hope this helped.

          Stay Tuned In.

<<Greetings Earthlings>>

	Hey all. Just a quick little note from the Brain of Dave. Just 
got off the freeways and there is some CRAZY SHIT happenin'. The weather 
makes it very hard to see, people who are used to driving fast when it's 
dry ARE NOT SLOWING DOWN. Someone SPUN OUT right in front of me, across 
several lanes of cars, and slammed into the embankment.

	I know a lot of you are headed out to the Gathering, or 
elsewhere. Please remember to drive safe!!! BE CAREFUL!! You are all very 
important to us, and we need you here on Earth for a *little* while 
longer, okay?

	We love you!!!       
                                               Hugs:)

Bad timing for my car to be in the shop, but I missed Audio Impact, and
now I can't get to the Gathering either!  If anyone that hasn't left yet
lives in the cupertino/mountainview/sunnyvale/etc area and you could let
me ride with them to the Gathering plz page me at 408.407.0681 or send
email (I'll have it open all night)
Whether I can go or not, I hope everyone has a cool night!
peace,
Max

Friday Night
After two nights of serious drinking (end of finals = crazy partying in 
B-Town), the little nagging, voice of reason inside of me whispered to stay 
home, rest my body, and take good care of myself in preparation for a 
wild Gathering.  So, what did I do?  Why, I jumped up and headed out to the 
City, of course.  27 years of life does not necessarily bring wisdom.

First stop: DNA Lounge
Fabled 11th Street.  Friday night at DNA features a live disco band that 
has to be seen to be believed.  What a show!  Afros, gold chains, 
platforms and a sexy motherfucker of a lead singer, ripping their way 
through the entire 70's repertoire.  Great fun, with a drunken crowd 
hanging from the rafters, dancing on tabletops, and singing along with 
the songs (which rock, IMHO).  After the band ended rather early, though, 
some generic house came on over a muddy sound system, and we decided to 
blow that joint.  One other detraction: at $12 to get in, and inflated 
drink prices, a night at DNA is a costly affair.  Also, only one stall as 
a women's bathroom, with no seat on the toilet and a mirror so warped and 
clouded that a reflection was impossible.  Someone's getting rich off 
this deal, 'cause the money doesn't seem to be going back into the 
facilities.
(BTW, I'm listening to KBIG playing killer disco right now.  Love it!)

So we popped over to that old stand-by...

1015 Folsom
Whoa!  Did I hear someone say Nikita is dead?!  Oh, wait, that was me!  I 
must have been hitting it on the wrong nights, because last night that 
shit was POUNDING.  A different world from last week (I wonder why...? 
must be hit or miss).  Jerry Bonham was throwing down the hardcore 
underground sound in the main room, some crazy tripped-out trance, and 
the unclub crowd was going nuts (including yours truly, of course).  Club 
vibe was nonexistant, especially after two.  And the Family was 
definitely represented - glowsticks, smiles, speakerbabies, ravedancers.  
I kept going much longer than I should have on a beautiful natural 
endorphin high, and finally got to sleep at home in the wee early morning 
hours...

So I hit here now, 7PM on what was to be The Crazy Party Night, but I 
already have several behind me, and sleep is looking so good.  I'm 
undecided, but even now I can feel the beat throbbing, beckoning me to 
follow...

Yipeee! Finals are over, the shortest day of the year has been and gone 
leaving only the longer days of the new year, people who left the list 
during the recent unpleasantries are beginning to come back, and I'm 
going to the Gathering. The new year starts tomorow, and with it new hope 
for better things to come. Much Love to all of you.

ps to anyone still geeking out before going to the Gathering: come say 
hi. I'm 6' 185# and I'll be wearing a puke green soccer shirt, bright 
orange whistle, FnF laminates, giant yellow wallet chain, newly bleached 
very short hair.

Enclosed find two replies, pick the one that suits ya :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nah I'm not asking for pity--more like I'm responding to some private
mail that took me to task but didn't point out any beefs...

I checked out this list for awhile before responding to some wack (in my
opinion) posts i.e. on the subject of drugs and the general censoring of
topics a few people don't want to see.

Since people asked me to "qualify" my experience in this field I
did--albeit it was a lengthy boring "bio"

Because people send me posts like yours and I figure you probably
represent a few others that won't like my style I tend to answer back at
the public forum for them also--

That's what it comes down to--is this an open forum or a "good 'ol boys"
club?  If you have an intelligent criticism of any particular thing I
said why don't you quote it and if it was stoopid I'd admit it.

I'm really not interested in kow-towing to the existing pecking order
("I'm a local... I've been here longer") or the old world mentality so
many newjacks seem to have.  

If it were not for some enthusiastic replies from some long time members
pointing out the anal retentiveness of some of the others I probably
would have unsubscribed in about 2 seconds because for a minute I
thought I was in alt.rec.stodgy.

Sorry you didn't appreciate my parody maybe I can forward my posts to
you and you can edit them for everyone else since you are on such a
higher mental plane.  

What if I WAS dislexic and "mental"?   It just means I didn't fit into
the niche society prepared for me--to accept their conditioning and be
like all the other drones.   What the fuck is RAVING supposed to be
about?  This ain't no stinkin' chess club as far as I can tell. Is
SFRaves about being like everyone else, not challenging the status quo?

I came in just like it was a club full of ravers and did my dance.  A
few of you bitch and say:  "Nah you can't express yourself that way here
we're very civilized
we don't act that way!" and obviously there are a few nerdy computer
types who are on the tip of being funky but still can't quite loosen up,
probably can't dance if they even try, so they become "Guardians of
Techno Philosophy" and take it to a verbal plane.

It's almost hysterical--people that consider themselves "Ravers" yet
they got to check people for expressing themselves a little too "wildly"

I think I've already apologised for dropping in like a bomb because I
didn't really expect this place to be like all the other groups you find
online.  I said a lot facetiously and in humor and it's ironic how
people pick up on a phrase or two made in fun and feel uptight about it.

Which might bring up a valid topic--how (or why) should the dance
community police itself.  Who should be the arbiters of taste and
propriety?  I could say I hate samples of screaming women in techno
songs--should I tell you you are an idiot if you like them?

"Freedom of Choice"
-Devo

You think I create juvenile humor?  What a compliment, since it's crazy,
whacked juvenile humor that makes a techno song wild.

I know I say some wack shit sometimes, and when someone of intelligence
and knowledge ubraids me, I take it to heart.  Your kind of attack
"describing" what I said is only your interpretation--perhaps you saw
yourself as the target to some of my jibes.

BOY YOU OPENED A BIG ONE!

>what do you mean by the standard conventions?

I guess I'm saying that where raves evolved out of a mixed
hippy/punk/alternative direction and those genres were trying to break
out of the standard music industry conventions, the idea was to create
new contexts for enjoying music, somewhat related to the ancient tribal
rituals but incorporating all the new art forms of the last decade.

As rock culminated in the punk era people were aware of the huge
corporate mentality behind rock--huge tours--the resurgence of
"controlled" Top 40 rock, the blatant PR and how performers were treated
like idols.  Record labels gave contracts taking 95% of the gross
profits, etc. and the alternative market was aware of this disparity.

Ten years later (87-97) we should question the same ossification of the
dance genre, and look for alternate ways to spread the vibe.  Not to put
down promoters (I've been a little too harsh) because even for a greedy,
phony type there is so much work, stress and possibility of being busted
that even the most jaded must have SOME love for the genre or they would
invest somewhere else.

But excitedly there are new outlets popping up.  More and more people
are forming communal rave families;  there are live DJ broadcasts over
the Internet;
people are hooking up online and sharing mixes.  These and others like
them are some of the ways this music is spreading in channels the major
labels never dreamed of and are barely catching on to.

Probably the downside is just trying to replicate what went down
before--mimic the parties of late 80's Europe and go no further--fun but
not too adventurous.  

Also by standard conventions I mean in general terms how fads start, are
spread, and then become homogenized by the masses.  That "Valley Girl"
song came out about 10 years ago, was mimicked by several other media
sources, and now you can go to almost any booney mall in the US and find
a bunch of girls talking that way.

GETTING TOO DEEP

Oh well dig a hole with your mouth...

What does it all come down to?  Fads... how they originate and spread. 
You see the same patterns.  When they get big somebody starts making $
off them and then wants to hype them bigger.  Does it mean anything to
be a hippy or punk anymore?  Nobody is shocked by long hair or nose
rings.  Most people can get a job at a major chain with either prop.

(Reading back now I seem so faddist myself :P''')

Alternative has become the standard uniform now...so from that context
is there any possibility of being cutting edge or doing something
different than what came before?

I guess we get into what Art is, a question that has been beaten to
death over the centuries.  Rave culture took on a life of it's own
beyond the music, not unlike the Deadhead movement.  Now it is more like
a religion or political party, embracing a whole cultural shift.

Is the model of youthful rebellion against parental values played out? 
The media has worked this theme for big bucks even before James Dean
movies--so if your parent was a raver what do you rebel against?  The
shock value in being different is tough when parents might be hippys,
gangstas, or ravers.

But true to form Raves became the next whipping boy for the media & law
enforcement--as if rockers aren't pumping drugs down 10 to 1 over
ravers.

Ironically it's the above kind of attention and sensational stories that
drew a wider audience to this music.

Media archetypes--that's the word I'm looking for.  I think what happens
to any progressive movement is as the average masses swell the ranks,
they eventually codify and ritualize what were originally spontaneous
gestures.  You see this in religions like Christianity and Taoism.  The
founders start out basically saying "Keep It Simple Stupid"  (K.I.S.S.)
but as they pass on and their teachings become canonized, eventually the
average followers lose the original intent and it gets complicated.

Yeesh this just gets deeper and deeper, and it's a plane I get nervous
being on!!!

But as I listen to college radio and hear a wide cross section of music
covering this last century, and some of the various world music types, I
can see how new or mutated genres will continue to arise.

The common thread is the innovators, the creators.  People will continue
to break the rules and conventions and create new (or recycled) genres. 
That story of Throbbing Gristle on this list (they switched from
uniforms to frilly dresses, alienating their core followers) is
indicative of the above explanations--how the average "follower" wants a
tangible stereotype to mimick, something that will give a common
reference and will not lead to doubt.  People (animals too) feel secure
with something familiar--they don't like radical change.

I "switched" my image a lot... having some acting background makes it a
little more fluid.  I was drawn to the "uniform" look because almost
nobody wanted that excepting groups like Devo, the Clash & Throbbing
Gristle.  I used to try to be more individualistic before that, looking
psychedelic, and another phase I wanted to look kind of like a
psychedelic trooper--you might say the day-glo uniform effect though the
main gist came from the "paramilitary disco" look that went by for about
6 months sometime at the height of disco.

Having experienced the Hippy Uniform and resulting police harassment
kind of led me to want to look more "Rambo" than the cops, if I really
wanted to "trip out" hard in my mind.

It's kind of funny to look so straight... maybe be totally bombed and
have a cop ask you if you're "in the service" and just nod stoically. 
You'd be amazed at how often this saves your ass.

Even more fun is to pop up in a group of deadheads and get the total
stinkeye--and they don't even suspect you've "out-tripped" them a
hundred times over.

But all of this is externals and the real revolution has to be
internal.  What you look like, wear, and what club you belong to is
irrelevant.  Can you break out of the programmed being called by your
name but consisting of millions of programmed messages:  "Do this...be
this..etc.)

I was thinking the other day...what is my ego except for my vocabulary? 
The verbal mind is like a dictionary, stringing words together to create
a persona.  

Hell I'm not much more than a spelling checker (and defective at that)
strung together with a bunch of programming.

I was also thinking rave has always been around...sitar music,
aboriginal music, Arabic and Scottish droning music... these people were
tripping centuries and thousands of years ago.  So from that standpoint
we might as well forget fads and revolving genres--we're just continuing
an unbroken chain.

The progressives are probably listening to dozens of genres (all types
of music.)  The faddists will become die-hard "followers" and only
follow "their" music.

The real battleground is the MEDIA.  I think the spirit of rave is to
jack any media source, twist it up a little, rework the media
archetypes, repackage it, and feed it back to the masses

The college radio jock is jamming now--playing a cross section of punk,
industrial, techno, blues/r&b, and Zappa? or something similar.  I'm
amazed at how tastes change because when I was deep into Hip
Hop/Breakdancing I thought the Bee Gees, Madonna, and Blondie were kind
of wack and most people in there would totally dog you if you liked that
stuff, but now it all sounds great and I can't wait to sample it.

Maybe the word rave has become a straightjacket, like Ciaran OHara wrote
in "Is the word "Rave" obsolete ?" and has been echoed strongly on the
East Coast.  This is a reaction to the faddism and commercialism--you
hear rave music on the TV news, at a football game, in ads, etc.

Coming from the Hip Hop world I think the advantage of the rave model is
that it is (or should be) trying to be conscious and intelligent.  Hip
hop has gone after the macho violence stereotype--and there are only so
many ways to work that played out stereotype.

Rave seems to take some ideals from the art world and the
countercultural revolution.  Hopefully it embraces intelligence (smart
drugs?)  Now it is splitting into dozens of sub genres but aren't these
children essentially Rave music?

When ads for BMG's record club look like rave flyers do we need a new
model?

Well just knowing a few people hate my ass on this bbs inspired me to
dump this missive back into cyberspace... bombs away :] this is for you
people.  Keep the letters coming they are great inspiration>

Ta Da,

DJ ASB

boy I shouldn't even add to this but here goes... :)

1) We're _never_ going to have Ibiza in the 80's again.  Once something's
new, it's new and then it's been new and it's old and can't be relived.
However, what we can take from these times is the essence; the spirit if
you will that created those events and caused the movement to be born.

2) The 'techno' 'rave' scene is dynamic.  It always has been.  That's the
point (isn't it?).  It changes to suit our needs as a family, or better
yet, _we_ change _it_.  If the scene didn't change, we wouldn't have a lot
of the great stuff we have now, and we'd still be spinning T99 rekkids
(well, maybe that part wouldn't be so bad... :D)

3) Everybody talks about rock rock rock alternative alternative
alternative punk punk punk but nobody seems to have lived through the
1970's with me.  Does anyone remember disco?  Now the disco thing was odd
at best, but it really mirrored a lot of the musical problems we are
describing with 'techno' and 'dance' music.  There were highly commercial
lables putting out disco records, mainstream artists started trying to
make disco records at the orders of their producers (anyone remember
'Tatoo You' by the Rolling Stones?), and meanwhile there were underground
artists making and pressing disco records and distributing them to DJs who
were trying to keep on the cutting edge of the scene.  Nowadays you can
find all sorts of disco you never heard of in thrift shops and such.
Where did it come from?  It's not on A&M or RSO!  It must be independent
lables!  Oh my God!

Now, the big difference here is that disco shot up and fell down fast as
technology afforded easier ways of creating more compelling dance tracks
(I'm not putting disco down, mind you).  The 'techno' 'rave' musical scene
won't fall this way because there are constantly more and more people
interested in hearing newer and more diverse music.  The 'techno' 'dance'
scene (eg. Kellee, RuPaul, etc.) is commercial... it's the extension of
the commercialized disco market.  It will do whatever it's going to do no
matter what and that's just that.  But if Moonshine sells 100,000 comps
this month or if they sell 5, there _still_ are going to be a hefty crate
of new indie underground rekkids to spin and chances are there are still
going to be DJs who search these things out and spin 'em!

Lables like Harthouse/Eye-Q, Rampant and others have been able to
consistantly produce high quality music with effective marketing and
distribution.  Does that detract from the music?  No!  Is every records
that comes out on those lables my favorite?  No!  Commercialism and
marketing are necessary for larger lables to stay in business, we
shouldn't hold that against them.  

blah blah blah
PLUR

  <\\__  DJ ASB:

I was glad to see yet another intelligent and reflective post on sfraves.

I gained a renewed appreciation of this level of depth on occasional 
sfraves posts after briefly subscribing to 'nyc-raves' to check out
possibilities before a few NYC visits last month. The hostile and
neandrathal tone of almost any nyc-raves post makes sfraves posts seem
enlightened by comparason, IMO.  Yours (rave spam) was especially
interesting. Thanks for taking the time to post it.

> The progressives are probably listening to dozens of genres (all types

> follow "their" music.

Yes, but I believe this goes beyond the progressives. I think this
statement was probably true twenty years ago, but there has been a
significant change in musical tastes in the past decade.

Hmmm... I'm wondering whether to give a short explanation or a more
complete one. Since your post was extensive, I'll assume you prefer to
look at ideas in depth. Bandwidth war!

So here goes. Sorry if it sounds like it fails to acknowledge the
likelihood that you already agree with all of this...


      In the nineteenth century, the younger generation enjoyed the same
music as their parents. Then at the beginning of this century, young
people discovered the option of daring to enjoy the newer ragtime
and tin pan alley ditties. This was a major change from the cohesive
family musical gatherings of the previous century, but was not yet a major
conflict - many parents also wanted to be "modern" and embraced ragtime
and popular music as well. 

     This dynamic of generational division expanded in the twenties,
thirties and forties, with jazz and swing, with even less parental
approval of the new music. Then in the fifties, another level of
subdivision began to appear: this one was *within* the younger generation
itself. One group of kids would prefer a different sound from another
group of the same age. Some people even began to make distinctions
between the "good" kids and the "bad" based on their musical and dance
preferences.

     While parental disapproval over the new rock and roll intensified,
and teens' music began to split between hard-core rock (greasers) versus
cute-and-clean pop rock, with a sharp decrease in teens who liked the
music of their parents' generation. The labeling of "good vs. bad" kids
based on their musical preferences increased.  Toward the end of the
decade, the "good" kids had another choice with the "Hootenanny" folk
music movement (before your time?).

     This division continued in the sixties, of course, with Mods vs.
Rockers and more diversity in popular music. Folk music evolved into Bob
Dylan and Arlo Guthrie crossovers.   However, the seventies set the stage
for a major paradigm shift away from such either-or choices.


      A pause for a digression:  In 1969, General Electric's Business
Environment Section's published its Study of Significant Value-System
Changes, a forecast of changes from the 1960s to the 1980s.  
 
Changes predicted:                        

     from				to
War (military might)		Peace (economic development)
Nationalism			Internationalism
Federal government		State/local government
Public enterprise		Private enterprise
Organization			Individual
Future planning			Immediacy
Sociability			Privacy
*Uniformity and conformity*	*Pluralism*

      Note the improbability of Sociability changing to Privacy while
Uniformity changed to Pluralism. These trends seem to go in crossed
directions. This study was decades before the Internet came along with its
odd fusion of privacy and pluralism.

     Of course, we now know that the G.E. study turned to be right in most
cases, even predicting the major shifts of the Reagan years.  End of
digression.


     So here we are in the Decade of Pluralism.  In music, I think 
pluralism began to appear as a major trend in seventies popular music with
the increasing options of hard rock vs. soft rock  vs. oldies  vs. disco
vs. new wave vs. punk. You might place this shift earlier.

Twenty years later, we have mainstream popular rock, alternative rock, 
punk, techno/house/coldwave/hardcore/industrial/hard German/trance/Goa/
jungle/ragga/tribal/dub/trip-hop/gabber, ambient, rap/hip-hop/OldSchool, 
R & B, reggae, heavy metal, thrash, trash disco, oldies, surf rock, new
Latin (salsa and techno merengue), Tejano, country & western, cool jazz/
acid jazz, retro lounge, world music, bhangra, Afribbean, just to name a
few...

... as you know, being in the business...

and the most surprising development of all, which you mentioned: for the
first time this century, we now find teens liking much of their parents'
music (Deadheads, teens attending Stones concerts, and the retro
50s/60s/70s listed above). The baby boomers universally *hated* their
parent's music (Lawrence Welk and the like) and vice-versa.


But the most significant aspect of this is that most young people, not
just the progressives, love much/most of these genres of music. Last night
at the Gathering, didn't Alex Patterson close his set (which had included
several of the above genres) with a bagpipe waltz? 

At least that is what I have found. Your experiences may differ, so this
is just IMO.

I feel that a new dynamic of pluralism has superseded the older
pattern of mass trends. In my opinion, this is a change for the better.
I think the richness of diversity is healthy, and I admire the broader
sense of tolerance that many now have for the tastes of others. 

Just my 2 cents worth.

Richard

I mostly agree with your spin on this, but I think the fad dynamic also
killed the disco scene, which simmered along just fine for 15 years until 
'Saturday Night Fever' made discos hugely popular/mainstream, then hugely 
Last Year's Fad. John Travolta helped do the same to country/western,
which took more than a decade to recover from its own 'Urban Cowboy'
boom-bust cycle. 

I'm not convinced that the same dynamic can't happen to raves.

Hope I'm wrong. 

I'll get flamed for this, but for the subculture to remain healthy, I'd
much rather see the current spate of ravophobic media attention about
Drugs At Raves Ruining Your Children than a successful major film hyping
rave culture.

IMHO, of course.

Richard

Some Stuff About Last Night's Gathering at Home Base in Oakland:
1. IT WAS GREAT!!!!
2. What's the problem with the Home Base site? It was my first time
   there, and I was cool with it. Certainly a lot cleaner than some
   warehouse raves I've been to. Lots of rooms, good enough sound
   isolation between rooms.
3. For one reason or another , it's been a long time since I've
   heard Spun or Garth, and hearing that "progressive house" stuff
   again was good for my soul.
4. House and techno and jungle and etc. at the same event - thumbs up
   for that!
5. Eric - I was pissed of at you, but not any more.
6. Can anyone tell me via private email if they saw any gangstas there?
   I must be too old - just saw a lot of young people in young people
   clothes...
7. Definitely a young crowd, average age looked 18 to my 41 year old
   eyes. Your SF Bay area ethnic mix. 
8. For some reason, it made me nostalgic to see the huge crowd having
   a good time, with videos and lasers and strobes. Like the big 
   warehouse raves of my experience ( post-92 ). Of course, this one 
   was being put on by the folks who did most of the best ones of
   my memory, so that may be part of it. 
    But I also think there was a similarity in the mood of the crowd -
   "experienced" ravers and bemused/amused/happy first-timers. Some minor
   fashion differences ( more athletic-logo wear than what I recall ).
   It may also be co-incidence, but I overheard a lot of conversations 
   between strangers about being on E the first time that night.

  That's it for now - bye!

Richard

The only thing I might add to your nice overview is the influence of
jazz and blues to the "good/bad" dichotomy--where you had the raw jazz
from the streets against the slick big band stuff that was for the
masses.

Just as in the blues genre this was "the Devil's music" as gospel turned
into steamy, sexy blues & jazz ballads.

The good music/bad music seems to have become a marketing tool for the
label executives...

Again the "teenage rebellion" marketing angle, perfected with Elvis and
the Beatles and culminating in the Sex Pistols (who parodied the whole
scam.)

Came up with a new acronym:

DIVE (Diversity, Individuality, Vibe, H'mmm...what could E stand
for?...oh yeah, Equipment (take good care of it, you can't have a gig if
the equipment don't work  :) or maybe Energy!

It's a little ironic how many people seem to have a problem with the
PLUR crowd, but I imagine that has to do with the fact that among the
dance crowd you have all types reflecting on society at large:  hippys,
punks, anarchists, hip hoppers, rockers, gay, straight, nerds, jocks,
etc.

A lot of these types have a problem joining any movement as "members." 
("Nasty as I Want To Be"--2 Live Crew)

If I recall articles from a few years back the English trades were
describing the Jungle crowd as being working class, hooligan types as
opposed to the brotherly House/Techno scene--and it was held in disdain
by the mellow types almost like how punk grafted onto the rock scene.

I forsee punkish/gangsta vibe dance crowds with totally opposite
political views complete with macho posturing, fights, moshing, etc. as
punks, industrialists and gangstas merge into the scene with junglists,
etc.

But isn't this what diversity is all about?   Some people like to be
sadistic or masochistic (whether or not they are ill) etc.   I can
imagine Born Again dance a la Moby, as well as Satanic dance or
Matriarchical scenes (Gaia, woman's liberation movement, etc.) and
eventually a scene for every persuasion.  In the party circuit you see a
full range from hardcore S&M sexuality to innocent "Jack & Jill" types
trying to recapture the joy of childhood--and as one of my earlier
detractors said..."It's ALL Good."

Of course as a "straight" one would have to have blinders on not to
notice the unifying effect all this dance music has had on the Gay
community, that has continually been on the cutting edge and sustaining
all the new experiments way before the masses find out.  Back in the
days you virtually HAD to go to Gay clubs if you wanted jumping, cutting
edge music that wasn't playing anywhere else and we could question if
there would be the present scene without that influence.

Ironically for all us "old" farts I know of an all age club in Portland
where they don't want any DJ's over 21, which may be a fitting reward
since that crowd can't go to commercial clubs.  Hopefully the youth will
surprise us all with their raw talent and ability to come up with new
twists on "That Ol' Black Magic"

Maybe as a last consideration we can hope that the new generation will
give props to the last few generations that created and sustained this
music before there was any economic incentive ie. marketing potential
and not fall into the standard age discrimination that has been
perpetuated by the media as a marketing angle.

I can think of lots of wise mature people who have contributed to our
present consciousness such as Timothy Leary, Genesis P'Orridge, James
Brown, George Clinton, Hendrix, and all the other teachers who taught us
how to funk, going back to blues, jazz, R&B, house and disco.  Back in
the blues period they used to say "you had to pay your dues" whereas now
you can just bite some rythyms off a sample cd or pop some prefab MIDI
sequences in your computer and be funky and put out a hit record--it
didn't used to come so easy.

Peace Out and in the spirit of the holidays an olive branch for my
friends that dog me out and make me work a little harder--the
controversy makes it interesting--or we could all just go back to
sleep...  

:)

Hello Stonehenge! What a great party! Such a great diversity of music in all
rooms!
All I can say is..

GARTH

WAS 

ON!!!!!


@ 4:40am, he busted out with some *****HUGE***** Jammy-jams! My body was
unable to withstand the groove overload, and did finally succumb to the deep
bass which kept me in the zone for hours! And then, just when we all thought
his set was done, from out of nowhere, a girl with a beautiful voice started
singing, people started cheering,  clapping,  and before you know
it....awwwww yeah! Here come the Beats...round 2!

Great great time!

Well, 2 bummers tho.. at about 4:45 or 5am, during Garth's set, I dropped my
Arnettes (silver sunglasses) which were in a red little felt-type sunglasses
bag with little drawstring... I went back but all I found was the red
bag....all dirty and abused. It looked at me from the floor...I saw its
pain...all crumpled and dirty.. ashamed of itself... violation written all
over it's little felty skin... Looking at me as if to say..
"Whyyyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!"  What's even worse is that they were new and
specially made to order for me with special lens/frame combination by
Arnette at an ugly cost...and I loved 'em dearly... :( So if anyone found
some..... ju know what to do mane..

bummmer #2.. A miscommunication on who was in which car of the caravan left
me and my bro stuck in Oakland after the party...You know it's a bummer when
you suddenly realize that your friends pulled a major rookie maneuver and
left without you...just how far you are from home, it's 8am, light and
bright out....and all you have to put over your eyes is a little dirty red
sack with a drawstring that won't shut up about never being able to trust
anyone anymore.

Sheeeeeesh..

AufwiederavEn,
Steve

Warning:
If you only like positive posts, press 'd' now.

I, for one, did not have too great of a time. It was too big, too
dark, and I spent more time wandering around alone looking for a
familiar face than I did actually dancing. The only sense of
'Gathering' that I felt was actually 'Herding' as I joined large
throngs of people trying to push each other from room to room.

I've never been to Home Base before, and the space was not bad for a
large venue. My only complaint was the cement floors (which hurts my
knees when dancing), but other than that I suppose it was okay. But as
I drove into Oakland, it made me feel sad to see the ugly, failed
metropolis looming through my windshield. It reminded me how shakey
the SF underground has been lately...Parties have been busted left &
right, and, true, you can get permits in Oakland, but it's just not
the same as being in San Francisco...

At times, I felt like I was more an observer than anything else. The
DJ was very often this tiny figure way off in the corner. I never did
find the DJ booth in the house room, and as a result I felt like I was
at club. Not a bad thing (I've certainly had my days as a clubber),
just the environment and the vibe was very club-like.

I'm usually not a big fan of vendors at raves, but the people last
night seemed to be selling good, hancrafted stuff...Didn't really
check out any of it since I was low on cash.

On the plus side, the music was really really good. Good, hard dark
teksteppy jungle ruled the smaller dance area for some time. Even the
house room was good, and I'm usually not into house. The sound system
was really powerful...one of the first times in a long time that I've
heard such chest-pounding bass at a party. But the sound was really
too loud for me. Yes, even me, after years of hearing loss from raving
and punk rock...alas, my ears still hurt like hell.

Anyway, my original intent was to go to Riot 23, a small underground
jungle and techno party in Berkeley, but they were busted. It's really
a shame. Oh well! Now I know for sure: no more big parties for Steve! :)

(okay, ready, set...flame!)

Steve

We got to Oakland at 2am, and on our way into the Home Base parking
lot some punks decided that my friend had looked at them the wrong way,
so they jumped out of their car and starting shoving him around.
One kid was obviously off his ass on something and kept saying
"I hate all you fucking white people".  The kid was mexican so I 
thought that was kindof odd.  Anyway, we talked our way out of it
and headed in.  There was no line (thank god) and the place was
pretty packed.  Very young crowd... despite being supposedly 18 and over,
I saw lots of girls that were clearly under 18.  That's cool with me
though :)  I spent the night in the house room.  (You know you're having
a good time when all of a sudden the music breaks, you check your watch
and it's 5:30).  The music was good solid house only occasionally venturing
into SanFranDisco land.  There was a fairly good vibe and I talked to lots of
strangers.  I must have had a sign on my back that said "I (heart)
circle dancers" cause it seemed like everywhere I went, some
kid tried to start up a circle.  Towards the end there was big circles
at all the speaker stacks taking up major real estate.  Oh well.
The DJ booth was in the middle of the room, which helped alleviate
the "sit down in the middle of the floor" problem at the 4yr Gathering.
Visuals were great, free water.
Don't know about the bathrooms since I never had to go (I was sweating
too much).  Didn't see one person I recognized (probably the sfravers
were in the techno room).  All in all I had a good time, and I still think
Home Base is a fine place to throw a massive.

Well, needless to say it was my first -LARGE- rave like that.  I've always
tended to hang out at the smaller trance/ambient raves in SF - those don't
seem to ever get busted. :)  Anyway, of course Stone(r)henge was Gr8! and
the laser was trip trip rip, and the ambient room...w00 w00... can you say
ORBED OUT... and the front high energy room :) :)  All were well done.
People were ok to meet, somehow being the happy face I am I am always
getting offered a hit of this, a drag of that, there's extra water if you'd
like! :)  That was the good part, those treasured moments of personable
expression with a few strangers.  What I didn't like was, only the one
doorway into "Stone(r)henge".  After a couple trips back and forth it got
so crowded i was yelling to my friend, "Hey! Let's do that again!" :)  And
I would have to concurr about the "hurding" effect.  I know it might hurt
the promoters, but maybe it WOULD be a good idea to limit attendence so
that people could actually move around and dance without flailing
uncontrollably into 7 people walking through. :)  well well... just my
silly comments :) :) :)  Oh....great....go to rest my legs byt watching R&S
and wind up never getting a chance to sit on the couch :)  Too much tension
outside though....I wanna get my money back....arguing....ego
challenges...and I see what's meant by the Adiddas logo wearing - are there
Adiddas reps not handing out sportsware at raves or are these just silly
people who don't realise they'd look better on a tennies court instead
because they're so blindsided by "fad" "fashion" "the in" "gotsta dress
like my G's br0!" bullshit?  Come on people, live your own lives and not
someone else's - express yourself, not some screwy company who's laughing
at you because "FAD" and your part in it is upping their revenue at your
expense.  Uhmmm...just get an independently made smiley face shirt or...
uhm... tidye shirt....yeah....with a sun.... :)  just kidding :)  ok, me
done rambling now.

Had a killer time! I was taking the toys and working the ticket booth...
Amazing how some assholes gave little pieces of shit! Like Happy meal
toys....Oh well, some people we turned away, others we just said...KARMA,
these toys are going directly to kids, so What goes around comes around.....
ANYWAY.. the music was insane , the vibe was really good...EXCEPT, I think
there just was way to many people there! I can't understand how Funky Techno
had 7000 people!! I would have gone crazy! I was really excited to see that
the same DJ's where not playing at the same times they always do! Variety is
the spice of life!!! I just want to say sorry to anyone that I talked to that
thought i was acting silly! So many people offered me little green leafs.. I
forgot my own name! J/k =) 

To sum it all up in one word.... BEAUTIFUL

Hi all!

I expected to have a great time at the Gathering, and I did! I got to see
so many faces that I haven't seen in a long time. I thought the music was
alright, but it was a little too fast for me to get into. This is the first
party I've been to all year where I didn't leave all soaked with sweat from
dancing all night.

You might have seen me walking around the party... I was the bald headed
guy with a white "Burnt Crispies" shirt who was tripping hella hard off of
orange sunshine...

Overall, I had a good time.  I don't know if its me or there seems to be
more things in massives that are bothering me.
I usually go with the expectation that the vibe won't be as good at a
massive.  This seems to be consistantly true, so I go with alot of focus
on enjoying  the visuals and the big sound systems, which I have to say
were great as usual.
The people there seemed very friendly for the most part.  But it seems that
as a whole less and less people are dancing.  There were many people sitting
on the dance floor, and many people continuously walking around through the
middle of the floor seeming to have no intention to find a good spot to 
dance.  And whats up with all these people just standing around the dj.
I'm not a dj myself, and I thought maybe people were trying to get a few pointers
from watching the dj spin.  But it seemed that many were just standing around 
socializing, or just standing around.
I used to like to go up front, because I would find alot of people dancing intensely.

It seems like the concept of shared trance is fading at these massives.

I'm so happy I went over to the smaller room and caught garth's set.  It was nice
to find a good vibe in there.  I found the vibe to be pretty good in that room
all night when I would go.  I kept going back to the main room because I wanted
to hear other music besides the jungle that was playing and to listen to the bigger 
sound system and enjoy the visuals.  
Though I got to say that the jungle music sure is fun, and it seems to create 
a zaney vibe.

The water situation was good, and it was nice to have 3 rooms of music.

Sorry if some of you didn't like some of my venting about the vibe.  I can't
help but have some major concerns about this scene that I love so much
and has brought me so much joy.
Is there a way we can get more people to experience the joys of trancing 
together?
Maybe I should just try to focus more on the people who do enjoy it, and maybe
others will catch on.
Or maybe I need to except the tranceformation that is happening, and give up
on the hope of having a vibe at a massive like the full moon partys at bonny doon.

Any thoughts on this?

I was there! I had really low energy so I didn't do any dancing (which
is a first for me at a party this good.)  Some observations:

	*   DJ in the center:  It takes longer for this configuration to
	    get moving but once it gets going, it really goes off!!
	    At first I didn't like it cuz it seemed that people just
	    milled around without focus, but once the crowed was
	    subjected to one hard hitting, experienced DJ after another,
	    Ego withered and the vibe started to flow in the main room.

	*   Ethan's Set:   When I came in at 11 pm, Ethan was going
	    off!! Very clear vibe in the air. And the crowd was digging 
	    it.  Martin should have scheduled him later cuz this was the
	    kind of energy that could have turned this into an "insanely
	    great" party.  Still Ethan early built a solid foundation
	    for others to follow, though I would have liked to have in 
	    the main room.

	*   Home Base: They seem to be putting up walls and turning this
	    place into a Rave-o-rama. Not a bad local, Martin you
	    still need to have more free water!

	*   Folks on speed: The only negative thing that I observed is
	    WAYYY too many people on speed. Speed effects the vibe
	    directly, it creates Borg consciousness and directly
	    inhibits the flow of love energy.
	
	*   Kevin Saunderson: Tore it up!. I spent most of my time
	    sitting with Jeno watching this virtuoso deliver the goods.
	    The thing I admired most is that he took chances, he didn't
	    play some canned pre-arranged bullshit and really went for
	    it.  At one point he either hit a scratch or just straight
	    out wrecked but he just backed out and kept gettin' up!
	    Sorta like OK, I fucked up, now let's get on with it.
	    I also liked that he played muusic from different 
	    sub-gendres, I heard detroit techno, euro-techno,
	    hard house, garage, progressive house, even that cheesy
	    professional widow track that actually worked! (All the\	
	    kids that listen to KMEL went crazy!!)  It was great to see
	    a master DJ at work who is capable of playing all styles.

	I'm going to hit Origin, due to their transcendental wisdom
in booking Beyond Race to play for their party. The rest of it may
suck for all I know, but I'm sure I'll enjoy that.

Hi.  I don't hang out here much anymore, but here's a review and some
subjective thoughts.

Arrived 1ish and started out in the main room.  Excellent sound, nice
lazers, friendly people.  Typical East Bay massive vibe; young, happy,
unfocused.  Groups of friends hanging out, socializing.  For at least half
the people there, dancing seemed to be an afterthought.  Decorating the
speaker stacks like Stonehenge was sort of cute, but also reminded me of
the "This is Spinal Tap" movie.  The huge mural of a forest
looked tacky, but I guess it was better than a wall of bricks.

I was enjoying Josh's set, but got a little bored and decided to wander 
around.  The music in the "Experimental" room had shifted to Jungle. 
Now this was more like it.  The tunes were insane and fresh, and people 
were really going off;  I was great to hear music that (for around here)
sounded so new and creative.  It actually felt like a rave in there.
I started having a great time.

After about an hour, I took a break and wandered over to the ambient
area.  Some kind of live act, Ambient Temple of the Imagination perhaps.
There was a pseudo-paganesque style to it, and then some horribly banal
vocals chased me away.  Back to the Jungle.  Yeah, the people
here were really appreciating the music.  The powerful base and intricate
rhythms pretty much demanded that you either get into it, or leave.  Not
to easy to just stand around and talk here,  though there still
were  a couple of folks who insisted on sitting down in the middle of
the dance floor.  I'd like to say "I'm sorry" to anyone whose hands or
face I may have stepped on, even though I'm really not.

Back in the ambient space, I was amused to see Santa Claus Martin behind
the turntables adding to live mix, though it wasn't clear if what he
was doing actually affected the sound I was hearing.  I would have hung out
there longer but the air was too thick.

After experiencing the Jungle energy, the main room just seemed dull to me.
I wandered in a couple of times, stepped on a few more faces trying to
find a vibey spot.  True, people were having fun, but it was the kind of
fun that any group of high schoolers could have staying up late with their
friends.  It just didn't seem very special.  Perhaps if it was my
first rave, I would have felt differently.  Saunderson played a horribly
cheezey commercial rave tune and I left in disgust.  Yeah, he's a legend;
but that means nothing to me if he's gonna spin crap. (IMO of course).  I
suppose I should have given him more of a chance to impress me.

More fun with Jungle, really killer stuff, DJ Malcom, I believe.  I really 
wanted to hear Tony's set, but now I wasn't sure if I could shift back 
into acid/techno/house.  Once I get really absorbed by the energy of
one musical style, it can be hard to suddenly shift into another.  Sitting
on a the floor somewhere, Peter, Angela and I debated this a little, trying
to figure which DJ would possible be capable of mixing Jungle tunes into
a house set.  Perhaps Markie.

Well, at around 5, I guessed that I should try Tony in the main room. 
But this final foray to the main room only made me realize that I
don't really belong at these kind of massives any more.  By now, it was
just a place to hang out.  As far as the vibe; I might as well have been at 
at a shopping mall.  As good as Tony's set could ever be, I just didn't 
want to be around people for whom it wouldn't really matter.  Sorry, I 
know I'm generalizing here.

But there was hope for me yet.  The Jungle room had just given way to
DJ Garth.  The music slowed, in came the funk, and I knew that something
special was about to happen.

Garth is one of those DJ's who plays records that I would never think of
buying.  It's as though they just wouldn't sound right if they weren't
part of a Garth set. Soulful, funky, deep, twisted.  I don't Garth
personally, but you can feel how he is so emotionally involved
with the music he spins.  The dance groove he creates is less important
that the FEEL grove.  His mixing is pure art:  Anyone can beatmatch, but
Garth will give you tempo changeups and style shifts that while
being totally unexpected, work like a dramatic story, passionate,
with an ebb-and-flow where the emotion of one song sets up the next,
amplifying the power of the moment.  

It was happening; You could feel the energy come together, focused through
he shaman behind the tables, guiding us, taking us to places we rarely
get to go.  It was magical, and the small crowd in the room knew it.
This is the kind of magic I hope for when I go out to a rave.  A true
musical experience.  I'm sure Garth's set would have failed miserably in
the main room, but for me at this party, it was like finding a pearl in 
the carcass of a dead clam.

Now that it's all over, I feel that I was lucky to have had such a great
time.  I can see that that I no longer relate to the mainstream rave vibe.
Martin gave us a great production, but there's nothing he can do to create
the kind of fervor and specialness that I look for at a rave.  That's ok,
I'm really glad that so many other people enjoy themselves at these
kinds events.  Take care, everyone.  I'll see you in the next world, don't
be late.  :)

Good morning boys and girls,

Well let me state first off,  When I usually see a post like this I
think, "Ugh, ANOTHER  loooooooong review??  And hit the DELETE key.  But
If it weren't Rave Related it wouldn't be here (psst. and if ya do read
it YOU might find yourself in it!!!  =) ).

Friday, 
_StarGate_ 

Arrived @ 10:30 to the "spot" (I've  decided that in order to keep
locals secret, the actual geographical locations will be withheld).
There was some chai tea brewing, people talking, struck up an
interesting conversation about harvesting Shroomies with a nice girl
from LA.  Around 11:30 or so the natives were getting restless, still no
sound.   So one of the  promoters and I walked up to the location in the
woods.  After a sorta tiring walk (over the river and through the woods)
we arrive.  He shows me where the turntables will be, the sound, the
tarp to keep us warm.  We share that vision, I can see this party
happening, my belief is solid. Solid enough that I help the promoter
trek ravers up to the site.  Chatting with a few, I come across fellow
SFRavers (hi guys and gals) and we share the enthusiasm of the UG scene.

But we're not too enthusiastic @ 1AM when the other organizer says,
"that's it. it's too wet...".  I remember this promoter from a beach
party in some remarkably cold weather last year.  The cards of fate are
sure unkind to some...  We (about 50 or so partygoers) all head down the
hill, back to our cars, and head our separate ways. I trek home and
crawl into bed @ 3AM or so...

Saturday:

_Gathering_  (here comes the weird part)

So here I am with two newbes (their first rave being Galactic Tunnel
last week), our intentions were to be at this serious hardcore/ jungle
party in Oakland (_Riot 23_),  But afta calling the VM every 15 mins.
from 9PM till 10:30  we say, "Screw it, let got to a Massive".

We get three @ 11PM, No line.  The fine blend of herbs and spices I
inhaled are beginning to take effect.  As I walk in my mind, body,
spirit is "feeling" the crowd, the vibe. So many are here with different
intentions.  It's hard to focus...  My friends are saying something but
it's all quite far away  Im drawn to the front of the room, Ethans
spinning, I get down & start grooving.  I see Claire,  some of the other
"Family members" are around ... Im home again, part of the music, part
of the scene this is a massive but the underground "feel" is evident...
Am I connected -  Yes.

After ethan finishes his set  I decided its time to explore.  I wander
down this huge hallway, past a coat check,  There's a movie room playing
some claymation, I walk past the chill room and into the vending area.
I sneak up behind my friends who are looking around.  they're suprised
to "find" me smiling behind them like an idiot.  We trek back to the
movie room take a few puffs and start cracking jokes about life, TV, the
world.  We're in hysterics in less than 15minutes.  I look at this newbe
and see a reflection of my younger self, looking into the new world we
call the underground.  He's only  eighteen, the same age as I was when I
started. He's trying to connect. 

But there is still that competitive streak in both of them, they want to
"bust it"  and throw down in the house room.  I agree.  My essence is
drifting into  there reality. That other tribe.
*************************************

So check it, The 411 is that I'm OOC (out of commission) since
Ubiquitous.  Doing some serious footwork, I  Kneed it hard.  Keeping my
leg in straps (And still wearing a brace) I've been in the shadows for
the last few weeks...  So  once I hit the circle, I feel that vibe...
Some serious breakdancers doing flips, flops, flares, you name it.  This
is where the Pro's play,  You best have your set in or out be set out...
 I get my body into the vibe,  See the dancers, feel which ones "have
it", and which ones are acting...

There it is, Im there.  My mind is clear ,I know my path. I hit the
floor aware that my leg can't do the groundwork its accustomed to. So I
break into some fast stepping the crowd responds. A few lasers are on my
feet, the song bust into  a drumroll, im spinning fasta than an a
black'n'decker eggbeater.  I see  cigarette ashes on the floor. It's a
firewalk. Those "there" see it others are stupefied at the speed.  It's
all onbeat which make it more intense... 

I snap out. Back in a massive, the music's playing and someone is
patting me on the back.  I smile, I look back in the circle, someone is
"calling me out"  kicking out some splits with his walk.  I can go to
his level and start a "war"  a few other dancers eye me, they got's my
back.  But I don't wanto go there. Im thirsty. I turn, dissolve into the
crowd and get some water.
*************************************
I'm inline smiling:
"Umm, is this, like, the water line or something"
"No, it's over there"
"Ok"
I get to the right line and strike a conversation with (Sam?). His first
rave.  We chat all the way to the front of the water line.  He's amazed
at all the "cool" people here.  He's 26 and remembers breaking back in
the late 80's. I tell him I've been in the know for a wile and we both
"trade" stories. Im seeing the party though this guy's perspective.
Loud.  Cool. We depart at the water line and head into our separate
realities.  He's getting connected.

I hear the jungle throbbing through the walls.  I head back to the
"family" room and see others of our kind.  Ethans dancing in the front
of the room, I see some of the Harmony crew, Claire and Co. are still
around.  I see many new faces that are SFR by their attitude.  Run into
a Junglist that I see, oh, every month or so...  Shes from LA and
"cooling off outside"  I have my huge water bottle and share with
everyone. Only a couple of gulps from me and I pass it off to the
crowd...
I start going deep into the audio world of jungle. Some cute girl with a
(red, Orange?) shirt w/ a lil monster- type thingie on it ask me what DJ
is playing.  I tell her I have No Clue.. We smile at that response.  I
dance around more the vibe has caught me again. I can't control my body,
just letting the sound move me.  I rarely feel such freedom, not in this
world of computers, deadlines,  and paperwork.  I ask that girl for some
of her water we kneel and sip.  We both stay on the floor for a while,
both enwrapped in that serious jungle vibe.  I can't believe I can feel
this way, all of this is with just the music.  No E, no speed.  I try to
talk to her but I can't form words.  I glance her way smiling...
And we go our separate ways....
What happened?

Im back on the floor dancing I see another familiar face, a girl I know
from high school.  I was raving when she was doing her SAT's.  She asks
me what Im doing and I realize im sitting in a pile of clothes and
backpacks.  Wasn't I just dancing a minute ago?  Am I high?  Is it the
vibe?  I figure out that im living in the now of things, I can't
remember 5 minutes ago cos it already happened, all these thoughts are
rushing through my mind, yet im still holding a conversation with this
girl who's name I can't remember (oh, yea.. Hi Jen).  She puts her
backpack down and I still sit for a while longer before that wave of
music engulfs me again...  

Im walking back to get some more water and run into Thomas Trouble, we
chat about Karma III  it's gonna be the bomb I think, lotsa trance
allnight long.  Thomas is really excited about the venue, the sound
system, and the people. And Im ready for it (Friday -Dec 27th).  

Im dancing next to Ethan and offer him some water, the water bottle
disappears for a while but I really don't care.  If it's needed its
needed we all get thirsty out there. I see someone I don't recognize
reaching for a backpack I look at him and sense fear.  He looks back,
eyes wide and drops the backpack, he disappears in the crowd.
---I think I just stopped a theft.---
I get wrapped up in that reality , the cute orange shirt girl is gone,
the water bottle is no longer in existence.  I'm a guard of sorts,
watching out for my fellow scenesters.  I give a glance to people who
are unfamiliar to me.  I stay in this state for I don't know how long...
I know im getting paranoid.  But during this state this scene replays
itself at least four more times:

      Person A walks up to the DJ booth, he looks around.
Me:  I glance back at him, "message one:  Don't even think of it"
      He walks up to a backpack or jacket...
I step up a little more and focus more attention to him.
      He see me and gets it.  He bolts.

I cant stand it anymore. I don't like this reality.  I step away. and
wander out of the room.

Im in the movie room alone, laughing  my  A** off @ the Ren and Stimpy
Show.  As much as I want to chat with people, I feel mentally damaged
trying to wipe out the oh to real sense that everyone isn't as PLURRY as
we make them out...  Im drifiting. I want to dance for the vibes sake
again.
Trying to connect.
****************************************
Here's the deal,  Im stepping in the main room, I see about three
circles going .  I break off into a smaller  group and am dancing, the
place looks more like a giant chill area than a rave, many people just
standing around and watching us dancers than actually moving about.
Many E faces, fish bellies, or other wacked out folks are on the sides.
I try to find a vibe. or at least make my own.  Many times one or two
ruffnecks step up to take the Pepsi challenge and I hush them in their
puppies. Trix are for kids any many of them are just bunnies getting
jacked by this rabbit.  

What happened?  I snap back and noticed I was in yet another  circle.
The pros were stepping out now, as much as I wanted to bust with a flip
or flare I knew my knee would be most unforgiving in the morning.  So
off I go again...
************************************
Sitting back in the jungle room some one asks me for a cigarette,  I
offer her some alternate smokable instead.  We blend our, ahem, stuff
and chill for a but.  I see Steve S. Bouncing with energy which sparks
that vibe in me.. I  stand up and am dancing again in that junglish
state.  I see some others that are having a good time. failing arms in
the air.  And somewhere the music changes more into a breakbeatish type
vibe complete with scratching (although I think its the record not the
DJ).  Suddenly one of the two newbes I came with is there. we go
searching for the second one and find him shortly.  I ask someone and
find out it's 6:30. Im hungry.  We bail out while some girl is singing.

I had a great time, (I think).

And for the 2000+ people who don't know me, I was the guy in blue with a
Fall long sleeve shirt with concert dates on the back.

It is indeed the vibe that keeps me going.  I try to help create it by
dancing, or mixing when I get the chance.  And hopefully, maybe you too,
dear raver, see that truth.  I try to keep positive dispite the negative
that massives carry.  Maybe that's why I only do massives once a year...
 Maybe that's why I try to mix and help throw the UG's.  Maybe that's
why I have a underground mixtape circulating out there.  It's not THAT
great, but I think it's OK.  (oh, yea don't PAY for this tape it's a
freebe.  If you want one, send me an email and we can arrange
something.).  Let's be positive people, cos' no one is going to do it
for us...
Lets keep that vibe alive.  CU @ Karma. and Galactic Tunnel.

"just another weekend"

       "Might as well be shot for a wolf as a sheep!"

        Remember that saying & attitude? If I decide that somebody
        is scary based on their looks or whatever, it tends to
        activate this attitude in the person I've so judged.

        Strangely enough, non-judgement & fearlessness also seems
        to work well with the "real" wolves much of the time.

I had a great time at the Gathering, although admitedly the moments of pure
serene power were sparse and a bit unbalanced. That tends to be true at
most large massives, and seems to be getting more true as we get further
away from a certain point where everything got really focused in 1992...
but since then the Gathering and other similar parties have always done
very well at bringing me back to that original point, and I was very
exicted and satisfied with what happened on Saturday night. I'm always
amazed at the sheer number of diverse people that can come together and
contribute toward a single (more or less) cause... that is, if nothing
else, letting go of their regular life and having fun with all these other
people, opening the doorway for mysterious new music and forces to enter
their lives. And with so many people it can really be quite a struggle
getting everyone to let go just enough to keep the energy flowing... but it
always happens, even if we only get to feel it for a second, that moment
when everyone resonates in synch and the energy shoots off toward infinity.
That moment when healing occurs, that moment that is so powerful that a
memory is forged into your mind with such force that you can never forget
it. That's why I will always love massives... even though it's not always a
smooth or easy ride, those moments are such incredible experiences, and
provide the starting points for such grand new dreams.

I think as the scene develops and grows, it develops habits. It gets
expectations. In the beginning, it was the transcending of these habits and
expectations that created such an incredible experience... now, we are
struggling... because the vehicle by which we first found this transcension
is now so full of routine and order that it's no longer the door to a new
world, just back into the old one. As a whole, the rave scene is still
newer than most of things we deal with in life, and still provides an
incredible experience... but I see that as fading as time goes on, unless
you personally can realize your routines and find a way to alter them. I
think the concept of shared trance is closely tied in with this, in that
the motivation for letting go of yourself, putting yourself into that
trance state, is in seeking for change. Seeking those other worlds. People
aren't as interested in seeking anymore because they have fallen into the
routine of going to the party. They know what goes on already, so why
should they look for something else. It's a bit of a curse, really. The
answer to the question must keep changing in order to keep itself alive. If
it doesn't change, it starts to decay. But there is a solution. Every new
idea or change has a starting point, namely you. If people aren't dancing,
they will continue not to dance until you start. Forget about all of them
and just start moving to the music. Then everyone will follow. If people
aren't listening to the music, it's up to you to listen. Stop paying
attention to the people who aren't listening and start listening. Soon
enough you will find swarms of people all intently listening to the music,
which will lead everyone toward the shared trance experience.

The scene must change in order to survive. If it doesn't it will get stale
and eventually die. But that means that you must be willing to change along
with it, if you want to continue to share in the incredible experiences
that it can give you. The massives have just as much of a vibe as smaller
parties... sometimes far stronger ones because of all the people
involved... but it is often more difficult to get ourselves to the point
where we can appreciate it. And then when we get there, it might only be
for a fleeting moment before we lose our balance and fall again. It is we
who have to let ourselves go if we want to witness the incredible.
Everything begins and ends with you. and I do mean everything. The vibe you
experience streams from you alone... and it can move through 50 other
people or it can include 10,000 other people... but ultimately you are the
one who must come to terms with it and control it. You must initiate it and
be willing to keep it going, reaccepting it when it comes back to you. If
you close yourself off, fall into routines or develop expectations that
open the possibility of failure, you will find yourself struggling to keep
yourself truly living.

And back to the party...
The sound was great (well balanced), the music was mostly excellent. I
really enjoyed the small room. Sometimes the bass in that room had all my
bones vibrating. It was a neat sensation dancing with that. The large room
had a couple awe inspiring musical moments but with so many people
wandering around aimlessly I had a hard time focusing myself on it. I would
keep forgetting to listen. And socially, I saw lots of very nice people,
and ran into some long lost friends I haven't seen for over a year.
Dancing-wise, I danced for about six or seven hours before my body went
kaputt, and enjoyed every minute of it.

and for Todd, it's always in the darkest hour when the miracles begin.

I liked this one (And I don't even watch TV)

by Frank Cammuso and Hart Seely          57 ELM STREETBETHLEHEM,
PA.11:51 P.M., DECEMBER 24TH          We're too late! It's already been
here.           
Mulder, I hope you know what you're doing.           Look, Scully, just
like the other homes: Douglas fir, truncated, mounted, transformed into
a shrine; halls decked with boughs of holly; stockings hung by the
chimney, with care.          You really think someone's been here?
    
Someone, or something.          Mulder, over here-it's a fruitcake.
     Don't touch it!  Those things can be lethal.           It's O.K.
There's a note attached: "Gonna find out who's naughty and nice."
  It's judging them, Scully.  It's making a list.           Who?  What
are you talking about?           Ancient mythology tells of an obese
humanoid entity who could travel at great speed in a craft powered by
antlered servants.  Once each year, near the winter solstice, this
creature is said to descend from the heavens to reward its followers and
punish disbelievers with jagged chunks of antracite.          But that's
legend, Mulder-a story told by parents to frighten children.  Surely you
don't believe it?          Something was here tonight, Scully.  Check
out the bite marks on this gingerbread man.  Whatever tore through this
plate of cookies was massive-and in a hurry.          It left crumbs
everywhere.  And look, Mulder, this milk glass has been completely
drained.
          It gorged itself, Scully.  It fed without remorse.
But why would they leave it milk and cookies?           Appeasement.
Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.          But if
this thing does exist, how did it get in?  The doors and windows were
locked.  There's no sign of forced entry.          Unless I miss my
guess, it came through the fireplace.           Wait a minute, Mulder.
If you're saying some huge creature landed on the roof and came down
this chimney, you're crazy.  The flue is barely six inches wide.
Nothing could get down there.          But what if it could alter its
shape, move in all directions at once?          You mean, like a bowl
full of jelly?           Exactly.  Scully, I've never told anyone this,
but when I was a child my home was visited.  I saw the creature.  It had
long white shanks of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshapen head.  Its
bloated torso was red and white.  I'll never forget the horror. I turned
away, and when I looked back it had somehow taken on the facial features
of my father.          Impossible.          I know what I saw.  And that
night it read my mind.  It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully.  It
knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head!          I'm sorry, Mulder, but
you're asking me to disregard the laws of physics.  You want me to
believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings
gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you're saying.  Do
you understand the repercussions? If this gets out, they'll close the
X-files.          Scully, listen to me: It know when you're sleeping.
It knows when you're awake.          But we have no proof.          Last
year, on this exact date, SETI radio telescopes detected bogeys in the
airspace over twenty-seven states.  The White House ordered a Condition
Red.         But that was a meteor shower.          Officially.  Two
days ago, eight prized Scandinavian reindeer vanished from the National
Zoo, in Washington, D.C.  Nobody-not even the zookeeper-was told about
it.  The government doesn't want people to know about Project Kringle.
They fear that if this thing is proved to exist the public will stop
spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy.  Retail
markets will collapse.  Scully, they cannot let the world believe this
creature lives.  There's too much at stake.  They'll do whatever it

What a party heh?   =]:..

   Actually though, myself.  I loved that high speed metal house they were
playing in the little Jungle room at the beginning of the night. That was
so much fun to dance to..  And the Jungle was awsome!

Hey Jonda.

  Yea, at Funky Techno...  They had another room opened up.
  If you haven't seen it before, it's unbelieve-able!  It is about as big
as the two big rooms put together.
  It's hard to amagine there is another room this size hiding in the back.
But it's there I tell yea.  =]:..

I had fun to though. Alone.  I just can't stand "walking around" with my
friends @ such big parties. Herding along nStuff. So I mostly stayed in one
place dancing.

God your review and the other big one a few before it are what the Dance
Trades should be about!!! 

Even tho' 2 different people have a 180 degree take on Saunderson (did
he do that wack "Rock to the Beat" song? ...some old master did it...)
it's nice that someone will express an opinion on one of the "Gods of
Techno" and willing to take a shot at our "holy cow."

These reviews are really nice for us out in the boonies as it's almost
like going to a mini rave while reading the post--excellent descriptions
that almost make you feel there especially if you put on some music
while reading.

It's kind of funny hearing the stuff that annoys people at events there
coz when you are in the country you feel like "Send us your cheesiest
dance promoters...please!  We'll take them...) and I guess it's nice you
big city folk can get spoiled  :)

If you don't write for some mag you should --I really enjoyed your post.

Look out 'coz one of my nasty stinkbomb posts are on the way!!!

I must protest alittle here.

  I myself cannot do speed. My body is just not constructed for such
abusive substances.
  I am sorry that I don't express love at your parties Qeoff. I wish I
could but I can't, I tryed, and I will not fake it.
  Unfortunetly for me, taking E creates even more walls. I cannot open up
on the shit. I can not socialize on the shit. All it does for me, is free
me of the retchid pain of dancing, to hard and to long.
  Alot of people that see me, think I do WAYYY to much speed. I've heard
it, I will hear it agian. I don't do it!

  But anyways.  For my sake.  Why don't you just concentrate on having a
good time. Don't worry about that guy over there that doesn't seem to be a
nice / open individual. 
 And, you don't know. You don't know what he is thinking, you don't know if
he has good or bad intentions. And you don't know if he is on speed. If it
really concerns you though, maybe you should go up and ask the person if he
is having a good time or not. Try to understand the person alittle.
 You might of had a better time knowing that thoughs Borgs were enjoying
them selves as much as you were.


Something like that.

I don't know..  It was progressive house on 45. It sounded great. It had a
"smooth" rythm, it was really Really fast, yet no jungle beats.

Okay, once again I found out that I'm going to be hosting Monday Night
Dinner! :) Which is cool, but between everyone being gone for holiday
vacation and all, I'm not too sure what sort of interest there is,
and I have yet to come up with a place to eat...

So this week's pre-Mad dinner is going to be a bit more *interactive*
(love those buzzwords! :) than usual. What I need from _you_ is a quick
email note (in private please!) telling me:

1) If you're interested in having dinner with a bunch of wacky raver
types/computer geeks (and who wouldn't be???) tonight.
2) Any suggestions for dinner. Note that it should reasonably priced
and be able to accommodate vegetarians and vegans (and in SF).

As always, dinner will be at 8:30pm, and afterwards, we go to Mad at
the lovely and fabulous Bahia Cabana at Market and Franklin. This
week is an extra good lineup, too! (Ethan, Joe Rice, and Alex)

So sorry for the last minute notice... Also, if you can't get to your
email later, call the saturn5 line; I should have some info posted there:

415.248.1997 (saturn5)

I'll post to the list later on with where we're going, and also put it
up on the voicemail (along with directions).

Wussup

Wearing Nike Air ACG shoes, a hooded blue plaid shirt bought at the Main
(& only) Mall up here, baggy brown corderoy shorts (Mall) over a
Canadian full length wooley
(Army Navy)

I got a Nike pencil bag I carry my checkbook in
And a bunch of other stuff like dat coz I like Nike

Despite that Nike goes back before rap music I 've never found a
better--more comfortable shoe and I've done a lot of hiking

If you dance a lot and notice how your feet break easily when you break
you appreciate the most well engineered walking shoe.

Nike consistently comes up with ravish (futuristic) designs, check out
their Air Moccasins my vote for The Rave Dancing Shoe

OK so you can buy the complete gangsta outfit in any American
mall--Isn't it funny that a lot of malls won't let groups of gangsta
looking dudes in?

You used to have to work a little for the gangsta look but now you can
just drive up to the mall and have a gangsta makeover

I think a lot of early ravers liked to wear that pop look from the
sixties with plastic bright clothes like Deelite, and huge garish logos
were modeled after the cheesiest things like Tide cartons remember?

To me rave was about James Bond (Mod) futuristic gadgets which I guess
is a ruboff from working with high tech gear like samplers and recording
studios but it seemed like rave was about jumping into the future before
it got here, like the Jetsons (old skool Bart Simpson in the future, air
cars, etc)

When it hit the West Coast the people most sympathetic to it were mostly
hippy types who have a whole 'nother value system based on a lot of
guilt for being white <I couldn't resist that cheap joke forgive me  :>
but the irony of history huh?>

Besides slowing down the frenzy of Techno to a more mello Trance and
House BPM the whole laid back West Coast vibe kind of replaced the Pop
aspect of Rave with the Hippy value system descended from the Deadhead
movement.

My point being as to the previous reference to Adidas (never liked LL
Cool J that much either) which is a staple of the Corporate Hip Hop
Gangsta (tm) look do you think the Army would rather turn a Gangsta into
a killing machine or a Hippy into a killing machine?... 

Well all you have left are Alternative Rockers and they are basically
Hippys (somebody correct me on this.)

My whole point is that if one shops carefully, one can either have the
Corporate Hippy (Alternative) (tm) look; the Corporate Hip Hop Gangsta
(tm) look;  or the Corporate Pop Mod New Wave (tm) look, aka Corporate
Rave look for about the same cost.

Now Hip Hop followers have their own way to acquire the look at a low
cost but that subject belongs on another list.

Obviously the real old skool Hippies do not want to pay money for
clothing (why do we have to wear clothes anyway...everybody get nekked!"
it's just a material thing and it's all part of this Maya which is Hindu
for Illusion.

Any Buddhist will tell you the same thing but these days if you shop for
authentic imported Tibetan doo-dads like a lot of rich Hippys wear you
will pay way more than for a well researched Gangsta makeover.

Which brings us to the subject of Corporate Rave (tm) (boo-hiss) the
Evil Empire of the Rave Philosophy (tm).  

I say now that every newjack raver is striving for more authenticity,
which leads to that Hippy/anarchic lifestyle (have you ever priced a lot
of the baggy, torn up, hip surfer designer shorts the authentic
Deadheads wear, apparently for most of their puberty? <I mean the same
pair :) > 

Despite the authentic never washed look which might have changed their
color, you can usually catch a swank designer label like Stussy or
Jeanco that go for $50-$60 a pair (unless shopping around) at your local
Mall.

Not that the custom designer farmer johns ($90-$150) you see at WC raves
are cheap, check your local surf/sk8/snoboard shop.

Now you can always tell a real Hippy from an Alternative newjack because
a real Hippy always got their clothes at Salvation Army or another
thrift store (see...this kewl Paisley shirt only cost me $1.50!!!...)
though of course some will make their own clothes or give them away.  

The Alternative Rocker wears a descendant of the WC Surfer look which to
be authentic must have a pair of Levi's 501's (buttons only) and a plaid
shirt from Pennys or Sears--though now you can buy the cheap imported
plaid shirts for almost less than a T-Shirt (shop around) and still look
Alternative.  Throw in a name down jacket like North Face and the
Alternative Grunge look can skyrocket way over a full blown Gangsta look
in cost.

What is the answer re non-materialism posed by the previous reference to
Adidas logos at a party?  

You better give up music people coz all your records are made of plastic
and the factories that turn out plastic are also poisoning the
enviroment, besides all the chemicals that go into manufacturing a hi-fi
setup or the computer you are using.

If you really want to approach the full effect of being non-material I
suggest becoming a Buddhist.  Also I got my Nike ACG's for about the
same cost as that eighth of green bud you bought for $50 that lasts a
few days and is gone. 

Has anyone ever wondered how your average Hippy can afford to pay more
for an oz. or two than many of us pay in rent?

My Nike's are helping to keep some Asian or Mexican employed as all of
our jobs are being shopped off to third world countries so we can afford
this Corporate Rave (tm) lifestyle with authentic logos.
 
By the way the odds are the DJ's at your gig used a pair of
Technics1200's that approach $1200 a pair list and if they are like the
swanky-dankey DJ's in Europe who have gone mad for mixer designs then
their mixer prob'ly cost about  $600-$1200 also, whereas you could have
a comparable rig with the $240 Gemini or Lineartech 1200 knockoffs and a
$100 Gemini PMX-15A mixer (the best scratch mixer) for way less, and
nobody would notice the difference on the dancefloor.

Forget about the Denon DN-2700 Dual CD player with sampling & pitch
control for $2300.

So at least you got the right idea.  

But you may notice a lot of DJ types go for the Corporate Hip Hop
Gangsta (tm) look also, probably because DJ's have always looked that
way, and if you don't want to stand out in a crowd and still face down a
gang of wanna-be gangstas at your local mall (it could happen you never
know--people are getting shot in malls these days) then the above look
will probably work, and don't you think the Hippy/Alternative, Surfer,
and GQ looks are just as played out?

But nowdays only the Illuminati can tell a B-Boy from a Gangsta or a
DJ--

How Did Big Logos Become In?

I'm working on that one, it's a delicate socialogical subject that as a
Caucasian  person perhaps I'm not fit to answer. Processing.

Ah...in the breakdance days if you did spins and things on the ground or
if you pop-locked like where you roll around on your ankles and stuff
it's nice to have thick padded high top basketball shoes to support your
ankles and so you don't skin your ankles.

The pop-lockers and breakdancers performing on the street usually
started to one-up each other and flashy matching track suits and
colorful shoes were part of the ritual and the show biz of street skilz.

Shoe makers picked up on this trend (clever those marketing types) and
I'd bet B Boys and Breakdancers did more to create the current style of
flashy BB shoes than all these little basketball stars...

It's kind of funny coz all those crews had names like XXX Posse  or
Wrecking Krew (who is doze guys?) and nowadays in England and Scotland
all those guys into Top 40 House :) call their krews "posse" & "krew."

Anyway I'm not doggin' ya your post got me hysterical and this corporate
rave thing is my theme--I think the radicals should jack the corporate
rave apparatus and be driving Mercedes Benz's & Porshes just like the
rappers.  Materialistic?  Go back to bongos and flutes if you want to be
pure--a big sound system or music production setup can cost thousands
these days.

Is it just me or is this same phenomena playing out re Roland 303's and
909's, besides the Technics mania.  The Roland R-8 Mk II just about
beats those machines with envelope control, etc. not that I don't love
analog (yes you can dump those old analogs on me if they are just
sitting around  :)

I was invited to spin at a "non-commercial" underground up here with a
bunch of "family" hippy types but when I mentioned I mostly spun
cassettes (because a fire took out my studio and record collection--I
got tons of dubs from DJ friends and wanted to spend my money on
production gear instead of vinyl or CD's) I got the total stinkeye like
I was a wack amateur <people I scratch mix records--not just spin them>
(so much for non-materialistic hippys.)

In my club DJ days I found that cassettes will play at much higher
volumes than vinyl or CD's as tables will skip and have stylus feedback
and CD's will not track right either, unless you are in an isolated
booth with a seperate monitor system and I hate that setup preferring to
be in the room with the dancers and being able to tweek the room EQ to
suit each song.

Technically a cassette is just as analog as vinyl and you'd have to
think that magnetic oxide could capture more detail than physically
molded plastic grooves (boo-hiss...I can hear the dissing) though it's
harder to beat match and cue up.

Also a real AAA recording would be magnetic oxide all the way (before
you all pass out from apoplexy yes I love 1200's and scratching on
them--and vinyl does sound great, etc. but they are getting way
overblown and overpriced, probably due to the 1200 fad--Technics gotta
be laughing at the CD industry  :)

It's just that as we make all these "sacred cows" and every newjack has
to get a 1200, a 909 and 303 ten years after--- it's almost enough
reason to chuck those machines and try to produce stuff with whatever
you can get your hands on---there's lots or "Ravish" little boxes that
do it all---like Yamaha's little "Nintendo" SY series or Rolands new
MC-303, besides in the latter all the work's been done for you---built
in drum and bass loops, etc.

Make an "all digital" mix; make an "all analog" mix;  make an
analog/digital blend mix; get a blender out of the kitchen and make an
industrial mix, etc.

I'm burnt out reading Mix Magazine (the big slick recording studio rag,
not the English DJ mag) where you feel an inferiority complex if you
haven't traded in your 16 or 18 bit system for a 20 to 24 bit digital
audio workstation starting at $150,000

So my current project is just using an old 808 (yeah it's all I have
besides the DX and some general MIDI sets) and turntables/scratch mixing
to do some minimalist Electro style jams--it's a little more challenging
to make a mix live to tape than relying on the ease of a computer
sequencer.

Better yet use the Roland GM set that comes with Quicktime or use MOD
sample loops--which is probably gonna be the trend for the next decade
because it lets anybody get in the game.

So if you want to get into record production you better brace yourself
for the materialistic, cliquish, mucho dinero, faddish high tech rat
race or else people like you won't buy the record if it wasn't made with
303's & 909's and played for your massive on some 1200's

War & Peace Out

Hmmm am I missing something? I thought I was saying that people shouldn't take

Hmmm I don't think people should take E at a party either, if that's not their thing.
Personally I haven't taken any E at a party in about 10 monhs.I've had 1 trip all year,
not boasting or making any judgement, for me, all of these substances are a tool, if the
vibe is not right? Why bother?

my analysis was not based strictly on the observation of individuals.  When you have been
immersed in drug culture for a long time you learn to sense the signature vibe associated
with heavy use of each substance, Our bodies are made up of mostly water and our nervous systems utilize electricity to trigger
movement and send information around.
It's no big deal for sensitive individuals to get "contact highs" by just being in a room with people who are doing a lot of a
particular substance.

Also the use of meth makes people smell a certain way :)

But check it out. You say

"If the vibe is not right? Why bother?"


  I'm just saying, I just hope that my lack of open-ness and compassion
isn't the cause of this bad-vibe you sence.
  I mean. I am a quiet ravEr. Is this bad?
  When I dance, I stand out alot. And becouse of it, it seems as if alot of
people wanna talk to me. Should I stop and have a conversation with all of
them? Can anyone say "I need time to dance"? But the messed up thing is; I
would love to stop and talk. But I have nothing to say most of the time.
Sorry! I suck or something. =]  Seriously though. I am usually pretty damn
tranced.

  When it comes down to it thugh. The only reason this shit bothers me is
becouse. I can't help myself. I am quiet! Girls don't like quiet guys. Guys
think negative things about quiet guys. No one feels comfertable around
guiet guys!
  So what do you think? Should I stop going to ravEs to save that open/love
vibe? I mean. I don't have it. So I should just get lost huh, what you
think?

Babble, babble,  sorry for the confusing spam stuff.

Hi all!  =)

 What a great time!! I havn't been to a large party in so long. And I 
really wanted to go. I knew a lot of people who were going and the DJ 
lineups looked really good.

Great stuff;

 Saying hi to Richard Sun from Ambient Temple Of Imagination. We had 
worked together at a party called Beltane a number of years ago (at the 
Fashion Center in the basement). Richard invited me to join him and I 
contributed some vocal stuff (alien languages, musings, semi-tortured 
sounds). Then Richard pointed to the the coffin and told me to mix 
something up. ACK!! I'm a CD man myself and had never touched a 1200 and 
mixer before. My virgin spinning experience was at the Gathering. I SPUN 
AT THE GATHERING!!!!!! But I must say it didn't last long.  =)

 Being shown around by Eric Reynolds (MODA) including where the nice 
bathrooms were. Eric is the bomb in my opinion. Check out his new mix 
tape. I've only heard side A and I really loved it!!

 Really experiencing John Williams (aka Greg's idol) for the first time. The 
man is good! Thanks to Greg for cluing me in.

 Hanging with the Harmony crowd!!  =)

 Meeting Martin. A very serious worker yet able to take time out to be 
silly. Great party Martin!!

 Handing out polished stones, crystals, petrified wood, and obsidian 
arrowheads to random people! It was kinda funny watching people get a 
suspicious look on their face or actually try to avoid me when I offered 
them "free rocks?". It seems most folks appreciated the gesture. What was 
really touching yet very amusing was when folks would offer me money 
after I had already told them it was free. It was reallly fun giving some 
stones to a few of the security people.

 Handing out choclate covered expresso beans.

 Seeing Liquid 7 and Madame Mercury!  =)

 Seeing Terry and his laminates!!

 Seeing Leslie.

 The crowd. Overall a very good feeling with a minimal of hard looks. 
although after talking to all the people who had stuff swiped I'm really 
glad I used the coat check for my backpack.

 Coatcheck people were awesome!  =)

 Meeting the guy who wigged at Phreaky People. He is okay (a little 
strung out looking though) and we exchanged apologies for such an unhappy 
situation. His name is David and he apologises to everyone at Phreaky 
People for trippin' too hard. I gave him some choclate coverd expresso beans.

Less than great;

 I felt the decorations were a bit sparse (and unplanned) but some of it 
looked really good; like the jungle rooms white cloth streamers and 
strobe light circle.
 Also, for a $20 to $25 entry fee I was very dissapointed at the lack of 
intelligent lighting. This would have really made the main floor spectacular.
 Also, I felt that a 3 watt laser was a bit sparse for the main floor. A 
5 watt laser would have been so much nicer.

 The concrete floors were difficult for me to dance on so I didn't do much.

 The ambient room was a little scary looking. The ambient control station 
area was cool but the rest was tacky or uninviting (the mattresses laying 
everywhere made it look like a cheap sex parlor to me).



 Overall a really fun time!! Thanks to everyone I met and partied with! =)

WAIT. How can we keep the DJ community ELITE without imposing some sort of
BARRIER TO ENTRY (e.g. equipment $$$)???

Not to mention the fact that Vinyl is now more expsneive than CDs... I like
vinyl, don't get me wrong, but in the old days, 12" EPs cost $2.99-$4.99.
Now everything is DOUBLE. Vinyl is elite in itself.  You can buy cheap CD
players with pitch controls. You can use tapes- lots of cassette decks have
pitch controls.

>How Did Big Logos Become In?

Think this started as a joke that someone tool too seriously. You do too
good of a job parodying something, people are gonna pick it up as a new
style!

Waiting to see corporate logos on party fliers...

Hey, all!

	I've noticed (and read comments from many others) that it's
difficult to dance on concrete/cement floors, but not so difficult on
hardwood floors.  Does anyone know why?  I thought the shoes I just bought,
which are very springy, would help me to bounce, but my steppin' was
hampered at the Gathering.  What are the relative merits (pros & cons) of
different surfaces upon which to dance?
Curious,

i have taken dance classes for years, always on wooden floors, because
cement can damage your joints(knees, ankles).  cement is much thicker and
harder than wood so cement absorbs the entire shock of your dancing, while
wood allows
for some spring.  this is what i have gathered through my years of dancing.
i hope this helps answer your question.

  I like both cement and wooden floors. Slick tile is better than the both
of em. But nothing tops a basketball court.
  I don't think one is harder to dance on than the other. Once I break out
in a sweat, another energy compounds with the music.
 I could be dancing in a boxing rink, or I could be out doors in the dirt.
I am still going to look just as silly.  =]:..
  But I do think that some floors are harder on your body than others.
  I think bouncing is just a matter of good balance. I find it harder to
balance on the dance floor sometimes with new shoes.

Pros & Cons
---------------------
Wood       Pro: People feel you stomp your feet three yards away.
              Con: Possibility that you might fall into the cellar.
Cement    Pro: You get a rush through your body while stomping.
              Con: Hard to get all the dust off before a ravE.
Tile          Pro: Slick scratching surface for dancing to Carlos.
              Con: Possibility of sitting on a peace of gum, or a
lollpypop.
Court        Pro: People feel you stomp your feet 15 yards away.
              Con: Dancing tell unconcious.

few tape decks have pitch.. Marantz do and they're hella pricy.

as well  you can   in some places  buy used vinyl releases at those above=

My Gathering highlights:

1. Seeing Ran "Dionysus D" Kohn and his guest Barbara. (Thanks for the
comment on my tape. BTW....Anyone still want a complimentary copy....email
privately)

2. How many times did I hear "Where's the DJ booth?". Centered DJ, let's see
what party uses this technique next?!

3. Watching the main room DJs painstakingly glue their ears to the floor
monitors
 
4. Stepping on and getting stepped on in the dark

5. Seeing Martin smile when the clicker hit 3000

6. Receiving an SFRaves laminate from Terry

7. Coatcheck...great idea!

8. Polished floors!! kudos to MO'B.

As mentioned, concrete does not give at all, whereas wood usually does
-- unless it's just sitting on top of concrete.  More give = less shock
to the knees, ankles, etc.

For hard dancing I recommend:
-lightweight shoes (less momentum = less shock)  Doc Martens are qool
and all, but weigh a ton.  And unless I'm at someplace with a mosh pit I
don't need the steel caps.
-sport insoles (Sorbothane, SOF, etc.) intended for running

The insoles make a BIG difference for me.  Get full-length (not just
heel cups), as most dancing seems to happen on the balls of the feet.

If you play domestics, like, say, hmm, Detroit labels =), singles are $3.99
if you order from the source, $5.99 if you buy them locally, so it's
possible to find decent records for a reasonable amount of money. Imports
have gone up in price, but I can't remember ever buying an import for less
than $7, even back in '87 or '88.

It's worth saving up for, although it does tend to take over your life, and
much of your paycheck...

I, for one, have to state after learning to cut some moves in the sand,
any surface is acceptable.  
Concrete can be most unforgiving, esp. when one slips an "Wonk!"you wake
up three hours later in a hospital.

Warning: spelling errors!

It is me!  I'm back to work from this weekend.  For all who did not know it
was my b-day on Sunday.

I went to Microns house and spun a few records after we ate this very good
tai food on haight.  So we head off to HomeBase and there is no line. =)
We walk in and my one friend I brought was picking up his jaw from the
floor all night long.  It was his first time and he had so much fun.

Anyways my high lights for the gathering are:

Alex "fucking" Patterson!!!!!!!!!!  This guy ripped it up, Oh my God!
Malcom X!!!!!!  This is one bad ass jungle dj.
Ethen!!!!!  Dude you tore it up
Joe Rice!!!!!  Excellent  (even though ethen and joe played at the same
time I still heard a little of both) =)
Garth!!!! as usual.

The chill room in general was the bomb!!!!!!

All the people I saw: Terry, Jay, Micron, Libby, Ethan, Li, Sharon, Larry,
Eric, Mosha(sp), Josh, Lots of new people, I can't remember for the life of
me any more names.  You all know who you are! =)  Till next time!!!!!!

The venue was believe it or not my first time there.  I enjoyed it very
much for a MASSIVE!  I have one complaint and I have seen it for many years
so this complaint is worthless, but I would like to say something about it!
Wortheless only becuase I know it wont stop!!!

PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!  Keep your public sex at home.  Jeesh, people you
made me sick.  I can't believe the nerve some people have out there.  Lets
be a little more aware of our drugs we take and try and keep it under
control.  I have been seeing alot of young people really getting messed up
on drugs and letting them selves go.  Young or old we need to have some
sort of awareness when taking substances.  Know your surroundings.  Please!
It was very sad to see some things I saw at the gathering...  Sex is for
private venues not public venues!  I know what I'm saying is not going to
mean a damn thing to the people who do this, but shit I saw really messed
up people not even knowing that there was someone messing with them.  Very
sad folks!  Very sad! =(

On my b-day note, thanks to all the people that said happy b-day to me.
You guys made my night the best b-day ever!  I danced my ass off in the
jungle room so much that I spent almost a hundred dollars on all jungle
tunes last night!=)

And to top it off my boss just gave me $100 dollars for a x-mas present! =)

Thank you all so much for being there with me!


Peace!

Hello all!

	I'm very excited and pleased to say I'm back :)  I waited two weeks
to do this, although I couldn't wait to post my dancefloor question.
Anyway, for those who don't know me, I've been going to parties for two
years (September was my anniversary).  I was introduced to the scene by the
Harmony crew, a wonderful bunch of people (meet 'em!).  My first party was
Jeremiah's E party, and the tickets looked like Disneyland E tickets,
laminated.  It took the first year to figure out some of the differences in
musical styles, and I'm still learning and loving it all :)  It's been
during this past year that I discovered two of my favorite elements of a
rave: vibe and trancing out.  These two things, which work best in
combination, are sooo good for the body, mind, and spirit, when they're
good.  Truly amazing things can happen while dancing :)
	For those of you who know me (there are still a few, right?), I'm
glad to be back, and It's been great keeping in touch with some of you,
even if it was only at parties!  I see many have gone or are going away for
a while.  To those who are I say: best of luck to you, hope to have ya back
before too long.
	Lessee, what else?  Oh, yeah, I'm a Scorpio (beware intensity of
emotion!), I was born during the same few days that Jerry Garcia chose the
name Grateful Dead, the same year of the Watts Riots and not too far from
them (L.A. area).  I've been living in the South Bay since I was four.  I
love beautiful, psychedelic trance, goa trance, any kind of trance that's
not too hard and slamming; I like techno that's not too industrial
sounding, and I like jungle, though most of it I can't dance to ;)
	So, that's me.  I truly believe in trying to live by the concepts
of Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.  I consider myself Christian, but only
because I follow the wisdom of the one known as Christ, and I'm interested
in exploring other philosophies and faiths, because I believe that
organized religion is largely about control, while faith is a personal
relationship with the divine, a little of which I believe resides in each
of us.
Love to all, peace, joy and many blessings, and hope to see ya out there soon!
Eric

	I had a great time. It seemed to have chaotic energy flowing
in many directions, rather than a unified vibe. This was my first massive,
so I don't really have any reference to compare it to. I met several people,
some from the list, and amazingly ran into some people I had met the nite
before at the dregs of a dark rained-out Stargate (amazing because
none of us could recognize each other by sight and there were only about
10 people there anyway - we just happened to start talking about it - 
what are the odds.) Gave away glowsticks & Gatorade (on one level I 
think of a rave as an athletic event - maybe that explains the 
Addidas too). 


	I thought that they did a great job quelling the warehouse-ness 
of the space. Creating a room with a parachute in a warehouse works well. 
The Stonhenge thing was cool, too. Really excellent overall.

	But it can always be done better - so:

	The hardcore/techno room (the one right near the entrance) had some
acoustic & sound problems. The slapback echo on the bass was really noticeable 
in there - probably a function of the room's shape. It seems like something
was distorting or being overdriven - those bass kicks seemed to be turning 
into square waves, which probably means something was clipping. The sound was
so bad in there I couldn't stay & dance, even though I would have preferred
that to what they were spinning in the big room. Oh well. My email course 
"Gain-staging for DJs" is available free to anyone on the list. If you're a
DJ and you don't understand terms like "gain staging", "clipping", "signal 
chain", and "square wave" you *need* to send me mail *now*.

	Sound in the big room was good. Roughly square room with an open
wall. I did most of my dancing in there. The quadrant nearest the open wall 
had the added benefit of more breathable air - aaaah. Excellent. Nice visuals
too.

	Chill room - sound was always good in there. During the early part of 
the evening it was just mind blowingly loud. Loud is often good, but I don't go 
into an ambient room to get my head blown off. It seems like it was louder in 
there than the main room - probably because the speakers were closer in. It was 
packed with people & the air in there was thick with smoke. Does anybody ever 
think of bringing in some big fans to keep the air moving? Later in the evening 
they turned it down, the crowd & air thinned out a bit, and it got really nice.


	Where's the trance music?

	I've heard reports of public sex!!! How the hell did I miss that?! 
All I saw was a little harmless kissing & hugging. Damn! I've GOT to start 
paying more attention to what everybody else is doing & quit all this dancing 
& trancing. Oh well. Could somebody start cruisin around with a spotlite or 
something, just for the benefit of people like me? Please?

So I was sitting around OC thinking I would hook up with the SCR odp for
NYE (is that enought three-letter acronyms or not?) when low and behold, I
get a call from my friend and hero, Joey, and he tells me that he's book
he and I on a train to Monterey!
So looks like I'll be joining all the happy people a little further north
for the event!!!!  I look forward to seeing folks I haven't seen in a
while!!  I don't know exactly what I'm going to wear, but I know I'll have
my SFRAVES laminate proudly displayed!
:)
Hugs, happy holidays, PLUR, etc. etc. etc.

 Now starts the time of year of noraving - seeing the folks and relations,
eating massive quantities of home-cooked food with varying degrees of
gusto, and sometimes wishing you were with your "rave" family instead.

 See you folks after a week ...

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - If the connections to your blood relations are not the best, at least
 you can make guys like me envious and go out and PARTY! ( with all 
 safety precautions and not too much drug-addled public sex, of course...)

Greetings,


 I'm takeing part in an UG psi-trance party on New Years. I 
need transportation help and crew help. I am not making a dime on this 
party so voluteers only need apply. However I can pay the truck driver. I 
will need a large covered truck or van or two smaller vehicles.
 
 I'm totally upgrading the look of my visual show as well as it's 
transportability. 

 I can be contacted here or at the # below.

Hi all,

If anybody finds out info about the FMR, I would be very grateful if you
would let me know!

Today is my birthday and it would be quite a treat to end the day with a
trip to some out-of-the-way spot to dance my butt off.

Respect,

Ann

Mad last night was *extra* good! Ethan played such a hard, crunchy set
that despite the fact that I was exhausted, it inspired me to dance my
ass off. :) Also, the sound that night was much better than it had
been in the past. Even though it was still the Gateway system, the
bass was really tight and punchy. I understand some repairs where done
to the system, and the difference was really noticeable.

And the vibe was superb! Despite the fact that everyone in the city is
out of town for the holidays, they still managed to pack the dance
floor with good people and positive energy.

Also, I wanted to wish everyone a happy holiday season... I'm leaving
for San Diego in a few hours, and although I'll miss San Francisco,
it'll be nice to catch some sun for a few days. :)

I'll be passing through LA, as well, so if any of you Socal ravers
(and I know you're out there!) know of any good parties in either LA
or San Diego, give me a call: 415.215.8269 will reach me while I'm
traveling. I had heard rumours of a desert full moon party tonight...?

See you on New Year's! :) hmmm... Gateway or Cloud Factory...?

May Santa Bring You More Bandwidth:

>I'm hoping a friend of mine can help me tonight.  Don't you hate it when 
>all you want to do is print something with your new printer.  But 
>NOOOOOOOO!  It has to be an ordeal! :P


***###***Merry Christmas***###***

May Santa bring you the right driver.  What it sounds like is you aren't
seeing the modem/printer port selection icons in the right box.  If you
use System 7.5 then you probably have Open Transport which replaced the
old modem drivers.  You can tell your version OS by checking About This
Macintosh in the Apple Menu in Finder.  Look for Open Transport files in
your Extensions folder in System folder.

Apple didn't include the Open Transport/Localtalk toggle switch panel
with it's OS--it's in the Apple Internet Connection Kit, which is now
free with new machines.  If I could figure out attachments in Netscape
I'd EM it but I haven't had time to play with it let alone read a manual
<I guess AOL was good for something  :P'''> so I'll have to fire up some
other Email app.

This may be part of your bug... I had this problem when I upgraded my OS
from 7.5.2 

Your answer could probably be found in the Apple Technical Reference
Library which can be found from their home page.  There's a search
engine there but you should also find Apples ftp site to get the right
drivers, Open Transport, and the latest OS (7.5.5) Which is supposed to
have better compatibility with older cpu's

If there is some conflict between the printer driver version and the
modem driver (Open Transport/Apple Modem Tool/third party drivers) this
will hang the Chooser selector windows.

I'd still run a power up (usually hold some switch) print test of the
printer also.

My favorite Macintosh exorcism (besides turning off all extensions, PRAM
zap) is drag everything out of the System file you don't need and add
back a few at a time--start with the most basic stuff.  But you really
need to do that Clean Install--all the Mac Mojos agree on that one.

I installed everything by the book in my new machine and struggled for
days with Netscape and my new printer (Epson) which had it's own
drivers.  I like to think I'm fairly expert short of being a
programmer.  Lots of crashes and problems like yours.  Now with 7.5.5
and Netscape 3.0 (with ATT's ISP driver FreePPP, forget Apple's fancy
Internet Kit) it's fairly stable, but I still crash about once/day, and
superstitiously rebuild my desktop.

These Macs are like a Voodoo ritual I don't know how the average person
can handle it though the Performas are pre-configured with modems, etc.
ready to go.  Hey people these are the horror stories we were hearing
about Windoze 95!!!-

I've got an EZ135 for an alternate HD/backup and between both drives I
reinstalled everything about 5 times, even making several different
Startup Disks with their own system installs--it was like giving a
monkey a typerwriter and hoping to get a Shakespear.

Last ditch rituals:  Talk nicely to the computer, apologize for
screaming at it.

If that still doesn't work, and it's an old machine you are about to
replace, turn it off, whack the sides of the cpu a few times like the
Long Ranger on Trigger, pick up the front or back a few inches and drop
several times.  This ritual sometimes re-seats loose ribbon cables
(WARNING:  THE SURGEON GENERAL SAYS THIS PROCEDURE MAY BLOW YOUR HARD
DRIVE)

Actually, the point I was trying to make is that to be in the elite circle
of kool DJs, it is thought that yuo must have the special group approved
hardware.

I'm completely with you: DJs shouldn't be subsidized (except with NEA
grants, maybe :-> ) and the is a cost associated with creating any art.
Some art is just more expensive. But someone with talent shouldn't be put
off because they think they need to spend $2000

On the same hand, if someone has a huge collection of CDs, they shouldn't
think they need to run out and replace the whole collection with vinyl...
cuz all the cool DJs use vinyl. You can probably create more with a couple
of cheap CD players and a cheap ass mixer than you would think.

Hell, most of this music was born from the synths and drum machines that
were ditched in the early/mid 80s as the new generation of synths and drum
machines appeared. The TB-303 was a piece of shit as far as what it was
originally marketed for (a bass and drum section for rock guitarists!). But
creative people took it and did with it what the designers never considered.

I think that is what I was trying to say.

 This time of year puts many of us under stress. Those of us that have no 
one to hang with on Christmas day may particularly (sp?) be depressed (I 
know I am). So with that I would like to extend my love and warmth to 
those who for whatever reason don't have folks to hang with on Christmas 
day. Know that I wish we could be together.

 I am fortunate that there are people who have made me welcome on the New 
Year. I hope all of you will go somewhere and be with people of good 
cheer. I especially wish you all have a leafy and prosperous year ahead.


with love,


Ran D.Dreams

X-MAS FILES

Mulder:  We're too late! It's already been here.           

Scully:  Mulder, I hope you know what you're doing.           

Mulder:  Look, Scully, just like the other homes: Douglas fir,
truncated, mounted, transformed into a shrine; halls decked with boughs
of holly; stockings hung by the chimney, with care.          

Scully:  You really think someone's been here?
    
Mulder:  Someone, or something.          

Sculley:  Mulder, over here-it's a fruitcake.

Mulder:   Don't touch it!  Those things can be lethal.           

Sculley:  It's O.K.   There's a note attached: "Gonna find out who's
naughty and nice."
  
Mulder:  It's judging them, Scully.  It's making a list.           

Sculley:  Who?  What are you talking about?           

Mulder:  Ancient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could
travel at great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants.  Once
each year, near the winter solstice, this creature is said to descend
from the heavens to reward its followers and punish disbelievers with
jagged chunks of antracite.          

Sculley:  But that's legend, Mulder-a story told by parents to frighten
children.  Surely you don't believe it?          

Mulder:  Something was here tonight, Scully.  Check out the bite marks
on this gingerbread man.  Whatever tore through this plate of cookies
was massive-and in a hurry.  It left crumbs everywhere.  

Sculley:  And look, Mulder, this milk glass has been completely
drained.
          
Mulder:  It gorged itself, Scully.  It fed without remorse.

Sculley:  But why would they leave it milk and cookies?           

Mulder:  Appeasement.

Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.         

Sculley:  But if this thing does exist, how did it get in?  The doors
and windows were locked.  There's no sign of forced entry.          

Mulder:  Unless I miss my guess, it came through the
fireplace.           

Sculley:  Wait a minute, Mulder.  If you're saying some huge creature
landed on the roof and came down this chimney, you're crazy.  The flue
is barely six inches wide.  Nothing could get down there.          

Mulder:  But what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions at
once?          

Sculley:  You mean, like a bowl full of jelly?           

Mulder:  Exactly.  Scully, I've never told anyone this, but when I was a
child my home was visited.  I saw the creature.  It had long white
shanks of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshapen head.  It's bloated torso
was red and white.  I'll never forget the horror. 

I turned away, and when I looked back it had somehow taken on the facial
features of my father.          

Sculley:  Impossible.          

Mulder:  I know what I saw.  And that night it read my mind.  It brought
me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully.  It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato
Head!          

Sculley:  I'm sorry, Mulder, but you're asking me to disregard the laws
of physics.  You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars
across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen
to what you're saying.  Do
you understand the repercussions? If this gets out, they'll close the
X-files.          

Mulder:  Scully, listen to me: It know when you're sleeping.
It knows when you're awake.          

Sculley:  But we have no proof.          

Mulder:  Last year, on this exact date, SETI radio telescopes detected
bogeys in the airspace over twenty-seven states.  The White House
ordered a Condition
Red.         

Sculley:  But that was a meteor shower.          

Mulder:  Officially.  Two days ago, eight prized Scandinavian reindeer
vanished from the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C.  Nobody-not even the
zookeeper-was told aboutit.  The government doesn't want people to know
about Project Kringle.

They fear that if this thing is proved to exist the public will stop
spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy.  Retail
markets will collapse.  

Scully, they cannot let the world believe this creature lives.  There's
too much at stake.  They'll do whatever it takes to insure another
silent night.         

Sculley:  Mulder, I-         

Mulder:  Sh-h-h. Do you hear what I hear?           On the roof.  It
sounds like...a
clatter.          The truth is up there.  Let's see what's the matter.

Hey all,

Had a great time at MAD last night.  I haven't been there since the 
spring (when it used to rock!) and I was happy to see that it's rocking 
just as hard (if not harder) than ever.  The place was packed full of 
happy dancers, and since I was brave and ventured over there alone, I was 
really pleased to see so many friendly familiar faces.  Three bux to hear 
the likes of Ethan and Joe has to be the best deal going in the City :).  
Saw two memorable things on the way home: a gorgeous full moon encircled 
by a huge ring of clouds, and, just off the freeway in Emeryville, rising 
above everything in the blackness, a huge, neon, glaring "E".  I had to 
laugh out loud at that! :) 

Happy Christmas Eve to all of you who celebrate it... I personally have 
been feeling a great sense of rebirth since the night of the Solstice, 
the full moon seems to accentuate it...

Boozin' Ravers has gotten a great response so far... so keep an eye out 
in the near future for the first night of debauchery!

It has been suggested to me that, being that we are all ravers, that we 
may like to drink and then, oh, I don't know, DANCE - and apparently 
dance pickin's on Thursday nights are a little slim.  So, this may be a 
roving bar night, depending on what dance events are going on...

Probably our first night out will be on the second Wednesday of the new 
year, bars in lower Haight and then over to Wish for dancing the night 
away... Stay tuned for a post much nearer the date...

Love, Tunes and
Microbrews,
N :)

Speeches 

     1996 Annual Stockholders' Meeting
     Atlanta, GA
     April 30, 1996 

  "Because
  network
  computing is so
  all-embracing, it
  has emerged as
  IBM's integrating
  strategy. ANN
  JILLIAN'S HAIR
  makes LONI
  ANDERSON'S
  HAIR look like
  RICARDO
  MONTALBAN'S
  HAIR! It's the trail
  we're following -
  blazing - to get
  back on top." 
                      I hope you enjoyed the opening Olympic video. I want you to
                      know, my heart was pounding as I watched it. So this is what it
                      feels like to be potato salad And not because I get choked up
                      over grand athletic spectacles. 

                      No, on my way over here this morning I saw a big sign hanging
                      over Interstate 75. In giant letters, it said 80 days to go.
                      Excuse me, but didn't I tell you there's NO HOPE for the
                      survival of OFFSET PRINTING? That's 80 days to show time
                      -- both for your great city and for IBM. 

                      Two and one half million people are coming to dinner, and half
                      the world's population will be watching. We both have a lot on
                      the line. I am deeply CONCERNED and I want something
                      GOOD for BREAKFAST! It's a chance for your city and our
                      company to show their very best on a world stage. I don't need
                      to tell you there's an element of risk in stepping onto that
                      stage. But it's also an opportunity to demonstrate leadership.
                      My mind is making ashtrays in Dayton.... 

                      Last year, when I met with shareholders in Charlotte, I spoke
                      at length about leadership. I said that fully re-establishing
                      IBM's leadership in our industry was our goal, that we would
                      settle for nothing less. 

                      At that time, I felt we were turning a corner, that we were back
                      on our feet, building momentum, and that we had finally put to
                      rest questions about IBM's survival. I want to read my new
                      poem about pork brains and outer space... I said that the
                      important question for IBM -- looking ahead to 1995 -- was:
                      Could IBM grow again? 

                      As I wrote to you in our 1995 Annual Report several months
                      ago, I believe we have answered that question. You know the
                      facts of our 1995 performance. 

                      We exceeded $70 billion in revenue -- a record. MY income is
                      ALL disposable! We achieved double-digit growth -- our best
                      in a decade. Earnings doubled. Our workforce grew for the first
                      time in a number of years. The Osmonds! You are all
                      Osmonds!! Throwing up on a freeway at dawn!!! Perhaps of
                      most interest to you, our stock price increased 24 percent in
                      1995. It has increased another 18 percent so far in 1996. And
                      two weeks ago, the board of directors authorized a 40 percent
                      increase in our dividend. Can I have an IMPULSE ITEM
                      instead? 

                      So by virtually every measure, IBM is growing again. 

                      Which is not to say we are comfortable. Our first-quarter
                      results reminded us that competitive pressure remains very
                      intense in the industry and that we will see periodic lulls in
                      certain product lines as we go through product transitions.
                      Make me look like LINDA RONSTADT again!! 

                      I like to be the first to share news with IBM employees so I
                      often send them electronic notes. On the day we announced
                      our first-quarter earnings, I told them that the results were
                      good -- but mixed. As such, they represented a healthy
                      reality check for all of us. If our behavior is strict, we do not
                      need fun! But I also said we shouldn't be distracted by
                      quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. 

                      It's important that we not take our eye off our long-term
                      strategic vision. Not now. FUN is never having to say you're
                      SUSHI!! Not at the very time when our industry is entering its
                      next major phase -- the era of global networks. 

                      IBM has an opportunity to lead this shift to network computing
                      and to bring the value of a universally-connected world to
                      customers. 

                      The shift to network computing is very profound. Those aren't
                      WINOS--that's my JUGGLER, my AERIALIST, my SWORD
                      SWALLOWER, and my LATEX NOVELTY SUPPLIER!! I truly
                      believe it will reshape the world as fundamentally as the
                      invention of the printing press, the light bulb or manned flight. It
                      will reshape every business and institution in the world. It will
                      affect -- it's already affecting -- each and every one of us. All
                      this time I've been VIEWING a RUSSIAN MIDGET
                      SODOMIZE a HOUSECAT! 

                      What is causing this shift? There are many factors. 

                      One is universal connectivity, driven primarily by the
                      phenomenon of the Internet. The power of information
                      technology is moving out to touch hundreds of millions,
                      perhaps a billion people by the year 2000: 

                          Connecting businesses with customers in ways never
                          before possible 
                          Connecting people with people 
                          And connecting people with information of all kinds.
                          Yow! Now we can become alcoholics! 

                      Another driver is technology. Digital networks are being
                      transformed. They're gaining the speed and power to transmit
                      not just text and voice, but video, movies and high-resolution
                      images such as works of art, X-rays and MRI scans. He
                      probably just wants to take over my CELLS and then
                      EXPLODE inside me like a BARREL of runny CHOPPED
                      LIVER! Or maybe he'd like to PSYCHOLOGICALLY
                      TERRORIZE ME until I have no objection to a RIGHT-WING
                      MILITARY TAKEOVER of my apartment!! I guess I should
                      call AL PACINO! 

                      But the most important driver of the shift to network computing
                      isn't technology. The main driver of this shift is grounded in the
                      priorities of our customers all over the globe. Nearly all of them
                      are focused on increased speed to market, faster product
                      development, providing better customer service, reducing
                      cost, opening new markets. Yow! Maybe I should have asked
                      for my Neutron Bomb in PAISLEY-- 

                      Networks are powerful tools to achieve these objectives. They
                      give people easy access to information and to each other.
                      They lower -- and in some cases can eliminate -- the
                      borders between departments, companies, cultures and
                      nations. The appreciation of the average visual graphisticator
                      alone is worth the whole suaveness and decadence which
                      abounds!! They help people work as teams -- sharing ideas,
                      information and projects. 

                      How will this networked world change our lives? 

                      Our notion of libraries will be up-ended when people can
                      access the content found in books via the Internet
                      24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, directly from their homes
                      and schools. 

                      Medicine: "Telemedicine" will allow your physician here in
                      Atlanta to consult via the network with a specialist in
                      Massachusetts or Tokyo, and they can simultaneously view
                      the same X-rays and CAT-scans. Go on, EMOTE! I was
                      RAISED on thought balloons!! 

                      Education: "Distance learning" makes the same quality
                      education that is available in affluent suburban schools
                      available to the forgotten enclaves of inner cities. Our children
                      can learn French from a teacher in France, write essays about
                      China after taking a virtual tour of China, and explore space
                      courtesy of NASA. 

                      And, of course, network computing is changing commerce.
                      Wait.. is this a FUN THING or the END of LIFE in Petticoat
                      Junction?? It allows employees within companies to work
                      faster and smarter. It allows companies to interconnect with
                      their suppliers, their distributors, retailers and, of course, their
                      ultimate customers. 

                      It's already happening. He is the MELBA-BEING... the
                      ANGEL CAKE... XEROX him... XEROX him -- Everywhere
                      you turn these days you see Internet addresses -- those
                      "WWW.com" lines in ads and plastered on billboards all over
                      our country. 

                      In short, the network increasingly is becoming the place where
                      transactions occur, where communication takes place, where
                      business is conducted, where students are taught, where
                      citizens are served by their governments. Is something
                      VIOLENT going to happen to a GARBAGE CAN? 

                      As this happens, we will see tremendous demand for two
                      things IBM is very good at. First, technology. 

                      Networks by their very nature are complex. I'm having an
                      EMOTIONAL OUTBURST!! But, uh, WHY is there a WAFFLE
                      in my PAJAMA POCKET?? They require big processors,
                      enormous amounts of storage capacity, huge databases,
                      powerful transaction processing software and comprehensive
                      systems management. As transactions across networks
                      increase, so will demand for all of these IBM products. 

                      As you know, most people never see the bulk of IBM's
                      products because they labor quietly behind the scenes of
                      banks, insurance companies, airlines, universities and
                      corporations. Life is a POPULARITY CONTEST! I'm
                      REFRESHINGLY CANDID!! Yet network computing is driving
                      the focus of our industry in exactly that direction. Computing is
                      moving to the network, behind the scenes. Industrial-strength,
                      large-scale, reliable computing -- that's where the action is
                      again. I KAISER ROLL?! What good is a Kaiser Roll without a
                      little COLE SLAW on the SIDE? That hasn't been true for
                      many years. 

                      We are rapidly adapting all our products for network computing.
                      And we are developing new technologies necessary to make
                      the networked world real and easy to use. Eisenhower!! Your
                      mimeograph machine upsets my stomach!! In fact, we're
                      announcing several new products today at a big industry show
                      called Internet World in San Jose. 

                          Products like InfoSage, an online news and information
                          delivery service 
                          Cryptolopes, which I think of as secure electronic
                          envelopes that people can use to distribute
                          copyright-protected information. One of the more
                          important issues people are concerned with as
                          networks become more and more ubiquitous is how you
                          protect information and copyrights. .. Like I always say
                          -- nothing can beat the BRATWURST here in
                          DUSSELDORF!! 
                          We are also announcing our Internet Connection (IC)
                          Phone, which allows people to use the Internet as a
                          telephone system. 
                          And our flagship electronic commerce product called
                          the Net.Commerce system. I am NOT a nut.... 

                      The Net.Commerce system for the last several weeks has
                      been the Olympic Ticket Server here in Atlanta. Open
                      24-hours-a-day, it's the largest electronic commerce site on
                      the Internet. I hope I bought the right relish... zzzzzzzzz... So
                      far, it has sold about 32,000 tickets -- 14 percent of all
                      Olympics tickets sold. We're now making this product
                      available to other customers who want to establish online
                      stores. 

                      We're also strengthening our product portfolio through
                      selective acquisitions. .. So, if we convert SUPPLY-SIDE
                      SOYBEAN FUTURES into HIGH-YIELD T-BILL
                      INDICATORS, the PRE-INFLATIONARY risks will
                      DWINDLE to a rate of 2 SHOPPING SPREES per
                      EGGPLANT!! Earlier this year we completed our merger with
                      Tivoli Systems, which strengthens our hand significantly in
                      systems management, and, as you know, we acquired Lotus
                      last year. 

                      With Lotus, we offer a full range of application products and the
                      industry's leading groupware product, Notes. I'm pleased to
                      report to you that the merger has gone very smoothly. Did I
                      say I was a sardine? Or a bus??? Demand for all Lotus
                      products, especially Notes, is very strong. The potential for
                      Notes in a networked world is tremendous. Today's workers
                      want to do many tasks from their computers: send and receive
                      mail, update their calendars, share information with co-
                      workers, use tools like spreadsheets, get information from the
                      Internet and post information to the Internet. I can't decide
                      which WRONG TURN to make first!! I wonder if BOB
                      GUCCIONE has these problems! 

                      Notes is the only product in the marketplace that can do all
                      this. That's why customer demand is so high and why
                      thousands of software developers are writing network-centric
                      applications that exploit the power of Notes. 

                      The second opportunity that we see in this new emerging world
                      is in developing network solutions for customers. NEWARK
                      has been REZONED!! DES MOINES has been REZONED!!
                      The first opportunity was technology and products. The
                      second is solutions. 

                      Here again, I believe IBM has a home court advantage. Hello?
                      Enema Bondage? I'm calling because I want to be happy, I
                      guess.. We have tremendous relationships with customers.
                      Over the years, they have built their businesses on IBM
                      systems. Most of the world's business information resides in
                      IBM databases. Look! A ladder! Maybe it leads to heaven, or a
                      sandwich! Most of the world's transactions are executed by
                      IBM software and hardware systems. 

                      We're working with customers across the globe to help them
                      extend their reach, their brands and their very valuable
                      business information through these new networks. That's one
                      of the reasons why our services business is growing so rapidly
                      and has become our second largest source of revenue.
                      GOOD-NIGHT, everybody.. Now I have to go administer
                      FIRST-AID to my pet LEISURE SUIT!! 

                      I should also note that network computing is changing the way
                      customers buy IBM products and services. More and more of
                      them are "subscribing" to applications and services that we
                      make available via networks, such as our own IBM Global
                      Network. This makes it less expensive for them and has the
                      added benefit of creating a recurring revenue stream for IBM.
                      Now, let's SEND OUT for QUICHE!! 

                      Beyond product and solutions leadership, there's another area
                      where we want to provide leadership in the networked world.
                      The proliferation of networks raises a number of societal issues
                      in the minds of many people. They're concerned about privacy,
                      censorship and universal access, and whether we're creating
                      a world of technology have's and have not's. Hmmm.. A
                      hash-singer and a cross-eyed guy were SLEEPING on a
                      deserted island, when... 

                      These are very legitimate concerns. As a leader, IBM must --
                      and is -- addressing them. We're working with partners and
                      competitors, customers and governments around the world to
                      find acceptable solutions. Where's SANDY DUNCAN? The
                      promise is too great, and the benefits too immense, for any
                      responsible company to do otherwise. 

                      A lot of companies talk about leadership. They talk about
                      visions. PEGGY FLEMING is stealing BASKET BALLS to feed
                      the babies in VERMONT. They run clever ads. But few
                      companies make the future they talk about real. I think they
                      can learn a few things from Atlanta. The appreciation of the
                      average visual graphisticator alone is worth the whole
                      suaveness and decadence which abounds!! You weren't
                      asked to be the host city for the Centennial Games. You didn't
                      accept the challenge on a dare. You went out and competed for
                      the right to host the Games. I'm ANN LANDERS!! I can
                      SHOPLIFT!! Your community has worked hard -- very hard
                      -- for years to prepare. And in 80 days Atlanta will enjoy
                      perhaps the proudest moment in its proud history. 

                      IBM is honored to be a partner in this. Today, THREE WINOS
                      from DETROIT sold me a framed photo of TAB HUNTER
                      before his MAKEOVER! It's one of the greatest information
                      technology challenges we've ever faced -- the equivalent of
                      staging two Super Bowls every day for 17 days. 

                      The solution we've created relies on virtually every product in
                      our portfolio, as well as hundreds of our smartest people to
                      develop customized solutions and integrate all the pieces from
                      IBM and other technology sponsors of the Games in Atlanta.
                      It's a big, complex, demanding job with no margin for error. I'm
                      dressing up in an ill-fitting IVY-LEAGUE SUIT!! Too late... It's
                      a very good example of the kinds of integrated solutions we
                      pull together every day for customers around the world. 

                      For a company of IBM's size and breadth, it's hard to define a
                      single strategy that embraces all our products, services and
                      people. Yet, because network computing is so all-embracing,
                      it has emerged as IBM's integrating strategy. I want to kill
                      everyone here with a cute colorful Hydrogen Bomb!! It's the
                      trail we're following -- blazing -- to get back on top. Now
                      comes the hard part -- implementing. I will tell you that the
                      people of IBM are up to the challenge. This TOPS OFF my
                      partygoing experience! Someone I DON'T LIKE is talking to
                      me about a HEART-WARMING European film.. 

                      Three years ago, when I joined this company and addressed
                      shareholders for the first time in Tampa, IBM was on the
                      endangered species list. I talked about the hard actions
                      necessary to save our company. Two years ago, we talked
                      about stability. Let's all show human CONCERN for
                      REVEREND MOON's legal difficulties!! Last year: growth.
                      Now, we are gunning for leadership. 

                      As much as any single factor, IBM owes its current health and
                      its future potential to the dedication and hard work of IBM
                      employees. I want a VEGETARIAN BURRITO to go.. with
                      EXTRA MSG!! They took the decline of their company
                      personally, and they have given their all to bring IBM back. I'm
                      proud to call them my colleagues. 

                      Finally, I want to thank all of you -- our shareholders -- for
                      standing by us through the rough times. LBJ, LBJ, how many
                      JOKES did you tell today??! I hope you feel your patience has
                      been justified. The fires are out. The industry is shifting
                      dramatically and rapidly. Pardon me, but do you know what it
                      means to be TRULY ONE with your BOOTH! In many ways,
                      it's coming back our way. 

                      Network computing is exciting -- not only as an opportunity
                      for IBM to lead once again -- but because it will fundamentally
                      change the world for the better. 

                      There's plenty to do, and I assure you we won't let up until
                      we're done. Here we are in America... when do we collect
                      unemployment? 

                      Thank you.

Allright everyone here is the deal. I'm screwed. I need a room for rent ASAP.
Both of my roomates have bailed out on me so I'm alone.
I have one small/medium sized dog and one fat lazy cat. They do no damage. I
make decent money so I can pay for a nice room. I also need a Trance/Techno
friendly place since I spin, and spin often. If anyone can help I would greatly
appreciate it. Prefferably a place in the Mountain view, Sunnyvale, Campbell,
Los Gatos, Santa Clara, Or San Jose areas. But anywhere just about would work.

PEACE, James

Hi..  I'm looking for something lame to do in SF on New Year's eve.  I
don't want to go to a rave and I don't want to be around people who are
getting drunk.  Let me know if you've got some sedate plans or ideas, and
we'll chill together.

Does anyone know if Roots is happening tonight?  The Wicked crew seems to have
abandoned their voicemail number.  (could the reign be over?)  I don't really
wanna spend all of Christmas by myself, and Garth rocks hard...  I checked on
Wish, but their not doin' it.  If anyone knows something cool, let me know.
BTW, if anyone else is lonely for Christmas, I got a bottle of some good

feeling uncommonly festive.   I want to take this time to thank you all

you're the BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!!!

May you all have warm fuzzies for the holidays and a KICKIN new year!

 well, all i can say about the gathering 5 yr was that it was THE BOMB!!!
martin knows how to throw an awesome party. IMO, he's the only one who can
pull of a good massive at home base. 
     the music and the vibe at this year's party rivaled the 4 yr. i was in
the house room for a good part of the night. i never managed to make it into
the techno room, because the foot stomping beats in the main room kept me
planted.
     jeno and josh tore it up. jeno set the music up just right for josh who
peaked the party. i'd never heard josh peak a party before, now i can't wait
until he does it again. tony was awesome as usual (does this guy ever spin a
bad set?), and onionz spun some incredible house. kevin saunderson was a
little disappointing, because he train wrecked like a mofo. his set was the
only problem i had the whole night. 
     it was good seeing old friends (imagine my surprise when at 4 in the
morning, austin popped up behind me after his 3 hour drive from SLO) and
making new ones. that's what the gathering is all about.

until next time,
dorena

Just thought I should introduce myself..

My name's Leonardo, and I have recently decided to fully devote myself to
music.  I even threw away an Olympic judo/wrestling career, and left MIT..
that's how much it means to me.  I loved the Boston scene, yet I'm even
more excited to get to experience everything I had never exposed myself
to in the Bay area.

Monday night I tried to go to MAD (though it was a couple hours' drive..
I live in the Santa Cruz area).  I was psyched.  Then I was in a car
accident.  Bad scene.. I'm still having flashbacks.. but at least I
wasn't hurt.  I was really drawn to the type of music there.. I would
love to get a ride with someone on a semi-regular basis, but I don't
suppose anyone this far South frequents there.

I'm also into African drumming.. I drummed with Arthur Hull (for those
of you who might know him) for two years when I was ten years old.. 
got myself a djembe a couple days ago and I'm dying to find some drum
circles with good vibes to help me get back in the groove.

I feel like I'm starting from scratch in more ways than one.. so if
you're into making/exploring/enjoying any of the beautiful aspects
of music, and would like to get in touch with me for whatever, please
give me a call (408-761-5797) or send an email my way.   =)

Peace,

Leonardo

Greetingz-
Forgive my ignorance, but does anyone know how I could pick up tickets for
the Cloud Factory NYE celebration *from L.A.*?   I'll be heading up to
Monterey with Uncle Noah, from the City of Angels (on the good ole'
Amtrash) the 31st, and I really, *really* don't want to get turned down @
the door because the place is too packed.  I remember a vicious rumour
going around that you had to order in advance; well, I suppose I'd like to
order in advance...
Any help would be appreciated; thanx so much!/\/\/\/

(Is there anybody out there?)


Hmm....

So many events are happening I don't know where to start!

>From Kool Wurld to that underground Goa thingie....  I heard that
crystalsis might have a lil partie, or will it be fun going off w/the
Cloud Factory in Monterey???  Did someone mention F'n'F?  And what about
Origin?  Spundae always has a stellar lineup, but then again, I wonder
if Harmony is up to anything this year?  Of course there are even a few
other smaller scale events that I've seen flyers for circulating around
the Haight too...

So what are YOU doing that night, dear raver?

Wherever I may be,  Hope to see you on NYD @ Wish... Methinks I'll be
there all day (and night)...

40+ HOURS OF RAVING!!!  (Can U handle it???)

Where is everybody at?

Who is going to Cool World?  No one on the list? Bummer.
You know though..  All this talk about "to commercialized". Anybody besides
me out there think that the words "to commercialized" is just as big a hipe
as a commercial?
 I mean. I wouldn't doubt it if most people say "to commercialized" just
becouse thats what everybody else says. Why care?
 Don't get me wrong. I love them little underground parties where everybody
seems like family. But I love them huge out of control "parties" aswell.
 Sometimes though.... My arm pits smell funny..  You know what I do about
it? I stick some Right Guard up in there...  But gee..  Lately I have been
thinking about just going to the ravEs smelling like B.O.  You know why?
Becouse Right Guard is just to damn commercialized for me...!!!! 
Hahhahaha.  =]:.::..
 I like the taste and buzz I get from Zima. Any Zima drinkers notice how
people kinna think your old fasion for drinking Zima "to commercialized"
Old fashion...  Hmmmm..  Budweiser has been around longer, and has more
commercials than Zima..  I think on the Zima note; people just think it is
uncool becouse they feel maybe like they were suckered into drinking it by
the hipe of the commercials? Hmmm..  I don't know. Do you?
  Reason for subject..  Becouse my friends are starting to say "to
commercialized" And when I say "What do you mean?" You know what they say?
"to commercialized" So I say "Snap out of it man! You sound like a
programmed robot!" There recovering now..

That auta get the list going alittle Huh?

Ya know,

Mr Stuff makes me laugh.   Not b-cuz he likes stirring things up.  But
moreso that, I get this mental picture of a plate of greenish-blue
hashbrown-like substance talking while someone is typing what it's
saying.   

Pretty hilarious really....

        Hi!

        This New Years eve I will be setting up some intelligent lighting
for the Gateway Systems' Metamorphosis event.  I would really like to have
a film/video/photo crew there capturing it.  It will require low-light
equipment, nomal cam-corders/quicktakes will not work.  I do have a small
budget to pay any costs.  email me if interested.

        thanks!

i think TOO commercialized might me a better way of putting it myself.  I only
advertise for stuff i think is THE SHIT, and that's all i generally buy.  so,
if you notice me wearing Doc Martins or Hi-Tek boots, that's because I
bought them, because I think they're good.  The same reason I wear my
Metallica concert shirt from 1987!! (still)  But I remember in High School,
the peer pressure to wear OP shirts (ocean pacific) was pretty great, and
they weren't particularly good, but you just weren't cool if you didn't have
acouple pairs.
To me, anyone who aftertises (in their personal life at least) for stuff
that they don't like, or that they know is bad for the environment (etc..)
is basically a prostitute.  MarredBurrow or Camel could give me 1000 of
their fucking hats, jadckets and shirts, and i wouldn't even give them to
the homeless, let alone wear them, because those companies are basicaly evil
in my opinion.

well there's my 2c worth.

 Someone reacted to a portion of one of my posts:

 S'OK, and I recognize your point. I made a deliberate choice between the 
two words. IT was a bit of a troll...I'm glad that nobody on SFRaves wrote 
me any email saying that they AGREE with gay bashing. 

 The whole sociological history of "fag","queer", and "gay" has deep
, subtle subconciouss stuff. Sometimes, when a group tries to achieve some
respect by asking the general public to use a less loaded label to 
denote their group, they forget that the general public hates THEM, not the
old label. I think recognition of this is why "Queer Nation" chose that
name for themselves. 

 The anti-gay forces in this country have no trouble inciting fear and
loathing by spreading hysterical lies about the "gay agenda" without
using the words "fag" or "queer".   

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - I was taking some film animation courses at De Anza College about ten
years ago. During one of the lab sessions , I overheard two high-school 
age boys talking about something strange, unusual, and unpleaseant that 
someone had done. One of the phrases they used was "that's so gay" (!)
I don't know if "gay" is still being used to describe unusal, unpleasant
behaviour these days, or whether it was a passing bit of slanguage.

[alchohol could also be called a date rape drug. but i digress... -R]

BCN31:ROHYPNOL, THE DATE RAPE DRUG, WILL BE ILLEGAL UNDER NEW LAW

BCN31 -ROHYPNOL

By Bay City News Service

Rohypnol, the "date rape drug," will be illegal under California

law as of New Year's Day.

The new law, SB 2164, is authored by State Senator Tom Hayden.

The U.S. Commissioner of Customes, George Weise, has called the

drug "another nightmare for parents."

Although the drug is illegal under federal law, it has been cheap

and easily available with a street price of $5 a pill. This because

federal drug agents been more concerned with tracking major drug

rings, Hayden explained. Since local police do not enforce federal

law, they have lacked legal authority until the Hayden Act to arrest

sellers and users of the drug.

The small white pills are sometimes called "roopies," and they

usually are slipped into a woman's or girl's drink. The victim then

becomes unconscious within 30 minutes, may sleep for eight hours and

generally can't remember anything that happens to her once the drug

becomes effective.

Police departments report many victims have awakened to find

themselves nude in a strange man's bedroom. Hayden's office said Los

Angeles police have complained that up until now when they found a man

cruising the bars with a pocket full of the pills all they could do

was confiscate them.

It is manufactured by Hoffman-La Roche, an international

pharmaceutical company. Although it has been banned in the United

State as having no beneficial medical use, the drug is legal in 64

countries. This includes Mexico and Columbia, where it is being

manufactured.

Hope everyone is enjoying the holidays, and having a little fun :).  There's
a few things going on this weekend, but people are probably gearing up
for New Year's Eve.  I'll try to send out a bonus calendar on Monday with
the New Year's Eve preview, plus the regular one next Thursday.

I only have one one-off per day listed for this weekend, so it should 
be easier to decide where to go :)  ...although there are still a 
lot of great weeklies too...

What a ball I had there!  I went early, because I wanted to see Ethan and
Joe Rice, and I love seeing a party come to life, and I hate lines, and
Boomerang said he'd go early too ...

And from the first second, the vibe was there, I felt like  I was at a
humongous FnF or something -- only there were friends from all parts of my
life!  My very closest friends were there, plus I saw hundreds of my other
friends and acquaintances -- some are people I only  see in clubs, some are
people who never go out, or people who go out five times a week, people who
are 14, people who are older than me (ok, just kidding!), people who love
trance, people who love house (yay Onionz!), promoters, kids who were at
their first party, "gangstas" and "teddy-bear-backpackers," SFRavers who
never post, and SFRavers who won't be quiet, it was so incredible.

I just walked around from 10 at night until 8:00 a.m. with a huge smile on
my face, soaking it all in ....  the best moment was at 7:30 a.m. and
Onionz was in this grooovy groove and the remaining few hundred of us were
just dancing like we weren't even tired.

Thanks for the great conversatins, the hugs, the kisses (mmmm), for the
wonderful time, to every single person who was there, and to everyone who
made such a big party feel like a little one.

Leslie

Dear SFRavefriends,

	I'll jump back into the continuing discussion about commercialism
with some interesting info that was forwarded to me. I'm sure I'm not the
only one who didn't know about this law.  I haven't attempted to verify
that this is for real, but it sounds clumsy and heavy-handed enough to be
legit.
	I think it was someone on SFRaves I was talking with some time
back about the merits of cops and drug laws when I mentioned that even
those who consider themselves law-abiding citizens, and believe that those
OTHER people who break laws deserve whatever the cops and the justice
system have in store for them, are actually law-breakers too.
	There are so many laws passed each year, many of them incredibly
complex, that it becomes impossible to know the law.  This makes it easy
for the authorities to find a pretext to nail just about whoever they
want to.  If the law is on your side, that doesn't necessarily spare you.
	A San Francisco judge recently handed down an injunction against a
law mandating that the government not discriminate against people on the
basis of race or sex, essentially on the grounds that the law was
discrimnatory on the basis of race and sex.  In such an Orwellian climate,
where words can be twisted to take exactly their opposite meaning,
consider what could be done with the following:

___________________________________________________________________________
"By US Code Title 47, Sec.227(a)(2)(B),a computer/modem/printer meets the
definition of a telephone fax machine.  By Sec.227(b)(1)(C), it is unlawful
to send any unsolicited advertisement to such equipment.  By Sec.227(b)(3)(C),
a violation of the aforementioned Section is punishable by action to recover
actual monetary loss, or $500, whichever is greater, for each violation."
___________________________________________________________________________

	Say for example that you are the promoter of an underground party
that hasn't paid thousands of dollars to off-duty cops to provide your
security.  Let's say that you get busted, as many such parties do, and
some new police chief decides to make an example of you.  He finds out
that a week before your party, you sent a BSP post to SFRaves advertising
your event, as many promoters have been doing.
	So he forwards the info to the FBI (since this law is apparantly a
federal one), and they initiate action against you to claim the amount of
$200,000.  What!?! you exclaim.  Well, your post went out to the
computer/modem setup of each subscriber to SFRaves (I'm conservatively
guessing 400 subscribers) and the law provides for a $500 fine for EACH
violation.  $500 x 400 = $200,000.
	Now I know the wording of the law appears to indicate that you
would have to send an advertisement by modem to a computer with a printer
hooked up that automatically prints out incoming messages without any
filtering process on the other end, so as to resemble the action of a fax 
machine. But can you be sure the courts would interpret it that way?
	Under civil asset forfeiture laws currently in effect, police and
government agencies can seize your car, home, bank account, what have you,
and the burden of proof is on you if you want your property back to prove
that your property was not used in the commission of a crime.  (FYI, Dan
Lungren, he of medical marijuana infamy, has been a key supporter of these
laws in California).  How would you like to have everything you own seized
(unless you have over $200,000 in assets) while you try to prove that each
person on SFRaves who received your email either did not regard it as
unsolicited or did not automatically print it out?
	One bright note in all this is that it could put the fear of God
into companies trying to peddle their wares over the Net via unsolicited
email.  As pleasant as that prospect may be, let's not forget that the
bigger fight for freedom on the Internet is still being fought, and the
way we'll lose it is by going along with government attempts to censor
unpopular members of the cyber-community like advertisers and
child-pornographers.  I'm sure everyone's heard Martin Neimuller's famous
lines about how "First they came for the Jews..."

Seeing as people subscribed to a mailing list, receiving mail from that
list would not fall under the definiton of unsolicited. 

It hasn't happened here yet, but several other lists I am on have been
spammed repeatedly, which decreases the usefulness of the list for all
involved. The law has been brought up by those who continually receive
unsolicited (almost always commercial) via email or Usenet. Personally, I
am happy it exists, and hope some of the sleaze-merchants who routinely
forge addresses and dupe unwitting folks into giving them money for a list
of "prospective clients" get burnt hard.

People have a right to free speech yes. However that right does not extend
into *my* mailbox.

 I know that a post asking about Technics SL-1200MK2 turntables arrives
on SFRaves every month or so, so here's something I saw in today's
( Fri., Dec. 27th ) San Jose Mercury. Fry's Electronics is selling
them for $499.99. With 7.75% Santa Clara County sales tax, that would
be $538.74 . Price is advertised to be good until Dec. 31st.

 For you shoppers out there.

I saw a poster on Telegraph this morning, a sketch of a man wanted "for 
the murder of David Nadel."  This must mean that David has lost his fight 
for life...

This tragedy reminds me that there are many people who did not survive 
this year, or had terrible things befall them (Omar).  All of us should 
be very thankful for our health, for our good fortune to be able to sit 
at a computer and bullshit with 500 friends, for dancing and celebrating 
life all night long.  Life is so precious and can be taken or altered in 
a second.  On Friday night, when David was enjoying live music at 
Ashkenaz, how could he know that night was his last?

As New Year's approaches, hopefully all of us can take a little extra 
care to make sure it's safe.  Remember, after midnight a hell of a lot of 
people on the road will be fucked up out of their minds.  Luckily, many 
of us will be at a rave, safely tucked away with friends until the 
morning light.  Whatever you do, be safe - drive safely, don't allow 
friends to drive drunk, and be moderate in your drug use.  Please.

Much love to all of you.  See you at Gateway/Pacific... and in the new year!!

Love,
Nancy

Circuit City is always selling 1200's for $479.97, but they have to
special order them; takes about a week.

There's a fine line between wearing something that has a small logo on
it somewhere and wearing advertising.  I think the line is crossed when
the main selling point of the item is the fact that it has a logo on it
-- logo T-shirts, jackets, hats, etc. only exist to carry the logo
around, and you can buy identical products that don't have logos.

Ditto the "blue-jeans-of-the-year" phenomenon in high school...one year
it was Gasoline, then Guess?, then Pepe, then the (then) new baggy
Levis, then something else, all identical except for the logo on the
butt.  The only reason to have one over the other was that it advertised
your coolness.

As a rule, I don't advertise for anyone.  They should pay _me_ to wear a
shirt with a big logo on it...

However, I own some things that have visible logos.  My Chuck Taylors,
for example, have the standard small, round logo on the inside of the
ankle.  My rain/snow jacket has "Moonstone" on the chest.  The important
difference between these and, say, a Red Wolf t-shirt is that the
products have some merit beyond being a logo carrier: Chucks are about
the cheapest shoes you can buy that don't fall apart instantly, and
Moonstone is the only hardcore mountaineering outerwear manufacturer
that doesn't use overseas labor (North Face, Mountain Hardwear) or
prison labor (Patagonia).  If I could find something better without a
logo, I'd buy it, but I haven't.

I don't own any regular clothes with logos because it's so easy to find
ones that don't.

I would think the FBI would have better things to do than worry about a
bunch of kids breaking into a place with a bunch of stereo equipment and
the elaborate means of how they spread the word about it on the net.
Isn't the FBI supposed to go raid sweat shops? They have $200,000 I'll
bet.

Plus, I, for one, am not even using a modem right now. I'm on one of my
company's (many) T3's.

Let's say that you get busted, as many such parties do, and some new police chief decides to make an example of you.  He finds out that a week before your party, you sent a BSP post to SFRaves advertising your event, as many promoters have been doing.

Hi everyone - that was me (and lucky for AMancia, I'm fanatical about 
checking my email! :)

I am maintaining a list of people in Berkeley and the immediate area for 
ridesharing.  I have a bunch of people who need rides, and quite a few 
who have cars and can offer rides.  I sent out the name/phone list to all 
those who responded at the time (a month ago?).  I can't report on 
whether this ushered in a joyous new era of East Bay carpooling, but it's 
still a nice idea.

Contact me if you want to be on the list.

:)
Nancy

Except for, of course, the wonderful SFRaves logo shirts so graciously made
by Mike Magurski!  Just about the only thing I'll wear that has visible
words on it (I won't even wear a laminate, right, Terry?)  ...  oh, unless
it says SF Giants, ya know.  I guess they're both sort of my team loyalty
showing.

Sir:

It has come to our attention through our surveillance computers that you
may be harboring or trading logo merchandise.  Ignorance of the law is
no excuse I refer you to the Uniform Clothing Act of 2013 A.D. which
states in the interest of equality no world citizen may wear a logo
representing a corporation.

I remind you the purpose of this law is to prevent social class
frictions and while you may feel we should only prosecute the rich who
wear contraband Rolexes in principle you are just as guilty.

Please take the contraband items to your nearest Peace Station and you
may want to put your pets in the kennel as you will have to do some time
in Reprogramming.

Yes, yet another one of those "What is everyone doing on NYE?" posts. 
HOwever, I am thinking about hitting 1015 Folsom and checking the mad 
lineup they've got: Laurent Garnier, Jeno, etc. Was wondering if 
anyone was headed there and what they thought.

Dear Black Adder,

	I'm sure some people would argue that just because they subscribed
to a list doesn't mean that a lot of the messages they receive via that
list aren't unsolicited.  And it is possible to be placed on a list
without your knowledge or consent.  This happened to me a few weeks ago
after I left email on a web site. 
	However I'll accept your distinction between list-spam mail and
more purely unsolicisted spam mail as a valid one, and I agree that given
the ease of sending messages in cyberspace, some REASONABLE restriction on
truly unsolicited advertising mail is called for.
	What troubles me most is the vagueness of the law, vague laws
being the tools of despots.
	If it were rewritten with an exact meaning leaving no wriggle room
for cops, attorneys, politicians, and judges, AND if our justice system
were reformed so that cases are not prosecuted unless the victim(s) or
their relations (not the government!) seek prosecution, then I see no
problem.
	But when the government can potentially levy ruinous charges
against you for sending email that the recipient may have been
perfectly happy to receive, something is rotten in Denmark.
	
Whether 'tis nobler or not,   ;)

Dear Black Adder,

	I'm sure some people would argue that just because they subscribed
to a list doesn't mean that a lot of the messages they receive via that
list aren't unsolicited.  And it is possible to be placed on a list
without your knowledge or consent.  This happened to me a few weeks ago
after I left email on a web site. 
	However I'll accept your distinction between list-spam mail and
more purely unsolicisted spam mail as a valid one, and I agree that given
the ease of sending messages in cyberspace, some REASONABLE restriction on
truly unsolicited advertising mail is called for.
	What troubles me most is the vagueness of the law, vague laws
being the tools of despots.
	If it were rewritten with an exact meaning leaving no wriggle room
for cops, attorneys, politicians, and judges, AND if our justice system
were reformed so that cases are not prosecuted unless the victim(s) or
their relations (not the government!) seek prosecution, then I see no
problem.
	But when the government can potentially levy ruinous charges
against you for sending email that the recipient may have been
perfectly happy to receive, something is rotten in Denmark.
	
Whether 'tis nobler or not,   ;)

Just so people don't get the idea that everyone on SFR is a big ol' 
glasses tapin', pocket protector waerin' geek; I'm going to punch in here 
and say: I am a big ol' trendy ass, lable hor. Just this Monday I went to 
Mad wearing GAT shorts, A GAT T-shirt, and a GAT backpack full of 
Tootsiepops(tm). Yeah, I know the GAT backpack cost twice what it should 
have, and it's kind of a lousy backpack, but I don't care. I look good 
and that is what is important.

Labels rule. I just replaced the PLUS-8 slipmats on my TECHNICS 
turntables with RAMPANT slipmats. Not because there was anything wrong 
with the old slipmats; I just wanted to hype RAMPANT. Sometimes if I 
somehow end up with clothes that don't have a label (gasp) I iron on a 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY logo, so everyone will know how cool I am.

Of course for many of us, our aceptance of labels depends on how we feel 
about that particular lable. For example when I go to a rave I like to 
see: GAT, Clobber, Fresh Jive, Addidas, Technics, Airwalk, Childrens 
Television Workshop. I am; however, less than thrilled when I see: Nike, 
Grateful Dead, or Doc Martens. Please darlings It's gonna be the late 
'90s in just a couple of days. Isn't it about time to loose the '80s (and 
worse) fashions?

PS for snot value: I typed this message on an Apple copmuter while 
listening to a MAXELL tape in a SONY deck pushing a pair of HARMON KARDON 
speakers, now I'm gonna upload it using a GLOBAL VILLAGE modem.

Here are some more labels just for fun: Nikon, Honda(motor bikes), 
Yamaha(sound eguipment), Roland, Peets, Stanton, Spyderco, TDK, Agfa, 
Kodak, Mole Richardson, Kino Flo, Zo, Vanson, Red Wing.

i came to karma with the thought it wouldn't get broken up. that it 
didn't. :) I'm glad i decided to go, because the trance was hard and 
the mixes were out of my mind, always a step
ahead.. which i only usually experience
while dancing to jungle. :)  the times i WAS on the dancefloor.. 
hearing "commander tom" dropped at just the right time, thomas 
trouble's Johnny Cash record "take a drink of water leeeeerooyyy"... 
the music was PHAT, the chill room could have used some ambient, cuz 
the music upstairs was barely audible, but after awhile the constant 
sound of people talking and people playing with flutes and beepers 
made a music of it's own.. :)
	i can say it was WONDERFUL running into leslie and pablo 
there, and aryck and lay-cee, and many other great people
and having great conversations with all 
of them.. however, the vibe was weird.. i sensed negative tension 
from other people just walking down the stairs, but it was something 
to ignore i suppose.. and how EASILY ignorable it was, once engaged 
in a conversation about life.. or on the dancefloor (which was hot, 
but the sound system and the phat music made up for the sweat that 
was lost)...
	the night ended so quickly, and i was left with the thought 
to hit the next karma party up and bring more positive energy (AND 
candy) to share.. :) 
anyhow, i'm off to the snow and won't be able to share NYE with 
ya'all so happy new year's in advance and take care!!
Love,
LAra

	When I got to the map point & found out that this
party was in the Galactic Tunnel space I was fully prepared
for it to suck - but I was pleasantly surprised instead. There
does seem to be some kind of dark energy around that space,
but I thought that it was completely dispelled by the positive
energy of many of the people there. The acoustic problems of
the space haven't gone away, but it did sound better in there
this time. I particularly enjoyed Dutch's set at the end.
The air never got completely unbreathable, just the normal rave 
steambath with smoke. By the end of the nite the feeling on the
dance floor was just outstanding. 

	I didn't bring much to give away this time - some Gatorade
& a couple tapes. I did bring some musical toys to share, and people
seemed to enjoy them. 

	On the personal down side (I'm going to be charitable here) 
somebody appears to have mistakenly taken my backpack (purple, 
containing Gatorade, Arrowhead water, some clothing). Not a huge
loss, but there was a special jacket in it that was a gift. If 
anybody knows anything about it, please feel free to contact
me.

	It was nice to meet: Thomas, Lorin (again), Jeremy (again), and 
the woman with the Euro accent whose name I've forgotten (sorry :<).

	I'd do the whole thing again, backpack & all.

Hi, everyone!
I'm new to the list and I understand I'm supposed to wait two weeks 
before posting, but I (as usual) left it too late to follow all the 
rules. . . Sorry! :)
I haven't been to a party (rave) since the Friends and Family party in 
July (which was magical) and I have 5 or 6 months worth of smiling and 
dancing to release.  I thought New Years Eve would be a good time, but I 
don't know of any parties!  (Circumstances have kept me painfully away 
from the whole scene for a long time.)
If anyone has knowledge of any parties they feel comfortable sharing with 
me, I would be so grateful.  I'm looking for something maybe on the 
smaller side with a vibe that will make me grin my way well into the New 
Year. . !

Subject: KARMA Review (late!)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hi alls, just thought I should leave a review of KARMA,

I got there at around 12:30, the music could be heard all the
way from Market St. So I had no problem finding the place :)

The place was weird, but it looked really cool. You go in
and there are this stairs that go up, off to the right 
(after going up the first set of stairs) was the chill room...
as soon as I got there it was completely DARK. All you could
see was Nothing. but I noticed that there were people in there
and I didn't want to flash any light on people's faces ;) 
(talk about BAD trip) so I continued back up the stairs...

The Upstairs part I guess was the Dance room (duh)..it was
a long passage way, the DJ at the very end... it was reallly
really really HOT and WET, but there were alot of nice
people as well as some 'weird' viby people. There were some
really rude people who asked me for a cigarette and they didn't
even say Thanks...but I gave them one anyhow.

I went back downstairs and now the chill room was full of light.
there wasn't any music but people singing, playing musical instruments
and beepers and cell phones and such other artifacts. I found Lara
at the Chill out room :) and we hung out and such throughout the night...
she gave me a really cool bracelet and lots of good vibes. I was also
fortunate to meet her friends April, Paul and other people that I will
not attempt to remember their names 'cause guessing is bad! ;) 
(sorry guys! I remember your faces though!)

** The worst part of the night:
I was chatting and playing with toys with Lara and APril and the rest
when suddently this girl comes in and she's being lifted up by this
really tall weird vibe person and such... but then she keeps falling
and crawling on the floor, about to pass out. Looked like she mixed
Alcohol and GHB[?] but she was like passing out and didn't want anyone
to help her and stuff... it was a real bad trip for some people. This
girl though, was the same RUDE girl that bummed a Cigarrette off of me.
talk about KARMA!

There was also ALOT of alcohol going around... specially in the
stairway. Some people had a couple of 40s in paper bags and such and
were passing it around. there is nothing more obnoxsious [sp?] than
someone drunk. ugh...I can't stand it. but its a personal thing.
I just don't think people should DRINK at raves...other than Water and 
Fruit juices...
 
** The Best Part of the night:
Hanging out with Lara and Hope and April and Paul and all their friends.
It was really really cool to share my toys and candy with people. I 
specially enjoyed signing their books and such (even though I never have
much to say cause my mind totally goes blind!) but I had a great time :)

The other best part of the night was the fact I was SOBER... (yay for me)
I was able to feel vibes and be happy without the need for drugs :) I
met this really cool girl that kept talking about Thailand and the parties
there. Its sooooooooo cool to talk to people specially when they totally
open up and just start talking and talking and talking!! :) its so rad to
hear peoples stories and such. She had greeat stories and we also were
talking about Hindu gods and such (it was started by the ALL TOGETHER NOW flyer)
and I showed her my Ganesha necklace and stuff it was really cool :) I also
met her friend who had a French accent...really *nice*. he didn't say much
unfortunately, but he was *nice* :P~

Anyhow...
Thats about it, I left the party around 4:30 or so... (I know, I basically
missed
Dutch's set.) but I had to get home... I was exhausted! ;)

'Till next time!
Love
Pab

Tootsiepops will never go out of style.  And they give them away for

Someday I will switch back to my Wonka (tm) slipmats when they come back
into style.  I will keep my R&S slipmats on until then.

Since Adidas and the ripoffs are emulating late 70's early 80's fashion,
does that mean that Doc Martens will be the retro rage of 2001?

OK so this is a parody of my parody--

I guess the real question about trendy materialistic types (if that's
what they really are--which is kind of a catch all when somebody might
have been given the item...etc.--vs. so-called non-materialists (which
is an oxymoron--since their cars, tv's, stereos, all have labels (thus
they are inadvertently advertising also) is:

don't your shit stink too?

Or are you (in your mind) somehow better as a person?

Just by living in a city and using computers, etc, you are participating
in the western materialistic rat race.

So if you go to a party in Birkenstocks (excuse me--generic third party
sandals), your second hand clothes, and you ride the bus instead of
driving, does that mean you will reach heaven (or Nirvana, etc.) before
me?

It's ironic because the Hip Hop trend of wearing garish logos came out
of ghetto culture--people with almost no wealth trying to create an
image--as they have to live day to day watching white people enjoy their
ill-gotten wealth on TV, media, etc. (i.e. 300 years of imperialism,
slavery, land grabs from natives and Mexico, etc.)

So now that the "cream" of American cracker culture has enjoyed
unprecedented wealth and security its easy to "drop out" and feel
somehow "superior" because you dabble in psuedo-Buddhist/Hindu
non-materialism.

It's ironic that the descendants of people who thought that Africans and
Native Americans were "animals" not worthy of human rights now make a
fad of trying to look and act like native people from those cultures
i.e. dreadlocks, native jewelry, dance styles, etc. and for an example
drop in on an African dance class in any trendy urban area and you will
find it full of Huppys (Hippy Yuppies) half of which are pursuing their
"alternative" non-materialistic lifestyle thanks to a subsidy from their
fat capitalistic parents , a trust fund, or welfare.

Some people feel superior because they wear cheap T shirts and generic
jeans or wear a Hippy uniform.  I guess they can feel good about
themselves because they can dog out the people that derive enjoyment
from name brands or that pursue a flamboyant lifestyle because they rose
out of poverty and the logic of wearing rags doesn't dawn on them.

Perhaps even more ironic is that most of the current trends in the dance
scene all came from ghetto culture 10 or 20 years ago--and as usual
white people are mimicking the descendants of our former slaves--witness
the explosion of white Blues artists doing 40-50 y/o styles.

The original Hippys and Beatnicks pursued a lifestyle that was
outrageous to the conservatives fresh out of "Elvis" style rock & roll. 
Having long hair and freaky clothes was a challenge because schools made
you cut it and bullies would mock you.  Hippys rebelled against the
status quo of their time.

Now that the Alternative lifestyle is the status quo it's just as fun to
dress GQ or Hip Hop and get the same flack from the Alternatives who are
just as narrow-minded and conservative in their "hipness" and have as
many Props now as any other genre (bangles, bongs, dayglo posters,
piercings, tie dye, dreadlocks, Grateful Dead paraphenalia <decals, t
shirts, bumper stickers> and don't forget the designer label baggy
shorts!  Yes Virginia these costumes cost money too check out any barter
fair.

In closing--how this relates to raves--I believe that during the Rave
the Laws of Hipness are suspended and you may pretend it's Halloween and
stop being judgmental of the people around you whether they are in Dr.
Suess outfits, plastic clothes, business suits or Hippy uniforms.  If
this is a real problem for you consume mass quantities of alcohol or
illicit substances and try again <unless you are pregnant, a minor, or
in your right mind>

Cut off all their hair

I don't care

White collared conservatives flashing down the street
Pointing their plastic finger at me
They're hoping soon my kind will drop and die
But I'm gonna wave my freak flag high
High!

I'm the one 
Who has to die
When it's time for me to die
So let me live my life
The way I want to

I think perhaps a little later; because, when '70s retro hit back in '90: 
bell bottoms and platforms had disapeared completely. Perhapd we'll see 
New Ro style come back first. Or better yet some of that glamorous 
Poison, Motley Crue, Gene Loves Jezebel kinda style. ((Shudder)) Or 
better yet some early '80s Ska style. Oi! Oi! anybody know where I can 
buy a nice Vespa?

Oh know the '80s are coming. I'd better go pull out my old rekkids. I 
want to be the first to throw Book of Love and Big Audio Dynamite in the 
mix.

Subject: Cloud Factory NYE Party @ Monterey
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello,  just wanted to let everyone know that i'll be in monterey this NYE
for the Cloud Factory Party.  I am arriving in monterey at around 10:00 pm
via Greyhound and I should be at the party about 15-30 mins later.  Look for
the tiny asian dude with the blinking bicycle reflector lights and the green
light sticks and say hi.  

Much love,

anthony

P.S. I have an extra ticket to the party if anyone is interested.  It's half
price for the first taker.

I heard a rumor, and I'm having a hard time believing it, but someone
told me that Cloud Factory was a 21+ party.. I really hope not, I'm
really looking forward to having an incredible start to the new year!
Thanks a bunch!

The Cloud Factory party is not a 21+ party. It is
an all-ages event. We don't believe in age descrimination  ;)  ...

One word sums up this weekend:

Wow.

OK make that three:

Wow, no really.

Friday:  __ Karma III __

Afta getting off work I buzzed straight up to SF to pickup my Gateway
ticket and hang with some of my friends in Ye Grand ole City.  I ran
into Mystr-E on the Haight and we chatted about the scene, music,
parties, and what not for a bit...  Grabbed a bite, picked up a
bunch'o'friends, and headed to "the spot"

Got there while Douglas was spinning.  Goa and circle dancing just do
not mix in my opinion.  I see goa as a more free association of dancing
than "set" dancing which is what a lot of circle dancers do.  DJ D was
DATing some serious tunes tho' .  Got warmed up and loose though.
Mystr-E was next and for the fist few songs it sounded as if he was
doing the Goa-trnce thing as well.. But soon enough that cyber started
resonating through the speakers.  Dancing to trance got me 'there' a few
times through E's set.  I had to bail once or twice tho' (that damn leg
kicks in every once-in-a-while).  Too bad the sound kept cutting out
intermittently as well.  I think Thomas didn't like that either, he kept
running around like a chicken with it's head cut off, "cluck, cluck,
BCLOOCK!!".  Dancing next to the speaker and then silence. didn't help
the vibe much either.  

I was kickin' it when Thomas started causin' Trouble on the turntables.
I must admit, the man has an ear for jams esp. when he thru on that one
track w/the lyric "I see, I see, I see Red".  My body bounced up and
started dancing before my mind registered what was going on.
And then the whole thing went to a complete and utter halt when someone
tripped on a wire. (Ooops.).  We all scrambled like eggs to get things
up and running again.  

The sound recovered just in time for MARS set.  Mars is truly turning
into a very versatile DJ.  He spun some decent trance and went into some
chanting type trancy music...  It seems that he keeps his sets very
different from each other: from New Order, to hard dark trance, to
melodic soothing trance.  But it was during Mars set when I found IT.
The most incredible "here it is" feeling of anything:  I found the air
conditioner on the dance floor. 

I stayed a bit longer for Dutch bit bailed since I had to get some
friends back to their houses.

Saturday:  __ Galactic Tunnel __

I have to say before reviewing, that I hadn't had a wink of sleep since
Thursday night.  
Again Saturday I was running around the Haight until dusk.  Arriving to
"the spot" at 11PM.  The sound system was noticeably smaller but much
more cleaner.  Mystr-E did a much more clever set, very ON IMO...  I
kept dancing until Mr. Body did a "Force Quit"  and I crashed out in a
corner.  

I power napped for about an hour (till 2AM) . Waking up to techno can be
very uplifting.  I bust it to Carls Jr, fast some food and got back to
catch Ivo's set.  I have to say that in the world of goa dat DJ's, IVO
is one of the most technically competent vinyl goa DJs that Ive heard
yet.  No wonder he spins out frequently @ clubs.  The music, the smoke
and the vibe brought me back to the dance floor for about another hour
and a half.  I ran into a few friends and we bailed around 5:30 AM.

Through both nights I ran into many friends and family (hello, Mark,
Jay, Heidi, Sebastan (Another killer acid techno Dj from Germany),
Diane(sp?), Sabine, Scott, and a whole bunch of folk whose names escape
me.).  I'd also like to thank those who invited me to their UG's in the
upcoming weeks and as for the invite only UG's, I promise that no word
will escape my lips.

This weekend was a great ramp up for the NYE parties....
And It was a great experience WITHOUT anything illegal (or legal for
that matter) in my system.

one thing i must say is that ivo's set blew me away. its been a long time 
since a dj completely took me 'there' with their music. this was that 
rare time where every song lifted my consciousness higher and higher, and 
opened my body to the tremendous flow of cosmic energy untill i dissolved 
into the etheric plane... well, at least untill i had to leave in the 
middle of his set :( 
but soon again, there will be time to trance...

love,
tom

Here I go again (I feel like I have been saying this since I've joined the
list, but why not)...

I think it is pretty hypocritical to say that people should not drink at
raves.  Why not?  There are people who get fu**ed up on all sorts of
substances and why not have alcohol as one of them.  I think that there are
people who cannot deal with being fu**ed up, no matter what the substance
is.  I have seen enough people Eed out of there mind that their behavior
gets annoying as well as frightening.  I personally don't do E, so should I
say "I don't think people should do E at raves".  No, because I know the
other side of the picture where people on E are nice, and they know how to
behave without being annoying.

Same thing is with alcohol.  I love drinking and I wish there were more
drinking parties.  I do agree that there are people who cannot handle their
alcohol well, but there are always people who can't handle something.  I
have seen enough people drinking at small parties (house parties
especially) who behave themselves, and who are way fun to be with.  Not all
people who drink get annoying and just because you had few incidents with
them and because you are against drinking you shouldn't be labeling
everybody who enjoys a drink or two.  Drinking can be fun, as well as doing
other things, but you have to know the limits (as with everything) and know
how to be who you are no matter what you are on.

Please give some of us a chance,
*B*

P.S.  I am sure there are plenty of people who feel the same way as Pablo,
and I am sure they already have that labeling stuck in their head "this
person is drinking alcohol, therefore they must be annoying, drunks
whatever-not".  If you are one of them just think about what I said and
maybe you will be able to look at those people in a different way, rather
than judging them before you even met them

                      The 1997 SFR New Year's Eve Guide!

             http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/sf/calendar/gencal.cgi

OK, everybody!  Barring any last-minute entries, here's the lowdown for
New Year's Eve in a handy clip-out table.  Details are below.  I'm not sure
if Stompy wanted their location public, ask me if you're really interested.

Personally, Pacific/Gateway and Cloud Factory look the most exciting 
as reliable undergrounds.  I'd recommend getting advance tix as well.
Spundae and Origin have good lineups as well but may be more conventional, 
while Planet New Year looks huge if you like that.  The Art Salon should be 
groovy if you're more into the downtempo scene.  I don't really know much about
the E-Den people or the Midnight Express people; and Universe isn't really a
rave, but it'll have some prime house.  

Happy New Year!

It's time once again for Monday Night Dinner! :) This week features
Indian cuisine at:

Star India
415.668.4466
3721 Geary btw 2nd Ave & Arguello

Star India (from what I've heard) has some of the best Indian food
in town and some good prices (dishes around $5.99)... And of course
Indian is always vegan/vegetarian/carnivour friendly.

Tonight's dinner will be the last pre-Mad dinner of 1996, so bring any
stories from 1996 that you might want to share. And after dinner, as
always, we go to Mad at the Bahia Cabana on Market and Franklin. A 
lovely evening of dinner and dancing...;)

Dinner is at 8:30 as usual, and if you think you're going, drop me a
line. The last few dinners have been a lot of fun, so you definitely
don't want to miss this one!

Steve

Hey, y'all. Nice list you got here; I've been lurking just since Xmess but
the discussions are cool. I live in N.Carolina, but I subbed cuz some of my
work buddies and I are heading to SF for MacWorld next week and, well,
we're looking to dance in the Big City, y'know? Most of us go to parties in
the NC/DC/Baltimore area regularly (I saw your hometown boy Carlos this
past Friday in Greensboro, NC--*damn* was he good!).

We'll be in SF this Saturday the 4th through Saturday the 11th, and would
love to hear about the better club events, since it looks like there aren't
any big parties during that week so soon after NYE. Any suggestions would
be cool; I'm personally into a lot of different stuff from goa to hard acid
to deep house, but I'm most interested in finding a really funky,
acid-jazzy, trip-hoppy night somewhere, since we don't get a lot of the
good acid jazz stuff spun around here. (I'm talking like Ninja Tune, Mo
Wax, Luv n' Haight, etc., not the more cheesy Moonshine-type stuff, if that
helps). Mostly, though, we're just looking for clubs with the vibe.

Thanks in advance for any tips. We're looking forward to checking out as
much of your town as we can. And if anyone's gonna be at MacWorld, come by
the Alien Skin booth and meet the freaks. :)

Stylin' in my $12 gray hooded K-Mart sweatshirt, y'all.

I was just wondering... where can I go to hear jjjungle rrriddims this NYE?
The only thing that looks sufficiently junglistic for me is Cool World, and
I was hoping for something a bit more underground...

I'm new to the list, and I'm not too familiar with all of the DJs on the
various NYE lineups (Pacific, Cloud Factory, etc.).  If anybody has any
info for me, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks

A rave should be full of color; energy; love.

Drugs like LSD; E; and Weed are colorful.  Alcohol is dark.  I associate
booze with the slugs you see on Market St. at night.

Alcohol is for a special kind of person, a 'tuff' guy.  Tuff people are
attracted to it because if maintains that tuff attitude.  Let me
explain.  Say there is a group of guys, they work together at UPS.  Off
work; they hang out at each others homes or the local sports or country
/ western bar.  They ware 'tuff' cloths, eat cheap fast food, and don't
mind getting in a fight now and then.  Alcohol is perfect.  Drink a
little, and you get tuffer.  Drink more, and your ready for a fight.
Think of how many times you have seen EXACT examples of this, in a movie
when a character needs to "get up his courage", and belts down a swig on
whiskey.  He did not light up a joint, he drank booze, because it makes
him 'tuff'.

Now suppose the guy does a hit of acid.  Suddenly, he wants to talk
about what his friends consider 'nonsense'.  He is in no mood for a
fight.  And suddenly realizes a bar is a terribly boring place to spend
a evening.  Any all the talk of smashing a gays face sounds stupid.
It's a whole different mindset.  People high on LSD or E have no
interest in being around a drunk.  Drunks may be dangerous.

Think about it.  How many times have you see two people sit down and
smoke a joint, then get in a fight?  How many times have you seen
friends drinking, they get louder and louder until trouble starts.
Almost every case I can remember that trouble has occurred, somebody has
been drinking.  That is why I feel the way I do, I formulated my opinun
based on years of observation in social situations.  Statistics support
my conjecture:  95 % homicides involve drinking.  98 % of assaults have
some body drunk.  I bet most cops would rather have to deal with a group
of stoned people then a bunch of hot headed drunks.

If I wanted to be with people drinking, I would go to the local bar.  In
my opinun; a rave should be 100% alcohol free.  I want to be in a crowd
of stoned / tripping people with Goa Trance, Strobe lights, lasers,
smoke machines, color everywhere, and everybody in a very loving mode.
Alcohol kills the vibe.

I feel like I really should put in my two cents here..

Without placing any judgement of those who partake in the mass
consumption of alcohol (because the effects of the drug affect
the user much more than the user affects the effect of the drug),
I think we have to recognize that alcohol has its evil effects
on everyone.  Sure, I can see how people enjoy the value of
having a couple drinks to help them wind down and relax, or let
go of their inhibitions.. and I think this happens because it
shuts down part of your thinking; it makes you drowsy.  At the same
time, alcohol is indeed a dark substance bringing out some
undesirable parts of the subconscious.  Although there are
(perhaps many) people who use marijuana or other peace-inducing
drugs and still maintain that "tuff" attitude, it is because
of how big a part that attitude plays in their conscious lives.
My problem with alcohol is not that it makes certain people
"annoying", but that, even among friends, it causes feelings
of aggresiveness, arrogance, superiority, and disrespect to
surface.  The more you drink, the greater the effect, until
you become so drowsy you become too lazy to let your thought/
emotions influence your actions, and eventually cease to have
many thoughts/emotions whatsoever.
Without discussing the benefits of other drugs, or being judgemental
of "alcoholics", I just wanted to say something on the nature
of alcohol that everyone should acknowledge so they can better
understand why there are those of us out there who would rather
have alcohol-free events that would have a more positive vibe
and loving attitude.

Peace,

Leonardo

Hey Gang!

Due to the New Years thing, we've delayed the next Audio Impact till the
8th. However, we've gotten hold of a *delicious* space for New Years Day, so
we've decided to put it to good use.  ;)

This'll be an all ages afterparty for those yearning for something different
on the 1st. Ask around at the party you're at on New Years Eve, and I'm sure
you'll get pointed in the right direction.  :)

Since we'll be going from 6am - 6pm, we'll have a few openings for dj's.
Bring your records, and we'll try to fit you in!   ;)

"Keep this 'live...
'cause only the strong survive..."

Ciao!

Jonas

greetings,

i have been idling on the list for a few weeks now and i am hooked :)

i am moving to sf on the 2nd of january, and looking at the sfraves
homepage i see a ton of weekly events and being new, i have no idea which
ones to go to first. 

i am coming from ft. lauderdale and am looking forward to meeting new
people, hearing new dj's (im sick of the onese here) and dancing until the
sun comes up.

could anyone recommend, or suggest, or even more helpful, be willing to
take a newbie in the area under their wing?

much appreciation,
subCube

***Warning: this post has scattered rants and raves, and a long
conclusion that follows...***
Maybe its the rain...maybe vast generalizations annoy me...especially when
I am one of those generalized! but this post is not about being annoyed,
mainly about the rain otside, me trying to describe what I think a vibe is
and my personal argument for more beer...I mean uhhh...personal
responsibility.

> A rave 
>should be ??
>full of color; energy; love.

A rave **should be** nothing, a rave **should be** everything you want it 
to be and it should be nothing that you want, nothing
**should be** anything...could have, should have, and I cant are three
concepts that should be I-) removed from our thoughts... 

> 
> Drugs like LSD; E; and Weed are colorful. 
that depends on how much you use!

> Alcohol is dark.
not true, there are lots of light alcohols, try any domestic big name
beer on the market you will notice that it is definately light. ales tend
to be on the darker side, now, if your talking bass ale or guiness then I
would have to agree with you that these alcohols are dark. 

> I associate
> booze with the slugs you see on Market St. at night.
...yeah, and I associate weed and acid with the junkies and freaks I see
everyday on telegraph ave. and haight street. and e? you should see those
freaks that go to raves and take e and all night and have all night
pagan sex parties.

> 
> Alcohol is for a special kind of person, a 'tuff' guy. 
-e is for that special kind of 'sensitive' person
-weed is for that special kind of 'confused' person
-acid is for that special kind of 'reality challenged' person

> work; they hang out at each others homes or the local sports or country
> / western bar.  They ware 'tuff' cloths, eat cheap fast food, and don't
> mind getting in a fight now and then.  Alcohol is perfect.  Drink a
> little, and you get tuffer.  Drink more, and your ready for a fight.
-I think that this is a totally absurd argument...what are 'tuff' clothes
are they made under some sister company of adidas? (ha ha I-)) what does
fast food have to do with drinking and why does it need be cheap? 

-how many of you have ever sat in a room of ramen eatin, bong tokin,
'dirty' clothes wearin, unemployed, dont even leave the couch to clean the
stinkin hole theyre livin in much less go outside & do something
productive...  (yeah...the good ole days ;-))

> Think of how many times you have seen EXACT examples of this, 
yes, I agree, I do know of this stereotype that you are talking about...
but...(conclusion to follow below) 

> Alcohol kills the vibe.

now, time for me to hold the conch...
	the way i see it is that there are different energies in the
universe. and different energies inside all of us. the combined energies
of all the peoples and the energies they are channeling or trying to
reach for at a rave makes up for what we call the 'vibe'.
	The way i see it, the vibe we feel and find around us is
intimately connected to the individuals emotional system, (or it might be
the same thing, but thats a tangent) and what I have found in my
experience is that my emotional state does not stay the same over time.
And I feel that that is very healthy for me. Sometimes i want to feel the
happy-trippy vibe that you use to refer to what a rave is, and sometimes I
want something with a shade of black, or white, or spirit, or whatever.
But what i dont want is to go to a rave and find the same thing everytime.
How boring would that be?...pick your favorite vibe, ...now try to imagine
how long you could be stuck in that vibe before it drives you insane?
	change and variety are what make me feel that I am alive and
experiencing life as opposed to being some rabbits dream.
	the whole thing about realizing this relationship between your
emotions(vibe) and the overall vibe you experience as your relationship to
your environment (whether that be a rave or work or whatever) is that it
empowers you to have some degree of control over the life you experience.
tangent--> I think that this is something that alot of people are starting
to realize ( or maybe Im just projecting this...) not only in the rave
scene, (although I have found a higher concentration here)  but
everywhere.
	So, how does this all relate to alcohol at raves? it relates in
two ways but the idea is much bigger than just for alcohol at raves.
duh...alcohol, e, acid, pot, ghb, coffee are all drugs and can all
be abused and used. All the drugs except for e, i can give personal
accounts of its both positive uses and negative abuses.
tangent--> My personal opinion on e is that it makes me feel weird,
because most of the time, I can find that e feeling naturally by tuning
into it...but that feeling is also something that I re-learned how to
channel from taking e.

I think that what it basically comes down to is personal responsibility
and respect for self.
Dont put yourself in bad situations or bad vibes, be aware of who you
are partying with, be aware of the vibe you are recieving and putting out,
know the promoters and dj's for the parties you attend, or at least
know what kind of vibe they tend to plant before you decide to get really
hi, or decide to trust them enough to trance out.

-As a promoter putting on a rave, you have a very
important role and one of the responsibilities is planting the seeds which
will grow into full vibes over the course of the night.
-As a dj you are taking possibly many people some of who may be in very
hypersuggestive states on journees inside their consciousness, respect
that power.
-We collectively here on sfraves are also all creating the vibe which we
feel at the parties we go to together, whether or not we know each other
personally. 

i dont mean to sound like a know it all or anything like that, these are
things that i am constantly realizing and trying to put into practice in
my life...so i guess that is all I really have to say, ttfn =)

 respect yourself...the rest will follow

I-)
tr.

ps. if you see me enjoying a petes wicked winter brew at a party...dont
worry, im not the fighting type =)

        Well, I don't have any personal stake in it one way or the other,
as I am a total abstainer from all drugs (including alcohol) and have been
for many years. My attitude towards a drug is mostly based on how much I 
like or dislike hanging around other people who are on that drug, not on what
it does for me personally. 

	Alcohol is my least favorite drug to be around. Actually, it's
pretty much a tie between hanging around alcohol abusers who have plenty
of booze and hanging around junkies who don't have enough opiates - those
are my two least favorite types to be near. 

	Clearly, not everyone who drinks abuses alcohol. But if twenty
people come to a rave to drink, you bet your ass at least *one* of them 
will be an abuser. Alcohol abusers have poor impulse control & often act 
out violently. I don't want to be around that. Short of violence, abusers 
just tend to get obnoxious. They also throw up - often in inappropriate 
places. They also pass out, which I suppose doesn't hurt anything (unless
the party gets busted) but they're not adding a lot either. The rest of
it hurts the scene. Again, not everybody who uses alcohol abuses it, but 
the abusers are the most visible ones - they're the ones going out & 
drinking the most.


	And what makes the rave scene different from the bar scene? 
I think a big part of it is the emphasis on psychedelics rather than 
alcohol. Yes, people can get pretty schizo from psychedelics as well, 
but it just isn't as common, and the up side is that people who are having
positive experiences with psychedelics are often really fun to be around.

	The other thing that makes it different from the bar scene
is respect for & tolerance of those who choose not to use. That's completely
absent from the bar scene. If I go into a bar & don't drink the general attitude 
is that I'm not enough of a man - because real men can down a couple fifths of
Jack Daniel's and not get drunk. 


	I think that the tolerance towards non-users also stems partially
from the emphasis on psychedelics - because it's generally recognized that 
a psychedelic user who wants to stay sane and also wants to go out to raves
more than once a week/month/year ( <- reader's choice ) is going to end up 
hitting some raves sober.


	Anyone can bring just about anything into a rave and nobody
is going to start patting people down for unapproved substances at 
the door. I've seen that demonstrated many times. And I'm sure that
you personally, Branka, will not engage in any of the objectionable
behaviors I've listed above relating to alcohol abuse. And I'm sure
that it will be great fun to meet you & hang out with you sometime, 
whether or not you've got a couple drinks in you. But, Branka, if 
you do decide to come out to a warehouse party instead of the many
bars where they play this kind of music, can you promise you won't
be bringing along some friend who doesn't hold their liquor quite as 
well as you do? Because I don't find people who are drunk funny. 
At best they're pathetic and degraded, and at worst they're dangerous.

Sorry.. Didn't read your post all the way (yet) but.


  C'mon..   Taking LSD is not allways a happy go marry thing to do. Alot of
people have snapped out and done far more worse things than your average
every day alchoholic would even dream about doing in a black out.
  Taking LSD is not a wise thing to do. It may make you wise but, abuse
it... I used to take Acid in High School just about every other day. I
dropped out, I freaked out, I will not take it agian. I can not take it
agian. It is a twisted terrible thing to abuse. For some I guess it's
alright. But for no one, is it ok to abuse. You take that shit every
weekend. Your going to lose.
 As far as drinking to feel "tuff"..  Man, I don't know about that. I have
seen people break out in tears like a little baby all sloshed on hard
liquar. They say alchohol decreases your testousterown (ab ba du) levels.
But I don't know. 
 I will never stop drinking. I like to drink. Theres nothing more relaxing
then a cold one Sunday after a ravE. I don't have a problem with alchohol
at ravEs. But drunk fools starting trouble. That just sucks don't it. You
can "thank" the alchohol for pointing out such idiots for you.

Jeff

I never claimed to be anti-materialistic, just that I'm not willing to

No, but the second and third _do_ mean that such a person is generating
less waste and polluting our air less.  Personally, I ride my bicycle to
work most days, and am offended that I have to hack and wheeze because
no one else can be bothered to get out of their cars and locomote
themselves to work on a perfectly fine day.

And no, I'm not perfect.  I still own a car, and drive it sometimes, and
I don't always live up to my own standards.  But I've made tangible
changes, and guess what?  I'm a lot healthier and feel better for it. 
And you all get to breathe a touch easier as a side benefit.  

The only way to stop consuming entirely is to be dead.  "You're not
perfect" is not an argument against doing one's best.

Now _wait_ just a minute here.  I hope you're not pointing a finger at
me, because 1) you don't know me at all and 2) I don't dabble in etc.

Buy good stuff that'll last and that you'll still like next year,
whatever it is.  Don't buy super-trendy shit just because it's trendy,
knowing that you'll be giving it away next year.  Thrift stores are full
of so much shit that makes you ask "How did anyone _ever_ think this was

Good rant.  Both thumbs up from me.

But -- I reserve the right to pass judgment, and likewise, you are free
to call me a judgmental asshole.  Just make sure you know what I think
before ranting about it...

um, i seem to recall being patted down at the gathering...  

fortunately, most people don't recognize when i'm drunk.  unless i'm totally
hammered, in which case i'm just hammered, but not degraded or dangerous.

you know what would be cool?  if they made a pill that you could smuggle
into a rave as easy as E or LSD and that if you dissolve it into a water
bottle, it turns it into a clear cocktail.  it would have to taste good
warm of course...

        Then you're not drunk. Alcohol is a funny drug, the
recommended dosage is one that doesn't really intoxicate, just
relaxes.

	What you call "totally hammered" I call "drunk". And are you
sure you've got an objective point of view about how degraded you are
or aren't when you're "totally hammered"?

Maybe, maybe not. Ever been to a minimalistic party where there was no
great color, no happy, shiny people, but music that just blew you away? Is
that any less valid as a "rave?"

You are taking the best characteristics of the first three drugs, and
comparing them with the worst characteristics of the last. LSD, E, weed,
and alcohol all have the potential for use and abuse. Ever see someone
flip on out on LSD? Ever see or talk to someone who had sex or otherwise
did things they later regretted while under the influnce of any of these
drugs?

Or maybe the friend on LSD decides to go play on the freeway, and gets hit
by a car? It has happened to someone I know. 

People on LSD can be far more dangerous than a drunk. A drunk can be far
more dangerous than a person on LSD. It all depends on the person
involved.

No, we don't, because it is simply not true. You are making
generalizations, possibly based on your personal experiences, but that is
all they are, generalizations. You cannot, with any validity state that
alcohol has an evil effect on everyone. In order to do so, it would
require that you know "everyone" and have observed their behaviour under
the influence of any degree of alcohol.

Gee that sounds suspiciously like the effects of marijuana to me. And that
is the important thing to remember: different substances have different

I totally respect and enjoy alcohol-free events. I think that you and
others would do well to be a little more tolerant of those of us that
enjoy a drink once in a while. I promise not to throw up in your lap, or
punch you in the face.

you wanna help? I'll hold him down and you can get in a couple of

        I've been to two, and they didn't seem very boozy to me,
but maybe I just missed it. Still a daytime Sunday afternoon "wind-
down" type of party doesn't tend to bring out the lunatic energy
as much as your typical rave.

I have always witnessed a free flow of alcohol at Sunsets. And rather
there is the same perceived energy level is irrelevant to the discussion.
The point is that there is a large group of people out there, shaking
their asses, having a good time, and being *responsible* in their
consumption of whatever it they are doing. It is all about the people and
their attitude....

Some thread, eh?  Lots of good points to be made; hope I can add to the
good ones here.  There's a great danger in having alcohol at a party.  That
danger is that, if police find it at an "all-ages" event, those over 21 can
be cited for contributing to the delinquency of, or furnishing alcohol to,
minors.  It doesn't matter if no minor at the event in question had any
alcohol.  Now, someone under 21 can be cited for "minor in possession of
alcohol," so no one is safe.
Opinion: the more alcohol is present at parties, the more likely that
alcohol-related arrests will be made, and the more likely that more parties
will be busted, thus endangering the future of the scene.
Advice: if ya can't be good, be careful ;)
Peace,
Eric

Hey, it's Ken and Scott from The Crystal Method.  Just posting a note to try
and let some people know that we were never booked and won't be playing the
SF area on New Years Eve.  We were contacted, but nothing was ever agreed
upon between our booking agent and that Sassoon dude.  It's unfortunate that
some promoters finish their flyers and advertise acts that are not yet
confirmed.  There are at least a few other DJs/acts that are on the same
ad/flyer  we've seen that were never booked either and most are playing in
L.A.
Anyway we hope it's a great event and we can't wait to play the Bay area
sometime in the future (Spring or Summer).
We would appreciate any recommendations for honest promoters up there.

  I don't get it..  It clearly shows on line 12, that line 11 posted to the
sfraves list.
But I never got no mail from line 11, I only got mail from line 1 ...!!!  
Hmmmm..
 Could this be true???  Could Mr.Chung actually have a clitch in his
mailing list program?
  Or maybe I have a block on line 11..  I better check.
  Excellent placement of (fwd) in the subject header on line 3 though..
  From the looks of lines 4 & 10. it's only been about eight hours since
the original posting. Maybe..  Maybe I just haven't got it yet. Filtered
perhaps? Hmmm..

If someone from the band Crystal Method sent a post to
sfraves@hyperreal.com, that only brian@hyperreal.com received. Why would
the subject header read
Subject: The Crystal Method was never booked
I just think that if someone from the band actually posted to the list that
only brian received, the subject header would be less fishy if it was
formatted like
Subject: Crystal Method was never booked
Or to put it bluntly
Subject: We were never booked!

Not that it ain't true.
I hope I have a great New Years though. The last couple of weeks I have
been finding it difficult to have a good time. No ones fualt but my own

hi all:

are there any graphic designers out there with an interest in the music
culture that would be willing to donate some time and energy in exchange
for, say, an x-radio email address ( yourname@x-radio.com ), some web space,
and some discounted music?

i won't be loading this person up with a lot of heavy stuff right away...
it's more like a steady trickle of items, and when i need something done i
usually need it within two days.

if you're interested, please let me know asap, because i need you now!

happy new year!

You're right.  Alcohol doesn't have an evil effect of everyone.. it has
had an evil (sometimes devastating) effect on almost everyone *I've*
known.  And I don't mean having a few drinks; I mean alcohol as a
way of life, getting shitfaced every other day.  Still, it's true that
it is because of personal experiences that not only do I hold my
subjective view on the nature of alcohol, but I also felt inclined
to put in a comment when I hadn't bothered with all the other
bickerings.  I guess I really didn't want anything acknowledged
other than the fact that I, and others, had reason to feel that way.

I *tried* to stress that I wasn't placing ANY judgement on ANYone,
simply on what I see as the nature of (excessive) alcohol.  Alcohol
is alcohol, no matter how you react to it.. that's why I ever tried
to make a generalization on what that substance was.. I never meant
to lash out against millions of people I have not met and should not
have opinions on.  I AM tolerant.. the majority of my friends drink,
almost all of their friends drink, my mother certainly drinks, and
it has ceased to bother me one bit now that I feel comfortable knowing
I won't be sucked in to it again (I was an alcoholic at age 12).
When I expressed my appreciation for alcohol-free events I wasn't
saying I was wary of people who drank, or partying with people who
drank.  I certainly wasn't saying ALL raves "should" be alcohol-free.
The only generalized attitude/opinion I can have towards so many
people I have not met is one of openness and desire to understand.

Peace, and prosperous new year,

Leonardo

I just love how not a single SF jungle DJ is listed in this entire message.
Its great that big jungle acts are coming to SF, but there are local people
who have been working very hard in the jungle scene over the past year and
aren't just jumping on the exploding jungle/drum 'n' bass movement as if its
a bandwagon.  I get more excited when I see local DJs sharing the spotlight
with big names, rather than just the big names themselves.

Regardless, I'll probably be at these events 'cause I love drum 'n' bass
(props to FTT for their work)!

In eudora, you can redirect a message, leaving out the "Re:".  Brian also

And you can tell me that you have never seen a person on E trowing up?  I
have been going to parties for almost a year now, and I can tell you that I
know enough people who can't take E (sometimes LSD and shrooms) without
trowing up.  And they  are not as messed up as people who get drunk of
their asses.  Their body just can't deal with certain substances....  I
also know one person (on E) who curls up and falls asleep at parties and
then her friends have to look for her.  I guess you can call that passing
out.  I am not even going to start talking about passing out on GHB,
because that's the entire new topic.

Maybe one of the biggest problems with Americans and their attitude towards
drinking and people who drink is the society (themselves).  I grew up in
Croatia (Europe) where there is no drinking age, and the attitude towards
drinking is nothing compared to the attitude some people here have.  You
don't drink to get fucked up, you drink because you enjoy it.  And for me
it was more than embarrassing to get drunk of your ass in public (in
Croatia).  Things changed when I moved here, and I was a teenager who
followed the rest - I have been drunk plenty of times, with my collage
friends.  At 26, I know what I can do and what I like to do, so if I go to
a bar and drink one beer and if anybody tells me I am not enough of a girl
:P because I can't drink them under the table, I ignore that person.  Who
cares what they think?  I don't need friends or anybody who will feel like
peer pressuring me into things - that's for kids.

What are you talking about?  I go to enough warehouse parties, and all my
friends are people who have been going to raves for years.  And coincidence
is that almost all of them drink.  And when we have a house party (rave
like party) we drink.  And when we get home from a rave at 8am in the
morning there is nothing better than a cold beer (my roommate would argue
with me and say gin tonic is better, but what the hell).  And when we go to
Sunset we have beer with us.  I have never seen any of these people cause
any trouble because they were drinking.

>Because I don't find people who are drunk funny.
>At best they're pathetic and degraded, and at worst they're dangerous.

Gee, please make sure when you see me next time (and if I have a beer) not
to walk by me, because you never know, I might turn into a wild and crazy
beast and decide to beat you up.  And you never know, being my size maybe I
will succeed :P.

Few things to keep in mind
- not everybody who drinks is drinking to get drunk
- not everybody who like alcohol (and drinks) is an alcoholic
Please don't abuse these terms.

I would just like to end up this lengthy post with the worts and the best
moment (at parties in *warehouses*) that is related to drinking.

Gateway party this summer 7am
*B*: "I wish I had a cold beer right now".
"?": "Alcoholic?"

WOMO a month ago
- having one of the DJs give me a warm beer at 3am
- walking to the store on Mission at 7am to buy some beer to share with all
my other friends who drink, and seeing another DJ buying a cold 6 pack for

     there are some nice pointers here.  one thing to remember is that 
     people can only give opinions based upon their life experiences.  if 
     someone's had a great life as an LSD tripper, their whole life 
     experience will reflect on such.  look at terence mckenna, one would 
     think the only way to touch the spiritual world is through the 
     psilocybin mushroom.  humph.  
     
     on the other hand, if there are people who have had bad experiences 
     with psychadelicks, they are going to say they are bad.  some people 
     are never able to step out of their reality and realize that we are 
     heavily influenced by our life experiences which are all different 
     from person to person.  
     
     i've been to some really cool wicked parties that they had alcohol at 
     and they opened the bar up again around 6:30 am.  that was delicious, 
     candy flippin, havin a beer and gruvin to markie at 7am.  
     
     
     mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm- m!
     
     well, that's all for now...please disconnect your inhibitions and tear 
     down those walls.  you have my permission. :)

And you can tell me that you have never seen a person on E trowing up?  I 
have been going to parties for almost a year now, and I can tell you that I 
know enough people who can't take E (sometimes LSD and shrooms) without 
trowing up.  And they  are not as messed up as people who get drunk of 
their asses.  Their body just can't deal with certain substances....  I 
also know one person (on E) who curls up and falls asleep at parties and 
then her friends have to look for her.  I guess you can call that passing 
out.  I am not even going to start talking about passing out on GHB, 
because that's the entire new topic.

Big, Big Thanks to all that went to MAD last night.  Somehow, the club was
absolutely RAMMED! Extra special Thanks to JOHN HOWARD who put in a solid set
of Techno Groove music, once again proving that a 'House' DJ can hold his own
amongst the techno afficianados in town.  Nice work!
Please MARK your calendars for next Monday, Jan. 6th as MAD kicks off 1997
with a very special night with guest DJ/composer from the UK, Mark Broom.
 this man is sure to make some ears prig and heads nod, so all the massive
can't miss it!
Finally, Thanks to all who supported MAD since its return this past year.  We
hope that we can 'sock it to ya' some more the nineseven....Have a Happy and
safe New Year!

........Happy New Year everyone!!!!!  I for one, am going to be especially
grateful for the music I listened to, danced to, spun to, etc. during the
past five years...It may be the "end of the world as we know it."

  I know you've heard the dire predictions that MTV is coming to cash in on
the underground scene....Not only that, but this morning on the TODAY show
(of all places) a talking head from SPIN magazine predicted that the big
music companies are going to begin importing the music from the English
dance scene, or the "old rave" culture.  The industry executives new spin on
this music is to call it "Electronica.."

The talking head went on to explain that Alternative and Rap sales are
diminishing, so the music executives are looking to target a new market...

Stay tuned, or would anyone like to go a bit deeper underground and miss the
bloodsucking money boys as they look to cash in, not create underground
culture.....

Optimistically, we may have created enough culture to withstand the most
tawdry assaults...or maybe smart enough to keep doing what we're
doing..hopefully, the music makers,composers and writers will be given
greater freedom and access to producing new vinyl for us all......

.but, here's crossing my fingers for 1997.....Happy New Year

                                                                         Spi

hey all,

just wanted to intoduce myself and a friend. i'm orson, and my friend is
celina. we're kinda just gettin into the scene here. i've been readin the
list for a few weeks now, and it just makes me feel good to know there
are people like u. we are two really nice people who would like to be
around other really positive, genuine people. i love ambient music, as
well as jungle, trance, etc...(tho i'm kinda just gettin into it) . above
all, we would like to feel the "vibe". we would like to be free (at least
for the duration of the event) of the hateful world and just let go, be
free, and feel the whole range of postive emotions. 

so, i figured that it would be a way to kick off the new year. we're
planning to hit the cloud factory event tonite. i still gotta get some
tickets (hope they're not all gone).  if anyone could please <---see,
magic word =) "show us around" it would be very greatly appreciated. like
kinda just introduce us to people and promoters and dj's and the like...

BTW, we live in oakland, and i'm gonna be drivin down there, so if anyone
needs a ride to cloud factory, no problem. u can email me @ this address,
or call me @(510)832-1638 or page @ (510)321-8282 <---pls leave area
code, thanx =).

if not, please say hi to us tonite :). i'm asian, 'bout 5'7,
135#...prolly wearin a khaki colored baggy pants...not sure of top...
short buzzed black hair...she's asian/caucasian 'bout 5'9 (yeah she
tall...me short..hee hee) ummm i dare not guess her weight (heh heh) she
may kill me if i'm wrong...hee hee hee...but she's in good shape...long
drk brn hair, not sure what she'll be wearin. so say hi K? 

=8-)

thanx  a bunch

hope to see a bunch of sfravers there!!!and happy new year!!!...and be
safe!!!

I'd say that it was a very articulate post.  Thanks for saying it; you
summarized a lot of what I was thinking.

Hey!  I've lived with one of these!  You can add street-car racing
to the list too.

[deleted]

But in all seriousness, you've spoken a lot of truths.  I like to remind
myself of the words contained in the following quote (that I may have
swiped from someone here on the list.)  (And I must remind you to do
so in moderation.)  Here's that quote:

--
"Don't ask yourself what the world needs.  Ask yourself what makes
you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is
people who have come alive." - Howard Thurman

I think a lot of us here understand it.

Hello SFRaves -

 This is a reply I got from the folks at CRYSTLMTHD@aol.com, who I
assume are Crystal Method. The message mentions a web site, which 
I haven't checked out yet.

(Just another Tuesday night)

Getting very excited for the celebration tonight!  I just got back from 
picking up a few essentials, and I intend to spoil a whole bunch of 
people tonight ;)  Look out for me and my tangerines, jelly beans, and 
assorted gifts.  And my treasured 70's lounge gown will be making its 
debut!  If that's not enough to recognize me, I dare you to miss my 
ridiculous furry pink bathrobe.  Ah, fashion!

Suddenly torn at the last minute between Gateway and CCC... But I already 
have my ticket for Gateway, and I am really happy to hear it's in 
Oakland!  The less driving this night, the better.  And I partied NYE'96 
with the same tribe... I also ran into old raver friends today on 
Telegraph, who had just driven up from LA just for this party!!  Now 
that's commitment!

Wishing you much fun and insanity on this night, wherever you are.

In addition to the usual NRR subject header prefixes -- is there any
chance people asking for rides could preface their subject line with
something like "RIDE:"...  We could even get more specific with a
location parameter, e.g. "RIDE(SantaCruz):", "RIDE(SF)",
"RIDE(OAKLAND):", "RIDE(BERKELEY)"...

Thanks, and have a happy new year.

Anyone in Marin County need a ride to the Gateway party in the East Bay?  
If so, give me a call after 9:00 pm 415-459-5334.  The window is 1.5 
hours.  You need to be able to get to the San Rafael Bus Station..and be 
willing to stay all night until the sun rises..  
~~peace
