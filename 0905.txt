[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup



featuring from Berlin:

STEWART WALKER - LIVE

(Persona . Force Inc . Tresor . M-nus)

Stewart Walker first gained international prominence in the late
'90s with a series of classic releases on Force Inc., Tresor,
Mille Plateau and M-nus which proved to be highly influential in
the development of minimal techno.  A decade later he's still at
the top of his craft, touring the globe with his infectious,
emotive live techno stylings and releasing quality music on his
own Persona imprint.  Stewart's said he's got a special set in
store for [KONTROL], and we couldn't be more excited or
honored to host this iconic figure in his Endup debut.



and from Munich:

DARIO ZENKER

(Vakant . Harry Klein . Num . Telegraph)
(Esperanza . Soma . Mo's Ferry)

Raised on Michael Jackson and underground hip-hop, Dario
Zenker picked up DJing at age 15, and within a few years
landed a residency at Munich's famed Harry Klein club that he
still holds today.  In addition to his ace productions on several
top labels, he is known for his dynamic sets of freaky, organic,
house-driven minimal techno that always keep the crowd
guessing and the dancefloor bouncing.



with special guests:

DIMA  (Platform . TeknoKitchen)

ANDRE LUCERO (Fiction . Urban Development)



and [KONTROL] residents:

NIKOLA BAYTALA  (S.W.A.T. . Robsoul . Junior Boys Own)

CRAIG KUNA  (Platform . ESDJCO)

ALLAND BYALLO  (Nightlight . Auralism . Leibe*Detail)

STEWART WALKER

Berlin-based Stewart Walker is a restless innovator. After making a splash
in the late nineties on definitive labels like Force Inc. and Tresor, he=92=
s
had an inestimable impact on the development of current club sounds, yet
consistently chooses the less traveled road: working as live producer in a
world of DJs; injecting emotion into functional electronic dance music;
quietly building a label family of unclassifiable artists on his own
imprint, Persona.

After selling his guitar in 1993, Walker began assembling a synth-based
hardware studio while in university in Athens, GA. Inspired by Jeff Mills=
=92
Live at the Liquid Room he became obsessed with rhythm. A string of
recordings appeared on Matrix Records in Detroit =96 including the 1997 sin=
gle
Amphetamine Sulphate =96 and later on Deepfried (Grand Rapids, MI) and Tekt=
ite
(Austin, TX). A year later, his first European release Artificial Music for
Artificial People was picked up by Cristian Vogel's British imprint,
Mosquito, and Walker hit the live circuit. Armed with only an AKAI MPC2000
sampler and a DJ mixer, he did what a DJ never could: move a club crowd wit=
h
sounds shaped by his own hands. This original approach was welcomed across
Europe and in Japan as well as his native US.

1999 saw Walker=92s debut on Berlin=92s Tresor Records with Nothing Produce=
s
Stark Imagery, followed up by the now-classic minimalist experiment,
Stabiles, on Mille Plateaux. These productions proved to be seminal in the
development of minimal techno.

Walker continued to release on labels such as Minus and Force Inc. until, i=
n
2001, he set up his own imprint, Persona Records. Persona released eleven
records in the US culminating in the second landmark album of Walker=92s
career to date: Live Extracts (2003). Live Extracts captured the sound and
atmospherics of Walker=92s in-club performances and was soon licensed by
Tresor. Persona restarted in 2005, this time in Berlin. Now based in Europe=
,
Walker performed in every capital and made incursions as far afield as
Australia and Russia. Soon after, he released the downtempo album Grounded
in Existence and a breakbeaty techno EP, Travel Plaza. These releases
showcased Walker=92s increasing attention to nuance, dynamics, and melody.
Concentricity, Walker=92s fourth full-length, was released in 2007.

DARIO ZENKER

Just in time, the =91Free State=92 of Bavaria has produced a new son to rel=
ight
its techno torch. Munich born and raised Dario Zenker is writing his own
chapter in the long story of electronic music from Germany=92s dirty south.=
It
all started with listening to Michael Jackson as a kid, then Dario moved on
to underground hip hop to rile the neighbors.Several visits from the
not-so-friendly neighborhood police later, Dario=92s father, a pro audio
engineer, introduced the wunderkind to music programming and imparted the
tools which later consumed him. At 15 Dario started to DJ, and not too long
after he received his club education from the legendary Ultraschall.In 2005
at the ripe old age of 21, Dario landed his residency at Harry Klein which
he still maintains today.2006 saw his debut vinyl release and in the space
following Dario managed to sprinkle his magic chuga chuga dust on some of
the world=92s finest minimal techno labels.Whether DJ-ing or playing live, =
in
just a few years Dario has built up a reputation for freaky experimental
sets which never seem to stay in the same place for too long. Constantly
innovating Dario has never been content walking a straight line with the
crowd. To attempt to put it into words:bomb, duck, cover, swerve, bomb,
swerve, bomb bomb.In 2008 =91the=92 youngin became =91our=92 youngin joinin=
g the
hallowed ranks of the Vakant crew with Dario=92s split personality =91Sam U=
nd
Er/Womde!=92 EP (VA019). Dario=92s thick kink finds a natural home here on =
the
Vakant deep freak out bus bumping and bouncing the club kids wherever they
need to go. Liberalitas Bavarica!

ANDRE LUCERO

A veteran of West Coast underground electronic music culture, Andr=E9 Lucer=
o
continues to reinvent himself.  From breakdancing in the early 80's to his
present studio efforts, he always kept his focus on beats and sounds of
genres to come.  Starting with the earliest electro hip-hop, passing throug=
h
time and space to the present and future of electronic music, his selection=
s
are open minded but always have a dancefloor sensibility.

Not being satisfied with spoon feeding or accepting convenience, Andr=E9 ha=
s
chosen the paths less traveled.  Helping foster the rave scene in Santa
Barbara; playing at the first mega-rave in the US (Raveamerica); releasing
one of the first (if not THE first) underground electronic dance music mixe=
d
CD's (Fusion, Volume 1); his involvement with the seminal San Francisco
techhouse event/DJ crew, Urban Development; to playing with international
legends for Space Children, he has been recognized for decades as a stand
alone talent who brings something special to the lineup.  Sharing the decks
with some of the heaviest hitters on the planet, he understands how to rock
a crowd as well as to tell a story.  No two sets from Andr=E9 are alike.  E=
ach
moment drives the relevance of the music selection.  Each moment is unique.
 The sound: warm, spacey, funky, soulful techno.  Having recently relocated
to Ohio, we are happy to welcome Andre back for a much anticipated second
perfomance at [KONTROL]..

Subject: [sfraves] NRR - Help save the Juneteenth Parade in Galveston, TX!


Hey all,

A group of friends and I are starting a fundraising group to help the people of Galveston TX, which was hit HARD by Hurricane Ike.  We're starting small.  

The Juneteenth parade on Galveston Island is an annual celebration of the cessation of slavery in Texas, the proclamation of which was initially issued right there on the island in 1865.  The parade has always been immensely important to the (heavily African-American) community, but especially now, it's a unifying event for a town of people, many of whom have been scattered to surrounding areas due to the hurricane's damage.

This year, due to extreme lack of funds, the parade will not be held for the first time ever- and that's for the lack of a few thousand dollars.  We hope to raise those funds and more, through independent donations and an awesome fundraiser party we're putting the finishing touches on now.  

If you want to find out more, make a donation, or stay updated on the party, see our new site: http://www.sfheartsgalveston.com.  We're Twittering @savejuneteenth.  If you get inspired to blog, Twitter, LJ, or just talk about this to your friends, all the better!

Lots of love,
George

I'm way into terrence and all, but timewave zero, while entertaining,  
compelling, and well documented is just woo woo new agey stuff at the  
end of the day. I think 2012 will be significant inasmuch as the mass

On the other hand, the fractal form of the increase in "novelty", whatever that really is, is easily documented.  Its the connection to 2012 and the i ching that seems sort of like new age fluff, not the general notion of increasing novelty or the fractal form of such a "wave".

Perhaps a better formulation of whatever is happening right now, is Vernor VInge's idea od the singularity.  In this view, its not that novelty ceases to be generated, but rather that so much novelty is generated in a short period of time, that beings living just before and just after the singularity can't even communicate.  Its not the end of history, its just the end of the sort of history that our puny brains can understand.

So for what its worth, the thing I remember most fondly about sfraves is that not only could you find a list of parties, but you could have conversations about these sorts of oddball ideas without being laughed off the stage.  Virtually speaking of course.

Regards,

Peter

I'm way into terrence and all, but timewave zero, while entertaining, compelling, and well documented is just woo woo new agey stuff at the end of the day. I think 2012 will be significant inasmuch as the mass cultural focus will build around it, but when 12/21/2012 comes and goes, no  one will notice a thing. the shift in consciosness will be invisible, if it happens at all.

my take on it after studying all the McKenna I could get my hands on.

Timewave Zero aside, Karina (who ran the sfr calendar) seems to have
gone permanently MIA. A homie of mine tried to contact her about
taking it over, and never got any response... so he started his own:

galaxyraver.com

which is a message board and pretty nice events calendar. You post a
thread about your event and it automatically creates a calendar entry.
There are still easily 4 parties a night on the weekend to choose
from; many of them arent listed on public forums or boards.

I dunno about you, but I have way more fun these days than I did back when SFR was poppin'.  I don't go to quite as many "raves", but somehow I'm dancing to rad music and seeing cool art with a great group of friends all the time.

..and I'm not a dumb kid anymore, either, which helps! ;)

Novelty, shmovelty, we're staring at the next summer of love, kids!

*What
*"Pulse Night" on DEFsf.com's Radio Integrated
*When
*Friday May 15th, 2009
9pm-? PST
*Where
*Bliss Factory Studios & online: http://radio.defsf.com:1200//

*Who
*MEGAPOLE:
Pulse Mik,   DJ Mik, aka MEGAPOLE began spinning records in San 
Francisco. His musical tastes have spanned the entire electronic music 
spectrum throughout his 10 years behind the decks. Starting with house 
music he quickly ascended the BPM ladder and found himself ultimately 
coveting techno as his true love. However, this has never discouraged 
him from experimenting with anything that had a good beat and worked 
well on the dancefloor. Some other styles of music he enjoys spinning 
are hip hop, breaks, jungle, downtempo, funk, and soul. Born in Poland, 
Mik's love for music began at an early age as his uncles exposed him to 
everything from jazz to rock. A self-taught guitarist and drummer, Mik 
learned quickly that music comes from within one's soul. Combined with 
his love for records he is always pushing himself to evolve and grow as 
a DJ. Mik's experience ranges from playing underground parties in San 
Francisco to throwing his very own events. The most recent being Crush, 
which was held in the Temecula wine country.

DHAMMA:
Pulse | Goodbeats   Dhamma has been in love with electronic music since 
the late 1980's. She moved to San Francisco in 1994 where she was 
introduced to the local rave culture. This forever changed her life. 
After years of attending parties, she could no longer just stand in 
front of the turntables. She began DJing in 1998 and enjoys spinning a 
variety of genres. While she is better known for playing driving house 
music, her favorite will always be techno. Dhamma's style is one of 
smooth transitions and flowing song progressions. You can hear her 
mixing it up on the goodbeats.com podcast and at upcoming events.

ALIXR:
Pulse | FnF | rEvolution Alixr is making a name for himself with his 
energizing blend of techno, tech house and electro. Co-founder of 
rEvolution and Pulse, and a contributing member of Friends & Family 
since 1995, his dedication and love for the scene is palpable. In 
addition to playing many of SF's hottest nightclubs such as Mighty, 
Temple, Harlot, Paradise Lounge and Shine, he's also a regular guest DJ 
at LA's legendary Moontribe full moon desert gatherings. Keep your eyes 
peeled for Alixr as he works his magic on a dancefloor near you!

 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>DJ Mik, aka MEGAPOLE
began spinning records in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

Francisco</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">. His
musical
tastes have spanned the entire electronic music spectrum throughout his
10
years behind the decks. Starting with house music he quickly ascended
the BPM
ladder and found himself ultimately coveting techno as his true love.
However,
this has never discouraged him from experimenting with anything that
had a good
beat and worked well on the dancefloor. Some other styles of music he
enjoys
spinning are hip hop, breaks, jungle, downtempo, funk, and soul. Born
in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Poland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">, Mik's
love for music began at an early age as his uncles exposed
him to everything from jazz to rock. A self-taught guitarist and
drummer, Mik
learned quickly that music comes from within one's soul. Combined with
his love
for records he is always pushing himself to evolve and grow as a DJ.
Mik's
experience ranges from playing underground parties in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">San
Francisco</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;"> to
throwing his very own events. The most recent being Crush,
which was held in the Temecula wine country.</span><span

 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Dhamma
has been in
love with electronic music since the late 1980's. She moved to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">San

 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">
in&nbsp;1994&nbsp;where&nbsp;she&nbsp;was introduced to the local
rave culture. This forever changed her life. After years of attending
parties,&nbsp;she could&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;just stand in front of the
turntables. She began DJing in 1998 and enjoys spinning a variety&nbsp;of
genres. While she is better&nbsp;known for playing driving house music, her
favorite will always be techno.&nbsp;Dhamma's style is one of smooth
transitions and&nbsp;flowing song progressions. You can hear her mixing it
up
on&nbsp;the goodbeats.com podcast and at upcoming events.</span></span><span

Exactly! You could have conversations on here about timewave zero and other=
 phenomenom that we encountered. This is a fantastic planet. We need to kee=
p it because it is priceless. Our culture is not something that needs to be=
 preserved. It is a culture that thrives on the unknown and the creation of=
 novelty. That is what our culture is all about. The creation of novelty is=
 what we are all about. That is why parties were so good and the music was =
so good and y things were so good. It was all because it was always new. It=
 was constant and never ending Novelty. NEVERENDING novelty. Let's=A0overco=
me timewave zero and save Fantasia for us so we can say it was as if the no=
thing never was. Dare to dream!
=A0
This is not a spelling bee! Wake up and claim this culture as your own. Thi=
s is our way of life and without this there is nothing but re-runs on telev=
ision.
=A0
May the Force be with you,
Paulewog

On the other hand, the fractal form of the increase in "novelty", whatever =
that really is, is easily documented.=A0 Its the connection to 2012 and the=
 i ching that seems sort of like new age fluff, not the general notion of i=
ncreasing novelty or the fractal form of such a "wave".

Perhaps a better formulation of whatever is happening right now, is Vernor =
VInge's idea od the singularity.=A0 In this view, its not that novelty ceas=
es to be generated, but rather that so much novelty is generated in a short=
 period of time, that beings living just before and just after the singular=
ity can't even communicate.=A0 Its not the end of history, its just the end=
 of the sort of history that our puny brains can understand.

So for what its worth, the thing I remember most fondly about sfraves is th=
at not only could you find a list of parties, but you could have conversati=
ons about these sorts of oddball ideas without being laughed off the stage.=
=A0 Virtually speaking of course.

Peter

I'm way into terrence and all, but timewave zero, while entertaining, compe=
lling, and well documented is just woo woo new agey stuff at the end of the=
 day. I think 2012 will be significant inasmuch as the mass cultural focus =
will build around it, but when 12/21/2012 comes and goes, no=A0 one will no=
tice a thing. the shift in consciosness will be invisible, if it happens at=
 all.

my take on it after studying all the McKenna I could get my hands on.

For some reason this thread has put me in mind of an old Bob and Ray radio
skit about the driving of the Golden Spike in Promontory Point, Utah that
marked the completion of the Trans-Continental Railroad system.

One theory about the Mayan 2012 Calendar is that they simply ran out of
ideas, and nothing more. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

In the Bob and Ray skit they're driving in the Golden Spike, the train
approaches and... it runs out of track.

Google is useless in tracking the clip down. If anybody on here is friends
with Ray's kid, Chris Elliot, please ask him where I can find it. My ex in
NYC has the bit on a piece of vinyl I left behind when I moved, but I'll be
damned if I'm going to to her for it.

Thanks!

This formulation of time has a number of problems; in particular, without the passage of time it is unclear how anything happens.  If there is only one moment, NOW, how can there be causality at all?  We may be close to understanding this actually, and the answer I think is revealed in your posting: memory.

You are correct in pointing out that past and future only make sense in the context of a memory of some sort which records events as they happen,  but if you think about it, the entire universe acts as exactly this  sort of memory.  

Consider the proverbial tree falling in the forest.  Even if no one observes its falling, if we later visit the forest we will see a fallen tree.  The act of falling has already happened and is "remembered" by the universe itself in the form of the fallen tree.  Something that the universe "remembers" in this way is in the past even if there is no person to observe its falling.

At one level this whole question of causality is an illusion.  The universe is just one big "thing" that's not really a "thing" by any reasonable definition of the word.  So in some sense the universe just "is" right now.  Nothing can happen, because there's no "thing" for it to happen to.  That's the level of absolute truth, but unfortunately for most of us it is not the level at which we exist, understand, or experience our lives.

The question of the "illusion" of time then is whether this apparent change, novelty, that we experience is simply an illusion or whether the underlying fabric of the universe includes some sort of "motility"; that is, is there is some notion of action or activity inherent in existence?  The answer FWIW appears to be yes.

If you are interested in this sort of stuff, I'd like to recommend delving deep into quantum mechanics; a good text is Penrose's Road to Reality if you have  a strong math background. On the spiritual side, consider Herbert Guenther's seminal three volume set *Kindly Bent to Ease Us* based on the writings of Tibetan scholar Longchenpa.  

>From volume 3:

"Openess and radiance belong to the domain of experience without which they would lose all meaning, as a dynamic process experience is imbued with and becomes structured intentionality.  This very dynamic is tendential (rig-pa) in that it exhibits certain tendancies and dispositions to relate and arrange the content of experience as meant."

Ok its too early in the AM to make sense out of that probably...

Best,

Peter

The future is missing something though. I think what it is missing is called the present.
Everything happens now in the present. The future is just a concept. The transcendental object at the end of time is deceptive. Time is only relative to the person experiencing it.
Memory is a trick. Whoever thinks the future is something that is ahead has been lied to.

In this view, its not that novelty ceases to be generated, but rather that so much novelty is generated in a short period of time, that beings living just before and just after the singularity can't even communicate.

Our primate evolved minds seem bound by 3 dimensions. We have a sense  
of the 4th, but it is vague.

If we could perceive time as we could spatial dimensions, meaning  
could walk the 4th dimension as we do the 3 that make up physical  
space as we know it, what would it be like? Are our minds/bodies  
capable of traversing time as we traverse space to the kitchen to get  
a beer? Why not just "walk" over to 2012, as it were, and have a look?  
3D vs. 4D perception. Time as a landscape as the McKennas postulate?  
Is time not a surface just like the floor? If time were my floor, then  
what is that gum spot that I haven't cleaned up from the other night?  
Is that a patch of novelty or habit? Perhaps the eschaton is just  
that: the ascension of our minds to walk the 4th dimension, turning  
time flies into fruit flies.

heh,
andy

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: AFTERGLOW - an evening of mellow electronics - Sunday @ Nickie's 
	- FREE!

AFTERGLOW was conceived as a chance to wind down after a long weekend
by listening to some chill music and having a few drinks with friends.
The idea is to allow some of SF's most talented and multi-faceted
dance music DJ's an opportunity to dig deeper into their collections
and play music they wouldn't be able to in a club setting. Anything's
game, from ambient to dub techno, idm, atmospheric drum n bass,
downtempo, future jazz, deep house and beyond.

Feynman would disagree.

It seems that, for at least some interpretations of the Standard  
Model, time is orientable;  that is, the Universe is a big holographic  
object that extends both directions in time;  for a more readily  
comprehensible model of this, imagine a cellular automaton such as  
Conway's Life.  This is normally visualized as a two-dimensional array  
of cells which can be "full" or "empty", and whose future state  
depends upon the current state.  Another way of visualizing this is as  
a three-dimensional stack of sheets of cells, with the stacks above  
the current sheet being previous iterations and the stacks below the  
current sheet being future iterations.

The Universe as we see it is a slice of a higher-dimensional object.  
(Huxley would have loved this.)

But how, you may ask, could we have freedom of action in a cellular  
automaton?  This comes about in our model because given a particular  
set of Conway's Life cells, there are many possible configurations  
that can have led to that set;  it is not possible to determine from  
the final result which particular configuration was ultimately  
responsible for the current state.  Since the system is orientable wrt  
time, the direction of Time's Arrow is relevant only in the choice of  
rules that are used to generate the ongoing evolution of the system.

Thus a system that is deterministic from the point of view of  
ascending time may in fact be nondeterministic when viewed from the  
opposing direction.

Now, to finish this research I will need a massive computer and a  
really great random number generator...

I agree that there isn't a specific previous state that is recorded in the universal memory, but I don't accept that there is no memory.  

We can know by examining the world that one of a class of previous states has occurred.  And even in the simplified world of Conway's game of life, it is not true that any given state can be arrived at from any other previous state.  Therefore, even though the next state only depends on NOW and not on any prior state, it is not true that by examining the state of the game we can learn nothing about its history.  Some information is preserved.  At the very least we can exclude some impossible prior states, i.e. states from which the current state can not be reached, but in some cases we can actually know the entire history of specific cells.  For example consider the well known  "pulsar" oscillator, http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/Pulsar.html.

Reality works the same way perhaps.  For example, we can observe a fallen tree and know that it fell somehow, but the precise manner in which it fell, the precise time of the falling, the exact sound it made, and of course the proximate cause of the fall may still elude us.   Nevertheless, the facts that the tree once stood and now has fallen are recorded in the form of the fallen tree as are many other facts of its existence such as its age, the chemical composition of the soil in which it lived, and much more.One could say that the universe remembers the tree therefore, at least for a time, because these facts about the tree seem to be stored in the universe itself.   

Of course the universal memory is also impermanent just as our human memories are.  Eventually the tree will disintegrate, its previous existence will become undetectable even to the most precise instruments, and all evidence of the tree's existence will be lost forever even to the most secure form of memory one could imagine or construct.  

Best,

Peter

Feynman would disagree.

It seems that, for at least some interpretations of the Standard Model, time is orientable;  that is, the Universe is a big holographic object that extends both directions in time;  for a more readily comprehensible model of this, imagine a cellular automaton such as Conway's Life.  This is normally visualized as a two-dimensional array of cells which can be "full" or "empty", and whose future state depends upon the current state.  Another way of visualizing this is as a three-dimensional stack of sheets of cells, with the stacks above the current sheet being previous iterations and the stacks below the current sheet being future iterations.

The Universe as we see it is a slice of a higher-dimensional object. (Huxley would have loved this.)

But how, you may ask, could we have freedom of action in a cellular automaton?  This comes about in our model because given a particular set of Conway's Life cells, there are many possible configurations that can have led to that set;  it is not possible to determine from the final result which particular configuration was ultimately responsible for the current state.  Since the system is orientable wrt time, the direction of Time's Arrow is relevant only in the choice of rules that are used to generate the ongoing evolution of the system.

Thus a system that is deterministic from the point of view of ascending time may in fact be nondeterministic when viewed from the opposing direction.

Now, to finish this research I will need a massive computer and a really great random number generator...

This formulation of time has a number of problems; in particular, without the passage of time it is unclear how anything happens.  If there is only one moment, NOW, how can there be causality at all?  We may be close to understanding this actually, and the answer I think is revealed in your posting: memory.

You are correct in pointing out that past and future only make sense in the context of a memory of some sort which records events as they happen,  but if you think about it, the entire universe acts as exactly this  sort of memory.  

Consider the proverbial tree falling in the forest.  Even if no one observes its falling, if we later visit the forest we will see a fallen tree.  The act of falling has already happened and is "remembered" by the universe itself in the form of the fallen tree.  Something that the universe "remembers" in this way is in the past even if there is no person to observe its falling.

At one level this whole question of causality is an illusion.  The universe is just one big "thing" that's not really a "thing" by any reasonable definition of the word.  So in some sense the universe just "is" right now.  Nothing can happen, because there's no "thing" for it to happen to.  That's the level of absolute truth, but unfortunately for most of us it is not the level at which we exist, understand, or experience our lives.

The question of the "illusion" of time then is whether this apparent change, novelty, that we experience is simply an illusion or whether the underlying fabric of the universe includes some sort of "motility"; that is, is there is some notion of action or activity inherent in existence?  The answer FWIW appears to be yes.

If you are interested in this sort of stuff, I'd like to recommend delving deep into quantum mechanics; a good text is Penrose's Road to Reality if you have  a strong math background. On the spiritual side, consider Herbert Guenther's seminal three volume set *Kindly Bent to Ease Us* based on the writings of Tibetan scholar Longchenpa.  

>From volume 3:

"Openess and radiance belong to the domain of experience without which they would lose all meaning, as a dynamic process experience is imbued with and becomes structured intentionality.  This very dynamic is tendential (rig-pa) in that it exhibits certain tendancies and dispositions to relate and arrange the content of experience as meant."

Ok its too early in the AM to make sense out of that probably...

Best,

Peter

The future is missing something though. I think what it is missing is called the present.
Everything happens now in the present. The future is just a concept. The transcendental object at the end of time is deceptive. Time is only relative to the person experiencing it.
Memory is a trick. Whoever thinks the future is something that is ahead has been lied to.

Thanks for the advice.

You wrote,"there
are many possible configurations that can have led to that set;  it is
not possible to determine from the final result which particular
configuration was ultimately responsible for the current state. "

This is false in general.  It is easy to see why by examining specific cases such as in the example of a periodic oscillator which I linked to below.  Not only can I know precisely what state preceded the current state in this case, I can know the entire history of every cell in the game.

Best,

Peter

We can know by examining the world that one of a class of previous states has occurred.  And even in the simplified world of Conway's game of life, it is not true that any given state can be arrived at from any other previous state.  Therefore, even though the next state only depends on NOW and not on any prior state, it is not true that by examining the state of the game we can learn nothing about its history.  Some information is preserved.  At the very least we can exclude some impossible prior states, i.e. states from which the current state can not be reached, but in some cases we can actually know the entire history of specific cells.  For example consider the well known  "pulsar" oscillator, http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/Pulsar.html.

Reality works the same way perhaps.  For example, we can observe a fallen tree and know that it fell somehow, but the precise manner in which it fell, the precise time of the falling, the exact sound it made, and of course the proximate cause of the fall may still elude us.   Nevertheless, the facts that the tree once stood and now has fallen are recorded in the form of the fallen tree as are many other facts of its existence such as its age, the chemical composition of the soil in which it lived, and much more.One could say that the universe remembers the tree therefore, at least for a time, because these facts about the tree seem to be stored in the universe itself.   

Of course the universal memory is also impermanent just as our human memories are.  Eventually the tree will disintegrate, its previous existence will become undetectable even to the most precise instruments, and all evidence of the tree's existence will be lost forever even to the most secure form of memory one could imagine or construct.  

Best,

Peter

Feynman would disagree.

It seems that, for at least some interpretations of the Standard Model, time is orientable;  that is, the Universe is a big holographic object that extends both directions in time;  for a more readily comprehensible model of this, imagine a cellular automaton such as Conway's Life.  This is normally visualized as a two-dimensional array of cells which can be "full" or "empty", and whose future state depends upon the current state.  Another way of visualizing this is as a three-dimensional stack of sheets of cells, with the stacks above the current sheet being previous iterations and the stacks below the current sheet being future iterations.

The Universe as we see it is a slice of a higher-dimensional object. (Huxley would have loved this.)

But how, you may ask, could we have freedom of action in a cellular automaton?  This comes about in our model because given a particular set of Conway's Life cells, there are many possible configurations that can have led to that set;  it is not possible to determine from the final result which particular configuration was ultimately responsible for the current state.  Since the system is orientable wrt time, the direction of Time's Arrow is relevant only in the choice of rules that are used to generate the ongoing evolution of the system.

Thus a system that is deterministic from the point of view of ascending time may in fact be nondeterministic when viewed from the opposing direction.

Now, to finish this research I will need a massive computer and a really great random number generator...

This formulation of time has a number of problems; in particular, without the passage of time it is unclear how anything happens.  If there is only one moment, NOW, how can there be causality at all?  We may be close to understanding this actually, and the answer I think is revealed in your posting: memory.

You are correct in pointing out that past and future only make sense in the context of a memory of some sort which records events as they happen,  but if you think about it, the entire universe acts as exactly this  sort of memory.  

Consider the proverbial tree falling in the forest.  Even if no one observes its falling, if we later visit the forest we will see a fallen tree.  The act of falling has already happened and is "remembered" by the universe itself in the form of the fallen tree.  Something that the universe "remembers" in this way is in the past even if there is no person to observe its falling.

At one level this whole question of causality is an illusion.  The universe is just one big "thing" that's not really a "thing" by any reasonable definition of the word.  So in some sense the universe just "is" right now.  Nothing can happen, because there's no "thing" for it to happen to.  That's the level of absolute truth, but unfortunately for most of us it is not the level at which we exist, understand, or experience our lives.

The question of the "illusion" of time then is whether this apparent change, novelty, that we experience is simply an illusion or whether the underlying fabric of the universe includes some sort of "motility"; that is, is there is some notion of action or activity inherent in existence?  The answer FWIW appears to be yes.

If you are interested in this sort of stuff, I'd like to recommend delving deep into quantum mechanics; a good text is Penrose's Road to Reality if you have  a strong math background. On the spiritual side, consider Herbert Guenther's seminal three volume set *Kindly Bent to Ease Us* based on the writings of Tibetan scholar Longchenpa.  

>From volume 3:

"Openess and radiance belong to the domain of experience without which they would lose all meaning, as a dynamic process experience is imbued with and becomes structured intentionality.  This very dynamic is tendential (rig-pa) in that it exhibits certain tendancies and dispositions to relate and arrange the content of experience as meant."

Ok its too early in the AM to make sense out of that probably...

Best,

Peter

The future is missing something though. I think what it is missing is called the present.
Everything happens now in the present. The future is just a concept. The transcendental object at the end of time is deceptive. Time is only relative to the person experiencing it.
Memory is a trick. Whoever thinks the future is something that is ahead has been lied to.

Some of us have been too busy creating the future to whine about how much better it was in the past.

Memory is a record of events that have already passed. When you add all the=
 events together you get one giant event. Meaning that no matter how many t=

add all those marks together they still come out to one.=20
=A0
Memory is not real though it is a trick, but if you are remembering music t=
hen memory can take on a different meaning and can be a part of your dreami=
ng state.
=A0
Dreams can be remembered when you wake up but how do you know when you wake=
 up that you are not dreaming and when you sleep that is really being awake=
? Which is awake which is asleep? It is confusing to me which state is the =
real one. Some days can seem like a dream or surreal.

Consciousness is a potent source for novelty and consciousness does not hav=
e as many rules to it as time, dreams, memory, illusions, etc.=20

Consciousness is a huge field ever expanding and unfolding . When you exper=
ience things that you can not call memory, or a dream, that is when you exp=
erience something familiar yet unknown and forgotten but ever present and e=
ternally expanding
That is the mind that is without mind and without body
It is in this state of Consciousness that one see everything as one giant e=
vent.

I agree that there isn't a specific previous state that is recorded in the =
universal memory, but I don't accept that there is no memory.=A0=20

We can know by examining the world that one of a class of previous states h=
as occurred.=A0 And even in the simplified world of Conway's game of life, =
it is not true that any given state can be arrived at from any other previo=
us state.=A0 Therefore, even though the next state only depends on NOW and =
not on any prior state, it is not true that by examining the state of the g=
ame we can learn nothing about its history.=A0 Some information is preserve=
d.=A0 At the very least we can exclude some impossible prior states, i.e. s=
tates from which the current state can not be reached, but in some cases we=
 can actually know the entire history of specific cells.=A0 For example con=
sider the well known=A0 "pulsar" oscillator, http://www.ericweisstein.com/e=
ncyclopedias/life/Pulsar.html.

Reality works the same way perhaps.=A0 For example, we can observe a fallen=
 tree and know that it fell somehow, but the precise manner in which it fel=
l, the precise time of the falling, the exact sound it made, and of course =
the proximate cause of the fall may still elude us.=A0=A0 Nevertheless, the=
 facts that the tree once stood and now has fallen are recorded in the form=
 of the fallen tree as are many other facts of its existence such as its ag=
e, the chemical composition of the soil in which it lived, and much more.On=
e could say that the universe remembers the tree therefore, at least for a =
time, because these facts about the tree seem to be stored in the universe =
itself.=A0=A0=20

Of course the universal memory is also impermanent just as our human memori=
es are.=A0 Eventually the tree will disintegrate, its previous existence wi=
ll become undetectable even to the most precise instruments, and all eviden=
ce of the tree's existence will be lost forever even to the most secure for=
m of memory one could imagine or construct.=A0=20

Feynman would disagree.


It seems that, for at least some interpretations of the Standard Model, tim=
e is orientable; =A0that is, the Universe is a big holographic object that =
extends both directions in time; =A0for a more readily comprehensible model=
 of this, imagine a cellular automaton such as Conway's Life. =A0This is no=
rmally visualized as a two-dimensional array of cells which can be "full" o=
r "empty", and whose future state depends upon the current state. =A0Anothe=
r way of visualizing this is as a three-dimensional stack of sheets of cell=
s, with the stacks above the current sheet being previous iterations and th=
e stacks below the current sheet being future iterations.


The Universe as we see it is a slice of a higher-dimensional object. (Huxle=
y would have loved this.)


But how, you may ask, could we have freedom of action in a cellular automat=
on? =A0This comes about in our model because given a particular set of Conw=
ay's Life cells, there are many possible configurations that can have led t=
o that set; =A0it is not possible to determine from the final result which =
particular configuration was ultimately responsible for the current state. =
=A0Since the system is orientable wrt time, the direction of Time's Arrow i=
s relevant only in the choice of rules that are used to generate the ongoin=
g evolution of the system.


Thus a system that is deterministic from the point of view of ascending tim=
e may in fact be nondeterministic when viewed from the opposing direction.


Now, to finish this research I will need a massive computer and a really gr=
eat random number generator...

If you are interested in this sort of stuff, I'd like to recommend delving =

Ok its too early in the AM to make sense out of that probably...

Paul,

Emaho!  Nice posting!

Some further explorations...

If you have no mind and no body, who and or what is experiencing the state of unity you describe?  Who and or what is freed from the bounds of linear time?

When we are awake we clearly believe that we are having these experiences of the world we call "reality".  Similarly when we dream, we say "I had a dream", although we do not beleive the dream experience is of "reality" but perhaps of some other fictional or non-real place.  

But who experiences the state of unconsciousness that lies between waking and dreaming?  And if it isn't you, then where are you exactly when you are unconscious? 

Consciousness is itself an interesting word.  What is it we mean precisely?  Do we mean simple awareness?  Even an ameoba is aware of its environment and has the ability to respond to changes in the world.  Or do we mean something more like the scientific notion of the self, the Christian concept of a soul or the Hindu atman?  

Is consciousness generated in the brain or is it some sort of "field" that pervades space and which our brains receive like a TV set receiving Oprah?  Yes, Oprah.

Exercise:

Consider what entities in this list you believe might or might not be conscious or said to possess consciousness.  Also consider why you believe the entity is or is not conscious.

1. Another adult person
2. A baby 
3. A fertilized embryo
4. A cat
5. An insect
6. An ameoba
7. A star
8. A planet
9. An extraterrestrial being/alien
10. A rock
11. A tree
12. A fallen tree
13. The Internet
14. An atom
15. The Universe (totality of all being)

How many entities did you dismiss simply because their existence occurs at a different time/space scale than you?  Does it matter if the embryo is fertilized or not?  How could we test whether a rock (or some other entity) possesses consciousness, but just at a very different time scale than we are used to dealing with?  Many people today have difficulty seeing things like rocks or trees as possessing consciousness, but other prior cultures thought all of nature was alive and conscious (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism)  Were they right or wrong?

Another thread...

One might begin to understand consciousness by considering the state of
unconsciousness and what causes it. Stuart Hammeroff (see http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/ and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4y8mTRqXAo) has studied the effects of
anesthesia on the brain and together with Roger Penrose developed a theory of consciousness known as Orch OR.  I think you might find his ideas interesting if you haven't already heard about them, and most recently he has been connecting his work to some of the ideas from Buddhism and other spiritual traditions.

I'll leave you with this from Volume 2 (meditation) of Kindly Bent to Ease Us:

"The main body is about 'pure awareness' encountered 
In the experience of Being by means of 'meditation'
    involving pleasure, radiance, and non-dividedness.
As sheer lucency, a pristine cognitiveness, defying any 
    propositions about it,
It rises in naturalness and togetherness."

As good a description of what happens at a proper "rave" as any I've encountered. ;)

Best,

Peter

My computer has memory and it is used to store information. Mostly I store music which is what is most important to me. I have had CDs and Tapes stolen from me. I had the best collection of music on my computer and it all got erased by accident also. I mean I could do without movies I like movies a lot, but music is really important.
 
Memory is a record of events that have already passed. When you add all the events together you get one giant event. Meaning that no matter how many times you mark this action or mark that action or mark that action when you add all those marks together they still come out to one. 
 
Memory is not real though it is a trick, but if you are remembering music then memory can take on a different meaning and can be a part of your dreaming state.
 
Dreams can be remembered when you wake up but how do you know when you wake up that you are not dreaming and when you sleep that is really being awake? Which is awake which is asleep? It is confusing to me which state is the real one. Some days can seem like a dream or surreal.
 
Consciousness is a potent source for novelty and consciousness does not have as many rules to it as time, dreams, memory, illusions, etc. 

Consciousness is a huge field ever expanding and unfolding . When you experience things that you can not call memory, or a dream, that is when you experience something familiar yet unknown and forgotten but ever present and eternally expanding
That is the mind that is without mind and without body
It is in this state of Consciousness that one see everything as one giant event.
 
Future has already passed and memory was just a trick and one simply is here now

I agree that there isn't a specific previous state that is recorded in the universal memory, but I don't accept that there is no memory.  

We can know by examining the world that one of a class of previous states has occurred.  And even in the simplified world of Conway's game of life, it is not true that any given state can be arrived at from any other previous state.  Therefore, even though the next state only depends on NOW and not on any prior state, it is not true that by examining the state of the game we can learn nothing about its history.  Some information is preserved.  At the very least we can exclude some impossible prior states, i.e. states from which the current state can not be reached, but in some cases we can actually know the entire history of specific cells.  For example consider the well known  "pulsar" oscillator, http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/Pulsar.html.

Reality works the same way perhaps.  For example, we can observe a fallen tree and know that it fell somehow, but the precise manner in which it fell, the precise time of the falling, the exact sound it made, and of course the proximate cause of the fall may still elude us.   Nevertheless, the facts that the tree once stood and now has fallen are recorded in the form of the fallen tree as are many other facts of its existence such as its age, the chemical composition of the soil in which it lived, and much more.One could say that the universe remembers the tree therefore, at least for a time, because these facts about the tree seem to be stored in the universe itself.   

Of course the universal memory is also impermanent just as our human memories are.  Eventually the tree will disintegrate, its previous existence will become undetectable even to the most precise instruments, and all evidence of the tree's existence will be lost forever even to the most secure form of memory one could imagine or construct.  

Best,

Peter

Feynman would disagree.

It seems that, for at least some interpretations of the Standard Model, time is orientable;  that is, the Universe is a big holographic object that extends both directions in time;  for a more readily comprehensible model of this, imagine a cellular automaton such as Conway's Life.  This is normally visualized as a two-dimensional array of cells which can be "full" or "empty", and whose future state depends upon the current state.  Another way of visualizing this is as a three-dimensional stack of sheets of cells, with the stacks above the current sheet being previous iterations and the stacks below the current sheet being future iterations.

The Universe as we see it is a slice of a higher-dimensional object. (Huxley would have loved this.)

But how, you may ask, could we have freedom of action in a cellular automaton?  This comes about in our model because given a particular set of Conway's Life cells, there are many possible configurations that can have led to that set;  it is not possible to determine from the final result which particular configuration was ultimately responsible for the current state.  Since the system is orientable wrt time, the direction of Time's Arrow is relevant only in the choice of rules that are used to generate the ongoing evolution of the system.

Thus a system that is deterministic from the point of view of ascending time may in fact be nondeterministic when viewed from the opposing direction.

Now, to finish this research I will need a massive computer and a really great random number generator...

This formulation of time has a number of problems; in particular, without the passage of time it is unclear how anything happens.  If there is only one moment, NOW, how can there be causality at all?  We may be close to understanding this actually, and the answer I think is revealed in your posting: memory.

You are correct in pointing out that past and future only make sense in the context of a memory of some sort which records events as they happen,  but if you think about it, the entire universe acts as exactly this  sort of memory.  

Consider the proverbial tree falling in the forest.  Even if no one observes its falling, if we later visit the forest we will see a fallen tree.  The act of falling has already happened and is "remembered" by the universe itself in the form of the fallen tree.  Something that the universe "remembers" in this way is in the past even if there is no person to observe its falling.

At one level this whole question of causality is an illusion.  The universe is just one big "thing" that's not really a "thing" by any reasonable definition of the word.  So in some sense the universe just "is" right now.  Nothing can happen, because there's no "thing" for it to happen to.  That's the level of absolute truth, but unfortunately for most of us it is not the level at which we exist, understand, or experience our lives.

The question of the "illusion" of time then is whether this apparent change, novelty, that we experience is simply an illusion or whether the underlying fabric of the universe includes some sort of "motility"; that is, is there is some notion of action or activity inherent in existence?  The answer FWIW appears to be yes.

If you are interested in this sort of stuff, I'd like to recommend delving deep into quantum mechanics; a good text is Penrose's Road to Reality if you have  a strong math background. On the spiritual side, consider Herbert Guenther's seminal three volume set *Kindly Bent to Ease Us* based on the writings of Tibetan scholar Longchenpa.  

>From volume 3:

"Openess and radiance belong to the domain of experience without which they would lose all meaning, as a dynamic process experience is imbued with and becomes structured intentionality.  This very dynamic is tendential (rig-pa) in that it exhibits certain tendancies and dispositions to relate and arrange the content of experience as meant."

Ok its too early in the AM to make sense out of that probably...

Best,

Peter

The future is missing something though. I think what it is missing is called the present.
Everything happens now in the present. The future is just a concept. The transcendental object at the end of time is deceptive. Time is only relative to the person experiencing it.
Memory is a trick. Whoever thinks the future is something that is ahead has been lied to.

The Universe is the computing substrate upon which we are all based;

None.  Existence and consciousness are NOT the same thing.

It wouldn't be an embryo if it were not fertilized.  It'd be a  
gamete.  It goes gamete + gamete -> zygote -> embryo -> foetus -> baby  
-> adult.

We have to take the Murray Gell-Mann approach and define consciousness  
in terms of its invariants.  Consciousness is the ability to perceive  
oneself in terms of one's environment;  to retain information about  
the internal and external state of yourself in relation to that  
environment, and to adapt to act in terms of it.  In other words, all  
consciousnesses must be complex adaptive systems (and therefore, a  
lump of rock does not qualify).

They were wrong.  They also thought the earth was flat and that  
burning sage warded off plague.  Also wrong.

Feed your head, but do it wisely.

About the DJs:

HIPP-E (Denver - Om Records, NRK)

Since making his first paycheck at the age of 16 as a DJ, Hipp-E has
developed into a true innovator on the electronic music scene. His
partnership with Halo as H-Foundation catapulted him into the limelight and
produced the acclaimed 'Environments' album. Now working as a solo artist
once again, Hipp-e travels the globe spreading his sound from the US to Asia
and beyond while continuing to push musical boundaries with his ability to
blend jackin beats into techno horns and even soulful moments - a true
legend.

JENO (Back2Back, Noise From the Void)

After heading to San Francisco in the early 90's, Jeno began the now
legendary 'Full Moon' parties with the infamous Wicked crew. The friendly
vibe and hedonistic atmosphere found at these free outdoor events attracted
a large and diverse crowd of people, setting the tone for the future of the
electronic dance music scene in Northern California. He has now become one
of most loved and sought after dj's in the United States.

M3 (Green Gorilla Lounge, Tweekin')

Raising the volume of the Bay Area.s nightlife since the early 90s, M3 has
proved himself to be an influential character in the development of the
SF/SJ house music scene. Born and raised in San Jose, M3 began his music
career in 1990 promoting some of the original Bay Areas massives such as Get
Down, Get Down, Get Down, The Gathering, and Deep Space. M3's funky fresh
style will, without a doubt, make you move.

ROOZ (djrooz.com, Deep Blue)

Rooz is a DJ, promoter, and major advocate of underground electronic music
in San Francisco, known as one of SF's premier and well respected DJs. With
regular residencies and appearances at San Francisco's top nightclubs since
1999, Rooz has established himself as a fixture in the underground
electronic music scene. In 2008 Rooz was voted #7 DJ in SF on NiteVibe's DJ
Dream Team pole (djdreamteam.com), a short list of SF's dance music pioneers
like Mark Farina, Miguel Migs, Kaskade and Bassnectar.

ANDREW PHELAN & GEORGE COCHRANE (Prismatic, Drop Music)

Andrew Phelan & George Cochrane (aka Origami) have quickly made a name for
themselves in the international house community with their mix of funk and
tech based sounds built around a variety of live instrumentation and vocals,
leading to releases on labels such as Amenti, Body Rhythm, Drop Music,
Eight-Tracks, So Sound and their own label, Prismatic Tracks.

SYD GRIS (Opel, Opulent Temple)

Syd Gris has been called a Renaissance man of the West Coast scene, and with
good reason. Founding Opel Productions, Opulent Temple, and being heavily
involved in SF's Lovefest event are merely the tip of the ice berg; Syd is
one of the West Coast's top talents, consistently being voted in the Top 10
San Francisco Dream Team poll, and playing the biggest events in California.

LITTLE JOHN (Raindance Presents - Santa Cruz)

Little John has had a major impact on the Bay Area dance music underground.
Santa Cruz's best known DJ and event producer, John's Raindance events
consistently bring cutting edge sounds and talent. Expect a diverse set from
a wide array of influences ranging from house to electro to tech to acid to
glitch. Little John regularly rocks some of the best parties around, so
please join us in welcoming him to Alpha Beats!

ERIC SHARP (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Eric Sharp's ascent to the forefront of dance music can only be described as
meteoric. From working countless dance floors into frenzies at clubs, bars,
and parties across the US and the globe to producing some of San Francisco's
most epic parties with his crew (and soon to be music label) Rock It
Science, Eric's seemingly endless energy and dedication to electronic music
is simply contagious.

You are quick to dismiss ideas that seem (to you) to be outside the realm of science.  But today's science was once fiction.  For example, consider the recent developments in creating an actual invisibility cloak.

Not all complex adaptive systems are consciousnesses.  What differentiates consciousness from the rest?  

You say we "have to"  take the Gell-Mann approach to characterizing consciousness, and while I am extremely happy to meet someone that actually knows who Gell-Mann is, I certainly don't agree with that assertion.  Gell-Mann has one theory of consciousness.  His theory remains speculative.  Personally I think this field remains wide open to new ideas, theories, and even experimentation.

Also, you missed my point about time/space scale.  All of the entities except aliens which I listed exist. The point is that some of them exist at very different time/space scales than a person.  Note that the only things which you admit as having consciousness all exist at a similar time/space scale to yourself.  Does consciousness only exist at one particular time/space scale?  Why?

Regards,

Peter

Lemme have a crack at this:

Yes (they appear to be the same as me, and as a phenomenologist I cannot deny that I seem to be conscious;  therefore it is pointless sophism to deny that they probably are)

Yes.  See above.  At a certain point in a baby's existence it becomes aware that it is a separate individual.  It is a complex, adaptive system and therefore it is conscious.

No.  A fertilized embryo does not yet have the ability to change its own internal state in a complex and adaptive way;  therefore it cannot be said to be conscious.  It does not perceive itself.

Yes, but somewhat less so than 1. or 2. above, since the system is capable of obeying fewer states.

No.  An insect is not self-aware;  it is an automaton, and incapable of more than rote learning.  (Note:  I exclude ants and bees from this;  these are a superorganism that may be capable of more sophisticated levels of perception.)

Is one of your epithelial cells conscious?  Don't make me laugh.

No.  A star is a big ball of hydrogen.  It is not conscious.  It does not have any capacity for anything other than thermonuclear fusion.

See 7. above.

I don't know, I've never met one, but for them to get here, I'd have to say yes.

No.  It's a rock.  Unless you make it into a computing device, it's not even close to being able to think.

Plants are automata.

Did it make a sound?  Spooooky.  No, a fallen tree is a *dead* automaton.

The internet is just a machine.  It is not intelligent;  however it does have several of the properties of a gestalt.  To that end, I would argue that the question is meaningless.

Just a blob of wavefunction mass-energy;  not aware.

> 15. The Universe (totality of all being)

The Universe is the computing substrate upon which we are all based;  it itself is not conscious, but it clearly has the properties required for the hosting of consciousness.

> How many entities did you dismiss simply because their existence occurs at a different time/space scale than you?

None.  Existence and consciousness are NOT the same thing.

>  Does it matter if the embryo is fertilized or not?

It wouldn't be an embryo if it were not fertilized.  It'd be a gamete.  It goes gamete + gamete -> zygote -> embryo -> foetus -> baby -> adult.

>  How could we test whether a rock (or some other entity) possesses consciousness, but just at a very different time scale than we are used to dealing with?

We have to take the Murray Gell-Mann approach and define consciousness in terms of its invariants.  Consciousness is the ability to perceive oneself in terms of one's environment;  to retain information about the internal and external state of yourself in relation to that environment, and to adapt to act in terms of it.  In other words, all consciousnesses must be complex adaptive systems (and therefore, a lump of rock does not qualify).

>  Many people today have difficulty seeing things like rocks or trees as possessing consciousness, but other prior cultures thought all of nature was alive and conscious (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism)  Were they right or wrong?

They were wrong.  They also thought the earth was flat and that burning sage warded off plague.  Also wrong.

Feed your head, but do it wisely.

Yes, but we don't get from there to here by just making stuff up;   
theories have to be predictive, and they have to be testable, and  
there has to be evidence that supports them.  You don't go off on a  
mad hypothesis.  You seem to be ready to accept almost anything that  
contradicts the current consensus;  why is that?  are you trying to  
escape from something?

That only works on microscopic scales, in the deep infra-red.  Oh, and  
it needs monochromaticity, too.  So it's not really what they hyped it  
as (and, yes, I'm an optics expert, as it happens.)

Complexity, self-awareness, and the ability to predict the internal  
state of others.

Yeah, like Matt said, I like experimentation too.

On this planet?  No.  Ask a blue whale.

>  Why?

In order for a thing to be conscious it must meet the requirements of  
being a suitable substrate for consciousness.  I do not believe that  
most of the objects you mentioned meet those requirements.

Requirements include the ability to compute, the ability to store  
memories, and the ability to modify behaviour based on those  
memories.  There are (clearly) more, but those are fundamental.

You're sweet, but I think what we have here is a failure to communicate.  

In fact I am a scientist who comes from a family of scientists.  Most recently I was the chief scientist at a company  developing facial recognition and digital forensics technologies among other things.  I'm only interested in ideas that are testable and verifiable. 

Do you think the theory that consciousness emerges from a complex adaptive system meets those criteria?  I don't.  In fact I think the entire term "emergence" is poppycock and mysticism of the worst sort and its use here in trying to fathom the mystery of consciousness only serves to hide most of what we are trying to understand.  And I say that as someone that studied chaos theory, dynamical systems, and complex systems at UCSC during the "Chaos Cabal" era.  Incidentally, Conway's game of life is a great illustration of this.

As far as the scientific consensus, I'll just be blunt.  The consensus is often bullshit.   A lot of what is believed to be scientific truth is just the point of view of the biggest most politically astute assholes and the people that control scientific journals.  Have you heard of Karl Popper?  I'd suggest reading some books on the philosophy and history of science if you are not familiar with this idea.  

In my field there was recently a publication of a short article in the prestigious publication Science by a group from the University of Manchester claiming 100% recognition accuracy from a facial recognition system.  Unfortunately, this claim is entirely bogus as any skilled practitioner in the field could have told the reviewers.  Although they obviously didn't consult the right people before publication, a number of people did write to the magazine and a follow up piece critiquing the original article was published.  But this doesn't always happen. More often the bullshit prevails.  As you yourself said, feed your head but watch what you eat.  And Deepak Chopra isn't the only bullshit out there.

My father is retired now, but he was a biologist doing research in a field that is now called protein transport.  The consensus was that proteins were too large to pass through cell walls.  My father believed that this was incorrect and developed an alternative model.  His views were actively suppressed, his lab denied funding, his career damaged by the keepers of "consensus".  Thing is, it turns out they were wrong.  And in case you think this is just harmless, its pretty clear that people died and diseases went untreated as a result.

As far as the invisibility cloak, everything you said is correct.  But you left out something.  Just ten years ago the consensus was that even this limited notion of invisibility was impossible,  Today the consensus is that it can't be scaled up.  Maybe that's right, but then again maybe its not.  

Your favorite head toy the laser wasn't even invented until the 1950s.  Now it is fundamental to global communication and other applications.  As I understand it, the most likely application for this invisibility thing is not making macroscopic objects invisible but as part of a high speed digital communications system of some sort.  But in 50 years?  Hard to say.

Best,

Yes, but we don't get from there to here by just making stuff up;  theories have to be predictive, and they have to be testable, and there has to be evidence that supports them.  You don't go off on a mad hypothesis.  You seem to be ready to accept almost anything that contradicts the current consensus;  why is that?  are you trying to escape from something?

That only works on microscopic scales, in the deep infra-red.  Oh, and it needs monochromaticity, too.  So it's not really what they hyped it as (and, yes, I'm an optics expert, as it happens.)

Complexity, self-awareness, and the ability to predict the internal state of others.

Yeah, like Matt said, I like experimentation too.

On this planet?  No.  Ask a blue whale.

In order for a thing to be conscious it must meet the requirements of being a suitable substrate for consciousness.  I do not believe that most of the objects you mentioned meet those requirements.

Requirements include the ability to compute, the ability to store memories, and the ability to modify behaviour based on those memories.  There are (clearly) more, but those are fundamental.

It seems like you're saying "science was wrong about a, so therefore  
they must be wrong about b", which doesn't really follow, does it?

especially not in a top-down cosmology approach... we have no origin of the
universe, so we're rather stuck with where we seem to be now, and the
probable paths to having got here... :)
Or did we get past that too?  I'm actually quite out of date on quantum
mechanics, which I was never completely on top of in the first place (in the
classical and not quantum sense)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves and how it used to be and timewave zero


I used to tutor math and physics, and I remember one student on learning about relativity for the first time exclaiming with some consternation, "You mean Newton's equations of motion are WRONG?"

THat was a pretty funny moment, but what I am actually trying to say is simply that science is often wrong about a lot for things.  Being wrong about a lot of things is part of science and the scientific process in fact and therefore we should expect and understand that current scientific understanding is actually wrong about a wqhole lot of things that we simply haven't learned about yet.  This is not a problem.  Science is not God given truth, and the scientific method does not guarantee that one will be able to produce a "correct" model or theory on demand.

A model is proposed and it becomes accepted if it makes useful predictions.  Eventually some experiments are performed that don't fit the existing theories and a new model will be proposed.  Many of these are false leads that will be thrown out, but every once in a while, apparently unpredictably, a new understanding emerges and a new model is established in place of the old.  Contrary to the popular belief, the scientific establishment often doesn not promote this process but instead enforces orthodoxy, favors publication of confirming experiments, and does not actively seek new ground breaking experiments that overturn existing theories and beliefs to promote.  Since this pattern persists, I expect that the resulting falacies persist as well.

In this specific case, the notion that consciousness is an emergent property of a "complex enough" system hides that fact that the notion of emergence itself is actually on pretty shaky scientific ground.  The naive definition of emergence (often stated simply as the whole is greater than the sum of its parts) includes a hidden conscious observer in almost all formulations.  The observer here is the person who designates the emergent pattern is "novel" or interesting (its actually bit more subtle than this but this gets a bit nit picky).  This is why IMO any theory including the idea of emergence can not ever be used to explain consciousness.  Such a theory is inherently circular as you need one to have at least one conscious mind available to designate the emergent patterns comprising another.  

There doesn't appear to be any easy way out of this although Jim Crutchfield has defined a notion called intrinsic emergence without reference to an existing conscious observer.  See Crutchfield's papers, "The Calculi of Emergence: Computation, Dynamics, and Induction" and "Is Anything Ever New?"  However this more limited notion seems to fail to capture many of the things that we mean when we use the term emergence.  Another good and much easier to read article on this is Kevin Mihata's "The Persistence of Emergence".  FWIW.  It has been a few years since I've researched this deeply so there may very well be new results here as well.

What does this all have to do with time wave zero and raves?

The entire issue with emergence reduces to the difficulty in defining what novelty is exactly.  Terrance McKenna in his presentations of the TWZ assumes we all know and agree on what novelty is.  But when you delve into this, it turns out that what exactly we mean by novelty is a philosphically and scientifically thorny issue.  In many cases, what we think of as novel is just a result of our limited perspective and insufficient personal knowledge.

Finally, I note that you can use this stuff to make those trippy cellular automata patterns everyone loves to project at parties.  See also http://www.collidoscope.com/modernca ;)

Peter



Best,

Peter

It seems like you're saying "science was wrong about a, so therefore they must be wrong about b", which doesn't really follow, does it?

especially not in a top-down cosmology approach... we have no origin of the
universe, so we're rather stuck with where we seem to be now, and the
probable paths to having got here... :)
Or did we get past that too?  I'm actually quite out of date on quantum
mechanics, which I was never completely on top of in the first place (in the
classical and not quantum sense)

I'm the second owner. The first set it up in a home theater and
then decided it was too much for his room. He sold it to me after
owning it for a couple of months. I found another set of monitors
after buying it and before I found a second monitor to go with it.

It hasn't had much use.

It comes in its original box with a power cord. Asking $350.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves and how it used to be and timewave zero

being such a McKenna head, I'm inclined to mention his big criticism  
of science in general: "give us one free miracle [the big bang] and  
we'll give you the rest."

I'm the second owner. The first set it up in a home theater and
then decided it was too much for his room. He sold it to me after
owning it for a couple of months. I found another set of monitors
after buying it and before I found a second monitor to go with it.

It hasn't had much use.

It comes in its original box with a power cord. Asking $350.

Now come on... no scientist believes the big bang was a miracle.  Science
doesn't know how to explain it yet, but I think we'll figure it out with
infinite time.

being such a McKenna head, I'm inclined to mention his big criticism of science in general: "give us one free miracle [the big bang] and we'll give you the rest."

I'll take that bet.  

In general there is no guarantee that we'll be able to understand any
particular aspect of the way the world works.  And it is rather
mysterious that mathematics seems to work at all for the purpose of
representing reality in the first place.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences

Furthermore, if some being descended from humans exists at the end of time and actually understands the origins of the universe, I'd guess they'd resemble us even less than we resemble an amoeba.  The idea that "we" will understand the origins of the universe may not really apply here.

Some might argue that the "big bang" refers to a singularity in the equations we use to model universe rather than in the universe itself.  Our equations can be wrong or incomplete.  Remember relativity theory?  It is an extension of Newton's equations of motion.  ANd as always, it is important to remember that it is a model, a theory about how the world works, and not a God given truth.

See the debate with DVDhex which I linked yesterday in which he argues this point in a fairly detailed manner (with references) and also http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/modern-cosmology-science-or-folktale/1 if you are interested in additional details on some of the huge issues with modern cosmology and cosmological models.  

The most notable thing, IMO, is the very small number of independent experiments which are used to estimate the parameters of cosmological models.  I understand that the number is comparable to the number of variables in the models used.  In general this scenario results in "over fitting" of the model and corespondingly bad prediction results.  It is a no no in my world, and I've encountered this issue many times in pattern recognition work when there are not enough samples available to train a classifier properly.  This problem is described in pretty much every text on statistics and regression or any decent machine learning text.   See for example Bishop's  "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" page 7.

Regards,

Peter

Ok I'll bet you a beer that we'll figure out how the universe came into

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: The laws of physics promote the development of complex self-organizing structures...


This was in my inbox today regarding a new t-shirt from teh Imaginary Foundattion aka Nick Philip.

"The laws of physics promote the development of complex self-organizing
structures. Given the right conditions, life just emerges. It's quite
possible that we inhabit a universe with the potential for far more
complex levels of self organization to develop. It's the interaction of
the parts that is key. So Major Tom, time to bust out your watering can."

If the earth was about to be destroyed by some dark evil entity that wanted=
 to suck that life force from the planet and there was nothing anyone could=
 do about it how would we escape?
=A0
Should we use a starship with hypergate abilities to jump through a wormhol=
e and move to another part of the universe and look for another planet that=
 can support life?=20

I saw the new new Star Trek movie and they escaped a huge black hole by eng=
aging their warp drives and then ejecting their core into the singularity=
=A0to create a shockwave that would propell them forward away from the sing=
ularity and into=A0their self created=A0wormhole=A0while the blackhole/sing=
ularity was sucking in everything possible, the enemy ship, a planet, and t=
he enterprise.=20
=A0
Yeah i know its a movie and its science fiction but it is all based on theo=
retical concepts that seem to fascinate me because they are novelty.
=A0
What if there was a singularity threatening my home? How would I escape it?
Worm holes=A0can not be sustained long enough=A0for a ship to pass through.=
=A0In order to hold a worm hole open=A0one would need something called exot=
ic matter or a=A0hyperdrive.
A star ship with a hyperdrive can travel faster than the speed of light (FT=
L) and would move ahead through time rather than backwards through the blac=
k hole singularity.
=A0
1. Engage hyperdrive engines on your starship
2. Create a worm hole or hypergate with two points one for entry and anothe=
r for exit.
3. Eject or Drop the core into the singularity or black hole (this will cre=
ate a shock wave that will push the ship into the hypergate or worm hole ev=
en though the singluarity has such intense gravitational mass that it is co=
nsuming everything close enough to get caugh in its orbit.)
4. Exit the hypergate at the marked exit point.
=A0
An alternative would be to find a way to close the singularity but not sure=
 how that would work.
=A0
Any thoughts or comments on this? Any other suggestions for escapeing a sin=
gularity or black hole? This is all theoretical of course and has no basis =
in reality. Still hella interested in how other people percieve time and sp=
ace.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Scientists Discover "Consciousness Siganture" that Spans the Brain


For the sfraves psychonauts and other explorers of consciousness...

Did you see the article in New Scientist from March describing research on people with epilepsy which shows consciousness exists a field of activity pervading the entire brain?  Not that this wasn't already clear to some people, but it is an important confirmatory result.


"Electrodes implanted in the brains of people with epilepsy might have resolved an ancient question about consciousness.

Signals
from the electrodes seem to show that consciousness arises from the
coordinated activity of the entire brain. The signals also take us
closer to finding an objective "consciousness signature" that could be used to probe the process in animals and people with brain damage without inserting electrodes.

Previously
it wasn't clear whether a dedicated brain area, or "seat of
consciousness", was responsible for guiding our subjective view of the
world, or whether consciousness was the result of concerted activity
across the whole brain."
From: http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16775-consciousness-signature-discovered-spanning-the-brain.html

The source paper: http://assets0.pubget.com/pdf/19296722.pdf

See also: http://consc.net/papers/ncc.pdf for some background on "Neural Correlates of Consciousness" and http://cogprints.org/228/ for an important critical observation about what is being measured here.

I need a mixer with as many channels as I can get (within reason.... 12
should be enough) for a bedroom studio.  An old Mackie would be perfect.
Lemme know!

i liked this one about animal intelligence a whole bunch from national

it confirms alot of beliefs we've all suspected about animal

killer crowd that goes berzerk on the dance floor, and building a party that
goes way beyond one night, Rock It Science and Prismatic invite you to

honors the floor quaking and booty shaking Bass that moves us night after
night!

About the DJs:

HIPP-E (Denver - Om Records, NRK)

Since making his first paycheck at the age of 16 as a DJ, Hipp-E has
developed into a true innovator on the electronic music scene. His
partnership with Halo as H-Foundation catapulted him into the limelight and
produced the acclaimed 'Environments' album. Now working as a solo artist
once again, Hipp-e travels the globe spreading his sound from the US to Asia
and beyond while continuing to push musical boundaries with his ability to
blend jackin beats into techno horns and even soulful moments - a true
legend.

JENO (Back2Back, Noise From the Void)

After heading to San Francisco in the early 90's, Jeno began the now
legendary 'Full Moon' parties with the infamous Wicked crew. The friendly
vibe and hedonistic atmosphere found at these free outdoor events attracted
a large and diverse crowd of people, setting the tone for the future of the
electronic dance music scene in Northern California. He has now become one
of most loved and sought after dj's in the United States.

M3 (Green Gorilla Lounge, Tweekin')

Raising the volume of the Bay Area.s nightlife since the early 90s, M3 has
proved himself to be an influential character in the development of the
SF/SJ house music scene. Born and raised in San Jose, M3 began his music
career in 1990 promoting some of the original Bay Areas massives such as Get
Down, Get Down, Get Down, The Gathering, and Deep Space. M3's funky fresh
style will, without a doubt, make you move.

ROOZ (djrooz.com, Deep Blue)

Rooz is a DJ, promoter, and major advocate of underground electronic music
in San Francisco, known as one of SF's premier and well respected DJs. With
regular residencies and appearances at San Francisco's top nightclubs since
1999, Rooz has established himself as a fixture in the underground
electronic music scene. In 2008 Rooz was voted #7 DJ in SF on NiteVibe's DJ
Dream Team pole (djdreamteam.com), a short list of SF's dance music pioneers
like Mark Farina, Miguel Migs, Kaskade and Bassnectar.

ANDREW PHELAN & GEORGE COCHRANE (Prismatic, Drop Music)

Andrew Phelan & George Cochrane (aka Origami) have quickly made a name for
themselves in the international house community with their mix of funk and
tech based sounds built around a variety of live instrumentation and vocals,
leading to releases on labels such as Amenti, Body Rhythm, Drop Music,
Eight-Tracks, So Sound and their own label, Prismatic Tracks.

SYD GRIS (Opel, Opulent Temple)

Syd Gris has been called a Renaissance man of the West Coast scene, and with
good reason. Founding Opel Productions, Opulent Temple, and being heavily
involved in SF's Lovefest event are merely the tip of the ice berg; Syd is
one of the West Coast's top talents, consistently being voted in the Top 10
San Francisco Dream Team poll, and playing the biggest events in California.

LITTLE JOHN (Raindance Presents - Santa Cruz)

Little John has had a major impact on the Bay Area dance music underground.
Santa Cruz's best known DJ and event producer, John's Raindance events
consistently bring cutting edge sounds and talent. Expect a diverse set from
a wide array of influences ranging from house to electro to tech to acid to
glitch. Little John regularly rocks some of the best parties around, so
please join us in welcoming him to Alpha Beats!

ERIC SHARP (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Eric Sharp's ascent to the forefront of dance music can only be described as
meteoric. From working countless dance floors into frenzies at clubs, bars,
and parties across the US and the globe to producing some of San Francisco's
most epic parties with his crew (and soon to be music label) Rock It
Science, Eric's seemingly endless energy and dedication to electronic music
is simply contagious.

Oh, and speaking of, one thing that frustrated me long enough for me
to give up on it was the ability to easily generate (programmatically)
links to a given song, or artist within iTunes (or beatport for that
matter.)  Anyone have a good solution?

You can look up the track/CD using CDDB and then use the Applescript  
port on iTunes
to extract this info.  There's a developer note to that effect IIRC.

i liked this one about animal intelligence a whole bunch from national 
geographic.
http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/03/animal-minds/virginia-morell-text

it confirms alot of beliefs we've all suspected about animal 
intelligence since we were kids. your article on consciousness reminded 
me of it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Abelton Live frees your time up to do SO much more


As much salty "what a douche" commentage as this is going to generate, that's a really cool idea, and it does often take an "industry leader" like Ritchie to make such things happen.  The fact that it's being tied in to maybe actually getting some musicians paid is HUGE.  

Twitter is getting some hate now because it's getting so big and most people don't "get it", but at this point it's the only social network worth keeping up with, imho.  It's infinitely extensible to do whatever you want, with just a few #s and @s, expressly because its own feature set is so basic and, well, pure.

Twitter = Fun and awesome

Facebook, Myspace, Bebo, etc = Headachey waste of time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Abelton Live frees your time up to do SO much more

actually this was what the cube thingy that richie hawtin had at his 
minus tour. it put out a signal so your iphone could pick up the 
tracklisting with an app he had available for download at the minus 
site. cheeky marketing bastard.

also i've seen ads years ago for cellphone apps that help you ID a track 
by pressing the microphone up to a speaker. then you can DL the track 
once you ID'd it. think this has been available in the UK for almost a 
decade.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Abelton Live frees your time up to do SO much more


This is one of the things I was trying to do back at Live365 long before Apple shipped its first iPod.  Unfortunately the MP3 players around at the time couldn't hold an entire full length mix.  Anyone remember the controversial Rio?  I had a Casio MP3 playing watch which held about 5-7 songs.

Best,

Peter

actually this was what the cube thingy that richie hawtin had at his 
minus tour. it put out a signal so your iphone could pick up the 
tracklisting with an app he had available for download at the minus 
site. cheeky marketing bastard.

also i've seen ads years ago for cellphone apps that help you ID a track 
by pressing the microphone up to a speaker. then you can DL the track 
once you ID'd it. think this has been available in the UK for almost a 
decade.

Just imagine nascent rave days now...

"Ok, so you're going to have to hit up "RaveFace92" on Gchat and say 'I gotta mudbutt uhhh' to get the hash tag you need for us to get you the deets- then tweet "HAtcha HATCHA WOOTLE PIE #(the secret hashtag)" and we'll DM you the MP loc.  Don't forget to send me a lily on Lil' Green Patch first, or you'll only be led astray..."

No.  Twitter is a vector for malware and mind viruses.   Remember when it used to be a bad idea to click on random links people emailed you?  Clicking on random links people post is the entire point of Twitter at some level.

Twitter was built without regard to security as evidenced by the hack in which a brute force attack was employed to crack a Twitter employee's password.  Hint: "happiness" is a weak password and its not typical for a human tro try multiple thousands of passwords to access their account.  But there are worse problems lurking in the platform as it exists right now.

The recent plague of "don't click" style attacks on Twitter is just a hint at what is coming...a large scale distribution of malware via Twitter.  Already a number of phishing attacks have been distributed on Twitter, Facebook , and other social media sites for example disguised as those stupid quizes.  And if you remember the recent "25 random thiings about me" fad on Facebook, you might be curious to learn that no one knows who started that or why.  Ther ecent 4chan incursion into YouTube included a toxic malware payload in addition to porn images.

Don't say you weren't warned!

Errrrr unlikely.  Maybe if you browse the web with IE, which is like fucking
a prostitute with a 10 year old condom that you've punched holes in.  The
worst that might happen is some cross site scripting or request forgery.
 You're not going to get a virus from clicking a link on twitter.  If you
are dumb enough to open an executable from the internet that you didn't
expect or md5sum... well you're stupid.

Sure only stupid people.

Now take all the stupid people in the world, connect them together in real-time, and you get things like millions of people clicking a link preceded by text that says "do not click" over the course of a few hours because, well, no one I talked to actually could explain exactly why they clicked it.  But they did.

No offense, but the attack I describe is not only technically feasible, it has already been executed on Twitter in a small number of cases.  The attack was detected by security researchers and it is real.   I don't actually know if the a large scale attack via Twitter will ever occur or not, but one has to assume that a practice run is practice for something.  


Best,

Peter

i got that note... hello 2day, I was sooo fuckin' giddy.. LoL.. but =20
like Rey's phone wouldn't let me text his UK # on his phone... luckily =20
Ms Haze let me text on hers & he texted back & big bro told me where =20

this other hella tall dude like stood up to shake my hand...

"Osby, this is Scott," Briskie introed us & we shook hands.  Then I =20
looked @ Scott's face & he has like this kinda long hair in a pony =20
tail & I hella wondered "What the fuck man.. wait"!!!

"Hey Scott!!  Nice to meet ya dude!! Ummm... so like what's your last =20
name, if you don't mind me asking?" I asked him 'cause I just had this =20

hella fuckni' bust up laughing my ass off.. I mean.. I told him =20
eventually at some pint that lil story why i was LOLing so hard & =20
shit... but yeah...

It was just hella trippy too man 'cause I mean... I didn't expect to =20
like get bombarded by a fuckin' happy hardcore DJ convention in the =20
City that night... Briskie said that he was with some Homies & I =20
thought he meant like fucikin' out mutual SF Bay area local Homies... =20
so like it just took a while for everything to sink in that it was =20
actually happening & my body was still kinda like feeling like it was =20
still on the muni...

After a few drinks, hella laughs, I relaxed & ok.. Hello 2day... =20

wait for BART to open at 4AM then cut out.. until then, we were gonna =20
finish the vodka in his room, so he don't gotta dump it all away =20
before he leaves Wed Afternoon...

"OK, I could have two drinks I guess & just be kinda swervin' when i'm =20

I mean.. I drink when I do.. people don't think I do, but I do!!  So =20
like if it's a yummy sweet drink, of course I'm all over it!!!  =20

"Morning Osby", Briskie greeted me in a kinda soft but deep morning =20
voice grumble.

"Hey Big Bro!  Dude, what the fuck happened to me man? How'd I end up =20
in your bed man?" I asked back in the same tone his voice was.

"You got pissed the fuck up mate! You were proper mashed Dude! You =20

said.

"Well, I best leave now then man." I said while I slowly tried to get =20
up. "I need to get hooooooooome or else..."

"Naw man, just fuckin' Relax Osby," he said as he put his hand on my =20

a knock on the door.  Briskie made me answer it LoL &  I was all =20
wearing like my shirt & boxers.  It was Kristie & she was all =20
surprised to see me... I guess B didn't tell her I was there still...

"Osby, what the fuck are you doing here?" she asked me while she hella =20
started giggline.

"I'm hung the fuck over & Big Bro was takin' are of me, makin' sure i =20
didn't do anything stupid I guess!" i said.

"Mmmmmhmmmm, ok! Then why's it smell like Red Bull & Sex in here =20

laughing, walking into the room.

"Oh shut the fuck up Kristie!" B yelled back , hella laughing!  =20
Kristie jumped in bed & gave big bro a hug.  Then I jumped in bed & =20
hugged Kristie.  We all just stayed in bed together like & just talked =20
for like 1/2 an hour or something.

B got ready while me & Kristie stayed in bed still talking... an hour =20
later, after B had all shit packed & we did a final check to see if we =20
left anything in the room, we were downstairs checcking out.  When we =20
got outside, we all gave each other goodbbye hugs.. Kristie had to get =20
back to work & I hella had to get home.  I hugged Briskie bye then =20
started walkin' away then felt this hella hard tug on my back pack.

"Oh no Osby, you're comin' with me to the airport Mate!  You promised =20
me lastnight since no one was driving me & you said you could!" he said.

"I did?" I hella wondered outloud, hella confuzed!  "I have no idea =20
what the fuck you're talkin' about B!!!"

"Yeh Osby, you did! Now help me get a cab!" he said as he grabbed my =20
back pack again & lead me to the parked cabs.

LoL.. yeah.. it was kinda trippy 'cause I mean.. this was the 1st time =20
like I've extended my goodbye to big bro whenever he was in town... I =20
actually made him call my Mom on his phone to tell her where I was so =20
I wouldn't get yelled at for coming home 9 hours later than planned... =20

whenever he's in town 'cause My Mom Loves Him!  LoL... He explained to =20
her how he was takin' care of me 'cause I was drunk yada yada yada... =20

Next thing i know, it's like 11AM & I'm waking up in Big Bro's bed, I look over & he's there!  Hello 2day, I guess i didn't make the 4:17AM Pittsburg/ Antioch bart train... lol... ok.. my head was sooooooooooo fucki'n throbing, I couldn't really move it 'cause seriously, any  movement gave me this mondo hardcore motion sickness... lol... but i was just soo confuzed!

"Morning Osby", Briskie greeted me in a kinda soft but deep morning voice grumble.

"Hey Big Bro!  Dude, what the fuck happened to me man? How'd I end up in your bed man?" I asked back in the same tone his voice was.

"You got pissed the fuck up mate! You were proper mashed Dude! You wasn't gonna leave all fucked up like that on them trains & buses!" he said.

"Well, I best leave now then man." I said while I slowly tried to get up. "I need to get hooooooooome or else..."

"Naw man, just fuckin' Relax Osby," he said as he put his hand on my shoulder & gentley pulled down so I was lying down again. "You probably feel as fucked up as I do man, you fuckin' light weight! Just fuckin' lie down & relax! Kristie's comiong here at 12, so hang back dude!"

Well.. he was right!  I could barely sit up in bed w/o my head feeling like it was gonna unscrew itself from my neck... so we just chilled in bed talking and like catching up with each other aobut everything!  LoL.. it was hella funny, when the clock exactly hit 11:59, there was a knock on the door.  Briskie made me answer it LoL &  I was all wearing like my shirt & boxers.  It was Kristie & she was all surprised to see me... I guess B didn't tell her I was there still...

"Osby, what the fuck are you doing here?" she asked me while she hella started giggline.

"I'm hung the fuck over & Big Bro was takin' are of me, makin' sure i didn't do anything stupid I guess!" i said.

"Mmmmmhmmmm, ok! Then why's it smell like Red Bull & Sex in here then?" she asked in a funny sarcastic loud way while she was hella laughing, walking into the room.

"Oh shut the fuck up Kristie!" B yelled back , hella laughing!  Kristie jumped in bed & gave big bro a hug.  Then I jumped in bed & hugged Kristie.  We all just stayed in bed together like & just talked for like 1/2 an hour or something.

B got ready while me & Kristie stayed in bed still talking... an hour later, after B had all shit packed & we did a final check to see if we left anything in the room, we were downstairs checcking out.  When we got outside, we all gave each other goodbbye hugs.. Kristie had to get back to work & I hella had to get home.  I hugged Briskie bye then started walkin' away then felt this hella hard tug on my back pack.

"Oh no Osby, you're comin' with me to the airport Mate!  You promised me lastnight since no one was driving me & you said you could!" he said.

"I did?" I hella wondered outloud, hella confuzed!  "I have no idea what the fuck you're talkin' about B!!!"

"Yeh Osby, you did! Now help me get a cab!" he said as he grabbed my back pack again & lead me to the parked cabs.

LoL.. yeah.. it was kinda trippy 'cause I mean.. this was the 1st time like I've extended my goodbye to big bro whenever he was in town... I actually made him call my Mom on his phone to tell her where I was so I wouldn't get yelled at for coming home 9 hours later than planned... LoL.. oh shit, yeah man, i just realized I make him call my Mom whenever he's in town 'cause My Mom Loves Him!  LoL... He explained to her how he was takin' care of me 'cause I was drunk yada yada yada... so yeah, lol, funny shit!

20 minutes later, we were @ the airport & basically spent the next 3 hours talkin' to tourist, eating, smokin' cigs, talkin' to the flight attendants
who were goin' on their flights... lol.. yeah, it was So Dope just spending more time with bog bro... but man.. fuckni' when I walked him to his gate & we had our goodbye hugs & final chats... it was all fuckin' bittersweet & shit man 'cause grrr... I Hella Love my Big Bro... & it was sad & I seriously had mondo wateroworks building up in my eyes... then I saw him off walking through security check!!!

We actually talked  about meetin up in Austin Texas next month 'cause my Homie Brian's throwing a big ass candy party & he's spinning... so we're gonna ask Brian to fly me out there too!!!  LoL

The public transportation journey home was easy, but looooooooong.. I ain't rode bart from South city in heeeeeella daze, but yeah... I kinda felt funky 'cause I was like hardcore doin' the dirty raver from yesterday travel... but yeah... YAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!  LoL... I finally got home around 6PM & Hello 2day, i was still hungover! LOLOLMAO

Good times!!! :)


Peace=->
Just Me=->
Osby {8O)

Ok, like everyone else probably I am thinking this idea of "closing" state parks is really dumb.  But then I thought, could this be the best thing to ever happen to the outdoor party scene in California?

Discuss.

Ah.  Guess I missed the cancellation email.   Well, where's everyone else
going?  I'm already in SF for the day, a way to pass the time later this
afternoon/evening at least would be nice... Guess I can go catch Hipp-E,
Andrew, Eric, Syd (again, just caught him last night...) and the rest at
paradise...

would depend if entry/booking fees end up pricing them out of our range for
permitted events, and how hard it is for them to spot large groups doing
renegades, no?

Who would do the spotting? The unemployed former rangers?  I think you might be able to get away with some smaller events at least.

I hadn't considered that the state might try to charge use fees even when they would provide no services or maintenance of the park.  But you are right, they might try to do this.

would depend if entry/booking fees end up pricing them out of our range for permitted events, and how hard it is for them to spot large groups doing renegades, no?

Well my thinking is that they'd lay off most of them, but keep some rangers
to do patrols (since they still need to watch for wildfires and such) over
much larger areas. (The original use of "ranger" as a title was due to the
long range distances covered)  Even if this happens, it might well be that
they could be observed to miss areas for days or weeks at a time in a
predictable pattern, opening the door to opportunistic use, or it could mean
that a given spot has a random chance of being caught on a given day.
The use fees might be a way for the parks to stay open, by generating
revenues that way, so they could keep some more parks open.   The point is
to reduce the spending, so if they make more money on fees, they don't have
to cut as much.  We might also see the most popular areas raise fees in an
effort to save some of the others, depending on political pressure, though
the "logical" economic process would be to try and make each park
self-sustaining: raise fees to that needed to cover if the fees are paid; if
people pay them, the park stays open, if they won't, that park gets closed,
repeat process from the biggest money losers to the ones closest to making
money as needed to handle the budget limits

So depending, it could work out very well for the campers, or very badly.
 Rather like the effects of the economic downturn in general, the medium
severity leaves the most room to have lots of unpleasant effects and few
benefits.  (In a larger context, rapid and total economic collapse means
people simply start over with primitive barter economy and such, and take
care of each other again, while a slower-slide means more people getting
caught out while others try to hang onto their own comforts, so many more
people are hurt before things start over)

Subject: [sfraves] Sat Review: What a trip!

So, I'm at Alpha Beats @ Paradise Lounge last night, and I 
randomly (and separately) run into and get to hang out with 
Martin O'Brien from the Gathering and Vlad (Feel Good), 
Vlad was running something with the party loft across the 
street, I think.

This is what's Martin's up to:

Wow. Flashback.

p.s. Alpha Beats (and Pulse....and Skills etd.POP last weekend, 
were fun too)

Good seeing some of you there :-)
