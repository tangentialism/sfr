Subject: RE: [sfraves] TO  HAPPYCORE HATERS

I find it funny for a scene that prides itself on acceptance of all types
that people would be so against one type of music.  My nephew likes ice
cream just like I do.  Does that make me a child?  Do I need to "leave never
never land behind"?  No, it means that there are things in this world that
some people like and some people don't.  Those of us who can claim to be
somewhat mature can recognise these differences and move on.  Those of us
who can't will stick around and argue until we are blue in the face about
how my dad can beat up your dad.

I love happycore.  It makes me want to dance and move.  It brings a smile to
my face.  I need a break sometimes from D&B and House and Trance.  I am over
21 and I maintain a stable job in a large company.  I pay my own bills.  I
totally support myself.  I live 1700mi away from mommy and daddy.  Don't
tell me that because I like a certain music, I need to grow up.

If you don't like it, don't listen to it.  There is always another room.
And if there isn't, that's your fault for choosing to go to a party you
shouldn't be at.

Just my two cents,
Jaden

Wasn't that room the only room that wasn't on the ice and you could actually
dance in? Defending happy plur core is losing battle. It does have a place
and it does serve a purpose I suppose - it draws off all the little kids
that aren't ready to grow up and leave never never land behind. Actually the
little girl that my gf babysits loves this mindless noise. She's 5?? That's
right a FIVE year old can relate to HHC. Says a lot...

Don't forget next weekend... the premier of our own UK Hard House, Trance

The venue has got to be one of the best clubs that SF currently has to
offer.  Very nice, and there will be a custom J/K sound system to bump the

Ryan, I have to say I'm glad I know you in person already, because if I just 
sat around and read your emails I would think you were a very bitter, 
unhappy person. Just some food for thought.

I LOVE HAPPY CORE....but you know what? I also love disco house, Drum and 
Bass, foo foo trance, hard trance, hard house, Gabber,  NRG, classical, rock, 
hip-hop, and contemperary music. And while I'm sure you can all think of 
horrible examples of most of these Genres. There are lots of good ones as 
well. So while some of it may be inane, YOU CANT SAY ALL HAPPYCORE IS BAD. 
And if you do  you don't sound smart and "too good for HC." You just sound 
ignorant and stupid. So I hope this puts an end to this debate....cause you 
can say happycore is all bad....but its not, and your wrong....PERIOD

I thought that too.... but... then I looked again..... and I recall, when 
they played 
liev in Chicago that Guy Manuel is considerably shorter than Thomas Bangalter.
The tow guys in the commercial were relatively the same size.  I don't think 
it was
them.  But, i could be wrong.

Amen brother.

I'm known as a "junglist" to most people, but if it wasn't for cheesy trance,
cheesy breaks, and happy hardcore I'd have never found the rave scene in the
first place..

Well that and orbital..

I had more fun dancing to HHC last friday than I've had @ any party in months,
if you can't handle hardcore then don't go to those clubs.

BTW, what's a guy gotta do to get some non-happy hardcore around here?  My
friend is an EXCELLENT DJ but because he spins dark/hip hop hardcore he never
gets any gigs at all..  Where's the love?

I find it funny for a scene that prides itself on acceptance of all types
that people would be so against one type of music.  My nephew likes ice
cream just like I do.  Does that make me a child?  Do I need to "leave never
never land behind"?  No, it means that there are things in this world that
some people like and some people don't.  Those of us who can claim to be
somewhat mature can recognise these differences and move on.  Those of us
who can't will stick around and argue until we are blue in the face about
how my dad can beat up your dad.

I love happycore.  It makes me want to dance and move.  It brings a smile to
my face.  I need a break sometimes from D&B and House and Trance.  I am over
21 and I maintain a stable job in a large company.  I pay my own bills.  I
totally support myself.  I live 1700mi away from mommy and daddy.  Don't
tell me that because I like a certain music, I need to grow up.

If you don't like it, don't listen to it.  There is always another room.
And if there isn't, that's your fault for choosing to go to a party you
shouldn't be at.

Just my two cents,
Jaden

Subject: Re: [sfraves] **Cool stuff on Saturday, Aug 24th/ 25th???

There's no infoline. I heard AEC's working a deal w/ Sony Pictures Classic.

My sister's cousin who works at Baskin Robbins said that they got a 
movie-filming permit, and that's how they're funding the free party.

DJ DAN is going to be there. It's kind of like  a sequel to Groove, 
open-casting is closed, but they're letting the party info leak to 
get a few free extras.

Well, See ya at AEC, if this thing is for reals....

whoa there buddy, now you wanna knock perhaps the greatest folk singer on the 
planet besides Dylan?!  To even compare an artist such as Willie Nelson-a man 
cool enough to smoke a jay on the rotunda of the White House-with the shit 
you pose as music, this crappy crapcore stuff, doesn't do a hardworking 
citizen justice!  Leave Willie Nelson Alone!  If you are going to talk smack, 
try to at least find people with literally no talent to mock!!!  Like crappy 
crapcore "artists," performance numbskulls, and Richard Glass.

No luv to you, Willie hater

Subject: Re: [sfraves] **Cool stuff on Saturday, Aug 24th/ 25th???

I've been talking to my neighbor who is part of the neighborhood watch in my
area, and I guess DJ Ham One was yelling and screaming (before they beat him
to the ground) about this party a few days ago I can't wait to hear Ham-one
make his first east bay appearance after that year in the mountains of
Chile. HamOne vs. DJ DAN is a match I wouldn't wanna miss. If this thing
goes down, I'll be there for sure. The only thing that could keep me from
going is a court ordered injunction. And even then who knows?

AEC Party, yum yum yum =)

All right people, it's that time again for another fabulizz day in the sun
with us. Bring tons of blankets to rest on, lots of water to share, and
don't forget to wear something comfortable to shake yo booty in! For those
boozers out there you need to bring plastic cups to drink out of or Mr. Park
Ranger will give you a fat (no ph!) ticket. This looks to be our last day
party of the summer so don't miss out!

 No disrespect Becca, but how does that make someone bitter?  Because they realize what quality music is?  And HHC isn't.  In my opinion it isn't even music.  Its like some weird kids TV show from Canada, makes no sense and sounds weird.  Can you really dance to it?  I have watched people try to and it doesn't look like dancing.  I think it is like people trying to be 5 again or soemthing.

Ryan, I have to say I'm glad I know you in person already, because if I just 
sat around and read your emails I would think you were a very bitter, 
unhappy person. Just some food for thought.

You can talk to him at the day party this weekend - I'm sure he'd be more
than happy to stop using his years-old nickname because a friend of yours
also happens to share it.

But first, goooo tooo the daaay partyyy everyyyooonnneee... details below.

Wow, whoever did not show up last night missed out on
a fun party.  it was great seeing everyone in
costumes.
Paul was in a straight jacket, Zeb in a corset and
tutu, Thora was in bubble wrap, Adam looked like a
cross bead of david bowie and billy idol, Zach had
this full on girl thing going on and paltforms.  I was
pretty normal considering what every one eles was
wearing.  And the club was great. The decorations
where awesome the green woman at the end of the bar. 
Thora did a great job on the giant dream catcher and
the chandeliar(sp) made out of CD's was nice touch.
and down stiars, I love the hallway down stairs.
It was such a family thing last night though. Very
intimate.  
Well i hope to see some of you guys out there on the
30th for another freqalicious night.
Until then....
Jamie Star

Subject: [sfraves] my point...was Too Mych Haterism...

Alrgiht...i kinda figured id strike a chord with thta one but here is the 
underlying reason for this.   I was being intentionally facetious.  However 
i was kinda looking for a reaction from some of the hater of happycore who 
like willie.  Either that or this is simply some sorta damage control to 
making a stupid post. I can on occasion be wrong BUt at least i can admit 
it.

heres the thing.  truely musical preference is simply a matter of personal 
taste and the ability to appreciate a wide variety different sounds.  What 
sounds good to one person may not sound so great to another. DUH! BUT...no 
one type of music, which is a form of art, is any better of worse than any 
other.  a persons artistic expression of thought and form, by it's nature, 
cannot be good or bad or right or wrong, better or worse.  Those kinds of 
descriptions are relative, and are often defined by societal influences.  
FOR the majority of persons who do not know who they are themselves, and are 
not in touch wiht their true feelings, societal influences (such as the 
"opinions of friends they dont want to alienate," "because i want to impress 
a chick," "because i dont want so and so to think im lame" become one's 
opinion.

now, i listen to happycore, trance, jungle, country, rock, metal, oldies, 
classic rock, classical, and i spin french house.  i like what i listen to 
because it accentuates the differences in style.  I like the depth and 
emotion in classical and its new age counterpart trance.  i like the eagles 
and metalica.  i like sarah evans, regardless of what the passengers in my 
car say about it (thats whats good about being the driver).

im getting ot a point here soon i promise...

I think that most people who hate on a particular genre of music only do it 
for one reason.  I think that when a person says they hate something its 
really that deep down inside they like it, and are embarrased to say so.
too worried about one's own reputaion to know what they enjoy.

okay ill stop rambling now.  oh and if you dont like what i have to say, 
dont bother reading my posts. they're all like this, out of habit i like to 
play devils advocate.

..oo00--LoOnDrOp--00oo..

Ecstasy Saves The World
Pot, MDMA, and too damn many happy people

By Mark Morford, SF Gate Columnist <mailto:mmorford@sfgate.com>

Wednesday, August 15, 2001
  _____


What would be really just randomly fabulous is if the UC Santa Barbara would
suddenly buck the trend and find some progressive moral fiber and discover a
sudden impulse of commonsense justice and just up and decide to go to court
and defend its recently arrested pot-growin' professor.
You know, that religious-studies prof and her husband who were recently
busted for growing upwards of 58 pot plants in their home
<http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2001/08/12/state1813EDT0075.DT
L>  and are accused of, well, growing 58 pot plants in their home that you
can potentially dry and smoke and then feel all funny and warm afterwards,
similar to alcohol but not nearly as dangerous or addictive or famously
violence-provoking but which for some reason is still illegal.
And wouldn't it be wondrous indeed if institutions like UCSB would begin to
disregard what I imagine must be a relatively antediluvian policy regarding
employees caught with benign herbs, a policy which I'm sure forces them to
issue a reprimand and an official statement and a disapproving scowl, and
instead bail out the professor and openly declare to all the world that pot
busts like this one are ridiculous and pointless and arbitrary and
ultimately insulting?
Thus reinforcing what most of us already know: That while marijuana ain't
exactly health food, no one but the most uninformed or panicky anti-drug
zealot actually thinks it's genuinely dangerous to the public at large
anymore, really, especially in harmless gilded little towns like Santa
Barbara, especially not when compared with the demons of alcohol or
television or unchecked Republicanism.
Maybe this is what is required. Maybe our public institutions need to modify
their drugs policies, forward-thinking corporations come right out and say
they don't mind what employees do in their spare time, will in fact defend
them, or at least quit with the Puritanical puling and the drug testing
<http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/08/1
2/CM163746.DTL>  and the faux-concern, everyone finally acknowledging that
most drug policies are merely shallow maneuvers designed to make the powers
that be look honest and virtuous and deeply concerned when in fact they're
mostly just posturing for the cameras and the polls and the shareholders,
and/or trying to force everyone to conform to certain behavioral norms
because otherwise those kids are just too damn scary what with all the
dancing and the sex and the crazy smiling and the non-violence.
And while we're indulging utopian dreams, what if our goodly scientists and
psychologists and politicians and even casual users were allowed to give
honest accounts of, say, Ecstasy and its real effects? Just come right out
and thwart the panicky disinfo constantly being spit out by the DEA and the
FBI and even CNN, and instead divulge that it's really not an epidemic at
all, that millions of people are safely discovering the joys of MDMA and are
doing just fine.
Sure MDMA use is rising dramatically and there are more Ecstasy-related
emergency-room visits than ever (nowhere near the massive scale of our pal
alcohol, mind), simply because many uninformed folks abuse the stuff and
don't know what they're doing, a problem that has little to do with the idea
of debauched nihilistic youth and everything to do with how much how much
the powers that be refuse to address the problem in fair and honest terms
that don't openly mock and degrade the intelligence of the millions of
casual users everywhere. Which is not to say dumb or otherwise persistently
naive people won't abuse the drug anyway, but that can be said of just about
anything.
And let's go even further: What if our media and our officials could
honestly reveal that MDMA really ain't all that bad, that it's even
comparable in overall harmlessness to our UCSB's professor's goodly
marijuana, all things considered and as far as chemical stimulants go (read:
they all take a toll on your health -- it's just a question of balance), and
that if it's pure and delivered in the right dose MDMA is almost completely
safe and non-addictive can actually be just terribly fun and inspiring and
soul-expanding and even world-altering for the better?
Which is only a slight hyperbole, honestly, despite what you've probably
heard and despite the BS you see via CNN's overblown special reports
<http://www.mapinc.org/safe/v01/n1183/a08.html> , as they trot out
not-very-bright teens to tell overly dramatized, exaggerated horror stories
about their, like, totally like, gnarly experience with MDMA at this party
this one time, because that's what viewers and politicians and TV news
directors want to see.
Maybe they could even come right out and announce with a big smile that if
you're going to enjoy Ecstasy, do so in moderation and drink lots of water
and test the stuff first to make sure it's not laced with other sundry vile
crap, and don't imbibe it to excess because that's simply stupid and
dangerous and in extremely rare cases could actually kill you, which has
happened on occasion but again, only because of serious abuse or
complications resulting from severe hyperthermia (overheating) and not
nearly to the scale and violence and epic idiocy of booze.
And then they could finally add that we're only talking openly and honestly
like this because we care about our kids and our citizenry and we wish to
inform and protect them and let them know some drugs can be a fascinating
and worthy psychological and cultural experience, if you're ready for them,
instead of constantly cramming harmful alarmist rhetoric and misinformation
<http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/abc/20010807/hl/gma010807_ecstasy_1.html>
down their disbelieving throats, which only causes resentment and rebellion
and mistrust. Newsflash: All drugs are not all bad all the time. Now shut up
and pop another Xanax, senator.
Instead we have cops cracking down on rave culture, authorities shutting
down parties and dance clubs and utterly benign gatherings, trying to
somehow rein in the flood of mostly joyous Ecstasy and throttle youth
culture for its own good.
We have ridiculously tendentious news reports and brow-furrowed politicians
pretending to care and drawing up narrow-minded legislation and further
alienating young people and intelligent culturally savvy adults users across
the nation. Hell, we're not even half as enlightened as the Swiss
<http://www.ecstasy.org/info/swiss.html> .
We have people like Governor George H. Ryan of Illinois, who just signed one
of the nation's harshest anti-Ecstasy laws, wherein a person convicted of
possessing a mere 15 pills in his militantly unfriendly little state will
receive a mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison. Right. That
oughta do it.
Sometimes it seems just painfully clear: In terms of social enlightenment,
we have not progressed a single inch.

     So my early evening to mid was spent w/ Brandon & this was the 1st tim=
e we kicked outside off a Rave!  LoL  It was Dope jus' chillin' & talkin' &=
 stuff!  We even went to the market to gt junk food!  He's totally tryin' 2=
 convince me 2 make it out to Sound Asylem II which I have to totally check=
 my calander on that!  Hmmm, but yeah, whenever y'all get the chance to, ki=

s Dope hangin' w/ her for that quick min!  So Dope Kickin' it w/ Brandon!  =
Actually it was his alternate ego I was hangin' out w/!

     Then I went to Psychotica!  It was nice seein' my Ratkoonrat Fam again=
 'cause I don't get to see them all too often like back in the day when we =
were 2gether like everyday!  Checked out downstairs & Jungle was spinning!!=
  I totally tried getting into it & I did!  I mean, downtempo was also bein=
g spun along side the Jungle which made it hella fun for me to dance.  But =
man, after an evil Jungle set like Genome spun on Monday, I was in the mood=
 to hear darker shit & the Jungle was kinda to mellow for me earlier @ Blak=
es!

     NRG came  next & I was Groovin'!!  I did bump into Cliff & Siarra (SP)=
!  It was CooL seein' those 2!!  Another reason I WAITED a while there was =
'cause I was suppose to meet up w/ Veronica, but she never should the 2 hou=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TO HAPPYCORE HATERS

The point of my email wasn't that people who don't like HHC are bitter 
people. I just firmly believe that you can't tell someone that their opinion 
is wrong- that is why it is an opinion, and that is the reason that all the 
"Trance Sucks. No wait, Jungle sucks more..." threads on this list are so 
pointless. Same goes for the way people dance to whatever music they listen 
to- I may not like the way they dance, but it is a form of self expression, 
and so it is not my place to judge it.

I personally don't like HHC, and so I would not call it "quality music", but 
that is my opinion, and everyone else is entitled to their own. Saying that 
HHC isn't quality music is not a fact- it is subjective, based upon your 
personal standards for what makes music good. Stating something like that as 
if it were a fact implies that everyone is judging from the same standards 
(the standards of the person speaking), or that they should be. This is a 
fairly egocentric viewpoint and one that I think would be debated heatedly 
by the majority of the list. It just seems like there is a smaller 
proportion of people who listen to HHC, so not that many people are speaking 
up when people bash it. I wonder, though, what would be said if this thread 
was relating to jungle, house, techno, or breaks instead of HHC. I would be 
willing to bet that there would be more people speaking up about the rights 
everyone has to their own opinion.

As far as my response to Ryan, it was a response to several emails that have 
been posted by him recently. That, and it was supposed to be private, but I 
hit the damn "Reply All" button. I know, I'm a dumbass. :-)

Oh, and on a completely unrelated note: has anyone noticed that this is a 
KICKASS weekend for all the househads out there??? Hmmm.... Donald Glaude, 
Eddie Amador, Nick Nice, and the ENTIRE LINEUP at ASR.... Do you know how 
excited I am to put on my dancing shoes???

Subject: Re: [sfraves] donald glaude tonight?  decibel?

I've been to Decibel but not when it's being taken
over by a production crew so I don't know if things
change when someone else is throwing the party. If
everything stays the same, the dress code is strictly
enforced. No tennis shoes or jeans and everyone is
macked in club gear. The club is in the basement,
under Cafe Carousel. The space is pretty big and they
keep it well ventilated. That last couple of times
I've been there, the music was GREAT! Although, the
crowd was a bit too upscale for my taste.

"a man cool enough to smoke a jay on the rotunda of the White House"

I don't think that the White House has a rotunda.  The Eisenhower Executive 
Office Building has two small rotundas but that isn't the White House.  
Maybe we're thinking about the Capitol Building's rotunda.  Scary what you 
can remember about tours you took 14 years ago...

ok so it is not a rotunda, but it is a round top to a building...besides, do 
we have to get into a semantic discussion about something not even related to

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TO HAPPYCORE HATERS

HHC == pop music

I'd listen to it more, but I keep hearing the 
same samples/sequences/patterns (only slightly changed

or so) over and over.  maybe i need to listen to
it more; a wider range other than Apex's stuff.

or just make my own - intelligent happycore anyone?
:)

At the end of my first bad acid trip, I realized
that there is indeed a purpose to pop music (thus its
equivalent) and that it has its place in the world -
you know it's been a bad night when you grok the
importance of the Spice Girls

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TO  HAPPYCORE HATERS


Won't last?  HHC like it or not is here to stay.  If I remember correctly it's
been around well past the "phase" stage already(that being 2-3 years).

I really don't know shit about it, I just like to dance to it, and YES you can
dance to it, if you're not a house listening sloth..  HHC is like jungle, it
caters to the party people with energy, unlike downtempo/house/trance that some
party kids have a hard time staying awake to, let alone dancing slow enuff to.

As far as garage, I've been of the perception that trance/house beats with a
jungle style bass roll in the background is garage, whereas 2 step has that 
"extra" step in the beat that makes me fall all over myself when I try to dance
to it, but then again I have difficulty with anything under 140bpm cause I'm
hyper and I like to get down, not slowdance..

There's plenty of room in this scene for ALL types of music, STOP HATING.

Let's face it...HHC will not last. It's getting to the
point where everything is going house. Look what
happened to speed garage....they just changed the name
to two step...WTF? I guess it serves it's purpose by
attracting the kiddies....

Whatever man.

All electronic music sucks. It's all crap. Techno, trance, jungle, house, 
HHC, NRG... all of it should be destroyed. Burn it all and put in a Yanni 
CD.

This is retarded.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: capturing streaming music

i found this application and thought that a lot of you might find it
intresting:
http://www.highcriteria.com/productfr.htm#prod_TR

it's a program called total recorder from a company named high criteria.  it
lets you capture pretty much any streaming audio you may be listening to and
save it to your hard drive.

i know a lot of you are like me and browse the web for streaming mixes and
live sets.  it saves the files in high quality wav format, so it's easy to
put on a cd.  

it's frustrating to find a really good mix that isn't available anywhere
that you would like to have to listen to in the car, now you can save it and
burn it for later :)

lots of luv
Scott

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: capturing streaming music



an alternate solution for windows users is to activate
your soundcard's internal loop-back without the need
for extra software...

double click on the little speaker in your system
tray.  this will bring up the Volume Control panel. 
go to the menu that says "Options" and select
'Properties'

You'll get a secondary window describing your sound
device and you'll see a section with some radio
buttons.  click the button next to 'Recording' and
then hit the "OK" button.

Now you'll see a control panel much like the volume
control, but it's title will be "Recording Control". 
Here you'll have sliders to control the input from
various sounces like 'Microphone' 'Line' 'Modem' and
others.  look for one that says 'StereoMix' or
something to that effect... you may have to play
around a bit to find out what your particular sound
device calls the loop-back.

once you've got it figured out, select that input
(only) and close those controls up.

now you can open up SoundForge or Vegas or Peak or
whatever sound recording software you use and when you
tell it to record, it will record whatever is flowing
through your soundcard.  so you'll just have to tune
in to the stream you want and hit the record and stop
buttons at the appropriate times.

i know that my sound card has this, and i'd think most
of 'em do.  it's a bit of a tricky solution and it
takes a few times before you really get the hang of
doing it (you wind up playing the "Why am I not
hearing anything?" game the first few times you try
it), but once you get the concept, you can record
anything that comes through your computer, then
manipulate it in your audio editor and use it as you
see fit.  all without having ot buy extra software.

Ok, one of my friends is turning 21 on saturday.  I think he wants to 
hit up a big club so I was thinking Ruby Skye or 1015 or 550.  He's 
obviously a little young for Ruby Skye and 1015 is a suckfest on 
saturdays, so does anyone know whats going on at 550?  For that matter, 
are there other big clubs that are cool?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TO HAPPYCORE HATERS

Ok, dude, I, on the other hand, do mean disrespect. You knock Happykore,
and then hide behind a lame 90s-ism "No disrespect...". PUH-LEASE. Listen
to yourself, everything that you're saying about Happykore, "It's not
music", "Weird", "Kids stuff", "Can't dance to it", is what 90% of the
country says about RAVES IN GENERAL! OHH!!! But nevermind! Let's have our
non-weirdos have parties and let the TRUE freaks listen to Happy Hardcore!

I suppose that if ones lacks the imagination or the dancing ability to
dance to Happy hardcore. Actually, I take that back. Dancing to Happy
Hardcore doesn't take a huge amount of imagination nor a huge amount of
skill.

BUT!

What it does require is a lot of energy, and being comfortable enough to
COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY release your inner FREAK. You have to dance harder
than you have ever danced before. You have to kick your feet above your
head, flip over, jump around, scream as loud as you can, spin and twist and
go totally and completely NUTS. Wanna know how to dance to Happykore? Ask
some friend of your who goes/went to ska shows and have them show you how
to skank. Now go skank harder than you've ever skanked before, and THAT, my
friend, is how you dance.

You could learn something from that 5 year old.

WE ARE SF FUTURISM WORLDWIDE!  Live it and Love it -- SF Styles Seen!

This Saturday, August 18th, 2G1

IT'S LOCALS WEEK! YOU SOLDIERS KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
Our club was built on the locals, thriving when the locals play.
You know how Eklektic is when there is no hype!

Our playaz for this session will be:

JUJU (phunckateck/phuturo/and labels galore) The man, killing it with 
all releases and making his mark internationally, and to think what 
seems just months back. Juju was learning how to make tracks with Obi 
-UFO! JUJU is headlining the home front for all who dig his dark 
stylie.

4REAL (bbs/groundscore) Groundscore's latest team addition, 
representing BBS in NYC and GS outta SF, this man has it locked down 
coast to coast and goes to town.  4REAL is JUJU 's favorite local DJ 
right now, and the energy these two toss out on the same bill is 
immeasurable.

TAO (black-locust) Resident of Insomniac's world class drum n' bass 
stage's (along side
Fury & co.) and host of the insomniac jungle show on kdvs 90.3 (Davis, CA)
for four years running, the "Tao" always 'un-fadeable' is honored to 
do it again,
for the eklektic rukus!

MIKEY J. (selekta).  This guy is really holding it down for us in the 
EK room.  He is working his ass to the bone to get from Sac to EK 
every week, where he sets-up, rocks shit, gets down and breaks down, 
(and so much more) as he masters his art from all angles on the 
underground railroad.

DUH MC - OK, it's the fighting Irish.  Who wants to go Head 2 Head.


This is the HEKTIC breaks factor.

PL-X (black-locust) Sacramento's original drum n' bass and breakbeat freak,
Adrian Soleto makes his fourth appearance at Hektic this year having garnered
approval from the likes of Rennie Pilgrem and Danny Mac of late following his
Introduction via FTD, PL-X looks to step it up a notch for the sf faithful.

CHASE (Bombay) Sac crew fully comin' with our good friend CHASE in the ride.
His second time at Hektic he is primed to shred like dread and sock it to ya
with his punchy nex-step and fired up nu-breaks

FELIX THE DOG (GS/In-Flight Ent./30Khz UK)
Back from a successful tour in Europe, this dog comes home with way more
than a limp and "Timmy's stuck down the Well". Riding high with his 
trip behind him,
now it's all 'bout Tuff 'n' Ruff and Acid Indebassbins. .

Catch him, back in the pulpit ministering the Hektic mass we call home.
(FtDInUk Photos, coming soon.)

JROCK //Our boy J on a mission to move it on up with exactly the right stuff to
get the jack back on track.

FROGGER //aci-d-igi-ridoo buffin' up the basslines in de place!


100% Sucka Free San Francisco
Cat Club // 1190 Folsom St at 8th St
10pm - 3am // 21+ // $10 // Runnin'

Thanks for the help if it's possible,

Subject: [sfraves] WE

    We bitch and complain about our scene. Yet when the time comes to
support shit. We judge it by how cool the dj's are. What happened to the
thought that "I am the party"??  Its not that the dj makes the party.
The dj is one party of huge picture. The people make it. You make it.
Stop thinking that the dj is the key. This is our scene not a show not a
game this is our portrait to the rest of the world. I am saying this not
to upset or piss anyone off. But when I go out and see places half full
with great local dj's and no dancers it gets me down. Just get up, stay
up and dance you hearts out. This is a chance in a lifetime to be apart
of a movement and life style. I have been at this a long time and too
see this low is a shame.

Adam

You don't play it through WinAmp... you just play it. WinAmp is a *player*:
it takes data and turns it into other data that your sound card can
understand.  The sound card then actually turns it into an analog signal
(or perhaps digital) which is sent out to your speakers or amp or whatever
you use to play back sound from the computer.

If you have something plugged into your computer's input and you're
wondering why you can't hear it, WinAmp is not the place to find the
answer.  Take a look in at the mixer (double click on the the little
speaker icon in your desktop tray or go to Start-> Programs ->
Accessories-> Multimedia -> Volume Control).  If I recall correctly, input
volumes are muted by default.

If you could describe what's hooked to what and most importantly what you
are actually trying to accomplish, that would greatly aid myself and others
in helping you fix your problem.

Subject: [sfraves] In Defense of Happy Hardcore

The development of happy hardcore was an important response to both the rise 
of a pretentious intelligent electronic music mantra that did not hide its 
disdain for rave culture and a trend toward darker music in the British rave 
scene.  It was intended to provide music for fast, active dance with a 
positive spirit and it retains that goal today.

The happycore scene is actually the only surviving element of dance culture 
in England that still views itself as a rave scene, having resisted the 
general transition of the scene into a club-centered culture.  If you walk 
into a happycore event today in England (or check ush.net) you will still 
meet people who are self-consciously ravers whereas if you attend other 
events there, people will tell you that the rave scene died a decade ago.

A derogatory tone has been used on this list to call happycore childlike.  
I would agree that happy hardcore is consistent with the Taoist notion of 
returning to the inner child, the part of oneself that is the purest form of 
a child of God.  This is hardly a disadvantage in my opinion as it allows a 
release of the energy of youth and a conscious return to the playful spirit 
of human community.  In this spirit, happycore is one of the few electronic 
music genres that promotes singing along to the lyrics, a fundamental part 
of ancient music and dance ritual.  As such, it provides another pathway for 
people to enter the scene from other music communities.

I have no problem with differences of taste in music but I believe that 
hatred of certain music is typically tied to prejudice against the people 
who listen to the music (scorn for rap with racial overtones, hatred of 
country with a disdain for rural America, and anti-newkids hysteria with a 
need to feel better than early-teenage girls.)  The responses on this list 
provide evidence that the resistance to happycore is also based on contempt 
for an audience that epitomizes the candy raver stereotype.  It was this 
original derision that allowed rave culture to be targeted and separated 
from other appreciation of electronic music.

Disrespect of a people due to their choice of music is our exact charge 
against government and society in reference to the rave crackdown in 
general.  I would therefore advise that each of us be a part of the 
celebration of our diversity rather than unwitting accomplices in the 
culture war.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WE

Fuck off Adam you don't know what the hell you are
talking about.  The dj's create an evironment or
setting shall i say, that we succum to, thus inturn
releasing negative or postive energy to the rest of
the crowd, which is what every one feeds off of.
 
JUST KIDDING!!!!
Nothing but love for ya kid!

Thank you so much adam.  That needed to be said!!!
Seriously.  There was one down fall of last night that
made me realize this.  I won't get into it now cause
really i am not bringing this kind of drama to the
list.  especially this list.  but you know what i am
talking about, Adam.
We really do make the scene. every single one of us
and what one person does or doesn't do reflects on the
community.
There are many different reasons i go out to parties. 
One, is if you are spinning at it.  TEEHEE!!! i'm
joking.
But sometimes it is the reason i get to see a lot of
people i wouldn't normally see on a day to day basis,
for reasons being they live farther away or they are
busy with their every day lives.
I do beleive that the crowd really is the vibe and how
we react in this enviornment really does impose how we
feel at the party.  Regradless if the dj sucks or not,
we still create the vibe.  This topic is so debateble
and you really got me stirring on this one.  Cuase i
really can go both ways.
I mean why was it you are coming with me this weekend?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr: capturing streaming music

I was just talking with my friend about this today.. my experience is that
older legacy systems just can't keep up with the streaming of real-audio
while writing it to the same disk as it caches, even with DSL.. kind of a
buffer underun thing where the music is played out while the processors
write previously saved data to disk.. anyway.. I use a minidisk to record my
audio-streams and then using my digitial spidif inputs/ or analog and dump
it to a wave file for editing.. works great everytime with no interuptions..
so if you have the means.. I highly recommend it! - Ferris Beuler :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: capturing streaming music




an alternate solution for windows users is to activate
your soundcard's internal loop-back without the need
for extra software...

double click on the little speaker in your system
tray.  this will bring up the Volume Control panel.
go to the menu that says "Options" and select
'Properties'

You'll get a secondary window describing your sound
device and you'll see a section with some radio
buttons.  click the button next to 'Recording' and
then hit the "OK" button.

Now you'll see a control panel much like the volume
control, but it's title will be "Recording Control".
Here you'll have sliders to control the input from
various sounces like 'Microphone' 'Line' 'Modem' and
others.  look for one that says 'StereoMix' or
something to that effect... you may have to play
around a bit to find out what your particular sound
device calls the loop-back.

once you've got it figured out, select that input
(only) and close those controls up.

now you can open up SoundForge or Vegas or Peak or
whatever sound recording software you use and when you
tell it to record, it will record whatever is flowing
through your soundcard.  so you'll just have to tune
in to the stream you want and hit the record and stop
buttons at the appropriate times.

i know that my sound card has this, and i'd think most
of 'em do.  it's a bit of a tricky solution and it
takes a few times before you really get the hang of
doing it (you wind up playing the "Why am I not
hearing anything?" game the first few times you try
it), but once you get the concept, you can record
anything that comes through your computer, then
manipulate it in your audio editor and use it as you
see fit.  all without having ot buy extra software.

This is why I laugh at the RIAA and their attempts to encrypt music.  Even 
if they do succeed (right now the formats don't work on all cd players), I 
can still run the cd player's output into my sound card and record a wav, 
and then compress it to mp3...  making the cd's unrippable isn't a solution.

While this is true, that has to be decoded to analog *somewhere* upstream
of the speaker cone, they're trying to move it a lot closer to speaker
cone:  USB speakers that will only play watermarked streams are here today
or will be very soon.  Additionally, while you can always re-digitize the
analog stream, and with good gear, the quality lossage will be minimal, it
sure does make it major pain in the ass! Right now I can pop in a CD and
have my auto-rip script email when it's done.  *boom* one step.  With what
you're talking about, I either need to, by hand, record the whole stream
and chop it up, record each track individually, or jump through some hoops
and write a bunch of code to automate that process.

*thinks about it a bit*

Hmmm... that wouldn't be too difficult.  Perhaps I'll apply that logic to
this CD I have that I can't seem to rip.  I'll get back to you on that.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WE

I understand your point about the dancers being a large contributor to the 
vibe of a party, but I when I go out to a party, I want to see/hear quality 
talent.

You can't expect people to be as happy to dance to a poor DJ as they would 
be for a solid performer.

Fuck off Adam you don't know what the hell you are
talking about.  The dj's create an evironment or
setting shall i say, that we succum to, thus inturn
releasing negative or postive energy to the rest of
the crowd, which is what every one feeds off of.

JUST KIDDING!!!!
Nothing but love for ya kid!

Thank you so much adam.  That needed to be said!!!
Seriously.  There was one down fall of last night that
made me realize this.  I won't get into it now cause
really i am not bringing this kind of drama to the
list.  especially this list.  but you know what i am
talking about, Adam.
We really do make the scene. every single one of us
and what one person does or doesn't do reflects on the
community.
There are many different reasons i go out to parties.
One, is if you are spinning at it.  TEEHEE!!! i'm
joking.
But sometimes it is the reason i get to see a lot of
people i wouldn't normally see on a day to day basis,
for reasons being they live farther away or they are
busy with their every day lives.
I do beleive that the crowd really is the vibe and how
we react in this enviornment really does impose how we
feel at the party.  Regradless if the dj sucks or not,
we still create the vibe.  This topic is so debateble
and you really got me stirring on this one.  Cuase i
really can go both ways.
I mean why was it you are coming with me this weekend?

Subject: [sfraves] Hatin on...

I believe posts in nature similar to "XXXX sucks,
YYYYY sucks; and, you suck" are all considred
"Trolling" (definition: Don't make posts that are
inflammatory just to get people riled up.  Substance
is the key to not being labeled a troll.)this behavior
is acknowledged by 90% of newsgroups on the entire
internet. XXX sucks because it's too fast for me/too
slow for me/too happy for me/too big for me/etc is not
substance. It's opinion that no one cares to hear and
especially redundantly repeated(unless you are
planning on starting a "XXXXXX sucks club" and are
looking for recruits, in which case the mailing list
is probably not the best place to do that in the first
place).

-Hardcore & Happy hardcore is actually making a rise in NorCali!  I've spok=

Go see Aneurysm! He played our last SFR party Relic, and he was badass. I
had never heard him before until that night. Damn cops had to come right
before his set and hence had to turn down the sound. =(

took on a life of it's own!  I read a book about this!

I was told that it is Hardcore is coming up!

Trancecore, or what Aryck recently told me he has a record to Gangster
Hardcore, etc.!  So no, I'm sorry, but this music ain't gonna die out!  U
can also spin HHC w/ jungle & I've seen DJs do that!  There are people who
made careers from Happy Hardcore too!

anything I can dance to!  But if knockin' HappyHardcore totally puts you in
a better mood 'cause U have nothin' else to than to take the time to voice
you opinion and yak bout how U think it suck, then you seriously need to
get a life!  LoL   OK, I'm gonna listen to Happy2BHardcore Vol 2 & take a

Huh?

Just route the mic-in to wave-out.
Like in the mixer settings, enable mic-in or line-in for playback.
Then unmute them and turn them up.

Subject: [sfraves] rant rant rant  was Re: [sfraves] Re: this weekend


I really just looovvveee this silly American emphasis on age.....
I'm 30, so I guess I'll feel out of place too...
Talking with Apollo as well as others (of that age bracket) would 
have never happened (nor would I have learned anything) if I'd have
had an attitude of "oh, he's just an old geezer".  and I get along fine
with the early 20 yr olds - would certainly like to date a 21 yr old candy
raver, any out there? (please raise your hand)

Ascension wasn't last night and I'm still annoyed,
Doug

Heh.

Please pass this on to whatever idiot is trying to pass this bullshit =
off as fact!

What absolute fucking drivel.
Taking this apart line by line, the 'happycore' scene is no surviving at =
all.
It is as near to dead as something can be without decomposing.
Record sales - if you can call them that - are so pathetic now, only the =
most narrow minded fool can pretend it has a fanbase of note any more.
Hard House, seen by many thousands of listeners and clubbers, is seen as =
a natural progression of what Hardcore once was, and is very happy to be =
seen as rave music.  Although England has never (and we fucking hope =
WILL never) have Candy Kids, our closest equivelent is exclusive to Hard =
House.
Happy Hardcore is now almost universally seen on this island as =
pathetic, laughable noise.
It is not played at ANY events around the Country, other than the 1 or 2 =
organisations still trying to promote it.
Of those, only 1 has put on any event of respectable size in the last 12 =
months, and that success was arguably due more to the popular venue it =
was being held at closing forever immediately after the event.

England is moving further and further away from club culture with every =
weekend that passes, and large scale dance parties or festivals is now =
taking hold as the successor.

If you walk into a happycore event today in England, or check ush.net, =
you will meet the same 30 or 40 people, all the time.
Ush.net IS the UK happycore scene.
Each rave is little more than a meet up for them.

If you attend other events in the UK and ask people if they are ravers, =
especially if you ask from a standpoint of defending happy hardcore, =
it's not surprising at all that they distance themselves from it in an =
extreme way.
The rave scene YOU are referring to, however, DID die a long time ago.
>From late 95 onwards, happycore was it's own scene, forever desperately =
trying to cling on to what once was.
It has been in a continual decline since then, and is now at such a =
pathetically no-existant level, you have to wonder about the =
accumulative effects of drugs for anyone still holding hope for its =
future.

> A derogatory tone has been used on this list to call happycore =
"childlike."

That's because happycore is the most worthless, ridiculous shite on the =
Planet.
And I say that from a standpoint of someone who made it professionally =
for several years, and started his musical career in it.
It is garbage, most often made by people with little to no musical =
ability, who more often than you may expect, didn't understand the basic =
principle of having all the music in tune.
It's music for adolescent drug users by adolescent drug users, =
shamelessly so, and for that reason, I would go beyond "childlike" as a =
description, and move further towards "Utter Bullshit".

> I would agree that happy hardcore is consistent with the Taoist notion =
of

form
> of: a child of God. =20

... The FUCK?!?

Did I miss a page here?

Why are so many people in the US determined to find religion claptrap in =
every damn thing they can?
Jesse Ventura is my idol, for his statement: "Religion is nothing more =
than a crutch for the weak".

> This is hardly a disadvantage in my opinion as it allows a
> release of the energy of youth and a conscious return to the playful

Uh huh.

Or, looking at it another, slightly more grounded way, it's hardly =
surprising that a music form tailored for Ecstacy users is often seen to =
be listened to by very happy, uninhibited people.

Perhaps it is the love of our Lord, Jesus Christ, moving through their =
unbalanced souls, and realigning their inner light with the true will of =
God, causing these sensations of joy and rapture????

Or maybe it's a bunch of kids on drugs, acting like a bunch of kids on =
drugs.
And, for the record, and to stop the inevitable comments of "But I like =
it and I don't do drugs", you don't have to be on drugs to act like =
someone on drugs.

> In this spirit, happycore is one of the few electronic

part

pathway

What the flaming wizzle shizzle are you people smoking in San Francisco?
Toilet Bleach?

What a major shocker that is.. nursery rhyme music for crackheads, and =
the kids sing along like a bunch of 8 year olds learning the alphabet..

> I believe that hatred of certain music is typically tied to prejudice =
against the people
> who listen to the music...

Yes, I will agree with that.
I don't get on with idiots that take pills.
I don't get on with cutesy wootsy kids.
I don't like people that can't control themselves when they go out to =
places.
So it's no surprise I don't get along with a bunch of cutesy wootsy kids =
that get out of their head on a trillion pills and lie around the floor, =
massaging lotion into each others arms while puking in the corner and =
telling people they just met that they love them.

BUT, it's not just the clientelle - it's the mindless, brainless =
thumping of a music that stretches the term of 'music' to its limit.
It's marginally more musical than gabba and 'terrorcore', but only by a =
tiny sliver of a percent.

> The responses on this list provide evidence that the resistance to =
happycore=20
> is also based on contempt for an audience that epitomizes the "candy =
raver"
> stereotype.=20

And what's wrong with that?

You love to keep talking about the early rave scene and how it was back =
then, so let's talk about that for a moment.
There were NO Candykids.
There was no-one acting like a candykid.
For the most part, you would be lucky to find someone under 20 going to =
raves.
They were huge electronic music festivals, more like a psychadelic theme =
park with music than the events that go on today.
Those people that got too messed up were shunned by the crowd, who went =
about their business.
Candy Kids on the other hand, revel in the kind of behaviour that used =
to get people thrown out of events, in order to make the event better.
There are people like me out there that DON'T enjoy socialising with =
these kinds of mental case screw ups, don't like being near them, and =
certainly don't want to be round them when going out somewhere.
You may tell me my kundalini spirit is not tempered properly, or that my =
inner child needs more emotional nourishment, but I consider myself far =
more normal for disliking these damn children than the people that are =
quite happy to just step over them when they collapse on the dancefloor.

> Disrespect of a people due to their choice of music is our exact =
charge
> against government and society in reference to the rave crackdown in
> general.=20

You know, I have grown up with raves, raving and rave culture.
Your American Candy Kid freakshow has absolutely NOTHING to do with the =
roots of the rave scene, and they should have been kicked out of your =
dance music scene a long, long, long time ago.

It is NO surprise to ANYONE outside the USA why the Government is =
cracking down on raves!!
You're allowing these fucking retards to still be a part of it!!
Let's stop ignoring the truth here - These days, Candy Kids at an event =
ALWAYS equals drugs and idiotic kids taking stupid substances in stupid =
quantities.
Do you really think the Government would be as bothered if they didn't =
look and act like such degenerate crackheads???

> I would therefore advise that each of us be a part of the
> celebration of our diversity rather than unwitting accomplices in the
> culture war.

And in contrary to that, I would advise that if you have any love for =
dance music in your life, you do NOT allow these stupid little children =
to run amock at your events, and you do NOT turn a blind eye when they =
lie around the floor, wondering what Planet they're on.

If you clean up your raves, then your raves will no longer be seen as =
the drug-sustained insanity that they - quiet rightly - are being seen =
as.

Stop pretending to yourselves that the rave scene is just an innocent =
celebration, and start taking action against the bullshit that has =
almost destroyed it for you.

If you don't, then you'll be kicking yourselves for standing by and =
doing nothing when the scene has been strangled by worried authorities.

Ahhh, that explains a lot.

Subject: [sfraves] New audio downloads!

Hey everyone.

I've set up a temporary page on my website so you can download high
quality mp3's of my current works, the majority of them off my first cd
which should be finished by the end of September.

I'm not sure what kind of genre to classify myself in... most likely
breaks or drum'n'bass. Anyway, you make the call. And I like feedback so
please send a quick e-mail if you like or don't like my stuff.

Everyone have a good weekend!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: TO HAPPYCORE HATERS

>>>>>
From: DNA
Subject: Re: In Defense of Happy Hardcore
Please pass this on to whatever idiot is trying to pass this bullshit off as 
fact!  >>>>>>

That would be me.

>>  The happycore scene is actually the only surviving element of dance 
>>culture in England that still views itself as a rave scene, having 
>>resisted the general transition of the scene into a club-centered culture.

>>>>>>
What absolute fucking drivel.
Taking this apart line by line, the 'happycore' scene is no surviving at 
all.
It is as near to dead as something can be without decomposing.
Record sales - if you can call them that - are so pathetic now, only the 
most narrow minded fool can pretend it has a fanbase of note any more.
>>>>>>

I never said it was the most popular genre, nor do I think that is relevant 
to the discussion.

>>>>>>
Hard House, seen by many thousands of listeners and CLUBBERS, is seen as a 
natural progression of what Hardcore once was, and is very happy to be seen 
as rave music.  Although England has never (and we fucking hope WILL never) 
have Candy Kids, our closest equivelent is exclusive to Hard House.
>>>>>>

I love hard house and the people in that scene as well but I do not believe 
they see themselves as ravers.  Any even-minded observer entering a hard 
house room and then a happycore room at a British party would agree that the 
happycore kids are most like American ravers and a closer equivelent to 
'candy kids.'

>>>>>>
Happy Hardcore is now almost universally seen on this island as pathetic, 
laughable noise.
It is not played at ANY events around the Country, other than the 1 or 2 
organisations still trying to promote it.
Of those, only 1 has put on any event of respectable size in the last 12 
months, and that success was arguably due more to the popular venue it was 
being held at closing forever immediately after the event.
>>>>>>

I agree that happycore is treated with contempt by mainstream club culture 
in England.  It may not be played at massives, but there certainly are many 
happycore events in England.  One need only check the ush.net calendar.

>>>>>>
England is moving further and further away from club culture with every 
weekend that passes, and large scale dance parties or festivals is now 
taking hold as the successor.
>>>>>>

If this is true, I am happy to hear it.  As of a year ago when I left, this 
was not the case.  There is definitely a massive festival circuit but I 
don't think you could reasonably say that they are moving away from club 
culture.

 > If you walk into a happycore event today in England (or check ush.net) 
you will still

>>>>>>
If you walk into a happycore event today in England, or check ush.net, you 
will meet the same 30 or 40 people, all the time.
Ush.net IS the UK happycore scene.
Each rave is little more than a meet up for them.
>>>>>>

These are good people, including some friends of mine.  I met far more than 
40 people at happycore events.

>>>>>>
If you attend other events in the UK and ask people if they are ravers, 
especially if you ask from a standpoint of defending happy hardcore, it's 
not surprising at all that they distance themselves from it in an extreme 
way.
The rave scene YOU are referring to, however, DID die a long time ago.
>From late 95 onwards, happycore was it's own scene, forever desperately 
trying to cling on to what once was.
It has been in a continual decline since then, and is now at such a 
pathetically no-existant level, you have to wonder about the accumulative 
effects of drugs for anyone still holding hope for its future.
>>>>>>

With a very derisive tone, this is the same thing that I said.  Some people 
are content to let the rave scene die and think that it died long ago.  
Others still consider themselves ravers and are trying to evolve and 
continue.  These are mostly the happycore kids.

 > A derogatory tone has been used on this list to call happycore 
"childlike."
 > I would agree that happy hardcore is consistent with the Taoist notion of

 > of: a child of God.

>>>>>>
... The FUCK?!?
Did I miss a page here?
Why are so many people in the US determined to find religion claptrap in 
every damn thing they can?
Jesse Ventura is my idol, for his statement: "Religion is nothing more than 
a crutch for the weak".
>>>>>>

Spirituality is evidently not part of the rave scene contemplated here.  My 
message, however, was that a return to the youthful spirit can be an 
important release in modern society.  That message is not dependant on 
religious affiliation.

 > This is hardly a disadvantage in my opinion as it allows a
 > release of the energy of youth and a conscious return to the playful
 > spirit of human community.

>>>>>>
Uh huh. Or, looking at it another, slightly more grounded way, it's hardly 
surprising that a music form tailored for Ecstacy users is often seen to be 
listened to by very happy, uninhibited people.
Perhaps it is the love of our Lord, Jesus Christ, moving through their 
unbalanced souls, and realigning their inner light with the true will of 
God, causing these sensations of joy and rapture????
Or maybe it's a bunch of kids on drugs, acting like a bunch of kids on 
drugs.
And, for the record, and to stop the inevitable comments of "But I like it 
and I don't do drugs", you don't have to be on drugs to act like someone on 
drugs.
>>>>>>

I have not seen any evidence that happycore ravers are any more likely to do 
drugs than people who listen to other genres.  Happycore is certainly 
tailored to dancing quite hard.  For some, this may take drugs; for me, it 
does not.

 > In this spirit, happycore is one of the few electronic

>>>>>>
What the flaming wizzle shizzle are you people smoking in San Francisco?
Toilet Bleach?
What a major shocker that is.. nursery rhyme music for crackheads, and the 
kids sing along like a bunch of 8 year olds learning the alphabet..
>>>>>>

I am not embarrassed to sing along; it is one of the oldest ways to 
appreciate music.


 > I believe that hatred of certain music is typically tied to prejudice 
against the people
 > who listen to the music...

>>>>>>
Yes, I will agree with that.
I don't get on with idiots that take pills.
I don't get on with cutesy wootsy kids.
I don't like people that can't control themselves when they go out to 
places.
So it's no surprise I don't get along with a bunch of cutesy wootsy kids 
that get out of their head on a trillion pills and lie around the floor, 
massaging lotion into each others arms while puking in the corner and 
telling people they just met that they love them.
>>>>>>

This is a beautiful illustration of the contempt for rave culture.  In my 
opinion, it is not in our interest either to perpetuate these stereotypes or 
to espouse hatred toward music that is tied to a hatred of the people in our 
community.

 > Disrespect of a people due to their choice of music is our exact charge
 > against government and society in reference to the rave crackdown in
 > general.

>>>>>>
You know, I have grown up with raves, raving and rave culture.
Your American Candy Kid freakshow has absolutely NOTHING to do with the 
roots of the rave scene, and they should have been kicked out of your dance 
music scene a long, long, long time ago.
It is NO surprise to ANYONE outside the USA why the Government is cracking 
down on raves!!
You're allowing these fucking retards to still be a part of it!!
Let's stop ignoring the truth here - These days, Candy Kids at an event 
ALWAYS equals drugs and idiotic kids taking stupid substances in stupid 
quantities.
Do you really think the Government would be as bothered if they didn't look 
and act like such degenerate crackheads???
>>>>>>

Some of us are on the other side of this culture war.  We do not believe 
people should be denigrated for the style of music they choose or for the 
style of clothing they wear.  I do not wish to throw anyone out of the 
scene.  I'm willing to help anyone who needs help with drugs or other 
problems or to consider harm reduction strategies for the scene as a whole.  
The solution, however, is not to move the scene entirely into clubs and 
concert venues and ban all items that remind you of the kids you disdain.

Subject: [sfraves] AEC 8/24 or 25?(wasRe: [sfraves] **Cool stuff on Saturday, Aug 24th/ 25th???)

It's for reals, Terry. My talent agency was trying to get me the gig for one 
of the lead charaters but I didn't get it because I'm not eighteen. They 
said something about some huge naked scene or something...? But naked and 
HJBC go together like Ryan and foo foo trance! Anyways, so then I heard from 
this kid I know from way back in the day that the movie shooting got 
postponed (don't know why, anyone else know?), but to make up for it they 
were bringing in a traveling circus with freaks and all? Shit I dunno, 
either way I'm going to go one way or another. Jesus, does anyone have the 
leads on this?!?! I mean DAMN, DJ Ham-One vs DJ Dan tagteaming Doc Martin? 
That's fucking insane!

Yes, that's right... I am finally home from my little "around the world" =
excursions.  I got back from Costa Rica last night... To refresh you all =
on my travels... I was in New Zealand in June, Egypt in July, and Costa =
Rica in August.  And I made a little 2 week pit stop in L.A.  ANYWAY, I =
won't BORE you with TOO much of what I did...=20

New Zealand was for work, I drect a chorus and they were on tour... WHOO =
HOOO!

I have friends and family in Egypt so I PARTIEDDD like no other, as =
usual... Yes, I've visited the sites (like 10 years ago...), but =
actually... This year, I had a request for sand and a picture in front =
of the  pyramids with a flyer, so I HAULED MY ASS to the pyramids, got =
on my knees looking like a fool and picked up holy sand. :-D

And Costa Rica was KICK ASS... I went rafting, deep sea fishing, toured =
the rainforest (met some monkeys), saw an active volcano with lava =
dripping down the side... You know, all that envoirnmental shizznet.  My =
father is teaching down there, so he told my brother and I to COME on =
down. :) =20

Anyway, I hope you guys had a KILLER summer, just like I did. I know I =
missed a million parties, but I'm just looking out for pictures and what =
not.  ~*MUWAH*~
It's GOOD to be home,
Sabrina

Exactly. How many times have you heard someone complain about the other 
people at the party? And I think, "Wait a minute! YOU are the people at the 
party!"

If you want a good vibe, you should recruit your own friends to go. Or you 
could walk talk to the people waiting in line at the toilets, or at the bar 
or at the coat check. You could smile at people instead of checking them 
out. Or, as Adam suggested, you could dance.

What do you do when the dancefloor loses its vibe and it fills up with 
sloppy drunks, shoving you out of the way or grabbing your ass?

Just keep dancing. Face forward, close your eyes and feel the bass.

You ARE the vibe, you ARE the party.

Subject: [sfraves] beauty issues nrr

lots of women enjoy pampering themselves, but some of
the products out on the market right now and in the
past have been putting us though utter hell!!!! and
now, i am going to gripe about it...my current
motivation for griping is that i am having an allergic
reaction to either:

a. tide detergent or more likely
b. some french body lotion that i applied to my skin
after shaving, and then i sat outside in the sun.  

so, what does an allergic reaction mean to someone
like me or maybe you too? well, i am not always being
glamorous, simply because i am EXHAUSTEd, however, i
do like 
to shave my legs, and even though i do not look like a
big hairy gorilla, i have not been able to shave my
legs 
since last sunday, so i am not happy about that, plus,
i have a rash..also, my hair is lovely, however, i
found 
some really pretty hair color in a box for a very good
price that i invested in, but now i cannot even do the
little 
test patch on my arm to see if i able to safely use
the hair color until my current rash goes away...you
see, if 
one product is giving you a rash, you want to be sure
that that is the only thing that is giving you a rash
so 
that you can be sure never to use it again. anyway, i
am so annoyed, plus, even though i put sunscreen on my
face, 
i am still getting burned, and also, since i have this
stupid 
allergic reaction, i can't wear shorts or a cute short
skirt, because the sun might have played a role in my
current 
skin condition. ugggggggghhhhhhh!~!!!!!!!!!!! at
least, i am still able to wear pink lip gloss. :)

Struggle for Equality
--------------------------

"I know why you pull me ovah, it's because I'm black, isn't it?"

"No, it's..."

""&*^^^*&#!  You just don't like me cause I'm black, right?"

"Sir, you're not black."

"Oh.  That's right.  I forgot."

Don't mind me, I'm just making this up as I go along... =]

---

This week we've seen more of what is undeniably a sharp increase in 
the number of arrests and alleged harrassment by all three branches 
of our government.  Right now it seems like they have us ravers 
backed into a corner --- with perhaps no way out.  The eternal 
question, of course, is what, if anything, do we intend to do about 
it?  Online discussions about the subject are randomly rampant; 
people get tired of the debates after a while, but it is nevertheless 
important to get that point of view out on the table.

Some claim we can compare the struggle of the underground rave 
movement to the struggle of Ghandi and Dr. King, while others claim 
that it does not, and it's insulting to even suggest it.  In reality 
though, it may not be entirely accurate to compare them, for Dr. King 
and Ghandi are not living in 21st Century America, a place which is 
relatively clean and civilized, to a certain point, but is riddled 
with control which we have asked for more of progressively over 
generations.  Probably the most important thing they did not have 
that we have is the Internet.  Now that we are able to communicate 
cheaply and instantaneously around the globe, our personal level of 
importance has equalized in some way.  Television, radio and film 
were great steps in achieving what we are today, for better or worse. 
One major drawback of that era, however was there was no medium which 
the average person could voice their opinions and have the same 
potential audience in numbers as there is today.  In fact, this very 
article is a product of such change.  Now anyone that wants to step 
up to the podium and be Dr. King can, and they don't have to worry 
about cancellation due to lack of ratings.

But what about equality?  Isn't it proper and necessary for any group 
that feels unfairly treated to protest?  Why has dancing become such 
a big issue?  If the world isn't ready for us, they can stay home, 
but leave us alone and let us dance.   Taking the parties more 
underground won't always work...though only inviting people you know 
and keeping it small is probably safer in the short run; that, 
however, can start bordering elitism very quickly and make things 
stale due to lack of new people interacting with them on a scene 
level.  Sure, we can all form small groups, but it's not going to 
guarantee people won't be harassed in the way they are today.  Are we 
going to allow this to continue without a fight and hope it will just 
go away?

It won't.

Subject: [sfraves] No Ambient at Rant 'n Rave

(Associated Press) San Francisco, CA - Apparently there will be no 
ambient music at Rant ' Rave this evening.  Rumor has it the entire 
Ambient Mafia was abducted late last night into a Russian nuclear 
submarine.  The greedy bastards wanted to be entertained personally 
and they are now headed for the Arctic Circle.  The United States 
government has sent out 3 Urban Assault Vehicles in search of their 
safe return and the aircraft carrier Nimitz has changed course, 
though this is completely unrelated to the Ambient Mafia's 
predicament.

thank god for starbucks and internet kiosks!  i was quite surprised to
find them on the russian sub!

anyways, this is an emergency...  i need to know how to say the following
phrases in russian:

"please, no more borscht!"
"where's the bathroom?"

the captain already offered to trade us the sub for our jeans; he says
that phat pants are hard to come by in the former soviet union.

oh no!  here come the russians!  i'll be back later with more updates.

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Clean Plate Club - TONIGHT! - w/ Midwest legend NICK NICE


Tonight's the night!

An Sibin's probably going to be packed, so
get there early and don't be left out.

Dress to dance. Dress to SWEAT.

--------------------------------------------------------

Ten reasons you'd be a damn FOOL to miss Nick Nice tonight:

(1) Plays the fattest, funkiest, sexiest disko/tech/HOUSE music ever.

(2) Threw the first rave party EVER in the Midwest, Oct. 31, 1991.

(3) Blowin' up dancefloors for 14 years running.

(4) Was resident DJ at Queen, the then #1 club in Paris, and has
     guested at Le Rex, the current top club in France, as well as
     guesting on Bob Sinclar's "Yellow Mix" radio program.

(5) Revered as a GOD by his legions of fans worldwide.

(6) Owner/operator of one of the Midwest's most respected dance
     music stores, Nice Musique.

(7) Runs his own record label, Milk Tank records.

(8) Was the mentor of Clean Plate Club's spectacular resident DJ,
     Chad Mindrive.

(9) Will be dropping bombs from his collection of over 30,000 records.

(10) Dozens more reasons that none of us, frankly, have the time
       to get into.

the founding father of the Midwest rave scene in his
long overdue FIRST EVER San Francisco performance:


===========  N I C K   N I C E !  =============

milk tank records / nice musique : madison, wi

Appetizers anyone?

Once again, let's keep it simple and just say that if you truly love
house music, this is one DJ you owe it to yourself to experience.
It would be a gross understatment to say that you will NOT
leave disappointed.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] WE

And another thing:
   Speaking as both a DJ and a person who gets on the floor and dances, we
really do like it when YOU dance!!!  Spinning isn't just about being a great
DJ--its about giving and taking.  I guarentee you that if you're all
dancing, the DJ will be even more pumped, and probably give you an even
better set in return.  I'm not sayin' the DJ has nothing to do with the
nite--i mean, you gotta know how to spin, and you gotta know what people
what.  But it is about interaction and the crowd and DJ definitely build off
of each other and vice versa.

Does any of that make sense??

Exactly. How many times have you heard someone complain about the other
people at the party? And I think, "Wait a minute! YOU are the people at the
party!"

If you want a good vibe, you should recruit your own friends to go. Or you
could walk talk to the people waiting in line at the toilets, or at the bar
or at the coat check. You could smile at people instead of checking them
out. Or, as Adam suggested, you could dance.

What do you do when the dancefloor loses its vibe and it fills up with
sloppy drunks, shoving you out of the way or grabbing your ass?

Just keep dancing. Face forward, close your eyes and feel the bass.

You ARE the vibe, you ARE the party.

Subject: [sfraves] Rant N Rave CANCELLED IMPORTANT PLEASE READ!!!!  (Gianni)

     Well, Everyone It seems like we've lost another great all ages bay area 
venue. Thanks to whoever is hiding behind the made up name of 
"MysticalMayhem@hotmail.com" is we've now lost our venue for RANT "N" RAVE.  
Yes, RANT N RAVE as of now is CANCELED. It seems that the CHP got an 
anonymous call as did the Sacramento headquarters of our venue. Well, 
Needless to say I'm very upset. I just can't understand how some of you 
people think. I could sit here and vent for hours about this but instead I've 
choosing to try to make something positive out of this. I hope that the 
person and or persons responsible for this, is reading this. If we as a 
community are going to EVER survive all the negative publicity from the 
outside media then we must stick together at some level. Yes, We are always 
going to have disagreements, and even people we just don't like. I understand 
that, that's life, But if this scene is to EVER survive we have to understand 
that sometimes we have to look out for ALL OF OUR best interests, for the 
Scene's best interests. The survival of the bay area rave scene depends on 
this. I can say that there goes one more great all ages venue, for ever!!! 
Not just a venue for me, or Yarrow, or you but for ALL of us. So I guess I'm 
pleading to you (who ever you are) To please think before you act, Think not 
only about your enemy, think not only about you, but think about the entire 
industry that WE are all a part of. Everytime you do this your killing a 
little bit more of the bay area rave scene. If WE don't stop hurting 
eachother soon, this scene that we all love will no longer exist. I have just 
one more thing that I'd like to add, I've been playing out of town quite a 
bit and I can honestly say that 70% of the raves/clubs that I play at suck 
compared to our own BAY AREA. We are all so spoiled, The bay area ROCKS!!! So 
lets all try to save it before we lose it forever. 
For all you who had planned a great night with us and purchased presales 
please go back to the store for the ticket price less the service charge. We 
are truly sorry for any inconvenience this has caused and I'd hope that we 
have your continued support.  

        
                                    
                                    respectfully 
                                                
                                                Gianni

That hella sucks...I honestly am not surprised. This once happened to us

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WE

Yeah, I kinda agree with this. I mean, I'm not going to lie, there have
been crowds that have completley gotten my spirits down, whether it be
that there were just way too many kids on drugs, or mean hard guys
pushing me around, or whatever the circumstance are. A lot of times if I
am in that kind of situation I find myself kind of sulking in the corner
thinking 'why am I here?' but lately if by chance I end up at such a
party where I'm just not feeling the vibe I work at making the best of
it. Take invasion for example! Very e-tarded party. Got there, kinda
bummed by the crowd and the silly little nieve kiddies running around.
Tired and stuck there I took Osby and John and joined e-puddles! Then
Jeff came and joined us later. Very funny. We made up silly names and
just joined the crowd as the sober e-tards! I don't often find myself at
too many parties like that, but the few I am at where things arn't that
great, I just try to make the best of it and adapt the best I can to my
surroundings. I'd say the best way to enjoy a party is know what kind of
crowd, music, crews, ect. please you and go with that, but every now and
then we find ourselves in places where we don't quite fit in. It can be
upsetting at times, but I guess thats when you just have to give in and
let yourself have some fun!

Subject: [sfraves] Im back, Im sorry, and thanks to all of you.


'Kay I quit filtering out SFRaves a couple of days ago, and I think Im ready
for a fresh start.

Once again, I'd like to apologise for all the negativity I was spewing out a
few weeks ago.  To anyone whom I offended, I'm sorry.

Leslie, in particular...  when you came down on me for bitching about the
livermore cops, and the enviroment at maratime hall....  when I signed off, I
described your replies as flameing me.  I'm sorry.  I was way out of line, and
your responses were level-headed and much more productive than mine ever have
been.  I truely am sorry.  The scene is so much stronger because of people like
you.

It's no excuse... but a bit of an explanation.  As anyone familiar with my
posts might gather, I have a probelm with authority figures, legitimate or
otherwise.  When said authority figures abuse the power with which they are
entrusted, I get pissed off, and tend to rant unproductively.  When
ILLEGITIMATE authority figures abuse their imaginary powers, I fly off the
handle totally.

I have always beleived that with additional power, comes a greater
responsibility to wield that power responsibly.  I think, because of the
greater power the people grant the police, they SHOULD be held to a higher
standard than the rest of us.  When they illegitimately abuse that power, and
they do NOT suffer reprecussions, I think we take one more step towards a
police state.  So, when the police DO abuse that power, I firmly beleive that
repucussions should be swiftly forthcoming.

THAT is why I have, in the past, fancied ideas of hidden webcams to record the
actions of the cops in the event of a bust, and even the "rich patron raver" to
initiate crippleing lawsuits against police who get out of line.  If they
cannot keep themselves in line, then to turn their own system against them,
would be the next best thing.  Yes, they were "pie in the sky" ideas.  Sure, I
was and am hopelessly naieve and optimistic.  But then, without hopeless
optimism, where would the world be?  Hell, California was BUILT on hopeless
optimism.

Besides... the thought of someone like Steve Jobs or Larry Ellison keeping an
abusive cop tied up in court till he can't afford his doughnuts just gives me
warm fuzzies all over.  Well, this IS California, and anything can happen
here... maybe someday *I* could be the one on the offensive instead of
defensive.

But enough idle speculation.  It wasn't appropiate for the list, and I'm sorry.

On a more positive note, the last few weeks have greatly improved my outlook on
life and my attitude.  I'm still jobless.  But I'm feeling much better about
it.  And prospects seem to be picking up a bit.  I'm a fair bit less bitter at
the world, and have swung my outlook a fair bit more in th positive direction
in the last few weeks.

And a big thanks to all of you who have been there for me... those of you who
read the list at least.  Ditto to those of you who don't... but they won't see
this.

It's amazing to think of the changes in my life since moveing here, and
becoming part of this scene.  A year and a half ago, when I was first moving
here I would never have guessed that I would have made so many friends, so
fast.  Hell, I would never have guessed that I would set foot into another
rave... and like it.

So many of you have been so kind, even when I was a complete stranger (hell,
still am to a lot of SFRaves, to be sure).  That's nothing like I ever found on
the east coast.  Thats one reason I'm loveing California so.  And that's one of
the few things that scares me about the job hunt... that I might be forced to
leave all this behind.  There's just too much, too many people, I'm too fond
of, to not be filled with saddness when I think of things like that.

I can't thank all of you enough, for what this scene has come to mean to me.


thanks,
john

Subject: [sfraves] Ascension thursday, and Sound Aslyum next weekend...

Okay, on a quicker note...

A purely logistical question.  I'm thinking, this thursday, I'm FINALLY goint
to hit up Ascension, and hopefully meet a few more of the SFRaves mafia.  But
I've got a more logistical question than anything else....

Where the F*#%@!$ do you park near Blakes in Berkeley????  When I get over to
Berkeley, Im most always BARTing it.  Obviously not an option for an event
ending @ 2am.  So I gotta drive.  But having seen the vacinity of Telegraph on
foot, I despair of finding a place to park.  And all the garages Ive seen are
closed well before 2am.

Anyone kind enough to point me to wherever all nite garage or lot all you
SFRavers use?

If I make it (90% likely), I'll be there in my obnoxiously orange "Mr T" shirt.
 I pity the fool who doesn't say hey.

And who else is gonna be at Sound Aslyum?  I definately plan to be there. 
Anyone wanna suggest a couple of meet-ups?  Or maybe we'll just have a roll
call later and describe what we'll be wearing?


cya,
john

Depends on what the tipster told the police and the venue owners.  I have
seen this happen before and I have seen police do some nasty stuff out
Midwest to kidz just because there were at a party, where they searched 150
kidz and only found 2 people with weed and one with an outstanding traffic
warrant....

I'm always there about late 10ish and there are ALWAYS parking spots around 
Skills on Telegraph or below that (down to Andronico's or whatever that
grocery 
store is)  Yes, it is then a few blocks hike, but one can always use the 
exercise

What will I wear - um, I don't plan my outfits till I put them on...
Look for the old guy with a goatee.

Sure, I

you forgot idealistic.  And I agree with you 100% actually.  I forget your
posts and whatever the fuss was, but your theory about power and
responsibility
is perfectly sound.  It is just that the real world doesn't work like that
a lot of the time and it is frustrating when you can see how things *should*
work...  i spent 8 years as a government contractor banging my head against
the wall because of all the stupid game-playing gov. employees do that
wastes so much taxpayer money.  But as one gets older, you realize how to
temper that idealism - but I hope to never lose it.  It is just a matter
of knowing what exactly you can change

 from Back in the day, Bola!!  It was Groovy 'cause him & I used to work to=
gether @ The French Hotel!

     Get back to the BBQ house & chill for a few Hrs!!  My Goodness man, to=

     I was kinda psyched about the night 'cause there was this Dope Ass und=
ergraound I wanted to go to!  In the meantime, I get a call on the cellie I=
 been forgeting to give back to my Mom from BRD the man!  But he tells me t=
hat he kinda needs a ride to DNA & since I was headed in that direction, I =
tell him that I'll bring him!

     I wait for Amber's arrival to the BBQ & kick it w/ her for a few, then=

so i heard that there was an AEC party comming up... but i haven't heard too 
much info on it.... anyone have line up details or anything like that? i know 
it's underground so i'll have to wait for location info until friday, but 
anything that anyone knows would be great! i feel like i'm totally out of the 
loop here... but i'm clawing my way out of this black hole that i've been 
hidding in... and what better way to end the summer than with a good outdoor? 
so please, if you have the info pass it along!

love and hugs and kisses,
tina

Hey yo, everyone!
       Now for another nomadicDJ
super-short-notice-spur-of-the-moment-open-decks-to-all-house-party
(NDJSSNSOTMODDTAHP)!!  Anyways, yea, I'm throwing a small shindig tonite
with a couple friends in Half Moon Bay.  Those of you who I met at Ascension
last time it was on might recognise this as the house party that got
cancelled on Thursday!  (Sorry guys--the guy who had the house had forgotten
it was his mum's birhtday.  I offered to, err, take care of her, but he
didn't think that was such a great idea .  . . ).
    Anyways, if you want to come, it's just gonna be me, a couple friends,
and some decks.  No fancy shmancy stuff, just a very chill shindig, so if
you're interested in chillin' with us, get in touch.  It's not my house, so
please no drugs, no dangerous weapons (lol) just a good vibe.

Peace!

Well, Andy is like this, The California National Guard is a state run 
facility, On the back of their contract they have a clause stating that they 
can stop (cancel) anything at their facilities at any time. This clause is in 
there because its a reserve military base, and in the event that there be a 
fire, flood, riot, ect where they would need the facility ASAP. Unfortunately 
this is their way out. Now this event was ready to go, permits were issued 
from their headquarters in Sacramento. But when you have the CHP, and 
"concerned parents" (Yea right) calling the headquarters in Sacramento 
complaining and accusing the State of promoting drug use, the State (National 
Guard) can and will use their power to cancel the event. I hope this clears 
it up a little more. Have a great day 


                            Gianni  :0)

trouble with the other hotels around the area near the airport. there have 
been noise complaints  because of the music being so loud at all hours of the

"(2) Threw the first rave party EVER in the Midwest, Oct. 31, 1991."

No big deal... but, those years were hard enough work, cost SO MUCH MONEY,
spilled so much blood, and occasionally hard time in jail... that I feel the
record should be set straight.

First off, Nick Nice & Co. are the shit, no doubt... 'true pioneers of the
Midwestern scene.  Minddrive is an old friend and Dj partner of mine. BUT,
you can even ask them and I'm sure they'll remember who actually threw the
first raves in the Midwest.  Mark Farina, Derrick Carter, Spencer Kincey,
Mark Substance, Mystic Bill, Diz along with myself (known then by my full
name, Wade Randolph Hampton) had been throwing underground warehouse parties
in Chicago for 2 years by then. The parties were called '321', 'Substance',
'1466' and 'Wades World' along with the odd Project X - 'Outlaw Parties'
featuring a brash young New Yorker named, Keoki.

We had, in fact, given in to the terminology and started calling this binge
of ours 'raving' by the Summer of '91.  The first midwestern rave was
actually Sept. 13, 1991 and it was called - LIFE, thrown by Blue Sky
Corporation.  The next one was Ultra Life on Oct. 5 and finally, on the Oct.
12 was Energy Rave, featuring none other than DJ JD, now known around the
world as John Digweed.

Where this Wisconsin crew really stepped in and made a change was later the
next year when they took the idea of raving outside... farms, ranches, empty
fields etc. This become the style for a while, and after the dark warehouses
we'd been hanging out in, I have to say it was a welcome change of pace.

Minddrive if you're out there on SFRaves... bounce me your info... I'd love
to hook up.

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Clean Plate Club - TONIGHT! - w/ Midwest legend
NICK NICE



Tonight's the night!

An Sibin's probably going to be packed, so
get there early and don't be left out.

Dress to dance. Dress to SWEAT.

--------------------------------------------------------

Ten reasons you'd be a damn FOOL to miss Nick Nice tonight:

(1) Plays the fattest, funkiest, sexiest disko/tech/HOUSE music ever.

(2) Threw the first rave party EVER in the Midwest, Oct. 31, 1991.

(3) Blowin' up dancefloors for 14 years running.

(4) Was resident DJ at Queen, the then #1 club in Paris, and has
guested at Le Rex, the current top club in France, as well as
guesting on Bob Sinclar's "Yellow Mix" radio program.

(5) Revered as a GOD by his legions of fans worldwide.

(6) Owner/operator of one of the Midwest's most respected dance
music stores, Nice Musique.

(7) Runs his own record label, Milk Tank records.

(8) Was the mentor of Clean Plate Club's spectacular resident DJ,
Chad Mindrive.

(9) Will be dropping bombs from his collection of over 30,000 records.

(10) Dozens more reasons that none of us, frankly, have the time
 to get into.

Once again, let's keep it simple and just say that if you truly love

It would be a gross understatment to say that you will NOT
leave disappointed.

all, all,  all around the world same tune...i think
that is how it goes...there is a sample of a song in
my brain 
that holds some major truth. i would just like to make
one small request of some of the gentlemen here, and
perhaps 
the ladies too..it's a little bit harder to tell with
the gals...please stop sizing me up. basically, if i
were 
interested, you would know. there's a difference
between your personal fantasy, and the reality of the
situation.  
i don't really appreciate it at all. i'm nice, so i
make light and make jokes, but i can see that it's
having 
a bad effect on our little environment here, and i
don't 
really like it anyway. i actually resent it, even when
i'm smiling. i'm a busy gal. go read some erotica.
peace. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Hard Drives and House History

The PC I've configured for communication and business has been behaving in
an erratic fashion for the past week and on Friday the hard drive died.
Ugh!!!  So I've been incommunicado lately working pretty much non-stop to
replace the drive and rebuild the system.  Since my bread and jam depends on
this computer, my focus has been on repairing and restoring the data.  House
History, therefore, will resume with Issue 26 this coming week.

The only good thing about losing a hard drive is that you get rid of all the
useless crap that you've accumulated over time.  Sort of like moving to a
new house.

Love,

Apollo

This is an urgent cry to anyone who can help. Bjork is having her concert

I have been a HARDCORE fan for ten years and have been *dying* to see her in 
concert. So, naturally I was set up online to get tickets at 9:30 this 
morning, ready for when they were to go on sale at 10am. Boom, within FIVE 
minutes they were sold out. So me being the devoted fan I am I decided to go 
for the tickets in LA, hoping I would have better luck. So again, I was all 
set up at 11:45 for the tickets to go on sale at 12. This time the tickets 
sold out within THREE minutes. I am so devastated right now. If ANYONE has 
an extra ticket or knows anyone who does, I don't care where it is or who 
I'm sitting next to, I would be forever in debt to you. I AM DESPERATE. Ten 
years now I have been waiting for this. I can't begin to explain really how 
much this concert means to me. Call me at 415.451.8160 if you have any 
leads. Thank you from the bottom of my little Bjork lovin' heart. : )

I'm not a Happycore lover.  But I'm also not one to diss music that other
people love and gets them dancing.  All this negativity and drama
surrounding an innocuous musical genre mystifies me.

The post from DNA forwarded to the list in response to Matt's eloquent and
thoughtful defense of his musical passion was, however, offensive to me in a
couple of important areas.

First, I think attacking another's religious or spiritual beliefs is out of
order here.  DNA is certainly no intellectual giant.  "Jesse Ventura is my
idol" pretty much summarizes his level of sophistication in philosophical
matters.  What we have here is adolescent, barroom-level prejudice.

And his classification of all Candy Kids as pretty much the core of all evil
in the American rave community is just more mindless bigotry.

Drugs.  Who the hell is this brit to take the high ground on drugs?  The
brit dance scene is drug -free?  Acid house had no connection to
psychedelics?  Those who I know in the UK underground culture tell me crack
is the drug of choice these days at the squat parties. Every music
subculture has some problems with a minority of people, young or old, who
have addiction-related diseases.  You take care of your house, dude.  We
will take care of ours.

Props to Matt for his reasoned reply to this rant designed to provoke more
fruitless, gut-inspired  flaming rather than reasoned debate.

Love,

Apollo

There are many things I love and many moments that I cherish...but my first 
love would have to be the moment I solved the Rubik's cube. Oh my God, that 
damn little cube got me so aggravated in fourth grade. My dad had given it 
to me as a gift, but as I started playing around with it, it felt more like 
a device of torture. I was so close to just peeling the stickers off and 
placing all same-colored ones on each side....but alas, on July 3rd of that 
year, 2 days before my birthday...I had conquered the monster, the beast 
known as the cube of Rubik. :-P I'm kidding, by the way, my first love would 
have to be a tie between sports and gettin my groove on to great music.

I'm psyched about Ayame!  I just heard about it yesterday. I live in San 
Rafael, just a few blocks away.  And Tracer is one of my favorite DJs so I'm 
happy to see that he's a resident. 
Very cool ... hope to see a lot of you there.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] where is nocturnal wonderland (Havasu?)

Yeah - I was there a couple of weeks ago! Havasu City, on Lake
Havasu, is in the middle of NOWHERE. Not sure how you'd get
there from LA (we were going from the Bay Area), but it's past
Bakersfield, over the Tehachapi pass, down to Mojave and across
the Mojave Desert, past Edwards AFB, to Barstow, then keep
going on I-40 for 2 more hours of unremitting desert (make sure
you gas up first!) to Needles, past Needles, across the border into
AZ, then take a right and about 45 minutes from there you hit
Havasu City. It's hot as hell, and just generally a weird artificial
place dropped in the middle of the desert. The most interesting
thing there is London Bridge, which they moved there as a tourist
attraction (those Americans will buy anything!). Find some shade
and drink lots of water! I could believe 6 hours.

Enjoy!
- Martin

    Now ok. . .

    this is an older email. . .

    Some of you people hate hhc soooo damn much, BUT YOU DON'T EVER LISTEN
TO IT ! so it's basically ignorance right?

    "That's right a FIVE year old can relate to HHC. Says a lot..."
    2 comments:
        you can't teach an old dogg new trix
        A five year old can relate to it, but so many 20+ year olds can't
understand it and
        don't even know where to begin. . .

I'm not a little kid, Im a responsible small  business owner with 2 college
degrees and 2 jobs !

    This all constantly feels like this gang battle sorta. . .  I'd totally
rather hang out with joyous happy bouncey people than with these old fogeys
who are all "it's too loud, it's too fast". Kinda puts me in a difficult
position though cuz most all of my party buds seem to be anti-hc . . . I've
kinda been doing my own thing lately though, the more I get into hc and that
whole scene (more than just going to parties), the farther I seem to
distance myself from old friends, mostly because of peoples attitudes
towards things I believe and am part of. . .

    but like say la vee (or whatever). . . guess I'll just keep pushin. . .
gets annoying though. . .

one last comment:
        The old businessman type, the ones who wore shirts n ties and combed
their hair to the sides. . . god forbid if you'd ever wear ::gasp:: AN
EARRING. . . these same businessmen aren't competing well anymore, why ?
Because they failed to open their eyes and look and listen for new thoughts,
ideas, ways of life. . . And the people quickly taking their place are the
people with visions, not the old "if it ain't broke don't fix it" attitude,
but the new "lets break it and make a new one" attitude.

You know you're too old when you quit before you start. . .

Hey Kidz...

    Tonite we're pleased to bring you one of the latest artists to emerge
and continue the great Spundae progressive house tradition, Jonathan Ojeda.
He'll be dropping the latest in smooth and deep progressive house choons.
We'll be talking a lot about the label he helps to run and represents,
Spundae Recordings, as well as giving away cds and tickets.
     We also have the privilage of bringing you the huge sounds of Rowan
Blades, one half of the powerful production duo Breeder!  Rowan and his
partner, Simon Noble have brought such massive hits as "The Chain" and
"Twilo Thunder," absolute floor staples for the likes of Sasha, John Digweed
and Jerry Bonham. Rowan also runs the the favorite label, Rythm Syndicate,
and was previously a member of the 90's production team, Pariah.
    We're not sure how the structure of tonite will work yet, but you can be
guaranteed of at least two hour sof progressive!  Stay chooned... ;-)

Subject: [sfraves] local DJs online 

I'm trying to find local DJs who have music (original
or mix) on-line in any format.  Any links would be
appreciated.  

Thanks, Moe.

p.s. if you know of any who would like to get music
digitized (MP3, Real...) I may be able to help.

Good lord, kids in the UK don't learn their alphabet until age 8?  Who'd 
have thought that you could sustain a developed nation with such 
lackadaisical educational methods...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Anyone know of any cgi scripts that can block
 certain IP's

Usually, you would need to configure your web server to reject requests
from IP addresses you specify. This is generally not a CGI script issue,
unless your site's content is being generated by a CGI script, in which
case you could still go the web server config route, or add code to check
for the IP addresses into the CGI script itself.

Hope this helps,

dan

drum & bass for close to a decade. Tom Withers, the production force =
behind the project, fuses elements of Techno elements with intricate =
beats and emotive arrangements to form a distinct hybrid.=20

Although now eclipsed by his work as Klute, Tom's induction to the music =
industry came in the eighties with his role in the notorious skate punk =
band 'The Stupids' however, after three albums, ever-increasing =
attention got the better of the band and they split.=20

Following the break up Tom took some time out to travel around the US, =
where he first discovered 'electronic' music, as he explains. "I started =
listening to a hell of a lot of techno, but when I came into it all of =
the strands were pretty much lumped together so that if you went out you =
would hear anything from Belgian rave to progressive house." "Becoming =
involved in the music was never a calculated move, more something which =
just ended up happening. I bought a drum machine but found that I was =
more interested in having my own sounds and it seemed a logical step to =
buy a sampler - I haven't really picked up the guitar since."=20

On returning to England in 1993 he settled in Ipswich, with his early =
material surfacing on Deep Red although it was his recordings under the =
KLUTE pseudonym ("the word has aesthetically pleased me since I was a =
child," he laughs) at Certificate 18 that brought widespread attention. =
Already enjoying considerable success with artists such as Photek and =
Digital, the label suited Tom's techno influences. His singles have =
stretched the genre, with the eerie, deep space manoeuvres of 'Total =
Self' contrasted against the seminal 'Leo Nine,' which captured the =
essence of Speed with delicate synth constructs propelled by tumbling =
percussives and an unforgettably deep bassline.=20

"I've tended to just do what I do and not think too heavily about the =
concepts behind it," says Tom. "It's those times when I'm lost in the =
space of a track that it really starts happening for me. Different =
things please different minds, but it is the challenge of making =
something new and avoiding things that are perhaps too obvious or =
familiar that keeps me interested. I listen to quite a wide variety of =
music but have always tended to be quite marginal; outside looking in - =
so a 'science fiction feel ' for me is more abstract than buzzing =
computers and dark sounds. I'm very much into portraying an image, but =
try to present that image in a distorted manner so a track or a title =
could mean any one of many things. I guess my music isn't the easiest to =
get into, and if I had to provide a description it would be as intimate =
terrorism in that I try go out of my way to stretch expectations of what =
music."=20

After four years at Certificate 18, Tom released the debut KLUTE =
longplayer, 'Casual Bodies.' The album extended on the singles, coupling =
a complex blend of sounds sourced from the vaults of Detroit Techno with =
complex beat programming, which worked with as opposed to pulling =
against the atmospherics. The resulting level headed feel allowed the =
more unusual tracks to leap from the system with liquid agility, =
abstract sounds built into molten landscapes of percussion. Adds Tom; =
"Casual Bodies is a reference to the mass of people out there without =
referring to them as individuals. For me and my musical background I =
feel that the first album is often the burning one - tearing it out of =
the garage and getting that fury out of you and once completed it is =
almost as though you're free to expand and develop what you are doing a =
lot further."=20

He feels his recently completed second album, 'Fear of People,' is quite =
different from the first. "It's difficult for me to offer a perception =
of this one as I'm still settling on it, other than I am more relaxed =
with what I'm doing and feel able to do more on the musical side of =
things." In explaining the curious title he adds, "Again it's not =
necessarily a negative or paranoid thought, more two fingers to the =
pretentiousness which seems to accompany a lot of the dance music scene =
and an observation of the reluctance of a lot of people to take their =
music a step further.=20

The real reason behind the title is to reflect what seems to be a =
prevalence of fear in modern day living, whether that's a fear of crime =
or missed opportunities and we almost encourage ourselves to be equipped =
with this fear.=20
I wanted to move away from that and adopt a deeper and emotional outlook =
within my music. I think a lot of people have been turned off by certain =
elements of drum & bass, and I would hope that 'Fear of People' =
demonstrates a side of the music which doesn't exclude anyone and shows =
that there is still much that can be done within the genre."=20

This is demonstrated in the album, with the introduction of vocals =
acting to further humanize the electronics while the instrumental =
material is as focused as ever with multi faceted rhythm sections =
balanced by melancholic low end and thoughtful melodic leads.=20

"To me drum & bass is a form of music which has always been out on a =
limb and the tracks that have shocked me are those that have expanded on =
what went before them," explains Tom. "Whether that's people using the =
technology in ways that you're not supposed to or just turning around =
sounds in different ways. As far as I am concerned people taking chances =
is the future and I would like to think that my material falls into that =
category."=20

Subject: [sfraves] Breeder aka Rowan Blades is playing this week at ascension

I've just been told that Rowan Blades, more commonly known as Breeder, will
be playing Ascension this Thursday. I personally still love Twilo Thunder
and The Chain so it's going to be damn cool to see him play in such a small
venue. Usually this is the kind of DJ you have to listen to while suffering
through throngs of people at 1015. I added a bit on who he is and what he's
done that came from the Gatecrasher site.
http://www.gatecrasher.co.uk/connected/djs/rowanblades/

R O W A N B L A D E S
Career Rowan Blades is best known as half of the massively successful
Breeder. Breeder's first two singles, 'The Chain' and 'Twilo Thunder', have
sold in excess of 25,000 copies world-wide, having first come to prominence
on Sasha's near-legendary 'Global Underground - San Francisco' compilation.
'Twilo Thunder' has since gone on to achieve great commercial success with
lucrative licences to compilations from the Ministry of Sound and Euphoria
2, which have sold over 500,000 copies between them. Breeder's third, fourth
and fifth tracks, 'Tyrantanic', 'Rockstone' and 'New York FM' have been
showcased on Sasha and John Digweed's last 'Northern Exposure - Expeditions'
compilation, as well as on John Digweed's 'Global Underground - Hong Kong'.
With over 20,000 pre-sales for Tyrantanic, things look set to continue in a
similar vain to how they have started, and in doing so stamping out any
doubt that they are a 'one hit wonder'. This rapid rise to prominence has
resulted in several high-profile remix projects. These include Tilt's
'Children', Planet Perfecto's classic 'It's Not Over Yet', Brother Brown's
'Under the Water', Orbital's 'Nothing Left', and Evolution's 'Phoenix'. On
the back of this success, Rowan has started a new project with Gaetan
Schurrer, who has engineered for Sasha. With successful remixes of,
Orbital's 'Nothing Left' (FFRR), and of Space Manoeuvres 'Stage One',
released on Hooj Choons, as featured on Sasha's recent Global Underground,
they seem to have established themselves without even releasing their first
single.

Breeder's success on Rowan's own Rhythm Syndicate record label has boosted
the label to a position of prominence within the dance music community.
Rowan has since been able to sign four new tracks to Rhythm Syndicate for
release next year, and has prospective mixes from the likes of Slacker, Tilt
& Evolution to name a few. Add to this the status of Rhythm Syndicate
Records as one of the top 10 independent dance music stores in the UK,
helping compile Pete Tong's Buzz Chart play-lists for Radio 1, and Rowan's
record empire is one of the most influential in the country.
Rowan's DJ-ing career has taken him all over the world. Having played in
Britain for gigs like Bedrock & Gatecrasher the success of Breeder has
enabled him to elevate himself onto an international stage. Breeder is
currently the biggest selling non-pop dance act in Norway, Rowan has played
there with great success, as well as in Sweden, and at a gig for 14,000
ravers in Copenhagen. The burgeoning American demand for dance music has
seen Rowan play at the legendary Shadow Lounge in Miami, as well as boat
parties on the Hudson. The nascent Chinese scene has seen Rowan playing at
The Face in Canton, attracting only 100 people less than Paul Oakenfold!
Most recently, Rowan taken his Rhythm Syndicate record label and the Breeder
name to Hong Kong as the main attraction of a huge gig for Clubstar
Entertainment's. He has also establish a monthly residency in Moscow for
Club Xlll. Closer to home, Rowan has a bi monthly with Union @ Space in
Leeds. He also still maintains his monthly residency with More Tea Vicar,
the Cambridge organisation for whom he has played with Sasha, Carl Cox and
Danny Howells, as well as the annual Strawberry Fayre festival, at which
Rowan played last year to 20,000 people.

Guys,

Please don't follow the instructions on this web site.  I've read through
this tutorial and this person doesn't actually have much clue as to what
they are talking about and some of their instructions will possibly damage
your install of windows or programs that you use.

There certainly are privacy issues involved in using windows and other
microsoft products, something that people who are in the know (true
security professionals... if you're really interested, subscribe to the
bugtraq mailing list on www.securityfocus.com) are looking at every day.

Trust me on this, if you follow those instructions, you could be very
sorry.

Oh, and there's nothing really nefarious going on there.  It's Windows
doing its thing in its normally brain-dead way.

Subject: [sfraves] new music

all-
    this is what i've gathered from the people who have been cool enough to
give me their opinion on the matter ... DJs just want to know what cames out
on vinyl in one big mass that they can sort out for themselves.
  
since i spend all this time recording and listening to music, i feel like
maybe it would be worth sharing what i see and hear with people who might
not be lucky enough to have immediate access to what comes into the vinyl
stores.

this access to new stuff has been what has fueled my passion for music for
this long, so hopefully i can pass that on.

there are Real Audio clips for like 95% of these at
http://alienrecords.net
if something is missing an audio clip and ya really want to hear it, let me
know at grant@virtualmediahost.com and i'll make sure it gets up there.

thanks-
grant stevens

I won't mention any names because the little bitch know's who he is. =

anyone, no need for that. The person I am talking to will know if they =

Subject: [sfraves] $25 for a UG...follow the yellow brick road

Hey, Shane.  We've definitley had this all wrong.  Instead of
guestlisting, or $10 parties, we should have been charging $25
(minimium) a head all along.

Full lighting, visuals, great talent...and we've only been charging $10
or so.  Boy, are we looking like silly gooses right now.

Silly me,

next time, how about we skip out on the full intelligent lighting, lasers
and second room?

i think that will allow us to up our price to at *least* $20...

I should have mentioned that it was my personal
perception

I lived there 98-99

Toilets
The banking industry
Telecommunications
Public broadcasting (4 public TV stations!)
I was in Scotland, so the food wasn't the greatest
The IT industry
The educational system did seem a bit off, but I
know nothing about the under college level
I wasn't impressed with the transportation
infrastructure (roads, etc)

I should have mentioned the quality of life seemed 
better - less mindless consumerism

A German friend of mine bitched all of the time b/c
of certain things that drove him nuts - Germany 
sounded fairly advanced from what he said

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Why are there so many haters in SF

you know why!!!
some people got burned , threw a show bombed and
looking around asking why, wanted to get a gig looked
at the line up and wonder why... why not me?? 
its classic self pitty, immature bull shit AND i dont
even know what happened, but i know i see it a lot.
its not personal, people arent that dumb, when someone
talks shit the other person is bound to think.. 'wow,
i wonder what he / she thinks / says about me' its
that basic, when you have so much anger and resentment
it shows and it sucks for you cuz now everyone knows
you are a pathetic petty looser.

I was going to say something about it, but since I am new to the list, don't

Guys,

Please don't follow the instructions on this web site.  I've read through
this tutorial and this person doesn't actually have much clue as to what
they are talking about and some of their instructions will possibly damage
your install of windows or programs that you use.

There certainly are privacy issues involved in using windows and other
microsoft products, something that people who are in the know (true
security professionals... if you're really interested, subscribe to the
bugtraq mailing list on www.securityfocus.com) are looking at every day.

Trust me on this, if you follow those instructions, you could be very
sorry.

Oh, and there's nothing really nefarious going on there.  It's Windows
doing its thing in its normally brain-dead way.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Why are there so many haters in SF

ummm mmmkay..

I dont follow your posts but if you have some bitching to do to someone then 
do it to there face or at least make sure they are on the list. (I.E 
Yarrow,Vlad,Gianni  I big fuck you etc..) Mind you I dont have anything 
against the people in said brackets just the first names that were in my 
head that I know for a fact are on this list.

Your post does not point to anything in paticular just ramblings if you ask 
me, and the reason I even read it cause it had "SF" in the title and like 
most on the list if there are wrong doings by a group, bring them to our 
attention with specific facts and not bullshit opinions.

Not trying to get on your shit just as a memeber of this virtual space I 
don't see any specific point to it unless I missed the first part of the 
thread or your point?

Peace,
Macadio

let me get this straight.  You don't have a clue what happened, yet somehow 
it fits some kind of pattern you've already developed?  Why even bother 
posting?  You *know* you don't know what you're talking about?

I know where the guy is coming from in general here. Venting. Pure release
from frustration and anger to a faceless wall of email addy's. I've done it
and it wasn't in my best interests to do so, but it did make sense at the
time. I can't condone it, but I can't knock it either since I've done it.
Side note - I need more caffeine.

I heard through some friends that managed to avoid the $20 ticket price,
that moms were all pickin up the kidz in minivans around 12p.. then I guess
it got a bit more civil.. but wtf.. lmaorotf.. centech has been throwing a

I can tell you that technologically, England is as advanced as here.  Wanna
see a 2nd world country go to rural Germany.  Remember the size of the
country and also the fact that it has been civilized and was the leader of
the free world until the end of World War II.  Remember your perceptions may
be askew because you do live in one of the most technologically advanced
countries in the world.  But good god, don't ever think England isn't nearly
as advanced as the US, just because you don't see it all over the place like
you do here in America.

I should have mentioned that it was my personal
perception

I lived there 98-99

Toilets
The banking industry
Telecommunications
Public broadcasting (4 public TV stations!)
I was in Scotland, so the food wasn't the greatest
The IT industry
The educational system did seem a bit off, but I
know nothing about the under college level
I wasn't impressed with the transportation
infrastructure (roads, etc)

I should have mentioned the quality of life seemed
better - less mindless consumerism

A German friend of mine bitched all of the time b/c
of certain things that drove him nuts - Germany
sounded fairly advanced from what he said

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TO  HAPPYCORE HATERS

He that was the girl I babysit, and Ryan got it a little wrong. She actually
DIDN'T like it, but I made her listen to it anyway because it was funny to see
how she'd get all mad and tell me to turn it off.  And she was 6... She does
like making candy though and one time when "One More Time" came on she says,
"Oh I love this song!" That kinda scared me...  She's a pop kid I think. I
don't have a problem with happycore personally, I used to like it alot but have
grown out of it, however I can still understand both points of view.

My horoscope this month says I need to be more like my Alter Ego and less like
my Ego.... Hmmmm....

Are there any Gamers or wannabe Gamers on the list?  Do you play Quake III,
Unreal Tournament or Counter Strike?  If so hit me back, as I know of a web
café that wants to start leagues in these games, both Free For All
Individual and Team based leagues.  The place is called WebLightning and is
located on Pier 39 in the heart of Fisherman's Warf in San Francisco and
they have 50 Pentium III based workstations with Flat Panel Displays and it
actually is a great place to game or surf the internet.  For more
information on the café check out their website:
http://www.weblighgningcafe.com and for more information on Game Night and
gaming leagues hit me back with an email.

um,no.  But my opinion may stem from deep personal
problems with British Telecom

and the social infrastructure did not seem as
integrated as it seems (to me) in America.  It was
more like little things that drove me nuts - I did not
say UK == India  (now i am really going to get it...)

And I did say the quality of life was better

you're an expatriot, then?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TO  HAPPYCORE HATERS

Oops - Guess the younger kids have a better taste in music these days. Well
the Daft Punk part is played out, but what do you expect when it's used in
titty support ads? Lydia is a HHC lover. She made me listen to Happy to B
Hardcore Vol 3 (that's right isn't it?) I made a really bad HHC song 2 years
ago as a joke. Used the Teletubbies theme and ripped the beat from HHC
Tetris and then added some Keoki - Speed Racer (porno remix) and a simple
loop done in Rebirth. That was my intro to using Acid Looping Tools and
dumb, but fun hour project. It did however reinforce that there isn't much
going on musically. That's my gripe. Yes it's *fun* and if I was drunk I'd

I will have to agree...Our group and myself were very disappointed with this
horrible party. I can not believe they charged $25 bucks at the door. I was
under the impression the vets hall was two rooms so I paid the $25 bucks
hoping to get a good show. On the bright side Ron Reeser spun a good set to
bad it was all old old tracks. In conclusion this crew is going no where
fast with these kids of over priced parties. I sure as hell wont have
anything good to say next time they put something together..

Do you dig drum n bass? I have a vs. mix with Oracle online courtesy of us-jungle.com. Its about 5 months old
though.  You can download it here www.jestone.iwarp.com/mixes.htm
I also have a newer mix on cd, but I have no where to upload it online. If you or anyone knows of any servers thats 
offering enough free space to host an mp3 download, please let me know.  Thanks...

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Is the UK a 2nd world country?

No, I just get tired of people who travel to abroad and when things are not
like the US they rag on them.  For being so advanced, it is amazing how
Europe laughs at us because of our childish behaviors when it comes to
technology.  I have seen the behind the scenes things that you might not
have since I worked for a technology company and saw the behind the scenes
things.  Americans tend to take for granted what they have and then when
they go abroad and it is different or not as convenient as they are used to
they call them second world...  If there is ANY European country that is
close to being second world it would have to be Germany because of the years
that it was divided and the soviet union raped the country..

um,no.  But my opinion may stem from deep personal
problems with British Telecom

and the social infrastructure did not seem as
integrated as it seems (to me) in America.  It was
more like little things that drove me nuts - I did not
say UK == India  (now i am really going to get it...)

And I did say the quality of life was better

you're an expatriot, then?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Is the UK a 2nd world country?

Having lived in both countries I can say that depending where you are in
either country, it's the same.  I'd say London is about as technologically
advanced as the SF Bay Area.  OK, so the roads are a bit narrow over there,
but they definitely have a better train system!!  And they came out with a
fully digital cellphone system waaay b4 here.  However, it is nice to have
good, cheap internet access here!!  However, all in all, they're about the
same.  In addition, if you were to go to Dorklestshire England, and Bumfukk
Nowhere USA, you'de probably notice similarities in the extent to which they
are undeveloped.  Conclusion:  both these places vary equally from a 1st to
a 2nd world country.

Now, if you really want to argue something, look at the media:  Is it evil
and indecent to display on the telly a nipple or more than a quarter of a
butcrack (the US) or someone getting shot and over 15 minutes of commercials
in one go (the UK)

Well, wherever you are from, electronic music is universal, so keep the love
alive!!

um,no.  But my opinion may stem from deep personal
problems with British Telecom

and the social infrastructure did not seem as
integrated as it seems (to me) in America.  It was
more like little things that drove me nuts - I did not
say UK == India  (now i am really going to get it...)

And I did say the quality of life was better

you're an expatriot, then?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Is the UK a 2nd world country?

PS.  The name Dorklestshire came out of my ass.  It has nothing to do with
Sir Dapy of Dorkdom, who sounds like a pretty cool guy who has his stuff
figured out =)  Also, I apologise to any residents of Dorklestshire, UK as
well as Bumfukk Nowhere, USA if either of those two places actually do
exist.

Subject: [sfraves] THE MONKEYS RETURN!!!

Last Friday Twelve Monkeys returned with "Little House" at a new, improved 
venue but with that old house vibe.

When I heard that the new venue was to be Club Decibel on Market I confess 
I was a bit surprised.  I haven't been to any parties there, but from what 
I heard from friends this was an upscale venue with a clubber dress 
code.  Little House with a dress code?  This was a horrifying concept, 
indeed.  But one never knows these days.

I really wanted to dance again to the amazing Donald Glaude, as well as 
Eddie Amador.  What to do?  I needed my house music fix, and 
desperately.  But anyone who knows me knows that I wear gear to dance and 
sweat in, not designer appearance-oriented wear.

I searched my closet for clothes that might pass the muster at an upscale 
club.  I came up with a black shirt and cargos that could pass as 
"slacks."  But no shoes.  Like, I don't buy Prada.  I have boots.  I have 
skate and other shoes for dancing.  And I have a couple pairs of "business" 
shoes I wear on those rare occasions when I must appear in a suit.  But 
these shoes are so uncomfortable I couldn't see attempting to dance in them 
to Glaude.  So I found a pair of black skate shoes, buffed them up so that 
they might look like dress shoes, and hoped for the best.

Ah, me of little faith.  To think that my friends at Twelve Monkeys would 
force me to dance to house in a dress-code environment.  One look at the 
line waiting to get in and I knew things would be as they were and should 
be.  One comes to a house music party to dance, not to be seen in 
fashionable clothes.

We arrived in time for the beginning of Amador's rockin' set, a combination 
of old favorites and some new beats.  Yes, house is a "spiritual thing," as 
well as a physical thing.  Everyone was up and dancin' for "House 
Music."  I positioned myself right in front of the DJ booth and danced for 
nearly the whole two hours of Eddie.  Just stopped to take a break for a 
smoke and some brew.

Then Glaude.  Now, I like to train spot as well as dance, so I got up right 
next to the turntables before the set change 'cause I really wanted to 
watch the master closely.  Well, when Glaude took the tables it was like a 
Dionysian frenzy up there.  Everyone rushed the tables cheering and waving 
arms wildly.  The experience was almost like a mosh pit.  There was such a 
press that the turntables skipped twice from the throng bumping into the 
table at the beginning of the set.  All good, though.  Donald smiled, and 
for the most part everyone was as respectful as they could be in those 
close quarters.

Close it was, and hot.  Everyone sweatin' and dancin' wildly, arms in the 
air.  I spent almost an hour body to body with the other dancers -- and we 
danced as one, literally.  Was no other way.  It was exhilarating and, lord 
knows, intimate.  And sweaty.  And ecstatic.  I reached that very desirable 
level where you are absolutely one with the music and the others.  No 
thought.  Just feeling the beats and the bodies.  Really excellent:)

Glaude was, as usual, f__ckin' extraordinary.  Last time I danced to his 
house was back in January.  This set was totally different from what he 
spun back then.  Fresh, surprising.  Went directly to my tribal spirit.  A 
lot of the new music was like the old experiments in hip house.  Glaude had 
an amazing guy rapping over the PA to da' house/break beats and it, for me, 
was not only a welcome change but more evidence that house is a vital and 
evolving genre.  Back to the roots, and something new comes forth.  Glaude 
is not predictable.  Nor is the house music genre.

I watched Glaude's facial expressions as he mixed.  When building into a 
new record his eyes were distant, facial expression that of a person 
listening for a message from the gods.  Then, when the music was right he 
smiles and launches into his arm-waving interactions with the crowd.  Each 
new record is displayed in the air, a la Keoki, and dropped on the 
table.  Anticipation and fulfillment.

The vibe at Twelve Monkeys was that funky, lovin', respectful househead 
family ambiance.  All the old crowd was there.  As well as some new 
blood.  Much happiness for me, for sure.

My friend Ben Davis from Housewares was spinning some wicked house 
upstairs.  Unfortunately,  he was up against Glaude downstairs.  Ben is a 
worthy DJ and a passionate househead.

Props to Aaron and the Twelve Monkeys crew for bringing Little House back 
to the house party mix.  Deeply missed you guys, and it was hugs and love 
all around.  Great party, the new venue works for me, and I'm happy the 
tribe is back together again.  Looking forward to next month.

Love,


Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) my friend is out of jail!  but support still needed for other genoa protesters

i had written last week asking for support to help get
my friend andy, who was arrested w/ the publix theatre
caravan, out of jail in genoa.  i just wanted to
follow up and thank everyone who wrote any letters or
called the italian embassy or anything and to let
everyone know he's out!  yay!  i am very, very
relieved, although i believe he still faces charges. 
it's really hard to deal w/ someone you know dealing
w/  torture and abuse in prison so i'm really, really
glad he's ok.  

however, there are still people in jail from the
protests, including some friends of my friend in
germany.  there's going to be a marathon performance
festival on thursday eve. in front of the italian
consulate (broadway and webster streets, in pacific
heights) from 4pm to midnight to keep the issue in the
public eye and to help pressure the italian government
to release all the other prisoners.  the theme is "art
is not a crime."  (since the publix theatre people are
a theatre troupe.)  

below is more information.  since this was written,
the publix theatre people have been released. 
however, as noted above, they still face charges, and
their are also at least 25 other people still in jail
from the protests.  (and so far the death toll is up
to at least 3.)  
ART IS NOT A CRIME
A PERFORMANCE MARATHON TO
RELEASE PUBLIX THEATRE CARAVAN 
& ALL GENOA/G8 ACTIVISTS FROM 
ITALIAN JAIL & DROP ALL CHARGES
THURS. AUG. 23, 4pm-Midnight
Italian Consulate, 2590 Webster @ Broadway,SF
(6 blocks W. of Van Ness on Broadway)
Theater, dance, spoken word performance, including:
Dance Brigade, Samsara, Keith Hennessy , Art and
Revolution Street Theater Collective, Gravity Physical
Theater, Village Culture, Tango for Protest, Folk
This!, Body Cartography, Teli Carduci, Drew Dellinger,
Dan McCale aka John WTO, fire artists, DJs, and many,
many  more.
Bring: art, music, theater, dance, words, friends...

At midnight we will sendoff the Bay Area Caravan  to
Borderhack, a three day Festival near Tijuana to
"Delete the Border" (there is still space-bring a bag
if you want to go. info www.de-lete.tv/borderhack)

On Monday July 24, the Publix Theatre Caravan, an
international multimedia performance group, was
stopped and 25 performers (and their dog Pogo) were
arrested and beaten by Italian police near Genoa,
Italy. The group had performed at the G8 protests in
Genoa, as part of a European tour, using theater to
express their belief in ending internment and
deportations and creating a world with out borders or
nations . They were arrested in the wake of the brutal
police  repression which resulted in at least one
death during the G8 Summit. The imprisoned group
includes Bay Area activist/performer Andy, who has
worked locally with Reclaim Mayday, Food Not Bombs and
Reclaim the Streets. Publix Theater Caravan  is group
of  artists, musicians , actors, independent media
workers and experimental theater  activists from
Austria, US, Slovakia, Germany, Australia, and Sweden.
The group is accused of vandalism, endangering public
safety and being  the core of the "black bloc," due to
the presence of stage  props, a black bra and several
black T-shirts amongst their belongings.  Twenty
members of the group were released last week as a
result of international publc pressure, but 19 of them
still face charges and up to 15 years in prison. Five
members of Publix Theater and over twenty other
activists remain in jail.This is part of an escalation
of repression against polical street theater and the
anti-corporate globalization movement in North America
and Europe repression which continues even more
severely in the Global South and in communities of
color in the North.

well, there's travel abroad for two weeks and then there is live there.
I have no patience for the people who go for two weeks and think they've
"done" Europe - and then there's the "AMERICA!!! rah Rah RAH" kneejerk
position which really ticks me off.  I think you're talking about that

But when you live there, you do notice the little differences - social
ones certainly.  Most of it is probably coming from the fish out of the
water feeling, but aspects of the uk could be better  (america too, certainly)

and I never said I didn't like it there.  Just that certain creature
comforts could be better (but they go hand in hand with rampant consumerism)

>For being so advanced, it is amazing how
>Europe laughs at us because of our childish behaviors when it comes to

huh?  I would say they laugh at us because of our provincial immature
social attitudes (e.g. violence for entertainment is acceptable vs. all
the fuss over NYPD Blue's showing of a naked ass, under 21s can't drink at all
etc)  I have a post somewhere from a guy who went to Italy and he absolutely
could not get his friends over there to grasp the concept that under 21s
weren't
allowed in bars at all or that teenagers couldn't drink low alcohol beverages.
It may have been a bit of a language barrier, but they couldn't grasp that
a father couldn't take his 17 yr old son to a pub and buy him a alcoholic
lemonade.
The concept of alcohol as this forbidden evil thing was just incomprehensible

well, i'm an engineer and i know how things could be better.  Different

sophistication
(i.e. knowing what the possibilities are)?

East Germany, sure.  But my friend (West German) was quite ticked with

What platform is your server?
If its nt, I can help, otherwise you can try checking
http://www.cgi-resources.com/ for any cgi scripts. Usually if you have
enough control over the server, you can block certain ip address under
admin. Controls.

about 75% of e-mails off of sfraves have nothing to do with sfraves!!!!
and I've seen very few NRRs (not that it would be a bad idea, but real
men/women don't filter sfraves...)

and this was a little more relevant to the general populace of sfraves than
that favorite vegetable thread sometime ago...

Subject: [sfraves] trees n beats was what i needed :)

hey everyone :)  trees n beats was so mellow and relaxing...... it
was such a great weekend!  it was my first time at camp and sons, and
man, that place is so awesome...... i could totally live there and
just eat food from the garden all day :)  there wasn't as many people
there as i expected, but it was nice 'cause it gave it a real
intimate vibe...... i felt like i knew everyone there by the time the
weekend was over :)  got to meet some really cool people......
knowmad (who i've been talking to forever, but never met), rachel
(only got to talk to her for a minute, but she's so nice!), hula girl
julie (i just happened to be camping *right* next to her), and i
found out too late that i was also camping right next to magick, so
i'll have to chat it up with him next time :)  the music was really
great, too, and i was totally diggin' that reggae band friday
night...... i didn't know there was going to be any live instrument
bands there.  anyway, all in all it was an awesome weekend that
totally mellowed me out :)  i'll probably be at ascension this week
with my little sister who's visiting from out of town, so i'll see
you all there.......

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re: TO HAPPYCORE HATERS

Okay, since the beginning of this thread, this has been reall bugging me.

"FIRST WORLD": Western Bloc: USA, France, *UK*, Germany, Japan, and all
those allies, etc, etc
"SECOND WORLD": Soviet/Communist Bloc: USSR, China, Cuba, etc
"THIRD WORLD": Everything else

I can't remember who coined the terms, but they have very specific,
originally created to seperate the two sides in the cold war, the US and
its allies, the USSR and its allies, and finally, all the countries who
aren't in either of the first two "worlds".

So, in other words, this whole discussion about the UK being a "Second
World" country was inane to begin with.

    Tuesday August 21st

         Teknique

    in association with

        Selekta.com

        brings you                                               [Image]

        Electromajk

      plus your hosts

    Dragn'fly + DJ Pat

 Once again in our quest to bring you all things techy, we bring you
 another major force of innovation on the global scene.  Tune in from
 1pm to 4pm PST to catch a super special Wet & Hard set from Czech hero
 Electromajk along with live mixing from hosts Dragn'fly & DJ Pat.

 To tune in click here:

 http://www.selekta.com/multimedia/teknique.asp


 This mix from Electromajk is deep as fuck and loaded with the insane
 amount of sexual energy that only an Eastern European could deliver.
 For those unfamilar with the Wet & Hard movement, it is a new breed of
 post-techno techno.  To some It is the sound of the pornoground, to
 others it is simply sexmusic.  Regardless of the adjectives used, it
 is the secret sound of your imagination.  Wet & Hard is hot kunst,
 supa-stylish, state of the art club music for a hot new generation of
 ever-so-slightly exhibitionistic no-holes-barred clubbers. Music for
 all those, whose adventurous lives have become endangered, through the
 unimaginative low grade tediousness of tv-trance.   Wet & Hard is a
 techno-fantasy release of harddrive beats combined with sexually
 soaked bouncy basses,  all pumping and pounding, creating a throbbing,
 thrusting, thumping, thrilling... thingy...errmmm ... sensation???
 Whatever, it´s music to make her wet and him hard!

  [Image]The music has been becoming more popular every day with
         releases and remixes by Oliver Klein, Corvin Dalek, Alex
 Flatner, etc finding homes on major labels throughout Europe, but the
 main force behind the movement is the sex driven nightclubs of Eastern
 Europe.   It is here that the DJs crafted their own sound that is
 slowly taking over the world and it is with great pleasure that Radio
 Teknique will be presenting a series of shows focusing on Eastern
 Europe's top club DJs and their drive to inject techno with an
 overdose of sexuality.

 Our first installment will highlight Prague's Electromajk, a recent
 addition to the MFS family.  He is quickly becoming a major player on
 the European club scene playing regularly in places like Berlin, Ibiza
 and Malta along with regular appearances in his hometown.   His
 reputation is top notch with both clubbers and DJs alike and we think
 you will see why after listening to the show.

 For more information on him, please check out

 http://www.electromajk.com

 For those of you unfamiliar with the show, Radio Teknique is a weekly
 internet broadcast hosted by Dragn'fly and DJ Pat featuring electronic
 music on the techy side of things (you may even hear some tech-polka
 now and then!).   For more information about the show (such as past
 guests, future guests, playlists, etc) or to listen, please visit:

 http://www.selekta.com/multimedia/teknique.asp

 Listening requires realplayer G2....if you don't have it, get it
 here:  http://www.real.com

 For more information about your hosts, please check out:

 http://www.djdragnfly.com
 http://www.dj-pat.com

 During the show, we can be reached via AIM at RadioTeknique so feel
 free to give us a hollah, request your favorite tech-polka choon, talk
 shit, etc!

 P.S. : We are terribly sorry for all of the technical delays we have
 had trying to get AndyW on the show.  We actually have it all worked
 out now and will be featuring him soon!!!

 P.P.S.  We will not be broadcasting on the 28th because we will both
 be at Burning Man, but we will resume the following week with a
 special set from a very special artist (can you say live at the Love
 Parade???)  Lookout world...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Release review Sat 18th???

Deep Dish was off the hook. I didn't make into any of
the other rooms. I was there for one reason...DEEP
DISH. The music was slamming....typical to what you
would here on any of there cd's. The crowd was mixed
and seemed to enjoy what they heard. 
There was only one thing that annoyed me
though....people with cameras. I understand the two
that we there taking pictures for magazines...but
those other people who were camped out in front of the
dj's just snapping away. I was there to party and
dance my arse off, but every couple of minutes it was
like excuse me....can I take a picture? I swear for at
least an hour there was none stop flashing. 
One thing that I saw that was freaking cool was people
asking Deep Dish for an autograph. Can you beleive it,
a dj being asked for his autograph? Cooooool!! Hell, I
would have asked for one, but was to busy getting my
groove on....
In all, it was a blast. It was nice to see Deep Dish
again and I can't wait till the next time. Anyone else
go?

Maybe I just want to bitch.... but how does "less mindless consumerism"
directly lower the quality of life? Are you fucking kidding me? Are you a
socialist or something? Personally and IMO, my daily mindless consumerism
raises the quality of life for *me*. I know that much. Maybe you just dont
has as much disposable income or maybe you truely believe that buying toys
and presents for yourself somehow makes you less happy, but if I couldnt buy
as much crap as I do I would be *less* satisfied. I mean, seriously, if I
wasnt able to buy as much stuff dont you think I'd be more likelly to be
upset with my quality of life??!???!??

People who say idiotic things like, "I'm against organized religion. I'm a
Wiccan." Here's a hint... You said Wiccan and I knew precisely what you
meant. My definition of religion: "Belief that things that are not real are
as important or more important than the real concrete world in which we
live." Don't try to throw some pretentious dogshit at me about "How do you
know what's real" or I'll slap you in the head. "Feel that? Well that's the
REAL world." Believe in something supernatural? Does at least one other
person share the same belief? Do people who share this belief have a
collective name? THEN YOU'RE IN AN ORGANIZED RELIGION, DUMBASS! Stop trying
to be trendy.

Subject: [sfraves] More on Trees N Beats


Trees N Beats WAS awesome!  Great vibe, location, and music.  
Props out to the people who put it on... including some help from the 
Humboldt kids representing.  Dj Touch and Dj Receiver from Arcata 
finished the party off with tight sets.  Right before them Christian 
Clark played a sick-ass set  (I think some older tracks thrown in).  
Also props to Alanzo earlier in the night.... his shit took me there!

A great night for star gazing, too!  No moon to obstruct and no city 
lights.  We had the milky way and a million stars to go with our trees 
and beats!  Thanks for the fun time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] trees n beats was what i needed :)

Mornin All!

trees n beats was absolutely mystical in it's beauty....if you didn't go you
certainly missed out - I was smiling so hard the whole weekend I thought I
was gonna sprain a cheek muscle or something.  Many thanks to all of the
down to earth ppl I came into contact with.  Heya envirogirl email me for a
link to the next campout I'm going to I would love to hang out with you &
your grinning crew some more~~~~ I figure that I might as well go out in a
blaze of camp out glory!!!

I will tell you my evil plot--->  I was hoping to entice you, our local SFR
poet Laith, the radient Julie the hula girlie, and the ever entertaining
knowmadae into creating our own SFR campsite.

By the way I wanted to thank all you for treating my brother Wesley so nice!
It was his first party and since he always feels socially inept it was nice
to see him placed in a situation where everyone was accepting and
encouraging him to be part of it all.  He was quote unquote touched by the
outward friendliness and giving sense of our community.  If Steve is out
there I want to let you know that I saw him last night and he has been
wearing that visor you gave him non-stop since you placed it upon his little
newbie head on Sat. night!!!!  ohh the love!

all smiles till the next time ;)

<>rachel<>

p.s.  just wanted to send out another thank you to Laith for the personal
book of poetry which was tucked beneath my pillow when I woke up in the
garden.

Of course, you should be able to be just as happy and content with your

Yes, I'm serious. What the hell are you talking about? You don't SERIOUSLY
think I, or 99% of the American population that lives in urban areas would
*actually* be happy living in the forest with not plumbing or electricity,
do you? They have retreats out in the wilderness for people who think that
they want to live out in the wild with basically 0 technology, and guess
what? 99% of THOSE people can't handle it and go back home to their hot
water, fresh food and A/C! Maybe you're just an optomist, but you are also
lacking common sense. Sure I'll give that you can be perfectly happy withOUT
"senseless consumerism", but to say that I'd be perfectly happy moving from
a city to the middle of the woods and shitting on the ground and bathing in
cold water is recockulous. Not to mention the fact I would die in like 1
week. If you call that a good standard of living you can start handing your
paycheck over to me and I'll buy you a couple acres of BFE forest and then
you can tell me how happy you are. Also, what the hell do you mean by
"you're on the fast track to get scrouge."?? Scrouge isnt even a noun!!!

scrouge \Scrouge\, v. t. [Etymol. uncertain.] To crowd; to squeeze. [Prov.
Eng. & Colloq. U.S.]

I guess when you live in the forest you dont have books or dictionaries,
either!

If you did build a party fortress as soon as the government realizes that
they arnt in control of whats going on inside your fortress. They would
probibly declair you  public threat, and would deal with you accordingly.
One way to deal with public threats is to bun parts of there compounds and
drive tanks threw the walls in order to deliver tear gass. God would I hate
to think about being in attendence when that venue got busted. Just remember
police thrive on control it doesnt really matter how much you resist cause
the more force it takes to gain control happily for them the more force they
get to use.

I think it is a well produced track sounds very good. Not my kind of music

No, that's not what I said.  I said should be able to be happy and content, 
not that one would instantly find that.  I wouldn't be suprised if you died 
in the woods, that doesn't mean you can't live there.

site is CGI generated, it will be a rathar icky mess to get it all to work
right.

The much easier and faster way is to just drop the IP block you want to
disallow in /etc/hosts.deny

It won't stop a determined attacker (the tend to have access to alternate IPs),
but it'll stop the casual schmuck.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Rooms available at the doofhouse.

[For those of you that have not heard of the doofhouse, it's where I live.
In the past, it's been the home of various people who are very active in
the scene, including names that you know like Shane & Amber.  Other folks
have been very involved with CloudFactory and FnF.]

http://doof.averystylish.net/

All,

We have a few rooms at DoofHouse that have opened up, and we'd like to
fill them ASAP.  This home has become something very special certainly to
myself as a newcomer, but as equally to those who've lived here, and the
immediate and extended friends and family (both near and far) who have
enjoyed it's comforts.  

Our little community of 8 (James and Alyssa in the garden apt, Bobby in
the upstairs studio, and the 5 of us in the main house) have had a
wonderful run, but change has come rumblin' down the road again as it
inevitably does, and we're having a total of 3 move-outs in the next month
(one in less then 1 week).  We have two spots that are available immediately.

We are looking for 3 mature, communicative, creative individuals who can
hang with our unique and odd quasi-whatever-collectiveesque ravergeekfreak
household/vibe.  Exactly what this means and how it manifests has been a
dynamic continually created by the entire household, but there are
certainly some themes:
 1) While we go to parties and make them happen, we don't want to live in
    one.  Our home is our refuge.  
 2) Various kinds of dance music and it's expression are central aspects to
    most of our lives; some of us are musicians & DJs, and some of us
    involved in lighting or sound production.  SEE #1
 3) We respect eachother and our home
 4) We do our own chores
 5) We talk to eachother
 6) Addictive behavior not tolerated

This is not a good place for recluses or TV zombies, though we reserve the
right to engage in such activities on occasion, and that's cool!

But enough about what we want!

We are located in the Portola neighborhood in the southern corner or San
Francisco, on Hamilton & Silliman (5 blocks from the 101S Silver Avenue
exit).  The common amenities run thicker then the hair on the Wack A Mole
Champion's Hand:

  * DSL
  * Pissin' Boy Fountain - NOW!  With Live Fish, Lilies, and Crawdad!
  * Square Block Rec Center across the street
  * Trellised Sun & Fun Deck (Ivy not included)
  * Fairie/Art Garden
  * Killer kitchen
  * Beautiful Hardwood floors throughout
  * Butloads of curbside parking

Subject: [sfraves] *WOW =) Feelin' the Trees, Feelin' the Beats*

Oh My Goodness! what a Beautiful weekend! i am at a loss for words! 
the ~~VIBE~~ was in full effect yo'!! =) i really needed a small, laid back party to balance everything out that i've been doing, and that's what i got! i mean being in Vegas the weekend before wearing my platform shoes, clubbing, and gambling....and then being at TreesnBeats wearing my slippers getting my feet dirty, eating organic food, and breathing in the fresh air.....wow! what a contrast!! hehheeee! 
everyone, literally everyone was soooooooo friendly! i met so many cool Sfravers-Envirogirl, Rachel, Knowmad (sp.?), Michael , the REd stickman, Dreg, caught up with Laith ( thanks for the wonderful Poetry book-it's awesome!) you guys rock! let's all party again! =) =)
basically, the party was so refreshing-i danced so hard on Saturday night, me and my sis and friends were dancing behind the visuals having a great time! it looked so cool seeing people behind there! and it was so cool just seeeing people dance and go off =) 
man! it felt sooo good just to be dancing outside,no rave funk, just feelin' it , kickin' sand!! =) 
all the djs were good, it was nice listening to some mellow downtempo beats in the day, then hearing harder beats later on in the night =) 
what about that spot??? ** just Georgeous hah??!! ** 
the pond, garden, the clean drinkable water....ahhhhhhh =) =) 
i heard FnF was awesome the week before too =) 
well, all in all the party was sweet and i'm looking forward to next year! 
i'm glad to hear ya'll had a good time-our staff worked hard-mad props to everyone, especially Veronica and Arturo! 
always spreading the Aloha and Plur>>>>love, Hula girl Julie =) =) **muah**
ps: OMG!! guess who i met??!!! Dimitri!! the guy from Groove!!!! i was so **starstruck**! hehheheee! he's the one holding the disco ball in the poster =) he's super cool and wacky =)  I LOVE GROOVE!! so this was one of the biggest highlights of the trip! hahhaa!
           P         L          U           R

People who say idiotic things like, "I'm against organized religion. I'm a
Wiccan." Here's a hint... You said Wiccan and I knew precisely what you
meant. My definition of religion: "Belief that things that are not real are
as important or more important than the real concrete world in which we
live." Don't try to throw some pretentious dogshit at me about "How do you
know what's real" or I'll slap you in the head. "Feel that? Well that's the
REAL world." Believe in something supernatural? Does at least one other
person share the same belief? Do people who share this belief have a
collective name? THEN YOU'RE IN AN ORGANIZED RELIGION, DUMBASS! Stop trying
to be trendy.

Subject: [sfraves] FW: ACLU files Class Action Lawsuit in Defense of Rave Culture (EM:DEF News)

-----> Please FORWARD this message <-----

Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund
August 21st, EM:DEF 2001 Newsletter

1. ACLU files Class Action Lawsuit and Motion Challenging New Orleans
Plea Agreement
2. Midwest Music Summit a Success
3. Electronic Music Cultural Alliance strengthens Indianapolis Rave
Scene
4. Turning the Tables - Work With Your School
5. Donate to EM:DEF

1. ACLU files Class Action Lawsuit and Motion Challenging New Orleans
Plea Agreement
	The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against Attorney General John
Ashcroft along with a motion for a temporary restraining order and
preliminary injunction in New Orleans today.  Arguing that the plea
agreement in United States v. Barbecue of New Orleans is the result of a
coordinated effort to eliminate rave culture, the ACLU requested an
injunction barring enforcement of a ban on glowsticks, pacifiers, chill
rooms, massage tables and other items listed in the plea agreement.  The
class action lawsuit lists three plaintiffs, and others like them, who
were deprived of their first amendment rights to freedom of expression
as a result of the plea agreement.

The lawsuit and motion assert that all items banned under the plea
agreement are protected under the first amendment, that none of the
items could be classified as paraphernalia (as defined in the Controlled
Substances Act), that rehearsed dancing is a protected form of free
speech, and that the government cannot require a private business to
enforce policies which deprive a third party of their constitutional
rights (even as a condition of a plea agreement).

A Federal Judge is expected to rule on the motion for a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction before Friday, when The
State Palace Theater will host a rave event.  The event marks the one
year anniversary of a DEA raid on the Theater, a raid that ultimately
led to a Federal Indictment of Robert and Brian Brunet as well as Donnie
Estopinal under the Crackhouse Statute.  If the judge grants the ACLU's
motion, partygoers will once again be allowed to dance with glow sticks
- leading many to predict a turnout of ravers glowing as they've never
glowed before:-)

The lawsuit and motion can be viewed in their entirety on our web-site
at:
http://www.emdef.org/library_law.html#NewOrleans

The ACLUs press release can be viewed at:
http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n082101a.html

2.  Midwest Music Summit a Success:
	Indianapolis hosted the Midwest Music Summit from August 10th to the
12th.  The summit gave electronic music a significant credibility in the
eyes of public officials who have declared a war against rave parties.
Scarab Records organized the summit, which featured regional Hip-Hop,
Rock and Electronic Music artists.  The conference drew A&R
representatives from several major record labels, along with many other
professionals.  Expect a growing attendance at next year's summit.

3.  Electronic Music Culture Alliance Strengthens Indianapolis Rave
Scene
Indianapolis has also been organizing a grassroots group to defend raves
against attacks from their Mayor's office.  The Electronic Music Culture
Alliance will file papers to qualify as a Political Action Committee.
They have agreed to meet with the Mayor to discuss ways of preserving
rave culture without legal harassment of promoters.  The Electronic
Music Culture Alliance is one more in a series of successful
organizations forming around the country to protect electronic music.
In years to come, America may come to appreciate electronic music in the
same way Jazz is appreciated today.  To preserve the integrity of our
culture, please consider forming a similar group in your area. With a
dedicated team, a little time and a bit of energy, a lot can be
accomplished.  Visit:

http://www.indyemca.com
  ** this site will go live early next week **

4.  Turning the Tables: Work With Your School
	In June, EM:DEF announced our intention to launch a program bringing
turntables and electronic music production equipment into high school
classrooms.  We've been talking with several people, and it appears we
have a strong candidate who shares the vision and dedication to
accomplish this effort.  With Turning the Tables preparing it's launch,
and with school starting across the country, we are turning to you -
students - for help.  Turning the Tables is seking letters we can show
companies in order to convince them of the merits of the program, and to
donate equipment and operating funds.  We also seeking people to sign up
for the program.  You can find out more about how to help by visiting
our web-site at:

http://www.emdef.org/education.html#HighSchools

5. Donate to EM:DEF
EM:DEF's efforts allowed Donnie Estopinal along with Robert and Brian
Brunet to stay in the fight long enough to provide a plea agreement
which could be challenged on constitutional grounds. Private attorney
fees for the managers and promoters were incurred in New Orleans.
EM:DEF is appealing to you for support in this case, and others which
may follow.

We NEED financial support from people to continue this work. We are
asking that everyone concerned about the future of electronic music, and
the protection of constitutional rights in general, make a donation of
$15 or more to EM:DEF. All donations are fully tax deductable. If you
can donate proceeds from an event, or otherwise contribute, we will
appreciate that support as well.  Learn more...

All other inquiries can be directed to will@emdef.org

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: Is the UK a 2nd world country?

Sir Douglas of Fraser (aka "Treeboy") believes:

> > > I should have mentioned the quality of life seemed
> > > better - less mindless consumerism

And Sir Laurence del Maur provoked discussion with:

>Maybe I just want to bitch.... but how does "less mindless consumerism"
>directly lower the quality of life?

I would like to begin my response by pointing out that Doug used the 
modifier "mindless" in respect to consumerism. In other words, he agrees 
that certain creature comforts are necessary for quality of life, ie, flush 
toilets and running water, but that gold-plated flush toilets and water taps 
are merely an excuse to purchase and not necessary to your personal quality 
of life. Unless of course, you are alergic to all metals except gold and you 
break out in a nasty rash when you touch mere stainless steel.

However, Doug, I have also lived in the UK for extended periods of time. I 
believe that in the middle classes, especially in the more prosperous south 
(ie, London area), mindless consumerism is as rampant as it is here. Witness 
the abundance of cel phones and the redecorating mania.

My view of excessive material goods being necessary for quality of life:

Load of bollocks.

Gie me a f**kin' break. Laurence, do you presume to tell me that Nintendo or 
a dvd player or a newer model car is as necessary to your quality of life as 
having being able to sleep uninterupted, having more food in your house than 
you can eat in one sitting, being able to see and hear and touch the people 
you love? Pop quiz to SFRaves: would you rather have a good night's sleep or 
a razor scooter?

Think about the moments in your life that made you happiest. By yourself or 
with others. Don't friends give you more quality of life than the clothes 
you are wearing?

And, if you think all consumerism is mindless, think again. We all consume, 
but we can become mindful consumers. Buy recycled content paper, reused 
clothing and reusable containers. Buy what you need: food, shelter, some 
clothing.

Close the Gap. Choose life.
K

Subject: [sfraves] ASR day party review

Hey,

Well yeah, I was there on Sunday.. warm in the sun, cool in the shade.. and 
then there was the wind.. early on the canopy over the altar took off, but 
it was rewarded with secure stakings, and it stayed put.  Later on, while 
Tony was mixing, the main canopy decided it was time to go too.  It was 
decided to pack it up, rather than trying to put it back and secure 
it.  Good turnout.. I shoulda counted, but I guesstimate around 60-100 
people were there.  Met some coo peeps, some of which I've already 
forgotten, and the rest I'll slaughter spelling: Dregaron Starlight, 
Michael; the cliff explorer, Greg, Leslie, Martin Randall.. um that's all I 
can think of right now.. The music was great, I don't think one set stands 
out in my mind as being best, but I liked the booty house I heard from 
Crisco and Tony.. I had a good time, even walked around a lil bit and 
noticed there's a huge parking lot full of cop cars near by, a skate park, 
and a large collection of shopping carts surrounded by hills of 
dirt.  Shout outs to Jeremy, Andy, Jessica, and OSBY for keeping me company 
and entertained..

::SNIP::
Don't friends give you more quality of life than the clothes
you are wearing?
::/SNIP
Yes they do and that's why naked friends are evan better for your quality of
life than friends in cloths. I encourage every one to go make a necked
friend if you don't already have one. And if you already have a necked
friend, go make another because it will improve the quality of your life
evan that much more. Everyone should have at least one naked friend but the
surgeon general says that to really make a difference in the quality of your
life you should have 3 or 4 necked friends. Come on every one now lets all
just be naked friends. From the US to the UK to the EU everyone needs a
necked friend.

Yes, but no one has disproved my assertion yet! The original statement was:

> > > > I should have mentioned the quality of life seemed
> > > > better - less mindless consumerism

Which means, logically that:
[more] mindless consumerism = [worse] quality of life.

Which makes no sense!
So, I said:

> >Maybe I just want to bitch.... but how does "less mindless consumerism"
> >directly lower the quality of life?

And someone has yet to prove that more mindless consumerism actually LOWERS
the quality of life. Sure, you dont NEED consumerism to have a high quality
of life, but having more certainly wont lower it! If I have XXX amount of
stuff, and then suddenly I decide to go on a shopping spree and now have
XXXXXX amount of stuff. How am I worse off? If anything I'm better off!
Certainly, in my perspective my quality of life is improved both by the
ability to buy more things and having more things.

Thus, what is implied by the statement "I should have mentioned the quality
of life seemed better - less mindless consumerism" is *bullshit*.

Thanks =)

People who say idiotic things like, "I'm against organized religion. I'm a

meant. My definition of religion: "Belief that things that are not real are
as important or more important than the real concrete world in which we
live." Don't try to throw some pretentious dogshit at me about "How do you
know what's real" or I'll slap you in the head. "Feel that? Well that's the

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ASR day party review

Hell yeah! Love that booty house music! That was a great party. Thanks for the review. I must add my description, though. Poor Osby was hungry that day, and I can't stand to see a hungry dude (maybe cause I'm a southern boy from Texas), so we drove to Raley's. Andy recommended the deli section, and so I bought Osby some Salisbury steak and Mac 'n cheese, and I got poppers, I mean jalapeno peppers breaded and stuffed with cream cheese. Next time I'll buy a bucket of poppers cause Andy wanted some! Now I know what he likes.

You know how one good deed deserves another? It came true because when we returned to the park, there was a choice parking spot near the party. Sunday in any Bay Area park can get crowded; it was great not having to park a mile away.

Anyway, I learned a lesson as well. You can stand around like a wall-flower (at any party, daytime or otherwise), or you can mingle and dance. Osby kept trying to get me to meet people on my own, and I was just chilling, until the music got me and I danced like a fool. I also met Sarilion, Alex, Dreg, Joe, Andy, and other ravers.

There is nothing quite like listening and dancing to music under a clear, beautiful sky with a bountiful breeze, mainly because it's not hot outside, like it can be during an underground (indoor) party. 

Thanks to ASR; I am looking forward to your next party, indoors or outside.

I was there on Sunday.. warm in the sun, cool in the shade.. and 
then there was the wind.. Good turnout.. I shoulda counted, but I guesstimate around 60-100 people were there.  Met some coo peeps.... The music was great, I don't think one set stands out in my mind as being best, but I liked the booty house I heard from Crisco and Tony...

to the contrary.  "mindless consumerism," to me, implies both an absolute 
glut of products of indifferent quality (ergo, "mindless": "mindful" 
consumption would at a minimum entail awareness of relative quality) and the 
equally "mindless" pursuit of "more," regardless of the actual return one 
received from one's consumption.  if you consume tons of crap, you're still 
consuming crap, and IMO the majority of consumer goods on offer nowadays are 
precisely that.

Thus, if the energy expenditure, expense, and stress entailed in "mindless 
consumerism" is not recompensed by the positive value received from the 
items consumed, then the idea that "[more] mindless consumerism = [worse] 
quality of life" is indeed logical, and IMO has been proved repeatedly, both 
in my own experience and my observation of others.

Subject: [sfraves] why more people should formally study dance nrr 

if more people studied dance, or at least attended
dance performances there would be a whole lot less
alcohol 
abuse and drug abuse in the scene. why? because
instead of 
dousing out their insecurities about the gift of
EXPRESSION and MOVEMENT that is the body in motion,
people would
stretch and do breathing exercises to warm up before
hitting 
the floor. also, when i am dancing with a good dancer,
my 
date would cease to think that i am leaving him,
because he would finally have a clue...he still might
have 
to kick that guys assssss though, but probably not.
there is an obvious difference between a man who
dances well 
with a partner, and someone who dances to cop a feel.
the number one difference being, the good dancer is
straight 
up gay quite often. the other guy is just plain,
sweaty, drunk and gross...you know what i mean? he's a
"snazzy" kind of guy in a really bad shirt. you might
want 
to sleep with him though...like, once, because he'll
let you get away with it. :)

Personally I find the act of consumerism itself to be rewarding. There is no
cost / exenditure other than monetary related to the act, because to me, the
act itself is a leisurely activity. Also, because it is leisure I dont think
there is a stress component at all, or if there is it is small enough that
it is innately offset. That is to say that spending time in a mall, oggling
all sorts of shit and using my credit card are innately rewarding in the
same way someone else might find, say, walking in the park rewarding. I
consider it a leisurely activity. And, therefore, if in addition the
products I have mindlessly or mindfully purchased add a value to my life,
that further increases my quality of life. 1) Because the act was rewarding
and 2) the addition to the quantity of items I have has increased. =)

That is just me personally of course, I'm not speaking for anyone else. =)

But, yeah, tons of crap being sold nowadays.... I agree...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ASR day party review

Ok, I've been meaning to write this since Sunday, and you've finally
made me do it!

Another beautiful Sunday afternoon in the park with the ASR family.
Thanks to Tony especially for putting this together, and to all that helped.

It's been a long time since I got out, so it was really great to reconnect
with old friends JeremyB, AndyW, Leslie (you'd have been in trouble if
you hadn't shown up!), Patrice the TeknoDiva (of course!), Isaac, Michael
(the BreadStickman),Usa, Emi and many others. And I put a lot of faces
to names too - that was the best part. I finally got to meet the famous Osby
(Hello2Day!), Sarilion, Dregaron Starlighter (sp?!), GregVP, Alida and
Veronica (hi!) from the HJBC, and of course the delightful Amy T. And
probably others I've missed here. It was really good to be reminded how
much you guys all mean to me (aahhh).

I heard more than I wanted to know about Michael and Dreg's T&B
experiences (ask them!)! And chatting with Dreg about life, the
universe and Tucson was great. And picking people's brains for
recommendations on mixers and turntables (I'm shopping) was
very useful too.

I'd have to say my favorite set of the afternoon was Tracy's - although
it was officially "house only" I think she strayed a little towards the
techno camp, which was alright by me!!

It's funny how that spot always gets the wind - walking back to the
car to get my jacket, cuz I was freezing, as soon as I got out of that
spot it was warm and sunny! Hmm... And having the DJ "booth"
fly away was interesting! Props to whoever was spinning as that
happened for keeping their cool!

So anyway, it was a great party to socialize, chat, get to know one
another, meet new folks and actually be able to carry on a conversation,
and listen to great music at the same time.

Thanks again to the ASR family for another great afternoon in the park!
See you at the next one!

- Martin

Poor Osby was hungry that day, and I can't stand to see a hungry dude (maybe cause I'm a southern boy from Texas), so we drove to Raley's. Andy recommended the deli section, and so I bought Osby some Salisbury steak and Mac 'n cheese, and I got poppers, I mean jalapeno peppers breaded and stuffed with cream cheese. Next time I'll buy a bucket of poppers cause Andy wanted some! Now I know what he likes.

for myself, unless i'm shopping for something i really want/need/am into 
(new CDs, outdoor wear, bike parts, more CDs...) i find the need to get off 
my arse, onto MUNI, and out to the shops to be onerous.  Perhaps i'm too old 
and tired for recreational shopping ;o)

and there's also the additional stress factors outside of the act of 
consumption itself: e.g., how many more hours does one have to 
work/commute/do things you'd rather not do in order to pay for the objects 
of consumption?  and what (time with dear ones, rest time, hot sex, 
contemplation, sleep, and of course dancing!) is one giving up in order to 
perform that labor?

tangentially, this is why the whole cost/benefit analysis approach to 
political issues gives me the Orwellian willies...the result is utterly 
dependent on what one considers as "benefits" and/or acknowledges as 
"costs."

--hb

ow, my brain hurts...i was up burning compilation CDs for my radio show at 
Burning Man until 2AM.  Burners, tune to 90.3 COUAC and listen for the 
strains of the Holiday In Risk Theme...

Ahhh... yes... recreational shopper is probably the best term for what I
describe. I like that. It should be a title. =)

Ah ha! But see, for me, recreational shopping is a reward and the benefit
from having to work so hard to earn all that money. After working so hard
and once I've accumulated this disposable income, what better way to spend
it, relieve stress and inrease my quality of life but mill around at the
mall and spend that money =) That is one of many points where my work
translates into benefit. You see, I'm going to have to do all that hard work
anyway, and if I didnt have this outlet with which to reap the benefits of
this work (through consumerism), I would be more dissatisfied with having to
do that work.

> and what (time with dear ones, rest time, hot sex,

Of course, everything has its priorities. I mean, I certainly would rather
be having hot sex and you're probably like me in that I am contemplating and
doing nothing most of the time, meaning that getting off my ass can be a
chore, but its a worthwhile one once I'm there and having fun. Same applies
to things for me like going out to parties or going the beach, etc. Sure it
takes time and energy to start off, but once you are doing those things it
was worth it. I mean, thing about how much time and energy it takes to pull
a bunch of ravers off their ass and get to the party. That's 50 times more
energy than it take for me to go to the mall. I'm just saying that my
mindless consumerism does in fact have a place in my
things-to-do-for-fun-amusement-etc list and it certainly adds to my
happiness coefficient.

Defaintely! And to add to that, one person's benefit could be valueless to
another individual if not a minus entirely.

People who say idiotic things like, "I'm against organized religion. I'm a

meant. My definition of religion: "Belief that things that are not real are
as important or more important than the real concrete world in which we
live." Don't try to throw some pretentious dogshit at me about "How do you
know what's real" or I'll slap you in the head. "Feel that? Well that's the
REAL world." Believe in something supernatural? Does at least one other
person share the same belief? Do people who share this belief have a
collective name? THEN YOU'RE IN AN ORGANIZED RELIGION, DUMBASS! Stop trying

Subject: [sfraves] i'm back... and some trees and some beats...

what's up all... seeing as how i am unemployeed now, i
actually have the time to sift through the hundreds of
posts a day...

now on to the beats and the trees and the smiles and
the leaves...

just wanted to thank all you who went up to
treesnbeats last weekend, envirogirly and the creamery
clan, hulagurl, laith, steve, the michael and dreg
collective and of course the heads i went up with
rachel and her bro wes, jfunk and amy... though
saturday night got a bit hectic with the neverending
missions to make tea for people and the getting a flat
then spending over an hour trying to find an open tire
store, after the hell i went through last week i
really needed to get the hell out of dodge...

much love to the radiant group with the sparkles
(sorry can't remember any of your names, kari? with
the blue spiral shirt)... sorry we didn't make it up
to your mountain top hideaway...

On the subject of the UK and consumerism, et. al., here is a segment of the=
=20
most recent YOUpgrade ezine from Fraser Clark in the UK.  Looks like some=20
of you are "Moderns" and others "Cultural Creatives."  Fraser would see the=
=20
rave subculture as composed of primarily "Cultural Creatives."
_______________________________


THE CULTURAL CREATIVES

WE'VE BEEN CALLING THEM ZIPPIES FOR YEARS. NOW RESEARCH FROM THE US HAS=20
DISCOVERED A NEW "CLASSLESS CLASS" - THE CULTURAL CREATIVES.

A brand new book THE CULTURAL CREATIVES offers new perspectives that could=
=20
help the environmental and social justice movements find new paths,=20
sidestepping the troubles that have stymied them in recent years.
THE CULTURAL CREATIVES was written by Paul Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson who=
=20
have spent more than a decade doing survey research to discover the values=
=20
that Americans hold dear. ("Values are the best single predictor of real=20
behavior," they say.) They find that, based on fundamental values, U.S.=20
citizens can now be classified into three major groups:

=B7 MODERNS - 48% of Americans (93 million adults) with a median family=20
income of $42,500.
=B7 TRADITIONALS - 24.5% of Americans (48 million adults). (Dying)
=B7 CULTURAL CREATIVES - 25% (50 million adults) (and even more children?)=
=20
(Growing)

We all recognize Moderns and Traditionals, but most people don't even know=
=20
that Cultural Creatives exist. The Cultural Creatives themselves are=20
unaware of their huge numbers.
Here lie the seeds of a cultural revolution -- one that's already well on=20
its way.

MODERNS - The dominant subculture of our time, they make the rules we all=20
live by, control the civil service, the military, the courts, and the=20
media. Some of them operate the multinational corporations. Their ideology=
=20
is laid out for us every day, in detail, in pretty much every communication=
=20
medium. Their belief in a technological economy is reshaping the face of=20
the globe. They tend to dismiss other cultures and ways of life as somehow=
=20
inferior.
"The simplest way to understand today's Moderns is to see that they are the=
=20
people who accept the commercialized urban-industrial world as the obvious=
=20
right way to live. They're not looking for alternatives."
To Moderns, growth is not only good, it's essential.

MODERNS' BELIEFS (most important)
(a) making loadsa money
(b) climbing the ladder of success with measurable steps toward one's goal
(c) Having lots of choices (as a consumer, or voter, or on the job)
(d) being on top of the latest trends, styles and innovations
(e) supporting economic and technological progress at the national level
(f) rejecting the values and concerns of native people, rural people,=20
Traditionals, New Agers, and religious mystics.

TRADITIONALS. At the end of World War II, Traditionals were 50% of the=20
population, but today they're 25%, and shrinking as dying Traditionals are=
=20
not replaced by younger ones. Traditionals tend to be older, poorer, and=20
less educated than others.
Traditionals are often pro-environment and anti-big business. They're=20
outraged at the destruction of the world they remember, both natural areas=
=20
and small-town life.
"Many Traditionals are not white bread Republicans but elderly New Deal=20
Democrats, Reagan Democrats, and old-time union people as well as social=20
conservatives in politics."

TRADITIONALS' BELIEFS (among other things)
(a) patriarchs should again dominate family life
(b) FEMINISM is a swearword
(c) men need to keep their traditional roles and women need to keep theirs
(d) family, church, and community are where you belong
(e) customary and familiar ways of life should be maintained
(f) it's important to regulate sex -- pornography, teen sex, extramarital=20
sex, abortion
(g) men should be proud to serve in the military
(h) all the guidance you need for your life can be found in the Bible
(i) preserving civil liberties is less important than restricting immoral=20
behavior
(j) freedom to carry arms is essential
(k) foreigners are not welcome

CULTURAL CREATIVES. What Ray and Anderson discovered during a decade of=20
research is that the Moderns and Traditionals have now been joined by a=20
third subculture within the U.S., 50 million strong (26% of all adults) --=
=20
and growing.

CULTURAL CREATIVES' BELIEFS (10 OR MORE AND YOU'RE ONE!)
(a) love nature and are deeply concerned about its destruction
(b) are strongly aware of the problems of the whole planet and want to see=
=20
action to curb them, such as limiting economic growth
(c) would pay more taxes or higher prices if they knew the money would go=20
to clean up the environment and stop global warming
(d) give a lot of importance to developing and maintaining relationships
(e) place great importance on helping other people
(f) volunteer for one or more good causes
(g) care intensely about psychological or spiritual development
(h) see spirituality and religion as important in their own lives but are=20
also concerned about the role of the religious Right in politics
(h) want more equality for women at work and want more women leaders in=20
business and politics
(i) are concerned by violence and abuse of women and children everywhere on=
=20
Earth
(j) want politics and government to emphasize children's education and well=
=20
being, the rebuilding of neighborhoods and communities, and the creation of=
=20
an ecologically sustainable future
(k) are unhappy with both left and right in politics and want a new way=20
that is not the mushy middle
(l) tend to be optimistic about the future and distrust the cynical and=20
pessimistic view offered by the media
(m) want to be involved in creating a new and better way of life
(n) are concerned about what big corporations are doing in the name of=20
profit: exploiting poor countries, harming the environment, downsizing
(o) have their finances and spending under control and are not concerned=20
about overspending
(p) dislike the modern emphasis on success, on "making it," on wealth and=20
luxury goods
(q) like people and places that are exotic and foreign, and enjoy=20
experiencing and learning about other ways of life

Cultural Creatives are not defined by particular demographic=20
characteristics, they can be accountants, social workers, waitresses,=20
computer programmers, hair stylists lawyers, chiropractors, truck drivers,=
=20
photographers or gardeners.
The large majority are quite mainstream in their religious beliefs. They're=
=20
no more liberal/conservative than the mainstream, but tend to reject=20
"left-right" labels.
Really, their one distinguishing demographic characteristic is that 60% of=
=20
them are women, and most Cultural Creatives tend to hold values and beliefs=
=20
that women have traditionally held about issues of caring, family life,=20
children, education, relationships, and responsibility.
In their personal lives, they seek authenticity -- they want to walk their=
=20
talk and are also intent on finding wholeness, integration, and community.
Cultural Creatives are quite clear that they don't want to live in an=20
alienated, disconnected world. Their approach to health is preventive and=20
holistic, though they do not reject modern medicine. In their work, they=20
may try to go beyond earning a living to having "right livelihood" or a=20
vocation.
"In the twenty-first century, a new era is taking hold. The biggest=20
challenges are to preserve and sustain life on the planet and find a new=20
way past the overwhelming spiritual and psychological emptiness of modern=20
life. Though these issues have been building for a century, only now can=20
the Western world bring itself to publicly consider them. The Cultural=20
Creatives are responding to these overwhelming challenges by creating a new=
=20
culture."
New businesses, new management styles, new technologies, new forms of=20
social organization, and new decision-making techniques (the precautionary=
=20
principle, for example) -- the Cultural Creatives are constructing a new=20
world in our midst, largely ignored by the media.
By different paths, 50 million Cultural Creatives emerged from (or were=20
influenced by) social movements of the '60s and '70s. Ray and Anderson=20
describe 20 such movements that have spawned Cultural Creatives who, in=20
turn, have begun to put a positive spin on movements that have been mainly=
=20
oppositional. "Slowly a lesson has been drifting in on one movement=20
organisation after another. At some point, opposing something bad ceases to=
=20
be enough, and they must stand for positive values, or produce a service=20
that is important to their constituency,"
Ray and Anderson see this shift occurring in the environmental movement.=20
"Cultural Creatives are urging the environmental movement into a new phase.=
=20
Having educated us through protests and information, some are moving beyond=
=20
that now, to develop new kinds of businesses, technologies, and cooperative=
=20
ventures." There's a long way to go, but it's a start.
A major impediment to further innovation is the fact that Cultural=20
Creatives all think there are very few of them when in fact there are very=
=20
many of them. Therefore, "They do not know that they have the potential to=
=20
shape the life of the twenty-first century. Like an audience in a theater,=
=20
Cultural Creatives all look in the same direction. They read the same books=
=20
and share the same values and come to similar conclusions - but rarely do=20
they turn toward one another. They have not yet formed a sense of 'us' as a=
=20
collective identity; nor do they have a collective image of themselves=85
"Since they are part of a subculture that cannot yet see itself, these=20
millions of Cultural Creatives do not know what a potential they carry for=
=20
our common future."

Hello everyone,

I've put together a nice blurb on the electronica-optica debut next
Saturday. I've been settling a lot of last minute details and changes for
this special event, as well as many, many, many hours on our shop in the
city <<ELECTRONICA OPTICA>> which will be opening in October.

Many of us are really excited about this debut. Funny thing is, this is
still going to be an event like the ones we all go to all the time:
DJs, lights, decor, alters, dancers, and some visuals.

The only difference for us, really, is that the VJs and video artists
are taking main stage from the DJs... imagine that! The VJs are
actually getting time slots like DJs always get. That may not seem
like much of a change, but to the VJs, it's all of sudden, like, respect.

The good part for you guys is, most of these VJs are putting together
all their best content, some of it pre-burning man screenings of brand
new work. Since they're the stars and they don't have to water it
down for an 8 hour show.

Call the info line next week for more details.

If you want to get involved working on this event, let me know at:
radley@elemental.nu.

Suryummy sez: Don't forget to bring your butterfly photon catchers, cause
when it comes down to it those iridescent little buggers will be the
talk of the town, just you wait!!!

We hope to see you all there!

The Job Fairy presents:

........The Secrets of Magical Resumes and Job Searches........

Saturday, September 15, 2001 - 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m
Triton Hotel, 342 Grant Avenue @ Bush, San Francisco
Suite 200 "Creative Zone" Conference Room

$125 includes 1/2 hour personal follow-up coaching call
To register, and for more information, call Leslie Ayres at 510.232.5255

No crystal balls or magic wands required. Getting a magical job starts with
knowing who you are, being real about what you have to offer, and presentin=
g
it--in your resume and in person--in a way that=B9s irresistible to the peopl=
e
who can hire you.

We all know that the job market has undergone a dramatic change. Two years
ago, a qualified job-seeker was bombarded wihth choices.  Today, after the
"dot-bomb" economy and fallout of the past 18 months, hiring is starting
again. But every posted opening gets hundreds of responses, outside
recruiters aren't the resource that candidates used to count on, and so it
takes real know-how to stand out in the crowd.

This workshop is designed to teach you how to make your job search simpler,
faster, and more focused. You will learn to evaluate new opportunities, and
how to present your individuality, your talents and your experience with
confidence and results.

In this day-long workshop, we=B9ll cover:

... Getting clear on your values and priorities
... Generating a checklist of parameters to evaluate possibilities
... Getting perspective on your transferable skills for new career
directions
... Shifting your relationship to your resume to one of power and freedom
... Creating a resume that represents the real you=8B-and gets noticed by the
people who matter
... How to easily customize a stand-out resume for any position
... Secrets of uncovering unlisted jobs,
... How to get your resume noticed and on top of the stack
... Preparing for powerful and honest interviews
... Handling tough interview questions
... Keeping the faith and focus for as long as it takes

Who will benefit from this workshop:

... Job seekers wanting a resume they love that will get them interviews
... Career changers needing to repackage themselves and their talents for a
new industry
... Professionals needing to stand out in highly competitive fields
... People feeling stuck or discouraged in their search and want a new
perspective
... Anyone who wants to get training in presenting themselves with honesty
and confidence

Subject: [sfraves] Quality of Life (long)

All right!!  Philosophical flamewars are the best kind!

----------------------------------------------------------------

Lady Grey (what brought on that nomenclature?) said....

  You are talking about essential vs non-essentials.  My definition of
mindless
  would be things bought in a unconcious fashion - i.e. when you are motivated
  by ads and marketing and fashion rather than a really personal desire that
  can be backed up with some substantial reasoning

  Example:

  I needed a new car.  I wanted a convertible.  Not because convertibles
are cool
  (in VA, where it snows???) but because I always liked them because we had
one when
  I was a kid and so there is some emotional resonance beyond that of "oh,
I can
  pick up chicks easier"

  12 yrs later, I still have the same car.  It still works, looks only a
little beat 
  up and the cost of getting a new car outweighs the presumed benefits.  As
for those
  types who buy new cars just because the current one is two years old....

  Contrast my reasoning with those yahoos buying SUVs.  Now there is a
distinction -
  if you really do use that SUV because you're an avid outdoor type, then I
have no
  problem.  But if you bought it just because you're a yuppie lemming, then
you are
  an idiot - in a larger sense, the cost of your decision has more of a
negative
  effect on society as a whole - you aren't using it for its ostensible
purpose - 
  mindlessness...   If all those yuppie were avid outdoor types, I wouldn't
complain
  as much (I'd still bitch about the gas mileage, etc)

  Also, take for instance, my parents.  The kids have been out of the house
  for awhile, my dad had to deal with a chunk of cash, and they didn't like
  the neighborhood anymore.  So moving would be a good idea (and that would
  force them to get rid of most of the accumulated debris of living in one
house
  for 25 years)  So do they buy a reasonably or smaller sized house and stuff 
  the rest of the cash away for going on long vacation trips?  NO!!!  They buy
  a house 3x as large, in a fancier neighborhood, more lawn, and because it
is 
  a bigger house, and they have less stuff to fill it with, they buy MORE
furniture
  Is my mother happier?  well, now that she has a larger house to clean,
and she
  -hates- cleaning (I'm not there anymore...) she now-wants-a-maid.
  From an investment point of view, buying the house probably made sense
(my father
  is strongly Scottish) but they are still fools in the "larger" sense.
Yes, I told
  them so.

  But their values are not mine.  Are the prevalent values in America
worthwhile ones?
  I don't think so.

>However, Doug, I have also lived in the UK for extended periods of time. I 
>believe that in the middle classes, especially in the more prosperous south 
>(ie, London area), mindless consumerism is as rampant as it is here. Witness 
>the abundance of cel phones and the redecorating mania.

  well, AFAIK (according to Derek), "yahs" (as the Scots call them) are a
growing
  percentage of the population.  and I guess I haven't stated enough times
that
  all this is my personal perception.  Perhaps if I had hung out with that
crowd
  more often, I'd have a different perception (that the UK is as bad as
America)
  But I preferred to go to 3 day warehouse parties...  And my general sense
was
  that society in general was not as bad in this regard as in America - I
didn't
  have a sense of being bombarded by excessive advertising, there wasn't a 
  "live to work" type of feeling I got...  but then again, I grew up in the
DC area.


>My view of excessive material goods being necessary for quality of life:

  First we have to define "quality of life" (like having to define mindless)
  That phrase has a different meaning - Laurence is a packrat while Kari
  is more of a philosophical bent.  I lean towards Kari's side, so that is 
  where the misunderstanding between me and Laurence comes from

>And, if you think all consumerism is mindless, think again. We all consume, 
>but we can become mindful consumers. Buy recycled content paper, reused 
>clothing and reusable containers. Buy what you need: food, shelter, some 
>clothing.

  well, now you are talking about responsible consumerism

-----------

Laurence blurts out:

>Yes, but no one has disproved my assertion yet! The original statement was:

>> > > > I should have mentioned the quality of life seemed
>> > > > better - less mindless consumerism

>Which means, logically that:
>[more] mindless consumerism = [worse] quality of life.

>Which makes no sense!

  It does too, when you are using the assumptions I am making  (define
terms!!!)

>So, I said:

>> >Maybe I just want to bitch.... but how does "less mindless consumerism"
>> >directly lower the quality of life?

>And someone has yet to prove that more mindless consumerism actually LOWERS
>the quality of life. Sure, you dont NEED consumerism to have a high quality
>of life, but having more certainly wont lower it! If I have XXX amount of
>stuff, and then suddenly I decide to go on a shopping spree and now have
>XXXXXX amount of stuff. How am I worse off? If anything I'm better off!
>Certainly, in my perspective my quality of life is improved both by the
>ability to buy more things and having more things.

  For you, quality of life = having more stuff to play with.  That is not how
  I would define it.  One has to take care of all that stuff.  I would rather
  go to Europe....

>Thus, what is implied by the statement "I should have mentioned the quality
>of life seemed better - less mindless consumerism" is *bullshit*.

  I seem to have struck a nerve here....

---------------

Now Howling Bob chimes in....

>>Yes, but no one has disproved my assertion yet! The original statement was:
>>
>> > > > > I should have mentioned the quality of life seemed
>> > > > > better - less mindless consumerism
>>
>>Which means, logically that:
>>[more] mindless consumerism = [worse] quality of life.
>>
>>Which makes no sense!

>to the contrary.  "mindless consumerism," to me, implies both an absolute 
>glut of products of indifferent quality (ergo, "mindless": "mindful" 
>consumption would at a minimum entail awareness of relative quality) and the 
>equally "mindless" pursuit of "more," regardless of the actual return one 
>received from one's consumption.  if you consume tons of crap, you're still 
>consuming crap, and IMO the majority of consumer goods on offer nowadays are 
>precisely that.

  Great Bob, another definition of mindless.  But you are coming from the
cost/
  benefit (quality) angle and i was coming from the psychological motivations 
  position.  Instead of "mindless" for your concept, I would say
"worthwhile/worthless"

>>Thus, if the energy expenditure, expense, and stress entailed in "mindless 
>>consumerism" is not recompensed by the positive value received from the 
>>items consumed, then the idea that "[more] mindless consumerism = [worse] 
>>quality of life" is indeed logical, and IMO has been proved repeatedly,
both 
>>in my own experience and my observation of others.

  Restating - quality of life is correlated with the worth of what you
consume.
  If all you buy/eat/etc is crap, your QOL will be lower than what's possible.
  But crap is a term defined by an individual.  My grandfather loves going to
  Eat n' Park (think cheap version of Denny's).  He doesn't care about fine
wine
  or smoked salmon.  This is why my dad refuses to go to Pittsburgh anymore
  because he cares about smoked salmon and hates Eat n' Park.  I on the other
  hand have the attitude of it's just food, so who cares, as long as it's
reasonably
  edible.

-------

Laurence retorts:


>Personally I find the act of consumerism itself to be rewarding. There is no
>cost / exenditure other than monetary related to the act, because to me, the
>act itself is a leisurely activity. Also, because it is leisure I dont think
>there is a stress component at all, or if there is it is small enough that
>it is innately offset. That is to say that spending time in a mall, oggling
>all sorts of shit and using my credit card are innately rewarding in the
>same way someone else might find, say, walking in the park rewarding. I
>consider it a leisurely activity. And, therefore, if in addition the
>products I have mindlessly or mindfully purchased add a value to my life,
>that further increases my quality of life. 1) Because the act was rewarding
>and 2) the addition to the quantity of items I have has increased. =)

>That is just me personally of course, I'm not speaking for anyone else. =)

  well, I think your position is *bullshit*, but it's your life, so I have
no say

now bob:

>for myself, unless i'm shopping for something i really want/need/am into 
>(new CDs, outdoor wear, bike parts, more CDs...) i find the need to get off 
>my arse, onto MUNI, and out to the shops to be onerous.  Perhaps i'm too old 
>and tired for recreational shopping ;o)

>and there's also the additional stress factors outside of the act of 
>consumption itself: e.g., how many more hours does one have to 
>work/commute/do things you'd rather not do in order to pay for the objects 
>of consumption?  and what (time with dear ones, rest time, hot sex, 
>contemplation, sleep, and of course dancing!) is one giving up in order to 
>perform that labor?

Laurence:

--Ahhh... yes... recreational shopper is probably the best term for what I
--describe. I like that. It should be a title. =)

  aaahhhhh...  considering that your e-mail alter ego is the infamous
Jennifer 
  Love Hewitt, I am not surprised.  You are truly in touch with your
feminine side
  I on the other hand only buy what I need or really want and hate to spend
  any more time than necessary

> and there's also the additional stress factors outside of the act of
> consumption itself: e.g., how many more hours does one have to
> work/commute/do things you'd rather not do in order to pay for the objects
> of consumption?

--Ah ha! But see, for me, recreational shopping is a reward and the benefit
--from having to work so hard to earn all that money. After working so hard
--and once I've accumulated this disposable income, what better way to spend
--it, relieve stress and inrease my quality of life but mill around at the
--mall and spend that money =) That is one of many points where my work
--translates into benefit. You see, I'm going to have to do all that hard work
--anyway, and if I didnt have this outlet with which to reap the benefits of
--this work (through consumerism), I would be more dissatisfied with having to
--do that work.

  again, it's a matter of personal priorities - I would rather work less, earn
  less money, and have experiences rather than a lot of stuff.  In the long
run,
  stuff is useless

> tangentially, this is why the whole cost/benefit analysis approach to
> political issues gives me the Orwellian willies...the result is utterly
> dependent on what one considers as "benefits" and/or acknowledges as
> "costs."

--Defaintely! And to add to that, one person's benefit could be valueless to
--another individual if not a minus entirely.

  So why in the world did we have this argument?

had to have the last word since I started it,
Doug

Alright, so I just got the new Scott Henry CD, Buzz:
The Politics of Sound.

OMG...it's amazing.  I listened to it all last night,
and I can't take it out of my CD player today.

Everyone should get this CD.  I highly recommend the
following tracks:

Number 3-Utah Saints, Lost Vagueness
Number 6-PQM, You are sleeping

Alright, back to work.  Have a gret day everyone!

People who say idiotic things like, "I'm against organized religion. I'm a
Wiccan." Here's a hint... You said Wiccan and I knew precisely what you
meant. My definition of religion: "Belief that things that are not real are
as important or more important than the real concrete world in which we
live." Don't try to throw some pretentious dogshit at me about "How do you
know what's real" or I'll slap you in the head. "Feel that? Well that's the
REAL world." Believe in something supernatural? Does at least one other
person share the same belief? Do people who share this belief have a
collective name? THEN YOU'RE IN AN ORGANIZED RELIGION, DUMBASS! Stop trying
to be trendy.

So at least the rave scene isn't receiving ALL the bad press on =
parties-gone-bad.  This bust sounds worse than most that I've read =
about...   anyone else have details???

>From Mattier and Ross, SF Chronicle
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2001/08/22/MN27075.DTL=


SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER: These may be the dog days of August, but when it =
comes to parties -- they nearly blew the roof off the town the other =
night.=20

By the time it was over, more than 100 cops, many in riot gear, =
descended Saturday night on busy Van Ness Avenue and Sutter Street to =
break up a rap party attended by some 1,500 rambunctious teenagers.=20

According to police Lt. Larry Barsetti, it all started earlier in the =
week when somebody called the old Regency theater -- which was turned =
into a private dance hall a couple of years back -- to book the place on =
short notice.=20

"He said it was for a national fraternity party, and that there would be =
about 600 people," Regency co-owner Craig Lipton tells us.=20

And when the organizer showed up the next day with a $7,500 cash down =
payment, the Regency didn't ask many questions.=20

But come Saturday night it quickly became apparent that the Regency got =
more than it bargained for -- as teenagers from all over the Bay Area =
started rolling up, while the promoters stood outside selling tickets to =
anyone walking by.=20

Added fun: The event was also being promoted on KMEL radio as an "after- =
hours dance party."=20

The night manager approached the promoter and told him to stop letting =
people in, as the place was quickly exceeding capacity.=20

The promoter refused, and when the manager threatened to call police, =
things apparently turned ugly.=20

"The promoter told her, 'If you call the police, we are going to trash =
the building,' and he threatened her," Lipton says.=20

At which point, the shaken manager locked herself in her office and =
frantically began phoning both her boss and the police.=20

Before you can say busta rap, scores of squad cars, riot cops and =
sheriff's deputies descended on the scene, shutting down the party and =
driving hundreds of kids into the streets -- just as movie theatergoers =
from across the street were getting out.=20

But instead of a riot, the police-rapper confrontation turned into a =
giant street party that blocked traffic on Van Ness and the nearby =
neighborhood for the better part of an hour as youngsters danced in the =
street.=20

Final score: one street fight, three drunken youngsters detained and =
more than two dozen teenagers trying to storm a doughnut shop near Van =
Ness and Geary.=20

By time all the kids had returned to their cars and hit the freeways, it =
was close to 2 a.m. And police were both exhausted and angry.=20

"No doubt about it," says Barsetti, "it cost the city a few bucks."=20

But at least they didn't get the doughnut shop.=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: Is the UK a 2nd world country?

this thread, culminating in this comment, prompts me to finally say
something about the quote you use for a sig line, laurence... 

is that quote your thinking, along with the web page it references? 

if you turned that quote in to your logic professor, it would be returned
with the comments in red: "sloppy, argumentative, shows no understanding of
either philosophy or religion -- try again, and without the emotional
outbursts and namecalling"

seriously, laurence, it starts by saying you are talking about "organized
religion" and then building an argument with "My definition of religion"
(that's like telling a "dumb blonde" joke and starting  with "my definition
of blonde is..." -- it rather misses the point) .... 

and then it rambles on to apparently thinking you can disprove the
supernatural by whacking someone in the head (right, that's how to disprove
non-physical realities, using physical evidence, um, yeah)...

and then you end up with screaming and namecalling.  and the "trendy"
comment is amusing. those damned trendy pagans, always trying to keep up
with the hippest new things, century after century after century.

one argument against recreational shopping from the other thread-- giving it
up could leave time for deeper intellectual pursuits. like studying what
other deep thinkers over the centuries have seen, believed, understood,
wondered about. believe me, developing your mind is far more rewarding than
buying more crap. 

there is always more than meets the eye -- because our eyes limit us in
really seeing what is there. until you figure that out... you will remain
blind.

People who say idiotic things like, "I'm against organized religion. I'm a
Wiccan." Here's a hint... You said Wiccan and I knew precisely what you
meant. My definition of religion: "Belief that things that are not real are
as important or more important than the real concrete world in which we
live." Don't try to throw some pretentious dogshit at me about "How do you
know what's real" or I'll slap you in the head. "Feel that? Well that's the
REAL world." Believe in something supernatural? Does at least one other
person share the same belief? Do people who share this belief have a
collective name? THEN YOU'RE IN AN ORGANIZED RELIGION, DUMBASS! Stop trying
to be trendy.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: Release review Sat 18th???

Deep Dish laid it down proper!  As usual though, most of the crowd was on 
too many to feel it accept for the few build ups but I was feelin' that ish 
all the way through and making as much dancing space as I could to enjoy 
it!!  Too crowded for my taste though - makes it hard to dance. 

Went upstairs afterwards and found some more space dancing to Marques.  
Funky, groovin' beats and breaks...but you expected nothing less.  Had a 
good time that night ;P"

what's so seductive about this meme that you feel the need to spread it

well, when you choose to include it -- all ten lines *plus* the url -- in
every message you send out -- then you are saying that it reflects your

whether you wrote it or now, it reflects on you.

Subject: [sfraves] Favorite artists by genre w/MP3s

Hey hey...
Just ordered my new stereo for my van, a very nice Clarion CD player, and it 
plays MP3s! So now I'm going all over the place looking for MP3 mixes. I 
want to know who your favorite artists are in the following genres, so I can 
hunt down some more good MP3s. If they already have a website and you know 
they've got MP3 mixes, that's best, but if they don't, I'll look around 
'till I find some. But yeah, who do you think spins the coolest:

Progressive trance
Psychedelic trance
Trancey/melodic breaks
Electro/Nu Skool breaks
Tribal house
Tech house
Deep house (no vocal!)
Funky/disco house
DnB/jungle
2-step
Tech-step
all those weird steps I don't know :P
Ambient

Thanks in advance!
-=Chris=-

Subject: [sfraves] srr - Cops bust up "RAP" Party

--0-626153587-998508365=:86988
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline


Hm... encouraging news there.  Maybe the tide is turning and the short
attention span of the cops is swinging back towards their earlier targets.

Who knows, maybe death metal will make a comeback and be the next favorite
"evil influence on the children".

You know, as discouraging as it is, to be the current target of the police, it
does help, to look back and realise that the rave scene is only the latest
target of hatred and fear of the previous generations.  And oh so many
scapegoats they had...

Just before electronica (does ANYBODY have a better word yet?) became their
target for hatred, Marilyn Manson was turning the kids into satanists.

Before that, rap was turning them into cop killers.

Before that, grunge was turning them into... uh... smelly people who wear lots
of flannel?

In the late '80s, Death Metal was, once again, going to turn the kids into
satanists.

In the mid '80s, Madonna was going to turn America's teenage girls into slutty
whores, much to the dismay of the right wing zealots.  But makers of '80s teen
movies were thrilled.

Early '80s...  I forget what punk rock was accused of doing "to the children". 
But I do remember that Jello Biafra was actually prosecuted by congress for
part of it.  I guess punk rock just challanges blind obedience to authority too
much for the xtian right.

Back into the music of our parents generation....

Disco was... well... it was disco... ugh... 'nuff said.

My mom told me once, that HER ancestors were convinced that KISS stood for
"Knights In Satan's Service".

Ozzy and Alice Cooper... oops, there's satanism AGAIN!?!?!?  Sheesh.  I guess
closed-minded people who hate the young really DON'T have much of an
imagination.

Jim Morrison... arrested in Florida for some "moral perversion" or another.

Oh... and the Beatles.  All that talk about "giving peace a chance", and,
"imagine there's no country; nothing to kill or die for; and no religion
too..."  Obviously the fab four were determined to turn our youth into a hoarde
of godless commies.

Putting the current situation in perspecive does yield just a little optimism. 
Most every youth culture to emerge in the last several decades has been the
object of hatred and persecution at the hands of the obsolete.

But in every case, the cops eventually find some other target to beat up upon. 
Not that that means for a second, that, in an ideal world, they shouldn't be
retaliated against for every abuse of their power.  But maybe they are shifting
their attention off us for awhile.

Maybe Shug Knight getting out of prison WAS a good thing after all.


peace,
john

I have to admit that I'm glad someone finally said something about that

vent about it but it needed to be said by someone. Thanks Leslie.

Alright, fine, I just thought it was funny and I loosely agreed with it but
never analyzed it. And it was a rant, not a meme. Hope you're all happy
now!!! =P

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] srr - Cops bust up "RAP" Party

i can't agree with this line of thinking.

first, it sounds like the police weren't involved in this at all until the
venue manager asked them to be -- because it sounds like the promoters were
less than honest with their intentions, and certainly not very professional
in their dealings (of course, there may be more to the story)

second, just because the bullets are being aimed in another direction at any
given moment, doesn't mean that the war is over.

in fact, something like this could make it even more difficult to do events.
once again, while we may perceive hiphop as "not us" -- you cannot assume
that the rest of the world does... to many, it's just another example of
"young people who don't respect property and can't behave"

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

i think it all comes down to the moral majority being more stupid and
inbred then the enlightened subcultures...and not knowing how to handle
it.

they are wolves in sheeps clothing...

i got this same response responding when your earlier sig file was enclosed.

and sorry to repeat myself, but funny as it is to you... to me, the new sig
is about as obnoxious as the last one. laurence. do you think you could come
up with something that doesn't rely on a a sense of misplaced

about that throwing dogs out windows stuff way down...

I saw 2 dogs on the side of 280 dead as dirt....they had obviously 
fallen out of the back of  some redneck's pickup truck.  Then, what do I 
see further down the road?  A pickup with a dog in it, cowering for its 
life trying to brave the bumps on the expressway.  True story, I was 
upset for a solid 2 days....

So my suggestion, shoot all rednecks and do the world  favor...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] srr - Cops bust up "RAP" Party

The Rap Party had no permits.   The police had no prior knowledge of this event.
That venue is now going through a similar process with SFPD, as I went through with
the Bill Graham Civic in order to bring it back from the graveyard of lost venues.

It's actually quite amusing that MB6 will be the FIRST EVER FULLY LEGAL Dance event
EVER to be held at the Civic Auditorium... in it's 40 year history!!!.   Yes, all
previous events held at this venue have been ILLEGAL because no police permits were
ever applied for or issued for ANY OF THEM.

However, the point is, that we now have a chance to SHINE... like never before, and
prove to PD that everything I sold them on (peaceful crowd, respectful audience,
there for the music, Non-violent... etc.) is really the case.     It's ours to keep,
or screw-up.    Lets show then all what we're really about and dispel all the
rumors, and set our own precedent, so we don't have to live in the shadow of media
sensationalism.     It's only a revolution if you're a part of the solution!!!

Keep it alive, Vlad

Subject: [sfraves] cops bust up rap party

this is my favorite part of the story:

"But instead of a riot, the police-rapper
confrontation turned into a =
giant street party that blocked traffic on Van Ness
and the nearby =
neighborhood for the better part of an hour as
youngsters danced in the 
=
street.="

nice one!  

not that i'm supporting the shady promoters if they
were, indeed, shady and overcrowding the venue.  but
it's nice to see renegade street parties happening
like good - good to see a good use of public space.  

(and maybe i'm a little jealous - i work 2 blocks from
there and hate van ness ave. so much for its
car-centeredness and car dealerships.  (actually, i
just hate van ness avenue in general - to drive on,
bus on, and walk on.)  and i've always wanted to see a
renegade street party there... )  

take care,
monicat

Well, I think the authorities should just ban all types of music.  If we
incarcerate people who create this vain and satanic artform, then we won't
have to worry about our children being adulterated from their purity.  Let's
start with Barney--that satanic purple monster who tries to take over our
children at such an early part of their lives . . .

Hm... encouraging news there.  Maybe the tide is turning and the short
attention span of the cops is swinging back towards their earlier targets.

Who knows, maybe death metal will make a comeback and be the next favorite
"evil influence on the children".

You know, as discouraging as it is, to be the current target of the police,
it
does help, to look back and realise that the rave scene is only the latest
target of hatred and fear of the previous generations.  And oh so many
scapegoats they had...

Just before electronica (does ANYBODY have a better word yet?) became their
target for hatred, Marilyn Manson was turning the kids into satanists.

Before that, rap was turning them into cop killers.

Before that, grunge was turning them into... uh... smelly people who wear
lots
of flannel?

In the late '80s, Death Metal was, once again, going to turn the kids into
satanists.

In the mid '80s, Madonna was going to turn America's teenage girls into
slutty
whores, much to the dismay of the right wing zealots.  But makers of '80s
teen
movies were thrilled.

Early '80s...  I forget what punk rock was accused of doing "to the
children".
But I do remember that Jello Biafra was actually prosecuted by congress for
part of it.  I guess punk rock just challanges blind obedience to authority
too
much for the xtian right.

Back into the music of our parents generation....

Disco was... well... it was disco... ugh... 'nuff said.

My mom told me once, that HER ancestors were convinced that KISS stood for
"Knights In Satan's Service".

Ozzy and Alice Cooper... oops, there's satanism AGAIN!?!?!?  Sheesh.  I
guess
closed-minded people who hate the young really DON'T have much of an
imagination.

Jim Morrison... arrested in Florida for some "moral perversion" or another.

Oh... and the Beatles.  All that talk about "giving peace a chance", and,
"imagine there's no country; nothing to kill or die for; and no religion
too..."  Obviously the fab four were determined to turn our youth into a
hoarde
of godless commies.

Putting the current situation in perspecive does yield just a little
optimism.
Most every youth culture to emerge in the last several decades has been the
object of hatred and persecution at the hands of the obsolete.

But in every case, the cops eventually find some other target to beat up
upon.
Not that that means for a second, that, in an ideal world, they shouldn't be
retaliated against for every abuse of their power.  But maybe they are
shifting
their attention off us for awhile.

Maybe Shug Knight getting out of prison WAS a good thing after all.


peace,
john

Oh that doesnt make much sense. The obvious option is to outlaw all trucks
and make it illegal for any dog to be outside of a house. Also, ban redneck
related paraphenalia, like blue jeans and boots.

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

Very well said Vlad, most people don't care about the solution. I would 
say 75% of this scene has no idea what we are talking about or fighting 
for. One of the problems I see is people from other genre's coming to 
raves because they have nothing better to do. Most of the time it's 
those people that cause problems and do all kinds of stupid shit, but in 
some cases ravers do it to. I know for a fact there is a good number of 
ravers out there that believe doing E is something cool and everyone 
should be on E at a rave. I think there needs to be more education and 
more literature published to the general public and to ravers. Until the 
general public gets the horrible stereotypes the government and 
authorities feed to them we have no one on our side other than 
ourselves. So we need to prove to the world we are what we claim to be, 
peaceful loving understanding and respectful. Just my thoughts

Nah... Barney will have his place in my New World Order.  After all, a
brainwashed populace will make my job of world domination easier.  It's just
that *I* (well, okay... my minister of propaganda) will be writeing the
brainwashing messages.

Alternately, if I only overthrow California, and not the whole world, Barney
will still exist, the message will just be different.  I'll employ the talents
of Spielberg and Industrial Light and Magic, and turn Barney into a
velociraptor.

Interesting!

See, I laughed at loud at this sig, and I definietely agree with 
it.  Perhaps I should read the entire source article, but I do already know 
of the event they speak of.  Why exactly would people start throwing pets 
out windows?  Because an Austrian artist dropped a cow from a 
helicopter?  That seems quite ridiculous to me!   I saw a picture online of 
a PC box that was dropped from a great height.. most likely it fell out of 
a cargo plane.  I'm sure there were witnesses.. but I doubt they'll go home 
and toss their pc's out the window.  Furthermore, if you were to watch what 
happened to the dropped cow, you'd prolly never want to see something as 
violent happen to your beloved pet.. While person(s) may feel emotionally 
attached to particular cow(s), the cows do not share the sentiment.  It 
could easily be argued that Dogs are capable of much more than cows.. I'm 
sure Claudia feels for the cow, and doesn't want it to happen, but I don't 
think that copy cat art projects are likely.

Subject: [sfraves] young guys and machismo..not necessarily related.nrr

here's who else you might encounter when your a really
sweet 
lady just trying to make some decent friends and hear
some 
good music...okay, 
MACHISMO: 
out of style, ladies don't really like it and never
did....
machismo is like when the guy just blows up at you all
of the time for everything, and you might see his side
of 
it, but basically, he's diss'in on you and every other
woman he can....there is a big difference between
MACHISMO 
and a consensual role playing game where dominance and
submission are played out for the benefit and pleasure
of 
both parties involved...MACHISMO is dead...run away
from that guy...
okay then there are the YOUNG GUYS: you might be
significantly older than them, or just plain
developmentally 
more mature than them...they don't know the
difference..
if you are turned off, don't feel bad..if they get
pissed, don't fix it..you are not their mom. PEACE
OUT!!!! :)

since. Its just so random... what does it all mean! AHHHHHHHH!!!! ok sorry i
got carried away. But seriously hehe I have a date with a girlie tomorrow

of the mirror for a few and get it out your system) Thanks I totally chicks

Subject: [sfraves] Nocturnal Wonderland...Anyone need a ride/room?

hey all...

i recently moved to SF and do not know that many
peeps...thinking about going to nocturnal wonderland
and want someone to ride with me (just drove cross
country from DC solo and it is hell driving long
distance by yourself!)...my friend is on the fence
about going but i need to go to promote.  

i have already booked a hotel room from friday to
sunday night.  i ask that you split gas/room cost. 
another thing is that the person HAS to have a cell
phone as i will be running all over the party
promoting...so it's important we stay in touch via
cell.  the nearest hotel is 45 minutes from the
venue...so i don't want to lose ya!

i live in berkeley...will be leaving friday
a.m...coming back late sunday night or monday
a.m...want to make a vacation out of it...um - has to
like breaks since i adore it and you will have to
listen to it all the way!  

please respond privately...
jaemi

Suit challenges ban on 'rave' gear
Associated Press
Aug. 22, 2001 08:59:00
NEW ORLEANS - The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit Tuesday 
challenging a ban on items at "rave" dance parties that prosecutors say are 
used to enhance the effects of the popular club drug Ecstasy.
Organizers of a rave in New Orleans had agreed to the ban on glow sticks, 
pacifiers, masks and vapor rubs under a plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
"It's a form of behavior control because they feel these people might do 
something illegal if they posses these items," said Joe Cook, director of 
Louisiana's ACLU chapter. "Maybe next they'll ban dancing since people 
often dance while on drugs. That's the absurdity we're dealing with."
Acting U.S. Attorney Jim Letten said he had yet to review the lawsuit. But 
he said a third party intervening in a criminal plea agreement is highly 
unusual.
"We were cognizant of the legitimate Constitutional rights of individuals 
but also had to consider the welfare, health and safety of the citizens and 
had to strike a balance of various factors in reaching that decision," 
Letten said.
Investigators have linked the raves held since 1995 at the State Palace 
Theater to numerous drug overdoses and the 1998 death of a 17-year-old girl.
The ACLU's complaint was filed Tuesday on behalf of the electronic band 
Rabbit in the Moon - which is scheduled to perform here Friday and whose 
stage costumes incorporate glowing necklaces - and several people who had 
items confiscated at a rave on Aug. 4.
The lawsuit asks for a ruling before Friday's rave.

ACLU Lawsuit Fights Government's Extremist Tactics In
Culture War Against Raves
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    :    Tuesday, August 21,
2001 
NEW ORLEANS-- Saying the government's war on drugs has reached
bizarre new extremes, the American Civil Liberties Union today asked a
federal court to prohibit the government from banning the use of glow
sticks, pacifiers and masks at a rave here this weekend.
According to the ACLU complaint, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
has banned symbols of rave culture such as masks, glow items, pacifiers, and
vapor rub from a prominent dance venue, saying that these items constitute
"drug paraphernalia."
"It is nonsensical to think that glow sticks and masks can be used
to ingest drugs, which is how the law defines paraphernalia," said Graham
Boyd, director of the ACLU's Drug Policy Litigation Project. "It is time the
American public realized that raves are not at all the havens for rampant
drug use that the government has led them to believe and are in fact part of
an established form of youth culture."
Those named in the ACLU's class action lawsuit include a former
military man and an insurance agent whose masks and glow sticks were
confiscated at an August 4 rave, and an internationally renowned performance
group that faces cancellation of an act incorporating glow sticks.
Raves are electronic music concerts that the government seeks to
close because some attendees use the drug Ecstasy. But that approach, Boyd
said, is tantamount to shutting down rock concerts in the 1960s or jazz
clubs in the 1920s because some people are using drugs.
"The government's ban on cultural symbols does nothing to prevent
drug use, while striking at the heart of First Amendment freedoms," said
Boyd. "If the police want to enforce drug laws, then they should go after
drug dealers, but dancing and music are protected by the Constitution."
Earlier this year, the DEA attacked raves by suing the music
promoter and concert hall manager of the State Palace Theater here, a
popular dance and concert venue that frequently hosts raves. The case marked
the first time that the government had used a federal "crack house" law to
prosecute organizers of raves.
Although the DEA's all-out assault on the State Palace Theater fell
short of its goal of conviction, the agency is still pursuing its war
against rave culture. In a plea deal put forth by the DEA, the government
has forbidden all wearing of masks, glow items and pacifiers, and has banned
the use of vapor rub at electronic dance events held at the theater. As a
result, theater staff have been forced to censor the actions and art of its
guests and artists.
Today's lawsuit comes as a result of that plea bargain, which, the
ACLU complaint said, "embodies the government's unconstitutional assault
against the electronic music culture."
In addition to protecting the First Amendment rights of music lovers
and performance artists, the ACLU is also challenging the plea bargain's
violation of theater attendees' right to due process and against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
As described in the ACLU complaint, two guests of the State Palace
Theater were subject to censorship during an event held on August 4. Michael
Behan, an insurance agent who usually attends raves in his "Mr. Bunny"
costume, did not bring masks or glow sticks to that event because of the ban
and was prevented from entering with a hand-held massager. Clayton Smith, a
former member of the United States Air Force's prestigious Sabre Drill Team,
had his glow sticks and pacifier confiscated at the August 4 event.
"As a member of the Sabre Drill Team, I incorporated dance and
acrobatic movement into my routine that I would first try out on dance
floors with glow sticks," said Smith. "Although I am no longer a member of
the team I still like to go to raves and try new moves. I feel it is my
right to be able to do so."
In addition, Steven McClure, the founding member of Rabbit in the
Moon, an internationally renowned group that has performed numerous times at
the State Palace Theater, has been warned by theater staff that his group
can no longer perform in their usual costume, which incorporates glow
necklaces. The group faces the cancellation of their March 2002 performance
at the theater if they violate the censorship order.
"The DEA, acting on behalf of Ashcroft as 'Big Brother,' has
embarked on a culture crusade to ban innocent behavior at music concerts
while the drug dealers take a walk," said Joe Cook, Executive Director of
the ACLU of Louisiana. "With these perverted priorities, the next target
could be a raid on the local Walgreens to shut it down for selling masks and
glow sticks." 
According to Will Patterson of the Electronic Music Defense and
Education Fund, a group established to provide legal assistance industry
professionals targeted by government censorship of raves, the plea agreement
entered in New Orleans has led many venues across the country to ban the
sale of glowsticks and other items labeled as paraphernalia.
"In effect," he said, "the government has curtailed the growth of an
increasingly popular form of entertainment and has also hampered the
companies who manufacture and sell these items at raves."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] srr - Cops bust up "RAP" Party


Erm... sorry... I thought I had injected enough humour to make it apparant that
I was not being entirely serious there (I was aiming for 50% serious post, 50%
funny).

I, personally, find it hilarious that the government has used the supposed
intent to "turn the children to satan", so MANY times to persecute varoius
musicians and the subcultures around them.  That's especially given that I
actually know a number of satanists, and they are insanely nice people....
nicer than many xtians I encountered back when I lived in the bible belt.

I'm waiting with baited breath to see when satanism pops up as an excuse to
harass musicians and their fans AGAIN.  ('cuz you KNOW ti's gonna happen)

Anyway, I thought I did try to make it clear that I DO firmly beleive that the
police MUST be swiftly punished when they abuse their powers, shutting down ANY
event, on WHATEVER invented pretext.... be it rave, rap, rock, or even boy
band.  (hmmm... scratch that... let 'em shut down all the boy band shows they
want).


cya,
john

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

The biggest problem I have with Netscape is that it is so huge, all I want
to put on my machine is their browser.  Unfortunately I can't, I must
install their huge ass package of stuff I will never use.  The integration
of AOL in to Netscape has removed any of the lagging respectability they had
before.  The new browser seems to be a bit quicker then the beta previews,
but in reality almost everyone is making their pages for IE because
Frontpage and IIS are made by Microsoft and dominate the market right now.

If Netscape were to concentrate all of their efforts on their browser and
not a suite they might have a chance.  For email I prefer Outlook 2002, not
because it is a Microsoft product but because it is by far one of the best
all around information manager / email programs on the market.  Netscape
just cannot compare and once you get used to it, it is awesome because all
of the AV software integrates in to it usually and while there are some
quirks, it's not totally as bad as its rep makes people think.

I wouldn't waste time writeing a cgi script to do this.  And unless your
entire
site is CGI generated, it will be a rathar icky mess to get it all to work
right.

The much easier and faster way is to just drop the IP block you want to
disallow in /etc/hosts.deny

It won't stop a determined attacker (the tend to have access to alternate
IPs),
but it'll stop the casual schmuck.

how about Opera?  I am getting tired of Netscape 4.7 crashing -so hard-
all the time and I do not want to install Communicator.  As for Mozilla,
it looks too big.  And IE has strange quirks that I hate.

as for Outlook, I thought it was merely all right, did not use it much
- until I had to start using Lotus Notes.  Sweet Jesus, does Notes suck
But they were first to market, so they have a big install base.
At least with Outlook, one could fumble around w/o having to read the 
manual.  The Notes interface is bloody awful

Having done some beta testing with Windows XP Professional, if you hate IE, 
you'll hate it even more if you upgrade to XP. If you like IE, you'll fall 
in love with the new features and interface. It's XML from head to foot and 
the new .NET strategy is in full swing. So, if you're a Hotmail user and you 
sign in to Passport to check your email, you stay signed in if you just 
close the browser. You have to go through the log out process to actually 
log out. The look and feel of IE for XP is pretty nice; it's very eye 
pleasing. Of course, you need 900 megs of HD space to install just the base 
OS, not including all the other bells and whistles. What else? 
Stability...XP is very stable. I'm running Release Candidate 1 and it has 
yet to crash on me. No compatibility issues thus far either.  Oh and for all 
you Mac heads with your text to speech technology...Microsoft has added not 
only text to speech but buil in voice recognition as well. I tried this out 
with Office XP and it works pretty well in both dictation and voice command 
mode. Built-in CDR software. Smart tags...but they won't be in the final 
code. So, all in all, if you're currently running Windows 95, 98, or ME, the 
upgrade may be worth it just for the stability features as XP uses the same 
NT file system used by 2000. If you're running 2000, you really don't need 
to upgrade unless you're the type that likes to have the latest and 
greatest. So, there's my take on IE 6 and Windows XP. :-)

Subject: [sfraves] *Rumor! Re: Sound Asylum tickets!!! * bsp.

Hey all!

I've been hearing a rumor that our party (Sound Asylum, this Friday the 
24th) is sold out already!  THIS IS *NOT* TRUE!!!  I think what happened is 
this:

We didn't drop our tickets off until this past weekend, (late, we know...!)  
Anyhow, some of you may have called up a record store last week or earlier 
asking about tickets for this party.  You may have been told "We don't have 
them" or something to that effect, and misunderstood that for "We're sold 
out."

Just to clear things up, we dropped off presales this past weekend, so *no* 
stores should be sold out just yet!  However, it's wisest to grab your 
presales now, as they are selling quickly!!

Here's the ticket outlets:  Subsonic Underground (Sac), Sticky Vinyl 
(Vallejo), Harmonics (Santa Rosa), Skills (Berkeley), Frequency 8 (SF), 
Solid Grooves (San Jose).

Thanks a bunch!  Here's the info line so you can get more information:
(415) 267-3992.

Here's an image of the flyer:
http://www.dj-d.com/flyers/soundasylum2.jpg.

Alright, then, thanks for reading this, and we'll see you Friday
at the Asylum!!!!

Much Love,

Denise
:)

PS.  Could somebody from the d-list please forward this email to any of the 
other lists i have forgotten (eg., iloveraving).  thanks!

hi:hyperreal:sf

its been a while....
but...i have a question for you:

if you have a club gig in the castro, what is the going rate of payment?

is there a "going rate" for payment of deejaying at a small club in the
castro?

if that is too specific, can anyone tell me how much most deejays get paid
for a set and how long do you spin for?


*i'm asking cause i have an audition and if it goes well, i wanna have
asking price*

rock on,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

Right there with you. I love the feel of Netscape and always used to use it,
but when MSIE didn't quit and supported code better and didn't slaughter
what should be a standard code I switched. The only reason to use Netscape
now is because it's *NOT* Microsoft and to me that's a shitty reason. I
don't like Microsoft but I can't argue with the product compared to
Netscape. Opera is quite good, but still has a ways to come. IE6 that's
included in that WinXP release right now is supposed to be fully CSS2
compliant. Something that makes me very happy. Coming from the graphic
design background and getting into web I hated the lack of control over
type. CSS is a godsend. That new interface for XP and IE6 though... ::GAG::
I'm not into pretty color silly UI's for OS's.

Back to the explorer vs netscape battle. netscape lost years ago for failing
to keep up with standards that web designers want. I check in netscape all
my sights, but only correct the oddities with netscape to a point unless the
client wants *everything* to be completely cross browser compliant. blah.
The web is such a pain in the ass which is why my first love is print. You
can *touch* it. =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] srr: Deejay $ Question

as a DJ, i have been payed about 10 times in my three-year career.

the most was $150, the least ammount was a few drink tickets that i never
received.  the average is about $25.

getting payed depends on many things:

1) how much money the bar makes
2) how stingy the bar/cub owner is (they're usually very stingy)
3) how much you're worth (are you *really* good?)
4) how much they offer
5) how much you ask for

so.............

i dunno.  ask around.  talk to other DJs.  be humble about it, as it's a
tough question to ask ("gee, how much do *you* make DJing?")

unless you're established or something, i'd recommend asking between
$50-$75.

then again, these are just numbers that i pulled out of my ass.  8^)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

XP actually is quite an improvement over Win2k.  Mainly because the whole 
architecture of the OS is new, not based on NT.

It may look a little too user-friendly, but it really is quite stable and 
you don't need to restart as much.  It screams on my roommate's P4.

Give it a shot!

ok, I try to keep out of geri's head, but I have to comment on WHY this 
thread bothers me.. There are macho guys out there, who are also 
misogynists, and wish to have NOTHING to do with women, let alone sleep / 
drink / dance with them.  I don't claim to be a misogynist, because well, I 
don't really hate anyone..

give me hard techno, hard alcohol, skateboarding, heavy computers, and a

Subject: [sfraves] DJ question

I have a question for the DJ's out there.

So supposing you're playing a set that you want to start out slow
and build in energy/tempo. I'd always assumed you pick slower
records to start with, and go to faster and faster records as the set
progresses. But if you're beatmatching accurately between records,
the tempo will remain identical from one record to the next. So are
you constantly inching up the tempo as the records are playing, using
the pitch control? I'd never noticed this, but I guess this must be
what's happening. (Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question!).

yeah but they never will because AOL bought the software and they just want
it dead.  In a years time there will be no such thing as Netscape Navigator.
They're phasing it out and exclusively going to be a "Web Portal".  Whatever
THAT means ;)

Me too!

I still use Netscape not only because it's not MS, but b/c IE has these
little annoying 'features' that you can't change.  There's only one or two
in netscape, but netscape takes a lot more memory... Basically, netscape
would kick ass if it was kept up to date and some serious work was done on
the browser portion.. I haven't tried opera in a while, so I'm downloading
it now.  I haven't bothered to even look at XP, from what I've heard, it
will suck.  I use win2k here at work, and it's so-so, I still run 98 SE at
home (most of the time) due to compatibility issues.  I'm not too thrilled
with 2k, so  don't see how XP could be an improvement.  Orginally I hoped
to use netscape until a better OS came out, but it doesn't look like that's
going to happen any time soon.  I have sinking pit in my stomach that I'm
just going to end up using mandrake or bsd.. I really wish os x would be
ported over tho..

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ question

inching up the pitch would be the key, doing it slowly without noticing, or
sometimes in some tracks it might be in the right place to actually sound
good to notice it. And the easiest place is in the breaks or ambient, and
the tempo being a bit higher when the buildup to beats hit the floor again.
Is a common sense maneuver, makes sure it isn't noticed, or sounds good if
it is, but yeah, the only way to increase it is with increasing the pitch,
but there are a few records out there that the BPM increases during the
track.

the pitch control? I'd never noticed this, but I guess this must be

Subject: [sfraves] Fw: Burning Man 2001

 Hey there,

Well it's almost time for me to go to the Playa.  I havent caught to much
discussion about BurningMan this year but it is almost time.   I am a little
bummed do to preperations for the Burn I could not make it to Trees N Beats,
I loved it last year and it sounds like everyone caught the Beats in the
Trees again this year!

Well back to Burning Man, I will be camping at "The Restauraunt at The End
of the Playa" next to ThunderDome.   I have my 64 Overlander Airstream to
look for and it should be sporting my NetworkGirl Flag.   Be sure to stop
by.

Who else is making the trip this year?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

Well, I have used every OS Microsoft has made and started beta testing with
the Chicago project which evolved in to Windows 95.  Same with the Office
suite as well.  Windows XP will eventually be the predominant Operating
System because it has the stability of the Windows 2000 NT Kernel with the
compatibility to Windows 9x/ME that Win2K was lacking.

People tend to give Microsoft a bad rap when in reality Windows 3.11 was
stable considering what it really was, which is a first version.  Sure you
will see people claiming to have copies of Windows 1 and 2, but in reality
they were developer previews and internal test applications and not really
for everyday use.  So for being a first version it was pretty stable and I
think most of the problems that people had with it were related to
configuration, driver issues and the fact that people just did not take the
time or effort to learn to configure and tweak the system properly.  Those
who did will tell you the same thing I am telling you.  As for Windows 95,
it added more features and was very stable, even more stable then Windows
3.11 the only problem is that people who had older hardware and unstable
Windows 3.11 setups wanted the upgrade to work miracles and fix all of their
problems and it didn't.  It wasn't designed to do that.  Windows 95b was
actually even more stable then Windows 95 or even 95a because it did not
support upgrades and had more drivers.  Windows 98 built upon the stability
of Windows 95, but added the integration of Windows and Internet Explorer
and there were problems with the upgrade so once again the uninformed blamed
the OS, not their hardware or setup.  Windows 98 Second Edition fixed a lot
of the stability problems with the IE 4 / Win Explorer merger and led way to
Windows ME which was basically created for the machine manufacturers so that
they could have better rollout tools and an easier way to add all of the
security and service pack and hot fix updates released by Microsoft over the
year since the release of Windows 98.  It also started using a new driver
model closer to that of Windows NT/2K.

Windows XP will replace Windows 98/Me and it will happen very fast because
manufacturer's will begin to stop making windows 9x/Me drivers for their
hardware and once that is done, it usually signals the death knoll for the
operating system.  It's what happened to Windows 3.11 previously.
Understand I am not a Microsoftie, I believe they could do much better then
they have done, but I also believe that they are not nearly as incompetent
as the Linux'ers and Mac'ers wanna make them out to be.

Try looking at older versions of the Mac OS and see how unstable and how
easily it ate itself.  There is no real future in Linux, as it was hyped
like .COM's and with their death knoll signals the same for Linux.

I still use Netscape not only because it's not MS, but b/c IE has these
little annoying 'features' that you can't change.  There's only one or two
in netscape, but netscape takes a lot more memory... Basically, netscape
would kick ass if it was kept up to date and some serious work was done on
the browser portion.. I haven't tried opera in a while, so I'm downloading
it now.  I haven't bothered to even look at XP, from what I've heard, it
will suck.  I use win2k here at work, and it's so-so, I still run 98 SE at
home (most of the time) due to compatibility issues.  I'm not too thrilled
with 2k, so  don't see how XP could be an improvement.  Orginally I hoped
to use netscape until a better OS came out, but it doesn't look like that's
going to happen any time soon.  I have sinking pit in my stomach that I'm

Not based on NT?  How do you figure it is not based on NT?  It is the same
kernel as Windows 2000, same driver model as well.  The stability comes from
the NT Kernel which is based on ring 0, ring 1 architecture.  The kernel
runs in ring 0 and controls all hardware access, programs and drivers run in
ring 1 and cannot directly access the hardware.  This model means that
shoddy programmers and those who do not follow the rules cannot write
programs that can potentially make a system unstable.  The downside is that
there is no way to protect against programs with memory leaks and drivers
that are just unstable.

The added compatibility modes that allow you to run programs as if they were
running under Windows 9x/Me means that more games will run.  Once
programmers begin writing for the new Kernel, then you wont have
compatibility issues like we have seen in the past.

It may look a little too user-friendly, but it really is quite stable and
you don't need to restart as much.  It screams on my roommate's P4.

Give it a shot!

I know, and I wish it wasn't so.  I dropped out of programming because I=20
didn't want to deal with the higher level math (two semesters of calc was=20
enough).. but I fear I may go back into it, because no one is writing the=20
programs I feel should exist, save gaming code.  Why can't coders through=20
as much effort as one major gaming title into a decent OS?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ question

see, that is one way of doing it, or the way which i
like to use is not to vary pitch control at _all_ but
use records of differing feel. tempo does not ==
energy, sounds, and feel of a record == energy. you
can have the deepest smooth soothing house record at
130 bpm, and right beside it have a floorfilling
bangin diva track chuggin along at 130 too..its jus
how the sounds are put together...

so i'd suggest trying this..working with deeper more
minimal, floaty soft feeling tracks and working into
harder feeling more driving and stompy records to
entice a crowd into a frenzy...

Not based on NT?  How do you figure it is not based on NT?  It is the same
kernel as Windows 2000, same driver model as well.  The stability comes from
the NT Kernel which is based on ring 0, ring 1 architecture.  The kernel
runs in ring 0 and controls all hardware access, programs and drivers run in
ring 1 and cannot directly access the hardware.  This model means that
shoddy programmers and those who do not follow the rules cannot write
programs that can potentially make a system unstable.  The downside is that
there is no way to protect against programs with memory leaks and drivers
that are just unstable.

The added compatibility modes that allow you to run programs as if they were
running under Windows 9x/Me means that more games will run.  Once
programmers begin writing for the new Kernel, then you wont have
compatibility issues like we have seen in the past.

an improvement over Win2k.  Mainly because the whole
architecture of the OS is new, not based on NT.

It may look a little too user-friendly, but it really is quite stable and
you don't need to restart as much.  It screams on my roommate's P4.

Me too!

I still use Netscape not only because it's not MS, but b/c IE has these
little annoying 'features' that you can't change.  There's only one or two
in netscape, but netscape takes a lot more memory... Basically, netscape
would kick ass if it was kept up to date and some serious work was done on
the browser portion.. I haven't tried opera in a while, so I'm downloading
it now.  I haven't bothered to even look at XP, from what I've heard, it
will suck.  I use win2k here at work, and it's so-so, I still run 98 SE at
home (most of the time) due to compatibility issues.  I'm not too thrilled
with 2k, so  don't see how XP could be an improvement.  Orginally I hoped to
use netscape until a better OS came out, but it doesn't look like that's
going to happen any time soon.  I have sinking pit in my stomach that I'm
just going to end up using mandrake or bsd.. I really wish os x would be
ported over tho..

 Hey there,

Well it's almost time for me to go to the Playa.  I havent caught 
to much
discussion about BurningMan this year but it is almost time.   I 
am a little
bummed do to preperations for the Burn I could not make it to Trees 
N Beats,
I loved it last year and it sounds like everyone caught the Beats in the
Trees again this year!

Well back to Burning Man, I will be camping at "The Restauraunt at 
The End
of the Playa" next to ThunderDome.   I have my 64 Overlander Airstream 
to
look for and it should be sporting my NetworkGirl Flag.   Be sure

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

Do you work for Microsoft's PR department or did you just copy all of that
from Microsoft's website?

With pretty much Microsoft product I have ever used, I have gone through
these steps:

1) Oh *gag*, another Microsoft program that's gonna suck?
2) Oh wow, that actually looks kinda cool, maybe I'm wrong about all this.
3) Hey, that's also a pretty good idea, maybe Microsoft has finally made
something that doesn't suck.
4) Okay, this works, that's kinda weird how they put it together, though.
5) WTF is going on? Ok, I must be retarded or something.
6) Nono, I'm not retarded, this program most definitely sucks.
7) Nono, it can't be. How can a program possibly be this retarded? Did it
just do what I thought it did?
8) Dammit! It just crashed again!
9) Ok, I AM retarded for still using this thing. Jesus Christ.

The only exception to this rule has been IE for the Mac. It's not perfect,
but in reality, Netscape just sucks so much, I have nothing to truly
complain about. But then again, the exception proves the rule, eh =P

Ok, I'm trying to figure out if you really believe this, or if you're just
trying to save your job at this point. If hype were the sole indicator of
failure, then Microsoft would have been dead in the water years ago.
Microsoft is no stranger to hype. Don't confuse the dot-com mess with a
software movement that has generated quality, reliable software. Linux is
doing just fine.

Subject: [sfraves] ***BREEDER @ ASCENSION TONIGHT***

ah! the all important question. We've got residents playing until 12 (BRD, 
Fuckwork and introducing L.R.) and then we've got the huge, crazy
stylings of Rowan Blades a.k.a. BREEDER! I'm totally psyched about this...as 
it's my 2nd to last Ascension before i head back to the east coast...and 
everyone's gonna be there tonight. oh the antici...PATION!

Here's the official BSP below:

By sheer persistance to bring you the best events in the east bay, we 
managed to nab one of the hottest producer / DJ's in the world:

Rowan Blades (a.k.a. Breeder)
This man has done remixes for the likes of Orbital, Planet Perfecto, Tilt, 
and has records out on F.F.R.R. and Hooj Choons. Read more about him @ 
http://www.gatecrasher.co.uk/connected/djs/rowanblades/

He also runs a kick ass record store. Check it out at
http://www.rhythmsyndicate.co.uk/

We feel it's necessary to warn you that we WILL sell out. We only say this 
because Rowan Blades will be the most notorious DJ ever seen at Ascension. 
Furthermore, we've already been sold out for the last two months. We don't 
want anyone to be upset when they arrive after travelling a great distance 
to find they can't get in. So, come down early, have a drink or grab a bite 
to eat at the reastaurant upsatirs, and guarantee that you get to see one of 
the most incredible sets ever at one of the greatest club nights ever.

ASCENSION - Every other Thursday @ Blakes
2367 Telegraph Ave - Berkeley

But would you consider it ambient jungle, or atmospheric/soundscape
drum and bass? Perhaps a whole new vocabulary should be developed
to encompass the particular range of instrumentation and nontraditional
tunings used in present-day Win32 enterprise-class architectures. 

It's off-topic, but last week at DNA Lounge I saw Alan Cox and Andy
Tridgell doing Stoli shots in the goth room, and all of a sudden
Tridge jumps up and starts laughing and kind of monkey-skanking
around the dance floor just like Ballmer did in that video.  Then
he sees some guy wearing an IIS dev group t-shirt and Tridge just
goes NUTS, and he's like JUMPING on the guy's FACE with his 20-hole
hobnailed shitkickers, and screaming about Code Red and saying how
he's going to carve "GET /default.ida?XXXXXXXX..." on the poor frail
bastard's pigeon-breasted torso with this wicked tanto he's
brandishing, and then this big old-skool industrial-culture type
guy wearing a Windows Services for UNIX QA team shirt comes up and
he's trying to pull Tridge off the guy but it's too slippery to get
a grip with all the blood and everything, and out of nowhere Alan
grabs this wispy emo kid by his purple-black forelock and starts
just whipping the kid around like a set of weepy Dead-Can-Dance-listening
nunchucks and clocks the Services for UNIX guy and he's out, and
the emo kid runs off and writes a poem about it, and the bouncers
rush the floor and then it just goes downhill from there.  Richard
Stallman runs up and screams "It's really GNU/Linux!" and I snuck
in a quick rabbit punch just on general principles. The brawl got
kind of messy and last I saw they were bumrushing Alan and Andy out
the door and they're all laughing and shit.  jwz was really cool
about the whole thing, though.  Apparently it happens a couple times
a week. It's worse than the infamous Milpitas hip-hop/KanDeE-kid
escalation of February 2000.  I totally blame the Win32 supporters,
though, they're shady as hell.



Okay, it's really a shame I have to say this now, but experience shows I must:
THE ABOVE DOCUMENT IS SATIRE. NONE OF IT HAPPENED. OKAY, I DID GO
TO DNA LOUNGE AND IN FACT IT'S REALLY AWESOME AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
IT TO EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY FRIDAY NIGHTS. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE UP
THERE IS JUST A JOKE, INCLUDING THE MILPITAS HIPHOP KANDEE KID
THING. WINDOWS AS A SERVER PLATFORM IN AN ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT
IS A JOKE TOO.  APPARENTLY I HAVE TO REBOOT 2000 JUST TO CHANGE THE
VALUE THE SMTP SERVICE SENDS AS ITS HELO PARAMETER, WHAT KIND OF
BULLSHIT IS THAT?  AND WHO THE HELL WOULD WILLINGLY SELECT IIS FOR
WEB SERVICES AFTER LAST MONTH?  I STILL GET HUNDREDS OF CODE RED
HITS A DAY. I DO NOT ADVOCATE VIOLENCE AGAINST WINDOWS USERS OR
RICHARD STALLMAN.  THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS.


Can we please talk about raves now?

I'm all over it, of course.  I'll be at the Community Trance camp @ 
10:00 & Pantaloon (can we say large scale sound art?).  Um.  That's 
it.  We'll be having music from the general psytrance community 
Wednesday-Saturday nights (possibly Sunday as well... full 
moon!!!!!!) so come check it out if you're in the mood to dance at 
some point.

ready to burn,

Subject: [sfraves] Who is Not Going to Burning Man?

I think a good question to ask may be:

Who is not going & why?

Personally I become a little witch in the god awful heat plus that's just
too many ppl in the same place at the same time!  But I can definately see
the attraction to the Playa.  The crowd is like an artistic masterpiece in
it's self.

hmm musings of a bored corporate cube dweller,

	The tempo of the record is not always inline with the energy of
the record. You can have bumpin house that is way more energetic than
really fast minimal techno. At time in the night you can actually get a
dance floor going stonger by slowing down the tempo so the crowd can
groove to the beat. 

	And to those dj that do just bump up the tempo of the records
through out their set thinking that this will increase the energy of the
dance floor without thinking about the energy of the records themselves
and putting together a set that flows-you need to think things through a
bit more. Jungle Dj's that play records pitched up thinkin it's gonna get
the crowd going and think it sounds better that way, just make me walk
off the dance floor.

	FASTER IS NOT BETTER.

Not going because didn't have the means in time this year, and I want to 
have a dope little setup before I go out. Got the van though, and will 
hopefully be rolling out next year with a sick-ass setup.

Subject: [sfraves] DEA Chief Wanted to Attend Rave

--=====================_14611218==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


Even DEA chief had brush with club drug scene
August 23, 2001
BY FRANK MAIN CRIME REPORTER
He's the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
But like any other parent, Asa Hutchinson has the same struggles over how 
to react to the dangers of drugs.
Hutchinson, tapped in June to run the DEA, was in Oak Brook on Wednesday to 
address a conference on Ecstasy and other club drugs, an increasing problem 
for Chicago and the suburbs. He wove a personal tale of why he thinks DEA 
needs to do more to educate parents about the risks of club drugs.
After he was appointed to run DEA, Hutchinson said, one of his sons asked 
for permission to go to a "rave," a type of dance party.
"He said, 'Dad, I know there's always drugs out there, but you know I just 
want to hear the music,' " Hutchinson told a group of about 300 federal, 
state and local law enforcement officials.
Hutchinson said he told his son it wasn't a good idea, but his son 
responded: "If you have any doubt, why don't you go with me?"
Hutchinson agreed. His son was so proud his dad was going to the dance that 
he posted the information on a rave Web site. The DEA and other law 
enforcement agencies monitor such sites to track raves because club drug 
sales are common there.
"Pretty soon I had a call from Washington--the DEA. They said, 'Where are 
you going tonight?' They said, 'You can't go to that rave.' "
"I said, 'I have a son who's ready to go, and you better have a mighty good 
reason,' " Hutchinson said.
The DEA responded that agents planned to arrest the promoter of the rave 
for allegedly trafficking in Ecstasy, and Hutchinson decided to stay home.
Indeed, the promoter was arrested and about two weeks later, while out on 
bail, threw another rave in a Little Rock, Ark., warehouse, where a teenage 
boy died with club drugs in his system, Hutchinson said.
"The point of my story," Hutchinson told the group, "is how difficult it is 
to get the right information and make the right decisions." He added that 
"we do not do enough to help parents."
After Hutchinson's speech, Chicago police Supt. Terry Hillard and Cook 
County Sheriff Michael Sheahan agreed to launch a campaign to educate 
school superintendents and principals about club drugs, which they 
described as a growing scourge for teenagers and young adults in the region.
"This is something that kids think is safe to take," Sheahan said. "But I 
know of at least three cases in which kids died thinking they were taking a 
safe drug."
Beyond education, authorities think a new law taking effect in January will 
help curb club drug sales. A conviction for possessing 15 Ecstasy pills 
could result in a prison sentence of at least six years under the new 
legislation.
Club drugs have become a pervasive problem in DuPage County, and are 
flowing into suburban Cook County and the city of Chicago, officials said. 
In Chicago, police have seized more than 200,000 Ecstasy tablets so far 
this year, Hillard said.
"It's going to be like crack cocaine and heroin," he said. "It's here to 
stay."

Subject: [sfraves] Edmonton looks at rave age of 16

--=====================_15808888==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Council to look at rave age of 16
Stiffer proposals dropped by council committee
Sarah O'Donnell and Darren Stewart, Journal Staff Writers
The Edmonton Journal
Cinderella can stay at the dance as long as she wants, provided she's at 
least 16.
Proposals to close raves and after-hours clubs by 3 a.m., and kick out 
youths under age 18 by midnight -- the so-called Cinderella clause -- have 
been axed by city council's executive committee.
Instead, all late-night dances will have to bar anyone under the age of 16.
Council will debate the plan Aug. 28.
Cathy Pope, 17, said she agrees with City Hall's decision though she 
doesn't go to many raves or after-hours clubs.
"It's no fun to go out and party with 12-year-olds," she said. "And people 
under 16 shouldn't be out that late anyways, not to mention all the 
exposure to drugs."
Jessica Robinson, who just turned 16 and goes to after-hours clubs, was 
glad councillors didn't make the age limit 18.
"I can see the 16-year age limit being fair. When you turn 16 you like to 
have somewhere to go without all those younger kids there."
Fernando Cartagena, 20, goes to raves and has visited after- hours clubs 
frequently over the past three years. He said City Hall is wrong to be 
concerned about raves.
"You look around here and you see a lot of underage kids drinking," he said 
while sitting in the bleachers at Edgefest at Telus Field on Wednesday.
"Sure there's drugs at raves but there's a lot more security and control. 
Here we've seen two fights already today and people are smoking marijuana 
and security just turns a blind eye."
He said the over-consumption of alcohol, which isn't served at raves and 
after-hours clubs, causes more problems.
"Raves are a lot more peaceful than a scene like this," he said.
Rave promoters and club owners like the new plan, but not those working or 
living next to the permanent clubs. Many have complained about noise, 
vandalism and loitering.
"To the property owners in and around the downtown core, I'm sorry," said 
Coun. Robert Noce, voting in favour of the less restrictive bylaw. "I don't 
have a solution that would satisfy everyone. Maybe there isn't one."
With good-neighbour clauses that will be conditions for all-night clubs to 
receive a business licences, the new bylaw is tough, Mayor Bill Smith said.
"As we sort through the whole process of licensing, I think the 
neighbourhood will understand there's some real controls."
The decision in favour of allowing all-night dancing for anyone 16 and 
older came after an afternoon of discussion that included comments from 15 
members of the public.
In the end, those in the rave community got exactly what they were hoping 
for, said Mike Peebles of Rave Safe and Oliver Friedmann, owner of Therapy, 
an after-hours club.
"I think some reasonableness broke out in there," Friedmann said after the 
meeting. "This is one of the most comprehensive bylaws in the country in 
terms of the permit requirements."
But Lillian Pushor, general manager of Alberta Suite Hotel, which is near a 
few clubs, said she still worried club owners wouldn't face any 
consequences if they contravene the bylaw.
"If at some point in time we get the bylaw officers in place, the resources 
they need to enforce the bylaws, then maybe this can work," she said. "We 
want to offer our guests who come into the city of Edmonton or our 
residents in the downtown area, a safe and peaceful place to be in the 
hours, especially between midnight and 7 a.m."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

I was speaking about windows, not necessarily all MS products.  I don't 
have any problem with DOS - it was quite stable.. win311 was just a simple 
gui that floated over dos.. Once I realized how shitty 311 was, I didn't 
use it, and kept using straight dos until 95 came out.  I've also tested 
developer and beta versions of the different winbloze.. the only difference 
between beta and gold is the quantity of bugs.  I have always used latest 
hardware, the newest drivers, and winbloze still can't keep up.  If XP 
doesn't allow full control over hardware, the way 98 does and 2000 and NT 
do not, I doubt it will spread all that quickly.  I'm also not to keen on 
the integration of browser and OS.  They should remain completely 
separate.  Linux isn't about hype.  It's free.  Anyone can develop for it, 
and all the secure internet servers are running a unix variant.  Yes, I'm 
daring you to say that IIS is secure.  Unix was written by Bell Labs in the 
late 70's, long before windows was conceptualized.  It's certainly not 
going anywhere.

Office products are a lot like AOL.  They assume you're completely 
retarded, and if you try to do something specific, it won't let 
you.  That's not quality programming.

yet another day in the sun (and wind), with my beautiful homies, and too much beer =)

Thanks kids for bringing me the beats that cured my head, I need them, even tony's porno house set, hehe, actually I probably needed that most of all.  Heh.

I rememeber looking around throughout the day and thinking how glad I am to know all these kids as my brothers and sisters and act like a goofy freak without any cares!  (sorry if I spilled on you, those damn cups, its sorta hard to keep whats in them, in them, hehe.)

I enjoyed being a "social butterfly" with all of you, and leave it to ASR to bring out only the best in what we all call HOUSE MUSIC.  I had to act like a little brat in order to catch a little of Joe Rice's set, but it was worth it, all the djs that I was able to catch brought me a little closer to the house, Tracy (omg), Orestes, and Joe, and I think I missed a couple djs do to being a total lagger (crisco, the one and only ;)

gee, I love my lil family, every single one of you :P

( and I might have left my trash, and if I did, please, please, please, KICK MY ASS next time you see me, thanks)

Jess

I get very limited vacation time.. to go to BM I'd want to be there all the 
time... which would be fun, but a horrible waste of my precious vacation 
time.  I'd much rather spend the time with my family.. The cost is also a 
little prohibitive, but that's not the main reason.

Subject: [sfraves] eat before you go out and dance :) nrr

some of you will not like this idea, however, i have
always been big on reminded my friends to eat a good
dinner 
before going out to dance at a rave or a club..most of
the time, i have been getting reactions like, "NO"...
that is because i have met a lot of people who like to
take drugs, and if they eat, then the drugs won't be
as potent...
they want to do as much damage to their bodies and
possible...
or, they might get sick from the food that they need
to live, because they ingested some poison (a.k.a. too
many drugs..what happens when you get old and have 
to take more drugs?? don't take too many drugs while
you still can)...also, there are 
a lot of people on a diet of some sort, because this
is AMERICA, where people do not eat to live, but gorge
because 
there is abundance, and then they become abundant and
thus there is a market for more pills and drinks to
burn fat or to 
lessen the appetite, and for machines that make people
look 
really wierd, but they are just trying to burn
calories, and in other countries, they think we are
FAT and DUMB...okay, but you do need to eat to live,
and if you 
have a balanced dinner before you go out, then you
will feel 
really good, plus your food is fun to eat..make sure
you get a balance of protein and carbohydrates and
have some 
vegetables and a piece of fruit or a glass of juice
too. if you eat these things...SLOWLY..enjoy
them...eat your 
salad last not first...you will be able to eat a lot,

You guys should note the exact location of Nocturnal Wonderland.... its
actually technically in Needles, CA I believe. Its not a Lake Havasu proper.
Its at the "Lake Havasu Landing Resort" or something (check the website to
be sure of all of this). So if you are flying in to LV... you're probably
going to have to drive a decent distance and I can only guess that most
people in SF dont have a car waiting for them in LV, so you'd have to add
rental car prices and gas onto that.

"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

Right on Damien.  I went throught those same steps quite a lot myself.  Well,
that was before I decided to quit being played the fool and swear off that
filth that spews forth from seattle alltogether.

It suprises me to no end tho, that even here in the bay area that there are so
many people so anxious to suck up to gates and be one of his minions.  I'd
feel... well... dirty... whoreing myself out like that.

You should try Omniweb.  It's really quite excellent and serves as my primary
webbrowser now.  It's faster, uses less memory, locks up less, and is less
buggy than IE.

See, IE is just a mediocre Carbon port of the existing explorer code.  Omniweb,
on the other hand, is a fully native Cocoa application, created by The Omni
Group.  Actually, it originated as a NeXT application, but Cocoa basicly IS all
of the NeXT frameworks... one of the BEST development environments the world's
seen.  They just dusted it off and made it look better to reintroduce them as
Cocoa.  That and Cocoa now supports Java as a native development language as
well as Objective C.  It has quite a history of stable, reliable, excellent
service.

Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend you give Omniweb a try.  The only drawback is that
it doesn't support some plugins.  So if you're on a site that uses the more
obnoxious ones, you might load IE just for that site.  Otherwise, Omniweb is my
primary browser now.

Oh, BTW... yours is one of the birthdays this weekend, along with Becca, yes? 
Happy Birthday!  You should go to Sound Aslyum... it's gonna be SWEET.  But
whatever you do, have fun.


cya,
john

The web is TV II, the sequel. It sucks, so don't use either. If you can't
find it on a gopher server it isn't worth reading.

*smirk*

But, if you must (and you probably must) I'd say IE is better these days and
if you use Windows, you might as well use it. I never used to use Windows at
all, but the fscking winmodem in my laptop isn't supported by Linux (yes,
I've checked into linmodem.) Oh well... so much for my professional slogan,
"I don't do Windows."

I recently stopped using Netscrape 6 myself because it crashed all the time.
The mail reader really screwed up on occasion too.

I have to say that if you don't want to use IE because you prefer to boycott
MS, I support you wholeheartedly... but then you might as well get rid of
winblows too.

As far as browser extensions... I don't see anything wrong with them. IFRAME
is a fine tag, but I never include it in any HTML that *I* write. The onus
is on the web developer to disregard non-standard extensions. The browser
developers should feel free to extend their own browser at will. If a
particular extension is really useful, it will be picked up by other
browsers and eventually standardized. On the other hand, the browser
developers do have a duty to implement the relevant standards properly and
as completely as possible. I honestly don't know how IE measures up on that
score these days.

Subject: [sfraves] (bsp) just added to Myx from NYC...

Just a note to those coming to Myx at Mission Rock on friday...

We(Viberation) will be collaborating on a multi-screen install with a 
NYC Visuals artist, Kaesha KVK from the 23 Windows crew. Not too 
often we get treated to the visuals flavor of the east coast, I'm 
looking forward to it. I believe it's her first time out here, so 
come on by and say hi to the video freaks =)

oh, and we'll be at Electronica Optica on Saturday too, playing 
visuals alongside Greg Sandler's set. Props to Radley on pulling out 
a lineup with so many VJ's.

And then of course there's AEC on friday, we'll hit up the tail end 
of that. I've heard tons of rumors that Jessica Alba will be there, 
can't miss that!!!

oh and U-dub, and O-world happenin' too...busy busy weekend....Sheesh!

Subject: [sfraves] song id

anyobody help me with this one? not sure how old it is, but it's kind of a 
freestyle joint, or maybe deep/tropical house, with a very joyful group of 
people singing a catchy melody in spanish. unfortunately, the only word that 
sticks out from this melody is "allegria" but it IS featured pretty 
prominently.

driving me crazy because i can't remember where i heard it.

thanks a million...

I used to live in Lancaster, PA. Intercourse, Blue Ball, Paradise, and
Reamstown are all in Lancaster County. I think Virginville is closer to
Philly, a little northeast of Lancaster. I don't know of any Skanksville
though. Where the hell is that?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] eat before you go out and dance :) nrr

It's true!!  If i eat a good spagetti before going out clubbing, I can dance
so much more with the energy I've gotten!!  Of course, I don't do drugs but
still--its all about the dancing, and if food will keep me going then it is
good.  Just one thing:  Isn't it better to have your salad BEFORE your meal?
I heard that it's much healthier for your digestion to start out with fresh
fruit or vegetables.

Peace!

Subject: [sfraves] eat before you go out and dance :) nrr
Importance: Low


some of you will not like this idea, however, i have
always been big on reminded my friends to eat a good
dinner
before going out to dance at a rave or a club..most of
the time, i have been getting reactions like, "NO"...
that is because i have met a lot of people who like to
take drugs, and if they eat, then the drugs won't be
as potent...
they want to do as much damage to their bodies and
possible...
or, they might get sick from the food that they need
to live, because they ingested some poison (a.k.a. too
many drugs..what happens when you get old and have
to take more drugs?? don't take too many drugs while
you still can)...also, there are
a lot of people on a diet of some sort, because this
is AMERICA, where people do not eat to live, but gorge
because
there is abundance, and then they become abundant and
thus there is a market for more pills and drinks to
burn fat or to
lessen the appetite, and for machines that make people
look
really wierd, but they are just trying to burn
calories, and in other countries, they think we are
FAT and DUMB...okay, but you do need to eat to live,
and if you
have a balanced dinner before you go out, then you
will feel
really good, plus your food is fun to eat..make sure
you get a balance of protein and carbohydrates and
have some
vegetables and a piece of fruit or a glass of juice
too. if you eat these things...SLOWLY..enjoy
them...eat your
salad last not first...you will be able to eat a lot,
and you will not gain weight if you don't want too,
because
this balance helps your body to burn energy more
efficiently, and also you are helping your body to
live and
breath and you are sending all sorts of good things to
your muscles and your brain when you do this...:)

bullshit. You CAN'T eat before you go out. That's the
dumbest thing to do. Because if you do, you're just
NOT going to stop. NO WAY. Even if you think you are
mentally strong, you are NOT. Because even if you
decide to just get a little snack, you're going to
forget once you open your cousin's fridge and see
gourmet delight, and then your ass will keep eating
and munching and eating and munching and eating till
your pants size jump 3 sizes and your body explodes,
and that's just gonna fuck up your digestive system
totally. How are you gonna go to the party, much less
dance if your ass can't even walk and move out the
door? And worse, what if you end up having to take a
fat shit at a party? That is ultimate grossness. And
what kind of people shit at parties anyway? The stupid
ones who just ate before going out!

And if some of you don't know why people have the
incredible urge to eat more than they should just
right before a party, then you're stupid too and
you're missing out.

FOOD - Know when to say when.

"eat before you go out and dance"?

I always thought it was "eat out before you go and dance".

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

Ok, I just wanna say a couple things here..  First of all, 3.1, 95, and 98 are
all just guis floating over DOS, I used to have my 98 box set up with bootgui=0
and I could start and exit windows to and from DOS just like I could in 3.1. 
Second of all, the browser integration thing already happened, get over it.  In
98 watch what happens if you stop the program explorer, also try putting a URL
in windows explorer rather than iexplore, does the same shit.  Microsoft merely
called them different things to try and get around the integration anti-trust
crap..
Finally, the seperation of software and hardware levels NT/2k uses is called
the Hardware Abstraction Layer, or HAL, and it's a good thing, I've had my
win2k box up for months at a time, and I have a shitty USB CD-rw which would
crash it daily if it wasn't for HAL.(well, mostly cause I turn the thing off
and on without warning the PC, but it's got a mind of it's own, this whole USB
mess)

Luckily I figured out that the sony spressa USB CD-rws are just IDE cd-rws in
USB adapted boxes, and I took mine out of the box and put it in an ide slot, so
it no longer has an attitude..

Now, can we PLEASE go back to talking about raving on this rave list?

I was speaking about windows, not necessarily all MS products.  I don't 
have any problem with DOS - it was quite stable.. win311 was just a simple 
gui that floated over dos.. Once I realized how shitty 311 was, I didn't 
use it, and kept using straight dos until 95 came out.  I've also tested 
developer and beta versions of the different winbloze.. the only difference 
between beta and gold is the quantity of bugs.  I have always used latest 
hardware, the newest drivers, and winbloze still can't keep up.  If XP 
doesn't allow full control over hardware, the way 98 does and 2000 and NT 
do not, I doubt it will spread all that quickly.  I'm also not to keen on 
the integration of browser and OS.  They should remain completely 
separate.  Linux isn't about hype.  It's free.  Anyone can develop for it, 
and all the secure internet servers are running a unix variant.  Yes, I'm 
daring you to say that IIS is secure.  Unix was written by Bell Labs in the 
late 70's, long before windows was conceptualized.  It's certainly not 
going anywhere.

Office products are a lot like AOL.  They assume you're completely 
retarded, and if you try to do something specific, it won't let 
you.  That's not quality programming.

What: Huge free concert
When: August 26
Where: Crissy Field
Why: To support the MUD NOW campaign -- the November election will
determine the future of public ownership of power in San Francisco and
Brisbane.
Public ownership of power represents a major battleground in the war
against corporate domination of our social and economic interests. PG&E,
Enron, and other major multi-nationals are pumping millions of dollars
into the campaign to defeat us.
All we have to fight their power is YOU -- the grassroots people and
organizations that won a progressive Board of Supervisors for San Francisco.
Join us in this battle - the San Francisco-Brisbane MUD NOW campaign.
Who Will Be At The Concert:
Ramblin' Jack Elliott
Jello Biafra
The Holmes Brothers, gospel legends
Peaches with Bonnie Prince Billy aka Will Oldham
Bardo Pond
Tom Ammiano
Mamadou Diabate, from Mali
Santiago Jimenez, Jr., Tejano music pioneer
Nels Cline Singers
Faust & Shortee
And for ravers: Psychofunkodiscodelic Sunset DJ's -- Laird, John
Pickett, Laron, Galen, Solar
We need 100 volunteers to help set up, clean up, act as security, or
dance. To volunteer, e-mail Charles Kalish" at chkalish@ix.netcom.com.

Fuckin A man, it's good to see another CRX fan on the list..  I love my CRX..
even tho some ass cut me off and it's now a somewhat wrecked CRX it's still a
pimp little car..  1 12 inch sub and I got mega bass(try that in your SUVs),
plus I don't hafto give everybody and their cousin a ride cause hey, it's a 2
seater!(not that I don't like giving friends rides, it's just that for a few
years I was THE party taxi and I got tired of it..)

So yeah, CRX fans unite! :)

I guess since I'm already posting I may as well include my review of
ascension..
To put it mildly, ascension ROCKED tonite!  I saw a bunch of old friends, met
more new ones(like always), and just generally had a great time..  The only
weird thing is I always thought Breeder would spin trance, being that almost
all of his remixes are trance, but no, it was some shake yo ass house, which
was a pleasant surprise actually.  Normally I have difficulty dancing to house
but his was so good it forced me to shake my ass on the dance floor!  I hella
didn't want to leave, but my ride was tired and has to work in the morning or
something, so oh well..

Is it just me, or are there more people OUTSIDE of ascension than inside now? 
I met like 6 people outside that were there all nite and didn't even go in at
all..  I guess if you just like to socialize that's coo, but personally I gotta
dance, that's the whole point of going to a party isn't it?

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: a new flavor of house; 'Zami'



 As most of you know, House grew out of the perpetual search for a
distinctive style demanded by Gay Dance clubs. Maybe it is because The gay
world was so cut off from the mainstream, it formed in the underground.
Maybe the atmosphere was more open to innovative styles. Whatever the
contributing factors were, many of these same contributing evolutionary
factors have spawned a whole different approach to House.
This different style is being born as we speak in the few and hard to find
Lesbian House parties. What forces this distinctive style to be different
than male gay house or straight house is the rhythms and musical styles that
the typical Lesbian dance club is rooted in. Hip Hop, Latin, classic disco,
and an appreciation of  lyric and melody from the stronger folk music roots
of lesbian entertainment.  These styles dominate Lesbian clubs to the point
of strangling their very attendance. But some women like house. Or should I
say some lesbian and dyke DJ's put their foot down and say enough is enough!
I will spin house. But the Lesbian/Dyke crowd is slow to give up old
standards and these very same DJ's must mix in old standards that the core
group can dance to.
Instead of this being a bad thing. At least one DJ does this with great
style. And it is this kind of energy and innovation (I feel) that keeps the
genre of house from becoming stale. Lesbian/Dyke House is a variety of
styles mixed together to elevate the dancer to a different plateau. It is
kind of neat to be around, see the different styles fuse and begin to go
somewhere. I think you will agree that this is a flavor full of female
energy.
DJ OlgaT is this DJ who has put down her foot and said "I will spin House".
And her club (ZAMI) tonight (Friday) is open to all people. Not just women.
It is held at the STUD at ninth and Harrison. Doors open at 10pm. OlgaT goes
on around 11pm. Let her know what you think.
If you do not respect women, whatever their individual choices are, please
do not waste your time here. It is not your scene.

Subject: [sfraves] * Ticket info update for SAII * bsp

Greetings all!

This will be my second to last post regarding *SOUND ASYLUM II*, happening 
TONIGHT!!!  whay!!!!!!!!!!

We're super pumped about this party, decorations are looking incredible!  We 
also got some dope lighting & lasers... so when you all enter the venue, 
you're gonna be saying, "wow!" (or something to that effect... yeah).

Anyhow, on to ticket info:
- Presale tickets are available for $24 at the following locations:
Skills - berk
Frequency 8 - sf
Sticky Vinyl - vallejo
Harmonics - santa rosa
Solid Grooves - santa clara
Subsonic Underground - sac

- If you can't make it to any of the presale outlets before they close, we 
*will* be selling tickets up until midnight tonight.  (this is contrary to 
what the flyer says, so ignore that doo dah)
You can get these tickets at Sticky Vinyl, 501 Georgia St., Vallejo, 94590.

Alright, again the party's gonna be a) off tha hook, b) 16+, c) starting at 
9pm & going until 4am, d) located at a very clean, safe & permitted venue, 
e) stuff.  For reals, though, it's gonna be fun!

Hope to see you there!  Info line:  415 267 3992.
Flyer images:  http://www.dj-d.com/flyers/soundasylum2.jpg
My next post will have the DJ time slots.

Thanks & Much Love!!!

Denise :)

Subject: [sfraves] sound asylum!  roll call and tix

my crew and i will be partying tonight!  come up and say hey.

i bought them at skills for $26, but will sell them for $24.  drop me an 
email if you're interested.  i work in the city (and will have the tix with 
me) and live in the east bay near north berkeley.

Subject: [sfraves] [dfc] Mornin' drum roll...

Deepfog's Corner
Friday, August 24, 2001

------------------------
Mornin' Drum Roll
------------------------

I just wanted to share an incredible experience with all of you.

I went to a cool underground in Oakland on the night of August 18, 
2001, in a cool unused space that its only drawback is it is in the 
realm of the very chaotic neighborhood known infamously as the EBF 
House.  In that perimeter exists more cracked out shopping cart guys 
than anywhere in Oakland.  I don't care if you tell me that the 
Coliseum is the most unsafe neighborhood.  I agree with you...to a 
point.  I want you to understand that I lived in that neighborhood 
for long enough to know that it has a sort of evil, eerie entity that 
controls the riff-raff in that part of town.  And the riff-raff was 
certainly out in full force...shopping cart guys trying to knock down 
the fence that separated us...the neighbors 3 doors down throwing 
some kind of punk nurse nancy thing where they all got around to 
shoot bottle rockets all night...gee, personally, I can't think of a 
more meaningful way to spend my Saturday night...so they were 
shooting bottle rockets from midnight till 3 in the morning when we 
left and by that time they were shooting them directly at us!  I kid 
you not.

I ended up spinning at the afterparty they had down in San Jose. 
Fighting fatigue and slightly used equipment, I was not sure how long 
I was going to last...then at some point I got into an automatic 
groove and I literally did not know when, if ever, I was going to 
stop spinning records.  I was controlling the record players and the 
mixer...but it was no longer me mixing, but someone else.  I really 
felt like this was something that 'we' (all the minds in that room) 
participated in, and at that point I was no longer driving.  The 
turntables were driving themselves...has this ever happened to any of 
you?  I would love to hear about it.

...and I don't want anyone walking away from this email thinking this 
is me trying to tell everyone how good I am; there are plenty of 
folks be spinnin' out there in the rave world that got more practice 
than me, and that's why it was a rocky start, but then we got that 
'swishy' sound going for almost 3 hours...

I wanted to send my warmest hellos to the crew that made this little 
after party happen...David 'Dreamekore', the folks from Wevolve, and 
someone named Rene who jumped right out of the book I'm writing with 
those white contact lenses...if I got that all right.  Their group of 
people that enjoy the music enough to throw a free party for people 
that found out about it...it's people like you that make the scene 
fun for me.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Tech Support

All you tech geeks might appreciate this one. It's your friday 
pick-me-upper:)


Dear Tech Support:

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
slow down in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0 In addition, Husband 1.0
uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9, but installed 
undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. Conversation 8.0 no longer 
runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running 
Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do?

Desperate

***************************

Dear Desperate,

First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while
Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to enter the command:
C:/I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then 
automatically run the applications: Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But 
remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, 
Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create 
SnoringLoudly.WAV files. DO NOT install
Mother-In-Law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not
supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 
is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new 
application quickly. You might consider buying additional software to 
improve performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0, and Lingerie 6.9.

Good Luck,

Tech Support

that should improve your lack of love, should you be
lacking..not that i am into your personal business or
anything 
like that. i am not into drawing anyone to me.
regardez ce mec la...quelquefois, il est un peu
bete...things are 
often much more palatable in french, non? especially
for the non-thinker, which is why you might find
yourself 
purchasing products with french names or dating people
with french names...things just look and sound better
when they are  
french. i sure am glad that i actually have skills, if
i 
didn't, i might take a whole bunch of stuff personally
that really isn't personal at all. so, i hope EVERYONE
will 
be going to MEGGA-BUZZ, because not only does it
appear to be just fantabuluzzzz, but as well, the
money from the 
party will go into bringing back Homebase, and a lot
of us like going to Homebase for parties , and if you
never 
got to go to Homebase, you will be able to. It is
great fun to walk through the crowds of thousands of
non-bitter people, and to find people who like to
dance who 
will dance with you there, and to see the beautiful
videos projected on the big screens, and to hear
wonderful 
music, and then in the morning, you can have breakfast
at Denny's with friends or new friends or just chat
with 
the ladies behind the counter while you watch all of
the candy ravers parade into and fill the restaurant
with 
color and youth. oh, and not that this is very
important, 
but it might help some of you to better manage your
mood...i am not competing with anyone here, nor have i
ever 
been..it's not in my nature...even when i have been
participating in athletic events where the object is
to "win"..
i have not been competing in my mind, although, i
suppose it might appear that way sometimes. i do have
trophies and metals. :)

Subject: [sfraves] My Thurs Night--Ascension and the Afterparty

Hey all!
        Well, it's 11:26am, and I have just got home from the afterparty for
Ascension, and I can tell u, it was an awesome nite =)  I was late to
Ascension as usual (about 11:30) but it was still awesome.  I went inside
just as that U2 remix was playin.  BTW does anyone know the name of the
artist and the track????  N E ways, I really got goin during Breeder's
breakbeat-ish set (despite hitting unfortunate members of the crowd who came
too near as I flailed my limbs about!).  I was also happy to bump into
Aaron, Osby, Jamie, Jeff, peeps from the AEC crew (who I hope to see again
tonite) and many other cool peeps!
	At about 1:30 I'd gotten rid of my fliers for the afterparty, and my friend
Evan and I gave a lift to three cool Brits who had been here three days to
the afterparty.  There, I finally got to meet DJ Teks, who spun an awesome
set of trance (am listening to his promo CD right now which is tiiiight).
As RecoveringDJ did his wicked deep house set, I was trying to decide what I
wanted to do with my set, but as he left the decks, I randomly decided I'd
pick out all my most housey stuff and just beatmatch into his set.
	I'd never really done a housey type of set in front of a crowd before, and
it was wierd for me spinning at 130 bpm (as opposed to my usual 138) and it
was totally unplanned, but it went pretty well!!  After that, Nad Is Dog
(Dan) did a sweet NRG set which ended with me and him spinning head to head
with some dark acid techno.
	Finally, at 7am, it was time to drive the Brits (who were awesome and
totally made the party) back to Berkeley, where they were staying, (and
where I got the biggest smoothie I have ever experienced for breakfast), and
then the drive back.  Now I'm here, relating it all to you and probably not
making much sense due to lack of sleep lol.

Well, thanks to all those who showed up for making it a cool party, and to
those who I missed, no worries!!  I'll probably see u all at AEC tonite
(which i believe is going to rock).  Also, if anyone who came wants to get
in contact with me, this is my email so write back!

Well, it's now 11:46pm, and I am going to go to my bed and hope i can make
it there before crashing.

Peace!

Hahaha. Vraiment! Je sais que je la faire! Mais malheursement, je ne connais
personne qui ai un nom francais. Ou est-ce qu'on achete une jeune
francophone!!? =) Alors... that would be a nice combination of the two, non?

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

yes yes yes carl oh um Nomadic  it was a great night
to bump (no pun intended, teehee) in to friends last
night.  John B, Doug, Kiki girl, Chis aka tool_42,
Becca (happy birthday girl), Osby and his hats (who is
always eating by the way), Audra, Marianna, Melissa,
Lance, Ron, Dave M, Ryan, Ira, Laith aka Magick, My
fravorite staff members of Blakes, John, Joe and
Marco, Aaron (I am still looking for the website BTW)
any body i am missing i know there is but hi anyways.
So yeah I heard that U2 remix as well and i believe
that is the hybrid 2 remix or at least that is what
Dave said it was.  You might want to ask him to
clarify.  But yeah that track totally made the night. 
Oh my god the crowd loved it.  
I never made it out to the afterparty i am so sorry
but when i finally got out of that Jack in the Box
dive through line it was like 3am, so I decided to
just go home and get some sleep.
Well there is still so much to do today so I hope to
see some of you tonight at the AEC party.
Muahz to all of ya
Jamie Star
Oh and Thank you Chris aka Arson and Jessicka for
coming out and hanging with the crowd.

Hahah... My CRX is in the shop. And i'm trying to figure out why it's overheating. And why it didn't pass smog.. is yours fixed up?

I'm gonna keep my CRX forever.. everytime I step in someone else's car.. i'm like wtf?

CRX = a total driver's car.. i've never driven like a porsche or anything like that so maybe I'm wrong.. but I've driven mustang, camry, civic, eclipse, 3000gt, rx7, etc etc.. and nothing beats my car.

should hit me up when you got a problem, overheating is either thermostat, lack
of coolant(due to a line leak) or bad water pump..

Mine is as un-fixed up as it gets, it runs good, but looks like shit cause I'm
broke..

CRX's ride ok, little rough, but you get a really good feel for the road, so I
feel better doing crazy shit in it than I would in another type of car..
I actually got sideways a couple weeks ago for the first time ever in it, I
went into a turn WAY too fast and fishtailed it out, quite an accomplishment
for a front wheel drive that's super front heavy..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Ascension

Unfortunately, the Bicycle Time Machine encountered an ion storm on 
the way to Ascension and I got a flat.  I had to take a barge (BART) 
and walk it home.  Not fun when you have a flat.

I was thinking I was lucky I wasn't in like 17th Century France or 
something...I would have been stuck without a way to repair the tube. 
And did you know that bike tubes come with this green goopy stuff so 
you can tell where the hole is?

Anyway...so I took a ride this morning and I've already been to 
Ascension 2 weeks from now, and it was great.  I'll see you there. 
Look for a strange cloud...

Subject: [sfraves] Needs ride to Still Bubblin'-- Please be our hero!

Are any fellow Berkeleyans or super-dope bay area peeps willing to help a group of fun-loving, super-chill Berkeley students? 

Here's how.

Four (car-less) girls and one guy need a ride to and from Berkeley to the venue of Still Bubblin' (since it's rumored to be, much to our disadvantage, about a 20 minute ride away from Berkeley!. Still bubblin' was supposed to be two of the girls first raves and all the tickets are already bought so it will be a shame if we had to cancel. =( The group is willing to be split up and chartered by different rides if needed. We are located at 2400 Durant Ave in the Unit 3 residence halls in Berkeley. If you interested in helping us and hanging out I'll e-mail you with my cell phone number, a description of the group, and directions. We are willing to go at whatever time is convient for you guys. 

Please be our hero! Save our day and be rewarded with kickass company. We'll be eternally grateful and love you forever!

-Lil'Beans

Rowan Blades, more commonly known as Breeder, will

R O W A N B L A D E S
Career Rowan Blades is best known as half of the massively successful
Breeder. Breeder's first two singles, 'The Chain' and 'Twilo Thunder', have
sold in excess of 25,000 copies world-wide, having first come to prominence
on Sasha's near-legendary 'Global Underground - San Francisco' compilation.
'Twilo Thunder' has since gone on to achieve great commercial success with
lucrative licences to compilations from the Ministry of Sound and Euphoria
2, which have sold over 500,000 copies between them. Breeder's third, fourth
and fifth tracks, 'Tyrantanic', 'Rockstone' and 'New York FM' have been
showcased on Sasha and John Digweed's last 'Northern Exposure - Expeditions'
compilation, as well as on John Digweed's 'Global Underground - Hong Kong'.
With over 20,000 pre-sales for Tyrantanic, things look set to continue in a
similar vain to how they have started, and in doing so stamping out any
doubt that they are a 'one hit wonder'. This rapid rise to prominence has
resulted in several high-profile remix projects. These include Tilt's
'Children', Planet Perfecto's classic 'It's Not Over Yet', Brother Brown's
'Under the Water', Orbital's 'Nothing Left', and Evolution's 'Phoenix'. On
the back of this success, Rowan has started a new project with Gaetan
Schurrer, who has engineered for Sasha. With successful remixes of,
Orbital's 'Nothing Left' (FFRR), and of Space Manoeuvres 'Stage One',
released on Hooj Choons, as featured on Sasha's recent Global Underground,
they seem to have established themselves without even releasing their first
single.

Breeder's success on Rowan's own Rhythm Syndicate record label has boosted
the label to a position of prominence within the dance music community.
Rowan has since been able to sign four new tracks to Rhythm Syndicate for
release next year, and has prospective mixes from the likes of Slacker, Tilt
& Evolution to name a few. Add to this the status of Rhythm Syndicate
Records as one of the top 10 independent dance music stores in the UK,
helping compile Pete Tong's Buzz Chart play-lists for Radio 1, and Rowan's
record empire is one of the most influential in the country.
Rowan's DJ-ing career has taken him all over the world. Having played in
Britain for gigs like Bedrock & Gatecrasher the success of Breeder has
enabled him to elevate himself onto an international stage. Breeder is
currently the biggest selling non-pop dance act in Norway, Rowan has played
there with great success, as well as in Sweden, and at a gig for 14,000
ravers in Copenhagen. The burgeoning American demand for dance music has
seen Rowan play at the legendary Shadow Lounge in Miami, as well as boat
parties on the Hudson. The nascent Chinese scene has seen Rowan playing at
The Face in Canton, attracting only 100 people less than Paul Oakenfold!
Most recently, Rowan taken his Rhythm Syndicate record label and the Breeder

Subject: [sfraves] HOUSE MUSIC 101:  Issue 26 - The Beginnings of Chicago House

--=====================_19999353==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

"The beat won't stop with the JM jock.  If he jacks the box and the 
partyrocks.  The clock tick tocks and the place gets hot.  So ease your 
mind and set yourself free.  To that mystifying music they call the key."

-JM Silk, "Music Is The Key," 1985.

"All of the records coming out of New York had been either mid or down 
tempo, and the kids in Chicago wouldn't do that all night long, they needed 
more energy..."

"When we first opened (the Warehouse) in '78, I was playing a lot of the 
East Coast records, the Philly stuff, Salsoul.  By '80/81, when that stuff 
(disco) was all over with, I started working a lot of the soul that was 
coming out.  I had to re-construct the records to work for my dancefloor,to 
keep the dancefloor happy, and there was no dance music coming out!  I'd 
take the existing songs, change the tempo, layer different bits of 
percussion over them, to make them more conducive for the dancefloor."

-Frankie Knuckles on the Chicago gay dance community, in the "Electronic 
Mail and Guardian" magazine.



XXVI.  THE BEGINNINGS OF CHICAGO HOUSE


A.  WHO "INVENTED" CHICAGO HOUSE?

There is lots of drama and passion in the house community around the issue 
of who actually created or invented the Chicago house genre.  Personally, I 
believe this is like asking:  "Who invented the blues, rock, or disco?"  No 
one person is generally responsible for the birth of an important 
genre.  New music arises from the hard work and innovation of many 
producers and DJs as well as a myriad of other factors like culture, place, 
technology, economic opportunity, specific musical influences and, indeed, 
serendipity.

One could probably write an entire book on the subject of who invented 
house.  There are many who actively claim the distinction.  Before we begin 
a more satisfying and detailed discussion of the evolution of Chicago house 
I thought I'd present some of the more interesting myths and facts relating 
to this invention dispute.

Frankie Knuckles played a very important role by bringing dance music and 
culture from New York to Chicago and laying the foundation for Chicago 
house.  To my knowledge, however, he has never said he "invented" the genre.

Leonard Remix RRoy asserts that he gave birth to house on May 5, 1981.

LRRoy seems to have had a difficult, emotionally challenged life.  He gave 
up spinning after his mother died in 1985, joined the army to deal with his 
grief, and has recently, I understand, got behind the turntables again.

LRRoy was, by all accounts, a remarkable and much respected DJ.  He spun at 
the Rink Zone in the early eighties and won a legendary battle against 
Steve "Silk" Hurley at Sauers where Hurley was resident DJ.  The 
participants were Eric "ET" Taylor, Keith Fobbs,  Steve Hurley and 
LRRoy.  Hurley mixed a record backwards in that battle and played a 
prerelease copy of Jamie Principle's "Your Love."  Then LRRoy came on 
leading with "Big Bee" and totally rocked the crowd and the judges.  He 
walked away with the $500 prize.  It is said that Farley "Jackmaster" Funk 
refused to participate in the battle because he was fearful of losing to LRRoy.

Leonard claims he invented the term "house music" in the spring of '81.  He 
says he was mixing "Chance With You" by Brother to Brother at his home when 
his mother suggested he mix some of the other old music in the basement of 
their house.  Leonard did some edits on some old stuff like "Cathedrals" by 
D.C. LaRue and put the music in his mix.  When Lowell Tuff of the club 
Bitter End asked him what he was spinning, he replied:  "House music."

Then Chip E. is quoted as saying he created house music in March of 
1985;  and Farley "Jackmaster" Funk is alleged by some to have written and 
produced "Love Can't Turn Around," one of the biggest selling "House" 
records and he, therefore, invented house.  One could go on.

My sympathies in this house family drama have always been with Jesse 
Saunders.  Even before he began his one-man campaign in the late nineties 
to reestablish his role in the development of house, it was clear to 
everyone in the music and dance community that the first house recordings 
were issued by Saunders Jes Say label.

Further, there is general agreement that the first house music on wax was 
released in 1984.  That record was "On and On," written and produced by 
Jesse on his new label.  Next was Z Factor's "Fantasy"  produced by Jesse 
but released on another label.  The big house "cross-over" hit, "Love Can't 
Turn Around," was actually written, produced and arranged by Jesse.  He 
sang background on it as well, with Farley.  Jesse was in litigation over 
the copyright to this song and finally won in court all rights to "Love" 
from MCA Records.  Finally, Trax Records did not own the Jes Say 
catalog.  All music published by Jesse now belongs, I understand, to his 
current company Just Say Productions.

Jesse fought a long and hard battle to achieve the recognition he 
deserves.  His music has been stolen, copyrights have been infringed, and 
he has been the victim of much negative drama.

Jesse sees himself as the "originator" of house music.  By "originator" he 
means that he "...started and/or fused a sound with a lot of different 
ingredients, but was derived with the help of other influences (time, 
place, people, etc.)."  He does not claim to have invented or created the 
genre and admits that house would not exist without the likes of Frankie 
Knuckles, Vince Lawrence, Farley "Jackmaster" Flash and the Hot Mix 5 as 
well as the  promoters and labels that facilitated the distribution of 
early house.  House music, therefore, evolved as a collaborative 
effort.  Jesse sort of put the ingredients together.

Jesse also credits Frankie Knuckles' Warehouse as the venue where the term 
"house" originated.  The energizing music Frankie played came to be called 
"house," and was eventually applied to the genre.

On July 17th, 1997, the City of Chicago recognized his efforts by 
proclaiming a "Jesse Saunders and the Pioneers of House Music" day.

Fine.  I think most people can accept this reasonable interpretation of 
events.  I can live with it.  We will look at Jesse Saunders' creative and 
interesting house career in more detail later.



B.  AFRICAN AMERICANS CREATED HOUSE MUSIC

Like virtually every important American musical creation, house music was 
created in and by the African American community.

Further, house music evolved in a subset of that community:  the gay dance 
underground -- just as disco and garage in NYC blossomed forth from the 
black gay community.

Chicago house emerged from the ruins of disco, but with a flavor and 
texture that is uniquely Chicago.  For Chicago itself has a rich and varied 
musical culture that includes important innovations in jazz, blues and soul 
music.  Chicago was not a musical wasteland by any means when Frankie 
Knuckles moved from NYC to take up residency at the Warehouse.  Rather, the 
existing musical culture and the resulting needs of his Warehouse dancers 
shaped the music he brought from the East coast, and not visa-versa.

In the next issue we will briefly look at some of Chicago's modern music 
culture and its influence on the creation of house music.


NEXT:  CHICAGO JAZZ, BLUES AND SOUL

 So who else is freaking out?????
Okay, well, I do know that my friend in the UK will fucking drive to London to see Andy C., and for some reason, he wouldn't just drive an hour to see just ANY show he says.  I guess things are different there,  my friends and I drive to the city sometimes several times a week, an hour drive, but always worth it, where he lives (Basingstoke, an hour drive to London) he says people dont drive that far unless some sort of crazy star is in town, hence, Andy C., and doesn't he live there?
Okay, enough rambling, go, because if a crazy lil british junglist says so....it must be worth it....=)

Killa lineup? There is no House music, where's the House? that's wack. Poor 
Eddy, the token sacrifice.  that's like serving bloody red meat to a bunch

omg... it's soooo true about the Freshman invasion.. everytime I walk around UCB during my lunch break now, it's like all these kids running around and stuff... and it's soooo cute seeing the concerned and saddened parents dropping their kids off and helping them move their stuff in!  Weird and cute at the same time :o)

I'm so sad I'm not going to AEC tonight.... :o(  I'm sitting here looking at the clock and see that the first map point opens in 10 minutes and how much I want to go to it!   Oh well... I'll just be sad here at home, bored while everyone else in the house is sleepping... 

Well, for all the rest of you... have a great night whatever you're doing!  There were quite a few cool things happening tonight!

Be safe, have fun... and do something crazy for me!

Love, 

  Catt *meow*

   I have to get a futon mattress and a couple of small things out of my old 
apartment in San Francisco (near the big Safeway on Market) over to the house 
IM living in now in Oakland (between Lake Merrit/ Fruitvale) by the first of 
September. It's not a hard job at all. If anyone is willing to help me out, 
IM willing to pay for gas, or some cash along with my favorite bribery, buy 
you lunch or dinner. IM available anytime this Monday and Thursday or any 
other day after 7:30pm. Thanks for the help.
   Peace, love and hugs! Bodhi ^ _ ^

oh.my.god.

beautiful location, drunk as all fuck, passed out, but
still managed to spin a few records after ira.  did
you liked the hall and oates?  uh...hoping i didn't
offend anyone that much.  at any rate, the stickman
suit still fit pretty good...guess i haven't gained
_that_ much weight.  ;)

happy birthday becca and jamie...your day's not over
yet:  see you at the other world, and at the day party
on sunday.  i'll get you plastered.  absolutely.  uh,
yeah.

to "all":  breakfast at my house after the other
world.  bring your records.  hopefully i'll still be
standing.

Subject: [sfraves] Track IDs from Sound Asylum 2 please....

I was wondering if anyone could ID these songs for me:
1) The first song Greg Sandler played.  It had a guy saying something like 
"Why do I put up with this shit?"

2)The first song Thomas Trouble played.  It had a guy (sounded like Method 
Man) talking about different kinds of weed and chorus goes something like 
"Bomb, baby, Bomb"
 
3) Another song Thomas Toble played.  It was the remix of that song "Lazy 
Ocean."  (You know "When the rhythm starts to play, dance with me, make me 
sway, like a lazy ocean... etc.)  I want to know what version he played. It 
sounded different than the version I heard on the radio, so I'm thinking 
someone else did the remix he played.
                                                                              
    thanks in advance

As much as a designer hates to see their creation on either browser they
should always test and debug on both so there are minimal differences and

Subject: [sfraves] AEC Rocked! (kind a long)

Oh my gosh wow.  It's 11:36am and I just got home. 
And i couldn't stop smiling all the way.  It was one
of those night that you truly love being a raver. 
O.k.
So a friend of mine is visiting from Louisiana and
staying in Sac.  So Last night I went to go grab him
to go to the AEC party, Half way there I get calls
from my other friends that where suppose to come with
me last night and they tell me they are not up to it
anymore.  Well I went to get Brian from Sac. and on
the way down to the first map point we look at some of
his pictures of parties he's gone to and some that
he's thrown.  It's so cute he has this one pic of
Thomas Trouble at one of the parties he's thrown here
in the bay area with his infamous cigarette hang out
the side of his mouth. And he still has the ticket
from a party he went to here that says "Oakland
International Rave Center"  Thought that was cute. wow
so many pics and stuff it was great.
So map point to map point and we are off to the party.
Wow what a great spot. We waited for a bit for the
party to actually begin and wondered down to the
location.  
Is that jungle I hear?  Is that a girl at the decks? 
Is that AMBER spinning jungle?  Oh wow, i couldn't
believe it.  But yeah what a nice way to start the
night. DK came on with an NRG set.  Andy W played some
funky BOOTY HOUSE, haha got to love that guy.  IRA was
that trance i heard you doing?  And Michal aka the red
stick man did house, oh and yeah i did actually like
the Hall and Oats track thank you.
Chilled with Amber for a bit and i have to say she is
such an awesome chick. Such a wonderful persona, so
down to earth ya know.  Hehe was great chilling with
Andy W again.  Osby came out totally goth.  He was so
into character it scared me.  I was like Nooooo!!!
Where is osby and what did you do to him (good bye
tomorrow).  O.k. so my alter ego was a Kandy Kid (that
lasted fifteen minutes) and I had this interactive
teletubby (yes that was mine), Chris could not put it
down almost all night, I know it got passed around a
few times. Oh but then Chris gets up on the bulldozer
to dance.  Then i gaze in the distance and I am like
What the fuck is that.  Yes Yes Yes Michael brought
out his Red Stick Man Outfit.  What a fucken trip. I
was loven it.  That made the party. 
And such a nice turn out too I would have to say about
150 ppl there at it's peak.  Not bad for a party like
this one.
Hi to all I saw last night, Laith and roommate, Erika
aka kikigirl, Becca, Veronica, Ryan, Ira, Michael,
Andy W, Eric, Audra, Shannon, Ericka, Chris, Marianna,
Amber, Jim, Dave and Osby of course.
So About 7:30 we all start to head out, and I head for
Sac. to take Brian home.  Thank you guys for being so
hospitable to him, and showing him how we like to
party in the bay area. Brian have fun with dragn'fly
tonight at Smile. And safe journey home.
Every ones little Star
Jamie Star

Oh One last thing........
Alter Ego Crew fucken Rocks.  Thank you guys for such
an amazing night.

Hells yeah I agree 100% with Genone.. FUCK NETSCAPE...

Netscape is a thorn in my ass -- and you could
probably argue that I.E. promotes bad coding, since it
allows for you to make any number of mistakes and
still display the page properly, while Netscape is
most unforgiving.. 

BUT.  Netscape also has a number of weird-ass issues
concerning display and I waste more time trying to
iron out Netscape's quirky bugs when I could be coding
more pages..

Anyway, like Genome said, they are dropping out of the
browser market.. so hopefully won't have to deal with
it too much in the future.  And that's not to say that
I am supporting I.E. 100% either.. Microsoft sux too..
like i said before.. Opera is a kick ass
browser..(www.opera.com)

This is a totally ridiculous paragraph.  I'm sorry, I don't even believe
that this is the forum to have this discussion, but I can't let something
this incorrect pass for the truth around here.

Windows is not stable.  Period. End of sentence.  It hasn't been until
recently that Microsoft has even thought of it as any kind of priority to
deal with any kind of stability issues in their operating systems or even
their applications.

When people like myself talk about stability, we're not talking hours or
days.  We're not talking weeks.  We're talking months, at the least.
What's the longest you've had a Windows box of any flavor go 60 days
without needing to be rebooted?  NT and 2K may approach this kind of
stability, but the 9x/Me series could not go a month without crashing.

You want to talk real stability?  A real OS will be stable enough,
pay close attention here, that a machine running it will stay up
through an entire Microsoft product cycle.  I know of machines in people's
bedrooms that have run for two years or more without a reboot.

In my experience with these pieces of software, I've learned a thing or
two.  I know more about Windows than most people who support it, and I know
about Unix than most people who support (Ah! The joys of being an
engineer!).  

Do you know that in Canada, the highest tax bracket of their tax systems
starts pretty low, probably around $75,000/year?  Do know that their
highest tax bracket is 51%?  That's right, more than half of your income
goes to the government as tax.  That's a about a third more than,
percentage-wise than you would pay in the United States.

What's my point?  Saying that Windows is stable is like saying that
Canadians don't have high taxes: it's nuts.  In a world where all
definitions like this are relative, stable is not the way to describe
Windows.  You clearly either a) have no experience running a truly stable
operating system or b) have some other agenda that's making you lie.

Don't get me wrong I don't particularly like Netscape either and IE does
mask a lot of inconsistent coding.  And the differences in either browser
make designing cumbersome.

For upcoming web producers - you'll have to get used to compensating for
both browsers when designing.

I'll be checking out the Opera browser.

Rave Rage

By Jacob Sullum

Despite all the pot and LSD consumed at their concerts, no one ever tried 
to ban the Grateful Dead. But that's what the city of Chicago would like to 
do to raves, those all-night dance parties featuring electronic music, 
flashing lights, and silly hats.

The Chicago Tribune anxiously describes raves as "one-night-only 
parties...often held in warehouses or secret locations where people pay to 
dance, do drugs, play loud music, and engage in random sex acts." Taking a 
dim view of such goings-on, the Chicago City Council recently approved an 
ordinance that threatens building owners and managers who knowingly allow 
raves on their property with jail terms of up to six months. "They are 
after all our children," Mayor Richard Daley declared. "Parents should be 
outraged."

State legislators agree. The Illinois House of Representatives is 
considering a bill that would make it a crime to promote a rave where 
illegal activity takes place. According to the Tribune, the bill's 
supporters are "fine-tuning" their definition of a "criminal rave" so the 
legislation can "withstand a court challenge."
In New Orleans, meanwhile, the U.S. government is prosecuting a rave 
promoter and a concert hall manager under a federal law aimed at shutting 
down crack houses. Facing up to 20 years in prison if convicted, the 
defendants argue that the prosecution is a form of censorship.

"Holding club owners and promoters of raves criminally liable for what some 
people may do at these events is no different from arresting the stadium 
owners and promoters of a Rolling Stones concert or a rap show because some 
concert goers may be smoking or selling marijuana," says Graham Boyd, 
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Drug Policy Litigation 
Project. "If the government is successful in shutting down raves, what's to 
stop them from applying this tactic to other music genres...where drug use 
is known to exist?"

Mayor Daley is reportedly fond of jazz. Fortunately, that genre has never 
been associated with drugs.

Subject: [sfraves] "Down for the Get Down" [article]

more on Chicago's troubled rave scene...

-d 

DOWN FOR THE GET DOWN
Checking in on a much cautious rave scene a year
later
-words by Christine Hsieh
[ur chicago, Aug. 13Sept. 9]

There is no rave scene.  Its dead.
Is this dejected promoter right?  Over a year has
passed since Chicago laid down the law, so to speak,
that effectively shut down much of the citys
developing underground dance party scene.  Now, with
DJs and promoters alike facing fines of up to $10,000
from involvement wit unlicensed events, raves in
Chicago have turned towards a decidedly commercialized
feel in order to survive.
So gone are the days of burnt-out warehouses and
secret map points.  Replacing these formerly cherished
dens of iniquity are large venues (typically the
Harvey Expo Center or the Dolton Community Center),
large lineups and sky-rocketing prices.  There were
always big parties, but somehow it exploded because of
the media and drug use, observes Gabe Rodriguez,
promoter for the Treehouse Collective.  As soon as
[the media] put the spotlight on it, more people would
come and more people heard about it.  It wasnt
something that you had to figure out where it was,
something you had to look forit was right there in
front of you.
Now, with raves slowly edging into popular
consciousness, dissenting opinions and sometimes
unfavorable media coverage threatens to split up a
culture which prides itself on unity and respect. 
Nearly everyone these days, from the average dude next
door to Chicagos top officials, has heard stories of
dark warehouses filled with colorfully dressed youths
sucking on pacifiers, sporting plastic bracelets and
waving glowsticks about to deafening, repetitive
music.  [Lawmakers are] trying to associate these as
paraphernalia at a rave, complains Rodriguez. 
Theres hundreds of glowsticks over at Taste of
ChicagoI guess theyre having a rave.
In addition to heavy fines, strict building codes,
coupled with increasingly stringent inspections, make
the already difficult path towards securing proper
licenses more circuitous and troublesome.  Theres so
much policy going on right nowI think [city
officials] are just trying to shut the whole thing
down, speculates Alfonz de la Mota, DJ and promoter
for Boogie Tribe.  Thats what it looks like.  They
dont want to give us leeway, or let us hear music we
want to hear in the proper environment.  According to
de la Mota, even one exposed wire can shut down entire
proceedings for a party.
These laws, designed to eradicate raves from Chicago,
have successfully pushed most larger scale venues out
of the city and into the suburbs.  Thats not a new
phenomenon, but of late its become they only one;
every raver worth their salt knows of Harvey or
Dolton, the long lines to get into the venues, and the
feeling of condensed sweat dripping from the ceilings.
 Located outside city limits, these spaces do not fall
under any anti-rave ordinances.  [The venues] have a
history with rave promoters so they know whats going
on and make a lot of money, explains Matt Druid, DJ
and head of Bliss Industries.  Its very organized
now.  Its not like back in the day when you could
rent a warehouse and tell the owner you were throwing
a birthday party or a record release party and just go
wild in the place.
Besides offering a virtually bust-proof space, Harvey
and Dolton can accommodate crowds of thousands.  Not
only do promoters enjoy profit from packing more
people into a party in one night, these large venues
and the crowds they attract can offer some security. 
Now, when you want to go into a small venue that can
hold only 400 people, its easier to shut you down,
explains de la Mota.  They can put more stereotypes
on you.  But when youre throwing a party that has
8000 people; theres power in numbers--its easier.
Because if they shut us down, they gotta shut every
big promoter down in Chicago.  House or loft parties
are often sniffed out by police and shut down rather
quickly, thanks in part to noise-level codes in
residential areas and suspicious neighbors.  Even
smaller events in non-residential areas are harder to
pull off, due mostly to wary property owners and the
sheer expense and effort involved.
Put simply, holding small parties really isnt that
practical.  After all, the mess of red tape seems less
and less appealing if the profit margin is nothing
short of scanty.  Furthermore, most DJs are now
reluctant to play at unlicensed parties for fear of
being slapped with heavy fines.  This has been a huge
blow to Chicagos rave scene, with talented DJs moving
out in search of less hostile destinations.  Most
notably, Halo Varga jumped ship and moved to
California after being fined for playing an unlicensed
party.  He is now a popular DJ on the West Coasts
thriving rave scene, and a highly successful produce
under his own name and with Hipp-E under H-Foundation
moniker.  Promoters of larger parties generally have a
larger budget to work with, allowing them to obtain
secure venues and out-of-state and international
talent.  These impressive line ups draw scored of
people to one party, making healthy amount of money. 
However, despite all the complaintstired venues, high
prices, troublesome securitythese large scale raves
(or DJ concerts, depending on who you ask) still
have their advantages.  The bigger parties are
helping the music scenethats their best quality. 
Theyre exposing DJs to a mass market, says Druid.
In the future, aggressive promotion of these large
raves will most likely take on a decidedly
business-like angle.  Its going to be more
professional, predicts Liquid G-zus, DJ for the
Treehouse Collective.  You have to go through all
these permits, get all this permissionyoull have
this company doing your insurance, this company doing
your security.  Instead of just the rave community
doing the parties themselves, youll have other
business people doing the parties with the rave
community.
Small parties, appealing because of the level of
intimacy and lower cost, are slowly disappearing as
promoters encounter difficulties with the police and
city officials.  Even with all the proper licenses and
permits, they often must terminate by 2am.  And at
2am, the partys just getting started.  So, that
leaves Dolton or Harvey, a sad, vicious cycle for the
dance-all-nightr.
As is the nature of electronic music, the constant
progression ad innovation keeps the genre dynamic,
something which many of the smaller rave promoters no
longer find in the rave scene.  I think thats one of
the reasonsI can speak for myselfwhy some promotes
stopped throwing raves, says Druid.  Theres no
excitement in going to the Dolton ad throwing a party
with the same standard DJs that they always seem to
have, and theres no excitement left for those that
have been throwing parties for a while.
Druid now DJs at clubs and produces tunes on his
label, Fusion Sound Lab Records.  Frankie Vega, of the
now-defunct group Mushgroove, currently works A&R at a
record label.  Dust Traxx used to provide support for
other promotions groups, but distanced themselves in
order to concentrate on their musical output.  Future
Forces has also given up the party scene in response
to increasing demand for founder DJ 3Ds skills behind
the decks, and key figures Njoy have moved on a well.
Despite increasing difficulties, some smaller groups
have managed to stay afloat.  Voodoo Child and Shade
Free still do occasional parties, and Flashback/Smooth
Movement pulls off an event every once in a while. 
Fear None and Global Adrenaline now do larger raves. 
The Treehouse Collective continues to set up small,
inexpensive parties, using diverse locations such as
forest preserves and parks to keep interest alive. 
As things get bigger, things will go back
underground, says Tommie Sunshine, DJ and producer at
Dust Traxx, and a man who has watched Chicagos rave
scene fluctuate since its birth nearly a decade ago. 
There has always been and always will be an
underground.
Of course, loft parties still go off, but mostly
through strict invite-only door policies and very
little promotion.  And every once in a while, a small
group will break into a warehouse, set up a generator,
and let loose before scrambling away from the scene of
the crime at daybreak.  These events are rare, but
they keep some of that traditional renegade spirit
from disappearing.
To some, it may appear rather masochistic to persist
in the face of such difficulty.  Thankfully, a deep
love of the music keeps most people from writing off
raves as a passing fad, like the lambada or swing
dancings mid-90s reincarnation.  People wonder,
its such a big hassle, why do you keep on doing it?
 But its all about the music, to keep it going, says
de la Mota.  The only thing thats slowing it down is
the politics.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hello 2Day....Alter Ego....Bad Ass Man

*yawn*

Aaron has to get back to Sonoma State where his machine is at to upload the
pix.

I had a great time last night. Saw a lot of people and a hell of lot more
people than I expected for a little underground. I keep hearing about people
that were there that I never saw. It was dark as hell out there, but made
for some great shooting star viewing! Did anyone else see that shooting star
that lasted for a good 5 seconds??? The HUGE bulldozer was a great backdrop
to the party. I've gotta get going here so I'll write more later... good
times - good times!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hello 2Day....Alter Ego....Bad Ass Man

The pics that I was talken to you about are at
http://technolounge.org/aaron/ the first link on there (6.23.01) contains
some pics of your beautiful kids. =)

The site is technolounge.org just in case anyone was curious. And yes, I'll
be posting pics from AEC as soon as I get back up to Rohnert Park. Mucho big
thanks to everyone that found me AA batteries. I couldn't believe how
willing everyone was to donate their flashlight batteries to me. And I
couldn't believe I forgot to stop off and get batteries before I assulted
AEC.

Anyway, last night was rawken glad that we had such a good turnout, and it
really seemed like there was a special magic in the air last night. The
tractor, the stickman, Ryan in fuzzy pants. It'll definately take a long
time to get this memory out of my head

Much lub,

-Aaron

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hello 2Day....Alter Ego....Bad Ass Man -- Review

Okay I really need to run back up to school, but I really wanted to post a
quick review. My night started out around 6pm when I woke up from the
previous night of good music at Ascension (the residents and Breeder really
tore it up last nite) then the after party over my house where much
craziness ensued. So I got some food, collected my thoughts and headed out
to Berkely to Becca's to begin what was about to be an amazing night. As I
walk up I see Jason (DK) in candy. It was scary, but really interesting to
see. I think the only way to describe Jason is "Bad-assed" So inside I see
Osric (gothby?) and the rest of the crew, it felt like halloween almost,
it's great to see everyones alter ego come out. After that it's time to
assume our stations and make sure people get to this party. I hung around
Becca and Alida entertaining them, and making fun of some intoxicated ravers
accross the street. Then I go to work my map point with Natalie. I played
snake while she made candy and passed out the last clue for the party to the
people that walked up. It was somewhat boring but I was *VERY* touched at
all the great people that came up to me. I got offered everything from
Balance bars to beer. Thank you soo much to all those people that felt some
desire to repay me. Ravers Rawk! Everyone was very friendly and I was now
very excited to get to the party as it looked like we would have a great
group of people. Got to the space and it was grrrrreat! The atmosphere was
great, the sky was beautiful, and the people were dancing. Order had been
restored to the world. Jason spun a very good set, albiet it wasn't his
usual style, I really enjoyed it. And AndyW was equally great bringing out
booty house with andy flavor. Unfortunately I missed Mike, and Ira spin, but
I was a tired kid, and couldn't be as hardcore as I was during summer time.
Thanks to everyone who came out, and for the rest of AEC for an awesome
night.

Plur! 0=)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Aaliyah is dead?

I kept hearing this rumor today that Aaliyah had died in a plane crash.
I found this link: 
http://dailynews.netscape.com/mynsnews/story.tmpl?table=n&cat=51180&id=200108260029000137142&dpt=main

I was watching MTV, but they haven't said anything. Does anyone know if its 
really true or just a rumor?

-Veronica-

Subject: [sfraves] Re: NRR: Aaliyah is dead!

it is true...but very, very SAD! :(

http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/26/bahamas.crash.ap/index.html

Aaliyah killed in plane crash

MARSH HARBOUR, Bahamas (AP) -- R&B singer and actress Aaliyah died Saturday 
when a small plane that was to carry her and eight others back to the United 
States crashed after takeoff in the Bahamas, authorities said.

Eight were killed, and one critically injured man was flown to Florida for 
treatment, officials said.

"We find it devastating and most unfortunate that after having this 
world-famous star Aaliyah and her crew select the Bahamas as their choice 
location for her latest video, the project has climaxed on such a tragic 
note," said Minister of Tourism Tommy Turnquest, who happened to be visiting 
Abaco Island, where the plane went down.

Aaliyah's song "Try Again" earned her a Grammy nomination for best female 
R&B vocalist. She made her feature acting debut in the film "Romeo Must 
Die."

Bahamian national television quoted the civil aviation department as saying 
Aaliyah was among nine Americans on board.

The private plane was leaving the Marsh Harbour airport on a trip to 
Opa-locka, Florida, when it went down Saturday evening, said police 
spokesman Marvin Dames.

Abaco Island Chief Councilor Silbert Mills said those killed included two 
women and six men.

Islander Derek Russell, who worked for the group during the video shoot, 
said he got the artist's autograph before the accident.

"She's a nice girl, a friendly girl," he said.

The cause of the crash was unclear. Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta, said the plane was a Cessna 
402 owned by Skystream, a company based in Pembroke Pines, Florida. She said 
the plane crashed at the end of the airport's runway at 6:50 p.m. EDT (2250 
GMT).

  I work at the Contra Costa Times, and I overheard editorial people talking about it.

  Aaliyah is dead. That saddens me, cause she was WAY young.

Subject: [sfraves] Alter Ego:  Amazing ! :)


What a way to finish off the summer.  Ryan-- the party was truely magical. 
You are right, it did remind me of Caladen ( esp the mini dirt hill and the 
amazing view ).  Having the feel of a desert party 30 minutes from home.  
Amazing. I am still glowing. You show me why I stay part of this scene-- the 
good hearts, beautiful people, and the incredible vibe.  I was surrounded by 
family all night.

I get there around 1:30 after not having the easiest time finding the 2nd 
mappont...  My friends decide to leave early, but I didn't let it ruin my 
night.. so thanks Chris (alter ego-- teletubby robbin sucker giving candy 
boi:p..) for giving me a ride back/ and giving me a heart attack as well.. 
:) Unfortunately I come while Shane/ Amber are finishing up their set.. I 
think relic was the last time I saw you Shane.. it was good seeing u again! 
this time no crazy black dude with flying dentures turning down the music to 
worry about )..your alter ego tore that shit up hehehe :)  Got to chill with 
so many friends!  Jamie-- happy birthday girly!  glad to have been there 
with ya on your big day!.  wish i could make it on sunday.. but i will be 
thinking about ya! Ryan, Lydia, Becca, Osby, Miki, Jason, Michael (get down 
and shake that red stick!! :)..), andy. amber,shane, chris and the rest of 
the planners/ djs .. awesome jobs!  Good to see all the #sf-raves kids get 
out from behind their computers and shake it.. eddie, lex, brian, joe glad 
to have chilled with you.. can't wait till sunday.. Tracy- it was good 
seeing you again, we have to party when john gets back to the bay :) It was 
nice meeting you Brian!  Gotta check out the lousiana undergrounds sometime 
:)  erica, shannon, max, alej!  glad you guys still were able to show up! 
met so many people ( including a few listees I haven't met before.. it was a 
pleasure! )and caught up with so many friends.

I just have to say that Osby deserves an honorary Academy Award for his 
depection of his alter ego, Gothby.. I mean damn I couldn't stop shaking my 
booty during Andy W's booty house set..  and he is just trying his hardest 
to not dance and be depressed... i am so glad that you decided to go back to 
osby though, gothby isnt very nice :p

And the T- Rex looking tractor/ crane thing.. was awesome!!  Hope to see 
some of you at Delectation tomorrow in Golden Gate Park !  Shakin my booty 
to some sick jungle :)

-- Erica

da Kiki Girl :)

ps  rizzy and cliff! where were you??!!!  I was so dissappointed to miss you 
guys again!  hopefully I will see you tomorrow :)

Subject: [sfraves] Review: AEC, come as you aren't.  A+

Great renegades are just too rare anymore.  Shane and I arrived very
nervous about the gate situation, replying on the smarts of each guest
to enter when it was okay and keep those lights off (without driving off
the road.)  

A little late, but worth the wait, the equipment all got going.  (Sweet
memories of trolling the excavation site for something to put the
turntables on.)  Thanks to everyone who lent their equipemnt, renegades
can really get a lot of dust and crud in there, but we thank you for it.

*So* many people showed up!  How did this happen?  Nobody knew who the
DJ lineup really was (great fake names), and no-one knew that AEC was an
alternate name for your very own SFR-Planners.  I guess if you have the
right people spread word-of-mouth it will all happen!

Best memories:
- Getting "creative" to set up the turntables and sound
- Seeing the major crowd turnout!
- The stars (especially those shooting ones...)
- The Red Stickman returneth (and somehow not puketh)
- Seeing friends I didn't expect to be there--Jim, Josh, Tracy, Brian B.
- Meeting new friends - Brian (from Lousianna), Jamie, Mike ("Some
friends just brought me.  Everyone is so nice!"), *another* Brian, Adam
128, and so on!
- The industrial excavation equipment, gotta give credit there.

Support your local kick-ass tiny party,

Subject: [sfraves] nrr:  what is the pitch adjust thingie on one of those turntable things for?

Hey everyone,
             OK, this might seem an odd question, but here goes.  It's well
known that the Technics 1200 was originally a higher end consumer deck
before it got adopted by DJ's as the standard for spinnin records.  However,
it had the pitch adjust, as did many other home turntables of the period,
before DJ's picked it up!  The question I have is:  if people weren't
originally using a pitch adjust for beatmatching, then why was it there??
Anyone have any theories?

Just curious . . .

A very big thank you to all those that came out last night. We did =

with 30 seconds to say all of that info was a challenge! How long did =
that take you get the VM worked out Alida?? The point of last night was =
to do something fun, but in a more playful manner while keeping things =
simple. We promised ourselves we would throw an outdoor this summer and =
decided a week ago that now was the time. The success of this party =
depended heavily on the responsible nature of the people that came. We =
didn't have a single problem with people not following the rules about =
getting to the party which was a huge sigh of relief. Everyone that came =
really did a great job of keeping the space clean. Cleanup in the =
morning took 5 mintutes! A huge family turnout was great to see and even =
better since everyone was dressed as their alter ego. Gothby wins for =
the best alter ego of the night. If you didn't know him normally you =
would think he was bored with life and wanting to die last night. Great =
to see the stickman emerge once more. Been waaay too long. We were glad =
to see such a large turnout, albeit rather surprised given there were =
only 2 days of promotion for this party. The space worked out great even =
though it was rather sketchy at first. It was great to party there again =
since it had been nearly 2 years since Divination was held there. If =
anyone has pictures from the party please let us know! We'd love to see =
them. The next AEC party is unknown, but be assured that we'll do this =

Thank you to all of our crew, DJ's and extended family that made the =
night possible! From sound, generator, mixer, decks, to all the people =

Subject: [sfraves] Re: NRR aaliyah

Beautiful.

Damn well spoken D.

Take a moment to bow your head and realize that life in itself is a gift.
And what we do with it determines the path of a million or so other such
paths we may interact with on our travels.  We take alot for granted in
California.  We have our parties here where it seems the worst we recieve is
some ill made attempt to shut down an event by the local police should they
happen upon it.

While in other parts of the country people are being tear gassed, pepper
sprayed, jailed, and beaten in order to preserve their right to do something
as simple as dance.


I know life is hectic, and the days never seem short enough and the nights
never long enough..  But everyonce in awhile, turn your head to the east,
and give a moment of silence to all those people who have, are, and WILL be
fighting for that simple right.  And pray as well kids..

Because someday it may be like that hear...

I bow my head to the loss of talent and all the gifts they had yet shared
with the world.  And can only pray that they have inspired a new generation
of children to not take it all for granted.  Take heart all, look to the
stars..


And Climb.

Subject: [sfraves] ***SoundCheck*** Wonderful!!

It may seem surprising to some people, but in betweeb all the SFR email, I
actually go to a rave once in a while.

Well, I had a *great* time at this party. Music Rocked (Forest Green!!
ohmygod!), enough space to dance, good vibe. Seriously, no complaints.
Visuals were totally cool. I was staring at them dumbfoundedly frequently
through the night. Magnificent. It was so nice to go to a party like that.

The only thing I really missed seeing was Kandy Kids!! The crowd at the
party was definitely a "newer" crowd. People were definitely having fun,
but you could tell that that quite a number of them weren't used to having
kids roll on their lap. It was weird (btw, it was my b-day), but I felt
that I've hit my second stage of raving. The first group of ravers I
knew/recognized isn't as present at partied I go to any longer, and I see
lots of new faces. I suppose it's now my time to try and start teaching the
younger ravers. I hope other experienced ravers take on a similar task. If
you feel like parties aren't "old school" enough anymore, then do what you
can to make it like old times.

I also came to realize how important unconditional love is. Whether it's
for your friends or for new people, especially ravers, it's such a
fundamental part of what makes a great rave so great. I'm doing my best to
everyone's time a good one.

Props to Outerworld for throwing a freaking awesome party. Thanks.

-Damien

Uhm, I just woke up.  Yeah, I slept all of saturday.. damn.  Osby, you're 
one of many people I'm sorry I didn't see friday night.. I was there.. but 
it was too dark for me.. I hella couldn't see driving up the driveway, 
'cause I could turn my lights off, but the HUD (heads up display) on my 
dashboard created too much ambient light, so my homie steered.. hehe

So what did you guys think of the venue? The talent? The sound? The 
decorations? The music?

Subject: [sfraves] Question # 8: Should we cooperate/rebel with authorities over drugs?

--part1_d.19c88d8b.28ba8dde_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

 Should the rave scene cooperate with authorities over their anti drug 
policies? Do you think this will in the long run save our right to dance? 
Should we allow the DEA to impliment censorship (forbiding pacifiers, glow 
sticks, etc,) over our parties? And should we allow police authorities to 
dangle the infamous crack house law and other anti rave laws over us as being 
the price we will have to pay to have a scene?
 Or, do you think the rave scene should be part of a large movement of people 
and organizations that believe drugs should be legalized, especially quasi 
harmless drugs like E, psyedelics and pot, and are fighting for the right of 
adults to be able to injest what ever they want as long as they dont hurt 
anyone else, and not always cooperate with officials believing even in the 
short run we will have our parties shut down and have anti rave and crack 
house laws thrown at us to stop us from dancing?
 Which do you believe, and why?

 Peace, love and hugs! Bodhi ^ _ ^

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hello 2Day....Alter Ego....Bad Ass Man

	Wow! This party was awesome! Thanks so much to AEC for doing this. Your
really all had your shit together which made it possible to have such an
amazing night! The 'come as you arn't' was a great idea... I probably
had a little to much fun! ahhh! :P But hey... it is not everyday I get
to wear pink pants and pigtails! I tried wearing my candy but I
gradually started to take it off as it got a little too irritating. I
have to say Osrick did a great job at being goth all night. Takes some
pretty good acting skills to keep a straight face that long! Especially
if your name is Osby! Although every now and then he would run away from
the people and let out a little giggle, but I was impressed by how long
Gothby(Osrick) was kept up. And don't worry Osby. I know your not an
asshole! 
	The venue was soo incredible. It was a beautiful stary night and I even
saw a shooting star! Jeez!!!There is just way too much to say about this
party! But I'll leave it at everything was just right!  What a perfect
way to end my summer!
-Nicola-

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question # 8: Should we cooperate/rebel with authorities over drugs?

First off, E isn't harmless.

Second off, I have mixed feelings about this question.
 In one aspect, I would say yes, fight back, tell the
people who are trying to hold our scene down that we
can't be moved.  Drugs are a part of our scene,
whether you want to admit it or not.  However, for the
authorities to automatically assume that someone with
glowsticks and water is rolling is absurd.

Damn, I can't believe I'm defending glowsticks...I
hate those things.

Anyways, point being, I don't think that it's fair for
the authorities to make laws against throwing parties
just for the sake of a drug crackdown.  They should do
their job and find drug dealers in other places than
in parties.  Security at parties are the ones that
should worry about the kids coming in and what they
have on them.

I'd rather have a place completely drug free that I
can dance at and enjoy the music than a place filled
with people on drugs.  I personally always go out
sober.  I don't see the point of being in an e-pile
somewhere when I can instead be dancing my ass of to a
really great track. 

However, I think that the lawmakers are going to
create laws against raves whether we cooperate or not.
 I'm sure almost all of them could care less about
what we do, but the parents of America are scared that
us "ravers" will corrupt their children.  Parent's are
the ones that vote, and parents are the ones that
lawmakers wish to appease.

It really blows.  I just try to have a good as time as
I possibly can, and try to fight my battles as they
come at me.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ***SoundCheck*** Wonderful!!

I don't think I would ever expect to see candy kids at an Otherworld
(formerly Overworld) party. The crowd is older, been around a bit longer and
generally not active in the mainstream party scene. I wanted to go and see
the new space, but I needed a night of chilling with my gf. Almost stopped
by on the way home, but motivation was nil after the AEC festivities the
night before. Is the place as cool as Overworld (where Relic was held)?? I
hear it's huge so I'll just have to come out to the next party there. hasta
like pasta

Nah, at an underground like this, the darkness is used as an incentive:  if
you actually want to see who you're partying with, you have to actually
stay until the sun comes up.  Which you should do anyway, since it's the
best time of the party. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Alliyah died and MTV

      What the hell are you   saying d'john? Anyways, you can't count on MTV 
to tell you if a person has died, even though its some music television 
station. MTV isn't the answer to every damn thing in music history. Ya, its 
sad to that she died plus a shock. RIP. Good Luck to her family.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question # 8: Should we cooperate/rebel with authorities over drugs?

we only touch on a tiny, tiny, tiny few of the many
pharmaceuticals that are available to us for temporary
relief 
of illness, cure from illness, mimimizing damage from
illness or the process of aging. the reason why some
of the 
popularly discussed drugs on this list have been made
illegal is because of the horrible side-effects that
people 
have suffered from them and continue to suffer from
them...there are many other drugs that have been taken
off 
of the market..like phen-phen..i think that is how you
spell it..a popular diet pill, and throughout the
years, 
popular barbituates and anti-depressents are either
discontinued or improved upon...i really don't think
that 
there is a big conspiracy going on. i think people are
just trying to protect people's lives and the lives
and safety 
of children and teens. if people do not feel good, and
they want relief, they should turn to the medical
field, 
and not to the rave scene. i, for one, have never ever
appreciated watching people overdose in my presence,
and 
deliberately so, because they know that i am a caring
concerned person, and that if something goes wrong, i
will 
get them to a hospital...screw that...  what a waste
of my good time and energies, and what a horror for
the people around them to see. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Tina's alter-ego experience

ok, i know i'm a little late posting this, but well it was a long couple of days... 

friday night i totally rushed to get out of work early, but i missed the meeting at becca's house.. so i call ryan and i am informed that i no longer need to work the second map point shift.. so i head out on my way, to find a short detour since 80 was closed, and i finally make it out to the space.... had to pass the gate once cuz of an oncomming car... unfortunately, i have day running lights on my car, so i couldn't turn off my headlights all the way.... and jason was all super candy, and miki too.. it was great...

so the music hadn't quite started yet, but i found amber right away, and ryan was on the phone, and it was dark and i could berely see anything, and then i hear christle's voice... so we went back to my car where i changed into my alter ego.. i had wanted to take it a little more to the extreme, but i realized i gave away all my big pants and other raver-esque clothes.. but i brought it on full force with the candy.. i don't think i ever wore as much of it in one night.... i even revived my butterfly barrettes that i was never seen without back in the day... 

and it was so fucking nice out, such a great view, perfect for stargazing and trying to find all the constellations.. ben, what was the name of the meteor shower that was happening again? (this was the reason for all the shooting stars) 

anyways, it was soo cool to see all the dj's playing music that was so not typical of them, i loved it.. i think it shows some true level of skill when a dj can pick up records that don't really know in a genre they never play, and totally have fun with it! amber, shane, jason, andy.. you all did i great job (i missed ira and michael's sets.. =( i had to go home cuz of work in the morning)...

and it was great to see so many people come out, and a lot of them in their alter-ego nonetheless... i will never forget some of the outfits i saw.. especially ryan wearing lydia's fuzzy pants! but osby definately had the most alter-ego thing going on....

i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to meet more new people, but the ones i did meet totally rock! Natalie and i bonded working the gate in the morning and it was really cool to play guess the constelation and steall wheat thins from christle, i finally re-met atom128, hopefully you'll remember me next time =) and i met the nomadic dj... you are so cool.. i wish i could have traveled even half as much as you have... i'm not sure if the other people i met are on the list, but i know these three are! but if you saw a semi-candied out girl offering everyone herbal crack (mah whong) earlier in the night, that was me =) 

anyways, once again aec/sfr pulled off a great party, mad props to ryan for discovering the space, and to everyone else, i'm so proud that we pulled it together in such a short time, and now that summer is ending, it's about time to start planning an indoor! 

love and hugs and kisses,
tina

Ok, so I'm not Ben.. but it's the Perseus Meteor Shower... because the

due to a comet

Subject: [sfraves] AEC reviewed!

It almost seems pointless to be doing a review at this point, when
everything has already been said, but I still wanted to get my say in:)
This is the first party I've helped out with that I have actually been
on crew, and wow am I proud.  I was so excited when I arrived at Becca's
and see Jason and Miki all candied out and then Alida in full HJBC
garb.  And then of course Gothby or Osrich who made it clear to everyone
that life is miserable (Goodbye Tomorrow!). Just too funny.  I worked
the first shift of the second map point in my little ford escort, so
some of you may have seen me.  At one point we were really nervous
because a suspicious cop decided to park his truck right behind us and
watch for about 20 minutes until the Gilman St. punks provided for a
distraction.  I'm sure we looked like drug dealers just chilling on a
dark corner and having random cars come up to us, but ah well.. nothing
happened!

I got to the party at about 1:30 just as sound was starting, and I loved
how the tables were set up on a truck with the bulldozer as a backdrop.
The space was absolutely beautiful (although very dark) and reminded me
of a combination between the desert and the moon.  Music the entire
night was great, and everyone even enjoyed Jason's NRG which was
untypical of this kind of party.  Michael the red stickman- thank you
for dressing up for us all- it really added so much spirit to the entire
party.  At one point I retreated to my car because I was tired and
grumpy, but came out later thanks to Ryan for cheering me up.  Seeing
Ryan in my old fuzzy pants was damn funny!  Watching the sunrise over
the hills had to be the highlight, and then packing up to leave at 7 AM
with little mess and happy people.  Terry decided to come visit us early
in the morning too.

So thanks to everyone for coming out- the party provided a great closure
to summer, but we'll have to do it again soon!  I love the whole alter
ego concept and the fact that so many people got into it (Tina you were
so cute). Happy B-day's to Becca, Jaime, and Ryan on Weds. =)

Lydia

Carnivore to add wireless to its menu?

by Erich Luening and Ben Charny, ZDNet News


A telecommunications group warns that the FBI may start using its DCS1000 
surveillance system, originally known as Carnivore, to eavesdrop on 
wireless e-mail and cell-phone text messages.

Federal law enforcement officials may use a controversial surveillance 
technology to monitor e-mail and other text messages delivered through 
wireless devices, such as cell phones--a fact that has one 
telecommunications group concerned.

In a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell, 
the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA) warned that 
the FBI may start using its DCS1000 surveillance system, originally known 
as Carnivore, to eavesdrop on wireless communications as early as October.

The CTIA fears the FBI might start using the DCS1000 system because the 
wireless industry has so far been unable to develop a standard for law 
enforcement agencies to monitor e-mails sent between handheld devices.

The FCC has set a Sept. 30 deadline for the wireless industry to submit 
guideline proposals for use of the DCS1000 system.

Although agency officials would not comment on the CTIA's letter, a 
representative said the FCC intends to decide soon whether to extend the 
deadline.

In the Aug. 15 letter, the association's vice president and general counsel 
Michael Altschul wrote: "If the industry is not provided the guidance and 
time to develop solutions for packet surveillance that intercept only the 
target's communications, it seems probable that Carnivore, which intercepts 
all communications in the pathway without the affirmative intervention of 
the carrier, will be widely implemented."

Privacy advocates, civil libertarians and some lawmakers have criticized 
Carnivore because they fear the system may be used to snoop on innocent 
citizens without their knowledge.

The FBI has been using the controversial technology for two years. The 
Carnivore system, which is installed at Internet service providers, 
captures "packets" of Internet traffic as they travel through ISP networks. 
The program monitors millions of mail messages, searching for notes sent by 
people under investigation.

An FBI representative would not say whether Carnivore has been, or will 
ever be, used to monitor wireless communications.

Keith Waryas, a wireless analyst with market watcher IDC, said that even if 
federal officials do snoop on wireless e-mails, they're going to be 
disappointed with what they find.

Although businesses are starting to use wireless networks to send sensitive 
e-mails, it's still a small audience. Wireless consumers such as cell phone 
users are even less apt right now to use such modern services as sending 
wireless e-mails, he said.

Though there has been some movement by criminal enterprises to use the 
Internet, that same push hasn't happened yet on wireless, Waryas believes.

"I don't think the world will come to a standstill," he said. "I don't 
think guys running a drug operation on the corner will have a WAP interface 
(a type of wireless network) for their distributors."

He also pointed out that hackers already have broken into some wireless 
networks. This week marked the release of a product called AirSnort, which 
lets hackers intercept some wireless data transmissions.

"When it comes to wireless, you're talking about broadcasting something. My 
guess is it doesn't take a rocket scientist to intercept those 
transmissions," Waryas said.

There is a bill before Congress that would require the attorney general and 
the FBI director to submit a detailed report on the use of surveillance 
systems, including Carnivore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tina's alter-ego experience

Just a little note that I didn't discover the space. It was the location of
my first outdoor party back in September of 99. The party was called
Divination and had Telene and others there. I think Anthony (Alias) was a
part of it, but since I was so new to things at the time I'm not sure. The
space was actually a backup space since the first one got busted at Golden
Gate Fields. Fred aka Smyl-E directed everyone out to this location. It was
a great night with a small crowd and things looked a hell of a lot different
back then. All that construction that you guys saw out there has only
occured in the last month. I always wanted to have another party out there
since I've never heard about a party happening at that location since. It
worked out this time only because everyone that came followed the rules. If
anyone were to try and host a party there without the level of paranoia that
we had it would surely get shutdown and another space lost.

Fuzzy pants and me are a rare moment. To my knowledge there are no pictures
of me in full candy and fuzzy pants so... HA! I guess that means it never
happened. Those pants actually kicked major ass and it's scary how well they
fit me. Thanks to my Lyds for letting me borrow them. Fun times Fun Times.
So what was going on in the bulldozer cab later that night?? Looked like
foggy windows to me... Kept hearing some reverse sounds goin off too. Crazy
shit yo! Glad to see so many people come out in true AEC form. I missed so
many people out there from what I heard. I had to deal with keeping shifts
going and answering a constant barrage of phone calls. Let's see: Brian
Bellendorf (sp) was there and I still haven't met him. Anthony (Alias) and
Bruce (Uphonic) were rumored to be there as well and I wish I had seen
Anthony so I could verify that he played the original party there. Sarillion
I thought I saw you, but it was dark and I couldn't tell. Migurski you ran
away to the top of the bulldozer with your girl and then POOF you were gone.
Who else did I miss there?? I was running around in an orange vest and black
fuzzy pants with red stars. Not my normal garb by far, but fun none the
less. Tina, Christle, Patrice, Alida, all in *raver* garb was great. Totally
caught me off gaurd to see them dressed like that! Lydia was my sanity for
the night. Had a nice time out in the car with the sound turned down a bit.
Needed some chill/close time and you seemed to as well. Well I think that
beyond what I've already said and what has been said it's all been said.
Horrible sentence, sorry. Looking forward to next time!

great job (i missed ira and michael's sets.. =( i had to go home cuz of work
in the morning)...

their alter-ego nonetheless... i will never forget some of the outfits i
saw.. especially ryan wearing lydia's fuzzy pants! but osby definately had
the most alter-ego thing going on....

traveled even half as much as you have... i'm not sure if the other people i

semi-candied out girl offering everyone herbal crack (mah whong) earlier in
the night, that was me =)

Subject: [sfraves] -Recovery- AEC/Otherworld

My god what a weekend. Friday night I head over to Becca's with Veronica for 
an AEC pre-party meeting. Wow, what a flashback. I defintely felt like I was 
seven again meeting up with friends to go trick-or-treating, especially with 
all the buzzing anticipation. My god, Jason as a candy kid... the 
resemblence to the fish boi in Groove was stricking. And Osby, damn it, I 
was not a go-go dancer, I was H.orny J.ail B.ait C.rew!
     Ten o'clock rolls around and I move upstairs to do the voicemail. So 
I'm taking my sweet time giving out directions (I hate when they are given 
out too fast) when I get cut off less than half way through. Damn. Try 
again. Damn. Time for a rewrite. Try again. Damn. Try again. DAMN! Finally 
got it after I don't know how many times. I'm *so* sorry for those of you 
who had to call so many times. I feel your pain!
     So Becca and I head out to the mappoint and wait. That was interesting 
to say the least. Me with my huge white platforms, knee-high socks, short 
skirt and hair in pigtails was apparently an invitation for harassment. "Eh, 
yo... straight up, me and my bois are just looking for some pussy... you 
think you could help a brother out? We have money." Riiiight....
     So as we're standing there Becca, Aaron, Natalie and I notice some 
lovely young fellows with very orignal raver gear on: big pants, candy, 
binkies, visors... I didn't spot them a mile away or anything! And it didn't 
help that they were gathered around their car blasting sandstorm... eesh... 
so I walk over to talk to these bois to figure out what their bucket is. 
"Are you guys ravers?" "Yeah!!" "So just curious, why do you rave?" Cuz.... 
just cuz!" "Cuz why?" "Cuz... I dunno! It's fun!... Do you know where we can 
get any E?" Oh dear god... "How often do you do E?" I asked. He laughed and 
looked away. "Don't ask me that!!" "Why not?"  "Because I do it soooo much! 
I don't even know how often I do it!" He then asked me again if I knew where 
he could get some E. I talked with them for a bit longer, pleading with him 
and his friends to try to go to a party sober and just dance. "Isn't the 
music enough?" I asked. "I can't just go.. and just... dance!" He gave me a 
baffled look as though I was suggesting he cut his mother's heart out with a 
pencil. I had had enough and was about to retreat when he pulled out his 
mangled lighter. "Like my lighter?" "What did you do to it?" I asked. "Well 
I was rolling really hard the other night-" I cut him off. "And you chewed 
it...?" I was afraid of what the answer would be. "Yeah!!" he said 
enthusiastically. I walked away. Damn... I forget how bad it is sometimes.
     So anyways, work the mappoint with my littler blue ear muffs until 
12:30 then run errands with Becca (chaos!! But we did come up with the HJBC 
slogan: "Sometimes I'm goodie goodie, right now I'm naughty naughty. Good 
call Becca!). Finally get out to the site to find it just getting underway. 
I hardly recognized Amber when she came up to say hallo. And Patrice as a 
thug.. damn.. that took me way to long to gain any sort of recognition. But 
I must agree, Osby took the cake because he stayed in character the whole 
night. There were so many listers there I would have loved to meet! I guess 
I should have been a little more sociable.
     Music was fucking great. The whole party was such a mixed up 
experiment, espcially having DJs spin what they don't normally spin, but it 
all fell into place beautifully. Andy's set was bootaylicious. What was that 
track called with a woman saying something like, "Work me good," or 
something to that effect? And then the music cuts and she says something 
like, "Damn, where's the music? It's like waiting for a man to get it up!" 
That definitely got my ass shaking. Oh, highlight of the night- Andy 
volunteering out of nowhere to spin at my 18th birthday. Damn. That party is 
gonna be epic.
     Thank you to *everyone* who gave us donations. As I walked around 
asking for them with my basket I was greeted by many more than willing to 
help people. Again, thank you. You're the reason we do this and we want to 
*keep* doing this. Any contribution helps, even nickles and dimes! Who was 
that who gave me those saying it was their laundry money? That was cute. : )
     I have pictures yet to be devoloped and I have no idea when I'll post 
them considering I have a 6100 Mac (yes, it should be in a museum) that 
can't do anything... but I'll try to get them up when I get a chance. There 
should be an awesome one of the return of the stickman dancing on the 
tractor if it came out right.
     To sum up, I had an awesome night. Shane, Amber... thanks for stopping 
to shake my hand and telling me how proud you were. *sniffle* I'm sorry.. I 
promised I wouldn't cry! I'm getting feklmept (sp?)... I'll give you a 
topic... Rohde Island- neither a road, nor an island. Discuss!.... There, 
I'm betta now. But really, it was truly touching.
     I had to leave at 5 because I had a show to catch early the next day 
(btw... Aida is a terrible musiclal. All glitz and glam, no substance. This 
is the first play I've seen that I've not enjoyed), so I sadly missed out on 
Terry's fashionably late appearance and Michael passing out the roof of his 
car, but I am happy to say I went home beaming. I have to take a moment to 
say to my SFR planners/AEC kids that I cherish all of you and what we've 
shared and created together. It's truly magical. : )

Oh, did anyone find my handcuffs and HJBC sign during clean up? I forgot to 
grab them.

Soooo slept, went to Aida (gag) and call up Shane about Otherworld. After a 
bit of convincing from him I decide to motivate myself to go. I am *so* 
happy I did. That was probably one of the best parties I've been to in quite 
some time. Music was *excellent* ( I heard my new favorite track for the 
first time since FnF, I wish I knew the name!), people were joyous and warm 
(saw Martin again, hallo!), room to dance, awesome space, mesmorizing 
visuals.... damn. Plus I got to be The Red Stick Girl for a bit. Thanks 
Michael! Oh, and Mr. Andy W... you missed out on my ruffled socks. ; )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question # 8: Should we cooperate/rebel with authorities over drugs?


Bodhi, most of your questions have been good thought provoking exercises,
but this one strikes me as a bit naive.

Should we cooperate with or rebel against authorities over drugs? Who are
"we"? Some among us take drugs. They are already rebelling against authority
though that almost certainly isn't the reason they choose to ingest the
substances they do. Some among us neither take nor distribute nor condone
drug use. They are already cooperating with the authorities though that most
likely has little to do with why they choose to abstain. The truth is that
drug use has nothing to do directly with the rave scene. Long after the last
rave has been thrown, people will gather to dance and some among them will
take drugs.

You ask if we should "allow" the DEA to do this or "allow" the police to do
that, but the fact is that they are already either allowed or disallowed to
take action  based on the laws that exist. The ACLU is challenging their
actions as being illegal in some cases already.

I think the question you have asked hides the real issue. The authorities
are using drugs as an excuse to crack down on people gathering peacefully to
dance. And yes... that is something we should rebel against.

So Geri, how many people have deliberately OD'd in your presence? If you can
honestly say that someone actually has, then perhaps you should consider
whether his problem might go a lot deeper than drug use.

Me: IMHO, I swear, old fart ravers were dominating in style , and the 
median age was 21+ (approx.). And yes, we're not used to having kids 
roll on our laps. Unless it's HBJC girls, but that's another story.

it's a leap above the previous and has epic potential, for sure.

Subject: [sfraves] sfraver made music?(READ)

Hello,

Down here in SoCal this weekend the SCRubbers threw their own party as well, 
but with a twist: members of SCR received a cd compilation of music from the 
entire electronic music spectrum made by the people from the list(Uncle Noah 
please give us more info??)with admission!!! Although I didn't attend, I 
think its a great idea that people on SFR should come together to put out a 
cd with their music. I know there are alot of djs/producers here who make 
their on beats. Has this been done before?

Augie

Well damn Terry, now the cat's out of the bag! And yes, it is *quite* a 
different story in which a young girl finds her calling as a turntable 
tease. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you may even be aroused. ; )

Hey, i have 2cents to add to this...


                Before i begin, id like to let you know that im only 16, =
a junior in High School, and haven't been to a rave. Don't think i dont =
know the music because i live for it.


        Concerning drugs and the raves. I personally don't take/do any =
sort of drugs, nor do i promote its use. However, i really don't crae =
what others do aslong as they don't harm themselves. But to a larger =
extent if the drugs they take make them harm themselves without them =
knowing that is serious.=20
    Concerning the cooperation with authorities, i believ this should be =
done. First off the whole rave-Drug deal/subject should be stopped!! We =
music lovers tshould try to get raves excepted by themselves. Drugs are =
a totaly separate issue, and isn't the point of the rave to come for =
themusic? notthe drugs. So if you want to legalize drugs and yada yada =
yada( by theway the Economist Magazine came out with a amazing report on =
why legalization of drugs would actually be good. www.economist.com) do =
so but dont tie it to legalizing and freeing all the raves. As the =
beastie boys say, "Fight for your right.... toooo =
paaaaaaaaaarrrrrrteeeeeyyyy!"! and then if you want legalize drugs.


I hope this has helped ad more perpestive to the issue. If you disagree =
let me know, kindly please. I don't mean to offend anyone, and hope i =
haven't aswell.=20

Subject: RE: [sfraves] -Recovery- AEC/Otherworld

Lydia W is right--luckily I don't have to spend two hours writing about AEC
coz a lot of it has been said!!  All I want to say tho:

a)  The image I got when I rounded that corner, and saw the silhoette of the
huge dozer with people dancing on it and around it, the jungle permeating
the air, is never going to leave my head

b)  (Please keep in mind I am blond)  Osby actually DID fool me when I asked
him if it was Osby!  I saw him and recognised the hair, and was like "hey
Osby!" and he was like "I'm not Osby.  My name is Osric."  In turn, i was
like "Would you happen to be named Osby on occasion, you alternate ego of
Osby, you!" and he very seriousely said "No. Sorry"  At that point I got
terribly embarrased at talking to the wrong person, stated that I was
terribly sorry but I mistook him for his hair, and left him alone to be
disappointed with his life.

c)  I was glad to meet up with y'all!  Osby sorry you fooled me so well!
Good on ya for staying in character tho.  Good to see Jeff, Aaron, Nathalie,
and all them, in addition to meeting Brooke and Jen (who I now dub Generator
Jen from now on lol).  I even bumped into my friend Jerry, who is part of my
old crew in LA, who i had no idea was at AEC!!!  Oh and Mike the Red Stick
Man you were AWESOME in your appearence today.  Will you be appearing in
full stick attire again anytime soon?  It was also really cool to finally
meet Amber and Shane in person--you're both as cool peeps as u are DJ's =)
And everybody else I met who I can't remember due to my lack of sleep from
this CRAZY weekend, drop me a line =)

Peace!

BTW- sorry to all you those who drew pictures of your alter-ego and had no 
place to hang them. I put Aryck in charge of setting up the posts, string, 
paper, pens, clothespins etc. while I worked the mappoint but he failed me 
miserably. I even wrote him out detailed, step-by-step instructions, and 
explained in words several times what to do... but alas, as always if you 
want something done you have to do it yourself. ; )  Aryck... you know I 
love you, but damn, was it that hard?!? : D

Yeah, that's us- lowering the median age in the room and sending people home 
with visions of short skirts, handcuffs, and ruffled socks. ::Giggle:: I 
really will review this entire weekend soon, but I have class tomorrow and 
I'm tired. G'night everyone, and to those that I saw this weekend: Thanks 
for making my birthday weekend amazing and special. :-)

Subject: [sfraves] one of those silly reviews...for SOund Asylum

hiya,

didnt see any reviews for SOund Assylum,hmmm i wonder why *sarcasm, that
one commercial rave that, that one dj put on...whats her name...the one
people always talk about...the one who just changed her name...i forget
her name, oh well, she IS just a PERSON anyways, not a god, the music is.
, so i thought i'd give it a review...a 5 out of 10, and im being
nice...vibe is everything, and people OD'ing (yes, there was more than
one now...a few unreported (can people start being more resonsable??)
with the combination of a 110 degree venue which is stupid to let happen
since almost ALL od's are because of being OVERHEATED...Can we say RENT,
BARROW, or BUY a commercial fan or two if the venue isnt ventilated
properly, i mean, it DOES mean the prevention of stupid people doing too
many drugs from dying, and certain people with certain attitudes kinda
make the whole damn place seem like another one of those silly commercial
raves where people think their better than one another, its something
thats gettin a little cliche and i dont like it...I do say though, that
it was a nice set up so good job folks...and i hope you had a good
time...im so glad they found those ladders they needed, im sure that all
three of the people who spent forever getting them in the frickin sun all
day and then drove 3 hours to bring them got thanked  cuz they did do it
to stay loyal to the scene and help out, NOT to get in for free, i hope
they know.....im sure denise was greatful for that....she doesnt have to
say thank you, her gratitude is enough....*eyes roll

Subject: [sfraves] sfraver made music?(READ)

Hello,

Down here in SoCal this weekend the SCRubbers threw their own party as
well, 
but with a twist: members of SCR received a cd compilation of music from
the 
entire electronic music spectrum made by the people from the list(Uncle
Noah 
please give us more info??)with admission!!! Although I didn't attend, I

think its a great idea that people on SFR should come together to put
out a 
cd with their music. I know there are alot of djs/producers here who
make 
their on beats. Has this been done before?

Augie

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Question # 8: Should we cooperate/rebel with authorities over drugs?

I agree with your point here that raves should be
accepted without drugs, but it's a little unrealistic.
 You really can't stop people from doing drugs at
raves.  If they want to do it, they are going to find
a way.  You can, however, *educate* people on the
wonderful aspects of the scene aside from drugs.  We
can also try to educate the media, parents, and local
law enforcement as to why raves are wonderful.  This
is usually done by highlighting why we love the music,
the culture, and dancing.

When I decided to tell my parents about my rave
addiction, I started off slowly.  I had them listen to
my CD's and showed them some flyers.  I then would
always talk about how I would dance all night.  And
then, I watched some news broadcasts with them about
raves and explained that while I personally don't use
drugs, it does go on there.  I also explained that the
media tends to overexaggerate for effect.  

Drugs are a part of our generation, not necessarily
our culture.  Drug use goes on at any club, concert,
or party, regardless of whether it's rave related or
not. 

The answer is not necessarily to get drugs out of our
scene, since that is a bit unrealistic, but it is to
get the media and law enforcement to focus less on our
drug use, and more on our cultural importance.

Check out this track while it's still up on the guy's site. Squarepusher
freakin' rules. (Their recent tune "My Red Hot Car" rules times two.)

As you may have noticed, I probably won't be doing the Track Of The Day
on
the weekends, because a lot of people don't read their email on the
weekends, and I'm also busy as hell on the weekends too, so deal with
it  =P

Anyway, hope you enjoyed last weeks bizness, today is something MUCh
different, and much newer, and someone who I am obsessed with AGAIN (he
just gets better and better everytime I hear his stuff).  Not "old
skool",
but I never wanted to do JUST old skool for this anyway.  =)  So here
goes:

Squarepusher - Come On My Selector - 1998 (Nothing Records)

http://djentropy.home.mindspring.com/Squarepusher_-_Come_On_My_Selector.mp3

(watch the wraparound)

Tom Jenkinson is my hero.  As Squarepusher, he simply just makes the
coolest fucking music in the world.  It's really too bad he cancelled
his
US tour, because I would have probably gone here and to NYC and wherever

else I could get to to see him, hehehe.

Anyway, this tune is off of "Big Loada", and I have the EP on vinyl,
which
has 5 of the tunes on it.  I actually played out two of his tunes last
night, and fuck, his stuff is so wikked on a system.  Thsi tune was one
of
the first things I hade heard from him, back when it came out, and it's
fucken insane.  Never has the Lyn break sounded so good!  Woop!

He plays all the basslines himself on a bass guitar, so I heard, and
besides that, this man can program a beat like no other.  If every genre

incorporated this much drumwork, I would run out of money, cause I would

buy everything that came out, heh.

Anyway, this tune rules, so turn it up loud and confuse the hell out of
everyone.  :)

Enjoy!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfraver made music?(READ)


yep yep!

my company, Abduction Productions, is who produced
that CD.  it's the second such album to come from the
SoCal-Raves list.

for those interested in hearing some samples of the
CD, and possibly picking one up - surf over to my
preview website at http://www.invert.com/~scrcomp002

these willing be showing up in record stores in the
bay area in the next couple weeks, so if you don't get
one online, ask at your favorite record store. 

anyway, marketing this disc right now is my primary
duty, but i've been thinking that after the first of
the year, i'd like to bring this project to the
SFRaves list.  now that i've produced one, i'm certain
that i could produce another.  it's just a matter of
having the resources available and such.

so those who have been working on tracks and who might
be interested, consider this early warning.  :D

in the mean time, please check out the previews on the
website, order a copy of the disc online and tell yoru
favorite record stores that they need to stock this
album!! 

:)

Need to put the whole thing up in MP3. Samples... psh. No thanks. There's

love to hear it, but not for $15.

Do you know who gets what share of that $15? I don't. Besides, like I said, 
there's SO much free music out there, and I just sent out a load of my promo 
CDs for free (costing me $$$), so any music I'm gonna pick up has to be free 
or traded for mine.

I agree....I actually just recieved Chris' CD in the
mail on Saturday....(thanks for sending it all the way
to VA!) and I thought it was great!

I love free CD's :)  Especially when it's a skilled DJ
that sends it to you!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] sfraver made music?(READ)

Good Production on that one but it sounds like EVERY other melodic trance 
track. Nothing Stands out in the track that would make me say ohhh I need 
that track. (I.E No wicked bass lines,Tripped out filtered vocal,Crazy 
Hoover Synth stab etc..) You get the picture where im going with this. But 
then again I don't play or listen to trance so maybe the Trance Fiend/DJ's 
may dig it. But good production just does not grab me that much..

Peace,
Macadio

You could also realize that we're already poor from buying tickets and 
water.. since most music is free.. the music that isn't free doesn't get 
listened to.

if you are 21, you can hit up thump at 550, and there you will get fliers of
some of the really good parties, there arent too many psy parties advertised
openly. You can also look out for more Neural Enlightenment's being put on
by Michael liu and neuroscience. Thump would be your best bet to get
yourself into the scene.

Yeah, I agree with that, (and Chris's first response
to my email)...but what made me say it was Augie's
first email about the CD's.  They were originally done
for SCRavers and handed out as part of the admission
price for a SCRavers party.  Now Noah is selling the
rest on his site for those who want a copy.

More then looking at it as a music CD for sale, I more
saw it as a person(s)' effort to put together a CD
(which Noah did suggest doing up here for SFR) for the
community, by the community.  It does take effort to
put something like that together, and he does deserve
to be compensated, if that is what is agreed on.  

I think it's a good idea, and I'd be willing to
purchase it. (SFR CD)

love, heather

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [BSP] SCR.COMP.002 now available!!

yep, i'd have to agree with everything you said heather! the fact that it 
was included with admission totally kicks ass. i'm really not into the whole 
mp3/napster swapping thing anyways, so i guess i'm a traditionalist when it 
comes to supporting artist(but lets not get into that issue).

bottom line is that its a great idea for a community like SCR or SFR to come 
together and show off all of the amazing talent.

put something like that together, and he does deserve
to be compensated, if that is what is agreed on.

I think it's a good idea, and I'd be willing to
purchase it. (SFR CD)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [BSP] SCR.COMP.002 now available!!

the bottom line is this:

it costs money to buy the gear to make the tracks.
it costs money to license the tracks from the artists.
it costs money to get the artwork done.
it costs money to have the album mastered.
it costs money to have the album replicated.
it costs money to have the album packaged.
it costs money to ship the album to people.
and it costs money to have a legal business license.

this isn't some
burned-off-my-computer-using-music-that-i-stole-off-napster
DJ mix.  this is a professionally-produced compilation
of original music that people invested their talent,
time and money into making.

and as far as attacking my business practices in terms
of what percentage the artists are receiving off the
sales, i've got two words for you:  free enterprise. 
 
all artists appearing on the CD were compensated for
their work and signed legal contracts with Abduction
Productions.  everything was fair, everything was
agreed upon and everything is 100% legit.  

which is more than i can say for the majority of dj
mixes that most of us own.

when you play a DJ gig at a rave, do make sure you
send a portion of the money you get paid to each of
the artists who's records you spin?  have you legally
licensed every track on every mixtape and CD that
you've produced?  are you making sure to submit your
quarterly statements to the agencies that handle the
licensing of those tracks so they know how many
recorded units you sold, how many times their tracks
were played in open-air environment and how many times
their tracks were broadcasted?  what city is your DJ
business registered in?  what's your state of
California resale permit number?  i'm willing to bet
that the general business practices of the typical
bedroom DJ are far shadier than mine if you really
want to go toe-to-toe on it.  

if someone out there wants to make a freebie album, i
say more power to you.  i'd be very interested in
finding out who you wind up using for gear, software,
art, printing, replication, mastering, assembly,
shipping, business licensing, and event planning
since, in your plan, they'll do their work for free so
you can have the joy of handing out your albums for
free.  

if these people exist, i'd really *really* like to
meet them because i've got some great project that i
just don't have the $$ to produce, but if i could do
it all for free, we'd have some great stuff.

the day i can run a project like this for free, i'll
glady hand them out for free.  until then we live in a
capitalist system where everything costs something.  

*sigh*

I kinda agree.. but if artists were to give me their tracks, I wouldn't 
have any problem compiling the CD and making it available on the net.. for 
free.. or making some cd's to be handed out at the next SFR-P party.. 
(also, at no cost to the receiver)

Let's be clear here. An overdose is just that. It results from taking too
large a dose. Overheating is a real and common problem. It is, in fact, much
more common than overdoses are. (We are talking about E, right?) So, I
believe that there were several people that overheated. I find it doubtful
that there were any overdoses.

Let's keep the parties safe people! Free water! Good ventilation! Chill
rooms! And let's not feed the anti-rave propoganda machines by mistakenly
seeing "overdoses" where there are none.

    hey no fair. .


        well. .  given that the music actualy got up and running around 1
something ish, there wasn't a huge rush to put it up, even after the map
point people were back.

    Also. .  where was it supposed to go ? there was one light ? were people
supposed to huddle behind the dj booth and draw pictures ?

        I even asked you that after I saw you at the space. . . the basket
an instructions n all were in my car the whole time. . . and people were
going in n out of my car the whole time so you knew it was there. . .

        I love you too, and I asked you about it when I saw you there and
explained the situation, but there wasn't any resolution. . .

: )

Kimba, 

Something like: 

Order Allow,Deny
Allow from all
Deny from 207.46.197.100

And, if I may bitch a little after answering... 

A. This isn't a question for "linux headz". 
B. This isn't the right forum. 
C. This should have been prefixed with NRR.
D. The documentation is clear.

Subject: [sfraves] Behold (my new demo CD)

Yo Sfravers,
           Well, here it is--my first demo CD made in my time in SF:
Behold.  It's a dark-ish mix of trance, progressive, and a tiny bit of
darkwave that sounds kinda-well-different, and ranges from mellow to hard.
Some of the artists on the disc:  Lexos, Cosmic Gate, Epilepsy, Apoptigma
Berserk, Tekara, Niels Van Gogh, Muse, Roland Klinkenberg, and Vicious
Circles.  Anyways, if you are a promoter, DJ, or enthusiast, and would like
a copy, please email me back personally with a mailing address (or hit me up
at any event I'm going to and i might have a couple in my bag).  If you are
a DJ, i would LOVE to also get a copy of your promo CD or tape in exchange
=)

	Also, for those who I promised a promo to earlier on, sorry I'm so
late--after I got back from the UK, i got very busy, and that combined with
a computer disaster held me up for a bit.  Enjoy!

	Oh yea, and if you know any other promoters or peeps who want it, send'em
over to me.  I'll also be streaming it on my site www.nomadicDJ.com in the
near future, if you want to be nice and help save a little of the CD burning
for me =) (and sign my guestbook, of course!)

Looking forward to hearing from you guys soon

Peace!

You're an engineer eh?  Know more about Windows then those supporting it eh?
What certifications do you have that say this to the world?  Does any *nix
vendor or Microsoft or any OS venders recognize you as a seasoned veteran
with some kind of certification or award?

This is a totally ridiculous paragraph.  I'm sorry, I don't even believe
that this is the forum to have this discussion, but I can't let something
this incorrect pass for the truth around here.

Windows is not stable.  Period. End of sentence.  It hasn't been until
recently that Microsoft has even thought of it as any kind of priority to
deal with any kind of stability issues in their operating systems or even
their applications.

When people like myself talk about stability, we're not talking hours or
days.  We're not talking weeks.  We're talking months, at the least.
What's the longest you've had a Windows box of any flavor go 60 days
without needing to be rebooted?  NT and 2K may approach this kind of
stability, but the 9x/Me series could not go a month without crashing.

You want to talk real stability?  A real OS will be stable enough,
pay close attention here, that a machine running it will stay up
through an entire Microsoft product cycle.  I know of machines in people's
bedrooms that have run for two years or more without a reboot.

In my experience with these pieces of software, I've learned a thing or
two.  I know more about Windows than most people who support it, and I know
about Unix than most people who support (Ah! The joys of being an
engineer!).

Do you know that in Canada, the highest tax bracket of their tax systems
starts pretty low, probably around $75,000/year?  Do know that their
highest tax bracket is 51%?  That's right, more than half of your income
goes to the government as tax.  That's a about a third more than,
percentage-wise than you would pay in the United States.

What's my point?  Saying that Windows is stable is like saying that
Canadians don't have high taxes: it's nuts.  In a world where all
definitions like this are relative, stable is not the way to describe
Windows.  You clearly either a) have no experience running a truly stable
operating system or b) have some other agenda that's making you lie.

/ari, still recovering from the very fucking cool Urban Wasteland last
night.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [BSP] SCR.COMP.002 now available!!

I realize stuff costs money. I realize the time/effort/paperwork to do all 
this legit. And I wasn't "attacking" your business practices (although the 
"free enterprise" defense doesn't mean much... people get screwed all the 
time in the name of "free enterprise"). I didn't even know that it was you 
personally putting it out, but that's neither here nor there. I was saying, 
in response to "support the artists etc" that I don't know who's getting 
what.

But I'm not posting this to get into legal semantics, or who deserves what 
money for what work.

All I'm saying is this: You're right. We do live in a capitalist system. If 
you want to sell something, you're free to do that. But so long as some are 
charging for what can be found for free, those that are charging are going 
to have a harder time getting their stuff heard, especially when the artists 
are relatively unheard of. If I got the license for all the tracks in my 
promo and made a snazzy CD insert, mastered it, etc, would you pay me $15 
for it?

Screw certifications and awards. I wouldn't doubt that Ari has a few, but
even if he doesn't, he is talking from experience. Besides, as you point out
yourself, those certifications come from the *vendors*. How many
certifications do you have to prove that you've been properly indoctrinated
into the not-so-holy Windows Religion?

Windows is about as stable as a washing machine filled with nitroglycerin.

Looks to me like you think that I was flaming you.  I was not.  I was
merely pointing out that calling Windows stable is just not true in the big
picture.  Think of a small African nation, run by a string of dictators.  A
new one rises to power who is not quite as bloodthirsty as the last and
easier on the people.  One resident of this nation says to the other: "Ah,
it's nice to finally have some freedom around here."  Locally, things have
improved, but they sure ain't free.

It looks to me like you're trying to do some dick-swinging.  No thanks.
First of all, this list is not the place for it.  Second of all, I have
nothing to prove to you; I'm very secure in what I know and my place in the
both the larger world and the smaller tech world.  But let me answer you
questions:

1) Yes, I'm an engineer.
2) Yes, I know more about Windows than the average desktop support
tech.  I don't claim to be a Windows professional.
3) I have no certifications or awards.

Cerifications and awards are a whole different discussion that I would more
than happy to have with you, but here's the short version: MCSE, CCNA,
CCIE, all that stuff does not tell anything about how good someone is at
their job.  In the technology sector, we tend to be in the business of
solving problems.  None of those certifications actually teaches you
anything except information that you would need to solve problems with
specific product.  Problem solving is about synthesis.  All that
information is available when you need it.  It's what you *do* with the
information that makes you good (or not).

I know a lot of people who are very, very good at their jobs, both on the
Unix side and the Windows.  The people that I would call "good"?  None of
them have any certifications.  They don't need it.

If you'd like to continue this discussion, I'd love to share my viewpoint
with you.  If you'd like to flame me, go ahead, I don't really give a fuck.
But either way, let's take it off the list.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

I have an MCSE, and as a former Microsoft senior network engineer can attest
that at least their training is good.  But have you seen the recent reports
from SANS indicating that MS certified professions lack significant areas of
expertise in even basic security implimentations, making them almost
worthless with respect to commercial online applications outside the LAN.

Shameless job plug
------------------
I am however abandoning my 15 year MS tech service career for a strategic
planning / market analyst position with a high-tech leader in semiconductor
/ telecom / or related industry, if anyone can help me out.. I have a Master
in Applied Microeconomics, specializing in semiconductor price modeling and
I need a job extra speedy like before I get ejected from the santa cruz
commune.. :)  PLUR!

That should actually be:

simmer down now, newbie.  inferring that i'm out to
screw artists isn't exactly PLURry, now, is it?  i
think there are more than a few folks on this list who
can attest to my moral standing and would be willing
to advocate on my behalf that my efforts in The Scene
aren't to screw anyone.

so you're advocating criminal/illegal activity since
it's just simply easier than actually paying for a
legit CD.

it's easier to smash the window at the electronics
shop and get yourself a free TV than it is to pay for
one.

dude, if you really think this way, then what the hell
are you doing in the underground end of the electronic
music scene?  the whole point of what we're all up to
here is creating an environment where there's a
constant flow of new artistic talent.  we're not
looking to see the 60+ year old roocker on tour
playing the same bullshit that's been on the air for
the last 40 years.  The Scene is all about new music
from people you've never heard of blasting out over
the air and giving you feelings like you've never had
before.

> 

first off, if you don't have the licensing for the
tracks on your promo CD, why would you distribute it? 
handing out free copies of someone else's work is
pretty low, don't you think?

secondly, to address your point, if it was an album
that seemed interesting to me and that was the price
for it then yes.  that's the way legal, legitimate
business is run.  

it's the same as laying out money to record stores for
copies of the new Uberzone and Crystal Method CDs,
laying out money for the new pieces of vinyl i pick up
at the DJ shop, laying out money for my lunch at the
burger stand, paying for the gas i put in my Beetle,
etc. etc. etc.  that's what consumer capitalism is all
about.      

you should, by law, have licensing rights to any music
that you're selling or reproducing.  that's not my
rule, that's the RIAA.  ever notice that little spot
on your records and CDs that says something to the
effect of "Unauthorized duplication, performance or
broadcast is prohibited"?  ever heard of the Harry Fox
Agency?  how about ASCAP or BMI?  these organizations
exist to make sure that artists and producers don't
get screwed by folks reproducing their music and
distributing or selling it without properly paying for
its use.  

DJs legally licensing tracks and putting them out on
professional mixed albums is not unheard of.  a quick
look around your favorite record shop will show you
examples from folks like John Kelley, Simply Jeff,
Paul Oakenfeld, Timo Maas, Fatboy Slim and many many
others.

licensing really isn't all that difficult to set up,
and in the end it costs a lot less than getting sued
by a record company or music publishing house.  if
you're seriously considering putting out material for
sale, i highly suggest doing it all legit.

Subject: [sfraves] any dancehall ravers (?)

all-

	from the first time i heard it loud, in the hiphop room at Limelight in 
94, i have been completely stunned by dancehall.  the energy of it still 
renders me speechless.  most know that dancehall gets the least credit for 
dance music, and it deserves so much more (it's what made house and DnB 
cool, and it's all that keeps downbeat alive).
if you don't believe me look under hip hop on
http://alienrecords.net
and listen to some dubs ... blackchiney, sizzla, capleton ... you'll see 
that's no exaggeration
	no soap-boxing here: i just finally have the courage now to dive into it 
and never look back.  but dammit, it's scary.  the shit comes out like 4 
times the speed of any other music and you practically have to buy it off 
the boat to get the real thing.  there has got to be someone else out there 
in rave land that knows some
--> DJs of ALL genres that mix in a healthy dose of dancehall
--> online resources for dancehall fans
--> artists that i haven't heard of that would take some of the guesswork 
out of this

	thanks to all for any help.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: IE OR NETSCAPRE 6.0

That's why I said from ANY OS Vendor.  Hell, I am IBM Certified in some old
shit, from Mainframe days.  I am certified in Digital VMS (another old
outdated OS) and could take the test and get a NCA cert with no problem.  I
am A+ certified and am working on A+ Network Certification as well as
Solaris certification.  I am working on the Microsoft shit because it's a
way to get more money.  My experience and reputation with coworkers and
former employers is enough to tell any prospective employer I am as good as
I say I am.

I guess the real question should have been does he read and comprehend the
English language.  I never said Windows was without faults.  I never said it
was the end all answer to everything and I never said it was perfect.  What
I did say was that a properly configured server with certified hardware
makes for a very stable machine.  I have had Windows 9x workstations a that
would go a week or so without needing a reboot and most of the time the
reboots had to be done because of memory leaks in third party software, not
the OS.  I have also seen workstations that would never be stable.  I have
had servers the same way and my point was just what you and all of the
others in the list are proving, Microsoft and its products get a bad rap
when they do not always deserve it.  You show me the perfect operating
system, one that has NO flaws and NO show stopping bugs and I will bow down
and call it god.  Then let me install it on some hardware and let some
'experienced' programmers write some applications on it.  Then let's talk.

Rather then reply to messages with intelligent comments or arguments I get
the forever childish insults of did I copy this from the manufacturer's
website or am I a brainless member of their religion.  The reality is that
*I* am glad Microsoft makes vastly unstable products because if the current
Wintel industry got on the ball and made PC's that did not need
administration, then I would have to find another job.

How many times has a piece of software or a driver you installed made your
system unstable?  Is that truly Microsoft's fault?

I have an MCSE, and as a former Microsoft senior network engineer can attest
that at least their training is good.  But have you seen the recent reports
from SANS indicating that MS certified professions lack significant areas of
expertise in even basic security implimentations, making them almost
worthless with respect to commercial online applications outside the LAN.

Shameless job plug

I am however abandoning my 15 year MS tech service career for a strategic

Screw certifications and awards. I wouldn't doubt that Ari has a few, but
even if he doesn't, he is talking from experience. Besides, as you point out
yourself, those certifications come from the *vendors*. How many
certifications do you have to prove that you've been properly indoctrinated
into the not-so-holy Windows Religion?

Windows is about as stable as a washing machine filled with nitroglycerin.

Subject: [sfraves] Chris Jackson! --> *Tonight* @ Secret Society (bsp)

Hi all,
Tonight starts our $1 donation door charge. We've enjoyed being able to keep
our night free for the first 6 months, as it has gone extremely well.
Up to now, Mike and I have pulled from our pockets every week for all of our
enjoyment, and as time went on and the SS gained momentum, it seemed our
costs were rising beyond our means. Tho it is a free party, and we like to
think of it that way and keep that vibe, it was getting quite costly for us
to maintain. So, we got input from several of our core members, and decided
as a whole that if we could all help, just a small little bit each week, we
could really take the SS to new heights.. as a collective effort. So with
that, we (Mike, Andy and I) decided that we'd implement a $1 cover charge at
the door, and refer to it as a donation, because that is what you are doing,
donating to the SS cause, to keep it here and this good each week. We don't
want to break into your drink cash stash, so we thought if everyone just put
in a buck, we could still pay for our visuals, decor, and music with a lil
more than just a pat on the back and a thank you. We are sorry if this
detours anyone, we only want to keep our Monday nights as great as they have
been the last 6 months... Thanks for understanding.

Feel free to email me if you have any questions or concerns...

And with that our lineup for tonight is  -->

Subject: [sfraves] SRR:  Ugh... Do I need a "raver name" ???


I always avoided making up one before.  Never felt the need, and I'm happy with
"John".  It does get inconvinent sometimes tho...  Especially when you get into
a group with "Jason"s, "Jake"s, more "John"s, and worse... "Josh"s.

I dunno how it happened here... Somehow, Im the only "John" my circles of
friends, and even other "J"s turned out to be rare....  Except when Osby was
rapid-fire-introducing people (A buncha "J"s) to me at Ascension last
thursday....

But back in Florida, it was something else.... I was one of THREE "John"s in a
group of friends that also included two "Jason"s, a "Jeff", a "Jake", and FOUR
"Jennifer"s  (well, two "Jen"s, a "Jenny", and a "Jennifer").

Wacky, eh?  So we developed a series of pseudonyms... some nicknames, some
initials, some lastnames...  It works pretty well, even to this day.

So where's this going?

Wheh I first joined SFRaves, I was still in the habit of useing my last name. 
It was all fine... till I found out that there is a DJ that uses my last name
as his DJ name!!!  Oh, that and everyone always asks me if I'm related to Steve
(It would be cool if I WAS... who wouldn't want to be able to claim that "'Mr
Pink' is my uncle"??? but, to my knowledge, I'm not).

So to avoid confusion, I shortened my mail name to "John B".  NOW, only two
weeks ago, I find out that there is, and has been for years, a DJ who spins by
the name "John B", right here in San Francisco (odd that in a year and a half,
Ive never heard of him tho)....  and a few people at Ascension were asking if I
was him.... ARRRAGGGHHH.

So my question to SFRaves is:  Do I need a "raver name"?  Something so funky or
cheezy that no one will ever confuse me with anybody else?  Do I just stick
with "John B" and keep the name collision and explain to people that, no, I'm
not the DJ John B?  Do I go back to useing my last name and collide with the
national DJ, and go back to getting asked how to pronounce it and if Im related
to Steve?

Or if I *DO* need a "raver name", what should it be?

Hm... if I ever developed musical talent and needed a "DJ Name" (yeah.... hell
will freeze over, pigs will fly, george bush will grow grey matter, and bill
gates will develop a consience befort *THAT* happens), I *DO* know what THAT
would be:  NRTS and it would be an acronym for "No Relation To Steve"...  I
guess I'd just HAVE to spin NRG with a name like that.  Hmmm...



cya,
john

He isn't advocating shit.  He said, if you're going to sell your cd, it 
isn't going to get heard as often as if you gave it away.

Right, and making it harder for those artists to be heard isn't going to

No - why would it be low?  a DJ Promo CD is a testament to the DJ's ability 
to combine tracks in a meaningful way.  It is not to claim credit for 
producing the individual tracks, nor to make profit off them.  Distribution 
is to get the DJ bookings, and during the set, their is no guarantee that 
any of the tracks on the promo would be used again.  Perhaps I'm extremely 
dense today, but I don't understand why a DJ doesn't have to license lp's 
spun at a party, but he does if he records the mix?

apples to oranges.  Neither Crystal Method nor Uberzone are underground 
music producers seeking fans and dj's to help them get bigger.  They are 
both established, with est. fan bases - they would have nothing to gain by 
giving their cd's away for free.

All Hail the might RIAA!  For they are RIGHT, and kissing their ass is they 
way to make change!  I have a right to backup or make other format copies 
of any music that I purchase; what then prohibits me from playing me tape 
version of oakenfold in my car?  What if (gasp) I have passengers in the 
car that don't own the original CD?

that's why pirates frighten the RIAA to DEATH.  They don't have the 
incredible resources necessary to sue everyone single person out there 
willing to share music.

simmer down now, newbie.  inferring that i'm out to
screw artists isn't exactly PLURry, now, is it?  i
think there are more than a few folks on this list who
can attest to my moral standing and would be willing
to advocate on my behalf that my efforts in The Scene
aren't to screw anyone.

so you're advocating criminal/illegal activity since
it's just simply easier than actually paying for a
legit CD.

it's easier to smash the window at the electronics
shop and get yourself a free TV than it is to pay for
one.  

> especially when the artists  are relatively unheard
> of. 

dude, if you really think this way, then what the hell
are you doing in the underground end of the electronic
music scene?  the whole point of what we're all up to
here is creating an environment where there's a
constant flow of new artistic talent.  we're not
looking to see the 60+ year old roocker on tour
playing the same bullshit that's been on the air for
the last 40 years.  The Scene is all about new music
from people you've never heard of blasting out over
the air and giving you feelings like you've never had
before.  

> If I got the license for all the tracks in my 
> promo and made a snazzy CD insert, mastered it, etc,
> would you pay me $15 for it?
> 

first off, if you don't have the licensing for the
tracks on your promo CD, why would you distribute it? 
handing out free copies of someone else's work is
pretty low, don't you think?

secondly, to address your point, if it was an album
that seemed interesting to me and that was the price
for it then yes.  that's the way legal, legitimate
business is run.  

it's the same as laying out money to record stores for
copies of the new Uberzone and Crystal Method CDs,
laying out money for the new pieces of vinyl i pick up
at the DJ shop, laying out money for my lunch at the
burger stand, paying for the gas i put in my Beetle,
etc. etc. etc.  that's what consumer capitalism is all
about.      

you should, by law, have licensing rights to any music
that you're selling or reproducing.  that's not my
rule, that's the RIAA.  ever notice that little spot
on your records and CDs that says something to the
effect of "Unauthorized duplication, performance or
broadcast is prohibited"?  ever heard of the Harry Fox
Agency?  how about ASCAP or BMI?  these organizations
exist to make sure that artists and producers don't
get screwed by folks reproducing their music and
distributing or selling it without properly paying for
its use.  

DJs legally licensing tracks and putting them out on
professional mixed albums is not unheard of.  a quick
look around your favorite record shop will show you
examples from folks like John Kelley, Simply Jeff,
Paul Oakenfeld, Timo Maas, Fatboy Slim and many many
others.

licensing really isn't all that difficult to set up,
and in the end it costs a lot less than getting sued
by a record company or music publishing house.  if
you're seriously considering putting out material for
sale, i highly suggest doing it all legit.

Holy SHIT!  A whole fucking WEEK??  That's completely RIDICULOUS.  You seem 
to think that by insulting Ari, your argument looks better.  It does 
not.  If you could comprehend English, you would have read something like 
"What MS OS can stay up for a whole MONTH?"  Come on, it doesn't take a 
masters in linguistics to understand the difference between week and 
month.  Sure, a configured quake server, with no extra hardware, could 
prolly run in DOS for over a week.  That doesn't make the OS stable, it 
makes it limited.

How are we all proving it?  I've yet to see a single instance where MS has 
gotten a bad rap.  I'm not saying linux, OS/2, or OSX is the next 
god-os.  I'm saying MS has too much control over the market, and we all 
suffer b/c of their excuses aka products.

Yeah, just like I suck Cisco's cock for making routers that eventually fail 
or have issues.  We're in it for the money, after all, and not into solving 
problems.

When the same driver, written by the same programmers, works better in 
another OS, yes.

Holy SHIT!  A whole fucking WEEK??  That's completely RIDICULOUS.  You seem
to think that by insulting Ari, your argument looks better.  It does
not.  If you could comprehend English, you would have read something like
"What MS OS can stay up for a whole MONTH?"  Come on, it doesn't take a
masters in linguistics to understand the difference between week and
month.  Sure, a configured quake server, with no extra hardware, could
prolly run in DOS for over a week.  That doesn't make the OS stable, it
makes it limited.

How are we all proving it?  I've yet to see a single instance where MS has
gotten a bad rap.  I'm not saying linux, OS/2, or OSX is the next
god-os.  I'm saying MS has too much control over the market, and we all
suffer b/c of their excuses aka products.

Yeah, just like I suck Cisco's cock for making routers that eventually fail
or have issues.  We're in it for the money, after all, and not into solving
problems.

When the same driver, written by the same programmers, works better in
another OS, yes.

i don't see anyone complaining that Astralwerks,
Skint, Perfecto, Freskanova, Joker or any other record
label charges for their products.

why is it that there's a complaint if i do?

why is it that folks are more than happy to buy and
sell products from thousands of other companies on a
daily basis, but if i'm involved in it, it has to be
for free, or at a highly significant personal loss in
order to be legitimate. 

that's the part that i'm not understanding.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [BSP] SCR.COMP.002 now available!!

WOW I know ive seen this thread before... Anyhoo the reason a DJ usually
doesn't have to pay licensing on something he/she spins at an event is
because in the normal music world (the one which all this licensing shit was
set up for, yes that's live music) the space pays licensing fees usually to
ASCAP BMI or another licensing distributor whom take there chunk then pass
along royalties. Most live shows/large parties/ events don't allow recording
devices thus the music is herd once and then potentially bought by the
audience. No one looses money. This is changing really quickly with the
quality of bootlegs getting better and better. not to mention now you have
DJ's plugging into the house and recording there sets live with full sound
quality without the proper licensing then releasing those mix's. That's were
it gets hairy. Live sets must be licensed differently if there going to be
recorded and in our scene allot of them are illegally. The same way radio
stations do. That's one of the reasons your supposed to count attendance at
events (most just guess if that). Some how I feel the kazaa and satellite
debate shortly arising but Surillion there's your answer. Oh almost forgot.
All it takes is one DJ on an independent label getting really big and one
artist on one of his/her earlier mixes seeing that they could make some
money and sewing for an independent label to fold. So I kinda see both your
points of view.

Dancin for SMILES =)

I rather think that makes the analogy even  better. Windows is pretty stable
as long as you just boot it up and let it sit there... but, run some
software (kick it) and it'll blow. ;-)

Ah!  Here we see the crux of the issue!  It's not a question of "have to"
or not.  It's a question of will he/she pay licensing for the public
performance of the recorded music.

When you buy a record/CD, you're getting a license for you to listen to it,
and that's it.  Anything else you want to do with it costs more money, paid
to someone like ASCAP or BMI.

Technically, if you have, say, a frat boy style house party, with a keg and
stuff, and you have a boombox playing "Jock Rock, Vol. 7", you need to pay
licensing fees.  No one does.  Nor will you be arrested for it.  Copyright
violation enforcement is the job of the copyright holder (record companies)
not the police.

But yes, the DJ always needs to be licensed for public performance of the
tracks.  And yes, usually that is taken care of by the above-ground venue.
For excellent info on this, I'd suggest reading the stuff that jwz has put
together on his struggle to get DNA Lounge off the ground:

The law is on the side of the RIAA.  I'm not saying it's right, it's just
the law.

No, but they have the money they need to get the laws changed so they can
make the penalties much stiffer.  That's the thing to worry about.

Hey! If you keep giving everyone the right information on their tech

Seriously though, I have no real excuse for those blunders. Sorry... I'll go

Newbie? You have no idea how long I've been on the list. Just because I 
don't spout off every other day...

I wasn't saying that you're out to screw artists. You gave "two words: free 
enterprise" as your argument, like that was the end-all to the conversation. 
All I said was that "free enterprise" doesn't mean squat in regards to 
ethics. You didn't say "people on here can vouch for me", you said "free 
enterprise". REPEAT: this is not an attack on you or your ethics, it is a 
rebuke to your "free enterprise" statement.

I didn't advocate anything. I said more people will hear it if it's free. I 
didn't mean for you to post their music for free without consulting with the 
artists, I meant the artists should give permission for it to be posted.

You mean like it's easier to violate a noise ordinance, or trespass or break 
into a warehouse, or jaywalk? Even my by-the-book dad gave me a copy of Doom 
2 days ago. Maybe you should go work for Sony or BMG.

I've got tons of new music. From people I've never heard of. Didn't pay for 
any of it (and no, they didn't want me to). Technically, those DJs are 
violating copyright law (I guess, you probably know more about copyright law 
than I, but I'm not here to argue copyright law)... but you know what? I 
have their music. I know their names. If I ever see their name on a flyer, 
I'll try to catch the show. THAT'S my point. Why are you in the underground 
scene if you're so intent on charging for it, on integrating it into the 
"capitalist system"?

Yup. I'm scum. I'm sure all the people who got my CD would agree to that. 
And I'm sure Madam Zu, Nick Sentience, and Andy Farley are damn pissed that 
I'm spending my money to get their music to other people.

But when there's other music that's free, it becomes a question of "is it so 
much more interesting than the free stuff that I'll pay for it?" If there's 
music that costs money and is really good, then music that's free and is 
really good (doesn't even have to be REALLY good, it's free after all), why 
bother with the stuff that costs?

I haven't paid for music in a long time. Not because I burn copies or use 
Napster, but because I just look around the net for DJ sites w/mixes, or I 
get free CDs at parties. Why bother with mainstream artists when there are 
those who just want you to hear their stuff? Are you saying the SCR people 
are on par with Crystal Method, Uberzone, Fatboy Slim and Paul Oakenfeld?

And just because "that's what consumer capitalism is all about" doesn't mean 
consumer capitalism is the best way.

Yes, I'm aware of those agencies and their purpose. Have you ever heard of 
the DEA? Hope you've never touched a controlled substance. Ever heard of the 
DPT? Hope you've never jaywalked. Ever heard of the CHP? Hope you've never 
driven over 65mph.

Oh, and being the superstar DJ that I am, I of course have the money for 
that. What, you've never heard of The Baron?! I just played a 12 hour set at 
1015 last week! And considering the tens of thousands of CDs I sent out, I'm 
really screwing those guys over. Oh and when I said I sent them for free, I 
really meant I charged $20. My bad.

Well, I'm not trying to put music out for sale. I'm just trying to get my 
skills heard. I figured that's what the SCR people were doing, but I guess I 
was wrong.

I would like to reitterate (sp), in case it wasn't clear, that all I'm 
saying is that if you want the MOST people to hear your music, then just 
give it away. Otherwise you cut yourself off from those who don't want to 
pay, who realize there's a free two-hour MP3 or something just around the 
next hyperlink. If you want to sell something, fine. But when people say 
"you should post it free", you'd be better off to just say "oh well, your 
loss" (or is it yours?), than to take it all personal and get in a huff 
about copyright law. And only your own priorities ("$$$" vs 
"exposure/sharing your music") will determine whose loss it actually is.

Actually it is called the Perseids and it happens every year in august.  The peak of it is between the 11th and the 13th or so.

As for the party, all I feel I need to add is that 'Come as you arent' was a party to remember.  One to be proud to be part of.

Subject: [sfraves] Free Music vs. Paid CDs

I've been following this thread a just wanted to throw in my two cents. I
have a tendancy to agree with both parties on several points, and disagree
on others.

As an artist who writes my own tracks, I'd really just like anyone who's
willing to take a listen and spread the word. I want the world to hear my
music, and would gladly give it
for free to anyone who wants it.

Then I start getting in the blurred lines of, "Well, who's going to pay my
bills?" - I would love nothing more than to spend my entire
day making my music a reality and I'd die to have someone come in and make
sure
all my bills are paid and I can continue to live the livestyle I've grown
acustomed to. At some point, there's a place where every artist needs to
say, "Okay, now I need to start selling my music so I can do that." Maybe
someday I'll actually be able to make a dime off my own stuff so I don't
have to keep my day job. Until that day, you'll hear it for free.

And I --completely-- agree that there are a million artists out there who
are still giving their works away for free that are so extremely unnoticed
and deserve the attention that someone who's collecting $15 for their music.

When you start wanting people to hear your music, I don't think it's to your
benefit to sell the material. Your best bet is typically to pass out the CDs
for free to as many people as you can get to take a copy. Once you've got
them hooked, and you can begin charging. That's how you get to be at the
place you really want to be.

Those who jump and say, "Well, that's not the spirit of the underground
scene!" should step back a moment and picture this scenerio: I decide I'm
going to release my new CD. I'll produce it all on my own at home so I don't
have to pay for a studio. Once it's done, I'm going to print 500 copies with
a 4-color inlay. I intend on giving it away for free to anyone who wants a
copy. Hell, I really want people to hear my music. The problem is, it's cost
me a lot of time out of my personal life, and I've probably taken quite a
bit of time off work because I was up all night working on this CD. So I've
definately lost quite a bit of money here. I don't mind that it's cost me
money, but when you like my CD and you want my to make more, I may not have
the money to do so. Are you going to donate money to me so that I'll
continue to make the music you like or will you just move on to the next
artist who's going to give you what you want for free? My point is: If
you're just going from artist to artist, you're not supporting anyone or
anything but yourself and your wallet. Supporting someone or something is
giving to it. And when I've made my donation to you/your scene, how are you
going to help me as I did you? Just something to think about...

If you don't want to pay $15 for a CD, then don't. If you feel that artists
are ripping you off when you have the opportunity to listen other artists
for free, then you won't hear those artists. You stand the chance of missing
one of those artists who could be what you're looking for.

I'll continue to buy CDs by artists that I enjoy listening to because they
do deserve the money to continue making the music I want to hear. If I don't
pay, and you don't pay, and that other person doesn't pay, then how do we
know we'll get to hear another CD?

I will however draw the line at support for the RIAA. I believe the real
future of "underground artists" is in the independant label and
production/promotion. The RIAA is nothing but a large group of money hungry
executives who show no love for the music, but for the dollar. Musicians who
have started their own labels have had much more control of their music,
even if it is at the cost of distribution and promotion. It may cost me an
extra $2 per CD to cover those costs, but for me, knowing that I'm
supporting those artists and their music makes it well worth it.

Good luck to the SCR screw in your endevours. I really hope you make the
sales to let you keep making the music you enjoy. =)


Peace,
-John

Subject: [sfraves] SCR.COMP.002 redux


okay, after going back and forth and back and forth, i
think that what we have here is a failure to
communicate, based on various and sundry assumptions
and and infrences, so let me start from the beginning
and see if i can make this a clear picture.

**************

A few months back, I decided to make a bold move.  It
was time for my business to move in a new direction,
so instead of just putting together mixtapes and
getting DJ bookings, I decided to turn Abduction
Productions into an honest-to-God independent record
label.

As my first project, I decided to make a
professionally-produced compilation CD of original
music from members of the SoCal-Raves internet list.  

I put out a call for submissions and wound up with a
group of artists who were all interested in the
project.  Contracts were drawn, money was spent,
tracks were written, professional artwork, mastering
and replication were all done and now we have the CD.

The first official CD release on Abdcution
Productions:

"SCR.COMP.002 - more music from the SoCal-Raves
Internet group"

This album features 10 tracks of original music
written by members of the SoCal-Raves list.  

The CD made its debut at a premier party in Los
Angeles on Saturday.  Now, the CD is available to the
public.  Units are currently shipping to stores, but
if you don't like going to the store, you're welcome
to buy it online directly from the record label (eg.
me).

If you're the kind of person who likes to hear stuff
before they buy it, or if you just want to be sure
that this CD is really worth the investment, then
check out the preview site I've put up at 

http://www.invert.com/~scrcomp002

I think that you'll agree, even based on these small
previews, that the artists on this album are just as
worthy of your CD investment as any other artist you
could pick up off the shelf at Tower, Rasputin's,
Amoeba, Primal, etc.

what we've got here is artists that typically wouldn't
get the professional-level treatment presented in a
professional manner.  I think that after giving them a
listen, you'll agree that they're just as good, if not
better than the "pros" out today.

so if you like electronic music and you're looking to
buy a CD of brand new stuff from artists you've
probably never heard before, check out SCR.COMP.002

thank you.

Subject: [sfraves] GROOVE GARDEN AT MYX:  Tribalicious

Some weekends are pretty arid.  No exceptional parties.  Last weekend, 
however, was one of those where one wishes one had the ability to transport 
oneself instantaneously from one event to another.

AEC, Urban Wasteland, Otherworld, Tomcat's 30th birthday party, and 
Myx.  So many parties, one body.

Fate, or planning, had pretty much determined our weekend a couple of weeks 
ago.  On Friday night we had promised DJ Dragonfly of Groove Garden that we 
would be at Myx to photograph Groove Garden's sets;  Saturday I was 
obligated to spin at a house party.

I'm always eager to spend an evening with Marin's Groove Garden.  They 
always provide such compelling, tribal dance music.  Khaled, Lorin and Dj 
Dragonfly were spinning at Myx Friday and they had me dancing nonstop for 
the whole evening.  Breaks, Drum and Bass, world music, house -- all this 
in the mix, and more.  These guys are truly awesome, and I strongly 
recommend that the next time you see Groove Garden on a flier you get your 
buns to the party for a unique EDM experience.  You don't even need dancing 
shoes.

Groove Garden attracts a warm, sensuous, dedicated group of dancers you 
don't often see at other parties.  Diverse, creative, wildly 
energetic.  Lots of them dance barefoot.  Much improvisation.

And with Groove Garden comes the spirituality and sensuality of old school 
raves.  The Buddha altar with lots of candles, incense, and the message 
tables in back.  Excellent vibe.

The visuals were provided by Viberation, and they were astonishing.  Four 
video sources blended together to make engaging imagery, bits and pieces of 
old Disney animation, soul wrenching landscapes...  The more I see of Terry 
Estioko's work, the more respect I have for him as an artist.  A visual 
artist's soul is on view at a party, and Terry's soul is imaginative and 
lovely.  Certainly one aspect of our community that, I think, will be 
remembered and exhibited when we are all dancing with walkers will be the 
art of the visuals producer.  Visual music.  Perhaps some day Terry's work 
will be exhibited at SFMOMA:)

Joey left in one of his blue funks early, so I rode home in a cab by 
myself.  After wandering about at 4 in the morning in China Basin I was 
picked up by Late Nite Larry, a cab driver I highly recommend 
(7pm-5am/415-606-5770).  Larry was a hippie in the sixties who sold 
psychedelics and such on the Haight.  Native of San Francisco.  When I got 
in the cab, he asked me if I had been DJing that night.  Said no, but that 
I do spin on occasion.  He replies:  "I'll bet you spin 
house."  OK.  Cool.  We get into a long conversation about EDM and 
raves.  Turns out he much prefers ravers and others who love EDM to any 
other type of passenger.  He himself listens to electronic music on his 
radio, and likes the Thump show.  Tells me he would like to attend an EDM 
party but is afraid he is too old and would be rejected.  So I strongly 
encouraged him to try Come-Unity or Thump.  He knew about both parties, 
'cause he focuses his driving on EDM events.  Hope he decides to be venture 
in some night.  And, sweet guy, he knocks $5.00 off my fare when we get to 
my home.

I'm happy to hear AEC went off well, but then what else would one expect 
from the SFplanners group:)  Hope to dance with you all under the moon or 
shooting stars next time.

Love,

Apollo

     Wow!!! Soooo Much Fun!!  OK, I gotta vent real quick before I get to
the goodies!  I think it was lame that more than 1/2 the lil' e-tard chicas
there lastnight were tryin' to be all these sexy lil' Raver things!  LoL
They were the ones who couldn't dance anyway!  So Ha!  Oh gosh, & they were
so rude to all bumping into people like everywhere!  I actually tripped one
of them 'cause she really started to piss me off!  I mean, the girls who
were dressed tomboy style were the Dope ones!  Oh yeah, & they knew how to
dance!

     OK, But yeah, the party kicked mondo Ass!!!  It a while to get into the
vibe 'cause it was jus' well, I guess I'm totally a Bay Raver or something
or maybe it's been a while since I been to a candy party!!  Oh yeah, mondo
candy population made me feel so under dressed!!!  LoL  But it was fun!

     OK, Music Rocked!!!  I mean, yeah, there was a Trance room, but I jus'
couldn't stay away from the Happy Hardcore Room!  It was Bad Ass!!  I got
there around 9 something when Mr. Clean was on the decks & yeah, it was a
good warm up to get into the mood of the party!

     I mean, another upsetting factor of this party was well, all the etards
& puddles everywhere!!!  I mean, seriously, it was so hard to find other
sober people there, but there were alota sober people there!!  OK yeah, but
I'm not gonna lie either, I had a ball bein' a baby sitter!!  There was this
1 kid, this lil' who came up to me, totally rollin', when I was sitting down
in the smoking area & I jus gave him a hug!  Then I gave him a massage & his
gf went to check on her friend who was throwing up in the bathroom.  So I
stayed w/ "Candyman" for a while & made sure he drank his water!

     OK, back to DJs!  I guess it was DJ Dummy & MC Verbal in the main room
when all this Hardcore was playing & Wow, So Dope!  It was Groovy 'cause the
MC would tell the crowd to sing along to the HHC Anthems which we did!!
Then Anthony Madd who spun this really Sick!  Aryck, he played that song w/
the hella long intro & that dude who sings you said who sounds like me when
I sing!  He also spun hella records you have!  Ofcourse it was totally Dope
dancin' to Ron D Core spin!!  Hello 2Day, he started his set w/ Trance &
progressively got faster!!  It was Dope 'cause he ended his set playin' this
Dope Ass Gaber songer that would slow  down like in parts of the song &
Simon Apex played these totally sweet chords on his KORG (Oh man, KORG=)!!
It was Dope!!

     Then another one of my Favorite parts was When Simon Apex & these other
Dudes did Live PA!!!  Oh my gosh, new tracks: Drowning, Pergatory, & this
other one, totally fuckin' Awesome songs!!!  It was Dope hearin' the
"Destiny" remix live!  The whole Live PA set was sick!

     Yeah, I mean, all the DJs So Totally Rocked!  I had so much fun!!  It
sucked how they had to keep changing rooms for the music every set!  I
barely danced in the smaller room & kicked it in the smoking area when that
happen!  Oh gosh, so I did become like part of this puddle of etards & it
was fun!!  I was hella kickin'n it w/ Ash & Wolverine!!  OK, yeah, Candy
names in Full effect!  I met Tricks, Sunshine, Bubbles, Budda, Star, Gumby,
Light, I dunno, so many Candy Kids w/ funny names!!  It was Cute!  But yeah,
hella kicked it w/ Ash & CandyMan!

     I did happen to see 4 Cats from the Dublin Crew: Devo, Anthony, James,
& Homeboy I forget his name!  It was Dope Hangin' out w/ them!!

     So yeah, I was there also to kick it w/ Dragnfly!  She got on the decks
& started her lil' hard NRG set!  I hella yelled out loud "FUCK THE DJ" &
hella people started yelling after me!  Then she looked @ me & like took off
her button shirt & she was wearin' her "Fuck The DJ" shirt & everyone
started yellin' somemore!!!  LoL....It was Fun!!  OK, yeah, then she was
probably into her like 3-4 song when the music got shut down!  It was Hella
sad!  It turns out that the party was suppose to go on 'til 3AM & that's
what the contracted stated as well!  But the venue owner was an asshole
about things & came up w/ some lame excuse that the liquoe liscense for his
place ends at 2 and all festivities have to stop at that time!!!  Bullshit!!
It was Lame!

     Apparently, there was an afterparty @ another venue, but that got shut
down as well!  Oh Well!

     But after we left, it was Bubbles, Brian, Dragnfly, Terri, & I & we
were kicki'n it @ the gas station!!  LoL...it was hella funny 'cause that's
where like alota people showed up after leaving the venue!  It was Groovy
hangin' out w/ Dina & everyone at the gas station 'cause people were all
comin' up to our group & takin' pictures!!  It was Cute!!  LoL

     Afterwards, HUng out @ Dina's & Terri's place w/ Bubbles & Brian!  It
was fun jus' talkin' for hours!!

     But yeah, it was a Groovy night!  I mean, another reason I guess I had
a hard time getting into the vibe was 'cause I mean, the night B4, I was
like @ this totally Dope Underground!  I dunno, but it was Fun!!  I do have
a lil' guilt for not goin' to OW & kickin' it w/ Forest & everyone!  I'm
glad U had fun Damien!!  Ya know, come to think of it, I really hope I get a
chance to take some of those Sac Kids to a Real Rave!  It'd probably be
weird for them, but hmmm.  Ok, Im talkin' outta my ass again!!  Oh Wow, I
wonder how ORGY went lastnight?

  To A nonymous:
 I respectfully disagree that my question that I posed to the list was naive. 
Enough said about that.
  IM rephrasing the question as, " Zero tolerance or harm reduction, which 
should the scene embrace and why?" There seems to be two camps in the rave 
scene around the drug issue, one which believes drugs are evil and fucking up 
our scene, and another that believes drugs are not the problem per-se, but of 
a few who abuse them. The former tends to advocate a zero tolerance policy 
and would like to have drug free parties and would rather boot out all the 
etards and say good riddance to them, while the latter believes that not all 
people who do drugs are irresponsible, that drugs are in the rave scene 
whether we like it or not and advocates a harm reduction approach to drug 
usage at raves.
 I have tried to phrase all my questions and their subject matter to be as 
neutral as possible, presenting both sides for civilized discussion and 
critique, representing and respecting all answers and opinions on each 
question. So far, everyone has been pretty cool. Thanks! 
 I have deliberately kept my personal views out and not bla bla bla on any of 
the questions because I didn't want to have people get side tracked on what 
Bodhi thinks, potentially provoking flame posts rather than having these 
questions and their subject matter intelligently and respectfully answered 
and discussed.
 Our scene is going through a lot of changes. New and different people are 
partying. Some are bringing positive attributes to the scene and some seem to 
be pulling the scene down, and we often differ on who plays which role. But 
as a scene we will never evolve if we don't discuss all the problems and 
issues about our scene in a "PLUR'y" way. I believe from collectively 
discussing our issues and problems, solutions will come forth and people will 
be inspired to step up to the plate and help implement solutions. It's one 
thing to bitch and flame each other, it's another to talk, listen, disagree, 
and in all our talking, listening, disagreeing find the truth some where in 
the middle way. I hope with my questions IM bringing us there.
 Peace, love and hugs! Bodhi ^ _ ^

alongside DJ giants such as Sasha, Dave Seaman, Carl Cox and Lee Burridge. =20
In the past few years, Troy has nationally released two mixed CD's "Global=20

much passion, dedication, and respect for the raw sound of music as Brian.=20
His obvious love for the music transcends petty attempts at fame and fortune=

beginning in 1998 - when compared to those of his influences like Danny=20
Tenaglia, Kevin Yost, Eric Morillo and Timo Maas, it is nevertheless=20
impressive. Striving to find an artistic outlet in his life, Brian was=20
introduced to turntables.  He began a dedicated and relentless relationship=20
that allowed his perfectionist persona to shine brightly amidst music he=20
loved. His beginnings were humble, playing small house parties and clubs,=20
until he began playing larger parties with such names as Chris Liebing,=20
Robert Miles, Terry Mullan and Pablo Gargano. His versatile music style give=
s=20
him the opportunity to experiment with different sounds and genres of=20
electronic music. His eclectic blend of house, progressive house, and techno=
=20
gives his music a dark sensuality with a heart-pounding rhythm - so=20
infectious that audiences cannot help but dance. Brian=E2=80=99s style break=
s=20
boundaries of defined lines as he offers a sexy, hard-hitting beat coupled=20
with daring vocals.  His constant stream of in-your-face records will keep=20
you going all night long. This is one DJ you cannot afford to miss. His=20
beautiful sense of timing, maturity, and ability to adapt to his=20
surroundings, makes Brian one of the most promising talents to hit the scene=

water all this dirt, & play in the mud!!!  I dunno why I'm telling you
all this, but I wonder if anyone else has this urge?  Has anyone done
this lately?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR ARG stupid fucking internet marketing companies.

I just thought I'd help out the other people in my boat, I been getting like 2
dozen emails a week from random companies I didn't even join to, so I
unsubscribed from a few with this as the explanation on their un-sub page..

"this is fucking stupid. I signed up to something else snd got this also.  I
don't have a fucking job, get a clue internet marketing companies, you want me
to spend money I don't have but none of you will hire my overqualified ass to
make money to spend in the first place?  FUCK OFF."

Anyone out there wanna give a NT/unix/network admin/technician a job doing
anything?  Fuck I'll even work helpdesk at this point, I have the skills and
can prove it in an interview, I just need a JOB.

this whole working for a living thing sucks, too bad I don't have the means to
record a demo, I wanna make money doing what I love, not what I know how to do,
just like I want a girl to love for for what I am, not what I can be.

Anyone know where I can be loved and paid for what I am?  I'd move there in a
second.  I mean shit, I've shown the girl I love that I'd do anything in the
world for her, and she stays with her current guy she's known for maybe 1 month
because "it could be good".  Was it really THAT bad?  fuck.

                                                     Forever longing,
                                                                  Me.

Subject: [sfraves] Pink Floyd Remixes

About a year ago an R Steven Mills posted a link to some remixes of Floyd's 
Dark Side of the Moon, as well as a couple other Floyd remixes. That link 
(http://www.cobaltgroup.com/~randy/pf/) isn't valid anymore. Does anyone 
know someplace else these remixes can be found? Thanks.

Subject: [sfraves] "Club Drugs" No Longer Just At Raves

--=====================_2460931==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

USA Today reports "club drugs" like E are mainstream, and may be found at 
places like ice skating rinks.  Mainly in the suburbs.  What now?  Will ice 
skates be classified as drug paraphenalia by the ever vigilant DEA?  Should 
parents move their children from the suburbs?

The problem has NEVER been music and dance.  The problem is that people 
always have and will use various drugs.  The solution is to treat addictive 
disease and institute harm reduction and education programs.

Popular 'club drugs' overflow rave scene, enter mainstream Ecstasy, GHB, 
ketamine can be found in USA's schools and neighborhoods

Club drugs, popular for years at all-night rave parties, are moving 
steadily mainstream, and kids say the drugs, particularly Ecstasy, are easy 
to get in schools and neighborhoods.

Experts cite the emerging club-drug scene as one of the two key changes -- 
the other being an increasing supply of exceptionally pure heroin -- in the 
''otherwise stable'' illicit drug landscape since 1999.

''Availability of club drugs has increased dramatically across the nation, 
especially for Ecstasy, which has increased in nearly every city,'' 
according to Pulse Check, the twice-yearly drug abuse trend report from the 
White House Office on National Drug Control Policy.

Pulse Check reports that the use of club drugs, which include Ecstasy, 
ketamine and GHB, has emerged or intensified over the past year in 17 
cities: Boston; Chicago; Columbia, S.C.; Denver; Detroit; El Paso; 
Honolulu; Los Angeles; Memphis; Miami; New Orleans; New York; Philadelphia; 
Portland, Maine; Seattle; Sioux Falls, S.D.; and Washington, D.C.

''The data are clear that it's moved out of the club scene,'' says Alan 
Leshner, executive director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in 
Bethesda, Md. ''We are now seeing the drugs used by everybody. Parents 
can't just say, 'My kid doesn't go to clubs, so I don't need to worry about 
it.' ''

Law enforcement authorities in Miami say that club drugs are ''everywhere, 
even at ice skating rinks,'' Pulse Check reports. In New York, Long Island 
youths are buying the drugs from the Internet and from dealers at local 
malls. In Seattle and Billings, Mont., the drugs are sold on high school 
and college campuses, police say.

Last year, more than 1.4 million people ages 18 to 25 reported taking 
Ecstasy at least once, the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found. 
Among students surveyed in 2000, 8.2% of 12th-graders, 5.4% of 10th-graders 
and 3.1% of eighth-graders say they used Ecstasy in the past year.

''That means 165,000 eighth-graders, kids who are 13 and 14 years old, are 
experimenting with their own brains,'' Leshner says.

Ecstasy, by far the most popular of the club drugs, produces both stimulant 
and psychedelic effects, and users often dance all night. Ketamine, an 
anesthetic used mostly on animals, is a disassociative drug that produces 
hallucinations. GHB is a tasteless, odorless depressant that sedates and 
intoxicates users and may be used to come down from Ecstasy.

GHB also has been used by rapists to subdue their victims
.
Club-drug users and sellers, Pulse Check says, tend to be ''young, white, 
middle-class males and females'' who use the drugs in combination with 
other drugs, such as hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, 
methamphetamine and prescription drugs. Teens or college-age students may 
gather to ''trail mix'' at a potluck drug party where various drugs are 
pooled and shared.

Most club-drug activity occurs in the suburbs, the report says.

''Ecstasy user and seller groups are also expanding to include more blacks 
and Hispanics, and use and sales settings continue to expand from 
exclusively nightclubs and raves to high schools, streets and open 
venues,'' the report says.
The use of Ecstasy and other club drugs has spawned an entire culture and 
lingo. An Ecstasy high is called ''rolling.'' Ecstasy users become 
bewitched by flashing lights and music with a steady bass beat. Teens may 
attend all-night rave parties featuring techno music and light shows that 
cater to an Ecstasy user's heightened sensitivities to light, sound and touch.

To capitalize on their heightened senses, partiers wave light sticks, tape 
flashing ''belly lights'' to their navels or wear luminescent, flickering 
bracelets called Toobies. Users may wear fuzzy sweaters or other soft 
fabrics. Some Ecstasy users coat surgical masks with vapor rubs for the 
cooling rush sensation.

Ecstasy also causes involuntary jaw clenching, so users suck on pacifiers 
and candy necklaces to alleviate the effects.
Abuse experts and law enforcement authorities say that as users get bored 
with Ecstasy alone, they are experimenting with dangerous drug 
combinations. Ecstasy users may snort a ''bump'' of ketamine to intensify 
the hallucinatory aspects of Ecstasy at the peak of a ''roll.'' As the 
Ecstasy wears off, users may drink a shot glass or capful of GHB to ease 
off Ecstasy's speed effects.

The Drug Abuse Warning Network, which tracks emergency-room visits in 21 
metropolitan areas, reported 4,969 emergency-room visits for GHB overdoses, 
4,511 visits for Ecstasy and 263 visits for ketamine in 2000.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: HJBC Resignation

I am sending this e-mail to announce my official resignation from the Horny 
Jail Bait Crew. I no longer wish to be affiliated with the crew for personal 
reasons.

Don't get me wrong...The past year and a half as a member has been a lot of 
fun and I still adore the remaining HJBC members. However, I've been doing 
some thinking and I really feel like it's time for me to move on.

So, to all you sexy teen girlies out there, contact your local HJBC member 
and maybe you'll get initiated. Someone needs to fill my position.

Thank you Becca, Christle, Alida, Lydia, and sometimes Will. Have lots of 
good ol' fashioned trampy fun without me. Sorry :(

Love,

Veronica La Rosa

I guess I'm on the latter camp.. Here's why.. Even if you take the zero 
tolerance approach, it is impossible to enforce.  There will be drug users 
among the law enforcement and the dancers then, as there is now, if not 
more.  If you'd like a social example, I think Alcohol Prohibition fits 
quite well.  The gov't went balls out, tracking down bandits and home 
distillers, and it still didn't work.  There's too many people, too many 
smart people that know how to fool less - smart people.. and too many 
people believing in a common cause, that banded together.

I think Usa had a mud wrestling party at her house a couple weeks ago. You 
guys should get together and throw another one. It sounds like fun.

Dunno about you, but I had a blast!  The venue was exactly the right size
and the talent was awesome!  I loved hearing everyone scream for Morgan.  I
don't remember anyone sitting on the dance floor.  I really appreciated the
free water after the bar closed.  I can't think of anything I didn't like
about that party.

Subject: [sfraves] 2 guns and a machete

O.k. i heard about this some time ago, but didn't want
to post it until it could be confirmed but apearntly
they were talking about it on the radio last week so i
guess it would be o.k. to fill you in a little.
Jest-One i know you already know about this, and yes
they guy (who would like to remain nameless) said it
was o.k. i post it.

o.k. so some one from coolworld was having a dinner
party on Mon. Aug 13th.  Two guys who where
aquaintances of Coolworld show up.  After an hour or
so they leave, only to return 30 min. later.  One has
a machete and they both have guns.  They used duct
tape to tie up a lady and told two youngs kids to go
hide under a bed.  Then they proceed to tear apart the
house to search for the safe that holds the money from
Cyberfest.  One of the guys sets down his gun while
searching.  The guy from coolworld picks it up killing
one guy.  The guy with the machete then hacks away at
him severely injuring him.  Then the guy with the gun
shoots and kills the guy with the machete.

O.k. so if you all heard this already then sorry for
the spam.  but wow can you believe that.

Support your local Renegade!!!

Is this the same people/event that was in the Chronicle about a week ago? 
Looks like it... some guys leaving, coming back to some SF loft, tying 
people up, looking for a safe, "concert promoter", robber got shot, etc.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Free Music vs. Paid CDs


I guess this got started because of the flap over someone possibly useing
tracks without paying the producers.  Honestly, tho, when the flamewar gets
about three or four layers of ">"s deep, I lose track.

But John (oh no... ANTOHER John), said something here that bugged me, and I
figures I'd throw in my $.02 as a music consumer, rathat than a DJ or anything.
 And a big fan of music I am... I can't even keep my entire CD collection at
home, it would take up so much space.

I would be perfectly willing to pay $15 for a CD...  *IF* that $15 were going
to the ARTIST.  But that's not the case, if you sign to a record label.  Bands
on labels are damn LUCKY if they get .50 on each CD that sells for $15. 
Courtnet love breaks down the math quite well:

http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/index.html

And I will, under *NO* circumstance, put so much as a penny into the coffers of
the RIAA/metallica....  THOSE are the people who see to it that artises only
see a miniscule fraction of their CD sales.  THOSE are the people who have
declared war on my profession.  They have declared war on my generation and my
peers.  And if there is anything I can do to aid in their destruction, I will
not hesitate to do so.

And in the meantime, I refuse to support them.  They have, either foolishly or
usefully, provided a list of their minions:

http://www.riaa.org/About-Members-1.cfm

I take a hardcopy of that list with me whenever I go music shopping.  And if a
CD I want is put out by those people, I do without until its for sale used from
Ameoba, or the other local stores.  That, or I simply napster it and use a CD-R
until such time as I find a used copy.  Or if it's a band, I'll buy it new at
their merchandise table next time I see them live.

*MY* life is made a bit easier in that regard, as most of the music *I* buy
(punk, ska, and EDM  (woohoo, somebody FINALLY gave me an alternative to
"electronica"!!!), tends to be put out by people who think the way I do, and
avoid RIAA/metallica labels themselves, instead going the DIY route or useing
independent labels.

(When you buy USED CDs, the RIAA/metallica doesn't see a penny.  A number of
years ago they used garth brooks as a stooge to try to destroy the legal
principle of "first sale", much like they are useing lars & co. for their
assault on "fair use" rights now.  Also, when a band sells you stuff (even a CD
produced inder a label) at their live shows, the money goes directly to the
band as well).

Yes.... that $2 vinyl sticker you buy from the band at a concert puts more
money in their pocket than if you buy any five of their albums NEW at the
Virgin Megastore.

Another good reason to buy USED CDs is that the profit margin is higher for the
store.  So when you do so, you are supporting the local, independent stores
like Ameoba and Rasputin against the corporate megaliths.

Okay, that's all speaking as a consumer.  I know nothing of performance rights.
 But I have it on reasonably good authiority that BMI/ASCAP are just as
malignant as the RIAA/metallica.  In fact, that's why I can't listen, over the
'net, to one of my favorite talk radio stations from back in Florida.  One or
the other has raised a big stink and is blocking internet broadcasts of a show
I don't even listen to for music, but for the personalities of the hosts.

I'm not saying the IP rights need to be totally scrapped.  Obviously the ARTIST
needs to be compensated for his work in some way.  But I DO firmlt beleive that
the current system has been hopelessly corrupted, at the expense of both the
artist AND the consumer, and it needs to be torn down by whatever means
necessary.


cya,
john

Bodhi, I hope you didn't take offense. I respect you and I like the
questions you have been posing to us. I do, however, prefer your rephrased
question in this instance.

>   IM rephrasing the question as, " Zero tolerance or harm reduction, which

I believe that harm reduction is the way to go with the drug issue in every
case, not just where the rave scene is concerned.

On one hand, a zero tolerance policy amounts to burying your head in the
sand. Drug use continues whether it is "tolerated" or not. On the other, it
compounds the problem.

People that prefer a zero tolerance "solution" generally make the assumption
that there is no such thing as responsible drug use. There is a risk
associated with taking drugs. Some argue that this risk makes taking drugs
an inherently irresponsible thing to do. I deny that. If that were the case,
skydiving couldn't be done responsibly because there is always a risk
involved. The fact is that, that risk can be reduced, and reducing the risk
is exactly what a responsible skydiver or drug user does. A zero tolerance
policy does nothing but make it harder to reduce that risk.

If skydiving were illegal, some people would still jump, only they'd be
jumping with chutes manufactured without regulated safety standards, new
skydivers would learn from people without verifiable credentials, and
skydivers who were caught would find their lives ruined by imprisonment and
legal bills. That's fairly analogous to the current state of recreational
drug use. Thankfully, there are some organizations like Dancesafe that try
to provide education and services to help drug users reduce their risk. A
zero tolerance policy would make it harder or impossible for such
organizations to work effectively. But drug use would continue just the
same.

Allow me one more analogy.

Imagine a long straight stretch of highway where the speed limit is 55 but
where the average speed is actually 65. You have two choices. Enforce the
speed limit or change it. If you enforce it, you can only enforce it
partially because you don't have the resources to stop every car that is
going over 55. Furthermore, the resources that you sink into enforcing the
speed on the highway can't be used elsewhere to enforce the speed on other
roads. The unreasonable hope is that people will slow down out of fear of
being ticketed. The more likely outcome is that, over time, people will
learn to avoid the highway, take more circuitous routes on perhaps more
dangerous roads, and drive even faster so that they can get from point A to
point B in the same amount of time it would take driving on the highway at
65. The point I'm trying to make is that policy needs to take into account
the desires of the people. If the people want to do drugs or drive 65, they
should be allowed. The best we can do is make it safer for them do indulge
themselves.

Maybe you missed the part of my email where I said that I didn't support the
RIAA either, but rather the independant labels which I know contribute
further to the artist(s) and the music rather than their own pockets.

I agree whole heartedly that the RIAA is an evil entity. I spend more money
on CDs direct from artists websites or the used bins rather than the main
record outlets for just that reason.

Subject: [sfraves] beautiful hair!!!!!! :) nrr 

so, on the fashion front, for the gals who love to
glam!!!! i finished my hair, sort of...i mentioned
that i 
bought a box of hair color..i put it on my hair last
night, and while it does not match the box, my hair
does
look different than it did before. you know how when
you first put the color on, and it is super vivrant
for a 
couple of weeks? that's what it is like now, so i am
not completely comfortable with it, but nonetheless,
it is 
rather interesting...my hair is now currently a shade
of color very similar to the color my hair was when i
was 
around eight years old. not what i had planned, but
not unattractive. when i go out to dance, i will get
some nice 
compliments from my friends, but also, in my mind, i
think that since i have eight year old hair along with
my 
current face, i look rather like a knome..sp?...little
science fiction/ fantasy type character...ha! it's all
GGGGGGOOOOOODDD. also, there are a whole lot of people
who 
i am glad never got a chance to meet my grandmother.
what a bunch of rude asses. :)

Subject: [sfraves] break fiends alike::delectation

There are many paths to choose from, some like it
smooth and easy, uninterupted with a nice flow.  Some
like it chopped up, fucked with, pitched up, pitched
down, funked out, and rewound.  I guess it depends on
the person, and the mood, and well, the path they
choose.

Break fiends alike, sunday at Golden Gate park,
Delectation, so gosh darn delectable!  I got there
late and was sad I missed the 'ardcore :( , big ups to
the djs I did get to hear, Megatron, Mikey J (keep on
dancin'), and Lex for keeping the path "stepable".

It was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nice
seeing my SF junglists, I miss you!!!

Thanks for a different kinda day party!

Love,
Jess

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: Free Music vs. Paid CDs

Its funny that you mention Broadcast Radio vs Net Radio. My fauther and I
recently had a huge ordeal of a time when i was trying to help him get the
small radio station he is a program director at on the Net. So many of the
bay areas radio stations have been forced off the air because of stringent
coppyright law. Two shining examples of Legit Net Radio and Broadcast Radio
stations are

KCSM 91.1 www.kcsm.org
The Light   1190 www.gospel1190.com

I watched as they strugled threw the licensing process (KCSM less first hand
and more story time at the dinner table). Record companies make it sooooo
dificult to do things the right way I think most folks around today just say
fuck it. Theres some interesting dialog on this at www.MP3 . I allways found
the neuances of coppyright law to be extreemly funny because in the end
every one has been minipulated by everyone else and he with the most lawyers
tends to win. K back into my cave.

and jamie my pinkey still really hurts itsa was bottles full of fun.

Dancin for SMILES =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "Club Drugs" No Longer Just At Raves

Hmm.. I don't see why they keep referring it to as the club drug. 

Dancing all night? I've taken it and floored all night.

Pacifiers? I don't grind my teeth anymore.. I just keep them open.

Primarily white? I guess everywhere else besides California.

Pot luck party? What the hell.. news to me. GHB? I don't know anyone that does it.

i whole-heartedly appreciate you posting this.  as

see, here's where the issue actually started - me, as
an independent label, just finished a compilation CD
of underground and unsigned EDM artists from the
SoCal-Raves list.  i advertised here that it is now
available.  this was quickly rebuked and i was told by
more than one person that i should be giving the CDs
away for free, or better yet, just scrub the whole run
that i've done, knock down the sound quality of the
mastering that i paid for and put the tracks online as
mp3s to be downloaded for free.

see, i gathered a group of artists, we went the DIY
route and even used fellow scenesters for all aspects
of production, making sure everyone was fairly
compensated every step of the way.  but this still
wasn't acceptable, at least here on SFR.  :/

Absolutely, try  (408) 277-4244. Just tell 'em you want to purchase a 
fake id and he'll hook you up!

That's where I got mine. Although, mine says I'm over 65, cuz I 
wanted to get in on those senior citizen discounts ;-)

"many said it couldn't be done... they said a techno weekly could never
survive in SF.  but Clairity's bravery, steadfastness (and a bit of
good ol' fashioned stubbornness) has kept Impulse goin and growin.  its
grown to be a quite warm and friendly place.  Old schoolers and tek
heads siping cocktails and pints chatting and bouncin to cold hard true
techno.

anyhow, tonight is the one year anniversary and all you who have DJ'ed
or partied at Impulse over the last year come out and celebrate!"

DJs for the night:

John Williams
Clarity
Raf-one
Logery

9:30pm-2am, An Sibin @ the corner of Sutter & Polk, $3.


This is a great techno club so come out and support!!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] MUD

No... I can't say I have ever really done that with a hose in the
garden, although my family has a cabin in Washington and it is on a bay.
When the tide is out, which is most of the day, it is just miles and
miles of mud!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is gross... but soo much fun! I used to
spend hours out there slippin' and slidin' and I would come back covered
in mud. It was great!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ looking for work

What is Hi-energy??

are you talking about stuff like Freestyle like Stevie B.,Johnny O,Cynthia.. 
etc??

**Starts Singing** Your my dream girl by Johnny O and Cyhnthia

aww memories of the late 80's early 90's

if you play NRG join the club of about a bizzilion other bay area DJ's that 
play that same type of music.. NOTE: for new Aspiring DJ's try and pick a 
sound that is a lil different like the NRG pioneers did a few years back 
Forge your own sound Don't mimic.. Cause the bottom line is you will never 
be a Morgan,Kem Kidd etc.. These guys have been playing that sound since the 
begining.. im not trying to diss on NRG or any new Jocks just seems that 
every "Up and comer" is playing Ultra Melodic Girl trance or NRG..


Think Different (er that is not a MAC plug ;)   )

I love the fact that this subject has come up again,
its amazing how that happens on this list :)

Yes, I was a little hair bear listening to hi-energy
mix tapes and singing Lil Susie songs.

And you just named my all time favorite song, dream
boy/dreamgirl, ahhh, what a duet.  Just bringing back
memories...hehe, does anyone remember Dino, I just
found the 12" of summergirls unopened at my aunts
house, she had no problem giving it to me....ahhh, one
persons trash is another girls treasure =D

Macadio!  I'm shocked!

You of all people should know better than to call light/melodic/anthem
trance "Girl Trance". (Also not acceptable, "pussy trance") ;)

Let's check the Girl Trance roster:  Dragn'fly, Icon, DRC, DJ D, Madame
Buddafly, Spacegirl...

Sorry, no fluff here.

What I think he ment by "girl trance" is not actually
trance that girls play, but trance that guys play in
order to GET girls....so I guess that also explains
"pussy trance"....right Mac-daddy-O??? hehe.

jokin,
Jess

Subject: RE: [sfraves] DJ looking for work

I do something different. Besides just using my tables, I also use my
high powered computer to help combine some custom mixes I've made and
other mp3's I can't find on vinyl into my set, therefore allowing me to
play for a good hour or two without sounding the same.

And what makes you think I want to be like other DJ's who have already
proven themselves? That would infer that I have no originality or
creativity. I want to do something different and that's what I'm
shooting for.

What is Hi-energy??

are you talking about stuff like Freestyle like Stevie B.,Johnny
O,Cynthia.. 
etc??

**Starts Singing** Your my dream girl by Johnny O and Cyhnthia

aww memories of the late 80's early 90's

if you play NRG join the club of about a bizzilion other bay area DJ's
that 
play that same type of music.. NOTE: for new Aspiring DJ's try and pick
a 
sound that is a lil different like the NRG pioneers did a few years back

Forge your own sound Don't mimic.. Cause the bottom line is you will
never 
be a Morgan,Kem Kidd etc.. These guys have been playing that sound since
the 
begining.. im not trying to diss on NRG or any new Jocks just seems that

every "Up and comer" is playing Ultra Melodic Girl trance or NRG..

Subject: [sfraves] Thanks from Soulspun.


Delctation deserves a rewind.

That day was made great for us because of the people and the DJ's who
came out and had fun in GGP.  Thank you so much for your support. A big
thanks goes out to the Southbay crew, (Alex, Jessica, etc etc.)
Coming two hours from the south for our little ole' park party.

And we thank everyone who gave us support, like Eva and Push and
Half-Lite, Rashida, Dmarie, etc etc. Your dope! Your support has
made us push for another party before things get to cold in SFC.

All DJ sets are archived on the Soulspun website, mp3 format.
http://www.soulspun.org/delectation-8-26/djsets/index.html

Stareyez did an awesome 'ardkore set that is worth the listening.
All DJ's did uber sexy sets, to be honest.

Thanks for the support and love.

Subject: [sfraves] DJ looking for work (Freestylie)

aww damn... As a matter of fact on Sat nights when your getting ready to go 
out if you want to hear some decent freestyle listen to 90.5 I think at 10PM 
they play all the old school Hi-energy and play requests too. I thought I 
could stump them with requesting Diamond Girl the Orig track but they busted 
that and Spanish Fly's "Treasure of my heart"

ok my top ten for freestyle:

Stevie B.    -Spring Love

Well all I know is what my high powered computer is :) I'm sure lots of
other people have more advanced machines, but to give you an example, my
music box has

800mhz AMD Thunderbird
265MB Memory
GeForce 2 MX
Sound Blaster Live! MP3+ 5.1
8x CD-R
10x DVD-ROM

Built it from the ground up to amaze me and entertain me with digital
audio and video and to help me with my mixes and original compositions.
:) Its been a faithful machine from the start.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] DJ looking for work

Yeah, no shit. I picked up this stuff a couple years back when I started 
practicing, and now everyone's on it. I do think my sound is a bit different 
from what's generally thought of as "UK-HardHouse/NRG", but UK-HH/NRG is the 
closest thing, so the only way to describe it. I dunno... maybe my stuff 
really is the same as all the others (wouldn't THAT be depressing?!), but I 
hope not. My stuff is different from a lot of what I've heard, but I've 
heard a couple of my tracks out there. Grr.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: What is a high powered computer? was: DJ Looking for work

I can't resist.. I have few things to be proud of:

AMD 1.2 Ghz (no OC) Thunderbird
584 MB RAM
GeForce 256 (yes, a gen 1 card)
Sound Blaster X-Gamer 5.1
Level 1 RAID (UDMA)

plus the usual accessories:

flatbed scanner
scsi cd-r
zip drive
dolby digital / prologic speakers

I haven't made any recent upgrades (like a new video card) because I've 
been spending money on my truck.. hmm one expensive habit replaced by 
another.. THAT's why I don't have scrilla for food..

Subject: [sfraves] Kharma catches up with Ex SF promoter

So here's some dirt...

Im sure some of you may remember the parties back in 91-94 thrown by a
promoter named Roland?    He was partners with Claxton in the Magic
Kingdom & Fantasia parties (at thunder bay), and also did (in
conjunction with Myself & Haliam from Rave called Sharon) The "Love
American Style" Parties, and some UG's and a few clubs at the Truckadero
(Now the Glass Cat... yes it once was a Rave & After-hours venue).
Well he sprung out of SF in 95/96 (too hot) and went to Texas where he
continued throwing big events, and was started a lot of crap and was run
out of that scene ... but NOW Kharma has finally caught up to
Roland...   read on if you're interested.

Key witness who skipped out on D.A. is arrested
S.F. man was freed from jail in Foxglove conspiracy case

Jaxon Van Derbeken, Chronicle Staff Writer    Wednesday, August 22, 2001


San Francisco -- Authorities have caught up with the key witness in the
now-resolved Foxglove conspiracy case -- a San Francisco man who
embarrassed prosecutors by skipping out on a testimony deal that freed
him from jail.

Roland Dabai Tyler, 29, was picked up by agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration early yesterday at San Francisco International Airport as
he prepared to board a flight to Washington, D.C., with a bogus Irish
passport.

"The DEA received some information that he was going to get on the
plane, and they were waiting for him," said Lt. Jere Williams of the San
Francisco police sex crimes detail. The unit was involved because of a
pending Florida charge against Tyler for the attempted rape of a
91-year-old woman.

Tyler fled after making a deal with San Francisco prosecutors in March
1998 to testify in the Foxglove murder conspiracy case -- and has been
on the lam ever since. He was freed on $100,000 bail in exchange for his
agreement to testify in the then-pending case in which elderly men were
allegedly poisoned with digitalis -- derived from the foxglove plant --
for their money and property.

At the time, Tyler was already wanted for allegedly using a pipe to bash
a man's skull in Austin, Texas.

And on June 13, 1998, after fleeing San Francisco, police said Tyler
attacked the elderly woman at her trailer park in Hallandale, Fla.,
using a stun gun. He has been wanted in Florida for a no-bail warrant
for attempted sexual battery and false imprisonment, but the victim has
died, leaving the case in limbo.

Fred Gardner, spokesman for the district attorney's office, said Tyler
may face local charges of willful failure to appear. He could also be
forced to serve the balance of his agreed-to term under the conditions
of the original plea agreement. Some of the terms are still secret under
a judge's order.

He may also be sent to Florida or Texas to face prosecution for the
crimes he allegedly committed in those states.

Tyler's attorney, Stuart Hanlon, who brokered the deal that got him out
on bail, said that Tyler was to be given credit for the six months he
had served in jail. In addition, he would not serve additional jail time
for the charge of assault with great bodily injury in the Foxglove
conspiracy, and would be placed on five years' probation. He was ordered
to work or attend school full time and to testify truthfully in the
coming trial.

"I think the deal's gone, if he runs," Hanlon said. "The case is over. I
don't think they have anything against him here. They should just let
him go."

Tyler's testimony was considered very important because he was the only
one who claimed to actually have seen the two lead defendants, Angela
Bufford and George Lama, sprinkle poison-laced "magic salt" on the food
of elderly men.

Under a deal in March of last year, the two were given terms for elder
abuse and the murder case was dropped.

Prosecutors originally alleged that at least four elderly men were
bilked out of more than $1 million in cash, property and investments and
then slowly poisoned.

not that we don't need to do anything. . .


    but who calls "raves" raves anymore ? They're all concerts and dance
parties. All the raves are underground, so they could ban "raves" all they
want, and the underground would still be as illegal as it alwzays was. . .

not that we don't need to do anything. . .


    but who calls "raves" raves anymore ? They're all concerts and dance
parties. All the raves are underground, so they could ban "raves" all they
want, and the underground would still be as illegal as it alwzays was. . .

not really...


i would *love* to believe the idealized notion of the 'once it blows up, 
we'll just go back underground' theory..  unfortunately, i think it's a bit 
naive..


this isn't 1992.

cops know about parties.

they usually know where people throw parties (yes, even underground ones).

and what's worse - they have their own preconceived notions of what 
actually constitutes a "rave"

you can't just have an old skool warehouse break in anymore and expect it 
to happen.




plus, if legislation like what was passed in chicago is passed nationwide - 
it'd be VERY bad.   i don't care how down people are,  when there is the 
threat of having all their gear seized with thousands of dollars of fines 
on top of that..  no one is going to risk it.

My web/fileserver with 60gb of storage ready to be pumped out over FE is a

Yes, well one would hope they are experimenting with their brains in SOME 
fashion:)

I cracked up at that line too. It really sums up how America views its 
youth. Heaven forbid an adolescent actually explore his own capabilities and 
make decisions for himself! *gasp* Experimenting with their own brains? How 
dare they! That's for the media to do!

Hmmm... just for the sake of shining the light from another angle, here's my 
take. In truth I am very torn on the subject.

While I 100% support the harm reduction approach, I have to disagree with 
your statement above. I think *especially* where the rave scene is concerned 
a zero tolerance approach could actually be beneficial. Raves are being 
targeted specifically for having an attitude of open acceptance and even 
encouragement of drug use in ways of open trafficking and catering to a drug 
user's heightened senses. If we were to take a zero tolerance approach it 
would eliminate much of the criticism and scrutiny. For example, there is a 
fair amount of drug use at any other sort of music event (we all know that 
throughout history music and altered perceptions have gone together like 
PB&J). Do you see congress meeting to discuss a possible ban on *all* music 
events? No. The difference is that other music events don't seem to have 
such an open acceptance towards drug use.

Again, I am very torn. To have strict regulations such as a zero tolerance 
approach as opposed to harm reduction seems to conflict with much of what 
raving is all about- freedom, unconditional acceptance, and unity. A zero 
tolerance approach suggests a rejection of those who don't abide by the 
"rules," and that there is a certain criteria that must be met for you to be 
allowed to attend raves, therefore breaking apart the unity, freedom and 
acceptance. And if someone breaks the "rules," will we punish them? How will 
zero tolerance be enforced? What sort of positive stimulus could be given to 
the user in replace of a negative stimulus? After all, that's what we're 
about. Positivity.

One might suggest a positive retribution would be education in harm 
reduction. But then we've come around full circle to the age old question, 
which came first, the chicken or the egg?

My point is that if we were to display a zero tolerance attitude it may not 
necessarily result in a dramatic decrease is drug use (although that may be 
a positive side effect), but we would be seen as working alongside the 
government, rather than against them. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. 
Meanwhile we may be allowed what they see as a privilege and what we see as 
a right, to dance all night, and still have the opportunity for education in 
harm reduction with booths such as Dance Safe. It's a win-win situation in 
some aspects.

Subject: [sfraves] AEC drawingsRe: [sfraves] -Recovery- AEC/Otherworld

I just wanted to apologize to Aryck over the list and explain that my 
intentions of my post were not that of malice, but of playfulness. I't hard 
to come across correctly through e-mail. All of you were unable to hear my 
silly giggles. The post was meant to explain why there was no drawing space 
available, not as an attack on Aryck. By the time I got to the space I was 
too involved in other things to start where Aryck left off. And Sarilion- 
many people over the age of five still enjoy drawing. There was no one 
holding a gun to your head saying you had to draw a picture! : ) It was just 
a suggestion to involve people in the party making process.  I actually had 
several people approach me asking where to hang their pictures.

The scary thing about this news is that Mr. Graham is the same motherfucker
who introduced the law back in 1985 which put MDMA on the list of Schedule =
1
narcotics in the first place.  He is the reason that this is such an
UNDERGROUND phenomenom. Ironically, without his hard work, ecstsasy might
still be legal, institutionalized and, quite possibly, NOT a key factor for
the youth revolution that unfolded in the wake of his efforts.  Kharma is
such a bitch, ain't it?

Has his control helped one bit?  Nope...  the harder he works at saving us
from ourselves, the more we realize it is worth fighting him and his
dillusionary collegues. And, look at the list of so called liberal,
babyboomer rock n rollers that are signed on to help. Di d they not learn
anything from the 60's?  Like I need to believe a goddamn thing that anyone
named Clinton has to say.

Whatever.  My bet is...  a decade from now, Graham will still be fighting
this issue and the numbers of MDMA supporters will have risen by another
%10,000, as they seem to have since he first went on this ludicrous campaig=
n
almost 20 years ago.  Shame on him.  He needs to watch the movie 'Traffic'
so he can see his honky ass in the mirror for what he is.... part of the
problem, not the solution.

Subject: [sfraves] new music

all- 

here is the list of new stuff that came out monday that i did real audio
clips for.
*************************************
this is not a request to buy anything :-)
*************************************
this is just my attempt to share information that i am lucky enough to be
furnished with and think everyone else deserves a chance to see and hear it
too.

the audio clips are at
    http://alienrecords.net
if you want to hear anything on the list.

there are many more things that came out hip hop, drum and bass and
otherwise that i didn't list because i don't want to hog list space, but
join our mailing list or email grant@virtualmediahost.com and i will send
you a full list of whatever is coming out.



thanks as always-

hey all!

one of our roomates is leaving us unexpectedly and we're trying to fill up
the room ASAP so he doesnt have to keep paying when hes not actually living
here. all three of us who are staying are cal students, but we're not really
looking for just cal students. we're in downtown berkeley on hearst, between
shattuck and milvia, close to bart and busses. :) there are 4 bedrooms so
youll get your own room, and a door leading out to the balcony as well as a
skylight in your room. the place is pretty roomy, but there is only one
bathroom. also, donkey, the cat, lives with us so youd have to be okay with
cats. the rent is $710 and the total move in cost is first and last months
rent plus a $100 deposit. we pay for pg&e and cable, the landlord takes care
of water and garbage. theres no parking, but the street parking around here
isnt too bad.

uhm...thats all i can think of. :) email me or call me on my cell phone
(510-384-5246) if youre interested in seeing the house and stuff.

oh yah...the house is available sept. 1.

take care!

Just a slight correction... Mark Farina Will NOT BE at Nocturnal Wonderland, He
canceled on the event (to far I guess?)    He is Contracted and confirmed
EXCLUSIVELY for Megga-Buzz.    Have Fun and be safe no matter where you end up
going this weekend.

Hahahaha too far? What a loser. Who would want to see a DJ perform that
wasnt willing to play an event just because its a few hours farther away?
They obviously arent in it for the scene. You don't see all those UK DJs
cancelling (too far? It's an entirely different fucking continent!!) So, I'd
rather go to Nocturnal Wonderland because all the DJs there will have been
willing to go to extra distance to give a great performance!!!

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

Keep in mind that this is Vlad's guess for Mark Farinas cancellation, he
didn't say this was *the* reason, just offering his speculation.

As in, "He canceled on the event (to far I guess?)"

So taking all your reasons into consideration, that guess might not be
right, but please don't jump to conclusions that that is the only reason
why he cancelled before you start trashing him. This could save a lot of
threads....

Hahahaha too far? What a loser. Who would want to see a DJ perform that
wasnt willing to play an event just because its a few hours farther
away? They obviously arent in it for the scene. You don't see all those
UK DJs cancelling (too far? It's an entirely different fucking
continent!!) So, I'd rather go to Nocturnal Wonderland because all the
DJs there will have been willing to go to extra distance to give a great
performance!!!

Last message you got from me was asking about how much a paid DJ gig is.
Well, in my research, I found an a great list.
I know about an amazing paid gigs list available to you: 
There is work in : SF, USA, UK, Canada and a few OZ, NZ, Europe 

"round up" is a mailing list where of a couple of hundred or more 
paid gigs in arts and entertainment to you over 5 week days. 
Subscription is $25 per year. Many other services like this charge $25 
per month and don't send as many gigs out as "round up". 

A few categories of gigs and crew we cater to: 
Art 
Acting, Extras and Voice 
Theater and Events 
Film TV Video Crew 
Costume and Wardrobe 
Dance 
Modeling 
Performance Artists 
Entertainers and Performance Artists 
Production Crew 
Music 
Radio 
DJ 
Photo 
Hair and Make up 
Costume and Wardrobe 
Writers 
Museum and Gallery 
Admin and Management 
Misc 

emailed to you five days a week 
200 to 300 gigs a week 
union and non union 
We post PAID GIGS only 
created by artists for artists 

Did you know you can save the planet with just a flick 
of the wrist? Sure thing... you make your hand grab 
eviro friendly products from the super market shelf. 
More people do that then the companies will have to 
sway under mass consumer pressure. 

e-mail me to get connected!

I know you meant this as a joke, and it's pretty fucking funny, actually,
but just to clarify your position, I'm sure that you're not actually
advocating drug use in 8th graders, correct?

Subject: [sfraves] AEC

Wow, just wanted to throw in my two cents on what was really a wonderful 
party.  Up until about 12:45 it looked like i wouldn't be able to convince 
my girlfriend to put aside here work-week weariness and come on out, but 
after much pleading we were off to the map points.  I have to say that 
getting through the map points was more fun than plenty of parties i've been 
to :)

Well we arrived just after 2 and inched along that ridiculously dark road up 
to the party site.  Man, i was genuinely concerned that we might head off 
the road... damn the glare those dashlights create...

Unfortunately i'd been completely unable to get a nap before the party, but 
an energy bar provided me with enough pep to get out there and dance for a 
while.  Sadly it didn't provide enough pep to keep me going all night, so my 
girl and i took a bit of a nap between 4:30 and 6, so if you saw two ppl 
crashed out on a blanket near that lunar landscape pit, that was us.

Unfortunately it was so dark (SO DARK) and i was a tired boy, so i missed 
out on meeting ANYONE.  How that happens i have no idea, but i think i have 
a special talent for it.  Ah well, if anyone saw me out there in my blue 
hoody and green jacket, say hi next time we see each other, maybe i can 
break the not meeting ppl curse/streak.

But thanks to the SFR-planners for such a fun party, the location was 
incredible, the star-gazing was great, any chance to see the red stickman is 
more than welcome, and the DJs did fantastic jobs spinning new genres!  
Props to the crew, i had a great time.

Zack

Chill out yo... we really have no idea why Mark cancelled.  Vlad suggested a 
reason he might have cancelled, but didn't say he knew for sure.

Ask Mark if you want the truth.

Hahahaha too far? What a loser. Who would want to see a DJ perform that
wasnt willing to play an event just because its a few hours farther away?
They obviously arent in it for the scene. You don't see all those UK DJs
cancelling (too far? It's an entirely different fucking continent!!) So, I'd
rather go to Nocturnal Wonderland because all the DJs there will have been
willing to go to extra distance to give a great performance!!!

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

Subject: Re: F8: RE: [sfraves] Re: bsp.nocturnal wonderland this weekend

His agent Indicated that the event he was booked to play in LA was just
"canceled".   In fact, until seeing the Nocturnal Wonderland main flyer, I
was never even told he was playing that event.... which I know is NOT
canceled.   So whatever the particulars seem to be, there is defiantly a lot
of miscommunication going on.    However, why a respectable promoter like
Insomniac is still promoting a dj that will definitely not be there seems to
be more of a matter of miscommunication on their end, then intentional
misrepresentation.     This Mekka Bullshit displaced a lot of artists and
promoters... AND venues.    The ripple effect is obvious in this situation.

Never the less... Mark Farina is Confirmed to play EXCLUSIVELY at Megga-Buzz
this Saturday Night.    See him for yourself if you don't believe.

Keep it alive,  Vlad

Maybe it is time for the obvious follow-up question: Could such an approach
be taken?

I suggest that it isn't even a possibility. Sure, one crew or even many
crews could opt for such a policy, but the scene as a whole couldn't. Why
not? Because the law enforcement agencies are correct in at least one
regard; drug use is rampant and pervasive. That's true everywhere, including
our scene. Trying to shift our collective behavior toward a zero tolerance
stance in regards to drug use would only fracture us into two camps: those
supporting zero tolerance and those who who condone the use of controlled
substances. You might argue that this split already exists and that, that is
why we are having this conversation, but as it is now we all go to the same
parties. A zero tolerance approach seems to indicate an active cooperative
relationship with law enforcement, and if that was the case you can bet a
lot of people would avoid those parties altogether. To be frank, I'd avoid
those parties myself.

What's the U for in PLUR again?

Another point which seems to have been ignored in this discussion is that
the use of mind-altering substances almost always seems to go hand-in-hand
with countercultures such as our own which encourage free-thought and
political freedom. Even if one doesn't partake himself, his recognition of
another's right to do so is evidence of an attitude of understanding,
acceptance, and unwillingness to judge others. This is a respectable and
rightfully respected attitude. It may be an unpopular opinion, but I think
that drug use has had some positive effects on our scene. It is, for
instance, a unifying factor almost as considerable as the love of the music
or dancing is. The very "undergroundness" of the scene has an allure of its
own and the drugs more than any other are the reason it has been
underground. The actual effects of at least one drug popular among us
promotes a certain closeness, openness, and empathy in its users and many
very real, close, and strong relationships have grown out of shared drug
experiences. It also strikes me as being perfectly natural. Our events are
social gatherings and chemically altering one's state of mind in a social
atmosphere is an age old practice.

Note: I DO NOT MEAN TO ENCOURAGE DRUG USE. Taking controlled substances is a
dangerous practice and should never be done irresponsibly. Children that are
still developing physically should abstain, as should anyone who isn't
emotionally and mentally mature and stable enough or informed sufficiently
to make rational decisions about the risks they are willing to take.
Experimentation with substances is not for everyone. You can live a very
happy life without ever experiencing the effects of a controlled substance.
If you feel you can't, then that's all the more reason for you to avoid
self-medication and instead seek help through other avenues. Drugs won't
improve your life any more than television will. Drugs won't fix anything.
Drugs should not be used for escapism. Do yourself a favor and avoid them,
but if you choose not to, be informed and do them responsibly.

Does it strike anyone else as absurd that we are actually discussing what
political values the "scene" should embrace? I rather think the scene as a
whole should remain as apolitical as possible.

Then comes in the question...

Arent we being de facto political, just by being in this "scene" or "counter

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

Wednesday, August 29, 2001 (SF Chronicle) 
There goes the neighborhood/After 33 years, children's
TV pioneer Fred Rogers hangs up his sweater 
Tim Goodman 



   The sweater has long since been in the Smithsonian. We are all fast
friends now, in this neighborhood of his. It seems like only yesterday
that he raised yet another generation of children in this country. And
yet, doesn't it seem a little odd that it's over now, that we're losing
Mister Rogers?
   In truth, we're not. Kids love reruns. And there are 33 seasons of
"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" to choose from. But for Fred Rogers, the
last episodes have already been taped; they'll be broadcast nationally
this week and on KQED next week. At 72, he has ridden off into the Zen
sunset, the Dalai Lama of children's television, having put on his
sneakers and thrown his arms into a warm sweater for the last time. When
the last "new" show airs on KQED (6:30 a. m. Sept. 7), viewers will not
see any tearful farewell or anything different in the show. The next
Monday, the show will start up again in reruns.
   Fred Rogers was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1962 and was
assigned to work with children through the media. He started a local kids'
show in Pittsburgh, then one in Canada, before returning to Pittsburgh in
1966. Two years later, his "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" went national on
PBS.
   It's not difficult to fully appreciate Rogers. If you have a decent
bone in your body -- even the most cynical among you -- then in your heart
you know he's quite possibly the nicest man who ever lived.
   In television, we are given daily doses of little lies. We come to love
our characters and our actors, and then our reverence is poked rudely in
the eye once we get to know them better.
   But Rogers was the real deal. That wasn't an act he gave the kids of
this country for 33 years. When someone yelled, "Cut!" he didn't angrily
peel the sweater off, rush out to his Mercedes and lean on his horn all
the way home, cursing life. If you ever met Fred Rogers face to face, you
were changed forever.
   This is a guy who, when presented with a lifetime achievement award at
the Emmys in 1997, asked everyone to bow their heads for 10 seconds and
think of someone they loved or someone who inspired them. Inner reflection
is not a big thing in Hollywood until it becomes a hot trend at the spa,
but television's biggest stars did what Mister Rogers told them to do
because, well, he's Mister Rogers.
   And nobody cut him off. They didn't play music to signal that his time
was up. Nope. The heads stayed bowed. And when the time was up, they were
all probably happier than they'd been all day.
   It's hard to overstate how genuine Rogers is. In the media, we're
cynical by nature. It's an occupational hazard. It's nearly impossible to
imagine that Rogers was legit, that he didn't have skeletons in his
closet. Nobody wanted to probe, mind you, but it was hard not to be
doubtful, given all that goes on with people who claim to be good, to be
really good.
   But five seconds with Rogers made you a convert, made you feel dirty
and guilty for even thinking that he could be anything but as sweet and
pure as the camera showed him to be.
  I once asked him if he ever got angry, if he ever felt like, say,
smashing something. His response: "Oh, I don't lose my temper, but I get
angry." I asked him how he expressed that anger, how he dealt with it.
"Through the piano, or swimming."
   As with the Dalai Lama, there's more to Rogers than a beautiful
serenity. There's forgiveness that just emanates from him. What about all
those spoofs of his persona, whether it was Eddie Murphy on "Saturday
Night Live" or basketball's David Robinson talking about his neighborhood
in commercials? All the mean things said by cynics? "I have a sense of
humor, too," Rogers said.
   And while it's comforting to know that Mister Rogers wasn't Krusty the
Clown in real life, his true achievements took place in front of the
camera. He understood that children were beautiful creatures, the last of
the pure innocents. His brand of teaching -- his entertainment for kids
both on the show and watching at home -- bred a certain sweetness that
touched generations.
   Long before selling toys and cereal was the No. 1 goal of a children's
show, Mister Rogers wanted to instill values, to make a safe place for
kids, far, far away from guns and action figures and all their mayhem.
   Mister Rogers was old school. He didn't have much need for Japanese
animation, giant ninja turtles or even Bugs Bunny. With him, you just took
off your shoes, welcomed the guests and kept your heart rate way, way
down. You didn't have a video game controller hurting your thumb or
quick-cut images making your brain feel as if it were flying on Skittles
and high-test chocolate milk.
   You just chilled. You were mellow. You loved maps and coloring and
inspiring new discoveries. Ultimately, you were a good kid. Mister Rogers
at the very least put you on that path. Once you got older, how you
screwed up or went wrong was up to you, or whomever or whatever you chose
to blame.
   But the foundation was there, thanks to Fred Rogers. Here's hoping he
puts on his most comfortable sweater and enjoys the rest of his life,
while more generations of kids enjoy his show.

 for my back & it totally got me high all of a sudden when I got 2 An Sabin=
! So it was trippy & fun, but I got kinda scared 'cuase I never been high o=
ff pain killers before!  So yeah, for the next like hour & a 1/2, I'm all c=
allin people on my Mom's cell phone that I forgot to give back to her from =
the weekend & I totally needed to talk to people!!  I tried getting ahold o=
f specific people who I knew stuff about like Motrin & stuff 'cause I never=
 had to use painkillers before.  Some of those people couldn't  be reached =

Of course not, Ari:)  My meaning was that they should be exercising their 
brains, ie experimenting with new thinking, at that age in a good 
educational environment.

Not intentionally, but it sure was fun. I was in IL last weekend
visitng my folk's and their new puppy. Took the puppy out back so
he could take car of business & I ended up slipping and landing in a
big pile of dirt left over from some work done on the water lines
to the house and soaked from the recent torrential downpours they've
been getting. 1/2 an hour later I was trying to hose myself and the
dog off with the water hose..3 month old puppys whould much rather
go back to the dirt than get an icy cold shower.

I think everyone knows my position on this, but to restate.  Drug use has 
always been an integral part of the human experience.  Efforts to ban drugs 
have always failed.  Imprisoning people and destroying valuable 
subcultures, musical or otherwise, to eradicate drugs that are made illegal 
by, it seems to me, pure whimsy is in effect making war on the citizens of 
this country.  We should oppose those who war on us.

A sane policy regarding drug use would,at the very least, concentrate on 
harm reduction, education, aggressive treatment of addictive disease, and 
no criminal penalties for possession of socially unapproved drugs.

The rest of the civilized world seems to be moving in this direction.  See 
below.

Love,

Apollo


                                         U.S. Is on a Lonely Road in Its 
Drug Policy
Nicolas Eyle, AlterNet
August 28, 2001
Canada's recent decision to permit the sick access to medical marijuana is 
just the latest in a long series of refutations by other countries of 
America's drug policies. It comes on the heels of Portugal's 
decriminalizing the personal possession of small quantities of all drugs. 
It follows Mexican President Vincente Fox's call for drug legalization as 
the way to break the black market. The Conservative Party in Great Britain 
is arguing heatedly about whether they should decriminalize marijuana, 
remove penalties for its use or legalize it, which would permit a legal 
distribution system to be set up, ending the contact marijuana users now 
have with sellers of harder drugs. All over the world countries are looking 
at the disastrous results of America's "War on Drugs" and shifting their 
drug policies to avoid making the same mistakes.
In fact, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany and nearly every other country in 
Western Europe have some form of decriminalization of personal possession 
of drugs in place and the results are certainly encouraging others to move 
in this direction. In the Netherlands, marijuana is sold in hundreds of 
"coffee shops," over-the-counter and their teenage marijuana use is half of 
what it is in the U.S. In Switzerland a program to supply hard-core heroin 
addicts with heroin has been so successful at lowering health-care costs 
and reducing the crime associated with that drugs use that its biggest and 
most vocal supporters are the police and the insurance companies. Recently 
even the Ukraine, long one of Europe's toughest drug warriors, announced 
that it was going to release some 35,000 drug offenders from prison in 
September and make drug use "a non-arrestable offense."
In the U.S., 9 states have approved medical marijuana use. A recent 
conference of U.S./Mexico border state governors, organized by New Mexico 
Governor Gary Johnson, agreed that the drug problem should be a public 
health issue more than a law-enforcement one. Individual counties have gone 
even farther. Mendicino County California made marijuana offenses the 
lowest priority possible for law-enforcement. If you are a policeman 
looking into a possible marijuana crime and a little old lady calls because 
her cat is stuck in a tree, you have to forget the marijuana and help the cat!
America is in an increasingly difficult position internationally because of 
the drug war. We purport to be the leader of the free world, yet with 5 
percent of the world's population, we have 25 percent of the world's 
prisoners -- more than half serving sentences for drug-related offenses. 
Our troops, arms and money fuel civil wars in Latin American countries like 
Colombia in the name of ridding the world of drugs. Many of our cities are 
in turmoil and minorities are targeted for drug offenses in painfully 
obvious, unjust proportions. And with all this, American kids have better 
access to illegal drugs than to beer!
So who are our allies in our naive quest for a drug-free America through 
prohibition? Iran, Thailand, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, China and a handful 
of other notoriously repressive nations. These are allies. These countries 
execute drug users regularly and have for years. These countries still have 
large and growing drug problems because, like the U.S., they refuse to 
accept the fact that prohibition does not work.
If the U.S. is serious about protecting it's children from the problems 
associated with drugs then we had better start looking around us. Look at 
what other countries are doing and see what works and what doesn't. With 
adolescent drug use up and drugs purer, cheaper and more available than 
ever before, it should be obvious to us, as it seems to be to most of the 
rest of the world, that prohibition is not the way to solve the problem.
The U.S. has gone down the wrong road many times in its history. There was 
a time when women were not allowed to vote, when it was quite permissible 
for white people to own black people, for segregation to exist. A time when 
Americans were forbidden to drink alcohol. Fortunately we came to our 
senses about these things, changed our laws and became a stronger, better 
country for it.
Sociologist Thomas Sowell once said that the difference between a policy 
and a crusade is that a policy is judged by its results, but a crusade is 
judged by how good it makes the crusaders feel. It's becoming hard to refer 
to what we do with regard to drugs in America as a policy. What we have is 
clearly a Jihad. A holy war with no basis in logic or sense. No interest in 
results or costs. No concern that the medicine may be far worse than the 
disease. Why is it so hard for us to see this and reconsider how we handle 
these drugs in America?

Subject: [sfraves] Darkwave and Electro-Industrial (WAS RE: [sfraves] goths and ravers)

Heehee pretty funny post!

But yea, i noticed it said goths only listen to Christian death metal or
something.  That's not true--i know of a goth genre that many people into
electronic music would really appreciate.  It's called darkwave, or
electro-industrial.  You can find some amazing stuff that is really dark and
gothy, but it has some extremely beautiful trance behind it.  In fact, i'm
thinking of DJ'ing it, but it's just too bloody hard to find on vinyl.
	Anyways, if anyone is curious to find out more, check out some of the
following groups:  Apoptigma Berserk, Front Line Assembly, Covenant, Funker
Vogt, Die Form, Juno Reactor, Mesh, Velvet Acid Christ, Claire Voyant, Front
242, Suicide Commando, and many more.  If you want a good idea, go to Hot
Topic and pick up one of the Metropolis Records compilations for 6 bucks.
Also, i know I missed a whole bunch of groups so this is an official request
for Dr. Derailment to add to this post =) as he's a friend of mine and knows
much about this genre.
	You have to get used to the super dark and evil sounding vocals, but after
that, you'll find a beautiful dark side of trance and other electronic music
that you probably haven't been exposed to before

Otheric, you may want to check this out, and for all you other ravers and
goths out there, PEACE!!!

Yes, at one point industrial dance music seemed to blend into the goth 
scene.  In many record/cd stores the genres are  lumped together these 
days.  There are musical similarities.  I'm an old industrial head and I 
still mix industrial stuff with house on occasion.  Front Line Assembly and 
Front 242 are old favorites and I have pretty much everything they released.

That is _not_ correct.  It was an _intentionally_ ironic quote said by a
british journalist not more than 2 or 3 years ago.

i have an article at home that discussed the origin, but not in front of
me. this will have to suffice for now.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/0106/20/html/spike.html

Quote unquote

This is cited as the quote of the 20th century on
various geek sites, and it's certainly a beauty. But is it genuine? On
our behalf,
Nintendo Australia's Melanie Powell has tried to find
anyone in any branch of her company who either knew Kristian Wilson or
remembers him saying the above. She now reports: "To
the best of my knowledge, no-one named Kristian Wilson has ever
worked in a senior position for Nintendo, nor is there
any evidence the quote really comes from 1989." Bugger!

That is a hillarious slide show.. OMG and the Finish press releases seem
convinced it was real.. I mean this has to be a joke.. no self-respecting
WTO body would allow some random speaker to inflate a golden phallus in
their presence.. would they?  LOL!

Pilled to the Air Max 

Corporate logos on pills - has anyone told these
companies what's going on? We did, and here's what
they said. 

Motorola ::: [In disbelief] "No! I've never heard of
this! I've never heard of... any company's logos
appearing on these products and it's certainly not
been done with Motorola's consent. Um, I, er.. I have
absolutely no idea where it's coming from, I'm sorry,
and it's not something anyone from this company would
have given any authorization to or would comment on.
[Nervous laughter] Oh my." 

Nike ::: "Nike does not condone or encourage drug use
at all and we are very concerned that our logo is
being used in this way. The only use of the swoosh
should be by Nike on our own products. Goodness!" 

Rolls Royce ::: "Really? [Pause] I wasn't aware of
this going on! You know, the mascot is called 'The
Spirit of Ecstasy' - that's its actual name!" Later
on, after they'd thought about it a bit, Christopher
Springham, director of media relations, sent us this:
"May I request that you ensure it is clear to your
readers that the manufacture of ecstasy is a criminal
act." 

Lacoste ::: "I'm... I'm absolutely disgusted, hold on,
just wait one second... [puts us on hold for a full
five minutes] Hi, I've just spoken to head office and
we're absolutely appalled and disgusted that this type
of thing is going on." 

Teletubbies ::: BBC Children's Programmes' press
office: [Laughter] "You're having a laugh, aren't you?
I haven't seen many two- or three-year-olds in
nightclubs. [More laughter] This is so far removed
from the actual programme. knowing what the makers of
Teletubbies are like I don't think it's something they
want, because we had a similar thing when Teletubbies
appeared on acid tabs... erm..." 

Giorgio Armani ::: "We are completely unaware of any
such use of our corporate logo. We have a very strong
anti-drugs policy. We will, of course, fully
investigate this allegation." 

Bacardi ::: "We're horrified. We take our trademark
very seriously and anyone who uses it without our
permission is infringing ou rights, which is a very
serious issue. People say there's no such thing as bad
publicity, but there is." 

VW ::: "Volkswagen was not aware its logo was being
used in such a way and is not happy. Such illegal use
of the Volkswagon logo is not helpful commercially and
Volkswagen would welcome any information which would
help it take legal action to prevent such use." 

Euro ::: EU commission, Germany: "Well..! [Laughs,
then starts choking] It's... this is the first I've
heard of this, [laughing again] well, er... it's
exploitation... No, I do not think it will encourage
clubbers to consider the benifits of the single
currency! I have no documents on this so... err... I
can't help." 

Mitsubishi ::: "Yes [bored sigh], thank you very much,
we are aware of it. we haven't got a comment at the
moment, not to those questions anyway. You now as well
as I do, this is for entertainment value... So i'm not
going to answer them. I mean tis is an illegal use of
or trademark and we have got absolutely nothing to do
with it."

Subject: [sfraves] Thanks!

Heya everybody!

Just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to everyone who made it to SOUND ASYLUM 
II this past Friday... it was bangin'!  We had probably a little under 700 
people, all happy and shining!  Thanks for bringing your love!
Unfortunately I didn't get into the party until about 1am (stuck working the 
map point, probably saw you there!), but when I got there I was way stoked 
on how everything came together!  Slammin' decorations, lightings, lasers, 
sound... thanks to everyone that helped out & participated in the event, and 
most importantly, to YOU that came & brouhgt your positive energy!

Much love,

Denise
:)

Life Of Dreams

Once loved by all,
Now forgotten like a dream,
Shunned by love,
Caressed by darkness,
Fallen from your arms,
Landing in bitter hate,
Rotting from your screams.

Once an angel in dreams,
Now a demon in your nightmares,
Praying upon your fears,
Waiting to be reality,
Tickling thoughts of death.

The bump in the night,
Followed by screams of pain,
Lifeless body in your arms,
Once waz me,
Now nothing more then death.

Fallen to my own fate,
Hated by those once loved,
Nothing to hide,
Nothing to fear,
Here is my fate,
Here is where i am,
And forever will be.

OK, check this out.  I've been going to goth/fetish events for the past
several years where the music there is generally know as industrial/gothic,
like you mentioned.

BUT, in the last several months I've noticed more of a trance/techno sound
being mixed in.  "OK", I thought, that's kinda cool, 'cause I like
trance/techno/whatever music also.

BUT THIS totally knocked me on the floor.  ARE YOU READY?  The DJ played
SANDSTORM.  OMG.

THEN, I saw this girl all dressed in black, looking totally goth, AND she
was dancing with LIGHT STICKS.  OMG.  What's the world coming to.

Oh yea, i forgot to mention:  I really wanna spin industrial--especially the
more trancey stuff like covenant and VNV Nation (can you imagine the view
from the decks at a goth club when it gets goin??  MAN!!)  But I have no
idea where to find that stuff on vinyl.  I've searched the world over, and
you just can't find it!!  I'm even thinking of getting CD mixers so I can do
it.

Does anyone know where I can find that stuff on plastic???  Please help a
person who wants to explore the dark side mwahahahahaha

And hey, maybe Otheric set a precedant and we'll see more goths at raves, as
well as more lightsticks at goth events (goths beware the DEA!!!!)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Darkwave and Electro-Industrial (WAS RE: [sfraves] goths and ravers)

I had this dream once where all these industrial kids at a concert were
decked out in full Road Warrior, post apocolyptic leather outfits and waving
those deep purple glo sticks to the beat of the music. It would be surreal
to see a wave of purple amidst a sea of black. I would love to hear
Headhunter dropped at a party. Hell, KMFDM - Naive (original mix off the out
of print cd that I have) is very house-ish. Oddly it mixes rather well with
Madison Ave - Don't Call Me Baby. Yes I know that's sick and depraved, yet
so amusing! *That's the way of the world - Don't call me baby - What you
waiting for...*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Darkwave and Electro-Industrial 

About, oh, three or four years ago, I was a dancer for
Bondage A Go-Go.  It didn't last for long, but quite
fun, nonetheless.  I used to dress up as a priest, and
yes, I did use glowsticks.

Horrible.

You see, the whole goth thing brought me out of my
shell in the 80s.  And once a goth, always a goth.  I
still have all of my old vinyl...heh, I remember andyW
drooling over my copy of "Stainless Steel Providers"
at Epiphany Goes to Hell II.

So, last Saturday at Otherworld, Boomerang Fidget's
girlfriend asked me, "why do you always wear black?" 
Well, it never really occurred to me.  Floundering, I
replied, "Uh, actually, my shirt's dark blue, and my
jacket's grey..."

"Yeah, well, it all looks black to me."

doh.

I look into my closet.  All black.  Or varying shades
thereof.  Guess it's 'cause I'm still goth.  ah well. 
:P

While reading the bill, I didn't see the word "rave"
anywhere??

All it's doing is is preventing "e" use...

isn't that what we want?

I thought the rave scene was all about the music?

Dear friends & colleagues,

I am forwarding this EM:DEF Action Alert, and urging your support of EM:DEF=
.
Most of you are aware that JUJU Beats was cancelled this year.  The
cancellation was the result of the local sheriff's proactive agenda to
eliminate the event; going as far as sabotaging the sale of the land where
we=20
planned to hold the event.  Furthermore, the canellation cost B3
several thousand dollars.

William Patterson of EM:DEF assisted us in contacting lawyers qualified to
represent our case, which seeks damages from the Sheriff's Department.
EM:DEF was very active in resolving the New Orleans case, and is now
spending=20
energy on the Ecstasy Prevention Act of 2001 - a bill which encourages loca=
l
governments to restrict raves.  And, EM:DEF continues to assist
professionals=20
with legal advice and referrals.

I encourage you to match our contribution of $250, or to donate at least
$100.  Their services are critical to maintaining the industry we have all
worked hard to build.  To donate, visit:

http://www.emdef.org/contribute.html

Feel free to contact me personally to discuss any questions you have
regarding EM:DEF.  I can be reached by e-mail at this address.  You can
contact Will directly at (310) 450-9036 or will@emdef.org.

Regards,

Brian Alper

Most used record shops carry what you're looking for. Check out 
Amoeba (they had pretty much the entire FLA catalog last time I 
looked), Streetlight, Open Mind, and Recycled Records (all in 
San Francisco). Most of what I've found is in great condition, 
so don't be fooled by beat up sleeves!

Some other artists you might want to look for: Depeche Mode, 
NIN, Skinny Puppy (and side projects, particularly Download), 
Liabach, Project Pitchfork, Spahn Ranch, Leaether Strip, 
Einsturzende Neubaten, Clock DVA, Birmingham 6, and even Lords 
of Acid (cheesy and blatantly sexual, but I'll be damned if they 
don't make people dance!).

happy hunting

They did actually mention giving funds for shutting

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fw: Nikolay Soltys Caught

They have minimal news so far...the radio says they
caught him hiding in his mother's backyard (under a
desk or something?)

Anyway, here is the news article on information so
far...

http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/rampage010830.html

Nikolay Soltys, the Ukrainian immigrant wanted in the
brutal slayings of six family members, was captured
today in a family member's home in a Sacramento,
Calif., suburb, sheriff's officials told ABCNEWS
affiliate KXTV. 

Despite a nationwide manhunt, Soltys, 27, managed to
elude authorities for 10 days after the rampage. He is
in custody after police found him at his mother's home
in the Citrus Heights suburb of Sacramento.
Police grabbed the fugitive in the backyard after
Soltys' brother called 911, sheriff's officials said.

Officers who captured Soltys at about 8 a.m. said he
was barefoot, dirty and shabbily dressed, "and looked
like he could have been hiding in a field somewhere,"
Sacramento County Sheriff Lou Blanas told The
Associated Press. 

Soltys made the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, and the
case was featured on the television program America's
Most Wanted. Reward money offered for his capture
exceeded $100,000. 

Soltys allegedly slashed the throats of his family
members on Aug. 20 in a killing spree that lasted
several hours and led police on a gruesome search for
victims throughout the area. 

Police believe Soltys stabbed his 23-year-old pregnant
wife Lyubov to death on the morning of Aug. 20, then
drove to another home where he stabbed and killed his
9-year-old nephew, his 9-year-old niece and his aunt
and uncle. 

Soltys changed his bloody clothes and went to his
mother's house, according to investigators. He picked
up his 3-year-old son, who was later found dead in a
cardboard box. 

Pictures with notes scrawled on the back in Soltys'
abandoned car led police to the boy's body and gave a
hint to a motive for the killings  that Soltys
believed his family members "spoke out" on too many
topics, police said. 

In the days since the slayings, police fielded
reported sightings of Soltys in North Carolina,
Tennessee and Oregon. But law enforcement officials
primarily focused their search in the Sacramento area.


Soltys' relatives in the Sacramento area have been
under police protection since the slayings.

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

You may already have... Sorta.  My anemic little record box contains at least 3
songs that sample the main Headhunter beat.  A DJ Dan remix of a Cirrus song,
An old System 7 song and some other DJ Dan remix...

Headhunter was great, but whenever I think of Front 242 I think of entire dance
floors screaming in unison "NO SEX UNTIL MARRIAGE".  

I miss goth clubs.  Funny story... I just moved and as I was unpacking my
clothes I noticed lots of colors and not very much black.  When confronted, my
girlfriend confessed that she's been secretly weeding out all my black clothes
for the last 9 years.  Women: You can't live with them, and you can't stay up
all night playing Counter-Strike and expect to get a warm reception when you
come to bed at 5:30 am... or something.

Subject: [sfraves] real life "traffic"

It's a real version of one scenario in the movie "Traffic."   The DEA 
chief's son is a raver.

EVEN DEA CHIEF HAD BRUSH WITH CLUB DRUG SCENE

He's the head of the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration.

But like any other parent, Asa Hutchinson has the same struggles over how to 
react to the dangers of drugs.

Hutchinson, tapped in June to run the DEA, was in Oak Brook on Wednesday to 
address a conference on Ecstasy and other club drugs, an increasing problem 
for Chicago and the suburbs.  He wove a personal tale of why he thinks DEA 
needs to do more to educate parents about the risks of club drugs.

After he was appointed to run DEA, Hutchinson said, one of his sons asked 
for permission to go to a "rave," a type of dance party.

"He said, 'Dad, I know there's always drugs out there, but you know I just 
want to hear the music,' " Hutchinson told a group of about 300 federal, 
state and local law enforcement officials.

Hutchinson said he told his son it wasn't a good idea, but his son 
responded: "If you have any doubt, why don't you go with me?"

Hutchinson agreed.  His son was so proud his dad was going to the dance that 
he posted the information on a rave Web site.  The DEA and other law 
enforcement agencies monitor such sites to track raves because club drug 
sales are common there.

"Pretty soon I had a call from Washington--the DEA.  They said, 'Where are 
you going tonight?' They said, 'You can't go to that rave.' "

"I said, 'I have a son who's ready to go, and you better have a mighty good 
reason,' " Hutchinson said.

The DEA responded that agents planned to arrest the promoter of the rave for 
allegedly trafficking in Ecstasy, and Hutchinson decided to stay home.

Indeed, the promoter was arrested and about two weeks later, while out on 
bail, threw another rave in a Little Rock, Ark., warehouse, where a teenage 
boy died with club drugs in his system, Hutchinson said.

"The point of my story," Hutchinson told the group, "is how difficult it is 
to get the right information and make the right decisions." He added that 
"we do not do enough to help parents."

After Hutchinson's speech, Chicago police Supt.  Terry Hillard and Cook 
County Sheriff Michael Sheahan agreed to launch a campaign to educate school 
superintendents and principals about club drugs, which they described as a 
growing scourge for teenagers and young adults in the region.

"This is something that kids think is safe to take," Sheahan said.  "But I 
know of at least three cases in which kids died thinking they were taking a 
safe drug."

Beyond education, authorities think a new law taking effect in January will 
help curb club drug sales.  A conviction for possessing 15 Ecstasy pills 
could result in a prison sentence of at least six years under the new 
legislation.

Club drugs have become a pervasive problem in DuPage County, and are flowing 
into suburban Cook County and the city of Chicago, officials said.  In 
Chicago, police have seized more than 200,000 Ecstasy tablets so far this 
year, Hillard said.

"It's going to be like crack cocaine and heroin," he said.  "It's here to 
stay."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Darkwave and Electro-Industrial (WAS RE: [sfraves] goths and ravers)

How on earth could I leave out Depeche Mode!!  They're my favourite group!!

Words like violence
Break the Silence
They come crashing in
In to my little world . . .

I only wish they still made Violator on vinyl--i have to search out a used
copy!  I already have a disk, but it's an original press from 1990, and it's
a picture disk with the red rose spanning the diameter of the record (it's
beautifl) so i can't really play it that much lol

It's also wierd that I found Spahn Ranch on the first drum'n'bass
compilation I ever bought. Funny how things cross over huh

Peace!

Most used record shops carry what you're looking for. Check out
Amoeba (they had pretty much the entire FLA catalog last time I
looked), Streetlight, Open Mind, and Recycled Records (all in
San Francisco). Most of what I've found is in great condition,
so don't be fooled by beat up sleeves!

Some other artists you might want to look for: Depeche Mode,
NIN, Skinny Puppy (and side projects, particularly Download),
Liabach, Project Pitchfork, Spahn Ranch, Leaether Strip,
Einsturzende Neubaten, Clock DVA, Birmingham 6, and even Lords
of Acid (cheesy and blatantly sexual, but I'll be damned if they
don't make people dance!).

happy hunting

You mean Depressed Mode... ha ha ha

and don't forget "It's No Good" from their Ultra album, it used to be me and
my girlfriend's favorite f**k song, that is until I turned her on to
Morgan's Sentinel mix.  Now she can't get enough (of Morgan I mean).

SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR ECSTASY ABUSE PREVENTION.

Section 506B(c) of title V of the Public Health
Service Act is amended by adding at the end the
following:

`(3) EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS-

`(A) IN GENERAL- In addition to the priority under
paragraph (2), the Administrator shall give priority
to communities that have taken measures to combat club
drug use, including passing ordinances restricting

Okay, not that I'm supporting this bill or anything,
but it does say, "restricting rave clubs" not banning
them.  So maybe that just means restricting them with
more strict security on drug issues....

Have you ever known the government to restrict something only lightly when
they have waged a war against it for going on 5 years?

BTW: for those who dont know...

The same person who preseted this bill was the one who presented the "Anti
meth proliferation act" which allowed the gov to enter your home w/o a
warrant, search it, take things, and not tell you for up tp 6 months
afterwords..

Inquiring minds have to know..

If I am reading this right, it gives them power to
seize the land too?  Is that allowed?  I mean, usually
the places these things happen aren't acutally owned
by the people throwing these "rave clubs" right?

Yes, Bryan.  And I strongly urge everyone to support EMDF and other 
organizations in opposition to this war on our subculture.  Contribute what 
dollars you can, become involved in political action, and fight the man

Subject: Re: [sfraves] rave bans - ecstasy bill

i think that's too optimistic a view.  what the
writers of the bill want is more anti-rave
restrictions such as what has been passed in chicago. 
(see article below.)  and how can you hold someone
accountable for people consuming drugs at a party in
your space?  that's crazy.  what, the owner needs to
be there monitoring every single person every second? 
but that's what they'll try to do.  

and i don't think it's mentioned in this article, but
there's also some kind of fine in chicago of $10,000
against promoters of raves, including djs.  i don't
remember the details of this fine, but i believe it
was first used against someone who had a house party. 


Chicago and Illinois Pursue Anti-Rave Laws 

Looks like cities and states are now following the
federal lead, threatening "rave" promoters (and those
who allow their buildings to be used for a "rave")
with criminal prosecution. This article is from the
Chicago Tribune © May 3, 2001.

City, State, target instigators of raves with stiff
penalties

By Ray Long and Rick Pearson, Chicago Tribune Staff
Reporters. Tribune staff reporters Gary Washburn and
Joe Biesk.

The Chicago City Council and the Illinois General
Assembly moved
aggressively Wednesday to crack down on wild rave
parties that lure
youngsters into environments loaded with dangerous
club drugs, underage
drinking and sometimes predatory sexual behavior.

Mayor Richard Daley pushed through the council an
ordinance that will
send building owners and managers to jail if they
intentionally let a
property be used for raves at which controlled
substances are used,
distributed, stored or made. Violators could face jail
terms of 2 weeks
to 6 months.

Meanwhile, the Illinois House Executive Committee
approved a bill that
would make it a crime to promote raves loaded with
illegal activity.
Rep. Dan Burke (D-Chicago), who handled the bill, said
he expected it to
be amended, but the goal is to make it tough for
promoters to set up a
rave.

Passage of the city ordinance, which took effect
immediately, prompted
Daley to lash out at the people who produce the huge
rogue dance parties
where Ecstasy and other designer drugs are widely
used.

"They are after all of our children," Daley said.
"Parents should be
outraged by this."

Raves are an international sensation. The
one-night-only parties are
often held in warehouses or secret locations where
people pay to dance,
do drugs, play loud music, and engage in random sex
acts. They are often
invitation-only or attended by people who learn about
the location by
checking an Internet site or calling a telephone
number listed on
clandestinely distributed fliers. Despite the
widespread popularity, the
raves can be dangerous and even deadly. They were
linked to three deaths
in the Chicago area last year.

The legislation pending in Springfield would define
what constitutes a
"criminal rave" and impose even tougher penalties on
promoters if they
knew that people under 18 would attend. Promoters
convicted in the worst
cases also could be subject to civil penalties and
could be sued by
parents whose children attend.

This is probably a provision intended to dissuade space owners from
allowing parties on their property, regardless of who's throwing the
party.

<end snip>

They *will* hold that person accountable b/c by
letting people onto their property, they are taking
responsibility for what they do.  That's why clubs
have security.  I'm not sure how things are done over
in Cali as I am from DC, but over here, you're
practically felt up as a means of security going into
the club.

Back in '99 we had a much loved party (Buzz) shut down
b/c Fox decided they wanted a new Edge to their story
and came in over exaggerating the "blatent drug use"
that was going on.  Luckily, due to much fanagling and
a lawsuit against Fox5, Buzz was allowed to re-open
under certain restrictions.  

The manager/owner or promotoer *is* responsible.  To
say that they wouldn't be is absolutely absurd.  I'm
not saying it's right, that's just the way it is.

I'm note sure whether you're talking to me or to Apollo, but in either
case, no, I'm not advocating 8th graders using drugs at all. I simply found
that statement to be horribly amusing for quite a number of reasons, the
main reason being the implication that some guy is telling 8th graders how
to use their heads.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] rave bans - ecstasy bill

I just wanted to correct the history referenced in this message.  On May 7th 
1999, Buzz shut itself down because of the negative publicity from the 
"news" report that aired that week on the Washington, DC channel Fox 5.  
Many of us gathered to protest at the Fox-5 headquarters over the next few 
weeks and gained positive media coverage for the scene in the Washington 
Post and elsewhere.

To my knowledge, there was never a lawsuit against Fox 5 and even if there 
was, it did not cause Buzz to reopen.  A month and a half after the report, 
the venue owner and the promoters decided to reopen the club night under a 
different name (Sting) and prohibited pacifiers, vicks, etc. (the list was 
like 12 items long) as a defensive measure.

In reference to your more general point, the venue owner and promoters 
should not be held responsible for drug use that occurs inside.  This would 
be the same as holding ampitheatres responsible for anyone who smokes pot at 
a rock concert.  The idea of prohibiting symbols of rave culture as a means 
of reducing drug use is a bad idea that Buzz helped popularize.

I was happy to see that the ACLU won their injunction agains the New Orleans 
club plea agreement banning glowsticks and pacifiers.  They have shown that 
it is important to promote raving as an expressive activity in our fight 
against the repression of rave culture.  I encourage everyone to read the 
ACLU legal documents which make this point.
http://www.emdef.org/pdf/082101_behan_memorandum.pdf
http://www.emdef.org/pdf/082101_behan.pdf

I will be returning to Buzz on September 28th when I will be in town to 
scale fences in our nations capital (http://www.abolishthebank.org).  It is 
a very different space than it used to be and the Buzz transition 
illustrates the problem with driving rave culture completely into clubs and 
concert venues.  It truly has lost much of its originality, though we will 
still enjoy our reunion trip.

<end snip>

They *will* hold that person accountable b/c by
letting people onto their property, they are taking
responsibility for what they do.  That's why clubs
have security.  I'm not sure how things are done over
in Cali as I am from DC, but over here, you're
practically felt up as a means of security going into
the club.

Back in '99 we had a much loved party (Buzz) shut down
b/c Fox decided they wanted a new Edge to their story
and came in over exaggerating the "blatent drug use"
that was going on.  Luckily, due to much fanagling and
a lawsuit against Fox5, Buzz was allowed to re-open
under certain restrictions.

The manager/owner or promotoer *is* responsible.  To
say that they wouldn't be is absolutely absurd.  I'm
not saying it's right, that's just the way it is.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr; life of dreams...

twink-e rules...i love it when people post poetry to
the list. you know something? let me share....people
might 
think that they are having a relationship with you,
because 
they read your posts, or because you made a short
conversation with you like, maybe once or twice. i
think 
that is really odd when that happens to me. i mean, it
most 
usually is never, ever mutual. i'm like, who are you
anyway, and what makes you think i care or what makes
you 
think that i don't automatically assume you mean to
harass me? not you twink-e, not anyone actually. i
think 
people know that they are just blabbing out in space
for the most part, but i am just expressing my opinion
about 
the useless behavior that only makes people who have
no life and no friends even lonelier freely. peace
out, baaayyyybeeee. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] for my lovelies...nrr

Isn't it about time for another hit of that magically delicious crack you've 
been smoking?

I mean, yeah I love tomatoes, but don't blame me if no one likes to spell 
that correctly.  Oh, and another thing, yes that would be me, not mine, but 
that lovely lady's man, and I care how you feel, hear me?!  Stars and moons 
and balloons may tell me, happiness, is the ultimate way to live life, but 
are balloons really happy?  That is a question to ponder on a somber 
Thursday afternoon.  If I do not go home, where do I go?  Tell me, before I 
must go to the next event, where everyone will be staring, leave me alone!  
My beautiful body speaks for itself, if only you knew!  Balloons.  Oh yes.  
Balloons.  And bell bottoms hehe.

So I'm intensely curious... is this actually addressed to someone in
particular?  Or is this just a nugget of general wisdom you fell compelled
to share with the group?

i'm not disagreeing with you.  i'm saying that they
*will* hold that person accountable, which i think is
really fucked up.  i mean, say you have a ug party,
and some people show up and take drugs.  to hold you,
or the space owner responsible, is whack, but of
course that's what the state is going to do.  and it's
one thing to run a professional club, but many of us
throw benefit parties and ugs outside of clubs and to
expect us to search everyone is crazy.  

in addition, people use drugs at concerts and yet
concert promoters are not held responsible.  it's
discrimination against edm events when only these
promoters are held responsible.  

i mean, do we need to be treated like criminals when
we go out to a party?  when my partner and i went out
to tresor in germany, a very much above-ground,
popular club, there were no searches at all.  nothing.
 we were treated like adults.  

personally, i try to avoid clubs w/ strict searches. 
but i'm also concerned about how restrictions on raves
will apply to ugs, or to smaller benefit parties and
such which may be defined as "raves" because
electronic dance music is played.  

and just because promoters *are* held responsible
doesn't mean that we shouldn't resist this, and at
least resist any expansion of police/state powers in
this regard.

I dont think there is such a thing as a 'non compromised' Massive. Ohhhh
that must be the marketing term then.

I suppose I could give you 1 out of 2. And its not for the latter.

Nah, not even an option.

Claudia Pfister, a spokeswoman for a Berlin animal rights group, said that
she feared the event would lead to copycat art, such as, get ready for this:
"people throwing their pet dogs out of windows."

Now this crazy bitch is just trying to get offended. She thinks that people
will see a pile of beef fall from a helicopter, and she's worried they're
going to drop their dog out of a window? For that to happen people not only
have to watch Austrian performance art, but they'd have to think their
window was a helicopter, and then forget that dogs are not cows. You might
as well worry that they're going to shave their balls and learn to fly.

Hey thats great.. but weve heard this before..
Vlad.. if you want our business... you will provide the community
with statements of contributions to these organizations after the party.
This would be an excellent way to show SFR and the world that your
not using charity as a profit motivator for your pockets.

Subject: [sfraves] more new music

all- 

here is the list of new stuff that came out monday that i did real audio
clips for.
*************************************
this is not a request to buy anything :-)
*************************************
this is just my attempt to share information that i am lucky enough to be
furnished with and think everyone else deserves a chance to see and hear it
too.

the audio clips are at
    http://alienrecords.net
if you want to hear anything on the list.

there are many more things that came out hip hop, drum and bass and
otherwise that i didn't list because i don't want to hog list space, but
join our mailing list or email grant@virtualmediahost.com and i will send
you a full list of whatever is coming out.



thanks as always-

Subject: Re: [sfraves] for my lovelies...nrr

if you're not willing to take abuse from friends of friends, you're not 
being insensitive.. you're being overtly sensitive.  If you were to be 
insensitive, geri, the 'abuse' would matter to you and would peel away like 
teflon.  which reminds me of oranges.  when I was swimming yesterday, I saw 
an ugly man, and he was holding an orange, so I quickly got out of the tank 
and ran into the mall.  There were so many beautiful people there.  You 
know when you see a movie, but you can't remember key details?  I think 
that's because I'm not getting enough vitamin c..

Subject: [sfraves] Top Ten Reasons Why Vinyl is Better than Ex

hey guys!  I know this looks pretty cheesey, but I came up with it myself
and it's my first cheesy top 10 thing so i'm proud of it, and i want to
share it with y'all =)  Write back and tell me what u think =)

.:nomadic:.
www.nomadicDJ.com

Top 10 Tried and Tested Reasons why a Vinyl Record is Better than an E
Tablet

10)	If you put one in your mouth, it doesn't taste horrible

9)	According to the American ideology of "Bigger is Better" the record
certainly wins at 12 inches versus 5 millimetres

9.5)	Therefore it's much harder to lose or misplace a record

8)	In the US, you can buy a pill for about $20.  You can get two or three
records for that price

7)	Cops don't (usually) put you in jail for being in posession of vinyl

6)	Being under the influence of E makes you want to go out and rub yourself
up against members of the opposite (or same) sex.  Being under the influence
of vinyl CAN make people of the opposite (or same) sex want to rub
themselves up against YOU!

5)	E lasts about 6 hours.  A vinyl record, while it only lasts for about 10
minutes, can be used over and over again countless times, as well as
combined with others to create a high that can last indefinitely

4)	If you mix E with other stuff, it can be very dangerous.  Hell.  You're
SUPPOSED to mix vinyl!!

3)	Vinyl can damage your eardrums.  E can damage your brain

2)	You don't have to wait like an hour for the vinyl to kick in

1)	If you are high on vinyl, it is something that can be shared everyone
else in the room.  Whether it is 10 people, or 10,000 people; if done well
that one individual high will be carried on to all of them.

Okay... I've seen this a bunch of times now, so it's not just a typo... but 
isn't "Cash 22" supposed to be "CaTch 22"? This is the 3rd or 4th BSP I've 
seen "Cash" on, but I've also seen a "Catch 22" who plays HH/NRG type kinda 
stuff. Are there two DJs, did he change his name, or are people just hearing 
him wrong?

        elloooOOoo there. . .=20

       =20
    I was wondering. . .  when people buy vinyl online, you know how =
theres usualy like a 1 or 2 minute sample of one side of the record, put =
up as a .ra or whatever file. . .=20

    do you prefer to have one longer sample of one side ? Or would you =
rather have 2 slightly shorter samples, one each side , or even a short =
sample of every track ?=20

    Do you usually search the stores by label name ? artist name ? or =
title ?=20

    Is it important to you to have a pic of the sleeve of the record (if =
it's a graphic sleeve) ?


    What do you want to see on online vinyl store sites ? What do you =
think they're lacking ? What do you wish they had ?=20

    Would you be willing to sign up to a sort of vinyl club, where for a =
monthly charge, you would basically have an agreement to purchase a =
certain amount of vinyl a week or a month ?=20

    Do you think it would be useful to have a forum where dj's sell, buy =
and trade their older or unwanted vinyl ?

    Do you usually just keep collecting your records, and never get rid =
of them ? Or do you replace old records with new ones and sell or give =
your older stuff away ?


    thanks ferr yerr help. . .=20

	It depends on the tracks. If it's just remix's that are not that
great then I'd prefer just one longer file. However if for say you have
techno or jungle that is gonna sound the same mostly  the same through
out, but is a EP with very different styles--then sure small clips of all
the trax's are gonna be nicer.

 
>     Do you usually search the stores by label name ? artist name ? or
> title ?

	You need to be able to search all 3, no less!! It depends on the
info you have, or the lack of info you have, so each search I do is gonna
be different.

>     Is it important to you to have a pic of the sleeve of the record
> (if it's a graphic sleeve) ?

	Not at all, that is a sign to me that the stock is not updated on
a daily basis, and I fear the store really doesn't have what they say they
have, so I don't even bother.

	SIMPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! www.juno.co.uk   is the best example. A US
store that is based on that site would be grand.

	I wish record stores would update better, nothing gets me in a
bind more than ordering something and giving my credit card and having the
items be out of stock.

	I would prefer something along the line of a vinyl club were the
store did personal recomendations to those customers that bought alot of
vinyl from them. If I go into a local store were I buy alot of vinyl they
are gonna know what I might like and point some good stuff out, with
online stores I don't get this service.
 
>     Do you think it would be useful to have a forum where dj's sell,

	I think a ebay style auction that allowed uploaded audio clips of
trax would be the best option, I buy alot of vinyl over ebay, but having
sound clips would be really nice.

	I don't get rid of old stuff, but I play a genre were playing old
is excepted alot more than jungle. I do get rid of stuff I don't like or
don't want, but alot of it to me is Bargin bin streetlight special.

Subject: [sfraves] Dave Clarke & iDance Festival

Dave Clarke is one of the headliner's at this years
iDance Festival in Toronto. iDance is a free festival
(with a bunch of international guests), which is being
held at Nathan Phillips Square (in front of City
Hall). 

"At a time when dance parties and raves are being
threatened in cities all over North America, iDance
hopes to educate the masses (and dispel
misconceptions) about this worldwide cultural
movement." 

Last year's festival drew over 15,000 people on a
Tuesday afternoon. The event was held to protest the
city's ban on throwing a rave on public property. As a
result of this protest (which was held on the day the
city councillor's were to vote on the bylaw) the city
lifted it's ban. 

I did a spotlight on some of Dave Clarke's music on
Equinox @ 1Groove.com - go here and to listen to the
archived show if interested -
http://www.1groove.com/show.php?s=equinox
starts around 1:30:00 into the show.

For more details on iDance - it's message statement
and other details go to www.Tribemagazine.com and
check out the iDance section on the messageboard.

Cheers!

G

Subject: Re: [sfraves] When you buy vinyl online, do you like it better when . . . 

do you prefer to have one longer sample of one side ?
Or would you rather have 2 slightly shorter samples,
one each side , or even a short sample of every track
? 

-I'd rather be able to hear each mix/track of the
record or if there's several (say a double EP or
album) then I'd prefer they pick out the best half of
the tracks.

Do you usually search the stores by label name ?
artist name ? or title ?

-My basis is mostly on the style of music but I do
have preferences to labels and producers. Some record
stores I listen to samples on, they do give a
description and I would be more inclined to listen to
it based on their opinion. I do however not listen to
records based on label, producer or title if I know
it's not gonna be my style at all.

Is it important to you to have a pic of the sleeve of
the record (if it's a graphic sleeve) ?

-no. I only care about the sounds cause after all I'm
playing the music off the record!


What do you want to see on online vinyl store sites ?
What do you think they're lacking ? What do you wish
they had ?

-I like the fact there's healthy competition in online
record stores now. Some record stores even offer
overnight delivery which is important to some DJ's
whereas other DJ's dont need them so quickly. I can't
think of anything since the stores I shop at make me
very happy.

Would you be willing to sign up to a sort of vinyl
club, where for a monthly charge, you would basically
have an agreement to purchase a certain amount of
vinyl a week or a month ? 

-Probably not mainly cause I'm looking for mostly a
specific style or sound.

Do you think it would be useful to have a forum where
dj's sell, buy and trade their older or unwanted vinyl
?

-I think it's a good idea. :)

Do you usually just keep collecting your records, and
never get rid of them ? Or do you replace old records
with new ones and sell or give your older stuff away ?

-I usually sell off my records partly cause I get
super broke spells or cause I'm not into the records
anymore. No sense in keeping vinyl I dont ever plan on
playing again.

PORTUGAL REMOVES IMPRISONMENT
FOR USE OF ALL DRUGS

The new law, enacted by the Socialist government on July 1, eliminates the=

threat of prison for possession of personal supplies of any drug. Drugs=20
remain illegal, however - their possession is just no longer an=20
imprisonable offence. Fines may still be applied, or community service. And=
=20
a single joint could send you to the anti-addiction commission!
Possession of up to 10 "daily doses" is personal, not punishable by=20
imprisonment, but holding more than that is evidence of dealing. A "daily=20
dose" is generally less than what serious users actually consume, however,=
=20
so in practice anyone with more than a few days' doses still risks prison.

>From Fraser Clark's YOU UPGRADE mag:


PORTUGAL REMOVES IMPRISONMENT
FOR USE OF ALL DRUGS

The new law, enacted by the Socialist government on July 1, eliminates the
threat of prison for possession of personal supplies of any drug. Drugs
remain illegal, however - their possession is just no longer an
imprisonable offence. Fines may still be applied, or community service. And
a single joint could send you to the anti-addiction commission!
Possession of up to 10 "daily doses" is personal, not punishable by
imprisonment, but holding more than that is evidence of dealing. A "daily
dose" is generally less than what serious users actually consume, however,
so in practice anyone with more than a few days' doses still risks prison.

Although, if they're within the 10-dose limit, first offenders will
normally have their punishment suspended, anyone caught with any quantity
of drugs must appear within 72 hours before one of the country's 18
anti-drug-addiction commissions. After a hearing, those bodies can impose
punishment such as a fine of up to $250 or revocation of a driver's
license. Commissions also provide medical help and counseling about the
dangers of drug use.
Drug trafficking remains punishable by up to 25 years' imprisonment. The
sale of even a single dose of a drug to a friend is considered dealing.

Fines may not be leveled against addicts at all because of concerns that
they'd steal to pay them.
Foreigners will be required to appear before the commissions, and police in
their own countries may be notified.

"A SORT OF THIRD WAY"

"We're trying a sort of third way between the hard approach of the United
States and the soft approach of countries like Holland," said Vitalino
Canas, Portugal's drug policy czar. "We are not allowing any legal use of
drugs. It's not the same as in Holland.. We think most people who try
Ecstasy or hashish will not try other drugs, but some will, so the system
should not leave these people alone."

The stated philosophy is that traffickers are criminals who should be
punished, but users are victims who should be helped.

Police appear to be more likely to take action against casual users. The
government hopes such young people would benefit from getting picked up by
the police. "Drug users are not criminals but the victims of crime, and
should be helped like other victims of crime" said Canas.


"PORTUGAL - SUN, BEACHES'N ANY DRUG YOU FANCY?"

"There will be planeloads of students heading for southern Portugal to
smoke marijuana and take a lot worse, knowing we won't put them in jail,"
predicts Conservative Popular Party leader Paulo Portas. "We promise sun,

While Canas insists that Portas "knows this is not true," he admits that

arresting casual drug users "because they knew that if they got a young guy

        Hiya. . .


    ok, so. . .  could someone help me here pretty please and explain =
this to me. . .=20


    I want Miva merchant 4.0 shopping cart
   =20
    I guess I need a merchant account through my bank. . .what does this =
merchant account do for me ? Until a couple hours ago, I thought the =
merchant account processed and deposited internet payments, then I =
looked around a little more, and I found out that I needed a "payment =
gateway" in addition to my shopping cart and merchant account, which did =
the actual processing and verification.


    How does this work ? Does anyone have exp. in this ? I'm a little =
confused as to which part the merchant account service and the payment =
gateway play as far as processing payments via internet go.

    Is the payment gateway, basically just a secure server that would =
process the credit card info, then the merchant account takes it from =
there and deposits the $$ into the specified bank account ?


    if someone can give me a full complete explanation of how this all =
works, I'll totally buy you some records or something. . .  or if anyone =
knows of a site that details the processes, I'd be totally grateful. . . =


    I really don't have time to read ANOTHER book right now. . . and =
csr's don't seem to have the time to detail any of this. . .=20

    I'll appreciate any and all help. . .=20

thanks a TON. . .really. . . like lots n lots. . .=20

take care

aryck

I hafta like go and not be stressed out now  : )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] rave bans - ecstasy bill

Very good point made....I agree with you %100. 
Promoters shouldn't be held responsible.  However,
I've been to concerts where they search also...but I
think they are mostly looking for weapons.  On that
note, I do think that a search before going into
events (parties, raves, concerts, whatever) is a
*great* idea.  But I don't think it should be as
extensive as a pat down.  I think that they should be
looking for weapons alone.  

In my opinion, any harm that you inflict on others
(ie, with weapons) you should be held accountable
for...and any harm you inflict on yourself (ie, doing
drugs) is enough punishment in and of itself.


On a sidenote...I saw Angel Alanis last night....he
was amazing.  This is the second time I've seen him
spin out and he has yet to disappoint. :)

Have a great day everyone!

Subject: [sfraves] (SF) Andy C // Info on DNA Lounge // For the Geeks

Whats up-

ok so tonite in SF is Andy C, as i'm sure you've
heard... what you 
haven't
hread more about is the venue. the DNA Lounge is one
of the oldest 
clubs
in SF, which has recently gone thru a complete gutting
out and 
remodeling. go to
www.dnalounge.com to check it out..

the owner is a guy named Jamie, who used to work for
Netscape, kind of
shy, kind of quiet, kind of goth.. anyway, he bought
this club and for 
the
past year has been rebuilding the place, and has
documented everything
he's done on the website. if you can figure out who he
is, make sure 
you
tell him how awesome the place is.

www.dnalounge.com/backstage/remodeling.html

a couple cool things: on the webiste, theres a
description of the
soundsystem, built and tested from the ground up, for
all you geeks, 
pictures of every piece of
hardware and how it works with all the other pieces.

and the sound... wow. this is most definitely the best
sound system in 
all
of SF. one person i know wept with joy upon hearing
dnb being played in
there, it sounded so hot.

www.dnalounge.com/backstage/sound.html

there are internet kiosks all throughout the club,
with internet/shell
access, for those of you who want to check vital stats
of your servers 
at
home, or just use pine.

another important thing- this club is NOTHING like
1015 or 550 
Barneveld.
you won't find any fucking glitter cowboy hats, house
music sluts, or
etards here. it hasn't been invaded by the bridge and
tunnel crowd- 
yet.

The Groundscore crew and extended family has worked
really hard to get 
the
word out about Andy C coming here, so please come out
tonite and 
support,
you won't regret it.


The Summer - SF

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nlr: anyone have DSL that works ?

www.dslreports.com has been pretty helpful.

I was just tortured nonstop by Pacbell for 10 days with a badly botched
install, & I'd say avoid them at all costs. I don't want to even get started
describing how horrible it was dealing with the 398 totally inept
organizations and individuals involved in a single PacBell install, how much
time I spent on hold reaching them, or the fact that they apparently can't
communicate with each other without losing information or making a mistake.
I ended up cancelling the order. I am so grateful I didn't get stuck in a 1
year contract with them. Maybe I was just unlucky, but dayum.

Having said that, Telocity just raised prices 25%, most broadband providers
are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy or are already bankrupt, and in the
end PacBell owns the lines.

I'd recommend AT&T cable, based on how much more organized they are. Plus
you get a static IP address included and free technician install (handy if
there are signal problems). With PacBell, you can get either PPPoe for $50
and free self-install, or Enhanced with 5 static IPs for $65, no inbetween.
BUT if you want Enhanced, you have to pay $200 for a compulsory technician
install. That's ridiculous, if you can do it yourself but they don't let
you.

Or better yet, move next door to a Starbuck's. They have high speed wireless
broadband access through MobileStar, it absolutely rocks, and it costs only
$29.95 unlimited access per month. Plus you can use it in any Starbuck's in
the Bay Area (or outside if you're close by, like next door or across the
street.)

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: eX-Girl

Some friends told me about eX-Girl months ago and gushed about the 
energetic experience they had. So I hauled out to the Great American 
Music Hall in SF to see this band kick off their US tour. I was not 
disappointed.

$12 got me my ticket. I joined my friends at the front of the stage. 
The trio of ladies known as eX-Girl were busy fixing and rigging the 
stage with their instruments completely dolled up in short white gogo 
boots and silver shimmering tour jackets. The 200+ crowd of 20 to 30 
somethings with perpetual youth-fixations bustled about oblivious to 
what would happen to them in five minutes or so. The lights then dim 
and M's unforgettable "Pop Musik" intro heralds the landing of the 
mother ship. From behind and both sides the eX-Girls Carmen Miranda 
their way to the stage all the while dancing as seductively as one 
can while wearing abominably huge candyish-looking headresses that I 
only later realized were brightly colored maimed frog corpses. Yes, 
on their heads.

The band takes the stage and with lights and silence demands 
attention and suspense before they launch into a strange hypnotic 
operatic vocal harmony that tells the audience that the frog king is 
trying to get back to his home planet. Suddenly the band lurches into 
an all vocal intro that sounds like Bobby McFerrin giving the beatbox 
treatment to a Metallica tune. Angry guitar foreboding bass and 
crushing drums bring on the mayhem and the rest is a blur.

The show that follows in one of amazing contrasts. Full grown adult 
frog-worshipping women shed their silver full length spaceman tour 
jackets to reveal the cutest bright yellow dresses with glittering 
decapitated frog heads. They then proceed to churn out heavily 
droning, and more often bombastic grooves layered with operatic vocal 
harmonies not heard much in pop since the days of glam and from the 
likes of groups like Queen, Bowie, etc.. The band has been compared 
to Diamanda Galas, Zappa, B-52's, Nina Hagen, Devo, Talking Heads and 
Laurie Anderson. Yet this band makes such a visceral connection that 
it's really hard to intellectualize them or even  want to 
intellectuallize them. You want to, but you shouldn't. The 
order/disorder of Devo really comes across as the girls at times 
robot dance their way through songs at odd time signatures only to 
intantly break off into a fit of chaos and discord. Back and forth.

Their charm is undeniable. I know of know other band that takes 
another band's song, M's "Pop Musik" in this case, and not only 
covers it, but makes it their anthem. Not a bad choice for an anthem 
really, the perfect choice for this band. Their instruments are 
almost as big as they are. The bassist, Kirilo thumps her gourgeous 
white bass guitar fixed with diamond mirrors, while the guitarist, 
Chihiro wields her axe and shakes her shaggy mane like the heaviest 
cock rocker. The drummer, Fuzuki and arguably the cutest eX-Girl, 
stands for the whole set, only playing a two piece kit w/cymbals and 
a machine full of dozens of knobs.

The band starts out singing "Get 5 things and mix those up. It'll be 
fuel for the plane to get back home sweet planet frog" and ends by 
singing "If something new you want, just mix up what you have now." 
eX-Girl are making the only sense they know how.

Two things:

AT&T broadband has switched to DHCP - no static IP's any more

Not all starbucks even have computers - why would they all have broadband?

pacbell (sbc) is the worst group of fucking idiots i've ever had the
displeasure of dealing with.  they can barely handle our single regular 
phone line with any degree of competence, so i really shouldn't have been
surprised that two weeks and over 20 hours on the phone speaking to
4 or 5 different organizations within the company after what was
supposedly a successful installation, not one packet had been transmitted
to or from our house.  avoid the provenance of ineptitude that is pacbell
by all means.

also, last i heard pacbell is only doing PPPoE from now on.  which is dumb.

we cancelled our order with pacbell and signed up with flashcom, which
subsequently went out of business.  but they transitioned us over to
speakeasy.net, and things have been perfect ever since.  that was many
months ago.

our experience with speakeasy has been ideal.  we get a (unoffcial) static
ip and 608/128 RADSL for $50/month.  they are responsive, friendly,
intelligent, and *solvent*.  they go through covad, but have agreements
with other companies should covad go completely under.

i would highly recommend speakeasy to anybody looking for dsl.

Subject: [sfraves] sex, money and our scene, honeeeeey. :) nrr

yesterday, i had an interesting conversation with one
of my very favorite mystics. we talked about sex and
money... a popular subject in our little community...
she said that all the men want is sex and money, and
that i should stay away from the men and the bars. :)
kind 
of hard for me to do, considering, i love men, and a
lot of good music and good men happen to be at the
bars..
however, there is some wisdom to be found in her
words..true, a lot of men and women..i never forget
about the ladies :) :) :)...
are all about sex and money, so it is good to be aware
of that and to be careful. i don't like to get my sex
or 
my money from sick sources. i have a firm belief in a
lot of things that are not seen, but are known if you
listen 
to your own heart. i don't know what i am doing yet
this weekend. i have been ill for a bit, and am in
good health 
at the moment. i hope that you all will be safe and
that you will look after one another as best as you
can,
even if that means that you cannot be in the company
of anyone until you get your act together. better to
volunteer 
for that solitude you've been longing for than to be
placed in solitary confinement or a box before your
time is up.  :)

Yep- that sums it up- I was "with" Pacbell for almost a year, until they
finally decided to waive my $200 "early cancellation fee" so I could finally
tell them to fuck off and go with someone else.

I am now with, and completely recommend Speakeasy: http://www.speakeasy.net/
(And they pipe you thru InterNAP too)

Subject: [sfraves] My first few days at SF State!


Hey Everyone what's up, well today was officially my 1st day of sf state. I 
wake up every morning at 5am to catch the bart and bus to school 1 hour and 
20 minutes away. In the beginning I was scared because I would for the 1st 
time in my life be leaving my home and traveling on my own, depending on 
nobody but myself to get to where I needed to go. 2 of my favorite classes 
so far are Hatha yoga and Tai-Chi, I don't know anyone else who goes there 
but I hope I do meet some people soon, I am so very interested in meeting 
and finding out differnent things about others, especially those in this 
list who are attending. Well, I hope there's no bart strike this week cuz I 
reallyt enjoy taking bart and that's my only form of transportation right 
now.
Much Love and Respect,

Steph  *925-778-6716*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sex, money and our scene, honeeeeey. :) nrr - He Said, She Said

I, too, also had an interesting convo. with my seer.
The topic was about women & sex, my two fav things in
the world. See, straight men can't do a thing in this
world if it doesn't lead up to the two fav things in
their world: women & sex. We drive fast cars, try to
make fast money (or a lot of money), develop new,
designer drugs, build smaller video cameras, bigger
harddrives, get a faster Internet connection, and buy
fast computers all in the name of women & sex. Whether
there's actually a woman involved is besides the
point. There was no other single, greater motivating
reason in the world to develop broadband except for
the simple reason to be able to watch a (FREE) porno
stream of a dude's fav porn star in its entirety and
to download all the porn in the world to your heart's
desire. Any man who tells you differently is only
doing so cause he wants you to think he's a civilized
man, yet, were it not for the prurient drives of
ancient man, civilization would be just a wet dream,
for what better way to meet a lot of chicks if not
putting them all in one place? In the immortal words
of Commodus Rex, "...for all that man does, they know
not..."

The last piece of advice my seer gave me before going
to bed with his woman was, "...don't think about it so
much or you'll go blind you f'g perv..."

Have a great Labor Day weekend!

Starting when? I hate PPPoE, although having a router makes it less
annoying. But I got a static IP yesterday included with my install.  Maybe
it varies by area (though why would it?? Puzzling.)

http://www.mobilestar.com/starbucks_update.asp

You need your own laptop and it has to have a wireless card installed,
either internal or PCMCIA. It's outrageous that they don't advertise this
more... I was sitting on a brownstone stoop at midnight in New York City
across the street from a SB's and sending files back to Sunnyvale at T1
speed when the broadband connection in my hotel went down. It's a lifesaver
when you need to get something done and they have 600-some wireless access
point locations across the US.

I don't really care for Starbuck's but MobileStar is great.

Just to give a different perspective...i've had absolutely no trouble w/ Pac
Bell DSL.  From when we first called they gave an estimate of 3 weeks to get
it all installed.  We got the DSL Modem a few days after that initial call,
plugged it in and it already worked!

Sure it has PPPoE but I've had no trouble with that either...Mac OS X is
nice and has it built into the OS :).

Its damn fast too...1.4 mb downloads on a regular basis.  Only problem with
pacbell is that their relay server is open to all so some ISPs reject email
coming from it because it is a spam source.

Ok, bye!

Subject: [sfraves] DEMF

Hey guys,

I finally figuerd out how to use DreamWeaver and HomePage so I posted my
pictures from DEMF (Detroit Electronic Music Festival) it was a great
time...there are just a few since I ran out of memory on my camera, but
check 'em out if you want! :)

Just so you know DEMF is the largest EDM festival int he US.  In 2000 the
inagural year they expected 100,000 and got 1,000,000.  I haven't seen stats
from this year's but for all purposes it was way more packed.  I hope next
year it'll be good (but it wont since they fired Carl Craig...those
bastards)

Actually...i just checked the site...most of the pictures are mad
blurry...but you can look for fun anyways...I have some cool shots
(104-0485_IMG.JPG down near the bottom).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nlr: anyone have DSL that works ?

Hey,

I had DSL in Chico (180 miles from here) through PacBell and it was great - 
no installation woes, fast, reliable speed, only got disconnected once or 
twice, over more than a year.. so bay area pac bell might suck.. or (it was 
over a year ago) they might have gone down the toilet.. but it's not all bad...

Get this peeps... I work for an ISP that used to sell DSL via Pacific Bell..
Pacific bell is now disconnecting DSL users that are more than 15,000 feet
from the CO.  They dont care if it works correctly or not.  They have
already dont this to a few of our customers..  Whatever you do.  NEver call
into Pacbell for issues regarding your DSL if you know your circuit is more
than 15,000 out of the CO.. Just some Friendly advice..

Not that I don't believe you -- PacBell and SBC are rude and evil in many 
ways and incompetent in others (I might be down but my neighbor isn't, and 
the tech support people claim an area wide outage)...

but why are they doing it? and can you provide some references so I can 
check this out for myself?

Subject: [sfraves] THANKS, you all are just so dope. . . 

OMG it took me soooooOOOoo long to go through all the emails I got back
about the dsl, and the merchant accounts, and the vinyl questions. . .
Ravers are like just fuckin SICK !!! I love you guys. . .

heres some things I've decided. . .

    I've decided on a 45 sec to one minute sample of each track, some tracks
maybe longer, but some of the vinyl I have has like 2-3 tracks on each side.
. .
    For some records, I'll record a sample at both 33 and 45 rpm so the
people who spin their stuff faster can hear what a normal record sounds like
sped up a bit. This will probably all take a little extra space on my
server, but that shouldn't be a biggie. . .

>
> >     Do you usually search the stores by label name ? artist name ? or
> > title ?

    I'm going to have a search engine, and set it up to search all 3, along
with listing of ea by label. . .

> >     Is it important to you to have a pic of the sleeve of the record
> > (if it's a graphic sleeve) ?

    I was just asking here. . . maybe some "special" release vinyl mught
have a gif with it but the majority of the vinyl I sell come in graphicless
sleeves anyway. .

>

> > think they're lacking ? What do you wish they had ?

    I'm goiung to try to be as direct as possible, and ephasize simplicity
in finding the tracks you want as much as possible. I'm re thinking my lil
graphical approach to my site and the vinyl section will be mostly text and
links. . .
    Some vinyl may or may not have descriptions, but the ones I usually read
tend to be kinda misleading, so I'll let the samples do most of the talking.
Daily updates are important so I'll have new relese sections, specials,
discounted items, package deals, and a few other ideas. . .

> >     Would you be willing to sign up to a sort of vinyl club, where for

    I don't like the idea of having too much of a committment myself (plus
it's helluva lotta work for me). I'll set up some of my personal and perhaps
various DJ recommendations for various genres of vinyl (everythings mostly
going to be harder, d&b, hardcore, hhc, nrg). I'll figure this out as I go
and ask for peoples recommendations. If possible, when I get going, I'll
have like DJ ??? picks of the week, etc (something along that line).

> >     Do you think it would be useful to have a forum where dj's sell,
> > buy and trade their older or unwanted vinyl ?
    To start, I'll set up an email list designed for trading and discussion
of vinyl. I don't know if a web board will be useful. . . maybe something
like one of those free for all links pages (or something liek that), where
people could post their items and sell them (similar to crasgslist). These
people will definately have to be approved, and there will have to be some
sort of quality assurance if I can find a simple way to administer that.

>

    This was a general question. . . but in addition to new vinyl, I
personally like lil odd records from here and there places with like nursery
rhymes, audio samples etc, and you normally don't find too many of those
new.

    THANKS ALL. . .

it'll be a lil while before that's set up, but I wanted to figure out all
the background stuff so I can start with a solid base. I've been in some
sort of CSR position since my first job when I was 14 (x-ray equip service
in hospitals). So naturally I'm more customer oriented and not as concerned
with my own personal gains as I am with keeping as many other people happy
as I possibly can. So input it ALWAYS appreciated. . . required actually. .

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nlr: anyone have DSL that works ?

OK Sorry for the NRR but I gotta chime in my 2 cents about this.

Pac Bell is an ILEC that has a lot of subscribers and has a bad habit of
over subscribing themselves. The real problem is the facilities ( Wire
and cross connects between you and the CO ) ADSL will go to @ 17K feet
if the facilities are in good working order. This usually means that it
is in an area that is not to old like 40+ years. There are ways around
all this.
(OK Here comes the pitch) 
Despite all the things you have heard about Covad (Chapter 11, gone bye
bye, broke etc....) We are here to stay. We will be out of debt and cash
flow positive before it will effect anyone's DSL lines. We have the best
engineering staff around (That's what I do at Covad) and pride ourselves
as having the best service, and the only (Yes ONLY) Nationwide DSL
network. We provide SDSL, ADSL, IDSL and more technologies very soon
(ILECS only provide ADSL) and our waiting times are very short (if you
ever have to call um). You can use one of our ISP's or you can go
straight to Covad. We have a few different types of packages depending
if you want a Consumer ADSL or a Business SDSL. (Hint if you want to do
streaming make sure you upstream speed is fast enough, most low-end ADSL
upstream speeds are only 128Kbps)I have 2 SDSL 1.5's here at the
groovefactory studio.
Plus "if" you have a problem with you line you can email me and I can
help out.


Try us out www.covad.com

If you are a DJ and get a line email me if you want to start some
broadcasts from your home, groovefactory has one of the largest
streaming networks around and we are always looking for some new
broadcasts.

Yes! Yes!!! That was exactly my experience! No exaggeration... over 20
hours on the phone is absolutely correct.

Omigod, I'm not alone.
