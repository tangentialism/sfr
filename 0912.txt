[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from Berlin:

::: ARGY :::

(Poker Flat . These Days . Objektivity . Cocoon)
(Raum...Musik . Liebe*Detail . Defected)

Since exploding onto the scene in 2005 with his unforgettable
"Love Dose" EP on Poker Flat, Argyris Theofilis aka Argy has,
in the years since, earned himself a spot in dance music's
upper echelons through a tireless devotion to the "deeply
musical, yet strikingly state-of-the-art" tech house music he
loves.  Now, several releases and a slew of remixes and
collaborations later on top labels like Raum Musik,
Liebe*Detail, Defected, and Cocoon, Argy brings his widely-
renowned DJ prowess to [KONTROL] in his SF debut!


and from NYC via Berlin:

::: FUNCTION :::

(Sandwell District . Infrastructure . Synewave . Ostgut Ton)

Dave Sumner aka Function has been a respected name in the
techno world for over a decade.  In addition to classic mid-'90s
releases on Synewave and follow ups on his own Infrastructure
label, he was also the mysterious figure behind many of the
"User" records lovingly hammered by Richie Hawtin during his
"Decks, EFX & 909" period. Now living in Berlin, Dave has
gone on to set up the highly regarded and immensely popular
Sandwell District imprint with frequent collaborator Regis.
Another long overdue SF debut!

ARGY

Electronic music producers are very special individuals, not only do some
have the skills, tools and ideas necessary to imagine, write and produce
their music, some totally represent it, they share it, they travel it and
the most dedicated simply live it.

Argy, aka Argyris Theofilis, born of Rhodes, Greece, is one of these
artists, if not the epitome of this way of life. Ultimately dedicated to hi=
s
work, his passion is clear whether he's speaking through words or through
his deeply musical, yet strikingly state-of-the-art House music.

Born in 1985, the young man rose to immediate notoriety after his
breakthrough into the upper ranks whilst living in London, with his debut
"Love Dose" EP on Poker Flat in 2005. Since then, a series of detailed,
lovingly expressed cuts followed on Poker Flat, Raum Musik, Liebe*Detail,
Cocoon, Deeply Rooted House and Cargo Edition (as Jobim's Cousin), proving
his ability to create a diverse range of innovative yet functional sounds.
At the same time as producing new releases, and delivering numerous
stand-out remixes for labels as revered as Ibadan, Simple and even Defected=
,
Argy's DJ persona truly came alive, seeing him grace some of the most
respected and sought after DJ booths in the world.

Since his first electrifying affairs with night-time culture as an early
teenager, including memorable club experiences headed by the U.S. House
scene's finest, he was fascinated with the boldness and the power that the
DJ could communicate with an audience. Indeed, it was the dedicated
concentration of the DJ, and in turn the energetic response of the crowd,
that locked him onto dreams of performing such wonder himself. Three years
ago, after his first visit to Berlin's Panorama Bar, Argy had found a new
inspiration, and a new dancefloor for which to design his productions. He
counts the venue as the most intimate of locations to share his music.

2007 saw Argy's growth as an artist reach new heights, as his increasingly
busy touring schedule, accompanied by the hit "Unreliable Virgin" on Sven
V=E4th's Cocoon imprint, spread his message even farther afield. In 2008,
after a period of concentrated focus in his Berlin Studio, he presents his
first full-length project, with his family label Poker Flat, in the shape o=
f
"Focus On: Argy". There are three important parts to the release; firstly a
unique and superbly unconventional DJ mix, which explores the present, past
and possible future of his sound, secondly, two 12' vinyls featuring six
unmixed, new collaborations with artists such as Solomun, DJ Gregory, Jerom=
e
Sydenham and The Mole to name but a few. Thirdly "Focus On: Argy" highlight=
s
Argy's great ability to give the remixes he's done for other artists his ow=
n
very special touch.

It's a project that he feels very passionate about; the concept aims to
highlight the power and the talent of the various producers he worked
alongside, and the pleasing and almost mythical "third artist" that can
arise from such collaborations, shaping the music in ways otherwise
unimaginable. The album stands as a wonderful snapshot of Argy's abilities
and puts on display the skills that have rocketed him into new realms in
these three short years since his debut release. Coming across on both a
personal and musical level with the kind of clarity and focus that is rare
to find in someone of relatively few years, especially considering the hazy
party culture of the Techno scene, Argy represents the new breed of clear
headed talent, who have proved to be a consistent driving force in modern
electronic dance music.

FUNCTION

One of techno's true underground heroes, Function, real name Dave Sumner,
has been DJing and making music for over 15 years.

Hailing from New York, he was seduced by techno music when Jeff Mills held =
a
residency at the Limelight in the early 90s. Dave started to produce music
and from the mid-90s onwards, put out music on Damon Wild's Synewave and hi=
s
own Infrastructure imprint.

Together with Karl O'Connor aka Regis he worked as Portion Reform, putting
out uncompromising music on Downwards and becoming the only non-Birmingham
producer to release on the label.

More recently, Dave moved to Berlin and, still working with O'Connor, set u=
p
the acclaimed Sandwell District imprint. Featuring releases by Regis/Kalon,
Silent Servant, Female and Ian Richardson, the label is kicking against
minimal blandness with dynamic, harder-edged yet curiously accessible
techno. In particular, Function's own bleep-techno killer 'Isolation' and
the old school-styled follow up, 'Anticipation' are some of the best
releases of the past year. It's little wonder then that Sandwell District
was recently featured as label of the month on Resident Advisor, as well as
being featured in a podcast mixed by Dave himself (with track selection hel=
p
from Regis) which has been met with much praise from critics and fans alike=
.

So far this year the pace has picked up still. He has been featured as one
of Beatport's artists to watch, his 'Anticipation' EP held the number 1 slo=
t
as Juno's top selling techno record for over 6 weeks. And with remixes so
far this year of Miss Kittin and the Hacker and Ben Klock, Function is,
despite his enduring legacy, still an artist very much on the rise.

We were there supporting. Big ups to Granick for putting in good work. Glad
that Matt and Justin got thier much needed stuff back.

Hopefully this case is pursued a complaints will be filed against the Sgt.
Larry Bertrand and the SFPD and this illegal activity by the SFPD will stop.

Good news.

In the Halloween case, did the SFPD offer any justification for the computer seizures?

The lady that was representing the SFPD in court that day was ready to
return the property with no contest as long as the dj's could show proof of
ownership (which was a pain in the ass for some of them)

With that said, Granick tried to present to the court that all these
seizures are ridiculous and illegal but the judge responded with "this court
is only to determine if the property that was seized should be rightfully
returned. Not to determine if officers practices and behaviors were
appropriate. You should bring this up in a law and order court at city hall"
or something along those lines.

I believe Granick is going to help everyone file the lawsuit at the correct
court.

On another note, it was funny watching all the people who appeared to the
judge, before our laptop case, got to approach the bench. I think just about
every case before ours was people trying to get their weed back that had
been confiscated. "your honor, I have my medical MJ card and the police took
my weed and I should have it back"  The judge looks at the mans medical MJ
card and says "ok you can pick up your medicinal  MJ at the property room"
FTW! crazy.

There was one guy who didn't get it back and another guy who was going to
get it back but the SFPD said it was detroyed already. That guy was hella
funny. Telling the court that the lady that represented the SFPD was "doin
me dirty."  From what i understood though the lady did pull some foul shit.
The man was in court debating with her about the case and she had him
removed from the court and cited for some bullshit ( I forgot what) and then
he was cited again for missing the court appearance he was removed from.

foulness.

Granick is an old friend I have on speed dial. 

Smoking hot, and a hell of a lawyer.  Best person to have on your side 
if you are charged with anything computer related.

The whole seizing of laptop is bullshit, especially if you are just 
attending a party and not operating it.

So IANAL however...it sounds like the SFPD screwed the pooch pretty good on this one, because if they had any reason to seize or hold the laptops they would have had to present it at this hearing.  Since they didn't, I expect that the paperwork won't show any reason for the seizure either.  Seems like a good case going forward and they'll have to stop this practice or eventually pay someone some money.  Nice.

However the hosts of the party can still be charged with a misdemeanor and fined it seems even for holding a private event in their own home.

So also the description of the events includes searching purses and back packs as well as seizing the laptops.  What are they looking for?

::::About::::

Afterglow was conceived as a chance to wind down after a long weekend by
listening to some chill music and having a few drinks with friends. The idea
is to allow some of SF's most talented and multi-faceted dance music DJ's an
opportunity to dig deeper into their collections and play music they
wouldn't be able to in a club setting. Anything's game, from ambient and
electronica to dub techno, idm, atmospheric drum & bass, downtempo, future
jazz, deep house and beyond.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Please vote for my snowboard design

Yo Peoples!

This weekend, my girlfriend and I designed a snowboard in honor of my mom.  It's
a contest with REI and Arbor Snowboards - the winning design will
receive a copy of the board and a $1000 REI gift certificate.  

Here's the blurb I wrote to go along with the snowboard:


"
This women's board design was created by my
girlfriend and me in honor of my mother (Mae) who died last year from
stomach cancer.  She and my father introduced me to snow sports, and I'm proud to come full-circle with this cheery and bright tribute to her.

If this design is chosen, I will donate all prize monies to the American Cancer Society in her name.

Thanks!
Michael (the Redstickman)
"

You can vote for the board here (apologies:  you'll need to create a REI account - use a junk e-mail address!)

Thanks!
Michael

Found myself reeling from the near parallel references to SFRaves, Brian,
the Cloud and DoD. In BusinessWeek of all places:

Subject: [sfraves] Dave Trance?

I discovered parties late in the game ('98) and some random party kid let me borrow a tape.  It had DAVE TRANCE written on it and it was my first real experience with trance music.  I'd like to say it opened the doors to me seeking out house, drum and bass and downtempo.

Anyway, when I do a search online, I can't find any reference of this guy.  Have you guys heard of him?

Thanks.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Come Check out some Hip Hop and Glitch

--00504502ad533dc4f2047a51b130
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Howdy everybody, I've been lurking on this mailing list for around a year
now (posted a couple things here and there). I just started up a t61
artist's account and wondered if any of y'all are on the Sixty One. If not
then you're missing out, it's a mix between pandora, facebook and an rpg.
It's pretty goddamn fun. If you're on the sixty one (or if you're not), come
check out some tracks that I stuck up about a week ago and tell me what you
think. The tracks are some excerpts from my latest ep, Roses and Nails. It's
kinda like Old School hip hop and some Glitch and Dub tracks later on. I'm
still putting more up every couple of nights. Check out Nail 2 if you can:
http://www.thesixtyone.com/commonenemy/

Thanks,
-Lazlo

Anyway, when I do a search online, I can't find any reference of this guy.  Have you guys heard of him?

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: huge day on monday with Jeff Mills on the eclektronik groove

Hey everybody!

Some years the holidays get here early, this happens to be one of
those years. One of the Godfathers of techno, Jeff Mills aka "The
Wizard", will be on the show on monday.

When Paul and Chris Leath (Leathal)[1] hit us up at KZSU and asked if
we would be down for having Jeff Mills out after he plays at Project
1 this weekend[2], we were honored that the Wizard would consider
coming to KZSU and that they would think of us. We were also
ridiculously excited at the possibility. Things have come together
and we are super excited to announce that Monday the 14th from 9AM
to Noon Jeff Mills will be featured on the Eclektronik Groove,
hosted by Holt Sorenson and Jack Wang. You can listen to the show
and get more information at: http://hsomusic.com/

Jack will re-broadcast the set on the Big Love show from 3-6pm the same day.

Jeff Mills[3], along with Robert Hood, Carl Craig, and Joey Beltram,
is one of the biggest American names in techno. Championed for his
music's relentless pursuit of hardness and his stripped-down, almost
industrial DJ sets, Mills is the latest in a long line of
Detroit-bred talent to take on an international reputation.

In the 1980s, Mills[4] was an influential radio DJ on WJLB under the
pseudonym "The Wizard." Mills'[5] sets were a highlight of the
nightly show from "The Electrifying Mojo".

In going on to create his own music Jeff Mills[6] is credited with
laying the foundations for the highly influential Detroit Techno
collective, Underground Resistance.

Mills[7] would never leave UR officially, but later on he still went
his own way. He moved to New York and after a short stay in Berlin
(Tresor) ended up in Chicago. There in 1992, with fellow Detroit
native Robert Hood, he set up his most important record label, Axis,
aiming for a simpler more minimal sound than most of the techno
being produced in those years. Later sub-labels were created:Purpose
Maker, Tomorrow, and 6277.

His albums and EPs are mostly separate tracks of his compositions,
which Mills would mix into the live DJ sets for which he became a
legend. Mills has been credited for his exceptional turntable
skills. Tracks are almost chopped to bits to showcase the strongest
fragments for his relentless sound collages. He usually uses three
decks, a Roland 909 drum-machine and up to seventy records in one
hour.

The show will happen at 9AM Pacific/US, 6PM Europe/CET. You can find
the time that the show starts for your timezone here:

I coudl've sworn that drug use wasn't illegal, only possession, though i

This would also probably be much better served by setting it up 
on a free web-based survey service like

i've not issue with anonymity, it's just a might annoying to produce,
specially over the web, you'd have to get very creative, and most people i
know who are hardcore ravers just don't know enough to be truely anonymous,
the list of things you need to do is huge! and we ain't talking purely
technical wizardry either, GL maintaining anonymity against a multi-pronged
DEA assault.

Subject: [sfraves] NYE events? Where you going???

So this year I'm planning on taking off visuals and staying in

asking me what's going on.

Where are you gonna be at, and/or what's poppin' this nye???

I see Tantra, Raindance, and Sea of Dreams...any other 
suggestions???

Private responses with UG info welcomed, I promise I'm not a cop

Same here, the rest of the heroic crew has pretty much been limited to going
out for gigs we're working, so also just looking for some basic fun...
SoArts overnight policy change takes away the one constant we've had, so
what else is everyone going to?  All nighters esp UGs preferred, and I
promise I'm not a cop either. :)

YOU TERRY I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU AND SFRAVES, AND I'MMA LET YOU 
FINISH, BUT I JUST WANNA SAY MY NEW HEAD PHONES ARE THE SHIZ-NIGHT!!!!!!!



Seriously....  just to interrupt....

I got the Pioneer HDJ-200's headphones.  They are amazing. Super light, 
super tight, isolation of the techniques without the weight. 

No wonder they cost an arm and a leg.

Oh, and they're fully serviceable with actual assembly to replace parts 
instead of throw away and get new ones.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Your perspective on Raves

I felt the same way since they came out, then my 1000's broke, again.  
Like, 5th pair to break at the same point.  Decided enough was enough, 
and bit the bullet and ordered a pair.

If you're a fan of the Techniques, I can say they have a very similar 
fit, at about 1/3 of the weight, better isolation, and amazing sound.

The fact they're serviceable parts makes me happy, since I order parts 
for my decks frequently.  Button abuse.  Parts direct from Pioneer are 
pretty cheap.


So yes, they are a serious win.

Dope, cuz I'm in the market right now for new headphones, need 
to replace my Sennheisers. But don't you mean Pioneer HDJ-2000's 
(not 200)? Damn, those are too pricey for me.

I know headphones preferences can be really subjective, but 
does anyone have any recommendations for me in the $100-200 range?

Right now I'm looking at:

Technics RP-DH1200
Pioneer HDJ-1000
Sony MDR-V6/700

Opinions? Additions?

Sony MDR-V700 has disappointing sound, especially the bass (to my ears at
least) in addition to being cheaply constructed.

Hey Terry,

I've broken the swivels on all three of those models, including the Technic=
s
which are supposed to be "re-enforced." (Have pics, and won't GTFO =3DP )Th=
e
only reason I got them at the time is because some idiot @ GC sold was
raving about how they had the same output as the V's and were built "more
rigedly," and how "all the DJ's" were moving in that direction that had
broken their Sony's.

Oh how I loathe the notion of taking advice from a GC salesman, and the one
time I foolishly did.

This is merely subjective, but I've always gone back to the Sony V's becaus=
e
I like the way they sound. I know that's a pretty general rationale,
considering they all have comparable output, but IMHO the Sony's deliver th=
e
most bang for the buck *<* $200. My second fav's are the Pioneers, which I
also broke. Again I stress < $200.

I'm intrigued by the servacible Pioneers, but would def. want to listen to
them before I shelled out the $$.

My advice; pick out a set that's around $150.00, with the intention of
uprgading them in the future after you've had a chance to beat them up. Whe=
n
you play out, ask other DJ's if you could monitor theirs for a second, that
should give you a chance to test them in the field and give you a better
feel for what you're looking for.

.02,

CG

p.s. I'm looking forward to trainspotting you.

Subject: [sfraves] hey it's party season, where's everyone going these next couple 
	weeks?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Not up for anything tonight, but seeing a couple places open reminded me
it's party season!  Looks like NYE's pretty quiet this year, all the more
reason to be going out to other stuff.  What's up Weds/Thurs/Fri/Sat/oh you
know the next couple weeks?  Haven't seen any BSPs I can recall except
techokitchen...

-R.

It's either pioneer or akg for headphones... But as a reply to the paranoia
question... It's really difficult to keep anything secret these days. So in
my opinion, if it doesn't relate to national security or if you are not the
head of an international cartel or slave trade, i wouldn't worry too much.
Oh, and if the police *actually* read this list, I'll meet you at allstars
or nation's  after the party.

He, like most kzsu, is immortal.
Both times I've been at the marathon there's been a big pot of coffee for
the host and tons of beer and snacks for the guests. Jc usually looked
bedraggled but extremely happy most times. Its all about the love for music.
Happy solstice! shouts to jc and holty.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Your perspective on Raves

You can get'em on Amazon for $80 less than Guitar Center.

That'll put you a little over $200, but seriously, you only get one set 
of ears, treat'em good.

That said I was previously a big fan of the HDJ-1000's.  Only issue is 
breakage.  They do last 50x longer than Sony's though.  The Techniques 
are solid, but really heavy. 

These days I look for something I can repair instead of replace, so I'm 
pretty thrilled with the 2000's.

Been grooving to it from Munich, Germany.

Just a quick FYI, sunset around these parts, in the days leading up to

How cool is that?

Wow! It's been about 15 years since I've posted on SFR, and Holt was
really kind to have forwarded me the nice words & comments about the
Solstice Marathon. I'd like to say a few words to all the lovely
folks on these list(s) as a thank-you for all your ongoing support.
Pardon the length of the post - I'm getting older now and I love
telling stories about the past.

The Solstice Marathon was started back in 1992 at KZSU when I was a
student at Stanford and I had just discovered "house" and "techno" and
"raves" and all the good stuff associated with it. It wasn't my idea
to do the Marathon; it was the brainchild of a young volunteer at KZSU
named Josh Bates (DJ Unknown) and his friends Francesco, Troy, and
Anton (DJ Anton Wirjono is now a legend in Indonesia).

In our little friendship circle was our mutual friend Geoff White (who
got me my first job in Silicon Valley), and great DJs like: Spun,
Rick Preston, Harry Who and those Brit DJs like Markie, Garth, Tony
and Jeno. These guys also happened to be in the lineup for those very
first Winter Solstice Marathons in the early '90s.

The initial sound of the Winter Solstice Marathon (like the aesthetic
of the parties of that era) was primarily acid-house and some tribal
house. In those days, KZSU did not have Technics 1200s nor a DJ
mixer. Electronic dance music was not well-supported by the
management of the station - which was very much focused on indie rock
(and still is). The very first Winter Solstice Marathons required us
to supply our own DJ & sound equipment, and we had to connect a 50ft
cable halfway across the studios in order to get on the air. And we
also had to record everything on cassette tapes. Imagine having to
switch tapes every 90 minutes for 24 hours (that was often my job).

But those Winter Solstice Marathons worked out - and I remember
staying up all night with those guys: Josh, Francesco, Troy, Geoff,
Anton, and friends; and occasionally having to drive DJs back & forth
from the City. Those marathons became the stuff of legend, just like
those Full Moon parties on a Santa Cruz beach, for instance. To this
day, I tell the stories of how people drove from places like Santa
Rosa and would rent a motel room overnight in Palo Alto during the
Marathon - just so they could have perfect FM reception in order to
tape the whole thing on their boom boxes. Imagine having to switch
tapes every 90 minutes for 24 hours.

It's just like those stories of Full Moon parties where DJs Markie,
Jeno, & Garth would show up with those crazy Brits, a sound system & a
generator (but someone would forget gas for the generator) at 2AM at
Bonny Doon Beach, then play trippy house & acid all the way till 2PM
the next day. And a couple thousand people would show up, some from
as far as LA - just for the Full Moon parties.

You see, electronic dance music back then in 1992 was SO rare and SO
hard to find - that it truly was special to (a) hear it on the radio
and to get it on tape, and (b) truly special to dance to it on some
beach in Santa Cruz at 2AM. (for free!)

So that said, I've always felt fortunate that I was at there for that
very early explosion of electronic dance music culture back in the
early 90s in the Bay Area. Moreover, I've always felt fortunate that
I was there for those Solstice Marathons at KZSU - because no one else
was crazy enough to host 24 hours of continuous dance-music on the
radio.

I'm often asked if I spin out at clubs/ parties. No, I actually do
not spin beats. Over the years, I've never wanted to. It is not my
art form. (Holt does spin out, however, and he is very good at it).
But I do host my little Monday afternoon program on KZSU with guest
DJs every week, simply because, through the years, I've always thought
it was more important to be a "presenter" of electronic music and to
contribute to the community in that way. That is, I think it's most
important to work to keep dance music on the airwaves in the
"mixed-by-DJs-of-the-underground-without-commercials" format.

And it's been a long struggle to keep working towards that end, at
KZSU. KZSU was, and has always been, run by volunteers (I don't get
paid for any of this), and funded with a very minimal budget, from the
student fees collected from Stanford students annually, and some
donations. Even though KZSU is at the elite institution that is
Stanford University, it is still a non-profit community radio station
that operates on a shoestring budget.

KZSU actually did not have the money to invest in specialized DJ
mixing equipment until around 1997. And, the hip-hop DJs at KZSU did
not help matters - because once we got the equipment, we had to share
it with the hip-hop guys who were very abusive with the gear (and they
perpetuated an isolationist me-first-clique at KZSU). We had to wait
until 2003 to get a DJ rig exclusive to the needs of dance-music.

We dance-music hosts at KZSU to this day have to struggle to maintain
our dignity. The hip-hop guys strut around with their big celebrity
egos (and everybody was afraid to challenge them simply for fear of
being labeled racist) and the punk-rock/heavy-metal guys (oftentimes
they were the music directors) would make fun of our music for being
"gay disco shit". It was common, back in the 90s to find the station
trashed & tagged-up after the hip-hop or punk/metal guys left.
Through the years the hip-hop & punk/metal guys at KZSU have
contributed virtually nothing to the station except for the sake of
their own music. Conversely, you'd see electronica hosts (like Holt &
me) at KZSU volunteering to fix computers & equipment, wire things up,
organize emergency drills, put on campus parties, and even help out
sports broadcasters. We try to give back to the station because the
station gave us the privilege to do our shows & play beats.

So it's important for all the folks in the electronica community to
know that what we do truly is a labor of love. And that we in the
dance music scene are here to perpetuate a culture of positivity and
community. We have fun with it, and it's very rewarding to have your
support.

So please, spread the word and spread the gospel of dance music by
supporting your fellow DJs. Support their music, support their
parties, respect what they do & be proud that you listen to
deep-house, techno, electro, acid, or whatever - because you can be
sure that the hip-hop & punk/metal guys think what we do is "gay disco
shit". And continue to support KZSU. Tell your friends to listen.
If you are willing and able, send KZSU a donation to support the
cause.

Me & Holt & JC will continue to host our shows. I tend to like
straight-up classic house, especially the super-deep stuff of the
David Harness variety. And I will always support the gay scene
equally as much as the straight scene. But I will always love that
good old acid-house and the old-school DJs who play that stuff - and I
do love a good techno pounding once in a while. Holt is a lot like me
but he'll skew a little more towards electro & tech - but when he
plays deep house it's pretty sweet too. JC will definitely play a
little more proggy & ravey than the both of us, but his show is a lot
of fun too. (Holt: Mon 9AM-Noon, Jack: Mon 3-6PM, and JC: Thu
9AM-Noon)

We've pretty much set on doing a marathon for each Summer Solstice and
Winter Solstice - so always mark that on your calendars. Summer
Solstice will focus more on the lovey-dovey sweet deep-house stuff,
while Winter Solstice will focus on harder & darker & techier sounds.
So please tune in.

Also - visitors (especially from SFR or DEF) are always welcome on my
show (Mondays 3-6PM). Please call in during my show (650)723-9010 or
email me to make arrangements to visit KZSU. And if you bring a USB
memory stick or some sort of storage device with a lot of storage
room, I will be happy to fill that up with assorted mixes from the
show(s) or the marathon(s). Any of you want a couple gigs of mixes?
C'mon by. I'd love to meet y'all.

Much love and thanks!

jack
