I would wonder if television had transcended the barrier between opiate =
and religion.  Have the enraptured  masses become devout worshipers of =
another vicious soul-sucking god?  I would wager that the abominable =
machine has a death grip on the majority of minds in our society.

Now gee, let me think,.........

Wouldn't it be terrible if that mind controlling device were to preach =

Not really. When they become more fun for _you_ that says something and 
not neccesarily about raves.

 Lame assumption. Take responsibility for your own reality and learn 
something to change YOUR world rather than relying on others to *learn* 
something to make things better for you.

*ATTENTION* [Since you posted this openly instead of privately that is
how i am responding, although you could have saved bandwih by doing it
privatly, but that's okay. We don't want to do that]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I know what i said in my post, but thanks for reminding me anyway.
Since most (<---KEYWORD) ravers enjoy a positive vibe i believe that
many (<---KEYWORD) other ravers would agree.

Or you can be the black sheep and not be like the majority and not
agree. But don't try to falme we when i didn't say anything negative.
It makes you look (<---KEYWORD)dumb. And that's not godd for you because
you probably (<---KEYWORD) aren't dumb at all.
Make sure you find a negative post to flame if you want to get into a
flame war okay?
Good I am glad we have come to an understanding.
Have fun raving.
Love.Luck.Lollipops,
Paul

I have a public message for all.....

THANKYOU!!

I would like to make a special thank you to all of the people who speak =
out on this list.  You have given me something to think about in times =
where good conversation is hard to find.  I do thoroughly enjoy the =
conflicting view points often expressed on the list, especially because =
I do not necessarily agree with them all.  DIVERSITY OF OPINION IS =
GOOD!!  It is a right we all have that we must NOT down play!  We are =
all very lucky to live in a place where it is acceptable to display =
contrary thought.  I urge all of you silent ones out there(yes I know =
you are out there! :)) to speak thine mind and let us know what you =
think.  Life is so much more interesting if we have something to speak =
of, no?

p.s.  I do NOT encourage flame wars, merely free conversation.  Please =
take mine, and countless other people's advice and think before you =
post.  :)

<3   <3         <3            <3
<3     <3            <3
<3       to all....

That was a cool post and it made total complete sense to me.
Just be carfull because someone will flame you for that post.
Ridiculous isn't it? Flaming a positive post.
They will tear that terrific post apart and twist your words around so
it sounds like you are racist or sexist when you didn't even say
anythign like that at all. If people start to flame you, go ahead and
flame them right back. They will respond, it's just about getting the
last word in. So just simply reply with.
"WOW you're cool because you think differntly than me."
or
"I never knew that. You're smart"
Then it makes them feel stupid.
I personally don't enjoy getting picked on for a post that had nothing
to do with their accusations.
I wish that all the ravers on this list that enjoy flame wars would
un-subscribe or at least not post. Then their would be better vibes on
SFRaves. Hey, it could happen.
"Yeah, and ecstacy will fly out of my but"(<---JOKE do not flame)
So good luck with life and remember...
Rave On!
not
Flame On!
Love.Luck.Lollipops,
Paul

P.S. NO DOUBT someone will flame me for this post. So i will say DON'T
SPEAK!

 I'm with you 100% on this. I think there's an incredibly tacky mindset
happening when a promoter does this, even in a club.

Hi everybody. I thought I'd let you know that I'll be 
spinning in the ambient room at warmth. So, if you make it there,
please come up and say hi. I'll most likely be wearing 
one of my elmo t-shirts, I have blond hair, etc...

Hope to meet some new people...

Try being extremely selective when choosing a party.  This means you are 
not *required* to go out every weekend.  Find out what DJ's/live acts 
make you feel best when dancing.  Also, going to parties to hear DJ's you 
have never heard before can be an educating and enjoyable experience.  If 
you listen to the same six DJ's every time you go out, I can't think of a 
quicker way to get burned out.

Drugs can get boring too -- even psychedelics.  If you do drugs, save 
them for a particular time and place.  And if that party is not living up 
to your expectations, don't feel like you have to do them.  No one *has* 
to do drugs.  I find that I typically have a better time and remember the 
evening more if I stay sober.  I can fall into deeper trance states on 
the dancefloor when I am sober if the DJ/artist is creating a good vibe 
and telling a story that takes me to other worlds.

Eat light, take naps, feel the music.  Try not to be critical of the 
people around you.  Even if you have been going for years, you too were 
new to underground dance music and events at one point in time.  I'm not 
saying that this was any way implied by your post, but I see that in a 
lot of people who have been going to parties for quite some time.  If I 
remember how things were when I started going out, people were quite 
receptive to new people and influences and MUSIC.

One thing I do enjoy is travelling, but especially to cities with newer 
or fresher(literal) scenes.  People in smaller scenes remind me of how 
wonderful it can be just to escape to a world of kind people, DIFFERENT 
music and spiritual release through dance.  These scenes are not far.  
Almost all big cities have scenes.  Most of the smaller cities have them 
too.  If you can grab onto the excitement of these people, it is like 
being reborn (almost).  You do have to find this feeling yourself, but 
seeing it helps.

> ....  What I particuarly DON"T LIKE is the feeling of
>> forced sexuality I get when a promoter purposley puts girls in cages or
>> skimpily clad girls on stage to dance. 


The last couple of times that I've been to parties where I have seen cages,
the cages have just /been there/, and people have had the option to dance in
them or not dance in them.   But I guess sometimes the promoters hire people
to do it, huh?

I, too, feel a bit uncomfortable being nearby when it's going on, but I
guess it makes people feel sexy, and I guess there's nothing wrong about
that.   Kinda like the whole S&M thing.  I don't understand  it; and
probably won't ever ask anyone to give my bum a spankin', but some people
get a kick out of it.

Last weekend my band played at this party called the Burning P*ssy,   (they
were Burning Man folks throwing the party), and the highlight of the show
was a woman dancing around  and thrusting her crotch, which had a sparkler
mounted to it.  I didn't understand it, and I don't understand the whole
Burning Man desire to burn things, but then again, most people don't
understand why ravers dance till the sun comes up, so I need to give 'em
some slack.   I don't think there's anything wrong with being sexy or
show-offy, but I agree that raves are  probably not an appropiate place to
do it.

But then again, my Mum, living up in Puritan New England, would think that
woman who wear "belly button shirts", like some ravers do,  is "sl*tty".  So
I guess it's all personal opinion, you know?

A bientot, Alligator.

     14 Overdose at Teen Dance 

   Fourteen children aged 12 to 17 are in Boston-area hospitals today after
apparently overdosing on a muscle relaxant last night at a dance, police
said. Hospital officials say ten of the victims, mostly girls, are in serious
condition, many of them on life-support systems. Police found some of the
muscle relaxants, called baclosen, and an empty bottle at the ``Teen
Supreme'' dance at the Boys and Girls Club in Woburn, Mass., about 20 miles
north of Boston. Police were investigating how the children got the drug,
which one hospital official said is commonly used to treat multiple
sclerosis.

Hi-

If you're 21 and weren't at ninja tune last night, you really missed
out.
All four dj's rocked the house with their INSANE scratching skills and
funky music. This is just the kind of show I needed: down-tempo and a
splash of jungle- shaken not stirred. 

see you somewhere in the city tonight...

 Well thats really funny. In the first place I was addressing you openly 
as the sloppy logic in your post is all to prevelant and more than a few 
people can learn from this exchange.

 In the second place your shifting responsibility (again). If you think 
this is a waste of bandwidth (I don't) than take it offlist. I'll be happy 
to follow suit.

 If you post publicly you should be prepared to discuss and even defend 
your perspective. I think this kind of interaction is a wonderful 
oppertunity for folks to explore communication possibilities.

 I wasn't reminding you, I was performing a courtesy by including the 
remarks I was responding to. This was for your benefit (memory is not 
always accurate for most folks) and for the benefit of other readers who 
may not have read your post.

 Agree to what?

 Agree to what? You? And I'll tell you... I'm am soooo glad I am not like 
the majority.

 I wasn't flaming. I am engaged in a discussion with you. Just because I 
may not agree with your idea(s) does not mean your being flamed. It's not 
what you say (so much) as how you say it. If you wish to see an example 
of a flame just ask. I can do it privately or publicly.

 In your opinion of course. Personally, I'm not very concerned how you 
see me. Sorry.

 I'm soooo glad you have my best interests foremost in your brain.

 Is this a flame war (scratching head)? strange, I don't feel warm at all.

The other night on the news here in Chicago (they have a web page at 
<http://www.nbc5.com> but the HealthWatch area doesn't have this story 
yet) was the announcement of a new report from one of the local 
universities (U.I. Chicago perhaps?). The study was in the use of small 
amounts of GHB to aid in improving sleep for the elderly. They're trying 
to link the extended deep sleep time that GHB provides to improved cell 
regrowth. (Basically, they were saying that controlled use in this manner 
could help extend life expectency by encouraging the body to repair 
itself better as it does during youth.)

Anybody seriously interested in this issue should probably make sure that 
a copy of the report lands in the hands of the politicians involved. They 
would definately not be trying to schedule a "fountain of youth" drug.

 Positivness is in the eye of the beholder.

 Interesting logic. Saying any of the replies you mentioned above might 
make you feel stupid; I think you are way off to be speaking for 
everyone else though.

 That's funny, I've never seen (what i would consider anyway) an 
inappropriate response to your posts. There are some very intelligant 
and experienced people on this list. I consider it a privlage, and am 
thankful for, if they take the time to engage me in a discussion (after 
getting really pissed off of course ;). Not ever disagreement to you is 
a flame. Believe it or not I am thankful for your posts. Maybe you would 
like to respond as to why you think I would be? (we can take it off list)

 Why? So you could be blissfully happy in your own private reality. Sorry 
but I can only respond; Grow Up.

 And some may feel that the vibe would increase if you left and stopped 
whining about how terrible you get treated.

> SPEAK!

 Trying to be the moderator for this list when you are an obviously 
inexperienced poster with absolutly no idea on how to embrace 
diversity, will get you flamed really quickly. Especially as you have no 
right to try to censor people. Expressing your opinions are one thing, 
but telling anyone who disagrees with you to shut up is rude and 
immature. Again, grow up.

 Embracing diversity means (among other things) being humble enough to 
entertain the idea that you may be wrong and someone else may be right.

peas and hominy.

Well, I am home right now, just kickin it in my room....I hope everyone is
having the time of their life at Warmth/Analog/Basics or wherever you ended
up...I wanted to go to Analog, but after realizing that Choice...San
Francisco was throwing Basics, thats where I'd really want to be.....but oh
well, there'll be another party next weekend. There'll always be another
party, but the experience is always unique to each and every party I go to.
I keep a log of all the parties I have gone to, what substances I took, and
where the party was, and its a trip to look back and reminis. Places I have
gone and people I have seen. I keep a flyer collection as well, and I love
looking through the pages of all the parties I have gone to. "The rave that
never happened" or "The rave that I got hooked up at" or "my first rave or
UG". So much stuff goes down chasing parties. Its such an adventure. Right
now I am listening to my PHAT Jeno tape (Come-Unity 4-3-96), and it brings
back memories of The Gathering back in Sping '96. That night was definitly
an adventure. Take care everyone. 

PLUR,
Ryan

Hey people -

Negativity follows.

I have very bad things to say about Space Children right now, but am going
to endeavour to be diplomatic.  Here is what my evening was like:

At 8pm, Sarah & I have tickets to Space Children's "Analog" and am excited
- I've not been to a large party in ages, and the lineup looks great, and
Space Children has a good reputation.

The voicemail is reassuring - to paraphrase, "people with presale tickets
will be guaranteed a place in our party", "advance ticket holders won't
have to wait in line", etc.

We decided to take a nap.  It had been a long day, and we wanted to have
lots of energy for the night.  So after a long nap, by the time we were
ready to go to the party it was about 1:30.  Just to be safe, I called the
voicemail - it contained a somewhat apologetic sounding message which
stated that they had closed the doors at 1am, and were no longer letting
anyone in.

Thinking surely they couldn't be referring to advance ticket holders, we
headed down there anyway.  Bad idea.  We were not only turned away, but we
were given NO apology, NO explanation, NO refund, NO chance to talk to 
a promoter or anyone otherwise affiliated with the organization of the 
event, and were treated rudely by the bouncers.  We witnessed the same
thing happening to several other presale ticket holders, as well, and were
FAR from impressed.

I understand that bad things happen from time to time - for all I know,
Space Children had a very good reason not to let anyone in after 1am.  But
"we were hoping everyone would get there before 1" (the current voicemail
apology) is not a good enough excuse for me.  For twenty dollars, I
deserve at least an explanation of why I was stranded downtown.

So space children:

 . If you oversold, own up to it.  If there's some other explanation, I
   want to hear it.
 . Don't hide behind rude, ignorant security guards.  If you're going to
   turn people away, do it face to face, and have explanations, apologies,
   and refunds on hand.
 . Don't expect to see me at any of your future events.
 . Feel free to call me, I'd love to talk about this.  (415) 552-4105,
   leave a message.
 . Update your stupid web page ;)  <-- ok, that wasn't so diplomatic :)

Nonetheless, I hope it was a good party.  Hope everyone had fun, who got
in.

On a more positive note, we stopped by Warmth while we were down there,
and it looked awesome.  Wish I'd chosen more wisely, but live & learn.

Take care all, thanks for listening, & see you around.

I'm feeling very shiny in the surprising morning sunshine, and want to give
props to Gateway for reminding us that they know how to do things right,
the NYE glitch being just that.

The VM didn't go on until after 10, but it was a good new map point for the
space and Susan, Paula & I crossed the Bay Bridge & got there just about
11.
Re Ach was doing some of his heavy jungle in the back/ambient room, and
after he was done, there was Joe Rice in the ambient & John Carel in the
main -- sweet!  It was the least hot dance floor I've been to at this
space, as the party wasn't too crowded and the fans seemed to work.  The
psychedelic art, lasers & lights were great as usual, and the beautiful
tarot space was a nice touch.  The vibe was thick, and the crowd was an
excellent mix.  Although I usually am a trooper to the end, we all left at
almost 5 with the party still raging for some rest and quiet reflection.

I'm now becoming satisfied by coffee and waiting for a World Cup soccer
qualifying morning, Canada at Mexico at 10 and U.S. at Jamaica (!) at noon,
only en Espanol on Channel 14.

Hey all! Didn't get a chance to go out to Basics
last night . . . being fully committed to school here in
my last semester, before heading to a * real * college!

If anyone on this list could post how Basics went last
night, I'd be really appreciative of you.  Hope to see
some of you in April @ The Gathering!

And speak up we do.

I can only agree with Leslie.

If you are looking for a place to do verbal terrorism there is so many
alt.* groups to choose from. 
Myself using sfrave on and off to reach out and get a feel what is
happenin'  in the SF scene feel that there is too much stuff that should
rather take place in an IRC (e.g. the one on hypperreal) environment than
on this mailing list.

I am looking forward to be back in SF soon and hope to meet an all amiable
crowd.

PLUR Jan

Well, I'm back. That didn't last too long, eh? 

Wayne once said something that I agree with: Sfraves is not a 12 step
program don't treat it like one. However I must say that all the
compassion, caring and good advice that many of you offered my way is
*very* deeply appreciated, and it really my opened my eyes to something
that I was forgetting, that when you get past all the B.S. on the list(yes
guilty as charged myself) there are really some very warm, compassionate
people who give a damn about the well-being of others, even total
strangers. And that is the beauty of raving for me, a feeling of love and
support. Sometimes it can be hard to see, as one has a tendancy to get
jaded over the years and can't see certain things for what they really
are. I just wanted to say *THANK YOU* to everyone for reopening my eyes
to this simple truth.

Further, I am going to make a promise to try to be nicer here. How's that
for a shocker?(sorry the sarcasm stays as part of the deal.) Actually I
think about 5 other people on the list would do well to exchange this
simple promise between themselves and keep to it. Of course it is not my
place to say that you should or should not flame-the-hell-out-of-someone-for
-something-stupid-they-said, especially given some of the really stupid
things people say sometimes. But I guess the real question is "What good
does it do?" Occasionally something productive will come out of such
exchanges, but more often than not a series of "I'm right, you're wrong
and you are a (racist/bigot/homophobe) as well." So there goes an hour of
your life composing a message that the person on the other end is not so
much listening to as ready to strike-counterstrike or simply ignore. Net
result *0* unless you count the artificial ego inflation value. And again,
I am the first to admit that I have been very guilty of the above in the
past, but am going to try to work on it. One thing I would ask of folks is
that they think about they are saying before shoving a message on to
hyperreal. If you are going to offer "facts" on a given subject, make sure
you have those facts right? Consider going back into the archives and see
what others have said on that subject. A lot of the same, in my
experience. The list can be very repetitve at times with things like
Strychnine in LSD and Heroin in E, and many other things that have already
been said. Want to get into a race war on the list? Consider looking back
into the archives to get those warm tender feelings of animosity. It's all
there, it's all pretty much been said before. 

Well, thanks again for your compassion, love, and support. It's amazing
listening to others stories of people that they have lost(thanks for
sharing.) Many people have endured far worse things with relationships
breaking up, and they all seemed to have survived. 

I *will* see more of you out more, as I am going to be going out more...
Anyone want to give a no-rhythm white boy some stepping lessons? I have
been doing this for 5 years, and I still can't dance to techno.. :(

I think I also remember him saying that refunds would be given out without a

This is the most awesome _rave_ i've been to this year.  This is how a
_rave_ should be thrown.  I feel much better now after that UnCool
World make-up gangsterfest which made me feel totally depressed for a
whole week after.  Now I'm back to my bouncy happy self.  Much props to
Spencer and Deepfog for throwing such an awesome _rave_ and I hope this
would be an example that the rest would follow.

The vibe was totally there, the DJ's were sooo rad, and everyone was nice 
and cuddly (just the way a raver should be!) and pretty much a lot of 
the people there know what raving is all about and guess what?  A lot of 
the people who attended were SFRavers and they all asked for SFR 
Laminates.  For those of you who got them please wear them proudly and 
for those who don't Orson will make some more and give it away to the 
next party he goes to and I will make sure that those who asked me for 
laminates and didn't get one will have one.  

Much love to EVERYONE who went to this awesome _rave_.  I've met soo many 
new faces and I'm sitting here trying to associate names with those 
faces.  Don't worry, I'll figure it out. =] For those of you who can't 
remember me (it happens), I'm the small filipino with the black visor 
and I was mostly hanging out with neat-o people by the tent in the chill 
room.  This is also the FIRST time i've met a raver who actually lives in 
the same city as i do (Vallejo) and is just about a few houses away from 
me and he happens to be one of the kewlest, the nicest, and the sweetest 
raver you'll ever meet.  Props to Pablo, he is the man!  


Love,
Anthony E

tooo long. 

most unfortunately my usually happy hip rave friends were sick sick sick so
they could not go, and i had to venture out all alone. but once i made it to
the map point i met some super slick sfravers and felt very warm and fuzzy.
thanks to all who hugged and smiled my way!! you folks are grand!! (please
email me so we can go play again sometime soon)

but now the most marvelous (previously sick) special rave friend is all
better!! so hopefully we will see you out and about wiggleing and grooving
next weekend!!

hello all-

after quietly watching the politics on sfraves, all the posts that have occured, the massive influx of negative energy during the past 2 weeks, i have one message:

TAKE YOUR GOD DAMN FLAME WARS PRIVATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

thank you.  now that i have gotten that off my chest, i can proceed deleting stupid mail of people criticizing each other.  i can deal with nrr stuff when it's about the lives of sfravers.  i can deal with nff stuff when it's a constructive conversation a
bout raving, computers, bunjee jumping, whatever!  i can deal with nrr stuff when people get some benefit from it.

otherwise, TAKE IT PRIVATE AND KEEP IT THERE!  THIS IS INFURATING!!!

thanks for your time.

matthew d. p. k. lanier, really disgruntled sfraver

I had just an awsome saturday!!  I don't have time to talk to share it all
and talk about Shine too so i'll just fast foreward to about 9:00 pm last
night..... After a long afternoon of wandering S.F. compulsivly buying a
few things on borrowed cash ( i'll pay off my tab Anthony...soon ;) I ended
up at the beach (burrrr, it was cold!!) with my good friends Anthony and
Mac and our new friend Joe from Davis.  Just killing time talking, waiting
for the voice message to be updated.  We made it to the doors of Shine
sometime around 11:00, the dance studio was decked out like i've never seen
it before!!  Some really cool banners, trippy video projections and a funky
green laser shooting across the room.  Small crowd, just the right number
of people.  The chill room was just that with the airconditioning churning
out cold air at full blast.  I spent most most of my night in the chill
room (never actually chill'in, only sat down for a short while) groovin
from mad jungle to smooth breaks.  I made a few trips to the main room and
caught the beginning of Ehtan's set; got some snapshots of the man at work.
 
I was the stubborn guy who wouldn't take off his backpack, blinding
everyone with the camera flash.  It was a night worth adding to my rave
photo album.  The music and the vibe kept me awake and wired the entire
night but with my last group of friends cutting out (my last chance for a
ride home) I called it a night at 6:00... well 7:30, it's a long drive
home. 
To Summerize: great party!!  

Matt

Anyone get the sense that there was some kind of sun theme this week from
the above named parties?

Warmth:

Fucking *fabulous* space. Well ventilated, the main system was downstairs
so they didn't run the risk of upsetting the po-po. The decorations were
wonderful, including Leslie Ayers beautiful(if somewhat minimalistic) 
altar. The crew(don't really know who) had their stuff together. The crowd
was definitely younger, and really nice. About an hour and a half into it
someone mentioned that there was a Gateway party going on which I hadn't
heard about. Being that I didn't really know anyone at Warmth(although
maybe I should have stayed and met more folks) I headed over to Gateway.

Gateway:

The dance studio. However it was *really* well ventilated this time,
almost to the point of being cold in the chill room(really was a chill
room.) Gateway of course has their killer sound system, so sound was
great. It was actually fairly lightly populated last night, but comfy none
the less. Decorations were good as usual. The music in the main room was a
little spotty, but I wasn't in the main room most of the night. Heard some
decent jungle from Rich and Joe Rice, a bit different than what I have
been hearing, which has been the same dull, repetative beat in every
single song. It was a pleasant departure. The people of course were
wonderful and I got to see a couple of new sfraves faces. All in all a
great night. It is a good sign to go to multiple parties, and feel safe
and really comfortable at both.

(negative review of Space Children followed by glowing review
of Gateway. film at 11)

Well, after hearing about so many people getting turned away at the
Space Children party, I can only say that aside from my deep regret
about losing your money ($20 is a lot of money to blow on a party),
feel happy you didn't get in, because this was not a great party. (I
even heard that Jonas Sharp was denied enterance at the door, and was
left standing outside with a big box of records. Not cool.)

Forturnately, Elise and I arrived as guests of Wayne (otherwise I
would have not gone, in accordance to my "pay no more than $15" rule),
only to find dance areas sparsely filled with random people looking
completely bored, hallways filled with people looking lost, wandering
from room to room, pushing and shoving in the sportswear room (oops, I
mean "house room") between two children who thought they were still in
their high school locker room (they weren't), and other kids standing
in the stairwells shouting out random letters of the alphabet all
night ("X!" "X!" "E!").

Of course, the total lack of vibe wasn't my biggest complaint. I was
more bothered by the *terrible* sound quality in the drum&bass room
(which was the reason that I, and many other people that I knew, had
come). If the promoters of this party are reading this, please follow
my advice:

make sure that whoever mixed the sound for the jungle room is REMOVED
from the sound engineering profession!

That was the WORST, most PAINFULLY excruciating attempt at sound
reproduction that I have ever experienced in my entire life. I have
been going to raves, punk rock clubs, played in a hardcore band, and
have been regularly blasting my ears with headphones for years and
years, and nothing could match the level of sonic pain from last
night. If that person's idea of EQ'ing is turning the volume as the
loud as it can go in a highly reflective room, then he/she has a *lot*
to learn. Muddy bass and sloppy snare rolls just doesn't sound like
music to me. Call me picky. ;)

Anyway, after realizing that we weren't having a good time, we left
and went straight to Gateway. Ah... 180 degree difference. Just as
soon as I was greeted at the door by the Gateway people, I remembered
why I love undergroud parties... No surly security people yelling at
me that I'm not using the right door to leave, no pushing, no shoving,
no degrading body searches, just good vibes.

We had no tickets, had missed the map point, and we were short $10 for
admission, but they still let us in, with a smile and a "have a good
time!". On the way upstairs (I love the dance studio!), I was greeted
by so many of my favorite raver friends everywhere, and even many
people that had also bailed from Space Children. I also saw the C-Lab
people again... Good thing they double-booked.

The main dance area was decorated beautifully. Probably the best use
of Gateway lasers, lights and projections that I have seen in a long
time. And there were just the right amount of people in the dance
area. Just enough people to get a good vibe going, but not too many so
as to remove all available oxygen from the room (a common problem in
the dance studio).

Most of my time was spent in the chill room (the red laser in the
crystal was really beautiful, btw) listening to C-Lab. I was really
impressed with their new stuff. Their IDM influences really
complemented the drum&bass sound they were after. Very nice! :)

Okay, I've ranted and raved enough for one post...

There is no doubt in my mind that this was a good party.
Beautiful (and I mean it) Chill room with excellent decorations. So
relaxing. Incredibly Chill. And bathrooms!! That's very essential.
Grrrrrrrrreat music. The most of it anyone. Micron blew me away with his
great selections and insane buildups. And although I really don't like
jugnle the jungle played there was good.

The one thing that I did find strange about it was the vibe. Although it
was a good one, there were two differnt vibes altogether, I thought.
It was like upsatirs was a vibe set by Spiritual Ravers and downstairs
was one set by Happy Ravers. They were both good, it's just that it
sorta felt like a very strange transition while walking up the stairs.
It seemed like the both of the good vibes were sorta debating it out to
control the rave. Then (as always with good raves) around the end, the
vibe turned into a family type vibe.

That's just how many and a many other ravers there percieved it.

Still...
Great job (whoever) for a super duper coolio fun party.
Good location too. I hear everyone's gonna be renting it out a lot.

Love.Luck.Lollipops,
P.S. Hello all you cool SFRavers that were at warmth. You guys are cool.
I FINALLY met Leslie. One terrrrrific lady. She is so nice. I love her.
Doesn't everybody?

The party rocked! The location was excellant! The music was excellant.
Everything was excellant! After reading all the posts by other people about
the various parties they went to, I have something to say about the party
that I went to! =) First off, I really don't know of any other promoter who
can put on a party better then Martin. He had FREE organic food, ( that
tasted excellant!!! THANKS DANA!!!) and there was plenty of water and drinks
and one could refill their bottle in the bathroom or drinking fountain. There
was plenty of spacee to relax. The dance area kinda got crowded but never
really got to crowded. As far as sound, the mkusic was excellant and the bass
was thumping! There was a mirror ball, and a few lights and some blacklight
banners and a few strobes. Seems like Martin always gets a kick out of
turning the dance area into a dark room then fireing up the strobes and
melting your head!!! I loved it. Nothing to complain about. Nobody turned
away. So many friendly people with smiles all night long. The choice crew
really has it togeather! Kenny Hawkes spun some sick house!! Seemed like he
had a few bumpy mixes but his music selection more then made up for it. Did I
hear some poonjabi?? Josh closeing things up!!! He p[layed some sick toons
also. Simon played some disco that really was dope. Tony had the palce
rocking as soon as people got there! Tracy seemed to be attracting all the
people zoocked out of there mind! This one kid was playing the mirror game
with Tracy. She would move left, he would move left. She would raise her
hand, he would raise here hand. He probably was having a really great time
but it was cool cause he backed up a little and gave tracy some breathing
room. her set was really good too. I have heard parts of her set before, but
i listened to most of it last night and she had the whole place moving!!!  10
stars!!!!!

Peace,
Jonathan

On the voicemail the said they were selling 2200 presales tix and that the
doors would probably close. 

I was dissapointed when they kicked us out at 5am.... pretending that the
police were the reason. The REAL reason was that the Maritime hall has a
5am curfew. A lot of bullshit was talked about the police and fire
department.

I loved the party! It was soooo fucking awesome. Caesar was bomb, Dutch
thew down, and I ran into a lot of friends. I must say that this was one
of the good ones. 

If there was a prized to be given, I received it. I got a t-shirt, and 2
tapes.... each time they threw something out my long ass arms grabbed one.
I bet people were beginning to hate me!... but I'm 6'2, what can I say!

If any of yous are planning on going to parities and need a ride from the
concord/martinez area e-mail me. Even if you're not from concord/martinez
we could arange something. I love going in groups!

I would appreciate it if you two would not use my posts as weapons.  I =
was trying to get a message out to everyone, not provide you with =
ammunition for your own personal fights.  I don't enjoy the bitter =
sarcasm (don't deny it's existence) on this list.   A few months ago, =
when I first heard about the SFRaves list, I was really jazzed about it =
because I thought that it meant that I would have the opportunity to =
meet many cool people, discuss many interesting ideas, and generally =
keep in touch with the scene when I could not go out to play.  I have =
met many interesting people, have had lots of fun, and have heard many =
interesting discussions.  However, the people who told me about the list =
warned me as well.  They warned me about the vicious infighting that was =
going on almost constantly for a bit of time.  Before I started posting, =
I downloaded a section of the SFRaves archive and browsed through it for =
a while.  I bore witness to the numerous fights between various people(I =
will refrain from mentioning names because I wish to let old furies lay =
to rest).  These postings disturbed me because it was not what I had =
envisioned from the people in the scene whom I all know(and hope to =
meet) and love.  I was disillusioned to say the least.   I realize that =
it is easier to start a flame war via the nets because you are not face =
to face with your "adversary."   This is no excuse.
	PLEASE LISTEN TO ME!!!   This culture we  share with each other, the =
essence of raving, the oneness that we all strive towards is a fragile =
thing.  It does not take much to pollute it to the point where people no =
longer wish to partake of the waters.  When I first came to the list, I =
wanted to try to put out the fires and make the list a little less =
volatile.  I know now that I cannot do it alone.  In order to keep this =
list alive the way we all want it to be (at this point I take the =
liberty of assuming that a good portion of people who do not post very =
often agree with me, however I may be alone in this.  I hope not.)  we =
all must be respectful of each other's opinions and viewpoints. =20
	The vibe that we all share is a beautiful thing.  Cherish it, nurture =
it, but don't poison it.  I do not mean to lecture anyone, for that will =
accomplish nothing.  I do not require anyone to do want I say either.  I =
merely ask that you listen to me, and to the meaning of my first =
message.  I am sorry if I have offended anyone with my words, but this =
is how I feel. =20

This rave summed up what the scene means to me: beautiful people, 
beautiful space, beautiful music (macadio rocks!! matt is a great ambient 
dj!) and I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E vibe was present.  I felt so horored to be a 
part of crew (if but a small part, thanks to Spencer and Deepfog).  You 
both are incredible people - thank you so much for giving this to our 
community. 
I wish I didn't have to leave at 2:30 because of work on Sunday morning, 
but I had a blast meeting some of you at the water bar where I was 
helping out.  I still saw some people with laminates that I didn't get to 
meet (some weren't even sfravers! go figure...). Beware, you WILL be met 
sooner or later! :) Alekz and Vertigo: great to meet you both as well as 
thouse whose names I regretfully forgot.  You are all wonderful.  

Thanks again Spencer and Deepfog!  I am speechless.  At that I bid you 
all goodnight.

love,
Amy

Amazingly Fun! I had a great time, the vibe was GREEEEAT, the best party
I've been to this year :o)  it was the bomb! ;O)
I met so many friendly people (A LOT of SFRavers) -it seemed to be more of
an SFRaves party since it seemed that everyone from "THE LIST" was there.
;-)

The DJs were RAD!!!!!!, the music was GREEEAT and the party in general
earns lots of PLUR-Points :o)

It was really cool to see Rhona, Fernando, Lara, Molly, ANthonE, etc etc
again :)
extra special thanks go to Vertigo for have such nice conversations with me
;o)
and it was really cool to meet Stephani, Shelley, Snoopy (Rocky says hi!
:o)) Claudia (I still haven't gone to bed ;o)), Micron, DeepFog, Boomerang,
Victoria, Paul, Kermit, etc etc etc etc....

I had a great time and can't wait 'till the next WARMTH ;O)

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE EVENING:
* Talking to everyone :o)
* Boomerang played my favorite Enya song. "Caribbean Blue" :o) 
  (THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!!) :o) :O)

NOT SO GOOD PARTS OF THE EVENING:
* A girl who rudely said "you cannot get a hug" and walked away. When I
simply
  just asked her if I could get one. -PASS-A-NOVA on HER and she gets her
PLUR
  points taken away ;o)

* Another girl that said: "Stop being conceited" while I was in line for
the bathroom.
  Reason: there was a mirror behind the door in which I couldn't help look
at myself
  since the mirror was in front of me anyway. -DOUBLE BYPASS and she also
gets
  her PLUR points taken away.


OVERALL: The Party RULED :O)
C-ya alls, love to alls, etc
Pab  

PS: I had so much fun...I've got afterglow to last me for two weeks ;O)

 This weekend was pretty complete for one happy bouncy person: quick reviews,

Ninja Tunes, those guys got some talent .  The sound system and lighting at
that 
club was very top notch. Crazy mixing, scratching and musical choices made for
a very inspring evening

Warmth :-) my god, these kids were happy as ice cream, pure butter. It's so
amazing
to see a different group of people, another comforting family. Man, Thad played
some amaxing songs in the basement. Drum and bass in your face loud, just like 
it should be (Audio Impact...this week, woohoo). I can't even begin to say
how incredible
Micron is, he played some of the most beautiful songs, just what I needed at
4 am in total
bliss, Micron rrrrrrrRRRRoOoOcCCCkkkkkkkSSSSSSSSS! 

Ofcourse if anyone has a chance, one must catch Protlab live, those guys can
play some
great tunes, pretty, breaky, dubby, fluffy, ah yaa. 

Great chillroom decorations, free Nub Chai doing wonders to my soul, free
bottled water
and fruit, wow. Warmth made me smile, tickly, fuzzy and kind of warm inside.

Sunday, to end the weekend, I did the drum gathering circle at Golden Gate
park for the
3rd weekend in a row, good spiritual cleansing and relaxation for a
wonderful sunny day,
ahh, the sisters and brothers come together.

:o)

pao

No, according to the Gateway voicemail, the make up party will be
sometime in April. Supposedly they are awaiting permits from the city
of San Francisco (that I was under the impression was no longer
granting permits).

Sit tight; when it's time for the make up party, I'm sure everyone
will find out about it.

I've had a really interesting weekend and it has involved wonderful
aspects of both of the scenes that have welcomed me and that I love :)

After spending a wonderful Saturday evening with a lot of my favorite
folks, I took time to test out my new mixer board by replaying some old
tracks out of my computer that me and my buddy Joe had written back in
1994/1995...  what a fun way to spend an afternoon :)

Anyway, this past weekend really made me think about how much I love all
parts of our scene and it also made me think how stupid it is to get all
upset over dumb shit.  There's just so much to be happy about all around
us every day.  :)  Anyway, try to start your week with a smile, okay?  To
all those I had the good fortune of visiting with, thank you very much!
And to those who were too far away to hug or at least smile at, know that
you are being sent the warmest wishes :) :) :)

No, the gateway makeup party hasn't been put together yet. They said they
would make explicit announcements regarding the makeup party when they get
it together.

Hello.

If Star Wars, why not techno and house?  If "Jungle Boogie" and "Play
that Funky Music", why not "Charlie", "Pissed Apache", "Bombscare", 
"Atom Bomb", "Rez",  "Strings of Life", "Stella", and the Dust Brothers' 
remix of "Like a Motorway"? 

So there's this big buzz about seeing the Star Wars flicks in the
theaters "the way they were meant to be seen".  Someone should apply
this handsomely profitable logic to the cornucopia of headphone and 
livingroom classics that once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away 
(i.e. '91, '92, '93, '94, '95, early '96) tore it up on dancefloors.
Currently, it's only safe for a DJ to wax retro if s/he confines it to a
single old-skool track, maybe two or three, within their set. If done
right, this monkey-business can pay big dividends, especially to those
hearing the track for the first time.  

I've heard about such retro events in LA.  Let's have some up here!  Let
us, for a moment, put aside the stifling burden of being terribly
current.  Let us, on one self-effacing night (or every once in a blue
moon) be overwhelmingly passe.  Let's unlock the music and let the good
times roll.

Rok.  

This message was prompted by a night of tragically mediocre new music.

basics was definitely a really good party.. in a new place near 
homebase.. a little small (not sure where the gathering is going to be 
held, this place was too small for that.. ) and a little warm, but a 
super party nonetheless.. we missed tony  =(  because we lag.. but we 
got there in time to see tracy tear it up.. and then simon.. no words 
to describe how wonderful he was... he definitely wrecked shop.. and 
everyone, you should try to see kenny hawke spin before he goes back to 
london.. this man is soooo dope.. and super nice to talk to.. i 
definitely dug his accent! =)  it was a really mixed crowd, but 
everyone had big warm smiles.. nice vibe.. all in all, it was 
definitely a great party..

                             much love,
                                anissa...

Although its a really crappy album, the new David Bowie CD, "Earthling", 
has a few Jungle-ish Tracks with a live drummer.

Hey Hey,
  
First and foremost....THANK YOU! To everyone involved in throwin'
Warmth. This event will stay in my head as exactly what a raving is all
about. It was absolutely perfect. I wouldn't have changed one thing!!
What a fuckin' a fabulous nite! I'm still bouncing and smiling! (but
seeing as I'm at work and its 7am the bouncing and smiling is on the
inside :)) 
 As you all already have read.....the sets were super...all of you
deserve huge pats and hugs (as if I did't give em already) for throwin
down perfect sets. 
The space was so uh, WARM.....the vibe was as I remembered it being
years ago...it was so intense, and pure. Nothing but smiles and hugs
from everybody there. The decorations were awesome...the glowing tent
was the best...and the life sized stuffed bear in the chill room (out
front) was too much. 
Hey SFRavers...so glad to meet all of you! AnthonE...you made my entire
nite giving me your laminate...Thanks so much! Lara> you rock! so glad
to meet you. Macadio...phew..that first mix was a close call, eh....you
are amazing.... Claudia..uh, could you be any cooler? You are wonderful!
Wizard...what can I say? You are the man! I look forward to working with
you. Thank you! That record is phat..kewl sample..I got home and
listened to it first thing..it mixes perfectly with some other stuff I
have...I owe you.(plz hug and thank your s/o for me,
*thankx*)..Deepfog...didn't really get to talk to you...but it was kewl
to meet you in person after seeing your name everyday for the last year!
Vlad...your set was intense....it really took me off to a different
level. Amy! <hugz> Alekz! hey there..it was great to meet you! ..and to
everyone else who I met and shared this wonderful experience with but
can't remember your names.... I still want to say hi and give you all a
huge hug! 
Warmth was my girfriend's (Elena) first _real_ *E*xperience raving. She
had the time of her life...literally. In her words... as we were riding
home at 7am...."I've been waiting for that my entire life!"  We
definately have a new member among us now...she'll be online soon to
write her review..(could take a few days though) She wants to post and
say hi and tell everyone what a wonderful,unbelievable, enlightening
night she had! There couldn't have been a more perfect setting for her
first real event. The ppl, the STRONG energy, the perfect space, and the
love she felt from everyone who met her. I am so happy! Thank you to
everyone who met her and took the time to share with her. 
If you look up...rave...in the dictonary it says Ra've: see Warmth flier
for details. It was all that and then some! 
Micron, Spencer, Wizard, Macadio, Deep.....and those unbelievable guys
upstairs playing live ambient and jungle...WOW! you are all the Bomb! 
see you all very soon! 
PLUR,
Ari

Hello, Everyone :)

I had an excellent time at Warmth!!!  The music was teriffic, and I really
loved whichever chill-room dj it was who played all that old skool music
(Gawd, I love Orbital :) :)  There was only a slight bit of discomfort for
me in that I was supposed to be babysitting both my friend Laura (not to be
confused with Lara [HI, Sweetie!!!]) AND my gf, Melisa, and each had a
different agenda.  In the end, I think I made a good choice, but I don't
think my Melisa will want to rave again (it was her first time, and she
didn't feel really comfortable with people being sooo friendly [shame on
ALL of you ;) ;) hehehhe])

Anyway, I'm sooo looking forward to Warmth 2 in May :)

I loved the music, the decorations, the kewl-o visuals in the chill out
area, and, most of all, the people I met and chitchatted with (Hi, Lara,
Pablo, Anthony, Macadio, Tony, Todd, Perry, and those other people whose
names were lost with my brain cells!!!!)  Thank you to everyone who told me
Happy Birthday :) :)  Oh, and I'm happy to be the new owner of an SFRaves
laminate!!!  YaY!!! This was certainly one of my best birthdays, and I have
all of YOU to thank for it!!!

Take care, and I look forward to wherever next weekend will take me :) :)

Love and glitter,
Thomas =]

RE: and C-Lab had fun playing live at Space Children since we were playing
all new music.  There were definately problems, like the sound system wasn't
up yet in the room we were playing in, and our set got cut to 1 hour as a
result, and some of our friends were denied entry, and only got in with a
help from Jonah Sharp (thank you).  Andrew (Astral Matrix) spun some records
and played a few of his tracks from DAT right before we went on.  He rocked.
Then we played and had a blast jumpin around behind our keyboards spewing
out d&b.  It gets my energy up playin that stuff.  Optic went on right after
us, but I only got to hear a little of his set.  What I hear was really
cool.  he was all analogue, making everything up as he went along.  It was
way neato.  Sorry we had to rush out during your set, but we had to go to
Shine.  All the way up to Shine, there had been much chaotic energy flowing.
Space Children was crazy due to it's own inherent problems, plus our having
to break down the gear as fast as possible and head over to Shine.

So we get there and carry the stuff up those blasted stairs.  Bless those
who carry the speakers!  I step into the ambient area, and there is an
immediate conscious difference in my energy.  It is a warm loving atmosphere
of friends.  Claire (bless her) offers to switch sets with us to give us
plenty of time to set up and relax a bit before playing.  We do so.  I
danced a bit in the main room to the sounds of someone I didn't recoginize
by face, but I was really into his music.  My attention span for dance music
isn't usually very long, so soon I was gone to chill in the ambient space.
Chilled and talked to a few friends and was feeling sooooo good.  Good vibes
were very apparent.  I just kept telling everyone how happy I was to be
there.  I got stoked with free smoothy by the smoothy goddess (sorry forgot
your name), then a friend tells me it's time to make sound.  We had planned
to do more chill and down tempo stuff, but Claire gave me the ok to do some
d&b, and said some people were kind of expecting to hear it.  So we played
our new d&b sounds and had a blast bouncing around and bumping into each
other behind our set-up due to lack of space.  Totally fun.  I love the
Gateway sound.  They know what they are doing.  Sorry if any of you were
expecting "ambient sound research" and just got Consciouness Lab.  We have
all kinda branched our into other realms.  We still dig ambient, but are
just exploring other areas.

After leaving the party, we went to breakfast at this crepe place off of
Mission.  We moved a big table out onto the sidewalk and ate out side with
our 7 or 8 friends.  So fun.  Sun peeking through the clouds...as well as
the moon.  So nice.

Thanks Gateway for a wonderful night.

I'm happy,
Rick

I have gone to many raves/parties/concerts in which it did seem the
intent was to make me deaf by 40 instead of 50.  Probably the worst/best
example was a skinny puppy show is saw back in 92.

...but I actually found the pain enjoyable at Analog. If you could
accept the fact that damage was being done, then staying within 20 feet
of the speakers cancelled any echo effects.  Within this distance I
found the drum&bass overwhelming and well quite enjoyable.

double 'a' set at the end of the night was amazing...it was too bad i
only had enough energy to sit and bop.  

.....anyway there's three drum&bass events this week(audio impact,
jungle love, spring heel jack)....how does one choose?

I am here, I am a raver....

It's funny, here, typing away, Mr. Spell Cheque highlights every other 
word, unfamillar with raver-speak (or I'm just a bad speller).

=)

Friday: _Ohmsonic_
I arrive with/a friend to 'the spot' @ 11:30. Nice lil venue.  A tad 
too bright for my tastes, Anon is mixin' them  psi-trance traks quite 
nicely... I start gruuving.  Looking around, I see the usual 
Goa-lites. Music intensity is building and I'm steppin' trying and 
keepin' up2beat...

Everybody seems to be having an alright time, some are floored by 
whichever substances they care to consume.  Me, I'm consumed in the 
frequencies that surround me.  Looking around I see our scene, our 
underground.  From teens to twenty-somethings,  visitors from afar, 
and locals at their millionth event. All creeds colors, races and 
religions.  Now, we are all of the same vein.  Children of techno.  We 
are all family.

There's a time when time doesn't matter, it's dark-thirty.  It's this 
time when I'm @ my happiest. I'm sitting in a small smoke-cloud, 
giving a backrub and smiling.  Talking to another oldschooler, she's 
telling me about her days in the eastcoast, Spring of 94 with some 
local hero by the name of Josh Winks.  I tell her about one the FMR's 
back in the early 90's with some DJ named Jeno... We laugh.  Watching 
the scene change.
I'm dancing, feeling the various cravings consuming me... To my left 
is a someone who caught my eye, my right is a speaker beating out a 
sound that my body is helplessly responding to, on the floor is a 
half-filled water bottle... My passion for all is equal. I can't help 
smiling.  Where is 20/20 when you need them?  But they wouldn't 
understand.  The other side...  They misunderstand us, and what people 
don't understand- they fear.

Saturday:  _Warmth_
Well, I don't feel it's right to post a review on a production that I 
was an acting force in assisting (doing setup, door ect..) but it's 
apparent that the party was a success. I really would like to thank 
each and everyone of you, dear ravers, for making this party a 
smashing success.  Without you, well we wouldn't exsist...
I would like to take time to say 'high' to everybody I chatted with:
Spencer, Branka, Matt, Anna, Rob R, Connie, Eric, Heidi, Pengo, Ariel 
(Pronounced R-E-L). As well as the plethora of others who's names slip 
me...

Also, Major props to the DJ's I conversed with (Micron, Wizard, Elmo, 
Deep, And Macgaines). Nice sets all...

I would like to whisk all of you into a small virtual rave.  Music is 
bleeding through the speakers.  People are gruvving, that guy/gal that 
catches your eye is smiling @ you...  Your waterbottle is still half 
full and yet someone offers you some more.  Someone taps you on the 
shoulder and says, "dosen't it all make sense now..".
Maybe you sit down and a friend gives you a massage (or you massage 
someone, if that's your cup of tea)...
Remember this feeling. Joy. Contentness. Vibe. Now keep it in you... 
but try to spread that to everybody everyday.  I'm glad that, someday, 
I can look @ my childrens' children and thell them:
-I was the generation when raves were a 'fad'.
-I was the generation when jungle could only be heard on college 
stations. (now becoming mainstream, thanks to Bowie and NIN)
-I was the generation that saw Leary die...
-I was the generation that tried to save this world with the power of 
music...

To me that is a raver...  And that's what I am...

P.S. To those that need to contact me in regards to the Saturday 
thingie, drop me an E-line and we'll talk.

---Adam

	I hit both Warmth & Shine this Saturday. They were both 
wonderful. Warmth had a very bright cheery vibe. It seemed to be
mostly the 20's & younger set, which tends to make me feel a little 
old. Shine had a slightly darker energy, but was truly an excellent 
party. This one was the 20's & older set, so I didn't feel so much 
like Dad. 

	Warmth - good things - candle altar by Leslie, 
	butterfly altar by ?, massage table, tent, *big*
	teddy bear, Protolab, DJs, free fruit & Chai,
	meeting Leslie, Branka, Raygun for the first time.

	Shine - good things - better age balance (for me,
	anyway), really effective use of lasers, dry ice
	piped into the chill room (both a visual & a coolant),
	laser/crystal thing, Buddha altar, body art. Live
	& DJ music, meeting Patrick (ne Black Adder), Joe, 
	Nancy for the first time. 

	I met so many people at these parties that my head 
	is kind of spinning. I'm only mentioning the ones 
	I had known previously from the mail list.

	If only they would play more trance...

Well it is Monday afternoon and im just sitting here in the office reflecting
on the AWESOME weekend I just had. Words can't really explaine the time that I
had at the party "warmth" this weekend, This event was well put together and
the space was great. I enjoyed playing with all the "guys"
adam,micron,thad,wizard,deepfog. I thought we all played very well together.
The vibe for those of you who did not go was just amazing I saw so many smiling
faces and happy vibes I was just extatic.I met and talked with so many kewl
people so im not going to mention any names cause I don't want to leave anyone
out. I would like to send thanks to orson for the SFR laminate. I would like to
personally thank all of you who made it out to the party YOU all made it great
it gave me a little insight as to why I spin and go to partys. I would like to
thank tony (deepfog) and spencer for giving me the chance to play at such a
beautiful party. I hope to see all your beautiful smilling faces at the next
warmth. The only two things of the Night that I did not like was 1.)the sound
was good but the guy that hooked it up did not do a good job so it made the
"sound", sound shitty it was real muddy and distorted at any rate the sound was
good just hooked up wrong. 2.)my second rekkid that I played the song ended
before I could mix it =( that is my own fault cause the night before I let my
buddy use my rekkids and he played the wrong side of the song that I playy so I
ended up playing a wrong edit so the rekkid ended and I did not have time to
mix it. But I made a "ok" recovery and the crowd was happy... Once again I
would like to thank all of you for making it a magical night..



*big hugz and love to all*

Did you guys ever get the sound back on in the front room? That was a bit
of a buzzkill. I was part of a crowd of people that left after your amp (or
whatever) blew. Otherwise, great vibe. That ginger tea stuff kicked ass. I
must have had a gallon of it.

Hello everyone...sorry to take up so much space on your computer, but i 
think this is important enough.  

on saturday night i forgot to change the voicemail letting people know 
where the party was until 4:30 Am.  

the problem here is that we told people on the vm the mappoint would be 
open till midnight.  well, i forgot.  i got a lot of hangups on the vm, 
but there was one person who mentioned not making it to the mappoint in 
time and not knowing where it was and they had already bought tickets.  

If any of you run into those people or you are one of them, please 
contact me at 415.595.3427.  thanx.  deepfog

short) break from throwing parties. Our last party was "Freaky People" in
Dec. '96, and our last schedualed party was "Family" Jan. '97 (it didn't
happen). During this "break," we have thought long and hard about where to
go with Harmony? What to do next? How to bring new life into the family?
And how to convay our thoughts, ideas, and dreams to everyone?

	The idea of throwing a "Massive" came into the picture. Although the Three
Year Anniversary (Sept. '96) was the largest party we have done yet
(14-1500 screaming ravers), and quite possibly could have been considered a
"Massive," in our eyes, it wasn't. Personally, I have always dreamed about
doing a party, where I wasn't limited in my financial decisions. I have
always wanted Harmony to build bigger and better props, bring in the best
djs and performers, the biggest- most colorfull light show, and the loudest
rockin sound system in California. For the Three Year Ann., most (over
half) of the budget went staight into the space and the buses we rented to
get to the space, so there was not a lot of $ to spend on the actual
production of the event. But usually, we have been confined to doing
smaller budgeted parties, which we feel are great, but still there is
little $ that can be used to increase the production of the party. 

	Another reason we want to throw a massive, is to bring our message of
peace, love, positivity and harmony to the masses. We have been doing
parties for almost 4 years now and we have maintained a good, positive,
family vibe through the good times and the bad times. We have seen our
family unite for a number of reasons. For example, our friend Omar. When he
was hit by a drunk, stoned and/or high driver at Burning Man, everyone came
together for him. People that he never even met before where sending him
prayers and sometimes even $ for his finacial help. Everything you guys did
helped him pull through. He is doing a lot better now, thanks to all of his
close friends and even the friends that he has not met yet! But it is love
and respect like this, that comes from you guys, that makes our family and
our scene so strong...

	But to make a long story short... That same love that you guys showed
Omar, is the same love that creates the energy which brings us all together
and closer at our parties. That love creates so much for our community. 
	
	Imagine what you feel like the day after a really good party, where you
dance, hear great music, and see most of your friends all night. You feel
great! And providing you are awake, you go out and have a great day. We
want more people to feel this way. We want more people to take the love and
togetherness from our scene, and apply it to everyday life.   

	Anyways, we took a vote at a metting and decided that it was a good idea
to pursue the thought of throwing a massive. We hope that the idea of this
being a massive, doesn't scare some of you away. There are some very valid
reasons why some people don't like massives. We are going to try our
hardest to make sure the we accomidate all of your concerns. And we hope
that all of you who have supported us in the past and present, also decide
to support us in the future. We are going to put in 100% of our energy to
try to make this the most colorful, high- energy, family-vibed massive that
the S.F. scene can handle! We are 100% positive that this is what we want
to do. And we are 100% positive that it will be a party that will change
your views about massives. We are going to put in all of our heart and soul
into this party to make sure that you have the time of your life! It is
going to insane!!! We are currently in the process of booking (some of the)
best Techno, Trance, Jungle, and Ambient djs and performers around. So stay
tuned, cause you're not gonna want to miss this party! 

	The date for this party is SATURDAY, MAY 17TH  1997. Start making plans!

	Also, look for the "Family" party on Saturday, April 5th '97. If you have
a presold ticket from the last "Family" party, you can use it for your
admission to this one. More details to follow. 

	Anyways, it feels good to have something in the works again. We can't wait
to see all of your smiling faces again! We love you!

Peace, love, and harmony to all,

Harmony =)

well...i guess i'm just gonna have to throw in my $.02

great party, space, people and music.

The party was well organized and went off with hardly a hitch.  

Hello to all the beautiful people i met and shared hugs with.  

Nice space; pretty clean and 2 bathrooms.  WOOOHOOO.  Downstairs got a
little warm ( i very nearly almost passed out after my set, dehydration
i guess ) but people kept dancing and kept the energy in the room up for
the entire night.  The speakers outside of the main room were also nice,
a lil cooler and u could still dance to the music. i was also happy to
see a live act in the chill room.

also, nice decorating guys, the place looked great.  

to all who came..THANK U....and for those that missed it...i'll see u
next time ;)

:)

Greets all!
    I'm new to the list (first post anyway), so let me begin by introducing
myself.  My name is Steve Duell.  I enjoy foreign cuisine, antique refrigerator
restoration, and playing mah jhong with my grandparents!  Just kidding.  But I
truly am mad about hard techno and good, vibey parties.  Speaking of which,
Warmth certainly qualifies.  I suspect I'm heavily biased since I helped set up
and stuff, but no bias of mine can take away from the fact that there were
scores of awesome people in attendance.  I'm usually not one to get all
spiritual about vibes.  I beleive that a vibe is more a personal perception
than a definite energy among people, but this place WAS charged and I was so
happy to have been a part of it.    
     Deepfog did an awesome job getting DJ's together.  Many different styles
were represented, and represented WELL!  Protolab awed and humbled me, and
Thad's set tore me up.  Anyway thanks to all who had enough faith in Spencer's
first time production to give it a chance. I'll be seeing you.

                                       Shteeb

Hello from the girlie with the glowing antennas!!!

Oh-My-GAWD!!! This was the best party I have ever been to!  I was a little
hesitant at first to go, since all my friends flaked on me, and I was
supposed to go to Space Children... All I have to say is THANK YOU SO MUCH to
Vertigo for changing my mind! 

Let's see, where to begin... I think that I will have to start with the
people... I met SO MANY people from the list that made me feel like family
right off the bat.  I am still rather new to the whole scene, so it started
my night off perfectly. A few people to mention:  
ROCKY - Get enough vitamin C??? Hope you had a blast with your satin sheets
and your waterbed... I know I would have... hehe!  
PABLO - Mirrors are happy! I don't care what anyone says! It was great
meeting you and chatting about all the crazy shit that I can't remember... :)
 
PAUL - Thanks for the bracelet! I always knew where to find you... Just
looked for those yellow gloves!  You rock!!!!
ANTHONY - My little filipino friend. You are the bomb!! And you've gotta make
sure that I get one of those laminates... Hope to see you at the next party.
ANDY - You little matchmaker you!  I hope you're happy with the outcome of it
all. You made my night too wonderful for words... Call me up for anything you
could possibly need! :)
ARIEL & JAMES - Thanks so much for talking Kermit out of his craziness. I had
fun (well, it was work, but still nice to chat with you) untangling the
christmas lights... See you at Cloud Factory.
MACADIO - You are the shit!!! I had so much fun dancing and watching you
spin.  And playing with your hair when Andy was talking to you! 
VERTIGO - Thank you so much for talking me into going to Warmth instead of
Space Children. I had the best time! You are great, and I am glad that you
found me at the party.  Make me a tape! From what I heard on the fone, it
sounded great! 
ANYONE WHO COMPLIMENTED ME ON MY OUTFIT - THANK U THANK U THANK U! I plan to
wear my little antenna's for a while... So look for me at the next party!! 

And,  of course, lastly.... 
MATT "KERMIT" or "that crazy loud Elmo guy"... I just remember walking into
the party and saying: I wanna meet that guy... He's too cool... And look how
things ended up... Happy happy...  I still feel bad for Shelly & Snoopy, cuz
of that wonderful Sunday afternoon... hehehe...  Good thing they were asleep.
But you better give me a call!! I know you will, so I'm not too worried. I
had the greatest time hanging out with you, and I'm sure therre'll be plenty
more times to come. :) We've gotta scare the people on Market Street again
next weekend! :) Love ya, babe! Can't wait to see you again!

Ok... PHEW.... anyone else I forgot, HELLO and thanks for making that the
best weekend I have ever had. The people were the best. The chill room(s)
were wonderful. Great decor, great music, great CHAI!!!  That was the first
time that I have had Chai, and I hope that I get to have more again really
soon! It was the best. Downstairs got a little wet and warm, but hey, it was
called WARMTH, right? (I had NOTHING to do with the wetness... I swear!)
 Well, I've taken up enough space... Hope everyone had as much fun as I did! 

Can't wait til the next Warmth... 

Oh, and from Shelly: 
To Pablo, Rocky, Heather, & (I think) Jeff: I LOVE YOU!! *BIG HUGS* And I
will call you when I get back from Dizzilyland. Take some "e" for me!!!

Peace out from the antenna girlie!
~^v^~ Stefani ~^v^~

I'm beating the dead horse here, but it is pretty funny.....



  AQUARIUS (1/20-2/10) You have an inventive mind and are 
     inclined to be progressive.  You lie a great deal.  You make the same  
     mistakes repeatedly because you are stupid.  Everyone thinks you are a 
     fucking jerk.
     
            PISCES (2/19-3/20) You have a vivid imagination and often think 
     you are being followed by the FBI or CIA.  You have minor influence on 
     your friends and people resent you for flaunting your power. You lack 
     confidence and are generally a dipshit.
     
            ARIES (3/21-4/19) You are the pioneer type and think most 
     people are dickheads.  You are quick tempered, impatient and scornful 
     of advice.  You are a prick.
     
            TAURUS   (4/20-5/20) You are practical and persistent.  You 
     have a dogged determination and work like hell.  Most people think you 
     are stubborn and bullheaded.  You are nothing but a goddamn communist.
     
            GEMINI (5/21-6/20) You are a quick and intelligent thinker.    
     People like you because you are bisexual.  You are inclined to expect 
     too much for too little.  This means you are a cheap bastard.    
     Gemini's are notorious for thriving on incest.
     
            CANCER (6/21-7/22) You are sympathetic and understanding to 
     other people's problems which makes you a sucker.  You are always   
     putting things off.  That is why you will always be on welfare and 
     won't be worth a shit. Everyone in prison is a Cancer.
     
            LEO (7/23-8/22)  You consider yourself a born leader.  Others   
     think you are an idiot.  Most Leo's are bullies.  You are vain and   
     cannot tolerate honest criticism.  Your arrogance is disgusting.  Leo 
     people are thieving motherfuckers and spend most of their time kissing 
     mirrors.
     
            VIRGO (8/23-9/22) You are the logical type and hate disorder.   
     This shitpicking is sickening to  your friends.  You are cold and 
     unemotional and often fall asleep while fucking.  Virgo's make good 
     bus drivers and pimps.
     
            LIBRA   (9/23-10/22) You are the artistic type and have a   
     difficult time with reality.  If you're male, you are probably queer. 
     Chances for employment and monetary gain are nil. Most Libra women are 
     whores. All Libra's die of venereal disease.
     
            SCORPIO (10/23-11/21) The worst of the lot.  You are shrewd in 
     business and cannot be trusted.  You shall achieve the pinnacle of 
     success because of your total lack of ethics.  You are a 
     son-of-a-bitch.  Most Scorpio's are murdered.
     
            SAGITTARIUS (11/22-12/21)  You are optimistic and enthusiastic. 
     You have a reckless tendency to rely on luck since you have no talent. 
     The majority of Sagittarians are drunks.  Nixon was a Sagittarius. You 
     are not worth the time of day.
     
            CAPRICORN (12/22-1/19)  You are conservative and afraid of 
     taking risks.  You are basically a chickenshit.  There has never been 
     a Capricorn of any importance.  You should kill yourself.

I just have a reguest to make actually..
 A request that makes this a postable,,, uh,, post. (opinion)
 I think that we all should use the words (fact) and (opinion) when talking
about, for instance, why things happen the way they do...

: I was dissapointed when they kicked us out at 5am. pretending
: that the police were the reason. The REAL reason was that the
: Maritime hall has a 5am curfew. A lot of bullshit was talked about
: the police and fire department.
:
-----------
 So the curfew is 5:00AM. That ACME building was an unsafe building to
throw parties in. But that didn't stop promoters from throwing some fat
little ravEs there. Am I right? (opinion)?
 Curfews were made to be broken (fact). Perhaps Space Children was just,
not as hopefull as they were hoping to be (opinion)..
 And whats the trips all about? I don't see any reason why Space Children
won't be refunding tickets (opinion).

 Discrepancy: They were handing out flyers inside, that said ticket holders
get into the after party for free. I,,, think,, that my ticket was takin
from me at the door. But I could be wrong (pot).

 But anyways. I think thoughs Space Children people are taking a reasonably
large dose of that PLUR Stuff every morning. And if remember correctly, I
think they were talking about a make-up party on the mic at 5AM.. And if
anyone there has really good hearing abilities, they might have heard me
say; "Why?!?!? It's 5AM. I am ravEd out! I got my moneys worth!!!" (fact)..
  Space children don't owe me sh!t (fact). And for the people that didn't
get in. Don't even trip, you should get a refund (opinion based on facts I
think I heard=).

have you hugged your fourth month of the year today???

ps lara came up to me at freaky people and said "hey I know you, we went to
high school together."
and I said, "are you sure? I don't know who you are."
and she said her name and I gave her a hug. 
I recognized her name, but we had never really spoken two or one or any words
to each other in high school, we just recognized each other at the party
thoough.
I'm happy I met you lara, you are so special!!!
Thank you for everything and I hope our friendship remains strong through the
years.
To my happy vibin friend.  The years WILL treat you good!!
I LOVE YOU LARA!!!
and I want the world to know it too!!!

There has been a retro revolution down here, and it seems to be driven by
our old friend Ron D. Core, amoung others.  Oddly, where you find the
old-skool sets is at Hardcore parties... hmmm....  I wonder if bringing
retro back to SF would require more hardcore....

The Maritime Hall does not have a 5 am curfew. They have a permit that allows
them to go after-hours. The REAL reason they shut the party down early is
because of a god awful, substance abuse causing, near-fatal catastrophe in
the Goa Room. :o) MODA (still scrubbing the blood off of his boots)

Yes, it is true, 'skimo is back on the list. If you don't remember
me, or maybe you just never met me (online or irl), this is who I am:

	Jonas Hanning, born in Sweden on May 22nd, 1976 (that would 
make me 20.75 years old I think...). I moved over to California in
August
of 1995 to attend Sonoma State University (yup, home of the world famous
Cossacks! *grin*). 
	What makes me tick? Well, music of course! As most of my 
friends know, I worship the ground that Josh Wink walks upon. Other 
than anything that JW lays his hands upon, I'm a sucker for hardbanging
acid and trance. Favorite labels would have to be Stay Up Forever, Noom,
and Loop Records. Today this guy at school asked me what the coolest
band
of all times was, and without hesitation I went for Kraftwerk. If you
don't believe me, try http://www.kraftwerk.com! =) And although I hate
to admit it, I'm starting to get back into the whole drum'n'bass thing.
(I can hear you laughing all the way up to Rohnert Park Lara! *smile*)
And oh, the new Depeche Mode album is going to kick fuckin' ass! :)
	Other things that float my boat are hanging with my wonderful 
friends, especially my raving friends (hi Lara, Ariana, Ryan, Perry, 
Fernando, Aaron, and everyone else!). 
	And oh, if you ever want to find me at a party, look for the tall,
skinny guy with a shaved head shaking his booty right by the speakers
all
night. If that ain't enough for ya, look for a GLOWING shaved head. Or
simply
ask around. :) Hope to see you all soon! =) (oh yeah, last two parties I
attended were Omnisonic and Warmth. At Omnisonic I was wearing black
silky
pants and an orange shirt, and at Warmth I had bellbottoms and a white
shirt. Did you see me? Cool! *smile*

	Now over to today's most important event -- Lara's b-day! Lara is
more than one of my best friends, she is also my promoter/manager. And I
wish her the best of luck! :)

hugs, jonas

I was wondering if anyone might be able to identify a song I heard in the
main room at Space Children. It's distinguishing feature was a vocal sample
that went: "I've quit smoking, for good." I just haven't been able to get
it out of my head. What a crazy sample to put in a song.

Thanks,
Terrence.

I am glad to see your positive post, but alas, I must take issue with you
dear sir.  Although I found your post a positive note for what has been a
week filled with flames, both perceived and real, it was from my view a bit
disingenuous.

You do not know me well enough to call me cool.  Getting information from
someone second hand does not qualify as really "knowing" someone.  You and
I have engaged in 2 or three e-mail back and forths, mostly acrimonious.
To single me out in an online forum given the, er, truth of our
realtionship (I wouldn't even call it that, more like a "Post-It"
association) as being ok/cool when YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN MY FACE, SHOOK MY
HAND, or at least BOUGHT ME A BEER is the height of hypocrisy in an world
filled with hypocrites and hypocrisy.

Now it's not like I don't want to get to know you or be your friend, that
is not the point.  I just don't like being singled out for your strange
form of , er, love and approval.  I would rather we at least know each
other before such declarations.

As for being thankful, I doubt I have done anything that you need be
thankful for.  I have done some gigs, and got to meet some really nice
people (here and as a result of many, many years of partying [man that
sounds tepid]).  I have contributed to all of this in my own way, but there
are others who have done more for the cause than I.  All I did was throw
good gigs, brought out some unheard DJ's, and helped others throw their
gigs when time permitted.  All of this happened years ago, proably before
you started going out, but once again, I don't know that since I don't
really know you, or your history.  Too many lollipops and platitudes such
that you have not shed light into who you are, and that's where we are.

I do not gladhandedly pour out platitudes for the sake of garnering
positivity.  Nor do I appreciate such banter.  I woulda preferred a minor
shout instead of being singled out.  After all Paul, we have never met.

Until such time, I guess a thank you is in order, although I would've
preferred it come from a place of reality instead of an attempt (as I see
it), to garner friends.  It takes time to make friends, and maybe in time,
we might both have the priviedge of calling each other friends.

Until such time, peace.

Out,
John

P.S.   The BEST way to get to know people is face to face.  Virtual is
rubbish if the contents make no attempt to communicate reality. Out.

"Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people
who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder
and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its waters... Power
concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will."

Hey Mars!

Is there anyplace in the South Bay that sells your mixtapes (and Myster-E
too)? I've never heard you guys spin before and I've heard that you 2 are
tha bomb when it comes to trance. If you don't sell them in the South Bay,
can I send you money for one or something? I need new tapes!

Brian,

There is considerable evidence linking the use of psychedelic drugs and
psychoactive drugs in general to the spread of HIV.  There are soo many
studies out now that point to this:

psychoactive drug use + unsanitary conditions + sex = HIV infection.

too many to cite, if interested I can give details.

Anyway, drugs have BOTh + and -.  I think responsible and safe use are not
emphasized enough.  Drugs + Sex can be a very volatile combination.

Food for thought,
John

If you look on the flyer for this party (Analog), it talks about DJ Joyride
(aka Greg Stevens)  and his new underground hit: "the non-smoking EP".  It
says "did you know I quit smoking? I really did...I haven't had a cigarette
since September" Not me of course, I had one yesterday :) Thats funny that
you should ask, cause it must be a really cool song if you were to just hear
it (without hearing about it like I did on the flyer) and think it was cool
and ask about it.

Thanks to everyone who came to our wacky dinner party last
night. Sarah and David did a great job of organizing everything and
getting all the food and chai together (you guys kick ass!). Our last
two dinner parties have been a total success, so hopefully there'll be
more stuff happening at Natoma on the Lake. :)

After dinner, some of us (those that weren't too SLEEPY :P) walked
over to MaD. And for the second week in a row, I was lucky enough to
be treated to some pretty hard sounds... last week it was T-1000; this
week Aladdin Sane tore up the dance floor.

Definitely similar music between the adjacent week's guest DJ's. This
week, the music wasn't quite as hard (but still *much* harder than what
we usually get in SF), but more experimental and "noisy" sounding... 
It was really good "fuck with your brain" music; lots of bizarre vocal 
samples, big huge distorted kicks, sometimes augmented with moving 
atonal synth lines.

The crowd's reaction was sort of mixed; some of the people were sort
of scared or confused, but everyone else was *way* into it (including
myself) and just going off on the dance floor. I always get a chuckle
when that kind of thing happens...

Steve

Hey Deepfog and SFR!

I had the raddest time at Warmth (I'm sure you noticed). For those I didn't
talk with at the party, I was the bald headed dude with the brown "M&M's"
shirt on. Was this the first party you've thrown? You did great!! Just like
everybody said, this party was like the old school parties I remember...
the way a rave should be. I had tons-o-fun dancing like a lunatic in the
main room downstairs. The system down there was phatt and the music was
perfect. I know you already told me once (tony), but who was that jungle dj
that started up right when I saw you downstairs. I need copies of his
mixtapes and big ass speakers to play them over so that I can feel that
BOOOOOOOM.

I also wanted to tell you that everybody that I brought with me (my little
sis, her friend, a friend from work, and his friends) had a good time too.
It was my little sister's first UG, and she said she wants to go again.

It was cool to see so many people from the list there too. I feel like I
know most of you, and to actually see who was who was cool. Special shouts
out go to SmileGirl (thanx!), Adam Mednick, Pablo, and of course Deepfog!
Who was that Supergirl that I kept dancing with?

Still smiling,
Ivan

Hi Everyone,

As you probably know, Apple is expecting huge layoffs to occur soon.  As 
a result, I very well may loose my job :(

I wont bore anyone with posting my resume, But if anyone has any leads 
whatsoever that I may be qualified for, please let me know!!

Here's a brief rundown of what I do:

Right now (at least for today) I work at Apple in the MIQ (MultiMedia 
Integration Quality) Department.  Basiclly, I'm a Quality Assurance

Hi!
        I am one of those post-shy freaks but I have to tell all of you how
wonderful and special Warmth and Spencer are. It was grand! And if you
didn't believe in the existence of Vibe, you would have if you were there.
And Spencer(one of the best hugs). He is the warmest, sweetest person and I
adore him(...and the 'remarkable' hair)!
        I wish I could have met a lot of you on this list who were there.
But soon...
        My darlings Jenny and John( biproducts of a Catholic education mind
you) E-ed for the first time and had an incredible time.  They were so
adorable and amusing...we HAD to be with them for most of the night.
        From all the posts, I can see that Warmth and Spencer have a lot of
admirers who have said all that I have wanted to say.

	There are more than enough djs who spin just about every type of 
hardcore techno and d&b to fill a night (or even a night and a day) in SF 
already. Some play the same styles as LA (with samples all over the 
place) while others play another type (take Sutehk's set at Shine for an 
example, it's lacks the samples but has more energy behind it in my 
opinion). The resoures are here...

I was wondering if anyone could point me in the correct direction to find
Rubber Duck and other similar digital effects software.  Most of my mail
was wiped out a few months back, along with the location of said software.

Thankya much,

Shawn,
       For me, its mostly going to a rave with a bunch of people I adore
and meeting other  people and sharing in this sense of fun-ness. It is the
fun-ness of raves. I would be lying if I said Ecstasy didn't contribute at
all to the fun-ness but you can do  drugs anywhere and you can only rave at
a rave. If it's a GOOD party(like Warmth), then you don't need to get
inebriated on anything to enjoy yourself. The combination of good music,
good atmosphere, good people, and what we holistically call 'vibe' is why I
go to certain raves at all.  This combination constitutes a 'high' that no
drug could ever give me. Harmony, Lepidoptera, and Warmth all possess this
combo. Oh and the parties at Bravo Co.( if I'm allowed to be immodest).
Although I respect but don't buy into the PLUR platitudes and would fail on
a rave-culture/music test, I enjoy raves for very basic and very simple
reasons: I like the music and the people and the community: to be with
friends and to have a good time.

I think you'd be surprised by the number of folks who have an
unconditional love for the music and a complete disregard for drugs...

On the other hand, I was surprised by the dawning realization that a
number of folks claim to have a similar love for the music, and yet make
drugs a central part of their raving experience.  This is not to say that
the two are mutually exclusive.  I just think that some folks should
seriously reconsider their priorities and change their internal dogma 
and external platitudes to reflect this.

Needless to say, lots of people love the music.  I was initially drawn to
the scene by the music, and it continues to hold me there.

I have loved electronic and experimental music since I was very young
and only had my parents' music to listen to. I later discovered techno-
industrial music (like Skinny Puppy, Front 242, etc.) back when I was
in high school, which eventually led me to be brave enough to listen
to hardcore and gabber. Of course, I wasn't doing speed or crack at
the time; I just loved the raw aggressive energy combined with the
hi-tech nature of the sound...

Now I also listen to trance, jungle, ambient, and if you catch me in
the right mood, maybe a little house. Though, I've never done acid, E,
pot, or whatever people think it takes to enjoy the music. No matter
what I'm doing; driving, eating, sleeping, or dancing, there's always
a beat pounding and some "beep-beep-bloops" either on my stereo or
running through my head.

I don't really see the connection between the music and the drugs. True, 
the drugs can enhance your experience while listening to techno, but it 
could just as easily enhance your experience while playing racket-ball
or scrubbing your toilet.

I hope this answers your question.

Steve

I am a sober raver now and I love goa.  Not to contradict you or anything,
but I think goa is actually one of my favorite dance-all-night kinda tunes.
It keeps you energized and keeps you going whether your high on e or high
on life.  =)

I wasn't going to get into this, but I show something about goa in here
soooo....

I would agree, actually I think it would weed out those in the scene just
because of the drugs and keep those that are in it for the love of the
music, people and the vibe. Which IMHO would leave you with a better vibe
at a party. I can actually go either way. I love the music and the people
beyond anything else. I do have fun from time to time, but I don't need to
do it. I still get in that same tranced out state wither way.

Wow, where to start.  The first time I heard Goa I was at my first F-8
party on a beach. I was sober all night. I first thought Damn there is alot
going on in this music. Then the next thing I felt was my eyes closing and
just going full force into a trance. It moved me so much, I finally found
the music I wanted to spin.

Listening to really good sounding and mixing of Goa is a drug in it's own.
I've sat and listen to Goa tapes and CD at times and when there over I feel
high as a kite. I would by lying if I said E or A doesn't heighten the
experence for ME. But I certainly don't need it to reach that trance state.
Goa I think is one of the most beautiful sounds out there. You just have to
get the right sound and have it mixed well. If it isn't, then no drugs will
help you. I for one started listening to Goa sober. I know there are alot
more trancers out there that would agree, Goa is a drug itself, a very
beautiful Natural High.

Well, I hate to admit this but, it took alittle EntErtainmEnt And Alittle
something with it for me to get into Jungle. I was candying when I just
trance out to a Jungle set. I couldn't stand it before. Now when sober, I
catch myself bouncing to the tunes sometimes. I'm VERY picky on it, but I
still catch alittle groove from it sober.

So sometimes it takes something to understand and grab hold of some types
of music. Then after that one time, it will eventually grow alittle on you
when your sober.

But as far as Goa goes, it's the only drug you need. It's a drug itself.
Speaking of which, I'm off work now and I'm going home to spin some Goa.

Later...and I hope this came out the way I wanted. I never am able to
really express myself the way I want in type. Typing about the love for Goa
will not do it justice IMHO. It's something that is better express in music
then in words.

What: Cyborganic's illustrious TND (Thursday Night Dinner) - New Wave Night
When: Thursday, March 6th, 1997 - 8 PM
Where: 654 Mission Street between 3rd & New Montgomery, San Francisco, CA

With the midpoint of the 80's already a decade behind us, that era is
not only fair game for but heartily deserving of cruel and unusual
parody. From Valley Girls to Prince to Duran Duran to Madonna, pop
culture of the first MTV generation was embarrassingly melodramatic.
The 80's were characterized by a lot of hair and a lot of hair products.

Whether you were into Dead or Alive, Aha, Bananarama, Depeche Mode,
The Cure, Wham!, or you were just a moon-walkin', break-dancin' spaz
in terribly modern clothes, the likelihood of self-consciousness
regarding this genre is inevitable, but the time has come for the time
has come to reclaim big hair! Reclaim valspeak! Take back that
shredded, tattered, ripped-up fashion and make it your own again!

with a rebel yell for the very first time i ran, i ran so far away
in my little red corvette, cuz girls just wanna have fun. oh come
on eileen take on me and our house in the middle of the street.
one thing leads to another.  staring at the sea is the glamourous
life. lies lies lies yeah.  99 luft balloons wake me up before you go-go.
relax, don't do it, when you want to come...

Yes this is exactly how I feel too. I find that listening to Goa produces 
for me the same experience so many people have described as the trip they 
have on drugs. I often thought of trying drugs myself but after 
experiencing goa I know I don't need anything else to achieve that 
Natural High. Goa is my "drug" of choice. And I also finally made the 
move to get my own turntables after hitting on this trance form.

Hi, shawn and sfravers,
I don't do drugs anymore, I've only done e enough times to count on one hand
in about one and a half months time.  I love to party. I enjoy the music
sober just as well as I did high, actually more in sobriety.  I also love the
whole aspect of PLUR in sobriety because when I feel peace, love, unity and
respect for someone or something, I know it is not drug induced.  I love
people at parties when I am sober because I remember all  your smilin faces
with your names about 70% of the time, and I love all of you whether you are
sober or not.  
I still love goa, I love trance, I love jungle, I love ambient.
A whole lot of love.
And I've been partying sober more than I've been partying high.
So, yeah, I do love the music  when there are no drugs involved.
smiles:)

Just heard a pretty infuriating song on Live 105.  It's called "Ain't 
Going to GOA", and it's a smug debunking of the rave scene and its "false 
spirituality."  Taking a supposed "house music" side (which the song 
posits as "real" as opposed to bankrupt goa music), it rips trance 
dancing and smart drinks, and conjures an image of white people getting high 
on Third World beaches (i.e. the real Goa in India) thinking that means 
they're enlightened.  It ends by claiming that real spirituality is found 
in the Church!!

Kinda ironic that this anti-trance polemic is found on a commercial radio 
station that features bands jumping on the electronic bandwagon as fast 
as possible!  

If I had more time here, I would like to get into a discussion about the 
facile spirituality surrounding psychedelics ingested by privileged white 
youth.  But this particular song's attack seems pretty vicious, 
especially considering that it comes from a source identified as 
"house."  What happened to one house, one nation?  Is the first face that 
we as a dance subculture present to the mainstream going to have two 
sides, an irreconciliable split between house and trance?  I know this 
already is rampant in the scene...parties and subscenes ossifying around 
just one kind of music... 

I personally find house to be rather lightweight compared to the intense -
yes, spiritual - experience of goa, but that's a far cry from denouncing 
all househeads as mindless posers.  

And I bet Live 105 is playing this because to them it is "hip," using 
vernacular you have to be "in" to understand.  Live 105 gets to appear 
cutting-edge while promoting more prejudice against the very music they 
are profiting from.  A neat trick!

Well, firstly let me say that I am a total goa-head and take no drugs
whatsoever (well, OK I drink coffee and the occasional beer). As people 
have said, goa/psi-trance is like a drug itself - you don't need anything 
more (although I can imagine that the experience can be heightened with 
the "right" additives).

I have also wondered, though, if the rave scene would be what it is today
if it wasn't for E, and I think it probably wouldn't be. E was probably 
what has made it the empathetic, PLURy movement it is, but I think that
once that movement has started, after a while the positive vibe starts 
to feed on itself. You get enough happy people in a room and EVERYONE 
starts to feel happy, whether they are on E or not. And after a while, 
it doesn't matter if NOBODY is on E - everyone is so keyed into the 
positive vibe and the openness and sharing that they come to expect
at raves that the vibe is there anyway and the drugs are unimportant. 
And maybe after a while people start carrying that vibe into their 
everyday lives and really starting to change their world outside raving.

I think that first and foremost it was the music that drew us all into
this scene, and it's the music that unites us as ravers rather than just
real nice happy people. There's a lot beyond the music though. The amount 
of love and creativity I see in putting together (say) a Harmony party 
or a Warmth (which I missed, damn!) constantly amazes me and brings joy to 
my heart. I just don't see this kind of thing anywhere else and it, as 
well as the music, keeps bringing me back. I can (and do) listen to the 
music constantly at home or in the car, but there's something INCREDIBLE 
about the vibe at some of these parties that is just really special, and
for me it has very little to do with drugs.

Well I'm rambling..... my 0.02.

Love you all, you cwazy wavers!

I know the song that Nancy's talking about.  I also note that the song
is totally over a house soundtrack with a cheesy-sounding barker talking
about how only _gospel_ music can get you high, yet the song _ain't_
gospel.  I detect a lot of cheek-embedded tongue in the song....

Still, though, I echo Nancy's concerns about divisive crap in the music
world and about privileged folks who think drugs == enlightenment.

I could possibly be one of the few people who (for the most part) enjoy the
music more sober than I do on e.  I just can't dance while on e (which
really sucks), if I'm wanting to be on e I find dancing & music distracting,
if I want to listen to music and dance, I find being on e distracting.  Like
at Madness for example, I could never have danced the way I danced as hard
as I did on e, I would have missed all that amazing music!  And I find this
a bit ironic actually, because I did not like techno until I heard it one
time on e.  And when I did, I thought to myself "Oooohhhh! I get it now!"
and danced like a maniac.  It's so opposite now.  I love techno sober, I
love when it just grabs me by the scruff and drags me out on the dance floor
to dance whether I want it to or not, and that will never happen on e.  On
e, I become Just Another Chill Room Victim, and I miss out on a lot of the
party.  Not so bad if the dj's suck! ;)

Anyway, that's my backwards perspective. :)

Love
Shawna

p.s.  However, I cannot claim this is true for acid.  But that is just not a
drug I generally do at raves, the one exception being Tribal Future up in
the Mendocino mountains.  Full moon blazing, beautiful woods all around,
raver tents everywhere, and pounding techno in the center!  Ahhh! :)  And
really, viewing anything with a new perspective (i.e. listening to music on
drugs as well as sober) will always give you a new appreciation and better
understanding of it imo.  E definitely did for me with techno, and I
certainly dont need e to appreciate it now.  It merely showed me a different
way to hear it, and once I realized it was there I was off & running on my
own. :)

this is my opinion. the entire scene is about the music & dancing. the drugs are just the "accessory"! i've gone to raves sober, and i've gone to raves completely fucked up, and ive come to find that going to a rave sober is the same as going fucked up! (just without all the water!)

        No, no, no. It's a country-western song, with a teensy little
        bit of synth blooping thrown in. That main instrumental lick is
        played on - a harmonica (I know, I know, no one on the list
        but me has ever heard one of these things. They're primitive
        acoustic instruments, OK.)                                              
	They clearly tried to choose the musical form most likely to
	be loathed by Goa-heads. (Go ahead? Make my day?)

I've already been roasted BIG TIME....  My partner Prentice has ditched me
and threatoned to kill me.    My banishment meant that I also lost most of
my posessions in an attempt to get away before his attempt to kill me.

I'm now in hiding,  at an undisclosed location with beautiful friends taking
care of me,   but I won't be going to any raves for a while....   I might
surface again someday,   but I'm nowhere near Southern Calif or Northern Calif
at the moment,  but am still able to read my Email.    I'm probably going to
have to get off of SFRaves because I have NO local access to the Inet
anymore because I'm so far away from ANY city at the moment.   My thoughts
are with you,   and perhaps someday,  when things cool down,  I might
surface again.

I grabbed a lot of Email last week,  and am going through the tons of SFRave
mail I gobbled into my laptop before I left Civilization.   I MIGHT make it
to DUNE III....

The people who took me in,  require that I be "Sponsored",  and any donations

I highly recommend DUNE III.....  I was at the last one (there was a comet

you have to experience.   It was colder that &*(*&*....   But when that

In my opinion the rave scene likely would never have gotten started without
chemical influence.  Most of the musicians use them (if you don't think so,
drop 2 or 3 hits of 'cid and listen to about any of it), most of the best
experiences (unity, et al.) start with e or a (of course once someone gets 
there, it IS easier to go back without the drugs).  From what I've read,
the Summer of Love (in Britain (late 80s)) was largely fueled by e, not to
mention SF's own Summer of Love (1967) fueled by Psychedelics mostly.  

I would agree with Hadrian about the "transitional, responsive, and maturation"
bits, because that is largely the pattern I fall into, but it mostly started
with the drug based/rave experience of dance floor/chill room unity love (plur)
feelings.  One gets opened by the keys and tends to stay that way for a while.

Exactly. In fact, in Scandinavia, people who do drugs at parties and
raves are looked down on by the "real" ravers. But at the same time,=20
I never get the same feeling of love and friendship at parties over
there as I get over here... =3D)

>and external platitudes to reflect this.

To me, the need for drugs fluctuates. At 2o12 last year, I danced by
the speakers for 7 hours straight, and I was totally sober. The phat
goa and acid just blew me away. But at Ohmnisonic this past weekend,
I felt the need to just be with my friends and "e my balls off" (as
some of you may have heard me say that night...). But then again, that's
just how I feel and work. =3D)

>Needless to say, lots of people love the music.  I was initially drawn to
>the scene by the music, and it continues to hold me there.

Same here, my first raving experience came at age 14, and I will never
forget how the music kept me going all night. The repetitive beats. The
deep basslines. The tweaking sounds. That's what made me come back.=20
Nowadays, it's a combination of my love for the music and my love for
my friends, old as well as new. And oh, the drugs. =3D)

Yea but that's nothing unique to raves. Back when the Jazz musician Dizzy
Galspe(sp) was popular, younger musicians were told that because Dizzy used
heroin, the only way for them to play as well as him was to use heroin as
well.

that jungle dj would be dj thad...not vlad!  some people kept saying vlad 
on their posts...and i thought (vlad?  wait i thought he like went skiing 
or somefun...)  =\

anyway, i listened to thad's set today, and he is one excellent jungle 
dj.  he works at solid grooves and is one of those people that just knows 
his music real well.  i highly recommend if you all haven't ventured down 
there, i think the addy is 360 s. bascom...and larry ching shops there!  
i know i met him a few years ago there.  back when it was still called 
like outer rythm or somefun.

I'll bet that 99% of the people that listen to live 105 have no idea what
the hell the song is about.  I think the song is pretty funny actually.

Personally, I think it's a rhetorical argument...

drugs have been found (if you're looking for them) in every musical movement
ever...prescription or otherwise...

there will alway be people who want to do drugs, and there will always be those
who don't...the music is kind of a constant (IM-mathematical-sort-of-HO)

We're on!

Though, once again, there have been a few changes.

Turns out, 3 of the 4 Dream Team guys got off the plane in Toronto, and then
put back on by customs officials and deported back to London. PugWash was
left all alone in Toronto. We tried to coddle him, but he got the willies
and bolted back home.

Damn Junglists and their criminal records!

So we've dropped the price, and have another guest coming in from Canada,
though I'm not sure who it is(!).

Prepare to get wrecked on the Gateway System:

9p-2a. 
18+ w/ID
$5 

Audioists:

Stareyes, Flux, Rinse!

call 415-332-5800 ext 24-7 for location info.

Oh yeah. This will also be the 1 year anniversary party for Hunab Ku! The
first year was good, but this next one will be even better! 

Also, I've got a few promo tapes to giveaway. A little selection of the
music we're bringing into the country. One side is HARD trance (dj Theron),
the other side, jungle (Flux & Rinse). There's a track listing for both
sides, as well as shops where you can find the tracks. I've only 10, but if
there is enough demand, I'll make more.

If you'd like a tape, please email me before 5pm. If you like, you can pick
it up at Audio Impact tonight. I'll have a list of names at the door for the

I just had to say thanks to everyone on this list that has brightened my day
and made my life a hell of a lot easier. I had developed a bad attitude
towards life the last few months, but finally some of my friends, and some
great postings to this list, helped me to turn it around.

I love you all...
Chris

GHB is no longer legal in the state of Ca, I think. It was legal because 
it was a steriod that body builders used. 

 I would say for all those people who are 
planning to take GHB go have a few beers and a toke  instead. Pretty much 
the same high.

The ironic thing about GHB is that if you don't take enough it feels like 
pot and alcohol, not worth the hassel of getting it. But if you take 
enough to get you fucked up, you usually end up being very ill. Oh, boy 
is that fun...... I love it when your friends are puking because they 
didn't know how much to take. HOWEVER on the the lighter note, you can't 
die, it just makes you sick and then after you sleep it off everything is 
fine and dandy.

I KNOW YOU ARE ALL BORED BY THIS TOPIC BY NOW. BUT I would like to 
interview or recieve emails from people who have opinions on the subject, 
for a paper I am writing. I would like to hear from everybody, so you can 
email me or have a conversation about it on line, what ever. 

Mainly I am trying to see the discorse that is out there for PLUR. SOme 
of it is very positive, and as the last few weeks showed it can be really 
silencing, and exclusive.  

I know you people love to chat so please do it with poor little me who is 
still sitting in front of the computer.

Ok kids! Get out your No.2 pencils, eyes on your own paper, you have 30
min.

(If this sort of joke has been done before, someone let me know. And if I
offend anyone, which I don't *think* I will, I don't mean to and I
apologize ahead of time. Remember, this is all in good fun)


1) Alex wants to leave the Massive at Home Base and go to a party in S.J.
If the map point for the other party closes at 1AM, and it takes Alex 1 1/2
hours to drive to S.J., what time does he have to leave by in order to get
a ticket?

2) GhostTribe spent $1,000 for a city permit, $800 on DJ's, $200 on
decorations, $500 for security, and $1,000 on equipment. If they made
$25,000 in ticket sales and $10,000 in bunk E sales, how long can they wait
to throw another party to support their $1,000 a day crack habit?

3) If Eric has 100,000 Blow pops in January and goes to 2 parties a month
where he gives away 250 blowpops each night, how many Blow pops will he
have at the end of the year?

4) If a DJ has a 2 hour set to spin, and each of his records last aprox.
4min 30sec, how many records can he estimate he will play?

5) If an E dealer has 2 ounces of pure MDMA and wants to cut it how much
Mescaline does he need to make 30% more profit and how stupid would it be
for him to use heroin?

6) If a beginning DJ has $2,000 dollars and spends $850 on turntables & a
mixer, $100 on a record case, how many records can he buy at $6 and at $8
each?

7) If Roger took 3 hits of Acid at 1 o'clock and the cops bust the party at
4 o'clock, how long will he have to wait in his car before he can drive
home?


Times up!

>  Our house is 100% culturally diverse.   Few 

What? YA. If you call diversity lots of white people and a few 
minorities.  Sorry but the idea that raving is diverse is such a joke. 
How many really poor people can afford a $40 night. This is a pretty 
middle to upperclass activity.  How many women of 
colour do you see actually running a rave or DJing? IN FACT lets do a 
survey, out of the 450+ members of this group how many  are minority? 
Then do 
another survey. See of all the raves run in the bay area how many of them 
are not white male run? THen why don't we count how many DJs are there 
that are women? Then we can do lots of variations of that. How many 
non-white DJS? How many women of colour DJS? How many gay poor bisexual 
vegetarians with disabilities? 

We care not 100% culturally diverse at all.

I am not flaming you at all. I just find PLUR problematic, and feel the 
need to raise the issues here. I understand that it's a great concept but 
we need to keep improving on it. The four letters itself means little if 
we don't continue to refine the raver's ideal. Otherswise we become 
stagnant, and worse very boring.

The poison of any drug is the dose. The problem with GHB (and many other
drugs for that matter) is that it's one of the most difficult drugs to
ascertain an appropriate dose of. Hence, GHB can be a lot more dangerous
than people think it is. To say that you can't die from it is a little
presumptuous. There have been cases of seizures (READ: serious shit!)
related to overdosing on GHB. You CAN die from a seizure, and you can at
least get brain damage. I recommend sticking to Nailvarnish's suggestion of
having a few beers and taking a toke, two things known to be relatively
harmless in moderate doses, which are easily measurable. And at least you
don't have as high a probability of getting sick and ruining your night, as
well as that of your friends who have to clean your vomit out of their
cars. Anyone who's had severe motion sickness will know exactly what too
much GHB will feel like.

7) If Roger took 3 hits of Acid at 1 o'clock and the cops bust the party
at 4 o'clock, how long will he have to wait in his car before he can
drive
home?

Roger could probably fly home......

This goes out to Suzanne, Andrea, Christine, Jenn, Maria, Tom, Keith,
Steve, Ryan, Amy, and Brian, and most of all James and Jamie, for
teaching me what friends are and how they care for each other.  Thank you
Jenn for everything you've done, before you knew me and afterwards.  Thank
you to the rest of my friends for teaching me valuable lessons in life and
love. I will never forget you.  Love Always, Kelly Marie

remember to always say what you mean.
if you love/like someone, tell them.
don't be afraid to express yourself.
reach out and tell someone what they mean to you, because when you decide
that it's the right time, it may be too late.
seize the day, never have regrets, and most importantly, stay close to
your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person you are
today.
each of your friends is a gift. they all have different wrapping, but that
makes them all the more special.

ANSWER: actually I believe the answer to that question is false.


REASON: Because if he took three hits there is no way he could find his 
car at 4 in the morning.... :)  he would actually have to wait untill 7 
before he realized he brought a car.

Now even I of course post non-rave related stuff, but if you can't keep
stuff *this* un-rave-related off the list, couldja at least maybe stick an
(nrr) in it or something?  Altho I really think this has no place here
(especially since I hate both coke and pepsi!)

I am not sure were you are going with your argumument??  All because the percentages are not 
strait across the board does not meen that the scene is not diverse.  I have never seen a sign 
in front of a party that says "No Minorities Allowed".  I believe that this comunity is open to 
everyone and gives everyoone a chance.  Thats the whole idea of an underground.  Mabee ther are 
no gay poor bisexual vegan diabetic female dj's in our scene, or mabee there are?  who knows?  
but the fact that there could be is enough to say that we are a compleatly diverse scene.  No 
one is stopping anyone from doing anything in this comunity for reasons of discrimination.  That 
wouldn't conform with the precepts of a rave.

What exactly do you propose.  Do you think that promoters should apply Equal Opertunity 
employment policies when puting together a DJ lineup?  I am not so sure I would agree with you 
that it is fair to book a dj just because they are Black or a Female.  It is much better to book 
them for their talent.  This is after-all an entertainmnet industry, not the DMV.  Lets keep it 
realistic.

The whole idealism of PLUR is the fact that is a vauge definition of very open ended concept 
that somewhat try to define the spirit of raving.  If we try to refine it or narow it down, we 
will end up creating bariers.  Lets let every individual decide for themselves what PLUR means 
to them.  The Idea is out there.  If you want to apply it to your own lifestyle, and set 
guidlines for your actions based on a refinement of plur, then that is wonderful.  But everybody 
has to decide to do that for themselves.  That is the foundation behind the diversity of our 
scene.

Peace, and keep it real.

Subject: Where to get cheap glowsticks!  (sorta nrr)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Hey all!

As some of you may remember, I was once known as the glow stick queen, every
time I'd go to a party I'd get the question "Hey can I have one of your
glowsticks?"  And of course my response was always something along the lines
of "Well I dont' know, I've only got about 20 or so left!"  (you guys
remember me and my glowstickw dontcha?)  I'd always have an array of colors,
green, pink, yellow, red, orange etc.  But for the past year or more, I have
ever been in search of the elusive Blue Glow Stick.  And not one of those
stupid little ones either (altho the small blue ones were hard to come by
also).  These mythological creatures have been spotted from time to time at
certain party stores only at very specific times of the year, for example
Halloween.  But I, in spite of my great search, could find none!  They
eluded me every time, at every party supply store, every scuba diving store,
every Grand Auto Supply.  I was beginning to think they no longer existed,
possibly hunted to extinction by ravers and others.  I really did hunt for
over a year.  And then the other colors started vanishing too.  No longer
carried at my local scuba diving store, no longer at Grand Auto, and the
party stores really did only carry them at Halloween, and oft-times only the
little ones.  And then one day I ran in to KC at a party (hi kc!), she tells
me I can mail order them, big blue ones even.  Kinda cool, but who wants to
wait for the U.S. Mail?  And then today I find it!  A carefully hidden
little party supply store off on some side street in Lafayette, CA.  Big
'uns!  Little 'uns!  Long & skinny 'uns!  All colors!  Even my precious
long-lost blue ones!  All year round they say!  Tri-colored necklaces they
say!  Wow.  Needless to say I was jumping around in excitement.  I couldn't
believe that after a year of searching, I'd finally found my glow-stick
supplier again, and especially that they carry blue ones, year round.  And
hot pinks, which also rule and are hard to come by.  And not only that, they
are the cheapest I've ever run into (without mail ordering that is).  The
big ones I'd buy would usually range between $2 and $2.50.  These big ones
(and they were the better longer lasting 8 hour ones) were $1.35!  Yaaay!  

So any of you out there looking for glowsticks who happen to be in the
Contra Costa area, or who occasionally travel along highway 24, go visit
Boswell's party supplies in Lafayette!  (altho it was weird getting there.
I called and asked for directions, and when I followed the directions, I
found myself at the place they are going to be relocating to sometime in the
future rather than the store they're at now.  Very strange of them to give
me directions to their future location, eh?)


Love
Shawna

p.s.  Amy- tell Mel I now can find an unlimited supply of big blue ones! :)

ok, i'm going to step and be the "you better think twice" grinch on this
thread (with a nod to jslee!)

but segratation is very rarely overt.  if, to take a more neutral example,
no martians ever show up to my parties, then i don't need to put up a sign
that says "no damn martians allowed!"  or if only one or two ever show
up, and we make them feel uncomfortable till they bail, then still we
don't need an official rule.  the proof's in the pudding, ray, and the
fact is that by and large even when a party is held in the middle of a
almost completely minority neighborhood, it still looks lily white to me. 

NOTE: i'm not saying there is some covert racist cabal operating in the sf
party scene.  i'm just saying, look - the fact is that we aren't really
integrated, even if by policy we are, so we ought to ask why is that?

again, almost right.  yes, of course it would be wrong to have quotas for
dj breakdowns, possibly increasing the bad spinning we hear.

BUT - on the other hand i've been to a bunch of parties where somebody
spun because they were a friend of the host, or the promoter, or of one of
the other dj's, and they had shitty records and no skills.  what's up with
that?

the #1 way to get jobs is contacts = friends, and if the pool of dj's,
promoters, and their circles of friends is lily white, then it makes it
damn hard for minority talent to get breaks when maybe they don't deserve
it, so later they'll have super-hard skills that make you say damn!

btw - i mean this all meant in a kind way - i find this sorta stuff really
easy to overlook in our day to day life.
matt.

HhMMM????  thats is a real good question.  I personaly always thought that the scene was 
intergrated, but you did bring up a good point.  I believe that htis perticular underground 
scene relyes heavily on word of mouth to spread the message.  If you are someone that is 
conected or asociated, then you may find out, if you are not, then you will never know.  

if you venture within the inner-circles of the hip-hip, or asian dance scenes you will notice 
reverse intergration.  these are also underground dance scenes and they probably consider 
themselves as open and accepting of all minorities (white being the minority this time), but it 
is obvious that they too work on word of mouth in there promotion and those not being in the 
loop, just do not find out.

The point being:  Since there is not an intergrated underground dance movement, Then no one 
underground dance scene can be compleatly intergrated.  The hip-hop scene is mostly black and 
hispanic, the asian dance scene is mostly oriental, the rusian dance scene is mostly europeans, 
the gay dance scene is mostly gays and bisexual - not heterosexuals......and so on...

I think that when it comes to intergration, the Rave scene is the closest that it gets, 
percentage wise at least, to a compleatly open and non discriminationg dance scene.  when you 
compare it to the other dance scenes, I think you will understand.

of course its all about your friends.  if you were a promoter, would you rather have one of your 
friends spin at your party or some body you did not know?  thats what being a friend is all 
about =>  hooking up your friend, and them hooking it up for you.

Anyways, gotta get ready for community, gota run

>because

I was told that body builders used it because it helped them sleep and
repaired their muscles while they were sleeping.  Also, you don't feel as
burnt out, the next day, as you would after doing some other drugs.
 

> I would say for all those people who are

>the same high.

I disagree.  I tried GHB for the first time a few days ago.  I was
expecting to feel drunk and stoned, like you said, but it was the
complete opposite.  Rather than feeling tired and clumsy, I felt
energetic and I felt like I could do anything!  It also made me so happy
that it was almost annoying!  I just bounced around my living room
telling all my friends how happy I was!


>The ironic thing about GHB is that if you don't take enough it feels 
>like 
>pot and alcohol, not worth the hassel of getting it. But if you take 
>enough to get you fucked up, you usually end up being very ill. Oh, 
>boy 
>is that fun...... I love it when your friends are puking because they 
>didn't know how much to take.

When I tried it, I was with a bunch of people.  A few of us were
first-timers.  None of us got sick.  We all had a great time, too!  One
girl fell asleep, but she had been sleepy all day, so I don't think it
was just because of the GHB.

I should point out that I was with a bunch of people who knew what they
were doing.  Anyone who uses drugs should know what they are doing, or be
with someone who knows what they're doing.  The people I was with made
sure I didn't take too much.

I really liked my first GHB experience.  In fact I'm totally looking
forward to doing it again...and again, and again, and again....

Love and kisses to all!!! :-)

I just thought I'd add an additional voice of dissent into this orgy
of fluff to hopefully discourage anyone else from adding their opinion
about coke or pepsi (which, by the way, are *both* toxic beverages
produced by huge profit-greedy corporations that are quickly buying
every square inch of the US. You choose, you lose).

Please!

NRR NRR NRR NRR

Use it!

NRR = non rave related. If you post something that has nothing to
do with raving, put NRR in the subject!!! This is not hard.

Have a nice day.

Bonus Question:

8) If CWP throws another massive at homebase for $6.00 and they put out
1 flyer per square foot how many homey-g's will attend and how many
fights will break out?  If you happen to be at the party what are your
chances of getting randomly stabbed at the back? If you decide to buy
some E from an unknown source what are your chances of getting bunk? 
And what time will you decide to leave the party?

indeed, drugs affect different people different ways.  most people find GHB
makes them feel a little drunk and generally relaxed, but i do know at
least a couple people who say it makes them feel bouncyhappy.

about dosage: BE CAREFUL!

the strength of GHB can vary GREATLY from batch to batch.  every time you
get a new batch, you should start with very little (no more than 1/2
tablespoon?) and see how it hits you before doing more.

overdoses of GHB have been linked to seizures, coma and even death.  if you
are careful and only take a little bit at a time, though, you'll fall
asleep before getting to that level of toxicity.

brian

 I find that at proper dosage levels it always makes me feel fine and 
sociable.

> about dosage: BE CAREFUL!

 Yeah! You might fall asleep.  ;)  Probably the biggest scare is 
combining GHB with sedatives (like alcohol). You are asking for nasty 
situations then like respritory arrest.

ummm, my experiences have not born this out. The dosage level has always 
been reliable. Whether crystal or liquid. Does not mean that it is always 
true though. It is always a good idea to start slow and easy with unknown 
batches. I would like to know where you are getting your info from Brian.


> overdoses of GHB have been linked to seizures, coma and even death.

 I've only heard of this when combined with other drugs like sedatives. 
I've seen people have _mild_ seizures. Very similar to people twitching as 
they fall asleep. I've also seen people take _way_ too much, pass out 
cold, and then wake three hours later and totally boogie.

 Brian. Are you getting this info off Hyperreal or what. Thanks!  :)

	Not personal experience, but what I've been told about GBH 
	by weightlifter types I occasionally hang with is:

	Low dose = upper/stimulant effect (like Libby describes)

	Med dose = drunkenness/downer effect

	Hi dose = out cold for hours

	The thing that makes it so weird is that combining it with
	any other drug (like even one beer) can change where the 
	transition points between the different effects are by a lot.
	Anyway, if you like the "upper" effect, remember you can't
	get more of it by taking a higher dose.

hi everyone,

i'll be in SF for maybe a month.  i may be looking for permanent
employment, i'm not quite sure yet.  i've attached my resume but i'm also
open to waiting on tables or something different and wacky, and i love
management so don't be afraid to be creative if you have any ideas!

at the very least can't wait to dance with you and anybody interested in
skating through GG park?  (or the entire city?)

brenda :)

It's Claudia,
How's everyone? 
Okay, I took the Pepsi Challenge in the 4th grade and I chose Coke!! I
remember how pissed off the Pepsi representatives were. I didn't get the
t-shirt. But, I will always choose Coke. Nothing compares and nothing
ever will. I can't stand Pepsi. Just thought I'd share my thoughts. 
Hope everyone has a great day!!
Yours,
Claudia

  so let me get this straight, you hunted for a year because you didn't 
want to wait for the US Mail?  I got my blue lightsticks for $1.50 each 
through mail order and it took them just two days to deliver them.
  BTW, USTOY sells:
 glowing hearts, glasses, necklaces (1,3, and 5 color), bracelets, ropes, 
stars, happy faces, and custom printed glowing button thingies 
(w/adhesive backs).  The last item has a hefty minimum order however :(

ok, you are correct.  a little research (which i should have done before)
reveals that all cases of severe negative effects from GHB have involved
either pre-existing health conditions or the use of alcohol or other
depressants.

it actually appears to be a very safe drug.

see http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/ghb/ghbfaq.txt

for a very informative faq.

sorry for the misinformation.

I just picked up "Time shard" by Hunab Ku, and all I can say is *WOW*.
There is a definite D&B feel to it, but it isn't confined to it, being
more textured like some of the nicer trance out. It's got me wanting MORE
MORE MORE! Anyone know of any other artists/albums in a similar vein?

                                             Thanks,

Thought I'd jump in on this...even though the thread is getting tired.
I have had many experiences with GHB...I have to agree with most of the
posts I've read and I think the idea here is the same that goes for most
substances. 
Dosage is the key factor. (I'm talking only physically)
I've had a great time on GHB and I've also regretted taking it like
nothing else. Different people definately have differ physical reactions
to it at the same dosage. I've witnessed my roomate passed out so cold
that we couldn't wake him up and thought he was in a coma, while his g/f
was jumping around and buzzing like a bee. They took exactly the same
dosage and he outweighed her by 40 pounds. 
I have not witnessed any permanent or life-threatening effects from
GHB;(although if one takes GHB, passes out, and vomits...definately a
serious situation) 
but I have noticed a particuar dosage window between 2-3 capfulls where
the effects fluctuate wildly and can be very disorienting. Taken in
conjunction with other substances...(alchohol & pot) can make the
effects intensify exponentially! I've seen all sorts of reactions;
intense horniness, anger and violence, intensified emotions, loss of
balance, disorientation, loss of memory, increased confidence, increased
insecurity....etc. I think GHB tends to intensify whatever you are
feeling emotionally and physically anyway. (somewhat similar to
psycho-active compounds) 
I've seen people finish taking a dosage and fall asleep on a couch 10
minutes later. Lots of people get sick, then really enjoy themselves on
it.  Personally, I did it a few times in college and embarassed myself
at a bar so bad I never took it again. My mouth was running with
insensitive and rude comments, I had no idea what I was doing, and all I
remember is not being able to see very well. Personally I couldn't
imagine raving on it....although at lower dosages it does give you
energy and a good feeling. But it is a VERY fine line between that level
and the above mentioned point being fubar. 
Sorry if I have repeated what has already been said...just my .02c. 
Peace,Love and homemade drugs....

Question:  What parties are going on this weekend and what are people's 
general feelings about them?

I'm new to the list.. and I've been out of touch with the scene for a 
couple years now.  I used to be totally into it, driving four hours to SF 
on a regular basis.  Raving definitely has had a profound impact on my 
life but getting caught up in school has kind of kept me away from it for 
a while.  I'm in Santa Cruz and a friend (who also was into the scene) 
and I have gotten fired up to go raving this weekend.  Sounds like Warmth 
and Basics were where it was at last week... so what about this week, as 
far as both massives and smaller more personal parties?

Anyway, I'm stoked to get involved with the family again... and looking 
forward to meeting lots of beautiful people!  :-)

Someone asked for a ComeUnity review.....  so...

I was really looking forward to the deep dependable house that I expect from Garth and Jeno, and from being in that special ComeUnity environment, where the ravers, the club kids, the cruisers and the just-wanna-have-fun folks come together.   But I couldn't stay out late (gotta work!) so I was hoping it would be goin' on early, as it often does.

My friend Sarah and I got there around 11:00, plenty of room to dance, which is great, and 1015 has remodeled and opened up the big room even more.

Unfortunately, the sound sucked, no treble, too much vibrating bass, and therefore a mushy sort of confusing sound.  (It looked like 1015 may have installed their own speakers and the Wicked sound system wasn't there?  I'm not a sound tech, but I know buzz when I hear it!) 

 And Simon was spinning the first set.  I don't usually respond to his music choices and his mixes, and this was not one of his better nights, I could hardly get myself to get into a groove.  All I wanted to do was dance, so it was frustrating.

The crowd was very clubby, there seemed to be few ComeUnity regulars there, and there was a drunk couple doing the dance floor version of the nasty in front of us for what seemed like eternity.  I was ready to go up and tell them I was with the club, and that the club rule was that couples dancingt was confined to the corners, thank you very much.  Fortunately, they eventually moved or left.

Saw only one person I knew (actually he recognized me! hi Andy) ... and left at 12:30 since the music never picked up.  I hope things got better when the next dj came on.   

I don't know if it's me, or if it's that the ComeUnity crew's heart just isn't quite in it any more, but it certainly is not anything like it used to be.  Ah well, such is life.  I guess I'm just spoiled, being able to hang out with so many wonderful ravers, that club life just can't cut it anymore!  I just WISH I could get my house music fix on a regular basis (other than my car!).

Hi All,

It seems there are a bunch of DJ's on this list, so I thought I'd ask you for
help.  I've just upgraded my little home studio and have come to the conclusion
that my weakest link now are my t/t cartridges.  I am currently using some
680el's.  I'm kind of confused as to which ones to upgrade to.  I've heard
some really great stuff about the Ortofon DJS's.  Is there anything better?

I'm using Lotus Notes at work as a mail program, and am having problems.

My messages don't wrap to a normal page size when I send them (is that on
everyone's mail server, or just mine?) ....   and I get lots of messages as
attachments rather than text.

Any Lotus Notes experts out there with suggestions?  I have no problems
internally at work, only when going through the internet.

Private responses with tips appreciated.

OK,
	I have 680's now but prefer Ortofons Concordes, then Nightclubs.
Concordes supposedly get better Bass response than Nightclubs but both
perform well when backcuing, scratching, backspinning etc. I have no
experience with Trackmasters but I'have been told Ortofons are better.

When someone says: "YOU DON'T KNOW JACK SCHITT"

Now you will know the entire story!

Jack Shit is the only son of O. Schitt and Awe Schitt.

O. Schitt, the fertilizer magnet, married Awe Schitt, who later ran the
Kneedeep Inn-Schitt, and together the had
six children.

Holy Schitt, their first child, passed on shortly after birth.

Next came twins: Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt, and then two daughters:
Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, and a son, Chicken Schitt.

Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt married the Happens brothers.

The Schitt-Happens children are Dawg Schitt, Byrd Schitt and Hoarse
Schitt.

Bull Schitt just married a spicy number, Pisa Schitt and they're awaiting
the arrival of Baby shit.

Now you know not only Jack Schitt, but also the entire Schitt Family.

I have been looking forward to this "Wish" for few weeks (although I go
almost every week, Mars and Mystr-E have a very special place in my heart
and I can't wait to see them, every single time).

I have to admit that the new set-up at "Wish" has been a little disturbing
lately.  It was great when you were able to have a beer and dance at the
same time, but I guess some people got in trouble due to underage drinking,
so now, the drinkers are divided from others with a big white cloth that
goes around the bar.  I wish the cloth could be a little smaller, so you
can see what's going on at the non-drinking tables, because having a beer
can get pretty lonely.

I went to "Wish" by myself knowing that dancing is what I want to get out
of the night.  Had few beers (yep, sitting by myself at the closest table
to the dance floor, so I can actually look at people), and then Mars came
on.  It took me a little bit to get into the dancing, but once I started I
had no time for anything else.  My roommate Ana showed up, so we were
crowding the dance floor next to Adam G.  What can I say?  Mars and Mystr-E
are definitely one of the best DJs I've ever heard.  Their music is so full
of energy, and it just makes you move harder, faster :).  I kept dancing
with a big smile on my face, my body getting more tired, my clothes getting
soked, but not wanting to stop.  The lights came on, the music stopped, and
it was time to go home.

This was definitely one of the best weeknights out :).  Too bad I had to
work in the morning....

If you haven't heard Mars and Mystr-E they should be on your list.  Can't
wait for their new tapes, because it seems to be that stuff they spun last
night was a touch 'harder' than on their tapes....

F-8 junkie,

well, I wish I could say that someone called me this, but actually, it's
from an ad I saw in the Guardian for a new novel.  "Morvern Callar" is
about a "Scottish rave chick" and her journeys through drug-soaked
scenes... has anyone read this/heard about it?  It sounds like it could 
have quality entertainment value!

And speaking of our scene popping up in pop culture, I learned (after the 
fact! :(  that the infamous 90210 rave episode aired yesterday!  Y'know, 
the one in which a high-school-age Brandon follows his carefree druggie 
girlfriend into the underground LA scene and takes a drug called 
"Euphoria!" (haha!)  I have yet to see this excellent piece of cheese.

Any other novels/tv movies etc. that y'all can think of that are set in 
the rave scene?  I'm sure there are some pretty humorous examples out 
there ;)

Jeez, the drinkers are actually segregated off from everyone else by a 
big sheet?!  I knew the rave scene was anti-booze, but damn!  This is 
gettin' ridiculous!

Yep, they've been best friends for so long, that now they're actually one 
person!

_Harder_ than on their tapes?  Eesh!  I have their latest ("Mars vs 
MysterE) and IMHO, it pumps very hard (and delicious) trance/goa/techno 
(someone help me on the categories!).  But maybe I'm a lightweight.

Glad you had fun, Branka!

one of the TA's in my class just wrote the neatest thing to our class
newsgroup check it out...
<clip>
P.S. There may be some who think that raves have nothing to do with
neurochemistry...they would be misinformed. 

and then he added a link to sfraves homepage for the rest of our class to
check out...so i followed the link to said "sfraves homepage" to discover
a really neat thing called the raver white pages...but it is not very up
to date...so I'll start with my bio and maybe we can figure out how to add
them to the existing bio's ...(derek?)


My name is Tony Rose
I moved to Berkeley from Arlington Virginia on June 16th 1993, from the
first day I was here I knew that I had found my home. THE BAY RULES!!
I have also lived in Orlando, Salt Lake, And St. George(bleh).
	i have always loved electronic music, from my early days when my
first favorite song was mr. roboto =) by styx,   then in high school I
started getting into the whole new wave industrial thing =() ...I actually
still listen to the ol bauhaus, love & rockets, front 242 every now &
then. I-)
	techno started happening in orlando just when i moved to Virginia, 
club Oz was going off, but I wasnt old enough to get in!!!
When I moved to virginia the most active music scene was the dead, I got
really into that scene for a few years, probably while the rest of you
were here raving at kickin full moons and insane massives... I learned
alot from the dead scene about community and how to be open to new ideas
and ways of life. I even went on a summer tour in 92 which is definately
one of the funnest and craziest summers i have ever had! We took my little
peice of junk $200 toyota from pennsylvania to georgia...and not one flat!
	I went to my first rave at some crazy warehouse in some CRUMMY
neighborhood in washington DC, it was incredible, it reminded me alot of
the ol days at visagei in orlando dancing to nitzer ebb or 242, but it was
happier and more human friendly =) ... one thing that I thought that was
really neat at that party was a couple of times during the night they
would completely turn off the music for a second, then this huge BOOM!
like a stick of dynamite or something had just exploded ...AHHHHH!! then
the music would come back twice as intense the room just WENT OFFFFFFF!!!
	I joined sfraves when i first got my e-mail account about 2.5
years ago and lurked/deleted for a while before i posted, meanwhile I was
exploring the club scene, went to a few sunsets, but was basically too
bogged down with school to really get involved. The first time i really
FELT the vibe was at Friends and Family summer 1996, the one with the
rainbow and belfast playing singing happy birthday to some guy named
joe while we all had the biggest hug ever! It was incredible! This party
definately passed the cup test...
	After that, the next friends and family was momentous again! This
time i finally decided that i was going to get more involved and I made an
effort to start meeting people that I had been communicating with for so
long virtually, brendan99 introduced me to about 4 million sfravers...=-()
	Since then I have fallen more and more in love with the bay area
the music and the scene...I have much hope that we will all go far...i
love you guys
tony rose

ps. see you at FREAKY!!!

Hi-

Every once in a while we get in a big discussion over what should be on
SFRaves and what shouldn't. Regardless of all the bickering, people
always end up posting what they want to anyways...

However, the LEAST you can do is add (NRR) in front of your             
subject, i.e.:

                 (NRR) PEPSI VS. COKE.

There are hundreds of people on this list, and the little things you do
matter.

-peace-

alex

Finally! :) Christine I think we are the only people on this list who KNOW
pepsi is way better than coke. Right on :)

On a side note, I heard that Pepsi sponsors RAVEs in Germany....so by
preferring Pepsi, we are indirectly supporting the rave scene :) 

To the next level, 
Ryan

Hi,

I have a pair of Ortofon Concorde Blue w/ elliptical tips. Since my
"scratching" amounts to spinning back to find the top of a phrase, the "e"
tips are better for me, and are rumored to track better than the "s"
spherical tips for "typical" (i.e. non hip-hop type styles) uses.

This is, unfortunately, a condition of running an 18+ night at Bahia.
They've been hassled by police so much that a physical separation of the
bar area was the only option left open in order to keep events from being
21+ exclusively.

If anyone's aware of any other 18+ venues in the city I'd love to hear
about them... =)

I need any and all humorous, dramatic or otherwise interesting stories
concerning raves (please, no Irving Welsh).  This is for a folkloric

     I saw an episode of "Captain Planet" (you know, the environmentally
conscious cartoon superhero show?)  Where somehow the planeteers had been
transported to the future.  Wheeler (I think that's his name--the anglo kid
with a sorta lazy attitude) was walking down the street when some dude in a
leather jacket and a mohawk gets thrown out of a window.  Wheeler bends down
and asks "are you OK? What's going on in there?"  The punker dude responds. 
"It's a rave...don't you know what a rave is?.......Man, what a jerk!"  And so
wheeler follows him into this "rave": a room full of people fighting and slam
dancing.  It was really funny.

beat...he finally kicked it off with House Music never dies..which just
sent everyone screaming...the chill room downstairs..was a different
story..it was so beautiful in there..the music was so groovy too..total
funk!..anyone knows who  the DJ was  downstairs?...well overall I give
it a C..true.. not too many Come/Untiy regulars around..i guess
Come/unity is just becoming too commercialized these days!....i hope to

Special Note:
	As some of you may know, a friend of ours was smacked in the face
because he yelled at a person whos' car almost hit his (This all
happened right outside the party). We have to be very careful about how
we deal with people in the dangerous world we live in. There are alot of
crazy people who have guns and knives and don't give shit about any
thing (including themselves). I don't want my new friends taken away
by reasons we can avoid. Be careful!

OK?....now.. lets get to the nitty gritty....

Deepfog and Spencer: you guys and whomever helped put this production
together deserve big Props...Huge!

The space is magnificant. 20 ft. cieling as you enter to the chill
space. This will help those out who feel a bit cluttered and want to
relax with some vibey people. The ventilation upstairs is also primo.
Matt was playing as we walked in. A very good mix of up and down tempo
music. Then me and my brother Gaby (He says Hi.. and he truly loves
everyone he met) head downstairs to meet some kick ass techno. Macadio
is spinning and he is very serious. Then, all of the sudden, BAM! 
he's hopping up and down pointing to the next rekkid he layed down. 
You can see how Djs affect the crowd with their energy. I love it!
	I then cruise back to the smoking dungeons. The first person 
I see is Leslie and her Phat Hat. Yay!! We sit and talk and smoke for 
a while, then its off to the chill area. At this point I'm running into
everyone I know and it is a great feeling to know such beautiful people.
I don't want to name names (exept for Leslie and Boomarang) because
it would take all day. But you know whom you are 8^) 
	It seems I spent most of my time at the chill room. The 
ambiance is so good there. But I do head down to hear Thads set, and I
am very impressed. I will go to other gigs to hear him spin Jungle.
AT that time I run into Boomarang Fidget. Yayy!! I've been trying to
meet this guy for a while. He is a greater person in life than on the
list. You all should meet him. 
	Next, Micron is spinning some killer trance. I'm running around like
I'm at Disneyland. Yes.. DISNEYLAND! you know..that feeling with 
no worries, and excitement of what the future holds. 
	Thanks to the crew for $1 water and Nub Chai. Thanks for 
the restrooms (ther were 2 ?) Thanks for the chill room with a tent.
Thanks for the music. Good sound system downstairs. I love the
separation of the bottom system. Thanks for the decorations Spencer. 
Thank you for the alter Leslie.  And everyone else, thank you for
your friendship. As short as it may be, it seems I have known most
of you a life time.
				Much Love 
				Vertigo
ps. I cought the beginning of Deepfogs set and I love 
"20 minutes of Disco Glory" 
You are the Bomb!

I heard that mixing GHB with alcohol or K can be lethal.  Someone told me
that the reason TV shows like Inside Edition are telling the public that
GHB is deadly is because they're focusing on cases where people's
(alcoholic) drinks were spiked with GHB.

maybe so...but some of my friends from Austin did it a couple of times and
loved it....they said it was a lot like really mellow E....or like
combining a bit of E with a valium or two....

but that if they had lied down and closed their eyes they probably would
have passed out....

anyway...I'm not super-eager to try it...it just sparked my curiousity
because it is, at least to me, a relatively scarce and new drug(but I
havent been going to raves on a regular basis since '92 in Austin when I
helped throw a bunch)....but I am a bit interested

Hi All,

It seems there are a bunch of DJ's on this list, so I thought I'd ask you for
help.  I've just upgraded my little home studio and have come to the conclusion
that my weakest link now are my t/t cartridges.  I am currently using some
680el's.  I'm kind of confused as to which ones to upgrade to.  I've heard
some really great stuff about the Ortofon DJS's.  Is there anything better?
Any other suggestions?

                                    Thanks for the help,
                                                        Eric

Amen, Tim!
I obviously don't need drugs to totally dig goa.  It is my favorite (can 
you tell by my sig file?  It is a line off one of my favorite goa tracks...)
Anyway, I listen to it morning noon an dnight (not 24-7, though!) and if 
I had to be on drugs to enjoy it, it just would not work! Anyway, that is 
my 2 cents worth.  Ya don't NEED drugs with goa.  It is the same concept 
as people who go into spiritual trances by chanting or meditating.  It is 
just a different level of consciousness and the music is the vehicle.

love and much shanti,
Amy

hey everybody.

i'm also spinning at a new hope tomorrow night. For your raving 
convenience, I'll make some comparisons to help you decide which event to 
support:

SPRING HEEL JACK			A NEW HOPE
==================			================
- you and 4 friends costs $50		- you and 50 friends costs nothing

- Bimbo's Nasty-Ass Bar			- somewhere near a large body of water

- homogeneous "spring-heel-jack-only"   - heterogeneous "dj-radon-may-play-
  set					  one-spring-heel-jack-cut" set	

- will probably close down by 2:30am	- will probably wind down at sunrise

- stuffy central heating		- bonfire and warm clothes

for coke drinkers:
- this is not it			- new hope is it

for pepsi drinkers:
- the choice of a doomed generation	- definitely the choice of a new
					  generation

see you all tomorrow night. :)

Hey!

  Don't I need rekkids to spin at a ravE?
  I got some really cool rekkids though.. Mostly break beat.. And you can
be assured; if I buy a break beat album, it sounds bad ass..
  But I am not ready to spin at a public ravE guite yet..
 I will leave that up to the, more experianced DJ's. Like Deepfog and
them..
 When I am ready to spin.. I will..  And be ready for sets with meaning.. 
Seriously.. Every set I put on paper, will not sound the same twice. They
will keep yea a stompin. And will have a story about me in them, yet, not
boring.  =]:.. .
  I frickin love this techno sh!t!!!..  Damnit...!

Ah!!!!  I am addicted to coffee now!~!!!  Just what I need. Another
substance to make me look even uglyer!.. Skeletor!

I'm sorry, but where do you get off disrespecting people's events like this?
Why do you feel it's necessary to make your event look better at the expense
of someone else's?  This is the kind of crap that goes on down in L.A.,  and
I wouldnt like to see this as a regular component of this list. 
There is a point to where this BSP stuff can get out of hand. I think you and
your crew may have reached it.

Hi again everyone, and sorry to crowd your inboxes.

My BSP was intended to be a joke, no disrespect intended at all... as my 
comment about my set was supposed to indicate, I think spring heel jack is 
amazing. On any other night, I'd definitely be going to see them.

Also, I should have put this on my first post, but I have no crew and am not 
associated with "rebel alliance productions", so please don't associate 
my comments with anyone but me. If anyone has gone too far, it is me and 
definitely not the dedicated people who are putting on this event for the 
love of the scene, and paying for it out of their own pocket.

No I am not saying that because that is a ridiculous notion. I am a 
minority and I have never felt that I shouldn't be at a rave because I am 
not white, and that I have never encountered anyway turning me away 
because of my ethnicity (I have in other situations) But I am saying that 
there aren't that many people pf colour in the scene esp when in comes to 
people who organise it. It's not the people who runs the party that is at 
fault, but we have to look at the structure. I never said Scott put out 
racist parties, I am slightly insulted to have anyone say that about what 
I said.

No, one of the problems is that women and minorities, and any cobinations 
don't spin. I hate the fact you're taking me all wrong here. I said they 
don't exist, and I think it's perprosterous to say we are diverse when we 
are not. Damn, can't we even raise questions?????? I NEVER SAID PUT A 
WOMEN MINORITY DJ THAT CANT SPIN ON!!!!! ANYWAY WHY IS IT THAT YOU ASSUME 
THAT BEING A MINORITY DJ AUTOMATICALLY MEANS SHE CAN'T SPIN. NOw that is 
outright racist and sexist.

 Sorry but I disagree Jeff. By sounding silly a lot of people hope to

You want personal stories or ones that have been written down already?

I have said this joke once but I am going to say it again, because it is 
so apt, and kinda reminds people that there are GENERATIONAL differences 
here. I know, trust me all the people here that love the scene now and 
stay in it, will one day say the same ol'thang. "it use to be....."

Q: How many ravers does it take to change a light bulb?

A: 15, one to actually do it, and another 14 to complaim how it use to be 
better.

Monty, I agree with your concern. But don't dis LA babes. I swear this 
stuff never happens on socal raves. Not to say they don't have problems. 
But this is not one of them. I don't understand the hatred of LA rave 
scene sometimes. It rocked when I was there. Sometimes I miss how NICE 
people were. REALLY

Ok, no more coke and pepsi stuff. If you guys want to tally, lets do 
something  RAVE related. SFRAVES? R A V E S 

Like house vs trance vs techno vs breakbeat vs jungle vs old skool vs 
ambient vs handbag vs electronica vs German Hard Trance vs English 
(focus: treble) trance VS American (focus: bass) progressive house vs 
Spanish  
Ibisa altenative  vs Hardcore vs gabba vs Happy Hardcore vs indian goa 
trance vs raves vs parties vs clubs vs which DJ you like best vs which 
record you like best vs which organisers you want to support vs which 
clubs on which night vs  estacy vs GHB vs Acid vs pot vs alcohol vs what 
you love about the scene vs where you think the scene has problems vs 
where we spot rave related articles vs reviews vs the MUSIC. (did I miss 
anything?)

GET IT? If your post doesn't have something to do with the above..maybe 
it's not about the scene. Look there are a million topics that can be 
spurned from that alone.

Someone who doesn't give a shit about sodas but a lot about the scene.

I have been partying down in LA for a while before I came up to the bay, =
and if there is anything it has taught me , it its that THERE ARE GOOD =
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE!!!  Perchance I am off the subject here, but I really =
resent the whole LA  vs. SF vibe that I see everywhere I look in the =
scene up here.  I think that this is an issue worth discussion (and I'm =
sure that fellow ex-LA ravers can back my up on this).  The scene down =
there is not better or worse, it is just different.  The people are =
different, the parties are different, the drugs are different.....  It's =
a different city!  People in SF rarely seem to realize that the majority =
of LA ravers are NOT out to make other people not have fun or be mean or =
whatever.  A reoccurring sentiment that is thrown at me quite often up =
here, is that SF is somehow superior to LA.  To all of you who have =
never partied down in LA, or met the fabulous people that I have,....... =


					Get off the high horse that you rode in on, and drop the =
superiority complex!!

I wish not to insult anyone, but I want to try to kill this one before =
it gets out of control.=20

As far as the diversity question goes, the only criteria that I feel =
must be met before one can throw parties or DJ, or do whatever, is that =
you must have the skills to pay the bills, or no one will want to come =
to your second event or buy your second mix tape.  It really is as =
simple as that.  There exists within our scene an amazing amount of =
talent as far as DJs are concerned.  Diversity will happen if we give it =
room to grow in.

Monty, I agree with your concern. But don't dis LA babes. I swear this=20

Seirra Nevada Pale Ale
Guinness (Extra Stout is better)
anything from Lagunitas

let me preface this post by saying these perceptions are based upon my
personal experience and beliefs and that i've lesarned alot bnut i don't
really know shit because each moment is new and i'm constantly having to
relearn things and be open to a new perception so...


well, i love all of you guys no matter what your perceptions/opinions are
about this scene or that scene.  i would like to say that i travel alot
and have yet to find anything so terrible...i mean everything at a party
i guess alot of this has to do with the fact that i just let go of my 
job in Portland to come to SF to work on music so this all means
quite a bit to me because i never really wanted to live in SF but my
life has definitely taken on a course of it's own so i'm gonna go
with it.

see ya on the dance floor...

brencould be exactly NOT the way I would do it and
i still manage to
have
a good time or find some value in some drama...i've had my share of small
dramas in SF and i still keep coming back because i love you people and i
love myself enough to give everything a chance.

My friends and I just went to this.  It was so nice!!  I don't know who
was spinning while we were there, but he was playing some beautiful
stuff!

Also, it's not just a cafe, it's an art gallery!  There is so much
beautiful art there, I didn't ever want to leave!!

If you live in San Jose, or have no problem getting there, I definitely
recommend going to this!  It's a small cafe, so it's really got a nice,
calm atmosphere--perfect for a Thursday night. :-)

Ryan, 
you know I love you right??? just wanted to tell you, it seems your trying
too hard to get people to drink pepsi when it's pretty darn obvious that we
kids here choose to drink COCA COLA CLASSIC, RED WHITE AND YOU. ALWAYS COCA
COLA.
so, sorry Ryan, but it really does seem that it is always coca cola.
but I love you even though you choose to drink brown carbonated suger water.
see, coke is better because its
brown-carbonated-not-just-sugery-sweet-their-is- something-special-in-it
water.
of cource give me a tall glass of 10% fruit juice 90% saccharine any day.
But I prefer odwalla, my wallet doesn't though.  As long as the apple juice
is flash pasturized I'm okay, you're okay.
g'night, or day whichever it may be.
love
april :) {{}} <3 (4)<<~~~that means you needa hug april someday cuz she likes
to hug people, it gets her high w/out taking drugs.

ps... i just wanted to add something.  whoops. forgot what it was. I'll get
back to you all when I remember.
Oh yeah, I remember now...
whenever I think I want a cigarette, I imagine it as a cancer stick going out
and attackin my nice clean pink big healthy lungs and I wanta kick it's bum
and get it's evil thought outta my head.
So, yeah, their ya go, canceer sticks'll kill ya, so  stopp puffin on that
bs. Oh, and for some off you "I only smoke a few a day" smokers, I challenge
you, buy a pack, sit for an hour and chain smoke. No pauses or breaks just
smoke till you puke in the gutter. trust me, tomorrow morning, the thought of
a cigarette will turn your stomack.   And who knows, maybe youll stop too.
That will be an excellent day.
I tell myself that if I ever want a cigarette I have to buy a pack, sit and
smoke till I puke, and the thought of that is such a turnoff that I don't
smoke.
So hey, try it, you might like it. or i mean, you might quit.
Don't let them fool you into thinking that noone likes a quitter either, I
love quitter, they make my day.  And besides, don't you wanna be cool and
smoke free, like me???
okay, ramble ramble ramble.
sorry bout that. but I love you guys and smokin's bad for ya.
Gotta watch out for my friends, right??? Don't want any of you to die on me
before it's the smoke free time to die.  Live long and prosper (smoke free
like me)
love april
g'night for real this time ;)

Regarding the Ortofon DJS's, I've owned a pair for a little under a year now,
and recently (past 3 months) they have been giving me many problems... one
cartridge has noticibly lower bass response, sometimes the left channel will
die on them, and I either have to wiggle the cartridge, or pull it off and
lick, yes, lick the contacts. I understand this is a somewhat common problem,
I learned the lick-trick from a couple of guys down at solid grooves.. I
don't know if this is still a problem with the new ones, but just thought I'd
let you know.. the styli (sp?) last forever, tho, provided you clean the dust
off regularly...

I couldn't agree more with Monty about this.  If there was any indication
that the Spring Heel Jack show was being promoted by greedy corporagte
slime, then I could see some invidious dissin'.  

But I saw the SHJ show in Portland, which the promoters *dropped the
price for* because tickets were not selling at $8, to $2.00.  I don't
know if SHJ's fee went down, but the point is, in Portland the
promoters may have lost less money because they cut the price to a
can't-lose-let's-check-it-out level.  

They did a very good show that was livened up after they were done by
a short jump-up set by one of their crew.  There were at least 200
people there -- not too many to be crowded and not too few to make
it look empty.

My conclusion: this SHJ mini-tour is blessed with positive direction
and something, at least in Portland, we haven't seen for a while, which
is a serious U-turn on promoter ego and greed.  

I also think it's worth going to SHJ because Bimbo's is a seriously
wierd SF landmark that nonetheless has a bit of charm.  I saw Pele
Juju there years ago at a Usenix party, and then went to see Gato
Barbieri a while back.  

So, you can go get dinner at the Stinking Rose or just a bit of dessert
at one of the Italian cafes (which if overpriced are at least genuine),
or just stroll down Columbus and check out real drum&bass at a no-fooling
relic of SF from the 1950s.  

I think Spring Heel Jack deserve some attention.  I gather they've been
living somewhere around SF the last couple of months, or at least have
stopped over in town for long stretches.  Their recorded output shows
high quality production and innovation.  I don't think they have the
knack for reaching the heart that, say, Orbital do, but what they do is
good and does not follow the half-dozen conventional routes for jungle/d&b
as it now exists.  Their sense of adventure reminds me of what jungle
was like 18 months ago, when it was at its greatest level of ferment for
me anyway.  

Now then, let me also say how much I like and support, and how important
it is to have, outdoor/free/chilled-and-vibed-out events.  I lived for
them for a couple of years and miss it a lot.  The music is bound to
be as good and wellmixed as most any commercial event, and there is
a sense of adventure every time you go outside that is simply different
and more open-ended.  

So, consider what I would do if not for being in Portland this weekend:

GO TO BOTH!

***WARNING.  THIS POST CONTAINS INFORMATION THAT MAY ATTACK SOME OF YOUR 
EVERYDAY GIVEN LOGIC.  IF YOU ARE NOT OPEN MINDED AT ALL, YOU MAY NOT 
WANT TO READ THIS.***

hello everyone...

well sorry if this got through some people's filters...i am aware that 
some people have a rather rigid agenda that they expect everyone to 
already know and obey.  so 1,000 appoligies to those people in advance.  

i won't make this too long, i think.  but it seems there is a pattern and 
yanno i probably could run filters call one of my friends over and have 
that set up...but yanno i really don't mind pressing delete a bunch of 
times.  in fact, i deleted the entire pepsi/coke thing because i just 
didn't feel like contributing time to that.  by the time i send a post 
complaining about it and then get all the responses, because we all like 
to hear our own voices don't we?  by that time the thread is already over 
nstuff (hi jeff!)

but this is no longer any one person's list, and no one owns it.  ok, 
well someone started it...and let's all thank that person quietly or 
privately inside our minds.  

but just like a rave is no longer a promoters' party (sure, they create 
and set things up, but then the party is dominated by the people inside 
and enjoying it.  

and that's what sfraves is.  or any discussion group, really.  and there 
are hundreds of people on here.  most of them im sure got the ettiquette 
list and filed it away without reading it.  besides, it's been proven 
scientifically that we retain about 7-10% of the information we take in.  
im actually about 2% sometimes.  im not perfect.  and i don't expect 
anyone on this list to be, either.  so sometimes useless, non-rave 
related threads are going to start.  in fact, a lot, considering the 
number of people that logon, and logoff, and new people, etc.  

now try not to misunderstand things here.  i do think there is some kind 
of common sense ettiquette people ought to be abiding by.  i am not a 
proponent of cutting down ANYONE'S organization i don't care HOW bad they 
are, because that's what the masses do.  ever notice that?  how it's kind 
of cool to be neg?  we have all these stupid sayings on tshirts like bite 
me and just other negative just crap all over the place.  we are 
constantly bombarded by negativity and then we wonder why there is so 
much violence in our society.  i mean, duh?  =\  can we add?

now im certainly no expert on sfr ettiquette, i get out of line too, and 
sometimes i just feel like having fun.  why not once in a while?  it 
lightens up the list i think.  but heres' a little secret i found about 
dealing with some of the more negative and useless topic types of 
topics.  are you ready?  

sure?

the delete key is very useful.  you see, i often tell my sfr friends that 
i hang out with that sfr is often like watching tv.  there's good 
channels and bad ones.  can you all relate to that?  ok, the only 
difference, though is you can directly respond to those channels and 
create your own channel...or your own show.  

what channel are you on?  what show are you watching?  do you really want 
to be on that channel?  

some of you seem to read and nitpick every little thing that people write 
as if you're looking for something wrong to point out to everyone.  some 
of you people need to get out more...seriously.  lighten up.  i also 
hear a lot of read through your post and edit it and spellcheck...that's 
great too, but this is a freeflowing discussion group, not an english 
class.  and when was the last time you made a friend based upon how well 
they could structure a grammatcially correct sentence?   i see that going 
on all the time.  the nitpicking.  it creates these loooong ass threads 
that i just delete.  i could try to be a mediator and tell them to 
stop...but i've found by experience that some people aren't ready for 
that.  so i usually dont' feed their fire at all.  just let them rant for 
a while.  and let them be right.  watch how quickly they take it back and 
stop ranting.  ranting just creates more ranting.  

ok, i might have attacked some of your personal logic because i might 
have said something offensive.  in fact, i've been warned privately 
sometimes that im going to get "flamed" for stuff i've posted in the 
past.  go ahead, flame me.  i don't care...last time i checked this was a 
country where we still have the right to free speech.  i ask if you want 
to yell at me for something i said, if you're angry, and are going to 
express it...please.  do it privately.  give everyone a break.  you see, 
i say what i feel, and i think others should do the same, and you know 
what?  it doesn't always make peace.  some of you are trying to make 
everyone happy and not step on anyone's toes.  sorry.  life's not that 
easy. if it were, we'd all be happy and live in a perfectly clean world 
and raves wouldn't be underground.  in fact, life would be probably very 
boring.  more on that later.

now there are some of you that might totally agree with me.  fine.  i 
appreciate it if you do...and if you want to thank me go ahead, but 
before you do...just remember one thing.  the best way you could thank me 
is by going out and making a positive impact on someone else's life.  i 
don't need 45 "cool, i agree with you" posts.  be specific on what you 
agree with, if you would.  

most of you will lie somewhere in between, depending upon what type of 
programming lies in your brain and controls your mind.  just remember, 
the mind is like a parachute.  it's only operating at full capacity when 
it's totally open.

Good morning everyone...

Well, well, well... As I stated before, it's time to start paying the 
price of promoting.  RAS is a group of people that want to have a good 
time, plain and simple.  Some of us are 21+, some are under 18...  All 
we want to do is give back to the scene that has accepted us for who 
we are.  And that is a beautiful thing.
I've gone to FTT parties and the vibe is pretty good.  We have no 
disrespect towards Moshie nor any of the other promoters out there 
(Clare, Ethan, Mars, Mystr-E, Thomas, Ben & Dhrien,ect..).
Radon has apoligised for his statements, but he's excited, I am too... 
 It's not about competition, superiority, who has the biggest laser 
ect...  It's about the love, the vibe that comes across from us and 
the music we provide and you and the vibe you create.

I am looking forward to seeing the many of yous that's as crazy as us 
and will be on a chilly beach for a party (For the past 2 days we @ 
RAS have been doing wood runs to provide a decent bonfire).  Again, if 
anyone was offended by the SHJ RAS  thingie, our sencerest(sp) 
apologies.

(Taking spelling lessions from Vald)

Personal stories are preferred, a must actually, the more vague the
better.  i.e. "this guy I know told me about this guy who took acid and. .
. "  Stories that are more specific (involving accurate names, places) are
fine but I'm really looking for rave "lore."
Thanx

Speaking as one who was involved in throwing several parties in LA, I can
vouch for the veracity of Monty's statement. From late '92 onwards promoter
greed, competition and backstabbing diminished the scene greatly in LA, to
the point that large undergrounds died out almost completely. Even among
the smaller undergrounds and weeklies, promoter infighting was rampant -
something I experienced firsthand. At one point in the planning of a large
event ironically meant to bring the LA scene together, a bullet was shot
through the front door of one of the planners and the event was called off.

Even now there are only a few groups I can think of who are doing heartfelt
underground events in LA - fewer than in SF, which is a bit odd considering
LA has at least 4 times the population of the bay area.

All of this has nothing to do with your average raver in LA - ravers are
ravers everywhere. =)

Joe

Hi all,

Just to clear this up...

I also think that it's weird having that division between the drinkers and 
non-drinkers, it breaks up the room, and it sucks if you want a drink and 
you're friends can't come in there.  But, it was either that, or stop 
throwing Wish...I chose to keep it going....

What happened was this...We were going fine with having a mixed crowd 
(drinkers & non-drinkers) and Bahia didn't seem to mind as long as it was 
monitored.  However, the city's authorities didn't see it that way. 
 According to drinking age restriction laws, the only way that we could 
remain open was to have a physical separation of the areas, so that those 
under 21 could not get alcoholic beverages..blah blah blah...

So, we did it...We put up that dumb sheet, and now have way too many 
security guys checking people's id's and such, and quite honestly it's 
annoying...but we had no other choice.  In fact, the Bahia is in danger of 
closing it's doors to 18 & over parties for good, and we are currently 
working on not letting that happen...if it does, we are already looking for 
alternate spaces..."Wish" us luck.  :-)

Thanks for listening...

Smiles,

Scott =)

I would like to add to the list, Paul if you don't mind me doing so.

11.  When PHAT DJs come and play a half-ass set :(!

12.  When the DJ set up is up on a stage. (I don't know about you, but 
 I like to interact with the DJ.  He is part of the vibe too =)!)

13.  Circle dancing. (Someday these people with figure out that people 
 dance alone but in unity as a whole.  Then again, maybe not.  
 Someday at a massive, I would like to start an energy circle =)!)

14.  No SmileS. (You can't have a party without those :D!)


Well, there are many other things I can say about bunk parties.  All I really
need to say is that you make the vibe.  When all seems so bunk, make good of
it, and have fun with all of your beautiful friends =7!

Love you all!  Lotsa huGGGGGGGGGGs!
Keep smilinG =D!

oxoxoxoxoxox,

PAULA >=^b!

Paula added to Paul's list of reasons... 

-----------------------
13.  Circle dancing. (Someday these people with figure out that people 
 dance alone but in unity as a whole.  Then again, maybe not.  
 Someday at a massive, I would like to start an energy circle =)!)
-------------------------

I know lots of people hate circle dancing, but maybe if you take a 
different perspective for a minute... 

Circles are about performing for your friends, showing off your
moves while they can actually watch and you can give it your all,
dance full out 150% for a minute or two... 
then it's the next person's turn while you rest.

Circle dancing is different than trancing out solo, and the people
who like circle dancing are often into a different interaction and
dynamic.

Does that make it wrong???  NO NO NO!!!!!!  I love watching circle dancers
(when I can get close enough without being squooshed) because I love
watching people show off doing what they love.  Yowzah!

I think what people REALLY object to in circle dancing is that it
creates a bottleneck on the dance floor.  A circle gets bigger and
more immovable, and the individual dancers get crowded out.  

Remember my story of being kicked back by a young circle dancer 
at a party last year who somehow thought that MY space should 
have been HIS space?  (Silly boy. Don't mess with my dancing 
space!  He'll not likely do *that* again!)

At Love A-Fair, I saw a wonderous thing.  Outside, where there was
plenty of space, there was a huge circle of... ravers!  Lara and her
crew were circle dancing, and it was awesome to watch, because they
got to experience what it's like to perform for your friends.  Many
big smiles!  Happy ravers!  Dancing in a circle!  (you guys didn't
know I was watching from the railing, did you?)

In a way, circles ARE energy circles.  Different strokes and all.

So, if you like circles, please be considerate of the traffic flow
in the room and don't be a space hog.  And if you don't like them,
maybe stop and watch what it's all about for a while.  You don't have
to be a great dancer to enjoy watching!

Love, Leslie

I totally agree with you =)!  I love when people come together and interact
with one another.  And no circle dancing is not wrong at all.  I believe it is
wrong when they are dancing to out do each other.  I think they should circle
dance to share (moves), learn (moves), and to make happy energy together =)!

Yeah sometimes circle dancing can be a problem for some people.

I like the way you put that :D!  You are very right!

Each rave I go to is a DifferentStory... 
in this Story, you get to be your Own character and do whatever you like
and
be whoever you want to be. and no one can take that away...

in this story, you get to meet other characters, some might share the same
vibes as you, and some might not...

Imagine being in a place, in which your fantasies, creativity and 
imagination are one of the most important things...with the goal being
to make yourself happy by making everyone else happy :o)

I dunno... I wish I could write a book, each chapter would be a different
party...all forming one BIG story.... a Never-ending story ;o)

Friends,

I find myself with a group of earnest dancers who are all looking to _me_ 
to find the perfect spot on Saturday night.  So I need your help!

I see nada on the calendar, and I'm thinking of turning to the clubs.  Is 
there _anything_ halfway decent that night in the city?  I would like to 
avoid prog house and Wild 107 house, if possible :P

*Non-rave* has anyone seen JungleBooty?!  Afro wigs and 70's covers at 
Club 181 on Saturday nights... This is my reserve choice!

Thank you!

Just to confirm what I was posting about a couple days ago, last night at
the Fillmore, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir of the Dead joined saxophonist David
Murray and his band for a bunch of Dead songs, including "Dark Star" and
"Shakedown Street."  (Sorry I was mistaken about Mickey Hart showing up as
well).  But all of us who were there know how out-there it was, and as the
karma gods had Susan and I next to the stage right at Bob & Phil's feet, I
can assure you they were loving it too!  We hung out for awhile with
deadhead raver Randy (or is it Andy?) with his red-lit crystal scepter and
perma-grin, and I saw an old tour-head friend who has settled with some
Santa Cruz spinners ... a great night.

Granted what you say is true. I personally cannot varify what you say nor 
discount it. But it's the backstabbing here that disturbs me. LA this, LA 
that. Well it's not exactly nice either. I mean honestly it turns me off 
the SF scene when I hear statements like the above mentioned, (not yours 
but mine). "It's like sorry for not being San Francisco. We can't all have 
the fortunate luck to reside in the area since birth." I will always have 
a soft spot for LA, and like most of us there we don't say bad things 
about the SF scene, I will not now. My mommy says people who talk shit is 
insecure with themselves....No could it be the SF scene is jealous? 
(before you kill me it's a joke.) 

 You are one of the few people that I 
have heard bitch about LA that have had expierience with it. It's a damn 
folk lore....who was talking about it?

Hey everybody,
YEA!! It's Friday!
I hope everyone has a fantastic weekend. I am going to rest up and heal
my sick body. Last weekend wore me out. I hope to see everyone next
weekend. I really enjoyed meeting most of you at Warmth. It's nice to
put faces with names. I now feel apart of the scene. I love you guys and
when I see you expect a big hug from me. Be careful and fill me in on
all the excitment the weekend brings.
Yours,
Claudia
Hey, Leslie I need to talk to you so email me!! Thanks.

For now, I figure, since I'm on here, I'll talk...  (surprised? not!)

Tony/Deepfog said somthing that reminded me of something 
that happened to me once.


> ever notice that?  how it's kind 
> of cool to be neg?  we have all these stupid sayings on tshirts like bite 
> me and just other negative just crap all over the place.  

I was out one night, and through the crowded dance floor, I noticed
a big geeky kind of guy, nice face, but wearing a shirt that said... 
in big white block letters on a white shirt... FUCK YOU.

I brooded on that, thinking how negative to actually want to wear
something like that, and to walk around with such an obnoxious
message on your shirt...  

I was just about to go up to him and inquire why he wanted to wear a
shirt like that ....

then I got closer, and I saw that it said....

FUCK YEAH

And I said to myself... FUCK YEAH!!

See, things are not always what we think.  Right on.

I'm between calls sooo...

I don't think in terms of #1's and #2's.  Who cares if blah, blah, 
blah's parties are this way or the 'tude over there is like that.  I 
only see places that are worth noticing and the all have a place, not 
ness. gauged by importance, but by the way they've helped us grow...

Scene legends:
LA - Rightous.  Hardcore scene.  Desert raves.  Ill ass beach 
parties.

Detroit- nuff said?                       Germany: Well.  Duh.

Chicago- See Detroit.                 Goa/Bombay:  New genre of 
trance

NY- Breakbeat haven...              Manchester/England: Yeah!!!

SF-  Oh yeah, we're known...  FMR's are known for their 
renagadeness...

Shit I knew I would be misquoted. It was a joke!!! Don't kill me!!
I merely stated the idea. I don't believe it. 

But seriously, why? Every one I know in LA respects the SF scene. I just 
think it's sad that it's not reciprocated. I Love the all out way people 
here organise, but I miss the all out way people party...and get all 
decked out down south. It's a trade off. There is no competition, 
somehow so many people make it seem like one. I think the two places can LEARN from 
each other and then create the ULTIMATE rave.

Back in junior high school..

  When Break Dancing was popular.
  Circle dancing was a sport. You go out, bust your moves, face someone,
and "Call them Out". This is what it is about at the ravEs (opinion) Just
like in the old days; it is a friendly game of dancing.
  Unfortunetly, I'm kind of selfconcious about break dancing these days.
Because I used to do it all the time in Junior high school. And when it
fell off of the face of the earth; people made it out to be "stupid" to
break dance afterwards, back in high school.
  I don't think it's uncool or stupid to break dance at the ravEs though..
Now it's just that, I like brain washed myself into thinking; I am to old
to spin around on the floor all night.  But who know.. I busted out with a
flawless flare @ Space Children. Maybe I will practice once agian, and
become the best. Once agian..
  God knows I could use the extra exercise..
   But for now.. It's all about trancin out in the least crowded corner /w
the best stereo input.

I don't think everyone would necessarily agree with that. Look at the
fact the Bay Area's hi-tech industry is the best in the country (yes,
it is well known that there is a shortage of technical people in
LA). We have significantly less violent crime and theft, far less
pollution (I became physically ill from the air on my last trip
through LA), we produce Odwalla, we create a mere fraction of the
commercialism and schlock that LA does, and so on...

I guess people like LA because you can make a lot of money...
Okay.

	No death required. Don't freak out. I wasn't even talking 
	specifically about the rave scene. SF is the #2 city in CA
	with respect to lots of things (population, political clout,
	...) and I think it does create a certain "general" attitude
	in SF about LA. That's all I'm saying.

Thanks Leslie, for the reasonable perspective on circle dancing.  I used 
to love watching them ALOT until I found out the reasons why others 
detested them.  Then I was sort of a "closet circle watcher".  I 
appreciate people's dancing talents, partly because I lack it so 
much and I love self expression through dance as the art in itsself.  I 
still feel that circle dancing is inappropriate when there is not enough 
room for it and it infringes on those who do not wish to participate or 
watch.  I'm sure most of you would agree with that. ;)

love,
Amy

Would a seperator that still allowed visual contact such as a fine mess
net
satisfy the restrictions? Perhaps it could even be decorated in some
creative way.

I've been going to Loveworks for awhile and its actully pretty good, good 
crowd very mixed and mature.  The only down side is that it's over at 3-330 
even thought it'll be packed This sat it's at 339 jessie (big heart city) 
Music is House on the deep side, Dani often spins there along with Pete 
Avilla.  I think it's free b4 10.

Hola!  My name is ELENA,  <<WARMTH>> was my first true Rave experience.
The experience i had  at <<WARMTH>> has forever changed me.  I feel
cleansed and purified, rid of all that is negative.  My outlook on life is
much brighter and i am filled with peace.
A million thank yous to all who i made contact with at the event, never
have i met so many beautiful, and loving people.  Especially those of you
associated w/ SF RAVES ;)"
Since the beggining of last year i've felt lost.  Moving to San Francisco
in Sept. '96 began the healing process.  Exactly one year ago i thought i
might have full-blown cancer, and i had never been so terrified in my life,
i've always been a strong person, but that experience killed my soul.  I
have waited my whole life to be in a room where people are happy,
affectionate, respectful, and accepting of me.  <<WARMTH>> brought me back
to myself.
Never have i felt such an intense vibe, such a connection with other
people.  Someone wearing a SF RAVE card said the words
Peace.Love.Unity.Respect, i hadn't heard that before, and was floored!
What a unique expression, they are the most amazing words, perfectly
linked.  Everyone's eyes were large and had a little twinkle flickering in
them.  All night i thrived off the energy everyone and the music was
emmitting.
A special Hello to Claudia, Lara, Alicia (de Salamanca), and Omar (de
Andalusia).  It's almost impossible for me to meet other people from SPAiN,
i will treasure our talk, and i hope to see you both again ;)"
To my boyfriend ARI:  Thank you (muchisimas gracias) for taking me to
<<WARMTH>> i'm truely grateful, and i'm happy you and i were able to share
that :)
A big hug to everyone who was @ WARMTH. Until we meet again.....
LOVE, ELENA :)

I don't mean to bitch about LA, merely to provide some background. I saw
some of the problems that the scene had there, but I also had some great
times - that's where I was first exposed to all this. Let's not turn this
into an SF vs. LA thread, that's not my point. It's a different scene - I'm
not saying it's worse.

GREETINGS!
I think this is far more productive than cola wars.
My top choices are:
1)Samuel Smith Oat Meal Stout (best off tap while in England)  of course
2)Harpoon IPA (New England beer)
3)Anchor Steam (this was like gold when I lived in Boston)
4)Guinness (actually my number 3)
5)Bass
These change depending upon conditions.  Any more info. on Cloud Factory
yet?

Love,
Breton Veach

So who all is going to Spring Heel Jack at Bimbo's tonight?  Come by and
say hi if you see me there (for all those that haven't met me yet, I have
chin-length brown hair, a beard, and I think I'll be wearing my Love and

My new job is sending me to Bangalore India for two weeks at the
beginning of April. I was wondering if anybody has any sites to check
out for interesting music and dance scenes near to Bangalore. Is "goa"
still happening? Know of any internet lists or web sites to check out?

(Yeah, I've done all the tourist thing on previous trips (Calcutta, 
New Delhi, Fatepur Sikri, Agra, etc)... this time I'm mostly going to
be in Bangalore in back-to-back design meetings, with very little time
for extra travel... I'll probably try spending an extra weekend in
Madras and Goa if I can swing the schedule that way, and I'm looking
for pointers on fun things to do ...)

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks...

a little late in the posting, but just wanna say that Warmth was
fantastic!  that's the best i've ever seen that space (654 mission)
look... it's very apparent that a lot of care and time went into setting
up for the event. extra-coolio was the tent + air mattress in the corner
of the upstairs room. (which makes me think that i should start bringing
my tent with me to parties...y'know, sorta like a portable, privy chill
room)  Dan/Micron's set was great! it was so good, i climbed back behind
the amps and cranked them up so that we could hear it in all it's glory.
:)  all in all, i had a wonderful time, even though a girl i had just
met barfed all over me. <hi stephanie!> :)

groove on, kiddoes

 Perhaps a better (but not as cheap) solution would be to purchase some 
electrical contact cleaner. This stuff is amazing. You can get it at 
better quality electronic shops.

Since a cold, carrying both a gruesome cough and a threat of broncitis,
prevented me from making it down to the east bay and New Hope tonight,
I thought I'd send you all a big *HUG*. I hope you guys are having as
much fun as I am (gotta love "Sabrina the Teenage Witch"...).=20

And oh, just in case ANYONE decided to check out Springheel Jack, how
was it? (YES Lara, I was actually thinking about that one too...*grin*)

Hope to see you all next weekend! =3D)

Dear Dan,

Things were going well at first.

Later in the moring I was feeling cocky, beatmatching the few records that
I know how to beatmatch, sweaty groovy beats in your chest, and then my
cocky, nervous, fidgeting fingers flicked of the sound switch on one of my
turntables, and it sounded awful.  

While the record was still spinning, I left the party and crossed the boulevarde
 to the Cafe Montarde.  Picasso was there, waiting for Ms. Stein, and he waved
me over to his table.  I was hungry but not in the usual way,  and I sat
down with 
Picasso and ordered a vermouth and it was quiet in the cafe and we waited
for Ms.
Stein, there in the quiet.

Pablo ordered us a second drink and we shared a bagette to make it
smoother.  He showed me some paintings he had been working on.  I agreed
that we were nice and finished my vermouth.

Then  I remembered that my record was still playing at the party across the
street, 
and I left the bill for poor Picasso, and ran back across the boulevarde,
through traffic 
and the rainwashed street, and my record was still playing, almost to the
end of the 
song but not quite,  and then I realized that although sometimes things are
awful and
I make awful mistakes, things are not always as bad as they seem.

Especially when you are living in San Francisco and it is raining at 4:30
in the morning, and most of your friends are asleep in their beds, and the
streets are wet and glittering from the streetlamps.  Sometimes knowing
that you have friends makes it seems as if everything is not so bad after
all.

yours,

boomerang

Ummm,  hate to disagree with you, but I don't think there is really such a
thing as a safe drug, a _very_ safe drug, at that.

Man, I really wanted to stay out of this one, but it's just too juicy
right now!

Okay, being in the SoCal scene right now is very interesting.  There is
this inner-circle underground thing growing and then there are the
make-da-money-now folks and then there are the old skoolers and then there
are the kids who don't know a thing about the scene, PLUR, the music or
_anything_ besides getting out of their Dad's house for a night and taking
all sorts of drugs.

In other words, there is a lack of cohesive unity.  And I guess everyone
thinks they've got it right.  Stranger and stranger.  

Plus -- people in LA don't hug enough.  They just don't.  I don't know
why.  I try to hug everyone at some point and I just wind up feeling
weird.  The SF scene is a lot different than LA, but you can't get too
harsh.  It's just different.

 It tastes like this drink I used to get when I was little called calpico,

I don't think everyone would necessarily agree with that. Look at the
fact the Bay Area's hi-tech industry is the best in the country (yes,
it is well known that there is a shortage of technical people in
LA). We have significantly less violent crime and theft, far less
pollution (I became physically ill from the air on my last trip
through LA), we produce Odwalla, we create a mere fraction of the
commercialism and schlock that LA does, and so on...

I guess people like LA because you can make a lot of money...
Okay.

Hello all-
(Yikes! it's Sat. morning *already*?  Anyways...)

IMHO, it really does depend on how you define "safe."  From what I
understand, GHB is essentially a harmless derivative of the
neurotransmitter GABA.  (GABA is an essential chemical we all have and
need to regulate metabolism and a whole bunch of other bodily functions.)
GHB really has no major side-effects (except passing out, and that's only
if you take too large a dose), stimulates fat metabolism and muscle growth
(over long term use, and with exercise, of course), and breaks down into
just carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.  As a matter of fact,
apparently it was legal OTC in the 80's as a body-building supplement!
(But of course, that was until the FDA found out that it could be an 
*enjoyable* experience...  And they can't have something like _that_ being
sold legally, now can they?)  

Now as far as the _non-physiological_ issues of safety are concerned (such
as operating heavy machinery while under the influence), I agree, GHB
could be an *extremely* disasterous drug (especially since just a slight
overdose will simply knock you out cold for a while... = bad news if
you're cruising down the freeway at 60mph).  But this all depends on what
the user intends to do while on the stuff.  At a rave, well, as long as
you take a very reasonable dosage and don't drive home for a *long* while,
you should be fine.  Behind the wheel, you're risking the lives of who
knows how many innocent people.  In a sense, I guess it's like alcohol as
far as drinking and driving:  don't do it. 

BTW, if you want to read more on it, the Lycaeum article on GHB is
pretty good; I highly recommend taking a look (I can't remember the
address, but somebody posted it just a little while ago.  I know it
starts with http://www.lycaeum.org, and you could probably find it from
there.)  Happy exploring!
Peace and hugs 2U all-

ok, so im in a bart train headed from lake merritt to Daly City.  

the train enters the transbay tube.

suddenly, i get the urge to walk from the front of the train back towards 
lake merritt.  

how long do you think it would take me to get to lake merritt if the 
train is going 90 mph in the opposite direction, and i am walking toward 
oakland at say a rate of 1 mph?

Well well well. An interesting show. I had planned on going to New Hope, but 
like so many others on the list, I'm just getting over a cold, and being that 
my main form of transpo is a ten year old motorcycle, the chilly ride to SCruz 
put it a little out of reach. So, me and a buddy went to Spring Heel Jack which 
is conveniently near home. 

First off, I have to say Bimbo's as a venue rocks.   If you haven't been, don't 
be put off by the name. Cool decor, tables, and a big dance area.  The crowd 
was neato as well, a good mix of artsy schticksters, dyed-in-the-wool 
junglists, and funky hipsters. 
Alas, the show itself was rather dissapointing. The sound system sucked, with 
alot of distortion, especially at the lower frequencies- which I consider a 
veritable sin if you're trying to play d & b.  And the music...well, it just 
didn't cause me to have the spastic twitches and near-seizure movements that 
good jungle inspires.  In my opinion, the meer presence of 
puh-teet-puh-puh-puh-teet alone isn't enough to get it going; it's got to come 
up and kick you in the ass. 

How was New Hope? Looking forward to the reviews.  What about tonght? What 
looks good?  Also, what is your opinion of King Kong?  Is anyone familiar with 
the DJs? 

xxxooo

Wouldn't the length of the train be a variable?

Greets All,
     I'll just get right to the point.  New Hope WENT OFF!  It wasn't crazy in
the normal, indoor party crazy kinda way, but TONS of people showed up, all
sporting good vibes.  (why am I not surprised?)  I saw many many friends, some
who I was expecting, some who completely surprised me.  Sound system was
perfect for an outdoor event, loud when close to the speakers, but low enough
at a distance to carry on a conversation.
     Something really funny happened on the way to the party.  Along highway 1,
we saw all these cars parked, so I told my friend Kei "STOP this has to be it!"
 So we parked and searched around for the party.  Soon we found a trail leading
to the beach, and sure enough, there were lots of people partying by a big
campfire.  I smelled A LOT of alcohol and thought 'uh oh'.  Apparently a bunch
of other people had been by looking for new hope asking "Where's the rave?"  So
all these drunk people were teasing us by offering us ecstasy.  This one girl
actually thought they were serious.  I hope she didn't get sold aspirin.
     Anyway, a quick recap: thick vibe, some sick acid tracks from micron, tons
of familiar and not so familiar faces, intensely warm fire, gorgeous location. 
What more can I say? I hope that these will be happening often this summer. 
Don't miss the next one!
                                         Steve.

Yeah, it seems to be the opinion of some that I should skip Goa, as
I've had enough party experiences w/ travelling EuroTrash to fill this
life time, and my next lifetime, reincarnated as a sheep-farmer's
favorite lil' lamb "Fluffy" (Bahahaaaaah!).  That, and I accidentally
stumbled into that song "Ain't Going to Goa" playing on my car radio
tuned to a "modern rock" station in SF. :-) :-) The confluence of these
events, plus my general boredom with "goa trance" music played at
raves, made me realize I'd just be wasting my time when I could be
checking out other things...

Of course I'll attempt to see some Indian classical music performances
if I can (it'll probably be the company-approved form of after-work
entertainment). Don't worry, I'm not as much of a gringo as you might
think -- I've been a long-time listener to Ravi Shankar, Ali Akhbar
Khan, Vishna Mohan Bhatt, Ashla Bhosle... as well as East/West
collaborations like Ravi && Yehudi Menuhin, John Handy && Dr. L
Subramanian && Ali Akhbar Khan, Monsoon, Sheila Chandra, and Najma
(check out Najma's recent "Forbidden Kiss"
co-produced/arranged/directed by my brother-in-law in NYC)... To say
nothing about participating at my best friend's multi-day Bengalese
wedding in Calcutta, much eating of Indian food (spicy==good), etc.

However, I've found that classical Indian music gigs I've seen (five
Ravi Shankar concerts, two Ali Akhbar Khan, numerous Zakir Hussain
concerts) all tend to be rather staid -- audience interaction being
respectful listening, counting tal (counting out the complex beats with
your hands), and hearty applause afterwards... Granted, things can get
pretty heady at these concerts when the musicianship transcends the
earthly plane, but it's not like people get up out of their chairs and
bust a move right in the middle of a sitar solo...

I wrote my initial note in the hopes that I'd get some pointers on 
what Indian youth culture is into. Are they into Bhangra,
indo-influenced Hip-Hop?? How does "rave" and modern dance culture
translate into Indian culture? Enquiring travellers want to know.

PS: as far as the uncecessary comments about  "stuff hotter than catsup
mr.cheeseburger and fries"... uhh, you can KEEP your WEAK SRI LANKAN
hot-sauces. I regularly grind up HABANERO PEPPERS, SNORT 'EM,  AND DUMP
THE SEEDS INTO MY CONTACT LENSES BEFORE PUTTING 'EM ON IN THE MORNING.
YEEEHAW.... THEN I BLAST HOUSE MUSIC SO LOUD, WITH WAILING DIVAS
SCREECHING SO SOULFULLY, THAT ALL THE NEIGHBORHOOD STRAY KITTIES COME
BY THE FRONT PORCH TO MOUNT MY LEG! So there!

From: Jonathan Dejano@SEPL on 03/08/97 12:12 PM

well...good  morning kiddies...here's the lowdown on the phatty boombatty
party known as (a) new hope...


...couldn't make it to springheel jack last night, so me and my fellow jedi
knight (tony G) jump into our x-wing fighter (1986 toyota corolla class)
and head on down to the rendezvous point approximately 12.8 miles south
(from highway 84) on highway 1...

...with the force on our back and the adrenaline in our hearts, we arrive
at the secret rebel base around 10:30 and met up with general anakin and
his small rebel alliance crew, including deepfog and realit-E...we help set
up (sorta) the equipment...while this was going on, anakin asked if there
was a pyromaniac in our (as of yet) small enclave of rebels to help start
the bonfire...question:  how many ravers does it take to start a
bonfire?...answer:  one to light the kindling, and about seven or so to
start breaking down pallets (that we procured from a nearby location;)...)
and start saying "man...get that lighter fluid outta here...and go get me
the gallon o' gasoline and i'll show you how to make a fire..."

...anyway, as the fire was being lit to help keep our bodies warm, deepfog
started spinning some smooth trance to warm the embers in our
soul...deepfog's set got the night started as more of our fellow rebellion
brethren arrive in relatively modest numbers...

...surprise, surprise...immediately after deepfog's set, dj dan made a
surprise appearance (around 12:30 am) and got down on the decks...by this
time, the party was full on, with more people arriving in great
numbers...the humble collection of about 12 or so rebels about 2 hours
before was now growing into a multitude of hundreds by the
minute...however, the presence of our rebel base was felt by the dark side
and some storm troopers (CHP or park rangers i would imagine) were rumored
to be in the vicinity...so right in the middle of dj dan's set, all power
was cut off until the imperial forces left...with much force manipulation
and jedi mind tricks, the storm troopers soon left the vicinity and main
power was again restored...

...next up was general anakin himself and his second in command (on this
interactive set) realit-E...anakin started off with some pulsating hard
trance while realit-E layered some phatty analog synth accents courtesy of
some old skool korg keyboards...these are not your typical slim jim
keyboards mind you...these korgs are industrial strength looking like a
cross between a cash register and richard 23's calculator (for the front
242 fans out there)...anakin and realit-E's set blew the whole place up
when anakin dropped in the track "humanoid"...in the middle of this set,
anakin decided to throw a white label dub plate called "cool cuts 001" into
the throbbing throng and lo and behold, the vinyl landed near tony G's spot
(an erstwhile dj) who soon picked it up for his growing vinyl
collection...by then the force was indeed strong on this stretch of beach
on the leftcoast...

...next on deck was dj radon who (to my relief) threw down some wicked
earth shaking drum n bass...others soon followed into spastic convultions
as the phat bass frequencies were assaulting both our ears and our
bodies...

...unfortunately, master yoda called upon me and tony G to finish our jedi
training for the night (we had to go to work the following day @ 10 am
sharp)...so with our spirits satisfied (me w/drum n bass, and tony G
w/trance), we hopped back onto our x-wing and proceeded to head back to
dagobah (somewhere near san mateo/foster city/belmont area)...during our
trip home, tony G noticed the comet (sorry, but the name escapes me) that's
currently passing in our heavens and we discussed the
significance/insignificance of our existence in this universe..."we are
just specs of dust in this cosmic void, grains of sand in a large beach
somewhere, or drops of water in a large ocean much like that comet is in
this vast expanse of space" he says...i disagree...if we are just drops of
water in a large ocean, then look at those billions of drops working
together in a common goal to create a beautiful stretch of beach that we
were just on, giving us the chance to party our asses off into the
night...think what a multitude of voices can do in this "insignificant"
world of ours and in our rave culture for that matter...(a) new hope
indeed...

...well gotta go back to work (doing what you may ask, but testing
videogames...hah!)...

...so, thanx to anakin (tony G says thank you for the dub plate) and the
whole rebel alliance crew for the phatty boombatty vibe last night and may
the rebellion grow strong in the future...

...may the force be with you...always...

humbl-E,
jedi savant d0u8l3 J;)

I haven't been to Club 181 in three years, since I left=CAthe world of club=
s=20
for raveland.  Maybe it was meant to be, because I had tentative plans to=
=20
go there tonight, and last night I found myself ferried there in the compan=
y=20
of a different set of people.  But all they had to tell were the magic=20
words "guest list", and I was up for it!

I remember dancing to disco three years ago, with a main dance room and a
small pool room, both basically empty on a couple of Friday nights.=20
Things have changed a bit at 181.  A larger back room has been opened, and
there was a good-sized crowd.  The crowd was interesting, so much more
diverse than the unfortunate homogeneity I've found at raves.  But (I
guess just like in larger society), there was a lot of self-segregation,
everyone sticking more-or-less to their own "group," and a lot of people
milling about checking everyone else out.  The night stayed like that,
restless and tentative; a club unsure of what it was trying to create, and
a crowd that never came together.  The sense of imbalance came also from
the totally different scenes in the three rooms - - a random band in the
front, pretty good band doing funk and 80's covers in the back, and
"classic rock" (!) in the pool room.=20

My group caught a bit of vibe dancing our butts off to the funk band.  Old
Parliament and Michael J covered with guitar and congas.  But the height
of the night came when freestyle rappers jumped into the mix.  They threw
in all kinds of rhymes, sampling old-school like PE and BDP.  They were
dizzying and the crowd danced and screamed.  Fun was had for a little
while.  After the live music ended at 2, a dj came on spinning very
incongruous (for this crowd) jungle and abstract techno.  The room emptied
(of course!).  I danced awhile, my group the only people on the
dancefloor!=20

The bummer of the night, no surprise, was the numerous times I was grabbed
as I wandered through the club or attempted to dance alone. I am a
"wanderer," I like to cruise around checking out the scene, usually on my
own.  In this environment that meant "AVAILABLE," and several times my
progress was stopped by strong hands grabbing my arms and pulling me
toward some drunk man or men stepping into my path, placing their
hands on me.  My body is my own.  The hands of anonymous men I've never
seen before are not allowed on it.  But of course, this simple right is
disregarded with impunity.=20

Actually, I think that's a major reason there is such a lack of women at
clubs and bars.  I notice when I go out that the ratio is often like
70-30.  Where are the women?  Maybe the environment is not quite as
hospitable for us, and we stay away.  And I see hordes of single guys
crowding the dancefloor and the bar - the vast majority of them, I'm sure,
sweet and decent people who just maybe want to meet someone -- and I think
it's sad that because of a few jerks, a lot of women aren't around.=20

Very surprised to run into a bonafide raver there!  What's up to Chris of
Solle Clothing...who was nice enough to offer some alternative parties for
me tonight if I wanted crazy trance, rather than hyping his own party
("Sugar Shack" - deep house), which I thought was a pretty refershing
quality in a promoter!  Good luck to Chris on his party tonite!!

love,
Nancy

Thanks an' Big Up's to everyone who went to New Hope. It was the best
21st Birthday party anyone could ever ask for!!! :-)

Let's just say I got so many "Presents" from people I could open a
pharmacy. ;)

Eric, thanks so much for bringing the glowsticks! Thoes ruled!!!!

Well as for tonight for me. I was hoping to hook up with this girl I met
at Euphonic G. named Keri who, incidentaly, is the ABSOLUTE LOVE OF MY
LIFE. But she dosen't want to return my pages it seems so I guess I'm
all set for either a night of wallowing self-pitty or perhaps a trip to
3000 if I decide that life is still worth living without my newfound
soulmate. Se la vi I guess.

Thanks for a great party-

Hilights:

A crowd of people trying to get a tick of this guy's back...it was so
funny!

Back to back drum'n bass sets by Radon and Mudfoot. Nice one!

Location, location, location! It was a sweet spot.

Lowlights:

trying like mad to keep warm and seeing Big-O walking around with only a 
t-shirt on...man was I jealous! (I guess that's not a low...)

-peace-

 Actually I believe it is a "percursor" of GABA. Like DMT, GHB is found 
in mammalian CNS's. It is in especially high concentrations in 
hibernating animals and unborn fetus's (sp?)(according to information I have 
read).

 Also, (from I've read) it is a regulator of cellular respriation. In 
other words it slows down the intake of oxygen and nutrients for the cell 
while enabling the cell to survive these conditions (hence hibernating 
animals and unborn fetus's having high amounts).

An important message from the UBIQUITOUS family.

	As seen through all of the negative media, we have been labeled as a
drug infested communitya complete misinterpretation.  But as of right
now, the media, law enforcement officials, AND even parents have no
reason to think otherwise.  Our scene is much too beautiful to be
vandalized by such a destructive tag.  Because of this, cities are
imposing dance curfews and breaking up positive parties.  Places are
very few, where we as a people are welcome, and they continue to crack
down.  These are very delicate times.  And so it remains strongly, in
our opinion, that in order for our very special scene to grow and
prosper, we must begin to change our attitudes and ways.  Let them open
their eyes to see that the scene has so much more to offer than just a
$20 hit of "e."  
	In our community, there is diversity- at a "rave" all people of any
race or creed can gather together in perfect harmony; there is music- at
a "rave" there is beautiful house music, a universal language for dance;
there is freedom of expression- at a "rave" we are truly accepted as
individuals, ready to be ourselves; and there is LOVE- at a "rave" we
are family, all strong, united, and safe among friends.  No matter how
much positivity and self-fulfillment is generated by our scene, all
theyre led to believe is that "everyone does DRUGS."  We know thats
not what our scene is about at all.  So let the music be our high.  Let
them see that the feeling of dance far surpasses any artificial
euphoria, that we dont need drugs to have a good time.
	Weve been an active part of this scene for over 6 years now, and we
personally owe our survival to being sober.  At one time or another, we
may have all experienced altered states of existence.  This cant be
denied.  These experiences may have been the most euphoric times of our
lives.  But when introducing any artificial substance into our bodies,
we can never totally predict the resulting consequences.  We advise
people to take caution.  Love one another.  Be smart.  We are all one
family.  Location to location and party to party, we all have a
responsibility to watch over each other.  Spread the word and keep the
faith.
	We invite everyone to a wonderful UBIQUITOUS night on Saturday March
15th, 1997. Here, we are putting together a production with so much
energy and visual stimulation that artificial substances will not be
necessary to have an incredible time.  Extreme Beam will be introducing
an awesome multi-colored laser and intellibeam light show.  A fierce DJ
line-up, for two sound systems,  has been put together to create the
most beautiful music (Jeno, Phil Smart, Jon Williams, Carlos, Ghost,
Pete Avila, Simon, RkTech, Essence, Kimo, Kwashi, and Thomas Jenkins). 
Live congas should complement the music nicely.  Anyone who parties
till dawn will be treated to a fantastic morning fire performance. 
Organic fruit will be free for all.  Also, we are working on a special
after-party with STRAWBERRY SUNDAES- more info on this later.  We must
give special thanks to a very talented artist, to be named later, for
painting the divine UBIQUITOUS masterpiece.  Directions and other
important information will be provided on our web site:

  I believe the body of the security guard (ortega), who tried to rescue 
the man who jumped overboard on valentines day, was recovered today.
  Does anyone know if the funeral already took place?

My boyfriend is into break dancing.  He says the circle is there to
protect the other dancers around him.  He said, "If I'm breakin' and
there's no circle around me, I'm gonna kick someone in the head."

Besides, even if people are "competing", it's all for fun.  I've heard of
parties where people dance just to show off.  I have friends who have
been approached by people who wanted to "see their moves".  Still I think
if a party has the right vibe, there can be all kinds of dancing without
people actually being competitive.

Love and kisses,

                     Libby Rose

hello hello...
wow wow wow wow wow
what a wonderful fun filled wonderland of frolicking fancy free willobys.
sorry, I was trying to be creative.  so yeah, I had a lot of fun.
It was a nice party with good vibes.
my evening went like this... I pull up and see Eric and Rona and Hiroshi and
Annie May (we missed you smile Annie) and Mark and Melanie and Hope and Andy
and Victoria and Paul and my love Lara outside. Love you guys.  Pretty much
in that order too :).  Then I went inside and met some people who (sorry,
short term memory is gone) I don't really member all to clearly.  Then I saw
all you sit inside... Aaron, Fernie, Perry, Danny, Rick, Sam, (sorry if I
left someone out, but you know I love <3 you right?) And I hugged lots of
people.
Music was fun to dance too, I havent danced that hard in a long time.  Mark
Skinner was on the tables by about 11 or so, then the guy with the cool
 shirt (I'm sorry, I forgot yer name) and then Jeff.  
Everyboby was asleep though and I was whistling to wake them up.  I guess I
didn't think it was too loud, but the neibors did and they called the police.
 I'm sorry :(... My whistle is new and it needed to be broken in. But it was
the wrong time and place.  I feel bad :*(.
But yanno, It's okay because all you were there and I love you all.  And I
got to see you guys and I havent in a long time.
And the vibe was very happy :) everyone was all smiles :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO KIP.... where ever he may be.
and to kate in a bubble, matt (kermit), shawn or sean who I took to 7-11,
james, john, clint, camela, andy, eric, wow, theere are so many more. I can't
remember right now... it was a fun fabulous little ditty put together by all.
Very good vibe.
I'll save my whistle for another party, this one a bigger one instead, cloud
factory maybe????
smiles:)
{{hugs}}
love<3
april (4)
have you hugged your fourth month of the year today???
your very distraught whistle blower :(

Hey guys,
I was looking through the AP wire at work and I found this article. It
concerns the security guard who was missing after jumping off the cruise
ship on Valentine's Day.
Take care,
Claudia

(San Francisco)-- A body found yesterday at Pier 42 is that of a
security guard who disappeared last month during a Valentine's dinner
cruise. That's according to coroner's
officials in San Francisco. The badly decomposed body of 28-year-old
Ricardo Ortega Junior was found at about 10 a-m, several miles from the
Oakland Estuary, where the
security guard was last seen on February 15th. Witnesses say Ortega had
jumped off
the Jack London Commodore to rescue a Georgia tourist during a private
party on the cruise ship. The body of 20-year-old Tavaris Willis of
Marietta, Georgia, is still
missing, officials said. Raised in San Francisco, Ortega graduated in
1986 from El Camino High School. He served several years in the US Army
after high school and was
trained as a sharpshooter, according to his wife, Willa Ortega. Ortega
had recently started his own business, Panther Private Security
Services, while waiting to land a job
as a firefighter so he could work with his wife, a San Francisco
firefighter.

I sent a letter to the list last week along the same lines and have got about 
6-7 responses from people interested in caravanning down there.  I'm pretty 
fired up about this party.  I'm going to send an email to those interested, 
asking about available space in the car, when can people leave, who has tents 
and camping stuff, etc.  Peace

Hello everyone!!

I am interested in finding people who want to go to Dune III on the 5th of 
April.  Is there anyone who wants to form a caravan type thing?  I do not have 
a car, but would be willing to organize it and pay for gas 'n stuph.  Anyone 
who wants to try to get something going(assuming of course there isn't anything 
already in the works, in which case....  GET IN TOUCH WITH ME PLEASE!!  :)    
)  send me an e-note!

eeeK!!!.....would this be 'every' single party going on? or

I wouldn't like to see the SFraves calendar printed on newspapers
so that *EVERYONE* cann see it.... at least, on the Net, only
those with Computers  get to see it ;o)

in review (short and sweet):

didn't get to the party until real late (hey uncle owen, this artoo unit
has a bad motivator!).  when we rolled in around three, i was surprised to
see a _ton_ of people there, grooving down.  started dancing right away to
shake off the chill night air, and within a couple minutes we were nice
and toasty!

really enjoyed radon's set - all sorts of junglish beats with a strong
hiphop flavor - tasty!  too bad his monitor was broken, which made
beatmatching pretty tough.  really nice tunes, though.  next dj (mudfoot?)
played some good sounds too, but i found it not too danceable.  seized the
chance to nestle down for a disco nap while i listened. 

definite highlight was waking up to some spoken-word vibrations and hey!
andy's on the tables!  the sun was up, people were stretching out and
grooving down, and andy was pulling out some mix trix too wake up our
minds too.  big cheers for that crazee-ass guy with the cane, who was
still working his pimp-daddy trip nonstop.  what was with that?

finally, decided that it was time to head back for a hot shower and
breakfast, and end-of-term assignments (yuk).  i was thinking, it's too
bad not that many people are left to dance to andy's stuff - it's really
prime.  and then i walked out the crest of the hill, and everywhere you
looked here and there were groups of four or six or ten people,
prospecting and talking and dancing in the morning sun to the beats coming
over the hill.  yeah!

yippee for adam - one of the most fun parties i've been too in a long
while.  next time leave a contribution jar out where we can find it!  (to
put something in, of course.)
matt.

I was excited all day Friday about this party - getting ready for it before
work (work is on the way) was way fun - make sure to take warm clothes,
sleeping bags, a tent, water, glow sticks etc.

We arrived to the beach around 12:30am, and I was pleasantly surprised
noticing that there were way more people than I expected.  I thought it was
going to 30-50 people crowd, but there were probably over 200 people there.


Micron was spinning when we came (I noticed that somebody said how DJ Dan
was there, but I guess they are mixing Micron whose real name is Dan, with
DJ Dan - oh, well - it happened before :P).  We put our stuff away, walked
around to see familiar faces (it was way to dark to actually notice some
people), and just get familiar with the space.  After turning a small space
into the dance floor with the carboard boxed we brought I started dancing.
Micron's set was fun, and before I knew it, it was time for Anakin vs.
RealitE.  They started of mellower, to get into some pretty hard trance
(which I absolutely love).  I ended up dancing through their entire set,
and by the time Radon came on, I was tired enough that sitting down looked
like a very good option.

I joined my friends in the grass, had a beer or two :), and hang out for a
while.  It started getting colder, so almost all warm clothes I brought
ended up on me at this time.  For some reason it seemed that jungle sets
lasted a long time...  Hmmm..  I used to like jungle a lot, but I think I
am realizing that too much jungle can get to you.  I like it when there are
2 sound systems, and one has jungle, and the other one trance or techno, or
if there is one system have jungle set, followed by something else.  I felt
pretty jungled out, cold, and I couldn't wait for the sun to come up.

It was fun watching Adam running around and looking for AndyW when his set
was about to start :).  Andy was somewhere taking a nap, but was rudely
awaken to spin for us.  By this time it was getting lighter, and possible
to actually see people who were there, and it was just great realizing that
I knew more people there than I thought.  Andy's set was fun :) - it was
great to hear some unusual house that turned into trace.  This was my
favorite part of the party - it was getting sunny, there were still people
dancing, walking on the beach, and everybody seemed really happy.  People
were hanging out, some drinking beer, some eating oranges and everything
seemed so beautiful (and I wasn't on E, although I am sure for some people
that's how it sounds).  I kept thinking "There should be more days (and
nights) like this".

Anakin switched with Andy, and his set was really nice.  I danced and
enjoyed every minute of it, till the music stopped and realizing that it
was time to go home.  We gathered out stuff, got help with clearing the
boxes we brought (thanks Todd and _____), and headed our way (SF).

Thanks to Rebel Alliance Sound for having this beautiful party, thanks to
all the DJs, and all the happy people who made it so much fun.  Can't wait
for the next one!

=) *B*

P.S.  Quote of the night I overheard at one point "Can you believe this
party is free!"

P.S.  sorry this got so long - I have to do some work, and writing about
beautiful things just seem way more fun :)

four of us went to "sugar shack" on saturday night,
mostly because the sfraves calendar said taj would be spinning.
after going to this joke of an event, i am seriously wondering
why this thing ever made the sfraves calendar. we spent 10 bucks
to go to what should have been advertised as a frat party for 
cheesy idiots. here are some of the things i witnessed:
1.  a drunken idiot squeezing the breasts of some girl who
was gladly letting it happen.
2. the cliche girls dancing together thinking they are being "crazy"
by acting like they are lesbians.
3. two guys sandwhiching two girls and giving each other high-fives.
4. at least five guys give my girlfriend the once over, and then ask her
to dance.
5. over 1 hour of crap music which should be played at the covered wagon.
6. one fight
7. at least five deep french kisses on the middle of the dance floor.

the night was a joke. i couldnt believe people were acting the way they were.
if someone has taj's email could you please send it to me. i want to know
why the hell his name was assocaited with this "party." ultimately,
we left at 2:00, following out the drunks who didn't know what to do when the
house music came back on. (you should have seen the dance floor thin out
when all the disco stuff ended.)

btw, dont get me wrong. im not uptight or adverse to disco music. i have
had fun at the covered wagn and the like. it's just that when i want to
go to something listed on the sfraves claendar, i expect to avoid the
things found on the above list.

Wow! Am I glad I missed that one. I almost went too. I do wonder if the
SFRaves calendar is ever screened for that kind of bunk, but I guess not
really. There are some weeklies on there that could easily be crossed out.

"blatant self promotion"  It's used when the person sending the email is
in some way involved with the event they talk about in their message.

For some reason I have been infactuated with the idea of raving someplace
NEW. Some other scene. A new flavor. I have NEVER, despite partying for
almost 2 years here in SF, been to a party elsewhere. When I heard about
Dune III, I got exited and checked around, and found the SoCal raves
calendar. LA has some pretty good parties going on (it seems), and I noticed
that there will be a PHAT party in the desert called "Full Circle" by
"RaveOlympia". It is "to celebrate the coming, and passing of HALE-BOPP the
comet, which will be completely visable and will be passing the earth at its
closest point to the earth." It will be out in the desert, same as Dune III,
however, it seems to be on a much bigger scale. 2 dance areas, and a bunch
of DJ's. I dunno, I think I'm going to go. If anyone else is interested, let
me know. I can probably get my dads explorer for the weekend. PLUR.

 Paul, with all due respect (which ain't much) go fuck yourself.

 I have asthma. I don't like breathing toxic fumes especially when 
dancing hard. It has been proven that second hand smoke kills people 
(mostly by causing heart problems).

 The tobacco companys are one of the largest death corporations (second 
only to the military complex) around.

 If you can't understand my objections to an advertisment for cigarette 
smoking I feel very sorry for you.

It seems plenty has been said about this party, but I wanted to add
my seal of approval.  F***ing great music!  Especially between about
2 and 4am.  Who was on between those hours?  There was one point where
the trance was swirling higher and higher until I thought everyone
would explode.  Makes me kinda lightheaded just thinking about it!

Hello all!

Attended a very nice smallish party saturday night, maybe only a 100 people?
Had an upstairs chill area and a downstairs dance area.  Heard lots of
jungle (unheard of a year ago!), and lots of goa. :)  And I got to hear Rick
Riffle & Eric do their Re: thing!  Groovy live ambient music, which was
especially nice to run into, because I just emailed Rick earlier that
afternoon asking when the next time they were going to be playing was. And
coincidentally, I find them playing at the party that very night!  That was
extra cool.  

And it was so nice to find this party at the last minute!  I didn't even
find out about it until 4 pm Saturday afternoon!  Happened to find it while
digging thru 3 megs of email in my inbox, on accident.  Good thing I found
it!  Showed to the party around 11 or so, found tons of old friends I
haven't seen in a long time, and tons more friends I have seen in a long
time! :)  And I got to meet the Esteemed List Master himself, Mr. Brian
Behlendorf.  Very cool guy! :)  Got to see Vince too (yay! :), Amy &
Melanie, knucklehead, dj tom, jonas (I'd just wondered that day what had
become of you!), Andy W :), Black Adder (you disappeared without saying
goodbye!), Burger King Jon & friends, and lots of other folk I've been
raving with thru-out 96.  Very cool!  (and thank you Rick for the
*wonderful* hugs, I hope to run into you again sometime. :)

Well I'm done, and I'm off to go hang out on the deck and watch the sunset
over the City, and listen to the trees and smell the sky.

Thanks W+M for a lovely time! :)

Love to you all
Shawna

It's really hard to quit.  I smoked a pack a day for about 4 years. 
Whenever I went for more than 3 hours without a cigarette, I 'd get cold
sweats, headaches, and I'd become really disoriented.  I had to use the
Nicorette Gum to quit.  Then I stopped smoking for 6 months.  When I was
no longer addicted, I said, "I'm not addicted anymore, so I can have a
cigarette every now and then."  I was so wrong!  I started getting the
psychological addiction again.  Luckily, I stopped myself before I became
physically addicted again!  Now it's been 3 weeks and 4 days since I've
had even a puff of a cigarette!

If anyone out there really wants to quit smoking, and they need some
help, please e-mail me.  I know how difficult quitting is, and I'd love
to help anyone through the struggle!

Love and kisses, 

                       Libby Rose

understand that CR is just an abreviation for CRank and any party that=20
runs on "CRank power" is definatly not one I personally would attend. =20
Maybe you could explain it to me otherwise but I have plenty of=20
ex-friends/crank addicts who live and 2 who have died by this sad drug=20
called CRank. =20
    Parting sober is a great thing - I do it- but don't push that on us wit=
h=20
this hypocritical statement as a reason to come to your party.  People=20
will come if they like the dj's, the people who attend (vibe), and the=20

Go to Goa and tell us all about it. I think it's still happenning, not as 
much as a few years ago, but I still hear they pull the three day parties 
on the beach. Two of my friends were there last year. I was going to go this 
Christmas but it fell through but here are the instructions I got. 

Get yourself to Goa, and that should be 4 hours (North?) I think out of 
Bombay. You will automatically be dissapointed by the lack of ravers and 
the huge ammounts of tourists your parents age. It's all very beautiful 
and resorty. What you then have to do is find all the English people that 
live there, and where they go to bars, (There is this area that's where 
you get the info.) and ask around. Or ask where the market  all the 
tourists sell their possessions and ask around. Lots of the people there 
are selling things so they can stay in Goa for longer. Then they will 
tell you to walk on the beach "that way" type thing, and you'll go 
forever in a deserted beach on a certain night, and you'll walk and walk 
and you become convinved that they were fucking with you, because you 
can't see anything nor hear anything... then suddenly there are boards on 
the floor, drugs that you can afford and a lot of people there dancing 
etc. If you're lucky theses things can go on for three days......
 Good luck.... I have to say, April won't be as happenning as the summer 
or new years.... but still... there are ravers there all year round, who 
live there.

I think that 'CRpower' stands for the names of the people putting the party on : Chance & 
Randy.  I am not sure, but I would guess that would be it.  Besides, it doesn't make any sence, 
if they are promoting positve sober raving, why would they have a derogitory name symbolizing 
drugs.  That just doesn't make sence.  I think it is just a coincidence.

If you have a choice or need to choose go to Dune. KC is one promoter worth 
sup[orting. Watch the BIG desert parties, sometimes they promise far more 
than they can really offer.

Actually, it's possible that it was meant to sound like "See Our Power".
Just a possiblility.

Ok, this is last night's party in a nutshell...

+			-
dj's			people disrespecting the space
			vibe/crowd
			too many people!!!

And for those of you who're still with me, here's the rest of the
review...

I arrived at the party around 12:15. My friends and I were all excited
about the location, 654 Mission (where both Koinonea(?) and Warmth were
thrown.  We walked into a PITCH BLACK room. The walls and the floor were
"decorated" with black plastic bags. And the only light source was a
big screen showing different movies (my friends told me that there were
occasional snippets of a woman performing oral sex on a man...). 
When we got to the table where we were supposed to pay our $10, we were
informed that they were already over their capacity, and the only advice
they could give us was to wait for anyone to leave. (a few minutes
later,
the same "bouncer" got the question "what are we going to do about these
people?" [question was asked by someone who worked at the party], and
his
answer was "wait for them to get tired of waiting and leave") After
about
ten minutes, they decided to let the people who were waiting in (there
were about ten of us by then). When we got past the table and were able
to take a look at the crowd, I got a very bad feeling. At the risk of
sounding prejudice (which I am, as are most of you out there...), I have
never seen that many shirts and jackets from Tommy Hilfiger in one
place,
and the whole thing reminded me of the parties at HomeBase. But I
decided
not to care, and check out the dancing downstairs. On the way, I think I
had 3 or 4 guys offer me "X". And oh, if you wanted acid, you could get
3 for $5. 
I finally got downstairs, and it was just as dark as upstairs. And the
"main room" was packed to the brim. Lots of soul train dancers, which is
cool. As long as they don't tell you to get out of the way so they can
look cool! Which happened, oh ... about 3 times last night.
I reached the dj booth just in time to catch DJ Godfather from Detroit.
Now that's what I call mixing skills. He scratched, played two copies of
the same record with a beat's delay, played with everything. Not even a
broken crossfader could stop this. (the music kept playing as a new
mixer
was hooked up...)
But Godfather's skills weren't really enough to lift my spirits last
night.
What really bummed me out was the total disrespect for the space that
was
displayed. If you never get to go to another party at 654 Mission, last
night was probably the reason. I seriously don't think it's worth
putting
up signs about no smoking if you, as a promoter, are going to smoke in
the
rooms where smoking is allegedly prohibited.
What else? Oh yeah, the crowd. To me, this seemed a lot like the crowd
that
turned the Planet New Year's Make-up party into the gangbanger-night it
was.
I saw close to no love (lover-lover NOR friend-friend), which probably
derives
from the fact that some people were selling Advil for $20 a hit. The
only
people that weren't acting sober were the ones running around with vodka
and
tequila.

In closing, I have to say that although the party wasn't really what I
had 
expected, the promoters still did a fairly decent job. I mean, getting a
dj
with the talent of Godfather to come out to SF was rad. And the free
records
was a cool thing. Not that I got one, but hey... *smile* Too bad the
crowd
was looking for something else. The only times the vibe really rose in
the
main room was when the "MC" started yelling "Where the ho's at?" and
"East
Oakland in the house"...

If you didn't go, you didn't miss out. If you went, where were you? :)

But as always, this was just MY opinion. If you disagree, good for you.
=)

*hugs*

I just wanted to hear from everyone what excatly the "FLYER" for a party 
is to them... what does it do to you? for you? give you? say to you?

If youve ever chose to go to a party solely because of its flyer...
what was it that made you go? as opposed to some other party?

BTW
Anyone know where to get historical information on the "flyer"? ive 
looked into many databases with "lots of flyers" but have yet to find the 
broad progression of the art form we've grown SO accustombed to :)

THANKS RAVER PEOPLE! :)

*How to spot a _R A V E R_*

	*Ravers can perfectly understand and have amazing conversations with 
	anyone under the age of ten. 
        *Ravers know where all the best toy stores are. 
        *Ravers get the most mileage out of their shoes. The toes and 
	heels always curl up because they're so worn
        down. 
        *Ravers always wish the dj would spin that OC Transpo track that 
	they keep hearing on the bus ride home. 
        *Ravers are the only people who don't have their age calculated in 
	months, yet still wear and use pacifiers. 
        *Ravers always consider every new place they go to as a possible 
	location for a party. 
        *Ravers hug EVERYONE. 
        *Ravers can DANCE. 
        *Ravers can be found dancing everywhere EXCEPT the main dance 
	floor. 
        *Ravers understand the art of the bathroom conversation. 
        *Ravers choose their clothes by texture, colour, and size. 
        *Ravers love homemade clothes because they've seen the price tag 
	on a pair of Lithiums. 
        *Ravers get the most enjoyment out of gino/guito stories. 
        *Ravers always order water when they go out to clubs. 
        *Ravers realize that "Evian" spells "naivE" backwards. 
        *Ravers notice that the doors near the Mackenzie King Bridge have 
	an "e" on the handle. 
        *Ravers always know the most likely spot to find other ravers

A flyer to me is a tangible reminder of a very special event.  It helps me
conjure memories of the party, and helps me keep a record of which parties
I've attended.  Someday I'll make my own rave scrapbook, and it will
feature the flyers prominently.  Might even make it to the WWW!
Love and peace,
Eric

Personally, I like flyers because they make good souvenirs and help me to
remember all the fun or lack thereof of a party I've gone to.

Yeah, I have a photo album of most of the flyers for the last couple
years....some pretty neat ones out there. I need to buy a new album, cause I
completely filled one, and they are starting to collect in my drawer. Flyers
are rad, because, as someone already mentioned, they are good for remenising
and remembering the adventures I've been on. Some of them are pretty trippy
or original.

But, on the other hand. If we were to grow hemp on, as large a scale as
cigerettes.
Rumor has it; it would help our o-zone.   =]:.. 
 Heard some facts awhile back, stating how much CO2 (sp?) hemp filters.


Cigerettes truely do,,,,, suck..
But...  Here goes.....  I hate hearing lectures on the harmfull side
effects even more.

There's nothing we can do about it!

So I am watching Strange Universe the other night.. And I find out that;
cells can be destroyed by vibration. A vibration tuned for "popping"
selected cells. I saw it. It worked! They fryed that cell like it was
tomorrows dinner.. Just tune your radio to the right frequency, and you
blow up all the cancer cells in a dying patient. But..  They say, the
government shut down the research on this subject along time ago.  Go
figger..
  So.. Alot of people die because of cancer. Most of them probably didn't
even know that there was one last option left to try.. Thanx alot uncle
sam.
If all this is true. I see only two possible reason why our government
would close the books.
Reason number one: Population control!!!!!
Reason number two: Imagine the kinds of "secret" weapons the government can
make with this cell popping technology..
Have a nice day everyone!!   =]:...

Man..  I need to sleep..!  Only 13 unread messages to go...

 It seems that alot of people in the ravE scene; think that anything
competitive, is negative.
 It only becomes a negative thing, when someone don't show good

There is another party the same night that I'm going to... It's a hard
choice because I love Donald Glaude (I'm a seattle native) and the lineup
is terribly PHAT, but the other party, "The Moon"  thrown by "ByThePeople
(www.bythepeople.com) has a really nice lineup as well.  Maybe I'll hit
both parties.  Anyway there are always choices :)

Personally, i would never go to a party on the basis of its flyer :)  i 
might admire the art on them, but it completely depends on a) whos 
putting it on and b) how many of my friends will be at it :)

hi everyone.. i'm a newbie...some of you I may have met, cool.  SF is a great
place to be!  I'm looking forward to massive amounts of beautiful times
shared with all...

regarding the post for flyers... I have this new incredible book from England
on club raver party art flyers.  It has a history of the meaning  and
development of that little paper promotional piece we have all grown to love
and collect.  It has hundreds of fabulous historical party relics.   If you
want to see my copy let me know.  I keep the book here in the record store,
(Trance and Jungle Factory, Berkeley).

There is virtually NOTHING better than hanging out at the drum circle in GG 
Park on a warm sunday afternoon, hearing the usually complex and sometimes 
chaotic rythms.  Anyone else go?  Also, what ever happened to the "electronic 
drum circle" that was proposed and much discussed a couple months ago?  Did it 
ever go off?  

Finally, it sounds like Saturday night was a bust for most people. Did anyone 
make it up to Liquid House near Santa Rosa?  That almost warranted the drive...

Have a good Monday!

YES!!! My favorite question in the whole wide world!!! =3D)

>	* where did "techno" originate? ive heard chicago.. detroit... england

Ok, this how _I_ see things. Techno / electronic music originates in
Dusseldorf,
Germany. "Germany?" you ask. One word...KRAFTWERK. Inspired by their post-
modernistic surroundings (Dusseldorf is infamous for its industrialization),
they (Ralf Hutter and Florian Scheider) made a complete turnaround (they=
 were
both schooled in classical music), and started building their own=
 instruments
with which they recreated the sounds of the society along with a beat. Epics
of course include "Autobahn" (1974), "Radio Activity" (75) and the brilliant
"Computer World" (1980). And oh, "Tour de France" (83) was remixed by=
 Francois
Kevorkian and featured in the movie "Breakdance"...
Producers in Chicago, Detroit, and all over Europe heard what Kraftwerk were
doing, and they started working on what later turned into "techno", "house",
"electronic body music", "industrial", etc.

Any more questions? Feel free. =3D)

What about the fact that disco music was being innovated concurrently in
America? I've heard that disco evolved into house, after the disco scene
was blown apart/went underground thanks to the Saturday Night Fever craze.=
=20
During that period, lots of ex-disco composers started tweaking their
cheezy synth units (i.e. 303, etc.) in unholy ways and discovered some
crazy new sounds.  This was the origin of the Detroit scene, as I
understand it.

Please correct me if my facts are screwy.

WARMTH
the perfect name for this party. cuz all of you, made me, and my friends, 
and everyone i have talked to from the party feel all WARM and LOVED 
inside. 
the decorations were incredible, the lasers on the cielings reminded us 
of fireflies.. the protolab made my evening perfect, hell, all the djs 
did, oh YAY anomaly and somewhere over the rainbow, somehow that was the 
perfect end to a set for me. props props prop micron for that one.
still need to sleep from after that party, i'm afterglowing like all hell 
and saying "throw another warmth soon!" 

i want to say thanks to all of you, for being beautiful people. not just 
by being nice to me cuz it was my b-day, but by being there for friends 
in need. here's a side story about warmth. i met a girl on the floor 
during the protolab's little phat session, and she was worried cuz she 
had showed upw ith her friends hella drunk and took E for the first time 
and she was worried some guy had made her snort some other drug (after 
further questioning she had sniffed that vicks vapo-inhaler stuff.. ahh 
vicks). i told her and her friends if they need ANYTHING (cuz i know E 
and alcohol don't mix well at all) to come find me or one of my friends 
in the corner with the tent. sure enough, about an hour or so later, one 
of the friends came and grabbed me, i went oer and a girl was sitting 
there i guess she had been convulsing. she was trying to talk but it all 
came out like "Bwaabaawwaawa!" and her hands were taught. i talked her 
down a little bit and 
massaged her hands, but then i felt a wave of incredible nausEa hit 
me.. and so I ran and got some of ym friends to help her out while i 
calmed myself down. point of the story is, everyone was more than happy 
to help out this girl, everyone at warmth was GIVING of themselves -- 
love, hugs, smiles, fruit, music.. it was a beautiful party, and it was, 
i felt, a true representation of our community and how it should be ALL 
the time. everyone was looking out for each other, and trying to have the 
best time as well as making others have the best time. i can't WAIT until 
the next warmth, hell the next PARTY (yay ~a new hope~) to see you all 
again, and share in your WARMTH and love :)
one quick question: what's up for saturday night? 
thanks again to all of you who make me smile on a daily basis just by 
being you!
love and hugs,
lara

I think a flyer should symbolize the vision the event is trying to create.
If its a four-color flyer, the party better have a fat sound system and
insane visuals!  :)  If its a b&w flyer, I think it'd be smaller and less
produced.

I've seen other flyers with women in seductive poses. I wouldn't attend
those parties because the flyer's mood is not right for me.

Yeah, it will be a hard choice, and I think "The Moon" will definitly be a
good party (assuming they have a cool location). I saw Evil Eddie Richards a
while back, and he kicked ass. I still don't know where I'm going.

is it just me, or is this cloning stuff 
thats come to reality as of late kinda creepy? 

If a human were to be cloned, would it have a soul?

If not, then is this a 'child of the machine?'

If it were to have a soul,  -say it were a clone of me- would i share my
soul with the clone?
or would it have it's own soul?

If i were a clone, am i manmade or a miracle like a real child?

i have like a billion whacked ass questions, but i dont think anyone on
this or any other mailng list could answer, but my brain has been going a
trillion miles an hour since ive heard this is reality.

I looked to the left and right of these three letters thinking there may be
burnt out letters that used to say something else, but there were none. The
only other thing  i can remember is that below the letters LSD it said sale. 

I was wondering if somebody sees it, could you get the phone number off of
it for me? =o)

posrcards are a great idea!

i have lots of my favorite flyers cut to fit like j-cards for mix tapes and
dupes... Especially when a dj's name is printed to fit right at the side bar.
 I'll use them instead of the j-card that came with the tape originally.
 Then I can remember a fabulous party when I listen to the mix...Magazine ads
and postcards (the free ones they give out at resturants) work great as well.
 

oh and my name is...

Um, I believe that a 'clone' according to the technique the british
scientists used would involve extracting DNA from an organism, and then
gestating a 'twin' in a lab, just like a test tube baby.

Thus, the 'clone' would grow from infancy into adulthood like a normal
organism.  Therefore, it would have as much of a soul as an identical
twin, but just be separated by a number of years from its brother/sister.

chemical and electrical interactions.  I think the notion of souls is
another example of egocentric humanity trying to make our existence seem
more significant than it really is... aargh, this paper I'm writing is
turning me into an intellectual ass!  must... sleep.... now ;)

I don't think cloning is that strange at all.  Nature does it all the time
when twins, triplets, etc. are born.  How is it different if we do it in a
test tube?  Everyone has different experiences in life and twins naturally
"seperate" and become different.

Genes don't create people.

We could not recreate either Mahatma Gandhi or Adolf Hitler, because the
clones would not experience the same things as the originals.

I personally think that humanity is like an adolescent experimenting,
growing, exploring.  This stuff is inevitable.

I don't get scared about the future because I believe that humanity will grow
spiritually to keep pace with it's material growth.  We are just in a
temporary painful state.



The shocking technology is just around the corner.

Imagine biological recreating humans to be space-faring birds, underwater
fish, or huge earth-moving worms.  Maybe someday people will choose real or
imaginary animals to occupy.

Imagine harnessing energy that flows between vastly seperated time periods in
the history and future.

Imagine discovering hidden connections in the quantum fluctuations which fill
space that allow communication or travel between vastly seperated regions of
the universe.

Imagine scientists discovering that the universe is a holograph and that they
can look into the far reaches of space and see atoms within their bodies or
vice versa.

Imagine all of humanity uncovering vivid memories of infinite past lives or
becoming aware of every place their spiritual energy has been.

Imagine ceaseless communication between humans, aliens, angels, nature and
the universe.  Imagine no one dying until they felt they had completed what
they wished or needed to do.  Imagine even those who have died being easily
accessable to all who are living.

Imagine every spiritual being on the planet merging their energies so closely
that the planet becomes one indistinguishable being.

Closer in the future may just be a complete optimization of the human brain.
 There is no reason not to utilize it in the most practical and
psychologically/sprititually healthy manner possible.  Our drugs will look
like dinosaurs in the future.


Cloning is pretty boring.  

How would they get a clone of me to reach the same age as me anyway?  I'd
have to go in a spaceship near the speed of light for some time while my
clone on earth grew up.  And they'd have to do unbelievable things to raise
him in the same identical environment as I grew up in.  (mmmmm....maybe they
could extract my memories and put them into him.   That sounds exotic.)

The soul can probably be duplicated, although maybe that would wreck harm in
the balance of things.  I figure all my spiritual energy (soul) is pretty
much dependent on a source outside of me, larger and more transcendent.  So I
exist as a spiritual being only so long as I breathe in the air of that
larger, more encompassing reality.  I am organic and travel down a definite
path in life, but the "me" is really something I am borrowing.  I "own" me so
long as I love me, but then again I "own" all things which I love.  All
things which love me "own" me too.

I read a sci-fi book once where a computer dynamically recreated a planet and
all it's life as solutions to an advanced equation.  However there were only
certain solutions which were stable and self-consistent.  I think that things
like killing one's mother before one is born are impossible.  A reality like
that is not self-consistent.  Perhaps duplicating a soul is the same.  The
universe only requires one of each soul, because that soul was specificly
tailored for a place in the larger whole.

But then again....I think that souls repeat themselves, in a sense, all the
time.  For example, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed.  Are they not the same
soul?  Do they not teach the same essential spiritual message?

Cloning humans is possible, although not that extraordinary or useful for a
well-balanced society.  Cloning souls is probably impossible or very
unlikely.  The likelihood of the exact same soul being required twice in the
solution of the universe as a whole is unlikely considering how complicated a
soul is.

I'm not sure where exactly the soul is.  I guess I imagine a soul as a
droplet of spiritual energy that condenses inside of living things.  If a
duplicate of a human being was created, I'm sure a soul would condense inside
of it too.  I doubt a duplicate soul would serve the world as well as one a
little different.


Lotsa thoughts churning in my head.  Ask me more questions.


Peace and love,


- Justin

Hmm, I don't really believe in complicated chemical and electrical
interactions.
I think that in reality these energies are complicated manifestations of a
more primal spiritual energy.  Have you ever heard of the God-particle?
 Lotsa quantum theorists like to imagine that there is some fundamental way
all the forces of the universe unite.  Unfortunately, since we can't
reproduce the Big Bang, we will never be able to study that particle, but I
believe that if we could, it would be very spiritual.

As far as I can tell, reality tends to become what we believe it to be
(especially true with acid), but also true in cases like wave-particle
duality.  What seem like simple questions: is the particle here or there; is
it moving at 99% of the speed of light or 99.5% are unanswerable until an
observer looks at it and creates a reality.  Nothing but abstract
probabilities and potentialities exist before that.  It flies in the face of
a tinker-toy, mechanistic view of the universe.

Now it could be that humanity is egocentric and looking for significance that
does not exist.  But I tend to think that reality is a little warmer and more
friendly.  How could a fundementally cruel and insignificant world be stable
enough to support itself?  How many times have you walked into a strange and
new place (like me, move to San Fran) and seen somebody you know?  The world
is small.  The universe is too.  There are connections between what happens
out there in space and down here on Earth that we can't pretend to
understand.  Chaos theory talks about how a small change like a butterfly's
wings flapping can eventually cause a change in weather.  The same things is
true for the connections of reality.

I don't claim to understand the soul.  All I can do is muse.  But I think
it's clear that there are dimensions of reality beyond and outside of time
and space and our everyday sense of logical connections.  This reality, for
lack of another way to understand it, is what I consider spiritual reality.
 It produces awe and transcendence, because it is larger than we are and
beyond our conception.  That same place that produces that sense of
transcendence is what I consider to be the soul.  It's the place where
spiritual energy resides.  It's the place where we perceive, love, and
comprehend.

(BTW: I don't think you're an intellectual ass for mentioning your beliefs.
 I respect you for it.)

Take care,

 - Justin

The existence of the soul.  Now there is an interesting question.  =
What/Who are we?  This is one of the oldest questions of humanity, as =
unanswerable now as it was when first thought about way back when.  We =
drift though life 99.99999% of the time oblivious of where our thoughts =
originate from, and relate to.  Try this experiment.    Sit on a chair =
and look at your hand.  It is incredibly complex in it's make up, from =
the cellular level up.  Each piece fits perfectly into this incredible =
articulate instrument for manipulating the world around you.  Now clench =
a fist, spread your fingers, flex a muscle.  How did you do that?  You =
think(?) and it happens.  Was that just an abstraction of the chemical =
and electrical impulses that you are made up of ,
 >(just a complicated mess of chemical and electrical interactions

or=20

[these] energies are complicated manifestations of a more primal =
spiritual energy.

Which is truth.  What is truth.  What creates that voice in your head =
when you form a thought?  What is a thought?

I do not believe that these questions can be answered easily, or at all. =
 Each person must come to grips with an explanation that makes them =
comfortable with *reality* as they see it.

"I think therefore I am"      - Ren=E9e Decartes
                =20
 Not just another catch phrase,  ponder that statement, and think about =
the paradox that arises if we are just chemical and electrical =
interactions.  Think of the paradox that arises if we are something =
more.  Is the very existence of your thought direct proof that you are a =

believe that if we could, it would be very spiritual.

As far as I can tell, reality tends to become what we believe it to be

a tinker-toy, mechanistic view of the universe.

that

understand.  Chaos theory talks about how a small change like a =
butterfly's
wings flapping can eventually cause a change in weather.  The same =

true for the connections of reality.

I don't claim to understand the soul.  All I can do is muse.  But I =

it's clear that there are dimensions of reality beyond and outside of =
time
and space and our everyday sense of logical connections.  This reality, =
for
lack of another way to understand it, is what I consider spiritual =
reality.
 It produces awe and transcendence, because it is larger than we are and
beyond our conception.  That same place that produces that sense of
transcendence is what I consider to be the soul.  It's the place where
spiritual energy resides.  It's the place where we perceive, love, and
comprehend.

(BTW: I don't think you're an intellectual ass for mentioning your =
beliefs.
 I respect you for it.)

Take care,

But they had a very funky little 303 line warbling away in the background

The drum circle is HOT!  I spent hours there, banging on my djembe, and
beating out rhythms on the cali sticks with my friend Tom, and with a lot of
new friends who wanted to learn how to use them.  Playing with those martial
arts sticks is so much fun.  

There are a lot of ravers who hang out at the circle.  A beautiful vibe
under the warm, spring sun.  

See you there next week.  Look for me with the sticks.

Peace and love,

Flyerz eh.. yeah they are pretty important. I look at flyers and its gotta have 
something about it that goes, "wow man this isn't like cheesy". I see too many flyers 
from all over the us that are jus a fractal with "trippy" colors and some sort of cheesy 
3D graphic overlayed on it. 
 There are a lot of good flyers out there, the best one I have ( I actually have 2 of 
them) is the H.A.B.I.T. flyer form seattle. its a 1200 and the platter spinns around to 
tell the dates and lineups of the coming events..
 Anyways, like I was saying flyers are important, and they serve to remind us of the 
things we have done, and to get us excited for the things to come. :)

Greets,
     Kraftwerk is definately one of the pioneers, but we also shouldn't forget
Tangerine Dream's music (from Germany also) from around 1974 to 1976. 
Actually, this stuff sounds more like today's trance than Kraftwerk sounds like
today's techno.  If you want to be truly amazed, listen to the album "Phaedra"
by TD, and keep in mind that it came out in 1974. It was one of the first
albums to sequenced synthesizers alone for all the rhythm parts.  They tweak
filters to create energy buildups and everything.  You would expect it to be
cheezy, but in fact (or maybe opinion), if it were released today, techno
freaks would still praise it.  Don't take this Tangerine Dream advertisement to
mean that all their albums are good.  After '76 they got heavily into making
film soundtracks, and started making some cheezy ass music.  Some may disagree,
but the only albums I would recommend are "Phaedra", "Ricochet", and "Rubycon".
 Anyway,
                                       Steve

I was there for a little while.  On a nice day, its definitely a cool place to 
hang out at.  There was a number of people trancing out.  There seemed to be a 
a nice freaky vibe going on.

Good Morning everyones...

	Well I just don't believe it's right for me to post a review of our 
own party... but your words, dear raver, speak for themselves...
Thank yous:
I really would like to thank everyone involved for taking their time 
and effort to help set up, dance, trance, beat their feet to the funky 
beat, and tear down way later ('bout 10 AM)...
I also want to send the warmest thanks to the SFR family:  Branka, 
Matt, Pengo, Scoot C, Jonathan D (Hey, I think I promised something 
about helping out ;). And Everyone else in the SFR that made it out... 
 If I haven't met you yet pop up and say high!!!  SFR and all 
associated to it will always have a spot in my heart.
More thanks to the Rebels that help make the nights journies a 
memorable one:  Deepfog, Micron, Realit-E, Radon, Mudfoot, and AndyW 
 you guys all ROCK!!!
And also a thank you to the other promoters out there that showed 
support:  Euphonic Genesis in SJ, Warmth family, Ben and Dhrien's SC 
crew, Happy Kids bunch, was there even a few faces from Harmony out 
there??? And also to the promoters that contacted us and gave support 
even though they weren't there freezin',  their warmth was felt in 
spirit.
Thank you also for the non-Sfravers that we're out there showing that 
we all can co-exist w/o incident.  No fights. No bad vibes.  Just your 
general wackyness.  Much love to all of you...
One last thanks to the San Mateo Sheriff Dept. For not busting us @ 
1:30.  Usually the sight of two Imperial Cruisers is a sure shutdown, 
but, for whatever reason.  They kept going. (Sorry For the quick power 
outage Micron and all).

And one last word....
We are alive.  We are the new underground...  I remember the posts in 
regards to the scene being dead...  Well, I guess 200-300 ravers going 
OFF on a beach, in the middle of nowhere, with Jungle, House, Trance 
and other unclassifiable stuff bleeding thru the speakers,  during 
March, in the cold, for a free party shows that we are still very much 
alive...
Thanks for making our first outdoor party (and first outdoor of 97') a 
memorable one.  And it will happen again (once we pay off our credit 
card bills...)
				In April....

"Stay Connected"
---Adam  (Anakin)

And if you, dear raver wants to give us any input to make our events 
even better,  drop me a line... Any other kind of music style would 
you like to hear?  All questions, comments, praise, critisims are 
appreciated.  After all, these parties aren't for a profit (HAH), nor 
to perpetuate the 20/20 myths conveyed thru the media.  These parties 
are for you.  Look in a mirror and you'll see the same people who 
throw Rebel Alliance Sound.  Raves, for ravers by ravers.

And don't forget "Atem" (German for "breath") which predates "Phaedra"
by a few years - the title track lasts a whole side of the vinyl (maybe
20 minutes) and for the first half builds gradually to until it reaches
a total frenzy about half-way through, then suddenly drops out to this 
veerrryyy spacy, very quiet free-form ambience. It's supposed to be the 
breath - breath in, breath out.

Actually I remember when Phaedra came out and *we* thought it was 
pretty commercial compared with earlier TDream stuff! How things change
in the perspective of the years. I remember seeing TDream live at a
little university gig in England (I crewed for them!) around the time
of Phaedra and they were amazing - that huge wall of sequencers and 
knobs to twiddle is now condensed into a 303, basically.

Sorry, we meant for the party to be posted in the weekly club section, as 
it occurs on a monthly basis. My fault for not specifying this to Derek

to the evening.  Seems that he loved both the crowd and the vibe so much 
that following the party he has asked to be our resident DJ.  
I'll let you take from that what you will.

As one of the three promoters of this party, I don't know what to say 
about what you saw on the dancefloor. We throw parties and for the most 
part receive very favorable turnouts and responses.  I too am often amazed 
by some of the things that I see people do in clubs AND AT RAVES. Like it 
or not, alcohol and drugs seem to make people act a hell of a lot 
differently then they would in any normal day to day situation.  But I 
hope that's not new news to you. That said, there were a group of six 
people who after seeing the environment in the club wasn't what they had 
expected, asked to speak to one of the promoters.  I came to the door and 
gladly refunded their money and provided them with directions AND CAB FARE 
to another more raver friendly party.

Apparently VSF is still listed in the "pink section" as a gay club on 
Saturday nights and a lot of people who attended were in fact gay. Whether 
these girls were or weren't is irrelevant. 

It's weird to have to appologize for other peoples actions...

actually, our esteemed colleague mr. beck is correct in saying 
4-ever...in fact the correct answer is "never", because even if i did get 
out of the train, i'd be killed instantly on the tracks.  and then there 
would be no more deepfog.  =\  well, i guess you could clone me...call me

Too true!... All the events in life play almost as big a role in defining
oneself (imho) as does genetic makeup.
(Genetic makeup?  Is that supposed to make you look sexy on the cellular
level?  Okay, okay, bad joke.)  :)

I do sometimes, after seeing what we've done with other fantastic 
discoveries, like nuclear fusion.  I agree, though, that this is just
another "first step" in our progress, and that the really amazing stuff,
even as far as genetic manipulation goes, is yet to come.  Progress is
always a bumpy road, for there will always be those who wish to prey upon
it for personal gain at the cost of others.  I believe this is simply
because our technological prowess surpassed our capacities for social
responsibility long ago (probably in the late Middle Ages), and we haven't
caught up since.  So progress will always be painful at first.  But
eventually, we learn to take responsibility for our actions, and our
social capacity rises...

Now as far as the soul goes...  I don't understand why people always place 
this gap between science and metaphysics.  I'm of the opinion that 
spirituality is the culmination of a lot of science that's so far beyond
us right now that we couldn't possibly understand it for many eons...
maybe even never.  (I consider myself both a scientist and a
spiritualist; in a sense, I find they are one and the same.)  Anyways, I
don't think that there's anything wrong with assuming a physical
explanation of the soul; it's just on such a totally HUGE scale that we
can't even hope to grasp it.  Imagine a circuit/pathway that involved
100,000,000,000 neurons!  I, for one, can't really even appreciate a
number that big, let alone try to figure out any of the pathways linking
these cells all together.  Now imagine that this system was dynamic, and
could switch all its connections around, modify or duplicate connections
anywhere else in the circuit, anytime.  Why couldn't something *that*
complicated be capable of *thought*?  The mass of cells in our heads is
_so_ amazingly complex, I don't see why they couldn't synergize and
generate all kinds of psychic energy (including whatever it is that we
call *thought*), pick up on others' energy, and maybe even use the energy
to manipulate matter (with training, perhaps...)!  And this isn't even
taking into account all the scientific quantum-stuff we haven't even
discovered yet, that might also be playing a part in our minds!  To me,
that qualifies each of us as having a "soul", though perhaps not in the
traditional religious sense.  Our minds are so immensely complex and so
beyond us that all we can do is give a name to the source of the beauty of
thought, and call it a soul.

It's kind of like how we look at the universe:  all we see looking through
our great big looking-glasses are a bunch of stars, galaxies, nebulae,
etc.  Nothing but beautiful bodies of rock, gas, ice, and plasma...  as
far as we can tell from here.  But even when our greatest physicists look
up to the heavens through humanity's most advanced technological "eyes,"
they haven't the foggiest idea how each of them are interacting, or what's
actually going on in any of the billions and trillions of star-systems
scattered across the sky.  The fact that an alien child just shot a
spitwad across the room in class yesterday on some seemingly insignificant
little dot of a planet somewhere in the middle of nowhere might be a
totally crucial event in cosmic history; but we may never know.  :)

Anyways, I am *totally* rambling at this point; thanx for bearing with me
through my little philosophical soapbox-speech...  Much love to you all-

YES, YES, YES, I SAW IT friday night! It made me smile for hours, and

It usually says HILLSDALE. Now it says hil LSD ale but the hil and the
ale have had the lights removed/broken out. Below it is usually a
picture of a some happy dweebs consuming useless yet expensive items
as they assume is their meaning in life. With the influence of the LSD
above, this common practice would be so very eliminated that of course
the light below was also taken out.

LSD in five foot red block letters floating in the evening sky! Life
is indeed beautiful sometimes.

I'll just throw my $0.02 in, by adding "E2-E4" by Manuel Gottsching...I
don't remember if he was involved in T-Dream or not, but he was originally
with Ash-Ra... Anyway, it's 33 minutes of gently pulsating synth with spanish
classical style guiter riffs laid over the top...pretty amazing considering
it's now 20 yrs old (or thereabouts).

Checked out Springheel Jack at Bimbo's on Friday night after seeing Lost
Highway, which may have skewed the whole experience for me. =) I'd never
been to Bimbo's before - not the place I'd choose for a dance event, but
very elegant venue nonetheless. Sort of a 50's jazz supper club vibe.
Springheel Jack played some decent tracks - and I like their records quite
a bit - but it didn't seem very live and there was no interaction with the
audience. It didn't help that club's sound system wasn't really up to
reproducing jungle basslines and was overdriven for much of the show. I was
surprised at how crowded the show was, but it wasn't by any means an
underground contingent - more what I'd think of as the Guardian crowd. I
wonder if this was a preview of what's to come with weekly listings in the
SF Weekly...

Saturday night I went to hear the out of town jocks at One Track Mind. It
had a fairly dark and ominous feel to it due to the sheets of black plastic
and minimal lighting, but I suspect his was intentional - hearkening to
minimal midwest undergrounds. Chris O.S.T. was playing some nice ambient
electronica live upstairs at this point and DJ Dick was playing downstairs.
The two detroit DJ's, DJ Dick and DJ Godfather, stuck mainly to electro,
which was great - and it was cool to see everyone into it on the dance
floor. They went for the cut & scratch style of DJing, yet the tricks just
didn't do it for me. Too much ambitious scratching attempts with poorly
timed execution for me - the groove was interrupted every couple minutes.
After seeing Kid Koala last week at the Ninja Tunes show it's going to be
hard to impress me with scratching, though. He knew what to do. Heather
Hart played after Godfather and was pretty impressive - a flawless mixer
and a nice tracky techno selection.

Jonas commented on the crowd at OTM. There were some annoying dealers on
the stairs and quite a bit of sportwear, but there still seemed to be a
decent vibe, especially downstairs on the dancefloor. I suspect the crowd
consistency may have been somewhat due to the lack of events last Saturday.

Flyers to me, make excellent memories of the
past, and wall paper for your room!

Whether it was the event that happened just
last week, the weekly that happened three
years ago, or the flyer that had that one DJ that
you never heard, who moved your soul in a
very special way, each and every flyer has a 
place in my heart of the great times I've shared
with others in the scene.

Peace, MR2

Also sampled by Sueno Latino for their track of the same name and by Carl
Craig for Remake. I'm always amazed at how much 70's ambient (ie Rainbow
Dome Music by Steve Hillage) sounds like the stuff the Orb and other new
school ambient pioneers did in the early nineties.

I noticed on the FREEky post that nest to my name it said the "famous
sfraves dj"......PLEASE disregard this.  I was not aware that tony was
going to put that on there and he has been spanked ;)

there are no "famous" anyones in our scene and i'd like to see it stay
that way.  And if it was meant as a joke, well then tony i'm sorry for
spanking u. :P

Hope everyone had a GREAT weekend.  The weather definitely seemed to
cooperate with us.  AND i hope to see/meet some of u at freaky and at
the cloud factory party "c o n d e n s a t i o n" this weekend.

Enjoy the rest of your day,
:)

Hey what's up people....

Monty here.  Hey when I'm not DJ'ing or watching Reality-type TV like "When
Animals Attack" and "The Ultimate Fighting Championship," I spend my time
working at an online Information Provider called NetNoir.  You've heard of
the cable channel BET?  Well, we're kinda like a BET for the Internet & AOL. 

For those of you who are AOL subscribers or who have access, There is an
event happening tonight that you may be interested in. Aux 88, Detroit's
premier Electro duo, will be online for a live chat! This is the first time
they've ever done something like this, so it should be a lot of fun.  The
chat starts at 6pm.
To get there, go Keyword:NetNoir, then click on the picture of AUX 88 in the
left corner. The first five people in the chat room will recieve a special
"AUX Pack" courtesy of Direct Beat Records! Thanks...

Out

indeed!  this party had a real vitality-energy flowing through it.  it felt
very... fresh (in the classic meaning of the word, as in "fresh-squeezed",
not as in "hey, man, that party was phresh!" [though it was that too]).
very alive.

i must have talked to a couple dozen people who said the same thing.

it was partly the party, and partly my individual experience, but i
definitely see raves differently after friday night.

Thank You!

I like to look at the pretty flyers.  For example, the Anolog flyer that Space
Children put out for their party.  Just because it is pretty does not mean it
is going to be good.  Let me just say that I heard Anolog wasn't the greatest
party.  The reason why I did not attend this party, was not because of their
flyer or whatever.  It was because of their previous mess ups.  Until they
prove to me that they can throw a decent party, maybe I will start showing up
there.

Somebody tried to teach me something about flyers so I may attend good parties
(stupid me didn't know that at the time).  I have noticed that the not so
pretty flyers were to ones to go to.  But I learned in time how to chose my
parties, through flyers and people.

Well as you know, you won't be seeing me at UBIQUITOUS.  To all of you that
know me, I will be seeing you this Saturday at a very HAPPY PARTY
=))))))))))))))).  It will be so nice to see all of your smiling faces again! 
Take care, be happy, Keep smilinG, lotsa huGGGGGGGGGS!

oxoxoxoxoxo,

Hi,
Mohan from FTT with another BSP....  We'd like to thank everyone who was at
Bimbo's on Friday for the Spring Heel Jack show. Apologies to those who
could not get in as the event sold out.  John and Ashley from SHJ send
their love and they'll be back in October for FTT's HALLOWEEN TRIBAL
MASSIVE... 
On the update tip, this month we'll be doing WINTER OASIS in Miami with
DAFT PUNK, and ORGANIC in SF on March 28th. Rockers Hi-Fi (formerly known
as Original Rockers) will be headlining and I'm sure their blend of sounds
will 'rock' the night! 
In April we'll be starting our National Summer Tour, and taking a breather
here in SF with the Porno for Pyros make up show.
May will kick off our brand new party, EPIC Live with a full-on hard
hitting rave with special guests, the CHEMICAL BROTHERS and the ORB, both
performing live!!!
We've also secured the LTJ Bukem LOGICAL PROGRESSION II tour for all dates
in the US, and we're planning a special kick-off here in SF late May, early
June.  Following that, the Goldie and Metalheadz US tour. And in the works,
our first International tour (Hawaii, Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Hong Kong,
Bangkok, Singapore, Jakarta and Bali) in August/October.
I apologize for this long message. We're constantly trying to improve on
our events and want to give our best at all shows, though we know this is
not always possible. 
If you have any suggestions, criticisms or grievances, please feel free to
email me personally at email : mohan@funkytekno.com

hi everyone,
                wow.. i'm actually glad that someone else noted 

                        <<people disrespecting the space
			<<vibe/crowd
			<<too many people!!!

because 654 mission street is my space. well i dont own the place, but robyn
and myself rent it out for cyborganic.

                i came kinda late to the party... and when i walked in i
immediately noticed a different feeling of the place. the last couple of
parties including Warmth and Madness had a very good aura about it.  the
place wasnt the same... 
              <<We walked into a PITCH BLACK room. The walls and the floor were
"decorated" with black plastic bags. And the only light source was a
big screen showing different movies>>

      <<What really bummed me out was the total disrespect for the space that
                        was displayed.If you never get to go to another
party at                 654 Mission, last night was probably the reason. I
seriously         don't think it's worth putting up signs about no smoking
if you, as a                         promoter, are going to smoke in the
rooms where smoking is     allegedly prohibited.>>


i have to definitely agree with you on that one. well the problem with the
smoking part is that you could smoke in our tiny smoking 'dungeon' in the
basement for the last parties. i guess if you've been to a party at
cyborganic before, you went down there to get your nicotine fix. but my co
workers decided to make this a non smoking party at the last minute. and
robyn and i had to be the bad guys. we went around w/ mag lites asking
people to please put their cigarettes out, or go outside and smoke. i got a
pretty good reception from that-- except for the people who put it out, then
went somewhere else and lit up again. or the ones who didnt believe me...and
blew smoke in my face. that _wasnt_ cool. we also asked one of the guys
putting it on to put up no smoking signs... he put up 5, right in a row on a
wall that was barely visible.  

        i also didnt really care for the people blatantly selling x and acid
in my hallway-- yelling <<3 for $5.>>  please, if youre going to sell-- i
_dont_ want to know about it. ok?


but enough of my banter. please, i ask all of you, take it to heart and
respect spaces. i think we are responsible enough to do so. tell your
friends as well. i'm not a babysitter, i'm not your mom. it totally sucks
going up to people, repeatedly, and asking them to not to smoke, tag, etc.
cyborganic is my second home. i hope all of you who come to cyborganic again
treat the place as you would treat _your_ home. this goes for all spaces.
thanks.

take care
-cassandra

I agree. This party was wiered. Not teribly good, nor bad. Just
really... funky. The decorations were close to nil, as I think the
plastic bag cover was more to protect the location. And yet they had
plenty of free fruit and water.  DJ Godfather did rip it up. But to
really enjoy that kind of performance you have to watch the DJ as well
as listen, it seems, to appreciate it. And I have never gotten the point
to MC's. Especially at a party like this. All the man does is say "Awwww
yea! Partys goin' on right here!" and I'm just thinking to myself "Dude,
shut UP!". Looking at others shake their heads in discust led me to
think the feeling was the same for most of the crowd. I also noticed
some tagging out front of the place (Cyborganic) that I didn't remember
seeing before. Vibe-wise it was nothing compared to Warmth from last
weekend. (Hi Tony!)

Tell me what you think and how I can make it better. Some info about the
Campout is there too. I'll be updating it after the weekend when a few of

I've been reading this thread and it seems there are plenty of good points
that you all have raised.  One of the most important points is that of
"who" is throwing these parties.  Right now, I beleive that there are 3,
count' 'em 3 people of color doing regular events (Martel (still?), Kevin
of FTT, Mac G. in SJ).

Also, I think that there is a serious gap as to the reasons we all party in
the first place.  I think those reasons are not shared in communities with
a lage number of minorities.  Let's face it, E, LSD, GHB, etc. are all
designer drugs.  They cost $$$ to purchase.  The drug culture, despite the
media's hype about drugs in communities of color, is not really embedded
there.  People of color are less prone to try designer drugs.  The drugs of
choice in neighborhoods of color are alcohol , cigarettes, and pot (CDC
'95, '96).

Speed is used less, and heroin is used much less.  Dance culture in sf is
closely tied to drug culture, asd a matter of fact thye are symbiotic.
This could also affect the number of people of color in attendance at
parties.

No, certainly it is not planned.  However, there are tinges of racism and
overt sexism in the scene.

Very, very , very few people in SF are booked on talent alone.  Sorry to
burst any libertarian bubble, but it does not work that way.  It's all a
matter of contacts, and paying respects and being accepted into a certain
clique and having a good rep that matter.  Most importantly it is who you
know that is the most important, and if you have talent too?  That's a
plus, but once again, it is not required.

Bad spinning is caused by a number of things from shitty sound systems all
the way down to piss poor skills at the dex.  The bad spinning will cease
when people become alot more genuine as to what they really plan to do when
they throw a party.

Here, here.  After all, I as wellas others know who started all this? ;)  I
take the opposite tack almost, if the person is a person of color or a
woman, and they hand me a tape, I can pretty much bet that it'll be a
slammin' piece of work.  There are a number of reasons, one of them being
the notion that if you're not a white male then you have to be 2-3x's as
good, and people internalize this.  The result, great effort is put into a
demo/mixtape and it shows that they are trying to impress (I have hundreds
of demos, so this is from my own experiences, YMMV).  Looking at the scene
I have found Charlotte (Baroness), Dani, Nikki Rivera, Tracy to have plenty
of skills, but still bookings are lighter than any of the various male
packs running around.  It goes to show you that:

RULE #1 IF YOU WANT TO GET BOOKED IN SF:
-START YOUR OWN PARTY AND PLAY THERE.

The formula for success.  Merit and the marketplace will decide your fate.
Good luck.

The other problme I see with all of this is an effort being made by people
of color to form their own groups to help each other.  YSH was a perfect
example of some of the ladies of the scene taking charge and doing it their
way.  Now I certainly didn't agreee with their tactics or policies, but
thier hearts were in the right place.  Others would do well to mimick such
a plan for their own designs.  In other words, stop talking about it and do
something....IMO of course.

Also, here in this 49 sq. mi. city, it pays to talk to people, support your
friends, support your posse, pay proper respects, and, in time, get the
bookings you deserve.  But you could forego all that bullshit, start your
own party, and play at it.  That's much simpler.

new hope was such a pleasant blast.

the spot was incredible, the sublime power of the ocean can make any party
and no crazy baldheads went for a swim either.

this was such a successful event, major props for andy and his crew. all
the dj's played great. I arrived at micron's set and he was laying some
fun tunes down. Anakon threw down some hard sounds that was pretty fun to
see from where I was standing. The lights and people grooving in the ocean
nite was so surreal and the sound was pretty good while competing with
mother nature0. Then alas the drum and bass, what a treat for the late
hours. The sound that filled the beach was very thick. Mudfoot played some
great tunes with a very trippy style, good stuff. 

Come the morning and the bright sun, wake up Andy your on next. His set
was so perfect for the gorgeuos morning. Uplifting stuff that I could not
stop dancing. What a joy the morning crowd was having. Played frisbee and
danced around till I could no more.


Funny point, two fisheram walked down the trail with pole and bucket in
hand. You should of seen there faces when they approached the speakers and
freaks dancing to boom boom boom.

Funny point two, the dude with the tick in his neck and his posse trying
to get it out. He wanted someone to burn it out with a cigarett, that was
funny.

thanks to adam

Okay instead of trying to see the whole "forest" on the topic of cloning
(which I think is beyond our ability to comprehend). Let's just look at
one tree.

I have a disability called ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), which is
genetically transferred. It's not a disability like being in a
wheelchair or being blind where one can see the disorder. For visually,
it's invisible to those around you. Your behavior is where the problem
is: Forgetfulness, constantly late, disorganized, unable to concentrate
on tedious tasks, ect. Yet there are many advantages to having ADD.
People with ADD are often more creative, have more energy, and are
better in high pressure situations. Example, many race car drivers have
ADD, so do many emergency room doctors. Many famous people throughout
history are believed to have had ADD like Mozart, Ben Franklin,
Leonardo, ect. And I'll bet many of the most creative Party Production
groups, DJs, and other contributors to our scence also owe their
creativeness to having ADD.

Now let's say that through discoveries made through cloning technology,
it were possible for someone like me to be able to ensure that my
son/daughter when born, did not have ADD. I tell you now that If I
could, I'd do it in a second. To live with ADD is hell. Yes I many be
more creative than the average Joe but I'd trade that in a second to not
be late for  every date, or to never again misplace important papers in
my house, or to never again become so frustrated on a test at school
that I must leave to room and go punch the bathroom wall over and over,
or to never again realize that I've been daydreaming and that I missed
my freeway exit about 20 miles back.

But I can also see reasons for not messing with this natural process. If
I were to be able to rid my kin of ADD, then many others would too.
Think for a second the implications of such a change in our genetic
pool. There would be fewer creative minds, fewer pioneers of new and
progressive thought, fewer new ideas would come about because of the
change in the populace. And while such an operation would probably be
available only to the wealthy, those unable to have the operation done
on their kin would be burdened with a world that becomes less and less
tolerable to people with the disorder.

Ok. Sorry this was so long. Any thoughts?

 Interesting idea but not always true. One can give respect and not get 
it. One can choose to not give respect and still get it. It really 
depends on the situation.

 I however feel that the disrespect shown by Paul is at least as great as 
my own. Mine is just more honest and direct.

  But it seems to me that ADHD is already being squashed with Ridlin 
(sp).  While eliminating ADHD genetically would clearly have some 
drawbacks, I don't think it would be worse than the current system of 
treatment.  Ridlin does as good a job (if not better) of cutting down on 
creativity as it does of ridding users of the 'bad' effects of ADHD.

  two things...
one - just because an idea is stupid, doesn't mean people will avoid it.  
Especially with regard to ensuring genetic diversity.  Witness americas 
corn crops: 99+% are identical.  We're basically asking for trouble.

two - the sheep experiment was done *I believe* for cloning sheep that 
carry special recombinant DNA used for medicine.  This is the only way 
the process can be cost effective (those sheep are worth a fortune for 
their milk) and also the only way it can save any effort (inserting the 
DNA to code for the medicine is hard).

  Lets face it, lsd is not a designer drug.  Stop and think what the term 
designer drug means.  (mdma is not one either).

  The two characteristics of drugs found in innercity/poor neighborhoods 
seem to be they provide escape from the user's surroundings and/or they 
are addictive.  The former explains why psychedelics (think set/setting) 
aren't the hot drug of choice in poverty stricken areas.  The latter of 
course does not make something more appealing to a user, but since the 
70's, the drug pusher has had as much to say about which chemicals a 
person uses.  Alcohol and cigarettes, though legal, exemplify this as 
well as crack can.

Just a quick note to say...

New Hope rocked!!!!!!  The Rebel Alliance is alive and well in the Bay
Area!  I had such a fantastic time, I just wanted to thank everyone who
made it happen, especially Adam, and all the DJs, and all the people who
donated time, money, an energy to the event.

Also, thanks for listening to me spin a long set!  Adam went out of his way
to give some new DJs a chance, and I think that is awesome!  I'm still
working on my technique, and this was only my 3rd U.G., so I know my style
is a little rough around the edges.  But stay tuned, because I've got a
master plan to make the whole world wiggle!

By the way, you can get more jungle info on my DJ page:

It's a rad space, and I (along with many of my friends) have great memories
from
earlier parties thrown here. And it would totally suck to lose this space.
What
the scene in SF doesn't need is more spaces becoming unavailable because
people
can't respect them.

Yeah, and at Warmth, they even put an air filter down there. That was

YAY!!!  Finally a party within walking distance to my house!!  Which means
I will ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY be there!  Interesting space--usually reggae
or latin beats.  Tried to go there once, but got refused entrance due to
being underdressed.  Had to laugh!  It will be nice to see something
lighter at this place.  Oh yeah, it's right near bart, did you mention

It offers just one explanation, the other is price.  Designer drugs are
expensive and thus out of reach for most people with limited amounts of
money (the reason why crack does well in poor hoods is due to it's
relatively cheap price $5/hit o rock).

As for the semantics,please tell me what you consider a designer drug to
be.  Better yet, let's all find a good definition and start from there.  To
me, if it does not occur naturally, it's designer.  So THC, Fungus,
Tobacco, and alcohol (a by prodcut of fermentation), are IMO non-designer,
IMO natural.  MDMA, Cocaine Hydrochloride, LSD, are all designer drugs.  If
we can;t agree on a term, why not synthetic?  There we go!

LSD can be cheap, but I think you might have something about certain drugs
do not provide the kind of escape people are looking for.  I also feel that
there is a distinct "danger" signal that is set off when such drugs are
intro'ed into a community.  LSD is seen as one drug that will mess you up
permanently, same with heroin, and all the other drugs that have initials.
Perception is everything when it comes to selling.

Okay instead of trying to see the whole "forest" on the topic of cloning
(which I think is beyond our ability to comprehend). Let's just look at
one tree.

I have a disability called ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), which is
genetically transferred. It's not a disability like being in a
wheelchair or being blind where one can see the disorder. For visually,
it's invisible to those around you. Your behavior is where the problem
is: Forgetfulness, constantly late, disorganized, unable to concentrate
on tedious tasks, ect. Yet there are many advantages to having ADD.
People with ADD are often more creative, have more energy, and are
better in high pressure situations. Example, many race car drivers have
ADD, so do many emergency room doctors. Many famous people throughout
history are believed to have had ADD like Mozart, Ben Franklin,
Leonardo, ect. And I'll bet many of the most creative Party Production
groups, DJs, and other contributors to our scence also owe their
creativeness to having ADD.

Now let's say that through discoveries made through cloning technology,
it were possible for someone like me to be able to ensure that my
son/daughter when born, did not have ADD. I tell you now that If I
could, I'd do it in a second. To live with ADD is hell. Yes I many be
more creative than the average Joe but I'd trade that in a second to not
be late for  every date, or to never again misplace important papers in
my house, or to never again become so frustrated on a test at school
that I must leave to room and go punch the bathroom wall over and over,
or to never again realize that I've been daydreaming and that I missed
my freeway exit about 20 miles back.

But I can also see reasons for not messing with this natural process. If
I were to be able to rid my kin of ADD, then many others would too.
Think for a second the implications of such a change in our genetic
pool. There would be fewer creative minds, fewer pioneers of new and
progressive thought, fewer new ideas would come about because of the
change in the populace. And while such an operation would probably be
available only to the wealthy, those unable to have the operation done
on their kin would be burdened with a world that becomes less and less
tolerable to people with the disorder.

Ok. Sorry this was so long. Any thoughts?

  two things...
one - just because an idea is stupid, doesn't mean people will avoid it.  
Especially with regard to ensuring genetic diversity.  Witness americas 
corn crops: 99+% are identical.  We're basically asking for trouble.

two - the sheep experiment was done *I believe* for cloning sheep that 
carry special recombinant DNA used for medicine.  This is the only way 
the process can be cost effective (those sheep are worth a fortune for 
their milk) and also the only way it can save any effort (inserting the 
DNA to code for the medicine is hard).

so mr. fussbucket...

the budget for dewey cheatem and howe is shrinking rapidly this year, 
what do you suppose we do?

as the rising sun mixed in sync with the cars piling into downtown san 
francisco...perfectly beatmatched..., mrs. howe  waited expectationally, 
cherry donut in one hand, double mocha latte in the other, powdered sugar 
flaking off her mouth, for an answer.  

mr. fussbucket, who hadn't eaten all weekend, and was showing signs of 
scurvy from general malnutrition (and lack of fresh fruit)...took a gulp 
of tap water...and thought.  

"hmm...lemme look through my little phony book...say here we go?"

"who?"

"no, they had their final concert about 10 years ago.  no, there was this 
guy...he like played athat 420 song."

"Slider and Duke?"

"No, you fussbucket!  Everyone knows Slider and Duke are busy littering 
the universe with old beer bottles and empty party balls.  Im talking 
about Boomerang Fidget!  He's the next macgyver!  that boy can fix anything!"

"well give him a call, maybe he can help our delapidated organization 
from falling into the pits."

FYI-

I've been known to go out dancing with a group of some very good women
friends.  We go out solely to be with one another, dance, drink and have
fun.  Since they aren't the techno types, but still happen to be my
friends we usually end up dancing to hip/hop or funk.  Although I might
prefer dancing to something else, I like the company of my friends and I
like to try dancing to a wide variety of music.

We usually dance in one big group and ignore everyone else (club
atmosphere) because our purpose is to be with one another and have a good
time.  There is a different dynamic with an all-women group then in a
mixed group (not better, just different).  We aren't interested in being
picked up, we aren't interested in acting like lesbians.  We just ARE!
I've noticed men looking at us when we dance together, but we try and
ignore them.  I've often noticed it is one's own perception that clouds
one's view.  We would act the very same way, in fact do, in our own living
room.

As a group of women we find a bit more freedom to express sexuality via
dance than we would ever express in a mixed group because we aren't
worrying about what happens if we turn someone on (read: predator/prey).
It's hard to repress something that is a pivotal force of nature.
Besides, I don't find dance and sexuality mutually exclusive.  Even erotic
dancing can be an art form. And none of us are doing this to act crazy,
we basically want to dance unemcumbered with one another i.e. our
friends. I would like to point out that women don't worry so
much about being labeled as gay and often express more affection towards
one another than men.  So, you may be mis-representing what you see.

I just wanted to give you a perspective you may have missed.  I do
understand where you are coming from and don't find your comments way off
in a certain sense. But it sometimes seems to me that judging anyone for
anything is a double-edged sword.

        A few years ago there was a bill board near my house
        that said "Annheiser-Busch Reminds You to Drink 
        Responsibly"  (this was at Xmas time).  Someone
        thereupon whited out the word "Responsibly".  That
        totally cracked me up!
 
        Right after I had moved to SF about 11 years ago, there
        was a billboard at Army and Mission that had a photo of
        a slender (emaciated) model holding a cup of Dannon 
        yogurt.  The large block letters above her said "Skinny
        Dip".  A few weeks later someone plastered a HUGE banner
        across the billboard reading "Fat Women are Powerful!".
        Again, I was in paroxysms of mirth!

Ok I know it's early BUT....

Us crazy kidz @ RAS want form a SF party to head on down to DUNE 
III...  Anakin will be at the helm of an 8-10 passenger van, playin 
mixtapes of whoever we want to hear...  The van will be 420-friendly 
possibly embarking on the 4th and re-entering the SF solar system on 
the 6th...

What we need 13 (lucky number, eh?) brave (and friendly) souls with at 
least 30$ each (10$ for admission, 20$ for rental of the van and gas)
So far I have about 4down (including myself) so I guess 9 more??? 
 Please, we're looking for some nil-flake-ability factor and possibly 
be safe and bring some x-tra dough for food, and whatever needs you 
wish... Ehh, if you want you can rent a room, myself- I'll sleep in 
the van, man....

If we get more people interested then, hey!  Maybe we can rent another
van...

So, any takers?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hey all,
remember back in November when I asked many of you for your insights
into why you rave for that research I was doing?? Didn't think so...and
that is why I am mentioning it again. The paper is finished...some
SFRavers got copies sent to em. I lost a few addresses and forgot to
send some of you a copy, too. Sorry...:(
The paper is now posted on 303. Its a cool website that was made by
ravers for ravers...its in its early stages and the peeps doing it are
looking for input, art, stories.....anything RR. So check it out at:
http://www.vibe.org
I am not affiliated with it..just a contributor. My paper...(which some
of you are quoted in!) is in the "articles" section. Enjoy. I'd love to
hear comments and impressions from you all but please don't burn me into
next year if you don't like it or find it misrepresenting of the scene
as you see it. You all know how multi-faceted and complex the
underground scene is. This paper was for a class I was in in college
"Drugs in U.S Society" (very cool class, I might add) My intent was to
shed some light on the connection between raving and Ecstacy. It was
only supposed to be a 10 page assignment. I had close to 30 written.
(Had to remove many pages of personal accounts and an entire section on
the spirituality of raving and the various interpretations of levels of
conciousness and of collective energy and so on....) 
Anyhoo....I sent this paper out to people last winter when there was
alot of negativity and bs floating about SFR. It can serve as a positive
reminder of why we rave and why each and every one of us loves being a
part of the scene in our individual way. (not meaning to put words into
your mouths, though)
PLUR...

        Why don't people ever figure that every other person in the world is
basically equal to them.
        Do you think that that cop driving bye while you and your friends
are sitting in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere figures that you're
just a parked car? Or do you think that he has thought of the thought of
sitting in a parking lot with all of his friends and doing what you were
doing. . . 

        Or, do you think that you were the only sole living being on this
earth who had this great, super-special idea of whatever?

        Do you realize that the worlds lives are going on without you,
changing, making decisions, and basically doing everything that you could
do, while you were not present.

        Do you forget your friends after a long time without contact, and
never again think of them or what they may be doing. . . Or do you try to
re-attain your knowingness of that person and their lives.

        Do you sit at home, in your room, alone. . . and think of the rest
of the world, how it's changing around you? Or do you sit alone, in your
room, encompassed by your television, and that tv show, ignorant of the
world, your life, and your friends. . . 

        Are your friends the world to you? Are your family members your
life-blood? Can you live without them? Or is your live engorged in them,
waiting for any moment to spawn up and fulfill the needs and voids in the
people around you?

        Do you know who you are? Why you do what you do? Do you know the
reasons for your actions? Do you know the consequences? Are you more aware
of yourself, or others?


Just being thoughtfull. . . how silly of me. . . 


Love ya guys, even though most probably have no clue who I am.

Aryck

'you need four hugs a day for survival, eight for maintenance and twelve for
growth'        (found in the 'Online' section of The Guardian,  March 6, 1997)

hello from england to all sfravers.

we have been listening in on your conversations and enjoying your happy
vibes for the last week now ( i've been itching to contribute to your
diversity debate or the clone/soul debate) and  i think it is time  to
introduce ourselves.

my boyfriend (ben) and i (iris) live in the UK's infamous satellite town
Milton Keynes with (allegedly) one of the best rave venues in the country
and access to some great illegal raves (we would love to tell you about
EXODUS some time). we are mainly into happy hardcore (mainly four:four beat)
and techno, not so much into jungle, but open to anything where people are
happy and unconstipated (let me just look that word up...)

we are planning a trip to the states from the end of may to july or august
or until our money runs out. we want to concentrate on san francisco and
also visit the southwest. the problem is that trailing after a group of
tourist through chinatown or wandering around with a tourist guide book in
our hands is not our idea of fun. there is no point in visiting another
country if you don't get to meet interesting people and experience the
underground culture as opposed to mainstream culture which is what you
usually get as a tourist.

after searching the net for several nights for any non-touristy underground
culture stuff i came across sfrave and after reading your letters for a week
we  know now that san fransisco can be as exciting as we hoped.

so, ... here's our request (forgive us for being so straight forward right
away):
is anybody willing to help us explore the alternative san fransisco? can
anyone recommend cool places to go to, to see, to hang out at, to dance at,
the stuff that is not in the tourist guides. would someone like to take us
to their  favorite parties and...can someone point me to a public computer
terminal, so that i can check my mail and don't die of withdrawal?  :-)

since  we would like to hang out in sf for a little while and we haven't got
much money for hotels we were wondering if anybody would be willing to put
up some fellow ravers or recommend a cheap place to stay at or maybe we
could pitch our tent in someone's back garden.
we are no scroungers and we would not take advantage of anyone. in fact...we
are moving to manchester this fall and i have noticed an interest in the
manchester scene amongst some of you. so, if any of you ever happen to get
to manchester, england, you'd be very welcome to stay at our place. we'll be
there for at least three years.

sorry for this long posting. i would actually like to say much much more but
i don't want to stretch your patience. and i hope we haven't broken any
sfrave rules....you guys are sooo nice to each other! i feel like i have to
tread carefully. but i haven't been this excited in ages. sorry, _we_
haven't been this excited in ages.

iris
p.s. what does PLUR stand for? we've got an idea, but ...
...there's more...

hey, my name is ben.  i'm from milton keynes a small city  near london england  
we have a large warehouse here called the sanctury  it bangs out top notch
raves but has become pretty commercial in the past few years thou it still
has a wicked crowd  we also have undereground do's every couple of weeks
called  exodus. has any one had experience of the english rave scene and how
does it compare to yours 
we will be moving to manchester soon to go to university  glad to swap
addresses with people who would like to check out the english rave scene
think of it as a kind of cultural exchange
i've been reading the mail list for a week now and it sounds like the happy
vibe has spread around the planet. of couse i'm a firm believer it started
in england thou i am open persuasion from people who are amazed at this.
 the summer of love late 80s, acid house, 100k rigs on the M1 is my earliest
record of happy dance parties  or has the music developed simultaneously all
over the wolrd as the technology that helps create it appeared?
cheers
ben

Once upon a time there was a little elf (about 6.04 cm tall).  While
wandering through his town (a rock and roll store) one day he noticed a few
discarded pieces of equipment collecting dust.  He decided that they would
make a great place to turn into a party pad.  After lavishly decorating the
insides of his new home (known to humans as a 303) with trippy posters, elf
art, and Lucky Charms boxes  he called up his elf buddies to throw a party.
One elf brought butterfly snacks as party favours which made all the other
elves really happy (e.g. see elf on front of Lucky Charms box.)  However,
one elf had eaten too many butterflies and tripped over a circuit in the
floor and fell against a switch on the wall causing the 303-pad to jump
into action with crazy twisted sounds.  Frightened, he look up expecting to
be scolded for his carelessness but to his suprise the other elves were
grooving to the sound.  One of the really bright elves (T.K. Noah) had the
sudden inspiration to run outside to the next door and climb into what we
call a 909 (but of course to a 6.04cm elf it was big enough to get lost
in.)  After a few minutes he figured out how to turn it on as well and the
ears of the partygoing elves perked up in amazement.  Quickly running to
the next machine down the road he blew the dust off the cover of something
called an 808,  then sneezed, and crawled inside.  Not much later, he had
this one up and running too and to his suprise he had the grooves all in
synch.  By this time the party was full blown and elves from all over the
store were showing up and dancing to this new incredible sound.  The elves
continued to throw these parties...each time figuring out new and exciting
ways to make their party pad sound even better.  Years past and elves all
over the world had heard the secret and were throwing parties in their own
town while adding their own special touches.  Eventually, the elves decided
to share their secret with a few special humans whom they knew shared a
love for music and unity.  And thus the true story of how techno came to be
was passed down along with this wonderful music and everything we associate
with it.

The end.





Many Thanx to the crew at New Hope for a fantastic beach party...it seems
my brain has finally thawed.  :)

Even though LSD was syntehsized by Albert Hoffman it does occur naturally 
in the ergot fungus, which grows on wheat.  So it is still naturally 
occuring even though it is usually synthesized, ust as psilocybin can 
be made in the lab but of course is found in mushrooms as well.  Cocaine 
is refined from the coca plant, so even though there is quite a bit of 
processing involved it is still a derivative of a natural substance, as 
is heroin from the opium poppy.

The only drugs I would call designer drugs are those whose chemical 
structures never occur naturally.  I don't think that making concentrates 
of a natural substance or simulations of one can be considered a designer 
drug.  At least that's my understanding of the general definition, that a 
designer drug is one whose molecular structure has, in a sense, been 
"designed" rather than copied.

I don't believe in alot of things myself.

 But I do think there is a possibility that the SOUL does exist.
I think that, maybe, once our chemicals break down, or are no longer
functioning, that; the electrical interactions some how, at almost the
speed of light, learn to live-on, elsewhere in the cosmic void.

Ffrom what I remember of their first two parties, their decorations were
pretty minimal.  It seems intentional because the flyers are pretty minimal
in themselves.

first of all, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide-25) does _not_ occur in
nature.  ergot contains a related compound, named simply lysergic acid (i
don't remember whether it's also psychoactive), but it is not quite the
same stuff.


the term "designer drug" has been used in the medical community to denote
drugs that were created by making slight alterations to existing substances
-- MDMA from MDA, ALD from LSD, crack from cocaine-- usually with the
intent to avoid legal ramifications, though any such loopholes are
generally closed quickly. (1)

in common parlance i've come to understand it to mean drugs that are not
(and have generally not been) produced by mainstream pharmaceutical
companies and which are limited in their exposure, even within the drug
culture.

thus, MDMA is a designer drug by the first definition, but not by the second.

LSD has never to my knowledge been considered a designer drug, because it
was developed at a pharmaceutical company and used psychiatrically for
years.

this information is based on a limited number of sources so if you have a
reference which either clarifies or refutes what i've just said, please let
me know.

To me, not at all.  Depends on your viewpoint.

It would have whatever every other human has.  I don't believe in "souls"
myself but that doesn't matter.

This, of course, assumes that human cloning works.  Unfortunately we'll
probably never know because given the firestorm of BS surrounding it, no
one will ever admit to success.

No.  Think of it as an identical twin born later in time.

You would be two different people with the same genetic makeup.  Just like
identical twins.  See above.

Both.

My advice: stop stressing about it.  Having known a set or two of twins,
they become very annoyed if you assume they are mentally identical.  I was
childhood friends with one but not his twin -- not like they were polar
opposites, they just had different lives.  And they both had the exact same
upbringing...imagine if it were inevitably different, as it would be with a
clone.

  according to e for ecstasy, considering MDMA a designer immitation of 
MDA is incorrect.  Not just because of when and why it was first created, 
but also because of the extent of the differences.
  Also, I believe due to the Analogue Substances Act, the loopholes are 
closed automatically in most cases.

  To me, the idea of cloning is not disturbing.  I look at the paranoia 
of many and think of when people used to burn down the first telegraph 
stations out of fear.
  But the problem with western society possessing these tools is that it 
doesn not have an exceptional track record for utilizing technology to 
benefit the masses, and we, as a society, have not yet reached to simple 
goal of recognizing that everyone is equal.  As a result, if cloning of 
humans ever does take place, it will almost surely have something
 *other* than the best interests of mankind in mind (a rhyme, sorry).  If 
being cloned is desirable, who will be cloned?  The rich WASPS, I'd be 
willing to wager.  Is this just going to compound the division between 
classes?  How can technology cause problems for us?  Simply because our 
society is convinced that it knows what is best.  It makes value 
judgements it should not.

Dear Ravefriends,

        As I mentioned some time ago, I've been trying to set up a chance
for us to meet and talk about the issue of how the authorities suppress
raves through busts, permit requirements, police hassles, etc., and see
what action we can take.  Here it is:


        WHEN:   This Wednesday, March 12, 730pm
        WHERE:  Freedom's Forum Bookstore, 1800 Market Street @ Octavia
        WHY:    Because we have the right to dance and listen to music


        This topic is on the agenda as part of the monthly San Francisco
Libertarian Party meeting.  I'm hoping we'll produce a good turnout to show
the party that ravers have a just grievance and are serious about doing
something about it.

        It's easy for us to talk about this on our lists, a bit harder to
actually take the time and effort to do something political offline, but I
think we are up to it.

        Several people have told me they want to come, and I hope to see as
many of you there as possible.  If enough of us get mobilized on this, I
think we can succeed in getting the laws changed.  At the very least we can
make them aware that there is a public relations cost to pay for trampling
on our rights.

        I would especially encourage anyone who has legal or other
expertise, or hard data on things like cost and availability of permits,
how laws and enforcement vary from place to place, and so on, to show up
and share your knowledge for the good of the scene.

        If you know of anyone not on SFRAVES who might be interested,
please pass the info along to them.  If you or someone you know would like
to be there but need a ride, give me a call and I'll see what I can do.

May the bass be with us,
                                        <<< Starchild >>>

Does this belief of yours help to explain anything, or is it just a
convenient label to put on something you have no comprehension of whatsoever?

"God is just another word meaning 'I don't know.'"  -someone I forgot

This is a common mis-perception: the light does not become what we _want_
it to be, it acts like _one or the other_ based on our perception.  The
light beam won't turn into, say, a hippopotamus, just because we want it to
-- or for any other reason we have yet discovered.  We can affect the
outcome by our perception, but the array of possible outcomes is not
unlimited.

Who cares if it's 'mechanistic' or not?  What's interesting is how it
works, and if 'how' involves subjective perception (which I wholly
believe), why does that imply this vague realm of spirituality?

I think people tend to take the wrong view of all this.  Instead of
constantly trying to justify how humans are special, and then feeling
guilty because we don't measure up to God or some other platonic ideal of
ourselves ("souls", "energy beings", "privileged by reason", etc.), I
prefer to look at it the other way: isn't it amazing what animals can do
with opposable thumbs, linear thought, and hive mentality?  And instead of
feeling guilty about our shortcomings as humans, perhaps we should just get
down to the hard work of addressing them.

"Cruel" and "insignificant" are value judgments you place upon the world,
as are "warmer" and "more friendly".  Reality is what it is; you can call
it what you like.

Personally, I find "Is it useful?" much more interesting than "Is it true?"

	**--LOCATION--**
	U.C. Santa Cruz campus, College Eight Dinning Facility
	Take all freeways from the BayArea to Highway 17 South
	Go over the SantaCruz mountains and take Highway 1 North Exit
	Go straight at 1st light, make RIGHT at 2nd light (Mission St.)
	Go straight through 3 lights, make a RIGHT on the 4th (Bay St.)
	Go through 2 lights. You'll see a big barn on the left corner
	Park in the lot by the barn! Thats the base of the campus...

	Now cross the street to the shuttle/bus stop and catch the
	shuttle (preferably a "Night Perimeter" shuttle its free)
	And ride it all the way around campus to COLLEGE EIGHT!

	Get off, cross the street (going downhill) and go down a big
	flight of stairs and the party's on your immediate right!

	**--PS--**
	You gotta park off campus in the barn lot and take the shuttle 
	because without a parking permit you cant get on campus through
	the gaurd gates after 8pm, if you come before 8 you can come in
	park at College Eight and not worry about shuttle riding and
	getting to your car later! We'll be around to help people finding
	their way and getting to their cars, ill give ya a ride! ;)


	HOPE to See tons of you guys out here on Friday :) :) :)

I think cloning is cool.  I want to be cloned.  I'll raise myself and do
all the stuff I like with me.  And then, once I've grown up (again), I can
spin a set and dance to it at the same time!

And and and
I can be at a party in SF and LA at the same time!

This was the first that I've felt since being here, and I'm a little
scared I'll have to admit.  I'm sitting here waiting for more, wondering
what piece of gear to grab so it doesn't get smashed--of course it'd have
to be the TB303... ;)

WARNING:
The following is long, rambling and has nothing to do with raves.
Don't read unless you're interested in mental disorders and cloning.


>I have a disability called ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), which is

....

>Yes I many be more creative than the average Joe but I'd trade that in a

I have something of the reverse problem.  It's called OCD,
obsessive-compulsive disorder.  It means that I will essentially get "stuck"
on everything I do.  I can't let go and am often focused on the last class,
previous sentence, or that last beautiful idea or pattern.  I go into long
"blank" states where my eyes glaze over and a minute or an hour passes.
 Often times I feel like my mind is moving through mud, or I'm in a
hypnotic/trance state.  I go through repetitive all night long cleaning
behaviors, get stuck with thoughts that repeat so forcefully and continually
that I feel like my mind is breaking.  (Acid can exacerbate this and put me
into panic-striken time and visual loops.  E and stimulants give me a
refreshing break from the tired obsessions)

Anyway, as with ADD, all things are not bad with this strange disorder.  My
ability to focus and my patience are often phenomenal.  Repetitive tasks and
music attract me and I can see patterns and beauty that many cannot for their
lack of focus.  I regularly go into beautiful hypnotic states that many take
drugs to achieve.  I can "surround" and exhaust ideas in amazing ways.  I can
accomplish things despite endless failures.  But like you, I would trade it
in a moment just to be normal.

I don't think we should genetically create people so there is no possibility
of "error," but I think we should have genetic relief for those who want it.
 Cloning sounds senseless to me, but sending a therapeutic virus in to change
the genes in the cells could be helpful.  I think the possibilities are
exciting.


Much love,

  - Justin

I remember my first earthquake. I was lying in bed, and then I felt
sort of weird; kind of like my bed had moved a little bit, but I
couldn't figure out why (nothing fun was happening at the time, I
promise). 

I kind of liked the feeling, actually. Since then, I've become
slightly addicted to it, to the point that I relish the thought of
something slightly larger... It just seems like that ultimate
amusement park ride. Except you don't have to leave your own home!

The thrill of life is gone without ever-looming thrill of being near
death... Earthquakes remind me of that. They also remind me of how
foolish we are to build huge structures and dwell in them. They remind
me of how much more powerful nature is that it can destroy us all in a
blink of an eye.

That, to me, is fascinating. We concern ourselves with the minute
details of the environmental impacts of plastic vs. paper, what brand
of gas is better, etc. We worry that we have conquered our
environment; we think we are slowly destroying the earth, and then...

*whammo!*

8.4 comes along; destroys cities; burns down houses; years of human
efforts, down the drain in the matter of 90 seconds. Nature comes
and puts us in our place.

Nature always wins. I like that.
Nature is cool. :)
I am rambling.

I personally see flyers as invitations rather than as a promotional 
tool.  Yes it's gets the word out that you are having a party but it 
needs to be inviting and represent the ideals of the promoter.  When 
people pass out flyers as if they were just paper I take them as just 
that... another peice of paper.  (Side note on this:  I was at a sunset 
and talking with some cool people and a girl came up who knew the people 
I was conversing with.  After intros and basic conversation she asked if 
i was interseted in going to "Beautyful People" and here's a flyer.  The 
flyer was simple b/w and effective but the presentation caught my 
attention more than anything.)

      Now that I'm starting to throw parties with friends here we have 
discussed this over many times.  I don't believe that if the flyer is 
multy colored or bigger than your pocket size the party is going to be 
bad.  Just represent your self with the art work you put on it, the 
colors, the design, the presentation, and the affermation that you want 
to put on a quality event with a bunch of great people.

For MASS we had our flyers done at MONOCHROME in LA.  We happen to know a 
few of the people that work there and through our connextions we got 
glossy, full color flyers for a great price.  However they f@#ked up our 
order (I would not recomend these guys in the future unless you to are 
getting a great deal) and we got our flyers a week late and many were 
printed bad.  For our next party we still will get our flyers from them 
only because they agreed to "give" tem to us for next to nothing because 
they messed up the first order.  

    I like simplisity, creativity, and remember they are there to invite 
a partier to your party because you have something to offer them to have 
a good time.

Rave flyer history:  I got a book for x-mas from Tower Records that went 
over briefly the hisory of flyers in England and had many examples of 
good flyer art work.  I can't remember the name but it's silver/grey and 
says raveclubpartyflyers or something like it on the front.

Hope that helps...


PLUR,

       Austin

Ergot has tremendously potent hallucinogenic effects, in addition to
causing severe nausea and fevers.  The sickness is called Saint Anthony's
fire.  Ergot poisoning precipitated the visions experienced by victims of
so called witchcraft in Salem in the 18th century.

Many innocent people lost their lives at the gallows as a result of the
misguided suspicions caused by this disease. 

weird stuff.

 My apologies to SFraves and most especially Paul for my last piece of 
garbage I sent out.

 I'm really sorry and don't even know why I acted like such a jerk (isn't 
_that_ reassuring).

 Anybody got some catchup.

WARNING:
This is very long and metaphysical
--------------------------------------------------


>This is a common mis-perception: the light does not become what we _want_
>it to be, it acts like _one or the other_ based on our perception.  The
>light beam won't turn into, say, a hippopotamus, just because we want it to

How the light acts is a part of what it is.  Our minds require the light to
have so much energy at some particular point in time.  Reality is larger,
yes, a probability equation.
Our perception reveals different facets of a fundementally unknowable
universe.
And yet reality is also undefined by those measures of reality which connect
with a human being, until a human being looks at reality.  Does the tree make
any noise if it falls and there is no one to hear it?  Part of the definition
of noise is "that which can be heard."

I agree that what is "useful" is more interesting than what is "true."  What
is true, I will never know.

Is it irrelevant debating whether people are essentially good at heart or
not?  Does it make sense to question whether humanity is spiritual or not?
 Do we ask if there is a soul or not?  Maybe the question is unimportant

The question is what reality is most useful?  Which reality is healthiest?
 What belief system will create the world that we most want to live in?

I hear about the man who cured himself of cancer by watching endless funny
videos.  I think about the open-heart surgeries performed in China with
nothing but accupuncture.  Belief is fully half of medicine.  Sugar pills
work wonders.  (I wonder how many kids have gotten very real E highs from
very fake stuff.)

The mind is powerful and can produce amazing realities both through
perception and through action.  What reality is most useful?  What world do I
want to wake up to tomorrow?  I want to wake up to a world where I can make a
difference, where people care, where there's a reason for all things.  I want
to look at things and smile.  Filling up with positive energy makes the human
psyche run smoother and more powerfully.  This is my comprehension of the
spiritual.

Conceptions of God, spirituality, etc. become irrelevant.  I believe in them
and I don't.  All things are true and untrue.  Reality will always be larger
than I am and so I will believe and I will not believe.

Hmm.  The universe is large.  We are small.  We look at the sky and imagine
the vastness.  I look at the city of San Francisco from the hills and I see
lights that go on forever.

But I don't feel small.  I am so much a part of myself and so content to be
where I am that I feel large.

I feel I am that city because I love that city.  Yet my conception of myself
is that I am nothing because all my substance comes from outside of me.  All
my inspiration comes from a thousand places that aren't mine.  Yet I am
everything because all those things outside of me enter me, the air, food,
the love and the art.  They reside in me.  I love them.  And they exit once
again in a thousand pieces.

I let go of my ego-attachment to my own inspirations and ideas.  I let them
go to live or to die.  I feel most content when everything is a part of me
and I am a part of all things.

I don't feel guilty, because I love myself.  I don't feel proud because I own
nothing, not even my soul.  And yet my soul is everywhere and I own all
things that I love and I do own my soul.

So do I need to justify my own significance in the face of the vast emptiness
of the universe.  Do I need to believe in something spiritual, such as God,
to conquer that fear of being alone in the universe?

No.  It's the tao of opposites.  It's a koan.  And I am content with things
being large and small, true and untrue, fearful and loving, right and wrong.
 I know that God does not exist because I do not know or love God.  (And I
know of a reality where he does not exist.)  And yet I know that God exists
because I do love and know God.  (And I know of a reality where he does
exist.)


Peace,

 - Justin

Yup, I remember my first earthquake too...
I was 15 and she was 21...

j/k =o)

Actually, i have never been in an earthquake that i have really felt.
I've always wanted to be in a minor one that will shake a room and do no
damage, but God's too busy flooding stuff right now. Maybe next season.

Hey friends,

I am an avid David Lynch freak and vidied his newest flick last night in
Orinda. It was really good, but definately a David Lynch movie. The two
people I went with thought it was pretty shitty, but I think you have to
be in the correct mind set for one of his movies (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet,
Wild at Heart..). It stared Patricia Arguette, Bill Pullman and Baldazar
Getty... it was trippy and really funny if you have a twisted sense of
humor like myself.

Definately worth seeing if you're interested in experiencing something
new.

just a little info on David lynch. They wanted him to direct Star Wars but
he declined because he was working on his first film, Eraserhead.

Who's going to see any of the Space Children shows this weekend? I'm not
sure which night I'm going. I think I'm going on Friday to see Union Jack.
$15 aint bad.

Wow, these business degrees really help when it comes to expenses:

Quite simple:

Van rental_ Approx. 50$/day (150$)

Gas (@ 1.35$/gal with 20 gall tank) 27$.
Refuled @ least four times (out to LA, from LA to the desert, back 
from the desert to SF and around the bay dropping off people) so now 
its looking around 108$.

So, yep I guess your looking @ 260$ -300$  (I'm covering what costs 
incurred after the initial 260).   The 13 people thang is a bit too 
much so I'm looking to see if I can get a van for maybe 40$ or less 
(but even that would bring the people limit only to 11 or 12)...

I might be interested in this if I decide to go but dont want to 
commit
until I know for sure.

BTW: how are you going to get 13 ppl + driver in a 8-10 person van?
I dont know how much a rental van cost, but couldnt we get it for 
less
than $260 ?

I've been collecting flyers since early 1994 (even a few from 93) for the 
great artwork and memorbelia purposes. I think to myself how precious 
they will be to me 20 years down the road when I look back to my rave 
days in the 90s.  Hell, I hope to STILL be raving in some form 20 years 
from now!  On some flyers of the parties I actually attend, I attatch a 
note to it describing my evening, so it is like a rave diary of sorts. 

I don't use flyers for information like I used to.  I always use sfraves 
word of mouth to decide what rave I want to attend. 

love to all,

I just saw that move too, sure was a long movie, only liked the
ascending (assending?)  the stair case scene :) I do like the acting
style where you have to watch their lips for seemingly hours before
you get any sound.

I hate it when they say "playing live" and they just stand around
bored with nothing to do but listen to themselves.

For you gear-heads out there, here's what equipment they used: 

Guy on left: ADAT,Yamaha 02R mixer. 
Guy on right: two turntables, DJ mixer, Roland DJ-70. 

The guy on the left ( sorry I don't know there names) just played
STEREO outputs of the ADAT through the 02R. He brought up effects on
the the tape output. THAT'S IT. You can't imagine how sick I felt
seeing an 02R used as soley an effects send! You'd think that with
such little to do he'd at least dance, smile, or at least scratch his
balls or something.

The guy on the right (stage right) spun records some and played some
ugly keyboard parts on the DJ-70 that didn't really seem to fit in.

I guess that's better then lip syncing, and more equipment would mean
more of those heavy voltage transformers, but people should know what
they're getting.

I was trying to listen to that distortion carefully, and it seemed to
me that the group actually used alot of distored samples on their
tape. They had their own sub-woffers, and I thought the bass was
clean. I think this band is going for the crossover industrial/rock to
d&b market. They sound more like MeatBeatManifesto to me that
d&b. Most of their double speed beats were rock beats instead of funk
beats, which cramped my dancing style. By the way, the rec'd companies
are chopping at the bit at crossover bands like this.

There was an acticle in Pulse, the Tower records advertisment as
well. The crowd at Bimbo's always looks like the FM radio free pass
crowd to me. I like the appearence of the club alot, the napkins are
great, reminds me of my yacht club days, but the light's up at 1:30
deal really gets my goat. I really liked DJ Noel's short set after the
show better then SHJ. Wished I could'a danced a few more hours :)

I don't think this is marketing to ravers. I think this is happening
because musicians who do sound for commercials and other mainstream
stuff are getting into electronic music. Instead of it being the
advertising agency selling techno/jungle with their campain package,
they hire a musician to do the sound, that person is doing
techno/jungle on other projects, and so more easily does techno/jungle
on this commercial as well. I'll bet the advertising agency doesn't
know what the hell kinda music it is. They just think it sounds new.

does anyone remember a couple month's ago when the "R" in the "Port of
San Francisco" sign blew out?  I was driving to work at 5 in the morning
dead tired and saw the sign from the bridge.  Something about seeing a
huge red neon sign that says "Pot of San Francisco" made me laugh all
day!

Peace & Much Love,
christine

 i wasn't sure whether to mail this to the list or not since it started out
as a personal reply but turned into a message to everyone at the end. i
don't know how much of your conversations are conducted in private. if i
start getting on people's nerves let me know.

>you! =) MODA
>
>

thanks for the quick reply
yes, i believe be will be in town by then
what do you mean you'll call us. telephone? from america? i thought the idea
of email was to cut down the phone bill. why would anybody want to use a
phone these days? hey but if you have that much money to spare, it would be
great to talk to you.
our number is 01908-227143
but from the states it's: 011-44-1908-227143  (i think)
and after the 15th of april we're more likely to be at this number: 313669

have you been to MK? i guess you know about the concrete cows...    MK had
its 30th birthday a few weeks ago. i hate it and i love it and i'm terribly
bored with it. i always liked the layout. very american (i spent the best
year of my life in minneapolis and feel quite nostalgic sometimes). it
failed terribly in regard to community builing, though. it had the highest
suicide rate in the country for a while. i have to get out of here.....aaaah!
i never made it out west during that whole year in mpls. and i always wanted
to see  snow in the desert in arizona (well, wrong season for that). and san
francisco is just one of the places you have to visit in your life. like
berlin when the wall was still up. evreybody who missed that...well...you
missed it! it was really cool.
 i've been really high on adrenalin for the last few days now (best drug of
all. like being in love. that's what the rave scene is all about.) and all
thanks to you sfravers.it all seems to be coming together now.  thanks to
everybody who's replied so far (have to check my mail again in a minute). it
would be great to meet some of you in person. we'll stay in contact. we'll
be reading the list.

I would have to agree with Matthew.

  I love them earth quakes to.. Sure they can be tragic. But I think it is
health for us little creatures to get shookin up once in awhile..

 But here in the Bay.. It is very wise to have you house laid out in an
earth quake proof fasion..  Don't put a 50 pound speaker above your
computer for instance. Or like, don't sleep below a bed room that has a
water bed in it.

Ok..  Back to work.

MMM Well I happen to be reading this for an essay in "dub mix- the mix 
eventually contained only the bare dance rythums and base line of the 
original recording.  "Sounds familliar?)

The Story so far I have (Which I will post more when I finish..) Is the 
advent of electronic equiptment like the sampler and multi track 
recording, and African drum beats influencing western music, starting 
from slavery time..... up to now.... and the dub 
mix, and hip hops "borrowing materials and remixing it" and all of that 
put together kind abecame what we see as techno.

mm What about Brian Eno's soundscape stuff where he believed they should 
make music that would fit into the back ground of things? Like sounds 
that would go with focks and knifes clincking....Ambient...So he sampled 
all this stuff and put it in....

There actually was a drug (methylaminorex) going around under the name
Euphoria (often written, for no reason I can fathom, "U4eUH") for a while.
It had a brief vogue a couple of years ago, seems to have disappeared now.
Notorious for, supposedly, creating bad experiences in combination with
LSD.

panthas and crack in inner cities in LA. while all the cutsie hippies at

I've posted about this before, but let's not forget the giant, 
fluorescent red "E" that towers all by itself above Emeryville.  A funny

Ubiquitous seems to be just one more data point on the "raving's going to
hell" timeline...

I just feel sorry for the non-Internet connected people in the rave
community that won't know better and may actually go.

For the entire diatribe, see the SFR 11/96 archive file at
http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/sf/archives/sfr.9611

Here's a little tidbit to refresh your memory...

 Too bad we don't have the names of the folks in "CR Power" - it's easy
to change organizational names and keep the same bunch of scamsters...

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I've been reading all the postings on UBIQUITOUS and you know the good old
saying "if it's too good to be true, than it probably is" here is one
example where those one of those unwritten laws of life apply.

If you were a promoter, would you dish out $15,000 to throw a party for the
people? or would it be a scam to: 1/GET $$$ NOW or 2/GET $$$ LATER  , I
think it was both. You have to remember that money runs this world, and
even if you want to keep the "vibe" alive you will not give a crap about it
if you saw 2000 people in line with $20 bills in their hands. True there
are a lot of people in the scene who WILL keep the "vibe" going ,but
they're going to have to try very hard not to sell out, especially in the
next couple of years when MTV will be doing a live video shoot at Funky
Techno Tribe featuring DJ Dan/Bassbin twins.
It will happen eventually, If something is appealing to the young
generation,big companies will market,advertise,shrink-wrap and offer
mail-in rebates on it.

If you have been going to raves for a while, treasure the moments and  the
people you've met because you will be telling your kids about it, just like
our parents can tell us about the 60's. Any way or other, I think raves
have made our future generation better, more open-minded, understanding and
positive.

tell me what you think...I though about this

Hello sfr,

	A while ago, I pressed my mixed taped. It was actually my set from the
Chrysalis party in Novemeber. Anyhow, there are a few left. I brought some
to Solid Grooves, in S.J. and some to The Trance And Jungle Factory, in
Berkeley. I don't know the exact addresses, but Solid is on Bascom Ave (658
I think), and The Trance Factory is on Telegraph accross from Tower Records. 

	Also, I have older tapes from like late '95- early '96. They aren't
professionally pressed though, but I am willing to sell (very cheaply) or
trade for other mixed tapes. If interested, please respond privately. Thank
you for letting me spam the list!

Peace and love,

Greg =)

All,
	Sorry if this goes out twice. I've been having problems with my
mail.

Anywayz, I've this documentary about the history of music (I only recorded
the last and most important part). It showes an Afro-american male 
explaining how Electro started in the Black neighborhoods of Detroit.(I 
forget his name.) The people puchased cheap equipment but created anew 
style of music never heard before.(It was later explained that groups like Depeche heard this music and inquired this"Afro American"). I believe
this music later evolved with Disco to form what is now House (taken from
the famous club The Warehouse with resident DJ Frankie Knuckles. As the
documentary explaines, This is the basis for Techno as we know today.

Yerba Buena means, literally, "good herb" (yerbabuena is also the Spanish
name for spearmint).  That's always good for a grin coming across the

hi everybody, how are y'all doing? i'm writing to express many thanks for
all the birthday wishes!
i had a marvelous birthday yesterday.i got to play all day long. everyone
around me made it extra
special. my friends took me to the beach and we watched the sun set as we
sat on a huge rock covered with mussels while the tide splashed against
the rock. needless to say, it was delightful.
it was really windy and there were two women and a little girl sitting by
a fire and we asked them if we could stand by and get warmed up. they were
really nice.they had a dog and a pet rat (!)  it turns out that the little
girl will be 9 years old
tomorrow, so i decided to give her one of my bracelets as a gift. 
also a ladybug landed on me and when a ladybug lands on you, it's
considered good luck, so naturally, i was happy. also i saw two
butterflies that came to play with me. 
well, i've already written too much, so i will end. tank jou again.
spread your happiness and give a hug to at least ten people, if not more
today and everyday.
sugarkisses and hugs,
***stariana***

I'd prefer an earthquake every coupla years instead of tornados and
hurricanes every year... I don't want to end up in Oz... well, actually I
do....

Oh... speaking of oz, i just though of something funny.

I was driving to my friend's house after smoking a little something
something and I told the person I was driving with that I felt like I was
going to see the wizard of oz.. this is where it gets funny.. I pull up at
his house (yes I WAS driving) and we ran down the stairs towards my
friend's apartment... where I almost ran over a little TOTO dog.. it was
funny as hell.

 I've done a little web surfing, and I found some info:
 ( This is assuming the "Dave Ford" and "davefor@aol.com"  hits I'm
    summarizing below are all the same guy... )

1. Dedicated fan of Michael Stipe and R.E.M.
2. Identified as "a gay journalist in San Francisco" in a Newsweek
    article from March 12, 1990.
3. Did an article entitled "How Cyberspace Helps Gay Teens" in the
    S.F. Chronicle, Thursday, June 22, 1995, page A23.
4. Has written as a free lance journalist for SF Chronicle and SF Weekly.
5. Has reported on theatrical and musical topics.

 Seems like a legitimate journalist.

Hmm, never thought of it like that; interesting...  Although, I still bet
a lot of these techno-backgrounds in commercials are simply supposed to
sound slick and "futuristic" to a minimally-exposed "mainstream" public
(which I still do believe is ever slowly embracing the sounds of 
electronica).  Just from looking at trends in pop-styles (i.e. U2
exploring more synthesis and less "standard" band-styles, MTV's show
"Amp," etc.), I bet a lot of folks would naturally view the genres we
all know and love as "wave of the future" or something.  Look at the last
series of Micro$oft commercials; they're totally gunning for some kind of 
"cutting-edge" feel in their commercials, because they want their
customers to think that M$ is cutting-edge (ha ha!).  So they use
cutting-edge music.  Anyways, I do think that a lot of execs. do use
techno for just that reason...

The Chrysalis tape has a little techno, then hard trance, to floaty trance,
to housey techno, and it ends with progressive house.

The older tapes are more "Cheesy" trance and progressive house. That's what
I would call it anyways.

Where does techno originate from?

This is almost a religious question. Translate: as many answers as there is
people.

First of all the word techno is already being used by Kraftwerk in one of
their songs way before techno (what we today see as techno was invented).

The usual story goes like this: Herbie Hancock and/or Grandmaster Flash
gave us RAP.
After RAP came House (here comes Detroit and Chicago). England got house
and turned it into ACID!!!
Acid evolved into what we know as techno in the UK ,Germany, the
Netherlands and Belgium.

So goes the standard story.
 
What do we forget? A lot. The EBM or Industrial as is/ was called
established itself already in the early 80s. The likes of Front242 etc.
certainly pushed towards techno as well as the usual Depeche Mode referral.
I always like to think that YMO had some influence as well. But then again
I could also say that bands like Trio let the way, at least in regards of
minimalism.

For me techno certainly is very European. And don't tell me different
before you have been to a Berlin Love Parade. 

Regards
Jan

Sorry for the spam, but I know there's a lot of hepcats out there who 
might be hip to the scene...

KC and I tried to go to an open-mike poetry reading at an Oakland cafe 
last night, but turns out it no longer goes on, and instead we walked 
into an animal-rights activist meeting!  Good for them, but it wasn't 
_quite_ what we were in the mood for.

Wondering if anyone knows of any good open-mike nights?  Maybe even in 
the East Bay (gasp)?  And does anyone have the scoop on this year's 
Poetry Slams happening in SF...

Thank you!
:)

  in the 60's you friend was your dealer, and your dealer was your 
friend.  It wasn't exclusively the CIA that introduced the drug pusher 
and changed all this.  The summer of love ended with the maphia chopping 
people up to get in on the drug trade, and run it their way.

Take I-80 East.  Take University Avenue Exit and go East for approximately
2 miles.  

At Shattuck Avenue (there will be a McDonald's to your left) take a right.
Go approximately 4 blocks (maybe 2 blocks past Bart) and Pasand Lounge
will be on the West side of Shattuck right at the corner of Shattuck and
some other street.  I think it is Bancroft, but I can't quite remember.
If you reach Shattuck and Durant, you've gone TOO far, though.  I'm
sure it is right next to the United Artists theater, so you can't miss it.

Yes...more drug-free raves. Let's tell other people how they should be
running their lives. That's the true raving spirit. We can also tell
people about the harmful effects of being overweight...and hearing loss!

That's a bad slippery slope to get on...

Hi Kevin...

The thing about these labels is that they're all kinda arbitrary. But
here it goes:

Jungle=Drum'n Bass -

Some people say drum'nbass b/c jungle
sounds 	                            		 	      	commercial...for most
dj's I know, there's no difference. Some people say drum'n bass is a
more cut-up sound...

Cut-up :

 Drums are never consistent. Always broken up. Characteristic of older
jungle and 'classic' raga jungle.

Hardstep:

Aggressive bass lines....bouncy...more minimal drums.

Techstep: 

Distorted bass lines and drums. more atmospheric and scary. Industrial
sounds.

----------------

Hope this helps!

-peace-

Brian:
    Extacy, was first developed as an appitite suppresant. Later it   
was used by psychitrists and psycologists to administer to patients 
during treatment .  It enabled people to be more open, relaxed and
talkative. Also patients were more prone to being honest and 
unrestrained about what they felt. 

LSD on the other hand was tested on people, and as far as I know was 
originally developed by some renegade scientists. Beyond testing its 
psycological-effects ON people, I dont think it was used in any kind 
of treatment, although I think I vagley recall hearing something about 
doctors treating schzophrenia with it. 

Anyone know for sure??

LSD was NOT developed by renegade scientists.  it was first created in 1938
by Albert Hoffman at Sandoz Pharmaceutical as part of a series of
experiments involving derivatives of Lysergic Acid... he was looking for
something physical, not psychological, and LSD-25 apparently didn't (in the
initial experiments on rats) fit the bill and was put aside.   some years
later he absorbed a tiny bit of it by accident, and got just the slightest
effect.  he guessed it was LSD-25 that had made him feel strangely, and
decided to do a self-experiment.  he took 1/4 of a milligram (250ug), a
dose which at the time was as low as the lowest active dose of any known
drug.  if i'm not mistaken that's about 2.5 hits of decent acid by today's
standards.  never having heard of or imagined psychedelic effects before,
he had a pretty scary trip.   but he was aware that the drug had
psychiatric potential, and soon the company he worked for was marketing
it---

from the data sheet accompanying product:
(see also Physician's Desk Reference from mid-60's)

                      Delysid (LSD 25)

           D-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate

        Sugar-coated tablets containing 0.025 mg. (25 ug.)

        Ampoules of 1 ml. containing 0.1  mg.  (100  ug.)  for  oral
administration.

     The solution may also be injected  s.c.  or  i.v.   The
effect  is  identical  with  that of oral administration but
sets in more rapidly.

                         PROPERTIES

     The administration  of  very  small  doses  of  Delysid
(1/2-2  ug./kg.  body  weight) results in transitory distur-
bances of affect, hallucinations, depersonalization,  reliv-
ing  of  repressed memories, and mild neuro-vegetative symp-
toms.  The effect sets in after 30 to 90  minutes  and  gen-
erally  lasts  5 to 12 hours.  However, intermittent distur-
bances of affect may occasionally persist for several days.

                  METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION

     For oral administration the contents of  1  ampoule  of
Delysid  are  diluted with distilled water, a 1% solution of
tartaric acid or halogen-free tap water.

     The absorption of the solution is somewhat  more  rapid
and more constant that that of the tablets.

     Ampoules which have not been opened,  which  have  been
protected  against  light  and  stored  in  a cool place are
stable for an unlimited period.  Ampoules  which  have  been
opened or diluted solutions retain their effectiveness for 1
to 2 days, if stored in a refrigerator.

                   INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE

a)   Analytical  psychotherapy,   to   elicit   release   of
     repressed  material and provide mental relaxation, par-
     ticularly in anxiety states and obsessional neuroses.
     The initial dose is 25 ug. (1/4  of  an  ampoule  or  1
     tablet).   This  dose is increased at each treatment by
     25 ug. until the optimum dose (usually between 50  and
     200  ug.) is found.  The individual treatments are best
     given at intervals of one week.

b)   Experimental studies on the nature  of  psychoses:   By
     taking  Delysid  himself,  the  psychiatrist is able to
     gain an insight in the world of ideas and sensations of
     mental  patients.   Delysid can also be used to induced
     model psychoses of short duration in  normal  subjects,
     this facilitating studies on the pathogenesis of mental
     disease.

     In normal subjects, doses of 25 to 75 ug. are generally
     sufficient  to produce a hallucinatory psychosis (on an
     average 1 ug./kg. body weight).  In  certain  forms  of
     psychosis  and  in chronic alcoholism, higher doses are
     necessary (2 to 4 ug./kg. body weight).

                        PRECAUTIONS

     Pathological mental conditions may  be  intensified  by
Delysid.  Particular caution is necessary in subjects with a
suicidal tendency and  in  those  cases  where  a  psychotic
development appears imminent.  The psycho-affective lability
and the tendency to commit impulsive acts  may  occasionally
last for some days.

     Delysid should only be administered under strict  medi-
cal supervision.  The supervision should not be discontinued
until the effects of the drug have completely worn off.

                          ANTIDOTE

     The mental effects of Delysid can be  rapidly  reversed
by the i.m.  administration of 50 mg. chlorpromazine.

LSD was discovered by Albert Hoffman, who was definitely *not* a renegade
scientist.  I believe he was doing gov't research at the time?

Hey beloved family!!!! *HUGZ*

yep, more n more commercialization, i just ran across this article on
electronic music in *entertainment weekly* magazine. if u want the actual
article, its in issue # 370, dated march 14, 1997 with ralph fiennes and
kristin scott thomas on the cover. in the lower right hand corner, it says
"rave on , a consumer's guide to the new music revolution" 

following is the article bcuz i know many of ya would like to read it right
at this moment, so i'll satiate that want =) : here it is:


ROCK IS DEAD , long live ...?

With grunge on life support and sales flatlining, the music biz is looking
to spark a rebirth with electronica. But can you dance to it? by chris willman

In an editing studio in midtown manhattan, Todd Mueller is programming the
future, and its not a pretty sight. Mueller, the producer of MTV's weekly
electronic music show, Amp, is trying to edit down the video for the band
Juno Reactor's "Feel the Universe." The music is the common throbbing
computer pulse of techno, and, like many videos of the genre, this one
doesn't bother picturing the performers; instead, it's footage of Ku Klux
Klan rallies, flowers, sunsets, and some sort of Japanese royal coronation.
It all looks like it's meant to signify a sense of information overload, if
not somesort of systems crash.

Not that the frantic jumble of sound and vision in the Juno Reactor clip is
necessarily intended as ominous. Here, in this cultish pocket of the
pop-music world, future shock carries uniformly cheerful connotations.
"Techno embraces technology and encourages the fusion of man and machine,"
says Mueller, 28, whose boyish visage, glasses , and beanie make him look
like Jon Cryer after a particularly long rave. "It says 'Don't be a
Luddite!" That should be our bumper sticker. We're at the dawn of the 21st
century; it's logical that technology would be part of everyone's mindset."

Suddenly, it's an especially large part of the collective mind-set of the
music biz, which could stand a movement to be bullish about. The bloom is
certainly off the alternative-rock rose that Nirvana pollinated in 1991. "To
some extent, that revolution has become everything it set out to cure," says
Reprise Records president Howie Klein. "What we have now is alternative
corporate rock, practically." Points out Mercury president Danny Goldberg,
"The energy that emanated from Seattle in the late '80s, early '90s is
obviously a five-year-old-energy--and in rock & roll, five years is a
generation." Executives humbled by 1996's flat sales and youthful yawns are
eager to spot any popular uprising that might replace the increasingly outre
strains of guitar grunge and jangle angst. The ska,alt-country,lounge,and
Latin rock scenes all hold promise but have apparent ceilings on their appeal.

Will the industry [look to] techno for an answer?

The answer seems to be a very qualified yes. The movement's leading British
band, Prodigy, is widely expected to establish a commercial beachhead here
with the May 20 release of their first album since Madonna's Maverick label
signed them to a rumored $5 million contract. Big heat surrounds the
Chemical Brothers' April 8 release , Dig Your Own Hole, as well. And even if
techno in its purest form never does go mainstream, some of the remaining
superstars of alt-rock -- notably , U2 and the Smashing Pumpkins -- are
already busy co-opting the stylistic tenets of electronic pop and beating
their Stratocaster swords into digital plowshares. Roll over, Leo Fender,
and tell Yngwie Malmsteen the news: In one form or another, "electronica" is
coming.

Most of the major labels have either made distribution deals with
electronically oriented indie companies or started signing techno acts
directly. Geffen records, for one, has done both. "I was just in England,"
says label president Bill Bennett, "where they think we're nuts: ' Oh,
you're just discovering techno music?' I think its gonna be big here."
Geffen was one of several companies that got into a bidding war late last
year for Prodigy. But Bennett acknowledges that the payoff may not be as
quick in the U.S. as it has been in Europe: "I don't know is it's gonna be
defined by radio like most pop music is-certainly not in its early stages.
The commercial possibilities at some time will catch up to the talent, so
you're kind of investing in the future."

For David Bowie, it's all about the here and now. "There's a freneticism
that I find very pertinent to the way we live in the late 20th century. It
just seems to be the dialogue that is valuable,"says Bowie, who borrows
liberally from jungle's rhythmic vocabulary on his new Earthling. It's a
mutual admiration society, of course: "My ear has always been attuned to
that brand of chaos," he notes, and the daring electronic albums he and
Brian Eno made in the '70s indelibly influenced waves of young tech-heads.
"Everybody knew something was going to come out of Britain, but it's almost
like the Blur/Pulp/Oasis thing was kind of treading water. The real valuable
music is coming from dance bands.

Not everyone is  quite so eager to speed toward the millenium, if this is
the soundtrack For years mainstream rock fans have watched with some
suspicion as bin cards heralding exotic subgenres like "drum-and-bass" ,
"illbient", and "trance" popped up in more progressive record outlets. Any
threat seemed remote; these were typically import compilations spotlighting
no name British dance acts, relegated to lesser, scarier corners of the
store. But the years of containment are coming to an end.

Leading the charge into the mainstream, U2 jettisoned their old "three
chords and the truth" credo for half a dozen samples and a sense of cheek in
key tracks-like the hit "Discotheque"-on their just released Pop album. The
Pumpkins are at work on an electronically tempered album, a preview of which
might be found in the drum-machine-fueled ballad Billy Corgan contributed to
the new Lost Highway soundtrack. Even guitar god Eric Clapton has recorded
an electronic album (Retail Therapy) under the pseudonym x-sample, as a
member of the group T.D.F. Several upcoming film soundtracks are thick with
the stuff, starting with such mainstream Hollywood fare as The Saint.
Clearly, all this electro-juice isn't just for breakbeat anymore.

Backlash, anyone? Before these brave new sounds have even filtered down to
most Americans, "Techno sucks" is becoming a counter-mantra. Isn't ambient
really just elevator music for cybergeeks? Isn't rave-readier stuff disco
all over agin? Where are the songs? Faceless dance music, computer
sequencers,prog-rock flourishes, all-powerful production geniuses...aren't
these the elements God sent punk to save us from?

Aw, contraire, say the true believers: Techno is the new punk, if its
do-it-yourself ethos counts as a benchmark. The shrinking cost of
drum-machine and sampler technology is a prime factor in the appeal to the
DIY underground-along with the fact that today's pierced collegiates, unlike
their safety pinned predecessors, were weaned on PCs. "I'm in my 40s, and I
hated dance music growing up," says Bennett, "but I don't equate this with
dance music. You know what it is? Any 19-year-old can be a producer now, as
opposed to Giorgio Moroder, and that's what excites me."

It's every man a king on the dance floor as well as in the studio. "At a
rave , as opposed to a concert, it's very empowering. The energy is
dispersed over the whole crowd," says Jason Bentley, a movement maven who
DJs on L.A.'s top alternative and public radio stations as well as handling
A&R for Island's Quango label. "It's democratic; it isn't like you're
sitting watching a pop star. You are empowered to involve yourself with the
music, or walk around or talk-it isn't focused on the stage."

Richard James, the one man band who bills himself as the Aphex Twin, makes
an almost perverse point of shrouding himself in a nearly opaque DJ booth on
stage. "I think one of the advantages to electronic music is that it's
faceless-the personality doesn't get in the way," he says. "There've been
songs I liked for years; then I see who did them and say 'Look at that
prat', and its spoiled it for me."

The lack of celebrity focus represents a fundamental paradigm shift for pop
fans. But if you're looking to fix your sights on an electronic star, check
out Prodigy. After their last album, in 1995, the formerly faceless group
hired Keith Flint, a spiky haired frontman who is what you either love or
hate about the band's "Firestarter" video -eschewed by MTV's Amp programmers
as too "pop" for their hip late-night viewers, but already among the first
real techno videos in prime-time Buzz Bin rotation. Unlike most electronic
bands, they use live guitars and even -God forbid- tour.

"It's about time," says an unlikely fan, Beck, enthusing over Prodigy's
burgeoning Stateside presence. "I've been watching them in Europe for a
while and wondering when the kids here would figure that out, because once
they do it'll be all over. We played festivals with Prodigy in Europe and
saw 50,000 kids going insane. The spirit of their music isn't
self-glorifying, really-it's a release thing for people, catharsis without
the cliche. They're harnessing the same energy Jerry LEe Lewis harnessed in
the '50s-and there's a sense of humor with it. I think it's kool; I condone."

Beck himself hardly counts as a techno-cian. But one of the godfathers of
the genre,Moby,pointedly prefers Beck's revolutionary brand of
electronically enhanced hip-hop-rock over the massive wave of dance music he
helped inspire.

"All the journalists who are getting excited about this 'electronica'
revolution, I feel they missed the boat," sniffs Moby, who's done his small
part to buck the tide by going back to guitars on his latest album, Animal
Rights. "The stuff that's going on now is a real pale imitation of what was
happening five years ago. It would be like people declaring a punk rock
revolution in 1985." The future, Moby claims, is in hybrids:" There are
great electronic records and great rock records. The thing that interests me
is people combining the two-Beck being a good example, someone who basically
made an electronic record but sang on top of it."

Behind Beck's cut-and-paste pop are producers du jour the Dust Brothers, two
guys from Silverlake, Calif., who made computers in rock & roll cool with
the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique in 1989 and cooler still with last year's
most acclaimed album, Beck's Odelay. The key difference between techno and
what these new Mac daddies pull off is that their work is willfully
backward-looking.

"We try and stay away from drum machines," emphasizes Dust Brother Mike
Simpson, who says the approach he and his partner, John King, take to
computer sampling is closer to Trent Reznor's neo-industrial loops than to
the new dance acts. Their rubber-soul sonic collages typically rely on drums
sampled from '70s R&B records and early '80s rap singles, a funky,
repetitive bed for all sorts of live effects up top. "I kind of feel like
we've just been imitating the Beatles the whole time, " says Simpson.
"Everything we do sounds like it could have been on Sgt. Pepper."

No wonder that no less pre-electronica an act than the Rolling Stones have
enlisted the Dusties to produce several tracks for their next album. "The
first demo that Mick played us sounded like we had already produced it,"
Simpson says. "He did do his homework." In other words, yes, the Stones will
be using some computer-sampled rhythms. Be afraid, Charlie Watts, be very
afraid.

Those of us who aren't drummers have little to fear from the electronica
revolution- or so we're assured. The movement shouldn't divide rock
enthusiasts into hostile camps, insists the Chemical Brothers' Ed Simons.
"It's not pretty music we make; it's quite rough and abrasive," he says. "In
that way, it is kind of dance music for rock fans. If you buy one of our
records, it doesn't mean you have to go and burn all your Offspring CDs."
Maybe, in fact, that's where the premillenial party lies: moshers mixing it
up with the raving mad.

Cap'n Cr--  uhh, Johnny D didn't say "drug free", he said "smoke-free."
Drugs (usually) only affect the people taking them.  Cigarettes affect many
more than just the smoker.

Personally, I got bummed at Warmth when I found out I couldn't smoke any old
where I wanted, but then I started thinking about all the non-smokin folks
who get bummed when I'm hacking my phlegmy bad breath lung tissue tar cancer
coughing butt head smoke all over them.

************

In Baltimore in the 1970's (?) LSD was used successfully to treat
alcoholism, by some maverick docs.   Patients were administered heavy doses,
and were guided by their shrinks to examine their lives and locate the
sources of their unhappiness.   

When I was living in BaltiBore, I remember reading an article about one of
the recovered alcoholics, who described that after tapping into the source
of his addiction, he completely  lost the desire/need to drink. The
experiments were definitely kind of renegade, they weren't very widespread,
but I believe they had a lot of support, especially from the people who's
lives were changed by their experience on the drug.

i think that techno came from the UFO...Ultimate FriendSHIP Object...
that crashed at roswell. This was the music those wacky aliens were 
listening to when they crashed. If they had been watching where
they were flying instead of dancing they would never have crashed.

Hey all! Just would like to say that the Kruder & Dorfmeister CD that my
friend let me borrow is pretty jammin', and if you haven't checked it out,
do so! It's the compilation one: DJ Kicks Vol. ???????, but they've got
some excellent chill tunes on this compilation.

Go down to your nearest cd store and check it out- I believe they also have
other compilations for DJ's such as Stacey Pullen, Carl Craig, Claude
Young, and CJ Bolland.

Peace, MR2

If your are interested in MDMA and its cousins just point your browser to
newsgroups. Have it search for MDMA and any other alphabet cocktail. There
are newsgroups and lists for alt.drugs.rec (etc.). Lots of interesting stuff!

  i think the groups are
rec.drugs.whatever   and
alt.drugs.whatever
  but they mainly overlap, with alt occasionally having more noise.
the problem with the groups is that nobody is held accountable at all.  
Why believe anythign anyone says?  I feel at least a bit better about 
getting info from hyperreal and the lycaeum, not only are they archives, 
so you can get what you want, they have the 'best of' usenet often 
included in FAQ's or other text files.

In December 1985, a group of psychotherapists in Switzerland obtained
permission to use psychoactive drugs in their work including MDMA, LSD,
Mescaline and psilocybin. They formed The Swiss Medical Society for
Psycholytic Therapy(95), and besides treating patients with these drugs,
members take one of the drugs together at twice yearly meetings.

does anyone know what the _current_ state of legality of LSD and MDMA _for
clinical use_ is in switzerland and other european countries?

RAVE NEW WORLD

by David Browne

Like some DNA experiment gone wondrously wrong. pop in the 90s never stops
splitting an subdividing. Nowhere is that more evident-and perplexing- than
in the world of techno, electronica,electro, or whatever term you prefer. If
you think all techno sounds the same, you don't know Spring Heel Jack (more
on the later) - or any of the seemingly endless one-man -electro
bands,DJs,producers, and mixers that make up this polymorphous scene. The
differences between the styles like drum-and-bass and jungle are like the
differences between computer companies themselves: They're subtle, sometimes
extremely so, but apparent nonetheless.

The following guide is meant to help newcomers carve out their own path in
the electronica jungle (more on that style later). A year from now, the
genres below may have mutated into all-new ones, but techno wouldn't have it
any other way.

*TECHNO*
If techno could be personified, it would be Chuck Berry. Often used to
describe the entire spectrum of modern electronic music, techno is also the
name for the music's purest, most basic style. Along with the soulful, more
R&B-rooted house music, it took shape in the late '80s, tapping into the
'70s disco and new wave. Techno's air-duct-blast synthesizer snorts, smapled
voices, and shuffle-puck beats per minute remain the basic building blocks
of the electronic music scene of the '90s. For all its thumping, pulsating,
knob-twirling sonics, though, techno is the hookiest style of electronica.
You may not be able to hum the Chemical Brothers' "Setting Sun", Utah
Saint's "Something Good", Prodigy's "Firestarter," or Underworld's "Born
Slippy" - to name a few of the genre's greatest hits- but it's impossible to
deny their furious, techno-prisoners allure.
-Classic Rock Equivalent-:Kraftwerk trapped in a video game.
-Plugging In-:Techno has come so far that early compilations now feel dated
and one-dimensional. A few,however, are worth seeking out. *Only for the
Headstrong:The ultimate rave compilation (FFRR,1992) and *Futurhythms
(Medicine,1993) variously feature tracks by groundbreakers like Moby,
Prodigy, and Orbital. Beginners can start with the collections *Wipeout XL
*Astralwerks/Caroline,1996) and *Plastic Compilation Volume 1 (Nettwerk,
1997). (The latter features remixes of Garbage and Sarah McLachlan alongside
the Chemical Brothers and Underworld.) Another sampler for novices, *Special
Brew (Payday/FFRR,1996), includes brain-bending sonic overhauls of U2,
Bjork, and Paul Weller.

Now that you've planted one foot in the rave, proceed to individual artists'
records. *Utah Saints (London, 1992), the eponymous debut of that British
duo, is essential, as is Moby's *Everything is Wrong (Elektra, 1995), which
takes punk and dance under its electronica wing. Further proof of techno's
progress can be heard on the Chemical Brother's swirling debut *Exit Planet
Dust (Astralwerks/Caroline, 1995), and Underworld's art-rock-style *Second
Toughest in the Infants (Wax Trax!/TVT, 1996).
-Best Listening Environment-:Anywhere you're in motion-rave,dance club,or
health club. Despite techno mythology, mind-expanding substances not required.

*JUNGLE*
The breakneck pace of techno soon grew repetitive, so a new group of
artists, mixers, and entreprenuers decided to slip in reggae bass lines,
Jamaican patois, disco divas-anything to spice up what can be, at worst,
numbingly monotonous thumpings. Originally called breakbeat, jungle can be
brassier than hardcore, yet retains the spatial aloofness of electronic
music-call it spiritual disco.
-Classic Rock Equivalent-:Donna Summer goes shopping for crystals.
-Plugging In-:The compilations *The History of Our World Part One (Profile,
1994) , *Counterforce (FFRR, 1995) , and to a less interesting degree,
*Jungle: The Sound of the Underground (Sour/Colombia, 1996) showcase the
ways in which jungle brings out techno's human side. (History's Oaysis sound
nothing like that Oasis) Goldie, Britain's mixer about town, was one of
jungle's first stars, and the rapturous acid-disco title suite on his 1995
album, Timeless (FFRR) is a prime example of the form.
-Best Listening Environment-: At the office, while you're slaving away at
the computer- you'll work and tap your toes simultaneously.

*AMBIENT*
Everyone, even ravers, needs to chill. In the '70s, producer-musician-U2
cohort Brian Eno rocked the Muzak with *Music for Airports, but a new
generation of Brits took his disquieting sounds to new levels of lushness
and intricacy. Almost always instrumental, ambient is spacey and ethereal,
the only techno subgenre not for the dance floor. But there's nothing New
Age about it: Its boilings and sonic splats and burps show that computers
can be cranky too.
-Classic Rock Equivalent-:Pink Floyd circa Ummagumma-but double the bong hits.
-Plugging In-:Moby's *Ambient (Instinct, 1993) , Orbital's *In Sides
(FFRR,1996), and the Orb's *U.F.Orb (Big Life/Mercury, 1992) are musical hot
tubs, while ambient auteur Richard James, who records as the Aphex Twin,
tosses cheeky elements into the mix on *Selected Ambient Works 85-92
(R&S,1992) and *Richard D.James Album (Sire, 1997). Lying somewhere between
the two extremes, The Future Sound of London albums like *Dead Cities
(Astralwerks/Caroline, 1996) dot their aural landscapes with heavenly choirs
and spaghetti-Western guitars. 
-Best Listening Environment-: The bath is drawn, the candles are lit, and
you're alone.

*AMBIENT DUB*
Take ambient, add industrial-strength reggae bass lines, mix, and serve. 
-Classic Rock Equivalent-:Bob Marley, with no vocals and triple the bong hits. 
-Plugging In-: *Marco Dub Infection Volume One (Gyroscope/Caroline) features
sonic manipulators like Tricky, Spring Heel Jack , and the Golden Palominos.
Illbient, a fledging offshoot genre pioneered by DJ Spooky, is even more
heavy-lidded; check out the anthology *Incursions in Illbient (Asphodel, 1996).
-Best Listening Environment-:An opium den, with or without the opium.

*DRUM and BASS*
In simplest terms, drum-and-bass is ambient with a more sensual beat. A
close sister of jungle, it's been popularized in the U.K. by producer-mixers
like LTJ Bukem. As its names implies, drum-and-bass is stripped down and
occasionally features vocals. The beats are often hard shuffles, like
sandpaper scratches, but the synthesizers that cast a glaze over the
melodies create a warm bath of sound-music for looking to the heavens but
remaining physically grounded. (Well, most of the time: Chameleon's "Links"
samples Matthew Broderick in Ferris Beuller's Day Off.) Its soft, burbling
rhythms are also adaptable to pop melodies, as proved by recent records by
Everything but the Girl and David Bowie.
-Classic Rock Equivalent-:Brian Eno and Robert Fripp get a little funky.
-Plugging In-: Two compilations, *Logical Progression (FFRR,1996) and
*History Part 2 : The Rough and the Smooth (Sm;)e, 1996), collect sonic
explorers like Bukem (yes, nicknamed after the Hawaii Five-O catchphrase)
and Alex Reece. To hear the genre creep into the mainstream, try Everything
But the Girl's Walking Wounded and the EP Everything But the Girl vs.
Drum'n'Bass (both Atlantic, 1996).
-Best Listening Environment-:On the sofa, after a long day's work.

*TRIP HOP*
Even music rooted in technology can be emotive. Known early as the Bristol
sound in honor of the British city where it began, trip-hop isn't quite as
trippy or rap oriented as its name implies. The clip-clop beats sway, but un
a laid back way; the slinky, groggy singing is covered in a blanket of
numbed audio guaze. Cool, restrained, and cautious, it's soul for the
chill-out room.
-Classic Rock Equivalent-: Sly and the Family Stone's *There's a Riot Goin'
On, but in a better mood.
-Plugging In-:Start with the sound collective Massive Attack's *Blue Lines
(Virgin, 1991), one of the most influential records of the decade. Toss in
*Maxinquaye (Island, 1995) , the first and best album by the roguish Tricky,
and Portishead's *Dummy (Go!Discs/London, 1994). Next up: the trip-pop of
the Icelandic band Gus Gus and their debut, *Polydistortion (4AD/Warner
Bros. , out April 8), and a new Portishead album due this fall.
-Best Listening Environment-: Take it along during a casual stroll on a warm
spring or summer day.

*SLICE and DICE*
White men can't jump, but they can splice. Pioneered by the Beastie Boys on
their influential 1989 album *Paul's Boutique (the Sgt Pepper of its time),
this melding of rap,pop, and electronica doesn't officially have a name. But
its sensibility- the Cuisinart of hip-hop beats, strings, organs, white-boy
rapping, blaxploitation-movie homages, and everything but the kitsch sink-
captures the media-saturated brain overload of the '90s. The success of Beck
(and his coproducers, the Dust Brothers) proves the public may be ready for
cut-and-paste pop.
-Classic Rock Equivalent-:Turn on your local rock station, listen for 15
seconds, then start flipping back and forth between rap and dance stations.
-Plugging In-: Beck's *Odelay (and its predecessor, *Mellow Gold, both on
Geffen) stands as the definitive text, along with DJ Shadow's hip-hop
symphony *Entroducing... (Mo Wax/FFRR, 1996) and Money Mark's *Mark's
Keyboard Repair (Mo Wax/FFRR, 1996). *Headz 1 and 2 , two separate
compilations from the London-based Mo Wax label, feature the Beastie Boys
and the Dust Brothers alongside British genrebusters like MAssive Attack.
-Best Listening Environment-: In your living room - but for full
multi-media-age effect, turn on the tv and keep the sound off.

*DIGITAL HARDCORE*
One of the most appealing aspects of all these techno styles is their
utopianism; the blissed-out quality (and the one-world nature of techno
technology itself) feels several worlds removed from grunge frustration. Not
so much with digital hardcore, which is both a style and the name of the
German record company that's hping it. The basic idea: pent-up punk thrash
played on the synthesizers common to techno. Forget the relatively tuneful
Marilyn Manson- this is the musical apocalypse, the true premillenial tension.
-Classic Rock Equivalent-:The Sex Pistols log on, crash, and get truly angry.
-Plugging In-: Stick with the only one-say, Atari Teenage Riot's import-only
*Delete Yourself (Digital Hardcore, 1995) - so you don't risk eviction.
-Best Listening Environment-:Pick a work chore you find particularly
hateful, put on this music, and go at it. Gobbing optional.

LSD on the other hand was tested on people, and as far as I know was
originally developed by some renegade scientists. Beyond testing its
psycological-effects ON people, I dont think it was used in any kind
of treatment, although I think I vagley recall hearing something about
doctors treating schzophrenia with it.

Anyone know for sure??

It was used by psychaitrists in the 50's to cure alcoholism - it worked
but was abandoned due to who knows why. I've read this and seen
documentaries with this experiment in school and tv, go figure.

Yep Jon, they have some pretty good stuff, and my friend even got his *1st*
tables from there last week, at reasonable price.  I wasn't thinking about
spinning trance, but after about 2 hours in the store last Sunday, I
definitely reconsidered what new selections of vinyl I wanted to collect in
the future!

Does anyone know if they got their ATM/Debit machines hooked up yet? I'm
ready to blow my paycheck away this week! Peace, MR2

That's a very good point.  I guess that's what I really meant to say. 
Competition can become negative when people think that doing something
better means that they ARE a better person.

Brian, 

Thank you so much for coming back after your research and correcting
yourself. The biggest problem with GHB is that most people and media haven't
done the research, make incorrect statements and then never come back with
the accurate correction.

Basically GHB has very low toxicity ON ITS OWN, but the minute you mix it
with anything, really anything (even over the counter) it becomes a little
like Russian roulette. And many people unwisely chose to do their
experimenting in public place like clubs and raves which has added to the
hysteria and media hype. All this has caused lawmakers to now want to add GHB
to schedule 1. This is an amino acid found naturally in every cell in our
bodies. It clearly does not belong on sched 1, but clearly people need to be
a little more responsible in their use of this substance. Respect your bodies
and never take anything without first doing a little research...
there is a book called "Better Sex Through Chemistry", and the same authors
are coming out with an entire book on GHB this summer.
 
See you on the dancefloor,

juliet   :)

Just wanted to let you folks, who can pick up KZSU over the

that DJ Myleece will be a guest on The Living Dread show.

DJ Myleece comes to us from London to spin the phatest and
fiercest London influenced Drum n Bass.  This is all happening
from Midnight to 3 AM this evening (Tues.)  Point your Web
browser to www-kzsu.stanford.edu for Real Audio access.

Also (a bit of BSP here) I'm on the air myself until Mid.
bringing you a variety of sounds (see the calendar for a
short description.)  Palo Alto City Council has been
generous enough to give me some of the time for my show
back this evening. :-)  (But they'll be back again
next week.)

Keep it real.

Regarding the DJ kicks series, I feel obligated to warn you about the stacey
pullen CD.  I totally love Stacey Pullen's mixing (I have a tape of a party
called "Prometheus Unbound", a transmat records tour that he spun at that rocks
my world), but in this case, it is muddied by overproduction.  He adds a lot of
delay and reverb in certain portions.  A lot of times the delay isn't
synchronized w/ the record, making it sound like a train wreck.  I'm borrowing
the Claude Young edition of the series, and I DO recommend that.  It's got
amazing tracks (only one bad) and amazing mixing.
                             yup,
                                 Steve

That means that of 100% of the messages that come to SF Raves, 66% of them
get put into my "first tier" SFR folder, and 33% of them go into my "second
tier" folder. My filters aren't perfect though -- most of what is on SF
Raves *has become* a bunch of off topic nonsense and not relavent to raving.

Why am I on SF Raves? The correct question is "Why am I still on SF Raves?"

When I subscribed to SF Raves two years ago, it had high ratio of people
and contributions that reflected a small, "everybody knows everybody"
virtual cul-de-asc type community. As far as content, there was relatively
small crap factor.

I am hoping for that to come again, but, as I write this, I realize that,
just like the rave scene itself, SF Raves is doomed to "mall rat culture"
dilution as the music (techno, house, etc.), community and prospective
"market" grows to a critical mass that can again, just like in the early
1990's, be market to.

It makes me sad that my old neighborhood is surrounded by freeways,
shopping malls, and McDonald's. I guess to find the neighborhood I used to
live in called "raving" I will have to move to a new "neighborhood." That
neighborhood will no longer be called "raving" but I will, hopefullly, find
the community that "raving" has lost.

Did anybody watch the news about the girl in Sacramento who hired an

It was on the news Monday and Tues.

hello all-

i find this attitude just a bit eliteist (is that spelled correctly?).  i
don't find that what is occurring to sfraves to be a "dilution", i find it
to be an evolution to something that it was never planned to be.  contrary
to popular belief, that is not bad, and can in fact be good.

this notion of what sfraves "should be", imho, is bordering on
hypocritical.  from my limited exposure (2 years, which is starting to make
me look like a middle-ager!) and a complete (yes, complete!) reading of the
archives, i have noted that there are always those who are griping about
"dilution", "pollution", "off topic posts", etc.  without those posts,
though, sfraves would not have grown to what it is, and would not have
grown to what people idealize that it was like in the past.

though i understand the need for control of the topics so that this doesn't
become alt.raves, i counsel disgression when using strong statements like
"dilution" and "mall rat culture".

Hey I don't have _any_ filters on my EMAIL...

because I don't know how to use them!

But in all honesty, even if I did know how, I wouldn't!  
I love the different off-beat posts AND the RR stuff!  It's all scene to me.

She hired an escort service for sex and took ecstacy, and died??? Hmm. How
much did she take and what other things were in her system? Weird.

Hate to dissapoint all you kids but the term tchno is a word stemming from
a generic brand name.  You see in Europe we refere to activities by there
brand names.  Thus the term "doing the hoovering" means doing the
vacuuming (Hoover first invented the vacuum cleaner), "to tippex" means to
use whitner (tippex first invented whitner) and "to techno" means to
produce sounds from a technics 1200 (as they were the first people to make
a decent record player).  The only know refference that I know of in
reguards to term being used musically before this whole dance scene
thing took off was in 1986 on the Krafwerk record"Electronic Cafe" in the
track "Techno pop."
See yer!

About one month ago I left the scene.  Not really left but just been
hanging out on the edges of everything.  The only thing I really do that
has to do with the scene is keep intouch with the sf family.  You guys
have been really great to me(responding to all my questions and what
not)  I'm not planning on coming back for some time due to personal
reasons but after the summer I'll be living in sf going to school
there.  I hope that most of you people will still be here when I get
there.  I just wanted to say thanx for everything.  Keeping the vibe
alive from the outside...

Sorry to do this all cause I hate threads that go on and on,
but I have to think that the term "teKno" or "teKno Music" came from or was
spawned from the advancements of various drum machines, samplers, etc?? and
since most people that produce "teKno" music, it would be the most
technological form of music (I.E. the MC 303, 909 SP1200 etc..) If I am wrong
can someone please tell me the correct meaning. When I think of teKno I think
of the most sophicated froms of instruments to make music. Hence the term
"Tekno"


Thanks for letting me spam the list.

Hi there,

This represents a very large portion of the negativity found in the bay area 
rave scene, and there is a definte separation of the tribes due to it.

I have always said that it is alright to surround yourself with the things 
that are familiar and comfortable to you.  But, we must also realize that 
without change, there is no growth.  To seperate oneself from sfraves 
because it is becoming "dilluted" with the "mall rat culture" is limiting 
that person to the possible growth that would be found there.  I joined 
sfraves because I have heard that this was happening.  That the more 
experienced sfravers were leaving for these reasons, leaving sfraves to the 
very "mall rat culture" that they don't agree with in the first place.  The 
only way for things to change is through education.  period.  All sfravers 
are on this list because we all share a common interest, raving.  Although 
some may believe that the list has changed for the worse, only through 
active participation on the part of people who disagree with the way the 
list is going will it change.

We are in the midst of a very critical time in the development of raving in 
America.  Soon, the masses will descend upon raving as if it were the buzz 
word for the 90's...it's already happening...read the magazines and 
newspapers...watch mtv...turn on hard copy...they are all reporting raving 
as some sort of new hip era of our culture.  Regardless of how we all feel 
individually, this influx of the masses is inevitable.  I welcome it 
however, because I know that it will invoke great change upon my ideals, and 
I will be forced to deal with my rave culture in a much different way.

It is not enough to surround yourself with the things that you believe in 
and are comfortable with.  We must educate those that we don't agree with as 
to what those ideals are.  For if you abandon these people, they will not 
see things the way that you do, thus continuing the only way they know 
how...use your voice...

Smiles,

Scott =)

That means that of 100% of the messages that come to SF Raves, 66% of them
get put into my "first tier" SFR folder, and 33% of them go into my "second
tier" folder. My filters aren't perfect though -- most of what is on SF
Raves *has become* a bunch of off topic nonsense and not relavent to raving.

Why am I on SF Raves? The correct question is "Why am I still on SF Raves?"

When I subscribed to SF Raves two years ago, it had high ratio of people
and contributions that reflected a small, "everybody knows everybody"
virtual cul-de-asc type community. As far as content, there was relatively
small crap factor.

I am hoping for that to come again, but, as I write this, I realize that,
just like the rave scene itself, SF Raves is doomed to "mall rat culture"
dilution as the music (techno, house, etc.), community and prospective
"market" grows to a critical mass that can again, just like in the early
1990's, be market to.

It makes me sad that my old neighborhood is surrounded by freeways,
shopping malls, and McDonald's. I guess to find the neighborhood I used to
live in called "raving" I will have to move to a new "neighborhood." That
neighborhood will no longer be called "raving" but I will, hopefullly, find
the community that "raving" has lost.

Preach on, Uncle Noah!  It *is* all scene, because everyone here is
what makes the scene!  I *love* the diversity of topics our community
jumps into, even if it does tend to stray a bit, although I do believe
that people should humour each other to a degree with the little things,
and put NRR on top of a post if it's NRR, so that those of us that *do*
want to use filters can.
I certainly wouldn't analogize this group to the development of "mallrat
culture," though.  Geez... that's kind of harsh.  After all the beautiful
NRR posts that pop up weekly (i.e. poems, inspirational words, etc.), I
think SFRaves is a *lot* less apathetic (and far more eloquent) than your
average utterly-bored mallrat crowd.  (...Speaking of which, as far as
_Mallrats_ goes, I thought it was a good flick.  Nothing on _Clerks_, mind
you (it should've been shot in B&W, too), but still pretty decent.
Okay, sorry, now I'm *really* stretching the NRR envelope!  I'll shut up
now.)   
Keep smiling!  :)

erm, isn't techno some derivative of 'technological'?  

that seems to make much more sense than any etymological reference to a
turntable brand name.  esp. since 'techno' music has to be composed and
produced before it could even *be* played on a turntable.

I heard that Joey Beltram canonized the term 'techno' as it applies to
electronic dance music, in the mid 80's.

I believe Wayne is right on regarding the comments he made.  Note that he
did not claim that SFR is *currently* diluted with mall rat culture, but
only doomed to undergoing such a dilution.  Below is an excerpt from his
message:

<Wayne>
> I am hoping for that to come again, but, as I write this, I realize
> that, just like the rave scene itself, SF Raves is doomed to "mall rat
> culture"  dilution as the music (techno, house, etc.), community and
> prospective "market" grows to a critical mass that can again, just like
> in the early 1990's, be market to. 
</Wayne>

And as far as the arguments to the contrary go, is this so different than
when people often bemoan the disappearance of the underground?  As raves
become more mainstream, those who prefer "the way it was" (ie, more people
there for the music and less people there for the "scene" and "oh, is this
what cool people do now?") will go further underground.  Likewise, as the
internet becomes more popular and the rave lists become filled with ever
more sophomoric discussion (coke v. pepsi?  come *on*), those used to the
way it was (ie, more information, less fluff) will move on.

The comments about "diversity" miss the point completely.  If lewd,
disrespectful frat-types show up at Sunset and start making unwelcome
come-ons, is that diversity?  Of course not.  The coming of rave-culture
to the mainstream has nothing to do with diversity -- it has more to do
with scenesterism.

I heard that it was done by some British record collector who started the
whole thing in Europe by releasing a compilation of early Detroit tracks
under the name "the Techno Sound of Detroit." Which may have been Joey
Beltram, and may not.

Date of Hearing:  March 12, 1997


               ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS

                     Carole Migden, Chairwoman


               AB 6 (Bowler) - As Amended:  3/3/97 

 

Policy Committee:  Public Safety                Vote:  11 - 0


State Mandated Local Program:  YesReimbursable:  No    Urgency:   

Yes     


 SUMMARY


 This bill adds Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to the list of Schedule  

II controlled depressant substances.


Possession of Schedule II depressants is an alternate  

felony/misdemeanor (wobbler), punishable by 16 months, two, or  

three years in state prison or up to one year in county jail.  

Possession for sale is a felony, punishable by 16 months, two or  

three years in state prison. Sale, furnishing or transportation is  

a felony, punishable by two, three, or four years in state prison.  



 FISCAL EFFECT


1. Suspense. Unknown annual state costs - likely in excess of  

   $150,000 - for state prison incarceration. If only eight people  

   receive a state prison sentence, the first year cost will  

   exceed $150,000, while annual out-year costs will increase.  

   There are more than 6,000 persons serving state prison terms  

   for possession and possession for sale of Schedule II  

   substances. 


   (Similar legislation, (AB 2226, Bowler) to place the so-called  

   date-rape drug Rohypnol on the Schedule, was placed on the  

   Appropriations Suspense File in both houses last year.)

  

2. Unknown nonreimbursable mandated local costs for county jail  

   incarceration.  

 

BACKGROUND 


1. GHB is not currently restricted under California law. 


2. GHB is usually distributed as a liquid. Users mix the drug with  

   alcohol and/or combine it with other drugs. GHB has become  

   popular at "rave" parties in L.A. and the Bay Area. The  

   intended effect is an intense high lasting about two hours.  

   Effects can include sedation, nausea, respiratory depression  

   and arrest, coma and seizures.


   In December 1996, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration  

   reported at least three deaths related to GHB. 


3. If placed in the Schedule III or IV, the penalties would be  

   virtually the same as the penalties for Schedule II. The  

   schedule:

 

   I   High potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in  

       treatment in the U.S., and no accepted safety for use of  

       the drug or other substance under medical supervision.


   II  High potential for abuse with an accepted medical use in  

       the U.S. Abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical  

       dependence.


   III Less potential for abuse and an accepted medical use in the  

       U.S. Abuse may lead to moderate or low physical or high  

       psychological dependence.


   IV  Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule III, with an  

       accepted medical use in the U.S. Abuse may lead to limited  

       physical dependence or psychological dependence. 


   V   Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule IV with an  

       accepted medical use in the U.S. Abuse may lead to limited  

       physical dependence or psychological dependence.

I think more parties should have a smoker's room so that we're all happy.

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

 Well since one of the subjects recentley has been where does techno come
from where does this come from etc...I too wondered (and still do for any old
timers out there who are willing to share) I've done some looking, and for
any one interested here are some sites to check out:
http://www.slice.co.uk/  
Slice musicscape has interviews with alot of DJs from the old...
http://www.streetsound.com/hmhof/houintro73.html
Don't know if this one is still around but it 's stuff is taken from a book
they wrote awhile back called History of house music....

	As far as things changing, they have alot. But @ least we still have a
scene. And there are still some damn good parties. As far as alot of the
friends I started raving with they considered the scene dead back in 91-92
when went commercial. I remember when funky tekno was looked @ like Coolworld
is now. called sharon  When there were no raves they were only e-parties(and
didn't cost $20 and last 4 hours!=p~). IMOP the only thing all you old timers
and everyone else dissatisfied with the scene and missing the old days is
evolve....Open your mind to the new and changing scene. Or if that doesn't
work DYI as various people on this same list have  done over and over again. 
Give it up! or turn it loose......

Thank-you Sami. That was *exactly* my point.

When more and more raves all feel like Friday night at 1015 Folsom (and
more and more of them *do* feel that way, as the "scenesters" find a new
"scene" to hang out in, en masse, you'll know the gig is up.

What do I mean? Women dressed to the hilt who beg to be looked at, but the
second they notice someone looking at them, the scowl at you. Add to that,
testosterone-pumped "mustang 5.0" types guys posturing for the attention of
formerly-described women. Now add a *lot* of alcohol and dilute with
hundreds and thousands of suburban clubbers looking for "the next cool
thing."

If you want a better idea of what's about to stampede toward the beautiful
rave scene you all know and love, I suggest you hit any of the bay area's
"modern dance" clubs like The Edge, Sound Factory, The X, Palladium, etc.
etc. Get to know these people -- they're headed *your* way!

It ain't pretty, there's a whole lot more of "them" than "us", and they
don't particularly care to find out about the fundamentals of rave culture,
including, but not limited to "kindness" "PLUR" or even necessarily about
the music. I hung out in the club scene for almost a decade. It's about
drinking and cruising, and that's on a *good* night!

Now, once all the cattle are excited about "RAVE" picture this:

-------------------------

You know what I think though... 

At roswel, they supposidly found two ships. One destroyed, and the other
disabled.

I think the destroyed ship was a group of friendly renagade grey aliens
coming to warm us of something. And the disabled ships mission was to stop
them from compleating there objective.

Or it could be the other way around, and we have already been warned. 
Hmmm..

The comp you're referring to was on 10 records and came out in '89 or '90,
I believe. I want to say Neil Rushton did the track selection, but he was
with the Network label so I can't be sure. I'll pull it out and take a
look. There was another compilation merely titled 'Techno 1' on KMS from
Detroit in '89.

I've been trying to dig up references, so I'm not going to make any
definitive statements here, but it's my understanding that techno was
coined as a term back in '85 or '86, back around when the first Metroplex
and Transmat records were being released.  While these records definitely
fit the genre, I don't know that they were referred to as such
comtemporarily. I can think of a couple of mid-80's vintage
electro/proto-techno tracks with "Techno" in the title - "Techno City" for
example. I'm also aware of an LA based hip-hop/electro label that was
active in the early to mid '80s called Techno Hop. I've heard this was Dr.
Dre's label, but I haven't verified that.I doubt Joey Beltram coined the
term, however - I can't think of any records by him prior to '89, although
I don't know when his first Nu Groove records were released. He's also from
New York, not England.

in regards to this post I have to say that I feel I myself am a hybrid of
the rave/mall rat/mod/alt/a bunch of other stuff and I feel that I am just
tring to take the best from all the environments and situations that are
around me. I feel that I am at least a semi-inteligent open minded
individual and I have learned through experince that everthing seem to
have it's good and bad points which are constantly evolving because things
change in both positive and negative ways. Those of you who are leaving SF
raves because it's not what it once was or there is too much "NRR crap"
etc. concider what you are doing and why, change is the only constant in
life(at least for me) don't be afraid, if this passes you threshhold of

>> What DO  you do with a dead glow stick?

  I believe this item is on the list because of a text file that 
circulated from one of the rave mailing lists (socal?) that explained how 
to reactivate a lightstick.
  Whether it was a joke, or merely written by someone who had no clue 
what they were talking about is unknown, but it is bogus as written.

OKAY>>>
here's how to have an EVERLASTING GLOWSTICK!!!!
This includes a tad bit of villainous activity.
so don't do it. =o)

go to a dark place, such as a video arcade, movie theater, etc., etc. and
look for an EXIT sign. Evaluate the exit sign:

1. Is it black with glowing green letters?
2. Are there breaks between the lines in the letters?
3. Is the sign not plugged in?

If the answer to all three questions is yes... you are well on your way to
having EVERLASTING GLOWSTICKS. 

Chances are, the sign is planted in sheetrock, which will easily break away
after a bit of tugging and twisting. Find a discrete place to hold the sign
until you are away from the area.

Upon opening the casing of the sign, you will notice that there are
stickers stating that the signs are radioactive and you should not be
handling this without some sort of special license. Ignore this. The
radioactive chemicals are only exposed when the glass casing is broken,
which will also kill your everlasting glowstick. If broken open, the
chemical will make you smarter, effects may vary, so just in case, dont
break the glass.

The glass sticks are attatched to the sign with rubbery glue that peels
away, peel all that stuff off.

You now have not only 1 everlasting glowstick, but a set of 12 -count em'-
12 EVERLASTING GLOWSTICKS!!!

Now your youngen ravers in the year 12,048,384,543 AD will STILL be able to
use these glowsticks at their parties!!!

-much love

To the best of my knowledge, the word techno is actually an acronym, which
has the following expanded meaning:

Technology,
Ecstasy,
Creativity &
Harmony
Nurturing
Oneness

Love and good shit,

P.S. This Friday Minneapolis explodes, 12:00-1:00a, when the arduous

can't you put glowsticks in the freezer and then when you take 'em out the
next time they will be rejuvenated and work as they did before? that's
something that i've always been told but never done. i don't know.

as far as raving itself:

let them have their $35 massives.  i'll be at the cheap undergrounds.  that
scene will only die if we let it. i mean, those who find the rave scene
getting stale can create something fresh.  those who find it too commercial
can take it further underground.  and they DO.

we can be co-opted by the mainstream, or we can move on to something new.

OR we can "be our own gods" and create the scene we want.

which is what we've been doing all along.  it's still happening and i see
no reason why it has to stop.

now as far as sfraves-- the list _isn't_ underground, and it really can't
be.  in that sense, those of us who want to stay underground may have to
choose other forms of communication.

so perhaps rather than complaining about the direction of sfraves, we
should be (assuming that we love and desire to maintain the community that
we may be losing) thinking about how to recreate it in another place or
form or medium.

or perhaps, while we take raving further underground, we should maintain a
presence on this list-- surely if the masses flock to the list, there will
be _some_ of them who were meant to be (underground) ravers all along and
were just never exposed to the scene.  our being on sfraves as it "goes
mainstream" would allow us to expose these people to our idea(l)s.  even if
only a tiny percentage of the people who come to the rave scene end up
"getting it", that's still better than nothing.

in other words:  can't we BOTH keep the underground alive AND take
advantage of the commercialization of raving to spread the vibe to as many
people as possible?


love,

brian

It sounded so strange to me that I had to look it up on some
Sacramento media web pages...

Apparently this is associated with the bust of an escort service
called Chocolate and Vanilla.  The deceased is a former track star
named  Amy Sue Lofton.   Supposedly she had only been working for the
escort agency for 10 days when she died of an ecstacy overdose while
on a call.  More bizarre facts about this case can be found on the
KOVR and Sacramento Bee web pages.=20

  Not really, this just slows down the reaction between chemicals.  
However, if you have a 12 hr stick and you get it home quick enough, 
there's often quite a bit of life left.
  This is the reason why the diving sticks are so bright I think, they're 
designed to be used in the water which is fairly cold and slows down the 
reaction.
  If you want to regulate, you can place your glowstick in a small bottle 
of water of hot water to make it brighter or cold water to make it last...

 drinking and cruising, and that's on a *good* night!

And then what happened?

Did you drop "e" for the first time?
Did you suddenly stumble into an underground party?
Did someone drop a bomb on your head?
Did some kind of lightbulb go on?

With all respect, because I *do* share your exact same concerns, this "us"
and "them" polarity really reeeaaally gets under my skin.  What bugs me even
*more,* is the "run-for-the-hills-the-mainstream-is-coming" school of
histrionics that is so vocal on this list, and out there in the underground.
 It's such a defeatist attitude, and it's terribly pesimistic.  And it's
snobbery.  From what you just wrote, Wayne, you used to *be* one of "them!"
(Who wasn't?)  And who invited *you* to "our party?"

"WE" are not better than "THEM."  If we must act superior, can we just say
that we are "more enlightened" or "more mature."  I would find that a little
less grating.  But still patronizing.  "Different" would feel even better.
 Can "we" just be "different?"  Thank you.  =)

The best vibe on the dancefloor is a HUMBLE vibe.  IMHO.

To cop another kind of annoying phrase, "back in the day" things were
different because the scene was smaller.  Yes, *but*... in general, people
took more responsibility for it, too.  Newcomers were greeted with open arms,
no matter how clueless they seemed, and given an introduction, a sort of
"dis-orientation," by someone who was probably genuinely pleased to meet
them.  That kind of treatment works miracles.  Sometimes it actually changes
lives.  I bet there are many people on this list who will tell you it's
happened to "them."  

Maybe they don't care to "find out" about us.  Maybe we need to start telling
them.  There are a zillion ways to do this, even as we delve deeper
underground.   What happened to wanting to spread the news?

I know it's awfully optimistic.  But isn't optimism one of the hallmarks of
our scene?  I just can't stand all the whining.   We have a lot of unrealized
power and it would be nice if more people (myself included) toyed with that a
bit more before resorting to all this bitching and complaining.  It
accomplishes nothing, and I don't know about anyone else, but it's depressing
to "me."

Much love,
Claudia

PS - I love that Wayne is one of "us" now.  =)

gawd, yes!  =)

ok, i wasn't a clubber and i was very ripe for the rave scene...

but i wouldn't be here right now without the unconditional positivity and
love of an sfraver or two (hi matt, i love you!!!)...

there are people out there who are really caught up in the mainstream but
have a natural raver inside of them.

let's keep our arms open.


Love,

brian

hi everyone,

i'd like to share a case in point.  a few weeks ago i met a couple of
younger promoters (19 & 21, i'm 29 - soon to be 30 :) that were getting
ready to throw a big event with dj's from NYC, Raja from San Diego and a
bunch of other dj's.  they just happened to come over my house one night
and i had some taken some fungus so i was more open than usual and we all
partook together and had a great time.  well, i temporarily fell in love
with the 19 year old and got involved with the production.  about a week
later i got fired and these guys gave me so much love and support on all
levels it was amazing.  we went up to a party in seattle that some of my
frineds were throwing up there and we were handing out flyers.  my
boyfriend went to give one to someone and they said, "uh, that looks like
a rave, we don't go to raves we have spiritual gatherings."  so much for
his first introduction to the underground.

after he told me that i was just thinking if that person only knew the
intentions of my boyfriend, that he is one of the most loving, "spiritual"
persons i've ever met.  he has his own beliefs, primarily Christian and
completely lives his beliefs and doesn't talk too much about it.

i know the the comment that was made to him was a bit extreme, but it's
the same issue and i believe that "vibe" ( a term many of us have agreed
on) is found inside of us, everyone of us, and under the right
circumstances can be brought out in anyone.  (even my ex-husband, i'm sure
of it! :)

so, i'm simply sharing my thoughts with my friends as many of my friends
have shared their thoughts with me as i have delved into this scene, not
flaming anyone because i sincerley love you all.

be happy,

brenda :)

Justin, 

You're a little bit sick.

Try buying regular glowsticks and sticking 'em in the freezer at the end of

I've done it and it does slow down the reaction a lot, so if you take it
out and
warm it up in the next few days it will still have some glow left.

Not much you can do with a dead glowstick.  Due to that, and the fact that
one can't
always get glowsticks when one needs them, I have sought and found (or
built) alternatives.

You can get small battery-powered fluorescent lamps at any large hardware
store.
Most of the camping ones are too bulky, but there is a kind that seems to
be intended
for closets that takes AA batteries (lots of them) and is quite small and
takes a size bulb
which are also available in blacklights.   You end up with a
battery-powered blacklight
that is about a foot long and about 1 1/4" in diameter.   The downside is
that a set of
batteries will last a few hours at most.   I had a pair of these at Harmony 3.

For a more permanent light source, LEDs are hard to beat, and they are
available
in all colors now (though red is still cheapest and most efficient).   A
pair of AA
nicads can power a red LED for about 3 days continuously.

I have built these into wands, using the LEDs to illuminate a crystal on
the end.
They have long been my favorite dancetoys.

Everything necessary to make them (except the crystal) can be had from the
hardware store and Radio Shack.

Indeed, perhaps ironically, Wayne himself was this person for me.  Wayne was
the one who dragged me out to play for the first time (I had only been to
one other rave before, Wayne was the first person to drag me out of my
net.shell to go out again) , as I was new to raving (11/95) and newish to
the list (9/95), he emailed me and said "come out and play!"  And so I did.
:)  Wayne has done his share of "open-arming" too!

I'm an internet nincompoop!  I've been clicking on websites for 45 minutes
and all I can find is gay chat rooms in Wisonsin and The Scene in Norway (?!)  

How do I find Wisconsin-area rave mailing lists?

Hello,


At this point I feel that I must make a request.  Please define the word =
that everyone uses to describe this thing we have: by this I mean =
community.  I would look upon as a personal favor to me if everyone who =
cares about the scene and wants to keep it strong would post their =
thoughts on what they envision as the "scene".  Tell me what you want in =
terms of a community.  What does the rave scene mean to you?  What do =
you take from it and what do you give to it?  With that thought.....

I see the rave scene as a place where I can express some of the thoughts =
and feelings that I do not feel the freedom to express else where.  I =
see it as a place where I can meet new people who won't come at me with =
strange pre-dispositions or prejudices.  I see it as a group of people =
who, although they may not have met each other before, can express true =
friendship with everyone they meet.  People can show the love and =
affection that is sorely missing from our society today.  THIS IS GOOD!  =
What I get from raving, I give to it.  My favorite parts are the =
friendships I have made with all of the beautiful people I have met.  =
What pains me most, and what I see as being the "lack of community" that =
some speak of, is that fact that there are too many lurkers on this =
list; more simply, people need to get to know each other.  I wish that I =
could say that I know everyone on this list.  Unfortunately, this is not =
true.  If you want a real community, well then lets really form one.  We =
all share something special that most other people don't know yet.  That =
alone should bring us together. =20
	Some people have also been speaking of the gradual  commercialization =
of the scene and dilution of the general vibe.  I am definitely against =
the commercialization of the scene, however, I would wish that all =
people could see the scene as I do and understand what I get from it.  =
The Underground  is by definition a slightly elitist society, but the =
vibe is one for all people.  If people want to keep the Underground =
pure, that's fine with me, but let the vibe out in to the world.   It is =
for all.  The reality is that there are too many people for one to form =
close ties with EVERYONE.  We all cannot bring EVERYONE into the scene =
as we know it.  All we can do is let them know how we as a community =
feel about each other, in hopes that they will do the same with their =
friends and whomever that meet.  Repeat ad infinitum, and you have =
spread the vibe like a plague of friendship.

	I realize I'm being a tad idealistic, but tell me what you want?  I'll =
do my bit to help if I can.  :)

<3   <3         <3            <3

as far as raving itself:

let them have their $35 massives.  i'll be at the cheap undergrounds.  =
that
scene will only die if we let it. i mean, those who find the rave scene
getting stale can create something fresh.  those who find it too =
commercial
can take it further underground.  and they DO.

we can be co-opted by the mainstream, or we can move on to something =
new.

OR we can "be our own gods" and create the scene we want.

which is what we've been doing all along.  it's still happening and i =
see
no reason why it has to stop.

now as far as sfraves-- the list _isn't_ underground, and it really =
can't
be.  in that sense, those of us who want to stay underground may have to
choose other forms of communication.

so perhaps rather than complaining about the direction of sfraves, we
should be (assuming that we love and desire to maintain the community =
that
we may be losing) thinking about how to recreate it in another place or
form or medium.

or perhaps, while we take raving further underground, we should maintain =
a
presence on this list-- surely if the masses flock to the list, there =
will
be _some_ of them who were meant to be (underground) ravers all along =
and
were just never exposed to the scene.  our being on sfraves as it "goes
mainstream" would allow us to expose these people to our idea(l)s.  even =
if
only a tiny percentage of the people who come to the rave scene end up
"getting it", that's still better than nothing.

in other words:  can't we BOTH keep the underground alive AND take
advantage of the commercialization of raving to spread the vibe to as =
many
people as possible?

okay, I've switched over my list subscriptions to my new address, so 
everything should be groovy....

Anybody needing to get ahold of me should send EMAIL to this 'new' 
address and just forget my old ucdavis.edu address (they finally figured 
out that I graduated, so the account is dead)

See you all soon!

In general, if you are looking for information on raves in places other
than San Francisco/Bay Area, try these URL's:

http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/grid/
"GRID" is the Global Rave Information Database and should contain info
about upcoming events from all over.

http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/
This page has links to all the regional rave archives/lists that reside on
hyperreal -- another good starting point if you want to know if anything
is going down where you're headed.

Hope this helps,

Hmmm, interesting... now, how does this work? I think people like sending
out a nick name, or a 'tag' (i.e. PEN PAL) to see how quickly this spreads
across the world, and how long it stays in circulation.

The forwarding of these 'virus alerts' IS the virus, taking up space on
everybodies hard drive, and distressing users new to the internet.

Or... possibly someone had recieved this message, then accidentally deleted
c:\ tree rather than emptying their trash?

If this is a true virus, will somebody please send it to me, because i
would like to see just how a text message is capable of deleting my hard
drive.

P.S.:
VIRUS ALERT!!!!
There is a virus on the internet. this is REAL!!! If the URL display in
your browser read "http://www.chosen.org" LEAVE IMMEDIATELY!!! It will
delete your frown!!!

Someone just forwarded:

Hmmm, interesting... now, how does this work? I think people like =
sending
out a nick name, or a 'tag' (i.e. PEN PAL) to see how quickly this =
spreads
across the world, and how long it stays in circulation.

The forwarding of these 'virus alerts' IS the virus, taking up space on
everybodies hard drive, and distressing users new to the internet.

Or... possibly someone had recieved this message, then accidentally =
deleted
c:\ tree rather than emptying their trash?

If this is a true virus, will somebody please send it to me, because i
would like to see just how a text message is capable of deleting my hard
drive.

P.S.:
VIRUS ALERT!!!!
There is a virus on the internet. this is REAL!!! If the URL display in
your browser read "http://www.chosen.org" LEAVE IMMEDIATELY!!! It will
delete your frown!!!

Juan Atkins started calling it "techno" in part because of the influence
of Alvin Toffler's "Future Shock."  But even before that there was a 
track by Yellow Magic Orchestra called "Technopolis" (1981) and perhaps
others.

I thought darrele had some good observations.  I actually enjoyed the
SHJ show in Portland pretty much, but I'd agree about the rock-oriented
beats -- much more prevalent than on the recorded stuff I've heard.
But then once again the Chems are the trailblazers to mass market
glory, ain't they . . .

  For the most part, these email virus alerts are bogus.
  However, there is one real macro virus that uses microsoft mail I =
believe, since attachments are automatically executed in their =
respective programs, including word (with a well know macro virus =
'problem').
  You can probably find out about this on microsoft's page, I'm not =
sure.  It is definately on macafee (macaffee?) 's web page, and maybe =
other virus protection pages...

How about this... if it wasn't called Techno what could we call it?

Here are a few I can think of:

fusion
electrobeat
speed

I've had vertigo for the last 3 days. It's strange.

I can definitely identify with wayne feelings about the changes
in the scene and on the list.
It seems like the people on this list are getting younger, or
maybe its just that I'm getting older.  This isn't neccessaryly
a negative.  Its just that I find with an older group there are 
people who have taken more time in their lives to consciously 
develop and enhance their spirituality. 
I am thankful that there are people here and at partys that value
their spirituality at all.  For me that sence of spirituality has
been the essence of raves.
I enjoyed dancing before I found the rave scene, and I will continue
to enjoy it for whatever changes that may occur. 
 I love music and will continue to appreciate the joy of sharing  
that love of music and hopefully others will join in.  And if others
don't, I'll try my best not to get disappointed by it, and continue to
enjoy it for at least myself and hopefully more.
Hopefully I will continue to learn how to feel and find that sence of 
connectedness that we all share in other ways besides music.

Thank you to all of you who share your joy of the music no matter
what changes you experience at raves.

I remember one of my first times at a party..I didn't know a thing and 
was a little bit lost.

I was wandering around- looking at the lasers...

when this girl comes out of nowhere, sits me down and gives me the best 
massage, a hug and a smile.

and suddenly, I wasn't lost anymore.

...good morning hardsteppas (and to all you techsteppas out there)...

...as i was coming home from work last night, i thought i felt another
earthquake...possibly a 3.5...upon closer inspection, it's was just big ol'
KING KONG himself, shakin' his fat hairy butt at the CW Saloon and causing
all sorts of commotion...

...i got there around 10ish and saw about five people in the place groovin'
to some badass techstep...two of which were Jonathan aka "Mudfoot" and Foo
(sp?)...they told me that it was dj slider on the decks...slider continued
to warm up the crowd which was growing to about 15 or so crazzzy jungle
junkies on a wednesday night....during slider's set, mudfoot mentioned that
their special guests the 119 cru (that's eleven-nine cru to you baby) were
on their merry way and plan to go on around 12..."these guys are gonna fuck
shit up" he says...

...next up was none other than mudfoot himself who was throwin' down some
phattyboombatty hardstep cuts to get the small crowd goin'...and it worked
(for me anyways)...i danced and jerked and twitched throughout his whole
set...this guy was smooth like a mudslide on the tec 12's...

...finally, big ol' hairy ass KING KONG dropped the mother of bigass
bombs...the 119 cru straight outta the socal brotherhood and the LA
junglists...the frontmen were golgo 13 (one of my favorite manga
characters), heretic, and MC leroy brown...the set started more on a
hip-hop tip as golgo 13 and heretic tagteamed the tec 12's...for the next
two hours, these bombass cut re-creators spun some of the hardest jungle
tracks around while they flawlessly layered some scratches over the
tracks..in other words, they FUCKED SHIT UP...man i was in jungle
heaven...can anybody say hop n' bass?...if anybody hears that these guys
are coming down again, by all means, go and check em' out...

...unfortunately, i had to leave around 1:30am but i managed to score a
copy of the 119 cru california drumandbass CD out on Sub Base usa...all
good...

...til' next time, gotta get myself a big ol' cup of hot steamin cup o'
java to wake my sleepy asszzzzzzzselfzzzzzzz...

Talk about oxymorons.

I wonder when we will learn that the press is as much an enemy to all of
this as a friend.

Learn  the lessons of history or relive past mistakes.

Just wanted to post a quick review about Freaky last night in Berkeley.
It was a total blast, especially for us locals.  Pasand Lounge is set up
really nice and they have a great sound system. It's defintely plush
left-overs from the disco years. My roommate loved the very
70ish columns around the dance floor.  They were so funky!

The music was great, although I didn't get to hear Freaky Chakra.  It was
such a relaxed vibe with people boogeying and looking terrifically pleased
to have this event happen.  A nice sized crowd showed up.  Enough to fill
the dance floor.

If this happens again, I highly recommend going.  It's a nice atmosphere
to meat people, and it sure would be nice to have a weekly in the East
Bay.  Plus, everyone there was so nice :)

Thanks to everyone who put this together :)

King Kong last night was great. I got there pretty early and stayed till
they turned on the lights. Slider and Mudfoot got everyone going to a high
pitch. There was a bit at the beginning of Mudfoot's set with some vocal
sample "dub plate" that was over the top. What is that track? Then the 119
Crew came on and did *way* more than just crossfade from one turntable to
the other. Excellent.

The crowd was a bit thin, which makes me think of all you who were either
missing a good time or having one at FREEkey. :) When there are too many
appealing things in one knight, I guess jungle will tip the scales for me.

Terrence.

I'm new to the group, but I have to say the vibe is great here!  I'm
in SLO, and found this group off the hyperreal link....

I went to my fist party in November of last year (Seismic threw it
in Los Osos, near SLO) in some large tents outside-it went until 8am when
the cops shut it down) but I knew then I'd found a new home.  The
friendliness, hospitality, acceptance, and the bass.  It was one of the
greatest experiences of my life.  But anyway, I am posting because
I have a question:  Do any of you know if there has ever been a live
webcast / internet broadcast of a rave or party yet?  The software
company I work for sent some av guys to the last local party we had 
(aXess, thrown by eMOTION-Rico from SF spun) and we cybercasted it-at least
until the cops shut it down at 3.  We think it might have been the
first live webcast of a rave.  It was hot! 

It is available for viewing via our free plug in (www.xingtech.com, 
follow the streamworks now links) to download your player.   Then 
run the application (outside your browser) and under File, Open Stream
paste

xdma://206.126.224.10/axess/axess.mpx

If you are on a 28.8 modem be patient... its not a download and play
its a stream, but you won't get a lot of video frames per second.  But
anyone on an ISDN or at work can get near full motion video.  Some 
parts are hard to see (obvious lighting challenge) but let me know what
you think.  I am working on making the MPEG available...

keep upthe vibe,
And turn up the bass!

Geoff

Actually, it was Walter Carlos who invented it, but after Wendy's "how to
make a vagina from a penis" interview in Playboy in the mid 70's,  she got
rid of everything that had belonged to Walter, including musical talent and
inspiration.

But now she regrets some of her actions of the past (hormonal imbalances
leading to rash decisions) and is going to do all of Beethoven's late
quartets, including the Grosse Fugue, on a 303, overdubbing each part on
tape  separately, using only the built in sequencer on the 303 and running
a click off an 808 for syncing purposes.

So the 303 is far from being "finished" as a sound source in modern music.

If you can't say what you need to say with a 909 and a 303, you are
probably a member of the ruling class with vested interests in the
oppression of all free spirits and, of course, the TRUTH ...

The great thing is that all we need is _one_ chord  now ...

I guess I'll wait for the meds to kick in before I post again .... :)

Why even trip on what "they" are doing or What "That thing" is all about.  Its not like you can, 
or are willing to, do anything to change it, so why even give it any thought, or estrablish a 
conection.  

apart from the music, what does raving have to do with clubing anyways??  All because "they" 
play tecno does not make it a rave, nor does it make it underground.

Don't forget that Music and dancing are afterall the most obvious componenets of 
"Entertainmnet".   That is what people want, weather it is 'us' or 'Them'  it does not matter, 
"WE" all just want to have a good time, meet interesting people, express ourselves, and have 
fun.

Whats so "not pretty" about this?  It sounds like a blast.  I would go in a heartbeat.  Were 
else can you see this type of soughtafter musical talent all on one stage.  It sounds beautiful.  
I would even pay $50 to go or more.  

And what does it matter who sponsers it?  As long as it is hapening, Who cares if it is a radio 
station, or an independent producer.  What diference is it going to make to any of us in the 
long run.  Music and Fun does not have to be as political as we make it out to be.

Lets not get so involved in the little thinks that we overlook the big picture.

Keep it real

I agree.

I am going to sleep out if I have to to see two of my favorite groups on
the same stage (The Prodigy and Chemical Bros). That is going to be a good
show. 

I missed the Chemical Bros when they were here last. Their new album "Dig
your own hole" is going to be good I bet. Has anyone heard any of it??

Who I would REALLY like to see is UNDERWORLD. They are so good.

England has produced so many good bands. All my favorites are from there.
What is it? Hmmm....

I went to both events last night in SF, first to King Kong.  It was a bar
atmosphere, pretty well lit, with a small dancefloor and stage where the
dj's were tearing it up.  There were about a dozen people, all but two or
three were sitting on a ledge thing around that area.  A couple of guys had
a laptop on the stage and were doing something, but I didn't see a ricochet
modem so it couldn't have been 'too' fun :) <wink>  I seriously admired the
mixing skill of the unknown dj.. thin guy, long hair, happy - whoever he
was he was doing it right.  But something didn't feel right for me, and I
thought about noel, etc at step2k.. so I left and headed over.
At step2k the atmosphere was _very_ different.  It was a bar sort of place
too, but darker, and laid out differently, the bar (read: light) was up
front, and by moving back through the narrow long room you got to several
sets of speakers and the dj..  it was warmer, and carpeted.. with a few
blacklights in various spots..  almost all of the several dozen (perhaps as
many as 50) people where moving, and there were some people who could
DANCE, oh my ghod.. and I thought I was something :) :)  There were some
girls that simply blew my mind, unbelievable steppers, and these two guys
who must have been born dancing - maybe smooth ninja breakdancers?  How
else to describe.. but hey that's the kind of energy jungle inspires..
washing synth and smooth jazzy vocals over a deep in your face bass - wow
that bass was soooo nice !
uhm, hehe.. probably getting carried away.  Anyway I'm glad I went to both,
and _really_ glad I went to step2k.
love
Max

Hey all -

I just wanted to thank everyone who came out for King Kong last night -
thanks especially for the cool sfrave reviews!  The 119 Crew had a great
time, and my head kept exploding repeatedly from the crazy battle
techniques of Heretic and Golgo 13!  These guys are incredible, they
tag-teamed for 2 hours, they dropped VIP mixes on dubplate, they scratched
like mad Q-Bert style, and they even dropped their own original tune, which
samples Too Short!  When they come back, don't sleep - these guys are the
bomb.  Watch out for their CD, "California Drum and Bass" available this
Friday on Suburban Base Records - I'm listening to it now and it's tight.
All I can say is, we're going to see some serious growth in the jungle
scene in 97 - it's happening right now, right here in the Bay Area.

NEXT WEEK: King Kong Rides Again, Wednesday March 19th at 10pm, with
Slider, Mudfoot, and special guests TBA - call the hotline for info: (415)
276-8549

ALSO: Wendesday March 26th, King Kong is proud to bring you DJ E-SASSIN
(AKA EPSILON) from LA, spinning crazy dark techstep, including his own
original records and unreleased dubplates.

 Peace from the King Kong crew - Mudfoot and Slider

Strongly disagree.  A strong component of the rave scene as long
as I have been in touch with it has been community values including
self-sufficiency, personal creative and intellectual expression, and
environmental consciousness.

It is a double edged sword, fame.  On the one hand, most of us are
happy to see artists whom we respect become more widely recognized.
On the other hand, the media spotlight and the machinery of fame
are decidedly at odds with the values mentioned above.

However, I am going to stop short of telling anyone what I think
they should do in light of this information, since that's what starts
flamewars.  I would suggest that anyone with a thought on this subject
should try to frame it in terms of what their community means to them
(in real terms, not just the PLUR mantra) and how the surging interest
in the scene is or is not compatible with their values.

Perhaps PLUR should be temporarily amended to "Patience Love Unity Respect"

Peace,
Scott

Brilliant post, Claudia.  I completely agree with you, and I also relate 
to how Wayne (a wonderful friend of mine) feels.   Evolution and change 
of ANYTHING is inevidable.  To try and go against what *IS* is 
impossible, stressful and depressing.  It is like trying to dam up a 
river by standing in the middle of it - it is just going to push against 
you and possibly knock you over. Isn't it easier to ride the current?  
You may not like the direction the river takes you, but there are little 
coves and tributaries in which to lurk off into (meaning underground 
parties).

The scene may not be exactly what you want it to be as more and more 
people become introduced, but you can be comforted to know that there are 
others out there who share your vision as to what the scene should be 
like and they throw the raves you attend.  So what if raving becomes the 
next trendiest thing?  I will still have parties like Warmth and 
Koinoneia to attend.  

I keep thinking of situations at raves where newcomers and 
"old-schoolers" alike exclaim how they wish the whole world could 
experience the positiveness of a rave - to feel the wonderfulness and 
love and spiritual energy that they do.  Hell, I wished that too!  And 
now that it looks like more and more of the general public *IS* being 
exposed to what we wanted them to be exposed to and WE ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT 
IT!!  Ever heard that phrase, "Be careful what you wish for, you just 
might get it?" 

I just say, as someone who has been in the scene since 1992 and has seen 
alot, to just go with it.  Nothing has happened yet and the same concerns 
were there 4 years ago that are here today.  Newcomers keep the scene 
fresh.  My new boyfriend just started raving 6 months ago and now he is 
planning on throwing his own party in September.  The newcomers keep 
things fresh, and re-open the eyes of people like me who need reminding 
every once in a while.

love,
Amy

I just wanted to add a little something to this that i learned in a class
at school. In this class we discuss a variety of issues, many of which are
highly inflammatory and emotionally charged. In the first class session we
layed down some ground rules to our discussion so as to promote honest,
positive and fruitful discussions, one of the ground rules that i think is
most important in a discussion is to focus on <what> is said and not <who>
said it, i hope that this makes sense to some of you in the context of
this discussion and maybe we can all sort of use this as a framework when
replying to and discussing emotional issues. towards a peaceful future =)
love tony

Hello everyone!
	Just a Quick intro : My name is Ed I'm 23 and 8 weeks ago I left
England(u.k.) and my job in the corporate world  to come and be an Au
Pair in San Jose. I only knew my host family so I thought a good way to
make friends would be to find some loving ravers ;) I found hypereal and
cloud factory( where I met Jenn and Big-O) to start off with and that led
me here. I wanted to wait a little longer before I posted anything out of
respect for those already on the list but I really want  to go to
condensation this saturday after going to New Hope - my first American
gathering. (I was the guy with the prism spex . and love to every one I
met) Getting to the point of all this I need a ride to S.F on saturday as
my host family is none too keen for me to drive their *loverly* family
car to the city and leave it ther all night. The other problem which
prevents me from getting the train is, they are going to a hockey match
so I can't leave the house/children ( 3yrs and 9 weeks btw.) until about
10.30pm , when they return. I live  on Calico ave.    nr. the corner of
camden and bascom.
If I cant get a ride I'll probably jog , as I think you'll still be going
by the time I get there. 
Yours hopefully
love Ed
P.s. I'd love to meet anyone in my area as I'd love to have friends to
hang out with.

I think that we can have many kinds of "raves" . We can have small
parties
that are for a certain type of person with certain preferences and we
can have huge gatherings so we can meet and learn from each others
differences...like the old tribal societies.


more variety for a better society

You got it all wrong man. If you wouldn't pay $35 or however much it's    
going to cost to see good bands then you really don't like the bands 
involved. These are all big name bands who are extremely talented. If 
you'd rather pay $10 to see someone else mix these band's songs then 
that's *your* choice. Don't put us down because we think it's worth it to
see these bands live.

Great! While all you punters are drooling over MTV's latest marketing
gimick, and suffering the financial equivalent of anal rape (let's be
ralistic, that party would cost closer to 50 bucks), I'll be at the 10
dollar underground sweatin' my ass of to some hard trance....that ACTUAL
TECHNO, kids, not Nine inch Nails, and Winger with turntables....

I think that now EVERY SINGLE PERSON who was at King Kong last night has now 
posted about it....all 5 of us.  j/k there were a few more people there, but 
the crowd was low density to be sure.

Started the evening out at Hamburger Mary's for some drinks pinball and dinner 
with several friends.  Afterwards, I took them to the Covered Wagon for King 
Kong around 10.  Super thin crowd, and they were tired, so they left right 
away.  I stayed on, and parked myself on top of one of the bass bins for 
awhile, grooved on the bass riffs hooks and snare patterns, then danced 
briefly, then left around 12:15.  

On the way home, around 12:30, I stopped by Wish to check it out.  IMO, the 
perfect sized crowd.  The music got me fired up to dance, which I had wanted to 
do all night but which wasn't really happening at KK.  And even though it's a 
little cubby, I gotta say I love the song Keep On Dancin', and the way the DJ 
mixed it up.  Also, I got a huge charge from the crowd that was there; many 
many happy faces and hi-energy dancing.  Finally left at 2, got to work today 
at 6:30, and boy does today suck!

The night definitely satiated the dance monster within, who rises up about 
every ten days and must be fed or he attacks and rots the core of the spirit

Bye folks

i turned on free radio berkeley a bit before 5:30 this evening and they
were playing some interesting music...  i heard some trip-hop, some Brian
Eno...

and then, just before 5:30, they played an Indian-music-sounding tune with
acoustic strings and a lite, fast unmistakably _jungle_ beat.

it was a wonderful piece of music.  any guesses as to the artist?  (they
said the name.  it sounded Indian but i couldn't really make it out.)


tia,

brian

The calendar looks extra phat this week, with four events Friday and
*nine* events on Saturday (not even counting the weeklies).  A lot of them
look good too, so there's no excuse (except perhaps indecision from too many
choices!) not to go out this weekend.  I've been getting much info from
all directions this week, so thanks go out to all of you for keeping the 
list full!

  <\\__  Hi
    |
I'm leaving for Japan in two days, mostly Tokyo area, for a two-week stay.

Does anyone know if there are raves in Japan? If so, how does one find
them? 

No use cluttering the list mailboxes on this, so feel free to reply
privately (within the next two days).

Domo arigato!

I may be able to give you a clue on the Indian-sounding jungle tune you
heard... there's a few of those around, one is on Dropbeat Records (the
label is owned by the store), and it's very cool.  Only their 2nd or 3rd
release I think.  The other tune I heard that matchess the description is
by a group called "Sounds of Bengal" or something?  I've seen it at
Soundworks in the city.

howdy,

so, after tormenting myself trying to make the perfect laminate (i drew
soooooooo many little designs with different phrases and different ways to
incorporate SFRaves, etc.) i finally just decided to go try the laminating
machine and, POW, now ive got my very own sfraves laminate. while it is not
one of the familiar, easily recognized ones, i sure hope some of you will
spot it and come say, "hi, im on the list too." and get a hug or something. 

and if you like it ill make you one too! and if you dont, well, you still get
a hug ;-)

see you soon, well not too soon, cuz ive got a big nasty genetics exam:-(
   wish me luck.

hugs and happy hopping,

jeremy

The one thing that I do know about the parties in japan is that they don't even use flyers very 
much to promote.  They pass around 'flopy flyers' or do everything online through mailinglists 
and web sites.  I have seen some flopy flyers a few years ago, and wanted to do one but the 
costs were to high then, and now, with everyone having nett acces, it is no longer practicle to 
hand out diskc or cd's when you can just hand out your web address.  But back to the point, if 
you do get a chance to grab some of the lates Japaneese Rave Promo or anything like that, mabee 
you can bring it back and share it with us on the list.  I know I would certainly be interested.

Have a great time.

Keep it real

Based on the knee-jerk flames I found in my mail box tonite, It seems many
of you see raving as entertainment.

I see it as community.

Entertainment is going to Shoreline Ampitheater to be "entertained."

Community is making something happen with your close friends in a living
room, warehouse, field or beach.

Too bad so many of you are unconsciously aligned with consumer culture --
it probably means you're missing the real magic of raving.

You don't "buy" it from BASS. You make it.

Go down to Roppongi and you'll find people at major intersections handing
out flyers for techno clubs... You may even want to go to the Liquid Room
and see what's up.

Wayne: exactly.

>You don't "buy" it from BASS. You make it.

so who is going to stop us from "making it?"  BASS?  the club kids?

they _can't_ stop us.  we create the vibe, we create the scene.

they can co-opt our music, they can co-opt anything they want.  that
doesn't mean we have to join them or disappear.

this community is not an inanimate object.  it is not even a being born
once and left to live and die.

it is _constantly_ being created and new life breathed into it.

Friends and Family, Koinonea, Rebel Alliance.  until people like these stop
deciding to create, the underground rave scene will live.

i'm not sure what your original post was trying to say:  was it a prophecy
of doom for the rave scene, or was it merely a warning that we must keep
creating?

the way i see it, a cynical, fatalistic "the scene is going to die"
attitude is to an extent a self-fulfilling prophecy.  on the other hand, if
we are aware that "You make it", meaning each and every one of us through
our attitudes and through our efforts, our community will live.

if anything, commercialized "raves" will simply draw those who don't wish
to contribute to our community out of it, while perhaps helping to bring
those who to wish to contribute into it.

i am not flaming you, i am merely trying to understand the apparent
contradiction between your cynicism and the positive, "You make it"
attitude that i have always considered you a proponent of.

please do clarify, rebutt, or respond as you see fit.

love,

brian

	There is a large degree of separation between the two as well.
There are a lot of free parties going on, put on by people who like to get
people together. One morning, I stuck around to help tear down speakers
and found that I kind of liked moving big speakers around and learning a
little about these things that make a lot of noise, but what I liked more
was talking with people and hanging out when I could hear what people were
saying or laughing about. And working with people gave me some type of
sense of who they were, what they were good at and so on and so forth.

> Entertainment is going to Shoreline Ampitheater to be "entertained."

	There is something weird in a world where one has to spend money
in order to "have fun". But then, I really cannot remember the last free
or under $10 underground (oops, no, sorry last I remember was Resolution). 
So maybe there is reason for this mass of people would want to be
"entertained".

> Community is making something happen with your close friends in a living
> room, warehouse, field or beach.

	I do not care if they are close friends, or people that I have
never met before - community is making something happen with the people
around you. Close friends come over a longer period of time as I get to
know people better, not just in a party setting, so I cannot say community
is about my close friends (but then, as I have moved into working full
time in the software world, my "close" friends get farther away, I guess
that's something I need to work on). And I do not feel right about saying
that community should be about my close friends because, it seems that
that closes out a lot of people that I have considered to be part of my
community, people I have worked with but have not spent much time with
outside of parties for one reason or another), maybe it's that commute I
which I would really like to shorten....

> Too bad so many of you are unconsciously aligned with consumer culture --
> it probably means you're missing the real magic of raving.

	One point here: its a magic of raving that some of attribute the
"expereince" of raving to. It's what I got out of raving (and for some
stupid reason, might be letting slip away because I cannot find a house
with enough room to store a sound system and be in a price range I can
afford, that isn't going to go surfing down a hill any closer than San
Jose. Ooops typical dave aside, sorry, back to the subject at hand). And
somehow some of us were swayed, like Wayne was. I was. Maybe those of us
who were swayed should ask ourselves why people are no longer swayed. What
is it that we are not doing?
	Maybe the "new" underground will shed some light on this, because
it seems the old underground has lost it...


> You don't "buy" it from BASS. You make it.

	And people made it. There was a beach party a couple weeks ago I
believe that people put together. Though I didn't really understand the
comment "I cannot believe this is free" - what else is a beach party?!

something related that I have been thinking about today, a friend was
going through my collection of .25 cent records and found an old woodstock
record, we got to talking about what happened to that scene and all the
ideals and momentum that movement had, why is it that that movement seems
dead to us? I realized that with woodstock2,  the whole thing
was officially dead and buried. the hippies sold out. But that is just
what I see on the surface. And that is what brings us to the main
question. What was the hippie movement all about? Why is SO much of a
movement defined by its music? Why is it that it is so hard to seperate
our community from the music we share together? Could it be that an
important step in our logic may be to make a distinction between the music
and the community. Honestly, I feel that even this is inadequate, Because
even in some big raves/parties/conceerts/<pick any (human social
event)=(any time you are not alone)> something called community can
happen. And I think that this is what is really important. We all see how
hard it gets to create a vibe the bigger and bigger a crowd gets. gee, why
is it that government and corporations usually suck so much? This is what
I feel is at the heart of so many of our social problems, no one really
knows how to get along. What I see as beautiful in the underground is
safe spaces created where we all can get along, with the hope that some
how we can learn to take some of this into the real world with us. I dont
see this hope dying out anytime soon, therefore I have no fear that the
underground will ever go away. But we need to know how to move beyond.
Learn how to constantly challenge ourselves to share what we find
while keeping it real. 
	What I am curious about is what has been
going on in the interim between the explosion in the sixties, and now
when we are experiencing something that feels similar. Or could it be just
living in the bay area makes one feel as if there were a renaissance in
motion. My experiencing with living most of my life on the east coast is
that there are ALOT, MANY, TREMENDOUS amount of unaware people...just
living a routine, desperate to keep their heads above water, or if not
always working, constantly being washed by the tv or some other device. 
but then again, this could just be my own cynicism coming out, maybe they
are just waiting for something real to come into their lives? Just asleep
until...???more questions than answers...tony

Bull Shit! 
The scene is completly alive! We are all living proof. The fact that
sfravers are so incredbily nice and lovable. SF is highly regarded on
the west coast as being the best. LA ravers would die for an SF Rave. I
went to OZ in LA. Everyone was saying how wonderful it was that an
actual SF raver wnated to rave in LA. They all wanted to come up here,
they kept telling us.

The scene is not dead. The scene may be falling, but that's as far as it
will ever go. True, it is falling, but it will NEVER hit bottom. We have
such a positive energey here in the underground portion of the rave
scene. A lot of massives may be lost to commercialization, but the
underground knows whats up!

I don't know about you, but I still have some faith in the scene. It may
be total crap now to some people. It may be falling. We can look at the
positive side of the scene falling!

What's so positive about the scene falling?

VIBE FILTERING!

Hopefully the scene will just blow up, and at the end we will see who
the people that are left standing are, and we can all start anew in a
better way. A more secret way. A even more underground way!
Once the scene goes overboard where (like in England) raves are illegal,
it will filter out all the bad vibes. Massives will be just as massive,
yet the flyers will be smaller or it may be word of mouth. COOL WORLD
will be forced to make smaller flyers (magazines) if they want to make
any money. Locations will get better and promoters will really really
really start to keep it underground.

I can't wait for that to happen. It will better our scene so much.
And I will be there in the new scene with everyone else.

Luvs&Hugs,
Paul

The only problem with this Vibe Filtering stuff, is, is that cool older school
people who *know* what it can be like, and can spread that knowledge, those 
seeds if you will, may get cut off too, just because they only go out once
in a while, because they've learned to be very selective.  Get my drift?

Could be Talvin Singh... he has a nice little jungle album out called

Nice piece.

I went to Japan a few years ago. I think Japan is the one place where
I've never heard about raves happening there. Mostly I think cuz the
populace is pretty law abiding, ie not much in the way of underground or
illegal activities. And space is so valuable that there isn't many
places to be able to pull off a party. But the club scene is cool. And
the people are nice enough so it does have a vibe nontheless. I also
recomend SEGA owned arcades. They fucking rule there!!!!!!

Now SF Weekly is running excerpts of a new novel, "Ecstacy Club"
which takes places in the SF rave scene.  It's on page 36 for those of
you in a hurry.

David

P.S.  ABC continues to run anti-drug shows, right now there's an
expose on pot growers.  Whenever they have an anti-drug "expert" on ,
it always seems to me that they're making the opposite point and not
realizing it.  Also, it appears that the
smoke-a-joint-and-lose-your-license law is about to end in Cal.  It
expired on Feb 28 and the only thing left to do is for the legislature
to pass a resolution repudiating the law in order to gain access to
federal highway funds (oh, the irony!).  The alternatives would be
renewing the provision, or losing the money (the federal government
requires states to pass smoke-a-joint laws or pass resolutions against
the provision in order to gain access to highway funds).

I see it as a good place for me to move crack. (humor)

>Entertainment is going to Shoreline Ampitheater to be "entertained."

Well.. I must say that I seek to be entertained at raves.  These days,
I find watching the dj's pretty entertaining.  Either I'm getting old, 
or no- maybe its just...too many kids try to sell me shrooms.  
That shit just gets tiring.
I also look for kids that can breakdance.  That's pretty entertaining.
(no, I'm not trying to lead into another circle dance thread..)
A good speaker tweaker or two can also be pretty entertaining.

I'm starting to look at raving as artistry.  I see gesture in dance,
I see performance art in DJing, and I see a site installation in the
way the party is presented (space, lighting, etc.).

Okay.. I'll stop blabbing.
It's good to be back here.. although I see it's still up to 100msgs aday!

HEllo everyone!  I've missed you _all (if you _all are still here)

-Jon

first of, an apology - i'm lifting this from your post almost totally
out-of-context.  just wanted to pass on something that i was told that
made sense to me.  i'm too young to know whether this is really the truth
or not, but it has that ring.

the 'hippies' (or other label-of-choice) who really changed their lives
and goals permanently in and after the sixties are _not_ the people you
hear spouting off about it today.  they are also not the people who pulled
woodstock out of the closet, tattooed a pepsi logo on it, and beat it like
a dead horse.  the 'hippies' dropped out of the cold war's military and
corporate power structure, either for good or for a long time.  

today's profitteers and self-appointed spokespeople for the '60s are by and
large the people who stayed in the mainstream of american society through
the sixties, watching but not participating in the counterculture.  they
got ahead while others got back to nature etc. and now they are the elite
class which gets to write the official history - CEO's, politicians,
university professors, and so forth.

which, i suppose, means that in twenty years i'll have the pleasure of
hearing today's business school students and student body presidents get
on 'nightline' and tell me why the pacifier and whistle were emblematic of
end-of-millenium generation-x discontent.  i can hardly wait.

Well..  For some people, the scene dies all the time.. Then it just
comes back alive again.  It's all relative.  Everybody goes through
the typical rave stages. 

1  Wow, everything is soo cool and positive.  I like the fancy lights 
and popsicles.

2.  I'm starting to meet everyone... I love you all.

3.  Now its time to make hats and sell them, become a dj, or start promoting.

4.  Now youre sick of it.. The scene is dead..everyone is shady..  You start
talking shit.

5.  It's been a year and a half and you've found new light in the scene

6. You're back.

And the cycle keeps repeating itself.  Its so easy to get burnt out.. Isnt it?

>The scene is not dead. The scene may be falling, but that's as far as it

>underground knows whats up!

What are you talking about?  Massives.. Commercialization.. same thing.
But who ever said commercialism was bad?  Every raver takes part in
their own "commercial" economy.  If you've paid money to get into a rave, 
you've taken part in some form of commercialism.

I guess its just annoying to see my 'secret society' become the 11 oclock news, 
and a new marketing scheme for Virgin.. But whatever..IT's good to see hard
working artists finally get what they deserve.  God bless em...

>What's so positive about the scene falling?

Then we can just go bowling or to the movies on Saturday.

>VIBE FILTERING!

Promoters.. With fat cash falling out of their pockets.
Dj's.. With silver shiny coats and space age sunglasses

I don't think there is such a thing as underground anymore.
Which reminds me.. SOme one remarked about Godfather at the last
one track mind and said he was playing shit that you hear on the radio.
I said...  Oh really.

>Once the scene goes overboard where (like in England) raves are illegal,
>it will filter out all the bad vibes. Massives will be just as massive,
>yet the flyers will be smaller or it may be word of mouth. COOL WORLD

Oh.. Cool World.  Weren't they the ones that put a commercial on the radio?
And how can locations get better?  What we need to do is get the
government to subsidize raving..  You know.. It heals cancer and all that..

>I can't wait for that to happen. It will better our scene so much.
>And I will be there in the new scene with everyone else.

New scene.. Old scene.. It's all the same scene.
You know whats scary.. WHen you start singing a Smiths song
at a rave and the person next to you finishes the next verse.

Anyway, I hope I didn't offend anyone.  If you don't know me, I'm generally 
sarcastic- but not jaded.  I still love going out when I can...

I _hate_ Spin magazine.  Now, for those who know me, you know it takes a 
lot to get me to dislike an entity.  But Sin really did it.  And as if 
you want to hear the story, here's why:

One night I was watching that show Politically Incorrect and they had a 
panel of various folks talking about why LSD was so great.  This panel 
included the head editor of Spin.  Now this guy looked like your typical 
gen-x-er, but he had some attitude on him.  He was happy to tell everyone 
that he had never used any drugs (though he later admitted to quite a 
caffine addiction) and he went on about some BS.  Okay, then this other 
panelist says that LSD was made illegal by the government, just like 
everything else that is found to be fun, like pot, ecstacy..
AND AT THIS POINT that worm from Spin says, "Yeah, but Ecstacy makes you 
listen to really bad music!" and the crowd cracks up laughing.  

OKAY if this isn't bad enough

About a month ago, SPIN does this article.. THE COVER STORY about how 
techno and various electronic music is the new hip thing!

GET YOUR ATTITUDE STRAIGHT AND STOP TRYING TO CHASE DOLLARS, SPIN!

Either you like the stuff or you don't.  Stop insulting our scene.

When I am posting "we're all doomed." I am hoping to motivate people to do
something other than go drop $20 for some huge party and expect to be
entertained.

That's why I specifically recommended people have parties in their homes,
in fields, and random places with their friends: to create.

end of line.

RE: LA-303

For sale Sears Craftsman 'SKILL' saw Model LA-303.

Unlike the original which used an acid dipped SAWTOOTH
blade and discrete components, this model uses telekinetics
to cut through the toughest of minds.

Frankly though I'll tell ya, it's not a religious icon
like its predecessor.  But if you are used to praying
to a plastic Buddha, you'll find no problems here.

If however, you want to start a new religion with your
BARELY used SKILL saw...  That is not up to you, rather
the success is DICTATED by how many people you can
convince that your TOOL can do the job just as well
as the original.  I recommend the Socratic approach.

I Paid $799.00 new in the box, asking $700 obo.

 I kinda see the scene like one of those carton corpses lying on a table. 
The doctor comes by to push down the arm that is sticking up causing a 
leg to pop up. Push that down and then the other leg goes up. The doc 
starts pushing body parts so fast that the corpse is practically dancing 
in response.

Subject: Rave Busts/Libertarian Party Meeting

Dear Ravefriends,

        In response to Ray Vonie and others who are probably wondering, the
Wednesday evening discussion of rave bust issues unfortunately didn't
happen.

        First, to my knowledge only about five people besides Chikako and I
showed up -- not even the few folks who said they'd be there showed, which
was kind of disappointing.  Complicating this was my mistake in not getting
a specific time slot for the rave topic.  A matter of internal Libertarian
Party politicking about the relationship between the local, state, and
national organizations ended up taking a HUGE amount of time, and the
ravers who showed up didn't want to sit around for hours, not that I blame
them!

        If there'd been a larger turnout, we could have requested and
gotten time for our topic, but I didn't feel right trying to cut short the
business of the party for which around 25 people showed up, to deal with an
issue primarily of interest to only a handful of us.

        I'm still intending to work on bringing people together on this
issue however.  Perhaps I was a little naive to expect a lot of ravers to
come out on a weeknight to a non-party event.  Next time I think I'll try
planning a potluck social at my place or some other location where we can
listen to music and have some fun besides talking politics and legal
strategy, and contact more people about the meeting on an individual basis.

        Another thing I'm thinking about is compiling a city-by-city
database of what the laws and requirements are pertaining to holding dance
events, what the practical steps are you must take, and who are the people
you have to go through.  Once we identify the pressure points, and spread
the information around, we can bring pressure to bear on them.

        If there are any volunteers for doing research on specific Bay Area
cities, I'll happily accept any knowledge gained and put it in some kind of
organized form to distribute back to everyone.

        I also know there's been plenty of discussion in this area on
SFRaves over the years, so that information would be in the archives.
Would doing a keyword search to retrieve useful and relevant posts from our
collective past be practical?

        Other ideas?  Steve S., Leftjab, Adder, Diane T., anyone?

May the bass be with us,

one night as me and a friend and another friend took these little square
pieces of paper which made us laugh horrendously (must have been the
content) for hours we were having fun poking fun at some of the
scenesters...no one here, don't worry.  but just sayin shit like

"oh, i've been in the scene longer than you have..."

"im from [such and such a town]..."

"oh, i know that song..."

i think what was really funny though was the fact that we ended up having
to sit up all night in my little tiny bedroom in a 1 bedroom apt...with my
roommate and his "friend" trying to sleep in the next room and my
neighbors in their bedroom, which was right next to my bedroom, on the
other side of us.  

and then it happened.  

i tried to stray away from rave music and pop in this cd called "Ultra
Vivid Scene"

anyone ever heard of it?  

well, one of my friends started pointing out how much of a joke this cd
was.  it had like all these jesus christ religiious symbols on it that i
never even noticed because i never went to church or sunday school or
anything like that, but at the same time it had like drills nstuff (hi
jeff!) on it...and we all just started busting up and then it goes back to
that 

"oh, i know that song"

because at the time we all were sort of burned out on the scene.  

so we switched to the ultra vivid scene.  

july 1994

Bon Appetit!  :>

Is this some type of elaborate ploy to start up more underground 
events???

Following this thread, it's true that the scene stays and it's the 
people who change... A few friends and myself spent several hrs last 
night wandering the hills, 'staking' an east bay location for another 
renegade (on a state park, of all things).

As long as there is a drive for positve events. As long as priorities 
are in place ( I.e. why are you going / throwing this party?). As long 
as it's understood that this is a community and not just random faces 
in the crowd ( and only YOU can make a party a community event).
That's is what makes the vibe,  that's what keeps us alive...

BTW:  We did find the spot...  It is HUGE (for an UG location)... And 
it's in the middle of nowhere (And right on the outskirts of a major 
city).  Hope to see you there in April...

Wayne is totally right....its known as DIY....Do It Yourself. And I see
this happening all over... we all know the scene is NOT dead or dying.
As any entity grows and evolves it becomes more complex by nature.
Accept it.
The DIY culture brings ravers back to their roots...or the core of why
we rave....the music, the people, the spiritual energy. (and so much
else :) 
 Please see Ecstasy.org for some relavent info:
http://www.ecstasy.org/party.html

More and more often these days as pessimistic peeps cry about how the
scene is being exploited (I won't argue with that, though) and how it is
dying or being ruined...I see others putting so much love, time, energy
and $$ back into the scene and generating new levels of energy and
throwing events that are as unfuckin'believably amazing as the last one
you thought couldn't be topped. Illustration: I have been raving for at
least 5 years now...and I still walk out of a space bleary eyed at 7am
saying to myself and others...holy shit..that was the best nite ever! 
  I don't mean to ramble off on a tangent....but this all comes down to
a key aspect of our society...too many people just take and take and
don't give back. (read: not giving a shit)
Don't get me wrong...I'm not saying every raver out there should throw
their own party to "give back" to the scene because they owe it...just
that we need to stop and remember that the world is made up of
people...and raving doesn't happen by itself. It takes a lot of hard
work by alot of people to put together an event...as all you SFRavers
know already. All I'm saying is that 5 people can't do the work for the
rest of the crowd. Everyone should contribute in their own personal
way...
anywaze...I'm done now. everyone have a super wknd...this one looks like
it will be amazing...(again!!)
PLUR,
ari

Tony,

  You said a lot of interesting things which makes me think about where
"we've"
been and where "we're" going.... Have you ever read Hess's Journey To
the East?
It is an appropriate statement on what always goes on in society -
particularly
large media fed ones like ours ( some would say lead by the nose ).
Namely
when the going is easy and the media ( or even or local leaders etc )
convince
us that we are making "progress" we all buy into it - pat ourselves on
the back
and believe we are making that progress.  But many people aren't really
on the
"journey" (at least in a conscious way ) or they lose their connection
to the
journey. Then they think the journey "stopped"....

  So it was with the 60's - we were ALL making "social progress" and
exploring
the limits of consciousness. That's the media bull shit... the actual
story was
that some were on a mainstream journey to consciousness expansion and
many of
these continued: Ram Dass, Leary, Wavey Gravey, Al Huang, Paul Horn,
Lilly,
and Santana. Also, local leaders like Rev. C. Williams etc. found values
there. 
They haven't "sold out"....  Others, unfortunately, were never on the
"journey" -
they never really "got it" so there was nothing to sell out.... but they
did
party a lot, listened to great music, got really high and got laid a lot
;-)

  Unfortunately, many in our scene are the same... they're in it to be
"entertained"
by the music or to get high or whatever... but they see no journey in it
all.
The good thing about the 60's was it caused many people to explore many
things
beyond the music - religion, art, philosophy etc. It was really these
mind/soul
expanding juorneys that worked. The music was not enough - although
music was an
important part especially for people like Santana or Paul Horn. Over and
over again 
I hear people within the scene saying " it's ONLY about the music - I'll
see you on
the dance floor"... if all we are doing is throwing big parties, getting
high,
and being entertained by music then it won't be enough. Others in the
scene, do
rituals, make art or alters, explore philosopy etc. These people are
begining a
lifelong journey that leads "to the "East" "... it's not really about a
place - it's
about a way of being. 

  So like all periods of expansion - we have "crowds" of people bubbling
about how
they have "found it"... THE JOURNEY... but if that journey isn't about
deep
connections with life and feeding the spirit within - it won't be enough
- it 
won't sustain itself. Thus, when many of the people I now see on the
dancefloor
are my age ( giving them a couple of decades ) they won't even remember
why they
liked techno and dancing so much.... just visions of lost youth - stupid
shit you
do when you're too young to know any better.  Others will smile about
how their
journey started - as I smile now about taking LSD and reading Be Here
Now 25 years
ago. Some get it - others don't... we all have freedom to do what we
want.... That's
how it is and how it's always been....

  BTW the concious expansion of the 60's was NOT unique other than TV/
media coverage
or hype. There was the "new thought" movement in the early 1900's ( read
S. Lewis
Elmer Gantry ) which was like the "new age" movement of the 60's. There
were the
gay 90's or the flapper era.... all of these had aspects like the
60's... it always
cycles. And I thank god for the "house movement" because it is the cycle
of
conciousness expansion ( just like the 60's ) that came after the "blah"
eighties.

Just my thoughts,

Mike

I think I am going to DIE. But anyway. I haven't heard half of the stuff 
they put in and all the reasons. Does that mean as usual mainstream 
articles have got it wrong and that maybe they can't comercialise the 
scene? I suddenly feel like all the Nivana fans in 1991.

That would be halarious. I could just see all these high ravers trying to 
reactivate their glow stick to no avail. But THERE is something you can 
do with the glow stick and that is not put them in the trash and give 
them in the toxic materials drives. Because they are really bad for the 
envoronement. Or so I heard from a friend in the library when I was all 
determined to find the answer.

Ok kids, how are ya???

Sorry for the waste of bandwith to some but I have a question...

I rent generators.  I need to for the outdoor parties we provide... 
 But, I'd rather rent a generator for people within the scene than, 
say, Big 4 rent or something.  I mean, if I must shell out some 
dough... might as well be to another raver, right???

So the 20,000$ question is, If anyone has a generator they're willing 
to rent to some crazy ravers for free outdoor events (well maybe 1 out 
of every 4 events might have a 3$ charge to cover the other free 
parties) please email (aguevara@rely.com) or page me (510.218.7494). 
Any help / leads would be appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

Actually, a variable speed SKILL saw with a contact microphone
attached run through a 24db/octave filter is an excellant idea, and
certainly not a joke at all. I would also add a vice-like handled
screw to the bolt that tightens down the circular blade to add or
decrease non-linear harmonics. You could take a piece of steel and
touch it against the spinning blade for amazing sounds. Then take a
wheel/drum with knobs on it, like a music box drum, that would switch
on and off the trigger of the saw in rhythimic patterns to use as a
pattern sequencer and your complete. Just shift the drum up and down
for different patterns, and vary the saw speed for
transpositions. I'll bet it would sound better than Roland's new
"SuperSaw" wave on the JP-8000. Talk about real analog ...

I once played Ford mufflers in a band. I had five of them cut to
different sizes mounted and processed by micromoog (4-pole) and an
old analog delay. Ford mufflers sounded much better then Chevys. 

Are my black roots showing?

	**--LOCATION--**
	U.C. Santa Cruz campus, College Eight Dinning Facility
	Take all freeways from the BayArea to Highway 17 South
	Go over the SantaCruz mountains and take Highway 1 North Exit
	Go straight at 1st light, make RIGHT at 2nd light (Mission St.)
	Go straight through 3 lights, make a RIGHT on the 4th (Bay St.)
	Go through 2 lights. You'll see a big barn on the left corner
	Park in the lot by the barn! Thats the base of the campus...

	Now cross the street to the shuttle/bus stop and catch the
	shuttle (preferably a "Night Perimeter" shuttle its free)
	And ride it all the way around campus to COLLEGE EIGHT!

	Get off, cross the street (going downhill) and go down a big
	flight of stairs and the party's on your immediate right!

	**--PS--**
	You gotta park off campus in the barn lot and take the shuttle 
	because without a parking permit you cant get on campus through
	the gaurd gates after 8pm, if you come before 8 you can come in
	park at College Eight and not worry about shuttle riding and
	getting to your car later! We'll be around to help people finding
	their way and getting to their cars, ill give ya a ride! ;)


	HOPE to See tons of you guys out here on Friday :) :) :)
	Looking Forward to seeing many of you, meeting many of you,
	and remembering all of you for a life time! 

	If you'd like more info, or have some means to help out, whatever!
	Email me/ Call me! We're looking for a huge ladder for example!

Inspired by the stages of the raver, on some other post I pressent you the 
raver personality guide. Edition 1

Come on admit it, you all old folks out there you were once a:

SEPTEMBER CHILD!

How to spot one; All their gear is new. Clean shoes, brand new addidas 
		back pack, perfect parting everytime (Female)

Where to find them: In every big underground, and clubs.

They always appear: Just after the summer, either they got introduced in 
		the holidays or at the beginning at the quarter of their
		 first year in university.

Internet characteristics: Their account has edu behind it.
			Their post consists of Lot of "I Love you all"
			"It was so fluffy and PLURry." "I have never had 
			friends like this.	

Pros: They are great to look at. They give you candy. They make you smile 
because you have lost that innocence.

Cons: THey're hella annoying when you're pissed off and recieve an email 
from them, eg. "It's all above love. peace" In other words what you say 
don't count."

They don't know the difference between trance and breakbeat 
if it hit them. SO they resort to posts on NNR things.

What they become: Usually they drop out of the mailing list and you never 
hear of them again because the e has worn off. 

They become cynical and complains like the rest of us, after being 
flamed one too many times, and been ripped off and given crap drugs, and 
gone to bum parties..

Don't feel bad this is YOU! Everyone gets thier turn.....

To be continued........

Coming raver personalities: The grouch, The DJ, The Drug dealer, The Old 
skooler, The 43 still-happy-and-raving old skooler, The about to burn out 
raver, the born again raver (Straight edge from now on) etc....

10 REASONS WHY SCOOBY DOO WAS A DRUG INFLUENCED CARTOON

1. SCOOBY AND SHAGGY were always being freaked out by ghost and ghouls,
but no one else saw them before Scoob and Shaggy.

2. Scooby and Shaggy always had the munchies.

3. Shaggy always thought Scooby was talking and was the only one who could
hear him and understand him.

4. Scooby and Shaggy always fell into the trap that was intended for the
monster because they were tripping over themslves and couldn't see where
they were going.


5. They were always deluded and warped by thinking they were dressed iup
up in some costumes and entertained the monster.

6. Shaggy always said :"like" to the extreme, i.e. "like ZOINKS, scoob,
let's get outta here!!" what's a ZOINK?

7. Scooby and Shaggy were alwas the ones in the back of the van (doing you
know what).

8. They drove arouynd in the MYSTERY MACHINE which had that weird trippy
design on it's side.

9. Shaggy and Scooby were always giddy and laughing.

10. Look at Shaggy. The way he dressed, him goatee, etc, 'nuff said.

So you want to take the scene undergound?  And at the same time you'd
like to buy a site where you could have completely legal raves? 

Check this out:

It's an old missile base with undergound facilities that the government
is selling!

although i'm a great believer in third party politics and grassroots
democracy as someone who has worked on ralph nader's campaign last year,
including organizing a rally for third party candidates and a variety of
other progressive grassroots projects over the years, i want to suggest
that this effort shouldn't tangle itself in the politics of any third
party. there is a lot that can be done to research permitting at the
planning commission (good place to start), form a grassroots coalition,
start a petition/initiative drive, put out letters to the editor and
press releases, organize volunteers, etc. later, once this basic work
has started and you're onto coalition building, you might then approach
a variety of organizations, political and apolitical, to get their
support, esp. neighborhood groups, and by approaching them all you won't
be alienating any potential base of support. i've got some stuff on the
web describing a coalition (coalition for sustainable neighborhoods) we
organized to oppose the burger king in the sunset. might be interesting
to look at.

lighten up you guys. the scene is not going to die, it's going to evolve. if
you still listen to techno in 10 years, you will be as sad and boring as our
neighbor who still listens to WHAM!
and when it comes to community, ben and i certainly can't complain. several
people on the list have offered help and even places to stay to us  two
complete strangers. it's a trust simply based on a common interest and a
knowledge of the scene. we trust that ravers are good people! i call that
community.

Hi all you wacky wavers!!!   =]

A friend of mine, a university professor with special interests in
ethnomusicology, has asked me if I can provide a short description
(10-20 words) of "What is a rave?" I thought this was such an
interesting question that I'd throw it out to you all to see what
kind of answers we'd get. (All she's heard so far from students
she's asked is "A drug-fest", which I think is a very unsatisfactory
answer).

So.....

                    What is a rave?


Love and hugs!!!

- Martin  =]

okay here are 10-15 words that explain a "rave" to me:

family, community, acceptance, music, dance, ritual, spirituality, a
release, CHANGE, expansion, positivity-negativity, me, my friends(now,
past and future)and grunge...well most of the time. :P

some additives:
waking up at 4 in the afternoon,
trying to find a (natural) way to stay up past 4 a.m.
expansion of my mind 
soooooo many different ideals and ideologies under one roof...in harmony
an introduction to sooo many new and different things
and lastly...
	......people

i'm not trying to be cheesy here...but it seems to be coming out that
way.

I mean it must mean SOMETHING (or a few things) to me...i've been doing
it for 6 years now. and YES i do get very jaded at times..but like
someone said..it's all a circle.

a RAVE or THE scene is by no means perfect but it has given me a lot and
really helped make me the person i am today.  Which, trust me, is a MUCH
better person than i was 6 years ago.

hello all,
just another little note sent out to you, to tell you all that i love you
it's friday friday friday, a beautiful friday at that, and i want to
spread my happiness to all y'all so i have composed a happy thought to
bring
smiles to your lips.

once upon a time, there was an enormous group of people and they all liked
to engage in many fun activities. listening to music, feeling, sharing and
spreading a groovelicious vibe, and surrounding people with unconditional
love and happiness was what they are all about. within each person grew an
extraordinary spirit. playing on the grass, basking in the sun, dancing,
hugging, kissing, smiling and laughing, people were carefree, not a worry
in their heads. flowers were blooming, butterflies playing tag, buzzing
bees and ladybugs, sun shining down on their heaven on earth, a cool
breeze blowing gently. they played on into the night when all the stars
began to show their brights and the adventures continued on. comets soared
throught the sky and were wished upon asking the gods to never let this
end, to continue to play and unite and come together with their community,
forgetting all the icky-poo stuff and concentrationg solely on good.
people wrapped themselves and their loved ones in warm yummy blankets,
crowding around a warm fire with enough room for everybody as the beats
keep pounding, pounding pounding.things that they didn't have to worry
about: money, drug overdoses, unhappiness, hate, stolen items, and not
having enough water. oh, and there were plenty of crayons and paper and
fingerpaint and bubbles and lots and lots of toys to play with and stuffed
animals and tents made out of blankets and branches, and trees to climb
and a pond to swim in and oh, all that other fun stuff. and this went on
forever and everyone was happy...
okay, so it's not realistic, but definitely ideal. as longs as i'm
surrounded by my friends, anything is good. 
everybody, go out and have a superb weekend, always play safe and take
care of the people you love. 
sugarkisses and all that other fun stuff,
***stariana***

Victoria-

I thought I might let you know about Hyperreal, if you're not already
aware.

> I want to show the world that ravers have talent.

The implication being that www.hyperreal.com does not indicate this?

Hyperreal is a very high-profile site.  Besides the recent messages to the
list about Hyperreal in the news, we have has been getting press for some
time now -- at one point, a Hyperreal staffer's homepage was the cover
photo of USA Today's Life section. 

Also, check out www.hyperreal.com/artists/.  There you'll find a listing
of Hyperreal staffers who do more than hack up webpages and listen to
techno :)

Please note that the intent of this message is to inform you that there
are others who share your goal and that massive numbers of people each day
are getting a really positive take on this whole rave thing.  My apologies
if it came off otherwise.

If there's one place that is giving ravers a good name, it has to be
Hyperreal.  With all the "cyber-ness" going on in the media, it's a little
odd that 20/20 didn't mention us.  I guess it also makes sense though
since they wanted to show a bunch of kids indiscriminantly popping pills
and not educating themselves about these substances -- the drug archives
is one of Hyperreal's most popular sections.

oh, and i forgot, one more thing. raves are not about, or rather shouldn't
be about negativity, or how much of a "raver" you are. everyone should be
accepted with open arms, unconditionally. if they are willing to try, we
should be willing to help make their experience all the better for them.
who cares if you're new or old skool or if you are this kind of raver or
that kind of raver or whatever, just so long as you can all share the vibe. 
bye,

Subject: Re: What is a rave -- from hyperreal FAQ
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

As usual, folks, the hyperreal web-site (the FAQ) has some good info on
this subject (editing could make it less than 20 words):


What is a "rave"?

The term "rave" has been overused almost to the point of losing its
meaning. The word has always meant (according to
webster):

    1.rave \'ra-v\ vb [ME raven]
              1a: to talk irrationally in or as if in delirium
              1b: to declaim wildly
              1c: to talk with extreme enthusiasm
              2: to move or advance violently : STORM : to utter in madness
or frenzy
       rav.er
    2.rave n often attrib
              1: an act or instance or raving
              2: an extravagantly favorable criticism

In general practice, a "rave" usually refers to a party, usually all night
long, open to the general public, where loud "techno"
music is mostly played and many people partake in a number of different
chemicals, though the latter is far from necessary.
The number of people at the event is unimportant; it can range from 50
people to 25,000 people. The cost of attendance is
also unimportant - there have been good raves and bad raves at both ends of
the cost spectrum (though in practice, the higher
the price, the more commercial the event, and the lower the quality). At a
rave, the DJ is a shaman, a priest, a channeller of
energy - they control the psychic voyages of the dancers through his choice
in hard-to-find music and their skill in
manipulating that music, sometimes working with just a set of beats and
samples, into a tapestry of mindbending music. A
large part of the concept of raves is built upon sensory overload - a
barrage of audio and very often visual stimuli are brought
together to elevate people into an altered state of physical or
psychological existence.



The "Vibe"

The actual concept of raves is not new - it is as old as time itself. As
the base level, raves are very comparable to American
Indian religious ceremonies, i.e. pow-wows, and also to the concept of the
Shaman in Eskimo and Siberian society - where
music is the key towards pulling oneself into a unique emotional and
psychological state, a state in which one experiences
washes of sensations and visions, not delusions, but visions. Sounds very
hokey in print, but I'm sure MANY of you out
there know what I'm talking about. The hypnotizing effect of techno music
coupled with the seemless transitions and
thematic progressions of rave DJ's as the night progresses can be QUITE
intoxicating, resulting in what could be closely
compared to a religious experience. Music in general has always been able
to sweep people off their feet, but what
distinguishes raves are the concept of the _shared_ experience; a feeling
of unity often arises, and people are open and
friendly to one another. There is a loss of that "attitude" that is
omnipresent in normal clubs and even in life in general.
People are celebrated for who they are, not what they aren't. There are
many better ways to explain the above, and more than
a few can be found at the web site. For a better, blow-by-blow description
of what an actual rave is like, please check check
out the "The Ecstatic Cybernetic Amino Acid Test", an article that appeared
in the San Francisco Examiner in February 1992,
and is perhaps one of the most comprehensive surveys of the rave scene ever
to appear in print.

Hey, Everyone :)
I'm looking forward to Cloud Factory tomorrow night!! I'd be going out
tonight as well, but I have traffic school tomorrow at 8am :( :(
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone could give me a ride to Cloud Factory
tomorrow night.  I'm almost positive where it's going to take place, but
the message sez to go to the map point anyway, and seeing as how I have no
car, it will be a major pain in the behind to take BART and bus there only
to have to backtrack on another bus....
So, can anyone please help this poor soul with a ride?  I live in downtown
Oakland, and I won't need a ride back..just there...(I can take BART to
Berkeley or SF is needed).
Thanks in advance :) :) :)
Love and glitter,
Glitterboy Thomas
PS-I will pay for gas/toll if necessary!!!

Dear Dan,

It seems that a lot of people have been depressed recently.
I have noticed that a widespread darkness has increased since the night that
the planets ligned up, marking the age of Aquarius.

I am not kidding.

Some say that we are going through a period of darkness and uncertainty that
precedes the golden age of humanity.

Some say that this period has been predicted by different religious
scriptures and kooky foreseers, and is likewise suggested in the
pseudofictional work "The Celestine Prophecy".

We are becoming closer to our spiritual nature; yet we are confused about
the impending light; and thus we are more agitated, depressed & violent. It
is the reverse of "the calm before the storm."

I am feeling like one agitated, fidgety-finger mother these days.

I have a friend called Judy who is an Aquarius.  She told me last week that
she hasn't felt normal since right around the time that them damn planets
lined up over Earth.  I wonder if other Aquarians are more sensitive to it.

I dunno.  I hang out with some of these "rave" people and sometimes we get
funny ideas in our collective head.  There is a rave magazine called XLR8R,
which recently dedicated an entire issue to darkness.

If all this is true, I am going to have one remarkable hard-on when the
clouds clear up and we enter the golden age.  Hope it doesn't take too long;
I'm going to lose my mind if I don't stop fidgeting.

Just a thought.   Cheer up or I'm going to come to your house and stomp on
your head.

Yours,

boomerang

I still don't get it.  Sexstacy?  Some people are into it, but it's never
made sense to me.   It seems like mixing apples and milkcrates.  I'd much
rather do some juicy throbbing hugging.   Besides, I can't imagine making a
direct deposit when my bankroll's shriveled up like a stack of dimes, yanno?

Sorry, that was crude.  But, still, I never understood the sexstacy thing.

the word "rave" itself originates with the old french "resver," which is 
    "to dream, wander, rave."

i decided to post this on the list because several people have expressed
interest in the british rave scene and we don't want to repeat ourselves too
much.

i wrote this in a private conversation:
:
> or do you not like jungle?

not that much actually. but that's just a matter of taste... and of skin
color, interestingly enough, regarding the recent diversity debate on the
list. it seems that here in england happy hardcore and techno crowds are
largely white and jungle crowds largely black. i figured it out a while ago,
thou, at exodus, an illegal rave, where the crowd is mixed and they play
jungle as well as techno sets. it's a matter of movement. white people and
black people move and dance differently. and once i understood that you have
to move differently to jungle, i actually got into it. i still like happy
hardcore best. i am white, nothing i can do about it. i move better to
hardcore. but i'd love to check out your favorite jungle do sometime in
june. i'll get ben to post something about the british rave scene on the
list some time. he's the real raver.=20

and  this is the reply plus Craig and Ben's reply to the reply (ah, you know
what i mean):

>
>I hope you don't mind me asking you all these questions, but I have been
into >jungle since >back in '93, and I have always wanted to travel to
England to check >out all the dj's...I know >they throw a lot of massives in
Milton Keynes, at the >Sanctuary right?

Damm right ! Hi there in SF,my name is Craig, i'm one of Bens and Iris's
friends and i have been raving for about 7 years. We are all off to "HELTER
SKHELER"  later today (15th) with load's of Friends, which is at the
Santurary and Rollers (a neighbering wharehouse). I don't know if you have
heard of it ? But they always have blinding line up's, for instence in the
sancturary they got SY, HYPE (the best jungle DJ in the world), DANCE, BILLY
BUNTER, VINYL GROOVER, UNKNOWN, NICKY BLACK  MARKET, GROOVE RIDER, ELLIS
DEE, SLIPMAT, DOUGAL, and RAMOS. And as eqally blinding DJ's in the other
including VIBES, SEDUCTION, RAY KEITH and RANDALL. They are always a wicked
party with a buzzing up for it crowd.

>really big commercial parties, and is their a lot of segregation between
the "black" >junglists >and the "white" happy hardcore crowds..I guess what
I am trying to say >is..is the jungle scene >in England mainly a black
scene...kinda of like hip hop is >over here?
=20
I would'nt say it was a mainly black scene. The scene over here is quit
mixed both in commercial and underground events, but there are strictly
jungle events where a white person
might not be welcome if they where on there own. There's not that
"P..L..U..R.." that is so common in mixed music events where colour does not
matter. There is a big following by both white and black people, but most of
our events are mixed music, jungle, tecno, and happy hardcore, and most
people are in to it all. For example, they like to start the night with
Jungle to get things going, then biuld things up with some Hardcore, then in
to uplifitng Tecno  and Hard Trance .. Goa ... So generally there is some
thing for every one and if there's a style you dislike it eventualy grows on
you. I used to hate jungle, but i started to go EXODUS an illegal rave that
is curently fighting the criminal justice bill for the right to party (they
use other people's wharehouses and only charge =A31) and they play the above
order of music and i now love hard step like what is played by HYPE. I
seriously recomend you get some of HYPE'S set's from HELTERSKELTER, there
amazing, let's trade tapes! With anyone that wants to.
Stuf i'm into: Orignaly i was into Hardcore but that's a bit chezzy these
days, I love uplifting Tecno, Goa and some Jungle.
There's quit a big Goa scene in london's underground clubs and lot's of
travellers put on free partys with Goa playing all night. To be
continued............................

well...that comet's going to hit the earth in 2012 and about half of us
are going to die and the earth is going to shift its axis again...putting
the north pole at the equator...

...well at least that's what they say.  it's kind of fun thinking about
it, actually.  it would be like a rebirth of the planet.  the only people
that would survive would be the strong, the people who can surround
themselves in a positive energy shield.

Uh, hello, SFRaves isn't "doomed" to anything.  I don't believe in fate.
History on this list has shown that, for better and for worse, individuals
can play a huge part in charting the course of discussion, and who those
individuals are can change dramatically from month to month.  Some of the
most caustic flamethrowers transmogrified into the most positive
contributors - the opposite has happened too.  SFRaves is only "doomed" if
no one cares to post to it.  That doesn't mean folks need to live their
life vicariously through the list - which has happened too much before -
all it means is folks need to get some value for the time they spend
reading or writing to the list.

Ask yourself these questions:  Are you interested in hearing about how the
scene is evolving?  How the parties last weekend were?  In hearing how
others feel about the music, the dancing, the lights, the drugs, the
experience?  In maybe striking up a friendship or two with folks with
similar interests?  If the answer is yes, then there's a reason to
contribute to the list.  I think for many people, this is still true.  

The Death of the Scene, and of the List, has been greatly exaggerated.
Raving has transcended trend status - this is the tenth year at least that
people have been dancing to acid house, and before that these types of
parties simply went by different names.  This is the fifth year of
SFRaves.

My god, heaven forbid the common folk catch on to this "gig"!

Some parties billed as raves have been frequented by folks like this since
I first started raving in 1989.  Sometimes they turn out to be the most
vibe-y folks at the party.  And if their Mustang doesn't garner a lot of
attention, they just leave.  Big deal.

Whoa!  Wayne's a clubber, wayne's a clubber!  Look out!  Once a clubber,
always a... wait... 

Wayne, I *know* you didn't mean that to come out like that, but it did.
Why is it inconceivable that you can be "redeemed" but other clubbers
can't?  Is there really a possibility of a "ClubKidPolcalypse" taking over
underground parties?  How many folks out there were on the "them" side of
this us.v.them issue?

Hey, it'll give all the lemmings a place to go to while the rest of us
enjoy the CloudFactory party held the same night.  Sounds like they'll get
to enjoy at least one honestly good band too (Chem Bros), and if it's not
worth $35 to them they won't go to another one.  What's wrong with these
folks having fun?  With BGP, Live105, ChemBros, and everyone else making
some money?  How is it preventing us from having our fun?  It's not.

The real danger to our culture is if it can be demonized to the
point where dancing all night or listening to techno music is seen as a
subversive act, and the Powers that Be (tm) somehow work to prevent us
from doing this.  I *don't* see widespread adoption of techno music or an
explosion of club attendees doing this, necessarily.  If anything I think
it *helps* foster adoption of this as an acceptible activity.

I guess in your "ClubKidPocalypse" I just fail to see a problem.  If
"unsavory" elements show up at your shindig, deal with them - that's never
been a new problem.  How we choose to deal with them will say a lot about 
what kind of culture we are really building.

"RAVE" broke "big" in 1991.  It's old news.  No catastrophe.  And there
won't be.

Hello friends,

Since we're talking about Berlin...

The following is from Jan who I believe is in the Netherlands (.nl?).  He sent 
me this info regarding this year's Love Parade in Berlin, which is the largest 
techno party I've ever heard of. Last year's estimate was around 1,000,000 
happy groovers!  I studied in Berlin while in college, and LOVE the city.  The 
overall 'youth scene' in Berlin is amazing, esp. in the former east Berlin part 
of the city.  So, my roomie and I are shopping for the lowest airfares, 
discount tix, etc., which I'll post to the list when we find it if anyone is 
interested in going. I have a double cd set of many of the DJs that were there 
last year (yes, it's rather commercial), but the music is good! 

In the meantime, see you at Cloud Factory on Sat!

Love, Nathan

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This years Love Parade is 12th of July. But be there at least a day or two
before and do not miss the day after (loads of pre- and after-parties).

Where does everyone stay? Everywhere! People are camping in the parks,
sleeping on the streets etc. But most don't sleep those days at all (when
should they?).
The VIP ravers and the odd 1000 journalists stay in hotels ranging from up
to Hilton etc. After all Techno is big business by now in Europe.


Have not been to Tachales, but know the other two (at least I think I can
still remember).

You have been at Humboldt - studying what?


Regards
Jan

This isn't the same book by Irvine Welsh, "Ecstasy", is it?  I thought
that took place in Scotland, just as Trainspotter did.

Well, if you were owned by Disney, you'd probably be blowing some smoke
out your ass too!  

The People are catching on.  

In other news, in San Jose a medical marijuana group is not only setting
up shop, they are working with the SJ city council to define a zoning
category for medical marijuana sale and use (which would probably require
them to be far from schools, etc.), they're going to pay sales tax, and
forbidding indoor smoking, all in compliance with state law.  That's the
real deal, folks - Dennis Peron could take a few clues from their lead.

Hi, Pengo,

I had a friend a few years ago who talked about raves in stadiums in Japan.
She said she could never find her friends because it was just a sea of
black-haired folks.  

Can't say I know for sure, I've never been.

I gotta admit, I've twisted glowsticks around my head so fast that I saw the
universe crack open spill out all her secrets since the beginning of time...

...but I still think that everyone has a right to be entertained.  Tapping
into the mysteries and magic, for me, is entertainment.   If I'm not being
entertained, I'm not having fun.  And if I'm not having fun, why go at all?

what is a rave?...

what is a night in a bar?
what is a sunday morning in church?
what is a day at school or at work?

did he ask what is a rave, or what is a rave to you?

should we remind the professor that perception is created by the
bio-computer through which the data is inputted?

what is a rave to you guys?

Hi Kidz,

I have sure enjoyed the recent discussions around here.  Seems
people are showing a little more respect.

I've never really introduced myself to the list, so here goes:  I'm
24, and a software engineer at Fractal Design.  I first learned about
raving almost 6 years ago through some friends who promoted a
little-known event in the northern wilds called Penelope's Web.  I never
actually got to go to a party until this New Year's, because I was too
busy geeking out at UCSC (graduated with honors, but no social life :)
My recent partygoing experiences have been intsrumental in snapping me out
of a long blue streak.  I just love to get up and dance, although I am
a little self-conscious about it.

That about covers it I think...

I hope you all are having a great Friday night!  I'm at work, trying
to get enough done tonight to justify going to Condensation
tomorrow night.  CF seems to have a great rep, and I had a fab time
at their NYE party.

I'm listening to Astralwerks' "Detroit: Beyond The Third Wave" which
is quite a bit different than what I usually listen to.  I bought
it on a whim when I had to return a defective Joni Mitchell disc :)

Peace,
Scott

I'm asking (begging) for a ride this weekend to cloud factory...
I was originally supposed to go with Andy (Perez) but I haven't been online
to get a hold of him... I live in So, San Jose, and I can meet you in San
Jose, Sunnyvale and anywhere in between.
Remember<~~ I totaled my car.. so the one I have now  is not reliable enough
to drive to the city, especially on hills like I would to get to the mappoint
probably.  I'd take public transit, but like *glitterboy* said it would just
be a pain to go from public transit to the mappoint then to the party,
specially since I do not know San Francisco on foot (yet!!)
For the trip home I might take cal train or take the early car home cuz I
have to work sooper early (well 1:30, but after partying all night, that is
pretty early :))
I f anyone can help, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU,
I will help you buy gas n' stuff, and if we go home early, I will buy you
caffeine for the trip home.  Tee Hee.

Howdy fellow partyers...

I can't decide for myself where to go this Saturday, so what do I do when
I can't make a decision for myself?  I let others decide for me...

OK, here's the dilema.  I am bringing some newbies to the scene with me,
but I can't decide between Ubiquitous (I know, I know, another money
making massive-- but it's got Jeno and Ghost-- two of my faves) and Cloud Factory (which by the way, I must say that I have never been to a CF
party before, but I have heard they are the BOMB).

Hmmm... go to see my favorite DJs or go experience a new party...
hmmmm....   anyone got any suggestions????

Thank y'all in advance!

Much luv...
Doughboy

P.S.  Went to the Space Children party last week in Honolulu...  WHEW! 
Great beats, weird vibe... maybe 'cause I'm not a local....  ya think?

Can someone recommend a conductive lubricant that I could use for the
crossfader on my mixer?  I just cleaned the thing with contact cleaner
(which claims to lubricate as well as clean...), but now the action is a
bit sloppy.

Any help will result in an instant boost of karma.

	thanks,
			jon

This just reminded me of one time at a party not too long ago... it was
late, 8 or 9 am, sun in the windows and all the fluorescence gone, but the
party still rocking.  I was chilling in a corner, got up and headed back to
the main room.  I came to the end of the hall and looked out on the
hard-core couple of dozen still jumping, everyone looking strange in the
natural light but dancing just the same, smiling and grooving and passing
the pipe while the music kept pounding...  And I couldn't help myself, the
hugest grin split across my face and I said out loud without even thinking,
"It's the TRIBE!"

Now, I didn't know any of those people I was looking at, I didn't meet
anyone or make any new friends that night, but I felt that tribe all the
same.  It was on another occasion, in the aftermath of another party, that
I thought back to that event and decided that I knew what I had meant.  YOU
ARE AMONG FRIENDS.  That's my slogan, that's what the tribe means to me.
It's not flowers and stuffed animals, it's not X, it's not techno.  It's
not even raving--I know the same thing from a lot of other scenes.  It's
trust in others, trust in their sympathy and understanding.  Along with the
responsibility to back it up.  When you know that you can count on others
to take you seriously and when you will do the same for them--that's the
rave.  You are among friends.

A blend of ecstatic experience and the tribal spirit within the realm of
music and dance.

For more on what I mean by "tribal spirit," see my other recent message
under "The Scene Is Dead?".

It really upsets me when I hear people talk about how much better things
were "back in the days". Let me just cut to it and say this:

If you were fortunate enough to have been exposed to the scene 2, 3 or 4
years ago, bad glad! I *wish* I was in your shoes. I've only been going
to parties for about a year consistently so I'll never know what it was
like back in '92 (which I guess is suppoed to have been THE summer). Or
'94 even. I keep hearing about all these things that I missed, but I'm
not complaining about it. I'll never know what it was like! You do! Be
glad!

Whatever happend back in the early days of raves was great I'm shure.
But it's gone now and it's time to move on. Will it come back? Probably
not. Even if it did, how would you know? Do you have a list to check
off?

It's too bad that some people feel the need to seperate "entertainment"
and "community". Raves for me have always sort of been this phenomenon
that transneds the distinction between entertainment and community and
finds somthing better than either of the two by themselves. "Well gee
Blake thats a lot of long, complex words but what do you mean?"

I think groups like Prodigy or Orbital are great. Their music kicks ass.
But I'll never know these people. It's just a CD to me. On the other
hand, I can listen to mix tapes by people like Boomerang, Micron,
Deepfog, Minor Minor, Greg S., Mars & Mystr-E, Ethan and countless
others and I know these people! They'er my friends, aquaintenses,
amigos. They are with me in the car, in my room, at work. It's such a
great feeling. I can kick back and/or dance to their set and shoot the
bull with them later on! They are my entertainment and my community.
That dosen't mean I won't go to a concert or massive ever. If the music
kicks it kicks. And there's been a few times when I talked with DJs like
Jeno and you get a chance to sort of know them.

If I just wanted community I'd go spend time at the local YMCA.

[regarding "what is a rave?", someone said:]

> A gathering of people trying to escape from reality thru dance & music & 
> assorted substances. 
				  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I was at my first rave, and i went outside to talk with S, my rave mom...
it was my first E and i was amazed at all of the positive energy i was
seeing and feeling... i said:

"Real life should be like this."

She said:

"This _is_ real life."

Raving, to me, is not about escaping from reality. It is, rather, about
escaping from the societally-defined bullshit and actively
defining/creating the reality that i want to live, a reality full of joy
and love. 

And, while substances, dance, and music are all wonderful tools toward
that end, to me, the most powerful tool is the smile in the eyes of the
person you're smiling at.

Love,

brian

Hi all,

This was a small rave that was a lot of fun. I got to meet some of you and
had a killer ride up to Santa Cruz. 

Where ever you guys go tonight, be safe and have fun. I'm not going to
either party due to previous engagements. :-) Seeya at the next one.

Morning all! Just woke up to do the daily morning routine, and while paging
through the newspaper, I come to the Timeout/Entertainment section to find
lo and behold, the article: Cyber-pop, Techno music, rock's not-new thing,
is catching on around the Bay.  This is from the Contra Costa Times
newspaper, which I believe also has their paper on line @
http://www.hotcoco.com (can't access my browser because of a corrupt file,
but checking mail is fine.).  Check it out!

Peace, MR2

EXACTLY. ESCAPING reality. the shit of the "real world", and re-creating 
reality as I want it to be. But unfortunately, when the lights & the sun 
come up I'm always a little disappointed that my hiatus from every-day 
reality is over & I have to be ready to go back to my office, to earn a 
living wich is the REALITY of life.  These two counter-realities are how 
I live. But I ain't complaining. Some people are stuck in the "real 
world" exclusively. At leats I can ESCAPE or rather take a breather from 
it on occasion.

 A grand observation. The smiles & energy can be alot more potent & 
enlightening and fufilling than any drug I've come across. 

   Much love, I'm going to bask in rays of the SUN. Outdoor free parties
have the most intoxicating energy. I think it has something to do with 
the sunlight mixing with the lovelight of all the peoples. Sees ya'll 
out at the BANDSHELL in GG PARK.

hi -

I just wanted to say that last week I went and checked out Thomas Trouble's
Trance and Jungle factory in Berkeley and thoroughly enjoyed the experience
- Greta at the counter was very cool.  I bought more records than I should
have... oops.

My roomate Meri enjoyed the fact that they have DJ champion videos - as in
DJs doin' their tricks with elbows, knees and chins, knees n' chins.

That's it.

  Anyone can take a vacation...  from their stressful job at the office.  
Escaping "everyday reality" (earning a living) is a partial solution.  
Finding a job that you enjoy will make you happier than any number of 
breaks could...

The author is listed as Douglas Rushkoff, and it's on Harper Edge
Books.   I couldn't find any info on it at Harper's web site.
Rushkoff, you may remember, wrote the book "Cyberia" which was a
nonfiction book that had some info about the local rave scene.  His
bio is at http://www.levity.com/rushkoff/index5.html and he's in the
"Cool" hall of fame at http://cool.infi.net/agent/rushkoff.html

After watching the program, it at least showed the inevitabilty of pot
use.  My favorite part was when an anti-drug county sheriff in Georgia
lost an election to a more laissez-faire challenger who was supported
by local growers(his brother was a grower!)

    I AM happy with my job. I'm very happy making my own way in the 
world.... over & underground. I dont need any SOLUTIONS. I dont seek 
raves to solve my problems, just like I dont use drugs to avoid them.
 mabe ESCAPE was the wrong word to use. Vacationing is a much better 
term. Dont weep for me, I am qite content.

I think that an imaginative, heathy, fantasy is a great way to fall asleep
every night.
Sure beats counting sheep. Actually. When you think about it. Counting
sheep in bed is pretty perverted.

Greeting and many thanks indeed to everyone that contacted me.
 Thanks to a generous man named Brett I now have a lift to condensation(
yippee!). If it is anything like New hope I will be an extremely happy
being.I'd love to put some faces to names so  to try and achieve this
I'll be wearing a long sleave gray T-shirt that says " roses '95" on the
back , amongst other things, and has a red and white rose on the arms. If
this is not enough of an incentive, a free massage is offered to anyone
who asks for one (I have had massage lessons from my old Tai Chi teacher)
Hope To see  all those smiling faces soon !
Lots of love 
Edx

A close friend of mine, who was involved in parts of the scene described
in "Cyberia", gave it a four-word review when handing it to me to read -
"it ruined my weekend".  I had to agree, from what I knew of the
techno-pagan-rave-cyber-mondo-protoWiReD scene in SF in 1991-1992 it was
pretty, uh, "fantastic".  And made everyone look like fools.  I guess I'm
not going out of my way to check out "Ecstasy Club" either.

There is actually an invite-only old-rave-fogey mailing list around
somewhere... (not on hyperreal).  There's a reason I don't want to be on
it.

I was thinking that there would be someone else there. :-) I've been
thinking out this for quite some time. Being mentally-divergent with
another person who you are in love with. Good music playing on repeat
(maybe 6 disks looping), candles, incense, and good stuff to take you to
the next level.

Hello,
My girlfriend and I need a ride to The Moon (no, not the Earth's only 
natural satellite, but the party by The People).
We can't leave until 1:00 a.m. from the Richmond District of SF.
If you can help, please page me @ 415.245.0646
Please do not respond by e-mail since I will be leaving work soon.
Thank You!

a few months ago the SF Chron ran a story on the front page of their
Datebook section on Rushkoff, and he described the fictional novel as being
about "an increasingly paranoid rave cooperative in Oakland."   Not too
encouraging a description ...

I think ABC's "Pot of Gold" was a fair portrayal of the realities of the
marijuana economy.  It also pointed out how much the cops benefit from
illegal drugs, as seizure laws gave the Washington cops the Volvos (!) they
were using to bust people, and such laws only work when the drug dealers
get rich first because the drugs are illegal ...

This was Peter Jennings' closing statement -- you make the call:

We think the government is absolutely right that we must educate our
children not to do drugs, including alcohol & tobacco. But that's an
obvious policy. We've also learned that marijuana is no longer simply
associated with a so-called "drug culture," and like it or not, marijuana,
marijuana for profit, now has roots in mainstream America.  This leads
inevitably to a discussion about legalization or touger laws.  That debate
is intensifying.  What people need to understand is that the current effort
to eradicate growing here at home isn't changing things very much except to
ensure that the price stays high. Really getting at the people who grow
marijuana no longer means closing the borders, but an enormously expensive,
invasive door-to-door campaign.  Which brings us back to that former deputy
sheriff in Bacon County.  He reminded us that you can only police the
people as much as they are willing to be policed.  And how much is that?


I know how we'd answer on this list ....

Denise Sullivan, the author, neglected to mention the techo channel on TCI's
DMX (17). It rocks 24 hours a day..no commercials. Check it out. 

Anyone know of any places to dance in the San Ramon-Walnut Creek-Concord
area? The bridge is a bitch at 4:00 in the morning.

I cancelled my DMX because they were playing too much cheesy club

Hmm... I dont have a ride and am not even sure why you are trying to get
to the Moon but if you need some help might I recommend Acen's "Trip II
the Moon".  It is a terrific track... one of the old-skool legends even...
in fact, I now feel inspired to write a haiku about it (and if you didnt
see that coming, then you havent been paying attention lately :-)

Omnipresent Orb
Can you be? A second home?
We search for water

Boy, I hope you werent expecting a serious reply :-)

But check this out..

  The earths axis is slowly changing anyways. You know this right?  They
prooved it while studying the egyptian pyramids I think..
  Now think about this.  You ever hold up a bicycle tire with both hands,
have some one spin it around. If so.. Did you notice how when you tilted
the axis to a certian degrees the tired would start to waubble out of
control?
  So what about when the earths axis gets to that point in time?
  Talk about shakin it up.

Pittsburg.   }:\

  Damn my head hurts..
  The fourth story of Club Release is almost finished..  Looks like a
lounge. And parts of the floor are glass windows, so you can see down into
the main dance floor.. Pretty cool..

 I talked like hell of people out of going to Ubiquitous tonight.. Funny
to. Cause I ain't even going out tonight. Hope all my friends have fun at
The Moon party. The location sounds more promissing than Pittsburg for
one..  =]:..

 So did nobody on the list hear of the car crashed that happened at the
last, free 5 dollar Ubiquidous? The fucked up thing about it too. The girl
describe to appear dead in the car. Well. I thought her discription was
familier. It's sad. The lady that witnesses discribed, I haven't seen her
at the ravEs since the last Obiquidous. I saw the cars, they were pretty
twisted looking. Fortunetly I did not see any victoms. But a friend of
mine, Mike saw it. And he was tripping out depressed for a long time.

 Why do I mention such a terrible tragidy? Well.. From the looks of the
last Ubiquitous. In my opinion, it was all a setup. "to me" it looked as if
crpower had the whole thing planned.. So "to me" it looked like crpower had
the party deliberatly broke up at 2AM. And if that is the case; I hold
crpower directly responcible for that girl having to leave early, and be in
a car with an intoxicated driver.. So "to me" it seems that if crpower
would of just been true to the scene, and just have thrown a party for the
love of it, instead of to take the money and run. This girl would still be
alive today..
 The girl that supposidly died, was the passanger in the car. The driver
lived. From the possition of the cars, it looked like one car was going,
way to fast through the flashing yellow light intersection, and the other
car ran through the flashing red light.. No one should ever run blindly
through thoughs yellow lights at night in the city.
 I don't know the facts man. Maybe crpower is for real. But "to
me"......Yanno... They suck.

That was interesting... three cool parties, so at different points in the
night I had decided to go to different ones.. finally I gave up and just
came home :)
Didn't go to cloudfactory because I called at 11 and the voicemail said
they had 50 to 75 tickets at a mappoint in downtown..  I figured I was out
of luck, but if I had been feeling a little better, I would have tried to 
go that probably would have been the most beautiful party...
Didn't go to ubiquitous because of all the previous hassle with that co
and also it was in pitsburg or somewhere unreal far away.
Didn't go to The Moon because .. dunno. just tired and basically decided
against going out. (that's normal sometimes right?)
So please give reviews, I'm dying to know what I'm missing here :)

Howdy doody fellow ravers...
Doughboy here...

Well, after all the struggling and inner turmoil I went through to figure
out where to go tonight, I ended up not going anywhere...  good thing is,
my fiance came up from Malibu just to see me!

Hope all of you are having the time of your lives...

I am desperate to know how Ubiquitous, Condensation (Cloud Factory), and
Moon turned out-- looking foward to all your reviews!

And to April...  hope ya got that computer stuff all figured out; if ya still need a disk, let me know, OK?

Much love to all of ya!

hi from milton keynes to all you sfravers
 it's sunday morning 9 a.m. and we have just come back from a good night of
raving and brought back a bunch of ravers to chill out together. so while it
is still fresh in our minds here is a review of HELTER SKELTER.

 there were at least 8000 if not more ravers from all over england,
scottland and wales there, 2 huge arenas + 2 small ones, outside fairground
rides, takes an average of 3 hours to get in, tickets cost =A325 ($37?),=
 very
commercial rave. but MAN!, it was WICKED!

Craig is taking back what he said before (regarding diversity) that raves
here in england _are_ multiracial. well, this one wasn't. it was  a largely
white event.

this is going extremely slowly because we are all so monged out (no idea how
to spell that) i'm not sure we can actually get this together now.=20

anyway, we all had the best rave in ages. they were playing everything from
jungle to hardcore to techno (ah, the experts are waking up :  gabba,
drum&bass jungle, hardcore 4 beat,  uplifting techno, acid techno,  hard
trance....) and i made sure to check everything out. i'm still a happy
hardcore chic, though. i know it's cheesy, and getting boring, ...and
slower! but it's still what i dance to best. i like techno, but at one point
tonite it got just a bit to fast for me. ben loved it! as i said, he's the
real raver!
 i must say that i am amazed at how the rave scene has diversified over the
last few years. i've only been in it for 3 years and i have noticed huge
changes. the more the rave scene diversifies the more we have to make sure
that we don't develop this tribalism that humans are so prone to.

all the others have to say, is: oh man, it was a wicked night. and: the
athmosphere was_ really_ good.

ben, have you got anything to say?
"it was all over too quickly. suddenly it was 7 in the morning and it was
all over.

Dan says: "i can't believe how much i was sweating last night."

Jo says: "Nicky Black Market is a genius."

well, it seems that this is as much as i can get out of them at the moment.
all you sfravers who are still out right now, still enjoying their saturday
night : hope you have a good one!

iris + ben + craig + dan + will + jo + selina + barney + karla

That's pretty fucked up to blame someone for this women's death. Things
happen for reasons. I don't believe that it's anyones fault other
then the drunk driver who killed her.

Using the reasoning you've described we could go on for hours discovering
who the real person responsible is. We could blame the alcohol company
for creating the alcoholic beverage, we could blame the
person who sold the alcohol to the drunk driver, we could blame the
employer of the drunk driver for putting him through so much stress that
he feels the need to get drunk, we could blame the person who discovered
alcohol in the first place, etc.... alcohol doesn't kill people, people
kill people. 

And why shouldn't people go to Ubiquitous? The line up looked really
good me. I would have gone if I didn't have plans for the evening. I'm
curious why you talked people out of going. Pittsburg is not as bad a
place as people seem to think. All that you hear about it is the crap that
happens, just like all news. I know a lot of people from P-town and it's
not as bad as people imagine. I'm from Martinez which is really close to
Pitt.

I wonder how many people are going to be po-ed when they get kicked out of
maritime at 5am. Unless they someone increase the curfew for tonight. 1
Hour isn't much, but it's still an hour.

It's 3:35 and I'm off to bed.... I'm going to the 50-100k person St.
Patricks day parade today in the city. I've never looked forward to a
Sunday in as long as I can remember. :-) Lots of bewsky for meesky!

i had one of the most profound experiences of my life on psylcoscibin
mushrooms (sp) tonite with a group of sisters after feeling i needed to
leave a production due to me being sick as hell recently...

what i'm trying to say is i left the show because i began to feel ill,
went home, and went on a medicine journey with some sisters...

and i say this with the most heartfelt sincerety as first and foremost a
mother, than as a citizen, that i stand by my beliefs in legalization of
drugs and that's a whole 'nother discussion...

but, i had a heartbreaking experience while walking my roommate's dog this
morning and walked  dwon to the space to see how things had gone and ran
into this dude...

i felt where he was at and i didn't like it.  i wouldn't want my kid to be
there.  it was'nt loving. it was scizhoprenic.  i duuno.  i send him lots
of love...please send them love...pleeeeze...

To DA List:
   I've been listening to the rain & some records since I got home an 
hour ago  . I went to both the The Sun & The Moon and am more than a 
little tired but very satisfied . I thought i'd drop a thank you note to 
Space Children , By the People &  Loveworks. I truly had a wonderful 
time, as did the majority folks I spoke with. Both parties were well 
attended and went without a hitch. I asked some of the uniformed 
security if there had been any trouble & the reply was there was not one 
incident or injury. 

THANK YOU!!!To all that made it happen.
Special thanks to O for letting us in
Special thanks to Steve Loria for that MEAN set. Fuck man... you went 
off!! Huggs to all!!! now ..of to bed,........

hi sfrave land!  a beautiful rainy sunday!  hope everyone is able to =
enjoy it. :)
  -last night due to my usual lateness, my honey Anthony and our buddy =
Matthew and i arrived at the cloud factory mappoint too late and tix =
were already sold out. :(  but as determined ravers we decided to try =
and talk our way in...i had 2 big tupperwares of oranges to give away =
(which i found out later were prob. unnecessary for that particular =
party).  anyway, we found the location and asked the folks at the door =
if there was anyway they could help us out.  and so here's my point of =
telling you that we couldn't get in:  the folks at the door were so darn =
nice about saying no, that it was okay with us.  we understood their =
reasoning and hey we didn't want the location messed up either.  it's =
such an awesome place to go.  so, once again thanks to the cloud factory =
folks for bing VERY kind and awesome.  we even got a recommend of =
alternate parties.  very cool :)  i hope that we'll be able to attend =
the next one.  if you went post a review....i'd like to hear about it.
 much love and hugs -

I am interested in hearing about the most incredible experience you've had
tabbing. I am compiling a list that I will post when I have ten hits. If you
want anonymity
you can get a free email address at www.bigfoot.com.

One of my top ten was:
We had just finished clubbing in South Beach, Miami (check out Bash). We were
heading back to Ft. Laudedale in a limo. It had bench setting (the L
config.). Their was a full moon and we were listening to DMA dance mix #2. We
"bonded" for the
entire way home. The limo had a moon roof which was open to frame the moon.
Awesome.

i just want to know who is holding the earth by its axis and tilting it =

!!!Hallo SFRavers!!!!
I'm yet another Laura, and i've been wanting to delurk for *quite* awhile, so
finally! :)
Those of you who take the time to read this, thanks!  first i want to say hi
to all my friends that i've met so far!! AnthonyE, Lara, Laura, Mike, Perry,
Fernandez, DeepFog (Tony, you spin some *exellent* grooves!)  ummmmmmmmmmm...
there were *so* many (i'm speaking of Warmth, 2 weekends ago)  I have lurked
here for awhile, but Anthony was so nice to give me a SFRaves laminate.... so
i'm easy to spot ! :)
  Also Thomas (GlitterBoy), who's become so popular since he's jammed into
the SF rave scene!  (he usually drags me away from the depths of home, for
*great* parties)
I came from Utah...and before that, North Dakota, and havn't been in CA for
too long (since May) and so  far, i've been so welcomed, and am excited to
meet more ravers and maybe lure more of my Utah friends out for these
*awesome* parties!  
   ALSO.. there is a nice state park (Garin, i think it's called) right
behind my house, (in Union City)and it is so so nice.. i think it would be a
really good time if the SFRavers might be interested in a daytime picnic back
there... ?? there is lots of hiking, and lots of trees, and even a little
lake, and *much* privacy, and it might be nice to have a little drum circle?
  (just a suggestion)   Who knows! Mayhap you'll find a bit of mushrooms??
 (i have)  SO if anyone is interested in co-ordinating a smaller event like
this.. please contact me, and i'll put in all my good energy, and extra time!
I want to thank everyone for making me so welcome, and i am looking foreward
to the  bright future!
and everyone have an *super* day!!!

This is going to be a bit long.  My best time on X was during the
Cloudfactory New Years party in Monterey, to understand the context we
need to step back a week or so.  California had been expecting some
enormous storm previous to New Years. The news swore it would be on
Tuesday, which came and went as sunny as ever.  The media checked itself
and picked another day to swear by.  This went on for several days until
"The Great Big Storm" became a something of a local joke.  Then came New
Years and two tabs.  Just after the count down my friends and I were
standing outside doing the hugging thing when "it" came.  That's right
"The Big Fucking Storm" hit and I would have to say (given the drug
induced circumstances) it was a truly memorable moment.  When everyone
realized that God's wrath was upon them the only logical thing to do was
laugh and scream, not surprising.

and that's the short, short version

My best time on E actually came recently.  I was in New Orleans last
weekend, meeting with some of my old friends from college.  One of my best
female friends had never done it before (E has a bad rap as a "sex drug" in
the South).  I brought it as a present for her and I to do some bonding. I
had sat on the capsules on the plane by accident, so we had to mix it up in
some O.J. to avoid the bitter taste.  It hit us like a Mack Truck in the
local 24 hour drug store (where we were buying candy and toys).  The lights
were impossibly bright in there, and we went nuts buying E toys, racking up
a bill of $40.00 or so.

We travelled to all of our old haunts, stopping by to distribute all of the
presents we had just bought.  It was a warm, humid New Orleans night, and
as we passed by all of the mansions on St. Charles Avenue, we were reminded
that New Orleans is unlike anywhere else on Earth, where the masses of
humanity mix despair with delight to achieve an imperfect but beautifully
dangerous synergy.

We spent the rest of the evening in her old shotgun apartment, candles
reflecting against French doors and the mouldings of high ceilings,
catching up on the past two years, her in Scotland, me in San Francisco,
wondering where the time went and realizing that two years is nothing in
the grand scheme of things.  We fell blissfully asleep at 7AM, only to
arise at 10 to find ourselves with renewed faith in the immortality of
mankind.

Does anyone know where to get full tape labels that cover the whole side of
a tape.  I don't like the little ones that come with the tape.  The only
thing that I've seen is a laser printer type, but they're like $50 for a box
of 100.

You know..  It is obvious that, were both are pretty much clueless on this
subject. I, my self, can't think of one thing other than music, I don't
require to "get a clue" on.. <--Just fishing for agreement. =]

But it is a known fact that the earths axis (the north pole thingy and the
south pole nStuff) is slowly tilting.
And the bicyicle tire does actually walbble at a certiant degrees because
of the earth gravitational tug, spinning the equators around in a loop like
fashion. Or so I was told by TLC sometime long ago.
Now, lets use the Suns gravity, instead of the Earth gravity. And the Earth
spinning, instead of the tire spinning.

I don't know.  But I seem to beable to amigine a time where; both equators
will be tugged at by the sun, in a very uneven, and unstable matter due to
the spinning of the planet, that ends up causing a very tremendous earth
quake. Or worse!
Maybe I should write a freakin book or something..

Clueless Jeff.
PS Get a clue.

Yea, yea..

  In theory, one that I believe in, there are an infinite number of
parallel universes (time-lines).
  So if crpowder diliberatly "Got Over". Then " I " blame them for bumping
us into this tragic time-line.

  It is obivious, because you posted your comments to the public, that your
just out to look compassionate infront of everybody. Bla, bla bla... It
does get old yanno. (kind of like my dance at 5 in the morning).
  "It's not pollite to contradict me infront of the kids, dear"
  "If you guys have a problem. Take it outside"
  "Excuse me. But, can I talk to you for a second? In private!"

  But everytime I have gone to the Pittsburg skating rink, I had fun. But I
find driving up there, for such an unreliable party like Ubiquitous, one
that prooved to be bad luck for alot of people in the past, to be
illogical. I would rather drive to LA for a CoolWorld party.
  Bottom line though. As far as Ubiquitous goes. I quess I just don't trust
them. They come on here to advertize there little party in Pittsburg, but I
have yet to see them stick up for them selves after all they were acussed
of from the last party they threw. Like, what happened to all the DJ's?
Pretty fishy how the backup location was equiped with a full bar, just like
the original venu.

 Someone tell me to stop mumbling.. This subject does not even interest me.

Any Ubiquitous reveiws? Anybody keep track of which DJ's played?

 Sorry you didn't actually get to attend the party mac, but it truley was
a sight to behold. I have been to a few cloud factory partied since my
arrival here in sf late last fall, and this one truley was one of the most
amazing. 
 My experience was pretty nice, the evening started out kinda weird, maybe
because I brought a new person into the scene and he didn't feel quite at
home there, i guess it just wasn't for him. too bad. but after a while
everything started to flow just great, I wish I could have danced
downstairs more, but the heat  and condensation <hehe> kinda made me a
little woozy. 
 The best part of the party was after 3 am tho. thats when all the really
great stuff happened, party thinned, cops stopped bugging us, ppl relaxed,
loosened up, all the tension was gone, and it made me feel great.
 I have to say one thing tho... that last hour of the party was the
funnest I have ever had in the morning!!! 
It was like that kung foo fighting song, then into "TECNO RAGE
RIIIIIIOOOOTTTT!!!"   heheh... it was a blast and histerical!!!

well thats all I have to say about that... thanks for the bandwidth!



	love

Hey everyone!

Got this from the insert of one of the new CD's in last week. With all the
ranting lately, I thought we could all benefit.

Enjoy!

"The term Underground is not measurable by sales, nor by income, or
notoriety. Rather, it represents an approach to this music we call House and
Techno, a desire to push foreward, to constantly evolve an idea and take it
all the way, often for the sheer hell of it. To reject compromise, to
preserve the integrity of the music, to go beyond the base standards set by
the mainstream and commercial requirements of the music industry. To make
music simple because it *must* be made, and not because it will sell by the
bucketload or make the artist a household name for five fleeting minutes.
Some of the artists here may aim to rock the dancefloor, others to mess wit
your head, but all will do so on their own terms."

"Taken into this context, the concept of Underground becomes a self-imposed
quality control mechanism, a reason to create and a code of honour. And they
are not alone. Each artist here is part of a network, a system of links that
spreads for local focal points and core clubs across the UK to reach out to
a global electronic network of musicians and dj's, clubs and labels, via
magazines and internet sites, distributors and shops that ensure that this
music will never be owned by the grey men in suits. They represent a
generation who have grown up with House and Techno, this strange, rhythmic
and challenging music that originated in Detroit and Chicago and has gone on
to criss-cross the planet."

"A music that finds its roots in all previous music but is tied to no
established form, to which nobody owns the copyright, but to which everyone
may stake a claim. Whereoutdated concepts of verse-chorus-verse 'songs' and
so-called 'real instruments' have been left far, far behind. A music that
does not sit comfortably with the media's obsession with personality,
appearance, and the artificial preconceptions of pop. And to which, as a
result, too many people are denied ready access. This compilation is but a
snapshot of something far larger, one of hundreds released every month, part
of a mountain of music that constantly grows in size where evolution is
inevitably maintained pure because it must be. The future may seem to rush
towards us with ever increasing speed, but the Underground will always be
there to welcome it. Be in no doubt, across the UK and beyond, the
Underground is alive and kickin'."

Tom Robbins, Magic Feet, May 1996

So the question remains...Are you Underground?

:)

hello and sorry about posting this to the list, but i am getting desperate...

I need someone to look after my cat in their home for the cost of cat
supplies plus not-very-much money for a period of 1-5 months beginning the
29th of March.
If one person could watch her the whole time that would be great, but I
have someone who can take her from May until i return sometime in
september, so if you can only watch for a month or so that is alright as
well.

she's a great and very mellow cat.

any help is appreciated.

Subject: Entertainment Weekly Magazine's Guide to Raving!
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Ack!

I'm at the grocery store in the check-out line, when I look over at the
magazine rack and a small headline on a magazine catches my eye:  "Plus:
Rave On!  A Consumer's Guide to the New Music Revolution"  I'm like "oh my
god!  I cannot believe that!"  And of course I pick it up cuz I just *hafta*
know.  Inside there's a detailed "consumer's guide" to the different types
of techno, and (I confess to being stumped here) they mentioned some kind of
music called "illbient".  Now my original assumption is that there's no way
in hell a hollywood entertainment magazine would know of more genre types
than I would (not that I'm the queen of genre types, but a hollywood
entertainment magazine? come on!), and assumed they had meant "ambient", but
now I'm questioning myself.  Folks:  is there really a genre called
"illbient"?  And if so, what the hell is it?  Heaven knows that a consumer
such as myself wants to be up & in the know on these things!  Heaven forbid
that I, a supposed raver, should be getting my up-to-the-minute knowledge
about raving & techno genres from an entertainment magazine.  Something is
very very wrong with this.  I took a brief look at the article, they talk
about how "alternative" music is now dead (i.e. how alternative/grunge/etc
has become everything it was attempting to combat) and that the new music
form that's gonna hit the markets & become the big thing is Techno!  And of
course all our big time favorites have pictures in the article, Chemical
Brothers, Prodigy, Orbital etc.  And a couple of ones I hear in the
mainstream less often, like Goldie or Aphex Twin, who are both pictured in
there. (Boy is Goldie gold!  a huge mouthful of gold teeth, very strange
looking.)  And god what a hideous picture of Keith Flint from Prodigy, he
really looks like he's about to explode into a mass of blood, green hair,
sweat & piercings. Yuck!  

Anyway, it's all a little strange and disconcerting, & a little in line with
the recent debates of "what's happening to our underground", they list all
the genres, compare drum & bass to jungle, with explicit descriptions of the
different types (now I'll know how to tell them apart finally! ;), & talk
about how big name bands & groups are changing their sounds to incorporate
the electronic techno sound, like U2 & David Bowie & Smashing Pumpkins.
This is something I'd been noticing on the radio too, did just hear a
Smashing Pumpkins song (prior to reading the article) and I swear that I
heard a 303 in there!  And there's a definite 303 line going on in that Tori
Amos song Blue Sky, which is actually a pretty groovy song.

But anyway, I must admit, in spite of my belief that the underground will
maintain itself as deemed necessary, that I am a bit alarmed to find all the
secret magical things I first found 1 1/2 years ago to be described in
detail in a Hollywood entertainment magazine.  And I wonder too, now that
the "alternative/grunge" scene is "dying", what happens to our rave scene
after it becomes mainstream.  Of course, our underground will continue I
believe, but at the same time, if there's anything that can kill it, it will
be the mass commercialization of techno I believe, nothing saps & drains the
life out of anything, nothing will wring everything out of it that it can,
nothing will beat a dead horse till there's nothing left but pulp, but the
frantic "Scramble for Dollars Wringer" that America at large will put the
scene thru for its own end.  IMO.  I'm curious how long the grunge scene
existed prior to its becoming famous, and how threatened/protective/fearful
did they all feel (if at all) when it did start making it big.  And is there
any sort of an underground grunge type scene still?  Or has it all been
squashed by its own commercialization?  I wonder if the history of the
grunge scene will predict our future.  And on the other hand, maybe the
introduction of techno into the mainstream will help to improve quality and
the evolution of mainstream music.  I for one started liking commercial
music quite a bit better after the alternative stuff started really coming
thru, I felt that there was some good quality there that was entirely
lacking prior to its introduction (ie: Aha, Wham, etc!  Ya gotta admit,
Nirvana was definitely better than that earlier 80's crap that was being
played.)  I wonder I wonder...

Anybody who's interested in checking out the article, the magazine is called
"Entertainment Weekly", page 36.


Love
Shawna

Hey all...this was such a GREAT party!! I loved it! Thanks to Orson for
the laminate, and all the nice SFravers who came up to me to tell me who
they where...(although I only remember April, because she came up to me
when I was sobering up). Anyways, I have to give props to Micron because
he kept the main dance floor going for his entire set, I danced in front
of the tables for most of it until I couldn't take the heat anymore
after a long time. All and all it was a great party, to bad about that
fight that happened out front, I was outside when I first started, kinda
scary, but still a great party! :)

i hate commercialization of things too, it's trying to sell the passions 
and beauty of music but hey.. thats life.
illbient is supposedly a type of music that DJ Spooky has created. it's 
kinda ambient jungle that's described by some as disturbing and chilling 
and well it's just ill. but in a cool way. if that makes any sense?
so that's what illbient is. his friend coined the term when someone asked 
him what it was.

Nope. The reason that I replied to everyone is because I think there are
others who feel as I do. About how you pointed the finger at an entity as
being responsible for someone's death. I didn'd do it to gain any
attention or brownie points. I happy to be a sincere  and caring guy who
has a heart. Anyone that knows me would tell you this. I'm old enough to
know that impressing people means jack. As long as I'm happy then my life
will be happy and that's all that matters. Compation gets old? I totally
disagree with you on that. Life is about love and people, and you can
never care too much for others. I'm a sensitive artist type, hate me for
it.

I'm up way too late listening to a killer soundtrack (Lost Highway).

I can't wait for my next party. I didn't dance all weekend (well not
really on Friday, because I was feeling sick.) I am going to boogy down. I
love the Goa Trance and Jungle man.... LTJ Buken is the bomb. Takes you to
the next level, above the clouds, believe the ozene layer, - away from the
shit, away from the routine.

Daft Punk is awesome. Anyone have there new album? I got the single
today... nice.... I spend way to much money on CDs. But it's well spent
cash....

Did you hear that Leanna Bobit got killed?

Yeah, she was driving in her car and got cut off by some dick.

That's a "Condor" bartendress' joke. 

Here's another one:

There's a women who is getting hooked up by her friend for a blind date.
She told her friend that she was tired of being pushed around and run out
on. So her friend found her someone and sent him over. 

The door bell rings and the women sees a man with no arms or legs. He says
his name is Bob. Then she says, "What can you do for me?". He says "Well,
I can't push you around because I have no arms. And I can run out on you
because I don't have any legs". And she says, "What can you do for me?".

"Well, I rang the doorbell didn't I?", says the guy.

Goodnight, I have to be @ work in 6 hours!.... aaaa....

hello, my merry kids, men women, girls and boys.
  I went to  a party this weekend. it was called con-den-sa-shun.  It was
fun.
I met a lot of you kids there. Hello, everyone {{<3 :) <3 :) ~~ (: <3 (: <3}}
smiles and love in a hug.
  Let's see, brett, i waited at the mappoint, but i found a ticket before you
got there, so i'm sorry i didn't get to meet you, but i will.  The mapoint
was fun though, I finally met micron... after hearing *so* many good things
about you :). and i saw a lot of you kids from home too, love you all.
  It was a mess getting to that point though.  andy andy andy... well, i got
up there at any rate.  surrounded by some *drama*.  see, someone forgot their
ticket so we went back to get it. A human error, we were only 15 minutes away
from  his house... no big deal.  but someone got mad. Sweety, your anger was
unnecessary.
  Upon stepping into the party, i saw so many *shiny happy people holding
hands*
Names and faces i remember... Li, i will figure out how I know you; Orson,
faboo seeing you again; vertigo, smile forever; boomerang, so nice to have a
smile to go along  with the name; Macadio, i met you but i don't think you'll
remember me. but that is okay, i understand the state of mind you were in...;
brian denny who came up to say high when i was nearly passed out from taking
so much ginseng; how many more of you are there??? bao, with the glowsticks;
orson's cute little asian friend who gave me his laminate because i forgot
mine (I don't remember yer name) the three guys I met downstairs by the water
table, but I don't remember yer names!!!!! Vlad who works at city e; smurfy,
i remember meeting ya, but I don't remember when or how :/; god,(<~~ yes i
met god j/k) and the millions of other souls i met that night... i'm  trying
to cover the sfravers i guess on this post.
  I stayed upstairs most of the night by the ambient, but i was concerned
about my friend lauren who was pear pressured into taking "e" she did not
have fun. I tried to take care of her, but I couldn't do it all night.  the
amount of time I watcher her zapped a lot of energy from me.  I wish she
haddent taken that evil (for her) e.  
  I loved yer set Micron... you played a song at the beginning of yer set, I
think, the one with the words that was really pretty.  They played the song
again upstairs later on...
  And I remember someone mixing some big band ambient upstairs, that was
cool, fun to dance too.
  But it was scary cuz I fell asleep and when I woke up someone was spinning
some dark ambient and it SCARED me. I thought i was in a night mare
looooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww bass  sound with a high
sssssskkkkkkkkkkkrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeecccccccccccchhhhhhhhhhhhhh over
it. it was like someone singing a really high note, but not as bad as mariah
carey.  the heat downstairs was not bad at all, compared to another party I
was at when we devirginized the location. the ceiling wasn't leaking too bad,
just enough for a slightly slickery floor.
  I missed Lara.  I haven't seen my baby girl for days... 
  Nice to see all the kids I drove up with... plus all the kids from
sunnyvale and north san jose and santa clara and cupertino and saratoga.
  okay so, for those of you who didn't know, my number one reason for going
to parties is to meet people and see all those I *love*.  But you can bet yer
butt that if the music did'n't come in at #1 the music is about as close as
it can get...
   I guess since I am still considered a *newbie* (bout half a year) my ideas
will change... maybe. But the people vibe is strongest for me.  I like to
make ya  smile. And another little addon, I rave sober, so when I say I
*love* you, I mean it, it is not drug induced love. and I can honestly say
that all the beautiful people in the party that night were loved by me.  
  I hope to see all yer smiling faces again very soon!!!!!!!!.
smiles:)

my best time on e was my first time. 
I was in santa cruz at the subud house.
I hugged everyone i saw who looked happy.
and hand orgy was fun fun fun.
and met some people who i love and are forever bonded to.
I met charlotte (the baroness) on my first e and she was *such* a nice girl.
plus her roommate hayden (hey, Hayden if you are here, call me!!!)
One of my favorite things was taking a shower when i got home...
Laying in my bad and sleeping, then waking up and feeling the sheets on my
legs.
Then smoking a cigarette (I have since quite) and having that feeling come
back to me.  Also, smoking a green bowl and having it come back.

okay, but given my first awesome 'e'xperience, why do i not do it... I was
taken advantage of, but my friends were there in time and helped me.  Some
guy was asking to have sex with me and I said no.  Then he wanted me to go
sit in his car with him, i said no. then he wanted me to get more e with him
in town, i said no.  My friends saw this and said... she is staying here with
us. More, but I won't get into it.
 I remember peaking... I was smoking in my friends car (the one who saved me)
and I said... oh my god... then he gave me a hug.  I call it my peak hug...
and ever since then I have been a different person.  I need to take him and
my other merry crew of friends to meet you all. they are just in a serious
lack of funding.
 yeah, so my first was the best and i hugged everybody.  my line was "hi, i'm
april, this is my first time on 'e', can i have a hug??" and everyone was
more than willing.
No bad vibes. except the one.  I hid from him all night (he scared me)
so that's it.
smiles:)

Yeah, I have heard the term "illbient" a few times in fact. My friend has a
cool dub CD called "illbient" or something with it in there. I don't know
exactly the difference between illbient and ambient, but I think its a
little more subtle psychodelic and has some different sounds than would
otherwise be found. If anyone knows more, please post, and let us all know :)

  I know I'm late posting, and others have already wrote reviews, and I 
don't want to be redundant, so I'll try not to, but I just wanted to give 
a very big _THANK_YOU_ to Cloud Factory again for providing us with such 
a wonderful evening.  It was an outrageous time, I saw very few people 
who weren't beaming with delight.  And yes, Micron did rip it up 
downstairs. :D
  Thank you again, to Cloud Factory and to the wonderful people who 
attended.  Between everyone, it made for a beautiful night.  :)

And then some idiot would plant a bomb next to it, blow it up in the
name of some religion or other, and we would mourn the scattered bits
and wonder what could have been.  Such is human nature.

Cry not for Earth.  Earth will be here long after the humans have
poisoned and warred themselves and 99% of all other life on this rock
right out of existance.  And the earth will simply give rise to new life
forms.  And perhaps one day they'll pull your jaw bone out of the dust
and ponder what level of intelligence you must have had.

I had to ask a friend of mine if it was a fun party, even though I 
was there all night long.

Apparently it was.  

Something I know, but had to rediscover is that I should not do 
anEthing when I'm not in the right mood.  Recently I've been taking 
it with a purpose, other than just having fun.  The purpose being to 
help me find a girl. 
FYI, not a good idea.
It just makes the longing worse and me seem pitifull.  
                                           
The whole reason I kept going to raves after my first one was that I 
was having fun in a way I never had before.  I was meeting awsome 
people, hearing out of this world music, and having positve trips. I 
could have gone to that rave (Rave to Save the Redwoods) and had an 
okay or bad time, and said that was fine but I'm not going back.  But 
I had an awsome time.  I enjoy people, music, and drugs; generally in 
that order. 
I found a home and a family in the Rave Scene.

I'm not having fun right now.  I'm just going through the paces.  
Find party, do somEthing, get high, get nothing, get depressed, go 
home. It was a really good party and I was unable to enjoy it. Shite. 
I feel bad for the Cloud Factory crew because I did not contribute to 
the vibe. I was kind of a downer.  

I felt disconected all night.  I haven't really felt a group vibe in 
a while.  I remember inhaling the vibe out of the air a the 3 year 
Harmony party, and physically feeling it in the air at the Gathering. 
The vibe is obviously out there. I just don't feel it these days.

Back to the party.  This was the first party I've actually looked 
forward to in a while. I went to Cloud Factory's new years party and 
Cloud House.  Both were awsome.  I knew alot of my good friends were 
going to Condensation and I was looking forward to spending time w/ 
them.  The space was well decorated and the lights were cool. Music 
was really good. 

Ack.  
It is hard for me to be postive when I don't feel it in my gut.
The party was good and I will not miss the next Cloud Factory party.  
I will buy my ticket in advance.
I will post a positve review when I am able.


-Joel

My friends will always be in my heart.

After the September Child stage there are many other variations!!

Opposed to the Spetember child there's always the:

The Old Sckooler: circa 89-92.

How to spot them: Their clothes have a washout look, the prints of the
T-shirt are                     faded and have dates that say: 1991. 

Where to find them: In the background, in the dark, at the ticket booth and
All the                         anversary  celebrations.

Internet characteristic: They hardly posts (because every thread they have
seen                            already) but when they do it's to correct
someone's                               misinfomation.

Pros: They answer all your rave related questions. They know the cultural  
significance of the fifteen minutes solos. They remember 15 minutes solos!
        THey have cool stories to tell, esp ones like, "It used to be $5 to
get in  and you get free water. 

Cons: The complain ALL the time. About how the scene was better, (See quote
above).
        How the ravers now don't have the have the same attitude. Sometimes
when    they    post you realise your smallness. They remind you all the
time            they've been around.

Sometimes they also are......

The happy-43-year-old OLD skooler.

How to spot them: Their age, pretty obvious really. They dance the way THEY
want,           usually having to give them lots of space.

How you find them: Usually with their spouces, or they're telling you their
spouce          tells them to grow up!. In the misdt of all these          
        young people that worship him or her for his/her longevity. Still  
                dancing when all the 20 year old have had it.

Pros: You can't believe they are still at it! You want to be like them.

Cons: If you're not paying attention and get a glance of them, they make
you think               of your parents at home, wondering what you're up
to.

___________________________________________________________________________
_________


The DJ

How to spot them: One shoulder is lower than the other. They always have an
enterage                surrounding them. Managers, friends that needed to
get in free,            groupies of the male  or female perswuasion. With
their gear.



Where to find them: Behind the decks, or hanging out with other DJs. They
NEVER              dance. Behind their decks at home.

Characteristics: They are either ultra arrogrant, or they are really cool.
There is                never an inbetween.

Pros: We NEED them. If they're good, they make you estactic. You life
depends on                      them.When they are starting out, they give
you tapes, they                         play at your parties all for FREE.

Cons: When they suck, your life feels like it's over. If they're your
friends you     never see them, because they are either playing, or
practiing.                      They don't go to the raves unless they're
playing at it. you don't go out         with them and when you go to the
one they're playing at they are surrounded.

Edition 3: This is no neccesarrily evolutionary, but you have to reach the
first to get to 2 and 3. Here we have the ultimate raver, the
about-burnout-raver, the born again raver.

THE ULTIMATE RAVER:

How you spot them: The have all the clothes that you want. They have more  
                glowsticks, and bike lights on their bodies then even the  
        average raver. In the day, they look the same sans                 
glowsticks and bike lights.

Where you find them: EVERY rave. Seen dancing anywhere there are strains of
techno,                         in malls down the street, anywhere.

Characteristic: They are always there. When they wake up the first thing
they do is              put hard trance on and play it real loud. THey know
everybody.

Pros: Best person to call when you want to go out. THey'll aways go with
you,and they know where it is.They give you warning and directions to
secret          parties. You can count on them being there. They lend you
lots os tapes.

Cons: The can become About-burnout-raver (see below). They don't understand
when    you're tierd, or don't want to go out.

Pray they don't live in the apt above you.

___________________________________________________________________________
__________

THE ABOUT-BURN-OUT-RAVER.

How you spot them: They look more ragged than thier 12 year old teddy bear.
Their                   shoes are a non-descript colour of blah. They
haven't washed                  their hair for a month, in fact they
haven't done that to                    thier bodies or clothes for a while
either.

Where to find them: Again at every rave. BUt this time, really really at
every rave.
                 Including clubs on the weekdays, and cafes that play
techno in the                   afternoon.
        
Characteristics: They are always high, of coming down or about to come up.
When they               laugh it's a full body laugh where their heads flip
backwards, and          jaws lock. 

How you find them: In the day, SLEEPing, admist a pile of water bottles,
and fliers                      and  miscellaneous MESS. In fact they can
trace each bottle                       to the specific rave. They are
tierd all the time until they                   get to one.

Pros: The are great fun. THey always can find you the drugs you want, and
it would        be great. Sometimes they give you some free. 

Cons: They never have any money except to go to raves   and for drugs and
keeps   borrowing of you, for food and cigarettes. 


What happens to them: Usually a hiatus where they sit in front of the
computer and                    lives in the rave mailing  lists, and seems
quite bitter                    about not going out, but not having the
energy or money.                        Become a born again raver (see
below). 

Worst case senario: Rehab, or parents.


________________________________________________________________


THE BORN AGAIN RAVER. (Straight edge)

How to spot them: They are walking in a straight line. They TELL you.

Internet characteristics: Their posts usually contains some promotion of
raving sober

Characteristics: They are clean. They leave at 5am. They always have a     
        bemused look when you see you fall over, or curled up in
                 the corner, or bowing to the speaker.


Pros: No more fights about who's driving home. He or she always does. 

Cons: You are aware that they will remember things that you don't or
pretend not to.         The can laugh at you and there is nothing you can
use as amunition.

A rave is...the music, thumping bass, it's a post modern 
trajectory in music, a postmodern carnival, where the participants can 
find group cartarsis. At once part  of Attali's repetition model yet at 
the same time defies it, and 
opps forgot i'll look the two other post modern music people's name sup.
This is that damn essay I have been writing for my ethnomusicologist 
prof.

First off  I would like to say out of the 165 messages that I just scanned
through this morning I would have to say that only about 3 were of any
relavence to me. They were all threads and stupid things except for the scooby
doo joke that was good. I would have to agree with Wayne on that only about 30%
of the posts are of any substance, but anyways I will not bog down the list
with my irration of NRR posts. The CF party went off!! BTW I remember you April
you little cutie pie! and the fight took place out side the party it did not
involve two ravers from the party it was a group of ravers out side smoking and
some Mission street thugs. But NW wayz scott and his crew did the place up
grand, the parrashoots and lasers were excellent. The alter was very good lots
of intellegent lighting and black lights some many good happy SFR's and people
"not on the list" but that still had the vibe this party was like home for me.
It was the true essence of "family" I had such a good time, now on to the DJ's
Maya rocked the house with some smooth melodic type teKno, joy from New mexico
rocked with hard acid trance, Ed colmar played similiar and we was real good.
My boy Micron (dan) rocked the house with some electro trancy break beaty natty
boom batty sounds!! but one thing I did hear a lot of people asking me was
"what time are you playing?" and I responded with "im just here to party and
shake my stuff" so that made me think Hmmmm... Maybe I should be on the CF's
next lineup? so scott if you reading (hint,hint) J/K I don't want you to fell
*pressured* or anything =)  But this was by far a good party, vibe, space, DJ's
and all in my book 5 stars. Sorry for not mentioning any one one the list but
there were to many of you to name so instead of missing a name I would rather
not say any. But you all know who you are and I love you all my SFR Family.
Sorry so long and for the BSP.

Hey waittaminute!

I have a few corrections here...

-----Original Message-----
From:	Nailvarnish [SMTP:playdoh@cats.ucsc.edu]

The DJ

How to spot them: One shoulder is lower than the other. They always 
have an
Enterage surrounding them. Managers, friends that needed to get in 
free,            groupies of the male  or female perswuasion. With 
their gear.
*** Ok, funny and Frightenly true (esp the lower shoulder bit. And 
don't forget the DJ 'hunch' from leaning over the turntables for hrs 
on end...).

Where to find them: Behind the decks, or hanging out with other DJs. 
They
NEVER dance. Behind their decks at home.
*** Ah, strike ONE.  I know many MANY dancing DJ's.  One of the main 
reasons Dj's are 'born' is because they are dissatisfied with other DJ 
mixes ('I could better.  If they mixed in track blah blah, instead of 
blah blah it woulda sounded cool...)  DJ's actually dance pretty funny 
since they spend most the time 'bouncing' to their mixes and are 
usually bouncing on the dance floor after their mixes.***

Characteristics: They are either ultra arrogrant, or they are really 
cool.
There is never an inbetween.
***There's always a middle ground., It just depends where You are on 
that Meter of Life...***

Pros: We NEED them. If they're good, they make you estactic. You life
depends on them. When they are starting out, they give you tapes, they 
play at your parties all for FREE.
*** Strike TWO.  Many DJ's exhibit the same characteristics even after 
they've been around for a while...***

Cons: When they suck, your life feels like it's over. If they're your
friends you     never see them, because they are either playing, or
practiing.
They don't go to the raves unless they're playing at it. you don't go 
out with them and when you go to the one they're playing at they are 
surrounded.
*** Strike THREE.  A lot of DJ's are usually out @ parties to see what 
music/ style/ vibe that other DJ's are creating.  They also 'learn' 
from each other, usually incorperating mixing styles into their own 
sets...  Every DJ want's to keep fresh in the scene and not sound 
'burned' (i.e. dated) so, yeah, you can see quite a few DJ's if you 
know who's who out there... ***

Paz Y amour,

As far as I know (I was downstairs when it happened) a van with six people
in it stopped in front of our space.  A couple of them jumped out and
walked up to someone on the street wearing an A*didas shirt.  They tried to
jump him and one of our door people managed to help kind of get in the way
(he got hit in the face but not very hard).  The people left.  They came
back again a few minutes later and tried the same shit.

I'm not exactly sure that is how the whole story goes, (anyone from cf who
was at the door can fill in here ?) but what we got out of it was that
these guys didn't like the fact that this attendee of condensation had an
A*didas shirt on.

We proceeded to stock the front entry way with three or four big, tall
people and although the idiots drove by six or seven more times, they never
got out of the car again.

love scott

Subject: Phunky Phoenix Review

Just wanted to let you all know that there's a lively scene in Phoenix.  I go down for baseball annually, but since I travel with my 88-year-old surrogate grandmother (oh boy, that's another story), I can't do my usual all-night stuff.  However, I was able to get out twice to sample what's going on down there.

Friday night was Utopia, which is a club that's moved to Scottsdale from Las Vegas.  Not bad for a club... interesting since it's 21 and over until 1 a.m. (when the bar closes) ... and then they let in the 18-21 crowd, so things became more raver-like after 1.  Lots of miniskirts and giggly girls fixing makeup in the bathroom, and lots of cruisy vibes ... but also many friendly faces and great dancers too.  Could have lived without the security goon standing on a ledge between the bar and dance floor like Robocop.

The highlight for me was a live drummer -- his name is something like Shaireen (I have it written down at home w/his phone #s) and he was INCREDIBLE.... has a setup of six or seven drums including conga, plus misc. cymbals, set up right in front of the speakers, and he plays intermittently with the djs ... and he doesn't miss a beat, goes into a trance-like state and ROCKS!!!!  He dances and drums, and dances and collapses, and drums and kneels down in front of the speakrs.  Absolutely amazing, the first time I've  ever seen a live drummer work so closely with a dj ... it took the music to another level. He's from Orange County,  works/records with the Hardkiss brothers a lot up here, says he's played at Spundae.  I'd sure love to see him bring his amazing stuff to one of our parties sometime.

Saturday night,I was invited to a small underground called Phunky Town.  Arrived around midnight, a small warehouse near downtown Phoenix, saw a cop cruising slowly by, turn around, cruise by again.  When I asked at the door if they get busted, they said never had, that the cops are really cool with them.  A last-minute party (planned Thursday), decorations were as minimal as they come (half-inflated balloons hanging from the ceiling and a light ball)... but the music was good and the crowd felt like home.   Stayed a couple of hours and had to go home.  Would have had more fun if I knew more people down there, of course.

Musically, it's hard to generalize based on two parties, but I did notice that all the djs seemed to use long transitions in the music rather than tight beat-matching ... it kept me from really getting into a steady dance groove, and the crowd Saturday didn't dance nearly as much as I would have thought ....  but all-in-all, it was comforting to know that there's a healthy scene there.  Bought a couple of tapes from local djs at Swell... who are planning their 4th anniversary party coming up in a week or so... if anyone's going down that way, it sounds like it will be a great outdoor massive. 

Hope you all had a great weekend here, too!

Love, Leslie

We never could ascertain their motive, apart from their derogative
reference to his attire and their inference that it signified some sort of
gang affiliation on his part. After the second altercation they drove by
only once more.

i hope you are not serious. 
i hope i misunderstood something here. 
are you saying that the love i feel on e is not real? 
e doesn't induce love. it induces openness and trust, it makes us forget
that we should be aware of strangers and that's why we can love. anybody.
unconditionally. no fear! in an otherwise scary world. and i am soooo happy
that there is one place where i can be where i don't have to be afraid
because ravers take care of each other.

 so,  when i am on E and i say i love you, i mean it. and when i am sober
and i say i love you, i mean it.

 i believe that E opens the door to trust and unconditional love but that
doesn't mean that this love and happiness is worth any less or that it
disappears the moment you step out into the morning light (as some non-raver
i talked to last night suggested). 

sorry if i'm a bit touchy at the moment. i'm still a bit emotional from the
rave on saturday (and i still haven't slept much since then. tell me if i am
overreacting). it was such a good night and my boyfriend was so wonderful to
me. but if what you are saying is right, then he was only so nice to me
because he was on e????
i don't think so! i'll ask him when he get's home.

please don't look down on people who use drugs. please don't say their
feelings aren't real. drugs just amplify what you have inside of you. 

love you all and i can't wait to meet you soon.

you know, in general, i agree that E doesn't create feelings that aren't
there, it only amplifies ones that are.

but unfortunately, i have known people to say "i love you" and other very
nice things to people on E only to ignore them (or even forget who they
are) when sober.

it takes a bit of _conscientiousness_ in order to be sincere on E.  i find
that as long as i am aware of what i am saying, i don't say anything i
wouldn't agree to when sober.  but when you're high -- especially when
you're _really_ high =) -- it's all too easy to forget that you don't
always feel the way you do at that moment, and you shouldn't say anything
that might be taken as a promise of how you'll feel the next day unless
you are certain you will still feel that way.

love,

brian

I did not read into your whole email.  I stopped at the part were you said
I think that compassion gets old. You are totally misunderstanding me. I
don't want to carry on any further. If there was something in your post
relevant, I will read it later and deside wether or not I should reply. But
it looks to be a waist of time. Good day.

!!!!!!!!---Hello again---!!!!!!!
I just woke up this wonderful Monday morning with such a tale and i didn't 
know who to share it with!
And while reading every post with loving care, it came to me! who better to 
appreciate it!?!
!!!!!!!!!!!!...I had a lucid *flying* dream...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this has *never* happened before in my whole life!
(if you don't know, lucid means that while your dreaming, you know your 
dreaming, and you can plot and manipulate what happens...)
I also had happened to master the art of flight... 
So those of you who might want to attempt to do the same...
i had a green veggie salad for dinner, and munched on some licorice sticks
went to bed round 4AM and had talked to my mommy, who even while she's
thousands of miles away, can still give me happy snuggly feelings... :)
so i feel asleep happy, and woke up *EXTATIC*
the biggest problem was, i got verry dizzy, up there so high...
i might need to re-master the art of avoiding vertigo?
Okay, so i also wanted to say i love you.. :)
(give me any excuse! haha)
AND i'd like to hear some more stories about dreams!!! does anyone 
elce have lucid dreams?  usually when?
and flying dreams?
re-occuring dreams??
what is your best dream?
Thanks! and !hugs!

Just a thought-- this is my personal opinion

I think ecstacy can be very blinding to people. not that they are not
experiencing this love but say if you just had a small amount of feelings
for a person the ecstacy would amplify those feeling to a level that
wouldn't be experienced in a sober state, therefore causing a drug induced
love-- remeber it's just a thought

hey! 

i have been trying to induce lucid dreams for such a long time now, but to
no avail! i have tried so many techniques and such, but to no avail. i even
recently turned to melatonin but that doesn't seem to work for me either.
hmm.. maybe it's just me.

but normally i usually have very intricate, detailed, LONG LONG dreams.
maybe it's because i sleep about 10 hours a day, i dont know. 

like last nite, i had a dream i was at a concert, i got there, and went
inside, and it was a MADONNA concert, and it was all good, i worked my way
to the front and i was dancing around having a great time, and then the
concert ended and most people cleared out and there was a lineup up over the
stage of people who were meeting her and shaking her hand as she sat in this
big red upholstered chair. so after the cue had dissipated i asked one of
the security if i could go up and i did, and i went up to madonna and low
and behold she was not WHITE but BROWN, and she had black hair but she
looked like madonna (maybe it has somehting to do with the fact that i am
brown but who knows) so anyway i talked to her and blah blah blha.. and then
she thanked me and showed me the door to the parking lot where i had to
catch my ride.

the weirdest experience with dreams i ever had was once when i came home
from a party, i was all messed on crystal, so i took a few melatonin pills
to calm me down and put me to sleep. but before i fell asleep i called my
friend steve to say hi and catch up...but he had to go and told me he would
call me later. so i waited a bit and then fell asleep.. and i dreamt of
picking up the fone and talking to him a bit and then telling him that i was
too tired to talk. (i thought i was asleep and dreaming)... and later when i
woke up i remembered it and i thought it was so odd, and then i started
wondering if i had dreamt it or if it had been real, and i sat there for 20
minutes trying to figure it out until i decided to call him back. and HE
said that he indeed had called me back, and i had been talking normally and
everything and i told him that i had been ASLEEP at the time and we both
thought it was very weird.

so that was my weirdest experience...talking in my sleep and then dreaming
about it (:

omigosh! that's is so completely bizarre, because for the first time in a
long time i actually had a good dream, and i feel that i sort had
something to do with the story line. it was such a lovely dream filled
with all this love and everyone was being so nice to me... so much
different than the horrible nightmares i have been experiencing for oh,
say the past two months. wow, cool, just one of those things.

Sorry it's late but I'm only just beggaring to feel normal again! I just
HAD to say how much I Loved this Experience. Nothing I have ever been to
in England compares the  total friendship I received from all  new ppl I
met. Thank you to those that were there and organized it. I must say
personal thankyous to a few special people firstly Brett who gave me ride
to and from the event He even took me to a hotel with a glass lift just
after we left and the view, WOW what a beautiful city you have from 32
stories up! I will always be his friend even tho I met him 1hr before the
event. Secondly Scott who sent me a ticket - thanks and I'm glad I met
you albeit briefly. Thirdly a guy named Greg who sortEd mE Out With two
of my favorite things to swallow. Being from England and not too familiar
with capsules rather than pressed tablets I was expecting to feel happy
after an hour or so and wasn't at all. I was ( unfortunately ) thinking
that I'd been had and thus took the other one I had intended for an Event
in the future. I was  wrong.  Some time later ( time lost relevance for a
while) I remember weeping with joy and feeling that  I was going to
explode due to the sensory overload caused by the most  moving music
(upstairs) - Wish I knew who was playing. Anyway I met Mat and Smilegirl
and some of thier friends who graciously let me use their vibrating hair
brush.  I spent a LONG time brushing my hair with it!  I met a lot of
other people who must forgive me as I've forgotten their names but they
all added to the Experience and made Condensation ( my first ever SF
rave) THE Best  time of my life to date. One last person to mention Is
Dana  ( Robins room mate) who doesn't have E-mail but maybe it will
filter through to her. THANK YOU  The time I spent with her was the best
bit of the evening. 
I wish I could say things about the music and the Dj's but I Don't know
any of their names. It was all GREAT - it made me dance anyway! 
These are just some of the things that happened to me that I thought you
might like to share. sorry if I've trodden on any ones toes.
If All the raves I go to in the bay area are Like this You'll make it
very hard for me to go back to England When the time comes!
Thanks again
Love Ed xxx

i would have to say that it isn't the drug that produces these feelings,
but rather, it melts a barrier between expressing feelings which, under
normal circumstances, would be embarrasingly difficult to express. i tell
people my feelings both sober and drugged, only i don't feel quite as shy.
same with anything. ever notice how open people are when they're liquored?
in fact quite some time ago, one of my friends and i were not as close as
we were previously and one night everyone was drinking and we started
talking about our relationship and how it had deteriorated and how much we
had missed the closeness we had once shared. now everything is cool
between us, almost as if nothing had ever happened and we talked about it
the next day and agreed on how we were glad that we were faded enough to
talk about it. of cousre, some people don't always mean what they say when
they are on drugs, whether it is nice or mean, but i am only sharing with
you where i stand on this issue. if i tell  you i love you when i'm on E
i'll tell you i love you when i'm not, too.
hugs, sugarkisses, and all that other fun stuff,
***stariana***
i love y'all!
have a starry day!

Well, I used to go to those kind of clubs back in the mid eighties,
except we didn't call it grunge, we called it punk. I remember seeing
Nirvana in San Diego in 1987: I thought they were a punk band from
Seattle. I think grunge was just a marketroids (successful) repakaging
effort. Sort of like the word "technicia." Though to be perfectly honest,
grunge is a softer, gentler punk. Sort of a pop-punk.

A lot of punkers were bitter and pissed off when "frat boys" started coming
to "their" clubs and listening to "their" music. Most of the ones I know
from those days don't care too much about music anymore.

>Or has it all been

There are still punk clubs. There are still bands that play that music.
Probably about the same number as before it became popular.

Yeah, I noticed that the stuff being played on stations like live 105 got
a lot better when grunge became popular. It seems to be happnening again
(I am liking the music on the radio more), even though I don't listen to
that much techno outside of raves. It's just not "listening to" music to
me, but the pop-techno on live 105 is pleasant.

I expect the techno/rave underground will do a bit better at dealing
with commercial success than the punk/grunge crowd did, mostly because
punk is so anti-mainstream that being popular is an internal contradiction.

"He's the one
 Who likes all the pretty songs
 And he likes to sing along
 And he likes to shoot his gun
 But he don't know what it means"

PLUR won't be messed up if more people practice it. It might even all turn out
to be a good thing, sort of the rallying cry for the up and coming generation.
I ain't holding my breath, but I have hope.

Peace,
Jim

Hi there,

(Please excuse the length of this post...But, I strongly believe these 
things...)

We are finally now realizing the inevitable - the mass acceptance of 
"electronica" (techno) and mainstream america's commercialization of it. 
 There are big changes coming to us all in this regard, and what is 
important, is how we all deal with these changes.  I can only hope that good 
will come out of this change.  Granted, the corporate sponsored rave is 
going to become mainstream, and soon.  The jokes about Prodigy, Chemical 
Brothers, Underworld, Beck etc...on stage at some big stadium rave is actual 
reality in the UK.  Festivals such as Glastonberry that pull 100's of 
thousands of party goers have been going on for years...Love Parade in 
Berlin this year expects upwards of 1million partiers!!!  Now that dance 
music is entering into the main stream culture of the United States, we all 
need to seriously look at how we plan to cope.

IMO, I see that there may be a huge separation from the UG and Massive 
cultures.  (even more than exists now)  If anything, the underground will 
move even further underground...like people will band together in more and 
more exclusive rave events.  I would argue however, that this may not be the 
best way to deal with things...

The parties that we all love so much, Harmony, F&F, Gateway, Sunset, Cloud 
Factory, Warmth etc...will all be innundated with increasing numbers of new 
people to the rave scene.  Not entirely unlike the trend that bay area 
massives have taken in the last few years.  The most important thing that we 
can do with these people, is accept them for their differences (like we all 
are accepted) and show them the ways that we know.

We love raving so much because of the energy we get out of it.  The biggest 
reason that massives do not hold this same energy is because of the people 
who are there.  These people want the same things that we cherish - love and 
acceptance, they just haven't learned how to acheive these things.  We must 
show these people why we love raving so much.  We must teach them how to 
open up to others, hug them and send them love, unconditionally.

We all do these things at the smaller underground parties because we feel 
comfortable enough to do it.  We are usually surrounded by others like us, 
people on different spiritual paths, but with open mindedness enough to love 
each other, in all of our individual forms.  But, most of us fall trap to 
the fears that are within us when we choose not to send someone love when 
they are different.  It's important for all of us to apply the same rules 
that we use while with fellow ravers, to _everyone_ else that we may 
encounter, regardless of how we perceive them.

I'm not saying that if you happen to run into an angry mob that you need to 
jump in and start hugging people...use your best judgement as to what 
situations present the best opportunity to give love in that manner.  But, 
what you can do in these situations, is allow them their anger, and think 
good thoughts about their inner selves.

Change brings growth.  That growth will run in the direction of the people 
who are most closely related to it.  Tremendous changes are upon us, big 
things are going to happen in our community, it is essential that we all are 
a part of these changes and the resulting growth.  The more people that 
become open minded and full of love, the better, no matter what changes 
might occur.

Thanks for listening,

Smiles,

Scott =)

Hi there,

There are definately big changes to both the earth and the global 
consciousness.  I think a lot of people are just afraid of what might 
happen, and are busy trying to calculate our inevitable doom and when it's 
going to happen.  If that's what those people need to do, fine.  But, I 
choose to live each day the best I can, and look forward to the next.  Fill 
my life with love and positivity at every moment.  If something like the 
shifting of the poles, or a giant meteor strike on the earth happens, there 
is really nothing I can do about it is there?  Until that problem presents 
itself, I will continue on the same path I am on now, trusting that if 
something does happen, I will be the best prepared for it that I can 
possibly be.

As far as Boomerang's words go, I am with you.  I feel the same uncertainty 
about our future.  I am both scared and excited.  It's important to try and 
find light in all the darkness however, if we cannot, then we will exist in 
the reality of darkness and fear.  If we choose to find positivity and love, 
then we will exist in the reality of positivity and love.  We are all in 
this together, everything that anyone feels effects all of us, both negative 
and positive.  With luck, and persistence, our feelings of love will 
permeate those around us, and the effect will snowball creating a global 
community of love and positivity.  If this happens, then we may together 
have the strength to prevent the massive destruction that everyone seems so 
terrified about.

Just my thoughts...thanks for listening.

Smiles, (and hugs, and love, and laughter...etc...)

Scott =)

well...that comet's going to hit the earth in 2012 and about half of us
are going to die and the earth is going to shift its axis again...putting
the north pole at the equator...

...well at least that's what they say.  it's kind of fun thinking about
it, actually.  it would be like a rebirth of the planet.  the only people
that would survive would be the strong, the people who can surround
themselves in a positive energy shield.

yes, you are right. but as i said to that guy who said that the love and
happiness disappears once you leave the rave: only if you don't carry it out
into the rest of your life. 

i have longed for this feeling of unity and safety for such a long time.
i've been involved in many community and co-operative projects, always
looking for a way of living and working without hierarchical structures or
-isms, with equality and respect. and the rave scene has come closest to
this ideal.

of course this doesn't work for everyone. there will always be some bad
vibes or weird things happening at raves. and there will always be people
who can live two lives. but in general ravers still love eachother when they
are sober. didn't you ever pass someone in the street who was wearing a
jacket from your favorite rave? and didn't you smile at him/her?

love,
iris

not lucid, almost flying, but really falling: 
i spend a year in the U.S. (minneapolis) as an exchange student and it was
the biggest most important thing in my life. first time completely on my
own, i had to learn to live my life myself (instead of letting my family do
it). in the first three months i had several, what i later called,
initiation dreams. 
two of them involved falling, which is my scariest nightmare. you know, the
ones where you fall down a cliff, high building, whatever, you fall forever,
your stomach in your throat, trying to hold on to something, completely
helpless. and before you hit the ground you wake up. 
well, i went over the cliff in a bus and on a motorbike and  in both dreams
i did hit the ground - and i survived! and my family was standing at the top
of the cliff, waving to me.

love,
iris

Ahh, but the fear is : there *will* be.

I dont normally get into holy wars (esp ones about keeping out others...
would make me feel republican :-).  I just feel the need to insert the
following morsel of wisdom (presented in haiku for your reading pleasure).

Its been Seven years
First time said : "They are coming!"
Hasn't happened yet

Feel better?

who cant even get a category on the sfraves list ;-)  Try :
21 year old
old-skooler (since 90-91...?)
drug-free and completely apathetic about it
into major hardcore beats
only gripes *occasionally* about the price of agua (I mean *sheesh!* :-)
Only posts in haiku

Hi all,

Want to hear some reeeaalllllly good Irish music?  Stuff that's modern,
heavily-influenced by the techno movement, and yet still wedded to
traditional Celtic harmony?  With some of the best-written lyrics you'll
find in the post-James Joyce era ;)?  By the most-loved musical troupe on
earth today?  With accompanying decks-wizardry from Scottish DJ Howie B?

Then go get the new U2!  It's called POP and is sooooooo good... I think
anyone who's interested in seeing how techno music can overlap with
traditional 4-minute pop songs will think it's fantastic.

(sorry for the gushiness here, I'm just such a shameless fan and my
Irishness is running a bit rampant today!!!)

cheers to all,
Tim

hi scott
ben and iris here with the british rave scene review, part 3

i wrote and you sent back:
>> takes an average of 3 hours to get in, tickets cost =9C25 ($37?),

i see the pound sign came out funny on your side. maybe i should switch to
american keyboard.

you wrote:
>I had thought that raving in the UK was banned/illegal...Have things=20
>changed?=20

they had to give up a lot of freedom to be able to hold legal rave. on
saturday there was police in the compound all night. and at 7 a.m. when the
music stops you HAVE to leave. they have in the past made people line up
outside for their coats, in the middle of winter. it was -2 C. they have to
get a licence and the organization that are putting the raves on have to
register as a proper business. it may suddenly sound very commercial, but
the people are real ravers.=20
there is still a lot of illegal underground raves, travellers parties,
parties out in the sticks, and the police is still trying to make it
difficult for them. but they just can't keep up with the masses. EXODUS, a
two-weekly illegal rave has actually reduced the crime rate in the vicinity
of Luton on saturday nights (every other week, that is). there is just no
point in and no good reason for prohibiting something that people really
want - and do anyway, whether it's legal or not.

>8000 person rave?  Wow.  I know of only the biggest commercial events there=

>like Glastonbury and Universe Tribal Gathering,

glastonbury is the same thing. something like 60 % of the 65 pounds it costs
to get in these days, go to the police, that patrols the site and the
perimeter, and the corragated iron fence they erect around the whole huge
site. glastonbury festival was only allowed to continue under these=
 conditions.=20

Illbient: music critics and/or artists in a race to either create or
propogate unnecessary and pretentious neologisms.  Let it pass like wind.    

DJ Spooky: though I haven't really heard much of his work, I know that I
don't like the fact that he tries to overintellectualize electronic music.
The fact that he's been given an honorary PhD in electronic music
by the alternative rock press makes me cringe.  

A couple other overrated, criticially lionized artists/acts of 1996: DJ
Shadow, Dr.Octogan (original full-length).

This reminds me of an incident the other day... I was sitting at a
stoplight listening to my new Detroit comp with the windows rolled down.
When the light changed, the audible walk/don't walk signal started
chirping, in perfect time with the track I was listening to.  It
fit right in :)

	Interesting topic...

	I can get into lucid dreaming pretty reliably, when conditions are 
right... I do it in the morning, when I wake up before I have to get up.  I lie 
on my back, and do controlled breathing and try to get into a meditation state.  
I find that concentrating on the "phosphenes", the stuff you see when your eyes 
are closed, helps. So does counting breaths, to keep stray thoughts down. Once I 
trance out, I often fall back asleep, and then almost always dream lucidly.

	It seems to work better the cleaner I am, drug-wise.  Its hard to get 
into a good trance when I'm dopey or jittery.  Music might help (I'm too lazy at 
that hour to put any on), but once I get past the threshold of meditation my 
senses (both internal and external) become so acute that I think it would be 
distracting.  If I'm with anyone she has to be asleep (I don't recall having 
seriously tried it two-at-a-time).

	I use flying as a basic test to see if I'm dreaming.  Often, I'll 
notice I can fly before I know I'm dreaming (like, I'll be running, and I'll 
notice I don't need to put my feet down).  Sort of, "Damn, why don't I do this 
more often?  Oh, I'm dreaming, right".  Then I really go for it.  Or, 
maybe I'll just look out a window, realize I'm dreaming, and take off through 
the roof. Sometimes there are obstacles to get through, usually trees or 
telephone wires.

	My favorite thing is exploring.  I seem to have a bunch of places in my 
head -- houses, neighborhoods, towns, cities, lakes, valleys -- which don't seem 
to correspond to anything in the real world (or very roughly at best), but which 
I can visit again and again. Some great restaurants and hotels too (sometimes 
there's a party going on)...  I think that the more I learn about these places, 
the more I'll know about myself.  Creating things out of nothing is also fun, 
but they go away when I wake up.

	I've found that there seems a limit to how high I can fly.  Sometimes I 
try to get away from the planet, but it gets very difficult when the sky 
starts to go purple.  I don't think its the lack of air because breathing 
underwater isn't a problem. Maybe this is like the thing in astral projection 
where you're not able to go too far from your body.  Or maybe I just have to 
visualize my destination...   but I want a surprise.

	Of course when I first started doing it, I liked the sex best (I was 
about 15).  But it gets boring after a few years...  when I'm lucid dreaming, I 
know the other people aren't real.

was not that great of a party.  First of all the music wasn't that great,
second of all about 6-7 cars got boken into.  About 5-6 girls (that I know
of) got this E and broke out into extreme hives and were throwing up.  It did
however last until the end, unlike the last party they threw.  I will never
go to another Ubiquitous party again.  All I could say to my friends that I
went with was we should of gone to Cloud Factory, and by the sounds of that
party we should have.  Anyway have a great week people.

Yeah... I have to agree...Last month's Details magazine had a very humorous
"Guide to Techno & Jungle" and it described "Illbient" as the sound of
"self promotion"... its just a word that DJSpooky (and his publicist?)
made-up. Gosh I feel disillusioned today... apologies to any DJSpooky fans
please don't flame me as I have a headache...

just thought I'd comment a bit about the "commercialization" of techno.

someone used Europe as an example of rave style concerts and what happens.

My opinion is that techno will never be as big in the U.S. as it is in
Europe for one reason: the U.S. has too many Puritan roots and is *not* a
dance culture as a whole.  Many countries in Europe and Latin America for
example have always been more "celebratory" so to speak.  Mainstream
american culture does not have such roots.  Dancing and hedonism are
frowned upon in a Puritan model, which we as an entire culture still
exhibit.

As we all have noticed it is "bigger", but I just can't imagine techno
itself reaching the proportions it has in Europe.  The average american
tastes are not the same as the average European's in this way.  If you
notice the techno "bands" that are making it big here have a certain
"rock" sound and also vocals.  This is a bit more acceptable than music
you'd hear at a rave.


Time will tell, I suppose.   I personally am happy that more people are
dancing these days and that I am included among them!!

Anyways, just thought I'd toss that out there.  It is only my meager
opinion!!

That's Dr. Octogon, friend.  If you gonna pan the man, get the name right!

I'll happily take issue with you.  Dr. Octogon, overrated?  I don't think
so.  

Kool Keith (Dr. Octogon) has one of the freshest, newest hip-hop sounds in
quite a long while.  His lyrics are surreal, dream-like, and amazing...
his beats are dope...  Q-Bert goes OFF...  what more do you want?

I'm interested in hearing why you think he's overrated.

My girlfriend and I went to Baker Beach one Saturday morning and we spent
the whole day exploring the beach and admiring the fantastic view. I've done
E too many times to count (or remember :p) usually at the club or party or
something, but this was one of the best. It gave me a real chance to enjoy
the drug without any distractions (music, people, etc).
There was another time that involved 2 freaky girls and myself in a shower,
but thats another story!

I'm still on Cloud Ten following this weekend's condensation!!  This was 
my first fantastic rave in quite a while... I used to rave all the time 
back in 93-94, and even though then I was going out a lot, raves on a par 
with Cloud Factory were still rare.  It's so wonderful to see that the 
scene is alive and thriving still!  It brought back so much... and I'm 
hooked once again!
  Hello to Ed, who I met through the list and had a great time with at 
the party and afterwards...  april, sorry I didn't get to meet you this 
time, but I'm sure there'll be others!  What's up to matt from fairfield!
  Some comments on the party:  Fabulous space, phenomenal music, high 
energy, a vibe that was truly palpable, friendly smiles everywhere!!  
And, being a non-tobacco smoker I really appreciated the non-smoking 
policy, which I've never seen at a rave before.  Free fruit and water was 
obviously great, and Travis and I had fun cutting it up for a while!
  Thanks to Cloud Factory for putting on such a plurfect event, and to 
all who attended for adding to it!  I felt incredibly welcome and at home 
even though I've been away for a long time!

love,

brett

P.S.  I'd love to meet any sfravers who live in the Santa Cruz area and 
possibly connect for future sf raves...  I have a car and would gladly 
give rides to anyone down here or on my way.  :-)

My best has yet to come.
        There is this amazing girl, she's full of thought and her life is
locked inside her unable to be released. A week in a half ago, she was raped
by a man who was trusted.
I've known her for a while, yet our first real conversation took place this
weekend. It's obvious that she is a very mis-understood person. I seem to be
the only one who understands. I felt a bond with this girl and our
conversations have changed me. I felt her pain, built up inside her, and I
heard how people thought of her. Both her and I know that we have something
the other needs. . . I feel that I can help her out greatly. The words we
spoke, and the words we didn't were completely understood by only us. I feel
that something will happen if she isn't released, and I feel that I can be
the one to save her soul.
        She is an extremely spiritual and psychic person. I've never had a
person understand me so well in my life. . . and most of our communication
was without word.

        I have to speak to her. . . 

        We can help each other more than we know, I actually feel as if
she's with me right now. . .

Strange world of ours. . . but two of us have it figured out. . . almost. . . 


SMILE:)

You're the one who stating that compassion gets old. Not I my friend.
ANyone that read your e-mail would back up what I have to say. You stated
that my compasion for the dead women is unsincere and bs. Maybe to you're
an uncinere person but not I. What does PLUR mean to you anyway?

I could really care less whether you'd reply to my post. You make me
laugh. Eveyone that knows me knows I'm sincere....

This monday night was nice. St. Patties is nice when you're of age to
drink. Enjoy some nice wine good brew with friends. Listen to some good
jungle beats. Spring Heel Jack is sweeeeeet.

Goodnight peoples.

both of these comments make me wonder about our music being so
mechanistic
that we are now resonating with the artificial sounds of machines and
this
concrete jungle that we have created. So much that we are becoming
part of the machine. It is important to remember to also listen to
the beat of nature...the pulse of the earth and the whisper of the 
wind and stars...so that we dont forget who we truely are.

I think not. Remember in the late '70s at the height of disco, every artist,
no matter what genre, felt it was necessary to release a disco record or be
left in the dust? And remember the crap that was released as a result? Then
remember the crass commercialization that was found at the end of disco (think
Disco Duck)?

Well, U2's POP is a repeat of that situation. Except it's not disco this time,
it's techno.

Aryck,

I feel you man. I say go for it! Do whatever it takes. Life is too short.
I just met someone I really care for and I'm doing everything to show her
waht she means to me.. (everything). It's so hard to find someone special
these days. Life is too short. Do everyting, do anything. You deserve
eachother. Get her a card and write down exacly what you feel for her on
the inside. She'll love you for it. 

I'm exactly where you're at. Isn't it awesome? Finding that special person
is the best thing. Life is meant for love and spending time with poeple
who you care about and care about you. DO whatever man, it's worth it!

-Byroni

Ps. Write her a poem too.

he was having the time of his life..Much thanks to Space children for
this free party..it was great!...the moon..was a blast..although i
sensed a lot of negativity..when i got there...people pushing...giving
hard looks.. lots of people taking advantage of E'ers..ahhhh..that
hurts!..but around three..evrything started looking alright.....the true
ravers came out and totally vibed the whole party!! :)...saw so many
people I havent seen in ages..it was  a blast to just run up to them and
give them a hug...party ran out of water for four hours..so that
sucked...but a friend  and i found a bucket of water by the water
stand..which was eventually flocked  by water thirsty people!...thanks
again to all the wonderful people who made this night so amazing!...what
made my night was seeing my friend enjoy her first party..it just gave
me goosebumps to see her hug,,,and smile at everyone!...well..overall i

Hello,

This being my first post to the list, please allow me to introduce myself!
My name is Gus, and I've been involved with the scene here in SF since
about '90... My first parties were Toon Town and Sunny Side Up, way back
when... I was so inspired by the scene that I started IF clothing in '91,
Realtime Clothing in '93, designed most of Journees stuff for the wonderful
Eric Lee, designed way too many flyers as Mindmeld, and played ambient
rooms as Team 2000 until '94...

Whew!

Since '94, I have been putting together a record label (Proto Records), a
studio (the Protolab), producing several artists, and writing music... and
now, we are very close to releasing a compilation CD of exceptional music
by the SF Bay Area's best undiscovered talent.

Some of you may have seen me and some of my cohorts play as Protolab at
Warmth.  We were totally amazed by the possitive response! Thanks to all of
you that wrote us with your support!  It meant a lot to all of us to be
received so well, inspite of all the technical difficulties we had...
We're working hard to make our next show better, and more enjoyable... if
you like our particular flavor of d&b! ;)

(BSP) Protolab is playing at the Harmony party on April 5th.

Bleep! Blonk! Bloop!

Forget natural sounds... Who we are is who we make ourselves! Technology is
now and will always be an integral part of the human race... there is no
going back.  The challenge as an electronic musician is to create sounds
that are as organic and emotive as what exists in nature, but completely
artificial!  Unfortunately, not everyone who writes electronic music
realizes this. Listen to nature for inspiration, but keep in mind the best
music comes purely from the human mind, is given meaning by the human soul,
gives rhythm to the human body, and recorded with 18-bit digital hard-disk
systems... ;)

Take care!

- Gus

More and more mainstream artists are jumping on the Techno bandwagon...
David Bowie, NIN,
Eric Clapton (yes! really!), and now U2...

IMHO, U2 lost it when Rattle and Hum came out... Bowie should have called
it quits after Let's Dance, Trent should cheer up, and Clapton should stick
to playing guitar. :)

Prepare yourselves for an onslaught of terrible "Electronica", most likely
with horrible vocals thrown on top, unlike anything you've ever seen...

Take care!

Hi all!  ]=)

 Well I'm back from my (un-hum!) "vacation". I'll be performing live in the 
ambient room at the LightSeed party "Comet" on March 28th. This is a 
benefit (from what I've been told) for the Headwaters project.

 This will be in the San Francisco Bay area. Not only will I be 
performing but also involved in the room design.

 This should be lots of fun! This will be the first chance I've had to 
work with the LightSeed production team and I'm really looking foward to 
it! 

 Any folks who have worked with me before and would like to again should 
get in contact with me.

peas and hominy,

Hi again!  ]=)

 "Believe" was a UCSC student club production. The club name is 
raV-O-Lution (I think that's right). In any case we could only go to 1:00 
AM or so because of school policies.  :(

 The party was fun though. It was especially nice to see so many SFravers 
there (hi Mike, Terry, Jen, etc.) and it was really nice to see some of 
the Harmony posse out there (hi Matt, Alex, etc.).

 We managed to get a decent sound system which was nice, but decorations 
were minimal due to a two hour set up time (dictated by UCSC).
 
 Siphon was pumping out some wicked jungle! His mixing was clean and 
smooth. :)

 MC 2 (Matt) was playing more trance/techno stuff which I found easier to 
dance to (too tired for jungle!).

 I napped for most of the rest (Sorry Joe!).

 As some artists have mentioned the process of producing art is sometimes 
more interesting than the art itself. In this case dealing with the UC 
system has been very, uhhhh, enlightening.

 Major hugz and thanks to those who helped out!! Big hugz also to the 
Madame and Liquid 7 for the love and support.

smiles,

Even though Ron D. Core is gunna be here, I heard that M6 was going to be at
the Marina Skate arena (same as Ubiquitous,+bunches of others). If I was
going to be in town this weekend, I would definitely hit Bass Heaven (if
anyone can get the info numbers!) Doc martina and Dan is enough for me....

>	i cant even think about Saturday yet! Where's everyone going?!

Simple Pleasures is where I would be....some others look ok, but its hard to
predict the quality of the music of DJ's I've never heard of. Who knows...I
guess I'll find out monday ;)

Hope everyone has fun wherever they end up :)

 i hope you are not serious. 
 i hope i misunderstood something here. 
 are you saying that the love i feel on e is not real? 
 e doesn't induce love. it induces openness and trust, it makes us forget
 that we should be aware of strangers and that's why we can love. anybody.
 unconditionally. no fear! in an otherwise scary world. and i am soooo happy
 that there is one place where i can be where i don't have to be afraid
 because ravers take care of each other.
 
  so,  when i am on E and i say i love you, i mean it. and when i am sober
 and i say i love you, i mean it.
 
  i believe that E opens the door to trust and unconditional love but that
 doesn't mean that this love and happiness is worth any less or that it
 disappears the moment you step out into the morning light (as some non-raver
 i talked to last night suggested). 
 
 sorry if i'm a bit touchy at the moment. i'm still a bit emotional from the
 rave on saturday (and i still haven't slept much since then. tell me if i am
 overreacting). it was such a good night and my boyfriend was so wonderful to
 me. but if what you are saying is right, then he was only so nice to me
 because he was on e????
 i don't think so! i'll ask him when he get's home.
 
 please don't look down on people who use drugs. please don't say their
 feelings aren't real. drugs just amplify what you have inside of you. 
 
 love you all and i can't wait to meet you soon.

Okay...
A) i am NOT looking down on you
B) when i did e, half of the people i met i do not remember to this day...
they say, "i met you here and you hugged me and said you loved me." sorry,
but i don't remember.
C) when you are on e, your feelings for those you already know and love
INTENSIFY and that is a very positive thing.
D) I have met people on e who say they love me, but then in an hour do not
remember me until i remind them for about 10 minutes.
E) drugs can be used as a doorway, but do not let them be a pathway. The path
leads you nowhere.  a very wise man said "choose you own idols, but blaze
your own path" (jake phelps, thrasher magazine) 
F) the BOND you form with someone on e lasts forever. and if you honesly LOVE
that person, the love does lasts forever.
G) I do not do e because the door was swung wide open for me.  I am following
MY OWN PATH to exstacy, nirvana, heightened sense of love and beauty combined
to one. without the aid of drugs (does pot count?) My experience with e has
changed me and helped me become more OPEN and FREE to LOVE. But it is a path
I now choose to blaze without the help of chemical induced behavior. 
H) E has HELPED me LEARN to love. 

Simply~~~> I do not need e to feel that euphoric feeling of *love* and
*beauty* that all comes to me naturally now.  When I say "drug induced" i
mean chemically euphoric.  what ever path you take is your own.  when the
door opens, step through and discover that other person in there.  you might
have more fun with him/her than you realize:)

hope this clears up any confusion.
it wasn't softend with <3's cuz I'm tired, just to the point.
please do not flame me.
it is mearly my feelings.
if you want to comment privatly, i would appreciate it more than have the
list have to bear through everything.

and i do NOT look down on those of you who do e. You know I love you when i
rub yer back for half an hour cuz i want you out of your e hole, or i get yer
arms with my crazy magic, or i give you candy cnady candy.
I care, and that is why I am here

i completely agree. drugs have been used as a doorway throughout human
history in spiritual rituals and in social contexts to create bonds and
trust and as a means to understanding and enlightenment. but too much is bad
for your body and your head. nobody likes addicts and they have usually
fucked up lives. it's a vicious circle. i generally don't do drugs when i'm
in a depressed state or dealing with some shit at the time (like jelousy or
lack of self-confidence) because, as i said, it would just amplify these
feelings. and the thought of a bad trip really scares me. i think that's why
raves are relatively violence free. people on e just can't cope with
weirdness or violence. i only take e very occassionally but i do enjoy it. i
love bonding with people at any time, but i also love it when i'm on e.

again, i agree. i'm just worried that people within the scene who have
stopped using drugs for whatever reason will develop this patronizing
attitude toward people who still do. i'm not saying that's what you're
doing, i just always worry about something good like the unity of the rave
scene falling apart again because there's two groups developing (drugged and
sober, SF and LA, techno and jungle, black and white, old ravers and joung
ravers,...) let's just all stay one family, please.

>please do not flame me.
>it is mearly my feelings.

sorry, it was not my intension to be horrid to anyone. in fact, i agree with
everything all of you said. i guess i was overreacting after all and i was a
bit emotional last night. but now i finally had a good night's sleep and i
didn't have to go to work today.

this time difference is annoying me a bit. by the time you get going over
there at night, it's approaching morning here in the UK. no wonder i'm not
getting enough sleep. i'll shut up now. love you all.

have a wonderful day

Well..."A" free glowstick (singular) anyway :)
Yes! It's true!!  Just go to http://www.omniglow.com/omniglow and find the
form to fill out for a free glowstick mailed to your home.  The one they
sent me is white, but it lasts for 24 hours!!!  Also, they sent me a lil
comic book on why everyone shold keep a stash of glowsticks around, and a
catalog of all their products.  Since they are based in Novato, I wonder if
you can purchase them from the company at the Novato address...has anyone
on this list been there??
Love and glitter,
Glitterboy Thomas

No way man--U2's been releasing remixes of their songs since 1981; they've
always been fans of dance music.  It's just always been more of a
house/gospel vibe with them, now they're getting into trance/trip-hop
rhythms.  
I agree that a lot of bands are bandwagon bands, but these guys deserve
some respect--they're the only ones who seem to be interested in
understanding just how much a part of rock n' roll techno really is.

Yes!  This was a cool party for only going till 1am.  I had to leave around
12:30, but the music was good and the space was cool.  Thanks Merc and
liquid for having me spin my junglism and sharing my style with so many
people that didn't really know what I was playing. =)

Thnaks Randy for the review.  Nice lights!!!!!!! =)

Till next time...you all take care, and I'll be happy to play at any of
your events.  I promise to bring breaks this time! ;)

Hey Goolz...

I think this is going to be great. They are the same people who put on
Samhain and the visuals sound great. I think they are the Irish
folks...Also the venue - Mission Rock is funky with its wierdo-but-fun
atmosphere and location (right in the heart of the docks and wharves
surrounded by big ships) - I went to a party here once where they projected
the visuals onto the hulls of the ships - pretty cool. ALSO the Moontribe
folks will be there and they are something to behold (or to be-hear?)....

 = that is all...Meri

Oh, I've totally been to Mission Rock before, many times; it's a great
venue. Long as it's not rainin'!  I'm pretty sure I was at the show you
were at; great laser show on ship hulls, bouncing schwas, yah?  That was a
fun one. 

X-Radio rocks, too, so if they're associated with it...

If anyone finds out how much it is, please post.

Reminds me of when I spent President's Day weekend in Vancouver... having
dinner at a place called Subeez with jungle, drum 'n bass playing loudly
in the background... there were more than a few places like that up
there...

I think of it as remaking faceless, frightening technology into something 
tribal, passionate, real.  Redefining inhuman sounds to resonate with the 
deepest parts of our human souls.  Mechanistic bleeps are no longer the 
sound of alienation; they bring us to communalism and return us to a 
distant memory - the ecstatic dance to repetitive rhythm that humans have 
done since the beginning of time.

We (Consciouness Lab) played at the Samhain party they did in Yosemite.
I've also hung out with a couple of the promotors at the last St. Johns
Rhythm Society party.  From my experience/perspective, they are really good
people and thier hearts are in the right place.  I think it will be a good
party.

If any of you have: 

1) any interest in the current legislative status of GHB
 
2) have any interest in learning more about GHB, it's history, legitimate
uses, and about all the BS that is being passed around about it (and where
most of the rumours started)

3) a web browser

While perusing the MTV site for Beavis & Butthead video clips
(huhuhuh... huh... he said "butt"), I came across a review for Orb's
latest album, "Orblivion".  The review starts out with:

"Ah, sweet orblivion.  With electronica hitting stride and finally
finding its way onto the airwaves (and video screens) of America, the
timing for a brand new Orb album could not have been better..."

"Electronica"?  Huh?  I thought you guys were kidding.  What a marketing
label that is.  Yeesh...

Hey, listen up all! 
I've just been informed of a party now in the works that is being put on in 
order to further the status of women in the technical aspects of our scene.  
We are talking about a party put on entirely by women for the entire rave 
community (yes guys, that means us too!).  This is a group of strong women 
coming together to put something out there for the scene that they love.  When 
the time comes, everyone come on out and support your sisters!

Sorry people, but I have a small bone to pick.  Please hear me out.  This is 
my $.02 worth, and I want each of you to read the entire message before 
flaming. 
 
I'm truly tired of hearing the complaints about the 'pop' musicians, and 
'commercial' groups 'stealing' 'our' music. (I apologize for the quotes.  
There was a lot to emphasize.)  It seems that some of us don't appreciate 
vocals being put to dance tracks.  I, for one, am happy to see groups like U2 
finding a new sound.  I am happy to hear David Bowie putting his classic-style 
vocals over a heavy beat.  As their music becomes accepted by society as a 
whole (due to their standing as famous musicians), then 'our' music becomes 
more acceptable.  Our events become more acceptable.   
 
People say that we will lose our family.  Our family is here because we choose 
to create it.  Our scene is what it is because we make it that way.  As long 
as there are people who love this music, and love the people who love this 
music, then SFRaves will never die.  If you want small parties with a warm 
vibe and friendly people, then throw a small party with a friendly atmosphere, 
and the right people will arrive.  As our music becomes more mainstream, so 
does our attitude.  We have by no means found all of our friends who would be 
ready and willing to rave.  We have newcomers every day.  And one thing that 
we know is, you're never too old to rave.  Don't get angry with the younger 
ones who have yet to experience much of the world.  There is a lot for them to 
learn that many of us have seen, but they must still see it for themselves.  
Each and every one of us has a responsibility, if we care about our culture as 
much as we appear, to put a little time and effort into making this scene what 
we would like it to be... 
 
Thank you. 
 
Regards, 
 
Lucas Ritting

  I think that the problem that results from the genre becoming 
mainstream is stagnation.  I seriously doubt that the radical evolution 
of electronic music that has occured will continue once it is completely 
mainstream.
  Why?  Look at evolution in general, it doesn't happen with massive 
groups, it happens in small isolated groups primarily.  Secondly, look at 
alternative and punk.  It wasn't that long ago, they were fucked up by 
over commercialization.
  When you have labels coming in, offering big contracts (ie, Virgin) 
this should be setting off some metal alarms.  Why are labels giving up 
on rap and alternative?  because of what they did to them.  U2, is a 
slave to its label, as indicated by the Negativland lawsuit.  Are these 
the labels that you want owning electronic music rights?  For instance, 
will you still be able to buy mix tapes?
  There are clearly some problems that are in store for electronic music 
in the coming years.

There is no theft at all... but, when you take the inspiration out of
music, and replace it with what the latest
opinion polls say will sell the most... well, the result may be competent,
well-produced, and melodic - but they'll still be crap.

Good, timeless music comes from honest expression of an artist's vision...
The more dilute with marketing it becomes, the less likely
it is to be good...

>It seems that some of us don't appreciate vocals being put to dance tracks.

Vocals force a certain interpretation of the music upon you... I'd much
rather take the energy of the music and apply it
within my own mental framework.  The human voice is a beautiful instrument,
and it does have a place in dance music,
but when you change the focus from the music to the lyrics, something is
deffinitely lost...

The reason large record companies have been unable to exploit electronic
music is that there are no singers to package and sell!
When you have a singer, you can build an entire marketing angle around
them... you can exploit their drug-addictions, you can sell their
sweaty underwear, you make money on what they look like... the music
becomes secondary.  There are some fantastic studio
musicians who will never be recognized, even though you listen to their
music every day... some skinny, strung-out idiot who can't
sing in key gets all the recognition (and money) because he looks good on
stage... I won't give any examples 'cuz I'm nice... :)

It was a new sound in 1988.  Picture Mr. Bigshot, head of marketing at Big
Records in a meeting...

"oh shit, band X's music isn't selling anymore... I guess this grunge thing
is dying out! What other genres are left unexploited?
Hmmm... there's Heavy Metal... whoops, no we did that in the late 80's...
hmmm, how about this Techno stuff?"

>Each and every one of us has a responsibility, if we care about our culture as

Don't settle for mediocrity!  Fight while you can to keep the music and the
scene true to its roots!
Just because a big-name mainstream artist lends his/her name to a new
marketing campaign doesn't mean that it's cool...

I still listen to 'War' and enjoy it... But Zooropa bugs the f*ck out of me...

'Scary Monsters' is a good album, but can you honestly listen to
'Earthling' and say "hey, that is really original!".

I couldn't.

Blah blah... I'll get off this here soapbox...

Regards,

- G

 A rave, for me, has always been an enviroment where artists can get 
together and create a new social enviroment. Not just the DJ's, or the 
visuals people or the props people or even the live acts. But, ideally, 
everyone is applying their creative powers to make the event unique, 
special, meaningful and inspiring.

 Exploring the edge of social gatherings has always been what raving is 
about for me.

I feel that regardless of the 'mainstreamness' (to coin a term) of any music, 
the evolution continues underneath the surface in a counter-current to the 
popular styles.  Look at rock n' roll.  It began as a not-so-humble cousin of 
the blues.  We trace the roots of most of our current styles of music back to 
the blues.  Where do we trace the blues to?  The blues comes from an 
amalgamation of European classical scales and African styles and rythms.  Punk 
evolved from rock, and alternative evolved from punk.  Does this mean that I 
can't hear blues when I want to?  Blues is played constantly.  Jazz styles 
have evolved for many years, and continue to evolve at an incredible pace.  
And why?  Because there are people who love the music, and love the people who 
love the music.  We can be just the same.  The punk scene, although 
commercialized, never gained the support of the populace as acceptable.  The 
image of violence and outrageous behavior saw to that.  Whether our scene 
follows the same fate depends entirely upon us.  Our image of drugs and 
outrageous behavior (recognize the public's perspective here) could cause 
this.  The image that the mainstreaming of our culture portrays will determine 
this.  Our scene is still young regardless of how we see it.  The media sees 
it as this 'new craze'  and so it will be considered by the populace.  The 
important thing here is to recognize that we control our fate here.  If we 
decide that the scene will remain, we can make it so.

  I think that the problem that results from the genre becoming 
mainstream is stagnation.  I seriously doubt that the radical evolution 
of electronic music that has occured will continue once it is completely 
mainstream.
  Why?  Look at evolution in general, it doesn't happen with massive 
groups, it happens in small isolated groups primarily.  Secondly, look at 
alternative and punk.  It wasn't that long ago, they were fucked up by 
over commercialization.
  When you have labels coming in, offering big contracts (ie, Virgin) 
this should be setting off some metal alarms.  Why are labels giving up 
on rap and alternative?  because of what they did to them.  U2, is a 
slave to its label, as indicated by the Negativland lawsuit.  Are these 
the labels that you want owning electronic music rights?  For instance, 
will you still be able to buy mix tapes?
  There are clearly some problems that are in store for electronic music 
in the coming years.

How much do you love raving?
A handbook for responsible raving


The Goodvibe Starts from Within

Stop complaining
about everyone else. What about yourself?
Are you treating others
the way you want to be treated?
That is the only route toward the
positivity that will unite us all.
Don't be afraid!
Fear is the source of all our conflicts and
aggressions.
The next time someone gives you a hard look,
understand that they are still captive
to their fears like you once were.
Don't resort to a negative response because that
will only create more negativity.
Smile! Let the goodwill within you flow!
Maybe your strength and love will give them
the courage to open themselves,
and they will follow the new direction.
It is all up to you...

*IGNORANCE IS OVERCOME THROUGH COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION*

Ignorance is the easiest problem to overcome but it also depends on
individual efforts.. All we need to do is educate ourselves. But two
things must happen before we can educate each other.

First, we must be willing to be educated... we must recognized that we are
being stupid and want to change.

And secondly, we must communicate with each other.

Since we have no organized arena for ravers to come together and
communicate we are held in the dark. We must find a centralized forum
where together we can learn from our past mistakes and innovate our future.
Until we find that forum, it is up to you to discuss these problems and
re-shape our future.

The existence of rave culture depends entirely on you to simply talk with
one another... to share all of these important issues with others... with
people you meet for the first time.

Know what you're talking about-
Rumors and misinformation are splitting us apart. Know the facts about the
realreasons for "busts"... or the dangers of certain substances. Don't let
yourself be used as a tool for a promoters personal gain... or mouthpiece
for fabricated drug hysteria.

Know what you're taking-
We've already discussed unscrupulous drug dealers. Don't combine lots of
different drugs! There are combinations of substances that can quickly
become lethal. In fact, more drug related casualties are due to lethal
combinations of drugs and alcohol than overdosing!

Let the DJ do the mixing!

Know your limit-
Your accountability group can help you with this. Be careful trying to
"bump" your dosage. Always let someone know exactly how much of what your
taking BEFORE you take it.

Know the law-
Get to know the specific legalities of possessing controlled substances.
Know the consequences if you're busted and ask yourself if it is worth the
risk.

Know how to handle yourself with the police-
Be cooperative but also know your rights regarding search and seizure laws
(especially in searching a vehicle). Avoid dragging down the rave scene
with you. Don't even mention
raves if you have a run in with officers. Be afraid of the seriousness of
the consequences but don't let yourself be intimidated to the point that
you incriminate yourself.

Know what to do in case of an emergency-
This is a very important area if we wish to police ourselves at raves.

In case of an overdose or other drug related medical trauma
follow these steps before calling an ambulance.

1)Move the victim to a safe, private and discrete area away
from the noise and everyone else.

2)Find out EVERYTHING that they took... including
dosage, combinations and alcohol.

3)Find the victims friends.

4)Don't panic. Some drug related trauma can be relieved
simply through sleeping it off.

5)Find someone trustworthy and knowledgeable about those
substances and get their advice. (Like Medi-Rave!)

6)Do NOT administer CPR, induce vomiting, or other
first aid proceedures unless fully capable and qualified.

7)In the desert or in a hot venue, dehydration
could be the problem, so try drinking some water.

8)If necessary ask security to call for help or ambulance.

Know your promoters-
It's time that ravers determine how much an event is worth.
If you think you're getting ripped off or if a promoter is
constantly being busted... STOP SUPPORTING THOSE EVENTS!!! Try to remember
that promoter's other events. Think about what the promoter promised for
those raves...

Bust-free? (which might not really possible anymore)
Carnival rides/visuals/multiple areas?
Free water/gifts/etc.?
Big name Djs/bands?

So what do you and your accountability group do if you're
not getting your money's worth? All of you should:

-find and tell the promoter that you're not satisfied
-leave a message(s) on the voice mail
-don't go to that promoter''s events again
-write letters to local music magazines
-post to the internet rave related mail groups
-throw your own event... large or small!!!

Remember that many promoters throw raves for a living and
that they must make money. We're not asking promoters to
lose money! We're thankful that they go through all the
hassle to even HAVE an event to go to. However, we ARE
asking promoters to re-invest into the scene.... after all... if
the scene doesn't survive, the promoters don't survive either.

Support promoters that are helping our movement flourish...
that are innovating with creative ideas...that deliver what they
promise... that re-invest in the scene... that respect ravers,
DJs, venues, officers, public opinion and Mother Earth!

*CARELESSNESS IS OVERCOME THROUGH ACCOUNTABILITY*

Carelessness, which sometimes is accidental, can easily be
overcome through a system of accountability. It only takes
two friends to commit to be accountable to each other in
reminding the other if they are being careless. The more
people you have in your accountability group (also called
"true friends"), the less likely you are to do something
careless. Create an acountability group with the
friends you rave with the most. Ask
someone to be accountable for you RIGHT
NOW!!!!

All you have to do is give a simple reminder.... speak up and
say, "I don't think it's such a good idea for you to do that."
Here are some places where carelessness becomes a problem
for each of us in the rave movement:

Forgetting about any of the above selfishness issues-
Go ahead... re-read them!

Driving safely-
There is nothing wrong with being too messed up or too tired
to drive home... unless of course you try to drive anyway.
Ask a more sober friend from your accountability group to
drive or wait until someone is able to drive. Coffee and other
stimulants won''t do the trick.. Take your time so you
and your friends can rave again another day!

Dealing with the wrong people-
Who are the wrong people? Unscrupulous drug dealers are just as problematic
as
undercover drug enforcement agents. If you think getting something "bunk"
is a problem.... think about how bad it would be if you bought something
poisonous or lethal! This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem as drug
manufacturers are finding cheaper ways to make money. Most of them aren't
chemists and don't bother testing their new batch... you may become a "test
subject" for an unknown substance. The media and law enforcement agencies
are infiltrating our masses to collect information to use against us at a
later time. You can never know who is who... so be careful. Know who
you're dealing with.

Loitering outside of the venue-
This only draws attention to the event and makes police curious enough to
"investigate." Loitering also makes it more difficult to patrol a parking
area to look for people breaking into cars or doing other selfish
activities that hurt individual ravers and hurt the scene overall. When
you're walking through a parking lot and you see people standing around ask
them to please go inside... but explain to them why it is important for
them to help in this regard.

Acting safely/Acting responsibly-
This is a broad area that has too many specific "infractions." Every once
in a while just ask yourself (and the people you''re accountable for) these
questions...

What am I doing?
Am I directly/indirectly harming myself or other ravers?
Am I keeping someone else from having a great time?
Am I helping build a positive public image about the rave scene?

Hey everyone.

King Kong last week was showcasing some pretty deft music, great 
scratching, tight djing... I think the scene is really lucky to have 
people putting on events like this, so let's get some more sfravers out 
there shaking their jungle booty.

ps. having said that, I have to excuse myself this week: I've got a final

Today Lucas posted some words of truth (copied below for those who
filter out "NRR" stuff... because it's totally rave related to me)...

Nail on the head.  I know it's frustrating when you think that your
secret world is being revealed to the rest of the world... we hear the
complaints because "they" are stealing our music, popularizing it,
using it on their ... TV shows!   ...   I accidentally saw "Amp" on MTV
last week, and was so happy that there was actually music on TV
that I wanted to hear... but a friend said "oh no, that's awful... MTV??"

I don't get this kind of paranoia.  

How does popularity diminish your love of the music? Don't you love
it because it makes you happy, makes you dance?  How does it 
affect you if someone else loves it too?  Even if it's in a McDonald's 
ad (which, of course, isn't really gonna play the weirder stuff that
we start craving the deeper we get into anything). 

Is Mozart's music any less because people around the world from
all walks of life love Mozart?  Of course not.  And, when the Mozart
imitators try to follow that lead, doesn't that still bring up the general
level of music by setting such a strong example?

The happiness that our music and our scene bring is worth spreading around.
Being one of the first in any scene only gives you tenure, not ownership. 

If part of your identification with the rave scene is because of some 
feelings of a "secret club" that "we've" got better taste, "we're" more 
"cool" than the rest of the world, think about your real motivations
and if there might be a little bit of ego talking there.

Sure, things get diluted when they get mainstream... but that's the way
the world is.  Things change, they evolve, and they get modified again.

Change is good.  Like us, our music is changing all the time, and will continue
to change.  There will always be new territory, and as it gets discovered by
the pioneers, others will follow in their footsteps.  And when it starts
to feel a little crowded, then the pioneers find new territory again.  That's
just how life works.  There are pioneers, there are leaders, and there are
followers.  Pioneers never about the followers, they're too busy forging
ahead.

Our underground is about more than just the music ... it's about personal 
relationships ... it's about a place where people of like minds and spirits
(and musical tastes) come together.  We can keep our underground and still
share our music. Lucas is right... we can still be our little family dancing
on the beach, and experience all the we love about the scene ....  even when
they're playing jungle at Taco Bell.   

The music doesn't define us, we define the music.  I'd like to think we could 
even be a family without the music if we have to.

Much love, Leslie

Here's what Lucas Ritting wrote...

Sorry people, but I have a small bone to pick.  Please hear me out.  This is 
my $.02 worth, and I want each of you to read the entire message before 
flaming. 
 
I'm truly tired of hearing the complaints about the 'pop' musicians, and 
'commercial' groups 'stealing' 'our' music. (I apologize for the quotes.  
There was a lot to emphasize.)  It seems that some of us don't appreciate 
vocals being put to dance tracks.  I, for one, am happy to see groups like U2 
finding a new sound.  I am happy to hear David Bowie putting his classic-style 
vocals over a heavy beat.  As their music becomes accepted by society as a 
whole (due to their standing as famous musicians), then 'our' music becomes 
more acceptable.  Our events become more acceptable.   
 
People say that we will lose our family.  Our family is here because we choose 
to create it.  Our scene is what it is because we make it that way.  As long 
as there are people who love this music, and love the people who love this 
music, then SFRaves will never die.  If you want small parties with a warm 
vibe and friendly people, then throw a small party with a friendly atmosphere, 
and the right people will arrive.  As our music becomes more mainstream, so 
does our attitude.  We have by no means found all of our friends who would be 
ready and willing to rave.  We have newcomers every day.  And one thing that 
we know is, you're never too old to rave.  Don't get angry with the younger 
ones who have yet to experience much of the world.  There is a lot for them to 
learn that many of us have seen, but they must still see it for themselves.  
Each and every one of us has a responsibility, if we care about our culture as 
much as we appear, to put a little time and effort into making this scene what 
we would like it to be...

isn't this amazing.  there are at least 3 events going on every weekend
worth checking out.  years ago we didn't have this.  well, maybe some of
you old ravers will disagree.  some always do.  but it's fun to think
about where our SFR scene will be 5 years from now if we keep doin what
we're doin...

Bon Appetit!  :>

This is the best definition (academic) I can come up with, hope it's o.k.
Through the use of drugs and music a rave creates an atmosphere which is
simultaneously trible and futuristic.  This thriving mass of humans seem
to function as a single metaorganism bent on transgressing societal norms
simply by not participating in the mainstream.  i.e. temporary utopia
followed by the expectation of a utopia (the next rave).

How much do you love raving?
A handbook for responsible raving


The Goodvibe Starts from Within

Stop complaining
about everyone else. What about yourself?
Are you treating others
the way you want to be treated?
That is the only route toward the
positivity that will unite us all.
Don't be afraid!
Fear is the source of all our conflicts and
aggressions.
The next time someone gives you a hard look,
understand that they are still captive
to their fears like you once were.
Don't resort to a negative response because that
will only create more negativity.
Smile! Let the goodwill within you flow!
Maybe your strength and love will give them
the courage to open themselves,
and they will follow the new direction.
It is all up to you...
-tito


part 2

This booklet is not intended to be definitive in its' approach...
it is a starting point for communication about very important
issues that directly affect each of us.

Our hope is that it will encourage you to step away
from the music with some friends for a moment so
that you can discuss the importance of individual
efforts in responsible raving.

Yeah? So what's the problem?

It is becoming more and more difficult to continue our cultural
phenomenon known as the "Rave Movement." The reason
that raving is more difficult is because raves and even smaller
parties are being shut down by the police and other authorities
at an alarming rate. Apart from DJs, sound and lights, in
order to throw a successful event you need secure locations,
permits/permission and insurance. With any of these
ingredients missing there is a strong chance that the event will
not get off the ground.

In order to get these ingredients we must go to people outside
of the rave community... the public.

It is the public that formulates opinions about us as ravers.
Most times it is public opinion that keeps a landowner from
granting us on his property... that keeps an insurance
company from providing a necessary policy... that keeps civil
agencies from issuing a permit that makes an event legal and
"unbustable."

The police are not shutting us down because of a giant
conspiracy against ravers, raving and living life to its'
fullest...

They are shutting us down because of our own...

selfishness
carelessness
&
ignorance

If we rid ourselves of these anchors, our public image will
greatly improve and our fragile movement will surely
flourish.

How? What can you do? A lot!

YOU can make or break our movement!


part 3



It is incredibly easy to combat selfishness,
carelessness and ignorance and still have the time
of your life... maybe even have a better time than you've
ever experienced. Imagine having the best time you've ever
had at a rave... now couple that with the feeling of
satisfaction and accomplishment that you would get from
helping build up and progress our scene... knowing that you
 did your part.

*SELFISHNESS IS OVERCOME BY RESPECT*

Each rave event is not yours alone... it is a communal
experience made for everyone. It is the togetherness of
everyone that makes raves fun and fulfilling. To completely
kill a group experience it only takes a few individuals who
don't understand the concept of community. Here are some
examples of selfish acts. Each is followed by a way to
overcome the selfishness.

-RESPECTING THE PUBLICS'' OPINION OF RAVERS-
Visibility of drugs and alcohol-
Drugs are taboo to most of the public that forms an opinion about us... the
same public that gives us permission to
gather and rave. If you feel that you need to have your mood
elevated, please be discrete. Don't let anyone see the presence of drugs.
Don't give them a reason to accuse us. Nitrous
balloons are the biggest problem in this area. Balloons can easily be seen
from a great distance and the hiss of the valves
makes it very easy to find the tanks. PLEASE DON'T BRING BALLOONS OR
NITROUS TANKS INTO RAVES! Similarly marijuana can easily be smelled. It
is more difficult to find but don't make it obvious.

Being rude or obnoxious to non-ravers-
Rude and obnoxious behavior does nothing but upset people,
sometimes to the point of having them call the police. Please
be polite to any "outsider" that you encounter while on the
way to or away from a rave. Be polite to everyone for that
matter!

Noise-
Noise is a very big problem in most residential areas and is
often the reason for shut-downs. Please be as quiet as
possible going to site. Playing car radios loud, horn
honking, screeching tires and yelling can be louder than the
sound system enclosed in the venue. Loitering around in the
parking area is illegal and only draws unwanted attention to
the party. As you're walking to the door remember that you
are only moments away from being able to make as much
noise as you want!!

Fireworks-
Although cool to see, fireworks are a reason for instant shut-
downs. We all know about the danger of fires. Enough said.
Additionally, the loud explosions can be misconstrued as
gun-shots which will get the police to the location faster than
anything.

Guns and Violence-
Neither of these belong at a rave. It is our non-violent nature
that sets us apart... makes us better than than the rock and rap
scenes. Hopefully, a positive rave experience will change the
life of a violent natured person.

-RESPECTING EVENT FACILITIES AND THE DESERT-

Parking-
Park only where it is permitted and, once again, don't hang
out in the parking lot or on the streets. Don't throw trash and
flyers on the ground. Keep as low a profile as possible.

Tagging-
We lose locations because of tagging more than anything else.
Tagging simply tells the landlord that we don't have any
respect for him or his property even though it is the landlord
that has been so kind to share his property with us. Tagging
makes insurance rates climb. If you see someone tagging,
explain to them that they are keeping you from being able to
rave in L.A. Ask them if they want to continue to rave...
then ask them to please stop. Make sure everyone in the
area hears you so that they also become involved in making
the tagger stop.

Trash-
Many times the property owner is shocked by the trash left in
the facility, especially bathrooms. It only takes a few seconds
to find a trash can... a very worthwhile investment of your
time. Trash and especially flyers should NEVER be dropped
outdoors. The wind can blow them away and where they will
never be found... except perhaps by a park ranger or other
authority figure. It is very difficult to say "that trash
was already there when we got here" when the trash is a
bunch of rave flyers. Gum, candy and cig butts can be just as
incriminating.

-RESECT FOR OTHER RAVERS-

Aggression/Violence-
Part of the attraction of a rave is that it can be a place to escape the
craziness of the rest of the world. Leave your personal problems at the
door... don't bring them into the celebration. Alcohol often brings
about aggressive behavior as well.

The rave scene prides itself on its' peaceful nature so there is absolutely
no tolerance for violence or aggression. This even includes any
frustration that you may have with security, entry lines, etc.

A peaceful but enthusiastic attitude can quickly spread to others creating
a pocket of "vibe" that everyone will want to be a part of. Acceptance of
others, even those different from
you, catches on quickly and creates a bond among all of us. When outsiders
look in at our scene and see this bond, they cannot discredit it... they
can only see something positive...
perhaps it will be something that they will discuss with others. This is
the easieast way that we can create a more positive public image!

Blatant Selfishness-
This not only kills "the vibe" but it breaks us apart, making it difficult
to band together to help our movement as a whole. A prime example of this
is blatant nitrous usage. People sucking on balloons must know that they
are jeopardizing EVERYONE'S right to rave and yet they continue to do it.
Their short-term high becomes more important than the future of raving
itself. This kind of selfishness will certainly kill our future. PLEASE
DON'T BRING NITROUS TO RAVES... leave it at home where it won't be a
selfish act that discredits all of us.


part 4

*CARELESSNESS IS OVERCOME THROUGH ACCOUNTABILITY*

Carelessness, which sometimes is accidental, can easily be
overcome through a system of accountability. It only takes
two friends to commit to be accountable to each other in
reminding the other if they are being careless. The more
people you have in your accountability group (also called
"true friends"), the less likely you are to do something
careless. Create an acountability group with the
friends you rave with the most. Ask
someone to be accountable for you RIGHT
NOW!!!!

All you have to do is give a simple reminder.... speak up and
say, "I don't think it's such a good idea for you to do that."
Here are some places where carelessness becomes a problem
for each of us in the rave movement:

Forgetting about any of the above selfishness issues-
Go ahead... re-read them!

Driving safely-
There is nothing wrong with being too messed up or too tired
to drive home... unless of course you try to drive anyway.
Ask a more sober friend from your accountability group to
drive or wait until someone is able to drive. Coffee and other
stimulants won''t do the trick.. Take your time so you
and your friends can rave again another day!

Dealing with the wrong people-
Who are the wrong people? Unscrupulous drug dealers are just as problematic
as
undercover drug enforcement agents. If you think getting something "bunk"
is a problem.... think about how bad it would be if you bought something
poisonous or lethal! This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem as drug
manufacturers are finding cheaper ways to make money. Most of them aren't
chemists and don't bother testing their new batch... you may become a "test
subject" for an unknown substance. The media and law enforcement agencies
are infiltrating our masses to collect information to use against us at a
later time. You can never know who is who... so be careful. Know who
you're dealing with.

Loitering outside of the venue-
This only draws attention to the event and makes police curious enough to
"investigate." Loitering also makes it more difficult to patrol a parking
area to look for people breaking into cars or doing other selfish
activities that hurt individual ravers and hurt the scene overall. When
you're walking through a parking lot and you see people standing around ask
them to please go inside... but explain to them why it is important for
them to help in this regard.

Acting safely/Acting responsibly-
This is a broad area that has too many specific "infractions." Every once
in a while just ask yourself (and the people you''re accountable for) these
questions...

What am I doing?
Am I directly/indirectly harming myself or other ravers?
Am I keeping someone else from having a great time?
Am I helping build a positive public image about the rave scene?


part 5

*IGNORANCE IS OVERCOME THROUGH COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION*

Ignorance is the easiest problem to overcome but it also depends on
individual efforts.. All we need to do is educate ourselves. But two
things must happen before we can educate each other.

First, we must be willing to be educated... we must recognized that we are
being stupid and want to change.

And secondly, we must communicate with each other.

Since we have no organized arena for ravers to come together and
communicate we are held in the dark. We must find a centralized forum
where together we can learn from our past mistakes and innovate our future.
Until we find that forum, it is up to you to discuss these problems and
re-shape our future.

The existence of rave culture depends entirely on you to simply talk with
one another... to share all of these important issues with others... with
people you meet for the first time.

Know what you're talking about-
Rumors and misinformation are splitting us apart. Know the facts about the
realreasons for "busts"... or the dangers of certain substances. Don't let
yourself be used as a tool for a promoters personal gain... or mouthpiece
for fabricated drug hysteria.

Know what you're taking-
We've already discussed unscrupulous drug dealers. Don't combine lots of
different drugs! There are combinations of substances that can quickly
become lethal. In fact, more drug related casualties are due to lethal
combinations of drugs and alcohol than overdosing!

Let the DJ do the mixing!

Know your limit-
Your accountability group can help you with this. Be careful trying to
"bump" your dosage. Always let someone know exactly how much of what your
taking BEFORE you take it.

Know the law-
Get to know the specific legalities of possessing controlled substances.
Know the consequences if you're busted and ask yourself if it is worth the
risk.

Know how to handle yourself with the police-
Be cooperative but also know your rights regarding search and seizure laws
(especially in searching a vehicle). Avoid dragging down the rave scene
with you. Don't even mention
raves if you have a run in with officers. Be afraid of the seriousness of
the consequences but don't let yourself be intimidated to the point that
you incriminate yourself.

Know what to do in case of an emergency-
This is a very important area if we wish to police ourselves at raves.

In case of an overdose or other drug related medical trauma
follow these steps before calling an ambulance.

1)Move the victim to a safe, private and discrete area away
from the noise and everyone else.

2)Find out EVERYTHING that they took... including
dosage, combinations and alcohol.

3)Find the victims friends.

4)Don't panic. Some drug related trauma can be relieved
simply through sleeping it off.

5)Find someone trustworthy and knowledgeable about those
substances and get their advice. (Like Medi-Rave!)

6)Do NOT administer CPR, induce vomiting, or other
first aid proceedures unless fully capable and qualified.

7)In the desert or in a hot venue, dehydration
could be the problem, so try drinking some water.

8)If necessary ask security to call for help or ambulance.

Know your promoters-
It's time that ravers determine how much an event is worth.
If you think you're getting ripped off or if a promoter is
constantly being busted... STOP SUPPORTING THOSE EVENTS!!! Try to remember
that promoter's other events. Think about what the promoter promised for
those raves...

Bust-free? (which might not really possible anymore)
Carnival rides/visuals/multiple areas?
Free water/gifts/etc.?
Big name Djs/bands?

So what do you and your accountability group do if you're
not getting your money's worth? All of you should:

-find and tell the promoter that you're not satisfied
-leave a message(s) on the voice mail
-don't go to that promoter''s events again
-write letters to local music magazines
-post to the internet rave related mail groups
-throw your own event... large or small!!!

Remember that many promoters throw raves for a living and
that they must make money. We're not asking promoters to
lose money! We're thankful that they go through all the
hassle to even HAVE an event to go to. However, we ARE
asking promoters to re-invest into the scene.... after all... if
the scene doesn't survive, the promoters don't survive either.

Support promoters that are helping our movement flourish...
that are innovating with creative ideas...that deliver what they
promise... that re-invest in the scene... that respect ravers,
DJs, venues, officers, public opinion and Mother Earth!


part 6

The best way to combat ignorance is to get and stay informed.
All that is required of this is communication! Call unbiased
info lines to get the "scoop" on upcoming events. Read the
local magazines that report on rave culture.

Perhaps the BEST way to get informed is... if you know
someone with an internet connection... get online! Subscribe
to So-Cal Raves or visit web sites like Dr. Freeclouds and
Hyperreal (see next page).

The information and feedback offered by online
communication can really benefit you as an individual raver
and will help the rave movement flourish overall. Here's
what you can get from being informed through the net:

-A calendar of upcoming raves, clubs, after-hours and rave-related radio/TV
shows
-Help determine which promoters and events are worthwhile
-Find out about events that you may have missed
-Read other ravers'' opinions of events, DJs, music, and mix tapes
-Find out more about DJs or bands you like
-Voice your frustrations about specific rave related issues
-Get advanced info on location, line-up, changes, and mergers
-Get info on specific drug-related warnings or scams
-Learn more about rave/DJ culture
-Find out about unpromoted events and micro-raves
-MOST IMPORTANTLY...
Find new raver friends that share similar tastes and views with you.

Getting Online-

To learn more about So-Cal Raves visit the So-Cal Raves
WWW homepage. You''ll find info about the list, the people
on it, the calendar of events and how to subscribe.

I once thought being an Aquarian was the supreme.  Unfortunately, this
age of darkness is destroying me.  For the second time in two months, I
am having to pull the engine from my sailboat The Pleiadies - my
insurance company is giving me two weeks to get another out of water
survey done before they drop me, my fridge quit, my hands are so hacked
from working on the boat I can't even hold a guitar pick.  

Giving me all the more reason to rave - Gathering of the Tribes in SB
went off!!!  Thomas Michael lifted my spirits out of the darkness and
into the light.  The universal positive vibe was incredible! If any
SFRavers need something new, get your head down to little SB paradise.

>the top three reasons the underground will not become inundated with
>clubbers, frat boys,


I used to live in a frat house in Berkeley.   They were renting out extra rooms.
This one kid, he always wanted to know why I was strolling in with a smile
on my face at 7 in morning.

So one night, I decided I was going to show him what it was all about.

He hasn't been the same since.

A couple of things he said to me on the way home the next morning, with a
dazed beautiful sad happy look in his eyes:

  o  "All those ravers.   They just keep...raving."

  o  "Everything's different.  Nothing looks like it did yesterday."

  o  "Some guy kept touching me and I was scared people would think I was
gay, but then I realized that it was okay."

  o  "I can't figure out what those kids are doing, but I know it's
something good."


later,

boomerang

I just got the latest XLR8R yesterday and I was thinking about this the 
other day.  The mag has changed from paper back to glossy magazine print 
and in comes the more sponsers, the latest equipment adds.  There are 
mass expansions of music avaliable now - record stores opening every 
where(one is in the works for here in San Luis).  Dj's are getting 
bigger, parties too, BUT there is still a thriving underground.  I hope 
it can all coexist in positivity.  Will it survive strong, for as many 
years as we can put positive energy into it. ( and not get diluted into 
just a fad).

I hope so.


PLUR,

ps this issue is about the darker side of our scene.

Ahhhh the rebirth of a newbie.  We are all born ravers, some take longer 
than others to recover from society.

<< If part of your identification with the rave scene is because of some 
 feelings of a "secret club" that "we've" got better taste, "we're" more 
 "cool" than the rest of the world, think about your real motivations
 and if there might be a little bit of ego talking there. >>

 I just have to say..... this is why i  was *SO SO SO* GLAD to be out of High
School!!!
In high school, everyone was in a secret club but me, and everyone had better
taste, and eeryone was more "cool" then me!   One of the reasons i love to
rave with all of my heart, soul and mind is because i am accepted by all, and
rejected by none, i can be a part of a community, that loves me, and
embrasses me for all that i am, and i am not afraid of being "uncool".  So
even if like, eating at Taco Bell isn't my thing, or frat parties, or
whatever, i know that i will share the love, when ever i feel the urge to,
and i *heartily* thank my raver brothers and sisters for helping me with the
confidence to do so!
Yeah Whooo for acceptance!!!!


------==00==-------LunaTune------==00==-----

--you can skip these paranoid rantings and ravings *wink* i advise you do--

** ** ** on a side note.. there is one thing that does kind of sit odd with
me.. You see, i know a bit about how and why things are made... like why
certian commercials use certian diddys.. and how the commercials are set in
rotation, and just rightly positioned to get to the most number of viewers,
at the right times... and not just commercials, but *anything* that has been
run through a company designed to sell to the mass public.  Now, at a rave,
we know the DJ's.. we can talk with them, and kick it with them.. but what
about these people making the music for these commercials?  I mean.. i read
reports on how sales are increased by the pace of music in a grocery store..
hence, the birth of muzak.. they will rotate the songs, so that, well, for
example: first, play a slow song, and gradually the songs get faster, and
this is encoragement for shoppers to think about buying.. (the slow muzak)
and gradually work their way up to decision (muzak getting faster) and at the
peak, buy the items and get out! and the cycle repeats... Well, if this
works.. wow, scary, and if it dosn't, wow, scary!  It dosn't seem *right*.
I just don't know.... i mean, sharing is one thing. but sucking people in and
molding them to be better consumers.. yikes! ;)  We all know the hypnotic
effect of techo music, we know how cool it is, and we know how addicting it
is.. i would just hate to see it exploited for the wrong reason... i mean,
untill recently, techo music was kept underground, but my fear is that these
companies, that are just set up to find what *SELLS* will use this for making
us better consumers... 
boy oh boy am i paranoid...  i think it is mostly because, being raised in
this generation, i was really taught to fear any "authority" and anything
that isn't on my own level of understanding... so maybe in my heart of
hearts, i'd feel much safer if my beautiful world of raving, music, people,
 and attitude, stays right where it is, underground...
on the other hand...... HAY, we're ready for change ;) let the world in on
our love!!

 Hi folks -

 I've been isolating myself from the local rave scene for awhile
( still lurking on sfraves ), due to personal priorities. 

 I was going to try to get to CF's Condensation, but was too late
to buy tickets . So, now I'm more depressed, and feel the need 
to rave!

 So, I'm asking for recommendations for this weekend. I'll be doing 
some manual labor during the day on Saturday, but I should be rested
up enough for something Saturday night. 

 Checking the calendar....

 Larry "Blueboy" Ching / larryc@netcom.com

 Well, I made 42 in January, and started going to these "rave" things
in 1992, so I'm close to the description!

 I would LIKE to have lots of space to dance - and whatever the dance
floor crowd density, I try to dance the way I want to ( no point going
to a party if I can't be "uncool" on the dance floor! ).

 I try to bring my wife whenever possible - she likes the music, but
doesn't have my endurance or limberness. I've been depressed lately,
and haven't gone to a rave in over a month. She's the one who 
suggested I go to something this weekend! Gotta love her ...

 !!!!Worshipping me! Damn, I never noticed! I'll have to start asking
for sacrifices, or maybe just monetary donations...

 Ha! I just pace myself - sneaking off where someone can't see you and 
taking naps helps to maintian that "superman" image.

 Nobody's told me I'm a role model - scary thought, actually.

 Actually, that's how I finance going to $20 massives - I contact 
everyone's parents, and mom and pop pay me to spy on their kiddies.

If you can listen to Realaudio, check out:

	http://www.orbitrecords.com/hs97.html

There you'll find five tracks completed recently by Heatsync, one of
Orbitrecords' newer artists.  The encodings are full-length, stereo, and
require 28.8 or better.  It's good stuff (imo, of course), so check it
out :)

Hi SFR!

A friend of mine is starting a web page and would like input from the rave
community. His URL is http://www.n8dog.com. He's starting a drug archive, a
government sucks page, and a few others (including a rave page). Please check
it out and send him your ideas.  Send ideas to ideas@n8dog.com, and if you find
any problems or bugs, send those to problems@n8dog.com. 

Thank you all!

This weekend, on Saterday, in front of the San Francsico Fedral Building is
the Ward Valley Toxic Waste Dump Protest.

I urge all sfravers to come out for this event.  Moontribe, one of Southern
California's most incredible outdoor production team is hosting this.  They
are teaming up with some of the best promoters from the bay area, including
CCC.

You should come to this becuase (1) is a very good cause.  After having
some truly spiritual experiences in the magical Southern California desert,
I feel really shocked that they want to start putting massive toxic waste
dumps out there.  And (2) it is one of those rare occations when top-notch
production people from both socal and the bay area are teaming up for a
good cause.

Show your support!  Enjoy funky beats!  Do watcha want, just don't miss
this event.

Supreme Court Hears Internet Indecency Case

WASHINGTON (Reuter) - A Clinton administration attorney attempted
Wednesday to convince the U.S.  Supreme Court to uphold a law regulating
indecent words and pictures on the Internet to shield children from
sexually explicit material.

"The Internet threatens to give every child with access to an
interactive computer a free pass into the equivalent of every adult
bookstore and video outlet in the country," government attorney Seth
Waxman said during arguments in the historic case about free-speech
rights in cyberspace.

But Bruce Ennis, an attorney representing a diverse coalition that
challenged the law, replied that the measure amounted to
unconstitutional government censorship that violates free-speech rights
of adult Internet users.

"This law is a ban on indecent speech in cyberspace," he said of the
year-old measure approved by Congress and signed by President Clinton
that imposes government regulation on the worldwide computer network
used by about 40 million people.

The law makes it a crime punishable by as much as two years in prison to
transmit sexually explicit material to anyone younger than 18.  But the
law bars prosecution of Internet transmitters who take "reasonable,
effective and appropriate actions" to restrict access to minors.

"One of the real democratizing aspects of the Internet is that average
citizens can speak to the world for free," Ennis said, warning that the
law inhibits speakers in chat-rooms and affects what individuals put on
the World Wide Web.

He argued that the law will not be effective as children still will be
able to get access to indecent material posted on the Internet from
foreign nations and said less-restrictive measures, including parental
control, were available.

During 70 minutes of arguments, the high court justices vigorously
questioned both sides about the rapidly changing Internet technology and
whether minors could be prevented from accessing sexually explicit
material.

The justices appearing skeptical of the government's defense of the law,
but gave no clear sign of how they would rule.  A decision in the
landmark case, which could affect future regulation of the Internet, is
due by July.

Waxman, the Justice Department's deputy solicitor general, told the
court an estimated 8,000 sexually explicit sites already existed on the
World Wide Web, and that the number would double every nine months.

"The problem is very, very serious," he said, adding that minors could
be stopped from accessing indecent material through the use of credit
cards and adult identification numbers, which cost as little as $5 a
year.

But Justice Stephen Breyer questioned whether the government might
prosecute a group of high school students who discuss in a chat-room
their sexual experiences.

"That's been known to happen in high school," Breyer said.  The law
would make "a large number of high school students guilty of a federal
crime."

Justice Antonin Scalia interjected, asking, "There's no high school
exemption?" as the courtroom erupted in laughter.

Waxman sought to salvage his argument by saying the law sought to
prevent a high school student from using a computer in a bedroom to get
access to Penthouse, Hustler or other sexually explicit material that
normally would not be sold to a minor.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor seemed concerned about the restrictions,
describing the Internet as "a public place because anyone can get online
and have a conversation.  It is much like a street corner or a park."

On software programs that keep minors out of sexually explicit sites,
Waxman said it was not feasible.  "There simply is no way (parents and
software companies) can keep up with what can or cannot be screened
out," he said.

Ennis emphasized he had challenged only the law's restrictions on
"indecent" or "patently offensive" material, not already illegal child
pornography and obscene material.

He said the law goes too far and would make it a crime for parents to
send an indecent e-mail message to their college freshman child.

i've pretty much said all i have to say during the preceeding discussion.
there is however one thing i'd like to add.

i believe that the heavy ab-use of happiness drugs like crack and ecstacy is
a sympton of a social problem rather than the cause of the problem. drugs
have always been used by humans and animals. they have been scapegoated to
distract from the real problem (disastrous social and economic
circumstances) by a society hostile to hedonism. drugs have a bad name. it
is poverty, desperation, a shit job, unhappiness that drives us to overdo it
with drugs and misuse them ( i have a personal problem with people who drink
too much alcohol. too much!). happy people don't need that much drugs. i for
example smoke less dope when i am not working than when i am.

we shouldn't really have this discussion. people should just accept that at
least for some of us drugs are a part of life and of our experiences in
growing up, learning (especially about ourselves), and socialising, forming
bonds (smoking the peace pipe).

it's all real! drugs are real! drug induced experiences are real!
change society and the drug problem won't be one anymore.

and with that i wish you all a good life experience with or without the
drugs of your choice.
iris

p.s. i like to refer to drugs as mind-expanding.

Whats happening everyone??

	Tonight at exactly 5:55 am (which I guess makes it tomorow morning) is the Spring Equinox.

	There will be a free beach party someplace in Santa Cruz to celebrate this event.  There is 
no info number that I know of yet, but if any of you would like to go, I will put the directions 
on the Buzz-Line tonight after 10pm.  Call 415-569-3300 for info and details. 	There might 
also me directions on the "Gahtering-Basics" info line  @   415-905-9629.  The tentative location 
is someplace around Pidgen Point Beach, or someplace like that.

	Anyways,  hope to see everyone out there tonight.  Dress warm, buckle up and drive safely.

Keep it real,
Ray Vonie

For fucks sake it was a funny satire. It's not really like meant to be 
real. Chill. You have to admit, most of this stuff is true in the same 
was sterytypes can be seen as true. It's like you get the characteristics 
of something and you overblown it, that's actually what acedemics call 
comedy. Sigh. Can't please anyone, off course there are exceptions and 
nothing is static and monolithic. I am not stupid,

Thank you, Too Short!  (not the rapper, I presume :P

These are great... if they or other guidelines were printed and 
distributed at parties, it would go a long way towards education, 
responsible raving AND the building of community and realizing what it's 
all about (or helping to recreate what it SHOULD be about!).

Now, who wants to do it? ;)

It's a real trip when you go around handing them out, because people think 
you're handing of Jesus stuff at first. But When I did it down in LA, it 
was really really nice that people didn't throw them on the floor and 
took it home with them. We handed out quite a lot (over 200), and we only 
saw one on the floor.  But it 
took me 3 hours to make 50. Do it 1while  on the phone, so I encourage 
everyone to do some!!! AND the best part is, you feel all pleased with 
yourself.

I have been looking for a new place to live in San 
Francisco for well over 2 months and I am getting fed 
up.  Becuase of this, I want to try a new stragety.  
What I want to do is get 2-3 compatible roommates 
together before we have  actually found a flat.  Finding 3-4 
bedroom flats is  not that difficult, but with landlords 
demanding first, last and deposit, total costs to grab a flat 
run upwards of 4500-5500 dollars.

I would like to find 2-3 other people who would be 
compatible roommates and search for a flat with them.  
If we find a place, we can all chip in aproximately 
1600 dollars to cover total move-in costs.  All of our 
names would also be on the lease.  My target date to 
find a place is april 1.

Here are some general guidelines for the type of 
people I am looking to live with.  These are just 
general guidelines:

-Under 30 years old
-Steady job with good income.
-Ravers, Junglists, Househeads, Trip-Hoppers, Trancers, 
ect. into electronic dance music. (dj, or producer?  yeah!)
-Male or female.
-*very* clean, *very* respectful of other roommates.
-Watches very little or no television.
-Creative.
-Into computers/technology.
-Into enjoying all the cool and unique things SF has to 
offer.

I'm a 24 year old electrical engineer who is best 
described by the qualities above.  I am interested in 
finding a flat in Potrero Hill, SOMA, Lower Haight, 
Mission or Delores Park. I'd consider other areas depending 
on the flat, but I would really like to stay on the east side 
of the city.

If you are interested, email me at tsheets@saturn5.com

The Raver Handbook is available on socalraves website, which I think
is accessible by link from SFRaves website.. I've downloaded 
it myself in the past, because I think it's such a good resource.

Last year, someone printed out a copy in the booklet form it was designed
to go into, and brought them to a couple of parties ... I know I grabbed one and
held on until someone borrowed it and didn't return it.

I'd love to see it refined and polished and printed up in greater quantities 
to hand out!  I've had it in mind to contact the person (people?) who put it
together and see if they'd mind us building on it.

One place the handbook is at is:

http://www.best.com/~dlowe/handbook.html

I wouldn't mind getting involved in formatting it and printing up
a bunch of copies!

After doing some research I found that buying from overseas is not
a good option since customs is seizing most GHB coming in.  However,
there are companies selling kits.  For example, www.bondtechcorp.com
has a kit to make 180-200g for $162.50.  I will try them out and let
you know how it goes.

Two days go by. No time to check E-Mail.
But here I am on Tuesday..

 I was refering to acting a certian way on the list. Like you being all
compassionate or whatever. It gets old. I am sick of hearing people bash on
someone else, simple to (what looks like to me) look like the all n mighty
love goddess ravEr.
 Like the way you change the subject at the end of your flame.. You
wouldn't understand.
Go squeeze a teddybear.

As far as me.. I only have one major problem with myself.. And that is...

=]
But as far as compassionate.. I hate to see someone cry. So sue me.
Peace..

Hey people -

I will be in Las Vegas this weekend.  I know this is short notice, but I
was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction in terms of
raving down there?

Info lines?  Shops to look for flyers?  Specific parties this weekend?
Anything would help.

Thanks very much!

	I personaly agree with Leslie.  This is a wonderful 'Idea' but it needs
a seriouse makeover if it is to be circulated.  In my opinion, it needs
a lot of refinement and polishing.  I talked to Sara Tonen (great name)
and the other people that made this booklet when I first saw it about a
two years ago.  This thing was writen by LA promoters, for the LA ravers
during a perio of negativity in the LA scene.  

	This "educational" pamplet could seriously backfire due to its
content.  It makes a lot of negative implications that ravers are
'disrespectful drug ingesting thoughtless troublemakers'  Now we know
that this is not the case, but the way this thing is writen, it is very
easy for an outsider to interit this pamplet as such.  If this thing got
into the wrong hands (parants, media, police, city oficials...etc.) then
it would look very bad for the rave scene.

	This is pamplet was desighned as a "REACTIVE" tactic by the LA
promoters to inform people in the LA scene that they are acting like a
bunch of ignorant and disrespectfull junkies and are destroying the
scene.

	Thank goodnes we are not to this point yet, but we are close.
	
	That we could use is a "PROACTIVE" information pamplet that does not
imply negative conotations, and does not sound like a lecture.  I have
actualy been working on one myself, but could definently use some more
input.  If anybody would like to contribut to it please e-mail me.


hope to see you all at Pigen point lighthouse beach tonight for the
equinox party.

I am a compassionate person. If it makes you sick you have a problem. The
reason I changed the subject is because I'm not on this list to have a
ongoing argument with you.

We're obviously very different people. It's not work your time or mine to
continue you this. I think a lot of poeple can agree with me regarding the
response to your e-mail about the women who died. If you can't see that
then there's no point.

It's not a flame either. I want to know where you're coming from when you
make judgments and say things that are directed towards me. I don't care
what someone says about me. But it's nice to know why if we're on the same
majordomo mailing list and you make the effort to respond the way ya do.

Lets drop it here. It's ruining the vibe I have right now listening to LTJ
Bukem's Logical Progression.

Today was a good day...... I bought my fat stereo which is pumping as we
speak. I can't wait for the little party I'm throwing when my friend from
LA comes up this weekend. I just hope I'm going to be well enough to host
it. I've been home since Friday.

Anyone got any good CDs they recommend people to get? I'm REALLY getting
into JUNGLE. I love it. Especially when it's good like this double CD from
LTJ which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Peace Love Unity Respect,
Know it, feel it, live it.

There is unity in the air the last couple of nights. Is it my imagination
or are things changing for the better??

It isn't just a "toxic waste dump" proposed -- it's a repository for the
entire nation's nuclear waste, from both power plants and weapons
processing.  And the issue isn't the "desert," per se, it's whether there
is a possibility that the site will leak into the Colorado River aquifer --
the river is less than 20 miles from the site, and the aquifer is much
larger.  Earthquake risk is being seriously overlooked as well -- the
desert earthquakes of two years ago show that inland southern California
will be the site of large-scale quakes in the future.

Simply put, nuclear waste is unsafe, but the government and nuclear
industry is convinced that there is a feasible way to put the waste
somewhere and the problem will go away.  In order to find Ward Valley
"safe" -- or any nuclear waste storage site relying on underground storage
-- the courts have basically said they agree with the assumptions of
scientists who believe it will be safe, despite the utter impossiblity of
any assurances over any time period.

Whether you agree or not with the issue that nuclear waste needs some
remote depository, the particular site chosen has not been nearly
established as the "best" even under the scientists' assumptions -- just
the one the government wants.

ravers should glow by black light, not radiation ...

  I talked to Sara Tonen (great name)

His name is KC, everyone gets confused.

Oh, YAY MORE LA BASHING! Here we are talking about what a great thing 
people in socal-raves did, but we can't leave it alone can we? WE have to 
say something bad about LA. What's new on this list! YEAH, I am a 
ignorant, derespectful, junkie.... thanks a lot. Please let's be honest 
it was a few people who did stupid things, but to generalise about LA is 
ridiculous. Anyway, many of us were part of the process of the booklet, and 
we were part of the scene. 

Can you READ The booklet again. I think there was something about 
respect. 

Nailvarnish
(the LA bashing grouch) 

Question: Why do you think that's OKAY to generalise about 8 million 
people? Why is it okay to bash LA and not anything else? It's some of ours 
home. Geez.

Sorry for those who hate LA, I am going to keep bring this up, until 
people are aware what they are saying.

As Monty tried to point out to you earlier, this statement implies some
assumptions about the ghetto, and about the people that live there (probably
not by choice, btw).  Not all low-income people exhibit or condone the type
of behavior people saw on display at the Planet New Year party, I'm assuming
you know.  Your statement is very classist, possibly racist, and whether you
meant it to be or not (I realize you probably didn't), your language is
absolutely offensive.  Think about that please.  SERIOUSLY!

Sunset is happening again? What's the number?? where's it at?? Is it at
the usual Sunday afternoon east bay location (Berkeley Marina or Point
Molotte??) Yay -- spring is here...

--------------------

Also, FYI, I was listening to David Ganz' excellent "Dead to the World"
show on KPFA (94.1 8PMish Wed) and he had an interview w/ Mountain Girl
(Jerry Garcia's ex-partner) who mentioned at great length that she
found the rave scene to be a good follow-on to the Dead show vibe.
Unfortunately, she made some unecessary comment about how you don't
always need real musicians up on the stage performing -- "everybody can
dance to a tape" -- but she totally missed the point w/ the
musicianship of the DJ and the never-heard-from underground network
that produces the records and white-labels played by DJ's at raves. To
say nothing about the DJ's job of sorting through amazing piles of
mediocre generic crap dance music to find a few uplifting booty-shaking
tunes and stringing  a bunch of them together into a seamless
the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-it's-parts experience.

It's true that many a raver thinks their vibe (and their L and X, if so
inclined) is something completely new under the sun, but let me tell
you that vibe (and vibe accessories) were also present at those
delicious outdoor Dead shows of the mid-80's, e.g. Frost Amphitheater,
Greek Theater, Cal Expo, etc. And I'm sure that spirit was probably
there in the late 60's too. I've been doing it since '82 (first dead
show -- Frost Ampitheater) and '88 (first raves -- Ibiza's Amnesia and
London's Shoom/Spectrum). I'm glad there's still a festival scene today
with different players and different music and a new generation of
fledglings itching to burn their wings against the sun. And this is
going to keep on happening forever and ever -- it's what makes life
interesting, even as one becomes old enough to have seen it all before.

Anyways, between the transition of deadheads into ravers and the
frequent mentions of "electronica" on MTV and in the press, the less
evolved might be inclined to say stuff like  "it sounds like we'll all
soon need to find something new and different to groove to if we're to
remain hip cutting edge underground frisco types." :-). 

That's your fear talking -- what's wrong if everybody starts listening
to music that sucks less, and sounds more interesting? And if you don't
like the way things are, then find power in rebellion.  Perhaps rave
needs a punk movement, or a new wave movement? Perhaps it's time for
acid big band backwards lounge music? Can I stuff some Xavier Cugat or
Martin Denny into my sampler and have it come out funky? Or is that
already oh-so-five-minutes-ago??

Also, those of you who have previously discussed how Bowie's latest
album is mainstreaming techno -- that's old hat for him. Check out his
old song "Fame" whose funk is 100% lifted riff-for-riff and
beat-for-beat from an old James Brown tune called "Hot (I need to be
Loved, Loved, Loved)"... And then there's the Beatles and the Stones
and Led Zeppelin with the Blues... to say nothing about the Dead who
probably played more covers American traditional tunes than original
songs (and to those who paid enough attention to realize that the Dead
were doing electric remakes of old songs, you find joy in hearing
something old and cobweb-strewn coming back all shiny, radiating a  new
light, reinterpreted for your time and generation...)...

Music is synthesis. If it werent' synthesis, it would sound like noise
and we wouldn't recognize it as music. Music is a form of social and
cultural memory for humans -- if it weren't for people stealing styles
and riffs, then a whole lot of people would end up being exposed to
very few sounds, few ethnic concepts & traditions, few diverging ideas.
A lot of sounds & ideas would be forgotten, a lot of wheels would be
reinvented, and life would be very very boring. Music is the reading
and writing and arithmetic of emotion and the soul.

Okay, i know we are all into techno, but is there anyone out there who likes
Morphine? i hear they are comming to the area on the 31st, and i have been a
long since fan, but i just am too new to the bayarea to have met someone with
my taste in music, that i could drag along with me.
Hence, if any one is either, 1) a Morphine fan, and would like to go to the
concert with me, or 2) is going and has an extra seat, and extra tolerance,
please please please email me...  i'm about to give up, at any rate, it is
entirely possible that i am the only one on this list who likes Morphine...

 ummm, hello? I don't see this as LA bashing. I do see you overreacting

I wrote this last year:

SUNSET '96

The glow of our energy melting with the 
sun in the ocean.
brewing the storm of love burning throughout the
souls that gather around the shawman.
The master passively allowing the ritual to
develop through the music which controls the ceremony.
Gathering, not quite knowing the purpose
Sharing our separate views of life
Allowing one another a glimpse into another
being's reality
Experiences which are shared for the
purpose of growing.
As we look to see the sun ....... set

But don't you think that it reflects a facet of your personality? Sober or
altered, any action you take reflects something inside you, rather it is
one of your more prominent or one of your more subdued traits, it is all
part of who you are.

this friday there are two DOPE DJs from LA whom own a store together
(namely Simply Jeff and Ron D. Core), which makes me wonder why they are
split up and playing at two parties. I love hardcore, and I love breakbeat,
now my brain is scrambled as to which party to go to. 

Why don't these parties join together, for the best of both worlds?

what party are you ppl going to?

But I had too, because you forgot to take out the trash and clean the
toilets. And Rover took a crap on my new carpet. Clean it Jeff, or I'll

YES! I talked to promoter Scott on the phone on Tuesday, and he said the
party scheduled on March 14th-postponed, *will* be happening tomorrow
night! Reason being, one of the guys got food poisoning in while in Israel.
 See all you great peoples there tomorrow night!

Peace, Willy

Once upon a time, In a land not so far away..........There were two Djs.
One would spin funky breaks and hip hop @45 and techno 45s@33 and the other
played furiously as fast as he could. They were a great team and loved by
all.Then terrible things started happening to thier once glorious scene and
the team split. One would  come north, where he became legendary.........the
other stayed in the south where he kept on going faster and more furious...
	I miss DX2!!!!! Iwish dan (aka mr.bring the noise@45) and Ron D Core were @
the same party! 
 	Even tho they have gone their own way........oh well both djs are dope!!I
am going to m6 cause I've waited way too damn long to see ron spin in the bay
area!The last time I remember he was up here was for Speed Raver(back in 92
or 93  ) when he was still with Dan as DX2. Welcome back Ron D Core! Don't be
a Stranger now, Ya Hear?!

Woooo, settle down buddy.  I never neant to 'bash' LA at all, or the
scene down there, and I am very sorry that that is what you think my
intenetions were.   All I was trying to say was that the booklet is not
a good thing to circulate the way it is writen because it was not writen
for the sf area, but for the LA area.  I don't know how you concluded
that I am Bashing LA with my post, but I think that you are 'too close
to the trees and can't see the forest' kinda thing.  I think that this
booklet was a wonderful thing for LA promoters to do, and it is a very
inspirational "MODEL" for other promoters to follow with, but IMO it is
compleatly inapropriate to be circulated as is without refinement.

> Can you READ The booklet again. I think there was something about
> respect.

Just for you I did read the booklet again and I am even more convinced
that this thing is more of a liability than a resource.  I read all the
wonderful things about respect.....BUT I also read the things on Nitrus
tanks,  Guns, Alcahole, Disturbing the poeace, DRUGS,DRUGS,and More
DRUGS, Loitering, Vandalism, and a bunch of DownTalking that is
obviously targeted towards one spacific crowd, not the entire scene.

Thsi booklet is a good start, but it is outdated and locational.  If it
is going to be passed out in this area, it should be revised, and
configured to identify and adress our isues, not LA's two years ago.  I
said that I was already working on one, so don't fight me, help me out
and contribute your positive input.

I don't think it is OKAY to bash anybody, and I'm not sure how you came
to the conclusion that when I was talking about the troublemakers in the
LA rave scene, That I was implying that all 8 million residence were
like that.  Settle down man, we're all ravers here.

Just in case you would like to give it another shot, attatched is my
original post.  Thanks.

        I personaly agree with Leslie.  This is a wonderful 'Idea' but
it needs
a seriouse makeover if it is to be circulated.  In my opinion, it needs
a lot of refinement and polishing.  I talked to Sara Tonen (great name)
and the other people that made this booklet when I first saw it about a
two years ago.  This thing was writen by LA promoters, for the LA ravers
during a period of negativity in the LA scene.  

        This "educational" pamplet could seriously backfire due to its
content.  It makes a lot of negative implications that ravers are
'disrespectful drug ingesting thoughtless troublemakers'  Now we know
that this is not the case, but the way this thing is writen, it is very
easy for an outsider to interprit this pamplet as such.  If this thing
got
into the wrong hands (parants, media, police, city oficials...etc.) then
it would look very bad for the rave scene.

        This is pamplet was desighned as a "REACTIVE" tactic by the LA
promoters to inform people in the LA scene that they are acting like a
bunch of ignorant and disrespectfull junkies and are destroying the
scene.

        Thank goodnes we are not to this point yet, but we are close.
        
        That we could use is a "PROACTIVE" information pamplet that does
not
imply negative conotations, and does not sound like a lecture.  I have
actualy been working on one myself, but could definently use some more
input.  If anybody would like to contribut to it please e-mail me.


hope to see you all at Pigen point lighthouse beach tonight for the
equinox party.

I completely agree with Ray's sentiment that the handbook could use some 
refinement.  While the message is great I think it would be a lot more 
inspirational to focus more on a positive philosophical message than to 
dwell on not being negative.  Something of this type should point out 
where we're going, not where we've been, or where we shouldn't go.  

How can we as a collective compile an asortment of ideologies which we 
all (for the most part) agree with?  Suggestions?  I personally would 
suggest such things as a variety of classical philosophical and/or 
religious texts as a good starting point.  Not necessarily exact 
quotations, but just to get a flavor for how all things, on some abstract 
level, are really describing the same deeper reality (because there is 
nothing else to describe!).  Hyperreal has some great links to such 
material, such as the Tao te Ching.

Anyway, just thought i'd give a little input on the subject...  :-)

Happy spring break!

love,
brett

Subject: Audio Impact last night!
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Just a quick note to say.... yeah!

I had a blast last night. It was so great to be back at the 115 Minna
space; I had missed that location, both for its vibe and for those
really great hardwood floors (a treat to dance on). Audio Impact
always goes off when it's there (with no problem from the local
authorities)... I hope we're invited back. :)

The decorations / visuals were comfortably minimal: the signature
cloth netting on the ceiling, the single flashing strobe hidden behind
the speakers, and just one black light.

The music last night was extremely varied, probably due to the tag
teaming that took place all night; everytime I looked up, there was
yet another DJ behind the decks. I could have gone for more techstep,
but there was still enough hard stuff to keep me moving.

The sound was especially powerful! It looked like Gateway had an extra
bass cabinet for each side, and there was another sound system in the
back (I'm assuming that was Dave Bayer's?) to complete all four
corners.

The night ended at 2am for me, so who knows how long it went on. But,
as always, I had the _best_ time, and I wish I could have stayed longer.

Steve

	Naw, it was the new improved SPAZ system (same bass cabs as mine
though, though they got a better amp to push em with) as were the most of
the taperies. So now, sometime, my system plus Rebecca's system plus the
Gateway system would be a nice treat (actually, I think that would be the
same system Gateway brought up to Burning man)... Now if only we could all
agree on some music to play through it ;)

With incredible excitement, and (gulp) the liquidation of all my assets, I
am planning a summer-long trip all over Europe!  YEA!!  I am traveling
with a dear and wonderful person, whose only fault is that she is a
non-raver.  Even so, I intend to submit our itinerary to any machination
necessary to end up in Berlin July 12.  <evil laugh>

The questions are: Did anyone go to this last year?  Is it only a techno
festival, or is it more of a huge mass carnival/party?  I can't tell
whether it's a contained "mega-rave", or an excuse for all of Europe's
young people to descend on Berlin for a few days and party their asses
off, ala Brazil's Carnival.  And is anyone planning on going? 

Replies appreciated,

Nancy
soon-to-be
world-traveling raver!

I agree with this statement above.  When I am under any kind of 
substance, I still act like myself.  Maybe some people act like Jeckyll 
and Hyde, but I bet most folks still pretty much act how they always do: 
their core personalities don't change.

Doesn't everyone? :-)

I should have said I was e-mailing a friend... :-) I don't want to give
his e-mail address out. 

He's a cool guy, and I don't think he'd have a problem giving it to you if
you asked.

Anyone have Dead Cities? I have ISDN and it's pretty cool. FSOL mixes some
tight remixes but their albums are pretty down tempo ambient. It's all
good.

YEAH...lets rent the oakland coliseum for the weekend and have 
a 3day giant rave-stock. Or maybe we could use the presidio.
I like the idea of turning these old cold war relics into something
that can be used for peace.

submissive to the restrictions of nineteenth-century music.  Today we are
fighting for their emancipation.  Tomorrow, with electronic music in our
ears, we will hear freedom."

Don't even listen to it at the store.  Just do as follows:
1) Grab the CD
2) Take it to the counter and pay for it (don't forget your change!)
3) go home
4) get in your favorite headspace
5) dim the lights
6) put it in, close your eyes and bug out

stories or any positive contributing material that they would like to
share with us.

If any one has any input that they would like to submit for
consideration to be published in our newsletter, then please forward it
to me via e-mail.

the event is called "a Feel Good Experience" so if anybody has any
special or personal rave experiences that they want to share, peotry,
deep thougths, or any form of insightful, or positive contribution
please send it soon.  

Experiences make up our lives.  they determin and shape the individual
that we become.

Our rave scene is built like a chain of experieces by comon people with
a comon goal.

Sharing these experiences is a contribution in and of itself.

I am looking forward to reading some of your inspirational rightings and
poems.

space permiting, we will be able to publish a few of them in the
newsletter, but I do promis that I will consider each and every
submision.

It is basically only a techno carnival/party. But by now techno is so
diverse ranging from Gabber 
to ambient that you have a pretty broad mixture of people there.

It is a good excuse for all techno minded Europeans to go there and dance
their ass off.
And then again 70% of them are Germans.

I will be there this year, that's for sure.

Hey April,

I hate to disagree, because your such a neato person.  But in my opinion the
thing that is so wonderful about psychedelics  (E & L) is that they tap into
a part of our minds that it is buried so deep inside of us that it is nearly
forgotten. 

 It is unfortunate that our minds are programmed in such a way that this
these feelings of love & tranquility are not immediately accessible.  It's
also unfortunate that the tools that we use to access the buried conscience
can also be very unpredictable.  But the feelings of universal connection &
prenatal consciousness that we feel when we ingest these chemies is
something that it often takes buddhist monks a lifetime to achieve!   This
quick access to the human spirit is what makes these chemies so darned
appealing.

But I have to tell you, the first time I ever took psychedelics, I had an
overwhelming sensation that the feelings I was having were familiar...that I
had been "there" before.  Maybe before I was born...I dunno.  I'm normally
not a kooky type of person and prefer to think that I'm not delusional.  But
I still have a very committed belief that there are things inside my mind
that I would never have contacted in this lifetime without the aid of these
tools.  

I dunno...maybe I'm not giving myself enough credit.  I know that sometimes,
especially with vitamin E, I become discouraged with the falseness of the
experience.  Like, why do I suddenly feel love for someone who I barely know?

I think the answer to this is that we all have a hidden love & connection to
everything in the universe; and in particular, to other human beings, who
are capable of thought and emotion.    We all /want/ to be in contact with
that unconditional love, but the world we live in doesn't allow for it,
because it's complicated by so many other issues.

I dunno.  chemicals are a tricky thing.  But I don't think that psychedlics
"create" feelings.  I think they just allow us to access them quickly.  You
know the old addage..."cleansing the doors of perception" and all that
Huxley crap.

bye!

Hope everyone had a good weekend last week.  This weekend should be 
pretty good too with several choices each night.  I never did get more
info on Bass Heaven so I don't know if it's real.  The Union Jack show
got rescheduled from last week.

The Ward Valley protest (Atomic Butterfly) is something you should know 
about even if you don't go to the event...  As I understand it, the 
federal government and the state of California are pushing to build a 
nuclear waste disposal site at Ward Valley in Southern California.  
There's more info at http://www.moontribe.org/kissbig/Index.html.

Hello netters... 

We will be journeying northward this weekend to SF, hoping to get a
taste of the 604 scene up there, and esp to meet some of you on these
lists in person.  We'll definitely be at the Space Children event on
Friday night, Atomic Butterfly on Sat afternoon, and the Sunset party 
on Sunday (assuming that these are all happening still).  Hopefully, 
there will also be something going on Sat night, and if so, we'll be 
there as well (any 411 would be appreciated).

So, let's hook up somewhere!  Give us a call at 800-539-6860 to get in 
touch with us while we're there.

Btw, I'll most-likely be bringing along my pictures from RTTS1, RTTS2, 
and Burning Man for those that wanna check them out.

Hope to see some of you this weekend!

Andy (who will be with Noah and Ann from SoCal)

Ok, try these on for size:

We associate certain behaviors and emotions with what we see, hear,
feel, ect.  If for example, I feel extremely loved or happy and I touch
or am touched by something and in a certain way (or hear or see), and
this happens repeatedly, then I will associate those feelings with that
scence. When taken into the context of a rave, this becomes very
interesting. When you are at a rave (drugs or no) and your feeling good
or whatever, and you see these people that you see almost exclusively at
a rave, then you associate those good feelings with those people. Think
about the last time you bumped into someone that you 1st met at a rave.
Didn't seeing that person feel especially good? Something like ecstasy
magnifies this. If you feel REALLY good, then you associate feeling
really good with things you see, hear, or feel. Think back to the 1st
time you went to a rave sober after you had tried ecstasy a couple of
times at a rave. Did you feel especially good from the sensory input
that you associated with feelings of ecstasy? The sights, sounds, ect? 

Likewise there is the factor of rapport between two people and what
causes it. Rapport basically means that you and another person somehow
"click" or "connect" in some way. People often refer this to being "on
the same wavelength" with another person. All rapport comes from
communication between people. Yet what we say to a person is only 07% of
our total communication. The rest is through our breathing, our body
posture, our tone of voice, ect. Well, when you think back to what kind
of state and feeling E put you in (your breathing is usually increased,
your pulse is up, your "awake", feeling is enhanced) and think about the
people you are interacting with you who are having the same chemical
infulence as you, it makes scence that you and that other person or
group of people will feel very much "connected" with you and vice versa.

Combine both of these together now. When you think about the FEELING of
ecstasy and how you ASSOCIATE those feelings with whats around you, and
other people around you are FEELING the same way which causes you to
feel CONNECTED with those people; And if youre talking about 100's or
1000's of people potentially, you can see what a truly exceptional
experience one can have at a rave.

Word Up.

just a thought - last time anyone was talking about techno becoming a next
big thing for mainstream music was around 92 or so; Nirvana showed up and
the whole concept was forgotten. I think the same exact thing is going to
happen; some more easily marketed, more rock-like "phenomenon" will show
up somewhere and in six months Spin magazine will be talking about the
amazing newness and hipness of lounge music or noise pop or something.

Hi kids!

Your Uncle Noah will be visiting the northland this weekend to enjoy some 
trance and some other funkiness, along with some SoCal buddies.  I look 
forward to saying hello to a bunch of old friends and meeting some new 
ones!  I'll keep my laminate visible, so come by and say "Hiya!"

*hugs*

-Uncle Noah

I disagree. Personalities are not instantly changeable. Whatever your
actions, whatever you do, no matter how "right" or how "wrong," they are
all reflective of what is contained inside you, what is possible within
you as a person. They may be subdued traits, but they are all part of who
you are as a person. Drugs don't change that. They may highlight or subdue
facets of your personality, but who you are is not something that is
somehow warped while you are not sober. Barring any unusual circumstance,
you are responsible for your state, altered or sober, you choose that, and
you choose how you express that whether it is a concious decision or not.

And that is the whole point: *YOU* believed you were other people or
things while under the influence. Again, it is all within you as a person.

Of course it didn't mean that you were them. But there was empathy, the
understanding of who they were, and what they were going through.

You did not become that perception. If you had become that perception, you
would not have recognized it, because it would have become part of who
you are. You are disproving your own argument by making it.

How? How do we lose ourselves when we take a drug? And don't you think it
is important to define what drug we are taking, that we lose part of
ourselves as a result of? 

> But what we were born with is no longer there.  The chemical balance has

But don't you think your actions define who you are? What drugs you take,
it is all a means of defining yourself(barring addictive personalities.)
Drugs are tools, like many other things. They can be used, misused
or abused, but ultimately the responsibility lies within the user, and how
they have employed them to help define who they are.

However to use this analogy, Anakin proved that he was indeed not dead,
however different ruling factors governed his life for many years.
Ultimately, his actions reflected himself.

>The questions are: Did anyone go to this last year?  

yes. ben and i did. and ben managed to sprain his ankle on friday night, the
night before the parade. bummer! he was bravely limping after the trucks all
day, trying to keep up. 

>Is it only a techno
>festival, or is it more of a huge mass carnival/party? 

yes. yes. last year it was 90 % techno. german techno, which i found
incredibly monotonous. there was  some jungle, tho.
on the day (saturday) it's a huge parade with hundreds of trucks with sound
systems rolling at snail pace down from the victory column to the
brandenburg gate and back. people tend to follow their favorite trucks -
bouncing and dancing along. great fun. be prepared to be trampled to death
by the masses occassionally. it's gonna be at least a million people. and
try to stay clear of cops (there's gonna be as many of them as there are
ravers), german cops have no sense of humour. 

BTW, it is legal to carry certain small amounts of dope (the amount depends
on which part of germany you're in). it is not holland, however! 

> I can't tell
>whether it's a contained "mega-rave", or an excuse for all of Europe's

again: yes. yes. yes. there will be a lot of non-ravers too who are just
there for....hmm...don't really know...maybe they are ravers by the time
they leave.

it would be good to arrive a few days beforehand because it really starts on
wednesday or thursday in the clubs (check out east berlin for cool
underground stuff). there will be non-stop music in berlin from wednesday to
monday night. most things are really expensive, tho, and if you go to a club
every night it quickly adds up. drugs were also slightly more expensive than
normal. we once paid DM 30 for a pill! 

don't forget to sample german chocolate!
if i remember something else useful i'll let you know.

****TROY, PLEASE POST THIS FOR ME   AND THANKS FOR MAKING ME AWARE OF THE
ISSUES*****



Hello SF Raves!  My name is Kc.  I am the author of "How Much Do You Love
Raving: a handbook for responsible raving."  It was basically solely my
project, but I had a lot of insight and perspective from long-time ravers
whose opinions I greatly respect.

I just wanted to clarify (not defend mind you) a few things about myself
and the booklet:

- I'm not a professional promoter.  I am intimately involved with the DUNE
projects as a producer and art director... I wouldn't really call any of us
in DUNE promoters and ESPECIALLY not professional promoters.  I didn't
write it for any professional reason. I have been raving/clubbing for 14
years and I just couldn't let what is such a large part of my life become
despicable.

- I wrote the booklet 1 year ago after our second chapter of DUNE when
HardCopy took something that 1800 people thought was pure and wonderful and
turned it into something totally corrupt and evil.  I know that all of the
footage wasn't of DUNE and I also understand that HardCopy makes its' money
making that sort of distortion, but I was still very hurt.

My first inclination was to lash out at HC, which I did for a while until I
realized that without a massive (read expensive) legal effort, nothing
could be changed.  I tried to discover what could have been done to prevent
such a tragedy. The answer was very clear to me.  They didn't need to
change, WE needed to change THEIR perceptions of us... and thus was born
the concept for the booklet.

- The booklet is very clear about its' intent which is simply... small
changes in individuals' attitude and behavior can make a tremendous
difference in other peoples' perception of us.

- Yes, it was intended specifically for L.A. but it is being very well
received in a great number of cities in the U.S. and abroad (even in
Bosnia!).  I believe that in the booklet are little bits of truth that
apply to everyone in every community. (This includes myself)

- Yes, the booklet is all about hard realities and could be viewed as being
"negative" BUT it is purely constructive in it's approach... which is VERY
positive.  You can preach PLUR until you are blue in the face but many
people will never make a practical application of it.  In other words,
there are many people that have to have it explained to them that "RESPECT
means 'don't spray paint the bathroom wall.'"

- Please remember that the people who spend time on lists such as SF and SC
Raves are not the biggest culprits... but you can't help but preach to the
choir when you're trying to reach those other people. It is lists such as
this which CAN make the difference, though.  We are blessed with a forum
that encourages discussions such as this.  But most are not as fortunate.
Share the wealth through communication with those who aren't online.


I don't want to take any more of your time... I've heard what a commitment
it is to read through SF Raves everyday.

I encourage those who feel the booklet is incomplete, impractical or
out-of-line to produce your own.  I warn you, though, that 1) it takes much

Hi-

Did anybody look up at the moon last night?  There was this cool circle of
light that was around it.  It looked like a big halo of some type.  If
anybody knows what it was, tell me, I'm interested.

It has to do with the moisture in the air and living next to the ocean 
so my landlord tells me. It never used to happen when i lived in 
Colorado. Remember the full moon in January, the night of Gaia Mind-- It 
happened then too only it was much bigger. Yes my dear it is an 
incredible wonder. smiles! --debbie

hi there...  Some of you may know me from the Trance and Jungle Factory.

Fact is...I still haven't found a home, or even a room, since I came up from
So cal to help open the store.   But... I have an oppurtunity to house sit
for three weeks in April and I was wondering if anyone had a place they were
abandoning for a week or two until then...Like if you were going skiing in
Tahoe for the SPRING BREAK or maybe Florida for the Winter Music Conference,
or maybe Mexico or some thing else that sounds a whole lot more interesting
then work or study...

Please e-mail back if you have a CLUE....  Otherwise I'll be seeing you all
this weekend at the Ward Valley Protest at the Federal Center... MOONTRIBE
has the greatest vibe and they are joined with some people that will make
this a memorable event for sure.   And for such a good cause!

CHEERS!!
Greta

Go to UNION JACK at the maritime. This will be killer.

the info line is:

415-273-1622
510-461-7722

It's $15 at the door all night. 

Since it was cancelled last week I think it will be twice as good. I hope
the vibe is twice as would have been last week. My friend is coming up
from LA and she's so excited.

I just called Upstairs Records in NY, the ostensible promoter of this
show.  (see the SFRaves calender)

They've never head of it.

So, unless there's another upstairs records somewhere, I'm starting to
think that... well...  I just wouldn't hold my breath.


It's also very odd to me that a massive (and "Only 2500 presales for $15" 
definitely indicates a massive) would be so nonpromoted:  no flyers, no
number, no nuthin'. 

I'm thinkin' it's all about Ceridwen tonite.

The most amazing thing about 'the love parade' is the fact that Berlin
as a city is willing to let those crazy youths come from all over and
basically take over.....its amazing to see so many people just roaming
the streets ,partying, and the polizei (sp?) just standing around with
smiles....there is no place like that here in the states.....

as for the actual parade i was glad to have experienced it but i dont
put it on the top of my ravin experiences....as someone posted the music
is well german hardcore....its great to see 3000 people surrounding just
one truck jumping all around half naked to 200bpms but its not quite my
taste.....I only saw one truck with a d&b dj.....but then again maybe a
lot has changed.

the parties that happen during the days and nights around the parade I
think are more the attraction....then you can really find a party that
will suit your taste...either parties of thousands or lil UGs.....


...the funniest was going to a party sponsored by Marlboro "friends of
energy dancers"....


The love parade isnt the only one to check out....Last summer I knew of
at least 4 other parades with attendance in the thousands....so you
could be doing this all summer if you wanted...

i'm jealous...but then again i still havent financially recovered from
that trip ;(

There's an Upstairs Records (record shop) in Downtown San Jose. I wonder if
they're throwing it? It's a DJ shop, so it's possible. I'll see if I can find
something out. This party will be tha BOMB if it's for real.

Just contacted the San Jose Upstairs Records people.

They don't have anything to do with it either, and say that they were
mistakenly associated with the show. 

They don't know anything about it other then that.

Subject: Ward Valley Gathering & Protest in SF

Precedence: bulk

This March 1997, on Saturday the 22nd, there will be a Ward
Valley/Environmental Gathering. This will be a gathering of peaceful
protest, music, culture, dance and idea. We must all attend this gathering!
Tell everyone you know! If you need a ride, post a message! Let us spread
the electronic transmission! Please help us spread the word! This gathering
will be held at 450 Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco. (There is public
parking at PUBLIC CENTER PARKING located 1 block south of Golden Gate @
Larkin.)

Children, Coming together and dancing with one another is one of the most
healing activities we, as members of the tribe can do. It is way past our
time to come together, what does it mean to come together? It means viewing
each one of your fellow human beings as a child of light just as you are.
We are all equally beautiful and we are all doing the best we can given the
knowledge we have. The planet we live on is screaming for help. You can see
it in the air, you can hear it in the songs of the animals, you can feel it
in the ground. There is no more time for war, for destruction. For if we
would like our children to survive we must change our ways immediately. The
answer is not easy,
but together as a group it will come. It may come from the wisdom of a
child, or from silent meditation. Now if we are focusing our energy the
collective consciousness of our souls, we will be giving earth the
necessary energy she neds to survive the constant bombarding of negative
energy from disillusioned humans.

Children, it is up to us! If not us then who will? No one! WE MUST COME
TOGETHER. Currently our brothers and sisters are gathering strong
worldwide, the negative chain that has been put on our families is
breaking! Remember your mother. Mother Earth has provided everything for
us. May the children of the planet Earth come together and dance to the
song of life.

Always maintain the vision - it cannot be done alone. There is a reason
this message was written. And there is a reason you are reading it. There
is a reason you were put on this planet at this time. And that reason has
been forgotten. Let us remember, remember why we are here.

For more information about the Kissbig Collective, the location of the
event, times, and the DJ performer lineup, checkout the site:

Get involved, make a difference, and remember to love each other and Mother
Earth. Hope to see you there.

 Ahh, but the fear is : there *will* be.
 
 I dont normally get into holy wars (esp ones about keeping out others...
 would make me feel republican :-).  I just feel the need to insert the
 following morsel of wisdom (presented in haiku for your reading pleasure).
 
 Its been Seven years
 First time said : "They are coming!"
 Hasn't happened yet >>

I know my response is a bit delayed, but I'm sure frat boys have showed up,
realized it's not a pick-up meat market scene and decided they wanted to keep
on going to clubs, where they can get drunk and pick up on girls wearing next
to nothing because they wanta shake their booty all, umm, three hours long.

If a frat boy comes into the scene, he will stay if his  vibe is right.  If
his vibe does not mesh well with 'ours', he will leave.  No offence taken.
If he stays, he is no longer a frat boy.
He is one of 'us'.
just a qweschun (for those of you who can't sound out words: question :)) to
pose to all of you, have you eveer known/been a frat boy turned "raver"?
C'mon, no one will look down on you, because you have changed and have become
one of 'us'. 
frat boy includes: frat boys; sorority girls; jocks.
so, ya know, anyone introduced to the scene will turn into a 'sceneter' or
they will just leave the vibe alone.
Well, that's how I see it at least.
smiles:)

drugs can provide you with a different perspective.
doesn't 'doors of perception' refer to the 'door' between the two brain
hemispheres that hallucinogenic drugs opens? brain activity is very much
higher on lsd than normal. and as far as i know it is the body-own chemicals
that are released by taking drugs that get you high and _expand your mind_. 
please don't quote me on any of that scientific stuff. i don't know if that
goes for every drug.

>I think the answer to this is that we all have a hidden love & connection to
>everything in the universe; and in particular,

yes, we just normally approach everything with suspicion and fear because of
bad experiences in the past or because of the news on tv. we protect
ourselves by not opening up to someone until we know them well. the fear of
being hurt (again) makes us mistrust people we don't know anything about and
shouldn't really judge right away. on e we can experience and give this love
that is inside of us because the barrier is dropped. just taking it once is
enough to show us that this is possible.

>I dunno.  chemicals are a tricky thing.  

i think what's worrying is the stuff drugs get stretched with.

Im a scientist (or at least, I pretend to be) so I know what the answer to
this question is (in other words, get ready for a whole bunch o' hooey) :

Princess of the Moon
Sends thanks to her Loyal Friends
Sailor Moon Returns

In other words, it was Princess Serena thanking us for returning Sailor
Moon to the airwaves in the US.  See
http://looney.physics.sunysb.edu/~daffy/sos/
for details.

Sorry but I just *had* to express my happiness over this!

I suppose I can comment on this "frat boy" issue....

My progression was raver>frat boy>raver. 

You always come back to what you love, right...:)
I was a raver before I went to college, then turned 21 and spent a few
years in the disgusting depths of college life known as the greek
system....ack. (hindsight is always 20:20, right?) 
anyway, yeah..after I turned 21 I spent 2 years wrapped in a flannel
shirt drowning in the bottom of a Jack Daniels bottle..
then I recovered and got back to my raving roots...I'm so much healthier
and happier now. I had moved from SF to Boulder, CO for college...when I
first moved there the scene was whack (imho) so I ended up falling into
the folds of the geek system (not a typo...heehee) 
I dropped the geek system my sophomore year, was a total clubhead my
junior year...and got fed up with the music they played at the one or
two decent clubs in Denver...too much diva/hi-nrg/housey house..I am a
techno head thru and thru..no 303-none for me...(giggle)....so I had to
find UGs for the solid tunes, right?? Well, at the same time I was
seriously cutting down on my drinking cause I'm also a mountain biker
and was doing alot of training...suddenly I found myself back in front
of the speakers at 5am buggin' out and loving every single thump thump
tweet tweet thump  of it!! :)  
I truly felt reborn....then I went to Europe and had a wonderful
experience in London raving with my roomate (right Jeff? :) ) who hadn't
really been properly introduced to ravEing...since then I've been back
into the groove stronger than ever.... I could go on, and on... but I'll
save it.
cheers!

ha...you're obviously no scientist...everyone knows that the circles
around the moon are the exhauste fumes from UFO's. These aliens
that live on the moon have the best raves and fly their ships around
 the moon ... skywriting to let us know its time to party

Just a little anecdote to go along with this thread:

When Ram Dass (formerly Richard Alpert) first travelled to India he 
brought with him a bottle of "White Lightening", a very pure batch of LSD 
he had had specially made.  When he first met his guru, Maharaji, the man 
asked for some of this 'medicine'.  Ram Dass gave him a tablet but 
Maharaji wanted more than one.  He swallowed three of the tablets, which 
was 915 micrograms (a normal dose is between 100-200 micrograms), and 
just sat there with a twinkle in his eye.  Ram Dass was with Maharaji for 
several hours and nothing happened!  Maharaji was living in a constant 
state complete clarity and understanding, so his perception was unaffected.

As Ram Dass later said of the incident, "When you're in Detroit, you 
don't need to take the bus to get to Detroit."  ;-)


love,
brett

PS.  For those who don't know, Ram Dass has recently had a stroke, but is 
recovering.  For more info check out:

Kay, so it's friday afternoon at about 3:30pm
I am watching gargoyles (a good show if you have never seen it)
Now, I just wanted to say something for you all to ponder.

When you are high, do you  ever notice how stuff that is bright and fun to
play with stands out??? Yanno, playdoh, kooshballs, big squishy soft stuft
animals. Do you remember how when you were a small child, all that stuff
totally entranced you?? When you are high, can you sit and play with a piece
of playdoh for hours and hours at a time??? Do you remember being a child and
playing with a piece of playdoh for hours and hours???

Well, I guess the point I am trying to make, is that maybe when we are
children, we are in a state of being high all the time, but do not realize
it.
~~~Of course, we all could just be regressing to our childhood when we are
high.
Just a thought I thought I'd share with some other kids:)
'kay. bye bye.
smiles:)

I called Doc Martin at home. He and his wife have already left LA, but
their housemate didn't think they were coming to SF, rather they were going
to the Winter Music Conference in Miami.

We'll just have to see how this thing plays out... (but I won't be there) :-)

 But don't you think that it reflects a facet of your personality? Sober or

yes, but still, i do not think drugs make you who you are. They are, as i
believe, a doorway, not a pathway.
The reflection is just a part of who you are and was there even before you
tried drugs.

Oh, I absolutely agree. They do not make who you are, although they can
show you things that you normally would not see. Rather that experience is
"real" or not is something that cannot easily be decided without a solid
view of the "big picture."

Hello. 

Just wanted to let you all know that there's party going on Saturday night
that you all should be interested in attending.

It's called Baubo's Belly, and it's a $5 benefit for the Funk Works dance
studio in Emeryville.

The lineup will be short but very very sweet:

Solar
Monty

Playing Electronic Instruments:  Technique Meets Technology

   Mark Goldstein

ABSTRACT:

The advent of electronic music changed the way composers and listeners
work with and relate to sound. Since the initial efforts in this form
were taped pieces, sonic sculptures crafted out of real time, the notion
of performer was irrelevant. Today, a wide variety of commercial
synthesizers are available and new real time synthesis techniques from
the computer music laboratories are becoming available. Most of these
synthesizers and algorithms can be controlled from arbitrary input
devices. The piano keyboard has been a ubiquitous front end for all
sorts of sounds, many of them not pianistic at all. It is also not
unusual to see a computer on stage with an electronic ensemble. Quite
often the audience cannot understand the effects of the computer
player's actions. I am interested in broadening the possibilities for
performing electronics, investigating the relationship between gesture
and sound,  and regaining a sense of instrumental virtuosity in the
electronic genre.

Music is a performing art, and part of the quality of the musical
experience comes from the relationship between the player's physical
technique and the sound that is produced. A player can feel this
intimately. A listener can appreciate this connection visually (and
viscerally) whether in a live concert or in the mind's eye while
listening to a recorded performance.

Our rich tradition of musical instruments has created a repertoire of
gestures (bowing, blowing, banging, etc.) that are closely tied to
familiar sounds. Can these gestures be appropriated to control new sorts
of sounds? Are there other forms of movement that are musically
effective? I have been exploring these questions using a MalletKAT (an
electronic marimba) and Buchla Lightning Wands (a pair of wireless
infrared wands broadcasting to a 2-D tracking sensor that also performs
gesture recognition). I will trace the development of electronic music
and its performance practices, demonstrate a variety of empty-handed and
hybrid electronic instruments, and perform a piece for Lightning solo,
"Joan is Back," by Bay Area composer Silvia Mateus.

We are between Page Mill Road (west of Foothill Expressway) and Hillview
Avenue, in the Stanford Research Park.  The easiest way here is to get
onto Page Mill Road, and turn onto Coyote Hill Road.  As you drive up
Coyote Hill past the horse pastures, PARC is the large building on the

I am inclined to agree here.  I know a lot of people think that drugs create
feelings that are not there, cause you to behave in ways that you would not
normally behave, thus causing them to feel that drugs are causing unnatural
reactions in ourselves.  But sometimes I really think that drugs are causing
us to shed behavior that is very learned, very much taught to us by
society/parents/whatever, behavior patterns that are so ingrained in us as
to feel like normal behavior but really are not the way we were born
believing and behaving.  When the susicpicion one normally feels for
strangers suddenly falls away because we've taken e, yes maybe it's a rather
artificial way to cause that behavior, but I consider the removed behavior
in & of itself to be artificial as well.  I was not born with the fears I
live my everyday life with.  I was not born treating those around me like
shit when I can't handle my own personal issues.  I was not born with
personal issues.  I was born (I believe) curious about the world around me,
wanting to play and laugh, and love the people who were with me, I was born
loving music, I was born wanting to throw my arms around those I love, and I
was born dancing.  I remember a party I went to about a year ago (anybody
remember that Basics party they threw at the bowling alley last year? :) and
to this day I remember the feeling I got from that party.  I and several
others were on e, and it struck me how natural our behavior was, to hug and
kiss and talk and be together simply for the sake of being together.  It
felt so familiar to me, like I could tell at that moment that this behavior
for me seemed like something I'd been born with, had lost along the way from
negative experiences, societal expectations, or parents' fears being taught
to me.  It was the most natural thing in the world, and I felt like after
having lost it, I'd rediscovered it once again, come back around full circle
to the way I was meant to be from the beginning, rather than my normal
fear-based behavior of regular life.  And that discovery has carried into my
normal life.  I live my life very differently than I did two years ago.  So
much more of my behavior and the way I choose to lead my life is love-based
rather than fear-based (and I still struggle to make this change, always
will), which to me will make or break whether or not I consider myself to
have lived a worthwhile life when I die.  
And I also do not think that e makes me feel love for people I don't
normally love.  However, I do believe it encourages me to treat people with
love, and shows me more clearly often times my love for the people I really
do love.  And sometimes e creates a connection with a person that disappears
when the party's over ("just an e thing"), and even that is okay.  Sometimes
a connection happens only once, connections often happen because there is
something in common between the two of you, and sometimes that something in
common happens to be a hit of e.  Take it  for what it's worth, get
everything you can out of it.  I have had very memorable one-time
experiences with people I never saw again, but I still remember them, and
just to have remembered that experience is enough to change me just a
little.  Also bear in mind that it's possible that the "just an e thing"
connection could be very real, and would have continued into normal life,
except that once the e wears off, the normal fear-based behavior sets back
in and destroys a connection that can only exist in that non-fear-based
environment.  Ever find yourself being just a little afraid to talk to that
person you had that connection with because you're afraid it was "just an e
thing", or wonder what you could talk about while not on e?  Perhaps if you
could shed those fears for a little longer, that connection would remain
intact.  Of course that's not to say that every little e connection would
last longer every time, cuz there will always be one-time shots, drug
induced or not, but it would definitely improve on matters imo if that
artificial fear-based behavior weren't such a factor.
And one other thing for me.  Drugs always give me a new way to see old
things, always give me a different perspective than the one I'm used to
seeing.  *Anything* that gives me new perspectives with which to view the
world around me will give me a better, more complete view of the big
picture, and that is a good thing.

Anyway, enough rambling!  

Love
Shawna

I think that you are right in both situations.  I think that when 
you are a child you ARE in a different state than, let's say, adults 
are.  That is becuase kids don't have any responsibilities.  All kids
have to REALLY worry about is the rivalry that exists (The ultimate 
battle of the sexes and the ART of "PLAYING!!!!!!!").
When we get older, more responsibility are put onto our shoulders and 
the playing aspect of life begings to weaking, or even pause for some.  
Smoking pot could bring a person to many different states though.  When
I am high, I am in my own world and thinking weird and detailed thoughts.
Other times I get in deep discussions about "why the human race is here"
:):):).
And even other times, when I feel like being a dumb ass with my friends, I
just
laugh at the world around me. 
Anyways, I dont think that "pot" brings you to your inner child, but rather
the choice of the individual of what level you want to travel within
yourself.  
Take that last sentance and apply it mostly any drug. 

Drugs.....people should learn from.  I have a friend who takes drugs... for
what?
He doesn't learn anything from each time. For example,  When I took "E" for
the
first time. It was the most amazing experience of my life (that was also
the first
time I went to a rave) I had my Awsome friends around me sharing this
incredible 
experience. I saw everyone's beauty come out and onto the surface. After that 
experience, I carried that feeling with me wherever I go.  I don't rave a
lot, but
when I do, I try my hardest to enjoy the vibe and enjoy the people. MY drug
experience
has been a learning experience and the learning aspect of it all
was my decision. I CHOSE to put myself in that mind set.  

I hope this aswers you question :)!!!!

I've heard that people have done EEG (or EKG?) studies on babies, and on
the brains of adults on LSD, and seen very, very similar brain traces.
Which makes sense on all kinds of levels to me.

Marijuana, like so many other drugs, has different effects on different
people at different times. One day, it might make you really "stupid", and
all you do is laugh. The next day/week/month/whatever, you might do nothing
but ponder upon the great questions of life. It's all about how you go into
the high.
Take acid for example. If you have a bad day, and you're feeling down,=
 chances
are you'll have a REALLY bad trip. But if you're happy and totally looking
forward to that trip, it will most likely be a good one. =3D)

But just like she said, it's all about the situation and your attitude. A
few of my friends have gone to raves, done E, and simply expected something
marvelous to happen. Of course, sometimes it doesn't. If YOU don't give the
drug YOUR positive side, how can you expect the drug to give its positive
side to you?

Well folks, I'm off to prepare for my ELM tomorrow. If you have room, please
pray for me... ;)

        Sure, but drugs can enhance one side of you while suppressing
another, effectively turning you into a different person. None of us is
entirely one thing, we all have a combination of counterbalancing traits -
and it's the total balance of all these traits that makes up our personality.

	Seeing somebody's lovey side come out is nice, but if that 
side is totally shut down by anger or inhibition when they're not on 
some drug, then the drug really is turning them into someone else.
And if it's not a drug that they can just stay on indefinitely, then
that isn't going to be who they "really" are.

The one thing that came to mind when I read this, is that when most 
people take LSD, they end up discovering a lot of things, about the world 
and themselves (usually whether that was the intent or not).  Babies are 
in a constant state or realization and discovery.  <shrug>  I see the 
connection. =)

Well, LSD's commonly held to "open the doors of perception"--to make you
aware of all kinds of sensory input that you're not normally aware of--
to break down the perceptual filters that you've built up, and blow your
mind with thoughts and visions and impressions that you ordinarily
block out.  Babies don't _have_ any of those filters or doors yet.  They
process everything raw; they haven't learned to block it all out.  So
they loll their heads around and always have a totally stoned look on
their face.  The wide-eyed innocent look of a novice tripper and of a
young baby look awfully similar to me....

So it makes sense that there's some objective correlation between their
brain states.  IMHO, anyway.

So after 3 choices, and two hours of wait, I finally narrowed my night down
to Space Children.  Had to see Dutch and Surge!

I only stayed for part of the party, since I have to work in the morning,
so here's what I thought:

Surge opened it up, totally brought me back to the Surge sounds that I
remember so well, before he left about 6 months ago.  Excellent set, and
had good energy to open up the party.

Dutch played next, and took me to the "next" level with his style that I
*always* love.  Dutch has never disappointed me, ever since I first saw him
back in the Recycle days.  Great days @ The Stone & 16th * Harrison.  

Finally, I only stuck around for the live act Baktun 13 (correct?).  I give
*much* props to the guys on the conga and the drums.  Short set, but sweet.
 

So . . . missed Graeme and Union Jack.  Somebody tell me how their sets
went, since I couldn't stick around.

O.K., I'm zoned out, and need sleep, 
Peace, Bill

party was small, like 300-500 people.  Music was ok until Ron D. Core
started, then it was amazing!!!!  He was totally tearing it apart with his
major hardcore set. Totally awesome!!!!  Then it got shut down at 2:30 or so
only 30 minutes into Ron's set, I was really mad when that happend.  I did
however love the 30 minutes of hardcore up here in S.F. while it lasted.  Not
a lot of people liked it, a lot of the people there went home during the set
like 15-20 minutes of it.  I don't know how many  people would of been left
after his 2 hour set.  It was REALLY AMAZING!!!!  If you missed out, I'm
sorry :-(  Anyway I hope to see all of you tomorrow at the protest at the
federal building!!  Just my input for method 6!

I went too Cloud Factory with my freind Matt(SmUrF)lst wknd,had the
time of my life!  Thanks for the sfraves necklace things Orson.  Whats
up April.  I must give props too Micro, I literally danced till I
fainted on his set.  Ohh yah, even though some people were smoking some
pot on the main floor I must say that the smokeless rule made the
atmosphere much more tolerable.  What the hell was up with the gang
shit, I was out-side when it happend; pretty scary.

Sorry to post an unhappy note to this happy group, just gotta get this 
off my chest.

My freind from LA and I drove from Santa Cruz to hear the legendary 
sounds of Ron D Core, whom before I had only heard tapes of.  The whole 
scene was strrange: the woman taking my money nearly had a fit, saying 
the twenty I had gotten from the ATM was fake, because it was old and 
didn't have a magnetic strip.  Did they do this to everyone?  Was it a 
money-making scheme they started because they were empty?  Oh well.

Seconds after we walked in, we were kicked out by security who assumed 
we were part of a drug deal.  I tried to talk to him, but he had it 
fixed in his mind that my friend was selling drugs. (Which he was not)

Poop.  Someday, someday we'll see Ron.  What a was to spend the Equinox.

Man oh man.... I've never heard Ron D. Core before....  talk about an
adrenalin rush!!!
About the music he was playing...  is that what is considered "hardcore
techno" ?
Love that "F--k You" song... and then when he played "We want some
p---y"... that was kewl....

I haven't felt such a rush since my speed metal "caught in a mosh"
days...
To tell ya the truth, I didn't know whether to stand there and bob my
head at eighty miles an hour, or jump up and down, or start a mosh
pit....  how is someone suppposed to dance to that???

Too bad about the small turn out... and did anyone else get an attitude
by the woman taking the money???  It was like my money wasn't good
enough or something...

Oh yeah... once again, Ghost turned it out....  =)

And it is just too bad that the cops had to shut it down at 2:30... I
noticed a lot of people who were just too messed up to be on the streets
driving... 

And that's the way I saw it....  
Peace

In response to several requests, I have set up a digest version of
SFRaves.  Using this, you'll get one large chunk of messages every 25
messages or so, which should mean about 1-2 per day.  It's all the same
content, there's no moderation going on or anything, people just sometimes
prefer it this way. 

If you want to change your subscription to that, send a message to
majordomo@hyperreal.com with the following commands:

  unsubscribe sfraves
  subscribe sfraves-digest

and all should be swell.

worried, at first, that I would hate the party, because the security
guards outside gave off a really nasty vibe.  They totally embarassed us
when we were walking in.  One of them stopped us, then turned to another
security guard and said something along the lines of, "Look at those
clothes!  Have you ever seen anything like that before in your life?" 
Then a bunch of them started laughing.  As a result, I hated that party
before I even walked in.

We finally got inside and found a place to hide our coats.  We stood up
to take a look around, and realized that we were standing right next to
some of our friends.  Immediately I felt better!  To celebrate, I took
out two big bags of assorted candy and started handing it out to all the
people sitting on the floor.  Everyone who I gave candy to was really
nice.

I'm not used to big parties, so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  I'm
really glad it turned out well, though.

I'd like to thank the promoters for being so nice to me and I'd really
like to thank all the people I met who gave me hugs (not very many people
there were into hugging) and stickers and candy.

My apologies to Space Children for thinking I wouldn't like the party.  I
was wrong--I'll make sure never to judge a party by it's security guards
again ;-)

Love and kisses to all (even those "oh-so-friendly" security guards),

                   			---Libby Rose :-)

Well, I shared your post with your good-ol'-pal Candyraver Kermit (now
Cracked-Out Elmo) and he says, "WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING???" But, I
guess it's just another example of why the small parties are better.  Now you
look back at Cloud Factory... Lordie... That was fun... I will have to write
my review after this... Late as it may be... I had loads of fun...

So we got the gang together (we being that crazy Elmo guy Matt, who no longer
wants to be known as Kermit anymore... Now he's cracked-out elmo) in Matt's
nice rental Blazer... Since the poor boy CRASHED his car... It'll be back.

Turns out that the tickets had sold out before a couple of our friends got
there... Somehow they got in anyhow... I have no idea how, but it's all good.
 We got there, and the first thing I have to say is that the parchutes were
cool, but my poor antennas kept hitting them!  That's ok thought, I had a
basket full of candy and a new dress care of my sweetheart Matt.

So the night began... Lots of fun... I got to take my little brother (& his
girlfriend) and sister. They had a blast. I got to pass out candy... Someone
called me the Little Candy Princess from Outer Space... It was great.

So, I got to dance with all the little girls... And my boyfriend (that crazy
shit) introduced me to EVERYONE he could get his hands on... hehe... Hope
 you all liked me dress...

And as for the afterparty of oh.... 60 or so people in my tiny tiny
apartment... (I said that he'd take full resposibility all Matt says is,
"oops") I apologize for the chaotic state of the apartment.  We were all in a
hurry to leave before the party, and I NEVER expected that I would have that
many people in our apartment the next morning... Maybe a couple friends...
Next time... Things will be different. If the management doesn't kick us out
first.

So... to all involved... will there be a Warmth on March 1st or so next
year... You know that will be the year anniversary that Matt and me met...
And don't worry... You'll all be invited to the wedding... hehehehe... I'll
take resposibility for  that one, baby... *wink*

Rave on! And love to all! Especially my Matthew!

That crazy little raver girlie with antennas....

I have been to Space Children as well. 
HELP!

I arrive: Tadpoles on Adidas! It seems going to a rave is more about what
you wear than the music. Yes, security sucked big time. 

The music I heard (the 15min I stayed) was fine. But what was I glad when 
Lindsay at the door could tell me how to get to China Basin. 
That event saved the night! Best rave this week/month.

Regards
Jan

   Has anyone ever seen this miraculous novelty?  They look and act just like
regular glycerin bubbles, and yet they are actually flavored candy.  These
were first introduced to me by a someone I met while away for the weekend.
 We spent much time in a group discovering uses for candy bubbles.  They were
lots of fun, and I think they'd be great to take to a party, but there's a
problem.  
     So far this weekend, I've been to numerous toy stores in search of these
edible bubbles, with no luck.  I can't find a single store that carries them.
 Does anyone know where I can purchase them, or know of a company that
manufactures them?  It would help me (and my many other friends that are
searching for them) out a tremendous bunch.  THank you so much!!

       hugs,

had other things to take care of (like going to work to pay rent), but for
the short time I was there I really enjoyed it. Who was that DJ playing
the "environmental" track if annyone knows? never felt that comfortable in
front of the federal building(yes I have been there before for not so
plesent reasons), who is going to that ward valley gathering apr 25th-

I thought this was one of the best parties I've been to in a while. 
Personally, it was fantastic and the music was perfect.

My friend from LA come up and she had a blast. It was her first time to   
the city and first time to a rave. And first time on LSD. ;-)

I felt soo good at 3am I wanted to start handing out my energy to all of
those who were tired and feeling any negativity.

I loved the hand-holding ending of it all. That just proved that Space
Children is true to us all.

We are Space Children.

Well, first of all I'll get the negative stuff out of the way. The cost was
$25 and drinks were $2.50. So already you have a good chunk of money
invested. These raves are getting expensive.

The good stuff, though, would be this is some of the best damn music I've
heard in a long time. I never left the main floor and just tripped to the
amazing spins of Jon Bishop (he was incredible), Carlos (who put on a sweet
set and some of his kick ass scratch), and Kwashi & Essence (they brought the
crowd home). I spent the whole time up front (I was in a white shirt with red
stripes on the sleeves in case you were up there). This was the release I had
been looking for since I have not raved for about three weeks. What a nice
feeling! And I met some incredibly smiley people which is sooooo nice. And
the club ... it was jacked up in lights and those figures on the ceiling are
trippy.

By the way, I just bought DJ Micro's CD Coast to Coast and can't believe how
sweet it is. Does anyone have any additional suggestions for CDs that have
this type of energy? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

peace and joy,
Carl

The party went off!

The Spacechildren's Evening with Union Jack was by far the 
fattest party I've ever been to.  Yeah the security guards
were kind of sketch on the way in... but once inside the vibe
was really there--- caesars was a great location, and the djs
and groups were incredible.  BakTun13 (sp?) were stunning...
and Union Jack was unbelieveable!  Everyone was really
into it-people were actually enjoying themselves!  The Bass
was great (thanks for the smiles hugs and energy to the
guys hanging around the bass tower stage left with me-you
were all inspring! And thanks to the guy for what he said afterwards
up on the stage-he was really right-the sound was gone but
the energy was still there-and now its up to us to take the vibe
to the rest of the world, in whatever we do..

The Spacechildren really did a great job!  Keep the vibe goin!

And I hear rumors of a Spacechildren & Seismic party being thrown down
here on May 2nd (San Luis Obispo) 4 rooms!?!  Chocolate Factory?
Sounds like a killer lineup.... Anyone know more?

Keep the vibe

So after 3 choices, and two hours of wait, I finally narrowed my night down
to Space Children.  Had to see Dutch and Surge!

I only stayed for part of the party, since I have to work in the morning,
so here's what I thought:

Surge opened it up, totally brought me back to the Surge sounds that I
remember so well, before he left about 6 months ago.  Excellent set, and
had good energy to open up the party.

Dutch played next, and took me to the "next" level with his style that I
*always* love.  Dutch has never disappointed me, ever since I first saw him
back in the Recycle days.  Great days @ The Stone & 16th * Harrison.  

Finally, I only stuck around for the live act Baktun 13 (correct?).  I give
*much* props to the guys on the conga and the drums.  Short set, but sweet.
 

So . . . missed Graeme and Union Jack.  Somebody tell me how their sets
went, since I couldn't stick around.

O.K., I'm zoned out, and need sleep, 
Peace, Bill

Hay there SFrave Kiddies!!
the ward valley protest ROCKED!!
all the buildings in the area were bouncin and jigglin to the beats
even the cop-eroonies couldn't stand still (although they remained in
perma-frown status)
At one occasion, we were told we'd have to go away, because some of the more
daring kids were on the stairs (OH NO!!)*chuckle*, and just a few times the
music stopped... BUT when it did, the drummers kept the beat, and everyone
helped with some killer vocals, and the rave *NEVER* stopped!!!!! :) 
(except for some wonderful words for the Ward Valley Protest)
The vibe was exellent.
The dog kept trying to steal some donuts, and (HORAY) was given one to eat
all to himself...
i met ravers from LA, from Chicago, from Illinois, but i didn't meet, not
even ONE, from SFRaves... :) where were you guys?? 
It was a beautiful occasion, even the heavens approved, when they could have
cried, and rained on the *shiver* uncovered equipment, the sky just held the
rain...
What a great day... 
and the evening?? THAT is a *totally* DIFFERENT story.. :)

I'm not usually a list whiner, but everytime I see DRC in a heading I can't
help but think of DJ DRC/Darcy.  I dig that people are forewarning of drug
discussions in their messages, but is their an alternative that doesn't
confuse people and create  unassociated associations?

Like how about use the codeword  "Jondabomb" to warn listees of sketchy topics?

Okay, that was a joke.:o) I dunno.  Maybe it's not a big deal.  Anyone have
any suggestions?

 o  DRT (drug related topics)
 o  DOPECON (dope conversation)
 o  DMT (dope mentioned therein) & for the nondopers:(Dope Mentioned,Trash.)
 o  LSD (let's suggest dope)
  
okay, I'm running low on fuel.

See you later, alligators.

I'll make this short and to the point , , ,  once again, the 1st Sunset of
the year ROCKED! 
I really enjoy the first and last Sunsets- they are the ones that bring out
the most positive vibes in everyone.  Not a frown from anyone around, and
the vibe was so thick, you couldn't cut it with a knife.  
It was really great to be back outdoors with the fresh air, smiles, and old
faces you hadn't seen in a while.
I even took a friend took his first outdoor -------> enjoyed it a lot, and
felt a lot more comfortable than being indoors.
San Francisco, California- need we say more?!

I was only there for John Howard and Galen --------> much props for
delivering such beautiful sets  :-}

Later, Bill
p.s.- Hey Ethan, Jondabomb!

Does anyone else mind that the SFR list is displayed at the Trance and 
Jungle Factory?  I mean, if a party wants to be advertised, they'll print 
flyers right?  Will this make it so that any party that wants to be at 
all UG will not get posted here?  nooooooooooo (BTW, I realize small 
parties already don't get posted up)

" Has anyone ever seen this miraculous novelty?  They look and act just
like
regular glycerin bubbles, and yet they are actually flavored candy. "

Hi there from Cracked-Out Elmo's silly girlfriend!  Just to let you
know.... The only place that I have been able to find them is FAO
Schwartz in San Francisco.  If you don't know where it is... It's
donwtown near the big big big Macy's! They have Cherry and Grape
flavored... They sell for $3.50.

Hope this helps!!!

Oh baby what a supreme weekend!  I know it would almost be sacriligious to say 
it, but I _didn't_ have all that much fun at CLoud Factory last week.....due to 
a combo of some bad drgs and a miniquarrel with the SO that day.  Anyhoo, 
needless to say, I was doubly fired up for this weekend, to redeem it all and 
reverse the funky karma.  And, like a fat J at the end of a long day, the crews 
at Ward Valley/Moontribe and The Sunset/Pacific crew know how to satisfy!

The Ward Valley rally really went off, with some of the most tweaky music I've 
heard in awhile.  Was it the LA influence? Great builds, and the gusto to bring 
it off the top.  Getting together  for a good cause always seems to bring out a 
good vibe. Did anyone make it to the 'later event'? Review?

And Sunset... what can you say about Sunset in words?  I had mucho trabajo to 
do, so I got up xtra early to finish it all.  It was a race against the clock 
to get all the work done, and the ETD of 2 pm came and went. Finally got there 
about 6, just in time to load a b and watch the sunset.  Then the full moon 
came out, then the Hale Bopp comet was visible.  Then, went it seemed like it 
couldn't get better, we were treated to an almost-full lunar eclipse. Plus, it 
stayed pretty warm the whole time! TONS of happy folks there, a GREAT sound 
system, a little jungle towards the end of the night....was this heaven? 

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

First let me say the Pacific Crew does it again, what else is new. If you
didn't have a good time it was your own fault. I had a wonder time like
always. Sunset is one of the best daytime party out there and always will
be in my book.

The only thing that bothered me was the trash people left around. This was
the worse I've ever seen. I may have not stayed after to clean up, but I
did pick up alot of trash that was left on the ground while I was there. I
spent at least a half hour cleaning up trash as I was walking around. I
could have filled 2 big garbage bags of trash and I didn't even make a dent.

People, if we want Sunsets to be as beautiful as always, we need to help
keep the space clean. It's outdoors,  the lights can't be turned on and
brooms and mops can't be brought out to clean. We need to start picking up
our trash as we go. If you trip over some trash, don't just look at it,
pick it up and throw it away. If everyone cleans up after themselves it
would make alot less of a mess.

So, please respect the space and help clean up. If you don't stay until the
end, at least pick up and take some trash on your way out.

I was kickin' in a cafe, baked outta my gourd, and I overheard this weird
couple pondering this question:

If you use Nutrasweet to make a sugar cookie, is it still a sugar cookie,
or is it a Nutracookie?


I don't know, maybe I'm crazy, but I think I just discovered a new chicken
or the egg philosopichal discussion.

High SFR!

Well, I'm pretty sure that I was one of the only SFRavers at this party. I
showed up early and the place was still pretty empty. The location was OK, even
thought there was a bar right outside the party.It was kinda hard to have 420,
but I managed. 

Jesse Martindale in the Mermaid room was RAD! I think that having somebody
spinning reggae at a party is a great idea and I hope I see this at more
parties. Some times you need a break from techno, you know? I also wanna give
phat props to Nelson Reeves and Kevin Hart for spinning some phat beats and
making me dance. Unfortunately, I went to the party with a lot of non-ravers,
so I had to leave hella early (1:00 am ={ ), but I had a good time anyways. Did
anyone else from SFR go? What happened after 1?

You know, if you sprinkle Nutrasweet over a flame from a lighter or match,
it will flame up alittle.

Three beautiful natural events... dancing with bare feet on the grass with
so many stars overhead felt like the perfect (the only!) place to be last
night.  Thanks to the fire dancer on the beach, all the people who brought
candles and glowsticks and incense and otherwise contributed to the vibe,
and of course to Pacific for a third season of giving to the scene. 

Someone said 500 people... but I'd say at least 1000 of us were there.  
I've never seen such a massive Sunset, but it was all ug, word-of-mouth 
only... and a ridiculous number of smiles and cheers.  Like I always feel 
at the first Sunset... the season is starting, and the scene is 
thriving!  Winter is over, and spring (rebirth) and summer (hedonism!) are 
in the air.

Here's to the continual rejuevenation of our scene...

I've been caught a couple of Thursday nights in the city, with a burning
desire to dance but nowhere to go.  I was going to just forget about it,
weekday partying being generally a bad idea, but I just found out (yea!!)
that this Friday is a work holiday...  So, does anyone know of any good
Thursday night weeklies or even any special parties this Thursday?? 

Also, I'm going to try to overcome my blind aversion to jungle by 
actually seeking it out and giving it a chance (though I still don't 
understand how to dance to it! :P)  Any good jungle weeklies - and when's 
the next Audio Impact?

Thank you everybody!

Just heard yesterday that DV8 is CLOSING!  Last night was IT for DV8 as a
club... it is closing starting today for remodeling and will reopen as
(gag) a restaurant downstairs, and offices on the top floors. 

Does this mean SPUNDAE is also over?  Or has it found a new home (I 
certainly hope so!)  In addition to being about the best "club" for us 
spoiled ravers, Spundae also has to be one of the all-time greatest names, 
with at least four meanings that _I_ can think of!

Also, DV8 is the largest club in SF besides 1015.  What does the closing 
of a major club mean for the mainstream scene?  Will 1015 become even 
more crowded with suburban "weekend warriors"?  Is the clubscene so 
moribound that DV8 is no longer profitable as a dance club??  DV8, though 
admittedly lame on main nights, was a home to techno... does this mean 
less venues for techno nights, now that it's gone?  Pondering...

this thursday bulletproof is doing another "unexploded bomb" at mission rock
w/ an "enhanced dj set" from rockers hi-fi (uk), they'll also be at organic
on friday. and if i remember correctly it's $7. the flyer is at home, i'll 
post the details later if someone else doesn't beat me to it...

also i *highly* recommend checking out daft punk this sat:

saturday, March 29th - Funky Tekno Tribe presents Daft Punk Live
Daft Punk live from Paris, Jeno. 
21+, $12. SF. http://www.funkytekno.com 
                             415.266.9215

their new album "homework" is excellent; a nice collection of quality house tracks,
tweaked out disco, and noisy techno. galen dropped a bomb off of it yesterday at 
sunset and everyone went nuts...

I can be a whiner, and I have to say: why in the world do we have to 
alert people if we (gasp) dare to mention drugs in our posts??  Let's try 
to leave mainstream knee-jerk anti-drug prejudice behind and be honest 
about our experiences and our scene (thankfully open-minded, I like to 
think!).

PS I also immediately think the discussion is about DJ DRC whenever I see 
"DRC."

IMO, Trance and Jungle Factory is pretty UG!  Last time I was there it 
was all dj's and scenesters... not too many lookyloos.  The calendar is a 
service for those in the scene (not just people with email).  I wouldn't 
be too worried about the type of person who would seek out this store 
showing up at a party!  Most likely they're already spinning at it :)

BTW, Tom has done a _great_ job setting up this store!  Lotsa
love (and money, I bet!) went into decorating... check out the mini-chill
room with netting and a forest theme, complete with stuffed animals
peeking from behind trees.

I made a boo-boo in my earlier response to this (sorry Brian)
 ... so I'm resending it.

Someone asked about having SFRCalendar info posted at the Trance
and Jungle Factory.  I think that's great .... this is a list that is open to anyone
who'd like to svbscribe, and events posted on the list are there as free
information.  Real underground parties aren't posted (or are posted with
minimal information), so that's not a worry.  

Before I had email, I used to go to Ameba and ask Alan what was up, and
he'd show me his printout (and when I was really ballsy, I'd call him and
ask) ....  Matter of fact, when I lose my email, I"ll probably be asking Thomas
and Greta what's up too!

then.....  Nancy asked why we should note at all if there's Drug Related Content in
a post ....

Many of us use email accounts in our place of work .... and those work
accounts are not in any way private.  I think it's a good idea to create a way
for people to filter out posts that are on topics that would not be appropriate
for them in that environment.  Frankly, it makes me pretty nervous seeing some
of the posts that come across my mail.  Naming names in context with illegal
activities is pretty foolish as far as I'm concerned.  

My pennies worth...

In preparation for continent-hopping this summer, a friend gave me a 
brochure from the Tourist Board of Vienna (Austria, for all you ignorant 
Americans ;).  It lists shopping, hotels, sightseeing tours, and bars and 
clubs!  One of which features "raves daily from 10PM".

Cute grammatical errors aside, I am not sure whether to be horrified or to
accept this as a part of European culture.  If "rave" is completely
mainstream there, does that simply mean any nightclub with techno music is
a "rave"?  Or could this event be something recognizably "rave" (by my
definition), so common in the culture that it could retain "real raveness" 
despite its inclusion in a (ack!) tourist brochure?  Or is the Tourist
Board just clueless, throwing the term "rave" in just to appear hip? 

The definition of "rave" is more than problematic, it's practically 
meaningless.  So much so that a brochure can list "rave" and I have no 
clue what to expect there.  

(Yes, my boss is out of the office today and I'm indulging in a shamefully 
delicious email orgy!)

The Oscars are scheduled to be over at 9pm, so Mad will still be going on
at 10pm. And hey, if members of the academy want to get down to techno
we're happy to have them.

Hi All,
We've two local shows lined up for you this week. Hope you can make it out.
We're also throwing a party tonite in Miami ... just incase ..:) The
Rockers Hi-Fi show will be in San Francisco at Ceaser's and the DAFT PUNK
show will be at Mission Rock. DAFT PUNK will however only be 21+, though
they'll be back for Halloween Tribal Massive in October. We're planning a
mega all-day FTT in Los Angeles July 5th, so if you want a change in
scenery, see us there.
On another note, the Porno for Pyros show has been postponed again. And the
Chemical Brothers/Orb show has been moved to Sunday May 4th. We've decided
not to do it since we felt we would not have the rave/party/live act
atmosphere that we wanted. I want to apologize to all the people who wrote
me about the details about the show. The show will go on however. I believe
BGP (Bill Graham Presents) has picked it up and it would probably be at the
Warfield. 

Peace,
Mohan Veloo
Business Manager

Thank you to all who gave me suggestions for Thursday night... I'll have
to file them away for future use though, because I stumbled upon the
perfect party plan for this Thursday... <ta da>... the 20th Anniversary
screening of Saturday Night Fever at the Roxie!!!  This is a
not-to-be-missed disco event.  And for those of you who think you don't
like disco, revisit this dance music of the '70's for bells, whistles,
stomping bass and percussion.  It's the grandma of techno!  And from what 
I hear, the underground disco scene was the rave scene of the 70's.  :)

Oh yea?

  I thought that ravEs were more about who you left with "than the music"
  More about how many friends you make "than the music"
  How happy you can act, rather "than the music"

Was Taj spinning in the basement at Simple Pleasures?  I never made it down
there, the beats were just too phat upstairs to consider leaving...

Is Taj only at Zendada (Nikita's basement) on the first friday of the
month?  I could swear he's there more often, I think he's only _not_ been
there once out of the several times I've gone.

I definately know what you mean about spiritual leader.....worth handling
the weekend club crowd just to see him spin.

i can't actually answer your questions, but could it be that the rave
culture in germany and austria is less of an illegal / underground thing.
here in england there are parts of the rave scene that have quite a
political agenda (e.g. the travellers / new age travellers who got the whole
thing going here) and then you have the trespassing problem where hundreds
of people descend on some poor farmer's field for an all-night illegal rave,
illegal because of the criminal (in)justice act, which also makes assemblies
of more than something like 4 people and REPETITIVE BEATS illegal!!!
 i think raves are more 'acceptable' in germany (i don't know about
austria). i think germans had less problems incorporating it into the
mainstream. because, to be honest, if raves were illegal in germany, then
there wouldn't be any. did you see how the german police handled this
nuclear waste transport protest? i expect austria is fairly similar.
i'm not saying that german or austrian raves are crap, they are just not
underground.
but then...i could be completely wrong.

well as it has been said before,Sunset rocked!! There were alot of people and
saw a lot of old(and made some new) friends. Met Leslie and uncle noah and
ended the night by going to my first full moon.
-Full Moon was the best! It could've been 6 years ago ....Everything about it
was so perfect(cept it was cold, but that was okay) Didn't gey=t to stay very
long on account of work early the next morning. but it was definatley worth
the drive! I am wondering who was the first dj to go on-It was a woman(she
rocked!). Can anyone who was there let me know who that was? just curious-
-Missed Ron D Core!!!I can't believe it! but the party got shut down anyway.
For any and all Ron D Core fans there's always the Dr. Freeclouds
website@www.drfreeclouds.com got a big selection of ron's tapes(check out
acid test2 and for something diffrent "born in the south"(Ron's only?House
tape) The Fuck You record sounds like one of the tracks from "Clash of the
Titans" which he and excalibur put out last year on thier atomic label(if you
get the picture disk check out the backside for some psycho fun. I used to
like Ron's sets alot more but he has gotten was too fast to dance to (usally
they just mosh in LA).
-That's all for now...

HEy Hey All you peoples I wuv so much.
Well Sunset Went off.
The day was filled with smiling faces and the warm sun touched or faces. It
was great to see everyone there. I wasn't feeling this well this weekend so I
decided not to go to any parties. So I called My bestest friend Paula and
they said they were going to SUnset. So I decided to go along. Still feeling
sick. But As soon as I got there I felt a whole lot better. Well the sunset
was beautiful. So was the comet and eclipse. Sorry for all you that missed
it. But I had a special place in my heart for all of you. Well LOve you all

Regarding raves in Austria, Germany and Switzerland: there are raves and
there are raves.
Especially in Germany there are big ultra commercial raves with big
corporate sponsorships (Marlboro, Pepsi and the likes), fan devotionalia,
follow-up CD compilations and videos and even the rights to broadcast from
these events are being sold to the media (see events like Mayday and Love
Parade).
This would now indicate that the whole scene is selling out. This is only
half the truth.

The techno movement is already so old and so widespread that you have loads
of different factions,
and only at the very big events like Love Parade they unite. I have heard
other people mentioning
that at events like Love Parade the music was only BUMM-BUMM GERMAN TECHNO.
Well that was probably Dutch Gabber. There were enough American DJs present
(e.g. Carl Cox) that
certainly have a more house kind of style.

Back to the original topic: So many people - read the European youth - is
infected with the techno
virus and is trying Djaying, producing tracks, putting together parties, or
opening record labels.
Among my friends I have loads of European DJs, label owners and party
promoters. Sounds impressive
right? But these guys/girls are only just getting by doing this, if at all.
Are they doing it because of their
faith in techno is all they need - no, they are just never going to make it
because there is other better
and more devoted people out there.

Translate: there is still loads of parties all over Europe that are kind of
underground, and some of them
are actually in squatted houses, at the seaside (like Sunset), at remote
mountain sites etc.
Are you likely to read about them in the press or on the internet? Not
likely. I have the good fortune
to know a lot of folks in that scene that can give me the right pointers
whenever I am in Technoland.
If you can read German: get Frontpage (their website is www.techno.de - UKs
mixmag is here too)
or Partysan (www.partysan.de). Or when in Vienna get the Prinz (a paper
like the SFBG but not free).

You will though find an ample amount of commercial to semi-commercial club
/ rave events in every
major city in Europe, which includes Vienna, Basel or Munich to stay in
that triangle.

While Vienna is perhaps beautiful to visit, if you want to rave then go to
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain (especially Ibiza). Forget
the UK apart for some special events (Tribal Gathering) or some standard
clubbing (which is more house than techno - which is OK).

If you are an absolute party boy/girl Ibiza might be the ultimate option,
because that's where the
top Brit, German and Dutch DJs are eventually playing as well. But beware
this means party on
24h/day and  7days the week (not cheap either - but sun and fun).

I would especially look at aforementioned URLs before planning a trip to
Europe.

Enough waste of bandwidth!
Regards Jan

from the calendar:

   _Monday Night Dinner_ - a haphazard collection of ravers who get
   together weekly to properly wind down their weekend or rev their
   engines for the coming week. a different cuisine each week, usually in
   SF.
   info on SFRaves or here (when available). Ask for the SFRaves table.
   after-party at Mad.
   8:30p-All ages.

does this still happen? if so, I'd be all over it. I'm new in SF and it
just seems like a good idea.

Sorry I do not go to raves ... rather clubs that is ... to just meet my
posse or just
to make friends. I go there for the line-up of Djs and that's also what I
and you
pay for - otherwise we could all go to a nice bar or whatever and pay less
than
$2.50 for booze (which is still cheap in my book).

I am not a good actor, if the music sucks I suck. And the music was OK as I
said.

Were there two full moon deals going on last night?  I never did get all
the rumors properly sorted out.  I figured I'd just check the usual spots
instead, and what do you know...first stop, Panther Beach--voila.  If
that's where you were, it was Melanie first, I think.

Lara went to LA this weekend with some SFRavers :)
Ryan's idea of a car of partiers going to LA became a caravan, and it was 
PERFECT! Took us about 14 hours to get down to LA (11 from my house) cuz 
we stopped way too many times to get food, and get gas. BUT it was all 
good, cuz everytime we stopped, we busted out dancing in the parking lot 
-- at one point we had people staring at us from their cars and 
everything. HOW FUN though.
	The weekend was full of love and energy for us, but when we 
showed up at FULL CIRCLE, it was odd. My first LA party, I had no idea 
what to expect, i had NO expectations and thank god i didn't! Here are a 
few things I learned from this party, and from talking to various NICE LA 
ravers..
1) LA Ravers are VERY dedicated and concerned regarding what they're 
wearing. Stariana pointed out that everyone wants to be the coolest 
looking raver at the parties.
2) LA raves have ALOT OF HARDCORE and NITROUS. Hardcore is fun, but I 
could only jack my body for a half hour before i noticed that there were 
tons of people just bobbing their heads up and down (Another SFRaver 
pointed out that LA can't dance, hehe!) Plus, in the Trance tent, there 
were a couple Nitrous tanks hangin out, I was assured that Nitrous is 
very popular at parties.. I was scared to find people passing out, but 
relieved when no one did.. i THINK
3) LA raves lack the community and love SF raves do. I MISSED SF SO MUCH 
this past weekend, I am SO GRATEFUL for our scene! My friend Andy who 
lives in LA and used to throw a weekly down there said that everyone's 
out for themselves down there, and that it's so commercialized down there 
that he's given up socializing at partie4s all together, it's so 
frustrating...

Our tent was set up super phat, Ryan and Christine started bringing in 
ravers who weren't feeling well and couldnt find their friends for us to 
take care of. I sat with a cpouple of them and calmed them down hardcore, 
and it was the funnest night! 
SO OVERALL: FULL CIRCLE WAS LIKE THIS:
	The music was incredible, but Lara can only handle hardcore for a 
short while before the incessant (sp?) pounding becomes a little like a 
hammer hitting her head :) 
	The vibe SUCKED alot! I met a FEW LA Ravers who arew nice, but 
for the most part, AT THIS PARTY, the people did NOTwant to be talked to 
at ALL. Was it just THIS party? I dunno, which is why I'm determined to 
go to another LA party :) 
	The location was EXCELLENT: a desert in the middle of what seemed 
to be nowhere :) 
	The SETUP was phat, although the trance tent should have been 
bigger and if they were gonna sell Nitrous, it should have been a little 
less obvious, but then that's just me.. ;))
OK? OK!
I want to thank EVERYONE who went on this trip for sticking together, we 
all almost split up and went to 2 partie,s but without everyone, I think 
we would have had an awful time at Full Circle. THANK YOU TO HADRIAN!! 
FOR ALL THE PHAT VIBES AND HUGS :) Good Karma DOES exist, i promise! 
THanks to RYAN for the vision and seeing it through :)) THanks to the 
HAPPY KIDS for bringing me the phattest smiles and love ever, April 5th 
HERE WE GO! :) (ian where were u!) thanks to Brett (where's waldo) for 
driving down and vibin' as well :)
AND: thanks to SFRave community, for giving such love, and sticking 
together! I can't believe, how wonderful you all are!
love and hugs,
lara~~

I can only imagine that moving Spundae to Cat's is a temporary thing --
the place is pretty small and Henrik and those guys have big ambitions.

Still, closing DV8 is definitely the end of an era.  I can't say I ever
had a cosmic time there although I do remember a couple extra-good sets,
one by David Harness and one by Jeno down in the basement where he just
plain stone went off for three hours (finishing up with a remix of my
old favorite Lonnie Liston Smith "Expansions").  But I digress.  

A while ago I heard Dr. Winkie was ready to convert the place into 
something along the lines of the "Eddie Fisher Supper Club."  
Believe it or don't :)

       How was the Wicked party full moon party?! Did many people turn out
for this?
     
      There was another Full moon party that Dave Bayer and friends tried
to pull off in the marina last night-that is until we were busted by 3
patrol cars:(...oh well- we got to walk around under the moon for a couple
of hours=).....

well...yes...i do remember when...i had just been spinning for 6 months on
my technics SLBD22k's...and I still couldn't match beats very well...and I
tried to go to Basics New Year party (FYI that's the last one they ever
tried) and we all ended up having to go to the huge Wicked thing at DV8
and it was $25 to get in and I got very sick the next day for like a
week...but Garthy spun this set that I just didn't know what the fuck was
what.  I couldn't even tell when he was mixing nstuff (hi jeff!)

but i think that's the last time i was there.  probably the last time ill
ever go there.  

unless I buy it and turn it into a low cost SFR party place.  

?who knows?

I wouldn't call it DV8 though...I'd call it the Fog Factory.  =]

The Ceridwen show at Mission Rock on Friday was a-fucking-mazing. 
Beautiful night, great view of the almost-full moon, totally clear...  

The last two downstairs DJs (both with Moontribe, i understand) just
totally rocked the house, and were *so* into their set. They were both
completely and inexorably in the ZONE, plugged into the crowd, throwing
their hands in the air (and even waving 'em like they just didn't care),
obviously loving it, oozing pleasure and passion.  The crowd was throughly
infected with the trancy grooves, lotsa joyous whistling and egging the
DJs on.  

We even got the last dude to do an oncore set; people wouldn't stop
yelling and asking for more, so he complied.  Cool!

I'd love to get their names; anyone know?

I think the main reason is for filtering purposes.  Some people just want
those threads to dump immediately into the trash, because they don't care,
or they want to be able to prove their innocence when the feds kick in their
door, or whatever.

Same for NRR, I reckon, it's just a simple way to filter out the extraneous
topics.

I hear what you're saying about the confusion behind their lingo, but if you
read the Berkeley Guides (a global tourist handbook), under "San Francisco"
they urge the reader to check out the rave scene while in town.   I guess
they suggest it in the same tone that they suggest you go down to Telegraph
Ave to check out the scowling punkers sitting on newspaper boxes & hawking
lungers at pedestrians.

I think "Let's Go" has similar suggestions.,, appealing to the 20 Sumping's
with fat wallets & time to kill.

One person's lifestyle is another's vacation, I guess.

Hey Adam, it's weird how two people can be at the same party and have 
completely opposite experiences...

Ceridwen started off in a beauty way, but by 1:00 PM had turned into a 
drunken stupor,  Yes the music was amazing, the black light art hangin 
from the walls the best I have ever seen and more. Sweet gentle peole, 
lots of CCC folks and familiar faces from 7:00 PM on...

However something 
happened when the booze flowed....stumbling drunks  everywhere..and sadly
one saw fit to vomit several times on the altar I brought "Mariposa", 
some of you might remember her from the Gateway camp at Burning Man and 
some other parties since then... she came within seconds of being 
irreparably damaged..and was in fact damaged...
Had I know that Mission Rock had bars I would have never brought her...I 
accept responsibility for not doing my homework....Amazing enough, this 
is the first time I had ever been to Mission Rock...a great space, except 
for the bars...  

I had a vision, to take Mariposa to different parties and share her with 
as many tribes as possible...I was told that not all of the tribes are 
ready for her..or other altars...  myself and others spent the night 
protecting the alters from destruction....  Mariposa won't be going out 
for a while and when she does, it will be only to those parties I  already 
know and trust...

I am glad that lots of folks were unaffected by the drunkenness..

~~peace

Maureen

P.S.  As of tonight, I will no longer receive any mail via the Well..my 
new address (for some time) is mh2o@microweb.com.

hello all -

well, um, these used to occur every week until it was "decided" that they
should only occur once a month cause some people were getting bored.  the
normal promoters have been pretty busy, so if you wanna try doing it for a
while, give it a whirl!  that goes for everybody out there.

Where to start?  Okay, I have to say that my friends Annie and Andy are 
the greatest travel partners a person could ask for!

Okay so on to the parties:
Space Children:  I didn't think we had the right location at first... 
looked like a bunch of gangsters out front, but after swinging by a local 
house party, we drove back to the location and I could see inside and 
there was lots of flourescent stuff, so I figured it was all right.  
Great to see Union Jack 'live' (yes, when the 303 came unplugged, some 
sounds stopped happening, so it really was running :P).  I _really_ liked 
that they played the remix of Two Full Moons and a Trout.  One of my 
favorite tracks of all time  :)

Ward Valley Protest:  A fun gathering, but not as big as I had expected.  
Too bad, too since there was some really great music!  I heard that new 
Jedi Knights rekkid and almost fainted! (I picked up a copy at Ameba 
shortly thereafter) :)  So, all-in-all a really fun time!

Bellysomething (?) @ Cyborganic:  Didn't stay too long due mostly to 
exhaustion, but hey for $5 you really can't complain about anything, now 
can you?  The trampoline and big stuffed bear were really cool!

Sunset:  What a great party!  So many fun folks... too many to be able to 
meet everyone, but I loved being there so very much.  A lovely comet on 
one side, a beautiful eclipse on the other and loving happy people all 
around.  Wow.

Full Moon @ Panther Beach:  I had heard a lot about this location and had 
seen photos of it before and had wanted to see it in person for a long 
time.  This party was so much fun!  Too cold, yes, but fun!  If you 
wanted to boogie down, there was plenty of opportunity.  If you wanted to 
visit with frieds, there was plenty of opportunity.  If you wanted to go 
meditate on the rocks, there was plenty of opportunity.  If you wanted to 
just bug out by the fire... well, you get the picture :)

So it's been a long time since I've had a weekend quite this full of 
adventure!  I saw a lot of fun folks (including the Uncle Noah Fan Club 
who listened to the new tape I gave them twice in less than 24 hours :D) 
and had a really great time.  I only regret that now I have to go to 
sleep and go back to work in the morning :(

Okay, if there's no ODP then I'll rest this weekend and see you all at Dune

-Uncle Noah

aaaah, well, lara pretty much said everything there was to say about our
field trip to so-cal this weekend. coming from l.a. and having started
partying there, i was dissapointed with the vibethere. everybody was
concerned with being the best dresser, the most popular, etc., and noone
was willing to spread their happiness with others. us sfravers were
looking for love where all we got was intimidating stares from lots of
them. 
despite all this, there were also alot of friendly happy people that i
wanted to pack in my suitcase and take back with me to northern cal. a
girl named marisol gave me her earmuffs (blue-my favourite colour!),
something that i have been wanting for ages, a boy named scottie gave me
an fabulous hug and smile, and a girl named lawn (no clue as to how to
spell this girlie's name) had a sooper lovely smile that lit up her face.
you could see the positive energy absolutely glowing in her cheeks. one
guy, arley, gave me some pot! it wasn't so much that these people gave,
but rather that they were willing to give whatever they had, whether their
vibe or a little treat, to those around them. yay! 
i liked the music, especially in the early morning. the fliers that they
handed out were impressive, although a bit ostentatious, and now they are
making my wall pretty and colourful. the mist was kinda irritating but it
wasn't that cold and there were fires, and a yummy tent to chill in. there
was also quite a bit of drinking, something else that gives me a bad vibe
when i am around it. 
one of the highlights of this trip though was on our way to the party when
we stopped for a break to dance on the side of the road (we almost got in
trouble-oops!) and when we got to the mappoint and lara and oosha (again
spelling) started singing the "if you're happy and you know it, clap your
hands" song along with a few of the boys providing beats. so silly and so
fun! another thing was when marty was on top of the speakers in the tent
early in the morning with a happy wonderful grin on his face bumping to
the music. fun stuff. 
i believe we caused quite a stir with all of our excitement. we brought
with us such an incredibly amazing vibe with us, all, say, 20 of us, i
believe, from up north down south. if only we could have spread it
farther... if it weren't for the people i was with, i wouldn't have had
nearly as good of a time. thanks to all who went- everybody contributed
marvelous energy. it was great to meet all the happy kids (you all rock my
world) i hope everybody all had a good time.
enough of my mindless babble,
keep shining,
love and sugarkisses,

well...anytime we go to VHS we start losing quality.  S-VHS it if
possible.  That's a much better format.  

or...

get it on Beta.  That's a kickin format, but basically dead because enough
people decided to go with it.  

If access is possible to a computer with video editing capabilities...then
that is the best way to do any editing.  However...the good ole linear
editing machines are still around.  Consumer grade ones don't seem to have
the accuracy that the more expensive production grades do.  

Anyway...that's a lesson in today's video editing.  But wait there's more.  

Some stereo receivers (like Moonpup's Sony) have the capability to do
video and audio edits.  They're not clean like on an editor, but it
depends upon what is needed.  

Okee?  back to my grilled tofu-cheese sandwich (that's tofu-based cheese,
not tofu and cheese, for all you cheese-heads out there nstuff (hi jeff!)

love love love

The one I ended up at, at Panther, wasn't a Wicked affair.  I still don't
know if they did something last night or not, but I suspect that was just a
mixup on the word-of-mouth line...Garth was at Panther, and Melanie,
Carlos, Tracy, and some more.  Good crowd, maybe two hundred or so at peak
(I'm a bad judge, though), with lots of people coming down to continue
Sunset on into the night.  Bunch of people from LA, too, which was a
surprise (because of Moontribe, maybe).  The setting was truly
dazzling--Panther's pretty cool to start with, and last night's moon was
awesome.  There was a projector with various trippy vids for the cliffs,
but it was hardly necessary.  I had a damn good time, just dancing all
night...I must have told myself at least a dozen times, "OK, you *really*
have to go soon now."  I left at ten in the morning, and the music was
still rolling.

	I am going to post this warning, the future of this Sunday party in
Berkeley has been threatened. If it will continue, I will post it on here
again hopefully soon. It may be a while until we can find out. I am hoping
it will not be cancelled, since the first few were so good. The problem is
that we had to hold last Sunday's in a different room since it was raining
outside. This aggravated some of the house members. I'm sure if we can keep
it on the roof we'll be okay. But I'll keep you updated on what happens.

	PS Thanks for all the inquiries about spinning. We hope to see a lot of
you come down and check the party out. It's still growing!

Actually, Spundae is moving to V/SF (the old Oasis), not Cat's Alley.  There 
is no way to squeeze Spundae into that tiny space.  V/SF though is really 
quite big in comparison to the basement of DV8, so it should be interesting 
to see how it goes off.

Also, Deepfog is right about Dr. Winkie changing DV8 into a supper club.  In 
fact he's spending half a million dollars on renovations to do it.  But, 
they are not closing the basement, they are just remodeling it.  Spundae 
_will_ move back there when the renovations are complete...in about 3 
months...

Smiles,

Scott =)

Now I bet you never thought you'd see this response to your post, but I've
got one thing to say here: No, the bit about raves in Berkeley Guides SF
is not meant to be condescending to ravers in any way--and how do I know
this?  

BECAUSE I WROTE THE TEXT!  :-O

Berkeley Guides are revised each year, and I worked for them several
summers ago doing chapters on California and SF, and when I wrote that
bit, no, I didn't mean it the way you said at all. When I was considering
providing a comprehensive perspective of the San Francisco Bay Area, I
wanted everyone to know that raves were a vital part of the SF culture,
but I knew I had to be careful with phrasing, as this book can be bought
all over the world, and not everyone knows what a rave is or what raving
entails.  

Anyway, I'm not upset by the apparent misinterpretation at all; in fact,
as a writer I get a tremendous kick out of seeing something I wrote a long
time ago still being considered and evolving today.  Pretty cool, eh?

It's AMAZING who's on SFRaves!!  More than once, I've written something
totally random or even a rave factoid I thought to be true, only to have
more accurate information come from the source itself (his or herself!),
another raver right here on the list!  Our numbers are huge... 

Besides networking and info and building community, this list is a great 
place to learn about all sorts of things, sometimes inadvertently! :P

It's just a major bummer that Berkeley Guides (all student written) 
folded this year.  My fantasy of touring the world on their dime will 
never be realised... you were lucky, Tim!!

Hello and good morning everybody...

A few corrections on Spun:

a) The Info number is: 510.218.7494

b)	It seems that the sound we are utilizing has to be at another event 
(produced by some really good friends) by Nine PM, so we may have to 
shut down a bit earlier than expected (round 8'ish I believe)...

Sorry for the inconvenience,

--Rebel Alliance Sound.

pacific sound system is no joke.  everything i've heard was confirmed and
surrpassed.  when's the last time you went to a rock concert or any concert for
that matter where people helped pick up afterward?  everyone i met there was
one of us.  the natural phenomena were present: 98% moonar e-clips, comet
complete with tail, phat warm basslines, and concern for others.  why oh why
did i miss my chance to live with these guys? i'll be first in line when the
next opening happens.......

i met greta at sunset and she told me about this new store called the trance &
jungle factory which i'm sure you've all already heard of.  i went there
yesterday and was not dissappointed.  thomas was busy on the phone making
business calls so i helped myself to tasty vinyl grooves.  twelve listening
stations?  you mean i don't have to wait.....ever? that's bad ass!  when thomas
was done with his call he started to interview me.  we had a great chat as we
were nursing our hangovers from the previous sunset.  he's got great plans for
the store and he's definately committed.  please chek this store out, it's a
sure hit.  but don't forget primal. thomas made it very clear that he is doing
everything he can not to compete with primal rekkeds.  i think this a very
positive attitude.  
i will definatley make this place a regular stop on each payday.  thanks.

i think that this party on saturday afternoon is gonna be good. the R.A.S.
seems like a fun type crew so i'll just have to chek it out.

after this party and b4 sat. nite events python heads should go to the a-thon
that they are having at the uc theatre. holy grail, life o' brian, meaning all
back to back.  a big spliff is called for.  only for the headstrong strictly
for the hardcore.
..........................where oh where is the fish? a most elusive fish. and
it went wherever i do go...............dove one.

It never surprises me what we ravers do ... or what are connections to
everyone else are ... that 6 degrees of separation idea (that we are at
most 6 levels away from knowing anyone on earth, starting with everyone you
know, then everyone they know and so on) is definitely true for us ...

As for the whole Berkeley Guides demise, there was an excellent article
about it a few weeks ago on the front page of the East Bay Express.  What's
great about books like Let's Go & the Berkeley Guides is reading between
the lines -- the people who write the stuff are generally pretty cool
students.  One of my good college friends went to Morocco & Spain for Let's
Go in the late 80's, and put information such as where in Barcelona it was
especially "wild at night with hash dealers" (deliberate misinformation --
that place compared to People's Park was a tame and safe place for hash
sales).

like gay people, Deadheads & Aliens, ravers can truly say:

WE ARE EVERYWHERE

Although I like to think that everyone is welcome in our scene, that 
people can express themselves how and with whoever they like, I've been 
wondering just how hospitable the rave scene really is to gay and lesbian 
(etc.!) ravers.

I've seen male couples, and women together in the chill room (though 
sometimes I think a lot of this is just e-experimentation!), but going to 
a gay/lesbian club recently got me to thinking...

At this dance club, in the heart of the Castro, people were truly free.  
There was so much handholding, lapsitting, joyful embracing and sweet, 
passionate couples... As though relationships were imbued with that much 
more intensity, because here, finally, was a place couples could show how 
they felt for each other.  And I realized that I, as a (well, relatively) 
straight woman, had only _thought_ I knew what a comfortable scene was for a 
gay/lesbian person - and the rave scene suddenly looks as straight and 
uninviting as any other scene in this "hetero" world.

Yesterday my bro and me went down to greyhound rock  (a beautiful beach 
north of Santa Cruz..) indulged and lost our minds out on the beach for a 
few hours.  It got dark and cold and as we made our way back to our car 
we realized that neither of us could drive for a good long while...so 
what to do?  no problem- we chilled and watched the stars come out and 
wished we had some food...

so we figured that we would be there for about another three hours, when 
what to our eyes appears other than a rad happy group of ravers loading 
there equipment into a big orange bus.  I think they were sent from 
heaven, as one of them drove us all the way to our front door step while 
the big happy orange bus followed us.

All I've got to say- is thanks you guys, I hope you read this and I will 
always remember you!!

This is soooo funny!

Advice on upgrading to Wife 1.0

Last year a friend of mine upgraded GirlFriend 6.0 to Wife 1.0 and
found that it's a memory hog leaving very little system resources for
other applications. He is only now noticing that Wife 1.0 also is
spawning Child-Processes which are further consuming valuable
resources.

No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the
product brochure or the documentation, though other users have
informed him that this is to be expected due to the nature of the
application. Not only that, Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is
always launched at system initialization where it can monitor all
other system activity. He's finding that some applications such as
PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to
run, crashing the system when selected (even though they always worked
fine before). At installation, Wife 1.0 automatically installs
undesired Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw 55.8 and BrotherInLaw Beta
release. As a consequence system performance seems to diminish with
each passing day.

Some features he'd like to see in the upcoming wife 2.0:

 - A "Don't remind me again" button
 - Minimize button
 - An install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 to
   be installed with the option to uninstall at anytime without
   the loss of cache and other system resources.
 - An option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode which would
   allow the systems hardware probe feature to have greater use.

I myself decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with Wife
1.0 by sticking with Girlfriend 2.0. Even here, however, I found many
problems. Apparently you cannot install Girlfriend 2.0 on top of
Girlfriend 1.0. You must uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 first. Other users
say this is a long standing bug which I should have been aware of.
Apparently the versions of Girlfriend have conflicts over shared use
of the  I/O port. You think they would have fixed such a stupid bug by
now.  To make matters worse, The uninstall program for Girlfriend 1.0
doesn't work very well leaving undesirable traces of the application
in the system.

Another annoying problem -- all versions of Girlfriend continually
popup annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0

*****  BUG WARNING  ********
Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1
before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files
before executing a self - uninstallation. Then Mistress 1.1 will
refuse to install, claiming insufficient system resources.

*** BUG WORK-AROUNDS ***************
To avoid the above bug, try installing Mistress 1.1 on a different
system and never run any file transfer applications such as Laplink
6.0. Also, beware of similar shareware applications that have been
known to carry viruses that may affect Wife 1.0.


Another solution would be to run Mistress 1.0 via a UseNet provider
under an anonymous name. Here again, beware of the viruses which can
accidentally be downloaded from the UseNet.

P.S.  It wasn't always like this (i.e gay friendly dance scene).  It
happened one day...

who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder

Go to any party that Tony Rotundo is putting on... He almost always
spins disco during the tweaker hours. (6am -> ?) :)

Very interesting topic Nancy has brought up.  About a year ago, we had a similar
thread, but from a gay man (a very good friend of mine) who wanted to encourage 
people to invite more gay people into the scene who belong with "us" (there I go 
again!) rather than in the fairly harsh world of the gay club scene.

When I first started going out dancing, about 5 years ago (my god, how time flies).. 
I mostly went to gay clubs, because I have lots of very close gay male friends, and
I wanted to be somewhere where people treated me like a person, and didn't hit on
me (I was just coming out of a marriage).  That scene became my life in many ways
(but not in the harsh ways, which, though I hate to generalize, include too much crystal
and a lot of shallow promiscuity).

Then I discovered raving, and felt at home immediately ... but I know it wouldn't have
been that way if it weren't for spending so much time in the gay clubs (I'll admit, I still
sometimes go to Universe just for nostalgia... as do some of you, cuz I've seen you
there!  ;^)   ...............

Many of my closest friends are gay or bi ravers... but there is a definite difference in 
behavior at a party than when we're at a gay club ... there is still some self-censorship
that you have to be aware of, especially at parties with a more "thug" vibe. 

When my friends are kissing or whatever, I keep an eye out for those homophobic people
who might react to their behavior, because I've had one friend get sucker-punched
on a dance floor at Spundae's ... and his nose was broken in 8 places.   It's too bad
when you have to watch your back like that.

In chill spaces, though, and at underground parties, I don't recall ever having any
problems.  Of course, the sexuality is different at a party than a club ... it's much less
cruisy (i.e. I like you, you like me, let's go home together) at parties ... and more sensual
and caring in emphasis.   

The one thing I love about ravers is that bisexuality is so widely accepted.  I hope that
someday, in the world at large eventually, but first in our own world ... that we get to the
point that we are all free to be who we are, and we don't have to worry about other
people's acceptance of that.

I do notice, though, (and sometimes worry a little about) is that there is a feeling of
asexuality with lots of ravers.  It may have to do with age groups, it may have to do with
drug usage, or it may just be the kinds of people who are attracted to the scene.

But if that more nonsexual or asexual or omnisexual feeling is part of what makes our  
parties so comfortable, then I respect and appreciate its contribution to the vibe.

My nickel's worth on this one...
Leslie

Geez, Tony...

Here I am thinking we're making this great new society, getting rid of all the
stupid, nonproductive, limiting stereotypes of behavior based on someone's
idea of what you;re "supposed to do and be" ...... and then you post this
crazy assed middle America thing, and I feel like crying and whacking you on
the head (which I would do if you were here in person) ....

but unfortunately, I was also laughing ... geez, it's hard to be politically correct
when you're laughing like that ... (which means I couldn't have whacked you
very hard, what with ROTFLOL and all)....

but next time... can you post the Husband/Boyfriend version, and then the Gay/
Lesbian/Bisexual version as well?  How about the Mormon version? and the
Celibate version?   If you're gonna be sexist, as least be politically correct!

.... please no flames, I'm having a very weird day ... as Tony apparently is too...

>From what I can tell, and for myself, Raving is really an individual
experience that has little to do with sexual preference. It's about
dancing and feeling good, not about who you have sex with.

I think too many people run their lives by their sexual preference and
think that this is all they are. There is a lot more to a person then
this. 

I don't know about you, but since I got into the scene I feel more
comfortable expressing my feeling towards people of the same sex and
making physical contact (hugging, etc..). When we're raised we're taught
that it's "gay" to hung another guy or do certain things. This is all
B.S. This is why it's so much harder for people to come out. Our society
is so afraid of differences and when we should all be celebrating our
diversity.

Well, back to work.

i have an observation:  i see a lot of girls (ahem, i mean, women) kissing
eachother at raves.  many of them consider themselves "straight".
women generally seem more inclined to be affectionate with eachother.
men seem much more homophobic-- like even a hug for a lot of non-ravers
and certainly a kiss even in the rave scene would be a negative reflection
on their sexuality.   i almost never see guys kissing eachother at raves.
it's too bad, really, 'cuz i think it's more a reflection of their hangups
than of their sexuality.


love,

brian

i will say, however, that i think the rave scene is much more comfortable

I've seen a decent amount of same-sex snugglebunny romance at raves.
Certainly more than I've seen any Van Halen concert (and believe me...).  
I've never seen anyone hootin' or hollerin' about gayness at parties...but I
reckon it's a matter of where people doing the snuggling feel more
comfortable doing it...on the floor at Club Universe, or at a party where
the gay population is less than 99%.

Let's not forget where this scene originated...in the black clubs & the gay
clubs.   I'm sure there's a folk or two on the list who would supply us with
a complete archive of dance music history.  :o)

A few more thoughts...

As I was sitting eating lunch just now, I realized another
difference between our parties and clubs in general -- but 
even more specifically gay clubs.

We go to parties to see our friends and dance.  Very few people
(in their right mind anyway  ;^) go to parties to meet someone
in order to either a) start a relationship or b) find a sexual
partner.  

Ravers aren't out there looking for sexual partners as part
of the party experience.  

In gay clubs, that's different.  In the gay social world, 
cruising is a fact of life.  When you go out, you are looking
at people and being looked at.  And the standards of sexual
activity and partners are much looser then in your average 
straight world.  In a gay club, you are pretty much either 
cruising or being cruised... heck, that's one of the things
I like about gay clubs, I get to look at all the beautiful men
with my gay male friends, and people are pretty overt about it.
(of course for me, it's mostly window shopping!  but I have made
some of my greatest friends at gay clubs)

Plus, many gay people usually live some aspect of their
lives as a lie in some way, not showing the affection they want
to their lovers, not always knowing if the person they're talking
to is also gay, and therefore a possible lover ... watching what
they say at work, etc.  When you live your outside life like that,
you want to totally be free to express yourself when in safe
territory like a club that is specifically gay. 

To me, that explains the freedom of expression that you feel
when you're in that kind of place ... it's freer than cruisy
straight clubs, and sexier than parties where the music and the
dancing is what brought us together.

Frankly, I like places where there are more mixed clubs ... Seattle
is pretty good for clubs where there's a little of everything...
that's the way I like it best!

Timothy,

I wish I was wearing my mint-flavored shoes!  Eeep!

Seriously, I didn't mean to suggest that the tone was condescending to
ravers... but I just re-read my message and I guess it might look that way!
When I was talking about the "tone" of the Berkeley Guide, all I really
meant was that guide applies to young coolsters traveling around who want to
soak in the local color...whether it be the snarling punkers on Tele, or
whatever wacky parties are the rage.

> "One person's lifestyle is another's vacation, I guess."

I just looked at this (what I said earlier) and realized that I sound like
some bitter old skool grump.   But honestly, I was looking at it objectively
& completely without emotion. (is that redundant & repetitive?) 

I swear, I'm not one of those "we must protect our scene from outsiders"
typa guys!  I was actually quite proud when I saw the thing about raves,
just as I always am when our scene is mentioned in the context of society as
a whole.

Recognition is good!  (well, we could argue about the 20/20 thing...)

Thanks for keeping me honest!

Actually, while I've never kissed a man, when I would be at a rave and
partaking, and if I was talking to a guy who was also partaking, I liked
to run my fingers through their hair.  It's just a warm, affectionate,
non-sexual gesture that I enjoyed and that they always seemed to enjoy. 
I'd tell them that if it bugged them I'd stop, but they never minded it,
and after a while I'd bop back out on the dance floor.

On the flip side, it was a matter of what seemed appropriate and
acceptable at the time, and the crowd and feel of raves has changed much
in the past few months.  What got me so incredibly immersed in raving
was the people and the openness that I felt, the complete lack of
barriers, the total acceptance and love (*there's* an overused word,
albeit appropo) that I felt there, and this sort of physical attention
was very in keeping with the tone of the parties I frequented.

Hello all,

I consider myself a human male.  I love kissing other attractive humans.  I 
personally feel that kissing is a very sensual experience, and I love to do 
it.  If the situation presents itself, and I am attracted to someone, we 
will kiss.  I have kissed a man before, and I would say that I would do it 
again if the situation was right.  It matters very little what the sex of 
the person I'm attracted to is.  I really don't care if they are 
straight/gay/male/female/transgender/etc... only the level of attraction, 
and the occasion are important.

My personal prefrences are my own, someday perhaps I will be with men, but 
for now, it seems that I'm not.  Fine, whatever, I must only keep an open 
mind to whatever situations reveal themselves to me, and handle them the 
best way I can at that time.

As far as this list goes, it seems that we are all mature about how we deal 
with others' sexuality and their preferences.  Besides, hugging and kissing 
is fun no matter who it's with right?

I agree with these posts, that although we are mostly open to new things, we 
are not entirely open to them.  I have said in the past that our scene is 
culturally, racially, (and sexually) diverse, etc... I still feel that the 
intent is there, but until _everyone_ feels comfortable at raves, I suppose 
I cannot claim that we are 100% diverse.  Compared to many other gatherings 
of people for the love of a musical genre, I strongly believe that raving 
represents some of the most positive and open minded thinking that can be 
found.  There is still more that we can do in regards to this though.

Thanks for listening.

Smiles,

Scott =)

okay, rob, you asked for it...   ;)

seriously, though--

i don't think the way to expand people's horizons in this area is to go up
to random people and kiss them.  i don't _think_ that's what you were
suggesting, but it could've been taken that way.

i _do_ kiss guys at raves, when they're into it.

my post was merely a comment on the gender gap i've observed in the area of
same-sex relations.

if you're trying to say "if you're not happy with a situation, change
things starting with yourself"-- i agree with that. i feel that my actions
in this regard are already in alignment with my principles, and i am, by
the action of writing these e-mails, encouraging others to think a little
bit about these issues.


love,

brian

I've always liked "Open Sesame" and "Brick House" by the Commodores. There's so

        Me too, but I guess you haven't seen it yet.

I took my girlfriend to Sunset on Sunday. It was her first rave.  She loved
it!  She thought it was the most positive "mixed-sexuality" experience she
has ever been to.  Everybody was hugging everybody and everybody made her
feel welcome.

Thanks to everybody who was there!

Concerning this issue of homosexuality at the Rave scene is a bit misleading
in my opinion.  First of all, I have only been apart of the scene since
February 14 and what I have observed while attending these incredible
exhibits of PLUR is nothing but acceptance.  I have read several other
responses to the question of homosexuality and most of them seem to be
leaning toward the negative.  Well, I prefer to examine the positive aspect
of the subject at hand. 

As a gay raver and as an active participant in displaying same-sex affection,
I have discovered several things.  1)  There are certain people who no matter
what setting they are in or what chemical is present in their body, seem to
still have hang-ups about sexuality.  This is not a bad thing because it can
be changed through vicarious learning.  We have to give them a chance.  2)
 Many guys that I have offered kisses of  love have been very receptive and
even enjoyed the experience.  And 3)  Homosexual activity is not condemned at
Raves and most people seem to be able to do whatever they want to do with
whomever they want to do it with.  

Therefore, Raves seem to be a good place to display one's sexuality no matter
what that may be.  I appreciate the atmosphere and all the love I have been
able to feel during the six Raves I have attended.  Plus I love all the
people I have met but may not remember due to "brain overload."  I look
forward to seeing all of you again.  

PLUR and keep the openness available,
Derrick

I don't know how I can possibly explain our weekend any further than Stariana 
and Lara already did!  Even the 14 hour drive down was fun, especially we 
stopped for dance breaks every 2 hours.  Star's beachouse is AMAZING!!!  I 
finally met Hadrian (Hi sweetie!), and finally threw away the icky tension that 
kept Lara & me from bonding (I love you Lara!).  We hit Venice beach before the 
rave and had tons o' fun even though it was cloudy.  And Hadrian & I ran across 
a little "rave stand" on the strip that sold glo-in-the-dark beads, neon (aka 
blacklight) nailpolish, and awesome unlabeled mixtapes for $5.  We bought a tape
called "Funky Beat Volume 1".  No track names or DJ's, but it's the best tape 
I've ever owned in my life!  Tiny bad things: Brett's van got broken into and we
cracked the cylinder heads from way too much driving way too fast (Brett:  I'll 
help you pay for the engine!  I'm sorry!), and Perry & Ryan and I had our 
conflicts (Wwhatever I did, I'm sorry boys! I still love you!)  Many 
thanks to Hadrian & Ryan for helping find to messed-up kids who needed 
love and bringing them into the tent.  Fernando: the world is filled with love! 
 Big up and much love to Marty, Usa, and Fina...Happy Kids love forever!  See 
you Saturday...

Peace & Much Love,
christine

I forgot!!! The people who really made the party were Marisol for drawing a big 
happy sun in my rave book, Sara for being the only person to ask if I wanted a 
bracelet (It changes color in the sun and had 'e' beads on it!), Scott for being
so happy when I said "yes, I'm giving away free hugs!", Jimmy for being so happy
we rescued him, Jesti for calling me to tell me she was okay, and John for being
the only person in Laguna Beach to talk to us and NOT think we were weird for 
dancing on the street corner.  I think that's it.  Much love to all who were 
there, all who wanted to be there, and all who were with us in spirit.  Thank 
you for making my first road trip happeee!

Peace & Much Love,

Overall I would say that raves are quite accepting of same-sex
affection and sexuality.  I have noticed two drawbacks to expressing
sexual/physcial affection toward someone of my same gender at raves:
	(1)  There seems to be a group of males who have a genetically
instilled fantasy about two women being together sexually.  Whenever I'm
making out with someone who is also female, these males seem to feel
compelled to try to come over and "join in."  I have no problem with
people desiring to join the group I am part of because they find me or
someone else there an interesting and compelling human being.  I do have
a problem with feeling like that person is primarily interested in me/us
because I'm/we're "bisexual babes making it with another chick."
(Somehow this topic makes me fall into swinger lingo.  Don't ask me
why.)  Now, I'm not saying this is an attitude most men share, and
probably the proportion of raver males who act this way is even smaller
than the population in general, but nonetheless, it exists.
	(2)  My other problem is that there are a lot of people who E-xperiment
with people of their own gender at raves.  Some of them seem to have the
attitude "Well, it's okay if I make out with you as long as there's a
boy here too.  That means I'm not really gay."  That attitude really
annoys me.

Does anyone else find these to be true for them?

Sorry to take up bandwidth, but I stumbled across this a few
days ago, and it sums up all my emotions so perfectly...

"...not drowning, just tumbling around in the voices, like a=20
crowd in my head so loud; I wonder what it's like to be dead
- I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot - any remedy
you have, try it - just below my skin I'm screaming..."
					("Salva Mea" by Faithless)

I just hope you're all doing better than I am right now.

*hugs*

I haven't actually thought of labeling myself as 'Gay' in the rave scene. I
remember,
the first rave I went to, my first E, my first everything... I was all over
the place telling everyone: "Hi, I'm gay, is that ok?" now when I think
about it, I laugh. I don't think is nescesary anymore to
be asking wether is ok or not to be friends or to talk to someone even if
you are gay. I guess,
some guyz would go "hey man, I'm not gay.." or something like that if I was
to give them a hug (which happens in the non-rave world non-gay-world) but
I haven;t experienced that in the rave scene, nor have I seen it happening.

>From what I can see, the rave scene is very open minded torwards, sexual
orientation, race,
color, ethnicity, etc. The best thing to do is to be who you are and share
the best of  you with everyone. Don't separate yourself from anyone just
because you are different.

Oh well..my 3 cents :)
love and hugs
Pab

Thank you so much Lara. You mean the world to me, and so does a lot of
other people on this list. I just wish there was a party tonight so I
could see all of you, and just *hug* everyone (and perhaps get a=20
blowpop or two...). ;)

Hey robin, didn't know you were on sfrave! :)

Anyway, I totally know what you're talking about, I remember being at a
party one time with this sort of a situation, only to look up to find a guy
looking greedily down at us saying "Hey, uh, can I get in on this?"  I've
encountered this more than once.  I can't stand enjoying an experience with
people, to find someone who "wants to get in on the action," like we're in
an open-invite orgy or something.  C'mon people!  I've also had the
experience of kissing a woman, only to look up (once again) to find us being
stared at intently by some male who "digs it when chicks kiss".  I am *not*
here to put on a show, it's not like I'm having sex in the chill room!  I
simply love naturally connecting with people on this level, if that's the
connection that occurs, I've taken amazing (non-sexual) journeys with them
some of those times. :)

I have finally given in to peer pressure.  Life will never be the same
again. . .now I'll spend even MORE time reading e-mails and responding
to them. . .a curse or a blessing?  A bit of both maybe?  Could be
worse, I suppose. . .I could be spending this time watching T.V.  Did
you know there is a television show about the internet?  tv.com   It
reviews "hot" websites.  Is that sick, or what?  Talk about media
feeding on itself.  I think tv.com has a website too -- I'm not sure,
though.  Damn, now I'll have to check.  A website about a tv show about
websites.

I am glad to see that someone else also falls into swinger lingo when
they discuss this subject!  Or maybe it is just some illness that I have
inadvertently spread to Shawna -- some new version of Turret's Syndrome.

good day!

energy, imagination, passion, and wit are the fuel for the next 

                                warmth

we are in the proccess of creating another experience and we would like to 
ask the sfraves community for your collective knowing of spaces.  Tony and i
are in deep search of a space to create in and i thought that asking the 
people who may attend the party might be a good way 
to find that perfect, secure, and welcoming spot.  think back, all the 
good times, all the memories, all the wormth, what was your favorite 
spot, what is the perfect spot.  a vigin space is our preference but all 
your suggestions will be treasured.  no restrictions here, we want your 
imput unrestricted and completely yours. please e-mail me privately and  
thanks for the leads.

take a look at the sky above you the next couple nights, you'll be glad you 
did :)

be happy and be warm.
spencer K.

yes, i thing being self-conscious while in a chill room is a bit
self-defeating...

on the other hand, when someone directs a "predatory" attitude at your
loving vibe, it can make you uncomfortable.

i suppose a better question would be, "how do you deal with a situation
like that?"

you could:

a) ignore him
b) tell him to buzz off
c) invite him to join you
d) explain nicely that you are expressing your basic love for eachother as
friends, and it's not just a purely physical act to be shared with a
perfect stranger. (or however it is that you feel about it)

now, i think most of the time people choose (a), sometimes (b).  but i
think, assuming you don't want to do (c), that (d) is the way to go.  after
all, if you have a problem with the way Mr. Eyes is behaving, the only way
he's going to become aware of that and (possibly) change his behavior is if
someone explains it to him.  and if not you, who?

also:

haven't we all been in the position of feeling unloved and
affection-deprived?  a lot of guys mask underlying self-esteem issues by
acting as sexual predators.
if you at least introduce yourself, be friendly, and explain how you feel,
you are showing him a kind of respect, which he needs.  ignoring him or
being unfriendly simply feeds the problem.

finally, imagine the following scenario:

i'm sitting in a chill room, kissing a loved male friend, only to look up
and find myself being intently watched by some female who "digs it when
guys kiss".

will it ever happen?  i don't know.  but i don't imagine i'd be bothered.

we do have a lot of dysfunctional gender roles in society.  at issue here
are: (a) men are socialized to view women as the passive gender, and to be
sexually agressive with them
(b) some people react to self-esteem issues by acting with a false (and
imposing) self-assuredness
(c) women are socialized to perceive male sexuality as a potential threat
(which, unfortunately, it sometimes is)

these problems are not going to go away until we break through the
underlying issues.  until we teach men and women to think of eachother as
equals.  until people don't need to prey on others in order to feel good
about themselves.

this starts with _you_.  show respect and communicate with people, even --
no, _especially_ -- the people who are acting in ways you find bothersome.

love,

brian


ps      i speak of the "unwanted spectator" as a male in this post because
that's the way it usually is.  to all those concerned with the sexist use
of pronouns, i in no way intend to imply that the role-reversed scenario is
impossible.

In order to make up my mind about going out Saturday night with my cousin,
for the 1st time in 5 years, I've narrowed my selection down to 4 choices:

(1.) Daft Punk/Jeno @ Mission Rock
(2.) Staying home
(3.) Cap n' Crunch
(4.) Going to LoveWorks- Still happening?

I am interested the most in Daft Punk- Can somebody shed light on them?

Later, Bill :-}

I think we are all Bi-sexual. Some choose not to act upon it while others do.
I feel that I have the ability to love another human no matter what sex they
are. If I meet a cute guy and there is something between us...cool. If i meet
a cute girl and there is something between us, great. Love is blind in my
opinion. I also have a lot of gay friends, and some have been open while
others are not. It justs depends on the party and who is there. =)

that's always been my theory! everyone's bi. some of us lean certain directions and 
we've all been conditioned by our family, peers, society, and the television to feel 
certain ways or we're not normal. i know every one of us has wondered about ourself 
once or twice...

Don't know much except their "Da Funk" is HUGE across the Atlantic. They are
from France. Some call it trip-hop, some call it electronica. I call it
worth seeing live. We should consider ourselves lucky to be in or near SF
where acts like these visit. Joe Bob says check it out.

Daft Punk are awesome.

They have a song in Wipeout XL which is "Musique", they have "Da Funk",
"Around the world", and that song with the police siren a the beginning
that turns into a 70s disco type techno. I love them. 

I will definately be there.

Where is it going to be held?!?!

-Byroni-

The two guys in the group are 21 and 23 I think.... and they made the
songs at home and wanted their music to be the kind that people listen to
in their bedrooms... :-)

Brian said..


finally, imagine the following scenario:

i'm sitting in a chill room, kissing a loved male friend, only to look up
and find myself being intently watched by some female who "digs it when
guys kiss".

will it ever happen?  i don't know.  but i don't imagine i'd be bothered.

-----------------------------------

Hey Brian,

What do you mean, will it ever happen?  I was watching you once in a
chill space ... maybe you don't know for how long ... but if you want
me to remind you when it was, I will  ;^)   .... and you actually did
invite me to join you...

And I agree, if you don't want people to watch you, then take it truly
private.  Some of us just love to watch (!) ....  

Now, I do prefer that people try to control how far they go in a chill
space... overt sexual behavior belongs in an environment where it won't
make anyone uncomfortable ...

...this is straight out of the liner notes on the WIPEOUT XL cd from
astralwerks (records)...

"Packing a kick meaty enough to put Cantona in the shade, French duo DAFT
PUNK prove Paris is ready to rock with the best of them and, no doubt, wear
a better class trousers while it does so.  Tracks like "Da Funk" and
"Musique" cause truckloads of havoc every time they blare from speakers,
those within earshot being left with few sensible options except to dance
like turbo-charged stick insects... erm, yes, we thought we'd better warn
you about that."

...the track "Musique" off the WIPEOUT cd is my first ever exposure to DAFT
PUNK and i thought it was a pretty humble track in its own right...sounds
kinda like electro-house...minimal...early Detroit techno sound...also i've
heard that their new album (i think it's called "Da Funk", but don't take
my word for it) is supposed to be pretty good...i guess you'll just have to
see them yourself and make your own judgement...i know i'll be there on
Saturday...

Personally, I always enjoy burritos from El Faro Mexican Fast Food.  The
steak fajita super burritos always take care of my starving student
appetites.
And if that doesn't work, then I just read John Howard's neat
"Foodspotting" articles on where to eat from the king of beats :-}

I beg to differ.  If there were ever a forum where one could define
one's true sexuality, this is probably it, and I can honestly say that I
am not bi-sexual.  I am 100% hetero and very comfortable that way. 
That's not to say that I'm not curious as to what it must be like, but I
have many times tested my feelings towards another man and I have never
found myself attracted sexually.

So while I'm glad for you that you are comfortable expressing your
sexuality, I don't share your particular tastes.

No offense, my friend, but I find your generalization to be similar to
men that think lesbians are women that just haven't had a good male
lover yet.

actually, this isn't actually true.  if you've never heard Daft Punk, you
can get your first exposure to them by getting a RealAudio player and
pointing your web browser here:

if you all like that, i've got another Astralwerks promo of more French
stuff on my desk i can put on the site...


enjoy all,

Is it possible to be funny while still being "p.c."?  So much of American 
humor is at expense of people or utilizing stereotypes - the challenge is 
making people laugh without resorting to these "easy" laughs.  It's 
cultural - look at British humor, for example, so much physical slapstick 
and comedies of "manners."  And Americans don't get it, by and large!

   Their album "homework" came out this week on Virgin, Musique the track on
a couple of the astralwerks comps isn't on the album, Da Funk is their big
hit, went top 10 in the UK. Getting loads of press, I think they are kind of
trying to be sold as the french chemical brothers (seemingly based solely on
the fact that they are both duos).. going for the crossover market.... da
funk was recently added to Live 105's playlist.  In any case i think it is
top stuff and definetly worth checking out!

Earlier this year, the dazed crew of a Japanese Trawler was plucked out of
the Sea of Japan clinging to the wreckage of their sunken ship. 

Their rescue, however, was followed by immediate imprisonment once
authorities questioned the sailors on their ship's loss.  To a man they
claimed that a cow, falling out of a clear blue sky, had struck the
trawler amidships, shattering it's hull and sinking the vessel within
minutes. 

They remained in prison for several weeks, until the Russian Air Force
reluctantly informed Japanese authorities that the crew of one of its
cargo planes had apparently stolen a cow wandering at the edge of a
Siberian airfield, forced the cow into the plane's hold and hastily taken
off for home. 

Unprepared for live cargo, the Russian crew was ill-equipped to manage a
now rampaging cow within its hold.  To save the aircraft and themselves,
they shoved the animal out of the cargo hold as they crossed the Sea of
Japan at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

> everyone's bi.

        I disagree. Everyone certainly has the potential to engage in
        bisexual acts, but not everyone is inclined to do so under normal
        conditions (like when members both sexes are available).

        Are *you* bisexual? Find out for yourself with my patented test
        for checking your own sexual orientation! All rights reserved.

        No hands allowed! Fantasize about having sex with an attractive member
        of the opposite sex. Give it a decent 5 or 10 minutes at least. Get
        into it.

        Question 1 (boys) > Are you hard?	Yes or no?
                  (girls) > Are you wet?	Yes or no?

        No hands allowed! Fantasize about having sex with an attractive member
        of the same sex. Give it a decent 5 or 10 minutes at least. Get
        into it.

        Question 2 (boys) > Are you hard?	Yes or no?
                  (girls) > Are you wet?	Yes or no?

        If you answer yes to question 1, no to question 2, you are straight.
        If you answer no to question 1, yes to question 2, you are gay.
        If you answer yes to both, you are bi.

	If you answer no to both either you are asexual, 
	you didn't give it enough time,
	or you should go on to part 3 :

        No hands allowed! Fantasize about having sex with an attractive gray
        alien of indeterminate sexuality. Give it a decent 5 or 10 minutes at least. 
	Get into it...

 Here's my variation on Rob's test 
   - everywhere it says "fantasize about having sex with" , replace with  
     "fantasize being married for the rest of your life to".
   - Replace "Are you hard?"/"Are you wet?" with "Are you blissed out?"

 Ten minute fantasy sex is easy ... An imagined lifetime of marriage is
harder ( and sometimes more humid as well ... :-)  ).

I beg to differ w/Todd's differing with Jondabomb's statement that we
are all bisexual in some way...

SDream's paragraph was...

I beg to differ.  If there were ever a forum where one could define
one's true sexuality, this is probably it, and I can honestly say that I
am not bi-sexual.  I am 100% hetero and very comfortable that way. 
That's not to say that I'm not curious as to what it must be like, but I
have many times tested my feelings towards another man and I have never
found myself attracted sexually.


I believe that 99% of us are bisexual in some way .... to me, having curiosity and testing feelings
towards someone of the same sex, is a small percentage of bisexuality, at least it's an
openness to the possibility, and to do that you have to think about it.  

I have one friend who swears he's 100% gay ... and yet, he's had sex with women in his younger years,
and admitted that a certain kind of woman, in a certain situation, might interest him even today.

So maybe you are two examples of the people at the far end of the spectrum... that is, maybe
you're 99.9% straight, he's 99.9% gay ... and that .1% of experimentation comes in those thoughts
that go through your head occasionally.    Others might truly be 50/50 in their thoughts and
their actions, and some may be 90% one with just a 10% dabble in the other.

Remember Jimmy Carter, admitting that he lusted in his heart, even though he was married?
You don't have to act on your feelings to have them be a part of who you are.

Concourse,
The location alone should be reason enough to check out this event 
(ahh, memories of Pure 92' come to mind...).

The only setback is...   Does anyone know if this is going to be an 
allnighter, or will the lights come on @ 4???

You know..

   You all actually have it really good..
  ME! On the other hand.. If I am caught walking into the chill room with a
girl.
 The rumors spread though the whole ravE in a matter of minutes.. Next
thing I know.. Everyone is spectating.. Romance for me at the ravEs, is
allmost not an option.
 I really have trouble meeting someone at the ravEs, with all my mentors
bugging me..
 Does this happen to everyone? Or am I the only one that gets constantly
criticized about who he is with, what he is doing, ect..
 Bottum line though.. I can not hit it off at a ravE. It's like I am on
stage.. No privacy...

One of the most amazing things about SFRaves is how we all keep _talking_. 
The thing is really just one long conversation, with posts that turn into
threads that spawn other threads and on and on into infinity.  The
conversation never stops.  There's never an awkward pause, a silence
indicating the conversation is over.  No-one ever has to say, "someone
think of something to say!" 

It's the longest dinner table conversation in history.  500 blabbermouths 
seated at the table for five years now, and we haven't shut up yet!

That is true..

BUT!!
  Now.. If I was the shipping clerk at a technics warehouse or

Wife 1.0 runs much better of course if Lover 1.0 is also present on the

which also protects the p.c. integrity  of your PC. (sorry but Cat 2.0 or

I just wanted to thank everyone for their support last night. I've=20
never felt so loved before in my whole life. THANKS! *HUGS* *HUGS*

I'm happy to let you guys know that I know feel a lot better, not
just because of everyone's email (which helped a lot of course!),
but also because I talked to my ex gf (hey Molly!), and we figured
a few things out, and things are a lot cooler than they were last
night... =3D)

Question: Is anyone else going to Symbiosis this weekend? A friend
of mine from back home (Sweden) is coming over, and I want to take
him to a party in SF. Plus, it would be an opportunity for me to
thank all of you in person!

Before I leave for class, let me share with you what Larry (Ching)
sent me last night... It was SO funny. Thanks again Larry!

I wasn't saying that it's not possible to be both funny and p.c. at the
same time but being in America much of the jokes/funny things I hear isn't
p.c. so I just take it for what it's worth. A long running example would
be a joke between a buddy of mine and me (PLEASE NO FLAMES ON THIS WE BOTH
SAID THIS IN JEST), regarding how it would be really screwed up if either
of us told our girlfriends that they were just a "in-the-meanwhile girl";
both of us love our girlfriends very much but we find it funny to say
something neither of us would even seriously think about doing. I also
like some british humor that I have seen on the television. I feel life is
too short so I enjoy it for what it's worth!

And Leslie I don't think you are a cranky ***** momma the post was
actually directed at people who felt offended by the humor post.

I differ 100% from Leslie in this regard.  I think people are what they
are.  Some people may have bi-sexual tendencies, but there are those of us
who are 100% heterosexual.  Just because one has a homosexual experience
does not mean that they are bi-sexual, IMO.  As for being open to the
possibility?  I am not, thus I do not have any inclination toward the same
sex.  I do however think that some men are handsome, but once again, I
don't think that the appreciation of beauty can ,in any way, denote one's
sexuality. The only thing it could possibly reflect is my taste or
aesthetic.

Then he *may be* bi-sexual.  But there are men who have had sex with other
men at some time in thier lives, and would say that the experience would
never be repeated.  Does that make them a closet bi?  I doubt it.  Same for
some women I know who became lesbians over time; after some soul-searching
of course.

I think a lot of this is hype from the non-het community, in an effort,
mostly political, to convince people they are something they are not.

I have met bi men and women, and just like thier heterosexual and
homosexual counterparts they have had these feelings from birth.  For
whatever reason, I think people know what they like and who they like it
from/to.  Yes, some may be 100% bi, some 100% homosexual, but let's not opt
out of the 100% hetero category, one which applies to me, and I'm sure
plenty of others.

Interesting, although I think we are more of the norm than anything (if
there is such a thing).  I think that people know what they are and we are
the 65% who know where we stand, be it straight, bi, or homosexual.

Or it could very well be that the people who think we are on the fringe
could be on the fringe themselves thinking that some memebrs of the
population are not what they say they are.  I mean, when did it become a
crime to be proud to be straight.  Sheeit, I love being straight, as much
as any homosexual man loves his sexuality, as much as anyone identifies
with thier sexuality.

This is all political to my eyes.

>
>Remember Jimmy Carter, admitting that he lusted in his heart, even though

Does that mean he cheated?

>You don't have to act on your feelings to have them be a part of who you are.

So he really is an adulterer because he thought it?  And people could be
murderers because they think but dont act on it?  How many real murderes
are there?  Then the question arises, are we what we think or how we act?
What are we if our actions are different than thought?  then of course the
final question arises Who are we?

See here's the problem, and I think it stems from religion to some extent.
To me, thinking something is nott the same as acting on it.  If I have
recurring fantasies about sleeping with men, that could mean many things.
If I act on it, and it is a part of who I am and I also enjoy the company
of women, that is another thing.  Thinking and acting on things, to me, are
two seperate things.

But, diff strokes for diff folx...I guess.  Since this society is so
sexually repressive, I don't think we will ever get an accurate reading as
to who's who and what's what. I think that about some % is straight, some
homosexual, some bi, and a portion of the population thinks about these
options in some form but don't act.  Actual figures will vary depending
upon factors such as politics, agenda, culture of the respondent,  openess
to ones inner truth, the statistician, bias, and a number of other factors.

The world may never know.

Your honor, I rest my case.

Peace,
John

I would be so lenient in my definition that I would allow that one's
sexual preferences can be defined by one's desires as opposed to one's
actions.  Since I would still maintain that at no time have I ever been
sexually attracted to another man, by that definition, I am still 100%
hetero.  

Like it matters.  I'd hug anyone regardless of their position in that
spectrum of degrees between full hetero- and full homosexuality, and I
would expect the same love and respect back regardless of my position.

Y'know, for those who are reading this and thinking, "Ok, this has
wandered completely outside the realm of what I was looking for when I
joined this list," my apologies.  I love Leslie to pieces and couldn't
resist that first line.

Anyway, curiosity does not define a person.  I'm curious what it would
be like to live in Japan, but that in no degree makes me Japanese.

Yeah, me too, but it's because I've got too much work to do and it's all
tedious and irritating.  I needed a break.

It's difficult for me too!

Every time I go out, there are swarms of ladies in scantily clad booty
huggers trying to get close to me...sometimes they are not the one...I also
think that I can be the one...for them it's almost not an option...I can't
resist and think maybe they can't too...everything can be an option if I
think hard enough...but I usually don't have enough time since I could very
well be the one...or is it the two?...my brain hurtz...does OJ still do
those commercials...I'm tired of everyuone watching me at raves...next
year, I'll stay home...hey where are all those ladies?  Does this happen to
you too?

I hope it never happens to me again....

Just funnin',
John

Okay, so what about this sitation:  In all honesty, it is a sort of 
fanasy of mine to make out with another female as my boyfriend watches 
and maybe hers too. Of course I would be totally enjoying her attentions, 
but part of the excitement is knowing I am also turning on the man I 
love!  I think that if all parties involved know what is going on and is 
consentual about it, "watching two chicks kiss" can be quite erotic and 
sometimes it can be equally erotic to be the one putting on the show.

Thank you. I'm glad someone finally said this right. :)

Sorry to throw in nothing but a "me too!" post, but I had to cheer
you on for sticking up for those us who are quite comfortable with
our positions on the Kinsey scale.

sexual orientation is a fluid and wholly individually-defined thing which
resists strict categorization.

"gay", "straight", and "bisexual" have as much to do with social
self-identification and personal politics as they do with sexual activities
and preferences.

i, too, believe that people are not born heterosexual, homosexual, or
bisexual, just sexual.

but as far as i'm concerned, people who think of themselves as straight,
are, by definition, straight, and so on.

it's much too complicated for objective tests.  none of us has any right to
tell someone else that they are a different sexual orientation than what
they consider themselves, because self-identity is the only test that can't
be argued with.

of course, some of us don't like labels and can never figure out _how_ we
identify ourselves... the fact that i don't consider myself gay or straight
doesn't necessarily mean that i consider myself bi, either.

just some food for thought,

brian

	I'm announcing a party at the same place those other Sunday parties at
Berkeley were. This is gonna happen tonite, so, I hope you check your
e-mail. It's just a little party, cruise on over if you're in the area.
It's at 2422 Ridge Road in Berkeley. It will get going around 9pm and go to
whenever it dies down. This is a birthday party for two special DJ's who
happen to share the same birthday today. Happy birthday Kenni and Craig.
It's free, so be sure to bring good vibes for all of us to share. It will
probably be pretty small, after all, it's really just an overblown birthday
party.

	Directions?   Take the University exit off I-80, head towards campus.
			Go all the way up University.
			When you reach the campus, turn left(at the light)
			Take the next right onto Hearst.
			Take the left onto Euclid.
			Take the first left onto Ridge.
			It will appear soon on the left, an unusual tannish building.

	You can also come early around 8pm if you want to meet and help set up and
such. It's up to you. Knowing Kenni and Craig, some really cool DJ's
besides them may also show up. So come on down if you got nothing to do
this Wednesday night.(Or if you're like us, it's your spring break and you
ain't got SHIT to do!)

Greetings. I was wondering if people posting to SFRaves (especially
party promoters) could avoid using things like colors and bold print
in their email messages. Many of us use text-only mail readers (like
on a UNIX account) or have mail programs that don't support text
layout like underlining, etc.

For example, 

<color><param>6666,3333,0000</param>********</color>
<bold><color><param>FFFF,0000,0000</param>KING</color></bold><color><param>F=
=46FF,0000,0000</param>
</color><color><param>6666,3333,0000</param> ****</color>
 
may look like bold print and colors to you, but to me, it only comes
out looking like control characters. It just makes things very very
hard to read, because sometimes the information is buried beneath all
of the control characters and stuff.

Thanks! :)

Steve

Hey all,

Does anyone know if any of the events this week(end) will include any
jungle? I don't recognize any of the DJs listed on any of the events on the
calendar as playing jungle.

Also, does the SF in the last line of the listing for Comet mean that the
event will be in San Francisco?

Looking forward to a great weekend with friends from out of town,
Terrence.

I thought I'd take the plunge, and check out another scene last
night. My girlfriend, who is very much into the gothic scene, finally
convinced me to go with her last night to Roderick's Chamber, a small
weekly gothic/industrial event held on Tuesday nights.

She had invited me to go many times before, but I had always worried
that I wouldn't have such a good time. Well, I knew I'd like the music
(Even though I've been raving for a good 5 or 6 years now, I've always
listened to a lot of gloomy industrial)... But being a raver, I sort
of had this notion that goths go to clubs and leer at each other all
night. And I certainly knew I'd be underdressed for the event (not
owning any black PVC pants or leather boots).

But I went anyway (I found something black I could wear). And I had a
great time, so I thought I'd share my impressions of a scene that is
usually thought to be 180 degrees opposite to our rave scene.

Things I saw:
1) People greeting friends with hugs.
2) People respecting the space.
3) Friends meeting, laughing.
4) People dancing to music they love.
5) Smiles.
6) People (both men and women) looking beautiful
7) People who could dance, and make it look like an art.
8) A well tuned sound system.
9) Beautiful handmade Victorian(?) era clothing.

Things I didn't see:
1) Bad attitudes.
2) Taggers.
3) Gangstas taking way to much space with breakdancing (please, no flames).
4) Teenage kids fucked up on weird drugs.
5) Dirty dancing.
6) Flyers either shoved in my face or littered on the floor.
7) The DJ. (this was a bit weird)

I met many people I knew that night, danced a little (though, being
used to 180BPM jungle makes it hard to dance to 100BPM gothic), and
had great time. I heard some really good music spun, like Haujobb,
Dead Can Dance, Siouxsie, Sisters of Mercy, some local music, and lots
of other stuff I can't name. 

Visually, there were your typical dance club intelli-beams, but
all-in-all, fairly minimal lighting. There was also a vendor, selling
jewlery and accessories (yes, lots of silver crosses). Most people
dressed in full-on goth gear: lots of PVC, velvet dresses, and white
face powder.

So anyway, that was my gothing experience. Hopefully I'll do it again,
and get to participate rather than observe next time. 

as always, just trying to broaden my horizons. :)

Steve

Wow!  And here I thought I was expanding the psychedelic parameters of
email... my apologies to anyone else who uses a text only e-mail reader.  I
also biffed the date on the King Kong BSP, so I'll post it again "sans
colours".

This is so hysterical today, thank you LORD!!  

I am sitting -- smiling ear to ear -- reading about Todd's being 100% sure
he's 100% straight (dude, you're the one who knows!),
and John responding to me talking about Jimmy Carter lusting in
his heart ... and Brian kissing Ran or DeepFog at some orgy party
that people are probably  gonna save their money so they can make
sure not to miss out on advance tickets..  or everyone kissing whoever the hell
he/she wants (long as it doesn't go too far in the chill space, dudes!)
and someone I think said I'm a lesbian (which I'm not, not that
it matters to anyone!) and Mr nStuff thinking the whole world is waiting
to watch him making out in a chill room ....

And I get this picture in my head ...  of a 14-year-old newbie raver
who's just come onto the list, or a newcomer who wants to learn about
our scene, and these topics are just about as far from their reality as 
you could possibly get...

and their eyes are getting wider and wider ...  

and I'll know who they are when I meet them at a party sometime, cuz
they'll be afraid of being seen talking to me, and that wide-eyed, oh
 my god look will come back when we're introduced...

and thank you all, it's making my day!!!!

And.. best of all, I am seeing what to me is the best of SFRaves, which
is many perspectives and experiences, talking and sharing about things
that really do matter in our lives ... and no one is being mean or petty (at
least publicly!) .... and I'll miss you all so much when I lose my email
on Friday!  Oh well... 

;^)

Leslie

ha he,

I've to Roderick's, too, about 3 or 4 times, and always had a good time.
Steve, better than Man Ray, eh?  Which is where you probably where you
got the preconcieved notion on how goths would be.  It's really
different out here than back east, isn't it?  The last time I went to
Man Ray, they moved Chris Ewen, who is still the DJ, up and away and
above the middle bar in the big room where you A. can't see him, B.
can't get up there.  Check out Labyrinth, which is Fridays at Maritime
Hall, I think.  The same smiling goths go there, too.  The best thing
about S.F. goths is that they love to make fun of the themselves and the
fact that they are gothic.  Cool crowd.  Lots of ravers used to be
goths. Like me, you remember the D.D.T. days.......

check out this URL, it would make the pastiest goth crack a huge smile!
http://www.scenario.com/eric/goth/index2.html

Sorry that I "replied to all" but I think that the list would appreciate
the fact that you are not alone.

Thank you to Steve on behalf of all us UNIX users!  Although I would like
to read these messages, I always delete because swimming through all the

In my previous post I talked a lot about same sex love and Rave openness, but
I failed to mention that I also believe that it is okay for gay people to
kiss and hug people of the opposite sex.  It only promotes and expresses the
complete freedom that is present during a Rave.  Yes, I am gay and I kiss
girls at Raves and I have no problem doing it.  The real issue here is not
homosexual activity at Raves but instead, all the forms of "affection through
connection" no matter who you are, what your preference, or who you are
connecting with.

I wouldn't presume to speak for Shawna, but for my own part it is not so
much someone watching me as they way they are watching.  There is a look
that is admiring and benign and then there is a look that is predatory,
demanding.  I think females tend to be more sensitive to this
distinction.  When you are walking down a street there will (likely) be
people who think you are attractive.  Some of them will look at you in
an admiring and harmless way and some with look at you with a gaze that
invasive, insistent even when you have given body signals that you are
not interested.  I think some of the problem arises because some males
(some people in general) are just really bad at reading body signals and
don't know they are not wanted unless someone says it to their face.

We are all pansexual, omnisexual.  As Freud so elegantly put it,
polymorphously perverse.  I don't know if you know who Annie Sprinkle
is, but I was reading something where she was telling about the time she
had an orgasm from making love with the sky.  She says she makes love
with everything -- stars, wind, sun.  It is society that narrows our
sexuality -- directs it first toward solely other humans, then solely
the opposite gender (then often times only to people of your race,
nationality, religion, etc).

Thought I'd crawl out from under my rock for the sake of prostituting
myself:

	I am graduating from Stanford this June with an interdisciplinary
degree in computer science and studio art.  I have a strong background in
multimedia (what else, yeesh... ;), and am looking for work in the
HCI/UI/VideoGame/Web design industries.  I would like to live either in SF
or Berkeley (I've had enough of Palo Alto, thank you), and would prefer
not to have a long commute to work. 
	Any leads, ideas, contacts, or pithy -isms you could send my way
would be highly appreciated (and will result in an instant boost of
karma).
	My resume is available at
	
	http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~gonzo/resume.html 

	Thanks, and take care!  


	See you at the BBQ n' Beats campout (if not before...).

Becoming sexually aroused by objects or concepts is a consequence of
being overly wrapped up in one's masturbatory fantasies. I think
nature is beautiful, but equating that with sexuality is not correct.

One cannot make love with the sky. The sky does not feel. Imagining
that the sky is making love back to you is masturbation, plain and
simple.

Not that there's anything wrong with that......;)

Hello all...

Well the sphincter police at my job have pounced upon my massive email 
habits...(only a matter of time I suppose)...So, I'm being forced to give up 
sfraves...ack!

I'm going to miss this quite a lot actually, and I'm going to run out and 
buy a computer as soon as I can so I can get my fix once again...

So, until next time - I love you all very much, and hope to hook up with 
everyone at a party soon...Try coming down to Wish on Wednesdays and ask for 
me!

Hugs & Smiles,

Scott  :"-(

p.s.- Here's my email just in case anyone needs it otherwise...

Sorry - I just can't help it!

In a message dated 97-03-26 09:04:20 EST, you write:

<< everyone's bi. >>

I'd like to voice disagreement, but for a different reason...  Not everyone
is bi because there are plenty of people who do not identify themselves in
terms of a bi-polar gender system.

My 2 sense...is that gender may not exist except for what we say it is.

I don't think anyone has any problem with consensual situations.  Now,
the person who made the original complaint about this situation will
make the following confessions:  _I_ get turned on "watching two chicks
make out."  I get turned on watching two boys kiss.  I get turned on
watching most anyone who is reasonably attractive kiss. (Does that about
cover it?  Does _anything_ not turn me on?)  BUT I make it a point not
to watch people kiss in an invasive way, to not watch if they are giving
off signals that they do not want to be watched, and I certainly
wouldn't presume to try to join their scene just because I like it when
two (or three or four or. . .) chicks (or boys or whatever. . .) kiss
(or whatever :)

well, because I could not imagine myself doing anything more than *JUST* 
kissing someone of the same gender, I consider myself fully 
heterosexual.  I think it was Brian Denny who mentioned that you could 
still be considered hetro even if you find yourself making out with 
someone of the same gender one evening.  To do anything more with a girl 
gives me the hee-bee-gee-bees. ;)

I think the point is to recognize that sexual
feelings/thoughts/experiences can be generated in you by interaction
with _anything_ not just other human beings.  First, let me say that
some people might disagree with the sky not being able to make love back
with you.  I am not one of them, but some people would say that the sky
does have a spirit.  Having said that, I agree with you that the sky
(probably) can't feel.  So it is masturbation if you define masturbation
as having sex in a situation where you do not have a partner that is
also feeling sexual feelings.  Of course, calling it masturbation does
not diminish the feeling.  Unfortunately I have not reached a level of
sexual advancement :) where I can fuck the sky, but I would suspect that
people who have experienced it would say it is a vastly different
experience that applying friction to your clitoris (or whatever
equipment you got) with a hand.

I think our sexuality, like a beautiful conversation, is fluid and moves to
different places from time to time.  I could be sexually attracted toward a
person of the same sex this morning, and have it be a different person
tonight.  And tomorrow, it'll be the sky...

actually, my idea is that you are straight if you think of yourself as
straight, no matter who you have sex with.  so yes, you can kiss your
female friends (or whatever) and still call yourself heterosexual.

it's not a matter of _what you do_, it's a matter of _who you identify
yourself with_, or, more fundamentally, _who you are, according to you_.

i choose not to call myself straight, gay, or bi, because each of those
terms identifies me with a group of people of relatively homogeneous
preferences (in society's eyes, at least), and my feelings are often vague
and fickle.

your feelings are more clear.  you are not attracted to women, except
perhaps to a verly limited extent under very limited circumstances.  to
you, this makes you heterosexual.  and that's all that matters.

love,

brian

	Well, not to belittle pine or anything, but some unix mail readers do 
recognise the "Content-Type: text/enriched" header, and flush all the stuff that 
can't be displayed...  I won't mention any manufacturers...

PS on the other hand, I'm not going to delete my .sig either  :-)

PPS The netscape mail reader also does color, on unix, but it isn't text-only...

PPPS nor do I mean to invalidate the request for text-only messages...  just 
defending my heritage...  unix is a bit beleaguered right now...

	I'm not sure I agree that your own definintion is all that matters.  I
think it is important to consider other people's definintions of us
because it can help us see ourselves more clearly and think about
ourselves in different ways.  While I support Amy's right to label
herself in any way she chooses, I also think that it is important for
her to understand that there are people who would consider her bi under
their definitions.  Some people would say that being able to experience
any sexual/romantic feelings toward someone of your own gender makes you
at least bi.  
	Then there is another problem here: if all that matters is calling
yourself what you want by your definintion, then language loses all
meaning.  It tells me nothing.  If a girl chooses to call herself
heterosexual but has been in a long-standing relationship with a female,
it is obvious that we have radically different definitions of the word
"heterosexual."  We might as well be speaking different languages.  Now
let me make it clear that I am not necessarily against the
deconstruction of language -- it's just going to make that communication
thing a bit harder. I'm also definitely not for the Kinsey het-bi-gay
continuum, but it is currently all we have to communicate our identities
with.

This is not a situation I've had a problem with, being with consentual
people as you describe, in fact it has happened and was just fine. :)  My
problem arises when some random person attempts to "get in on it" who is
not invited or wanted.

Well I don't really particularly like being stared intently at by a
stranger for no reason anyway, whether I'm kissing someone or not,
actually.  But that's just me.

(actually, more precisely, an l.a. raver) and he wanted to know where he
could find some good parties for tomorrow and friday night. as i know
nothing, i told him i would find out here. if anybody would care to e-mail
me back and tell me of anything interesting that would be marvelous. 
please and tank jou!!!
 okay and just one more thing, my friend sent me this and i thought it was
soooo pretty that i started to cry and i wanted to share.
okay, here ya go:

				a lover's dream
		as i sit and stare at the shimmering moon
		i also sit here and hope to see you soon
	 	then i realized i won't be able to see you tomorrow
		so i would sit here and cry in sorrow
		now i only uphold a dream which i hope comes true
		and that one dream is to be with you.

bye everyone, have a lovely wednesday evening! sweet dreams tonight!
***stariana***
with lots of love

I definitely find this to be a fluid thing, that shifts as time moves on,
according to how I feel at the time.  I don't think I could accurately call
myself just straight, just bi, or just lesbian (I could never be that, I
dig men too much! :).  There have been time when I've felt straight-up (no
pun intended) bisexual with no difference in interest between the two
sexes, and times when I've felt totally 100% straight where like Amy, I get
no sexual rise from the thought of women at all even if I still express
affection & friendship with women by kissing them.  It all seems to ebb &
flow, and really not confine itself to any particular definition found in
the dictionary.

I also don't necessarily believe that you are born one way or another
without exception, I think now that it can certainly evolve that way (and I
dont mean a situation where you turn lesbian after being fucked over by one
too many guys) as situations present themselves to you where you can make
new discoveries.  Like "Wow, I never thought about this kind of thing
before, but now that it's happening, it's pretty damn cool!"  This has been
the case for me, and a certain portion of it has had to do with me
questioning the reasons I feel certain ways to begin with.  Like did I
consider myself 100% hetero because I truly had no sexual interest in
females, or because I assumed I was hetero because I knew most people were
(according to what we've been told) and never thought to think otherwise?
I'm finding the latter to be more true, among other things, I'm happy to
say.  And of course, I've always had an appreciation for beautiful women,
as I have an appreciation for all things beautiful, which is just not
sexual.  There's just some people I want to have gilded & hung on my wall! ;)


Love
Shawna

hi all...

Thomas at the Trance and Jungle Factory wants to know if anyone would like to
put together an ad for XLR8R.  Mostly text- but some graphics would be great.
 Call him tomorrow at the store... (510)704-9876.  (between 11 and 10 ).  He
needs this ASAP, better call him tomorrow.  This would be a good oppurtunity
for someone who needs stuff for their portfolio.

Also- we send out apologies regarding the sf rave calendar posted at the
srore.  We think it is a good service to those who can't get access to
computers or who don't have a modem but still want to enjoy these special
little dance events we all love so much!

What follows are actual statements found on insurance forms where car drivers
attempted to summarize the details of an accident in the fewest words possible.

______

Coming home, I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't have.

The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intentions.

I thought my window was down, but I found out it was up when I put my head
through it.

I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.

A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.

A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.

The guy was all over the road and I had to swerve a number of times before I hit
him.

I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and headed
over the embankment.

In my attempt to kill a fly I drove into a telephone pole.

I had been driving for forty years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had
an accident.

As I approached the intersection a sign suddenly appeared where no stop sign
had ever appeared before.

My car was legally parked as it backed into the other car.

An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished.

I told the police that I was not injured but on removing my hat, found
that I had fractured my skull.

The pedestrian had no idea which direction to run, so I ran over him.

I saw a slow moving, sad faced old gentleman as he bounced off the roof
of my car.

I was thrown from my car as it left the road.  I was later found in a ditch
by some stray cows.

I totally agree, I've kissed girls at raves and I don't think it has been
a "SEXUAL" thing, but more like a Friendly, "connecting" thing :o)
after all, a Kiss is just a kiss...

actually, if you think about it, 
A Kiss can be a ,(coma) a ? (question mark), or !

I will be heading off to Paris next week and I was wondering if anybody is
clued in on the scene over there who could give me some places to go, DJs
to hear, etc. I only know of Laurent Garnier, but I'm guessing he's less of
a UG person these days. I'd prefer to find some UGs, so I don't end up at
Paris' Sound Factory equivalent.

We've gotten to this precarious position where if we complain about a joke
we are labeled P.C.  But, what if that joke really offends us?  Do we then
shut up and accept it just because someone else thinks it's funny?  It
saddens me to see any minority movement/voice being squelched by such a
backlash.  It only serves to put said movement/voice back in its place
where it belongs i.e. the minority.  So, I think it's sad when someone
says such-and-such joke offends them (and in a nice way at that), only to 
be told, "Like it or leave it."  Maybe those of us who find the joke funny
might want to try harder to understand why the other side
*doesn't* find the joke funny.  I'd certainly be willing to explain why I
didn't find the joke funny and how it relates to my life. 


Thanks,
Kirsten

Totally off-topic, but I guess that isn't stopping me!! :P 

Anyways, if anyone reads SFComix by Dan Assmussen in the Sunday Metro
section, he did a little comic about the rare and endangered "straight"
person.  It is REALLY, funny, totally tongue-in-cheek.  Actually, I
recommend this comic anyway because Dan Assmussen is hilarious and totally
takes the piss out of tons of San Francisco people and "cultures."  My
friends and I wait every sunday just for his comic!

i agree that it's important to understand how other people will perceive
one's labels.  many people don't understand the variety of possible sexual
preferences.  most people assume, if you call yourself "straight", that you
only have physical interactions with people of the opposite sex.  and to
some people, kissing members of the same sex makes one bisexual.  but i
think it's important that we try to make these people aware that not
everyone has the same definitions, and ultimately it's up to the individual
to decide how he/she wants to label themselves.

i personally do not call myself straight, i don't call myself gay, and i
don't usually call myself bisexual, precisely because of the preconceptions
people have about what those terms mean.  i prefer to go unlabeled.  if
someone asks me, i may say i'm bisexual, if i think the person i'm talking
to has a sufficiently broad definition of the term.  otherwise i say "i'm
go-with-the-flow", "i'm just sexual", or i try to explain how i feel about
the shortcomings of such labels.


love,

brian

hello, sorry to waste your time (again) but, oh, i simply must share with
all of you lovely people one more poem that my dear friend christina has
written.
this is called MOONSTAR:
	starlight starbright
	twinkle upon me so that i might
	grasp onto this dream that i create tonight
	may i be swallowed by the sky, a beginning with no end
	a translucent universe silent with no resistance to pretend
	let me play among the shadows, dance through the depths of peace
	swirling pools of innocence, smiling waters never cease
	a shining star i hold onto floating inside my dream
	reaching perils of vast existence to others, it might seem.


goodnight...

Most of me knows that this is a joke meant in fun.  But I can't hide:  the PC
in me is winning-out (oooooh noooooo!), and so out of love and respect for
our transgendered friends, I'm just going to say that word refers to a
person's gender identity and _not_ their sexual preference.  These animals,
as cute as they may be, don't have a thing to do with it!

but wait a minute... you forgot to indicate gender preference!

you need to print up buttons that say "kiss me if you're a girl...", "kiss
me if you're a guy...", "kiss me if you're an alien...", and "it doesn't
matter who you are, just kiss me..."

and since you mention "i'm Xing", how about "i'm sober, but you can kiss me
anyway, and i promise i won't try to get you into bed."  but who would
believe that one?

that's right, i'm not joking, i'm posing yet another thought-provoking
question: does "i'm on E" automatically makes a person more innocent and
trustworthy?
why is it that sober people tend to get left out of the love-puddles?  is
it because _they_ are less uninhibited and _they_ feel out of place, or is
it because other people assume that if you're sober you must have ulterior
motives?

discuss.


love,

brian

Well..  For some people, the scene dies all the time.. Then it just
comes back alive again.  It's all relative.  Everybody goes through
the typical rave stages.

1  Wow, everything is soo cool and positive.  I like the fancy lights
and popsicles.

2.  I'm starting to meet everyone... I love you all.

3.  Now its time to make hats and sell them, become a dj, or start 
promoting.

4.  Now youre sick of it.. The scene is dead..everyone is shady..  You 
start
talking shit.

5.  It's been a year and a half and you've found new light in the scene

6. You're back.

And the cycle keeps repeating itself.  Its so easy to get burnt out.. Isnt 
it?

What are you talking about?  Massives.. Commercialization.. same thing.
But who ever said commercialism was bad?  Every raver takes part in
their own "commercial" economy.  If you've paid money to get into a rave,
you've taken part in some form of commercialism.

I guess its just annoying to see my 'secret society' become the 11 oclock 
news,
and a new marketing scheme for Virgin.. But whatever..IT's good to see hard
working artists finally get what they deserve.  God bless em...

I don't think there is such a thing as underground anymore.
Which reminds me.. SOme one remarked about Godfather at the last
one track mind and said he was playing shit that you hear on the radio.
I said...  Oh really.

Oh.. Cool World.  Weren't they the ones that put a commercial on the radio?
And how can locations get better?  What we need to do is get the
government to subsidize raving..  You know.. It heals cancer and all that..

>I can't wait for that to happen. It will better our scene so much.
>And I will be there in the new scene with everyone else.

New scene.. Old scene.. It's all the same scene.
You know whats scary.. WHen you start singing a Smiths song
at a rave and the person next to you finishes the next verse.

Anyway, I hope I didn't offend anyone.  If you don't know me, I'm generally 
sarcastic- but not jaded.  I still love going out when I can...

Hah!   They have them promoted on TV all the time in Australia,  and on

are still more underground.

Just a note of agreement...I go out gothing myself occasionally, and it's
always a cool scene.  I was at Catacombs on Saturday (at the Transmission
Theater) and got to meet and chat with more friendly people than I do at a
lot of raves.  Possibly something to do with the fact that I look more like
a goth than not...there's something for the PLUR-minded to think about.

 Well I had the distinct pleasure of being invited to a church party 
recently (the valentine one). I went very sober and ended up in (to no 
surprise) in the ambient room. I napped a couple hours there and woke 
about 3 AM (missed Deaks set damnit!).

 As I was sitting there waking up I was wishing there was someone there I 
knew so I could get in a people pile (oh man I love those things!) In 
about 5 minutes StarChild walks in, comes right up to me and starts 
chatting. Next comes Will Penna and pretty soon we are all just flopped 
together like one big warm friendly bean bag chair. It was wonderful! And 
I was dead sober.

Willard -- I think you hit the nail right through the saviour's hand on
this one. I've been thinking about Wired (US) in exactly the same way
ever since they sold out to the major US media conglomerates (e.g.
Time/Warner). (This happened around the time that most of my
friends&acquaintances left Wired for other careers, so it's not like
i'm dissing my friends.) Fortunately, you were able to sum up the
problems with Wired in a much more poingnant fashion than I. I see
Wired as being the computer-wanker's version of Playboy magazine,
wowing us with the digerati's version of the silicone breast implant,
and making us long for the day when we could have the cohones and cash
to have a bit of digital perfection implanted in our own bodies, or at
least humming nearby as we plug-in to download the latest groupthink.
As if we should denigrate/ignore the results of millions of years of
evolution and heap praises on the shoddy engineering that got squeezed
in between cappucino's and marketing meetings at Intel and Microsoft. 

Actually, the comparison to Playboy is a bit unfair, since, beyond the
airbrushing, implants and exploits, that magazine has at least had some
groundgreaking reportage on issues of freedom/politics/repression in
our society. Wired, meanwhile has this sick attitude that the  benefits
of the crypto-libertarian utopia should be bestowed only upon those
Wired enough to be on the invite-list for all the cool corporate/media
parties at big national computer conferences... everyone else can rot.

That's why I'd rather be "Tired" than "Wired". It's good toilet
reading, or airplane-reading for when I'm too braindead from business
travel to read something with real content. It would be wonderful if
there was a "humanist" centered version of Wired -- an "Utne Reader"
for the digitally inclined.

I personally get a lot more out of reading the Communications of the
ACM, ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGGRAPH,  or IEEE Computer or even Byte. This is
where the real futurism lies. At least those magazines/journals have
the substance and rigor to *TEACH* the populace about the cutting edge,
rather than just namedropping and constantly reminding us about how
lowly and falling-behind we are compared to the inner-circle of
really-cool/hip people that comprise Wired and it's wankerati
following.

> defending my heritage...  unix is a bit beleaguered right now...

i don't think Unix is -- most internet servers are Unix, and a growing
number of desktops as well (especially outside the US)... i'm happily
running Red Hat Linux 4.1 and it rocks. In fact, I have an SGI indy
sitting right next to this PC and I'm preferring Linux running on this
pentium laptop to my SGI, which cost twice as much, requires twice the
memory, and isn't much faster. The other reason why I like Linux is
because I don't have to stand-on-my-head and stick my foot in my
bunghole in order to get secure internet connectivity on the Linux box,
and everything pretty much works and isn't buggy (meanwhile, any bozo
can crack an unfirewalled SGI on the internet) ... Irix is incredibly
braindamaged in comparison to this free OS (course Irix does rule over
Solaris). 

Goes to show you -- if you want quality -- make your software free and
public. Sell support and packaging and enhancements.

How 'bout "Kiss me if you don't have any weird sexual hangups that are
going to lead to a lawsuit and years of very expensive psychotherapy"

Hmmm, will all that fit on a button? ;-)

I am looking for someone in SF to part with their turntable for an OK
amount of money.
I am not looking for a Technics (too expensive) but any turntable that
works (Vestax, Gemini etc.) and preferrably has pitch control. Direct drive
is nice but not really important. 

I just need a turntable to listen to all the vinyl I bought here. Thanks!
Please reply to my email address directly.

I completely agree with Brian.

One or several same-sex experiences does not _make_ a straight person gay
or bi.  Who you are _primarily_ is what matters.  Many people experiment a
few times, but consider themselves straight overall.  I think it actually 
belittles other sexual orientations to equate a make-out session one 
night to a lifetime commitment and desire to be with people of the same sex.
It's primary identification that matters.

I'm straight, and I've been with women a few times.  I just think of it as
being an open-minded and sensual person!  I'm not interested in having a
girlfriend.  I'm not bi, because I can't imagine having a girlfriend for a 
while, and then maybe having a boyfriend.   I wouldn't presume to be part of 
the gay/bi community or experience just because I've enjoyed a sexual 
treat from time to time.  Because your orientation is not about a few 
sexual thrills.  It's who you are on the deepest level.

I was at a party in Santa Barbra a few weeks ago.  It was suppposed to 
be mostly an Excellent party and I had yet to partake.  I was dancing 
w/ this girl and we were hugging and having a fun time.  Then she asked 
if I was doing anything.  I said not anEthing and she got this weird 
look on her face and physically backed away. 
Jeez.  
We were having a good time and just because I was not doing anEthing 
she thought I was a creep.
Part of the reason I do Extra sutff is for physicall contact that I 
don't think I/we get enough of in daily life.  
I would like to let go of physical inhibitions without hElp. 
I don't want to "score" with every person I hug or am affectionate (sp) 
with.

As many of you know, I'm leaving the job that's given me access again
to email.  I'm looking for some solutions to this devasation!

I live in Albany (off Solano) ... and wonder if anyone has ideas for...
-possibly borrowing a computer from someone who's not using it for a while
-maybe someone is a neighbor and would let me drop by every day or two
to check/respond to emails
-suggestions of places where I can get very cheap access time to a computer
-or???

Help!  It's like moving away from your friends, especially since the last few
weeks on SFRaves have really been so positive and interesting.  Any ideas?

Otherwise, if you want my home phone, please let me know and I'm happy 
to give it to you...  

Oh, and you all have to promise to gossip about me when I'm gone..

Leslie

Yes Aniie Sprinkle, the ex-porn star turned merchandise maniac has done
more revisions to herself than Ingrid Elliot/Penny Morgan/Rachel Ryan (I
don't know if you know who she is...;) ).

I don't buy 100% into Freud.  He had some insights, most of which I think
were induced from Cocaine.

Oh yeah, I beleive Annie has made love to dozens of things, and hundreds of
people.  She's just a sexual creature and makes $$$ in marketing her
sexuality.

Oh well...


Het & loving it,
John

P.S.  Did I mention I like women? ;)

Subject: Long goodbyes to San Francisco.

WARNING: This is long, emotional, metaphysical (like all my posts).


"The more I get connected, the more I stand apart."

Does anyone else feel this way sometimes?

I'm about to move out of San Francisco, leave all the wonderful (and
frightful) times at the parties, clubs, and cafes of this city.  Recent
parties like Infinitely One, Ohmnisonic, Condensation, and others bring me
great joy for their warmth and vitality.  Thank you so much to their
organizers.

I've always been slow to catch on to what's popular or how I'm supposed to
act.  I just think differently and forget amazingly fast.  But I got
connected here in the San Francisco scene, fell in love quite a bit, and felt
like I was a part of things.  But I don't read Musik, wear imported shoes
with transparent soles, and no matter how much I hang out with
gays/bis/open-ended people I'm always going to be sensitive, male, and very
hetero.  Some stuff I've discovered in the "in" people of this scene really
was very "out" for me, including the blase openness to strange sex, crack
dealers, crystal and K, and closedness to all the big pop names and small
rock bands of back home.  I have the courage to say goodbye now and hello to
more fantastic fun and friends and loves even deeper.

Thank you to San Francisco, my heart and mind will always be here.  The
beautiful hills and the vibrant colors, the hundred bums I gave change to or
walked away from embrarassed or afraid, the Haight kid who offers small,
green buds on Ashbury, the DJ who made patronizing fun of me when he thought
I couldn't hear.  I say goodbye to it all.  I'll come back twice as wise,
with a heart that moves to even deeper beats.  I'll come back both more
material and more spiritual.

I want to say sorry to all the people I've hurt doing the wrong drugs at the
wrong parties.  I'm sorry for the quick goodbies, when I couldn't listen, and
to those pats, hugs, or rubs that were without heart.  But I won't wait for
forgiveness, because all that matters now is that I know that I cry inside
and that I am sincere.

All my goodbyes are really hellos in disguise.  A thousand friends and loves
in the past.  So many people from my past and future would say I am kind so I
will not hear another word about selfishness, disrespect, or the like.  I am
only growing wiser.  We all lay our own path to that eventual reunion, that
wisdom we reach when we die.

After all the Plurism and good vibes have faded, or should you ever forget
that there is astonishing warmth in this world, remember that time is
sometimes the best lover of all.  With time comes wisdom, an embrace so sweet
and mystical, that lovers' cries of ecstasy are lessened in comparison.

I believe in life.  I do.  I believe in giving.  I believe in energy with
peace.  That MDMA, I hope, has opened me up, brought me fresh joys and new
empathies.  I've stayed away from the worst addictions, perhaps out of a
wisdom, karma, or just because I haven't been initiated.  But I know that no
perversity can conquer me, no pleasure is too deep, no pain is more than a
moment when the light is not shining.  I believe in life and I will enter it
ever more the mystic, more entranced, more grounded in practicalities, more
taken with where I will go.  I will take with material greed and give with
spiritual bliss.  I pray not in churches now, but with my hands, my feet, my
music and my pen in the expanses of the city and the country.  And my prayers
are so much more expansive.  They are prayers of love now, not prayers of
guilt.

I am no child now.  My worship of the eternal is not through fear and
coercement but through the love of my body, the passion of time, and the
spirit that breathes through me from a thousand influences around me.  I
worship with something outside of me.  My tenderest soul is inspired by sweet
flutes on High, elegant drums in Nature, human failures and sorrows Within.

"I am but a broken-winged bird, and my flight is very slow."  I repeat these
childhood phrases with warm religious ecstasy, but I mumble the "ohm" that I
learned from my friends, and I curve my hands in a mathematical motion that I
taught myself.  All these things are prayers.  I will say goodbye to nothing
that is warm, but many things that are unkind.  My shameful soul had no way
to love God before.  Perhaps now that I have things to be ashamed of, my love
is deeper.

It may take an acid trip to bring the eye candy into the world, the delicate,
fractal visuals.  But that candy is no longer a thing I fear addiction to,
because I may taste it and I may leave it with little thought.  It may take a
rush of stimulants to remember one's addictions, how easy it is to become
compulsive, bound and broken.  My brain knows cravings.  My body knows waves
of pleasure.  But these pleasures are but a moment in time and I may leave
them.  I know true peace.  I know eternity.  I always have.  And I will never
settle for less than the full relief of my soul's cravings or for less than
being able to give away everything.

Why do I feel like I am just starting to understand things, only now entering
the world?




. . . I'm off to visit the animals of the zoo, and eats lots of fruits and
vegetables in San Diego.  Perhaps I'll do some surfing or get married.  Maybe
I'll write a book.  I'll see there!



Lots of love,

- Justin

Ok, "fascism" maybe an exaggeration, but it has always bothered me to see
pEoplE say things like, "Oh, you're not on E ... I'm so sorry."  Part of it
must be a  new, everything-is-right-with-the-world that people who start
using a drug are supposed to have (the "honeymoon" period), with the wish
that EveryonE ElsE could ExperiencE it too.  This doesn't just happen to
non-E using people who are hugging.

I think that this scene does lead to more affectionate, friendly physical
contact between people, whether altErEd or not.  Americans don't often hug,
let alone kiss, friends when they meet them or say goodbye, but in other
cultures such behavior is commonplace.  But ravers do, and it feels
natural.

This coercive attitude (peer pressure at raves?) obviously grates on the
"sober" people in our midst, and IMHO is why so many straight-edged ravers
feel the need to justify or explain why they refrain from extracurricular
substances, and sometimes why others should refrain as well.

One of the most important aspects of raving for me is freedom -- freedom to
do what you want, and not to do what you don't want, without hurting
others, without fear of judgment.  (The without hurting others part is why
there is no fear of judgment, and could lead to a more complex discussion
of intent, oversensitivity, etc. which I won't start here).  It cuts all
ways, no matter what you do or don't do.

To paraphrase a catch-phrase from the pretty inane movie "Love Story":

Raving means never having to say sorry ...

(unless you bump into people repeatedly ...)

This is _so_important_....  I've heard TOO MANY ravers talk down about
drugs, but I think the worst and probably more common than E-bashing or
sober-bashing (at least in my experience) are the ravers who take E but
talk down about "tweakers" and "speed freaks" that are on speed.

There is an negative attitude that many ravers share that speed has no
place in the rave scene, but E is right at home.  Frankly i think they both
fit equally as well, and can coexist without judgement, but I've seen a lot
of evidence that they don't. 

Basically we don't need straight-edge's bashing drug use, people on E
bashing the sober OR the "tweakers", or anyone saying anything negative
about anyone's drug use (or lack of) in an open, accepting environment that
ravers want the scene to be.

PLURespect

Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend3.1 to
GirlFriendPlus1.0 (marketing name: Fiancee1.0). Recently he
upgraded Fiancee1.0 to Wife1.0 and it's a memory hogger, has
taken all his space; and Wife1.0 must be running before he can
do anything. Although he didn't ask for them, Wife1.0 came
with Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw and BrotherInLaw.

Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend4.0...

 - A "Don't remind me again" button

 - Minimize button

 - Shutdown feature

 - An installshield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be
   completely uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose
   cache and other objects)

I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still
installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted.
Then I tried to uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an
uninstall program.  I tried to uninstall it by hand, but it put
files in my system directory.  Another thing -- in all versions
of Girlfriend that I've used is that it is totally "object
orientated" and only supports hardware with gold plated contacts.

             *****  BUG WARNING  ********

Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress
1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MS Money
files before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will
refuse to install, claiming insufficient resources.

PEOPLE'S LIVES ON A REGULAR BASIS!!!!  I have had many friends go down to their
use of crystal, and they lied -- to their friends and themselves -- about what
was happening the whole time.  Their bodies shriveled away, they were sick,
they became paranoid and delusional, they spun down and down and down.  

The main difference with E or A or "social-use" substances .. is that they
really are occasionally used, and if used properly, they allow you to develop
into a better person.  I know few people who do E straight through the entire
weekend, but lots of people who use crystal that way.

Yes, I've had a couple of friends become hooked on E, and that scenario became
pretty much like what I've seen with speed.  So it CAN happen, but it's not nearly
as likely an outcome.

I know, I know, you say ... but I only use it sometimes, not that much, just for
this occasion, or that occasion.

*Some* people may be able to occasionally indulge in speed, and not abuse
it, and maybe you're one of those.  You're the only judge, you're the only one
to decide.  But remember.... speed will lie to you, too.  

My rule of thumb about drug decisions ... ask yourself, do people ruin their
lives because of, and through the use of, this drug?  If the answer is an easy
yes (heroin, crystal, crack), then stay away from it... is it worth taking the
risk that your life could be ruined by it too?   If it's a "maybe" (like constant
pot smoking interfering with accomplishing much of anything) then you might want
to reconsider that too.

But rational and moderate users of the drug are lumped in with hard-core 
addicts.  If you ever do a line you are considered some sort of mangy 
slimeball by people on 4 hits of acid and e every weekend.  Hypocrisy is 
hypocrisy.  There's nothing wrong with powders, used intelligently.

 Change of venue sought for annual Burning Man event

 GERLACH, Nev. (AP) -- In response to opposition from Pershing
 County, organizers of the annual Burning Man event are seeking
 permission for a change of venue.

 Organizers have applied to the Bureau of Land Management to move
 the Labor Day weekend gathering from the Black Rock Desert to an
 equally remote site just to the west in Hualapai Flat.

 If approved, the bulk of the offbeat recreational and artistic
 festival would be held in Washoe County instead of Pershing County.
 But the new site would involve public and private land in both
 counties.

 The new site is located along Nevada Route 34 about 35 miles north
 of Gerlach.

 Lynn Clemons of the BLM's Winnemucca office said organizer Lee
 Harvey responded to a laundry list of complaints about last year's
 event in his application to the agency.

 Harvey ``addressed all of our concerns,'' Clemons told the Lovelock
 Review-Miner.  ``If he hadn't, he wouldn't have gotten a permit.''

 Pershing County commissioners voted to seek an end to the event
 on the Black Rock Desert after a rash of problems at last year's
 gathering, which drew more than 7,000 people, most from California.

 Three people were injured, one critically, when a drunken driver
 slammed into some tents on the desert. Another man was killed when
 his motorcycle ran head-on into a van.

 But Harvey said he intends to go to great lengths to put a new
 and more respectable face on the event.

 He said he would hire a professional security force as well as
 trained medical personnel for the event. Camping would be restricted
 to private land and vehicles would be prohibited on public land,
 he added.

 Organizers are seeking permission to erect various art figures on
 the Hualapai Flats playa and then burn them down. The event takes
 it name from the ceremonial burning of a 40-foot-high wooden
 sculpture of a man.

 Public comments voiced during a recent hearing in Lovelock will
 be used to develop a preliminary environmental assessment on the
 new site, said BLM recreational specialist Mike Bilbo.

 The assessment should be completed by late April, he said.

Sometimes, life really is stranger than fiction. This is a really weird
story detailing the mass-suicide of the web-site-building computer cult
in San Diego. Sounds like the work of PLUR-addled alien-worshipping
ravers to me... :-( ... How pathetic. How sad. Fin-du-siecle madness?

And people wonder why I feel the urge to pull out a flamethrower every
time new age group spirituality raises it's ugly head.

I believe that that rave doesn't even happen until this Saturday.  I know

The joke may of offended you but does the joke greatly affect your life??
Tollerence of certain things is a personal choice, we all have different
things that offend us and we all probobly think things are funny or
like to read things that offend other people. I ask you (and I'm not being 
patronizing) where do you draw the line, raves greatly offend my
step-parents, they really wish that I not attend them, but they don't say
I cannot go they feel it is my choice, at the same time I feel they have
no right to say raves cannot go on. 

The message was labbeled NRR which
already clues you in to the fact that the message isn't rave related i.e.
the content in the message could be anything. I am not shooting down your
comment or your opinion , all I ask is you concider these points. The
wonderful thing about the internet is it allows the minority to express
their oppinion on much the same level as the majority, I feel that stating
that the message was offending was your right, but do you feel it's your
right to say the message shouldn't have been posted in the first place??

I understand your point, and I apologize for being posting a message that
had a very "check yourself additude". We all must draw the line somewhere
but how the line is drawn is a different story.

Thank you for your time, now go 'way =)

Exactly.... I felt like I was being judged by Leslie when she said:

> *Some* people may be able to occasionally indulge in speed, and not abuse
> it, and maybe you're one of those.  You're the only judge, you're the
only one
> to decide.  But remember.... speed will lie to you, too.  

Leslie didn't really even know my motivations for posting my message.
Whether or not I use crystal, the main reason this topic was so fresh in my
mind is a conversation I had yesterday.  I was talking with a fellow raver
about last Saturday night.... I was talking about a particular DJ's set I
had heard.  I was telling this person how much I liked it, and he looked at
me suprised said, "You like him?  He's just a tweaker...."

You probably get my point.  This person judged the DJ solely on the basis
of the fact (or so he says) that the DJ uses speed.  It totally bummed me
out!!!  I loved the music, it put me in a good place, and I had a great
time.  Why should the fact that the DJ might be strung out on crystal ruin
the experience for me, or anyone else?

Nancy's words "used intelligently" are perfect... any drug can be abused.
Leslie said she knew people who abused E.  The point is just because a
certain drug may be more addictive, it doesn't make it right to judge
someone who uses that drug, especially if the do use it
intelligently/socially.  No better or worse than using E socially.

Please remember, all my thoughts on this matter are IMHO, and  they too
come from love, concern and free choice.

love,

david

I don't think it's rude to not tip anyone. I think Mr. Pink was right when
he said "I don't tip because society tells me I have to".

Yes. It's better to be underpaid then not paid at all. There are a lot of
things in this country that are manufacturered by underpaid people.

> Should one, NOT cut another off in traffic to avoid an accident?

To avoid an accident I would do whatever my instincts told me to do. But I
would be sure not to cause another accident if possible.

> Is it right for a General to send someone to there death, to save hundreds
> of people?

Yes. The soldier makes an oath to give his life for his country if needed.
It's an oath and it's his duty. I think it's a bunch of BS, but it's
better me then someone who's willing to make that oath.

Fucking up the ozone layer is some pretty jacked up shit. (Sounds like
Jules Winfield from Pulp Fiction, eh?). I don't think we should allow
ourselves to create products that are not necessarily necessities that
cause permanent damage to our planet.

	Since I started this maybe I should say a bit about how I feel on
this issue. I posted this to the list because I wanted to share with
everyone something which made me laugh, I laugh for many reasons, but I
try really hard to never laugh AT someone or some group, but with them.
laughter can be one of the easiest ways to deal with a problem...look how
funny it is, were all in the same boat sort of thing. Stereotypes
especially can be the source of this sort of humor, I feel that the
sfraves community is one that is aware enough to know that the joke was
not intended to be hurtful, and that most people on this list will laugh
at this joke in a 'geez society is really stupid' sort a way.
	but then I read the joke again, this time from the perspective of
a woman that hed been the victim of a destructive relationship such as the
joke was describing (and then I started thinking about some of the
women I KNEW that had been in bad relationships) and realized that maybe I
should apologise because it was clear to me that I had in fact hit some
sore spots in some people on the list, and I dont want to do that to
anyone.
	Because this is a public forum, with 400? people on it you can
never be completely comfortable with your words as if you were at home
talking to your close friends...
	issues like this are very important and difficult to deal with,
alot of people give berkeley/bay area a bad rap for being too P.C. "why
dont you lighten up? ...welll, I just have to point out that P.C. is just
one approach to a VERY complex social problem, that of living and dealing
with a extremely diverse world of many differnt cultures and values and if
we are ever going to learn to respect one another it has to start with
trying to understand one another, and underastanding doesnt start with
"why dont you just chill out" phew... I'm getting a little worked up
here... so thats my rant... take it or leave it love tony

ps...would I send the joke to the list again if I could do it over? ...
hmmm hard question, depending on my mood, but if I did i would definetely
preface it with a disclaimer about the content...tr.=)

It just goes to show ya, that there's a Web angle to everything these
days.  So when you're reading or watching news, ask yourself, "but
what does this have to do with the Internet?"  And people thought
Leary was weird for wanting to broadcast his death on the web...

HALE-BOPP SHIP; GROUP PLANNED RENDEZVOUS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR

To investigators, it is becoming clearer by the hour the reasons 39 members
of the Heaven's Gate cult committed mass suicide in Rancho Santa Fe,
California sometime over the past week.  The simultaneous lunar eclipse on
Palm Sunday coupled with the passing of the Hale-Bopp comet were prophetic
signs to the group, authorities believe, signaling the arrival of a "Next
Level spacecraft" flying behind the comet.  The DRUDGE REPORT has learned
that investigators are not only in possession of video tape testimony by
each of the suicide victims but also hundreds of Internet Usenet group
postings by the group's self-confessed "Messiah" -- a chilling outline of
its suicide intentions.

Authorities are also in possession of a detailed manifesto by the group's
leader, believed to be a 25 year-old male.

"I came to Earth some 2000 years ago from another physical, biological
Evolutionary Level as the expected "Messiah," or Jesus, and for this
current mission, RETURNED to this level, this planet and entered into a
human body some 24 years ago, Earth-time," the still unidentified leader
wrote in a July 1996 manifesto.

"For the most part, I have spent these years in seclusion working with my
students/"disciples" - preparing them for membership in the "NEXT WORLD,"
the Evolutionary Level Above Human, the true physical Kingdom of Heaven.

"Now, before departure via a "Next Level" mothership, my students and I
will be assisting my Father and His other Next Level helpers...

"The human kingdom was never meant to be anything but a stepping stone - a
'realized hell' that must be evacuated WITH THE HELP OF A REPRESENTATIVE
FROM THE NEXT EVOLUTIONARY LEVEL - THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN."

"The choices of many will find them in a 'mind set' that would view us as
'cultish,' radical, and doomsdayish, to say the least, while others have
chosen to seek mental nourishment that would have them suspect 'Truth' in
my statements," wrote the apparent leader.

The manifesto is a complicated, confusing mix of science fiction and
neo-Gnostic theory that reads like pure madness.  The DRUDGE REPORT has
also learned that authorities are now working on the theory that the
suicides had been planned for months, if not years.

The apparent leader wrote:  "There is a simple evolutionary procedure which
applies to those who might leave or graduate from the human kingdom and
enter the Evolutionary Kingdom Level Above Human (the Kingdom of Heaven or
Kingdom of God).  Periodically, the Kingdom Level Above Human sends one of
its members "down" into the human kingdom (to incarnate into a human body)
-- one who has previously been taken through that evolutionary transition
-- to offer the knowledge to those who have been 'picked' as possible
recipients of that graduation information.  This Representative of that
Next Kingdom literally takes those candidates through their weaning from
the human world -- assisting them in the actual separation or breaking of
ties to their humanness, and helping them 'graft' to Him as the
Representative of that Next Level.   Their final separation is the willful
separation from their human body, when they have changed enough to identify
as the spirit/mind/soul, ready to put on a biological body belonging to the
Kingdom of Heaven.  This entering into their 'glorified' or heavenly body
takes place aboard a Next Level spacecraft, above the Earth's surface."

Rather sick! And, I just found out the KMG radio dropped Art Bell due to
this story over 30 days ago. Looks like thing are not boding well on
Hale-Bopp.

Just wanted to clarify a couple of things......... 

I am not judging when I said ...........

> *Some* people may be able to occasionally indulge in speed, and not abuse
> it, and maybe you're one of those.  You're the only judge, you're the
only one
> to decide.  But remember.... speed will lie to you, too.  

But I am speaking from a place of experience.  

Then David explained the motivation for his post....

> I was talking about a particular DJ's set I
> had heard.  I was telling this person how much I liked it, and he looked at
> me suprised said, "You like him?  He's just a tweaker...."

I myself would never say anything like that.  Music is like a separate
entity to me, and I have huge respect for anyone who can make us dance, plus I've
long ago learned to separate my personal feelings about a dj from the music
they play -- 

some of my favorite djs are pretty obnoxious people --  (I will
however note that some djs with substance abuse problems are not very reliable
in the consistent quality of their sets.... another topic) ... and I certainly
would never say a person is "just" anything .... 

(yes, some of my favorite djs are WONDERFUL people, too of course!)

I might however shake my head with concern when I learned that someone was
deep into using speed, because I know where it goes when you pass a certain 
point with it....  

> Nancy's words "used intelligently" are perfect... 

Yes, I do know there are people who use speed cautiously (I'm not really
comfortable using the word "intelligent" in this context) ... but in my own
personal experience it's a little hard to separate the ones who really have
control over their use of the drug, and those who don't.  And the biggest thing
that I've learned is that what a person says about their use often has 
absolutely no connection to the reality.  The drug makes them lie, and this
has been freely admitted after they took control of their lives back from
the drug.

I'm talking about people who I love from the deepest depths of my heart
here... this isn't about judgments of behavior, it's about concern. When someone
tells me they use speed, I may shake my head sadly, but that's from worry, not
judgment.

	That's just because drug users always need somebody to feel better
than with respect to their drug use, as in "well sure I spent the rent money
on E but at least I'm not doing crank like so & so, so I'm OK."

	Seriously though, let's say somebody tells you they're a casual
unaddicted heroin user. Do you believe them? Or do you think that maybe 
they just aren't admitting to you & maybe to themselves that they're hooked.

	Some substances definitely cause more problems than others.

I wouldn't buy hot Dj equipment, I must have missed Mr nStuff's earlier
message. I am totally against buying stolen shit, unless it's REAL cheap.

How about this? (2) $795.00 Accoustic Reference speakers for $240! I got
this deal while driving to the oakland airport. That's a fucking deal! You
should hear LTJ on 'em. These speakers bring out the parts of the tracks
that you never knew existed.

I need some turntables... :-(

Thanks but no thanks. I do not read sfraves to learn about ufos.
Oakely dokely?

I think that's why they have a ufo related list. I don't think you see
messages about fmrs in the ufo list do u?

Todd Manley@HDS

I just wanted to throw this out for discussion, and maybe we've hashed this
one to death, but I just wanted to hear others input...


Last night I turned on my radio to Live105 and I really wasn't paying
attention while the ads were playing.  Next thing I know I hear a chord
progression from the song the radio dj is talking over, and my ears start
to perk up.  I know I had heard this song somewhere, but I couldn't place
it.  As I'm trying to think what the song is, the radio dj says "We're the
station for your dance music!"

Then it hits me what song it is, "Insomnia" by Faithless.  I was right
because just after I remembered what song it was, the dj told the listening
public the title and artist.  Now I've had this record for about a year and
a half, picking it up when I was in England in '95.  I really liked the
record when I first heard it, and i still like it when I mix it with some
other specific records.  But here is what I'm really getting at.

I know people who will hear a song at a rave and believe that the song is
great, and then when it hits the radio, the song isn't 'da bomb' (I'm
remembering the Robert Miles song 'Children') it once was.  Now I know a
song can get played out, etc., etc., and that can diminish from the appeal,
but does the fact that a song is played on the radio make it 'mainstream'.

After the song finished last night I had a weird feeling, like a part of me
being taken away.  It was such a shock to hear this song that I felt like
Big Brother was intruding on my cherished ground.

Anyway, I'm a little dazed and confused, and I wanted to know how others
felt.

-Thanks, Todd

Haha...   

I think DJ equipment stores have good coffins that he could use though.

That is, if he buys non-stolen merchandise. ;-)

Someone please explain to me exactly what it means to use E
intelligently. It has been my understanding through reading materials
from ecstacy.org that it takes approx. 6 months for your brain to fully
recover from 1 hit of E (If this simply meant that seritonin came back
or something more complex happened I'm not shure).  And even then you
have the problem of serotonergic neuron terminals potentaly growing
back to the wrong place. So far I've been able to follow this guideline
and have only taken E once in the last 10 months. But from reading this
thread I've gotten the impression that other peoples definition of
intelligent use may be different. This may explain why "casual users"
seem to be lumped in with "hard users". If indeed it is true that it
takes about a six month wait between E hits and many people who concider
themselves "casual users" are doing much more than that (say every 1-2
months) than I too would have to classify them in something other than
the responsible catagory.

Welcome in the real world.

What would you say if your favorite rave event was nation wide on the
radio.
See Holland, Germany, Belgium, etc.
Or even worse MTV broadcasting from it live and in color. And Carmen
Electra interviewing the DJs.

You can have shit like that in Europe any day.

True, E has been proven to cause physical damage, but so has almost any
other drug.  We are talking about the addictive nature, so maybe
intelligent isn't the "perfect" word to use, but in the context that we
were talking about, it works.

If we were talking about detrimental effects a substance has on one's
physical well-being, no use of any substance would be intelligent, then
again neither would eating burnt toast....carcinogens cause cancer you know!!!

Somehow, I don't think she's in it to make her fortune.  I doubt her
"Tit Prints" are going to make millions.  And I will retract every
negative thing I've said about Western Civilization when I see "Post
Porn Modernist" on the New York Times Bestseller list.

Yes, she's proud to be a sexual creature and to share it with other
people and sometimes to sell her sexual talents and knowledge for
money.  What's the difference between selling your sexual talents or
selling, say, your computer programming talents?

This is what shocked me:  when I've been in Europe I'm used to hearing
*alot* more dance music on the radio, but to hear it last night here in the
states just kinda spun me round.

I think this can be put into perspective even more if we remember that
not only can any _drug_ be abused, but any_thing_ can be abused.  There
are many things that have "ruined people's lives":  television, sex,
food, exercise, relationships, etc.  Anything can act as an agent of
growth and enlightenment or of destruction.  Some things seem to have
more "power" -- more potential to be abused as well as to be useful. 
Drugs seem to be one of those things.

Hi,
     This is my first post as this account isn't mine and I only get to
come round here and pick up on a few threads once every couple of weeks.
But I really felt I had to say something about this drug hypocrisy
discussion.
     First of all, I don't think it's anyone's business but their own
what drugs they do/do not do at a party or anywhere else.  Total
acceptance of who I am and what I do was the one of the biggest
attractions of the rave scene when I first got into it, and it's largely
why I'm still in it now.
     Second of all, being concerned that someone is having problems (or
will have problems) just because they use an addictive drug can cause
more harm than good.  When I was seventeen years old, I experimented with
speed and cocaine.  Then I stopped.  Several months later, rumors were
still flying around my high school that I was some kind of addict, and
"well-meaning" "friends" (who obviously believed rumor before they
believed me), went to the school administration in order to get me some
"help."  When I was called to the office to explain myself, I informed
them that I did not have a problem.  Their reaction?  "Denial is the
first sign of addiction."  Anyway, to cut a long story short (I know -
it's too late . . !), the result was that they would not believe me, they
called my parents, and they kicked me out of school until I agreed to get
"help."  And I never did go back.
     The moral of the story is BELIEVE PEOPLE.  If they tell you that
they are using speed because they enjoy it, and they are aware of the
potential downward spiral, then leave them alone.  They probably know
what they are doing.
     I always thought the rave community would be the one place on earth
that wouldn't condemn people for pursuing what they enjoy.
     Thanks for listening.

Love,
Beth

Nothing. Either way, you'll eventually get pimp-slapped by some asshole
driving an expensive car and wearing a flashy suit, and perhaps get a
virus on your floppy if you forget to use protection.

Why do you read SFraves?  To criticize people?  Nearly every post of yours
I've ever read has been NEGATIVE.  Amy's post was clearly labeled NRR, that
means Not Rave Related.  That means if you don't like  non rave related
posts, delete 'em!  Sheesh!  If you don't have anything nice to
say............uh...........

I had the privilege of seeing Annie perform last week, at the absolutely 
fabulous 20th anniversary party for the absolutely fabulous 
sex-positive/woman-positive sex toy store Good Vibrations.

She did a brilliant parody of a strip tease, managing to turn what is 
sometimes degrading to women into a celebration of her body, a hilarious 
send-up of traditional "femininity," a sexy and funny show, and have a 
theatrical orgasm at the same time!  She's tops in my book.  :)

  To all you happy ravers.
   If you're like me, than you're open to all kinds of music.  Well have I
got a treat for you!!  My band, Somethin' Grooves, is playin LIVE this Friday
night at 6:00pm at Mainstreet Music in Tracy.  We'll be done just in time for
you to take off and enjoy the evenings festivities, wherever they may be.
 Directions are as follows:  Take I-580 east to Tracy.  Take the 205 Business
exit.  go straight until you reach a Pizza Hut, then take a right.  Take your
Immediate left and go until you see a music store on the left side of the
street.  
   Call this a Pre-Party gathering or something.  And b-sides, we're a cool
band and we need the exposure.  there will be free stickers to give out
(maybe, if I get around to it) and you can get a chance to meet some of your
e-mail pals face to face.  And have I mantioned it yet, We're a really cool
band.  We've played two gigs before and we've gotten positive responces from
both
  Hope to see you all there!!!   Look for me, I'm the drummer.

        John

It's my understanding that Sunset is to be every other week.

Do you know if it will ever be moved back to the marina?  I like that
location much more than the current one both in terms of travel (I can
ride my bike or bus to the marina) and locale (thicker grass, set into a
cove, etc).

Besides that, the marina is much more conducive to people getting a
positive take on raves as there is a path going right by where people
stroll, ride, etc.  The last marina Sunset I was at, curious passers-by
would stop to look and then start to groove -- even 60-70 year old
couples! :)

I refuse to sit down and take the abuse that has come to be known as NRR. I
will not stop fighting for my people. Long live the cause! Disagreement is
not negative. Criticism is not negative. Clearly labeling messages NRR is not
the point. If you begin to find yourself typing NRR, STOP! And mail it to
the UFO mailing list. They might find bumper sticker sayings interesting too.

Let's say you weren't able to go to the UK in '95 and pick up Faithless.
Let's say you were busy for a long period of time working, etc. and couldn't
attend raves, clubs, what have you.
And the only music that was available was on the radio or tv or internet.
Then it would be a good thing for the radio to play faithless and introduce
you to their music.
Cause if they didn't then you wouldn't know about it.
The more people that know about and appreciate a band the better. No matter
how they were introduced to it.

Groove Radio (103.1fm) in LA has done this quite a bit... in fact, I know 
there are rekkids that are probably pretty good that I just can't stand 
because I've heard them so many times on Groove (Insomnia is one of 
them).  I always find it amusing listening to DJs from non-Groove areas 
because they almost always wind up spinning some rekkid that the 
SoCal-ers have bannished to the back of the crate due to too much airplay.

it's odd, but that station gets you motivated to really dig for the good 
rekkids.  :)

I think of it as remaking faceless, frightening technology into something

tribal, passionate, real.  Redefining inhuman sounds to resonate with the

deepest parts of our human souls.  Mechanistic bleeps are no longer the 
sound of alienation; they bring us to communalism and return us to a 
distant memory - the ecstatic dance to repetitive rhythm that humans have

done since the beginning of time.

feel it coming? The bass is coming... only 4 hours left tonite
the party goes on...

...to your right, a pair of glowsticks chasing each other in the hands
of a ravechild spinning her web of glowstick wizardry and imagination
spinning twirling streaking their tracks of light and your
trance is green motion stops mesmerized at the light show
the crowd surges in energy... a steady thump thump trancelike
voice screams on 1 and 3, its Christopher Lawrence taking over
starting his set of all sets just for you..the wavEs of goosebumps rush
over

to the rhythm thump thump thump the bass still carries you,
it will sustain you, the people will keep you going.. drink more water

dragging
the edge of the Technics 1200 to slow it down every so slightly...
wonder what its going to be?  The red light on the turntable is so
rad...he's bringing it in now ...wow unbelievable!  Dance harder,
dance faster, look deep into the bass focus to see what its all about...
someone
grabs you, points to the sky ..its the comet! Its dancing too, streaking 
speeding across the dark universe spreading its vibe...its tail is
vibrant,
its fire and beauty fired by the energy of the dancers below, motion
stops,
your trance is the comet, its next set isn't going to be until 2450 AD!!
Incomprehensible....a trance song now, hugs everywhere, some 
children handing out candy oh it tastes so sweet, the energy is rising,
the bass is starting again softly, you know whats coming next... the
whump
whump whump builds and it drops in as the crowd surges with screams and
arms waiving in the air you know that you've found where you belong......

See you all at DUNE III..

	Who knew the knowledge of the land
	And spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

Just wondering if anyone saw this on the calendar and who might be the
organizers of this event.  A party at at the waterslides and right by where
I live . . . looks to good to be true!?

March 27, 1997                San Diego, California

*40th Body Found in Southern California Heavens Gate Suicides*

 Local investigators while searching for clues and information about the
Heavens Gate Cult were suprised to find a 40th body on the grounds some
ways away from the other cult members bodies. The body was found dressed
almost exactly like the other 39 members with some notable exceptions.
The individual had a pacifier in their mouth and several long depleted
glowsticks in each pocket. Glitter and some stickers were found
decorating the face as well as a multitude of laminates hanging from the
neck.

The newly discovered body had a neatly packed bag at the foot of the
bed. But instead of items similar to the other members, wich consisted
of clothes, small personal items and such, the bag contained a pair of
Technics 1200 Turntables, some carfuley selected vinyl records, 300
Blowpops, Bottled Waters, and Jonson & Jonson Hand Lotion.

"According to the neibhors reports, " said one investigating officer,
"the individual had a schedule different than the others. They were
reported to have been seen many times comming back home early in the
morning, fatuiged but wearing a big smile.

why are you posting this on SFR? huhhh? you don't see FMR info on the
alt.dead.cult.members.info newsgroup, do ya???  well then, MR. PENGO,
why don't we just keep all the gratuitous non-rave-related stuff off of
this mailing list so that we can get on with the SERIOUS BUSINESS of
raving! I don't have time to read the 2 - 3 (sometimes as many as 5!!!)
"NRR" posts that come across on this list each day. You figure at about
5 seconds per post (to scan and delete), that's up to 25 seconds WASTED
EACH AND EVERY DAY!  (and that's not even counting the time I spend
whining about NRR posts, which can be anywhere from 1-2 HOURS each day) 
I'm a busy guy, and I don't have that kind of time to waste!  I could be
doing better things with all that wasted time, like trying to figure out
what to do with this stick that's up my ass.
So please, no more NRR posts on SF Raves.  thanks big guy.

a little late in the posting...but put briefly:

full moon, brisk sunday night.
foggy, ethereal glow from the moonlight.
panther beach!  bonfires! awesome, thunderous waves
melanie, carlos, garth, tracy, jason. - great music!
clean sound from two Community stacks
mind-warping computer-generated visuals - projected onto a huge cliff!
this one didn't end until well after _10 a.m._ on a most
gorgeous sunny monday morning

need i say more? 

you'd be a fool to miss the next FMR.  remember how insane they were
about 3 years ago? well, they're building up to that again.  this
summer, looks like they're gonna be fully OUT OF CONTROL.

see ya next month, kiddoes!

Hello everyone,

How do you guys feel about getting together sometime to have dinner, go
miniature golfing or maybe have a BBQ?

I think it would be a lot of fun to meet the people behind the e-mails and
get to know one another..... I know a lot of us drive so if you don't we
could pick you up. We can have it in a central location and everyone could
bring something. 

What do you think?? We should do it!

it's the weekend of April 5th, I think, in the desert somewhere near LA.

there was talk of renting a van, but I don't know whether that's still
happening or not. (I think one of the concerns was cost?) personally, I'm
getting worried because all my friends have their plane tickets and I
haven't lined up transportation yet. if anybody knows anything about the
van, or if the idea sounds cool to you, could you e-mail me? It sounds
like it's going to be a *great* party - among other things, they made sure
you'd get a great view of Hale-Bopp when they were choosing the location.

also, while I'm posting, who's into doing some sort of Monday Night Dinner
thing next week? (not neccessarily on Monday.)

sounds good to me. dinner would be cool, and miniature golf would be a
trip. we could go bowling, too. I've got an awesome bright blue and yellow
bowling shirt with "Goat Boy" embroidered on it that I could wear.

they used to have a "disco bowling" night at this one bowling alley where
I used to live, but they would always play seventies lite rock and C+C
Music Factory instead of like. disco. :-\

yeah!  that sounds like a great idea.  of course with our ability to get =
together here so far, i wouldn't want only a couple people to show.  i =
don't know if this would defeat the purpose, but possibly meeting =
further down the road would be more conveinient.  i don't know why =
really, but at least with me school will be dying down and my work =
schedule won't be as hectic.  but really with an effort i can make =
anything....so, short story long, great idea, i'm all for it!

How do you guys feel about getting together sometime to have dinner, go
miniature golfing or maybe have a BBQ?

I think it would be a lot of fun to meet the people behind the e-mails =
and
get to know one another..... I know a lot of us drive so if you don't we
could pick you up. We can have it in a central location and everyone =
could
bring something.=20

What do you think?? We should do it!

Byroni wanted to get together for a bbq or something .... 

for those who don't know, we have a fairly new tradition of SFRaves
barbecues (we've done 3 now I think, all really great), which 
are now called Beats n BBQ .... currently in the plans
are an outside all-night beach party onf Saturday April 19th, 
the a daytime BBQ party on May 24th ....

and not to forget the CAMPOUT the first weekend in June, i.e. Saturday
June 7th...

Make sure to mark your calendars on that one!  

This is of course not to say we shouldn't have LOTS of excursions
into realms that may have nothing to do with dancing ..  I highly encourage
everyone to get together for dinner, hanging in the park, whatever, to get
to know your fellow SFRavers on their "non-rave" habitat!

Leslie, thanks for the plug.....little correction.. BBQ & BEATS...   The
beach party on April 19th will not have the Huge BBQ like normal. This is a
regular beach party put on by the BBQ & BEATS crew. The one on May 24th
might be a small version of the regular free BBQ & BEATS parties or just a
good daytime event without the BBQ, depending on cashflow. This way we can
put money into the Campout, but we'll see.

>and not to forget the CAMPOUT the first weekend in June, i.e. Saturday
>June 7th...

If all goes well, we might even move it to June 6th-8th.


Hey Leslie, did you get info about your email probs!

I'm not sure. The Berkely police started being fairly adamant about their
position that Sunset was far too large a gathering to be held with their
blessing at the Marina frequently.

Actually, a Chem. Bros. interview appears only after following the music
link off the top page.  TV Guide's homepage makes no mention of them,
instead opting for a scintillating discussion on "Who's sexier, Skeet
Ulrich or Johnny Depp".  I'd better head for the newsstands.

Um, please re-read this paragraph and try to prevent yourself from
laughing.  Even if it's true, it sure is funny :)

"Taking care instead of taking E."  Brilliant!

Easter Bunnies Around the World Take Revenge on Procter and Gamble1s
Animal Testing Policy

Please join In Defense of Animals (in partnership with Uncaged of Great
Britain) for a Global Day of Action Against Procter and Gamble, an
international day of protest. On Saturday, March 29, 1997, animal rights
supporters around the globe will demonstrate, march, sit in, and
participate in civil disobedience actions to send a clear message to P and
G that cruelty and torture are bad science and bad business.

In San Francisco, the protest will take place at the Marina Safeway at
15 Marina Boulevard (between Laguna and Buchanan) between 11:00 AM and
2:00 PM.

In addition, you can also call P and G CEO John Pepper at 1-800-543-7270
to protest the use of animals for testing cosmetics and household
products. (Public pressure really works. Gillette recently declared a
moratorium on all animal testing, after 15 years of defending the
practice.)

We need your participation to make this the biggest and loudest public
condemnation of this greedy corporate giant, who needlessly tortures
millions of animals to death each year by force-feeding them toxic
substances such as drain cleaner and laundry detergent, or forcing
shampoos, shaving preparations, and make-up into animals1 eyes and on
shaved skin. Animal testing does not make products safer!

For more information call In Defense of Animals at 415-388-9641.

	I don't know if this is what you're talking about, but my friend said 
that they still have 'disco bowling' every Saturday night from 9-11:30 
at Serra Bowl (Daly City?).

Cool!

We could meet for pizza even. On a Friday night or during the week. I
think we all have busy schedules, but we need to make the time otherwise
it'll never happen.

Maybe I'm being too literal and missing the humor, but "Big Beats Cereal?"
whatever! :)

    once again, all I can say is that when you're like me spend all $$$ on 
raves, rekkids, and computers, turning on live 105 at 1pm when you need a 
house fix and Insomniac happens to be on, it makes your day!  Even if it 
is followed by a live 105 promo...
    Hmm...what's so bad about "our" music becomming "mainstream" anyway?  
It's not like live 105'ers are going to hear _a_ song and decide they want 
to spend $20-$100 a weekend to make this music their lifestyle!  So it's not 
like the few real UG's we have will be suddenly bombarded with scenesters. 
    And just in case it is, they'll probably notice that most of the rave 
"songs" they hear have no words or guitar solo's, and aren't The Prodigy, 
The Chemical Brothers w/ Noel Gallagher or a Smashing Punkins remix.  So 
if they decide they _don't_ like the music and leave, no big deal.  And 
if they decide that they _do_ like the music and stay, then we just scored 
a new member of our bomb-ass community.  

    Just my opinion...I hope I don't offend anyone!!!
   
Peace & Much Love,
christine

supposedly that last time that bagok tribe did a party there was supposed
to be barbara tucker, kot, frankie bones and a whole host of other famous
DJ's and singers. I showed up at the party at around 12:00 am. and
according to there schedule the DJ's that were supposed to be playing at
that time were not. So I wondered who did show and who did not? the reason
being I left to go to a harmony party and returned in the morning to get
some of my friends that stayed at that party. Jimmy and carlos closed but
according to there lineup some "famous" DJ's was supposed to close and not
them. So this leads me to believe that they put names on there flyers of
people that probably did not show.So I wonder who is really "confirmed" on
there lineup and who is not? I know mark B is confirmed cause my friend
talked to him as well as frankie. I will not be there so for those of you
going could you please tell me who shows and who does not. I was a little
disappointed when I did not see KOT or michelle weeks. But I can't complain
cause I did not pay for that party. Sorry to spam the list.

Peace,
Macadio

Just a warning to those of you to whom this might have some relevance.
The last party from Bagok Tribe (sp?), Lucky Charms, got lambasted on
sfraves.  I don't remember a single positive comment.  There was mayhem at
the map point (Your Mama's Cafe), and XLR8R blasted their flyer which
clearly and obviously made reference to drugs. Supposedly some dj's didn't
show, also.

I'm not passing judgment here, just information for you to do with what
you will.  I know little about the party, but more about the reputation.
I know what kind of party I like to go to, and this probably wouldn't be
that one.  To anyone similarly aligned with my tastes, I would not
recommend this party.  However, to those that are going and are excited
about it, I wish you the best.  Tastes differ, and if you are willing to
give this party a shot, go for it.  Hopefully the music will be good.
I'll be interested in the reviews on monday, so do take notes!! :P My
money will be spent elsewhere that evening (even a root canal being
preferable!!! :) hehehe  :)

I've had several experiences with Bagok Tribe, all negative.  'Cause its not
really rave related, I wont go into detail, but I got the impression they
were a bunch of little twerps from Daily City.  Did I spell twerps right? :)
Anyways, I guess they still might throw a good rave...

PS, Sorry for the negativity, Daily City is actually a nice place. :)
Personally, I love it when sfraves warns me that a party could be scary, or
about a  promoters heart being in the wrong place.  Since I started lurking
over a year ago my bad party attended ratio has dropped substantially.  

Work sucks, I'm goin home

It's a drag they are calling it "Cap'n Crunch",  my OLD persona which I killed
a month of so ago.    I just want everyone to know that I have NOTHING to
do with it,   but you all know that anyway.    I WOULD like to get in
touch with the promoter and ask him/her why they used that name for the
rave.....   :-)

Sumpin funny just happened at work.  Bossman, who's a real nice guy, asks,
"so what's up for the weekend?  heavy drugs?"  (he's just kidding - little
does he know, ha ha ha) So I laugh, noncomittal.  He goes, "hmmm!  that
wasn't a denial" (more joking) and I just laugh again (I always have
trouble lying outright).  Then he tells me there used to be an employee
here (a doctoral student in my department here at Cal!) who would
periodically call in sick Monday mornings, explaining he'd been out "at
rave parties" all weekend and just couldn't make it in.  Now there's an
honest employee! 

And I just laughed again, keeping any opinion to myself.

When I call in sick, I pretend I have the flu!

	I'm new to this mailing list and if you've read the header, you are
probably wondering why I have suscribed to SF-Raves. Well, I will be
visiting SanFran in a few months and it looks like I'll be going alone
(Most of my friends don't have jobs or live on their own). So I've set out
to meet people from the area and get to know them over the net... So that
when I arrive to S-F, I'll have people to chill with and party with. 

	At the same time I'm looking for any store/club/rave company info... Such
as where to shop and party and all that... So just reply, and let's talk...

	Hope to hear from you guys soon!

Shortly after I arrived at the DJ convention in Las Vegas, I headed into the
hotel.  After I dropped my records off in the suite, I hung my headphones
around my neck (cause that's what DJ's do), and sluffed my stinkin' butt off
to the hotel lounge.

And hanging out over at the bar, who should it be but Sandra Collins and
Keoki.  Now, I've heard that these kids like to party, but who'da thunk that
Destiny would land me so close to them?

"Boomerang,"  says  I.  "This here is your chance to make it with the big
kids.  Now you get your pink little ass over there and start hob-nobbing."

So, taking my own advice, as I sometimes do, I lit up a Camel and saddled on
up to the bar.  "Hey guys," I say.  "Next round's on me, huh?"

Sandra Collins got a sparkle in her eye, but Keoki, that techno problem
child, he says,  "Hey!  I'm a supastar!  What makes you think you can waltz
your pink little ambient room Enya-playing ass in here and just start buying
me drinks?"

"Well," says I, ever with the quick retort.  "Let's start with 25 greenbacks
that says I can drink your tattooed, nosering-wearing ass under the table."

"Oh yeah?"  says Keoki.

"Yeah!" says I.

Then Sandra Collins says, "Shoot, I'll drink both of you sucka Dj's under
the table."

"Bartender!"  I cried.  "Line 'em up and keep 'em coming."

So after Mr. Keoki realized that I was /the/ boomerang fidget, we became
fast chums.  Kindred spirits were we, sharing a comeraderie like two ships
that pass in the night.

And so the drinks were poured with careless fluidity, and we three
superstars were headed down that one-way boulevard to oblivion.

At 11 o'clock the beerjerk gave us the boot, on account of the embarrassment
we'd caused to the Women's Auxillary Knitting Club a little earlier.

Out on the boulevard, we hired a cab and set off to the closest watering
hole, which turned out to be a dirty old cowboy joint at the end of a dark
alley.  After a few rounds here, Ms. Collins and I agreed that old Keoki was
slowing us down, so for the better good, we ditched him in the can and left
to find a larger bar with stronger drinks, where we could finish the bet.

When I awoke the next morning, I was shocked and horrified to discover
that'd I'd slept in the fountain in front of Caesar's Palace.   My head was
pounding like gabbercore on crack, and the hole in my wallet suggested that
Ms. Collins had won our little wager.  Ms. Collins, however, was nowhere to
be found.   And lo and behold, I was appalled to find that my headphones
were missing!

In a panic, I rushed back to the hotel.  Once I'd changed into dry clothes,
I racked my brain for clues to the case of the missing headphones.  The
night before was a blur of lemon wedges and cocktail swords, but I had a
fleeting memory of the very last bar I'd been in the night before--a bar
that shone as if lit by angels, encased in gold and twinkling with heavenly
brilliance.  It was the most regal of meadhalls, a stately palace designed
for the elite of alcoholics.

Had it been a dream, or...?  There was a chance, a dim hope, that I had left
my precious headphones there, and perhaps they had been found by the barkeep
or the bouncer.

With phonebook between my knees, I dialed the number of every bar in town,
asking each proprietor if his tavern shone a golden glow like the chambers
of God.  For an hour I dialed and queried, with no luck.  As I was just
about to give up on my beloved headphones, there was a trace of hope.

"Sir,"  I asked the bartender.  "Does your establishment glimmer like all
the jewels of Providence?"

"It does, young man."

"Goodness gracious.  Are the stools, and the bar made of gold, and are the
napkins lined with that precious metal?"

"You are right again, young fellow."

"And your toilets, are they gold as well?"

"Ermm, can you hold on for a moment?"  the bartender asked. "Hey, Rufus!"
he shouted.  "I think I found the bastard who took a dump in your saxophone
last night!" 


Later,

b))merang

you have the time and whatnot, read on.. :)

SO there i was, driving home from work yesterday. my mars tape ends and i 
pop it out to throw in a lil flux/rinse dealie i got in the mail. my 
radio happens to be tuned into DJ Fritz's KSJS (90.5 4-5 on thursdaze) 
show. His show, see, features alotta ambient and some jungle and just 
about every type of music in the techno genre and then some. ONCE, i 
remember his show had nuthin but "ooooooo" *change note* "ooooOOOoooo", 
but that's another episode.
SO ANYWAY! I flip on the radio and AAAAHHHH UUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAHHH HOH 
MY FUCKING CHRIST YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!! *eyes rollin in backa my head in the 
middle of nastyass traffic* *hands gripping steeringwheel* *incredible 
urge to get out and stand on top of my car and scream or something*

A trakk that i've heard before and have on a mixtape somewhere (audio 
slopfest succka noel/ufo ??) EXPLODED out of my lil speakers, 
bassbreaksfuckingbombassshit, giving me the rush of a lifetime -- and if 
anyone has heard -- NO, EXPERIENCED this trakk, you know what i mean when 
i say it fucks your brain.. when it's over, you're exhausted, sweaty, 
overly satisfied, weak in the knees and begging for more -- adrenaline 
rush TO THA HEAD! :)
SOOOOOO of course, I WANT IT! 
Hence, my lil favor: if anyone knows where i can find
	* * ALEX EMPIRE - WHEN I REACH MY PEAK * *
please, please OH PLEASE let me know! I am fiending for it, BADLY! been a 
bad week and i'd just die if i find it. i'm off to find it in some stores 
soon but if anyone knows exactly WHERE, i will owe you BIGTIME!
and when i get it (CUZ, ya i WILL) i'll make copies of it for all of you 
curious junglistic drumnbassheads who want a brainfuck :)~
THANX AND HAVE A BEAUTIFUL WEEKEND ALL!!!
love love love!
oh, sidenote: if anyone was offended with my analogy of a brainfuck, 
sorry -- it was the only way i could think to explain it :)
hugs n smooches (to ALLA YA!)
	lara~
		p.s. hey macadio -- ITS ALL ABOUT THE LOVE!!! STRAIGHT UP!

quick question Sharif why did you join SF raves, for the community or for
the information?

I feel that one thing we all have in common is that we all have had some
thing to do with rave at one time or another that is all we definately
have in common, past that we all differ in some way be it in our views,
morality, sexual preference, hair color, political standing, education
level, etc, etc,,, and we all have different things we post on this list
(which for the most part seems to be unmoderated(SP???) ) it is our choice
on if we stay part of this "community" by if we stay subscribed or not;
 
Anyway the point I'm tring to make is that this list is filled with many
differing souls that get different things from the list; if you "fight"
for not posting things like this "ufo related stuff" then you close off
part of our freedom of expression and who we are hence making an effort
towards destroying the community which I feel is the purpose of this list,
there are other ways of getting "pure" rave related info besides reading
SFraves digest/mail

One more question why not have the NRR tag it warn you that there isn't
"pure" rave content contained giving us people who like to post the other
stuff we want to express to our fellow ravers a way to do just that i.e.
letting people know about stuff we learn, hear, and /or experience outside
of raves.

Thanks for listening ( reading[ viewing{ browsing <Scrolling> } ] ) oh you
get the point

Sounds good, I'll try to give it a listen. Does anybody happen to know
the  Schedule of interesting music played on KALX? I just moved to a
different neighborhood in SF (upper noe valley) which caused me to lose
reception of my favorite station -- KFJC 89.7 -- but gain strong
reception of KALX 90.7 and  KPOO 89.5, plus weak reception of KZSU
90.1...

Unfortunately, I find KALX's music coverage and consistency to be 
extremely and annoyingly divergent, one moment they're playing  lame
70's-burnout music (Journey and REO SPeedwagon, bletch), then cutesy
rainbows-and-unicorns forgotten fluff-psychedelia from the 60's, then
gregorian chants, then keltic skin-flute jigs, then, French bistro
music, and then, if you haven't turned off the radio yet, you'll stumble
on an excellent techno/jungle/acid-jazz/reggae/dub/trance/etc.
And you never know if you're going to tune in and hear some lame
talk-show where they drone on for hours on end about issues that are
relevant to (no doubt) very few of their listening audience.

Is there some kind of method to KALX's madness? 

Is there a known schedule of kinds-of-music played? Or a list of DJ's,
kind of music they play, and timeslots?

Is that the shirtless male variety, or the fur-wearing variety?

My Review

I guess it's time for me to either:

1. Grow up and face the facts

2. Bitch about how this was not a Rave, it was a freakin High School, no
make that a Junior high school dance.  What a f((((ckin  embarrasement. 
What was with the monitor Moms at the door?

How did these people ever think this was a Rave?  I don't want to get
down on someone trying to organize a party; but these people are
definately promoting the feeling that the scene is over and dead.  

Sorry but it really sucked.

An embarrassement to anyone and everyone over the age of five.

It was in the commmunity center!!//??  What the ???

Add these wanks to the list of Never Again.

Sorry, but we couldn't keep it in and the group consensus (sp?) was they
wasted our time and our minds.

Oh well, it's an insanely beautiful morning and we're going to Tangerine
Falls (an incredible 200 foot waterfall on the West Fork of Cold Springs
Trail in the Foothills of Montecito - check it out if your in SB!) then
on to the beach!!!

I am in a real bind here..

 It's like.. I have NO clue as to what I am doing tonight..
 Reason being.. I hear rumors that, the Captian Crunch party is going to be
held on a BOAT?.. Man.. I sure could use some facts here. Can anybody
confirm?  Or atleast tell me it's NOT going to be on a boat..?  Bagok is
not giving out location info tell 6:30.. Which means.. 8:30 or 9:00...
 So..  Is it on a boat or what?
 I just listen to the info line though.. And they said limited location..
 Party looks like it's gonna be booty though..  =[

Thanks for the post.  This was a beautiful party.  Myster-E's set was
incredible! Lots of smiles, great vibe, nice  space and information 
exchange, e.g. the lovely flyers, holding prayers, insight, etc. as you 
walked in.. The main room was humid...and at one point it felt as if rain 
were lightly falling...one dancer ironically was wearing a T-shirt whose 
back read, "Dancing in the Rain"...  :)  Drawbacks, cig smoke and lack of 
adequate toilets per crowd size.....
Love the black lights and all the dancers wearing glowing clothing...
My friend and I had to leave early due to prior committments today...we 
danced out asses off for over three hours.  Myster-E spun a mix from my 
favorite SF film of all time... CE3K...Nebula 9:  Contact Me.  I hope 
this is out there on CD!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks and blessings to all who put 
this one on....and toall the dances..


~~peace

freedom or lack of at raves

not for engagement announcements, bumper sticker sayings, ufo mumbojumbo,

my friend, i understand exactly what u are saying and i agree wholeheartedly
but any person with half a brain and an ounce of logic can conclude that ufo
mass suicide k-rap does not belong here ... sense of community is fine ...
but let's be realistic and logical here ... do not mail to sfraves just b/c
it reaches a lot of people ... the only thread that is common to *all*
members of this list is raves/raving ... why one would assume that a majority
of subscribers would appreciate a ufo post is beyond me ... let's stick to
raving community not ufo community

how about a separate mailing list called community@hyperreal.com ... that's
how sfraves was created ... we didn't all start sending posts posts to the ufo
list ...

> Thanks for listening ( reading[ viewing{ browsing <Scrolling> } ] ) oh you

I appreciate your constructive response ... hopefully mine will be too

PS. I really would like to have a vote somehow of who agrees with me ... i
don't know an easy way to do that but it would be interesting

Hi everyone,

I ended up at Organic last nite at Caesar's Palace for some strange reason.
:o)
compared the last time I was there (Evolution) it was much better. It was
less
crowdy and the vibe didn't seem to be as 'negative'. The music was ok, some
stuff was really really cool, some stuff kinda suxed. It was more like a
Club rather than a 'rave'.

Anyhow, just a short review
Pab

The UFO thing is a big part of rave culture, so a posting discussing
the untimely demise of people following this kind of social idea (or
mneme) is somewhat relevant. And then there's the cult tie-in -- many
feel the rave scene is somewhat cult like; and then there's the 
web/internet tie-in, many ravers are wired in to this scene as well.

I think the UFO thing in the rave scene started as a joke, or perhaps
out of the consensual hallucinations of people mind-expanding together.
This whole metaphor for a "beyond" of this-mortal-coil (no not the one
you left steaming in the toilet) seems to be a human need that can be
fulfilled by a wide range of bullshit-beliefs. Pick your poison. Seems
that when some have had enough of the inexplicables of traditional
judeo/christianity (like a god that could give a flying fuck about the
actions of any single ant-like human) you can go on to think that
there's aliens out there that give a fuck about you too. 

I personally think the whole alien thing is a joke, and I appreciate it
when people go into alien-babble the same way I appreciate it when
people go into church of the subgenius babble -- as pure
cynesacreligion and "mockery science." It's sometimes good to look
under your bed and realize that the only monsters hiding there is
humanity/belief/faith itself.

Unfortunately, some people feel the implicit need to replace the
outmoded bullshit that their parents  believed in (i.e. literalist
(mis)interpretations of the literature of Judaism, Christianity, 
Islam, Hinduism, etc) with new bullshit that is more relevant to our
time and our space/technology-aware culture and art (e.g. Sci-Fi
movies). So instead of book-of-revelations crap about transcending
one's physical body and rising into heaven, we can now assume that
aliens trailing a passing commet will do the job for ya... Whatever.

It's such a waste when methaphors are given literal beliefs. Next thing
you know people are killing each other over misinterpreations of
metaphors in their religious literature. And some take it so seriously
that if they beome enthralled with a charismatic leader, and kill
themselves because they're following the warped and sexually repressed
mind of said leader.

I think it's important to bring this stuff up (and discuss) because
this scene seems like a good place to cull easily-suggestible cult
members. To some extent, the rave scene  is already somewhat like a
cult, and appears this way to many outsiders.

Perhaps religion/faith/belief is the ultimate form of human population
control.

>People of this wonderful HOUSE NATION, What's Goin' On?!!?

same as it ever was... same as it ever was....

it goes like this: people discover something beautiful that isn't in line
with mainstream (wealth/power/dominance paradigm) values... a
counterculture/underground develops... the mainstream (thru the media,
their most poweful tool/weapon) simultaneously demonize and co-opt the
counterculture... the counterculture evolves, taking with it those who are
true to it, and leaving everyone else behind to become part of the
mainstream once again.

10 or 20 years from now the rave scene may not exist in any recognizable
form, or it may... it depends partly on us and partly on how intent the
powers-that-be are on curtailing us... but it will all evolve, and the
values that underlie raving will always be there for us to choose to live
by, with or without any specific incarnation thereof.

love,

brian

 Both of you have good points. I feel that there are several subjects
that are
not directly about raves but interesting to a lot of people here...like
ufo's.
If you notice at raves there are alien stickers,pictures etc all over.
Personally
i enjoy seeing things besides pure info. These other subjects give the
list
life and gives us a chance to see what others are like and what is on
their mind.
This helps build a sense of community and the NRR tag should protect
those that just want pure info. Plus there are several good web sites
like brians where one can get "just info" if that is all you want.

when something major happens in the world like "heavens gate"  or
an earthquake or something then some people like to talk about it
and a healthy community provides a place for that. Personally i 
would prefer to hear what other ravers and people that have similar
beliefs and interest to mine have to say about these things than
the mainstream news and CNN. Ted Turnner, president of CNN
said he was happy about the mass suicide..."great way to get rid
of a few nuts" was his response. I dont know about other ppl 
but i enjoyed the posts here more than stuff like that from CNN

So my vote is to keep the aliens...even if they dont have a green card.

[ to SFRaves ]

 Every once and awhile, someone includes some anti-club comment in
an SFRaves post ( I probably have too ). 

 However - doesn't the San Francisco rave scene have its roots in
"after parties" ? A crowd at a dance club would be experiencing 
and sharing such a good time ( vibe !?! ) that when the legally
mandated closing time came around, some of the clubbers and DJs 
cooperated to continue the "vibe" with someone's sound system at
some other location ( a warehouse, outdoors, someone's garage ).

 Please, old school ravers, clue me in !

in the mid-80's I used to go out clubbing in SF and lots of the clubs,
especially the underground or "invite only" ones, though clubby,
weren't all that different from the raves of today. and in a lot of
ways they were more interesting because it was a little more wild with
a better representation from the gay/transgender/dragqueen crowd than
you get in today's scene, and a lot more african americans too. i'm
thinking of places like the DV8 opening party, GLASHaus, Trocadero
Transfer, and a slew of undergrounds whose names i can't remember. I
also vaguely recall some outdoor soundsystem-parties at china cove in
88? These were ravey in the sense that it was ok to just dance -- as
opposed to dance-with-someone. And they were ravey in that people got
dressed up pretty weird too. They were clubby in that the vibe wasn't
that friendly or open.

I also went to some "clubs" in NYC in the early/mid 80's that were
pretty rave-like as well -- e.g. the Palladium back in the early 80's,
Save the Robots,  etc. Ravey in that it brought out all the freaky NY
club kids. Unravey (in theory) because it seemed very cliquish. Very
unravey if you considered you had to stand outside in some stupid
line-up and they'd only allow in the photogenically inclined and/or
club-kid-dressed. Above I said "in theory" because although people talk
about the rave scene like it isn't at all cliquish, I find it to be
more and more cliquish all the time, and then there's the fashion
police too.

Ok, i'm going to quit posting and get back to work now. I'm leaving for
a work-trip to India soon and I'm nowhere close to being done!

Dear All;

	I was at Lightseed lastnight, and unfortuately in a miserable
mood. I only felt like communicating with a few people last night, and the
and few people I did communicate with didn't really seem to be interested
in me, only if I was doing speed; what has happened to our scene? I also
became more aware of some awful and untrue roomers going around about
myself. 

	So I would like to take a moment to talk about OUR scene, set the
record straight about myself, and ask for help for myself from people who
say they are responsible, accountable & care. In return for your help, we
would be helping others by reducing the availability of a chemical that is
destorying the lives of so many of us, and until recently myself included.

	So first let me set the record straight about myself; I have
never, ever participated in the manufacture, and or distrubution of speed; 
however that is not to say that I don't have knowledge of such
people(other than myself), places & things.

	I'm currently recovering from P.T.S.D ( Post Traumtic Stress
Disorder ), which stems from extreme sexual & physical trauma from the
first 20 years of my life. Which means when my parents use to
say we love you, that meant violence, pain, humiliation, embrassement,
fear, inappropreiate behaviour & conduct directed at me, disrespect,
neglect, ..etc on a DAILY level for 20 years.

	Anything else you have heard about me, from persons other than
myself is just simply untrue, and is hurting me. If you don't communicate
with myself and the topic is about me, than you are living in your
imagenation. This also applies to anyone else in your life; for if your
talking about another human being, and you are drawing conclusions about
that person without getting input directly from them, then your
conclusion is unfounded.

	I don't want your pity, I however desperately need and want your
support, for what I'm asking for I can't do by myself, get in a job, or a
therapy office/hospital, I can't educate myself with books or classes, it
doesn't come from a pill or a drug, reiligion doesn't offer it, and you
won't get it in a self help 12 step program. I assure you I have tried all
of the above to varing degrees and I'm still alone and in pain. 

	What I'm asking for comes from human beings, preferablly healthly
ones that have their lives invested in the self(people who make healthy
descions about themselves), karma, and community; however it still feels
good even if your sick. Most of the time I'm terrified to ask someone for
affection. Affection being complicated like sex, or something as simply
as putting your arms around me and spending a little time. I often feel
like one of Harlow's moneys, the one who got the wire & steel effigy of a
parent. I don't feel I have the right to ask another human being to help
me with something that is clearly not their problem or responisibility.

	I feel a lot of you want to help, I feel more of you want to help
but don't know want to do. So if you see me try putting your arms around
me, I don't care what you look like, I don't care if you don't know what
to say, I don't care if you need to state your boundries and put limits on
the affection, I don't care just please do it because I don't want to be
alone anymore.

	So what do you get out of it, my promise to continue working on
all of things I mentioned above so that I continue having a healthly life
and not relapse. My promise to put the people I know who make and
distrubute speed on notice that their product is not welcome in humanity
anymore, and if they don't listen; than TOGETHER WE will put them on
notice, and continue to increase the pressure until this war machince drug
is no more. However, I will not partciapte in or condone the TORTURE of
addicted HUMAN BEINGS that I've been subjected to over the past year by
unmentioned persons. You might even be able to talk me into returning you
affection with a really nice massage, considering I am a licensed massage
therapist, go figure. But most of all you will see an immediate and
positive change in myself. For out of the 34 years I've been on this
planet the only time I can truely say I was happy was when my one and only
girlfriend was in my life for 6 months, and the 6 months I was in massage
school. I was on the right track, just not long enough 1 outta 34 is
pretty bad. 

	Sorry if this clutters your mailbox, I'm miserable, and in
terrible pain and I just don't know what else to do to help myself.

Sincerely
Brian

You just described it.  When I was there it was required that you play at
least three different genres of music in a single show, and a certain
large percentage of your songs had to be pulled from a bin of "current"
music which was all over the place as well.  Since I was only let near the
control boards between 3 and 6 in the morning I used to satisfy that
requirement by playing three genres simultaneously (say, the Orb +
Lawrence Welk + the Breeders).

Do I have to do your search engine queries for you now?  :)

No way, not on my bandwidth!  

There is the "abducted" mailing list @ hyperreal...

  http://hyperreal.com/abducted/

for all you ufo freaks.

I feel that *sometimes* the NRR traffic gets so high that even people
who'd like to enjoy some off-beat-but-still-countercultural-related
discussions are prevented from doing that simply because of the volume.
Mostly these folks are not sophisticated enough to know how to use filters
either, and just throw their hands up and leave.  This list has very high
turnover.  

So, I don't have a problem with NRR posts being on the list, but anyone
who thinks they can post anything and everything so long as they label it
"NRR" is doing the community a disservice.  Just be considerate.

By the way, a digest version is now set up (as many of you probably know),
and a "best-of-sfraves" list is being considered....

Another great party at Cyberorganic... I get a warm feeling whenever I go 
there, just 'cause I know the Cyber folks are cool and, being a small 
community space fitting 400, it's always a UG!

Beautiful decorations and I especially appreciated the many flyers 
holding inspirational sayings and reminders... reminders of what we're 
creating here and what we should be mindful of as we enter a sacred 
space.  The promoters taking responsibility for guiding us in this way is 
crucial, I think.  It is easy to think of it as "just a party," and if 
that's our mindset, that's what it is.  Just taking a moment to reflect 
on the phenomenon of community and freedom and the positive energy 
fomented with the input of 400 people is enough to start a beautiful ball 
of light growing.  A "lightseed," if you will.

I just wonder if the majority of people approach it that way.  I was 
dismayed to realize I didn't know 95% of the people there, and they were 
all so young.  I probably don't know them because they're all newbies 
(and I don't go to high school with them :P!)  I have tried to put 
"ageism" behind me, but I do have trouble with partying with people 10 
years younger than me.  I rave because I love the music and the 
environment, and I have to wonder why more people my own age aren't 
there.  I've hung out in the bars and clubs of the 20-something scene, 
and a lot of it sucks!  Where are my peers - more importantly, how come 
they don't have any taste?!  I worry that the youth aspect of raving will 
eventually drive me out... I look around and see some faces that are so 
babyish still and I'm finding it harder to surrender myself to the scene 
and the vibe when I'm disturbed by 14 year olds on acid...

Maybe that's why I'm not a chill room person.  But last night, the
dancefloor was the place to be!  14 or 80, I don't care when we're getting
down on the dancefloor (e-piles of children with vacant eyes are what's
most distressing to me, I suppose!).  The dancefloor went off, incredible
energy.  Whistles and yells and glowsticks and smiling dancers - but part
of me knows that the greatest enthusiasm comes from the younger,
"candyravers," and I love them for that.  Last night, though, I discovered
gold, and her name is Anna.  Can this woman rock a dance floor! 
Thickest trance and everyone was jumping, despite the heat and 
condensation.  Fantasies of cool comfortable roomy clean places to 
dance... will the underground never have a perfect location??

Thanks to the crew and dj's for all the work put into the party, it showed.
And goddamn, when is Anna spinning again?!

til next time!  :)

Well, I must commend Bagok Tribe on trying a new space, but the fact that
it was broken up at midnight really pissed me off...
Thanks a lot, OPD...
Can I get a refund, pleeeeze?  ( I am asking nicely here....)

Oh well, too bad I didn't have my SFRaves calendar handy to see what else

Yes! Exactly how I was turned on to "raving" in Chicago.  The true
clubbers would bail around 2 and hit some warehouse - and it would go
off!!!  Leaving the clubs also had to do with overcrowding by the
suburbanites who would be there to stand and stare (never could figure
out how they kept their bodies from grooving at least a little).

The Gay/Lesbian thing - it was the Berlin crew (full-on gay dance bar in
Chicago before it got over hyped in Playboy) that turned me on to the
afterhours UGs - and I am not gay - it's just that in Chi-town it is the
Gay/Les crowd that know how to dance and party to extremes.

Dood...

 What are you trying to say man.. Peace in your zipper..  Are you talking
trash about my hood nStuff?  =]:..
 New space?  When I listened to the location information, it sounded like
the party was at that little indoor / outdoor space behind the ice skating
rink.. Is this not where it was?  Well, if it was a new location, I am glad
now that the info line detoured me from this party.
 I am beginning to not trust Bagok parties..
 I mean.. Why did the cops bust it?  Was there to many people out side in
line agian? Lucky Charms was behind the ice skating rink..
 The last four weeks in a row. I have made plans with my friends to go
somewhere... And they allways get indesisive at the last minutes.. Or they
lag..  This is getting really old.. Anybody have some new friends I could
borrow?  I mean.. Loan?  Wow..  I think I forgot how to spell another word
agian..

thank you to the lightseed family for a great party in comet. the space 
was wonderful i had never been there before, although it could have used 
maybe more running water and bathrooms, but everyone was kind and 
accomidating. the banners were beautiful, the live performances were 
great, dj's went off.

this was my only party of spring break and so now i'm back in boston... 
but i'll see you all this summer. hopefully i'll have some pictures on 
the web sonn. hey to everyone there, friends new and old and as yet unknown.

   CAN techno SAVE ROCK & ROLL? 
   
   The synthesized beats and soundscapes have transfixed
   Europeans, major rock artists and a sales-hungry music industry. But
   will America catch dance fever?
   
   By ROBERT HILBURN, STEVE HOCHMAN
   
   'No, no, no," the president of one of the biggest record labels
   in the world shouts in mock horror. "Don't say that word. All this
   talk about techno being the next big thing in pop is starting to drive
   me crazy.
    "I just had a call from one of the most respected artists in the
   world. . . . Someone who has been around for years and who has nothing
   to do with this music. But he's nervous about it and wants to know
   whether he should hire remixers to do techno versions of his new
   songs. He hasn't even written the songs yet and he's asking about
   remixes."
    The harried executive isn't alone in his frustration.
   Shaken by flat album sales over the last three years, the
   $12-billion-a-year record industry is searching desperately for
   something--anything--to help reignite consumer interest in shiny
   compact discs.
   In the four months since MTV shook up the industry by announcing
   that it was adding a techno program to its lineup, techno has emerged
   in the eyes of trend-watchers as the next big thing.
   "Trent Reznor said something smart: Music needs to be dangerous,
   needs an edge to it," says Steven Baker, president of Warner Bros.
   Records. "Techno has an element of that. The beats are kind of
   frightening. It gives its audience an identity, almost as if you are
   in a special fraternity."
   There is a revolutionary, rebellious feel to techno--and its
   accompanying all-night, drug-charged club and rave scenes--that could
   appeal to young record buyers looking for a way to separate themselves
   from the music and styles of past generations.
   Rather than traditional pop-rock elements, the emphasis in
   techno--or dance music, as supporters of the genre prefer to call
   it--is on frantic or calming soundscapes, mostly created by
   synthesizers and sampling.
   The British-led movement has been hot in Europe for years, and
   has already generated enough excitement among rock musicians for many
   of them, including U2 and David Bowie, to employ dance textures in
   their new albums. Recording under the pseudonym x-sample, guitar
   legend Eric Clapton has made a techno-influenced album as part of a
   duo billed as T.D.F.
   Not wanting to be left behind if there is a cultural and
   commercial shift to techno, many executives, artists and managers are
   trying quickly to figure out their place in this new, mysterious
   world--with its strange-sounding subgenres such as trip-hop and
   jungle--and a new collection of stars, from the Prodigy to the
   Chemical Brothers.
   The race is on to sign techno artists--just in case something
   explodes. Radio is experimenting with dance formats--notably "Groove
   Radio" (103.1 FM) in L.A.--and the music will be showcased in a
   high-profile tour this summer.
   "It's like a fever," says one label president.
   But is all this activity genuine heat that will warm up the sales
   of records, or just "Saturday Night Fever" redux, a replay of the '70s
   disco era that produced hit records but not career artists?
   "[So far] there's not only no smoke, but there's no fire," says
   Mike Shalett, chief operating officer of SoundScan, which monitors
   U.S. record sales. Together, the 10 most high-profile dance-related
   albums of the '90s have sold only 1.1 million copies here. That's less
   than half the sales of the second Hootie & the Blowfish album, which
   has been widely perceived in the industry as a disappointment, after
   the group's previous album sold 9 million copies.
   In a survey of more than a dozen U.S. record executives by
   Calendar, only one thought there was even remotely enough evidence to
   justify calling techno "the next big thing."
   "All this talk about the end of alternative rock and the birth of
   techno is just distracting," says Don Ienner, president of Columbia
   Records, summarizing the majority view. "As an industry, we tend to
   have a lemmings quality and go chasing after things. But we need to
   keep focused and search for great stars and great songs.
   "Techno is only sonically enhancing or dressing up what you have.
   You can put whatever dress or suit you want on any person. It's the
   artist and the song, not what suit you're wearing."
   Roy Lott, executive vice president and general manager of Arista
   Records, agrees: "Grunge didn't happen because record companies said
   it was the next big thing. It happened because Kurt Cobain and Eddie
   Vedder came along and wrote songs that millions of people identify
   with. You always make a mistake by signing genres rather than
   artists."
   * * * So, what's the case for techno?
   Mainstream pop-rock certainly needs help. The traditional
   textures were wearing thin by the early '80s, prompting such respected
   artists as Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, David Byrne and Sting to look to
   world music, among other movements, for inspiration. Others, including
   Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, later began focusing on techno.
   Not to be confused with mostly witless elements of disco, the
   best of techno music has substance and sophistication. These records
   are built around imaginative rhythm patterns that express all the
   emotional colors, from exhilaration to despair, that we are used to in
   pop.
   Just as with its musical cousin hip-hop, there'll continue to be
   a hard-core factor in techno that will probably appeal only to a cult.
   But some techno artists may mix and match with pop and rock the same
   way some best-selling hip-hop artists have done. Indeed, the influence
   of techno and hip-hop has already been felt in the works of such
   pop-rock bestsellers as Reznor and Beck.
   "As far as major labels investing a lot of money in this, the
   commercial potential is enormous and these investments are positive,"
   says Jason Bentley, the respected deejay who appears on both public
   station KCRW-FM (89.9) and commercial powerhouse KROQ-FM (106.7) and
   is co-head of Quango Records, a techno and dance-oriented label
   distributed by Island.
   "In a way, this is the first international pop phenomenon--this
   club culture, this techno culture, this use of technology," he says.
   "So when it's grounded in that success, there's certainly commercial
   potential here."
   And some retailers do sense some commercial smoke, even if it is
   just a wisp at this point.
   "There's really been a lack of anything new for people to get
   excited about and this really does seem to be having an effect," says
   Bob Bell, new music buyer for the Wherehouse retail chain.
   "These bands all have alternative credibility, and in terms of
   radio airplay they're doing the most important thing--making a really
   strong single that radio can support.
   "Sometimes you have these bands with great buzz and people
   talking about the album, but if you don't have one hit song, it
   doesn't happen. But when you get the combination of street-level buzz
   and a song radio can get behind, that makes hit records."
   But will radio get behind the genre as a whole, beyond just
   specific acts and songs?
   That's unlikely, says Jeff Pollack, a Los Angeles-based radio
   programming consultant with more than 100 client stations in the U.S.
   and Europe.
   "The passion level is very high for this music, and that's
   great," he says. "The problem is, how many people will be able to
   really get into it and want to be a part of it with that full
   commitment? A lot of people would find that just too fatiguing. So it
   might make sense for a radio station to be built entirely on that [to
   serve the serious fans]. But most people need something a little more
   multidimensional."
   The techno wildfire in pop began when MTV President Judy McGrath
   spoke at the Billboard Conference in November and mentioned the launch
   of the techno-ambient video showcase "Amp" and the programming of such
   techno acts as Prodigy and the Chemical Brothers as a central part of
   the channel's new agenda.
   The key was the timing.
   If the announcement had come two years earlier, when Hootie & the
   Blowfish were on a roll and Pearl Jam was selling almost a million
   copies in a week, no one would have probably paid attention. Techno
   was being dismissed at the time by much of the industry as simply
   dance music that couldn't break out of its cult audience.
   By last fall, however, record execs had been shocked to see one
   after another of their bestsellers--from Pearl Jam and Green Day to
   Hootie and R.E.M.--nose-dive commercially. Against that backdrop, the
   MTV pronouncement hit the industry hard.
   "It makes me sick to think that MTV caused all this fuss in the
   industry, but I'm sure it did," says Howie Klein, president of Reprise
   Records. "I'm not trying to dis MTV, but we should be taking our cues
   from the artist and the kid in the street, not each other."
   Even MTV, one senses, is a touch embarrassed by the commotion
   over its November announcement.
   Within the channel itself, McGrath's speech was not viewed as a
   declaration of a new direction, but merely a roundup of some new
   elements being incorporated into the programming.
   "We're not zeroing in on [techno] and we don't think it's the
   next big thing," says Andy Schuon, MTV executive vice president.
   "We're not running conventional singer-songwriters out of town on a
   rail, by any means.
   "It's just another interesting style as we're trying to widen our
   net and explore things. We're playing just as much Spice Girls and pop
   acts and singer-songwriters. There's a revolution--the Wallflowers and
   Jewel and people like that. Maybe that's the next big thing. Funny
   that people picked up on electronica, not that."
   Schuon even believes it would be a mistake to place "Amp"
   alongside such past programs as "Yo! MTV Raps," "Headbangers Ball" and
   "120 Minutes," which served in the past as launching pads for dominant
   roles on MTV--and then in pop culture--of hip-hop, heavy metal and
   alternative rock, respectively.
   In fact, Schuon says, "Amp" is designed to maintain a pure
   feeling of the style, true to the club culture from which it comes.
   And that may be hard to translate into mainstream programming.
   "Amp" producer Todd Mueller explains, "One of our prime concerns
   is to retain the deejay ethic and think about the music as beats and
   rhythms and show how they work together--approach the show as a solid
   block of entertainment as opposed to individual clips.
   "It was a conscious decision for us not to deal with this music
   in terms of personalities. We've even removed the talking head
   veejays, and we frame it by saying these beats and rhythms are the
   stars."
   And that is most definitely not the future of MTV as a whole.
   "Will we have big mainframe computers as guests on [dance music
   program] 'The Grind'?" asks Schuon facetiously. "Not while I'm captain
   of the ship."
   Until the MTV announcement, techno was looked upon by the
   recording industry as simply one of several areas of potential growth.
   There was also talk that sales could be boosted by a new wave of
   lightweight pop (the Spice Girls), sunny teen rock (No Doubt),
   traditional pop (Celine Dion) or a soul revival (Tony Rich, D'Angelo).
   
   But the MTV statement started a buzz in the record company
   corridors and in the media about techno--probably because it is the
   most cutting-edge of the alternatives--that quickly escalated it to
   the forefront of the discussion. The news that U2 and other hit rock
   acts, including Oasis and the Smashing Pumpkins, were working with
   dance textures or artists heightened the interest.
   Nothing underscores the record industry's sudden obsession with
   techno better than the turnabout in interest by major U.S. record
   labels in the Prodigy, the high-profile British dance-related band
   that was dropped three years ago by Elektra Records.
   Labels started rethinking Prodigy's commercial potential in this
   country last summer after the single "Firestarter" and its video
   caused a buzz on both sides of the Atlantic. It intensified in
   November after MTV mentioned Prodigy in its decision to put more
   emphasis on techno acts.
   Another reason so many companies--including Interscope, Columbia
   and Warner Bros.--were eager for the Prodigy is that the group looks
   like a rock band. On the whole, techno acts have tended to be a rather
   faceless bunch that places more emphasis on their sounds than on their
   public identities.
   The Prodigy fit that pattern in its Elektra days. But the band
   went through a dramatic visual transformation that made it look on
   casual glance like the Sex Pistols--complete with a spike-haired lead
   singer, Keith Flint. Even the music has something of the unruly,
   liberating energy of the Pistols.
   Maverick Records, home of Alanis Morissette, eventually won the
   multimillion-dollar competition for the Prodigy, whose new album is
   expected early this summer. The "Firestarter" single has sold an
   estimated 225,000 copies in the U.S. The band's May 28 date at the
   Mayan Theatre is sold out.
   The performance of that album--and a collection due April 8 from
   the Chemical Brothers--is likely to be widely viewed as a test of the
   commercial strength of techno music itself.
   Al Cafaro, chairman and CEO at A&M, warns against expecting
   immediate results.
   "If the Prodigy album is a bomb, you may have a lot of people who
   are saying techno is the next big thing suddenly declare techno dead
   and move on to something else," he says. "I think a purposeful
   exploration of techno music is the right thing to do, but you've got
   to look at it long term. If you think you are going to sign a techno
   band and see it blow up in two months, I think you are asking for
   trouble. . . ."
   Ironically, the dance music community is as anxious over all this
   "next big thing" talk as the record industry.
   Techno supporters are fearful that the millions being thrown at
   techno will lead to a watering down of the music and the culture.
   They say there are fundamental differences between techno and
   pop-rock that are not understood by executives, most of whom were
   raised on pop-rock. They see their music as more in the elite company
   of jazz and classical rather than something to be mass-marketed.
   In fact, many of the artists are reluctant to participate in the
   current media exposure of the scene and the big-label bidding wars.
   A prime example is Rabbit in the Moon, a Florida-based production
   combine that is among the most prized by dance music fans and
   consequently among the most coveted by the major labels.
   Rabbit member DJ Monk was reluctant to comment when contacted by
   The Times, explaining that he and his partners have strenuously
   avoided the press, especially after the spotlight was turned on techno
   in recent months.
   "We didn't get started in this for any rewards other than doing
   what we love," he says, noting that the combine has been a profitable
   enterprise via its own label, Hallucination, and by taking commissions
   to remix tracks by other artists, including one last year for Garbage.
   "We'll hear people out, but it's not really on our agenda."
   Musically, too, techno stands apart from mainstream pop. Its
   antecedents run from 20th century classical experimenters (Edgar
   Varese, Karlheinz Stockhausen) through such '70s progressive rock
   figures as Can and Faust and seminal electronic band Kraftwerk.
   The music found a home in the late '80s in England's dance clubs
   and in all-night raves that were held underground-fashion in abandoned
   warehouses. In the U.S., the rave scene caught on in such cities as
   Los Angeles and New York. More recently, that scene came aboveground,
   with promoters holding events at regular pop venues.
   "The nature of this music is it survives," says Tom Rowland, one
   half of the Chemical Brothers along with partner Ed Simons. "I'd been
   in regular bands with singers and stuff, and what I liked about
   [electronic music] is I could make it in my bedroom and Ed and I could
   press up [records and CDs] ourselves without having to deal with a
   record company and you can go to a club and see a couple of thousand
   people dancing to your record.
   "If someone in a big company office says, 'This is good this
   year,' and it's big for a while and then shifts back to not being that
   big, it doesn't matter. I can still make the music."
   Record execs aren't the only ones puzzled by techno. Mainstream
   fans are asking whether this new style, with all its synthesizers and
   intriguing soundscapes, will mean the end of rock 'n' roll and pop
   music as we know it.
   The execs see techno as being one of several styles influencing
   mainstream pop rock--as it is already felt in the work of such artists
   as Nine Inch Nails' Reznor, whose music combines marvelously
   traditional rock with techno-industrial fibers.
   Don't expect everyone to be sitting around in their rooms a year
   from now listening to 125-beat-per-minute records--the image that many
   pop fans have of techno--as their sole pop diet.
   The key, stressed again and again in interviews with executives,
   is signing great artists, whether they are in techno or alternative
   rock or soul or punk folk.
   "The same criteria always hold true: Find the great artist,
   someone who can touch you emotionally," says Gary Gersh, president and
   CEO of Capitol Records and the man who helped nurture Nirvana at
   Geffen Records.
   Like others questioned, A&M's Cafaro thinks techno will produce
   its share of exciting artists. "There is a lot of equipment being sold
   out there," he says. "Lots of gear, lots of keyboards, lots of
   computers. People are going to grow up with this technology and I do
   believe you are going to see artists coming down this pike."
   Jimmy Iovine, whose hugely profitable Interscope Records has been
   at the cutting edge of '90s music, feels the problem facing the
   industry is more than simply finding the next hot style. He thinks
   that all the corporate mergers in the '90s have put such pressure on
   executives to come up with immediate profits that the industry has
   lost its daring.
   "If kids aren't buying as many records, it's because we as an
   industry aren't inspiring them," he says. "Rather than be in bands,
   kids want to be computer whizzes or buy video games.
   "That's because Bill Gates is better than we are. I see my
   competition as Bill Gates. I have to do stuff that is more exciting
   than the video game he's creating. The issue is bigger than techno and
   alternative rock. It's all about inspiration."

Lets do a sf rave...we will turn the entire city into one big rave for a
week.

instead of different rooms for different types of music we will have
entire neighborhoods...i.e  the chill neighborhood or the goa trance
neighborhood, jungle neighborhood etc.

we can even use that emergency siren that goes of every tues at noon
as a main speaker to play techno.

we can sync up all the street light to flash with the music...

we can paint the pyramid and bridges dayglow...

we can get the military to fly over head skypainting peace symbols...

we will have millions coming from all over the world to dance in the
streets.

what do you think?

 I think it sounds like a good idea.. just one thing though... we should do something with 
the bay, I say put some of that glo-stik juice in there and let it shine... should look cool, 
what do you think a huge glowing neon green body of water.
 admission would be what? $400 if you live out of town, and the party should last for 2 
weeks.

		jus another thought.

true, cept when that "yet another article" is in the LA Times Calendar
section, written by the main rock-n-roll reviewer dude in LA (Robt
Hilburn), it might get a little more notice than a similar article in a
minor-league rag like URB or XLR8R...

	If you actually read the whole article, you might have noticed a
key point: so far the top ten techno artist put together have sold less
than the 2d Hootie & the Blowfish record, which was considered a flop.
I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for techno to go mainstream here.

Good Evening All.  Hope you all had a pleasant weekend and ate lots of
vegetarian ham at Grandma's house.

Although I didn't stay at Symbiosis the whole time...I kept coming back and
forth...I wanted to post a little props to Dave and Sam and Hope and some
of the other crew for their dedication to putting on a wonderful event.  I
didn't catch too much of the music...but it seemed like everyone enjoyed
themselves pretty well.  What I think I was most impressed about was the
amount of canned food they were able to collect!  That is truly wonderful.
Also whoever thought of bringing that big plastic drum with a spigot so we
could dispense filtered water...that was brilliant as well.  The
decorations I really liked.  They had a video projector set up
downstairs...but it turned off sometime in the middle of the night.  Too
bad.  I was gonna loan them my copy of "Star Trek :  Generations"  where
the Enterprise-D's saucer section crash-lands on a planet.  Next time.

Anyway.  I had a good time nstuff (hi jeff!)

Talk soon...Deep

Hi all!  ]=)

 Well, after a 30 hour nap I can give some of my impressions of this party.

 First off while I think the Cyborganic space is a fine place (although 
more bathrooms and more fresh air are in order) it is annoying that the 
Dance floor is downstairs and the "Ambient" room is upstairs.

 We had Lorin open up up stairs with some incredible 604! After Lorin was 
Centipede who played a more Trip Hop set. While Trip Hop is not my thang, 
Centipede was very good! He laid done some tasteful scratching and the 
music was unique and interesting (for me anyway).

 So if we have two DJ's upstairs, why not the whole main Dance floor? I 
felt sorry for the Lighting folks and the Video artist as they deserved a 
better space for their artistry.

 At this point I should say that Robin at Cyborganic was wonderful and 
very helpful throughout the entire experience!! (hugz!) Also the 
LightSeed Family were equally wonderful and supportive. This is a good 
group of people. Expect big things from them!!

 The first live group (Gamma Quadrant) was OK but I have heard the 
Psychedelic Rock Band sound so many times that it is hard to impress me 
there. Their drummer (who drove from LA for this party) WAS incredible!

 Next up was Rob Rayle who played some amazing techno! Then he had a 
bunch of dige' players jam with him. Very divine!

 I got my chance next (after being awake some 20 hours) after setting up 
decorations for eight hours and 6 hours of (sober) partying. I enjoyed 
what I was doing but was too tired to be very inspired. Especially nice 
was a surprise visit by Galena (of Galactic Dreamspell) who did some 
improv singing for us (Thank You!).

 I missed Myster-E's and Anon's sets (argh!!), but what I did hear in the 
dance floor was fine! Too bad it was too hot and wet down there.

 A very fine group of people was in attendance. Didn't see any signs of 
folks overindulging which was nice.

 Hello to Libby, Rebecca, Patrick (BA), Leslie, Jonathen (leftjab), 
Aaron, Ben, Christine, all the folks at LightSeed, Julia, Rob (of 
course), Robin, Anarch, Galena, Graham, and the many others I can't recall 
right now.

 Extra big hugz and thanks to; Rob Rayle, Martin Randall, Brendon and 
Dagny!! I couldn't have done it without you all.

much Love,

A big thank you goes out to the crew at Karam Loca for an excellent rave.
Granted, I had my doubts when the dance floor was empty at 12. By one, people
were dancing and we meet some of the nicest people ever found at a rave. It
wasn't too crowded so we actually had room to dance. The vibe was incredible.
The music was good and a huge hug to he DJ who spun for most of the evening.
This was PLUR in its finest form. A rave that was refreshing for the soul,
the body, and the spirit. Thank you again to the crew!

peace and joy,
Carl

I don't think that techno in its form as we know it now will hit
mainstream, it's just too out there, I think, for the general public.  But
"electronica", or electronically influenced music, is definitely starting
to creep into the mainstream.  I would not classify U2, David Bowie, or
even Prodigy or some of those other more techno-y groups as really being
techno in its pure form, as we know & love it.  I consider much of this to
be regular music, just as before, but with hints of electronica winding
through it.  Not true techno at all.  The general public, I think, would
not be ready for real techno, it would not appeal to them, and the
mainstream music producers know this.  Therefore, they will
alter/bastardize it to suit their needs, & to suit the appeal of the
general public.  So while yes, techno appears to be "the next big thing"
(Entertainment Magazine? C'mon on!), I agree with Rob that techno, in the
form we know of now, that which we hear at our parties, will not go
mainstream.

This was a nice party. Decorations were wonderful, and the music in the
upstairs room was a bit different than what I am used to hearing which is
a good thing. Don't seem to remember hearing the Beastie Boys at any other
party I have been to... The smoking "bubble" was really an interesting
idea, but it blocked any kind of relief from the intense heat. Going
downstairs to hear Myster-E for any length of time was out of the question
because it was sooo toasty... But when I did peek in it was indeed going
off. 

It was kinda funny, because I was sitting talking to Leslie(hi
Leslie!) saying "Geez, I don't know anyone here...." and now thinking back
on it, I did see quite a few people... Hello to Robin ;-), April(great
meeting you), Leftjab(sorry about the name thing!!!), Rob Rayle, Randy,
Amy, Wayne, Marcie and anyone else I may have forgotten in my forgetful
state....

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DATE: March 27, 1997
CONTACT: Richard M. Davis
TEL:  (310) 442-9073

ALASKA SUPREME COURT DECISION ON CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY MAY ALLOW
ALL U.S. CITIZENS TO SMOKE AND GROW MARIJUANA.

The Cannabis Freedom Fund (CFF), a new California political action
committee, plans a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the
nation's cannabis (marijuana) prohibition laws. The suit will be based on
the Alaska Supreme Court decision in Ravin vs State of Alaska, 537 P2d 494,
1975. The Alaska decision gave all adults in Alaska over the age of 19 the
right to both grow and smoke marijuana in the privacy of the home, based on
each citizen's fundamental right to privacy in the home.  This means that
the United States Government has known since 1975 that the prohibition of
cannabis in the other 49 states of the nation is unconstitutional.

The CFF points out that Section 2, Article 4 of the U.S. Constitution
reads: The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and
immunities of citizens in the several states.

As the government must be held to obey the law and adhere to the
Constitution, what is not clear is whether or not all Americans already
possess the fundamental right to smoke and grow marijuana in the privacy of
their homes, without further court action. The CFF is encouraging the
public to follow this case on the World Wide Web at:
http://www.cannabisfund.org .

Alaska has also rescheduled cannabis to Schedule IVA, which allows licensed
physicians to recommend its use without interference from the federal
government.  In light of the controversy over Proposition 215 in California
and Proposition 200 in Arizona, the Alaskan Supreme Court decision takes on
new importance.

The CFF mission is to end Cannabis Prohibition and insure a speedy return
to personal freedom in all uses of Cannabis. The group was formed by
California cannabis activists who recognize the tremendous potential
benefit to the American economy and environment represented by the
industrial use of cannabis hemp for paper, fiber, fuel, plastics, food,
medicine, and building materials. These uses are presently prohibited to
farmers in the U.S., while Canadian farmers are free to grow hemp in 1997.
Non- deductible donations to the CFF will help to speed the process of
bringing this vital issue to court.

maybe techo will dissolve the "mainstream" so that there will no longer

Um, NO, NO, NO.  Quick legal lesson:  each state's constitution is
different than the U.S. constitution, and some states, such as California
and I believe Alaska as well, have a more explicit right to privacy than is
implicitly granted by the U.S. Constitution.  More to the point, no state
court (the case cited is a state court cite from the P.2d designation) has
any binding authority to interpret the U.S. Constitution -- a state court
only has the jurisdiction to interpret its own state laws in light of the
U.S. Constitution and its own state's constitution.  Any Alaska Supreme
Court decision about the U.S. Constitution (if indeed that is what the
decision did) is not binding on any other state court, any Federal Court,
or the U.S. Supreme Court.  If I had the money to do personal legal
research at home, I'd read the case now and see what the U.S. Supreme Court
had to say about this case (they probably declined the appeal and let it
stand without comment, for the usual and unstated reason that it agreed
with the Alaska court's interpretation of the Alaska constitution).  But in
any event, no state court can determine Constitutional law as it applies to
either Federal laws or the laws of other states.  The case could be
referred to, but it has no binding effect on a Federal court.

Finally, I also believe in the last few years -- perhaps the early 90's --
the people of Alaska voted to disallow people to grow at home.   Thus that
legal decision isn't even in effect now in Alaska, even if physicians can
recommend marijuana there.

This isn't a defense of Federal policy toward marijuana, or an argument
that there is no way to challenge it.  But in no way is it true that the
"U.S. Government has known since 1975 that the prohibition of cannabis in
the other 49 states of the nation is unconstitutional" due to the case
cited -- and I can say that just by knowing that case was a state case.

>The CFF points out that Section 2, Article 4 of the U.S. Constitution
>reads: The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and
>immunities of citizens in the several states.

I didn't think this could be applied to medical marijuana, which isn't a
constitutional right (sorry), but perhaps it could be ... but even then the
California and Arizona state statutes wouldn't let everyone grow in their
homes ...

In general, of course, you cannot trust legal opinions over the net, which
includes my own as well.  I'll check out the website to see if the gist of
the case is different than described, and I'll try to read the case soon
too.

>Alaska has also rescheduled cannabis to Schedule IVA, which allows licensed
>physicians to recommend its use without interference from the federal

It can be seen as ahead of its time, but it has no additional legal
importance due to the passage in other states of medical marijuana laws
twenty years later.

>The CFF mission is to end Cannabis Prohibition and insure a speedy return

Best of luck, of course.  Perhaps the pot leaf should replace the maple
leaf on the Canadian flag!  But remember -- industrial hemp use could be
legalized without legalizing personal use, as industrial hemp doesn't get
you high, so it doesn't necessarily follow that pointing out the manifest
benefits of legalizing industrial hemp will lead to legalized personal
usage.

>Non- deductible donations to the CFF will help to speed the process of
>bringing this vital issue to court.

Not unless the legal arguments are different than represented here (or is
that the reason you need more money) ...

Hello all
   We just wanted to thank everyone here who made it to the 1st Sunset party
of the year on the 23rd of March.  We couldn't have asked for a more perfect
day between the weather, the sunset, the music, the comet, the lunar eclipse,
and all the smiling faces.  It was fantastic!!
   But there is an issue we want address, because I think people should know
how fragile of a space Pt. Molate NOW is!!   Previously in the year a group
went out to Pt. Molate with a sound system thinking it was just ok to have a
party there and no one would mind.  When they got there the fence was still
locked so they took upon themselves to cut a hole in the fence.  The police
pointed it out to us and remember the group that was there.  They didn't do
anything about it at the time but are now VERY PISSED OFF by the disrespect.
 The fence is military property and they don't like there belongings messed
with.  We were able to calm them thank them for being so tolerating but now
we have to go through an even more extensive permit process involving 2
police departments with the threat it could be taken away forever.  They are
no longer going to be as nice as in the past and will not deal with
soundsystems in the same manner.
      PLEASE  PLEASE  be careful!!!   This is one of the few places left
where the permit fees are not outragously out of reach.
     You know who you are if you did this.  Please, lets not make another
example of how a few people take away something that brings so many
happiness!!

                                       Thanks Again,

It's with a heavy heart that we here @ RAS are unable to facilitate 
adequate means to transport to all that were interested in a trip to 
DUNE III.   We tried to earnestly get a decent sized vehicle and cut 
cost down as far as possible, however.  Despite several attempts to 
get a van or other large vehicle, all our plans fell through.
Coupled with the fact that a large amount of money I was planning to 
set this trip off, went to major work on my car this weekend...
We are sorry.

Once finances are back in order, and after another outdoors party or 
two, will we then again try for a RAS trip to LA.

Again, our apologies.

However, we do have names of companies that rent Vans.  (Lowest is 
 11passenger @ 100$/day)
If someone else would like to complete what we started, drop me an 
Email and I'll forward you the #...

Thanks to all that supported us on a nice Saturday @ SPUN.

The day was nice the beats were funky...
Special thanks to the DJ for the tunes and those for the sound.
Also thank you for those that helped us with the information needed to 
manage this party w/o incident.
And a VERY SPECIAL thank you to the ones that came to support in the 
lovely sunny Saturday that we had.

****A NOTE TO DJ's:  There is a lil lost 12" that has found her way in 
my record bag...  If one of you DJ's out there has notice that 
'special jam' is missing from his collection, Please contact me. I 
have an Idea of whose it is but contact me to make sure...

[ to SFRaves and Pacific Sound System ]

 Dear Pacific Sound System -

 Pt. Molate has been such a special and loved spot for so many of us, it 
would be tragic if it was turned off-limits to all the sound systems!

 Which offical agencies did you have to go to , to get permits for
Pt. Molate? Richmond PD is one obvious one - who are the others ?

up the "sun blockers"
but that is ok I have a new one on order already =) I would like to thank
the RAS crew especially Adam for having me come out and spin. Sorry I did
not say buy before I left my friend had to get home. For those of you who
did not make well there is always next time and I look forward to the next
one. I love Pt. Molatte that is a kick ass park!! the beats were good all

Hi. Monty here. Um, I forget to mention that that post I sent last week was
actually fake. Someone sent it to me and I thought it was so hilarious(after
I found out it was false) that I had to post it here. Sorry for any confusion
it may have caused. You have Kamahele,  the Justice League's Minister of
Information to thank for that.

Not exactly a rave, but anyone interested in combining technology with
music might be interested - David Cope uses computers to generate music
"in the style of" Mozart, etc, which is then played by a real orchestra.
Sometimes it's quite convincing!

For what it's worth....

You know you are from the Bay Area when... 
 
You make $100,000 a year, yet still can't find a place to live. 
 
Your commute time is 45 minutes and you live 8 miles away from work. 
 
Stop asking how much things cost but, ask "How long will it take?" 
 
Two-Thirds of the people you know are from Boston or New York, but you 
are living in PST. 
 
Know vast differences difference between Thai, Vietnemese, Chinese, 
Japanese, Cantonese, and Korean food. 
 
Your home computer contains mostly hardware/software that is not on the 
consumer market yet. 
 
Go to "The City" on weekends but don't live there because you like your car. 
 
Think that "I'm going to Fry's." is an acceptable excuse to leave the 
office for a while, and your boss does too. 
 
Lost your alarm clock. You'll get to work when you get there. 
 
Go to an industrial-heavy-metal bar and see two guys get into a fightover what 
flavor of Unix is better. 
 
Own more than 10 articles of cloathing that have hardware/software 
companies printed on them. Bonus for embroidered stuff. 
 
"Your best buys..." you know the rest. 
 
You know where Woz Way, Resistor Ave, and Floppy Dr are located. 
 
You know who Woz is. 
 
You know 280 North runs west, and 680 N runs East. 
 
Even though Microsoft employs quite a few programmers in the Bay Area, 
they only work on Powerpoint, and the company is still the embodiment 
of Satan. 
 
Even if their stock IS worth more than yours. 
 
You see a billboard that says "FPGA2ASIC" and aren't phased 
 
When you need the updated Diamond Monster 3D drivers, you just walk 
across the street. 
 
You have more bandwidth in your apartment or condo than most major 
universities. 
 
You have to hire security to keep the panhandlers off your terrace 
(Oakland/Berkeley). 
 
None of the people you work with are bible thumpers. 
 
You scan yardsales for back issues of "Dr. Dobbs." 
 
Your favorite computer reseller speaks only Cantonese. 
 
Your workplace vending machines dispense "100% natural twig-bars" right 
next to Jolt cola and Instant Espresso mix. 
 
No one brings radio's into work - they just use RealAudio and listen to 
thedj.com, rebelradio.com, or other out of state stations.

So, since I still dont trust myself in judging the events in this time
zone, perhaps I could trouble you Busy-Bodies with another request for
recommends?  Ie : whatchu up to this weekend (and, if you already know,
Next weekend)?  Im generally more concerned with a comfortable vibe than
great DJs (I dont think Im alone here... am I?)

Fuck you,  (sorry... I just read Annie Sprinkles books and am feeling very
'sex positive' :-)

Hi everyone, how are we all?

I had a lot of fun at Symbiosis, I must thank everyone who helped  throw
this party.
I had a great time :o).

I got there around 10:00pm, they were still setting up. There was a
disturbing
smell of PaintThiner or something like that going on, but it went away
after
a while. I spend most of the night in the 'bubble'. which was basically the

smoking room. It was soo nice in there.  It was weird that everywhere I
looked,
people had mirrors...hummm..I think people must like looking at themselves.

The vibe was..different... I noticed that the E-ers, were not very
comfortable 
and some of them left early. I dunno. I had so much fun, I got so many
gifts from
so many beautiful people...

The music was cool, It was way fast.. ;O)

Oh well..I'll say more when my mind come back :o)
Pab

so I was desperate and Mission rock, which  is my favorite legal 
local...I have soo many memories of that place..goin way back! So we 
went to the daft punk thing ftt did I had my doubts when the vm said 
virgin helped sponser it..oh well coulndt find anything else. So 1st 
thing I notice is that the entire upstairs bar is closed off with a sign 
on every door "VIP ONLY"??!!.. hey what a nice vibe that created! so 
basically it sucked, to top it off as my friend and I were leaving a car 
load of drunken scum that left at the same time as we did, pulled up along 
side our car and kept yelling "faggot, hey fuckin fags!!!" Well this is, I 
guess 
simply whats gonna happen- the mainstream effect. The crowd there 
was basically a bunch of drunken fools and cliquish posers.  I found this 
so fucking sick and we arent gay..dont know how pissed I would have been 
if I was!!! I hate homophobic fuckers. What the fuck are they afraid of!?

THIS IS SO TRUE! There are a couple of songs I've really loved that -went to
the radio and I felt like I could never play that song again(sweet
dreams..Bombscare) Because of the "cheese factor". I don't what's happened to
the radio...People like Richard Humpty Vission/Jazzy Jim, etc... turn out the
geniric 303 high energy-planetrock bullshit....I have tapes from the days of
old--(Anyone remember The OG Mars Fm? or I remember when I first moved here
(Fall of 92) and there were decent shows on the radio-(The
Aftershock,etc.....) Thease days it seems like top 40 is just polluted with
suckas!The solution take it back ! I'm down for a top 40 radio show to play
the music we all love and embrace; Only,let's do it properly-Have House(or
whatever you want to call it)Dj's play only that not mix one of ours with
Biggie Smalls and cut in some tupac then throw in jazzy jim's newest Copy of
some old techno song he thinks everybody forgot...Let's have guest Djs from
our clubs(Not SOUND FACTORY!!!) and play some good stuff(not all mixes @ all
stations are subject to Rotation schedules). This is all IMO.....
What's do you all think?

I told you it was NRR.

I'll make it short and sweet.
I work in a medium sized, Menlo Park based company full of computer 
geeks.   My company is looking for new people (System and Network 
Engineers, Project Managers and Account Executives) with experience. 
The pay is OK (actually it's very, VERY OK).
The benefits are cool too.
Soo if you're looking to do that job change thang, or have a friend 
that is, or your job is on the shaky ground side, drop me a line...

If I remember the explanation by people who knew what happened, there is
one person who opens the gate to the fence, who basically can forget to
open it on a weekend even if people have gone through the correct process
to use the park.  Either they tried to get him to open it, or waited for a
while, before taking matters into their own hands.  Not that this
explanation justifies this action -- if you mess up property, you have to
deal with the consequences.

We'll see soon if we are improving at all ...

Apparently they did a case study some time ago.  They took gay men,
straight men, and homophobic men and subjected them all to homoerotic
material.  The gay men and the homophobic men both got aroused, while the
straight men got no reaction.

So in this society where it's really not OK for men to show each other
physical affection (I might add that this is apparently only true in
America...in like the Middle East men are friggin all over each other from
what I hear, gay or straight)...this is what can happen.

As someone who is totally ok with flirting with, and/or having
relationships with men or women (I do swing a little further one way...but
hey => )  I must say I think this study is true, because I have caught many
a guy who doesn't at least look gay (to today's standards) checkin me out,
of all people.

And I thought I was doomed because I have hair on the back of my neck!
Eww!  Well I guess I'll never qualify for MTV's Real World.  Bummer.

Any guys out there ever had this happen to you?  It happens to me all the
time...though I admit sometimes I'm doing the same thing.  eep.

Well...if this turns into another week-lomg thread...I just want you all to
know...filters rock!  =]

That's true....
After parties were the Norm way back when...FLammable Liquid,More,And whole
lot more renegades...(@ least in LA this was the case...)Flammable was back
up and running( I do not know if it still is...going on to this day) More
came back as well...Remember the first parties were made up of all kinds of
people.Scenesters included. Some of my best "RAVER"friends were scenesters
first and later "converted". In fact I'm in the process right now of
"converting" My brother's mod ex-girlfriend to our wonderful scene..She used
to wonder why I why I am "still" going to "raves"-until I took her to
one...and since then she's "Just can't get Enough" Whatever happened to
after-parties anyways? Anyone down for starting 0ne?

hello adam

thats too bad it didnt work...there must be a cheaper way for ppl to 
get a caravan together. Perhaps there are ppl on the list that own a van
or would be willing to carpool. Maybe a data base can be set up for that.
Even for short trips like sunset and full moon parties.

thanks for your effort though.
we will find a way eventually.

I hate to add to threads but, I did not see to many reviews on cap N crunch
and I was wondering how many people on the list went? and I think jimmy
mentioned something on his VM that said "bust free event" or something to
that effect. I don't recall the exact words but it was something like that.
Promoters should watch what they say about bust free events, because bottom
line is that there are no "bust free" partys unless you use home base wich
has some type of permits and some other events obtain special permits. I
think promoters have a responsibilty to make this clear to there patrions
especially when you are shelling out $20 I don't think it is so bad if you
only spend like $5 or $10 that is somewhat bearable, and a event gets
busted. I know that jimmy and his crew tried there best and did what they
could. But you should not brag about being bust free or new spaces that are
bust free and they really are not, that is deceiving to your patrons and I
feel sorry for the kids that spent there hard earned money and did not get
to enjoy a party that was supposed to be bust free. Sorry for spaming the
list, I just think promoters and people need to be a little more reponsible
in what they promise.

I want to extend my thanks to the Lightseed crew for throwing such a great
party. A friend of mine was visiting from out of town and I don't think she
could have had a better introduction to the scene, unless of course, if
there  had been jungle :).

All the blacklight decoration was phenomenal, and the music upstairs was
great. I would have liked to spend more time downstairs, but it was just
too greenhousey for me.

I enjoyed meeting everyone that I did, including a few SFRavers, I believe.
Franchesca & Brett, I look forward to seeing you sometime this summer.
Tony, just drop me a line to pick up your Mr. Potato Head.

 Well, ever scence about the time of "Warmth", Organic has just been
*the* spot. And it's interesting to watch how the different promoters
have learned from one another and sort of "evolved" around the site. A
good example is the smoking situation.

First at Warmth, they had the far back room the Smoking Area. Which
worked, but I still saw plenty of people smoking around the place. Then
at 3000, only the top level was Non-Smoking. Cool as well, except that
the main dance floor was exposed and all that second hand smoke made it
hard to dance long, smoker or not.

Then, well actually I took a break and missed a weekend (or two?). Don't
know but I'm shure there were parties there.

Then at Comet there was the bubble. Much better, it was easier to access
and was well ventilated by the many windows. It was pretty crowed most
of the night, though. So Symbiosis simply made it a little bigger!

I love it: The underground adapting to it's environment. :)

     Lightseed was the best party I've been to in a looooong time.  Actually,
that whole night was wonderful!  I almost didn't make it due to a fight with my
parents, but I lied and they let me out for a while =)   I got pulled over on
the bridge going about 80, but I cried and the cop was nice and I get away!!!  
     I was all alone =(, but I met lots of new people (hi Feross, Jeremy,
Sophie, and all the pacifier babies!) and ran into lots of old people from my
brother's parties (hi Cy and Buck!) + the EBF crew (Hi Fernando!) .  Oh yeah,
and the SFraves people! (hi April, Laura, & Randy)  I only had $12 and a can of
food with me, and my new & old friends helped me panhandle so I caould gEt somE
yummEE stuff.  Thank you Mike for hooking me up for 10 bucks! 
     It was my first time at the 654 Mission Space, AND my first time hearing
Mystr-E spin even though I have 4 mixtapes.  HE WAS PHATTT!!!  So anyway, I had
to be home by 4am so I could go to work Saturday morning.  Bummer.  But it was
lots o' fun and lots o' LOVE & dancing while it lasted!
     Thank you and much love to:
             everyone who gave me money!!!
             everyone who helped me down the stairs
             everyone who helped me when I got sick =(

Clarification:  it's the Cyborganic space, not the Organic space.
Easy to get 'em confused though.

I think it's really fuqed for them to not get permits when they are
charging people $25 a head. I say we boycott the promoter. Fuck that shit.
I talked to one of the cops and they explained how easy it is to get a
permit.

I'm going to stick to the true party throwers:

Space Children & FeelGood Entertainment!

And I do love you guys... even though I was divergent when I wrote my last
post, I meant it.

their car i could sit in? that sure would be nice. please call if you can
help 510 558 1953

now, not such rave related things, but raver related:

california is still here!!! gosh, well, see i went to the east coast for a
few days to visit and such and tonight when i got back, well it was super
good!! as soon as the plane flew over california my little heart went "whup
weeeeee@@@" and was very happy :-) and then when the plane landed, soooo
pretty to fly over the green oakland hills and see "the city" where ohh so
many fun fun parties have happened, and then i was looking around for a place
to claim my baggage and the nifty shuttle to the bart and bumped into two
happy jolly very friendly RAVERS. so they helped me find my way to the bart
and were such smiling people i got even more happy:-) yeshhhhh, ravers are
nicer :-) it is amazing, just out of the blue they were nice, not even at a
party where everyone is (usually) kind and such.

well, i guess i just wanted to say, even in the big world with  mean monsters
we do a pretty good job of looking out for eachother. thank you all for being
sooooo slamm bammm grand!!

two things:

1 - if people want to get together and have dinner this week, Wednesday
    would probably be a good day.

2 - everyone I know is *flying* to Dune3 and I was hoping to go the van
    route. apparently that's fallen through, tho, and I am *bummed*. this
    party sounds like it would be so awesome. I don't want to miss it.

    so, if you're interested in driving down to Dune, e-mail me. I'm going
    to see if I can get the van thing going myself. we need roughly 10-15
    people, and we need to be pretty quick. also, I'm a 23-yr-old male. we
    might be able to get better prices with a female or a slightly older
    guy doing the actual renting, so if you're one of those, mention it
    in your e-mail. price will probably be around $30 per person, not
    including ticket.

    reply to me personally, since I get the digest version of the list
    and there's a little bit of a time lag, or call me at 415-474-4426.
    thnx.

Could you make sure it's not in HTML next time?  At least text/enriched
can be marginally read by those without Netscape 4, while this was a bit
more difficult... thanks.

BTW, this wouldn't be the first documentary - see "Generation of Sound",
or something like that...

I just got tickets on United for SFO->Burbank saturday and
back sunday for $192 for two people, i.e. $98 each.  You can rent a decent
car for $30/day, and a nice one I'd trust taking to the desert for $50,
unlimited miles.  It's about a 3 hour drive from Burbank to Palm Springs,
maybe a little bit more.  I tried finding flights direct to PS but
couldn't find any available this weekend for less than $330 per person.

Ah well, i might as well get this off my chest.


First, let me say that Lightseed's Comet party was awesome.  Anon and
Myster-E totally went off (y'all blew Daft Punk outta the water, imo); the
vibe was great, it was for a good cause, etc.  Easily the best party I
went to this weekend. 

BUT.

If you are going to use the Cyborganic space, YOU MUST PROVIDE ADEQUATE
VENTILATION AND WATER.   Combine these things:
  
  * The hard 'n fast shit that folks on the dance floor are going to go
    off on;
  * A complete lack of any natural ventilation in the basement area;
  * Some fraction of the dancefloor population under the influence of
    whatever drugs they happen to be on (and who may or may not be in tune
    with what their bodies are needing, ie, get me some fucking water and
    take a break, dude) 
   

and you are just begging for trouble.  To wit:  on friday, i basically had
to carry this one poor fellow off the floor; he was suffering from
heatstroke symptoms (dizziness, hot flashes), was on E, and hadn't been
drinking water.   He was fine after i hooked him up with his friends, but
it could have been worse.  

I don't feel that the Lightseed party was properly ventilated, nor do i
feel that there were enough waterstations.  At parties I've been to there
before, there were at least 3 large, industrial fans on tall stands places
strategically about the downstairs space.  And while hot, I remember
parties such as Cloud Factory's as being (just) bearable.  At lightseed, I
counted one, maybe two fans.  I'd estimate that it was probably 90-100
degrees down there, and a good 90% humidity (all surface areas were
covered with so much condensation that, as one person has already
observed, it was literally raining indoors).  Most of the other parties
have also had a water table downstairs.

If you're throwing a party here, take some basic precautions in the
downstairs area:

  * FANS!!
  * WATER!!

I would like to see parties continue at this space; it's intimate, it's
private, and it doesn't get busted.  But, if you, as the promoter, don't
make contingencies for the natural limitations of the space, you are
increasing the probability that Bad Shit Will Happen, and the liable
person in that case isn't you, it's the cool guy who's letting us party in
his space (if you're a promoter and using that space, you should know who
he is: I do.). 


I'm sorry to come down so hard, but where people's health is concerned I'm
going to be an asshole.  

And hey, party people in da house:  in the end, your health is *your*
responsibility.  Listen to your body; if you're dizzy, get off the floor
and hydrate yourself and take a break.  That's what the chill area is for,
right? 



chillin' like bob dylan,

	As a note to people using this space, it would be good to either
push or pull air through the ventilation holes in the sidewalk through the
doors to the sink. If you can remove the dust pan it will provide more air
flow (and would be possible then to mount one of those little high powered
fans in the opening). That's if anyone can figure out how to do it wiout
breaking it.
	Then, there is the other option of removing the shitty vents in
the door that leads to the sink and put one of the much larger industrial
fans blowing air from the sidewalk out through that hole. This is a bit
more difficult because you then need fans pushing air all the way back to
stairs, and then up...
	Or someone could work on getting the big fan in there working (the
power box has a big circuit for it if I remember correctly...

	Then as a note to people going to that space:
	I have never seen anyone taking water from people at the door. 
There is a time for bitching about what promoters need to provide at
parties, but damn, don't people going to parties have some responsibility
for themselves or are raves going to be baby sitting sessions?  Granted if
someone takes your water at the door, then the promoters need to provide
it inside, but that isn't the case here.

Once upon a time, Byroni done said:

Then boomerang mentioned:

So Byroni replied:

And now boomerang is saying:

Most of my friends are horrified when they learn that before I was a
peace-suckling ravechild, I was a member of the United States Armed Forces.

To friends in the States, I was The Boomerang; the stick that won't quit.
But to my comrades in the 211th Artillery Unit stationed on the Kuwait-Iraqi
border, I was known as Lt. Col. Boomerang Fidget.  Let me tell you, my
friends: it was hell.  

We  had sandstorms, diarrhea, and viruses you can't even pronounce.  No one
knew when Sodamn Insane would launch his next attack.  We lived in endless
fear of the bomb sirens.  Human life:  so solid and defined;  yet our only
constant is that we totter on the brink of death at every moment.

On September 15, PFC Anderson MacLain came into my tent.  "Lt.Col. Fidget!
he cried.  "General Fuss wants to see you in his tent, at once!"

I rushed to the General's tent.  
"Fidget,"  the General howled.  "I have an assignment for you!"
"Please, sir,"  I begged.  "Not latrine duty again.  "Last time, the other
fellas pushed me through the hole and laughed at me."

"Shut, up, Fidget!"  he snarled.  "Stop whining like a teenager in a damn
boyscout camp.  This is the reconaissance mission you've been waiting for.
I have a frightening mission for you."

I clicked my heels and stood up straight, just like they taught me in boot
camp.   

"OK, Fidget; here's the low-down.  We've spotted a swarm of aircraft heading
toward the camp.  I want you to go onto the southwest ridge and get a look
at them.  I need to know if they're friends, or enemies."

"Yes, Sir!"  I bellowed, and rushed out of the tent.  This was my big chance
to impresss my girl back home, and I had no time to waste.  I packed my M-16
and my binoculars, then PFC Anderson MacLain drove me to the foot of the
mountain.  From there I went on foot...alone.

At the crest of the ridge, I saw a swarm of fighter jets on the horizon,
blasting through the golden heat of the desert morning.  Sure enough, there
were at least thirty jets, heading our way, and fast.

"Charlie-Echo One to Base,"  I said into the radio.  "I've spotted thirty
planes heading our way from 27 degrees southwest."

"Fidget!"  the radio squawked.   "Before we launch a string of rockets and
blow these bastards out of the sky, we need to know:  are they friends, or
enemies?"

I took one last look through my binocs.  Sweat fell from my forehead in
dizzy anticipation of my patriotic reward.  This was my one chance to make a
stand and prove myself a man worthy of the United States Marine Corps.

"Well, Sir,"  I said into the radio.  "They're all flying side-by-side...so
I guess they're friends."

saturday, a party by RAS, i was there from 4-5 pm.  about 25 dedicated
ravers and a sound system.  pretty cool.  thanks guys, wish you'd gotten
more turnout, it was a beautiful day and a nice event.


today (monday), another beautiful party by some FnF-type folks, crowd at
about 30-40, i was there from 4:30 to 7.  a lot of wonderful people and a
lot of excellent music.  weather was a bit cold, but that just meant i had
to DANCE!  finally met sfravers Jondabomb and Claudia (Klaudja) and
re-aquainted myself with a number of people who i'd met sometime somewhere
but didn't really remember.  wish i could have stayed longer but the cold
finally got to me.

THANK YOU everyone who keeps throwing nice afternoon parties for us.  they
just brighten up an afternoon like nothing else.  and please don't let low
turnout discourage you, small parties can be really great!

love,

brian

 I have had experience at keeping a hot, muggy/moist enviroment cool and 
dry. The big thing to do is _remove_ the hot moist air. Just pumping cold 
air in will not do it. The hot moist air is difficult to displace. 
Provide an adequete vent/air outlet(s) (preferably near the top of the 
dance floor as hot air rises) and stick the biggest fan you can on it to 
suck the hot air out of that area. If you have additional fans _then_ 
try to pump some cold air in. Also a big thing is to keep the air on the 
dance floor circulating so that the moisture has a chance to move out 
with the hot air.

Hmmm, I guess I was just focusing too much on the amazing music (which I
saw no mention of in your post) that was happening to worry about all the
drunken fools and cliquish poseurs.  I don't know, the vibe was pretty
thick in the middle of the dance floor when Jeno was spinning one of the
best sets I have ever heard from him and the boys from france were laying
down the grooves.  I saw lots of cool people that all smiled back when I
smiled at them.  I am sorry you had some bad experiences, but there was
definitely fun to be had and some incredible music to be enjoyed on a
crazy sound system out by the bay on a warm spring evening.  Oh, and virgin
prob. co-sponsored the thing because Daft Punk's record happens to be on
the label (it is a really f*cking good record, btw).  Did any other 
sfravers go to this and enjoy themselves?  Just curious. 

Cheers***
Cami

I absolutely agree that people should take responsibility for themselves,
but unfortunately:  a) people *don't* take responsibility for themselves,
and b) we live in a litigious society that more or less holds a venue
responsible for many of the the irresponsibilities of its patrons.
Therefore, the venue should be able to make a plausible case that they
provided an environment that minimized the chances of shit happening.


No, i'm not a lawyer.  I'm just concerned about being able to use the
space in the future is all. If i went over the top about that, I
apologize.

> feel that there were enough waterstations.

        When I was downstairs at Comet just going OFF during Anon's set,
Damien (one of the Lightseed family) was handing out free bottles of nice
cold Calistoga water to the dancers. There was no table - he was just out
dancing on the floor and handing out free cold water. Maybe it's a little too
scattershot, and people got missed, but it seemed like a nice touch ...
