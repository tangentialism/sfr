Must be about that time! :)

In January of 2008, we brought you a show we lovingly called "The New Sound
of Detroit", showcasing some of the Motor City's brightest "new school"
talents. This month, we return to the birthplace of techno to present
another crop of talented artists representing the current sound of this mos=
t
influential and legendary city.

While Mike Huckaby is far from an up-and-comer (he's in fact been working
the decks since the early 80's) he's never fallen into the "has been"
category, currently producing, remixing, and DJing as much as younger
artists just hitting their stride. Known as a "DJ's DJ", Mike understands
(and lived!) the roots of house, techno, and Detroit's "hi-tech soul" and
seamlessly weaves them together to present a portrait of modern dance music
where genres and scenes take a back seat to quality music and talent.
Joining Mike are Shaun Reeves (a close associate of Seth Troxler, Ryan
Crosson, Lee Curtiss, et al.) who has spent the last several years injectin=
g
his Detroit influences into Berlin's vibrant scene, and Luke Hess, who has
been making waves worldwide with his deep dub-influenced techno, and just
performed live on the main stage at this year's DEMF. Taken collectively,
these three talents represent a powerhouse of varying styles which all show
their common ancestry and appreciation for timeless music with depth and
soul.

This will be an unforgettable evening of music for (and by) those who see
beyond the hype, and simply love great dance music.

We hope you can join us.

-----> Greg Bird and the [KONTROL] Crew

MIKE HUCKABY

Mike Huckaby has become the busiest remixer from Detroit in the past few
years. He's also been producing music on his 2 labels Deep Transportation,
and S Y N T H, which are well known amongst underground DJs worldwide. With
highly acclaimed deep house productions and remixes for Deepchord, Juan
Atkins, Vladislav Delay, Pole, Loco Dice, and Pacou to name just a few, Mik=
e
sees no end in the near future.

As a DJ, Mike Huckaby has been touring and playing extensively through out
Europe and the rest of the world in recent years, playing at the finest
clubs in the world, while bringing the Detroit sound of deep electronic
music with him.  Mike Huckaby knows the balance between house and techno
like no other. Promoters know that they can put Mike Huckaby in any room!

In his spare time, Mike teaches aspiring young musicians how to use
electronic music production software such as Reaktor and Ableton at
Youthville In Detroit.

The "Detroit Metro Times" had this to say about him:

Mike Huckaby is a dance music purist extraordinaire. He=92s the kind who kn=
ows
all the roots and culture of electronic dance music, who sees beyond the
hype and divisions in the scene and knows exactly what this music is, the
kind of purist whose love for music has literally had him flown around the
globe.

For years Huckaby has been consistently supplying the Detroit community wit=
h
quality dance music from around the world in a variety of styles,
emphasizing what=92s best about each with a range from Kerri Chandler to Ba=
sic
Channel. Though synonymous with the Record Time Dance Room, he has done far
more than give blank stares to people asking for the =93Chuck Chuck=94 reco=
rd
(one of the burdens of working at a record store is having its clientele
sing you instrumental songs to identify a record: please bring in tapes) an=
d
point new DJs to quality records. He=92s produced quality house and techno =
for
noted local labels Harmony Park and Definitive as well as overseas labels
such as Ferox and Cross Section =97 and his lifelong DJ career has taken hi=
m
from the Music Institute to as far away as Germany and Japan.

What people often don=92t know about Huckaby is that behind the neutral fac=
e
there=92s an agenda going on. This could be hard to tell from a man whose
mission is to "just push the music and leave everything else behind." Huck=
=92s
main issue is that he has "hated to see house and techno so divided," urgin=
g
people to see "the similarities rather than the differences." Any true fan
of dance music sees beyond the boundaries and just finds quality music. Huc=
k
has always done just that, being one the most consistent people ever in the
Detroit scene. You can always expect quality from this man.

SHAUN REEVES

A Detroit native whose move to Berlin was ahead of its time, for the last
four years Shaun Reeves has been enthralling European audiences with his ow=
n
highly distinctive mixture of American house, both classic and contemporary=
,
and the deepest, most cutting edge aspects of minimal techno and tech-house=
.
In addition to playing in Berlin=92s celebrated Panorama Bar, Watergate, Ar=
ena
Club, and the legendary Beatstreet loft parties, he has appeared in Robert
Johnson (Frankfurt), T-Bar (London), Wolf + Lamb (NYC), Bunker (NYC), End U=
p
(San Francisco), Cocoliche (Buenos Aires), La Sala (Bogota), Harry Klein
(Munich), and many other clubs and parties in Europe, North and South
America.

While searching deep in the back catalogue of house and techno for forgotte=
n
tracks that sound decidedly fresh and exciting, Shaun remains committed to
pushing all genres of dance music forward. His is music not just for the
dance floor, but also for the body, soul=85and brain. As the recent resurge=
nce
of interest in the border between house and techno makes all too clear,
Shaun has always been one to set musical trends rather than follow them.

Best known for his collaborative work as Uli Kunkel and with Miss Fitz,
Shaun has recently been working with fellow Detroit-native Seth Troxler, a
collaboration that will appear on Raum, as well as with Argentina=92s Dilo.
Recently he has begun to produce on his own, crafting elegant house music
that has learned from the best aspects of minimal, but bringing back an
element of emotional depth often lacking from that genre. And as friends an=
d
family know, Shaun=92s re-edits are highly sought after by Djs and music
lovers, often stripping the music to its barest elements but in the process
bringing out a depth and complexity lacking in the original.

LUKE HESS

Born in 1980 and raised in the Detroit area, Luke Hess has harnessed a deep
appreciation for electronic music and the expression of the underground
movement.  His background in mathematics and engineering has given him a
scientific approach to the dance floor, using frequencies, tones, and
soundscapes to transform surroundings and mood.

His faith based music production has landed him a seat with FXHE and Berett=
a
Music in Detroit.  His debut album was released in early May 2009 by Denmar=
k
based label Echocord, which features remixes by Mikkel Metal, CV313, and
Marko Furstenberg.  His solo work on FXHE includes Dubout EP #1 which was
charted in 2007 on Groove magazines top 50 releases of the year.  His music
is getting played and charted by many artists including Marcel Dettmann,
 Falko Brockseiper, MIA, Lawrence, and Luciano.  His work on Beretta Grey
was also featured in a Mix on the Renaissance label mixed by Steve Lawler.
 Luke has recently been picked up by a Swedish based techno label as well,
Kontra-Musik, with his release =93Believe and Receive=94, which landed him =
an
interview on Sweden=92s Groove Magazine in 2008.

With 8 years of DJ experience, he is regarded as a perfectionist in his Liv=
e
sets and behind the decks layering his tracks in a very detailed and
hypnotic manner.  Luke has played at notable venues and events such as
Culture Box (Copenhagen), Panorama Bar (Berlin), Detroit Electronic Music
Festival (Detroit), Fabric (London), and The Bunker (NYC).  He has notable
mixes online and in 2003 recorded a promotional mix CD release for
UR/Submerge.  Luke=92s continued hard work behind the decks and in the stud=
io
combined with his unyielding interest in technology and sound will no doubt
stimulate the boundaries of electronic music.

Hey Kevin,

Get in touch with Leon Cook.  He does sound for a good number of parties in
the bay.  You can PM him on bayraves. His screen name is 'leon' on there. I
don't know if he has a website or not. If he doesn't work out for you, try
Brian Frost at Fsound. His website is fsound.net.  I have worked with both
of them in the past, and have a large amount of respect for both.  With
that said, talk to Leon first.  He has the most experience, and the people
who work for him are top notch and totally know what they're doing.

Cheers,
-Mitch

Hi All:

Going through a few boxes today and found a $15 store credit for Amoeba
Music.  I'm not in the Bay area and so will send it to the first person to
send me their address.

Subject: [sfraves] How to beat a drug test??

Hey ya'll. My friend has a drug test coming up to get a great new job.
He never smoked weed ever, but just recently has started smoking every
so often, like once a week. Besides garlic and cranberry juice, are
there any tactics he can use to help him beat this test? It's silly to
begin with, but I just thought ya'll might know somthing. Thanks in
advance!

Les

If they want to drug test him, it can't be that good a job... regardless,
your best bet is a shit ton of water, and to be honest, the only thing that
fixes this shit is time, so he needs to stop smoking something like 2.5
months before this test.

Well I agree that there are a lot less people on the list of course.  Lots of reasons for that.  But regardless, every year for many years at this time this list has gone quiet.  This was true even when the list was quite a bit bigger...

What's attractive? Anthropology and sexuality studies suggest that the
only thing that is found 'attractive' universally across cultures is showing
the ability to move. That's why everybody dances according to reproductive
biologists. They argue that when we dance we're just saying that we're healthy
enough to promulgate the species.

> This is everything that is wrong with Africa.

Except it's not Africa.

It's Jamaica, and it's a dance fad called daggering:

Major Lazer is a project by DJs Diplo and Switch that they did in Jamaica:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Lazer

Thus the daggerin' and other Jamaican references.

What's attractive? Anthropology and sexuality studies suggest that the
only thing that is found 'attractive' universally across cultures is showing
the ability to move. That's why everybody dances according to reproductive
biologists. They argue that when we dance we're just saying that we're healthy
enough to promulgate the species.

> This is everything that is wrong with Africa.

Except it's not Africa.

It's Jamaica, and it's a dance fad called daggering:
http://tinyurl.com/dmebvy

Major Lazer is a project by DJs Diplo and Switch that they did in Jamaica:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Lazer

Thus the daggerin' and other Jamaican references.

Subject: [sfraves] Poland Warsaw help - ravers to the rescue?

Hi fellow ravers,
Wondering if anyone knows of any raves, UG's, cool clubs or local promotions/DJs to check out in Warsaw Poland??
Need a nightlife scene out here badly :-) (rather skip the hoydy toydy clubs/tourist traps/meat markets)
Muchas gracias for any info...
Will be glad to report a review in return.

Thank you!!

I don't know a whole lot about the scene in Warsaw, but there is definitely
some sort of EDM scene in Poland for sure - I just came back from the
Audioriver Festival in P=C5=82ock last weekend, which was pretty epic. Vide=

You could just hop on the Berlin-Warszawa express and come to the real
party....  :P

I would think that would be offensive only to those with no basis in  
reality, but I can try-

That first one looks like a man- a bad man.
And that second one- well- I don't know if she's been hit to many  
times or not enough-
I'll stop there-

If you're asking me to applaud a musically horrible track, by two  
otherwise-decent producers who went to Jamaica and co-opted a  
localized "dance craze" that is a reflection of the primitive  
mentality that supports rape as a war tactic (causing a comedic  
rampant increase in dick injuries on the island), and then had a video  
made by an otherwise-humorous comedian that simply makes fun of such  
base levels of existence- well- I don't really think it's me being the  
offensive party there :)

For contrast, I provide you with this example- musically solid, not  
perpetuating ape-like behavior, and featuring some of the finest  
female specimens I've seen in a music video in a long time:

Now see I like both tracks.  

I thought the first video was weird and funny.  Charles Hamilton is great and I love that track, but the video is rather boring and not going anywhere.  The Pon De Floor video is crazy and original.  

Also it seems to piss some people off; always the sign of a good track IMO.

Now see I like both tracks.  

I thought the first video was weird and funny.  Charles Hamilton is great and I love that track, but the video is rather boring and not going anywhere.  The Pon De Floor video is crazy and original.  

Also it seems to piss some people off; always the sign of a good track IMO.

I would think that would be offensive only to those with no basis in reality, but I can try-

That first one looks like a man- a bad man.
And that second one- well- I don't know if she's been hit to many times or not enough-
I'll stop there-

If you're asking me to applaud a musically horrible track, by two otherwise-decent producers who went to Jamaica and co-opted a localized "dance craze" that is a reflection of the primitive mentality that supports rape as a war tactic (causing a comedic rampant increase in dick injuries on the island), and then had a video made by an otherwise-humorous comedian that simply makes fun of such base levels of existence- well- I don't really think it's me being the offensive party there :)

For contrast, I provide you with this example- musically solid, not perpetuating ape-like behavior, and featuring some of the finest female specimens I've seen in a music video in a long time:

Wow, this is all that's wrong with the most shallow sort of asshole
that makes the US the crap hole that it is. Haven't you ever seen a
real woman in your life?  I've got to wonder sometimes about people.

Imagine your sister, and your mother, and your daughter all bent over  
and jiggling their asses taunting men to come up and ram them  
repeatedly as hard as they can from behind, then rolling over and  
smacking their twat while flashing a grin and licking their lips, all  
in the middle of a club, and all because the selektah said "see a  
bitch goan daggah heh now!"

If your level of what you find attractive is to this level of depth,  
then I guess yes, mine is comparatively shallow.

In the schools I went to attractive was defined as an adjective.
You're using it as an adverb, thus the confusion.

Apparently I wasn't alone in taking offense.

dance craze which doctors warn as equally dangerous. Doctors have been
seeing the increase of injury cases and has attributed it to the
popularity of the dance.
=93During very rigorous intercourse the man can hit the woman=92s pubic
bone and sustain a fracture. There is a loud popping sound,
excruciating pain and swelling,=94 a Jamaican doctor said. The warn that
the injuries can be permanent.

daggering lyrics.

Poly is still up in Seattle.  We talk from time to time.

Noizebridge is sort of the Neo Newhack as far as tech goes.  It's about

PS- Hi guys.  I'm still around.  Been busy.

--000e0ce04ada1741390471a2ebfd
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello all, I'm putting together an end of summer party and I'm looking for a
number of things. First off it's a free party, and I'm trying to pay as
minimally as possible so this is targeted at people who just want to help to
make an awesome party. So we're looking for DJ's, ideas for an outdoors
area, fire-breathers, make-up artists, actors, musicians, decorators, a
sound system and a lighting system (basically everything). Any help would be
greatly appreciated and of course all are invited so long as they are
looking for a good time.

The premise is a communal party in which as many people help out as
possible, so that we can keep the cover free while still providing an
awesome, fun and friendly atmosphere for the end of summer.

Thanks,
-Lazlo

Is the location secured already?

Is it permitted, underground, and/or outdoor? Venue details 
would help.

I'd
also like to point out that this is not a free venture.  Someone will
have to pay for this.  Getting a legit permit will cost money,
generator gas and (rental?) will cost money.  Even the wear and tear
on said (free) sound and lighting gear costs the owner money in wear
and tear.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR?: Mexico decriminalizes small-scale drug possession

--0015174c11865c187d0471a87565

MEXICO CITY =97 Mexico decriminalized small amounts of marijuana, cocaine a=
nd
heroin on Friday =97 a move that prosecutors say makes sense even in the mi=
dst
of the government's grueling battle against drug traffickers.

Prosecutors said the new law sets clear limits that keep Mexico's
corruption-prone police from extorting casual users and offers addicts free
treatment to keep growing domestic drug use in check.

"This is not legalization, this is regulating the issue and giving citizens
greater legal certainty," said Bernardo Espino del Castillo of the attorney
general's office.

The new law sets out maximum "personal use" amounts for drugs, also
including LSD and methamphetamine. People detained with those quantities no
longer face criminal prosecution.

Espino del Castillo says, in practice, small users almost never did face
charges anyway. Under the previous law, the possession of any amount of
drugs was punishable by stiff jail sentences, but there was leeway for
addicts caught with smaller amounts.

"We couldn't charge somebody who was in possession of a dose of a drug,
there was no way ... because the person would claim they were an addict," h=
e
said.

Despite the provisions, police sometimes hauled in suspects and demanded
bribes, threatening long jail sentences if people did not pay.

"The bad thing was that it was left up to the discretion of the detective,
and it could open the door to corruption or extortion," Espino del Castillo
said.

Anyone caught with drug amounts under the new personal-use limit will be
encouraged to seek treatment, and for those caught a third time treatment i=
s
mandatory.

The maximum amount of marijuana for "personal use" under the new law is 5
grams =97 the equivalent of about four joints. The limit is a half gram for
cocaine, the equivalent of about 4 "lines." For other drugs, the limits are
50 milligrams of heroin, 40 milligrams for methamphetamine and 0.015
milligrams for LSD.

Mexico has emphasized the need to differentiate drug addicts and casual
users from the violent traffickers whose turf battles have contributed to
the deaths of more than 11,000 people since President Felipe Calderon took
office in late 2006.

But one expert saw potential for conflict under the new law.

Javier Oliva, a political scientist at Mexico's National Autonomous
University, said the new law posed "a serious contradiction" for the
Calderon administration.

"If they decriminalize drugs it could lead the army, which has been given
the task of combating this, to say 'What are we doing'?" he said.

Officials said the legal changes could help the government focus more on
big-time traffickers.

Espino del Castillo said since Calderon took office, there have been over
15,000 police searches related to small-scale drug dealing or possession,
with 95,000 people detained =97 but only 12 to 15 percent of whom were ever
charged with anything.

Is he a person some of us will recognize from meatspace?  I suspect her
point being related to the concept that, if any of the rest of us were
trying to throw a party, we'd be asking people we KNOW first... Asking
people you've done nothing to endear yourself for favors, well, it's an
interesting strategy.  Yes, some of us would post here, but that's because
most of the people on this list have known each other for years now.
Sure, plenty of people on this list are doing parties for the love.  Most of
us do have to pay bills and spend a lot of time working to make sure we can
afford to do that, however, so when we give away our time and resources, we
like to know it's not to some random jackwad who's going to waste everyone's
time, so an open call is pretty rare these parts, as you've likely noticed
while lurking.  And, given the recent trouble that so many parties have
experienced, a little skepticism and even suspicion when someone just pops
up and says "hey, let's do a party!" seems healthy.

All true, although, if it was a perfect storm of party 
conditions, say for example... lazlo is an experienced 
transplant that just got a lock on a killer location, and the 
right people were approached..who knows I might jump into that.

Which is why details are helpful.

Thanks Terry for the information. This will be my first outdoors type of
gig.

I feel it if people have doubts with this, it's pretty natural. I have only
a bit of experience with small events (60-80 folks) but mostly I was just
hoping that some of you guys would be interested in helping out. I've talked
to friends about helping out and they're down for this, just trying to
expand horizons and let you folks know about it. Another thing is that I'm
trying to make this something different, something where it's not just my
party but everybody's party in a very real way, it requires a leap of faith
but I think that it'll work out. Right now it's looking like it'll be
outdoor and underground. Anybody have any ideas for venues? That's the
biggest concern right now. We have a sound system and three dj's lined up so
far. I can probably get two bands by the end of today.

Also, thanks to Orotoro, anything and everything is always appreciated.

I'd say it's good for small gatherings, etc- no sound or anything, really.  Too exposed, I think.

Is Stinson Beach good for parties? I remember having a bonfire there a while
back and that was fun. I'll check up on the legality of that.

The majority of stinson falls under the governance of the GGNRA, which is
ran by the National Parks.  Last I heard, doing a permitted beach party w/
amplified sound ran around $1000 on GGNRA lands.  If you've got the dough,
you can put on a great party in some really nice spots.
I've looked high and low, and maybe someone else on this list knows a
venue/park I haven't run across that's cheaper, but the cheapest public park
that I came across in the bay area was for $250 which includes amplified
sound, and it's in Marin County.  There are a few other renegade spots that
you could likely get away with for a day party, but they're not as nice as
say, stinson beach.

Not legal and not a good location.  IMO.

Applying for a permit and getting one are two different things though...

The majority of stinson falls under the governance of the GGNRA, which is
ran by the National Parks.  Last I heard, doing a permitted beach party w/
amplified sound ran around $1000 on GGNRA lands.  If you've got the dough,
you can put on a great party in some really nice spots.
I've looked high and low, and maybe someone else on this list knows a
venue/park I haven't run across that's cheaper, but the cheapest public park
that I came across in the bay area was for $250 which includes amplified
sound, and it's in Marin County.  There are a few other renegade spots that
you could likely get away with for a day party, but they're not as nice as
say, stinson beach.

Well, welcome!  It's always good to get new blood as it's much tastier.
 Alas, seriously, venues are what we're all coming up short on these days...
The last couple successful UGs/Renegades I've been to were deep, so much so
that some of the people involved in throwing the party weren't sure what was
going on til the day of the event... I could seriously pull together a party
or two a month for the rest of the year in terms of crews and gear if we
just had the venues.  Hopefully you think of some spots the rest of us
haven't... There are almost certainly warehouses going unused that we just
haven't noticed (which would be the point, right?) with enough natural sound
dampening to hide something.  Outdoors are trickier of course as most have
very obvious public approaches, but again, if you can spot one, you've got
your ticket.

Just wanted to see whats up with sfr. I'm still alive, doing well, actually
much better then I was doing when I was last here (3 years ago???).

I got into maplestory 8-x

Anyway just wanted to say hi to all my old friends here.

Rave related:

I recently remembered a song/experience that I forgot about:  New Order's
Temptation leading into Chemical Brother's Star Guitar.

Good Times.

later,
Steve

So here's the lowdown.  We've got what was once a pristine beach that just
needs some lovin' to help return it to its natural glory.  It seems over the
past year the place has accumulated quite  bit of trash, and we're hoping to
get all of our friends to help us clean the place up.  And what better way
to do this with the sound of electronic music filling the ocean air!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: Community Party in the East Bay

As a former NPS employee with the GGNRA I thought I'd chime in.  Stinson Be=
ach or anywhere in the GGNRA for any kind of big party with amplified music=
 is a bad idea.  Its almost impossible to get a permit for amplified music =
and if you do the national park police will be there in force.  They are a =
bunch of assholes who like nothing more than to arrest people for stupid st=
uff.  The rangers are not much better but some of them are not dicks.  When=
 it comes to stinson at night there are three rangers that live about 200 f=
eet from the main beach.  They stop patroling at around 10pm and will only =
respond if they are not drunkand get a call or hear something otherwise mar=
in county sheriff respond. =20

So in a nut shell I would not try to put on any party at Stinson.  With the=
 budget cuts state parks seem to be safer.

So we have a tentative location in Alameda. Only hangup is we'd have to be
out by 2, I figure we can star earlier though. It's in a residential area
but the neighbors are noise friendly. We wouldn't be able to serve alcohol
at the party but whatever folks do before or after is fine. I'll keep folks
in the loop.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: Community Party in the East Bay

Just to refresh everyone's memory - "back in the day"  Frequency 8 did a
whole series of parties out at Stinson Beach - and we only got shut down
once - it helped (A LOT) that I lived there then . . . and . . .=20

Hell - we even did a full-on day party right in the middle of town on =
the
Fourth of July !!!

Hey CG, stickman, KitteKat, et all..

Well, unfortuntely when I got laid off and was out of work about 3
years ago, I sold my studio and I basically lived off buying selling
equipment for six months. I had so much equipment that was rare/old/analog
it was so sad to see it all go, but at the time it was the only way to pay
rent. I'm still upset about it to this day and haven't produced anything
since (or dj'ed for that matter since I sold my tables too). One of these
days I will start collecting again and build up a studio and start producing
again. I would do it now, But, that stupid word "responsibility" keeps
bugging me to save up for a house where I could make a real real studio.

I know I will regret posting this here, and I'm not sure anyone would even
be interested, but it's really a story I havent told anyone and luckily it's
not that easy to go through the archieves.

There were other reasons I removed myself from
producing/dj'ing/clubbing/electronic music/sfr.  I kinda had to make a break
from everything that reminded me of certain things. I stopped visiting the
3rd plateau on a daily basis (which was a freaking crazy couple of months)
we're talking electric shocks running through my body and chit like that. I
took up ebay tea which was what helped get me off it, but then when I went
to quit that I went through trainspotting like dead babies laying next to me
and wanting to just die to not feel that way anymore. Well, with me and my
semi-legal, connection-less scientific experiements I turned to costco and
would solve the lack of afganistanly plants in my system with it's
synthetic, legal equivalent (of course with a blood brain barrier booster
mixed in, dont ask me). This actually turned out to be a positive thing
since it didn't have any effects other then make me happy (and clog me up
big time). Finally I was free from those 6 years of almost daily hardcore
solutions to coughing and I didn't want anything to remind me of it so I
quit everything that I had enjoyed with it.

I got a good job at a startup, I started programming more. Even better, I
was getting paid to write code. The startup got bought by a large computer
company that is a last name. I bought myself a road bike and I ride it daily
and often commute with it. he he I lost weight. I'm currently writing
programs in java for the android platform. but with the economy the way it
is it looks like my department may possibly get hacked off in the future, so
as always, it goes in waves.

I really miss the people,dancing, music, and all the love. It's been way too
long. Well, I'm now confident to come back, but not with the ghetto chit. I
was stuck in before. 8-p  Bring on the hardcore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hi

Hey CG, stickman, KitteKat, et all..

Well, unfortuntely when I got laid off and was out of work about 3
years ago, I sold my studio and I basically lived off buying selling
equipment for six months. I had so much equipment that was rare/old/analog
it was so sad to see it all go, but at the time it was the only way to pay
rent. I'm still upset about it to this day and haven't produced anything
since (or dj'ed for that matter since I sold my tables too). One of these
days I will start collecting again and build up a studio and start producing
again. I would do it now, But, that stupid word "responsibility" keeps
bugging me to save up for a house where I could make a real real studio.

I know I will regret posting this here, and I'm not sure anyone would even
be interested, but it's really a story I havent told anyone and luckily it's
not that easy to go through the archieves.

There were other reasons I removed myself from
producing/dj'ing/clubbing/electronic music/sfr.  I kinda had to make a break
from everything that reminded me of certain things. I stopped visiting the
3rd plateau on a daily basis (which was a freaking crazy couple of months)
we're talking electric shocks running through my body and chit like that. I
took up ebay tea which was what helped get me off it, but then when I went
to quit that I went through trainspotting like dead babies laying next to me
and wanting to just die to not feel that way anymore. Well, with me and my
semi-legal, connection-less scientific experiements I turned to costco and
would solve the lack of afganistanly plants in my system with it's
synthetic, legal equivalent (of course with a blood brain barrier booster
mixed in, dont ask me). This actually turned out to be a positive thing
since it didn't have any effects other then make me happy (and clog me up
big time). Finally I was free from those 6 years of almost daily hardcore
solutions to coughing and I didn't want anything to remind me of it so I
quit everything that I had enjoyed with it.

I got a good job at a startup, I started programming more. Even better, I
was getting paid to write code. The startup got bought by a large computer
company that is a last name. I bought myself a road bike and I ride it daily
and often commute with it. he he I lost weight. I'm currently writing
programs in java for the android platform. but with the economy the way it
is it looks like my department may possibly get hacked off in the future, so
as always, it goes in waves.

I really miss the people,dancing, music, and all the love. It's been way too
long. Well, I'm now confident to come back, but not with the ghetto chit. I
was stuck in before. 8-p  Bring on the hardcore.

Hey CG, stickman, KitteKat, et all..

Well, unfortuntely when I got laid off and was out of work about 3
years ago, I sold my studio and I basically lived off buying selling
equipment for six months. I had so much equipment that was rare/old/analog
it was so sad to see it all go, but at the time it was the only way to pay
rent. I'm still upset about it to this day and haven't produced anything
since (or dj'ed for that matter since I sold my tables too). One of these
days I will start collecting again and build up a studio and start producin=
g
again. I would do it now, But, that stupid word "responsibility" keeps
bugging me to save up for a house where I could make a real real studio.

I know I will regret posting this here, and I'm not sure anyone would even
be interested, but it's really a story I havent told anyone and luckily it'=
s
not that easy to go through the archieves.

There were other reasons I removed myself from
producing/dj'ing/clubbing/electronic music/sfr.=A0 I kinda had to make a br=
eak
from everything that reminded me of certain things. I stopped visiting the
3rd plateau on a daily basis (which was a freaking crazy couple of months)
we're talking electric shocks running through my body and chit like that. I
took up ebay tea which was what helped get me off it, but then when I went
to quit that I went through trainspotting like dead babies laying next to m=
e
and wanting to just die to not feel that way anymore. Well, with me and my
semi-legal, connection-less scientific experiements I turned to costco and
would solve the lack of afganistanly plants in my system with it's
synthetic, legal equivalent (of course with a blood brain barrier booster
mixed in, dont ask me). This actually turned out to be a positive thing
since it didn't have any effects other then make me happy (and clog me up
big time). Finally I was free from those 6 years of almost daily hardcore
solutions to coughing and I didn't want anything to remind me of it so I
quit everything that I had enjoyed with it.

I got a good job at a startup, I started programming more. Even better, I
was getting paid to write code. The startup got bought by a large computer
company that is a last name. I bought myself a road bike and I ride it dail=
y
and often commute with it. he he I lost weight. I'm currently writing
programs in java for the android platform. but with the economy the way it
is it looks like my department may possibly get hacked off in the future, s=
o
as always, it goes in waves.

I really miss the people,dancing, music, and all the love. It's been way to=
o
long. Well, I'm now confident to come back, but not with the ghetto chit. I
was stuck in before. 8-p=A0 Bring on the hardcore.

There have been a number of times I can remember, Cloudfactory 
specifically, where we coincided a beach party with a beach 
cleanup. Rangers/Cops were really nice :-) Especially when we 
already had a pile of bags at the trailhead to show off our 
efforts.

Props :-)

So here's the lowdown.  We've got what was once a pristine beach that just
needs some lovin' to help return it to its natural glory.  It seems over the
past year the place has accumulated quite  bit of trash, and we're hoping to
get all of our friends to help us clean the place up.  And what better way
to do this with the sound of electronic music filling the ocean air!

What did you have to do to make those Stinson Beach parties work? What sort
of permits were needed, how large were the parties, etc.

Also on a different note, where is a good place to get generators from?

Doing another one tonight.  You guys remember insurtial music?  Ya, it's
not dead. Opening doors in a few hours.  Going all night (Underground
alive and well)

Same place we had Adriana's fund raisers a few years back.


----------------

DIE MASCHINEN
We don't do Sexy Back, or know what a holler back girl is


AUGUST 2009
Geburtstag Maschinen: Leo's unite!

Makita, Shatter, and I'm sure others, have had or are having their
birthdays.

PUNCH AND PIE.  Well, Cake at least. 

DJ's: Makita, Shatter, Mechagojira, DJ Unit 69 (Big Pimpin)
Music:  Industrial, Industrial, Industrial
Ya, some EBM, Power Noize, Terror EBM, and a bunch of other stupid names
to say "Industrial"


DRESS CODE: People are catching on. 
Industrial/Utilitarian/Black/Uniforms/Fetish/Rubber and yes, GothWear is
ok too, even if you shop at Hot Topic.  VERBOTEN: Khakis, Old Navy,
Diesel,  anything Abercrombie, Day Glow, Glow Sticks, Weebos and shitty
attitudes.

11pm - ???
$5
Same Underground location for almost 3 years running! (Ask a DJ if you
don't know by now)

We brought in some new speakers.  400W of balanced sound.  It's
improved.  They're also mounted up above for better sound spread.

SFR-Planners did a renegade a bit north of there, like 8 years 
ago. Subsequent attempts by other crews had problems. I think 
part of the problem is there's a single fire access road (easy to be 
blocked off), and it's a really loooong walk.

TULSA, Okla. =96 This is the new formula for methamphetamine: a two-liter s=
oda
bottle, a few handfuls of cold pills and some noxious chemicals. Shake the
bottle and the volatile reaction produces one of the world's most addictive
drugs.

Only a few years ago, making meth required an elaborate lab =97 with filthy
containers simmering over open flames, cans of flammable liquids and
hundreds of pills. The process gave off foul odors, sometimes sparked
explosions and was so hard to conceal that dealers often "cooked" their
drugs in rural areas.

But now drug users are making their own meth in small batches using a
faster, cheaper and much simpler method with ingredients that can be carrie=
d
in a knapsack and mixed on the run. The "shake-and-bake" approach has becom=
e
popular because it requires a relatively small number of pills of the
decongestant pseudoephedrine =97 an amount easily obtained under even the
toughest anti-meth laws that have been adopted across the nation to restric=
t
large purchases of some cold medication.

"Somebody somewhere said 'Wait this requires a lot less pseudoephedrine, an=
d
I can fly under the radar,'" said Mark Woodward, spokesman for the Oklahoma
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control.

An Associated Press review of lab seizures and interviews with state
and federal
law enforcement agents found that the new method is rapidly spreading acros=
s
the nation's midsection and is contributing to a spike in the number of met=
h
cases after years of declining arrests.

The new formula does away with the clutter of typical meth labs, and it can
turn the back seat of a car or a bathroom stall into a makeshift drug
factory. Some addicts have even made the drug while driving.

The pills are crushed, combined with some common household chemicals and
then shaken in the soda bottle. No flame is required.

Using the new formula, batches of meth are much smaller but just as
dangerous as the old system, which sometimes produces powerful explosions,
touches off intense fires and releases drug ingredients that must be handle=
d
as toxic waste.

"If there is any oxygen at all in the bottle, it has a propensity to make a
giant fireball," said Sgt. Jason Clark of the Missouri State Highway
Patrol's Division of Drug and Crime Control. "You're not dealing with rocke=
t
scientists here anyway. If they get unlucky at all, it can have a very
devastating reaction."

One little mistake, such as unscrewing the bottle cap too fast, can result
in a huge blast, and police in Alabama, Oklahoma and other states have
linked dozens of flash fires this year =97 some of them fatal =97 to meth
manufacturing.

"Every meth recipe is dangerous, but in this one, if you don't shake it jus=
t
right, you can build up too much pressure, and the container can pop,"
Woodward said.

When fire broke out in older labs, "it was usually on a stove in a back roo=
m
or garage and people would just run, but when these things pop, you see mor=
e
extreme burns because they are holding it. There are more fires and more
burns because of the close proximity, whether it's on a couch or driving
down the road."

After the chemical reaction, what's left is a crystalline powder that users
smoke, snort or inject. They often discard the bottle, which now contains a
poisonous brown and white sludge. Dozens of reports describe toxic bottles
strewn along highways and rural roads in states with the worst meth
problems.

The do-it-yourself method creates just enough meth for a few hits, allowing
users to make their own doses instead of buying mass-produced drugs from a
dealer.

"It simplified the process so much that everybody's making their own dope,"
said Kevin Williams, sheriff of Marion County, Ala., about 80 miles west of
Birmingham. "It can be your next-door neighbor doing it. It can be one of
your family members living downstairs in the basement."

A typical meth lab would normally take days to generate a full-size batch o=
f
meth, which would require a heat source and dozens, maybe hundreds, of boxe=
s
of cold pills.

But because the new method uses far less pseudoephedrine, small-time users
are able to make the drug in spite of a federal law that bars customers fro=
m
buying more than 9 grams =97 roughly 300 pills =97 a month.

The federal government and dozens of states adopted restrictions on
pseudoephedrine in 2005, and the number of lab busts fell dramatically.

The total number of clandestine meth lab incidents reported to the Drug
Enforcement Administration fell from almost 17,400 in 2003 to just 7,347 in
2006.

But the number of busts has begun to climb again, and some authorities blam=
e
the shake-and-bake method for renewing meth activity.

The AP review of 14 states found:

=95 At least 10 states reported increases in meth lab seizures or meth-rela=
ted
arrests from 2007 to 2008.

=95 The Mississippi State Crime Lab participated in 457 meth incidents thro=
ugh
May 31, up from 122 for the same period a year ago =97 a nearly 275 percent
increase.

=95 Several states, such as Oklahoma and Tennessee, are on pace this year t=
o
double the number of labs busted in 2008. The director of Tennessee's meth
task force said the pace of lab busts in his state is projected to be about
1,300 for 2009, compared with 815 for all of 2008.

Some states lack a central database to monitor cold medicine sales, so meth
cooks circumvent state laws by pill shopping in multiple cities and states =
=97
a practice known as "smurfing" that allows them to stay under restrictions
placed on sales.

Traci Fruit, a special agent with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said =
law
enforcement officials are becoming increasingly frustrated because there's
no way to tell who is buying what "unless we go from store to store
ourselves and pull up the records."

Historically, rural states like Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas have been
hotbeds for meth use because an important ingredient in the traditional
method, anhydrous ammonia, was easily available from tanks on farms where
it's used as a fertilizer. But the new formula does not need anhydrous
ammonia and instead uses ammonium nitrate, a compound easily found in
instant cold packs that can be purchased at any drug store.

Data from the Justice Department and the DEA data suggest the method could
only be in its early stages, and "shake-and-bake" labs have recently been
discovered as far north as Indiana and as far east as West Virginia.

States surveyed by the AP also included: Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama,
Georgia, New Mexico, Arizona and California.

While many law enforcement agencies are just learning how to spot the new
labs, other states are rushing to close loopholes in laws limiting the sale
of meth ingredients.

Mississippi Sen. Sid Albritton, said that state's law =97 modeled after
Oklahoma's =97 forces buyers to show identification and makes stores keep a
log of cold medicine sales. But the problem in Mississippi is lack of
technology to instantly log purchases in a central database.

"You have to understand going in that drugs are an evolutionary process,"
said Albritton, a former police detective and narcotics officer. "The day
after we pass a law, they are going to look for ways to circumvent that."

Hi pals.
I don't think Juju has played jungle in public since the Burial of Phuturo a
couple years ago.

Some combination of us has kept jungle going on Tuesday nights at the same
location for more than 10 years now.  Many of you might remember coming out
in the heady days of dotcom when Noel and Juju and I enjoyed you enjoying
yourself every week, including Xmas nights, 9-11, and every Mardi Gras since
we started.

Well, tonight it's on.  Juju will be playing a 3 hour set of strictly old
vinyl and dubplates, and we are looking forward to a highly-spirited night
of silly business.

Facebook event URL:
http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=129695597912&ref=mf
Flyer URL:  http://2.media.tumblr.com/DPWN7sm0Kqzwns1wYumolWdlo1_500.jpg

I will be on the mic.  Reyka is playing from 10-11.

10p-2a
21+
$5
424 Haight btwn Webster and Fillmore
$5 Svedka drinks all night long

If you haven't been out to a dnb thing in awhile, if I haven't seen you in
awhile, if you can still do stuff during the week, it would be a pleasure to
see my old friends from SFR.  =D

Peace!
Maxibeaucoup

We're trying to further reinforce a good size system.

Powered cabinets would be ideal.

I've tried:

* JK Sound
* fSound
* Know Audio
* lots of individuals

Any other ideas?

Subject: [sfraves] For all you Burners, a poem.

For those of ya not on my FB or private lists, thought ya burners might enjoy (Yes I know I have too much time on my hands)

Tis the week before Burning Man, and all through the Bay
Freaks are prepping and packing and awaiting the day.
Water, sun block, and goggles are purchased with care
In the hopes that sun and sand will not find them unprepared.

Costco and Wallmart are this week packed with weirdos
Their carts full to the brim with Redbull, trailmix, and Cheetos.
On Facebook, on Tribe, and on Craigslist there is a great clatter
For last minute tickets, playa bikes, and other such matters.

And on camp stores 'round the city the horde finally descends
To purchase tents, headlamps, and other needed odds and ends.
While emails do fly through cyber space with great speed
Looking for late breaking rides and camps with room and some need.

But shopping for goods, and looking for rides, camps, bikes, and tickets
Aren't the only Burner actions to prepare for the junket.
All over the Bay, from the North to the East, from City to San Jo
Artists, Performers, and Volunteers are getting ready to go.

DJ's and musicians make final tweaks and song selections
So that when playing the playa can give ass shaking perfection.
And the sound camp collectives are very busy with packing
All the structures, lighting, and sound gear, nothing is lacking.

While visual artists of all stripes, their time fast diminishing
In backyards and warehouses their projects are finishing.
And for those freaks for whom fashion is what lights their fire,
There are hours spent with hot glue guns, fun fur, and EL wire.

The fire spinners are busy checking poi, staffs, and fuel
To ensure inspiring routines nothing short of hella cool.
And fire art collectives check tanks, valves, and equipment
To prep bursts of fire for their fellow freak's contentment.

Art car camps are bustling with the final details of transport
Of fantastic carriages, dream ships--party buses of all sort.
They are busy loading trucks and strapping vehicles to flatbeds
So they'll be ready on playa to give slow night rides to heads.

And the service camps are buying, prepping, and packing
Saunas, booze bars, massage tables, and many more useful things.
And dream of friendly gifts freely given and of service to strangers
To help create a great playa vibe full of care and not danger.

But there's more to the week before Burning Man than just this
For Burners are also hurriedly stocking up on their bliss.
For what is camp gear and art with no food for the head,
It is nice to be sure, but for total enjoyment the mind must be fed.

So all over the city are the chimes of texts sent to dealers
As procrastinating Burners put out last minute feelers.
There are many fun chemicals that they hope to score,
A veritable alphabet soup to open up the mind's door.

With frantic determination they pursue such party favors
As E, LSD, 2CB, N2O, GHB, and fun in other flavors.
I need mushrooms, I need pot, I need foxy, I need K,
Freaks are requesting of their connects right up to the last day.

And so as first the time for set up, and then the opening draws near,
Burners, Freaks, and Artists look with excitement to the time they hold dear.
With joy in their hearts, and banks and pockets empty of cash,
They are almost all ready for exodus to the yearly freak bash.

And we poor and sundry freaks who will be this year left behind,
Have watched all the preparations with longing hearts and minds.
And to the caravans of Burners as they drive  out of our sights,
We'll shout "Have a great burn-- enjoy all the fire and lights".

Penny Pattison, 2009

Subject: [sfraves] For all you Burners, a poem.

For those of ya not on my FB or private lists, thought ya burners might enjoy (Yes I know I have too much time on my hands)

Tis the week before Burning Man, and all through the Bay
Freaks are prepping and packing and awaiting the day.
Water, sun block, and goggles are purchased with care
In the hopes that sun and sand will not find them unprepared.

Costco and Wallmart are this week packed with weirdos
Their carts full to the brim with Redbull, trailmix, and Cheetos.
On Facebook, on Tribe, and on Craigslist there is a great clatter
For last minute tickets, playa bikes, and other such matters.

And on camp stores 'round the city the horde finally descends
To purchase tents, headlamps, and other needed odds and ends.
While emails do fly through cyber space with great speed
Looking for late breaking rides and camps with room and some need.

But shopping for goods, and looking for rides, camps, bikes, and tickets
Aren't the only Burner actions to prepare for the junket.
All over the Bay, from the North to the East, from City to San Jo
Artists, Performers, and Volunteers are getting ready to go.

DJ's and musicians make final tweaks and song selections
So that when playing the playa can give ass shaking perfection.
And the sound camp collectives are very busy with packing
All the structures, lighting, and sound gear, nothing is lacking.

While visual artists of all stripes, their time fast diminishing
In backyards and warehouses their projects are finishing.
And for those freaks for whom fashion is what lights their fire,
There are hours spent with hot glue guns, fun fur, and EL wire.

The fire spinners are busy checking poi, staffs, and fuel
To ensure inspiring routines nothing short of hella cool.
And fire art collectives check tanks, valves, and equipment
To prep bursts of fire for their fellow freak's contentment.

Art car camps are bustling with the final details of transport
Of fantastic carriages, dream ships--party buses of all sort.
They are busy loading trucks and strapping vehicles to flatbeds
So they'll be ready on playa to give slow night rides to heads.

And the service camps are buying, prepping, and packing
Saunas, booze bars, massage tables, and many more useful things.
And dream of friendly gifts freely given and of service to strangers
To help create a great playa vibe full of care and not danger.

But there's more to the week before Burning Man than just this
For Burners are also hurriedly stocking up on their bliss.
For what is camp gear and art with no food for the head,
It is nice to be sure, but for total enjoyment the mind must be fed.

So all over the city are the chimes of texts sent to dealers
As procrastinating Burners put out last minute feelers.
There are many fun chemicals that they hope to score,
A veritable alphabet soup to open up the mind's door.

With frantic determination they pursue such party favors
As E, LSD, 2CB, N2O, GHB, and fun in other flavors.
I need mushrooms, I need pot, I need foxy, I need K,
Freaks are requesting of their connects right up to the last day.

And so as first the time for set up, and then the opening draws near,
Burners, Freaks, and Artists look with excitement to the time they hold dear.
With joy in their hearts, and banks and pockets empty of cash,
They are almost all ready for exodus to the yearly freak bash.

And we poor and sundry freaks who will be this year left behind,
Have watched all the preparations with longing hearts and minds.
And to the caravans of Burners as they drive  out of our sights,
We'll shout "Have a great burn-- enjoy all the fire and lights".

Penny Pattison, 2009

deep house roots in a unique way that dancefloors can't resist.

AGN=C8S

Agn=E8s is known for his usual deep, dubbed-out minimal techno
productions, but frequently explores more house-influenced rhythms and
textures as well. Agn=E8s runs the Geneva-based label Sthlmaudio
Recordings. Launched in 2003, Sthlmaudio has released tracks by Agn=E8s,
Ripperton, Alessandro Crimi, Chaton, Cabanne, Baaz, Azuni, Skat, and
Luka & Lazo to name a few. In 2007 he released his debut album
=93Dumbles Debuts=94 on Resopal Schallware and has well received EPs on
labels like Minibar, Plak Records, Einmaleins Musik, Perspectiv
Records, Leena and LoMidhigh. Releases under his aliases Ray Valioso
and Cavalier on Deep Vibes, Drumpoet Community and Real Soon only
increased his reputation.  With live and DJ sets, played around the
globe, the clever Swiss producer is taking your dancing requests more
than seriously.  With his now established very personal sound
definition and always grooving, evolving modern beat structures you
can expect a mind-blowing experience.

Below is the official Agn=E8s biography as of mid 2009:

Agn=E8s always dreamed about being a musician. A Jazz drummer for
example, being scheduled in White Horse for two weeks and the next two
in Mourmansk or elsewhere where people are just real. But he's not.
He's just a farmer out of nowhere able to handle computers. The
redneck understood bits and bytes well beyond everybody's believes and
bets... So what do you want to expect from that kind of guy? Honesty,
straight forward thinking and sympathy. If this is what you want, ask
for him, if you need the usual hypocrisy and fake ass shit, pass your
way. There's plenty of those doing that far better then him.

JAN KRUEGER

It's 1995 in D=FCsseldorf - Jan's hometown - and he's consumed by the
Music of Labels like M-Plant, Relief, Sound Signature, Planet E and
Phono. Jan owes his first steps to present his record selection (to
those other than his lovely dog and cat) to a very good friend who
holds a residency at one of the best underground clubs for electronic
music, an old wine cellar located in Wuppertal, near D=FCsseldorf. Here
he had the pleasure to play alongside artists who had inspired him
since the early nineties. In short - this is the precise starting
point of a never ending story fuelled by love for the music.

In 1996, Jan started to work for a record store and focused on hosting
his own parties starring international guests like Daniel Bell,
Matthew Herbert, Ata and Steve Bug. Around the same time, he met the
young and promising producer Daze Maxim. Both clicked right away and
found out that they have a quite similar interest in electronic music.
Both decided to start some excursions in Maxim's backroom studio to
produce deep and minimal house tracks, which were finally released on
Matthias Tanzmann's Moon Harbour Recordings in 2001.

Three years later, Jan determined after sleepless nights to move away
from D=FCsseldorf and all his friends in order to start a new chapter in
Hamburg. Because of his long friendship to the staff of Germany's
leading distribution company Word and Sound, it was a logical step to
take on a position as sales manager there. As a consequence of all
this, it wasn't long before he proposed to Daze that they set up a
platform for him and friends to release music. Hello?Repeat was born.

As a DJ, Jan is adept in the late night hours, playing his highly
individual and addictive mixture of deep house, minimal, and techno
with rough edges, always focused on the dance floor. Today Jan lives
in Berlin and holds a residency at Panoramabar and Watergate and plays
considerably abroad to represent the high quality sound of
Hello?Repeat.

KENNETH SCOTT

Kenneth Scott makes small-scale techno with large sonic concerns.
Producing music as Eutactic with Auralism label head Jason Short, as
Moniker with Emilio "EO" Orlandi, and under his own name for friend
Alland Byallo's Nightlight Music, Scott takes cues from early Warp
records, Matthew Dear's acid experimentation as Audion, and
minimal-minded composers like Philip Glass and Arvo Part. The results
eye the "minimal" label with suspicion, combining techy snares,
reptilian synths, and subtle layers of melody into something melodic,
funky, and emotional -- uncategorizable and catchy as hell, just how
Scott likes it.  "I think that trance really ruined melodies and
arpeggios for everyone," he says, "and only now are people a bit more
open to it." Scott was raised in a small, rural Iowa town, where he
nursed an obsession with dance music while exploring its tiny scene.
He learned a bit of every instrument he could get his hands on, while
DJing his first house parties with his father's old turntable, a
portable CD player, and a Radio Shack mixer. Scott's been honing his
craft in the years since, running San Francisco's successful Binary
party, DJing alongside Pan Pot, Lee Curtiss, and Argenis Brito, and
creating music with collaborators Jason Short, Alland Byallo, and
Emilio Orlandi. Now he's ready to open the floodgates. "I want to
create dance-floor friendly, funky, jacking, sonically dexterous,
soulful music," he says. "I want to make a crowd tear up, as well as
pump their fists."
