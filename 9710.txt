I don't know. I just know I have to goto bed now...

Jeff's tip of the day though, nStuff..
Don't try to make your mixing sound great. Just mix it.. Cue it as best as
possible, But get it in on time no matter what.. Eventually you will adapt
yourself to have the dammed beats matched before your cue is up. Just don't
mis your cue nStuff.

Helps the world go around.

=]:. ...
Peace.
Jeff

Hi- I'm almost afraid to ask - did anyone go and see Peshay last night (Mon)
at VSF? I'd been looking forward to this all month! But Sunday at the fair
and Spundae was exhausting and after working on Mon I couldn't drag myself or
put the $$ together.
So if anyone else went I'd love to live vicariously (sp?) through your
post..??..??
Thanks!!!

Providing you're running on W95, have you tried tweaking with your registry?
If you want, I can give you somethingto try.  It increased my internet
response by at least 30%.

hmm..  the audio came out in such a bad quality (maybe 8 bitz max) and the
video is choppy..  guess you need a digital line to enjoy this or any
online video/music.

i truely wish the chipmakers would engineer some rather ground breaking
technology, this is more pain than pleasure nowadays.

So who's going to be going to this new weekly in the east bay on

On the Chris Rock Show a few nights ago that he had "Grand Master 
Flash"(trash) on as his Dj.  Agh!  It was hilarious.  If I am correct he 
spun at Planet Rock, and brought out all the little 'G's from the walls 
to say 'Hey...Ho!'  NEWAYS, thought it was funny and wanted to share.

NO WAY MAN!!!

we drove... and drove... and drove... and what seemed like 8 hours later-
we finally arrived!


great place, it was beautiful!  but personally, as a water sign and all-
i think that it should be somewhere closer to the coast... (or... ah...
closer to s.f.?)

maybe somewhere that really <bold>does</bold> have redwoods! (4x4...100
acres of redwoods?... my ass! all i saw were pine trees!) the place was
incredible none the less!


i think it would be nice to have it within 2hrs of the bay area?

even the most pathetic 100Mhz pentium (well, just about any pentium is
pathetic by design) can easily play back audio/video w/ relatively good
quality. the problem is that we have the technology but that the 
telecommunications infrastructure is not there -- we could easily all
have T1's going into our houses for like $25.00/month if it weren't for
the greed and stupidity of local telephone companies. we could easily
have satellite or cell-net infrastructure, or even cable-internet...
but every I-provider  is too busy milkiing every last dollar out of the
suckers who need these advanced technologies right now, keeping the
prices high enough that "everybody else" can't afford to get into the
game. at the same time, getting everybody else into the game is exactly
what is needed to lower prices. it's a chicken and egg problem,  while
the fox is guarding the henhouse, and right now, turkeys rule the
roost. :-)

don't worry, though, remember when cell-phones could only be afforded
by the yacht/jet-set? fast personal internet access will be there too
-- in about 5-10 years.

the other side of the problem is the software -- there is absolutely no
reason why the video/audio needs to be "realtime." I really couldn't
give a fuck if the bits streaming off some server are displaying 
themselves on my screen in synchrony. I'd be just as happy to download
a datafile before I go to sleep, and play it the next morning when I 
wake up, caching the data on my local disk drives as it streams in
overnight.

But noooooo, that's just too complicated. 

The only reason for needing "real" video/audio is if you're placing 
bets on sports events (or other stupid wastes of time), or doing
teleconferencing.

People need to snap out of that TV mindset that "live" is somehow
better than "memorex". "As it happens" need be nothing more than the
act of plugging in a Jaz drive ... that's all that is happening 
"back at the station" anyways...

Yes, you can try to make advances in compression, but those will 
always provide degraded media on playback. I don't expect huge 
advances to happen over the kinds of media compression we have
currently. The advances have to happen in our internet connectivity.
28-56Kbaud data streams over analog phone lines is just plain
ass-backwards right now, and that's going to have to change before
things get better.

Hello Beautiful, diverse sfravers,
   As you all know, Wednesday just so happens to be the day where City 
Espresso in Santa Clara (408)248-4500) has dj's spin from 8:00pm-10:00, 
while I make your coffee drinks :( It's not that I don't like to do 
that, it's just a lot more fun being on the other side of the counter.  
However, business has been going down the drain on Wed. nights, for what 
reason, I don't know.  We at City E do this to let people of all ages 
come out, drink coffee and socialize.  The use of illegal substances at 
a coffee shop, well, it is pretty stupid and it has been happenning...so 
Please don't bring anything of that genre, just bring your smiles, your 
comuter mug, and your hearts and have a great time.  If anyone in our 
employ, wether working or not sees someone selling, using, throwing, 
jumping on, waving, looking at, drugs etc, etc,  This event will no 
longer happen. So please help spread the word to not do that and also 
please be respectful of the property, use the garbage cans please. We'll 
see you all tonight and I promise to be in a better mood  :P

So everyone come out and have a good time otay?

Yor Friend,
Danny

P.S.
don't forget your...

Minimum on Wed due to "Live entertainment"  that might spruce up
business. Cause after all I want to keep my Boyz in Business. See you
all out there tonight if I go??

That's a good idea..... even if you don't get a drink, maybe just throw a
couple bucks in..... I'd do that.....  we're such cool people that it's
worth anything to hang with eachother. :)

ok, so me and some friends decided to go check out this party at a 
petaluma bowling alley where some dj's were spinning.  my motivation 
was to hear rinse, which was accomplished.

rinse spun a helluva set, i danced my ass off. but check it: security 
were dicks.

1)we first arrived, when to go do something, came back to the car to
get our smokes and whatever, security rolls up and says "just so you
know, you can't hang out at your car...." we're like "we just got
here, we're going IN". ok, sorry mr. officer, we'll get a move on.  i 
handled that very politely and wouldn't have even broughten it up 
again ever but then...

2)i was playing pool and i got caught drinking a sip of beer that
wasn't mine.  i look up, there's mr. officer again asking for my id.
i tel him it's in the car (being underage sucks) so he's all "i saw
you take a drink of that.  you don't have any id, you don't have a
wristband, now you have to LEAVE".  luckily my friend who had
boughten the beer distracted the focus from me, i was able to stay.
thank god too cuz rinse hadn't even come on yet.  ok, i realize that
was my bad, i wasn't sly, i deserved atleast a warning.  but...

3)after dancing with some fellow jungle lovers down near the alleys,
i decided to exchange digits with them.  so we walk up to the lotto
machine thingy cuz there was a pen and some paper.  i proceeded to
tear off some paper, write my # on it, and gave it to my new found
friends.  as i stuffed the folded paper in my pocket, security was
right there again, asking me just what exactly i had rolled up and
put in my pocket.  i said "a phone number".  they say "then do you
mind if we take a look?"  i flaunt the scribbled wrinkled paper in
their face and say "SEE?" gawd, whatdoilooklike?  a criminal(raver)?
so they eyeballed me the rest of the night, waiting for me to 'slip
up' or something...whatever.
just wanted to voice my frustration.
-doreen. "opressed"  :) j/k

This monthly dance party has been around for five years, and draws a
cool crowd who dig the "old new wave"...

WHAT:  NEW WAVE CITY - Salute Night to the Cure
        Dancing to New Wave music of the late 70^Rs and early 80^Rs
        DJ^Rs Shindog and Skip

WHEN: Saturday, October 4, 9pm-3am

WHERE: King Street Garage, 174 King, San Francisco

        cover charge: $5 til 10pm, $8 after, 21 and over
        Information line: 415/675-LOVE
        Web site:  http://www.newwavecity.com
        (Enter to win free admission on our website!)


SALUTE TO THE CURE - One of the most popular acts of the New Wave City
crowd is the Cure, who get salute treatment at this event with extra
doses of their music throughout the night, including a full half hour of
classic Cure at midnight.  As a special tease for giveaways for the next
event (see below), we will have a box set of the new Cure collection
Galore for a lucky New Waver.  The influence of the Cure and its leader
Robert Smith has been significant ever since their beginnings in the
late seventies, in the textures of their music, their thoughtful, often
gloomy lyrics, and the visual appeal of big, teased jet black hair. 
We^Rll have it all at New Wave City for this night... what could be
better?

word.  ya know that wheels of steel song?  ya know the part where he
"samples" the line from rapture that goes "flash is fast... flash is
fast..."  he did that by syncing that record with the loop before it,
then lifting up the needle and dropping it down at the beginning of
the vocal line, four times.  the whole song was done live on decks in
the studio -  or at least that's what i heard...

    Hey all four hundred of your persons nStuff..


		 My friend James, and fellow friendly
ravEr with an edge, needs a place to live. He is only
19 years old, but I think he is a very stronge minded
person. He only needs to be told once, and he makes
his own opinions of others.. He can only afford like
$350 a month right now. He would much rather move
in with some fellow ravEs, rather than..In a box?

		 Let me know via MSG private e-mail
if you can accomidate. And I will give you further
unmentioned details.

Well, after much trial and tribulation(whew!).... I finally found an ISP
with an access number for SLT so..... I'm back online and looking forward
to all y'alls ranting, raving, sharing, jokes, cool stuff et all.  Oh, I
forgot to introduce myself... My name is Melissa Wong, I was previously on
SFRaves until I moved to the mountains to snowboard last winter.  Hi
everyone!  Glad to be back!!!!!

A brief synopsis of what I've been doin':
Dental assisting, wolf wrangling (really! I have 3 timber wolves now),
living wit' my lil sis in a funky a-frame, snowboardin' in the
winter,trying to wakeboard in the summer, getting use to the shitty
economy up here, dreaming of more ski/board/parties this winter(at my
house maybe?), digging nature and missing alot of people.

What's up everyone?  Fill me in and give me a call or e-mail

Thanks, for the info. I'll check out the URL.I agree with your opinion
regarding criminalization of GHB. As far as other drugs go, you probably
already know this, but others may not, in Holland where marijuana is
legal, their young people smoke it a lot less than young people in
Britain or the U.S., where it's illegal.
	Also, in Switzerland they sell heroin at pharmaceutical prices to
addicts. This results in lower crime rates because they don't become
desparate. It also results in them being healthier because they don't
get AIDS from sharing needles, which means that the tax payer doesn't
have to pay for their medical expenses. One would think that at least
this part of the solution would appeal to Republicans. 
	Of course, just because decriminalization works in those countries
doesn't mean that it will work here, but at least we should be open to
discussions about it. So much drug hysteria...
	On another topic, I went to Ultra on Monday. After being unemployed for
a month I started a new job on Wednesday, so I figured Monday night
would be my last chance to go out. So first, I went to Corazon at the
Elbo Room, where they were playing very good latin music. There was only
about 15 people upstairs though, so since I like big crowds, I went to
VSF after that. I had never been to a club that played strictly drum n'
bass. I must say that it's not my favorite type of music, but since I
can't help moving I was out on the dance floor moving my feet, gyrating
my body, and flailing my arms.
As far as Peshay goes, like I said it's not my favorite type of music,
but the crowd seemed quite appreciative and excited about him.

gee i'm a little bored installing w95 on my fifth computer today. 
from floppies.  so i thought i'd throw a poser at youse guys.  i'm
kinda tired of going to raves, i've been going constantly all summer,
i thought i'd give it a rest this weekend so as not to burn out.  so
the question is, what to do?  what do you folx do for fun when you
aren't raving?  i've already seen a drag show or two, been to most of
the museums, watched the hippies in the park, and i'm sicker of bars
than i am of raves.  i know the city has way more to offer, i just
gotta find it.  i'm particularly looking for some sort of friday night
activity, the more unusual the better...

he wants to live with some fellow raves?  well tell him to look on the
list.  big top was last week, isn't like 6 or 7 raves going on this week?
what a pain though moving your stuff from ravE to ravE.

maybe you meant ravErs.  right.

tell your friend i have like 6 or 7 boxes in my secret scorpio hallway.
maybe he can piece them together for a mansion.

Thanks for the www.takedown.com URL.

Here's the audio sample I was looking for --
http://www.takedown.com/evidence/voicemail/th1.au

And here's the transcript of the call that Kevin Mitnick left of 
Shimomura's voicemail, taunting him...

sent december 27th at four thirty-three pm

      damn you.
      my technique is the best.
      my boss is the best.
      damn you.  i know rdist technique,
      i know sendmail technique,
      and my style is much better.
      damn you don't you know who i am?
      me,

        rustling noises

      and my friends, we'll kill you.

        second voice

      hey boss, your kung fu's really good.

        first voice

      that's right,
      my style is the best.


Still waiting for someone to tell me:

(1) which movie this "my style is the best" comes from.

(2) which jungle song has "my style is the best" (from the movie, not
from mitnick) in it.

I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist...." hmmmmm. it's a

Hello,

A friend of mine at the graduate school of Journalism at UC Berkeley is
writing an article about the cancellation of Cyberfest and the relationship
between members of the scene (promoters and participants) and the
"authorities" in the Bay Area.  If you feel inspired, it would help her
greatly to hear your thoughts on the following questions:

*How do you think the authorities/law enforcement agencies percieve the
rave/electronic music scene?

*How is the mainstreaming of electronic music changing the kind of people 
attending raves?

*What percentage of raves in the Bay Area would you estimate get shut down,
and for what reasons (both as perceived by participants and law enforcement
officials- is there a discrepancy?) ?

Please respond to platonik@rosebud.berkeley.edu

Thanks!

Breaktrance ? Sounds good to me !

1. Who spins this in the S.F./S.Cruz/Monterey area ?

2. What artists make this music ?

What I do for non-raving fun -

1. Couch potato stuff
 - Read ( Terry Pratchett fantasy humor, popular science, misc )  
 - Watch cable TV ( PBS, Mystery Science Theater 3000, various SF stuff,
   Mr. Bean )
 - Internet ( Web surfing for info and smut. Reading and answering
   email. )
 - Design things with paper, pencil, and calculator that I sometimes 
   don't quite get around to actually building, like subwoofer cabinets.
 - Music - I'd like to listen to more , but I've been hindered recently 
   by moving residences. I just got a used CD ROM last night that has
   a fun little sample mixing program on it - much fun!

2. Really active stuff
 - Gee - raving is pretty much it! I'm not a sportsperson , not even
   hiking.

3. Not so active stuff
 - Doing stuff with my wife ( movies, restaurants, etc. )

Well, *blush*, I don't know which jungle song uses the sample, but it is 
used in a track on Bill Laswell's, "Altered Beats", a great 
turntablism showcase that came out about a year and a half ago.

You don't believe in Jesus?

 Jesus was a real flesh & blood human being.. I think. I don't know for
sure. He seemed to have super natural powers. He might not be from this
planet. But he was real none the less.. Maybe it's the whole god thing your
referring to..  =]:...  
 I don't know if God is real or not. I will have to wait and see. And if he
is real, and he don't let me hang out in Heaven because I didn't beleive in
him. Then he is not the kind of person I want to hang out with anyways. I
would rather take my chances with Satan if God is that arrogent..

 So there..
And I love everyone. Cause we all share the same energy. And it's kinna
more special than we all think. I think. I don't know though. Because I
have yet to see the light...

You know?
Hmm...
Jeff

I was at a party a few months back (party in your pants) that was really
good.. and there was a DJ from Santa Cruz named TOM who spun some really
good stuff that I remember sounding similarly to what you've described.
... kinda fast, break beaty, trancy......   I think a lot of people spin
this kinda stuff... harder housy-trance with breaks. Some poeple refer to
different genres differently..... so it's difficult to track sometimes...


Hope that helps???

I do believe "Bionic Booger Breaks" has the same sample.

Mebbe the dj mixed it into the jungle track?

On November 15th, Silver Pearl Records is throwing a party in Oakland. 
It looks to be a really great evening...good DJ's, live acts, visuals, 
and people. They are looking for some people to promote in a couple of 
different places around the bay area. If you are interested, you can 
e-mail me or you can call the label directly...but, I can't remember the 
phone number, so e-mail me, and I'll send you the number later.

Peace,
ES

Go see a movie (liked Contact, if it's still playing, plus it kills extra
time as it is a long flick, only got chessy towards the end, but that's
more than I can say for most movies out there).

Go meet some non ravers... some of them are okay.

Start a religion.

Figure out your financial situation.

Do your laundry.

Clean your room.

Buy some groovy space age bachelor pad furniture.

Write really long responses to old Email on SFRaves.

Get in an arguement with your significant other.

Make up with your SO.

Get an SO.

Masturbate several times in rapid succession until you're in pain.

Sleep.

Watch Gomer Pyle.

Work overtime.

Take a trip on public transportation, even if you do have a car.

Walk.

Bike.

Hike.

Take a psychedelic by yourself.

Read a book.

Learn to sew.

Learn to spin.

Start the great american novel.

Quit smoking.

Invite a friend over for a three course meal, just for being them.

Clean up the house.

Start a garden.

Visit or call a sick friend or relative.

Go to a used record/cd store and by some stuff you've never really 
listened to before (jazz, classical, bluegrass, swing).

Get drunk.

Write poetry.

Get drunk AND write poetry (it worked for Bukowski, it worked for
Morrison).

Start a journal.

Draw.

Paint.

Help throw a party.

Go garage saling (who knows... there might be one of those $5 303's out
there still).

Write music.

Record your ideas onto a tape, and put it somewhere you won't look for a
while.  Ten years from now you'll be glad you did.

Work overtime.

Check other job listings.

Open up your old high school/college textbooks and see how much higher
math you remember.

Pass by a local community center and see what's up on the bulletin boards.

Play pool.

Go to a rally or protest.

Go swimming (will be cold soon).

Work on your car/motorcycle.

Get a haircut.

Make a collage to hang on your wall.

Do something with all those flyers you have.

Wash your car.

Go for a walk on the beach by yourself in a sportcoat with a T shirt under
it, like Crocket and Tubbs used to on those 2 hour special episodes of
Miami Vice.

Go purchase a sound system (not recommended... this will continue to eat
money).

Miniature golfing.

Bowling.

Batting cage (visualize the boss's head young Luke)

Learn C in 24 hours (yeah right)

Go to Fry's and buy something flaky... try to get it to work... now try to
return it.

Play chicken with your bong.

Look through the classifieds.

Try and find some long lost friends from high school or earlier via the
internet.

Trace your genealogy.

Visit www.word.com/gigo this is one of the greatest wastes of time I have
ever seen.  www.leisuretown.com is pretty up there too.

Do upgrades on your house.

Throw a house party.

Look for some old music, and play it.  Boy, did I ever have fun when I
found Too Fast for Love by Motley Crue in my garage last weekend... I
remembered that stuff being so much faster.  Now, I must find Twisted
Sister's Stay Hungry on vinyl... if only for the sample... what do you
want to do with your life... I want to rock.

Listen to Beatles records backwards, or out of one speaker.  Favorite
finds include "Same as it will ever be, Lucifer..." from SgtPepper's (Brit
import only)... some French Children's song in the background of
"paperback writer"... and the plethora of good stuff in Revolution 9.

Go to Guitar Center, buy a four track, record a really trippy answering
machine message, then return it.

Try to invent a new food.

Pull a condom over your showerhead, hold it on, and slowly turn the water
on.  This just looked so cool, I had to mention it.  Don't ask how we
happened upon this data...

Sew up any ripped clothes you might have.

Weed out any socks with holes, or any underwear you wouldn't want to be
caught in.

Go to a nice restaurant and try somthing new.

Go to a massive or a smaller party, whatever you don't usually do.

Take a guitar to the desert and play crap and sing really loud.

Make up with an old rival.

Be healthy for a day, avoid meat, eat smart just to see if you feel
different.

Dedicate a day to sensory deprivation.  Walk around the house blindfolded
and see how well you do.  Bonus points for using sounds to echo locate
upcoming walls.  Fun activities include pouring water, and urinating while
standing up.  Take a bath in lukewarm water with headphones on (walkman
running on batteries only please) and a blindfold... for added fun drink
some really strong coffee first.  Or combine with the do psychedlics by
yourself theme.

See, I was a latch key kid, and I would get really bored.  After a while, 
I realized I didn't have to be bored.  I now see life through a new pair
of eyes... you can fuck with everything.

Peace,
AndyW

the combination of break beat and trance seems to be one of the new genres
popping up.  Kind of how this so called speed garage thing has become more
popular.  I think it's just people trying to deny the pull of strait up
JUNGLE!! (that remark is tounge and cheek so be nice) anyways, working here
at the local trance and jungle hub, I think I can leed you towards some
breaktrance...

Psy-Harmonics from Australia were just here and played a party at 115 minna,
I didn't go because after almost puking from breathing in other peoples
sweat at the Richie Hawtin party a couple of weeks ago I couldn't deal, but
they played a lot of their own new music, which Adam here @ Hunab Ku says is
'kind of psychedelic eclectic anything goes, mixing up a variety of
psychedelic styles i.e breakbeat, jungle, and polyrythmic trance'. this
seems to be the new direction many trance labels are going for.

If your looking for vinyl, check out anything on 21-3, and some on Psy
Harmonics, Blue Room and even TIP the Goa originators!

On CD there's a new one called Galaxy Tribe on Magik Eye.  It's more like
atmosheric-psychedelic D&B. (they have them at HouseWares)

Also I've been hearing Cieba's tracks in progress coming out of the studio,
that's some serious breaktrance! that will be released on the next Language
of Light CD due out B4 winter solstice.

I just heard that Space Station Russ (HK, Silver Palm Leaf, & Cieba
collaborating) is going to start a psychedelic eclectic monthly called
Wierd, you'll have to listen to trance but a lot of it will be break style!

hope it helps!

Since I know there are a lot of techies on this list, I thought I'd let you
know about an employment opportunity with a start-up company my friend works
at in SOMA.

But I won't spam the list anymore than this. If you know Oracle and are
familiar with Q&A jobs, email me privately and I'll forward you the info.

i guess breaktrance is one of the new labels.. dunno how long people have
been calling it that, but they been spinning it in frisco way back in 92
,kinda a groundbreaking time period.. but in essence.. the best sets are
always heard live and never heard memorex..  that means most of the djs who
spin the tru style seldom ever puts it on recording and saves it for the
dancefloor to keep us off our asses.

For the record, and to further support Tall Paul's insightful post...someone in a
white car did a hit-and-run to my automotive pride and joy during Abyss.  Their cowardice
disgusts me...I will be hunting them down as I am sure they damaged their own car
too.  (Whew, I feel better!)  Now back to your regularly scheduled posts...

OOoo, if this isn't flame bait I dunno what is.

Miccaela jumps on the bandwagon:

"Kraftwerk SUCKS!!!  Yeah!"

Just kidding folx.  Jeez.  Stop brandishing those glowstix!

But I like Grandmaster Flash.  Not necessarily because of the music he plays 
(although I was one of those "little G's" @ Planet Rock I guess--sported a 
beanie that night and I danced to his set) but because without him and a 
couple other legendary djs and artists this scene would be nonexistent.  We'd 
all be doing the tootsie roll (old skool!) or line-dancing or something.  Not 
that that's bad.

But everyone is entitled to their own opinion, yes?

On the Chris Rock Show a few nights ago that he had "Grand Master 
Flash"(trash) on as his Dj.  Agh!  It was hilarious.  If I am correct he 
spun at Planet Rock, and brought out all the little 'G's from the walls 
to say 'Hey...Ho!'  NEWAYS, thought it was funny and wanted to share.

Too bad you live in SF . . . I'm right there with you!

Things to do in _Sac_ besides rave:
1.  Poetry readings
2.  Clubs (much different than raving, I don't care what you say)
3.  Picnics
4.  Movies
5.  Live music (usually not techno but that's not at all a bad thing)
6.  Arrive unexpectedly at friend's houses and keep them up all night
7.  Read a book
8.  Study
9.  Crash parties
10.  Eat
11.  Learn to dance (ballroom, line dance, salsa, swing)
12.  Get another job
13.  Shop
14.  Work out
15.  Whole lot of other stuff I can't think of

So I know if there's that much to do _here_, the city's gotta be full of stuff 
to do.

gee i'm a little bored installing w95 on my fifth computer today. 
from floppies.  so i thought i'd throw a poser at youse guys.  i'm
kinda tired of going to raves, i've been going constantly all summer,
i thought i'd give it a rest this weekend so as not to burn out.  so
the question is, what to do?  what do you folx do for fun when you
aren't raving?  i've already seen a drag show or two, been to most of
the museums, watched the hippies in the park, and i'm sicker of bars
than i am of raves.  i know the city has way more to offer, i just
gotta find it.  i'm particularly looking for some sort of friday night
activity, the more unusual the better...

Maybe I'll actually make it to this one this time!  Knock on wood, cross your 
fingers, etc.

Thanks for letting me (and everyone else too) get a second chance to party

OKay peoples ... hope your day/week.life is going well

Not sure where to begin with this one but here it goes.

I am wondering what has happened to a few people that I wouldn't mind getting 
in contact with if I could.

The first is this way kool chicka named Cheyenne (spelling?)  I used to see
her all the time at par-tays and now she is no more.  The last time I saw her 
was at basics back in June.  I used to have her pager number but i can't find it
dammit. Oh well I know she was living in Concord but moved to half moon bay.
If any of you guyz( and galz) know how to get in touch with her or know what
happened to her I would greastly appreciate it.

The second person is more a group of people and it the crew from fresno.  The 
last time I saw any of them was Basics as well and I figgered i would run into
them all summer but to my dismay I have not.  I wish i could remember their 
names but I can't.  But if you have met any of them you would know who I am 
referring to. About 20 kick ass kids who go trek up here from fresno to go to
parties.

sooo if any of ya have some info that would be great

smilez,

herb

Hi kids!  I just wanted to ask for some opinions.  I just wanted to get you
Sf Ravers to do some thinking.  I thought that this might get all you that
are signed up but never post to add in your thoughts.  (you know who you are
:-)!!)  If you all could post your favorite music and your favorite DJ I
would totally love it!  I think it is so interesting to see the diversity in
people's opinions.  I have my own favorites but I always find it interesting
to hear others.  Just to get you all going I wiil post my favorites  :-)

I LOVE:  Joey Beltram, Danny the Wild Child, and Kid Bippy~*~

I also LOVE:  Micron, Deeks, and Maya 13  ( I also like Macadio although I
haven't heard him spin too many times!!!  I always miss his set some how.)

I am a big fan of Techno and JUNGLE!!!

Thanks to anyone that posts and I'll be listening for your DJ's!!  See you on
the scene!

SDDPW is looking for a few happy, helpy people who would like to do a good turn.

We are putting on a benefit for Maitri AIDS Hospice on Sunday, October 19,
1997, in San Francisco and need a few people to help promote the event.

Promoters should be very familiar with the bay area rave/club scene and
associated retail outlets where flyers are usually left/found.

No pay associated with this task, but....
1.  You'll be stacking up loads of karma
2.  Of course, you'll be on the guest list for the party
3.  If you're a good promoter, it can usually get you into any party,
especially when they know you're doing it for a benefit.
4.  It might actually lead to paying jobs for future SDDPW events.

So you know what you are getting into, Maitri is an AIDS hospice in San
Francisco, started by buddhist monks.  Well, they're moving to new digs as
part of a program to be one of the few bay area hospices that accept triple
diagnosis patients (these are people with HIV, addiction issues, and mental
illness).  The move is costing plenty, so we are doing our part to help
raise funds by throwing this benefit.

Because the party is coming up in less than three weeks, we need people
soon.  If interested, please e-mail back to this address, but put "My Tree
House" in the subject.  Or, you may call 415.864.7448 and leave a message
for Rob.

Thanks....

Rob

YAY!!  I'm a Happy Hardcore kid that absolutely loves Paulina Taylor.

The best songs I've heard that he's got are:
"Rainbow High in the Sky"
and
"Another song whose name I don't know, but goes somethig like this. . .
You pick me up,
And swept me away.
It was the first time in my life
that I'd ever felt this way.
I opened up my eyes
And all I could see
Was the starlight from above
And the moon
Shining down on meeeeeeeeee"

I get all tingly inside when I sing that one.  ;o)  Hehehehe

Jeff, you are fucking brilliant.

You know that is exactly what I believe?  I figure if there's a higher power, 
whether it be God, Buddha, Allah, or Josh Wink (hey, he could be God), if 
they're the type who will fuck me over because I don't believe in him/her/it 
and detest organized religion in general, whatever then, fuck him/her/it, for 
I have no respect for a god like that.  I don't tolerate _humans_ like that, a 
supreme being has no damn excuse IMHO.

Matter of fact, since I don't believe in god or religion in general, I don't 
believe in heaven, hell, the ten commandments, karma, or anything like that.  
I don't do what I consider bad or immoral things because I want to be a good 
person, not because I'm afraid of going to hell or bad karma or something.  
Doesn't that make me better than a person who does good things just because 
they believe if they don't they'll be punished for it later on?  Do you see 
what I'm saying?  I figure I should be a fuckin VIP in heaven for being nice 
for no reason.

But Jeff,  I just had to tell you that because what you said is something I 
believe very deeply and strongly, and I wanted to give you props.  Right on.

And if I offended anyone who is religious, sorry.  What you believe is not 
wrong (how the hell would I know), I just don't agree with it.

xoxo--Miccaela

You don't believe in Jesus?

 Jesus was a real flesh & blood human being.. I think. I don't know for
sure. He seemed to have super natural powers. He might not be from this
planet. But he was real none the less.. Maybe it's the whole god thing your
referring to..  =]:...  
 I don't know if God is real or not. I will have to wait and see. And if he
is real, and he don't let me hang out in Heaven because I didn't beleive in
him. Then he is not the kind of person I want to hang out with anyways. I
would rather take my chances with Satan if God is that arrogent..

 So there..
And I love everyone. Cause we all share the same energy. And it's kinna
more special than we all think. I think. I don't know though. Because I
have yet to see the light...

You know?
Hmm...
Jeff

Hola,
I'm from Boston,  MA.  My favorite dj is Venom (spins happy hardcore and
jungle),  close to this are Mystr-E,  Pharoah, and, at the moment
(recently acquired a dope tape),  R.A.W. from LA.  Venom is east coast, 
I don't think he's spun any parties out here.  Hopefully you will here
him soon though.  I also like some bigger names such as Dieselboy, 
Commander Tom,  Sasha and John Digweed,  etc.  If anyone knows the
number of a free Space Children party this weekend (just heard about it
today) I would be quite appreciative.
Night night,
Bret

I'm not a "raver kid", but hey I'll answer anyways....

Some of my favorite rave DJ's (no particular order, and probably not
all of the DJ's that I like, just the ones I can think of right now):

Garth
Jeno
Loren
Derrick Carter
Mark Farina (who threw down mightily at the last Sunset Boat Party)
Mark Grant (who's playing at Stompy this wknd!)
DJ Sneak (when he's not getting too trax-y)
Doc Martin
David Morales
Frankie Knuckles
Todd Terry
Seb Fontaine
Farley & Heller
Sister Bliss
Jon Pleased Wimmin
John Kelly (the UK guy, not US's John Kelley)
Tony De Vit
CJ Mackintosh

I also heard a mixtape of a Dallas TX DJ named "Funk W" that was really
good. (Anybody know where I can pick up a CD or Mixtape locally??)

I used to believe the same as you do, Miccaela.  I despised the religeons, 
especially those who would condem you for not believing in 'their' God.  At 
best I beleived I was agnostic.  I would ask my family questions like:
If God is all powerfull, he knows all the decesions we will make, or has 
made them for us.  If this is so, why are we 'tested' here on earth? and how 
can we be held responsible for our actions, such as murdering some one, 
raping etc, when it was "God's decision that we do these actions"?  Or how 
can a man command God to excommunicate some one?  I wouldn't think an all 
powerfull being wouldn't  like to be told what to do, and isn't He capable 
of making his own decisions about the fate of a 'soul'?
For bringing these questions up I was called blasphemous etc.  no one i 
could talk to would carry an 'intelligent' discussion about the subject of 
God without resorting to attacking my charactor or using the phrase (my 
favorite) "God works in mysterious ways....."

This summer i took a philosophy intro class at Sam Mateo CC.  it was really 
enlightening.  I wish i could take more.  it really let me explore the 
subject of God, religion, the way we should live (Ten Commandments) and 
metaphysical ideas about reality without all the perversions that religions 
add on to the idea of "God".

Now, I think the Bible is a good 'reference book' of tales and learning 
experiences - perhaps even a documantation of some historical events.  But 
that's it.  people take it too far.  My feeling is that if  God did write 
some of the scriptures (such as creation) he was trying to explain it in 
very simple terms.  Don't forget when this book was 'written', people had a 
hard time even understanding concepts such as air ('how can you be 
surrounded by something you can't even see?).  but that ends my defense to 
the Bible.
i do beleive in an energy (karma, whatever) that surrounds and flows within 
us.  You can call it God, so long as you don't assign It to a religion.  I 
prefer to think of it as a Force (yes like star wars, a little korny but it 
is the closest most recognizable idea to mine besides calling it a GOD).  i 
would love to discuss it more, but i am already writing too much.  let me 
know if you want to being up that topic.
anyway.  i better end this.  i would encourage you to take a phil. class (if 
you already have, i'd like to hear your thoughts on it).  it won't convert 
you to anything, but it will enlighten you to different opinions that have 
been developed over the past 3,000 years-a wealth of knowledge to say the 
least.  and, who knows, maybe you'll find some ideas you like and may even 
unlock some ideas you have lodged deep inside yourself.  self exploration is 
always good, what's a better thing to learn about than yourself?

Jeff, you are fucking brilliant.

You know that is exactly what I believe?  I figure if there's a higher 
power,
whether it be God, Buddha, Allah, or Josh Wink (hey, he could be God), if
they're the type who will fuck me over because I don't believe in him/her/it 

and detest organized religion in general, whatever then, fuck him/her/it, 
for
I have no respect for a god like that.  I don't tolerate _humans_ like that,
a
supreme being has no damn excuse IMHO.

Matter of fact, since I don't believe in god or religion in general, I don't 

believe in heaven, hell, the ten commandments, karma, or anything like that. 

I don't do what I consider bad or immoral things because I want to be a good 

person, not because I'm afraid of going to hell or bad karma or something.
Doesn't that make me better than a person who does good things just because
they believe if they don't they'll be punished for it later on?  Do you see
what I'm saying?  I figure I should be a fuckin VIP in heaven for being nice 

for no reason.

But Jeff,  I just had to tell you that because what you said is something I
believe very deeply and strongly, and I wanted to give you props.  Right on.

And if I offended anyone who is religious, sorry.  What you believe is not
wrong (how the hell would I know), I just don't agree with it.

xoxo--Miccaela

You don't believe in Jesus?

 Jesus was a real flesh & blood human being.. I think. I don't know for
sure. He seemed to have super natural powers. He might not be from this
planet. But he was real none the less.. Maybe it's the whole god thing your
referring to..  =]:...
 I don't know if God is real or not. I will have to wait and see. And if he
is real, and he don't let me hang out in Heaven because I didn't beleive in
him. Then he is not the kind of person I want to hang out with anyways. I
would rather take my chances with Satan if God is that arrogent..

 So there..
And I love everyone. Cause we all share the same energy. And it's kinna
more special than we all think. I think. I don't know though. Because I
have yet to see the light...

You know?
Hmm...

Everyone will have their two cents on this one, but there is one DJ I have
to mention.  Michel Deveau out of Halifax Canada is at the top of my list
right now.  He spins everything from funky, disco house to west coast
breaks.  He's technically brilliant and knows how to work a crowd all night
long.  I think he may be coming to SF some time over the winter... keep an
eye out.  
smiles,
Andrew

Ack first of all I hate it when I forget to cc sfraves so sorry jason if you get this twice.

I must also sing the praises of Rob Vaughn.  I am also from the midwest and I 
have been blessed to see him spin at many parties and at the old lizard lounge
in dallas.  He has taken me on many journeys.  You will not be disappointed.

I also like Mystic bill from chicago a lot, he spins some sick house/tribal

but there are a lot of local DJ's that deserve props and they know who they are

= )
peace,
herb

Personally I think you were all up to something . . . the ciggeretes
didnt you know only criminals smoke.=) Second playing pool . . why
would you play pool when you can go bowling. Third why were you
writing, didn't you know only criminals write on things.=) Well since
you now know nothing you do is right . . . now you must know who ever
said doing the right thing is the most fun.

Dilbert's Office Prayer

Grant me the serenity
To accept the things
I cannot change;
The courage to change the things 
I cannot accept;
And the wisdom to hide the bodies 
of those people I had to kill
today because they pissed me off. 
And also,
Help me to be careful
Of the toes I step on today as they 
May be connected to the butt
That I might have to kiss tomorrow.

Hey, I really like Grand Master Flash, in fact he is one of the reasons
I enjoy watching the Chris Rock show since he is the resident DJ.
He is also one of the reasons I enjoyed Planet Rock so much, 
in fact I'm one of the little G's. 
But that's OK- some people just can't see the difference between
trash and excellence- 

Bye4Now- Betty

 ahh i see. yes it is true . . . most kids cant see real talent. g
funk or not. grand master flash is a excellent dj. and some kids just
see the color of his skin, and the approach of his audience . . . and
look down. maybe they should think a sec . . . something different is
something bad.

since _everyone_ on this list has decided to reply to this post, i guess
i have to do the same. not that i mind or anything! ;) actually, this is
a really neat way to get to know each other. sure, it doesn't come close
to actually _talking_ to each other irl, but hey...nothing in this world
is perfect! =)

anyway, here are my favorite djs and acts:

***djs***

robert leiner (sweden, the man behind the project "the source")
david (sweden, the man spins the most amazing 5 hour sets you'll ever
        hear!)
cari lekebusch (sweden, look for him on planet rhythm releases)
frankie bones (i know i'm not alone on this one, just ask mars and
                mystr-e)
josh wink (live, _not_ on tape or cd. he's the bomb when he's playful)
paul oakenfold (the man who brought goa trance to the western world)
commander tom
carl cox
tony de vit
sasha (a few years ago, he's lost it by now...)

and the amazing locals:

micron (dan for president!)
macadio
drc (girl power? *smile*)
uncle noah (so he's not really a local, but i still love him!)
kid bippy ("i wanna kiss myself - dominator dominator" old skool 4ever!)

***acts***

kraftwerk

that should be it. but hey, there are a few other acts that have meant
a lot to me...

depeche mode
yazoo/erasure (vince clarke's projects after he left depeche in 81)
star pilot on channel k (s.p.o.c.k)
page (ask jupiter to play you something by them, he has all my cds)
the orb (if you've seen my tattoo you should know this...)
klf (their comeback show was weird, but still awesome!!!)
howie b (so what if he sold out and started producing u2, he's still a
        god when it comes to making ambient music...)
frank sinatra
emmanuel top (and i'm not just talking about "seven days and one week")
pablo gargano (the man behind basically everything on eve records)
dr dre
a tribe called quest
notorious big
mary j blige
erykah badu

and the list goes on and on...

much love to all of you. i hope to see you all soon! =)

jonas the happy spaceboy.

I have to give peter (boomerang) props for the way that he answered
this question.  I like different dj's for different reasons, some kick
my ass, some take my head and won't give it back for 2 hours, while
others are just fun.  i even like some house dj's.  =P

let's see....

jungle...
re-ach
science
siphon..though i'm not sure what u played at play nice...j/k

originality..
mr. boomerang fidget
andy w.

kicks ass....
li
macadio (minus the big-head, which i'm sure is currently inflating)
ernie deaks
ethan

perfect for the morning
cloud
drenalin

sfraves faves...
vertigo
todd manley (one tall mutha)

and i like the old wicked crew for turning me on to some funky and
trancey house.

and i must also give props to anyone who has EVER gotten the balls or
ovaries to get behind the decks and try to turn people on to their
sound.

on a side note...i love dj's that have their own sound and are
original...keep it coming.

thanks,
micron

ALSO...sorry about my set at the abyss kids....me no was feeling so
good.  =P

Slow house music all night. My friends couldn't get a beat going. Doesn't the
DJ know if the floor is empty the music ain't happening. Great place...but it
needs some high energy. What ever happend to 130+BBM?

it's really cool to see people who can appreciate a truly good dj. often
times i think ravers are somewhat uneducated about djs. i think there are
a lot of djs who can mix (and alot who can't) but just as in art, or
literature, or anything else, there are few masters, and people should
learn to recognize them.

Hi kids!  I just wanted to ask for some opinions.  I just wanted to get you
Sf Ravers to do some thinking.  I thought that this might get all you that
are signed up but never post to add in your thoughts.  (you know who you are
:-)!!)  If you all could post your favorite music and your favorite DJ I
would totally love it!  I think it is so interesting to see the diversity in
people's opinions.  I have my own favorites but I always find it interesting
to hear others.  Just to get you all going I wiil post my favorites  :-)

I LOVE:  Joey Beltram, Danny the Wild Child, and Kid Bippy~*~

I also LOVE:  Micron, Deeks, and Maya 13  ( I also like Macadio although I
haven't heard him spin too many times!!!  I always miss his set some how.)

I am a big fan of Techno and JUNGLE!!!

Thanks to anyone that posts and I'll be listening for your DJ's!!  See you on
the scene!  
 
                                                          Hugs and Sloppy

DJ's I admire...hmmm...

Mark E. Quark- The smoothest I have ever heard. He has the most
amazing                 ear, and I've been trying to reach his level
ever since I                was a chipmunk.

Aphex Twin- Only seen him once, but was one of the most incredible  		
           fucking sets I've ever heard. Pounding acid and funk. Damn.
	             Always wanted to create that kind of energy.

Hey there peeps.  All those great djs being listed, I'm gonna keep my eyes
peeled and ears opened! :)  cool.  Outside of the dance genre, what other
types of music do y'all listen to?  Classical, world, choral, folk, jazz?
What else is good?  I was on a female folk singer kick, ala joni, jewel,
sarah mcgloughlin, loreena mckennit, for a while.  Henrik Gorecki, Satie,
arvo part, are some favorite contemporary classical composers.

Ok I had the pleasure of getting 2 excellent Mixed tapes from 2
excellent DJ's The First one I got is Ceasers(space children) 3rd
transmission tape. And the Second one is hyrogliphs. By Sutekh I know
Seth I screwed up the Name but Hey I can't spell leave that to
Marketing. Ceasers tape is a blend of Bouncy Tek/house with a very
nice Tekno track played ulta slow that im still trying to get it is DJ
misjah M5 or Off the beat if anyone wants to sell it let me know!!.
Nice mixing kind of got a little housey in one point but for the most
part pretty bumping good Car Music not his usual Prime time sound and
that is good I like "Car Music" A very nice Tek house tape I recommend
it for vital listens.. Now the next tape I pop in is Seth's Tape Let
me tell you this boy is on the Verge he has a diverse style that I can
totally Dig. His tape was way experimental Ambient Tekno if you will.
Not sure how to classify other then experimental. A lot of Intelligent
Tekno in there it had me thinking the whole tape. Excellent mixing it
was very smooth. Now WARING: it is experimental and very downbeat if
you are looking for poundy in your face Tekno tracks I suggest the
First Sutekh Vs. Klank Tape I forgot the name of it but Nice colored
Red tape. That tape is very punchy. His new one is more on the
Intelligent tip Still very Nice good Job's Guys!!! Enuff of my
rambling..

	Ok, since Diego is missing in action, I thought I'd inform the rest of the
community that #sfraves [the IRC channel] is organizing a gathering.  We'll
be having dinner in Fremont and then going to the Trancemasters party. 
	If you're interested, there's more information aqui:

I don't know what you all are thinking, but this tape is dope!  Nice dark
Trancy feel to it with some bad ass breaks.  Smooth mixes.  Good quality.
If you haven't heard Hak spin then get this tape.  Theres only so many left
so contact my man...

Siphon + Science + Hak = South Bay d&b (SBDB), support it!

Until about 3:30am, come unity was a pretty low energy party with good but
not great music.  As it got later, Jeno started going OFF, and us remaining
hardcores recieved a flawless mixing of slamming beats until 6am (wasn't it
supposed to end at 4:30?)  Props to Carlos for picking up the energy.
Truly a memorable come unity - the first in a loooong time where I felt a
sense of community :\

On Saturday October 4th, over 20 countries will unite to create the world's
biggest dance event to raise awareness and funds to support the freedom of
the Tibetan people.
For the first time on such a massive scale EARTHDANCE brings together a
team of international party promoters to create a unified global dancefloor
where we will join as a one world community to dance for peace and earth
transformation.
The climax of the event will be a simultaneous dancefloor link-up where at
a specific moment every DJ in every country will play a specially created
track for world peace at the same time, unifying all dancefloors and all
dancers.
Conceived by Return To The Source producer and Medicine Drum member Chris
Deckker, this groundbreaking event has evolved into a worldwide vision.
Participating countries include: England, Japan, Australia, Israel,
America, Canada, Holland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Mexico, and
more.
A live Webcast is also planned linking at least 5 major capitols via ISDN
links.

Participating in San Francisco, where one of the largest population of
Tibetan refugees reside, Space Children, and Satori Arts^ presents
EARTHDANCE SAN FRANCISCO at the Civic Center Plaza Park in downtown San
Francisco as a free outdoor gathering from 12noon to 6pm.
A special appearance by the internationally respected master musician and
artist -Karma Moffett will open this event with the traditional sounds of
Sacred Tibetan Music to focus the collective intention of the people on
coming together in the name of Human Justice & Freedom for the Tibetan
people.  For the next five hours, DJ's Graeme, Cesar, Dutch, Twerk, and on
four turntables: UFOxJason MousexNoel will bring the best of Techno, House
& Jungle music that will unify the timeless archtypal energies of dance
inherent in all people.
At the closing of the event, Dennis Cusack of the International Committee
of Lawyers for Tibet will speak on the current state of the Tibetan people,
how this affects us all as a global community, and what you can do to help
insure that Peace and Freedom will prevail for the people of Tibet. During
the event, representatives from the Bay Area Friends of Tibet, the
International Committee of Lawyers for Tibet, and the Tibetan Association
of Northern California will be present to offer information on how you can
directly aid the cause of liberating the people of Tibet, and preserving
their culture which has done so much to inspire and enrich the collective
culture of the world.

This entire event will have digital film coverage that will be transmitted
via ISDN by Cyberworld Cafe to London and mixed by Virgin Net,then sent
back out over the internet for all the world to watch.  The complete
footage from every participating country will afterwards be sent to London
to be used in a broadcast documentary.  Also, for those who missed this
year's Earthdance, and the one time opportunity to dance for the freedom of
Tibet, an Earthdance CD will be realeased in January/February 1998,
complete with the music and pictures from the globally unified event that
is bringing the world's attention to bringing freedom to the Tibetan
Nation.

October 4th will be the catalystic date, but the cause of Peace and Freedom
is taking place every moment in life, so as this year comes to its close,
be on the watch for future night events that will provied you the
opportunity to  celebrate in taking part in the global movement of bringing
peace and soverignity to the Tibetan people.

Hello pretty peeps, I came across this article on the usenet about
a techno/rave documentary.  Thought it might raise an interesting 
discussion on the effect of media on the dance culture.

Billboard Magazine, October 4, 1997
Music Video - Programming
CLEOPATRA DOCUMENTS THE ELECTRONICA SCENE ON FILM
By Carrie Bell

LOS ANGELES- in an effort to expose the underground rave scene to a
mainstream audience,Cleopatra Pictures and Entertainment Group is
preparing the first full-length documentary onelectronic music,
featuring appearances by breakout acts like Moby, Aphex Twin, the
Crystal Method, and Sneaker Pimps.

"This culture has been around for at least a decade, but very few people
really know the history and what it's all about," says Cleopatra
president Brian Perera. "We wanted to create a film that took people
there, showed them the inside, and dispelled any false rumors."

The film, tentatively titled ""Better Living Through Circuitry," started
shooting in March at the Winter Music Conference in Miami. Since then,
the crew has filmed in New York, Los Angeles, and San Diego. It also
hopes to work Detroit and London shoots into the $100,000 budget.

Cleopatra expects to have the first cut by December and a finished
product by spring 1998, although it has yet to be determined whether the
project will have a wide theatrical release or go straight to video.

"Several companies have expressed interest in releasing the movie to
theaters, including Trimark, Nonfiction Films, Miramax, and October,"
says producer Brian McNelis. "I think people realize this is a good time
for this film. The music is just starting to change from an underground
urban legend to something they listen to in Des Moines. It's prior to
the burnout stage, and the artists are the most interesting and genuine
at this point." 

Directed by Jonathan Reiss--known for his music video work with Nine
Inch Nails, Black Crowes, and Type O Negative--the film will include
performance footage, location shots with opinions from police and fans,
and interviews with pivotal players like MTV's "Amp" producer Todd
Mueller and Maverick A&R representative/KCRW Los Angeles DJ Jason
Bentley. Other artists involved in the project are Electric Skychurch,
DJ Frankie Bones, Keoki, DJ Spooky, Fluke, and Death In Vegas.

"We tried to incorporate popular, historical, and up-and-coming bands.
This film is narrated by the people who live this lifestyle. Everything
you learn from the film will come from the mouth of an insider," McNelis
says.

 The authenticity of the project is what convinced the Crystal Method to
participate.

 "They are trying to avoid the 'Hard Copy' image of the scene's problems
and expose this energetic and supportive community," says the Crystal
Method's Scott Kirkland. "We're excited to see the final product and
hope it sheds light on people's misconceptions. And we're always
thankful for publicity."

 McNelis says one reason Cleopatra, which owns three record labels
specializing in techno, is involved with the film is that the subject
matter offers a "visual arena" for the fashion, color, technology, and
live experience of electronic music.

 "It is an eye-candy culture. Just look at all the artists who tour with
videos or the efforts that goes into designing CD and poster artwork or
creating the perfect outfit for an all-nighter," McNelis says.

 Retailers agree that electronica can only be helped by the film. "Think
of it as an extended music video. Music films are the next best thing to
being there, and electronic music is tied so heavily to how the music
makes you feel," says Bob Reamer, a music buyer for Borders. "This can
only drive CD sales for the bands involved. Not only do fans of techno
eat up compilations, but electronica-heavy soundtracks like "The Saint"
also sold well."

 Perera says there will more than likely be a companion album, although
his record labels probably won't release it. Both Sony and Warner have
expressed interest.

 "Our main concern right now is getting the film done and out there for
public consumption," Perera says. "We are taking the business part very
slowly because we want to find partners with the same goals, and do what
is best for the bands and people involved."

I forgot to mention my favorite Burning Man DJ,

	JakeLoco (Jonas) who hijacked my dusty old 1200's at 1 am  
and kicked out the house beats until bedtime.  Anyone who had the nuts
to take their records into the desert is True in my eyes.
  He's from SoCal, I think; threw some parties down there; and I 
believe he's spinning at a party tonight (Friday) in Berkeley.  
Check him out if you get the chance.

Oooh, so many good djs, but so far my favorites are:
DJ Slipmatt (Happy Hardcore legend)
Josh Wink (needs no introduction)
. . . and . . .
local boy (from Sac) on SFRaves--Stillwind (spins some very nice trance)
oh yeah, and Star Eyes, and whoever that guy w/ the dreadlocks who spun a 
remix of "Foxy Lady" at the beginning of Big Top.  He was the bomb.

My favorite types of music:
happy hardcore/4-Beat, acid house, deep house, acid trance, drum & 
bass/intelligent jungle (stupid name but there is such a thing as stupid 
jungle--IMHO)

And I will name my favorite artists too:
Justin Time (or is he a dj?), Josh Wink, Armand Van Helden, Plasticman, Moby 
(when he's not screaming like at Big Top), Photek, Goldie, Chemical Brothers, 
808 State, Future Sound of London, The Prodigy (hey!  stop rolling your eyes!  
I mean pre-Firestarter/Fat of the Land Prodigy), Eat Static, and I'm sure I 
forgot someone.

Latest purchase (thought this was relevant):  Kinder Atom's "Super Nice Hippy 
Pants"  Will arrive in the mail soon, can't wait!

xoxo--Miccaela

Hi kids!  I just wanted to ask for some opinions.  I just wanted to get you
Sf Ravers to do some thinking.  I thought that this might get all you that
are signed up but never post to add in your thoughts.  (you know who you are
:-)!!)  If you all could post your favorite music and your favorite DJ I
would totally love it!  I think it is so interesting to see the diversity in
people's opinions.  I have my own favorites but I always find it interesting
to hear others.  Just to get you all going I wiil post my favorites  :-)

I LOVE:  Joey Beltram, Danny the Wild Child, and Kid Bippy~*~

I also LOVE:  Micron, Deeks, and Maya 13  ( I also like Macadio although I
haven't heard him spin too many times!!!  I always miss his set some how.)

I am a big fan of Techno and JUNGLE!!!

Thanks to anyone that posts and I'll be listening for your DJ's!!  See you on
the scene!

I HAVE WHAT SEEMS TO BE A BIG PROBLEM. 

 I chipped a big ass hole on one of my top molars with my tounge ring & may have 
also cracked a tooth or two.  My parents don't know that I have my tounge 
pierced,(as of tonight I no longer do-I am fed up and am leaving it out.)  But I 
need to definatly get this fixed...SOON!  What believable thing could I say, (I 
am NOT telling them that I had my tounge pierced & bit my bar!) to the dentist 
and my parents that could've caused a major CRACK in my TOOTH or Put a small 
hole/chip on a tooth?
	No believable answer that my parents can see...if they find out I had my 
tounge pierced no more raves for me.

Teresa

Thought I'd drop in my favorites in for Glitter Princess'  "survey" -
(wouldn't want any of them to feel left out if they happen to be subscribed
to our little list!)

Hands down  - we're talking league of his own so there is no comparison
(anyone who's seen him live - I mean close enough to really watch what he
does - 3 decks, a 909 and an 808 - programming on the fly and mixing average
30 seconds each track -knows what I mean).... alien funky techno
messiah..............JEFF MILLS!!

Following sort of close behind in no particular order : Dave Clarke, Richie
Hawtin, Joey Beltram, Carl Cox on 3 decks doing hard house/techno, Billy
Nasty, Surgeon, Tony De Vit, Darren Pearce, Sven Vath, Josh Wink with a hard
set, Claude Young, Grooverider

locally:  still DJ Dan,  Donald Glaude,  Ethan, Jon Williams, Seanie Boy,
 Doran, David Michael,  even Norman on rare occaisions ...........

Stop here unless you want the editorial comments..........

You probably don't need me to tell you I live and breathe Detroit techno (not
an easy thing to do in SF) - also hard house, hard trance, hard hard jungle,
fast breakbeat,  basically the faster the better (I can only dance to gabber
for about 20 min though) and more than one set of happy hardcore is a little
much for me (its those squeaky voices that get to me). Goa gets old after  4
or 5 hours too. But I listen to Detroit style techno from the minute I wake
up till I'm ready to sleep  - yup  JB 3 is on right now....(Forklift) - .
Sometimes I just leave the CD on repeat all night while I sleep (Jeff Mills
Live from the Liquid Room - Tokyo).   My neighbors must LOVE me!

I think most people who don't like techno haven't had the opportunity to hear
really good techno. It just so very rarely makes it all the way out here, and
when it does the vibe is not there because people aren't familiar with the
music or the style or are expecting something else, or I don't know why..  I
was very fortunate to live in London last year and heard sounds like I've
never heard anywhere before. They say techno is dying there
already.......it'll be too bad if SF missed it altogether. I've still got
mixtapes, but its not the same as on a massive clear sound system with loads
of other people more into it even than you are. Everybody tries to sing along
to these minimal techno noises - no words of course - and it works. 

I'd like to see Jeff Mills vs. Grooverider -we'd have to run for cover !!!

Sorry for the long answer to a short question !  glad you like jb too!

Glad to know I'm not alone on this one - slow music is for listening (you can
do that alone at home) - dance music should be fast! (IMO) (its harder to do
that alone at home) Why is SF the bastion of slow, groovy, funky, deep,
soulful house? Aren't we over it yet? Why do people think slower = mature?

from 12-6 pm, there is a FREE outdoor gethering at the San Francisco Civic
Center Plaza.

It is sponsored by Space Children, Return to the Source, and Mixmag
magazine and is part of a 20-nation unified dance party going on today,
striving to raise consciousness in the youth about the EVILS that have
gone down and are in threat of continuing in Tibet.

GRAEME
CESAR & TWERK
DUTCH
UFO/JASON MOUSE/NOEL on 4 turntables

That is the line-up.  This party, again is free, and for an excellent
cause.  Simply be being there, we will show our solidarity with a
beautiful culture, whose people have been oppressed and abused in
countless unthinkable ways under Chinese occupation.  This event is a
chance to raise our fists as we slip into the music.  Outside, on what
looks like it's going to be a lovely day.  For free.  DO IT.

415.675.4700 for more details.


THEN...................



Once again, ladies and gentlemen, may I draw your attention to:

Raggajungle Dub Clash tonight, Saturday at IL PIRATA, 2007 16th @ Potrero.

AHH!!! Oh no.... I didn't have time to post yestaday... but now I'm caving in
and doing it.   
     Well, first off, I love all my SFR djs =)~* Mad Propz to you guys....
      
       Second of all, I think it depends on the party and maybe condition of
the dj, but sometimes djs I really hate have a set that completely goes off
and I can't stop moving, and vice versa.

     But My all time favorites are...

     Dj Dan          Daniel From Moontribe         Simply Jeff/ Ron D. Core 
          
      Perhaps a few others... I love anyone who gets me moving.. and someday
I wanna be just like them.  Keep dancin.

       hugs n'stuff,
         'trice the tekno diva             <<<<RAVEON>>>>

An excuse that has always worked for me is "I was doing grandmaster
flash when his prince-albert cracked my molar". The other one that
usually works on less liberal parents is "I was helping my girlfriend
extract a 2-gauge bar that rusted into her nipple."  If your parents
are really strict and have no sense of humour whatsoever, you can
always say "I was stripping the insulation off a wire in my friend's
engine after his/her car got stuck in the middle of nowhere and we had
to fix it without the aid of tools while we were slowly being encircled
by folks that were trying to capture me a lifetime of slavery in sheik
yerbouti's harem." (The old I did it to escape the ravages of
white-slavery excuse).

Sorry, I'd probably be a little less sardonic if you hadn't called
Grandmaster Flash "trash" and made disparaging comments about all the
"little G's"... Good luck and remember that karma works in mysterious
ways: one moment you can cracker on the ebony, and the next you're
cracking your ivories.

That was titled Bi-Pass.  That tape fucking rules.  Such a great, bomb

Well, seeing as how I am back in the wondrous profression od dental

People really have done such things, as well as trying to bite off beer

funk? why would I want funk? And I beg your pardon, but rhythm is rhythm, and
you certainly need it at 180 BPM as much if not more than 110.  Fred Astaire
was a skinny tweeky white guy who probably had no booty to speak of. (ask
Ginger)

Anyone can distinguish a person who is simply moving fast and there happens
to be music on around him, and someone who is moving to the music, who has
the music inside, connected with their natural frequency , and it happens to
be fast (or looks that way to everyone else - ever see the Star Trek episode
Blink of an Eye?)

Slow music is soothing, lulling (as in lullabye), it calms you into a state
of .....sleep! Or so tired and relaxed you'd rather be asleep. Dancing is my
cardio vascular -remember I'm still alive vehicle.

We obviously have completely divergent natural frequencies. Do you like
asparagus?

well i have no scientific proof but this is the foolish fish theory
of why some may think that slower =mature

we have fewer brain cells so we think slower therefore our
natural resonant frequency is much slower as we age.

we also have fewer teeth as we age so we chew our food slower.

in general life just  seems to slow down as we age...unless
of coarse you're a foolish fish...

so that's why i believe slower is sometimes associated with 
being more mature

And then there is the saturn return that happens around
the age of 28 but we wont get into astrology today.

I hope this generation decides to change that and uses
the experience of aging to speed things up...will
we be dancing to 400 bpm when were 90 years old?

well enough thinking for today...im off to the civic

     Hi all,

     But at the last hours, yeps kewl.
     Very spacey and nice people (hi marianne, and the rest)

     http://www.uta.fi/~trerra/index.html
     http://www.tanzdiebe.bayern.com/  )
     
     I will put this links on one webpage together, so that the people have 
     no problems to find the right place for vacation :-)

	Alright, with the help of Julie Mae I've put together
some directions for those late in deciding who wants to come
to the #sfraves gathering.  All the info can be found on:

	http://www.accesscom.com/~nico/sfraves.html

	I hope I see as many of you there as possible and 
if I don't see you in Fremont I EXPECT you to be at Trancemasters.  : )

	*Wear your laminates!*  : ) : ) : )

It's been my experience that the best clubs/raves/events are either 18
or older or all ages.

well ime not a doctor but i played doctor with the neighbor girl 
when i was little

Nor do i really feel much sympathy for people that like to pierce
themselves like cattle but thats just my opinion and taste.

However i would suggest that you tell them the truth and if you must lie
then tell them you bit into some chinese candy...some of that stuff
is petrified i think. The dentist is going to see your pierced tounge
so there is no sense even trying to lie to her/him. Theres all kinds
of things that can break a tooth so just take your pick. And in the
future if you must pierce yourself try piercing something
that you have more than one of like a breast or something so that if 
you mess one up you will still have one good one left.

Ok...dr fish will now take the next caller.

i know i sorta touched it when i did my intro a few weeks ago, yet i have
to comment on some stellar performers i have heard since ive been here
that make my favorits list

Djs: Richie Hawtin (+8), Pixie (Spiraltribe), DJ Silence (Santa
Cruz), Prozac (Disco B), Abe Duque (Tension/SG), Dylan Drazen (Club
Craft), Neil Landstrumm (Scandinavia), Function (Downwards, Relief),
Joelectronik (N.E.W.)

and live acts: Regis+Function (Downwards), Raul (Sheep)

NOTE: Dj Silence :) this kid is AWESOME i was really psyched to hear his
music on top of that mountain he tore it up and people loved it :) go
future galactic in california!!

I also have consolidated my music tastes, because a lot of people ask me
what kind of music i like, and i if say "techno" i get this look of "oh"
"great, did i see you on 20/20?"... or if i say "detroit" and people that
have never heard anyone from detroit hear that... it doesnt help

so... instead of saying "YEAH i really dig techno on a new and
fresh minimal yet sometimes overwhelming tip, but its gotta be engaging
and have the funk, and i dig jungle if its new and groundbreaking and
sounds like something ive never heard or imagined before, and i like
experimental ambient, but it cant have
any of that cheesy garbage in it, and i like house if its deep
and its got wicked soul, and i like reggae in its most blown out mental
form...." ... i just say "I like Future Music"

so!
where is the most wicked underground Future Music presentation tonight??
thanks!
-dsp

(translations: if i say wicked and diesel too much you gotta remember that
im from northern new england ;)

wicked is kind of a boston/salem word... diesel definitely comes from my
farmboy roots.

Well, well, well... I think it would be harder to ask the question, 
"what music don't I like?" Inky binky we can all be stinky, not as linky 
as my pinky unless I am listenning to...
--DJ Stonie-Cloud Factory, I believe-bomb old school! and you just can't 
stop moving your tooshy
--Matt Schmitt-Harmony I think. Hi matt  :) he just spins cool 
stuff-soory my brain doesn't really want to ellaborate too much right 
now.
--Siphon-radical, totally awesome dude type jungle :P Hi Noah
--DJ Lori-bomb ass trance make me wiggle my butt a lot
--And last, but not least, I would like for everyone to be on the 
lookout for a New SouthBay kid, only 17 yrs. old, he is a great friend 
of mine and he spins some nice stuff(jungle/trance) His name is Joel, 
but goes by 

  DJ Eleven: on a scale from 1-10, ten is pretty good, but Eleven is 
just that much better
  He ha, look for him, meet him, you wont regret it, and listen to him
S                   P                     I                      N

them, and they'll hate you even more  :P

  I met an unusual person this morning, they said that their name was 
Life.  I was not aware of this Life person but there she was.  Divine, 
broad, and smiling.
  She reached her arm out gently to me in a white, satin gown and said 
in a soft, relaxing voice, "bABy HueY, you must love me for I am not 
immortal, and neither are you.  You need to respect and cherish me.  I 
am your destiny.  
  Breath bAByHueY, breath in the warmth and love that you and I share 
together.  Breath in the friends of whom you love and care about.  
Breath every moment of every beautiful minute in which millions of your 
people are doing the same.  Breath, breath, breath."
  "Ooohh!" I thought, "this is some kind of awakening or something."  
This person kind of scared me in a way that nothing else can. But being 
the curious guy that I am, I listened to her voice some more.
  "bAByHueY, You need to accept who you are and who the people are that 
you love, and love them.  Give them all that you can give them. Give 
them a piece of your heart, a piece of your soul, and a piece of your 
destiny.  Days are days, and forever is forever.  Memories are forever.  
Let's both become one individual and make all the happiest memories that 
we can.  Let's breath together the same air, the same love and the same 
ambitions for I have not known you until today.  And together we can cry 
happily forever, beyond memories.

* I just wanted everyone out there to breath the same air that I am 
breathing. and for someone to rent with me J/k  :P
Tomorrow, when most of you will read this, remember that today is not 
going to be what happened yesterday, it is new, and with all new things, 
we must learn and use to the best of our capabilities.*

Good Night and sweet dreams with your big, hairy, hangin'

Mr Fish -
Interesting theory - all I know is Civic Centergave me a pleasant
surprise-fix of <good>  techno. Graeme and especially Twerk x Cesar made me
move my 32 yr old bones for over 21/2 hrs solid! Even in the wrong shoes on
squishy uneven surface. Didn't feel any pain......until the music stopped.
Luckily I had Derrick May's Mayday Mix already to go when I got home.

Great weather, great music, great vibe (the civic center locals made things
colorful). Was there any other info on Tibet or money collection other than
the guy at the end? (I got there late) Anyone remember that website?

thnks -  jd

Because when your 21+ you don't want to party with cracked out kids.
Besides be patient when your 21+ which seems to be soon, you'll really

Actually the tounge is the only piercing that heals with no trace at all.
Thats why it closes up 15-20min.

Couldn't make it to Fantasy Island, due to lack of $$$ and other elements.
Decided to check out Earthdance thingy that Space Children was putting on,
because I hadn't gone to a day party in a loongggggg time and Space Children
day parties are usually a lot of fun and FREE. The key word! Anywayz, I had a
really good time at the Civic Center. The grass was very squishy and uneven
which made me dance a little funkier than usual, but it was rilly fun. There
were all sorts of people which created a very interesting vibe, a nice one
nonetheless.

I heard about Trancemasters being cancelled. So what did everyone end up
doing instead? For those that went to Fantasy Island, how did that go?

Hmmmm....maybe macadio really DOESN'T spin...maybe he just doesn't want
us to KNOW about it ;-)

j/k, of course.

I think the only time I've heard him spin, though, is the warmth cd...

we must find a solution to this problem.

As the Care Bears said in the movie "The Care Bear Movie II",
"Everyone hold hands! If you have ever cared do it now. Tell your friend
next to you how much you care. Tell everyone in the room how much you
care. Tell him! Tell him again! Shout it! Help us!".
Then they all say "We care!" Hellza loud and they bring the little girl
back from a coma or something. Good movie. Makes you really happy on e.
Love,
Paul*E*Wog

We got there before anyone had formed a line---it was so dead that I 
thought maybe we had the wrong place.  But no, for a while the inside was 
kinda empty, no real vibe, real s l o w.  But around 12 things picked up 
and by 1 I thought that the place was jumping real hard.  Jon Bishop had 
everyone screaming.  The energy in the room where he was unreal.  I was 
going to explode.  The decorations were great and in front of the dj 
setup was a model of the Golden Gate Bride, fantastic is all I can say.  
Too bad I had to leave at 2.  Missed Frankie Bones.

I am sorry for my post on Grand Master Flash. 

	 I really shouldn't talk, I don't really know a lot of his work.  I had 
based my comments on hearsay.  And also for me being politically incorrect or 
have not thought about what I was typing.  Especially on when I had noted at 
the little "g's".  I had put a rather broad amount of people into a small 
catogory...in fact one might say that I could fit into it also.  
	It was late and I was stressed, so I took it out on SFR and the by 
standers that I do not know.>>>end.<<<
	Please accept and that I will rethink what I want to post.

    CLEOPATRA DOCUMENTS THE ELECTRONICA SCENE ON FILM
    By Carrie Bell
    
    LOS ANGELES- in an effort to expose the underground rave scene to a
    mainstream audience,Cleopatra Pictures and Entertainment Group is
    preparing the first full-length documentary onelectronic music,
    featuring appearances by breakout acts like Moby, Aphex Twin, the
    Crystal Method, and Sneaker Pimps.
    
    "This culture has been around for at least a decade, but very few people
    really know the history and what it's all about," says Cleopatra
    president Brian Perera. "We wanted to create a film that took people
    there, showed them the inside, and dispelled any false rumors."
    
    The film, tentatively titled ""Better Living Through Circuitry," started
    shooting in March at the Winter Music Conference in Miami. Since then,
    the crew has filmed in New York, Los Angeles, and San Diego. It also
    hopes to work Detroit and London shoots into the $100,000 budget.
    
    Cleopatra expects to have the first cut by December and a finished
    product by spring 1998, although it has yet to be determined whether the
    project will have a wide theatrical release or go straight to video.
    
    "Several companies have expressed interest in releasing the movie to
    theaters, including Trimark, Nonfiction Films, Miramax, and October,"
    says producer Brian McNelis. "I think people realize this is a good time
    for this film. The music is just starting to change from an underground
    urban legend to something they listen to in Des Moines. It's prior to
    the burnout stage, and the artists are the most interesting and genuine
    at this point." 
    
    Directed by Jonathan Reiss--known for his music video work with Nine
    Inch Nails, Black Crowes, and Type O Negative--the film will include
    performance footage, location shots with opinions from police and fans,
    and interviews with pivotal players like MTV's "Amp" producer Todd
    Mueller and Maverick A&R representative/KCRW Los Angeles DJ Jason
    Bentley. Other artists involved in the project are Electric Skychurch,
    DJ Frankie Bones, Keoki, DJ Spooky, Fluke, and Death In Vegas.
    
    "We tried to incorporate popular, historical, and up-and-coming bands.
    This film is narrated by the people who live this lifestyle. Everything
    you learn from the film will come from the mouth of an insider," McNelis
    says.
    
     The authenticity of the project is what convinced the Crystal Method to
    participate.
    
     "They are trying to avoid the 'Hard Copy' image of the scene's problems
    and expose this energetic and supportive community," says the Crystal
    Method's Scott Kirkland. "We're excited to see the final product and
    hope it sheds light on people's misconceptions. And we're always
    thankful for publicity."
    
     McNelis says one reason Cleopatra, which owns three record labels
    specializing in techno, is involved with the film is that the subject
    matter offers a "visual arena" for the fashion, color, technology, and
    live experience of electronic music.
    
     "It is an eye-candy culture. Just look at all the artists who tour with
    videos or the efforts that goes into designing CD and poster artwork or
    creating the perfect outfit for an all-nighter," McNelis says.
    
     Retailers agree that electronica can only be helped by the film. "Think
    of it as an extended music video. Music films are the next best thing to
    being there, and electronic music is tied so heavily to how the music
    makes you feel," says Bob Reamer, a music buyer for Borders. "This can
    only drive CD sales for the bands involved. Not only do fans of techno
    eat up compilations, but electronica-heavy soundtracks like "The Saint"
    also sold well."
    
     Perera says there will more than likely be a companion album, although
    his record labels probably won't release it. Both Sony and Warner have
    expressed interest.
    
     "Our main concern right now is getting the film done and out there for
    public consumption," Perera says. "We are taking the business part very
    slowly because we want to find partners with the same goals, and do what
    is best for the bands and people involved."

i don't know what kind of scooby snacks i was chomping on when i wrote 
that last post...
somehow i forgot to include Stacey Pullen in my dj list. as the musician 
list should tell you i'm a complete detroitophile, i don't love a lot of 
mr pullen's tracks, but technically he's one of the cleanest mixer i've 
heard (and a few of my favorite detroit artists are less than meticulous 
mixers, i won't say more for fear of incriminating myself) and he mixes 
as an art into itself, totally blending tracks, not just mixing one into 
the other, or just knowing how to build a vibe, he actually creates 
something new and unbeleiveable in the mixes and layers. you have to 
*know* your tracks to do that. He also does something I'm sure Derrick 
taught him and few dj's do well, to hold back and then jack the roof off, 
he will play simpler tracks at lower volumes and then suddenly drop a 
bomb track that seems all the more spectacular because it suprises you 
then build it up and up to the breakdown. waaayy to many dj's think that 
a good set is the maximum number of bomb tracks back to back at steady 
maximum volume. think about it... it's like a rollercoaster that never 
slows down or rolls back up hill leaving you a little time to catch your

So I went to Martinez this weekend to visit an old college buddy and spin 
some rekkids at his house before a dazzling slide show and a really fun 
set by DJ Maiz (she's the bomb, kids!). 

Anyway, on Friday night (my friend's party was on Saturday) I went down 
to Kate O'Brien's to hear these other friends of friends who were 
supposed to be spinning for some sort of fashion show thing.  

So the genre at the location was pretty much downtempo groove, if I had 
to give it a name.  A lot of instrumentals from the early-mid sixties 
with plenty of groovy saxophones and organs, etc.  

My friend's friends who were DJing there were really nice.  It was also 
nice to see some more women DJs getting out there.  But at this place 
_none_ of the DJs beatmatched.  Not at all.  Now, I don't find 
beatmatching to be a necessity for being a DJ, or even for being a good 
DJ, but it's odd to go into a bar/club location and find no 
beatmatching.  The other thing that I noticed was that although all the 
tracks I heard were really good, there didn't seem to be much continuity 
in the DJs' sets.  It was like being a a friend's house with them up by 
the CD player going, "Oh yeah!  Here's another good one!", you know what 
I mean?  The other thing that kind of got me was how extensive the DJ rig 
was.  They had 2 1200's in good shape with Ortofon DJ carts, a big Numark 
mixer and a set of Numark pitchable CD players.  All that and no 
beatmatching.  I'm not complaining... it was just different... and a 
little odd. :/

So those of you who listen to downtempo and such, is this style of mixing 
more popular in that scene?  The few downtempo DJs that I have seen at 
raves have all been beatmatchers, so I don't really know.

It was good to hear the tracks though.  A lot of them were ones that I 
used to play on my KDVS show wayyyy back in the day when I was spinning 
groove tunes (before I got on my still un-ended techno kick).

Anyway, I had a fun weekend, and I got a glimpse of a whole different 
scene, I think...

LIFE, LIGHT, LOVE & PLUR
=0D
With all the problems around us today it=92s frustrating and depressing t=
o say the least. There are so many individual things wrong and in a thous=
and different directions; in trying to overtake or fix the many problems =
how could and where do you start at.  Life has gotten complex for us ,and=
 our lives nowadays require to much of us to even tackle one or two of th=
ese problems.  Don=92t let this discourage you though because there is a =
possible solution to this mess in the world we live in, and a way to live=
 a happier and fuller existence.
=0D
This message isn=92t a new one but a fresh delivery of it.  What=92s this=
 answer you say?  Well it=92s obvious to most that you can=92t change peo=
ple and their thinking, but there is one person you can change, You.  Thi=
s change that could help many of the problems were are all in together wo=
uld be toward a more positive and uplifting direction in our individual a=
nd personal lives; which then has an affect on those around you and many =
times it even extend much further than the immediate people around you. H=
owever small the change is and however small you may feel in doing this i=
t does have an influence on things.  Everyone knows at least one person w=
ho sparkles and enlivens us when we are around them.  We can all be this =
way and uplift those we come into contact with.  All we need to start wor=
king and trying towards shining and we will have success.  What might be =
a good formula to keep in mind while trying to do this.  How about Peace,=
 Love, Unity and Respect.  =

=0D
Put a little thought to these things and the beauty of what they represen=
t to us individually and as a whole(society).  When these ideals are in p=
ractice by you and me however small it is feed into the =

invisible energy around us.  The beauty of it is not only does it go out =
to those around you and better and brighten their lives, but it is also r=
eflected back to us.  All is Infinite Reflection and Infinite Reflection =
is All.  This is the Law of Cause and Effect or Karma. (Mental causes- th=
oughts and Spiritual causes- emotions)  This Law works in both directions=
 so if you give out Love and Positivity then it=92s reflected back to you=
, and the same if you give out anger and negativity.  Whether people real=
ize this or not does not matter because it=92s a  in the dimension we are=
 in; being a Law it rules all live.  When we realize this Universal Law w=
e then can live in greater harmony with it, and most especially with othe=
r people for As You Give, You Also Receive.  This is a Just Law to say th=
e least being fair and equal to all.  When the Human Race understands the=
 higher Laws that govern our  lives and affairs we will  begin to live in=
 harmony with each other; at this point we will have achieved a great pin=
nacle in the growth of Mankind.    =

=0D
Some might say well I can=92t see this energy or I have done wrong to thi=
s person, and I haven=92t had anything bad happen?  To answer the last pa=
rt of the question first, all things eventually catch up to people, and m=
any times when they would want it least to come.  I know this for my own =
life. Even if you don=92t believe that this is a real Law in operation, g=
ive it some time and thought, for you have nothing to lose, and see if yo=
u can=92t see it manifesting in some ways in your own life or in the live=
s of those around you.  For All Real Truth is Self Revealing (meaning tha=
t if it=92s True and Right then you can and will see it for yourself with=
 some thought and time put to it.)  Now, In response to the first part of=
 the question there is a world of invisible energy around us that respond=
s to our thoughts, emotions, imaginations (make-believes =3D reality in t=
ime), and actions.  We are as unaware of this energy much like a sea crea=
ture is unaware of the water they exist in.  We are affected by this ener=
gy and  we affect this energy ourselves. Many times the feelings we get i=
nside, is us responding to the energy pool we all live in.  We are tuned =
into this energy at different levels, but many of us pass it off or think=
 were imagining these impressions.  Well keep imaging for it is closer to=
 reality than you might think.  Right now even Western science is finding=
 more out about this energy and it can even be photograph and as well as =
science can measure it. =

=0D
The reason all this is relevant to Raves and Parties is much of what happ=
ens is because of energy and the House that is created by all who come fo=
r PLUR.  We also know how to reproduce something we might of otherwise th=
ought was an accident; when we all understand that we exist in an energy =
pool that creates our lives and affects things around us we then can have=
 stronger energy (as belief affects energy) which then creates and can ch=
ange the world outside of us to a more positive and better direction.  We=
 also understand that what you give out isn=92t lost but return back many=
 times with greater interest than the orignal amount given out.  A good s=
eed put into good soil produces a plant or tree that can bear fruit or gi=
ve greater life.
It=92s also important to understand how we are influenced by other people=
, and how we influence them. =

=0D
Much of this influence has been mostly negative and we can point fingers =
at ourselves for problems around us.  Many of us don=92t realize how we h=
ave been sucked into so much negativity.  There was a time in out lives w=
hen we didn=92t see black, white, yellow, brown, red, fat, thin, ugly, pr=
etty, tall, short, medium as important differences.  We saw people=92s he=
arts and who they were underneath those outer expressions.  I feel for me=
 it was this when I was a child, and I had to learn from the society I li=
ved in that those things had relevance and mattered.  It wasn=92t natural=
 to me to think and see things this way.  I was taught from the society I=
 lived in.  Most of the root cause of it was people=92s Fears that had no=
 reality whatsoever in Real Truth.  Fear is our common enemy on this plan=
et.  Fear is causing most of the world=92s woes and problems.  We have Fe=
ar of each other and in many imaginary places.  We learn at a young age t=
o separate away from each other and this is how things are, accept it.  S=
ince we are young we just accept them as Truth; we were entrapped into th=
is way of thinking by the world that raised us.  I can now look at it and=
 say it=92s wrong.  This structure of Fear and Separation is Wrong.  Unit=
ed We Stand Divided We Fall.  I don=92t want to accept what is wrong but =
feel in my heart I must try and bring what is Right not only for me but w=
hat is right for all people for we are all family here under One Creator =
of us all.  I bring up all this because we most know these things are wro=
ng but how are we individually and collectively (society) trying to chang=
e these things.  We are to blame in the sense that we are allowing it to =
stand even if we don=92t contribute to violence, separation, and hatred. =
 People allow things to be and if they didn=92t then those things could n=
ot stand.  I feel many of us are United in our common interest of somethi=
ng is wrong in the world and if we don=92t stand Now and try to make a di=
fference who will.  Everyone is waiting for someone else to start.  If  w=
e=92re all waiting for someone else to start, who=92s going to start?  We=
 need to Now start and give the message of PLUR to all we can and to the =
best of our ability to do so.  We need to focus on fixing it and getting =
things Right not point fingers and blame others, we don=92t have enough t=
ime to.  Don=92t let the World depress you but grow strong in the fact yo=
ur at a place that is a relief from the world we are in.  Our scene and c=
ulture is the starting of a change to a better future and world for us al=
l.  How we can change all this, well as stated before we can only change =
ourselves and our society and culture will arise out of this dreadful dre=
am we are in.  We can make this happen Now, You and I starting wherever w=
e are at in life.  We spread out like fire does or how light overcomes da=
rkness.  Darkness cannot exist where there is Light present, it must hide=
 and run from it.  Light is our answer,  Love is our answer, we must spre=
ad it out far and wide to all so they can see and know for themselves.  W=
hen someone see something of Beauty it affects them deep and they act on =
it.  We must become beauti-full children of the same Creator and extend o=
ut our Light & PLUR to all.  Our strength lies in our Unity of Light, Lif=
e, Love, Peace, Respect.  This is something fear and negativity cannot ha=
ve, for what is it=92s unifying force?  As we do and practice these thing=
s and seek to raise higher in our consciousness and spirits, then we make=
 positive changes and solutions reality.  For as we live in this Universa=
l Energy together we start changes in the unseen world and it then, it ti=
me, becomes seen.  All things start in mind before they become reality.  =
Just think about it and you will see how.  **********We can turn this pla=
net into one that promotes everyone=92s best interest and we can learn as=
 a race to Respect other people, Live in Peace together, have Brotherly L=
ove, and establish Unity within the Community.  This DREAM lies in your a=
nd mine hands.  This DREAM is glorious and beauty-full. Remember it mostl=
y starts with us and the influence and impact we can make on other=92s by=
 living, being, and practicing PLUR as constantly as possible.  We gather=
 strength in it as we meet others like ourselves and in the energy we sha=
re as ONE together.  One day long ago before I knew about House and Raves=
 somebody somewhere envisioned Raves and parties promoting Positivity and=
 re-establishing brotherly love and it happened.  Their DREAM realized, t=
hought creating reality.  That DREAM affected my live and showed me how m=
y life was unfulfilled and incomplete in the world of violence I had been=
 living.  The vibe at the party changed me; the invisible unseen energy c=
reated by all the kids who were there for that reason.  =

=0D
No one had to verbally tell me anything of what it was about, for the com=
munications being recieved by me was much deeper than words could convey,=
 for it communicated str8 to my heart.  House is a beauti-full thing and =
when it hits you it changes the person you are but only in a better and h=
igher consciousness.  We can=92t talk about House in words for they are s=
o limited and incomplete to express what it is.  So I write this now to h=
elp re-establish True House again and encourage all you beautiful kids to=
 keep trying and struggling towards this wonder-full goal of House and PL=
UR.  It take people like me and you, wherever we=92re at, doing what we c=
an.  All that is required is that you do your best.  We aren=92t all perf=
ect ,as some think they are, and for many it=92s something new so we all =
fall at first at trying something new but don=92t be discouraged by it. =

=0D
 I say re-establish House because I feel House has started to be forgotte=
n and that=92s the True  reason parties started.  It has turned way mains=
tream, and as it has many numbers have come in and much of the PLUR and H=
OUSE left.  This is sad and we can=92t let it.  We must dream, do, create=
, and believe in the HOUSE or DREAM, for it will manifest strong(er) agai=
n and spread out to the world around us.  Our thoughts and emotions creat=
e just as the kids at my first party thoughts and emotions came into me a=
nd showed me the beauty of HOUSE and BROTHERLY LOVE; they touched my hear=
t in a most positive way, and I=92m thankful for it now.  Please don=92t =
let this great and beauti-full dream fade away into the sunset.  This pla=
net and the people here need it to much for it to be lost.  I feel in a w=
ay the fate of the world depends on it for where else is something like t=
his happening; true there=92s people doing good out there but not on the =
scale we can take it.  We are here now together connected to each other b=
y what is the same inside us all regardless of race, creed, religion or s=
mall differences on a grander scale; that is we are a part of  the same S=
ource.  Our beings within us are One by the One Creator who made us all. =
 This Creator (call Him/Her what you want for He/She is the same Being wi=
th many names) is same One Parent of all of us.  Our Common Creator looks=
 at us all as children and in a loving, forgiving and caring way any idea=
l Parent would look at His/Her Creation.  We are all special and Divine c=
reatures for how could we not be if God is our Creator.  The Creator is t=
he Source of all Life for God is Life, Love, and Light.  The One Father i=
s Mind and Energy and we are the manifestation of it.  As all having a co=
mmon heritage (spiritual and mental) we when at-tune or when at-one-ment =
we share the same Being the same Source.  This is who we truly are beauti=
ful and radiant children of God.  Since we are more than one person here =
when we realize our Divine Kinship we then become a Tribe.  A Tribe know =
how to work and live together in PLUR or it fails and dies.  We can chang=
e it all by becoming ONE SOURCE TRIBE.  We aren=92t connected by outside =
physical structure but by the internal One structure.  We understand the =
truth of who and what we are and live according to our hearts and our hig=
hest consciousness  which is all tapped into the same Source.  We underst=
and that mankind is the child of the One Divine Mind, and we live in harm=
ony with this knowledge and kinship we all share as children.  The unifyi=
ng force of this all is PLUR.  We also know and respect the Law of Give a=
nd Receive/Law of Cause and Effect/Karma.  Even if we were selfish and di=
dn=92t want to do this it would be in our best interest for what you do u=
nto others is done unto you.  Let us realize our kinship in the Source an=
d begin to live as Tribes of  Old did, and all work for the betterment of=
 the One SourceTribe to its highest and best good.  Start NOW(is theonly =
real time that Truly exists.) =

**********One last note I would like to give props and thanks to all the =
kids who ahve been following this dream.  You are all so beauti-full and =
 wonder-full have affected my life deeply.  I especially want to give tha=
nks to all the fore-fathers of this scene (DREAM) and to all the people w=

SOLUTION TO THE STATE OF THE WORLD
=0D
There=92s so many problems around us today.  It=92s frustrating and depre=
ssing to say the least.  To try to overtake or fix the many problems wher=
e can and do you start at.  In reality we can=92t take on all these immen=
se problems we see around us, for they are to large, and our lives requir=
e to much for us to give the focus to the time and attention needed.   =

=0D
There is a possible solution to the problems of the world and a way to a =
happier existence.  It=92s not a new message but a new delivery of it.  T=
he solution starts with You and then goes to Us. We cannot change everyth=
ing around us for it simply won=92t, but we can change ourselves.  We can=
 grow and become the best people we can be which in turn has an affect on=
 all things around us.  People are affected by those around them whether =
it=92s positive or negative and nowadays it=92s mostly negative.  Most pe=
ople live in so much fear of everything around them.  Fear only paralyzes=
 us and makes things worse (remember the saying frozen with fear).  That=92=
s what=92s happening.  We are focusing to much on the bad things and the =
problems which only magnifies them.  What we need to do is start to focus=
 on positive changes and solutions; how this  starts is with each individ=
ual person.  =

=0D
We must do our best to have a positive attitude and start practicing Peac=
e, Love, Unity and Respect.  PLUR.  As we do this it starts to be created=
 and as it is created it then becomes reality.  How things become created=
 is with our thoughts and emotions.  They provide the blueprint for the r=
eality we live and see.  This is happening  whether people are aware of i=
t or not just as many things are happening everyday without people=92s aw=
areness of it.  Your thoughts and emotions become your experiences (fears=
/negative as well as faith/positives).  We are responsible for our own fa=
te in that what we think, the attitudes and prejudices we hold, and how w=
e treat ourselves and other=92s.  These are infinitely reflected back to =
us.  =

=0D
Most don=92t realize this but as you show them the see it because they ar=
e thousands of examples and demonstrations in our lives on how this is do=
ne (a sick man=92s thoughts are on his sickness, while a poor man=92s tho=
ughts are on what he doesn=92t have) all manifested as they are feed into=
 the creating energy of the universe.  Just look at your own life and try=
 to see it such as something you always wanted and strive so hard to get =
did you not receive it, and if not, most times later you find out it was =
better that you probably didn=92t get it.  To take it to the next step ou=
r thoughts as a whole (every person) then collectively creates our societ=
y we live in.  Each person contributes to society and nation as each indi=
vidual life of each cell of the body contributes to the whole of  who you=
 are.  If there is a problem we see around us individually or as a societ=
y we must look to ourselves as the cause of it.  Many don=92t like to thi=
nk this way because they want to point fingers at others and say no it=92=
s them over there.  Well it=92s time to wake up for we all are doing it t=
ogether.  Maybe we didn=92t even create it but we are accepting it and no=
t doing anything about it.  If we are doing this then we are allowing it =
to stand and supporting that which we don=92t like around us.  The proble=
m is we have been focusing to much outwards to fix the problems but the r=
eal answers lies inward (with-in us).  =

=0D
What=92s this answer you say?  It=92s so simple and yet so complex.  We c=
an become better people and strive to live PLUR in our everyday lives, an=
d then we can make changes around us by own living and being.  We extend =
and spread out our vibe to those around and if it=92s positive then it=92=
s returned to us and if it=92s negative it=92s also returned to us.  It w=
as once said long ago =93Do unto others as you would have them do unto yo=
u=94  If we all truly practiced this in our everyday lives, IMAGINE where=
 our society and the race of man would be right now.  We would be much fu=
rther evolved in spirit and mind and we wouldn=92t have most of the probl=
ems we are all facing as we look out around us now and see our future ahe=
ad of us.  =

=0D
We are constantly creating our life around us with our thoughts and emoti=
ons are feeding into some unseen energy ,which then responds to and produ=
ces visible results which we see and live as reality, individually and co=
llectively.  The law of cause and effect is operating on the spiritual an=
d mental levels as well as the physical level.  The causes on these level=
s in our thoughts and emotion with life and reality the effects.  We usua=
lly don=92t relate the in-world with the out-world but they are very conn=
ected indeed.   We as a race of man just haven=92t truly understood that =
we are all interconnected with each other as our own cells in our body as=
 interconnected with each other.  Our quality of live truly does depend o=
n the quality of life of those around us and their happiness.  No man is =
an island, let us remember our interdependence and start to live in TRUTH=
=2E  We are One people, One nation, One spiritual race.  The physical is =
the least who we truly are but really the most apparent.  Since it=92s th=
e most apparent it hard to look past, but we must or else it=92s going to=
 get worse for us all.
=0D
As we live and practice love, light, and life(living) these positive ener=
gies are then returned into our lives.  This is the HOUSE and happiness w=
e all feel at a party (hopefully many of you tonight are experiencing it =
as you read this and will continue to as the night goes on).  We come to =
celebrate life, people, and love amongst each other, and we create a high=
er unity; a higher way of living and being.  We are all responsible for t=
he good time we all have because we all  add to it and create it together=
=2E  The more you give to it the better you feel.  There is a scary part =
though is it=92s not normal for this world to know what we know.  =

=0D
The world we are in practices separation and fear while we are practicing=
 love and unity.  They are now persecuting us for partying and sharing th=
e great time together we are sharing.  This is not the truth of the matte=
r.  We are light, love, and life.  We are practicing and living a better =
way of life.  We seek Truth and are living and having fun.  This is not w=
rong, but what life is really about.  What=92s the point of living if you=
 are not happy and feeling good.  This makes life exciting and makes the =
hard work of life enjoyable.  It=92s  necessary that we have fun for it i=
s healthy for us and in addition creates a better world it does this beca=
use when we are healthy and happy we do better at living, work, relations=
hips, and practice PLUR  the best.    They are trying to portray to the m=

use the media tool to convince many younger people parent=92s and the gen=

drug users.  They use the worst case scenario=92s at what can happen at a=
 party or anywhere for the matter as the rule rather than the exception. =
 =

=0D
Everywhere you look bad things are happening.  The worst killer right now=
 is alcohol, but it=92s still freely celebrating on every corner in Ameri=
ca.  We all know more people are dying from drunk driving than any other =
thing but are they covering this, No, they are covering what they don=92t=
 like and picking us out.  We are a culture(ravers) who generally speakin=
g ,are not into drinking, getting all fucked up, being depressed and hurt=
ing other ourselves or those around us.  We are about positivity and love=
=2E   They are not promoting these ideals in our culture.  All they do is=
 show the violence and problems of the world.  They teach us these things=
 as we grow up through television and movies and you learn at a young age=
 how adult=92s deal with other adults; the old fashioned way go duke it o=
ut or go to war and kill each other.  We are doing so much good for ourse=
lves and other=92s in partying, for where we are is the celebration of th=
e true individual, life, light, and love.  It=92s truly about PLUR.  Reme=
mber this as you party and stick up for who and what we are for it is rig=
ht and good.  Those that are here who are not about these things I hope y=
ou will eventually see the beauty of this and want to embrace it and cont=
ribute your part to it and see and know that is a better living than the =
old way.  This is the Future for mankind and we are the start of it.  It=92=

=0D
Know one thing, that you are right in what you are doing.  Be extremely p=
roud of who you are and what you are doing for it=92s good and righteous(=
right-use).  You are not problem but the answer and solution to the probl=
em.  If you practice a better way of thinking and living you are on the r=
ight track and the reward is so wonder-full not only for you and other=92=
s but for the world as a whole.  You are and will live a full and complet=

an empty and illusionary life.  They have no great fulfillment in Life wh=
ile everyday of our lives can be and is fulfilling as we choose it to be.=
  I have great respect and admiration for any and all who are trying to d=
o better in living and treating others.   This is not only good for those=
 around you, but it=92s the best for you.  If you haven=92t tried this wa=
y yet release your fear, stick your feet in the water(you=92ll find it=92=

it=92s so much a happier and  joyous experience of life to partake of.  =

=0D
We are all mostly here for one common reason and this is HOUSE.  We are h=
ere to have a good time, so make sure and have it, but also don=92t forge=
t about your neighbor next to you, their happiness is also interdependent=
 on yours, for it creates a higher happiness HOUSE for you to.  Let us re=
alize this Truth and contribute to other=92s happiness and help make it f=
or them; as we do, we truly make our own, for ALL IS INFINITE REFLECTION =
AND INFINITE REFLECTION IS ALL.  Our better life lies in our positive tho=
ughts and emotions and also in helping other=92s to have a better and mor=
e fulfilling life.  We all magnify and multiply each other as we do this.=
  PLUR.  When we come together as people in HOUSE  and in the spirit of u=

 one person squared =3D  1 or two person=92s squared =3D 4 or three perso=
ns cubed =3D 27 and so on.  =

=0D
This magnified number value is an example of the higher HOUSE AND UNITY w=

	Granted our world has been on the edge of nuclear destruction since the
60's, we're polluting the hell out of, you risk getting shot going to the
nightclub or 7 eleven, should you go for broke?

	Hell yes. 

	But, how broke do you go when you go for broke?  (you can't take it with
you..)

	All about walking that fine line...

I hear some of you have complained about plur
not being all that it is made out to be, and this has left many
disillusioned about plur and raving.

Well after much research and testing at our lunar labs we
are proud to announce the arrival of a new improved
version of PLUR ...its called PLUR + 

there are also plans to release an additional upgrade this spring
called Enhanced PLUR or plurE as it will be more commonly known as.

We hope earthlings enjoy this new PLUR ...coming soon
to a human near you . 

You can download this from any human , plant or alien that has
had the PLUR + Experience simply by hugging with a open heart.

Peace and fun to all

for most of the reasonably glossy flyers that are printed on cardstock, how
much is the duplication cost (on average)?  and how many usually get
printed up for massives?

Apparently other don't agree with you. I heard about a lot of drama at a
party he was spinning out recently.... something about him not spinning at
2 and his manager getting pissed off and wanting to push Re'Ach off the
decks?

Hey guys.

I had a GRRREAT time at this party. It all started by meeting a bunch of
you in Fremont and then cruising over to Toofy's and planning on going to
Trancemasters. Unfortunately it got cancelled/busted. Therefore we went to
Fantasy Island instead. Lets just say that I've been DIEING to listen to
some GOOD house. What could be better for this then NYC's Frankie Bones??
I've never heard him spin (Captain Crunch.... sigh) and was looking
forward to it. So we all went down there and partied.... it was a blast. I
met so many cool people... and ran into someone I met at another party....
someone who I grooved with during the last hour or so... to the
beautiful house music... it was NICE. :) I will definately
see her again. soon... Unfortunately I missed Jeno's set... for some
reason I thought he was going to be in the main room?? Too bad for me.. I
walked into the saide room 5 minutes after he finished his set.... aaah...

Hugs to all the new SFravers I met....  especial huggles to Toofy... for
picking me up and taken me out.. when I thought I was going to have a
Blockbuster night. Thanks so much. Friends are the best.

Then we went to the after party... at DeepFogs... it was a nice way to
adapt to the world again after partying all night.....   but would have
been even nicer... would have been to crawl into an oxygen take and sleep
for the next 12-18 hours... :) I could use that right now in fact. Anyone
got one I can borrow.. ha-ha..

Well.. it was a nice weekend.... see you guys soon.

kinda disenchanted when I read about that...

Thanks Jer!

Hey all = )

okay before i start this one out I just want to let you know that this isn't a
its more of a general observation and maybe it might generate a response.

Let me also clear up a few things tp preempt a couple of arguments
No I don't have a homepage and I could'nt do it better b/c 
1. general boycott of homepages that suck (and mine would suck)
2. I can think of 100 different other things i would rather do than code HTML
   and reloading my page with different resolutions and browsers to make sure 
   it looks okay.
3. My html coding skillz are way below average so please refer back to #1

now with that out of the way lets move on shall we ? = )

Has anyone else noticed that all there party crews and organizations (for lack 
of a better term) have home/web pages but they haven't been updated in months
and in some cases years. The worst being in a state of permanent construction.

Some are cool anyways cuz you get pics and bios about the crew and what they
represent but others just are promoting some party from 96 without any
real information. 

This again really doesn't bother me cuz I know how much I hate to write html
and I know others must share my frustration, (here comes the big BUTT = ) )
But, I am constantly seeing flyers with url's for there homepages and they
are static, having the same stuff ....

So is this really a gripe? No not really like i said more of a general
observation maybe with a little hope that someone will see/read this 
and maybe take a little initiative and update their page(s).  You know like a 
once a month update or something.

A lot of times i have got nuthin better to do that to waste away buring my
retinas with netscape, and a new fresh page about an upcoming party
or pics / reviews of their last party would be nice.

well I think i have work to do...

hugz,

herb

Hope I don't sound dumb for asking -- what's the right front speaker
family?  I love Sarah Mclachlan, so I'm sure I'll be going.

Herby,

I can't agree with you more man. I've even offered to maintain some of
these sites... the people seem interested but hell of lag.. so I give up.
Krom and I were talking about this on Saturday night..... The web is a
very useful and inexpensive resource.... I think more and more should be
done online... save dem trees.

Byroni

ps. I CCed the list on purpose!

Hey All,

I've been kinda hesitant to do this (it's nice having an uncrowded store to 
shop in) but my concience has gotten the better of me...

Aaron Shen (formerly did all the import ordering for BPM) has opened his 
own store.  It's called "Clear" and its on Valencia, just off of Division. 
 Make a right on Valencia as you're coming up the hill towards Market 
street.  It's on your right about 1/2 block down.

The place is really nice -- lots of space, lots of _good no-nonsense 
house_, and Aaron is probably the most accomodating store owner you can 
find.

Anyhow, he hasn't done a whole lot of promotion of the store, and I just 
want to see that it stays around for everyone to take advantage of.  So 
check it out.  His phone number is (415) 437-1578 if you wanna give the 
store a call.

BTW, I have no affiliation with Clear -- just figured that getting the word 
out would only help everyone in the long run.

-- Oliver

there's incredible potential for a stateside web agency like Obsolete 
(www.obsolete.com) to come along and create a steady income based solely 
around developing and maintining sites for promoters, clubs, djs, record 
labels, artists, etc. Now's the time to do it since the popularity of 
both internet and rave culture have never been higher, or more 
mainstreamed.
Needless to say that techno style and that techno aesthetic are pretty 
popular right now, so you can make money *and* still win design awards 
for your sites. =)

I've been thinking of how to create a web agency with a niche in the rave 
market for over a couple years now and am about ready to go off and do it 
just because noone else has yet, other than Obsolete -- but they're in 
the UK....If done correctly it can be fun and profitable to produce small 
sites like the ones promoters/clubs need, and then set up maintenance 
contracts to udate the site monthly and then redesign every few months. 

If there's anyone out there like Vitamin B from soda.berkeley.edu who's 
got web agency experience and would like to actually embark on such a 
venture, by all means send me mail!

(But I live back in Colorado now, not in SF any longer, by the way)

BTW, be sure and check out Obsolete if you haven't yet...Best thing this 
side (other side, actually) of Hyperreal...

***

well princess, in an attempt to avoid stinking... I think I will have to lay down a bit of info on myself instead, which I havent' done yet [and seems to be the accepted thing to do].  


I *have*  posted a few times, and had a pretty good thread with Leslie on the whole love issue...  I try to keep my opinions/advice to myself, unless queried.  

My opening statement: I guess I am more or less a remote form of raver.


I have a deep passion for dancing, and cannot put/find enough of the music into my tremblin' earballs...  I don't get a chance to go to as many parties as I would like...  the amount of work I do(14/6), and lack of decent pay [kind of a favor I'm working on 2 yrs now for my best friend known 23yrs] at our Sacramento ISP keep me rather tied up (which *can* be good, but not at work).


The parties I have been to are primarily in Sac.  I usually just lose myself in the vibe and dance til' it's over, or i just cant go on.  Dj Dan has killed me, besides being the only dj I can really remember having actually heard and remembered.  The names aren't as important to me... it's the  vibe of the partiers, and if the Dj can keep  me up dancing.. they rule.  It's not me out there, it's them.. and I give  props to all for being my source.  


I have been killing myself for many years (brn liqr alcoholic) and dancing has been my way of kicking that shite for a while now.  My addiction has luckily kept me from becoming hooked on any other of the plethora of crap I've put in me.  I am a thinker, a story teller (long-winded), and an artist/writer (recreational).  I love the outdoors, hockey, my dog, and my friends.  Ex-Navy medical, Ex-marriage, Ex-trodinarily nice.


Met some *wonderful* peeps @ Burning Man this year [great mixes out there this year!] including Steve-O, Ahnon, and Rob.. [sf based] who encouraged me to get on sfraves.  Steve-O spins, but can't remember if I caught his turning there. I do remember a good friend of mine [sfraves list memb./davis based] RJ Briggs's set...  


Story: We had been waiting for him to show up from Santa Cruz and meet us... I walked over to the Faux-Est and no one was dancing... the mix was kickin' so I got right out in the middle of it, and started doing my thing... "Sol!" I hear...  I looked up into the tower... and there was RJ.. had just pulled in...and climbed up for a set.  "RJ!" I yelled back giving him air huggers... "I'll go get the crew!" I ran back and collected my troupe and they all jumped up and hustled over to the site.  RJ had a great set, mixin' in some jazz/horns [something familiar, cant remember] with our crew out there dancing, getting RJ revved up... soon there was hardly any open spots to dance.  Love that guy. 


Could go on forever, but gettin' kind of long here... other music: celtic, jazz, blues, ska, regge, oldies... well, actually I listen and enjoy all types of music... except most rap and country [I just cant dance to it].


Working on a flyer... http://www.deepwell.com/~balanced comments appreciated [my first].


Thanks for letting me vent...PLUR, elbow grease for peace... huggers n' shooga to all.

to be honest after rereading that post i was a little embarrased - it
didn't seem as clever as i thought it was when i posted.  what can i
say, i was sort of "feeling the spirit" when i wrote it.  however, i'd
like to take this opportunity to calmly restate the main points of
that post, which were, basically:

1. don't let it's legality and ease of purchase fool you: ephedrine is
speed.  

2. if you don't take it all the time, it works pretty well, at least
well enough to keep you up till the end of the party.  if i haven't
taken it in a while, it actually gets me pretty pumped up.

3. it may not be good for you, but it is definately much much better
for you than crystal meth.  

but of course it doesn't have that "i'm cool because i do hard drugs"
mystique like crank does.

- messiah wannabe


ps.  i say some "just say know" fliers for the first time this
weekend.  i thought the graphic design work was really cool (also the
info seemed pretty useful, although i thought the techno-babble might
be kind of hard to wade through if you were high on drugs...)

No, it is not. While it has somewhat similar effects, and is often used in
the manufacture of (meth)amphetamines, it is not the same thing. Please,
don't spread this kind of disinformation.

Ok, it ain't speed, but it does cause the same effect in the brain, from
what I can tell, that of increasing nor-adrenaline or nor-epinephrine.

I tried Khat, and before chewing was greatly sceptical, looked like a
*very* silly way to take drugs to me. But wow! It really did the trick.

>From the info in the drugs archive, the key thing here is cathinone, and
whether it be cathinone or amphetamine, or meth-cathonone from
pseudo-ephedrine, how it *feels* is the same. 

>From what the person says here, the fact he was off-on-one meant,
surely, the effects 'do the job'.

I also think that 2cb and acid and mushrooms all same the feel to me,
but that would do doubt cause a *mass* of threadage.

Has anyone heard of NO TV at 1015 Folsom.  Tonight is its first night, and
it looks like they're trying something different.  From what I understand,
the tunes are going to progressively change from ambient to down tempo to
house all set in a kick-back environment?  Maybe I'll see some of you
there.

tootaloo,
george

			Hi everyone-

	We just redid our tape traders page...we added two new major
areas...
1. "Check your trqade stats"  this page is for those who we are currently
doing trades with...they can check to see if we are still copying tapes,
ready to mail you your tapes, waiting for info from you, etc.
2. A message board for people to trade tapes, write reviews of tapes, and
even for dj's to advertise their new tapes!!

Check it out and let us know what you think...=)

under this definition, coffee is speed.   ephedrine is about as useful
as coffee for speeding you up.  once you take more than a certain
amount you get way jittery and it is very unpleasant.

Hi all!

don't know if anyone's ever posted anything about this, so excuz if so:

have read that one of the things E does is deplete seratonin levels in the
brain. this is what gives some that washed-out, kind of depressed feeling
after a night of partying. long-term, depleted levels of seratonin have been
shown to lead to bad stuff (severe depression, sleep disorders, etc.).

 I decided to do a little medical experiment on myself based on the above
(and a friend joined me, purely of her own free will I might add). I went to
a health food store and asked if their was any food suppliment that could
counteract seratonin loss. Guy immediatly told me about tryptophan (full name
5-hydroxy l-tryptophan or 5-htp) an amino acid that occurs naturally in some
foods (it's the stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy). 5-htp is the
immediate precursor to seratonin production. 

So anyway we took a couple of these babies on Sunday as we were coming down
after a complete night of dancing (weee!) and indulging. The difference for
both of us was really wild. felt much more alert and happy than usual, almost
complete lack of the normal edginess, and just generally more at peace with
the world. When i ended up getting to bed around 2:00 i almost instantly fell
blissfully asleep. my friend kelly also had the same reaction. 

i know this is completely unscientific and the placebo effect could always be
a factor. but I also know my body pretty well and it had never felt this good
after a serious night like this one. 

let me know if anyone else has tried it.

PLUR++,

brian

p.s. i have nothing to do with any entity that could profit from this stuff.
purely a public service.

It sounds great until you realize there's really not enough money there to
sustain a business on it.  Obsolete doesn't make any money from the record
label sites they do; it's a showcase for their
look-we-can-ape-designers-republic -better-than-anyone design talents, as a
lead-in to more profitable work for companies like Levi's.  

It's much more cost effective for these groups to follow the DIY model and
build their own sites and develop in-house web skills; e.g. WarpMart.  I
think it's a safe bet that if a rave promoter isn't updating his web site
once every couple of months, they're probably not going to pay to have
someone else do it.  Spoken from bitter experience. :)

I'm in the UK, but we've had some speed that's been coloured (I kid you
not) Pink! It really had a much more different effect than the white
base speed I get now, far 'warmer'. My guess was that it was meth, and
the colouring was to differentiate it from other speed. Other people
spoke highly of it as well. It's also called 'Pink shampagne'. Later, I
got hold of small bright red round tablets, which I guessed was the
speed without filler. This was really nice.

I'd like to try, and make some meth-cathinone from pseudo-ephedrine from
sudafed, though.

Yours Nick

for the Trouble on Vinyl tour, and can give me a ride from Menlo Park up
to the City, I can offer you THIS in return:

--your cover at VSF paid by me
or
--getting into Club Dread at the Endup for free for Cosmic Vibe Massive
(Billy Culture and LUD) meets Jah Love Universal Sounds (this goes until
4am)


That's how bad I need a ride to the City.  I'm tired of sleeping in the
transbay bus terminal waiting for the 7F to start going south again, seen?

Email me or give me a call 415/854 6730, and leave a message.

Yeh, I heard about that whole mix up.  I think that everyone should
understand that Greg (Kid Bippy) was totally understanding and way cool
through the whole thing.  He is the nicest guy around and he really did put
up with a lot of crap that night.  His "drunken asshole manager" was being
completly out of line and I will in no way condone what he did.. but he was
just trying to look out for a friend, in his own messed up way.  We might not
agree with the way that he went about things but we should try to understand
that he was just trying to help out Greg.

argh, why did i start this silly-named thread going again?  oh well.

> under this definition, coffee is speed.

well, can you think of any reason (besides the maxwell house
lobbyists) why coffee isn't considered speed?  certainly the effects
are pretty much the same.  i consider coffee a drug, same as alcohol,
marijuana, mushrooms, or any other organic mind altering substance.

>   ephedrine is about as useful
> as coffee for speeding you up.  once you take more than a certain
> amount you get way jittery and it is very unpleasant. 
> 

well, actually i think ephedrine is quite a bit stronger than coffee.

but mostly i guess this is the point i miserably failed to get across
on my original post:  

i probably went through the same usage patterns with ephidrine as most
people when a friend turned me on to it so many years ago.  first i
took one or two to study or maybe just for kicks, i can't remember
which.  then i started taking it frequently.  then it stopped working
so well.  then i tried taking a handfull of them (well like 12 anyway)
and it sucked.  then i stopped taking them for years.  "kid stuff"  i
thought "don't like it a bit".  then, years later, i rediscovered it. 
and after spending years of effort finding some sort of balance and
sustainability as a dedicated drug enthusiast, i tried using the stuff
like i would any other drug - avoiding continual use so as not to
build up tolerance, for instance.  suddenly, i had a new drug in my
pallete of indulgences, one that had similar effects as meth,
admitedly a good bit weaker (but i don't consider that a fault) and
without the unpleasant side effects, which i dislike intensely.  it
filled a need for me, because i like to dance all night as often as
possible, but don't like to take hallucinogens every weekend - i think
its bad for your brain to take that sort of substance too often,
especially when you've been doing drugs as long as i have.  i know
people tend to write minithins off because they're legal and easily
obtained and therefore contain absolutely no "street cred" but i for
one find the stuff quite useful for those very reasons.

jesus, how did i wind up talking about friggin' minithins again?  does
anyone know where i can score some 2CB?

If I could waste everyones time really quick...I'd like to make some comments
on the whole situation.  I think that there was a lot of facts left out when
the story was told the first time and I just wanted to clear some stuff up.
 Greg (Kid Bippy) is a resident Sac DJ.  We all love him and we love to have
some talent in our boring little city! :)  He agreed to spin at *Play Nice*
as a favor to Jenny and Nichole and because of the fact that it was for a
children's chairity.  He had plans to spin at Life Force the night before and
he turned down a paying job to drive 4 hours to Monterey.  He unfortunatly
was not able to get any sleep the night before because he had a late spot at
Life Force and he had stuff to do the next day.  He drove up to Monterey to
spin and he was nothing less than pooped :-)!  He was told that he was
spinning @ 1 but when the sound showed up late, he was told that he would be
spinning a lot later than intended.  He understood this and was very cool
about it.  It was his manajor that would not accept it.  He handled himself
very poorly but he was drunk and a little upset.  Something that I wanted
everyone to understand is that the fight was never about "peek hours" it was
about Greg having to drive 4 hours home after getting no sleep the night
before.  He was tired and worn out and yet he still took it all like a
trooper!  (that is more than I could say for me because I am a Grinch when
I'm tired :) hehehe!!!)  Greg didn't care when he went on, he offered to stay
later.  Once he went on, he was teased and mocked by some of the other DJ's.
 (way un-cool if you ask me :-P)  He was made fun of for playing an
old-school set... I LOVE OLD SCHOOL!!
Oh well, we are all going to have our opinions on the whole ordeal but I just
wanted those of you that didn't know all the facts to be a little more
informed :)  I didn't want anyone to have to miss out on a great DJ because
of a misunderstanding.  

   Sorry for bringing up old business!  It was just something that I had to
get off my chest.  To anyone that now hates Mikey (Kid Bippy's manager); he
really isn't that bad...you just have to get to know him!  He was attempting
to stick up for a friend and I do respect that!  

     If anyone is still unclear about any of the happenings at *Play Nice*
feel free to post and ask me or you can e-mail me privately.  You could ask
Nichole too I'm sure, she actually knows everything first hand!  Thanks for
reading this, I know it was long!

                                       XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX
                                         Hugs and Sloppy Kisses-
                                       ~*~ the Glitter Princess ~*~

P.S.  Thanks to Byroni for asking.  I really wanted to say all of that but so
much time had past and I thought that everyone had forgotten, obviously they
haven't :)

Thanks to Jer for sticking up for Bippy, he isn't signed up and he can't
stick up for himself!

Thanks to Nichole for being such a great friend and for having such a great
passion for the truth!  I love you!  To put it in your words; you are
"fresh-ass"!!

  Hey Sfravers, yet again this Wednesday evenning there will be another 
dj at my coffee shop (weather permitting, I'm sure).  I have no idea who 
it is, but, well actually I'm going to say I do, but it is a surprise  
:P (I have no clue)  
  But there will be a good dj as there always is.  And guess what?  I'll 
be able to hang with all of you :)  Yeah!! and I wont be in a cancerian 
mood  :)  Yeah!!  Because I wont be working,, Yeah!!           However, 
there is some dissappointing news:( Too many people have been hanging 
around in the parking lot :( Mgt, Residents of the apts. that live above 
us and many others have been complaining about not being able to drive 
by without "running those freaks over" :(  If we can all try to find a 
seat inside the shop, buy a coffee and socialize inside or outside at 
the tables and prove to society that we are not freaks, everyone would 
appreciate it  :)  Also, please remember that this is NOT A RAVE :( it 
is a coffee shop  :) please leave illicit substances at home with your 
cat or dog  :) they would probably enjoy them more  :P

City Espresso 5237 Stevens Crk Blvd, Santa CLara, something, something
408-248-4500
  

  Other than that we hope to see you all with a cup o' coffee and a good 
heart on Wed.
And don't forget to bring your...

Well, my main question here, which leads me to be very skeptical of your

 so, you can't just "pop into a local health food store" and buy some -- so
was it really tryptophan that you were taking, or just some hokey bunk stuff
that this guy was trying to sell you just to make a buck.??

I just got back from Vegas so sorry for the late reply but, 
I can't agree more. The music sucked and I mean it was real bad.
I thought Kit Kat used to be bomb (two years ago),its revival leaves a
lot to be desired. Sorry, Gardner but you need some better D.J.'s!!!

L-Tryptophan is the precursor to 5-htp.  So when you take 5-htp, it is
actually a step closer to seratonin than tryptophan.  5-htp is a natural
substance (one brand is made from seeds) for purposes of FDA regulation.
Typtophan was banned due to some contaminates in a synthetic batch, but
5-htp is a different substance.  5-htp is superior to tryptophan in some
ways.  You generally have to take much less 5-htp for the same effect as a
larger amount of tryptophan.   It does have a few drawbacks such as
"gastrointestinal distress."

I saw a reference to a study that showed that taking tryptophan
before E potentiated the effect.  Anyone try this with 5-htp?

WOW!!  Raise your hand if you think Kid Bippy's manager is a drunken
asshole.
C'mon now kids.  Everyone makes drunk scenes every once in a
while, besides like you guys said (after calling him an asshole)- he
was just sticking up for a friend, and that's done and over with now.
Anyway - Greg and Mikey are both really nice guys - nuff said.

Bye4Now - Jen.

                      There's only ONE thing to do--throw a party!

     What's a Love Dodge?  A romantic evasion?  NO!  
     It's a recreational vehicle!  
      (http://woods.bianca.com/shacklet/on_the_road/love_dodge.html) 

      The epic battle between bianca's loyal Love Dodge and the
                          e-vileness of the 

    <sinister theme>         BUZZARD MAN        </sinister theme>

      occurred on the international Summer of Smut tour this year
 and the damages incurred have neccessitated this weekend's festivities.

        So we have to throw a party, but hey, that's the bad news!  
   The good news happens all Saturday night and here are the details:

 You may have virtually enjoyed yourself and others at the world     __ 
famous website (www.bianca.com), or in the physical manifestation  //  \\
    of the Shack at Burning Man or the recent Art Car West Fest   //    \\

you enjoy a great party, bianca Wants you there October 11      //        \\
   See bianca's love in the eyes of her loyal trolls and taste //__________\\
it in the grilled cheese which issues from the                /| ---------- |\
 two-headed troll chef.  You will hear the gloried sound of    || bianca's ||
 smut in the irresistable freeform'd music which you cannot    ||Smut Shack||
   resist and you will smell smut all around you.              ||  ______  ||
      Bring bianca your love and your love will be returned.   ||  |(--)|  ||
    Hell, you'll probably get a whole lotta love even if       ||__||__||__||
  you're feeling crabby.  So come on down!                     (------------)
 
 A:  October 11th SOMAR Gallery 934 Brannan St.(@ 8th) in San Francisco.
     More info at:       http://www.bianca.com/biancafit/

                                    with the words:   subscribe biancafit
     as the body of the letter.

 Will we be raising the price of grilled cheese for the biancafit?  In
 bianca's world all grilled cheeses are FREE (and endless).  And good for
              you.  Grilled Cheese is like catnip for humans.

   bianca is well-nigh synonymous with a good time.  We are hoping to
      someday achieve full-synonymity.  If you could start saying,
      'Wow!  I'm really having a bianca tonight'  that would help.


                      BAD   =  buzzard man wants you.

                      GOOD  =  bianca loves you.

if Mikey acted as he did at a bar, sure, that's understandable, but if
he's drinking and doesn't know how to control himself or act and is at a
rave, that's totally uncool! it's not what raving is all about.... mikey
pissed off and made a lot of people upset. it's not "you guys" who said
it, "you guys" is refering to the list as a whole, it was pretty much me
who called him a drunken asshole, and that's what he was acting like. I
don't know mikey too well when he's sober, but from what I've heard from
lots of people, he's an sober asshole too!.

Bye4Now - Jer.

Seeing how I kinda feel responsible for this thread I would like to make one 
last comment.

Granted his manager was drunk but that does not excuse some of his behavior that
night.  Second he (k.b. for short) might be a nice guy but while his manager 
was reaming everyone he just stood there quietly not saying a thing.  He 
could have tried to talk to him or settle him down or say "hey its okay"
but he did not as well.  I don't think a lot of people made very clear 
choices that night so its okay.

Second issue i want to discuss is old school.  Who ever got that idea that
anyone here doesn't like old school is wrong.  Its just that I heard it
every weekend for 2 years and so did a lot of people. I know that some of
the music is new to you and thats great. I am happy that you are finally getting
to hear some bomb ass tunes.   But there are a lot of us who don't want to
hear an entire set of nothing but old school.  This was my complaint. Also
driving all day/night does tend to make you cranky and irritable, just 
ask a group pf kids(DJ's) who drove to oregon after one party only to spin at
another.

Another thing that it is great for you to support you local scene and its
DJ's and I commend you on that as well.  But before you truly decide that
Kid Bippy is your man ask yourself this question.

Why do I like kid bippy so much?

Is it b/c he is a nice guy and local?
This i will grant you because I don't know him personally. And its always nice 
to have a local dj that you can claim as your own.

Is it b/c of the music he spins?
He is spinning music 4-5 years old.  If it is the music then what about all the
DJ's now who and progressed onto other music.  4-5 years ago they were
spinning this stuff but you do not consider them as some of your more favorite
dj's.

Is it b/c he has talent?
I watched him spin and he has some basic mixing skills.  I can see him improving
a lot with lots of practice.  I think that spinning music thats not old school
would help out a lot with his mixing skills.

Is it b/c he has been around.
This i couldn't tell you for sure.  The first time I saw his name was the
2nd planet rock for which I didn't go to b/c I was at 4x4.  That was jsut two
months ago so to me is his fresh in the scene.  Is this necessarily bad no.

If After asking yourselves this question and honestly answer it, you can say
that K.B. is your favorite DJ, then who am I to say any different. Support him
as much as you can.  

But I 
recommend going to a party and really listen to some of the other DJ's out
there before deciding.  You would be amazed at all the talent out there.

As for the K.B. is the next DJ Dan. its obviously you have never really 
heard DJ Dan spin and its possible you haven't heard either one.


humbly,

herb

HEY I really don't even know why people are making such a huge thing 
about it.  C'mon, as I was talking to my mom this morning she was 
talking about how old she feels, but how it can be very fascinating, and 
wonderful about all the experiences that she had been through as a human 
being.  What I started to think about  is how life is such a neat thing 
and you only live once and whew!!  I'm already 19 years old and have a 
very short time to do what I  want to do with MY life, not Kid Bippy's.

Geez!  I wasn't trying to start a heated discussion.  I just don't think
anymore mean things should be said about Mikey especially If like
you said jer. you don't know him too well- because I don't think
that talking shit about someone you don't know too well sober or not
is what raving is all about either, that's all.

sorry if I seem a tad upset over the whole thing.... but I do know who
Mikey is.... I may not know him too well, but I don't want to. I don't
believe in what he's all about and what he does. It's kinda upsetting to
find someone calling Planet Crock a rave. If you want to discuss "what
raving is all about" let do it! Planet Rock is in no way a rave at all..
it definately is not what raving is all about.... Far too many people
are losing touch with what this whole rave thing is about. It's about
the sense of community and togetherness, it's about the family, the
love, how we help each other out, and the energy we can create together.
It's about the music, the people. PLUR isn't a joke like a lot of people
treat it, it was a goal. Now with all these HUGE parties, some about
raving, some not, too many people who don't care about the scene and
what it's supposed to be about, have come along and are screwing things
up! No one is teaching them or telling them what this rave scene, is
for, or what it's about. They make up their own reasons to go to raves,
wether it be for the right reasons or wrong. Too much drug _abuse_, too
much violence, too many people who just don't care. It all is ruining
what was supposed to be one of the best things we could share!

wishing for too much, jer =)

ps. maybe someday...

oh yeah... just to clear a few things up.... I'm not perfect either, no
one is, but we all sure as hell can try to be!

Hmm, I saw no such mention to "brew up a batch" in his post, and for 
you to judge in such an immediate fashion shows that there is a 
possibility that your lack of pre-thought in constructing your post.  

(not to mention the fact that BATCH is a word only used by heavy 
users and labs...  where did you pick up that neat lingo there????)

The purpose of this thread isnt to inform governments about what 
people are doing, its purpose is to try and inform people to the best 
of my (and everyone else who participates) knowledge so that some 
lame ass doesnt come along with half-witted information and possibly 
get someone killed.  better safe than sorry... always.......

keep it positive..........see you on the flipside

Here's my question though...  This guy is _his_ manager, and although I've
never been involved in that kind of relationship I would assume that part of
his responsibility as his manager would be representing him and his wishes.  If
he was being an asshole on Greg's behalf and Greg allowed it...

Personally I had a great time at this party and liked Kid Bippy's set, but I'm
wondering why no one has brought this up.

I think that Natasha is right about tryptophan being illegal, however
there are quite a few places (ie foreign sources) that you can
purchase it and import it LEGALLY for personal use.  A good place to
start is:
"http://www.ceri.com/sources.htm", but I am sure there are tons of
others.  This site has all kinds of tasty info about ordering legally
and places to order.  Take care kiddies, and watch those seritonin
levels!

HugZ and otehr happy stuff,
sNIKers  ;^)

PHAT BINARY
digital design for the analogue underground 
650-917-1217 . shimmer@concentric.net
. web sites . streaming audio . fliers . j-cards . packaging .

I have just done a low profile launch of such an agency. I was starting 
this up on the East Coast, but just relocated and took some time out for 
a couple personal projets and to get situated on the left coast. On a 
freelance basis I did a high bandwidth site for Satellite Records with a 
shockwave interface. The demo is up at www.mediatekk.com/pure/satellite. 
I am also doing a site for Eddie Flashin' Fowlkes City Boy records. I 
have also done numerous j-cards and fliers for the east coast 
underground. Samples are up at www.mediatekk.com/pure and more at 
www.mediatekk.com/pure/rave. I can handle 4-c printing, album and 
cassette covers and inlays, as well as web hosting with audio, video, and 
commerce security. I am working on launching a web site soley for pb, and 
will announce when it goes up. Any promoters, dj's, labels interested in 
contacting me, have at it.

	A point - tryptophan was made illegal NOT because of the
substance itslef, but because it's production methods are tricky and a
few years ago there were far too many cases of people taking it to
help get to sleep or whatever getting sick and dying because of
contamination at the manufacturer even though it was purchased at
regular drug stores. I don't remember exactly what happened to you,
but do remember the issue being raised.

#1    because this is the style of  music from the  disco glory years 
when alot of people first found the rave (91-92-93)   these people are
mature now

#2   because more places that are 21+ play this kind of music.   when is
the last time you saw or heard of a 21+ night of all breakbeat and
trance?  parties that play predominantly breakbeat and techno often have
a younger crowd.

#3   most people who are older and still going out are not on speed that
much so a slower deeeper groove feels right

#4  soul and funk isn't something that you "get over" anyway. (if you
truly feel it in the first place)

#5  alot of this type of music comes from either chicago or england.     
chicago is the originator of house music( late 70's) and england was
really  heavy into house music in the eighties before everyone started
talking about "electronica".  so this type of music has history and
sophistication.   i guess you could call it mature as an art form.

#5.a   san frandisco has a bunch of dj's from england and at least one
from chicago so these people have experienced house music that many of us
have never known if we have only been paying attention to dance music for
the last 5 years or so.   

so if alot dj's in sf aren't playing the latest progressive hits from
mixmag, 
or trying in vain to mix two dat tapes full of goa,  these might be some
of the reasons  ( in my opinion of course)

HOUSE MUSIC WILL NEVER DIE

I picked up some decent "Happy Hardcore" on some Import CD's from "SU
Corporation" (aka Strictly Underground and Strictly Hardcore). I
actually got 'em real cheap in the Tower records "cutout" section in
Stonestown ('cept they no longer have a cutout section...). Some that I
recall off the top of my head are "Illegal Pirate Radio III" (1995) has
some decent H.H. and some non-intelligent (non-wimpy -- gunshots and
"boo-ya") style Jungle (2CD set)  Also picked up (import cutout again)
Rumour Records "Slammin Vinyl The Album" w/ DJ Red Alert, Mike SLammer,
Happy Tunes, and Midas.

Due to another post on this list, i now understand what that song
"Rushin' on Pink Champagne" (by Happy Tunes) is about. :-)

Course, I'm not much of a Happy Hardcore conoisseur or fan, so perhaps
some really cool into H.H. person is going to tell me I'm a clueless
loser for mentioning these CD's. (Go ahead, make my day...).

before because he had a late spot at Life Force and he had stuff to do the

spin and he was nothing less than pooped :-)>>

This has nothing to do with the fact that he and his 'manager' acted
foolishly. He knew how far Sac is from Monterrey, right? No one forced any of
the DJ's to go to the party. If he was that concerned about being tired maybe
he should have called ahead and not played at the party.

>>He was told that he was spinning @ 1 but when the sound showed up late, he
was told that he would be spinning a lot later than intended.>>

The same went for all of the other DJ's on the bill, and no one bitched that
much about it....

 >>He understood this and was very cool about it.  It was his manajor that
would not accept it.  He handled himself very poorly but he was drunk and a
little upset.>>

But his manager is representing him, so it may as well have been Mr. Bippy
yelling at Jeremy. The fact that he never stepped in to stop Mikey-wikey or
whatever meant that he felt the same about it. Mikey actually asked Re-Ach to
get off the decks. Do you think that if Re-Ach would have done that, that Mr.
Sippy would have said, "no that's OK, go ahead and finish?" I think not.

>>Something that I wanted everyone to understand is that the fight was never
about "peek hours" it was about Greg having to drive 4 hours home after
getting no sleep the night before.<<

Like I said earlier, he knew where the party was when he agreed to do it, so
what's with the primadonna attitude?

>>Greg didn't care when he went on, he offered to stay later.>>

Is that why he ended Re-Ach's last track a few minutes earlier than Re-Ach
asked him to, and then played an extra half an hour longer than he was
supposed to?

>>Once he went on, he was teased and mocked by some of the other DJ's.>>

Correction. he was 'teased and mocked' by one other DJ. That was me. I've
never done anything like that before, and I hope to never have to again. I've
had a lot of experiences in this DJ game, and I've had the pleasure of
handing the decks over to all kinds of people, from Garth to Afrika Bambaataa
and many more in between, and I have never seen such a display of straight-up
DJ bullshit. And then to get on the decks and exhibit no skills(IMO) and dis
a friend on top of it? Please. I felt like someone should've really let this
guy know he needed to check himself. I guess that was part of my job that
night.

>>Sorry for bringing up old business!  It was just something that I had to
get off my chest.  To anyone that now hates Mikey (Kid Bippy's manager); he
really isn't that bad...you just have to get to know him!  He was attempting
to stick up for a friend and I do respect that! >>

Maybe we could get Jr. Bippy and his manager online to share with us? Let's
all have a PLUR-ity fun fest together! Yeah!

Rave Ahead, dudes...

For some reason, there was a craze for pink drugs in Britain a year or two
ago.  It was supposed to signify a "special ingredient" (often ketamine)
that would distinguish it from the usual white pills.

I'll add my 2 cents now....

I've provided Management services for my clients and I am now an Agent
so I'm pretty aware of what it entails. But I also have to say I didn't
attend this party, just typing based upon what I've read so don't get
pissed if I'm a little off the mark.

I have never had a reason to be a bitch in public to anyone about the
way my clients have been treated. There is always a diplomatic way to
handle a situation.  We always want to remain professional.  Don't get
me wrong, if I have to give someone a piece of my mind, I'll do it and
do it well, but in a relatively private setting if possible. If the
other party refuses to comply, then my client and I calmly leave or we
can work out a way to get through whatever it is we are working on, but
we then NEVER work with that venue/person/group again! As their
representative, I also grant my clints the courtesy that I'll remain
sober so that if anything happens I'll be able to handle it. It sounds
to me that this manager of Kid Bippy's is either unclear on the concept
of his job or maybe made an agreement with his client that he was going
to party that night and mixed job with fun when a situation needed his
attention.....I agree with Beth, Greg gave his manager the freedom to
act in the manner he did, so it sounds like Greg doesn't know what his
managers' actions could do to his 'career' if that's what he's looking
for.  From the looks of the discussion here, it garnered quite a bit of
attention, not at all positive.  He's supposed to make Greg look GOOD,
not like some prissy DJ who needs a babysitter. Godd thing Greg has
friends who are willing to stick up for him and vouch for his
character.  His manager didn't do him any favors.

Anyway.....
Melissa

Every once in awhile, me and my boyz Slider and Duker get in the mood
for  a hardcore tweak-athon, so we pile in the ole Mustang with a bottle
of Jack and let the bass kick out the speakers, then we head on down to 
San Bernadino 
county to Jed Carter's Farm.

Jed Carter is the spacey old man who lives way out in the boondocks,
and every week he makes up a fresh batch of bathtub meth.  Sometimes
he does it when he's drunk and he'll end up collapsing a lung from 
breathing the chemicals, or setting hisself on fire, but most of 
the time his stuff is safe enough so we don't end up in the hospital.

Well, me and the boyz was pretty drunk by the time we got to the farm,
and we was all hollering,  "Hey Jed, we need lines of meth! Make us 
lines
of meth!"

So old Jed was agreeable, and told us to come back in an hour.  So we 
went into 
town and passed the time by slashing tires in the parking lot at
the town liberry; and then went back to Jed's Farm at the appointed
time.

Jed had this nasty old pile of powder for us, and we snorted it right
up the old snoot-hole, and MAAAAN did it burn!  Me and Slider and
Duke was hopping around with tears in our eyes, cussing and howling like
we was drunken sailors.

So we hopped in the old Mustang and headed up the interstate, and next 
thing I knew
the roof blew off the top of the car, and all the stars in the sky 
started 
turning purple and melting out of the sky.

"Gaw-jeez!"  I shouted, and next thing I knew, I woke up in the 
hospital.
I'd been in a coma damn near 6 weeks.  My boy Slider was sitting there
in a wheelchair, staring out the winder like a dummy, and my boy Duke 
was hooked up to life support drooling all over his self.

It took me weeks to recover, and even then my head was still screwed on 
back
asswards.  A couple weeks later I was down at the hardware store, and I 
ran into 
old Jed.

"Heyyy, Boomerang!"  sez Jed.  "How'd you like that insecticide I sold
 yous boyz?"

"Insecticide!"   sez I.  "Jed, Wot the hell you doing selling us
insecticide for?  We asked you  to make us lines of meth!"

Jed sez,  "Lines of meth?!  I thought you said you wanted me to make
your lives a mess!"

OK, since this conversation has revived itself, I'll spend my two cents.

Am I the only one who thinks this whole ridiculousness about Kid Bippy's
manager acting drunk and obnoxious is made even more weird by the fact that
.... um... Kid Bippy *has* a *manager*??

I mean, how many djs in the underground actually have a manager ....
someone to help get you bookings, maybe, but a *manager* who speaks on your
behalf like that like you can't do it yourself?  And to take themselves so
seriously that they throw a diva tantrum on the beach at an underground
party??  Oh please.

It's really the prima donna behavior that rubs people the wrong way... and
Kid Bippy/Greg needs to understand that his own personal reputation is at
stake if he allows others to speak for him.  My advice is, do it yourself,
Kid.  Then if there are problems, you can handle them the way you really
want, and people can make their judgments based on *your* behavior and not
his. A prima donna manager isn't doing you any favors in this scenario.
And to succeed in life, you'd best be able to manage your own stuff, cuz no
one will do it the way you will, I promise.

Old school music, new school music, ain't the issue really, I bet we
wouldn't have heard the complaints if it weren't for the other behavior
that night.

I've never heard Kid Bippy spin, but I'm sure that there are a few less
jobs waiting for him out there than there were before this happened, even
if he is the next DJ Dan (and whoever said Madame Mercury/Sherry doesn't
know about DJ Dan doesn't know about Sherry).  Lesson learned.

Yup Yup Yup!!! Great stuff this tryptophan! I have a whole bottle of the
stuff at home. Works the same way as Prozac. Increases seratonin levels
in the brain.
By itself it makes you feel really loopy or giddy. Makes you kinda
drowsy. Mental changes similar to that of a very mild dose of psyclobin
or "shrooms".
I call it the un-spun pill. Hahaha.
Go get some at your health food stores. More potent than the 5 hydroxy
tryptophan is "L-tryptophan".

I'm not sure, but I believe there was also a strong push from
pharmaceutical companies to make tryptophan illegal because it competed
with their anti-depressants.  grrr...  

Another snippet of info about tryptophan.  Tryptophan is a precursor to
tryptamine, which is a precursor to many of our favorite entheogenic
substances; psilocin, dmt, mescaline.  As such, tryptophan has been used
in the growth substrate of p. cubensis mushrooms to increase psilocin
concentrations.  Voila, super silly fungi.  Maybe a little too strong for
the majority of this list. Don't try it at home, kids. ;)

Dear Natasha,
What HAS been banned from health food stores is something known as
"L-Tryptohan". That is the chemical version of it.
"5-hydroxy-tryptophan" is the natural supplement of it. It's extracted
from beans. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that we need to be
alive. Protein!
Love,
Paul*E*Wog

That's true. If you take 4-8mg of L-tryptophan is is like you took 5mg
of shrooms. Never did it, but I can understand how it could from taking
5-hydroxy-tryptophan. If you people don't believe that you can buy
5-hydroxy-tryptophan then i will bring my bottle to City Espresso on
Wednesday Night this week for delicious beats.

dear melissa,

the two times i have seen kid bippy i said to myself what a nice guy..

i like the fact that he puts d & B into a tekno house mix.  not afraid 
to cross barriers.  i like that..... then i saw him one time on haight 
street.  at that time he was just starting to get gigs in the bay area 
and we talked about dj who from where he's from and we talked record 
shops and he said that he had passed out 35 or so tapes b4 he got a gig.  
honest dj advice.  i have had pleasant experiences with him.  

i know nothing of the drama that ensued upon the decks at such and such 
a party, but i hold promoters entirely responsible for sticking to their 
line-up schedule in a timely fashion or working it out between the acts 
that they have booked. remember, dj's are artists foremost. hence, there 
must oft times be a lubricant promoter to ease out the differences in 
enlarged egos.  when i throw a party i do it. sometimes it has taken up 
most of my partying time, but i make sure that the show goes smoothly.  

get over it, just listen to the music........dj jakeloco

Please don't.

Whether it's being used, just looked at, whatever, the manager will 
probably see it.  And he's pretty pissed about kidz using drugs at city 
e.  So come on down.  But don't ruin Wed. nights by getting Delicious 
Beats/Slow Roasted/etc. permanently banned.

we now return you to your regularly scheduled discourse....

Okie dokes, NO TV! was refreshingly different from Sf's other clubs.
The main floor of 1015 folsom was transformed into a gigantic living room.
They brought down all the couches and set them up along the walls, and
in the middle or the room facing the sound/light pod.  Platters of fresh
fruit, assorted candies at the bar.  Oh so yummy.

(Yikes, San Bernadino mud fest, and SNOW in the Sierra!!)  

First thing I hear when I walk in is Pink Floyd, so I immediately plop my
ass down on a couch in front of the lowered giant disco ball and listen
to the mellow ambient and trip out to the light show.  I meditated for
about an hour on the couch, listening to sounds of nature layered with
lush lyrical synth orchestrations.  So nice to have a bowl, chill out and
wind down from the weekend.  

And then the ambient turns into an easy downtempo groove.  I get up and
relocated to another couch, where I get a fresh perspective of lights
and sound.  It really was a showcase for the lighting/visual guys in the
beginning of the evening.  I have a much higher appreciation for those
guys.  Anyways, the music goes through a series of smooth transitions
until it hits some deep house, and that's where it stayed.  The bass was
pounding its steady four four, and people grooved out on the floor.  I
would have liked to have been taken to some breakbeats.

I really liked that the music and atmosphere followed a story line.
Ambient to relax, let go, chill, meet other peeps.  Call it preparation
for a spiritual dance gathering.  I believe more raves should start out
like this so everyone can start off at the same level.  Anyone know what
I'm talking about?  Props to the djs for such a difficult job of raising
the energy level by small notches to draw in the dancers.  Damn, that's a
whole sociological mind game djs have to play. 

Well, I had a good time, and will probably go again.  Does anybody know if
you can get underage people in through the guest list?  Will they check
IDs?  If they don't then maybe I can bring in some of you underaged peeps
in.

Have a good week,
george

Greetings Friends of Creativity Cafe , Art and Technology,

Welcome to V.A.R.I.O.U.S. Media Ink; Newsletter of Visionary Artists
Resources Including Other Unique Services and Creativity Cafe.

This is one of the last KidCast specific editions posted to our general
(V.A.R.I.O.U.S.) email list. As we near the KidCast date of Nov. 17,
production will speed up. Many of you, understandably, won't want to be
bothered with the KidCast coordination mailings, and will be spared.  :-)

The KidCast mailing list (kidcast@envirolink.org), donated by KidCast
sponsor, Envirolink, will soon be in operation to handle KidCast traffic.
If you are interested, KidCast Central and our Community Forum will have
the latest developments.  There you will find digests of KidCast messages
of note in our KidCast Conversations area. Significant KidCast updates and
news of interest to our readership, will be posted in future editions of
VMI as time permits.

We are delighted at the development of a fantastic "KidCast For Peace" web
site created by KidCast sponsor The Mining Company's guide Diane Dobbs,
publisher of Creative Writing For Kids...A big round of applause for her
efforts!!!  The first entry for KidCast#5 has been submitted there...a very
moving piece provicated by a UFO visitation.  It brought tears to my
eyes...check it out at:
http://kidswriting.tqn.com/library/blank/blconts.htm#cckfp .

The Maui Research and Technology Park has made a KidCast committment
offering a teleconferencing room, computer and high bandwidth Internet
connection for CU-SeeMe. A Maui co-producer is still needed to ground the
energy there. Thanks to volunteer, Jennifer Melnick, we are developing
Creativity Cafe's KidCast Central page to have an improved user interface.
You may check out Jennifer's work--which includes being lead designer for
U.S. Vice President Al Gore's "National Education Website," at:

V.A.R.I.O.U.S. was at The Seybold Convention all last week overlapping with
the Children's Interactive Expo, at Fort Mason in San Francisco. Lots of
little bodies, lots of big Sony Computers. Fantastic KidCast connections
were made--reports on both to be posted in the CC Community Forum when time
permits.

Macromedia, longtime VARIOUS supporter takes over this week with their
annual user's Conference:
http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/ucon97/. Their creative tools
continue to easily liberate the multimedia storyteller.  This reporter will
be  hosting a "New School For the Next Millennium" Birds of A Feather (BOF)
session at the upcoming Avatar97 conference, produced by Bruce Damer of the
Contact Consortium: http://www.ccon.org/ .

Got a call from NY SIGGRAPH last night. They will be helping put the NY
KidCast end together at their 5th Annual Digital Salon in cooperation with
the School of Visual Arts. At Seybold, Intergraph seemed interested in
grounding KidCast at COMDEX (boy, doesn't *that* have a nice ring to it?
:-). That will take some followup bandwidth I won't have for a while.
Any connection into Comdex anyone might afford is very appreciated :-)

We'd like to hear from you....
Please offer your feedback about this mailing and give us a clue about how
*your* life is unfolding by posting in Creativity Cafe's Community Forum:
http://creativity.net/cgi-bin/nu4m/cc4m/index.cgi.

Lastly... We thank Raines Cohen, editor of NeT Professional
(editor@NeTProLive.com), for the first "in-print" KidCast call that we know
of (http://www.NeTProLive.com), and want to turn you on to Jan Shepherd's
Project Mind Foundation; the latest to link to Creativity Cafe. Project
Mind Foundation's vision: "to free the human spirit from the crushing
illusion of materialism by using the transformative genius, latent in all
humans, to eliminate real and addictive lack":

Have a happy, expressive and loving day.
With aloha,

By the way, tryptophan is NOT an illegal substance in the US.  It is
just that now it is available only by MD or ND (naturopathic doctor)
prescription, thus it costs a lot more than it did when it was
over-the-counter.  The "smart drug" companies that sell it get around
this by marketing what they sell as "animal grade".  I have some of this
form of tryptophan though I am a little weirded out by doing "animal
grade" stuff!

When it was taken off the market for several years because some people
contracted EMS (eosinophilia myalgia syndrome), it was proven that ALL
of these people had taken tryptophan that was made by the SAME Japanese
manufacturer (even though under different brand names, which is how most
supplements are sold; there are very few actual manufacturers).   SO
now, years later, it has finally been returned to the market, but only
by prescription and the cost is way up...crazy FDA bullshit, for sure.

I'd love to hear more about this tryptophan to tryptamine conversion.  I
have a book on amino acids and it says nothing about this.  Tryptophan
is coverted to serotonin.  Vitamin B-6 and C apparentely aid in this
process.  Whoever wrote about "4-8 mg of tryptophan is like 4 mg of
psilocybin" is out there a bit...active doses of the former are around
1000 mg (1 g) and the latter, well, at least a gram or two (not mg).

Yes it does. Gimme da big portion, with an extra helping of black eye
peas n' collard greens on da side!

For example, I thought SF got a great dose of the funky stuff with Mark
Grant's performance at Stompy on Sunday. Good dirty nasty soulful
funky-ass HOUSE MUSIC GODDAMNIT and NOTHING LESS. And the early-middle
part of Preston's set was quite funky too. Mark Grant ain't from SF,
either...

I liked the mature, friendly, beautiful crowd at Stompy too! Bra n'
Booty Betty's in full effect. You yungins go listen to your trendy
undanceable shit, and us olduns will dance and shake our bones. Yeah...
One day, y'all yungins may get cool, if y'all don't kill yoselves with
those stupid drugs first, or trip and crack yer skullz open with those
stoopid oversized pants, or get some kinda fungus growin behind the ear
cuz it's so damn wet back there...

I'm still sore from dancing, so it musta been a good party, eh? 

Whadju say, sonnie?

Psilocybin is active at about 5-8 mg.  that's from the psilocybin mushrooms
faq.  it's because the mushrooms aren't 100% psilocybin that the active
dose is grams of mushrooms, not mg.

Who?
 The sun is our God. We are the energy from within it. We were born because
our sun managed to grow in a fairly stable position around our galaxy. I
believe the electricity flowing through-out our brain & spine will keep
it's cohesion after our death. Taking our consciousness, our memories, and
our personalities with it. I believe we all float off as energy beings when
we die. I believe there are many beings within our sun that are very wise,
feeding off the suns energy.. .. 
 I believe that someday we will all meet the center of our galaxy.. And
someday be sucked into, yet another consciousness on the other side, where
our galaxy will finally travel..Billions of years from now.
 You see.. We are all a part of this HUGE galaxy we call the milky way. All
our galaxy is, is a spark in the fabric of time and space. In simpler
terms..It's just a + and then it's a -. Here today, gone tomorrow.. imagine
a flower blooming in the morning light. How it twists out of it's curled up
sleep, and then at night how it curl's back into a pod. Thats all we our! A
part of an enormous flower! A flower of light, energy, and matter. Curling
out into this void, and sucking it's way back into the minus. .
 Were all going to die! No. We will all see are galaxy unfold it's self
someday. Someday we will watch our flower be pulled into it's own weight,
into the unimaginable...  

And these are just my beliefs ofcourse.. But alot of it has fact. And alot
of facts without answers.. 

Anyways. Gotta jet.. Praise the lord our sun.
And you BETTER be greatfull that our sun is still here on Christmas. That
is, if your so stuck on this state of flesh and blood.

5-8mg is probably psychoactive, but  in a gram of mushrooms there is usually
about 20 mg of psilocybin and psilocin (they both become psilocin when they
enter your body). so eating a fourth of a gram really isnt that much, like a
fractrion of a cap or something pretty small. NEwayz, i read a report on the
toxicity of psilocybin that said that 13grams of pure psilocybin was injected
intraveneously and after a few dayz of pure psychosis, the guy was still
alive. lets see... if there is about 20mg in a gram of dried shrooms then
youd have to eat 650grams of mushrooms to get that much psilocybin.
uhhhh...... maybe i read that wrong, thats like a pound and a half.

this is a nice view of life

It reminds me of an indian story about how a long time ago
there was a huge star(sun) that contained all life and it exploded...
In the heart of each human and living being is a fragment of that star.

Thru our life we are tested by having water thrown on us and the 
ones that survive the pain are made stronger and stronger
each time they have a struggle. Eventually they grow so strong
and powerful that they become a star...When our heart becomes
so strong and full of love that it shines everyday for all without
judgement then it takes its place in the sky and when it becomes
strong enough it dances with other stars and gives birth to planets.
And these planets eventually give birth to more vehicles to carry
more starseeds. One day all these starseeds will reunite and 
create the next cycle.

Its kind of nice to look at the sky at night especially at
one of these great outdoor parties we had this summer
and see each of those dancing lights in the sky as someone's
heart. Sometimes you can even find the heart of your own
ancestors twinkling at you ...perhaps that wonderful friend
that you once played with is there beaming a message to 
you...listen and sometimes you can hear them speak to you.

Of coarse in our modern world you have to be careful and make sure
that twinkling in the sky is not microsofts new satelite or something.
That would be sad if you thought you were talking to your dead
ancestors and you got a message to upgrade to windows 98.

Sure. That's fine, but the stuff is completly legal. I mean i bought it
at Whole Foods. It's an amino acid that is essential for nutrition. Thes
stuff is in any food with protien.
But if you would rather I didn't bring it then, that's fine.

Oooops! I posted to fast and didn't re readi what i wrote. It meant to
say that 4000-8000mg of tryptophan are similar to 5mg of psyclobin.

I don't know shit about shroom toxicity, but i do not that it is
impossible to OD on shrooms because a human stomach cannot ingest that
many mushrooms. Although I know that pure LSD25
d-lysergic-acid-delythamine is non-toxic. That doesn't mean the blotter
crap. I mean like black gels. Ya know the stuff w/o the speed or
strychnine. Oh. And Tryptophan is NOT a drug it is an amino acid that is
in the sausage & pepperoni that i am eating right now!

Opinions, Facts, Individuality, One's self-worth, Life, Living, 
Sympathy, Growth, Knowledge, Wisdom, , The sun, a rock, a stick, a 
plant, Buddha, Allah, Jesus, Mother Earth, etc, etc. You could go on and 
on, and on.  Individuality is what separates one from another and what 
makes me very unlike you, him, her, or their cousin.  Isn't it 
beautiful?

Regarding Life, God, or being happy you guys might be interested in a 
book entitled "The 12th Planet"  It is about a theory that we were all 
brought here by an alien civilization millions of years ago and "planted 
a seed by which everything were to blossom from"  The book has facts, 
ancient drawings and other neato stuff to prove the theory, I don't 
believe it though, but that is my opinion.

 Telling other peeps what to do is silly. Especially considering the mess 
you got yourself in by mentioning names a while back.

 Teach by example.

My opinion of life and a superior entity consists of this:

I believe that human beings were seen as an intelligent/unique/? enough
life form to receive somewhat of an "enhancement" by being given the highest amount
of "lifeforce" given to any creature on earth. I feel that we're all
connected through this lifeforce and this is simply a phase an an infinite
existence. By being placed on this "Earth" we're giving the opportunity to
communicate and exist with other life forms to increase our spiritual
understanding and in turn return our enhanced "lifeforce" back to the
collective consciousness that is this "great lifeforce". 

I've always felt that there was something beyond this. I knew it. But I
couldn't believe that religion was completely true. I feel that there is
good and evil, and that this lifeforce has given us this great opportunity
because it cared about us. They didn't want us to feel pain and agony
but knew that it was part of the entire experience. It's someone of a sad
reality but it just makes me even more happy to be alive and to have all
the good friends I have now. I'm 21 years old and am coming to a better
and better understanding of where I am in this infinite *space* and how I
can keep my feet on the ground, turn around, blink my eyes, and focus on
*today* and be content. We're always in a rush to do nothing. I'm
striving to be as content walking down the street to Bart as I am laying
in bed watching Looney Tunes. Because in essence the amount of time I
spend doing each is equally as valuable in the sand glass of my life. 

Ultimately I must focus on what matters to me and live my life focusing on
that. The values and goals of others are irrelevant in my journey through
this life experience. Meaning that I need to follow my dreams and not
judge them by other people standards, point of view, values, etc. There
are so many people living their lives trying to find something they're
never going to find. When all they need to do is open their eyes and
realize how much they're taking for granted all the time. We've all been
blessed and no matter what happens after *this*, we have *this* now and
let us enjoy *this* to the fullest extreme.

Ring, ring.... gotta run. Customer!

Byroni! ;)

St johns wort, a herb used for centuries to treat depression might
also be used to counteract the negative effects E

It is even being used by american doctors as an alternative to prozac
and is not only much cheaper than prozac it is also more effective
and has no side effects. I dont know if it could be used in a similar
way as some of the other substances being discussed in this thread
but it might be worth looking into. 

Also DHEA is something to check out if you dont have the same amount
of energy that you did when you were 16. It does however have one
side effect...it gives you the libido of a 16 year old. It only costs
about
3-4 dollars a bottle so give it a try. Educate yourself with a web search
first.

and lets not forget the non drug methods of feeling good ...like raving.

Sorry partner but the purpose of this list is too talk about rave
related issues. I do think before I post. I don't give a shit what
flavor drugs you take or how you take them and I think many people on
this list will agree with me. Nothing he stated was informative and
would save some lame ass from hurting themselves, so save it.

Whoa!  Since when are you on G*d's judgement panel?
I understand your point but I must ask, to whom are you directing this
damnation?
Are you trying to encourage speed users to not do speed?
Nice intentions, but you might try another tactic if you really want people
to listen to you.
No one enjoys being yelled at or judged.
I would be so put off by what and how you are communicating, I would
probably stop listening to you within the first few words.
But that's just coming from little ol' me, who *has* been addicted to speed
(long, long ago) and would immediately ignore anyone who came at me with a
holier-that-thou attitude.
Rule #1 in the art of communication: don't insult your audience.  They will
surely tune you out.
Just a suggestion,
Megan

Yes kids, Neils has hit the mark on this one!
Stompy *is* the gltter-glam party.
Check your baggies at the door, 'cause there ain't no room on the runway
for all that extra fabric.
For anyone who's never been, you're missing a serious show!
*All* the beutiful people come out, and they are there as much for the
music as for the opportunity to wear that new sexxxy outfit!
And of course, the beats tend to be a bit on the slow tip.
All the better to slink around the bar, see, and be seen!
After all, it is a Stompy!
I haven't graced this party with my presence in a while.
Gonna try to go to the next one - betters start planning my outfit NOW!
Megan

yup... i've read that st johns wort the most popular anti-depressant
in germany (outsells prozac 7 to 1). one thing to consider tho is the
effect on serotonin levels... not all anti-depressants are ssri's, and
i'm not really sure that if they weren't (an ssri) that it would
counteract the drop in serotonin levels after taking e. i believe that
st johns wort (or hypericum) is more along the lines of a tricyclic
antidepressant, and i'm not remembering now how these work exactly.
anyway i suppose it couldn't hurt to try it out! (disclaimer - i'm not
responsible for any of you who choose to mix herbs and drugs... be
aware that some herbs are very powerful and can even be toxic. there
are no fda regulations on any of these. don't know about the effects
of st johns wort mixed with anything tho.)

hmmmm... the libido of a 16 year old? i'd have to think about that.
i'm sort of enjoying my 30 year old one at the moment!  the only thing
i know about dhea is that it raises the levels of 6 different
hormones, and girls - high doses can increase your facial hair.  eeeew!

caffeine bad fire good! Oh god I hate caffeine, I over did it yesterday, 
I don't advise anybody to not sleep then try to survive on 1/2 a pack of 
vivrine the next day at work, I wound up coming home sick yesterday and 
having to skip my night class. Sleep is good, trust me you will feel 
better in the morning, I have learned quick that the only thing worth 
staying up for is the hard hitting bass and a stuffy room or warehouse 
full of good vibes, or configuring your linux kernel to work on that x86 
at home :)

I don't really care either way, it's just that yesterday 
when I told him about all the stuff that was being said on the list 
about him & Greg he said, "For one-I'm not even Greg's manager..." That 
came out of Mikey's mouth.  But Whatever.

Hey Kids,

		Can some one tell me whats going on? Why is it every time I check my mail I
see negitive remark after negitive remark? I am really tierd of this, what
has happend to the scene? I mean come on people how this list and scene has
been for the last couple months SUCKS! 
It really hurts me to read things that are really based on whos an asshole
and whos not!
This kinda shit is exactly why I havent partied in a while. Its all been
about who did or said this, thats not what I rember this collective comunity
being about!
	
	I envoled myself in the scene because I belived in what it represented. I
belived in the scene, I belived in the people, and I belived in PLUR. Now to
see it this way crushes a part of my heart. I think we all have seen a
downfall in the scene, you can blame it on whatever you would like, but in
reality only we are to blame.By promoting unexcepitable behavior, commments,
actions ect. we are keeping things from getting better, and belive me they
are just getting worse. Sooner or later people there wont realisticly be a
scene based on Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.... AT ALL! We are the only
ones that can keep our scene alive, and we can keep it alive through love, or
we can keep it alive through negitivity, its our choice!

	Take what Ive said and analize it, disect it, flame it how ever you would
like, or you can stop take a look at yourself and change it, its all up to
you!

	

	Amanda

Well, Bi-Polar-Manic-Depressive-Fruit-Loop-itis runs in my family. (ha-ha
not funny really...) My dad has always been opposed to Prozac, lithium and
the like, but ironically enough, this summer he lost it, completely, ended
up in the hospital.  ("It" being sanity)  His doctors were pretty upset
when he mentioned St Johns wort.  Anyway, he tried it instead of the Prozac
they prescribed... 2-weeks later he was back in the hospital :-\   As a
side note, Prozac didn't do the trick either, Lithium seems to be helping
though...

Be careful with DHEA, I tried it not too long ago, (I kept falling asleep
at work and....zzzzzz.....) noted side effects include: increased
aggression, increased sex drive, short tempered-ness, appetite loss, and if
you take it before noon you won't be getting much sleep.  DHEA is will also
cause hair to grow on women's faces...  Check the web for more info before
you try it!

kay this is sort of a response to all the housing posts as of late.

Me and my roommates have moved out from our old apartment and our oh so cool
of a landlord(the reason we left) has sold it to a nice family. But they 
would like to rent it out for 6 months while they are back in china.

Here are the low down details.

The address is 400 ortega avenue. On the corner of latham and ortega
in mountain view. its a second floor corner apartment, so on a nice day
with all the windows open you get a cool breeze.  That street tends to be noisy though.  Its two bedroom, one bath but has two sinks. One acutally in the 
bathroom and one out.  Nie large living room but the kitchen is kinda small.

Rent is $1200 a month, plus you need to pay for electric.

My only real complaint is that most of the people there are either elderly 
couples or new families so the place was quiet.  Towards the end we did get a 
few noise complaints.

If anyone is interested please emiail me.  I still have keys and can show you
around.

Oops.  My bad.  None the less, if it LOOKS like some sort of drug, the

Sorry, kinda paranoid on this tip, cause I LIKE to play at city, and I

     Hi all,
     the "Outside" yesterday was not bad, very good music (sometimes, very 
     good trip sound), very good v.j. (thanx for the tron-parts) , but not 
     enough people (it's a normal week).
     All the strange overdressed people from munich must see this great bay 
     area. I must say it again. I love it here, especially all the people.
     Sometimes i feel like in heaven :-)

Oh goddess not that ignorant rumor again... Paul, listen very carefully:

Look at the little piece of paper. And imagine just how much of the

I don't think anything has happened except for people evolving (if I may be
so bold) into habits or expectations of what they expect from a party or
this scene.

The honeymoon is over for many I guess.  What suprises me is the RATE of
burnout.  I mean, I became somewhat jaded after the first 5 years of
raving, it took that long.  Now people go into it full bore, then become
disillusioned after less than a year?  I don't get it.

>I mean come on people how this list and scene has
>been for the last couple months SUCKS!

And this is positive commentary?  Sometimes things start with you.  The
scene hasn't gotten any worse or better.  People still seem to be having a
good time at parties, as well as bad times.

Collective?  To what ends?  I have never seen this scene or any other scene
spawned from this to be anything more than entertainment.  To me at least
it isn;t a movement, just a party or series of parties with good/bad
intentions.

Other than music and dancing together what *did* this represent to you and
how did you come to that conclusion?

The downfall...we come full circle witrh this one once a month it seems.
There is no downfall of anything, there is nothign falling, there is
nothing being dismantled, and there is nothing there that wasn;t there
before.  Maybe people are beginning to wake up and see this for what it
really is...a party.  Pretty much it, the rest is people putting thier
ideals onto a party whose primary purpose is fun and escape.

It has never been based on those elements.  It has however been based on
beats, booty, booze, and copius amounts of drugs.  In other words F U N,
*not* P L U R.

> We are the only

No you are not.  The scene has been going strong for years with new people
showing up all the time.  When someone disappears, there is a new
personalitiy or personalities to take teir place.  As long as people like
music, beats, booty, dancing, drugs, this scene will thrive, as it has for
damn near a DECADE!

Hmmm.... Didn't have any effect on me. I take Phosphidyl Choline(a lot,10 a day)
every day which did have a marked effect on my moods and energy
level(which is why I take it regularly.) I decided to try DHEA, and just
got finished taking 50mg a day for two months and... nothing. So as with

You said it right girlfriend!!!  I am so tired of hearing people restating
the facts about this Kid Bippy deal, and all the other stuff that people have
been arguing about lately...  I think that people need to realise that these
are personality conflicts between different people that dont necessarily have
to have the same opinions...Not everybody needs to aggree with everybody
else, we are all different, but we all don't need to try to conform others to
have the same beliefs as us either.  (obviously)  
So, please remember why you go to raves, why you are a part of this scene,
and why you like to be on the SF rave mailing list.... I am because i love
being a part of a group of people that is like a giant extended family to me.
 Having moved here not too long ago, and recently entering the scene here, i
love being a part of this in SF, and it is great to know that we are all
here, supporting each other, going to excellent parties, doing fantastic
drugs- and sometimes not so fantastic- hugging, plurring, loving, crying,
laughing, and listening to each other.  But mostly and more importantly,
having fun!!!!!!!


~~~~Keeping the PLUR alive~~~~
Loving you all,

Nothing, S.F Raves is not "the scene." Most likely you have noticed this
behaviour in the circle of people in *your* scene.

Then don't read them.

It rather amusing actually. Every couple of months(weeks?) someone comes
along and posts something very much along the lines of what you posted, as
if, somehow, the sky is falling.

The world hasn't suddenly changed. In all likelyhood *you've* changed.
The newness is wearing off, and as you become more ingrained in a group of
people you begin to realize that "Wow, there is attitude, backstabbing,
gossip, etc." in every "scene." 

Or maybe you are going to parties that are encouraging everyone in the
world to attend, advertising at malls, high schools, etc. What kind of
people do you think are going to show up? That is the problem with
speaking in absolutes: "Oh yeah PLUR!!!! We are all one people, one
vibe, etc." Well, there are a lot of people out there that would(and do) 
seek advantage in that attitude. To them it is an opportunity waiting to
be exploited.

Then you better move on before it kills you, if it is truly bringing you
down as much as you say. Why stick around something that is harmful?
Sounds very self-destructive..

> I think we all have seen a downfall in the scene, you can blame it on
> whatever you would like, but in reality only we are to blame.

I haven't seen a downfall in anything. All I have seen is people being
people. On the one hand they can be wondeful, caring , full of love
and other they can be horrible, spiteful, and cruel. Do you actually think
that your take on the "scene" isn't something that many, many people have
not expressed on and off the list before? Pop, there goes that bubble.

Yawn.

I would suggest that you do some soul searching and determine how much of
these changes are external, and how many are really internal.

Exactly. Lithium is used in cases of severe chemical imbalance(and is not 
an SSRI to the best of my knowledge), and if it helping, I am not suprised
that St. John's or Prozac wouldn't have worked.

Anti-depressants are an imprecise science at best, having witnessed how
the decision of what to prescribe is handled. Basically, they diagnose a
person, which usually defines the class of drug they are going to. Then
they use you as a guniea pig, trying out various drugs in that class until
they find something that seems to work, or they switch classes of drugs
and start all over. I've seen it happen.

It is rare that I post a NRR, but after watching a movie with my Megan last
night I had to chime in for this rare momentary lapse of strict protocol I
adhere to.  You, and yes I mean you, should watch Rosewood by John
Singleton.

I think it is one of the most important movies of the 90's for certain.  I
also think that what happens (the story of Rosewood is entirely TRUE) is a
reminder of where we are today in terms of ourselves as a nation and as
races of people.

I know many hate when we begin to talk about race, and try to step around
it, or not even talk about it in fear of what may happen (understanding),
but don;t shy away from it, nor this movie.  Rosewood was a small thriving
town in the middle of my home state of Florida.  Rosewood was entirely
black an Sumner was entirely white.  What happens is a lesson to us all
regarding suspicion, racial intolerance, segregation, silence (and the
culpability of silence in the face of horendous wrongdoing, on BOTH sides),
bigotry, and the ramifications of rape and race.

If you have 2 hours, and want to see something both painful and
enlightening, see this movie.  Then dicuss it with your friends.

Just my .02.

Oh an for all you west coast yahoos who think "Oh, that was the south, it
could and never did happen here", I would gently remind you of Rodney King,
the Lynching in Concord, the Asian brother shot in the head by Sonoma
County Police, and the list continues.  watch the movie, then talk to
friends...the long road to healing starts with us.

Peace,
John

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

guys, guys.....

as john lee so eloquently stated ... nothing changes the way you think it does.

i think we're talking about perception here... and, like john, i am
observing a much shorter cycle from "raving is my life and spiritual
salvation" to "what happened to the scene i loved?" ...

and the real problem is NOT the scene per se (though, yes, there are
cyclical changes in the scene) ... it is in YOUR OWN PERCEPTIONS.

for you youngsters on here, here's a big lesson... ready????

Relax!  There's plenty of time to do the things you want!!  You do not have
to immerse yourself in what you think raving is as if it is the secret to
life!

If you started raving in the last year/months/whatever ... and you already
feel burned out and disillusioned, then it's not about the scene, it's
about you.  What were your expectations?  Was there some void in your life
that you thought raving would fill?

Ask yourself if you dove headfirst into the world of mind-altering
substances (because that is a shortcut to burnout, my friends).

Ask yourself if you stopped doing the other things you used to like to do,
like read, go to movies, cook a meal with friends, take a daytime drive and
picnic on the beach, shop for comic books, whatever.

It's all about moderation and not expecting something to take the primary
meaning in your life.

While I do believe that what raving can show us can change your life (the
feeling of complete happiness that i found dancing in the wee hours of the
morning surrounded by beats and friends has changed me forever) ... it's
ain't the be-all and the end-all.

The party goes on ... with or without you...

Love, Leslie

They pretty much started the whole thing with Castlemorton<sp> which was
this massive 3 day thing that just got bigger as more people turned up,
and was far too large for the police to break up. In modern demo
parlance they achieved 'critical mass' and were surrounded rather than
split up.

After that they got some sort of recording deal, but caned the phones at
the record company organising parties, and left for europe. When I was
in Paris the other year, people thought that because I was English I
knew Spiral Tribe personally, because they had created the whole free
party scene there.

Reportedly they became excessively darkside on K in the later days in
England. I did see an inverview featuring one of them and Hakim Bey of
Temporary Autonomous fame, which was interesting because they have
created quite a few anarchistic autonomous zones (raves) in their time.

I've gota a couple of tracks by them, its good hard techno. They're
practically mythological figures here, in terms of coolness. There's
some songs by u4ia/f8 which are quite similar.

ok, thought that'd get some attention.  here's where i stand, not 
that it's relevant...


kid bippy- i didn't even go to play nice, so i have nothing to add 
here.  

ephedrine/mushrooms/ecstacy/whatever the hell drugs we were talking 
about:  I CHOOSE NOT TO RESPOND DUE TO THE FACT THAT E-MAIL IS NOT 
ENCRYPTED so anybody (big brother) is watching this right now.  

the scene- i went to my first rave a little over a year ago, and am
still in love with it.  i think i am thoroughly addicted to partying,
but am not seeking help.  :-)  it is my therapy.

and there is plenty of positive things going on here: we got 
boomerang's jokes for one....:-)

TechStep is great! Sorta inbetween drum&bass and techno. It has a slower
more dancable breakbeat sorta <bosh> <ta> <bosh> <bosh> and low dark
acid basslines, sorta waaawwarrwwww waaawww. 

You could have a go at making this using a win95 machine, Orangator and
Fast Tracker II. Where these are on the net I'll leave as an exercise.
You can listen to badboiz by big daddy as an example, but this is mostly
sample loops.

Gain the Means of Production.

BTW, I know why Jungle is called Jungle! There was also some early Dub
called Drum and Bass.

Blatant self promotion!

Tonight at Cafe du Nord with some groovy bands--I play before, in
between, and afterwards--
more of the Trip Hoppy and Jazzy stuff.  Come have a drink! 2 dollar
Martinis!

I always forget to mention my Cafe du Nord gigs--so this is atonement on
the net.

2170 Market St. Cafe du Nord, S.F.

> Don't say Windows *anything* to Niels. He gets cranky... ;-)

Now now, remember that I'm the newfangled kinder gentler Niels. So this
is not entirely true.

I currently use windows to run the following apps:
(1) Cakewalk Pro Audio 6.0 on Windows (and eventually Logic Audio).
(2) Mark of the Unicorn Control/Routing Panel for Midi Timepiece AV
(3) CoolEdit
(4) TurboTax
(5) MS Visual C++ (for work, tho I try to avoid it like the plague)
(6) MS Word, to view/print documents made by coworkers not sophisticated
	enough to use a real operating system and good typesetting software.

Otherwise, I prefer running the X Window System on Linux or SGI's Irix.

Hell, given my current job as explainer/recommender/debunker of new
technologies to  upper-management types at a very large electronic
commerce/transaction company, I am required to be nonpartisan and
extremely pragmatic on all issues. This means not dissing Windows
because it is a braindamaged, ass-backward, flawed attempt at software
engineering. I have to take market considerations into account, which
means it's perfectly ok to promote solutions that suck to a captive
audience of morons (customers) that wouldn't know a better solutions if
it bit them on the ass.

So, I have no problem doing/consulting/advising on issues related to
MFC, Visual C++, and I've even dropped my objection to Java now that
Sun finally wised up to the last 30-or-so years of Computer Language
Design and added "Inner Classes"; hell, they even got rid of AWT's
idiotic event model and made something that only partially sucks!

But yeah, if given the choice, I'd still be programming in Unix using
Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, or Winterp. And yeah, I continue to watch
people floundering on things that would take one engineer one week to
solve in Lisp and Unix but instead takes teams of 50 engineers years to
engineer, reengineer, debug, test, and rewrite a few times... using
such wonderful modern provenances like Windows, Visual C++, and MFC.
But hey, that's progress for ya.

PS-  I  did al little more research on it and found out that you can
increase the Seritonin levels in your brain WITHOUT the further use of
drugs.  (yea!) That's right kiddies, through the miracle of modern
computer technology, you can increase your Serionin levels on the
average of 21% just by listening to Alpha wavs, whish you can
synchronize into any sound on your computer.  I know it sounds kindof
complicated, but it is actually much easier to do than expected. 
(Note, listening to alpha wavs also increases your mental awareness,
memory retention, and also has an 11% increase in Norepinephrin
levels, and a 
25% increase in Beta-Endorphin levels.  Good stuff!)  This is all done
through a program called "Cool Edit", which you can get off of the
net.   I use alpha wavs for this purpose, and also to study.  I also
use Theta wavs, which make your brain think it is sleeping, and
induces a very deep state of meditation.  If anyone is intersted in
either the Theta or Alpha wavs, or increasing the amount of
neurotransmitters in their brain, please give me a shout back.  

Take care!
HugZ, sNIKers ;^)

Yes, totally legendary...

Has anyone been to any of the cross-country gigs they've done lately?  I
know they were in Texas for awhile, and i think they just did one in LA.

I'm dying to hear a review.

I really like to know what kinda shit they're throwing down now; trance?
techno?  gabber?  total mix?  What?   What's the vibe been like?

C'mon, dish!

YES! My point exactly...when people talk about there being rat poison or

makes me chuckle because the amount of lsd that trips you up is *so* small

My opinion of Kid Bippy's mixing skills, social skills, taste in
records to play and choice of who to have represent him aside...

Suffice to say, I survived his set with some moral support, and had the
honor of being the guy who had to tell off his manager at Play Nice
after telling ReAch to "get off the decks" without consulting anybody
first.

DJs are not celebrities and should not be treated as such.  They are
people who are lame/sick/visionary enough to fall in love with music and
push it on others in the hope that it might affect them the same way... 
Fortunately, for the time being, this is seen as a service to the
community... but not a service worth being disrespected for.


On the topic of _Our Scene_ recommended reading below:


     "The music did not stop.  On it went, and on, pounding and
unchanging...There was no dancing in couples any more.  Arms were
outstreched to embrace everyone within reach, and knees were bent and feet
pounded the earth to the slow beating...The dancers began in low humming,
one note struck deep in the throught, and in off beat.  A quarter-tone came
in.  More and more voices took up the beat and the quarter-tone.  Whole
sections of the packed dancing space were bobbing to the rhythm...The
dancers lost identity.  Faces grew rapt, shoulders fell slighlty forward,
each person became a part of the dancing body, and the soul of the body was
the rhythm.
     Joseph, with glowing eyes, stood apart.  His feet moved slightly with
the throbbing, and he felt tied to the dancing body, but he did not join in.
He thought exultantly: 'We have found something here, all of us.  In someway
we've come closer to the earth for a moment...Something will come of this.
It's a kind of powerful prayer."

John Steinbeck   circa 1933
"To A God Unknown"  

It's not ours, it's not new, but too many people have found it for it not
to be real...

BELIEVE in that moment, mouth agape, eyes closed, going into the space
between your ears and feeling the music as it should have been felt all
along.  Open your eyes to _the_ family, assembled in _the_ house, waves of
emotion pouring over you, and you and you... this list has nothing to do
with it, except that we all claim to be interested.  It doesn't mean we
all "get it" or that there's even one singular way to "get it".

Damn...

Fact is, that as much as we blab on this list about PLUR, it's okay for
some people to be flagrant jerks, while other's need merely wear the wrong
clothes or call a 1200 a "record player" or be the wrong color and get
labeled as homie Gs or just plain mean or not hip or 'Oakland types'
whatever... suffice to say they get dissed, labeled as outsiders, etc
without as much as a chance to say "hello". 

I honestly believe the biggest danger to the scene is those who claim to
be it's flagbearers, it's hardcorest, it's defenders of the faith.  This
is not a contest, this can be a sustainable way to enjoy life if you don't
burn yourself out, if you don't kill your body and mind by poisoning
yourself in an effort to treat recreational drugs as an Olympic event, if
you think and feel, if you never forget it's for everybody and it was here
before you came. 

Careful with your labels and who you defend, many of you stand to look
mighty stupid in retrospect.  All the glitter, E, and huggles in the world
won't keep the world from making it's own judgements of you in a similar
fashion someday.

Life is not a rave.

Peace,
AndyW

you're right about the maoi's... it can be extremely dangerous to
combine them. (their effect is that they normalize the amount of amine
in the brain - which has nothing to do with the effects of ecstacy).
tricyclics may or may not be safe - the way they work is not really
known - they are thought to affect the serotonin or norepinephrine
levels in the brain. also beware of mixing cold medecines with
maoi's.... i'm not sure if st. john's wort is an maoi or a tricyclic,
but just because it's an herb doesn't mean that it can do no harm.
there are quite a few ssri's on the market now; i'm not recalling all
of the names at this point tho. but as i said earlier, these drugs
seriously alter your brain chemistry - they were designed for ppl who
lack certain chemicals and not for ppl who take so much e that they
become depressed. hey. you take a drug, deal with it's after effects.
take responsibility for your actions. it'll pass! be glad you don't
have that mood as a permanent fixture in your life.  

e. :)

if you are going to mix, i'm sure there's an abundance of info on the
web about all this shit.

Helloooooo all you boys and girls.....  : o )
With all this incredibly amazing long awaited rain, great ideas have been
forming in this People Loving United Ravers'  (Head?)....  = )
I have been discussing with a few folks,  the idea of having a gathering at
my house in san francisco, for all you lovely kids out there so that we can
meet each other, and have fun, and watch a few movies (remember the care
bears?)  -and anything else one might want to watch if they weren't all too
into the care bears...  
I think it would be nice to have you all over,chill one night, talk, watch
movies, share our fave music, meet fellow sfravers... etcera.... so, if
anybody is into it, write me a note, and i can get an idea of how many of you
folks want to gather here.  Maybe you could all bring something to drink, or
snack on, or contribute to the evening (tunes, movie, sweets,you get the
idea...)
I live in a pretty large flat right on Haight street, almost right above
Housewares.  And i promise the POleece wont break it apart...  = )   ~(if we
keep it happy)~

So let me know how you guys feel- and we'll set a date! 


Passin' the Lovin'

Hey Lara, good post, although I wanted to add a few thangs...

Sure you can.  I'm jaded as hell, but still have a great time when I go
out.  Fact remains however that I understand the various aspects of parties
(raves), done them for a number of years, and am now happy to go to the
occasional party, ahve a good time, and come home to my real life.  Since
the afterparty scene has fizzled out as compared to it's heydey, it's
enough that I have my own kind of afterparty with somem friends or my loved
one, chilling out.  The fun is what you make it.  You're 100% responsible
for your own vibe.

I've always had a problem with that acronym (PLUR), and it seems as time
goes on I hear it less and less, another transitory phrase of rave I guess.
In any instance, I do think that what has happened is that the scene was
built up by perhaps you and your pals as something other than what it was,
or what it always ahs been; just a party.  Now I know there are several
groups that are trying to get past this, but to me it essentiallly remains
the same with all the trappings that any entertainment has to offer.  The
thing about rave is when you start out you're alone, when things are just
about over for you you may find yourself not so alone and with 1 or more
solid friends from the experience.  At worse, you've had one helluva time.

I call that a win win.

Agreed, although for the ones who do this for a living, raves are an
integral part of their lives.

>	- PLUR doesn't really exist all that much

No acronym does, but you can take some components of that word and
integrate it into other aspects of your life.  I like respect, since from
that word the rest naturally follows.


>7) I want to add that Amanda's been partying for even longer than me, so
>to say she became jaded way before alot of you all is not true. If anyone,
>I'm the one who became jaded at a previous time...
>8) Being jaded makes you realize who your true friends are... which is a
>good thing to know.

Being jaded usually puts things into a perspective that justfies your
actions inactions.  It doesn;t necessarily reveal anything other than your
own truth which was there all along.

>9) Drugs can steal your soul, perception of reality, and watching alot of
>your friends, and in some cases yourself, lose themselves in a false
>world, really fucking makes you want to sober up.

Megan has gone over this one, and I agree with her (That's JSL's Megan that
is.)

>10) Not everyone loses their shit on drugs, PLUR, DRAMA, all that shit.

This was off of IDM - given the recent "this conveys how old I am"
conversations, and I believe these two goofuses below were mentioned, I
thought some people would get a kick out of it, and some people might
actually give it a go...  Gotta admit, it would be funny as hell...

Hope you all are doing well...  I'm taking care of some carpal tunnel and

       there's a conspiricy going on,

  you ask them, What do you have, the worlds smartest cat?
  then they just smile and give you a knowing wink,

Hahaha.. *:)

I swear I've seen my cat UNIX breakdancing on the lunoleum a few times
when I think someone has broken into my house and turned on the stereo.
But no.. it's UNIX... I don't let him know i'm watching tho. He's pretty
good on his back paws too.. and they speak English so well.... but I don't
think I have to worry about him being apart of this conspiracy.... but I
could be wrong. 

I post messages that are pretty out-there... and no one ever responds. :)
I guess I'm living in my own world and becoming more and more aware of it.

The Darwin Awards
_________________

Jason Hunt originally brought the Darwin Award to our attention after
I had given a lecture claiming that many human behaviours are
established over the history of our species and our cultures, not just
the history of the individual.  Skinner's point on this issue was that
behaviours are selected by their consequences in the same fashion as
any other traits are "stamped in" and "stamped out" through natural
selection.

And as Jay pointed out, if useless or foolish physical features are
elimated from the gene pool as some individuals die off, then it makes
sense that some of the stupid human *behaviours* can become less
frequent as the useless and foolish individuals "remove themselves"
from any hope of breeding.

This year's Darwin Award winning story is a little more, um, tasteless,
compared to last year's story about the guy who rocketed his car into a
cliff. It's yucky, but it's true.
***********************************************************************
Newest Darwin Award Winners!!

As you may already know, THE DARWIN AWARDS are bestowed every year
upon (the remains of) that individual, who through single-minded self-
sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the
human gene pool. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed when
he attached a JATO (Jet Assisted Take Off) unit to his Chevy Impala and
promptly shot himself at 300 mph into the side of a desert cliff.

And now, for this year's illustrious winner(s): . . .

John Pernicky and friend Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington,
decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the Amphitheater; the
Gorge at George, Washington. Having no tickets (but 18 beers between
them) they sat in the parking lot, and after finishing the beer,
decided that it would be easy enough to hop over the nine-foot high
fence and sneak into the show.

The two friends pulled their pickup truck over to the fence and the
plan was for John -- 100 pounds heavier than Sal -- to hop over, and
then assist his friend over the fence. Unfortunately for John, there
was a 30 foot drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved
himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was
abruptly halted by a large branch which snagged him by his shorts.

Dangling from the tree, with one arm broken, John looked down and saw
a group of bushes below him. Figuring the bushes would break his fall,
John removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to
free himself from the tree. When finally free, John crashed below into
Holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his entire body and now being
without his shorts, he was the unwilling victim of a holly branch
penetrating his rectal cavity. To make matters worse, his pocket knife
proceeded to fall with him and landed three inches into his left thigh.

Seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, Sal decided to throw
him a rope and pull him to safety. However, weighing about 100 pounds
less, he decided the best course of action would be to tie the rope to
the pickup truck. This is when things went from bad to worse.

In his drunken state, Sal put the truck into the wrong gear, pressed
on the gas, and crashed through the fence, landing on and killing his
friend. Sal was thrown from the truck, suffered massive internal
injuries and also died at the scene.

Police arrived to find a pickup truck with its driver thrown 100 feet
from the vehicle and upon moving the truck, a half naked man, with
numerous scratches, a holly stick up his rectum, a knife in his thigh,
and a pair of shorts dangling from the tree branches 25 feet in the
air.

In response to the question: Hi Folx, I'm forwarding this from a seperate
list. Anyone been to one of these?  Any good?  Bye Nathan

Future Primitive Soundsession is a must if you are into any kind of real
beat hapnin' and or true propper talent.  It's not a new thing, FPSS comes
off hard as a one off, rotating the party from venue to venue with no set
schedule.  FPSS has even kicked off a indi label of the same name, the first
press is  Cut Chemist vs. Shortkut.  Anyone who saw that set live knows how
intense it was, and the crowd was even recorded live through the needle on
the deck.  KUSF has given it good airplay lately.  FPSS will blow your mind,
cut chemist is the masta (check the article on him by DJ Anna in the new
issue of sweater magazine), DJ's quest/disk/peanut butter
wolf/charloette/anna/felix the dog = propper local talent.  Below, the specs
are listed.

check it out.

well, i decided to post to the thread.

my suggested drug for you all is honey.  for those of you who don't know
it, honey is "god-approved speed".  

a tablespoon of honey will keep your ass shakin' like a triple shot mocha.

further experimentation shows... the ever famous "Honey Bear" bottles
[available at your local grocery store] provides an excellent dispenser for
said honey [and it's *refillable*].

just think of all the energy in bees.  they transfer that shite right into
the honey [not necessarily a fact... but it's how i like to look at it]..
further more, have you ever seen bees in the hive?  they come in, and tell
the rest where the pollen is... by dancing.  shakin' their rump... the rest
of them just check him out, and head on off for the party.

This is a call for proposals for a SFRaves project.  We have so many
wonderfully talented, gifted, and giving people on this list; I'm sure
that all our creative energy could create something beautiful!  There are
people on this list really involved in the dance scene, others are on
the perimeter, and still more that are outside looking in.  

Let's discuss...

Actually, regardless of whether anyone told these people to rise 
above racisim, or British opression, both of them did do just that in 
their own way. Both Martin Luther King Jr. and Gahndi showed how to 
'rise above' the opression they were facing, and by example they 
showed what the world would be like if we could all rise above the 
mistrust and bigotry that is out there.

Just putting my $0.02 in.

I'm gettin' pretty sick of 1015 Folsom, but Millenium Trance looks like it
will be a great party with a special vibe not normally seen in 1015.  Is
anyone from the cupertino/south bay area going?  If you'd like to carpool,
leave me a voice mail with contact info at 408-553-8072.

Saying you can never understand my personal experiences has nothing to do
with intelligence.  I would never try to say I understand what it is like
to be a man.  I can be sympathetic to men; I cannot say I understand what
it means to be one.  Sorry if I offended anyone with this comment.  I just
don't expect people to have empathy in areas which it is impossible for
them to.

Foolish Fish, 

why did you see Megan's comment as an attack on men (or you?)?  She never
implied anything about "intellectual inferiority".

I will never understand what it is like to be a woman, or black, or latino,
etc., as I was born a white male, and grew up with all its advantages.  That
does not preclude me, or others like me, from learning about the oppression
of other groups in our society, such that we don't add to that oppression.

And why is it that the only comment you have is that you feel insulted.
What do you think about the rest of the content in this thread? 

Kerry

I think the point she was making was more on the lines of "Until you walk a
mile in my shoes...".  And the statement says nothing about the
intellectual vigor of men.

Men will never know (until there is something like Brainstorm) for instance:
-What menstruation feels like
-what giving birth feels like.
-A myriad of other things women feel that men are completely unaware of due
to the fact of lack of experience.

And there's more...

Anyway, times are a changing and the time will come when societies will not
be dominated by the male paradigm.  Personally, I can't wait.  And I am by
no means a feminist.

Peace,
John

Gawd,

I hate the oversimplification of MLK and Ghandi.  I tell you this much for
all that non-violent demonstration:  MLK was turning the corner and began
to think, right before he was assainated, that non-violence is only part of
the solution and it may become necessary at some time to revert to more,
active means of protest (read violence).

Also Ghandi had serious problems with the place of women in society, and
did little about the plight of females in his country.

These men were not gods, they were just people whos time and ideas had
come.  They were not above the predjudices, and the mores of thier times.

Peace,
John

Oopsie!  It looks like a lot of people misunderstood my post.  Hey ladies...
I am a girl, I am totally down for equal rights.  I think that when people
have those views (seriously have those views) they are way out of line and
ignorant.  I was just pointing out that it was a joke.  I don't think that he
meant anything by it, so I'm not offended.  If I thought that he was
seriously trying to be sexist by posting that, then I would be offended!  I
am just as into fem-rights as the next girl BUT, I'm not a fem-nazi.  I
completely agree... fem jokes are just as out of line as racist joke but
there was no harm meant so I'll let it go.  I was just stating my opinion,
that is how I handle things.  You can only fight so many fights in life, make
the fights you choose worth while.  Do you think that any race would get
anywhere if they fought everyone for every little racist joke that was told.
 No, they fight the big fights and let the little ones go.  
     Hey, I am not trying to offend anyone. I just didn't see the joke as
that big of a deal.  If anyone disagrees that is completely fine!  We are all
our own person and we all have our own opinions.  Something that offends one
person might not offend the next.  Our diversity is what I love about us!
 Disagreeing is alright, its fighting that stinks!  I love you all
(equally!!!)  Until next time!

                             Hugs and Sloppy Kisses to you all!!!-

And who are they arrestin'?  African Americans in record numbers, that's

At least this free African American man got to see the blue angels.  Cool

What the hell is a fem-nazi?  I know that bubbling, bungling idiot Rush
Limbaugh used that term to label anyone who beleived in women's rights as
such.  Don;t let big media, and big fatheads like Limbaugh invade your
wordspace.  fem-nazi label is rubbish.


>  I
>completely agree... fem jokes are just as out of line as racist joke but
>there was no harm meant so I'll let it go.

and where does it stop?  When do you stop and say enough is enough.  I for
one do not tell jokes about people's sex, race, creed, etc.  I hated the
round of "dumb blonde" jokes etc.  Basically I don't tell jokes since they
are always at the cost of someone else.

(NOTE:  I know some of you will ask the question, "How come it is okay for
blacks to call each other the "N" word, homosexuals can call thier own
"f*gs", etc.  well Chris Rock said it best "The reason is the same reason
that you can call your child dummy, but it is not ok for someone else to do
it."  Simple.)

There is one thing for a woman to tell a joke about women, men about men,
balcks about blacks, etc.  and to me that is fine.  But the second you
start crossing lines I find it patently offensive and wrong (I for one ,
when I had calbe would watch in amazement and disgust as some Def Jam
Comedy hour made fun of whites ad nauseum...).

So until we progress as a species, I think jokes should be told only by
those qualified to do so (see above and think of Chris Rock's words).

>I was just stating my opinion,
>that is how I handle things.  You can only fight so many fights in life, make

A matter of choice, but I would also say as a Jew and African American,
silence = death.


>Do you think that any race would get
>anywhere if they fought everyone for every little racist joke that was told.

Yes we have gotten somehwere becuase these jokes are now considered in bad
taste if told by anyone other than a black person.  It is due to the
struggles of black people that the society at large will cringe when racism
is at it's most overt.  So yes, I do think that becuase we have become
sensitized to race issue sthat we have gone far in our realtions with each
other.  And yet, there is so much more to do.

> No, they fight the big fights and let the little ones go.

wrong.  You fight the fights that need fighting.  Some will be little, like
sitting in the front of the bus, others will be large, like boycotting the
entire bus system.

>     Hey, I am not trying to offend anyone. I just didn't see the joke as
>that big of a deal.

and others did.  So i think that would give anyone pause to reflect.
Something I *had* to come to grips with was my own sexism.  For instance,
there wasd this raging fight going on SFR between two guys.  I sent out a
post that said something to the effect "Are you girls done?".  Leslie Ayers
called me on it, and I was silent about it for a *long* time.  I had to
come correct after some deep reflection and made a general apology to the
list.  Yes, it was something I considered a joke, and to me it was small.
But Les called me on it and I had to reflect, and talk to others about what
I said.  Although it took time I started to see the other side and had to
admit that it was a sexist thing to say. I think I have become a btter
person for it.  All from one little thing.

>If anyone disagrees that is completely fine!  We are all
>our own person and we all have our own opinions.  Something that offends one

You often cannot have both for the same price.

Lets get some headzzz together and put out a magazine. It will be like
sfRaves, but hopefully less spam. I got lots of interest in magazines.  I
enjoy taking pictures of all kinds of things from our scene. From the kick
ass parties to the Bay Area chill spots with the kick-ass views. Maybe
something without adds?  Even black and white, words are cool too. A real mag
about the Bay and only the Bay? FeeD Meeee

I know it took me forever to get back on the list... But here I am... 
Still Merstefi... But now I am at hotmail... (sounds kinda kinky to me.)  
I missed you all so very much, and for those of you who don't live in 
the Southbay... I moved! I am now a new resident of Cupertino and 
attendee of the regular Wednesday night Slow Roasted at City Espresso. 
(Those who go probably see me there sometimes...)

And happy happy... I just got a new car. Well, not really new, but it's 
new to me. I'm trying to decide what to name it. It's an '83 blue 
Mustang, so any of you who know me and have a creative name, please drop 
me an email at merstefi@hotmail.com. 

And hey, drop me an email anyhow... I miss you guys! I haven't been to a 
party since True Love! (not counting that little pop-by at Sunset at the 
Berkeley Marina.) Mostly that's because I got a job at Whole Foods on 
Stevens Creek... It's nice to have money coming in again. And for those 
wondering, me and Cracked-Out Elmo Matt are still maintaining our crazy 
relationship.

Ta ta for now. It's good to be home again.

Well, all you happy (and sometimes not so happy) raver children.... I got
 many wonderful little responses to my movie/get to know each other nite
post, and i am really looking forward to meeting all you guys that can come.
 It will be good to meet the faces behind the letters, and clear the air a
little...  : ) right?
Anyways, it looks like about 15-18 people responded, and that will be good.
 If anyone wants to bring along some friends or anything, you can too.  I was
thinking about next friday night, the 17th.  If there are too many wonderful
things happening that night, let me know and we will reschedule.  But i
looked at the calendar, and it seems to be mostly weeklies lately anyways.
 No UG's are on the horizon are they?
Like i said, i live on Haight street in SF, and if there aren't any
complaints on the date, why dont we say 8:30 or 9pm? 
My address is #1338 (no apt #)  , it is above the Emerald Triangle (a head
shop), and it is painted reddish / yellowish, and beween Masonic and Central.

If anybody needs directions coming into SF, or to get to Haight street let me
know.  I am working on saturday, but not till late, so if there is someone
coming in from out of town and doesn't want to drive back that nite, you can
crash at my house.
Just bring whatever you want to share, music, movies, drinks, food, pillows
(to sit on), yerself, etc... you get the idea-  to bring together the group,
and to get a good vibe going again... We need that sometimes, and there
hasn't been enough of it lately.  We all seem pretty scattered...  It's all
El Ninos fault!!!   =  )~ .........
anyways, i hope to see you all there...: )

right on.  anyone who wants to do this, let's set up a meeting time and
place.  we can all bring some articles, some pictures, some this and that.
scare up a few ads.

who's interested and where and when would it be convenient to meet?  i
suppose we could do it at my place here in berkeley, but i know it might be
out of the way.  maybe someplace in SF?

but for anyone who's seriously interested
you can contact me at (510) 845-2164

Well, all you happy (and sometimes not so happy) raver children.... I got
 many wonderful little responses to my movie/get to know each other nite
post, and i am really looking forward to meeting all you guys that can come.
 It will be good to meet the faces behind the letters, and clear the air a
little...  : ) right?
Anyways, it looks like about 15-18 people responded, and that will be good.
 If anyone wants to bring along some friends or anything, you can too.  I was
thinking about next friday night, the 17th.  If there are too many wonderful 
things happening that night, let me know and we will reschedule.  But i 
looked at the calendar, and it seems to be mostly weeklies lately anyways.
 No UG's are on the horizon are they?
Like i said, i live on Haight street in SF, and if there aren't any 
complaints on the date, why dont we say 8:30 or 9pm? 
My address is #1338 (no apt #)  , it is above the Emerald Triangle (a head 
shop), and it is painted reddish / yellowish, and beween Masonic and Central.
     
If anybody needs directions coming into SF, or to get to Haight street let me 
know.  I am working on saturday, but not till late, so if there is someone 
coming in from out of town and doesn't want to drive back that nite, you can 
crash at my house.
Just bring whatever you want to share, music, movies, drinks, food, pillows 
(to sit on), yerself, etc... you get the idea-  to bring together the group, 
and to get a good vibe going again... We need that sometimes, and there 
hasn't been enough of it lately.  We all seem pretty scattered...  It's all

Yeah, I'm way down to help out.
I've been doing graphics design/ layout for years. I'd love to do some work
on the sfraves mag.

one prob though: how is a project this size  going to get organized? I
think someone (with a lot of free time on their hands) should volunteer to
be the project coordinator, and we'll go from there.

I forwarded this message to the board, because i wasn't sure about giving
instructions from davis.  I would guess,  coming in from Hwy 80 would be the
best way to do it.  It goes thru the bay bridge.  And then go down market
street till Haight, turn right on haight, and keep going up to Central
street-  maybe 15 or 20 blocks-  it will be on the right coming from Market
Street....

See ya there!!!
bye, Maya

     hi all
     I believe it's a good idea. A few days ago, i ask the people to sent 
     me some pics from the raves., but there was only one response.
     i like to create a section on my webpage (www.mehlem.com) for the 
     united ravers all over the world (s.f., munich, helsinki and what 
     else), with a focus on the bay area (my favourite place, and the 
     people i love). with txt.files, picz, soundz and actuall events.
     
     At my Webpage i have 5 MB space. I like to use for pictures a wavelet 
     compression. That makes the picz much smaller. I can use this page 
     commercial. So we can put some commercials on it, when we need (to get 
     money for a printed non-profit magazine). 
     
     I have a Digital Camera to take picz (i take a lot of picz from the 
     summer of love, i put them today on my webpage).
     
     And at last, i work as a Graphics Design Engineer, so i have all tools 
     (and i use them): photoshop, 3dmax, pagemaker, illustrator, macromedia 
     director and flash. I have also experiences in webdesign and 
     development (based on real projects).
     
     I hope we can start now :-)
     
     
     with all my love
     h.p.m. - l.i.s.
     www.mehlem.com

Yeah, I'm way down to help out.
I've been doing graphics design/ layout for years. I'd love to do some work 
on the sfraves mag.
     
one prob though: how is a project this size  going to get organized? I 
think someone (with a lot of free time on their hands) should volunteer to 
be the project coordinator, and we'll go from there.

I've never owned an mc-303 myself, but they seemed to appear in the
'drum machines' section in the music magazines for sale a couple of
months after they came out. I gathered that they weighed more heavily on
the 'sample' rather than 'synthesis' based music production. 

I can certainly one when I hear one, they sound more metallic and guitar
like, I think.

If I bought such in hardware, I would buy a 308, which is manufactured
in germany, or get a soft synth like an rb-338 which seem to be *much*
more fun. I personally prefer my rubber duck, some vaz, and an
orangator!

In reference to all the recent parties held in Oakland............

Wouldn't it be nice if the San Francisco underground music scene could 
have parties held in San Francisco? Just a wild, crazy thought.

Did anyone pick up the flyer describing The Gathering's purpose on 
Saturday night? It was really powerful, especially after Jeno's set. 
Can anyone else relate?

in light of the recent posts, i'm gonna put in my public two cents here...

i had send foolish fish a personal post when i first read his "joke"
(which, call me obtuse or something, i didn't get as funny in the first
place)....

my viewpoint is that the offensive thing was asking if hookers do dishes
and laundry (or whatever it was) like "regular girlfriends"....

for those who don't know, foolish fish is a very articulate, sensitive,
kind-hearted guy who, in my experience, has never said anything like this
before, and i franky wrote it off to a weird lapse of consciousness (had i
been there in person, i would have thrown cold water on him or something,
know what i mean??)

because the fact is..... there is no such thing as a "regular girlfriend"
job description .... and it annoys the hell out of me when i see the
"elders" in the world, who ought to know better, rehashing the old
"programming" that we've all worked so hard to eliminate from our
society....

i have a 19-year old daughter and the thought that she'd be subjected to
this idiotic subliminal suggestion that she's supposed to do her
boyfriend's laundry and cooking pisses me off big-time!!!  nor do i think
that her boyfriend is supposed to be the driver of the car, or the killer
of the bugs in the house, or the other archaic notions that we have got to
learn to get rid of!!!

and, since i'm posting publicly now, too .... i'll tell you that i also
told foolish fish this morning that, though the blind man and the elephant
story is one that i use and remember often to remind myself that two people
may see different sides of the same thing ..... and that both visions are
fully valid ....  to me, if you're calling yourself the "misunderstood
elephant," you gotta realize it's cuz you stuck your stinky ass out as
someone approached...  that's what "put your best foot forward" means ...
show people the best possible side of yourself...  we aren't perfect, but
we can at least be aware.

what bothers me most is when i hear jokes/statements that put some limited
expecations on entire groups of people ... i.e., "regular girlfriends" do
your laundry... that's crap, and we all know it...  i'm not a prude, and
i'm not easily offended, and i don't care if someing is joking about what
hookers do, but making jokes that potentially make suppositions about all
women is too small-minded for me.

one more thing .... if your idea about whether a joke is offensive or not
depends on who's in the room (i.e., a racist joke about african-americans
is somehow acceptable if there are/aren't blacks in the room?!?!  and i
don't care if the story-teller is black or white) ... then you'd best think
again.  if your "joke" ain't so funny if someone overhears it, then maybe
it ain't so funny.  and if it's truly funny ... and even if it still
contains some racist or sexist humor ... then maybe it *is* really funny,
and we should get up the courage to say so.

So to me, it's not about being "politically correct," it's about respecting
people and not trying to make jokes about those things that others use to
oppress them.  But if it's respectful *and* it's funny ... go for it!

actually, i got an email at work that, to me, is hysterical, and i'll post
that in a minute....

so that's it, love, leslie

well, somebody call me if this actually looks as if it might go
somewhere. we tried to do something of this sort for the
central/southern states - got as far as designing a system for the
thing before someone actually believed me when i said that we'd need
money to publish it....

it's a fantastic thought... i'd love to be involved (still have the
old template that was never used) but putting out a magazine is more
than a full time job... a hell of a lot of work, and the first few
years would be extremely expensive. don't forget who you'd need - a
staff of writers, editors and proofreaders, designers, and if you're
thinking of funding this through advertising, you'd need some really
good ppl people. sales reps. and then come up with a media
kit/proposal, research printers and papers, yadda yadda yadda. anyway,
i probably have the knowledge and skills to do something like this, so
hey! if it takes off, or if ppl are serious about it, write me!

 cheers - e. :)

To me, this is hysterical, I was ROTFLOL!  Out of the mouths of babes (yep,
there's some sexist stuff that hopefully these kids will un-learn as they
grow ... but there's some gems in here!)

----------------------------------
Questions about love, marriage and sex were posed to kids
ages 5 to 10. Their answers below are enlightening:

WHAT IS THE PROPER AGE TO GET MARRIED??
"Eighty-four! Because at that age, you don't have to work
anymore, and you can spend all your time loving each other in
your bedroom."  (Judy, 8)
"Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find me a
wife!"  (Tom, 5)
WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE??
"On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that
usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date."
(Mike, 10)
WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE??
"You should never kiss a girl unless you have enough bucks to
buy her a big ring and her own VCR, 'cause she'll want to
have videos of the wedding."  (Jim, 10)
"Never kiss in front of other people. It's a big embarrassing
thing if anybody sees you. But if nobody sees you, I might be
willing
to tryit with a handsome boy, but just for a few hours."  (Kally, 9)

THE GREAT DEBATE: IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED??
"It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need
somebody to clean up after them!"  (Lynette, 9)
"It gives me a headache to think about that stuff. I'm just a
kid. I don't need that kind of trouble."  (Kenny, 7)
CONCERNING WHY LOVE HAPPENS BETWEEN TWO PARTICULAR PEOPLE
"No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to
do with how you smell. That's why perfume and deodorant are
so popular."  (Jan, 9)
"I think you're supposed to get shot with an arrow or
something, but the rest of it isn't supposed to be so painful."
(Harlen, 8)
ON WHAT FALLING IN LOVE IS LIKE
"Like an avalanche where you have to run for your life."
(Roger, 9)
"If falling in love is anything like learning how to spell, I
don't want to do it. It takes too long."  (Leo, 7)
ON THE ROLE OF GOOD LOOKS IN LOVE
"If you want to be loved by somebody who isn't already in
your family, it doesn't hurt to be beautiful."  (Jeanne, 8)
"It isn't always just how you look. Look at me. I'm handsome
like anything and I haven't got anybody to marry me yet."
(Gary, 7)
"Beauty is skin deep. But how rich you are can last a long
time."  (Christine, 9)
CONCERNING WHY LOVERS OFTEN HOLD HANDS
"They want to make sure their rings don't fall off because they
paid good money for them."  (Dave, 8)
CONFIDENTIAL OPINIONS ABOUT LOVE
"I'm in favor of love as long as it doesn't happen when 'The
Simpsons' is on television."  (Anita, 6)
"Love will find you, even if you are trying to hide from it. I
have been trying to hide from it since I was five, but the girls
keep finding me."  (Bobby, 8)
"I'm not rushing into being in love. I'm finding fourth grade hard
 enough."  (Regina, 10)
 THE PERSONAL QUALITIES NECESSARY TO BE A GOOD LOVER
"One of you should know how to write a check. Because, even
if you have tons of love, there is still going to be a lot of
bills."  (Ava, 8)
SOME SUREFIRE WAYS TO MAKE A PERSON FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU
"Tell them that you own a whole bunch of candy stores."
(Del, 6)
"Don't do things like have smelly, green sneakers. You might
get attention, but attention ain't the same thing as love."
(Alonzo, 9)
"One way is to take the girl out to eat. Make sure it's
something she likes to eat. French fries usually works for me."
(Bart, 9)

HOW CAN YOU TELL IF TWO ADULTS EATING DINNER AT A RESTAURANT ARE IN LOVE?
"Just see if the man picks up the check. That's how you can tell if
he's in love."  (John, 9)
"Lovers will just be staring at each other and their food will
get cold. Other people care more about the food." (Brad, 8)
"It's love if they order one of those desserts that are on fire.
They like to order those because it's just like how their hearts
are...on fire."  (Christine, 9)
WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHEN THEY SAY "I LOVE YOU"
"The person is thinking: Yeah, I really do love him. But I
hope he showers at least once a day."  (Michelle, 9)
HOW A PERSON LEARNS TO KISS
"You learn it right on the spot when the gooshy feelings get
the best of you."  (Doug, 7)
"It might help to watch soap operas all day."  (Carin, 9)

WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?
"It's never okay to kiss a boy. They always slobber all over
you...That's why I stopped doing it."  (Jean, 10)
HOW TO MAKE LOVE ENDURE
"Spend most of your time loving instead of going to work."
(Tom, 7)
"Don't forget your wife's name...That will mess up the love."
(Roger, 8)
"Be a good kisser. It might make your wife forget that you
never take out the trash."  (Randy, 8)

i guess i don't see them, or any other person who has chosen to stand
up for *human* rights, as having risen above (in the context that
glitter princess was writing) their situation. they fought it. and
that's the only was to instigate change. whether it's violent or non,
standing up for your rights as a person means to fight for your space
in the world. no one will hand it to you. well, maybe if you're a
wealthy wasp male, and even then, not always.

i brought these ppl up (as well as susan b anthony, who failed to make
it further in this discussion about _sexism_) only because they are
well-known to the masses for their struggles. to me it really doesn't
matter how a person stands up - if they do they are far ahead of so
many in our society.

yes... well, here we are again. the rights of a man, no matter what
his race, will always be seen as being more important than a woman's.
this was really one of the biggest points i was trying to make - that
this is such a hypocritical scenario. and even the fact that who ever
chose not to include women who have struggled in the remainder of this
discussion only drives that point in further.

nobody is.  (i'd be pretty wary of anyone who thought (s)he was!)

and just to conclude my participation in this thread - i think that
everything has been said - some of us are more aware of the present
injustices than others (i say, give them time!) my own reaction to
injustice is a passive one - kerry will back me up when i say that i
am no anarchist - i believe in working with, as much as possible, the
current system to  instigate change... although there are certainly
times when this is not possible. having grown up in a household of
liberal democrat media goons, i'm a firm supporter of using our rights
(such as publishing your views to educate others) or even abusing them
as much as possible. i'm probably a lofty idealist who witnessed a
whole lot of violence in my hometown in the early 70's and i'm really
not sure if i believe it was the right way to approach change. okay,
so i'm a whimp. i went to a counter-kkk rally once in phila and when
the cops pulled out their billy clubs i was off, back to the safety of
my own apartment. but we need those who will stand up physically, as
much as we need those who fight in more non-violent ways. it is with
the combination of these methods - violence, education (through
alternative media, through community outreach) that change will be
made. if we don't have anyone who can work within the current system,
i really don't see how much could be accomplished. but that's mho. 

anyway, it's good to see the few people who are aware stand up and try
to educate those who are not. so, in the words of the raver, props to
you, john (and i must say that i'm pleased to see you come around on
this issue), megan, kerry, leslie, and who ever else there was who
stood up on this. hopefully there was at least some growth from this
*discussion* (hello - not an argument!)

cheers - e. :)

heya fish! (duane?) gosh, this thread has gone so far from where it
started... i wouldn't feel offended or anything! i just wanted to
reitrerate what kerry wrote here - with a little story. (okay, so i'm
putting off work this morning) i lived in phila in 88, and at that
time i was involved with the brainwashing cult known as n.a.. anyway,
a friend of mine took me to a meeting in germantown - a really
frightening area of phila (first time i saw someone standing on the
street with a sawed off shot-gun)... needless to say, (i'll start with
a discription of myself: small, thin, super-wasp girl with a sheltered
upbringing) i was the only white person in this meeting of about 200
ppl. there were quite a few stares, and quite a few people who felt it
necessary to bash the white race and blame us for just about
everything. to say that i was uncomfortable would be an extreme
understatement. so i shared this with my friend, who responded " now
you know what i feel like all the time." wow. i consider myself pretty
liberal and open minded, but i could have never imagined feeling like
such an unwanted, even hated outsider.  just becasue of the color of
my skin. no one would even give me a chance - because i was white i
was the enemy.  i can't imagine feeling this way all the time.! so in
that vein - i am white, upper-middleclass, educated, liberal, with a
whole lot of advantages. i get pissed because just because i'm
priveledged in some ways, it is almost always over looked that i'm
first a woman who has to deal, everyday, with sexism. i never feel as
uncomfortable as i did that day in germantown, perhaps because i'm
quite used to my situation at age 30. but people don't see sexism in
the same way as they do racism. it's much more covert, you know? and
*so* imbedded in our ways of thinking, acting, dealing. it goes beyond
race - it is far deeper than that, and shows itself in all cultures.
but aside from that, i will never really know what it's like to be a
racial minority, to have racial slurs shouted at me (my favorite
sexist one? "hey baby, i wish that bicycle seat was my face")....  nor
will i ever really understand the all of priveledges that people
assume i have because i'm white. i'm still female. and i think that
was all both megan and kerry were trying to say. a man could never
understand, really, the implications of being female. we are
socialized (or programmed?) from such an early age - this is how we
should be, how we should act, talk, what we should wear, how we should
look, this is what we should do, who we should marry, and it goes on
and on. and we have to do it perfectly, you know. the other thing that
i don't think men can understand is the insecurity and fear that comes
with being female. it's no one's fault, and it's not a bad thing that
you won't understand. but the rate of rapes and abuse is so high, and
at least for me, this is something that's always at the back of my
mind. i learned at a very early age that the world is not such a safe
place for women. but you know, it's just life. and there are benefits
to being female too - wouldn't trade it for the world!

time to get some work done! - e. :)

There was mention in the Chronicle on Saturday that all permits for the 2nd
& Jackson space had been suspended due to noise complaints from Alameda,
across the water from the site. One Alameda woman who was quoted seemed
more concerned with the health & safety of ravers who danced all night,
seeming to think that was a sign of obvious self abuse.

The permit officer mentioned that when he checks up on parties he makes
sure his daughter isn't among the attendees. Apart from that he didn't give
the impression he was opposed to the events, just that the bass being 'real
high' was causing problems.

Would you forsake the truth being spoken or withheld because the speaker was
not "qualified" to do so? How does one define "jokes"?
Sounds like a dangerous position to be in when one has to define "qualified".
Race is a mixed (human) bag by default, and culture is gained by experience,
sooooo.. this leaves one in a quandry when there needs to be someone who
defines the criteria to be approved and then approve those that need to police
the statements made.
I know that you are only illustrating an example (and, it seems to me,
advocating personal responsibility); but chris rock's statement addresses a
valid point successfully, but your point is scary in that it limits discovery
(either through humor or otherwise) of information to certain people who have
been deemed qualified to speak on the matter.

Some religious, scientific, and political examples of those changing the way
people think who were not deemed qualified:

1) Mohammad - The Islamic Faith
2) Malcom X - Political and Spiritual upliftment (and boy, did he realize
mistakes he had made after his pilgrimmage..)
3) Jesus Christ - as if we hadn't heard enough about this guy...
4) Galileo - Told that his views were unnacceptable by the church, yadda,
yadda, yadda...

The bottom line, I guess is this: Jokes are generally based on generalities
(pun semi intended) and therefore very rarely worth the insight they may
bring. It is tempting to categorize them as "editable statements" that are not
worthy to keep and reflect on (whether they are derogatory or not), but there
are times when thoughts or statements that are truly funny (and which reflect
on the human experience in an apparent worthwhile manner) are made by people
who have no background (or obvious authority) are extremely worthwhile to the
human species.

Short of it: Let's be careful about censorship recommendations.

Subject: Party Review, Trance Millenium!!
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

Not having been sparked by a party in a long time, it is my immense
pleasure to actually write a party review (how long has *that* been?)

Trance Millenium at 1015 Folsom last night was really amazing.. the CCC and
Hunab Ku and other assorted folks created a beautiful thing from what can
often feel like a dingy and burnt-out club space.... to walk into that
place and find that it's filled with friends and wonderful people who are
there for the music was so great .... there were only a handful of the
"cocktail-in-hand-who-the-
heck-are-these-people-in-the-psychedelic-clothes?" club crowd there.
mostly it was tried and true goa-heads, trance fans and the familiar party
folks.

The main room was Goa Gil (who, even though i'm not usually a goa-head, had
me under his control for blocks of time when i had to dance like a maniac)
... followed by CEIBA live.

upstairs (where it used to be outside) was an absolutely insane room, fully
psychedelicized by the CCC folks and playing the oddest and most driving
jungle, and what must be what people are calling "breakbeat trance" which I
am now fully hooked on.

Upstairs was Joe Rice and Ethan (and John Carel after I left maybe?) and
comfy chairs and luxury.

It was never crowded (not good for the promoters, but great for the crowd),
always room to dance and breathe, but plenty of wonderful people there
making a powerful viber.

I only wish it weren't a Sunday night, because this was a party I could
have had fun at for many many hours, but I had to leave by 12:45.  Cursed
9-5 job!

I felt myself competely re-energized about what fun it can be to party, no
hassles, all good, so many friends and smiling faces, what a treat!  More,
please!

Well my Night starts out like any other Party night. I plan on getting
to the party early but you know how ravers are. I needed to make all
these crazy pit stops and stuff. So we end up running on "Raver time"
But we end up at 1015 early enough to catch simon spinning.  He was
playing some good progressive house. Highlight was hearing this house
DJ play Krakpot by Richie hawtin and some other Minimal TeKno tracks.
Then I go to the dub lounge upstairs this DJ was laying down some
funky Dub Sorry I did not get his name :-( Then I walk back to the
main room and I hear this weird tweeky kind of sounds and I instantly
know it is Stacey. He was laying down some Tweeaky Detroit Tekno/Speed
garage/Hardhouse/minimal house Kind of stuff hard to describe but it
was real nice a treat to see him work the 3 decks. He has a very
Unique way of mixing He uses a lot of the EQ and gain controls plus
some other tweaks with the pitch and fader it was nice to see. Then
Super Star DJ Jeno gets on the decks and people like rush to the front
like he is some god. I was suprised cause not as many people crowded
around for Stacey :-(  So Jeno gets on and he must have not slept or
something or was just plain having a bad night cause every mix was off
beat and not buy a little some by a lot, almost of the verge of not
being able to correct it. I know how that goes cause I have had many
of those kind of days. But it is funny how some people Idolize DJ's I
can't wait till they have the surgeon there if ever. He is a treat to
watch if you all ever get a chance you should check him out he has
unique mixing skillzz!!

Peace,
Macadio (Mack-Audio)

Please keep your racist, sexist, and religiously intolerant comments to
yourself. They have no place here( I hope.) Try rewriting it as " well
maybe if you're wealthy..."

For someone that is bitching about equality you seemingly have a lot
to learn. I can't BELIEVE after your previous comments on inequality and
sexism(most of which I agree with) you would have the audacity to
make a comment like the one above. Fighting racism, sexism, religious
persecution, etc. with more of the same is inexcusable as well as doomed
to failure. It makes you no better than the people you decry. 

While you're busy feeling sorry for yourself and taking everyone to task
for their offensive viewpoints take a good hard look at your own.

You said it!

One thing I've noticed about being on SFRaves for about a year now is that
the louder the flame, the greater the chance of hypocrisy buried within it.

one more comment ... (then I may have reached my limit for posting for the
day, yikes!)

John Lee originally said..

....(NOTE:  I know some of you will ask the question, "How come it is okay for
blacks to call each other the "N" word, homosexuals can call thier own
"f*gs", etc.  well Chris Rock said it best "The reason is the same reason
that you can call your child dummy, but it is not ok for someone else to do
it."  Simple.)....


Maybe I'm missing something here  .. but it seems obvious to me that this
is a ironic commentary meant with tongue in cheek, a comment on the irony
of our twisted psyches, and how we excuse our own stupid behavior
sometimes, while condemning others.

Why do I hope this is meant to be ironic???  Because NO PARENT HAS A RIGHT
TO CALL THEIR CHILD A DUMMY.  Period.  I doubt that John actually thinks
it's ok to call his son a dummy, and I hope everyone understands that it is
psychologically damaging and ignorant.  Kids are not there to be the target
of your frustration and insults.  I know that we have been made immune to a
lot of this kind of treatment of children through the media, through tv
that portrays nasty insults as "witty repartee'" but it just isn't funny,
and it isn't right.

This comparison is not at all analogous to why subcultures have their own
"inside" names, words and jokes that aren't really appropriate for
others/outsiders to participate in.  Calling yourself a name is in no way
the same as calling your kid a name.

I guess the true key is whether the derogatory word is meant to put down
and separate the other person, or meant to reaffirm that they are part of
your world, that you consider them your peer, that you stand beside them
against a world that would belittle and mock you all.

Leslie

p.s.  someone took the post about "only those qualified to make jokes" a
little seriously.  i propose that the penalty of taking that joke as if it
were serious should result in a 7-day revocation of your own joke-telling
license.  hand it over.

well you know leslie, if that punishment doesn't suffice, what we always do
is we drill holes in the person's fingernails and hang them off the celing

Hey peoples,

just a quick little post on this one.... I am not sure where all of you are 
going on your weekends but I have only been to one party in oakland in the last
2 months the rest have been in san francisco.  granted these aren't massives
they are underground so often the case is that you don't hear about them till
the day after.

Parties go on in sf all the time just keep your eyes and ears open.

smiles,

herb

Humor is for weak minded humans.

You cannot take away my license.

I never had one.

This stuff you call humor is fabricated, highly offensive and not even
funny.

I have a 26-year old [friend] and the thought that he'd be subjected to
this idiotic subliminal suggestion that he's supposed to have a lot of bucks
to buy her a ring and a VCR pisses me off big-time!!!

What bothers me most is when I hear jokes/statements that put some limited
expectations on entire groups of people ... i.e., that boys need someone to
"clean up after them." Making jokes that potentially make suppositions about
all [men] is too small minded for me.

Sorry for plagiarizing you Leslie, but I just couldn't have said it any
better myself.

Adam

Oh boy, ok I'll attempt to clear this up, although I know this is futile
for this list (we've had this conversation before, many , many times).

I don't.  All I was indicating is that there are words within certain
groups that are meant to be used by those groups.  It may be considered by
those in said groups to consider outsiders use of such words as
derrogatory.  It is not only the message, but the messenger.

Nobody is policing anything.  Here's a test, try using a word that one
group has taken to use as a means of self identification or empowerment
within that group that you are not a part of.  Now watch the reaction.

There are those who are qualified to speak of certain issues and things.  I
for one do not think that someone who has not had the black experience can
write about the black experience.  And yes, there are those who are black
who even by the virtue of thier blackness may or may not be qualified, but
someone outside of the group (i.e. not black), would have a difficult time
in effectively communicating a message about and experience they have never
had.

My point and Chris' are the same.  I feel the way he does about the use of
words, exactly.  It is differnt when Chris rock speaks fo the difference
between Blacks and N's.  Put a different face on it, particilarly one from
a Euro ancestry, and you get an entirely different message.  Or I should
qualify that and say that *I* do (as well as many African Americans). One
reason why Chris isn't instantly labelled a racist when he makes such
distinctions, but others may not be so lucky if they are outside the group
being talked about.

However I did like Lenny Bruce and what he had to say, but the fact that he
was of Jewish descent gave him a different kind of credibility.  He is one
of the opressed, and as such he gets the instant qualifier by many who are
opressed to speak using charged words.  Yes, it's insane, but hey, it's
America.

This may have been true at one time, I would say that the climate has
changed and it is no longer true.  I would cringe at a Jeff Foxworthy (You
know him, the guy who says "You know you're a redneck if..." jokes) started
making jokes about blacks or other minorities.  we are creatures of history
here in this country, and we can never escape that.  The messenger counts.

I didn't say anything about censorship.  You can say whatever you want,
just be prepared for the consequences of your words.  Censorship in this
instance can be a very good thing if not life saving.  think about it.

On a read-read I have to take fuher issue:

Er, there has been a big leap in logic here.  When was the decision made
that jokes are indeed true?  And what is the truth?

Would I forsake the truth being spoken?  Nope.  But let's get real, often
times the truth is often twisted for poltiical or self-satisfying purposes.
Statistics are good for this.  Bell curves notwithstanding.

Do I care as to who tells the truth no, but it rarely happens that way.
Does Rush Limbaugh speak the truth?  Does Farrakhan?  Does Bill Clinton?  I
would say that they all have some truth in what they say, but that is a far
cry from saying that what they say is indeed a fact.  Often times they have
protions of fact mixed with tons of spin and hyperbole.  So that's what I
see.  And I still think the messenger is very important.

David Duke had lots of truth, one can only imagine how much of it was
factual (Who were the welfare mothers he always referred to?).

> How does one define "jokes"?

I don't tell them, so I don't define them.

Peace,

  Hey, so in honor of  Sukkot coming up next week, and the tradition that
you're supposed to sleep under the stars for a week, my temple is having a
camp-out this Friday (the 17th).   I got this crazy idea that maybe we should
set up a little rave tent and have a little party of our own rite here in the
middle of residential Fremont.  (wait.. that's an oxy-moron, everywhere in
Fremont is residential.) NEways... if anyone is interested in this sort of
thing drop me a line and we'll do the camping thing.  =)

             hugs n'stuff,
               Trice the Tekno Diva

I am a bit confused.  To what are you refering?  I read you as taking issue
with the comment that wealthy white males (er, wealthy wasps?) are often in
an advantagous position.  Am I understanding you correctly?  Please
clarify...

> For someone that is bitching about equality you seemingly have a lot...

"Bitching"?  Is it necessary to belittle all Liz has said with this kind of
language (and such a loaded term as well, especially given that this thread
is about sexism...).

"Feeling sorry for [her]self"?  Again, what justifies your belittling of her
thoughts on the topic sexism, or for that matter, her experiences with
sexism?  This comment, too, strikes me as way out of line.

That said, I still don't understand your issue with the above statement.  I
must not have read it the way you did.  How did you read it?

OK, I have been trying to get with what we can expect from Boymerang,
right?  Just like I was trying to figure out what the deal was with the
Trouble on Vinyl posse.

So even if Boymerang flakes at least I have some information yall might be
interested in, my questions on the breaks list answered:


> Boymerang is scheduled to play here on Monday.

> 1) when did he latch onto Metalheadz and is there any cool story
> concerning that?

Actually, I have heard a cool story:  Goldie was at the Blue Note or
somewhere and he heard some Boymerang tune drop and he went bananas.
Called Graham at like 3am and woke him up and was like "man, your tune is
f'in horrible!!" and Graham was like "oh, I'm sorry you don't like it,"
and Goldie's like "nah man, it's terrible, I mean it's terrible!" like
it's the best thing he'd ever heard, you know?  So that was kind of their
introduction, I hear.  Boymerang's been working on an ep for Metalheadz...
it's probably finished by now since it's been rumored to be in the mill
for ages.  And good night, check this out:  last I heard he was scheduled
to put out a remix of Dillinja's "The Angels Fell" on Razor's Edge.  Yo.  

> 3) can I expect him to drop new Metalheadz plates?

Probably...rest assured, although I've not witnessed him live, I
think that whatever he drops is bound to be amazing, metalheadz or no.

I am taking issue with the use of a deregatory term. Let me ask you this:

Would it be acceptable for me to run around using the N word? Why is it
then somehow acceptable to use one deregatory term, but not the other? I
have *NEVER* seen that term (WASP) used in anything but a deregatory
fashion, as was done in this case. It is as distasteful to me as the N
word. 

I have *0* problem with the wealthy part. People with money have doors
opened for them. White, black, protestant, jewish, etc. it matters little.
Money is all green(at least in America.)

I bitch. I am bitching now. I do not mean it in a gender-specific context.

I am not belittling her thoughts on sexism. As I stated I agree with most
of them. However, I do feel comments like (paraphrasing): "The rights of
men will always be looked at as more important than those of women" is
untrue, and self-serving whining. The lot of women in the U.S. has greatly
improved from it's inception, and continues to improve. And it needs to
improve some more. So I view the above statement at about this level:

"But weeeere neeeever going to be eeeequal." (sorry, intonation doesn't
travel well via email.)

Further, you won't get any argument from me that, throughout the world,
women are not treated as equals. Far from it in many cases.

i have a cool ass place in the east bay, Hayward, where a pretty large number
of us could meet on almost any night or day.  We could even play a little
music, its pretty close to Bart also.  It is above some shops and has a large
room that could fit 75 to 100 of us at least.  My buddy is a 50 year old
hippie and said its all good.  Anyone interested e us back...or just let me

having perused all the latest posts on this topic, i think there is
definitely enough energy to go ahead and get this started.

and as Gene said,
>one prob though: how is a project this size  going to get organized? I
>think someone (with a lot of free time on their hands) should volunteer to

>

so here it is:  I VOLUNTEER TO COORDINATE THIS PROJECT.  and I also want to
get as much of your input as possible.

basically, here are my thoughts:

1.  We need to meet and plan.  Maya, would you be interested in combining
the movie night with a planning meeting?  Seeing as you've already
publicized it and given directions, it would probably be a good chance to
get a lot of interested people together in the same location.

2.  We need material.  Anyone who wants to get an article or photo or
whatever published can send them to me.

my vital info:

should be paid, as that's a waste of funds and it should be a labour of

4.  staff.  following positions need to be filled.

EDITORS--good spellers with a sense of what works and what doesn't.

LAYOUT--designers with innovative artistic sensibilities.

how to get it.

CONTRIBUTORS--anyone with an idea and five minutes to get it down on hard
copy.

oh my *gawd*. all right, just as a black man can joke another black
man, a woman another woman, a wasp anoter wasp!  jesus, buddy - do you
not even see that it would be harder for a minority male than it would
be for a white man of the same economic group?  yes, money brings with
it advantages. but it wasn't until recently that a black man could
play golf at the club with his neighbors. and don't forget that race
can affect where you can purchase a house... and there *is* just a
little discrepancy in the number of minorities who actually get
wealthy enough for it to make a difference. ya know?

buddy, i *never* claimed to know all of *anything*. in fact i pointed

well, what _ever_. i've never run into anyone who would get offended
by being called a wasp. i guess i never thought of it as a bad thing.
i mean, that's what i am. it's an acronym, not a name. you will note
that i didn't use the word 'cracker'. what's so terrible about

i never "took everyone to task", nor did i say anything about feeling
sorry for myself. i wrote that the whole thing makes me angry, as does
any sort of human injustice. i also said that there were benefits to
being a woman, and that i wouldn't trade my life for a man's. i posted
my opinion with the hopes of showing glitter princess a different
viewpoint. i don't think i said anything offensive.... 

i would apologise for offending anyone, although it seems to me that
those who do get offended.... well, that would be a flame, so i'll be
off now.

The influx of energy into this idea is great.  A number of people have
mentioned starting up a magazine, which I think is a great idea.  I think
we should open up a discussion on this idea before going too much further,
so that we can get as much creative input as possible. (to paraphrase ben)

I see a need for an archivist to capture the essence of the SF rave scene.
Maybe something like this exists, I dunno.  Regardless, SF Raves is a
large virtual community that is a huge network of information.  The
hyperreal sfraves site saw a big burst of growth, but as of late has
slowed down.  I think we should throw some more energy in this direction,
and create a sfraves webzine.  Perhaps a print based 'zine can come out as
a side product.  A webzine would be easier to produce.  I'm sure we can
find a site to house the 'zine for free.  We have plenty of writers,
artists, poets, trippers, gurus, scientists, coders, dj's, promoters
lurking out in 'net land.  That's what I love about this list, the 
diversity.  Let's start recording the happenings, the raves, the vibes,
all of the energy that's being produced so that posterity can look back
and say, wow so that's what it was like back then; gee we've come a long
way since then.  

So if your interested or have any ideas, dissents, opinions on what we
can/should/have to do speak up.  An aside, I've noticed that compared to
the 60's there doesn't seem to be as much political activism in our
generation.  Why is that?  I'm lazy and selfish.  But I'm trying to change
that, and starting this call for proposals and stuff is my way of taking a
step in the right direction.

So, let's keep the discussion/brainstorming going on the 'zine idea.
Once we get all the interested peeps flushed out we can take it off the
list and keep the rest of you updated.  Where can we get a subgroup
listserv started?

Sunshine on my shoulders,
George

Here's some other ideas I've been thinking of, some of which have been
done before, others fallen by the wayside;

weekly/monthly SF Raves meeting.  Every saturday, Pablo's Sugar Shack at
V/SF has a special sfraves deal going.  How is this doing?  

Ravin' Outreach.  We go to elementary schools and teach kids about
community, dance, and music.  Throw in some "banana's in pajamas" mixed in
with some funky jungle.  Show kids how to let go and boogy, actually let
them show us how to boogy.  I'm not sure how high schools would recieve
this outreach.  Maybe we could throw parties for high school and try our
best to steer them in the right direction.

SFRaves decoration committee.  We start producing various works of art,
visual designs, props and sets for use at parties.  Props and sets
courtesy of SFRaves.  Visuals by SFRaves.  etc.

There's more ideas circulating, but those will stew for now.

You fill up my senses,
George

Um, the history of the term WASP:  an acronym developed by white people
(statisticians in the 1950's I believe, who were working on census data).  It was
not developed as a term of oppression (and I have never seen it used as such-- I
have only seen it use to specify a set of white people, anglo-saxon protestants,
to be exact).  Not quite the same as the other terms of oppression.  Not to
mention the fact that it specifies one of the most privileged classes in this
country (and if you add "wealthy" to it (wwasps), you are indeed specifying the
most privileged class).

It sounds as if you mean to say that given a given economic class, opportunities
are equal regardless of race.  This is patently untrue, so maybe you don't mean
this, but it reads as if you do.  Class is a major factor, one of the biggest in
determining opportunity, but not the only factor.

How you can see phrases like "self-serving whining" and "feeling sorry for
[her]self" as doing something other than belittling Liz is a mystery to me.  Maybe
you see such phrases as constructive? Why do you feel you need to be so
inflammatory?

I have some nice pictures of the camping parties this summer
and i always put my photos on floppy since it only costs an
extra $4 so i can put them in photoshop and play with them.
I often use photo shop to remove the little green men and flying
saucers that get in the way and scew up my photos.

A mag is a very complicated and EXPENSIVE project...several thousand
dollars even for a cheap one. If people have time and money
there is already someone doing this and his first copy was
one of the best magazines ive ever seen. I will post his contact
info and his web sites as soon as i dig them up. Or perhaps
someone else has this info as i know many of you know him.
He is randy, of the one tribe list.

anyway i will be happy to donate my photos and graphics
work and I plan on getting a digital camera around the end of this year.

While it's true that a webzine is easier to produce and costs less, I think
a free hard copy, paper magazine would have a much wider distribution in
the Bay Area and would reach all people who might not take an Internet site
as seriously as a zine...

plus the instantaneous transmission of information--you don't have to wait
for a magazine to download...

of course, the web site and magazine could mirror each other, producing the
best of both worlds--plus a website can have things like audio and video
samples and a continuously updated, evolving-by-the-second product...

I think at this point the purpose of a virtual discussion at this point
should be to get ideas of what shape we want this zine/site to take.
Things to consider:

--do we want an "in-your-face-new-media-hyper-cyber-trendy" approach like
_Wired_ and _XLR8R_ have taken?  or a more traditional approach like
_Lotus_?  or a stripped-down minimalist approach like _Fix_?  all of the
above?  silly question, maybe, but it's just to get people thinking.

--an objective view of the scene, giving equal weight to both sides of any
issue?  or a positive, "this is our happy family please join us" view?

--focus on just SFRaves, or on PLURry candylicious people around the world?

--more good nutritious text or more yummy eye candy?

oh, and most of all:  No Exclusivity.  This is going to be a production of,
by, and for ALL the people.  Full on communism. :)

Ahhh, I see. So, if a woman had made the joke foolish fish had, everything

oh *gawd* yourself.

Racism is racism, sexism is sexism, whomever the mouthpiece. I simply do
not agree with the idea that it is acceptable for people to spout racial
or sexual epitaphs at one another regardless of their inclusion in that
group. 

And unless I am mistaken, you are not a male, so you are making comments
about a group you are not part of. So how are you any different from the
person you are decrying?

No, and by your own logic how would you? Are you a member of the male
species? Are you of what is considered to be a traditional minority group?
How could you understand what it is to be a "white male" in todays
political and social climate?

Agreed.

Not the last time I checked. This is your *PERCEPTION*. It is illegal to
discriminate against tenants or buyers on the basis of race, color,
religion, sex, marital status, physical handicaps, national orgin, or any
other statutes applicable to equal opportunities under the Fair Housing
act. I would never be so foolish as to say that this sort of
discrimination does not occur simply because it is illegal. My
*PERCEPTION* is that this occurs in a minority of cases and is not the
norm.

As doors open, opportunity and sucess follows. The doors have just
recently opened(and continue to do so.) The success is and has been
coming. Changes of this magnitude are not made overnight. Honestly, do you
expect around only 30 years after the beginning of the civil rights
movement there to be a statistically even distribution of wealth in
America? Or anywhere close to it? Most of the wealth in America is *OLD*
money. Passed down and amassed through generations.

One of my experience with that term is from a "joke" book that I saw in
high school. You know the kind of joke book, the one with jokes about
people of various colors, blondes, etc. etc.  

The rest of my experiences with the term is seeing it used time and time 
again to refer to people of that group in a derogatory fashion. I have
never, in my experience, heard it used in a positive fashion or even
netural fashion. There has always been a pointed opinion attached to the
usage.

You took those with a differing opinion than your own with regards to
this subject "to task" in my opinion. 

As far as the "feeling sorry for yourself" comment, it was in response to
your statement to the effect that "the rights of men will always be viewed
as more important than those of women."

As a white male I guess I get to have an unique perspective on things(no, 
I really don't believe that myself, or "white males" are the only people
capable of or do share this perspective, but seeing some of the
attitudes posted here sometimes its hard not to): when I fail at or don't
get something I aspire to, I can only blaim myself. I don't have the
luxury of blaiming others who discriminated against me based on my sex, my
color, or my religion.

If anyone feels the need to flame me, make disparaging remarks, whatever:
as you are busy saying "before you dare make statements about my life as
XXXXX" or "you can't possibly understand until you walk a mile in my
shoes" I ask you to do the same.

This is not the 50's and terms that were acceptable then are not 
automatically acceptable now. I can think of another N word used to refer
to black people that was one step above what they were previously called,
and commonly used in the 50's, but is no more acceptable to me. 

Your experience directly contradicts mine in this regard. I have never
heard thet term WASP used in anything but a derogatory fashion, as it is
was used in the original statement that prompted my response.

Really, you need to define "terms of oppression" more clearly. What is a
"term of oppresion?" Does this mean at one time a majority subjugated a
minority and used terms to refer to those minorities? Or does a "term of
oppression" simply mean that  a group of people were sterotyped and
referred to in a single context, which is what is what prompted my
response?

Class is the overriding factor in my opinion. Given enough money, other

That is my take on the situation. I respect your opinion to disagree.
However, I have given specific reasons as to why I think my statements are 
other than simple belittling. Have you offered any reasoning to the
contrary?

In all fairness to the group, Leslie sent me an email about my post
about ending this thread of postings.
I don't want people to stop if they think that there is something else
that will help others or the group at large. I was posting a particular
point of view about this subject and it should probably be taken with a
grain of salt (especially by those that are really involved in this
debate).

Leslie made some good comments that I think were very relevant to my
post. So read it for the more detailed explanation of my post and the
points she brings up (which I think are very good).

Alrighty then.

Here's to more chaos and enlightenment (hopefully),

Yes. This is true. Ah, the beauty of email and the internet. It plays
well with those that want to take time and reason out their thoughts
before they post and it is also a medium that allows for quick passions
that cannot be erased.
It was rash and ill-thought out. For that, I apologize.
I was erasing all these messages off my machine and this thread had
taken like 30 or so posts. Seemed like a dead-horse issue at this point.
Yep, I entered in the conversation late and then realized that I
shouldn't have. I had an offline conversation with John Lee about this
whole issue (which started w/ my first post) and that is when it hit me,
"why isn't everyone else doing the same?"
So, in haste, after erasing tons of messages, I posted w/o regard to my
involvement as well.

Yeah, but after 30 or so of rehashing the same points, ummm, well, I
really don't know where you should draw the line, but, well,  (as my
stance gets weaker and weaker...).... see above....

I have. The last time you posted it I saved it. I thought it was very
well written and sage-like. It bespoke of wisdom.

Didn't know that. If that is what you hope to accomplish with postings
on this list, then, I agree. All the postings are probably worth it.

Yes, I agree. Changing people for the better is truly worth more than a
discussion on the examples above. I think what it boils down to is this:
The list means particular things to people at specific times. It's like
when  you have a room of 400 people that get together occasionally for
different reasons and suddenly the room becomes dominated by a
discussion that is not relevant to some portion of the room. That
portion of the room will probably speak up and say something like, "Hey,
this topic isn't relevant anymore. Y'all have covered this pretty
thouroughly." etc.This list is really a self governing entity.
In the end, my stance may have been premature, but it was worth posting
if only so those involved would think twice about their next post. If it
is truly relevant (and they feel most passionate about the subject),
well, then be-damned those that are trying to squelch the debate. Hey,
I'm perfectly willing to accept the fate of being ignored.
If the list suddenly is out of touch w/ my wants or needs, then I must
unsub in fairness to the group and myself.

This is true. Being part of this list has been great. (sometimes it is
damn addictive and it gets in the way of work... but, oh well. I chalk
it up to research: How the 'Net can be truly collaborative.) Clients of
ours love to hear about how the 'net is addictive. It makes them feel
like they are spending their money wisely....

:)

http://www.citizenmag.com

p.s. I was talking to Fubari (who hasn't posted in awhile - unsub
victim) of Warmth CD fame, and I was telling him what was going on in
the list. Stuff like this recent rash of listings and I said something
about someone on the list having a 19 year old daughter or something....
he says, "oh, that sounds like Leslie..."
That was so cool. It's so amazing to me when we move beyond text into
the real world of persons and human contact. Makes me feel like there is
hope for this crazy thing called the 'NET.
Anyway, I just thought you'd like to know.
Take care.

nope..it takes more that this to offend me. There
would have to be a deliberate attempt to harm me
for me to be offended and i haven't seen anyone do
that to me.

I was simply pointing out to megan that it is perhaps
a bit unfair to say that men are not capable of understanding 
women or their plight. Being part indian i understand oppression
and abuse...granted its not the same but close.

And i definitely am very much in touch with my past lives as a
woman ...i feel a very strong feminine part of myself and other
women share the feeling with me...yeah i understand sisterhood.

I used to work in a office with women and shared a desk with a women.
every month  i got unbearable cramps to the point of almost passing
out every time the women had their period.

Im somewhat amused at how my making a joke/complaint about
the blue angels (which are mostly men) and their abuse of women
has turned into what it has.

Just for the record i like creative women so i usually do most of the 
domestic work as i feel it much more fun to see her doing artistic
or creative work than wasting her time on  silly stuff like dishes...
plus doing things like the dishes so she has more time
for art is one way i express my love.

Hi everyone! 
I've been off the list for a while now but I had to come back to relay a
message from our good friend Spencer Knowles. He's living in L.A. right now,
aspiring to become the next Christian Slater (or something like that.....)
Anyway, his first step on his way to super stardom is on ....are you ready
for this....THE DATING GAME!!! So, if you kids want to see one of our very
own S.F. ravers on T.V., tune in this Wed, Oct. 15th.  It's on channel 9 in
L.A. He wasn't sure which channel that is up here, but hey, we're smart
kids...I'm sure someone can figure it out.  The time is 10:30 am but, again,
that's in L.A. If someone out there is a big Dating Game fan and could post
when it's on, or whether or not it's the same as L.A., that would be great
:) So, everyone should watch, it should be really funny. I know how he does
but I'm not gonna tell... that would ruin the surprise!  Spencer also wanted
me to tell all of you that he loves and misses you all. If anyone is looking
for him, his number in L.A. is - 
213.954.0737.  His pgr/voice mail is 310.368.5788. Oh, and don't
worry...another Warmth party is in the making.....
As for me....I'm too busy to be getting 100+ pieces of mail every day so I
won't be on the list for long. But, I did want to say hi and that I love you
all. I hope to see you all at Nebula (DJ Dan and Moda...yummy!!) and, of
course all decked out on Halloween either at Tribal Massive or Happy Kids.
What are everyone's plans? Well, until then, I send you all love, hugs, and
of course, lots of smiles....

cricket ;)

Wrong Patrick.  The Clinton Administration just released a study citing
that black applicants are refused for loans far more than any other group.
It's not only the purchase of a house but the aquring of a laon.  Also this
backs up a GAO report citing the same discrimination in loan practices of
major banks to minrotiy housing and businesses.  Race is still a  very real
factor.

The information is there if you know where to look for it.

Subject: My Tree House - BSP + explanation

Just wanted to give folks out there a bit of detailed information about an
upcoming benefit

This Sunday, October 19th, a bunch of very good people have gotten together
to put on MY TREE HOUSE.  This is a benefit for Maitri, a hospice in San
Francisco.  It is (to my knowledge) the only hospice in SF that caters to
triple diagnosis patients, that is people with metal illness, drug
addiction, and HIV.  It is a very cool place, started by a buddhist monk in
the 80s, and now they are doubling in size because the demand for a place
like this is still very high.  Except for the bare minimum costs, all the
proceeds from this event are going directly to Maitri.  No administrative
costs, no profit skimming, just lots of people pitching in for a good
cause.

Anyway, it will be at the Sound Factory, 525 Harrison Street @ 1st, in SF.
Sound Factory is normally closed on a Sunday, so the crowd will be the one
we create.  The party is going to be in the red room area, which will keep
the vibe nice and tight.  Starting DJs are going to be Mouse, Ellen
Ferrato, and Arkay, who are the absolute shit when it comes to deep,
progressive house.  Some time after 1:00am, the drum and bass kicks in with
Tom Thump and Derek.  Visuals by Dionysus Dreams and some bomb video in the
lounge area by our secret special suprise last minute sponsor.

So, this will be a tight party for a good cause.  This will not be a
full-on mega event with a 100,000,000 kilowatt sound system, five different
color lasers, and famous DJs from around the world.  We are not trying to
impress and have kept costs to a minimum, so Maitri gets as much money as
possible.  However, if you are looking for some dope beats and don't mind
giving several of your hard earned dollars ($8 - $15 sliding scale) for a
great cause, then I hope you will come on down and check us out.

Further questions may be directed to this address.  Thanks for your time
and interest.

Well, I was hoping to stay out of this one...

I just recently read an article in the SJ Mercury about how, in Oakland, black and latin loan applicants are turned down for loans twice as often as white or asian applicants.  The article went on to decry the racism that the banks are showing, blah, blah...

What factors decide who gets loans?  Says my Girl who worked for years at an Oakland Wells Fargo branch:  Income, collateral, credit history, cosigners, outstanding debts, years of residence at the same location, length of employment at the same job, and age.  Perhaps I left a few out, but one factor they DON'T consider is SKIN COLOR.  I was turned down for a loan at her branch, it never entered my mind that my application was rejected because I was white and the loan officer (all of them) were black.  I had no credit, why pretend it was personal.

The fact that black and latino applications are turned down more often in Oakland has a lot to do with economic factors that effect an entire area, who happen to be mostly black/latino.  Oakland used to be a port town, back when racism was (more) blatant, blue collar jobs were about all minorities could get.  Oakland became a town peopled by folk working hard to escape the economic oppression caused by generations of bigotry.   That was then.  When the heavy industry went away, the jobs went away, Oakland never recovered.  That is now.  If there is anything to be done in this situation, it's the economic/educational factors that need to be addressed, not hurt feelings over rejected loan applications.  Are the banks racist for not handing out loans to applicants who don't meet their guidelines?  

>The information is there if you know where to look for it.

People who find the information often twist it to fit their own agendas.  When ever possible, look at the raw data and draw your own conclusions.  I've seen parts of the Clinton report, to me seemed all about causing minority voter backlash against Republican hopefuls. (Not a bad thing at all)  I'd love to see the GAO report, is there a web site?

Respectfully,

I think a web mag is better than wiping out trees.  Our interests fall
into two categories... rave related and internet related.  I think we
should consider this if we are to start work on a project.

Also, it is a LOT faster to get an impressive web presence up than it is
to produce a nice magazine.  Then there's the part where we don't agree on
everything... and that will be it's own hurdle.

Peace,

Why don't you save trees, and bandwith by using hemp-paper?????  It could
be a great statement.  

Peace and Love,
Julie

PS. Did you know that hemp grows much faster than trees, uses less water,
and is much stronger???  We could be saving the rainforests, people!

     I would say the main constraint for a PAPER magazine is MOOLAH! Paper 
     is very expensive, printing is very expensive... Color is very 
     expensive. Pre-press and binding issues are expensive..
     
     With no money upfront, you have nothing. 
     
     Atleast with the web, you can get free web space. You've got plenty of 
     volunteer staff. Many do it yourself publishers.
     
     But, no matter what:
     C ash

It is easy to make statements in a vacuum. What is much harder is to site
things in their full context. Why were these folks turned down for loans?

Banks are in the business to make money. AFAIK, they really don't care who
it comes from, as long as you can repay the loan. Why would they? It would
be bad business. 

Black applicants are refused for loans more than any other group. Ok.
As we both agree the majority of wealth in America is held by white men,
and that black people statistically are among the poorest segment of our
society. So, while not having had a chance to look at this report, my
inclination is to draw a different conclusion: Blacks(statistically
speaking) are turned down for loans because they are poor and as such are
not a good credit risk. No mystery there. 

> The information is there if you know where to look for it.

Agreed, but I caution anyone to examine the source and look at *all* the
factors involved. Most people(and governments) have agendas.

And really, I feel the need to reiterate my questions again: How would it
server the banking industry to deny people loans based on the color of
their skin, etc. etc.? From a business perspective it doesn't make any
sense.

A farmer walked into an attorney's office wanting to file for a
divorce.

The attorney asked, "May I help you?"

The farmer said, "Yea, I want to get one of those dayvorce's."

The attorney said, "Well do you have any grounds?"

The farmer said, "Yea, I got about 140 acres."

The attorney said, " No, you don't understand, do you have a case?"

The farmer said, "No, I don't have a Case, but I have a John Deere."

The attorney said, "No you don't understand, I mean do you have a
grudge?"

The farmer said, "Yea I got a grudge, that's where I park my John
Deere."

The attorney said, "No sir, I mean do you have a suit?"

The farmer said, "Yes sir, I got a suit. I wear it to church on
Sundays."

The exasperated attorney said, "Well sir, does your wife beat you up
or anything?"

The farmer said, "No sir, we both get up about 4:30."

Finally, the attorney says, "Okay, let me put it this way. WHY DO YOU
WANT A DIVORCE?"

And the farmer says, "Well, I can never have a meaningful
conversation with her."

Hyperreal.
Am I missing something here?

Whaddya think Brian and others?

rob.
http://www.citizenmag.com

P.s. Musings: The first thing I would do (having a little experience in this
matter already) is make a mission statement that you all could agree on. (To
make it easier, I would imagine that a select few should be empowered to make
decisions on behalf of SFRaves. Why? "How SFRavers does it take to change a
light bulb?" - Should be enough of a reason...)
After the mission statement is agreed upon (Good luck I imagine - i.e. green
eggs people) then there needs to be a line itemed list of what contents would
achieve the mission statement.
>From there you could create sections that address those needs.
Hmmmm, while I'm at it...then you need to decide how and who and what methods
it will take to keep the content relevant.
As far as advertising...yikes. That is a whole can o' worms that y'all don't
really want to open. I suggest this start out as free (web or otherwise) and
be planned around the idea that there is no money and support will be flakey.
At least then then expectations could be met w/o any hurt feelings. I hope
this doesn't sound too discouraging. I think it would be great if it could be
done successfully.

ah, back to work. I've got a mag to run already....

maybe because there's more of an agenda to that post than meets the eye.

in my personal view, anything that effects any part of the dance community
(underground or not and regardless of whether an individual likes specific
promoters or not) is bad news for us as a whole...

but of course, not everyone has the ability to separate out personal
agendas from the bigger picture.... sad.

There have been studies done on lending practices which accounted for all factors, so they could test the factor of race, when all other factors are the same.  It the conclusion of these studies, that race is a factor, really a surprise?  This is a national trend.  No doubt some banks are better than others.  Some branches might even show no signs of this problem.

For national data, see:  http://www.ffhsj.com/fairlend/flarch/fl970811.htm
For another study:  http://www.ffhsj.com/fairlend/flarch/fl950714.htm
For some examples, see: http://www.ffhsj.com/fairlend/flarch/fl960509.htm
for another:  http://www.ffhsj.com/fairlend/flarch/fl951020.htm

There is a lot more out there on the web, which you can find with a little looking.

There has been a lot of press over the past few years about bank redlining whole neighborhoods (refusing loans based solely on location, no matter what the other factors are in the loan aplication).  Always poor neighborhoods, true, but not all poor neighborhoods are redlined.   They tend to be poor minority neighborhoods.  Again, in our society, is this really a surprise?

We still have so far to go...

Oakland used to be a port town, back when racism was (more) blatant, blue collar jobs were about all minorities could get.  Oakland became a town peopled by folk working hard to escape the economic oppression caused by generations of bigotry.   That was then.  When the heavy industry went away, the jobs went away, Oakland never recovered.  That is now.  If there is anything to be done in this situation, it's the economic/educational factors that need to be addressed, not hurt feelings over rejected loan applications.  Are the banks racist for not handing out loans to applicants who don't meet their guidelines?

I understand that we all have strong feelings about these issues - trust
me, I sympathize.

However, there is a time and a place - and this is not the time nor the
place for this discussion any longer.  It began with an off-topic though
humorous post, and has continued from there.

  It doesn't make sense form a business perspective.  It does make sense from
the perspective of racism.

Racism in the formalities of the loan processes (more often institutional than
outright redlining based on skin color), racism in loan officers who
approve/deny loans, etc.  A little racism in every step of a complex process,
even though small at each step, could have a huge cumulative impact on the
statistics of the outcome.  Many banks are working hard to eliminate these
impacts, but given the layers of the process, and the chance for racism to have
a small impact at each level, it is a difficult battle.

Peace,
Kerry

Hi, I just had a great weekend with my roommate and friends, and I came to
some biggest realization of what friendship really means.
I was somehow feeling a weird pressure from my friends and some other
people that I saw and met at some raves; pressure that I'm supposed to be
around them all the time, and hug them, and say, "I love you".  Those are
not the things that I do not wanna do or anything.  I think sharing time
with my friends or people and share some good vibe and hugs are really
cool, BUT not when I'm pressured to do so.  And I realized that it happens
not only at raves but in my life in general.  And since I could not handle
the pressure very well, I just stopped hanging out with most of my friends
and even feel weird about going out to a party any more.
But then, this weekend, my roommate (and friend) and a friend of ours had
somewhat deep conversation about friendship.  And our conclusion was that
"our bond, friendship, and love are there.  It's cool to say, 'I love you'
and share some time with friends, but it is not like, 'you MUST do it'.
As long as you recognize the bond, you and your friends can do whatever
you/they wanna do, and when you get together with your friends, welcome
them, and enjoy the time you are sharing with your friends."  
I'm just glad that I have a few friends who care about me and respect my
individuality.  And I do the same to them, too.
Sorry it's getting too personal, but just wanted to share with you guys
my happiness.  And I also wanted to say,
Thank you very much for being such rad friends
to Doreen and Molly.

yuko

i like the hemp-paper idea, i'm going to look into that...if anybody can
refer me some document about prices and all that i would appreciate it.

as for the web presence, i don't think it should be an either-or thing.  

there's a beauty, strength, and uniqueness to a magazine--a timeless
undeniable truth and a sense of permanence.

there's an equal beauty, strength, and uniqueness to a webzine--a
quicksilver, perpetual-motion creature of the moment.

ideally, the magazine should be used to generate support within the bay
area by giving SFR the respect and power accorded to the printing press,
and the webzine should be used to branch out and provide what the magazine
cannot--sound, hypertext, and frequent updating.

I feel you girl!

You shouldn't have to say those three words all the time. In fact you
should use the verbal expression of love a lot less than then actually
*showing* someone you care. Here's a PERFECT example:

Last Friday after work I came home and was feeling kinda burned out,
bored, etc. So I went over to my neighbors to check my voice mail, and
what do you know?? A *really* genuine friend of mine left me a message
that warmed my soul and made me feel really special. The message was but
15-20 seconds long but meant so much. If you EVER feel the impulse to tell
someone you care, DO IT. Basically what my friend said was that he was
thinking about me, wanted to say hi, and that he hopes I have a great
night... and that he loves me. What's better than that? And it's even
better coming from another guy. Because it just shows me how I've evolved
into an intelligent human being, who is comfortable enough with himself to
accept love from anyone.. no matter what their sex, race, sexual
preferences, breed of animal, etc etc etc. People have put false
definiations of love in their information trays. They think that love is
either a) love you have for relatives or b) love you have for you
girlfriend/boyfriend or sometimes c) love you have for *something* you
really enjoy or admire... lets ad a "d" for humans that we admire, feel
connections to (good connections), are important to us, and that we
care about. This world is lacking love and it's up to our generation to
change that.

These are the things that matter most in life, the connections we make with 
others. Nothing can compare to this. I can honestly say that I've never
had as good of friends as I have now. My friends love me and let me know it 
on a regular basis. I feel as if all this good I do (or at least I think I
do) is coming back to me. Not that I expect it to, but I am a willing 
recipient (sp?).:)  It just makes the world so much warmer when we care
about eachother and except our differences... if only the people in power could
see this. I'm glad I'm 21 and have realized what really matters in life... 
there are people who never realize this. What would life be like??? I feel
sorry for them.

Friends are what life is about. Whether it's a boyfriend, girlfriend, cat,
dog, fish, pet rock, etc. Anything that gives and excepts love is a friend
in my book.

CHAPTER 1 Complete.. :)
I'm sorry for those who don't like long messages, but sometimes I have
something to say. That's the point of this anyway.. right. And besides, if
you don't want a heart felt message (that may be longer than most) you can
skip anything that has byroni written on it. I'm not your average bear...

It is easy to make statements in a vacuum. What is much harder is to site
things in their full context. Why were these folks turned down for loans?

Banks are in the business to make money. AFAIK, they really don't care who
it comes from, as long as you can repay the loan. Why would they? It would
be bad business.

Gotta agree with Patrick on this one.  While I won't claim that discrimination 
does not exist, banking is an _intensely_ competitive industry.  The criteria 
for deciding whether or not to make a loan is very formulaic-- you can even 
apply for one over the phone or on the internet (i.e., race is unknown).  If 
there was a large, credit-worthy population of blacks, hispanics, whites, 
aliens, or dogs that was not being served solely because of discrimination, you 
would very quickly see the opening of the Bank of Nathan in metro centers 
around the country.

awww yuko!!  *hug*
seriously, it was such a nice weekend, wasn't it?  one of the best in 
years i think for me...
and i think you speak for many when you say you are sick of all the 
ppl at parties all "i love you" cuz how can that be sincere?  the 
best communication is non-verbal...the unspoken connection between 
ppl.  THAT is the shit you can't fake.  it's either there or it 
isn't.  and we got it babeEEEEEE!!  :-)

what constitutes an addict? the number of times? or the *need* to
check it? have you ever felt any sort of withdrawal symptoms when you
haven't had access to your mail?  

i know that for the first month when i moved out here and my computer
was in transit, i did feel out of touch and didn't know quite how to
spend my spare time.... also when i was having server troubles.... 

hi. my name's liz and i'm an email addict.

> p.s. 'cuz you're all soooo addictive... :)

you know, there is a book coming out soon called _email trouble_ (i
think) and it's about this very thing. i can't wait to get a copy!
maybe we should form a group or something?

cheers - e. :)

would you say that rave promoters are a credit worthy group
that could be served by the bank of nathan? Or how about
djs that need a loan for some 1200s and records.

I would open an account there...especially if they gave away
free dishes with a new account.

What ever happened to that Crunchman fellow?  This story reminded me of a
very psychotic journey through the lower mountain ranges of California
looking for a rave in a clearing somewhere after a Dr. Freecloud's party
had been broken up... forest fire burning in the distance, one ex hacker
frying balls in the passenger seat of his car as I drive the gutless
wonder through the dark winding canyons, rave newbie in tow who ends up
freaking out as a result of his homophobia not mixing well with his first
E (Andy, there some _GUYS_ watching you dance dood!  What's up with that
maaaan?), and at the end of the road an _Amazing_ party called Elevation
put on by our lovely cousins from the south... SoCal Raves.

I know that wasn't the intent of the story, but I think I know what was in
that backpack.  They took it right out of the briefcase from "Pulp
Fiction" and put it in the backpack, but what was the old hippy doing with
it?  It's not his to carry either, just ask the man with the bandaid.
Everybody has their own, but some folks don't realize it, and that's the
first step towards losing it.

... or something like that...
AndyW

p.s.	Write me personally if you're bored.  Cause I am right now (I'd
refer to my list of things to do, but most of them would get me in
trouble at work on a day like today).  Anybody have plans for this
weekend?  Heh...

The thing I find most amusing about this thread is that there has been a 
weekly going on down here in SoCal land called "Green Eggs and Ham" and 
it's been one of the best things to happen down here in a long time (eg. 
quality music, great location, great vibes, never gets busted, runs for 
10+ hours etc. etc. etc.).

So on SoCalRaves, you see all these posts with "Green Eggs and Ham" in 
the header and you get excited, and then on SFR you see posts with "Green 
Eggs and Ham" in the header and you just wanna hit the D key...

Let's see, a quick hotbot search turns up:

http://www.areuea.org/evidence.htm

"Agents own prejudices and the prejudices of their customers are shown to be 
be significant in explaining discrimination. Results also indicate that
white home seekers are steered toward more white and affluent neighborhoods." 

http://www.aclufl.org/r-exist.htm

This organization... sends out "testers" when someone complains they were
denied fair housing. When a race discrimination charge is made, the testers
are controlled for made, the testers are controlled for all variables but
race. For example, a black tester will claim the same family status as a white
tester, thereby excluding that as a possible reason for the disparate treatment. 
Sadly, blatant discrimination is frequently uncovered. HOPE has just 
filed lawsuits against the owners of three Dade apartment complexes
where black testers were told either no apartments were available 
or were shown sub-standard units and within hours white testers
were shown apartments in good condition and informed of immediate vacancies. 

At Morningside Apartments in Coral Gables the apartment manager is 
alleged to have said in broken english to a white tester "Black
man, I no rent. You know we all Americans. I decide they mucho problema." 

http://www.hud.gov/cfo/cfoprf44.html

HUD recieved over 10,000 cases of discrimination in housing last year alone.

http://www.lawaid.com/discrim.htm

"Unlawful discrimination in housing occurs in this State regardless of 
both Federal and State fair housing laws that prohibit it. Statistics
have shown that such unlawful practices continue even though there 
have been successful lawsuits that have been filed collecting
substantial damages."

And on and on and on. 

It is difficult to quantify the exact extent of this discrimination, but
it certainly exists. I think you only have to look at the extreme segregation
of our communities on the basis of race to say that the problem is severe.

>Banks are in the business to make money. AFAIK, they really don't care who
>it comes from, as long as you can repay the loan. Why would they? It would
>be bad business. 

Banks are in business to make money, but bankers decide who to offer loans
to on the basis of many factors, personal prejudice (perhaps unrealized)
and upholding "community standards" being some of them.

>>So, while not having had a chance to look at this report, my
>>inclination is to draw a different conclusion: Blacks(statistically
>>speaking) are turned down for loans because they are poor and as such are
>>not a good credit risk. No mystery there. 

Actually, this report indicated that blacks with similar income and
credit history were denied home loans at three times the rate of whites.

>Gotta agree with Patrick on this one.  While I won't claim that discrimination

It is possible to apply for a home loan over The Net? If that is true,
I have not been able to find it.

Take it easy,
Jim

Excuse me, I think that these topics are on topic to the list most of the
time.  Usually at the beginning of a discussion.

You can, as I do, use filters and delete the messages of no use.  I have to
do it for the ever increasing "NRR:" posts.

I think that the topics, race, class, gender, poltiics, are all a part of
dance culture.  I do not think that things disappear when you are dancing,
life goes on.  It is natural to see these topics brought up every now and
then.  it is unresolved, and things unresolved, like police brutality,
continue to pop up until they are dealt with.  I do not think raving
provides that much shelter from reality.

I do agree that the post has become way off topic, and should be taken
private.  I also think it should have been NRR, if to be on the list at all.

I think it is healthy to have discussions such as these.  And as compared
to some of the stupid flamewars of past, it is refreshing to see so many
people reallly taking the time to give thought to the various subjects.  It
shows that there's a certain intellectual vitality.  In any case there are
arguments made about some of the "so called" rave posts citing them as not
being rave related.  to each his own I guess.

If people are communicating, isn't that what it's about(raving/ dance
culture/ hanging out)?  Use your filter, your delete key when necessary,
you too are responsible for your mail.  I'll do my part and consider this
post off topic, except for my speech.

Speaking of dancing:

There will be a Wicked this Friday.  Friday btw is the usual evening for a
proper Wicked.  Anyway it's gonna be @ Big Heart City.  That's where I'm
gonna catch a groove wit da crew:  Jeno, Markie, Rob D., and Garth.  Should
be a good one, there hasn't been a Wicked for a while, and I fully expect
to hear some good music and get a groove on.

And easier way would have been to send the message to the offending people
rather than splatter the whole list, making you partly culpable.

It is not personal agendas, they're called ideas.  And parties can have
very personal agenda driving them.

BTW there is an SF Raves Calendar list that gives you the dates of events,
if that's all you want.  I mean why was there a club called Your Sisters
House is the first place?  Becuase the so called "non-rave" issues are
relevant to dance culture, and have an impact.

Then one can only wonder why you would post it publicly if you did not wish
to have a public response.

Considering the number of NRR posts, and the general police (not polite)
attitude some might exhibit, I am suprised that you would be dissapointed.

People, in thier attempt to smooth things over before thier time make jokes
about very serious subjects.  Funny though, I am suprised, with the amount
of non-rave-raleated posts why the green eggs and hams poet (btw I thought
it was brilliant) doesn't do that for the ever voluminous NRR.  I guess
there are some taboo subjects that should bnever be mentioned.

Man am I glad I'm a rebel, without a pause.

Pax,
John

Alrighty guys,

I'm sure most of you grasped the absurdity of the joke that I played w/ the
Green Eggs People, but if you didn't (sigh...)

FYI:

It was a parody of the lamentations that people post to the list about their
convictions and what rights they have about posting their beliefs. In light of
the serious interplay that occurs between members of this list (i.e. Green
eggs), sometimes it is good to have a little wackiness. 
PLUR was never violated.

I, (heh, heh) of course, respect and honor the Green Eggs People.

;)

hey don't tell me i have a problem just cuz i check my e-mail like 5 
or more times a day and somehow feel that something REALLY REALLY bad 
will happen if i don't check my e-mail, or the thought of losing 
access to my e-mail account sounds worse that writhing in the depths 
of hell...

out.  trust me!

I'd second that, 
a) the audience is all on the web.
b) I bet Brian would give us the space to do it :)
c) it can sit connected the the sfraves pages up now.

*I* think, it's getting tiresome to hear so many of you try and defend
yourselves, over and over again on this thread.  attempting to show that
*you* are in-fact a wholesome, politically correct, non-racist,
non-offensive, do-gooder.  You are all GREAT!!! 

I agree with much of what was said, but you're all pretty much just flaming
eachother, and stating how your opinion is *more* correct.

Opinions are like a**holes, everybody has one, and they all stink.

PEACE!!! huggers.

I have a vintage Korg MS-10 that produces some grindy, overdriven
sounds that all the kids seem to be into these days.  It is in 
excellent condition and is fully functional.  You can get more
info about this unit at:

http://www.hyperreal.org/machines/categories/manufacturers/Korg/MS-synths/
info/korg.MS-10.ad

and see a picture at:

I am selling it at the very special sfraves price of $200.00 (firm)

Ah, but did the Clinton Admin study ask the people who dissaproved those
black applicants if they weren't approved *because* they were black...  or
did they just assume that *because* they were black, it had to be
discrimination?  I've been disapproved for loans before, by a *black* guy
too.  Hmmm... maybe it was cause he was a racist.  The majority of racist
people *I* have met were minorities.

one race, the Human race...

peace.

I think that I am the king of email addicts. I check mine like 100 times a day.

try turning off your email alert sound. just for a while at first. say
five minutes. then later do it for a little longer. take gradual steps
and soon you'll only be checking your email once every fifteen minutes.
or just stop responding when people post. that's what i'm doing... wait
a minute, duh-ooh!

i too wish and hope a good day on everyone :-P

Hi all!  ]=}

 In conjunction with the 30th Anniversary of the Summer Of Love (held in 
San Francisco's Golden Gate Park this past Sunday) was the Millenium Trance 
party featuring Goa Gil on the main floor (with Ceiba/Kode IV giving Gil 
a brief break), CCC in one room with various friends spinning, and 
members of the local UG spinning in another room (Ethan Miller and Joe 
Rice of FnF).

 The main floor was *fantastic*!!!!! :) Incredible lighting, great sound, 
places to sit, plenty of fresh cool air, lots of room on the dance floor. 
Goa Gil was playing really tasty, spine-shaking stuff!!

	The lighting;
	  -8 Cyberlites around the upper edges of a rough rectangle.
	  -At *least* 20 to 30 other intelligant lighting units throughout 
	   the room. 
	  -Looked like two lasers, one full colour.
	  -Giant mirror ball, various projection screens.
	  -video projection and high res monitor (Paradise Video)
	  -*very* tasteful light show!! 

	The Sound;
	  -Four giant EAW stacks hanging from the corners of the room. :)
	  -Not sure what kind of bass bins used but they were powerful.
	   I had two *minor* complaints on the sound- There was a 
	   pronounced standing wave effect happening. When this happens 
	   the bass response is very loud near the walls and virtually 
	   non-existant near the center of the room (this is caused by 
	   the physical interaction of the room accoustics and placement 
	   of the bass bins). The other complaint was that the satelitte 
	   speakers kept fluctuating in volume (by a small amount admitedly).  
	   This was most pronounced towards the end of the party.

	Decorations;
	  -A giant mirror ball that lowered to the floor (from the ceiling).
	  -A hexagon lighting truss (around the mirror ball) that raised 
	   and lowered independantly of the mirror ball. On the truss 
	   were 6 intelligant lighting units. The truss could (in 
	   addition to going up and down) tilt while all units were 
	   swiviling their beams around. In addition there was a circular 
	   screen around the mirror ball and hexagon truss. Not only did 
	   this pick up the random (yet prolific) bits of coloured lights 
	   from the laser, mirror ball, intelligant lights, but the 
	   screen could collapse on itself *and* could be raised or 
	   lowered independently of the mirror ball and truss. (whew!)
 	  -At times the air was just filled with brilliant bits of light 
	   EVERYWHERE! A few big purple lite banners in the nearby 
	   sitting areas completed the beautiful setting
 	  -At least 20 to 30 coloured DataFlashes including some in the 
	   truss around the mirror ball.

	The Music;
	  -FANTASTIC!!!!! Gil played (as always) fabulous material!!! I 
	   actually think I heard some *really* older material at times that 
	   sounded like stuff from his earlier days (see my post on 
	   Goa/Psychedelic Trance coming up in a few days)
	   Ceiba/Kode IV gave Gil a short break around midnight (?). They 
	   played less Breakbeat Trance than when I heard them at Burning Man.  
	   Very enjoyable. It was the hardest I have ever danced.

	The Crowd;
	  -Not a whole lot of folks there which made it fine for dancing 
	   but it would have been nice to see more people. The bar crowd 
	   was minimal and some stayed the whole night to lose themselves in  
	   the dance.  :)
 

 The CCC room was likewise fun! A good study in fluro and retro 
psychedelic lighting. The floor was always comfortably packed with lots 
of smiles all around. Had *real* fun dancing to Adams set!!!  :)

 Didn't check out the FnF room too much (I'm such a trance head) but Joe 
Rice was spinning some nicely phunky stuff when I did. The couches and 
footrests really made dancing all night a pleasure.

 I've been (and still am) glowing from this event. I really feel that the 
wonderfully good vibe from the Summer Of love festival really helped. 
Many of the *really* old time psychedelic family from San Fran 
Psychedelic Communitty were there. I think they liked what they 
experienced. Our little party was announced from the stage at the 
festival and was recognised (the trance dance and rave scene) by the old 
timers as the continuation of the psychedelic energies they started way 
back in the late fifties/early sixties.

 Hi to everyone I saw!!!!  :)

This was not an FnF or a Gateway room, nevermind what the flier and anyone
else may have mistakenly said. A few of us were asked to play, and were,
IMO, dissed rather heavily before all was said and done. Last time I work
with these folks.

I've never been to a Full Moon party, what are they like?  I'm feeling a
force pulling me to explore it tonight. I just called the info line, the
gentleman on the other side said that it starts at 2:00am.  Hmm...

take care,

Hmmmm
It looks like SF Raves may not have to start it's own mag after all.
In the current (Oct. 15-21) Bay  Guardian opinion section (Pg. 9) 
There is a opinion cartoon regarding the Blue Angels right over an 
article about racism and affirmative action. Coincidence? Or 
is this mailing list already controlling the content of the Bay 
Guardian? You Decide. :-_

 I'm sorry to hear there were misrepresentations and other problems. It 
could have been an excellent oppertunity for two different groups UG 
groups to really shake things up.

 Also sorry i missed your set Ethan!!!!  :(

	TRUE junkies only check their mail once a day.  Then they sleep a bit,

BTW, my comments are no reflection on CCC, Hunab KU, or Ceiba et, al. I
thought they all did a nice job. I'm referring to the promoters. Nothin too
malicious, just kind of inappropriately hype heavy, with no follow through.

dang...so thats what happened...i was a victim of 
government mind control...as the angels flew over head they 
used captured area 51 aliens to beam sexists jokes into my brain.

I wish i had known that earlier...i could have saved sfraves over
100 messages.

anyone hear that story about how are thoughts are like radio waves
and as such can be transmitted thru space. So the theory is that
aliens are beaming their thoughts to earth in such ways as music.
The music opens the minds of our children to alien cultures and that
culture becomes part of our enviorment which in turn effects our dna
causing us to become alien. Interstellar breeding so to speak.

And then there is that story about aliens being our future selves
coming back in time to change the past and there present...
sort of like what we do with dreaming or pastlife regression where
we go into our past to uncover and correct things that are 
causing current trouble.

so i guess its time to wake up and start dreaming.

Hi everyone.

Lately some people have put me on their mailing list for jokes, etc, and I
appreciate that.  I have never really understood the concept of bandwidth
until recently, when I received an email and my eudora thingy was taking
FOREVER to download something.  Well, I Quit Eudora, went into the Apple
Menu Items and selected NCSA Telnet to use Pine to find out what the hell
the problem was and I found out someone had sent me pictures.

I ended up having to delete it because I did not wish to wait to download
it and I am not sure if I can view it anyway.  It made me think about this
bandwidth thing a bit.  It's a good idea to do a few things that can help
reduce it and make it easier for people to download their mail.

1.  Ask them if it's okay to send them pictures first.  Some peoples'
computers don't support that stuff yet (like my ole trusty IIcx) so maybe
it's a good idea to not send something that is over 100 times larger than
the average email, plus when we put it on a mailing list, that is 100 times
times whatever number of people we ares sending it to.

2.  When responding to a thread, try to weed out some of the old part of
the thread.  Most people that are following the thread already know what
has been said, and if someone can't catch on, they can find a web browser
and look through the archives.  Also, on that note, maybe consider how many
people you want to CC...I'm pretty guilty of that myself nStuff (right
jeff?).

3.  This doesn't mean stop sending me mail, or other people.  It's just
something to consider.  Like...do I or do I not recycle this [item]?

There are probably some more, but I don't want to become like th internet
police because there is a fine line between creativity free flowing and
just plain wasing space.

Just like there is a fine line between getting opinions out there and flame
wars.  Lately I have noticed the number of flame wars out there has
increased, and I am not going to tolerate it anymore.  What the hell is
going on out there?  If some of you guys don't cool it out there, im gonna
come over there and smack you one!  Now be good!  I know there are some
proactive people out there, start taking responsibility for your own
actions, it is your own job to make sure you are a positive influence on
this list not just someone who finds fault with everything and everybody.
It's not Brian's job or anyone else to tell you what is expressing opinions
and what is simply being negative and finding fault.  If you want to live
that kind of life in a public forum, move next door to Oprah Windbag's
studio and get free tickets every  day to be part of the studio audience.
In fact, go anywhere in life and you will notice that there are people
everywhere focusing on what is wrong with everything.

Let's instead start once again focusing on what is right with the ravE
community and screw all those people outside of it that are trying to stop
us from bringing house, techno, trance, jungle, drumnbass, and ambient
music to the Bay Area.

I know there are at least one of you out there.  You're just afraid to
speak up because...  -?-

something go wrong, whether people scheduled to spin don't come, or technical

Someone lemme know if they have a confirmation for the location...

I can confirm that he's at least in SoCal.  He's been on the SoCal-Raves list
for a while now.

I've never met him or really talked to him so I just don't know him.  But I
know that's where he is.  :o)

I do aggree, that spot isn't that great.  However I don't think i've been
to a party in oakland that my car didn't get mess with, or the same, DJ's
not showing and soo many difficulties, if it wasn't shut down.

And at 25 bux, I don't think its worth it anyways.

Just my thoughts.

        On saturday Sept. 27, one of our backdrops was stolen from the
Psy-Harmonics party at 115 Minna st. The backdrop is called Shiva-Shakti,
depicting Shiva as half-man, half-woman. Hand batiked by a friend as a
one-off, it is completely irreplacable.
        It is out of love that we share our backdrops with the dance
community. In fact, Shiva-Shakti is not even ours, but loaned to us by a
friend. The Psy-harmonics party was even a CCC event, but we donated it
without charge. Admist such a sharing spirit, we were shocked that someone
could actually bring themselves to steal it from us.
        We are offering a reward to anyone who can help us locate it. No
questions asked, we are not seeking vengence, just our backdrop wich we
borrowed and then loaned out of trust. If you have any information,
                        please call 415-552-5545

Has anyone seen Fern Gully?  I always thought that'd be a /<ewl theme for a

The ABC's of Friendship

        A Friend...............

Accepts you as you are
Believes in you
Calls you just to say HI.
Doesn't give up on you
Envisions the whole of you(even the unfinished parts)
Forgives your mistakes
Gives unconditionally
Helps you
Invites you over
Just because
Keeps you close at heart
Loves you for who you are
Makes a difference in your life
Never judges
Offers support
Picks you up
Quiets your fears
Raises your spirits
Says nice things about you
Tells you the truth when you need to hear it
Understands you
Values you
Walks beside you
Xoxoxoxox
Yells when you won't listen
Zaps you back to reality

        May we always be good "buddies"
        May we always be good friends...
        and may our friendship be the kind
        that never ends..........................

So, I taped Spencer on 'The Dating Game'.  It's 100% hilarious!  The 
other two bachelors come off like total dorks and Spencer is Mr. Man! :D  
And whenever the camera is on him, he's smiling, dancing, bopping around, 
etc. etc. etc.!!  

The best part of the whole thing:  SPENCER WINS!!!  This beautiful woman 
totally disses the other two dorks and picks our boy Spencer!  And what 
do they win?  A trip to San Francisco! :D  Though, Spencer told me that 
he didn't actually get to go on a date with the woman.  :/  Ah well, it 
makes for great TV though!

Highlights:

Chuck Wollery:  "He says you have no idea what fun is until you go to one 
of his underground parties -- let's say hello to Spencer!"

Spencer's 'Wizard Love Spell'

Bachelor #3 yelling out football calls

Spencer doing a 360 on his way to meet the lady who picks him

You kids gotta see this!!  I'm sure it's going to be on visuals tapes for 
the next umpteen million years (and I'm already working on the techno 
remix of the whole segment) but you gotta see it!  If any of you venture 
to SoCal, let me know and I'll show it to you!! :)

PLUR

PS:  I miss you bay area folks!  Even with all the green eggs and 
bitching and such, I really miss you kids!

I was in a chat room tonight for fun and posted a pic; the one below, and 
two chics that were in Tennesse-never even been to a rave decided that me 
on the left and my best bud Patrice looked like drag queens and were 
losers because we had fun. My mood is a little shot down now, but only 
for those that choose not to have an open mind.  ( I even tried to still 
be nice to them afterwards, but only recieved more negitivity that we 
were freaks.) 
	People shouldn't condem what they don't know, but they do.
	They are scared of the unknown, afraid to be laughed at.
	Why can't people learn to bite their tounges until they know 
facts and expeince them before they talk.
	Why can't we take our own advice that we give so well to others?

Just my two cents.
TERESA

An Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of Guinness and
sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When
he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.
The bartender asks him, "You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it; it
would
taste better if you bought one at a time."
The Irishman replies, "Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in
America,
the other in Australia, and I'm here in Dublin. When we all left home, we
promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank
together."
The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.
The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way:
He orders three pints and drinks them in turn.
One day, he comes in and orders two pints. All the other regulars notice
and fall silent.
When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, "I
don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences
on your great loss."
The Irishman looks confused for a moment, then a light dawns in his eye
and he laughs. "Oh, no," he, says, "everyone's fine. I've just quit
drinking."


Peace, Luv, & Hugs

Help.
I love living in the city, but the house I'm living in has been sold.
I need to find a room by the first of November.

I currently live with randoms.
People I have nothing in common with.  
I go straight to my room when I come home.
I can go the entire week without seeing either of my housemates.
I pay equal rent but it doesn't feel like _my home_.

I want to live with people like me.
    I work
    I party
    I love my friends
    I love being alive
    I do _stuff_.

Anyhow, if you can help me out please e-mail me or call me at
work:415 954 5501, home:415 566 4243

Thanks, Joel
sorry for the waste of bandwith.
oh, I'm 24 -if that makes a difference.

Here's one more thing you can do to conserve bandwidth: don't send 500 line
messages such as the one you sent to the SFR mailing list that are not rave
related ... *even* if you mark it NRR. The damage is done once you click on
"send." Whether the subject line has "NRR" is inconsequential.

Hi!  =]

you are so right.  

...but as many people don't even know what bandwidth is, as did not I
6 months ago, wouldn't sfraves be a great place to educate a few
people?  i mean, where else are they going to learn this stuff?  To my
knowledge, there is no bandwidth-education@hyperreal.org.  My company
recently (only very recently) set up a web page and now they have on
their applications their web address.  this stuff is so new.  i think
people deserve to be educated.  i've said it before and i say it now,
this is more than just a rave discussion group, this is a social
thinktank.  I have met some really wonderful people on this list, and
some of them have become very dear friends.  Topics at raves are not
always restricted to rave related stuff, why should it be here?  

I'm not trying to downplay what you have going on here, you have a
good point.  My feeling is that at some point down the road, another
list will pop up that will be only for posting BSp's and/or other
strictly rave related topics.  that way people who don't want all the
100+ messages a day (come on guys, its' gonna grow, and there is
notheing you or i or santa claus can do anything about it) can just
subscribe to that list.  that would be something to be heavily
monitored and a detailed email stating it's strictly for (whatever
subject it is about).  A while back someone started a sfr-legality
mailing list, so i think some more of those would be nice, i am sure
there are.  

so anyway, now i've filled up a whole lane in the information
superhighway, and they are honking in back of me.  Sharif is probably
wailing on the horn right now, so I see a Denny's I'd better pull
off...

Speaking of things that are missing....

Someone left a very cool statue of two people doing sort
of acrobatic handstands at the party we threw at
501 Folsom in July.  It is still sitting here in our
"lobby."

Will the owner please call 415.543.2800 and let us know
if or when you'd like to come claim it?  Or, you can
drop by Critical Path, Inc. any time between 9am and 6pm at 
320 First Street, that's First between Folsom and Harrison, 
in San Francisco.

Umm, they could read a book? The library even has them for free!
Whole publishers have made a business of (the Dummies series) educating
newbies.

And, yes, there are much better mailing lists for bandwidth education
than sfraves.

It should be restricted b/c you don't have to listen to someone at a rave
going off about whatever. But once you send a message to this list, we all
have to download (yes you can filter, but *after* you download).
This *is* a rave discussion group. If you want to have a social thinktank
then *create* a new list and have at it, don't hijack an existing list.

Why do you all need to be governed? Why can't you self-govern? pluRespect
the intentions of this list w/o having someone force you to do so.

i can't beleive with all the warnings about police monitoring this list 
you would be so careless as to post something like this publicly. Federal

Could you guys take this discussion offline?

You're using too much bandwidth and we all know how much those lousy little
text files can clog up the system.

Note that I have carefully chopped off the bottom of the original message
b/c I too am a bandwidth hugger.

i can't beleive with all the warnings about police monitoring this list 
you would be so careless as to post something like this publicly. Federal

hey kids.... anyone with computer experience looking for a job in the
south bay?

job description is as follows:
build/fix/troubleshoot standard pc's and laptops inhouse and in the
field.
install and configure software on pc's and laptops.

this is an entry level position, a car and insurance is a plus, and age
and experience doesn't matter. pretty much if you know how to build a
computer and you know what your doing, you can get this job.

if you're interested, e-mail me, page me, or call me.

>i can make some killer brownies
     
i can't beleive with all the warnings about police monitoring this list 
you would be so careless as to post something like this publicly. Federal 
agents are no doubt going to bust out little get together now armed with 
evidence we have provided for them :)

Right on..  It's all about acceptance.  (No I'm not biased here at all
<sarcasm>  OH NO... )  I love those girls Teresa and Patrice.  I think that
picture of them is so damn cute with the orange courdoroy and rainbow furry
overalls.  Yep.. they're such nice people.  =)
  but on that note... I never know whether to keep encouraging people to
embrace the rave scene  or to say screw it and keep it to ourselves.  Just
gotta try to keep the positive outlook n' everything.  Look at the bright
side.... they don't know what they're missing.  
 FOr months I'd try to convince my friend how much fun raving was and how it
brought people together.  He'd blow me off with the usual, "sure, whatever
tweak."  WE were still friends, tho.  Then about two days ago I got an e-mail
from him.
       "I JUST WENT TO THE GATHERING IN SAN JOSE AND OHMIGOSH I SAW THE
PACIFIERS AND EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME ABOUT AND I LOVED IT."
This is how the scene should work, and we shouldn't need to make excuses for
other people.  Just my nickel...

I was in a chat room tonight for fun and posted a pic; the one below, and 
two chics that were in Tennesse-never even been to a rave decided that me 
on the left and my best bud Patrice looked like drag queens and were 
losers because we had fun. My mood is a little shot down now, but only 
for those that choose not to have an open mind.  ( I even tried to still 
be nice to them afterwards, but only recieved more negitivity that we 
were freaks.) 
	People shouldn't condem what they don't know, but they do.
	They are scared of the unknown, afraid to be laughed at.
	Why can't people learn to bite their tounges until they know 
facts and expeince them before they talk.
	Why can't we take our own advice that we give so well to others?

Just my two cents.
TERESA

Hi Phillip,

You're not the Phillip I know, are you?  

I think what Sharif was saying was even if I mark it NRR (which I
forgot to do, my appoligies) is not to make it so long.  500 lines, i
believe was the terminology.  

I'm going to have to go home and count my lines tonight.  I don't
think it was 500 lines.  I suspect my fingers would get tired.

i like chocolate cake - you can put cool frosting decorations on it,
and it's nice and messy if you eat it with your hands...

Hugh asked ...

> Did anyone go to the Full Moon party last night?

 It was a beautiful night for dancing under the moon. Not a cloud in the
sky, no fog or mist at the beach to speak of. 

 I got to the voicemail site at about 2AM, just before the police did!
In short, the cops gave the Wicked crew 10 minutes to haul the sound 
system off the beach and clear out the people ! 

 The alternate site was spread by word of mouth - a spot on the bay.
Various strings of cars made the trip, so the crowd at the new site
was about 60 to 80 people by 5:30 AM.

 I had been to this site for parties before, and I was reminiscing about
the time we had to move a busted party there about three years ago.
We had been dancing for about an hour when the sprinklers went on!

 Well, history repeated itself! And the crowd last night did the same
thing we did three years ago - gathered the local garbage cans and
covered the sprinkler heads with them. You could dance next to them
and hear the sprinkler jets hitting the sides of the metal cans.

 ( A note for the next bunch that uses this site - do the park maintenance
folks a favor and bring big plastic garbage bags with you to replace
the ones you may have to pull out of the cans in order to use them 
as sprinkler blockers )

 DJs were hot!  Carlos was good to see again - I haven't watched him
in action for over 6 months now. A real mixing genius ! And of
course his enthusiasm is a big big part of a Wicked Full Moon party.
Other DJs were ( I think ) George, Jonas(?), Melanie, and another
Jonas(? - someone correct me please!).

 Good funky house music! Tribal beats and funky breaks and heartbeat
4/4 and spacy acid lines and soulful vocals and samples. 

 Friendly crowd. Not too many "candy ravers", but that fancy-dress
stuff is usually for warm indoor and daytime events, I'd think. 

 The timing of sunrise and moon setting in the bay was just right!
Fat golden sun rising over the Oakland hills and relecting as a 
shimmering column on the water of the bay, as the moon in the west
faded against the lightening sky as it set behind the hills
above Pacifica.

 A first for me last night - Red Bull! It was too dark to see if this
stuff was red or not. Since Carlos gave it to me, I almost feel like
I should keep the can as a souvenir! It did assuage my hunger, and 
maybe it did gently perk me up. I'd like to bring some to the next 
psy trance party I go to . Oh, by the way, it tastes like what I'd
imagine carbonated Gatorade would . Do they still sell Tang - that
powdered orange juice ? Tastes a bit like that too.

 Anyway - last night's full moon was a beautiful little party,
despite the authorities and the park sprinkler system!

the first time i check my email in the morning i down about 200 [about 75
are work related].  and my prog checks every 5 min after that, at
which/each time i recieve approximately 2-5 msgs [more if this list is
jumpin'].  this goes on from about 8 in the morning to 6-7 at night [on
average].

this does not include the 2-3 times i check on the weekends if i'm not
working [i try to stay away if i can/get some sunlight]

as for the morning, i answer/read mails solid from about 8 to 12 minimum,
then get on with the rest of my workday [yes this *is* at work].

i don't feel like i have a problem [denial, 1st syptom] but would be
willing to attend a support group if one starts...  i might meet some real

in my experience, i have come to the very strong belief that raving --
whatever it means to you -- is a very personal thing ... and if you belong
there, you know it.  you know when you first "got it" about the driving
bass, the pounding music, the lights, the energy, the throngs of people
dancing.

people always ask me if my daughter raves (they were very curious about
that when i went on the leeza show to talk about the positive sides of
raving), and i say no, she doesn't like it .... she thinks it's too loud,
too crowded, too hot.  inother words, it just isn't her thing (though she
doesn't hate it, she just isn't driven to do it)

to make a controversial analogy, it's sort of like finding religion.  when
you have that epiphany, that "i have finally found it" it isn't really
translatable into words.  and you can't use words to convince others.

it is my policy to *never* try to encourage someone to come to a party with
me, because unless they have that pull to do it on their own, then it's not
really their time yet.  and i hate having to feel responsible for someone
not feeling like they're somewhere that they belong (and besides, then they
want to go home early, and that sucks!)

and -- on the other side of this coin -- remember that there are *LOTS* of
other wonderful things to do that have nothing to do with raving ..... i'm
sure there are people who ride rodeo, or go fly fishing, or (as i
not-so-tactfully said to one of the mothers on the leeza show) play bingo
... these are people who find the happiness and release and feeling of
community in those activities that we find in raving.

Some of those activities are closer to the spirit of raving (like gospel
music, which to me comes sooooo close to the energy and positivy, the
participation and joyouseness that can be found at great parties), and some
are very different (like hunting), but we should remember "to each his or
her own."

bottom line, people don't always understand what the rave/dance community
is about, but they might be mighty cool anyway.  And remember too, that
we're all products of our environment, and to two girls from Tennessee, you
candy ravers probably looked like you were from another planet or
something.  (actually, sometimes you guys look like you're from another
planet to me!  ;^)   which ain't necessarily a negative thing!

but expressing real aspects of who you are is not about approval from other
people, it's about being yourself and being proud of who that is.

love, leslie

i've heard a lot of people complaining about the copious posts to this
newsgroup.  personally, i kind of like the plentiful messages and
topics, its kind of like holding 10 virtual conversations at once. 
but i can see how it could be too much for some people.  so what i'm
wondering is, has anyone out there tried the "digest" version of
sfraves?  isn't that like one or two posts a day of the "best"
messages or something?  i thought about subscribing myself but decided
i liked reading all the many posts better than working anyway (as long
as i'm sitting in front of my computer typing it pretty much looks
like i'm being a productive little drone, heh heh...)  i'd be
interested in reading a "review" of sfraves-digest if anyone's
actually subscribed...

Since i wont be coming to the party this friday and i have
recieved a couple of private requests for this and since
these can be wonderful treats to spread around at raves
to make people happy i figured it would be ok to post
this to the whole list. 

A little taste of heaven.

I pkg betty crocker fudge brownie mix( actually any mix will do)
8 oz cream cheese, softened and filled with love.
1/3 cup sugar
1 egg
1/2 tsp vanilla
green stuff ( or blue stuff or red stuff or whatever)

prepare brownie mix as directed on package. Pour into
greased pan.

Beat cream cheese and sugar in electric mixer until smooth 
and full of love. You may chant over them if you like.
Add egg and vanilla, mix well.

pour cream cheese mixture over brownie mix and cut thru 
with knife for a marbled effect

Cover with green stuff if desired and bake at 350 for 35 min
or until c.cheese is slightly browned.

we? (shhhhh - you guys - i'm going to run down to the store and get
some brownie mix before everyone hears it's illegal - double fudge, at

some visual strangeness perhaps...

old Liquid Television episodes (Aeon Flux episodes with no words--yum)...

something from the "Mind's Eye" series...

those really old black and white cartoons where everyone has those huge
black dots for eyes and stretches their arms out like rubber hoses and sing
songs and constantly groove as they move around...

actually we could just watch the news and play with the knobs on the TV to
make everything colored and wavy so it looks like everyone is on mars...

quick soft spinal explosion.  makes me wonder how i ever lived without it.
tell me we're all beautiful.

pour clear glass of sunshine, bottled at the rise.

clouds soar like angel breath.  moon winks twice, shimmers and shakes in a
rainspattered puddle.

mad god dancin a merry jig two miles north of the center of the universe.
groove to that piper.

correct, measured, accurate, precision.  with intent to consume.

growling jumping frogs in a chorus across an infinite shard of bayou.
alligator go a-swimmin, swill dat moonshine.

cool like gin and tonic, gentle pale perfumed skin tastes of long-forgotten
phantasms.  o i am melted by those perfect almond eyes and the myuzik keeps
on going.  and going.

and going.
--i am electric wave particle.
and going.
--i am god's little toy.
and going.
--i am a forever dancing serpent twist in the wind.
and going.

and going.

and going.

i am already laughing just thinking about that.  by all means.  everyone

i can't think of a way to make this rave related.

no wait.

how do all of you feel about having choice excerpts from the posts getting
published in the SFR magazine?  i know, it's archived, but...

Actually, I read that it wasn't the chocolate, but rather that they were
being laced with whip cream, so the Feds had to shut 'em down.

from the mayan oracle

Ben

I am Ben,skywalker, time/space traveler,
gentle messenger of the light.

I am the touch of angelic grace.

Once embraced in my robes of light,
a new tone is struck.

Sublime transfiguration becoming in you
 the fruit of divine loves yearning for itself.

I am skywalker who has come to earth,
entering this time and dimensional reality
to initiate vision in this age of masks with few eyes.

I reveal the sweet power in the simplicity of love
as i awaken with my silken touch
the resonance of heaven you have yearned for.

The new harmonic octave has arrived.
The song of the future returning to itself,
now pulsates thru the earth.

Even now its tender promise quickening
within every cell of humanity,
that these heavenly frequencies return
in this time of the great miracle
to draw the shimmering center of humanity
up to embrace the pillars of heaven,
whose beams from the once and future dream,
longing to awaken.

Winged child who walks in wisdom and tenderness,
thou art innocent laughter and flowered heart
open wide in celebratory passion,
for this dream is vitally alive.

And i, the cosmic pied piper,
extend to you now my gentle hand.
Let us take a free fall flight into the unknown.

Abandon your fears.
With unwavering trust, step upon my star-path,
spanning dimensions like a luminous bridge.
Joyfully will we dance awake the dream
on the altar of the present moment,
the platform of sacred delight and glowsticks
joining heaven and earth.

Move in uncharted territory
with protean reference points.
unveiling the one true identity

I am ben
Here to bridge you with a remembered message
from your own heart.
You are a pillar of light on earth,
and heaven is where you stand.

How many of you remember the old Pure Space parties?  I hope I can stop
by for old-times sake ;).  It should be cool.  Our House has a nice little
lineup too, then there's a whole ton of stuff on Friday, including Wicked
and Step2k.  The Party By the People looks good for Saturday, then on
Sunday there's the free Organic in GG Park, and then the huge Global DJ
Mix Awards show on Sunday (check out the lineup).

I'm going to clean up the radio and TV shows soon, so if your show is there,
and you haven't sent me anything about it recently, please drop me a 
message saying it's still on, or give me any updates.

 Yup,
That's the space it will be held at. As for the vibe, price etc... the music
will speak for itself... we (FTT) put in a lot of effort to choose the right
kind of music to appeal to all our audiences, and we spared no expense to
bring in artists that we feel represent the best in their genre... and
sincerely want to introduce them to our audience...  eg. the
downtempo/chill-out room (ULTRA LOUNGE) with the Ninja crew, Fila Brazillia,
NIghtmares etc... costs us more in talent fees than the other 3 rooms.
Which promoter in their right mind would spend more money on a chill out
room than the main room, unless they were serious about the music, know
what's up with music, and serious about introducing the scene to world class
acts?
Anyway, I'm getting pretty excited about the party and in spite of the
problems other parties have had with the space, we have a few things up out
sleeve that will make the money you spend at our show a memorable
experience!!!

- Philip wants:
<< get something strange.. or out of the ordinary >>
I did the best I could for ya man.  It's hard when you consider my mom taped
half of this stuff back when Pay-Per-View was free for us

- Priscilla asked for:
<< how about Peter Pan or The Muppet Movie >>
Well, I couldn't find The Muppets Take Manhattan for some reason.  Maybe my
sibs are borrowing it, but I can bring Peter Pan.  :o)

- Josh Sorkin wants:
<< old Liquid Television episodes (Aeon Flux episodes with no words--yum)...
something from the "Mind's Eye" series... those really old black and white
cartoons>>
Well, I'll be bringing Beyond The Mind's Eye but as for the rest, I don't
have it.  :oP

- Messaih Wannabe
<< "meet the feebles"... >>
Well, unfortunately, I don't have that either.  Not many old cartoons here,
just old cartoon movies.  Here's a list of what I've pulled out so far.

Cartoons:
- Tenchi Muyo Episodes 2-5 (you know this is on every Sunday on Channel 54)
- Robotech episodes.  (Not quite in order but hey, there's a bunch of 'em and
some are actually pretty close.)
- Macross II: The Movie
- Ghost in the Shell (with subtitles. You can turn off the volume and make up
the words.  Or hell, leave the volume up and practice your Japanese.  :o)
- The Fluppy Dogs Movie (I think it's actually the t.v. premiere for the
Fluppy Dogs)
- Rudolph's Shiny New Year
- Care Bears Nutcracker Suite
- Care Bears Movie II
- Pete's Dragon
- Duck Tales: The Movie
- The Camel Boy
- Puff the Magic Dragon
- The Secret of NIMH (very /<ewl if you've never seen it)
- Frosty in Winter Wonderland
- Fern Gully
- Charlotte's Web (I dunno, the end may be too sad for a raver night)
- Alice in Wonderland
- Peter Pan
- Dr. Dolittle (O/<, so it's not a cartoon, but it's still weird kid stuff)

Normal Movies (about three movies per tape):
- Gloria; Mr. Mom; The Toy
- Vice Versa; Willow
- Bright Lights, Big City; Sinbad: The Eye of the Tiger; 7th Voyage of Sinbad
(Hey, someone wanted funky old movies people don't really know)
- The Star Chamber; The Neverending Story; Blackout
- Haunted Honeymoon; Down and Out in Beverly Hills; Labrynth
- Native Son; The Sicilian; Mac and Me (funky alien/ET type movie)
- The Philadelphia Experiment; Oh God, You Devil; Beat Street (Remember way
back when. . .)
- Krull; Lady in Red; Breakin' (. . . breakin had nothing to do with raves?
 Hehehe)
- Drop Dead Fred (Can't get much weirder than that); Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid; Hot Shots
- Against All Odds; Benji (You know, the doggy); Flash Gordon (Woo hoo!!
 Flashback!)
- Legend (a very /<ewl movie.  I taped it off TNTso I tried to edit out the
commercials but kinda fell asleep towards the end and forgot to start taping
agin so I missed a bit of the end)
- Singin in the Rain (Ah the classics. . . ;oP)
- The Princess Bride (anyone who doesn't like this movie cannot be my friend)

Random Funky Shhhhtuff:
- Beyond The Mind's Eye

Any Other Requests?   Hurry before I leave. . .   :o)
You can always call me too.  I'm at 408.526.0606.  I should be at home all
day getting everything ready (and sleeping t' make it through the night O/<,
don't worry about waking me up though)

Hope to hear from everyone really soon.

I've:

Wicked City, the bomb anime [english dub] 
<anime violence & nudity, fairly heavy adult content/scenes, trrriiippy> 

Excalibur - for those of you who haven't seen this King Arthur rendition...
it's worth seeing, and hard to find/rent. this is a cool, cool movie.
<medium violence, frontal nudity during an adult scene>heck, i'm bringin'
it regardless. 

I would rather not lug these down to the city in my sack if noone is
interested, but have no prob if i get a positive re:

oh, by the way, i *am coming down, and bringin' the sandwiches.  I can't
let you guys go without.

Oh yeah! I agree. It's got the fat disco break, acid basslines, a touch of
breakbeat, and a musical story to tell.
It's my favorite right now.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

p.s. I wish, however, that Dan would release a CD version of his Phat live
sets so that way he could impart some of his turtablist wisdom that he gives live.
That would be sweet.

I was down in LA last weekend and had a chat with Spencer,
who's busting his ass as an extra,  eating with the pigeons 
and struggling to survive..

anyhoo, he told me some crazy stories about the Dating Game Stint, 
like how it's all scripted, and how he never actually go to go on a date 
with 
the woman.   His "fantasy vacation" turned out to be *gasp*
a single plane ticket to San Francisco.  He took the alternative
prize ($100, minus taxes)  cuz he needed the $.

I've lost my faith.  I feel so jaded!  It's really upsetting to 
find out that Hollywood is nothing but glitter and tinsel.  They 
might as well call it "Glitter Town" or "Tinselville", or something.
The bastards.

Yep. They're all like that. I used to know this porn "actress" (don't ask)
who went on Singled Out so she could meet Carmen Electra and she told me
that the producer sits about six feet in front of you telling you who to
pick, who to give the golden ticket to, etc. They hide it really well with
some fancy editing. Also, the prize is for two people but you can just use
it to go out with a friend instead of the person you picked on the show.

No city parties or raves for me until Jan.  ={

Okay, now I know that I posted this before and others have done so before 
I.  But it has been brought up to my attention,(rather it never really 
went away, just became more calm.)  Anyways, supposedly FIVE MORE 
peorsons were choosen by whom ever is doing this and they have been 
diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.  And I have had people that I know recommend 
that I not go to HALLOWEEN TRIBAL MASSIVE for this very reason-that its 
going to be bad.  ={

I'm never sure how effective these e-mail "calls for action" letters are, 
but this one seemed at least worth effort of hitting the forward 
button.......  I hope this actually does some good.

HERE IT IS:
American Airlines is a major sponsor to and supporter of groups like GLADD,
the Human Rights Campaign, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, the AIDS Action
Foundation, DIFFA, AmFAR, and scores of community-based groups representing
gays and lesbians. It is also the first airline to adopt a written
non-discrimination policy covering sexual orientation in its employment
practices. In an unusual joint letter released to the media on Friday, March
14th from the Family Research Council, Concerned Women of America, American
Family Association and Coral Ridge Ministries, American Airlines was openly
criticized about their policy. Radical right leader Beverly LaHaye also went
on Christian "talk radio" on Friday to blast American Airlines because
"American's sponsorship of homosexual 'pride' events constitutes an open
endorsement of promiscuous homosexuality." She and the other groups have
written Bob Crandall at American to complain that the airline has  "gone
beyond mere tolerance" of gays and lesbians.  The full article appeares in
Friday's Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and possibly picked up by other
newspapers around the country.
It has come to the attention of the gay and lesbian community that
American Airline's switchboard and e-mails are being bombarded now by
homophobic and hateful callers who have been urged by LaHaye and others to
DEMAND the company terminate its gay-friendly policies.

Hey Everyone!

I thought some Pizza would be great for Movie Night. So, I am taking 
a poll on Favorite Toppings. What's yours?

I think it sucks that some insane people would do something like this(if it
is true). Why doesn't someone ever see the person(s) responsible for this and
beat their ass??  Hearing about stuff like this shows how the scene has
become. I for sure don't want to go to Tribal Massive if I'm going to have to
worry about being stabbed with a needle by some lunatic. It sucks that you
have to think about things like this. I wish the scene was like it used to
be. I can remember being at a party and asking some complete stranger to
watch my bag, and then come back half an hour later and get my bag and not
even have to worry about stuff being stolen!! That is the way it should be.
I've read enough mail from people saying they've gotton their stuff stolen,
and now this needle scare thing. I would really like to see things improve. I
love to dance at parties, but I'm fearful that it will have to change. I
refuse to endanger my life by going to parties and have to worry about
getting HIV/AIDS. NOBODY should have to worry about that at a party!!!
                                 PEACE, <3, and :)   is what it is all
about!!!!!

Could we NOT spread this type of info?

Tell the person who told you that you do not believe them, unless they
tell you the source.  These types of rumors SUCK.  Don't you realize this
is screaming fire in a crowded theater?

AIDS/HIV is a serious, life changing and often life ending
illness/condition, and you should tell your sick friends you heard this
from that there is no evidence of this occurring, and that if they know,
they know from the inside and should report it.  If it did happen, the
media would take SUCH a long ride on something like that, that we would
ALL hear about it, over and over and over.

This is another total bullshit myth based on the media/societal paranoia
that HIV positive people have nothing to live for and are mad at the
world.  This is so not the case, I have two friends that have discovered
that they are positive since I have known them, and in my experience, it
brings people to realize how precious life is. 

Because it is.

I mean, if they know enough to know that 5 more people have been chosen,
they either heard it from somebody who KNOWS, or they are making it up.
In either case I am disgusted.

Thank you for dessimating my apetite during my lunch break.  Anybody in
San Jose want a salad?

Please spare me any future paranoid urban myths.

This is very important stuff here, folks.  While we are discussing these
profoundly important health issues about needle stabbings at these 
so-called "Techno-Rock Concerts" that 
you hooligans attend every weekend, I want to use the opportunity to 
announce some more health issues that
we should be concerned with.  If you are the type who attends these 
weekly "Rage" parties,
PLEASE be aware:

	o  Sometimes they put crushed up lightbulbs in e.
 o  Even if its good, you have a 50% chance of dying the first time you 
take it.
    (so take lots of echinaeca!)
 o  Ray Vonie is not a real person; he is actually a government entity   
    (on alien payroll !), which sells missiles to Iran. Think about it.  
If you tweak the "V" in his name
    to a 90 degree angle, it becomes an L and you can rearrange the 
letters to spell  "Alien Nor".  He always 
    said bad spelling was his trademark.  Now you know why.  (so take 
lots of Vitamin C!!!)
 o  DJ's are nothing more than "Sinister Ministers" who are brainwashing 
us with buried subliminal messages.
 o  They put spider eggs in gumballs!  Ewww! 

stop spreading the vibe, start spreading rumors!  they travel faster and 
they're
more fun!

yOU KNOW...

 Ooops..  Ok..

You know...
 I really love thoughs tech support calls where the customers sound card
"ain't getting any sound"
 I just got off the phone with this guy.. He calls me up complaining about
his CDROM not playing any audio.. So I go over a few things with him.
.Turns out he had the speakers plugged into the wrong socket. So he plugs
it into the correct socket (speaker out) and all I can here in the back
ground is moaning sounds. Like fake orgasims or something.. I am like..
"Ok.. Looks like we nipped that one in the bud"

 You know.. There will always be a group of people out there ready and
waiting to talk shit about other people. They usually do it to look cool
amongst their pears. Yanno. Because they don't feel they are all that hip
or whatnot.
 But.. You know. If they were to just...Go to a ravE.. You know, these
people you are talking about. They would probably be cooler afterwards..
You think?
 Anyways. I got this bad habbit.. I usually use body lanquage to show
concideration.. Need I say more? Yep.. Most people can not read into body
lanquage as well as myself..  So.. I suppose I should speak up more often.
But...Then you got my friend Wayne.. He is constantly letting you know "Oh,
thats not what I meant to say".. "Don't get me wrong"... Sometimes I just
think he is being, alittle over conciderate..

Welp.
Back to work.

Hmm, the statement above sort of describes the way I'm starting to feel
about raves.  :O But I'm looking hard for the redeeming qualities, and no
doubt I will find them when I start looking inward.

>start looking inward.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
yup that's where it's at, baby.  There's the DJ called Barry Weaver,
I think he's from Portland; and  I was reading this interview with him 
once--he said some stuff that could easily be seen as shallow and
empty...but which I actually found kind of refreshing.

He said that too many people take raving too seriously; they are looking
for answers and are off on this spiritual quest; and only get frustrated
when find that there are no answers.  He said if people just focus
on having a good time, they'd be a lot happier.

Of course, there's a lot more to it than this...but I do
think that there is a certain wisdom to what he said.  I think a lot
of us (self included)  are in this rush for a spiritual 
quickfix.    

Maybe if we just ease up on the gas and just focus on having a
good time,  the rest (spiritual enlightenmnet) will just occur 
naturally.

I think that in reality, raves aren't really that diffferent from 
the real world, in spite of what a lot of us like to think.
There are cool people, arrogant people, jerks, giggly people, 
solemn people, ex-crackheads (HI!), spiritual types, and people just 
lookin to knock some
boots at the end of the night.

Hopefully though, we are leaning toward some sort of unity.  but
what the hell is going to happen when we get there???

Might be kind of dull.

anybody wanna fight? Mr. Adder?  Mr. Dreams?  Mr Lee?

love you kids.
We rock the house.

when they get all riled up... you just say in a calm voice...

"You aren't being inconsiderate are you...?"

"what?"

"This free tech support you're getting... for this software... something we
don't distribute... and don't suggest using... you aren't being
unappreciative..."

they generally get docile after that....

or my other fav is... when they are being real jerks....

"Do you mind holding forever?"

they say yes 90% of the time. duh.

tech support is sooo lame, but hey... you can make it fun.

whoever they are, they seem to have mystifying email powers - i got
the message they sent (regarding last/this weekend's party) today, but
it had been sent tuesday.  and now it's mysteriously missing again. 
along with the info line #.

anyway, i've heard some vague "good things" about them.  i seem to
remember reading about them in that camel-vehicle-magazine "sweater"
(which i actually found to be a good source of information). 
something about strange performance art in the middle of the dance
floor, or maybe some sort of bizzare circus acts.  i think that
they're from britain and live in a bus, which they drove here.  all i
really remember for sure was that the ones in the pictures all had
dreds and looked like they needed a bath.

anyone out there ever been to one of their parties?

hi folx...this is a post i made to midwest raves.  i thought this might
help take the edge off all the seriousness this week...read up and enjoy!

the best, mr s!  all the time mr. w!

***


I dunno...has like wicked ever thrown a party out there?  I guess that's a
stoopid question, cause like Mark Farina comes out here to the city all the
time.

someone mentioned in their post that it should have the music all broken up
into different slots and all that.  I think that is a good idea.  We threw
2 parties called "Warmth" out in SanFran, and that's pretty much what we
did.  Mixed up the music.

Then this kid walked up to me and said he was from another sound crew and
he didn't think it was a good idea to have this dj play after this dj
because the music styles were different.  i told him that was the whole
point.  the party went off, i personally felt i hadn't felth that good
about a party in at least 3 years.

...but you know, there is some value to having a one-room party with 4 dj's
all having at least 2 hour sets, playing good progressive house, techno,
acidhouse, with an ambient room or hallway, and the party ending at 8am,
fruit, coffee, tea served afterward, and getting to hang out in the space
for a few hours after the party instead of getting swept out on the street
like a piece of trash 5 minutes fafter the party ends.

The thing is, who is throwing parties like that any more these days?  I
suspect that since we are having this discussion online, not many.  Even
the party crews I considered to have those qualities I just listed have
seemed to lose some of their edge.

In my eyes, it's not really the music that makes the party.  It's the
people throwing it and attending it.

That I seperate into three distinct areas.

-The promoter(s)
-The promoter's crew
-The partygoers

There might be others but they can be grouped into these categories for
this time being.

The promoter has the most responsiblity to make the party good, because
everyone is looking at him or her.  And if they are treating everyone with
respect or disrespect, it can really affect the crew in a positive or
negative fashion.  That all trickles down on the people attending a party.
Ever been to a rave and sensed wheter the vibe was good or bad?  Look at
what's going on behind the scenes.  Watch what they do.  That will tell you
a lot.

But then responsibility also lies within all of uson how we REACT to our
environment.  That responsibility is individual.  One of the problems in
our country today is that most people are rEACTIVe, or allowing their
environment to control their attitude.  If any of you have lived near the
ocean, that becomes completely apparent, because you will notice that when
it is cloudy out, everyone is inside, and then as soon as the sun comes
out, everyone flocks to the beach.

so if you are reading this, maybe consider that next time you are at a
party.  if it is good or bad in your eyes, you have the power to react to
it in whatever way you want.  im not suggesting that you lie to yourself
and say it is good when you really don't feel that way.  but if it's bad,
you can A/ try to make it better by contributing positive energy to the
party, B/ leave and go home or go to another party that is better or C/
stay and complain all night.

oh, yeah, there are other choices, but i don't feel like listing them.

good night.

(ps, i wanna come spin out there!!!)

ummm...maybe we will dance ...or make art...or find 
interesting things to explore....like did you know that 
ravers have a unique mark on their navels that are different
from people that don't like raves? Look at your navel
you'll  see what i mean.

I think there will always be people or aliens or what ever
we evolve into that will always make life interesting.

Spiral Tribe is a sort of legendary crew from the UK,  a band of merry 
outlaws--
they were in it way back...
apparantly they started getting in trouble with the law; it sounds like
they were being targetted, so they packed up and left England and I 
guess they've been wandering the world
like nomads ever since.

here's the dirt below.  i have no idea about their music or the circus 
acts,
but i'm excited about going.

during the week, and ?? from home and other places, one of my e-mail 
accounts is used just to track the sfr list from the last week. Get too 
many messages from sfr, delete about 1/2 of them(such as threads that 
have gone on way to long and the like!)

work pop account checks every 10 minutes. 

Look at my school mail about once every 2-3 days.

BROWSER, JUST ONE LITTLE WEB BROWSER, okay okay just a telnet session, I 
know I'll just go down to city espresso, I can have it all there, wait,

"final five" contestants...but it's pretty much pre-set who's gonna

hi everyone...

well you kno,w i haven't been to w wicked party in quite some time.  like 2
years or something.  I was at this other party last night that was free and
good vibed, but for some reason when leslie mentioned wicked, it seemed to
fit.

i didn't really see anyone there from our online community, but i did see a
lot of people from the non-online community.  one thing i do like about
wicked parties is they are simple.  you know what to expect.  generally
good to great house music, usually one screen with simple psychedelic
visuals, not too many lights.

well i missed rob doten's set (can someone please clarify if Jim Doten
Acura is related to Rob Doten?)  but i gave him  a nice hug just for being
there.

Garth was playing when i got there.  A lot of people have said Garth hasn't
been up to par lately, I heard his music, and though I liked Markie and
Jeno's set for their mixing and music (this time, there have been times
when Garth tripped me the f*** out), Garth laid down some nice quiet but
mind boggleing tribal house mixed with some disco-style house.

I never know how to classify Markie.  I think that's why he's so good.  I
got a brief chance to speak with him after his set and found out he has
been mixing for 13 years.  He said he used to mix what we would call
"modern rock".  But his set kept me dancing and it wove into Jeno's set
very nicely.  They ended up having a very similar sound, though Jeno pulled
off some rEALLY nice mixes, the kind i could never describe in words.
Let's just say the songs overlapped very nicely, breaks and all, to where I
sometimes couldn't even tell what song was what.  That is very rare to
happen to me nowadays, because as a dj myself, I can usually hear the mix
no matter how on beat it is.

So if some of you up and coming dj's want to know where to look for really
good mixing styles no matter wHAT genre you specialize in, I would say look
to Markie and or Jeno.  I'll tell you, if some of you hard trance dj's
learned how to spin like these guys, you'd see me there in front of your
booth more often.

well, nuff said, thanks to leslie for bringing me back to an old familiar
environment.

     Hi All :-),
     yeps, it was really cool to meet all the nice and lovely people.
     I don't remember all the names (i happy that i understand the most 
     things).
     Now i'm hanging around at my app (with my new laptop :-)) and chill 
     out (get  energy for tonite).
     What's going on tonite ?
     I have now to do some work :-(, but later i will go to Marianne's 
     houseboat. This a cool place to relax. I dream with Andy and Marianne 
     from a BoatRave (we don't need Ibiza for this).
     You know, a lot of boat's, and on every boat a diffrent kind of sound:
     trance, ambient, hardfloor, drum'n'bass ....
     Maybe, there is a time we can realize this.
     I hope Maya is back online soon :-( Oh babes, i hate AOL. I want set 
     it up today, but i can't use a german check account for this (i lost 
     my visa card last week, and i must wait fir my new card :-( ). this 
     sucks.
     everyone knows an alternative (compuserve or what ever). i like to use 
     this f*** account only for chats.
     I hope i see you all again soon, i hope i recognize all again (i'm 
     very bad in remember how people looks (i hate alzheimer :-)). So, 
     don't be sad when i don't recognize you at a party or what ever, i 
     don't mean this evil. :-)
     
     Something to Priscilla (i don't have your email address here at home):
     hi, i hope you are online this weekend.
     i know you have a lot of work. but when you have time, please, please 
     call me
     it's very important for me (yeps, you hate to use the phone, please, 
     do it for 
     me)
     
     
     
     All again:
     It can be, that i have later no chance to get emails. Andy works 
     actual on our netware server (update), and he will shut him down. 
     maybe, this needs the whole weekend. Poor Andy :-(
     
     
     with all my love to you all
     harry - happy in cyberheaven

I've been off the list for a while now...

This is one of the many weekends that I have free from college and all 
the other bullshit politics of this world, but have a question for you all:

Sunset or Wicked?
------
Also, I'm really far away from the mixtape land of S.F., so I'd like to 
know what new tapes are out there in the categories of:

S.F. house tunes
Downtempo dub
Jungle
------
Finally, 

Whatever happened to:

Orson?
Maggie?
Adam Guevara?
Austin Woffington?

Bye!

I thought it was a SF House Collective , I don't think Wicked deals with
Full Moons anymore. Even though it used to be Wicked pagen celebration.

to maya and friends:  thanks for welcoming me and my group of friends
to your place last night.  we should have stayed longer but we all
needed to dance.  an apology for my friend's spillage, but she is a
helpful person living close by you, so the next time you clean the
house, let me know and she'll come over and help out.

general:  went to step2k, a jungle party which got busted at around
3:40 am.  i'm still trying to get use to jungle and so didn't get to
dance much.  but why judge a party on the music only.  got to meet
some fun and loving people there.  how neat, they had videogame setups
in a couple of rooms. played frogger (ancient atari's videogame) and
there made some friends from distance places.  

because of the lack of dancing, i have to go out again tonite.  spiral
tribe sounds like a good one.  hope it doesn't get busted up again and
hope to see some of U's there.  come and say hi if you wanna risk
being hugged.

hai

Hi all!  ]=}


 I've never heard any reliable rumors to support this; just mutterings on 
SFraves. My intial impression is that this is a scare tactic to sare away 
paying ravers.

 Any facts to back these rumors up? Any newspaper articles documenting 
this? Any reports from any AIDS/HIV treatment centers?

hugz,

Hey there,

      This is so true. I mean come on if people where getting stuck by

I think that I experienced the worst Sunday Morning wake-up call ever today.

9 am, after going to Party By The People, the phone rings. I certainly 
didn't answer it, for no one that I wanted to talk to would call that 
early. Worse yet, when the answerting machine clicks on, it is the 
POLICE. Scared, for nothing, I race to the phone, miss the caller, and 
have to call back. 

I call back, only to find out that some opne threw a rock through the 
window of our Record store, Capricorn Music. Now, there is a new 6 foot 
by 8 foot entrance to the store. On 2 1/2 hours sleep, I get to deal with 
filling this hole. 

Fun way to start the day.

Hope you all had a better morning.

Peace,
ES

It had been about 2 years or so for me too.  Decided I was about due for a
wind-warping, so I headed out for Wicked.  Boy, am I glad I did.

I agree.  Simple grooving.  Music is the main focus.  Everyone dances.

I missed RD's set, too.  Made it just in time to catch the end of Garth's
set.  He is not ususally one of my fav dj's but I was pleaseantly
surprised.  His set was okay.  I liked it better than many others I've
heard.

Markie, to me, is a *very* good dj, but I don't always like the music he
plays.  His mixing is polished and never boring.  His tunes can get a
little dark for my taste sometimes, but hey, he's Markie and it was a
Wicked.  What do I expect?  Wicked wouldn't be wicked without Markie's
darkness.

I also thought Markie & Jeno had a nice transistion between sets.  Jeno
pulled through for me and played a great set!  He brought me back to the
good ol' days of dancing for hours on end, leaving the dancefloor only to
visit the little girls room.  There was great vibe on the dancefloor.
Everyone was really into the music.  Friendly but not fake.  Positive but
not "PLUR"y.  An all around good time...

Now kids, don't let this discourage you...  Asking everyone to get it
together and dj like the wiked boys seems a ltlle unreasonalbe, don't you
think?  Everyone has their own mixing styles and I doubt mant people can
claim the 13 year mixing experience that Markie does.  IMO there are too
many up & coming dj's who model their mixing after Wicked dj's and focus
too much on trying to duplicate their sound, which is, of course, next to
impossible.  Use other dj's as influence, but don't sacrificce your own
fire in hopes of catching someone else's.

I think we were all due for a Wicked - it had been quite a while.  I am
really glad I went.  The music and dancing and people were all very cool
but I was particularly happy to see Brazilian Eddie.  After all, is a
Wicked complete without Eddie dancing around balancing a water bottle on
his head?  I think not.

Unitl next time,
Megan

Wicked rave!  I haven't been to a rave in a long time and I didn't see 
any of the elitist attitude that everyone is always talking about.  
Maybe I got lucky.  The girl that I went with wasn't feeling good so I 
had to bail around 2:30; anyone know how late the dj ended up spinning 
till?  Also, does Spiral Tribe create their own music or was that music 
from other artists that they mixed (all the wicked drum and bass stuff)?   
Anyone know the name of the first dj (the lady) that was spinning earily 
on before everyone showed up? Thx and peace,

Hey!

I tried to go to this party last night called "Goonies" where DJ Smile 
was gonna perform, but as of 11pm they hadn't updated the voicemail with 
directions, so I wound up just sleeping instead.  :(

So today, I went over to the park to help set up Green Eggs & Ham.  This 
being the last one for the season, they had open signups for DJs, so I 
grabbed a spot and someone else came over and signed Smile up for a spot 
too!!  So hopefully I'll get to see him, and smilegirl and maybe our man 
Spencer too!

Anyway, I'm kinda happy now 'cuz I get to see some SF peeps here in 
Orange County. :D

Hello Everyone--
well I've never put my .02 in before, but I felt that the party I went 
to last night definitely deserves some recognition.  I just moved here 
from San Diego and in the two months that I have been here, I guess you 
could say, I've had trouble adjusting to the scene.  Finally I took the 
advise of people who have been up here before and I went to a small 
party that sounded, well, interesting.  My friends and I arrived at the 
Spiral Tribe party early due to our fears that another location run 
around may occur as it did last weekend, so there weren't many people 
there.  Slowly the party picked up and the music was great.  I heard 
someone mention the girl who spun early that evening and I have to agree 
she sure knew her stuff, so if you find out who it was do tell!  Along 
with the music, I met some pretty cool kids, who gave me hugs, which I 
had been terminally deprived of.  Anyways, in nut shell I had a 
wonderful time and maybe one of these days I'll meet some of you kids 
too :) 
Come swim with me, beneath the depths of the deep blue sea~~~~~

i have to agree, this was a fun party, but there was too much

I like the parties where the dance floor is FULL and sweat is dripping from
the ceiling, and your clothes look like they had just been submerged in a tub
of water. it wasnt even that the location was that big , i guess there just
werent many people there. the music was good in the main room. i only visited
the second room once and there were like four people in there so i left.
Did anyone else see the popo's show up? my friends and i were kickin it
outside and they rolled up and told us to go home and that they were breaking
up the party.  we lagged for a while and then the cops left and the party
rocked on. 
well, all in all, it was definately worth the 5$ donaiton to get in.

yayaya....it was kinda a weird party that i have kinda mixed feelings
about. I just wish there were more peeps there that were totally into it.
The music in the main room was pretty kick ass, unfortunately not many
people were dancin'. 
Ya, i was inside when the pos came....it wasn't really happenin anyway, so
the "breakup" didn't make much of a differnce. But all in all i had a good
time since i was in good company :)

i have been thinking about something now that ive got my dishes
done for the evening and was wondering if any one had ever
tried this or would be interested in trying it.

I always see these really nice flyers saying that this party is for
some noble spiritual or humanitarian cause yet when you go to the 
party there is nothing remotely connected to this going on.

So i was wondering what it would be like to have a party
for a specific purpose, and ask everyone to be thinking about
solutions for that problem. Perhaps there could be a wall or
a computer where you could post ideas and read others ideas.
Perhaps these ideas could be discussed online and maybe action
groups could come from these discussions.

Just one problem a week....we will be in utopia in no time=)
and then we can all sit around and enjoy our green eggs and
ham in peace. (i wonder what makes green eggs green)

Nope, it's all the same messages, but sent out in convenient 60 Kilobyte
chunks (i.e. roughly 20-30 messages at a time) rather than as many separate
messages.  I'd guess there's 1-2 digests per day.

Fishy,

I think that's a fantasmic idea and would do whatever I could to help. I
think that parties are drawing more and more away from the *community*
aspect and more into the *MONEY* aspect. We need to keep it real as Vlad
always says. Which is 10000% TRUE.

Peace, love, blowpops and tcp/ip baby,
Byroni

Isn't Vlad that dude from Cool World?  Or is a different one?  If it's
the Cool World one, that has to be the most oxymoronic thing I've heard
in a long time.

Got to DNA at about 10:30am. Place was nicely decorated
not very many people there (about 15). They didn't
use the DJ booth but had tables set up on the stage
with some kind of link to the power the sound was
pretty
tinny' but had nice bass. I did not recognize the first
DJ but he had some skills and was throwing down some
nice morning Happy House. They had TV's broadcasting
the games upstairs with big couches, and in the back
there was a nice breakfast set up fresh fruit, bagels,
and a girl making fresh waffles (free of charge) making
the seven bucks to get in, more than worth it. There
were several DJ's trading off Marcellas, and some
others (sorry I did not recognize them) but they had 
several technical problems broken needles etc. which
meant one table running, needless to say I was really
wanting more. 

Right around 1:00 Doc Martin came on, I was dying to
here some good music but it just never happend. I was
dissapointed with his set. It just never quite got
going. I heard he had played a boat party the night
before, maybe he was tired. Not to mentions people
kept flailing into the tables.

The crowd was in good spirits (considering most of
the people I talked to had been up at least all night
if not longer 8). Lots of happy kids.

All in all this could turn out to be the next "Boogie
Buffet" if they can hash out their sound problems.

I have 1 sl1200 for sale with blue ortofon "dj" needle.  This unit

Looking to sell the turntable and the needle for $570.00.  

Also, a vestax pmc-01A mixer.  This is a cool looking blue mixer
with a wood front panal.  Again, it has not left my bedroom since I purchased
it new about 3 months ago.  $200.00

Need money for synths...

	o  Vlad is from Feelgood Entertainment.
 o  Coolworld doesn't promise anything they don't deliver.  They are in
the entertainment industry, they admit it, and they deliver it.  Their
fliers make it clear what sort of parties they throw.  

As far as I know, neither FGE nor CWP has ever done anything that isn't 
"real".
They give you what they say they're going to give you.  

Not being real is promising X while planning Y.

Is this hypothetical?

If I was in your place i would do **W H A T E V E R** it takes to give him
a better understanding of spirituality. I think this is the KEY to being
comfortable with life, death and everything in between. When you know what
you trully are you know what life trully is. You can increase your
spiritual undestanding in many ways. I can't tell you how differently I
feel now then a year ago. I wish I could have written a journal throughout
this entire journey. Raving has unlocked a part of me that I had been
oblivious to for so long. I knew I always had a better understanding then
most, but the experiences I've had in the last year has increased this
understanding immensely. Once your doors of perception are open you see
things are they trully are. You see what really matters, where you need to
focus your time/attention, and how to do it. I suggest getting some
books on the subject, perhaps joining a Spiritual-related group for
terminally ill people (or people with diseases and illnesses), and
listening to a lot of inspiring music... and going to parties with a lot
of friends. Anything that will move their thoughts away from the darkness
and into the light. We're all going into that light and we don't need to fear
 it. We need to embrass it. Because we are, in essence, a part of that
light. That life force. And besides, what is it worth fearing for? It's
inevidable, so why waste the precious time we have on something we have no
control over?

Going to underground parties would be a great thing. This is where you
feel the most love. Where you will feel that people really do care, and
that we are all are family. He/she is not alone and we are all there for
this person. We care and we will let them know this. Life is a journey,
and it's end is unpredictable. We're given no promises of how long we'll
be here, so we're all in the same situation. Just some of us are given an
idea before others. Yet we can all exit at any time.. any split second.
But if we focus on TODAY and look around for a moment and rethink our
priorities, goals and values. I think if we do this we can make each day a
life in itself. What's so good about living till your 70 anyway? I'm ready
to go whenever I'm requested...  maybe it will be today? maybe tommorrow,
maybe in 10 years, who knows.... but one thing I do know is that I'm loved
and that I will see you all again...

my $2.00 worth. :)

Hey ravers!!
I went to this nonprophit party on fri night and let me tell you all...
it was the BEST RAVE I have ever been to.
It was on Bryant in the little wharehouse down kinda close to the piers.
The people there were sweet. They had the best Deep Tribal..Deep jungle 
I have ever heard mixed. It was also the first indoor I have been to in 
a long time so it was a nice change from inhaling dust and dirt like at 
4x4, but don't get me wrong 4x4 was awesome to.
 the music was weak until about 1am
up until then it was this really bad sounding trip hop...i like trip 
hop, but not the crap this one dj was spinning. Then Carlos and Tracy(i)
started spinning and it was divine. I just could not stop dancing. I 
went up to Tracx and was like "what is your name" she told me and I said
I'll give you 500 dolllars for a tape if you have it! YOu are the best!
She was really cool. I had no food in my poor raver tummy, but i just 
could not stop dancing to the tribal. It felt like what a rave should be 
like...it was like a rave renaissance. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. There were 
fire dancers that busted out with fire torches and started doing these 
fire dances with each other. Then they swallowed the fire. Two girls got 
up with MiCS and started chanting/moaning with the mix...it was 
indescibable....so deep and so beautiful. BY FAR THE BEST RAVE 

hope all ya all had a good time on fri night too. :)

Well first of all, I'd put an NRR tag on the post. Second, I'd think
about what a sad topic this is for a monday morning.

I think it's an intriguing question, but at the same time, I wonder
why you would want to know such a thing. It's so highly personal, that
I don't see what benefit you would get from reading other people's
opinions.

Personally, I'd hope we live every day like it's our last no matter
what. So if you suddenly had 6 months, why change your habits?? Do
what makes you happy, which is all you should be doing anyways...

well what i think i am trying to say is if someone wants to know where to
look for good dj styles, look there.  not saying encompass their whole dj
career based upon those people.  my mixing style changed a lot after i
bought a mark farina tape, they are similar to wicked sound but not the
same.  in film classes i took all we did was watch other director's styles;
it was an effort to have us see how others have done to make a platform on
which to get started with.

dj'ing is not as complex as film but i decided years ago to take the same
approach.  i liked garth mostly so i bought a lot of his tapes.  i still
firmly believe they have some good styles of mixing, that smoother type of
transistinoi that i haven't really heard too many hard trance dj's be able
to pull off.  of course there has to be one out there i haven't heard of.

so i was stating a personal preference that if i heard that style mixed
with music i don't normally get into, i would "perk up" like a can of
Sanka.

yes.

Well if you are a Trance DJ and want some outlook on
some good stuff look to the Surgeon,BabyDoc, ESP
(woodyMcbride) These guys fucking rock live. The
Surg. has to be one of the best DJ's I have seen live
that plays trance His rekkids arent all that (IMHO)
but he rips shit up on the decks, So does Stacey
Pullen They both have very unique ways of Mixing..

I personally just had two people that my family and I were very close 
to die in a car accident together last Thursday. I agree that we 
should live for the day, everyday. Tell people whom you love that you 
love them everyday because you never know if you will see them ever 
again. And we never know when the Universe wants us to move on to the 
next challenge.

Well first of all, I'd put an NRR tag on the post. Second, I'd think
about what a sad topic this is for a monday morning.

I think it's an intriguing question, but at the same time, I wonder
why you would want to know such a thing. It's so highly personal, 
that
I don't see what benefit you would get from reading other people's
opinions.

Personally, I'd hope we live every day like it's our last no matter
what. So if you suddenly had 6 months, why change your habits?? Do
what makes you happy, which is all you should be doing anyways...

I just bought a new sl1200 for $479  including taxes.  Ortophon DJ's are
selling for $119 at Leos and they will usually drop %10 if you ask.  You
might consider dropping the price a little.

i completely agree with you, alex!  
i try my best to live everyday as if it were my last...  

but i do have a job and i do have responsiblities!  and although i'd like
to say that i love my line of work... i have to admit that i'm not quite
there yet.  
i think it takes time to find our niche in society... 
*what am i capable of? 
*what will make me happy?
*how do i get there?
*what occupation is best for me? 
...
yes... i do what makes me happy the minute i get in my car to start my
journey home, after a long day at work... and hopefully someday (soon) i'll
do what makes me happy from the moment the sun pours through the blinds-
til the moment it no longer shines... 
(although if it was a perfect life- i'd be waking up in the afternoon!
:)...  but until then, i do have to make sacrifices in one area of my life
so i have the time and $ to enjoy the other 1/2 of my life...
sooo.... i guess if i was told that i had 6 months to live, there would
definately be changes in my lifestyle!  i would take out a huge loan and
take some time off from work... say... 6 months? 
:)

Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. I can get a brand new 1200 from
Guitar Cetner for $469. And the cartridge w/ Needle are like $115. And
this is NEW stuff. Oh well. Or you can go to the trance and jungle factory
and talk to gold ole THomas Trouble and get on a list for $449........

  Neal....  In my opinion one thing that would be a real bonding yet exciting
and fun experience for him and a group of friends....(obviously including
yourself)...would be to go jump out of a plane together and FLY through the
sky....That would be something that no one could forget....tell him to go see
an Eastern/Holistic/Chinese type of doctor....they are known for healing
cancer....it is possible....but I wouldn't know too much about thses sort of
things....Im sorry that you have to experience....good luck!        MushyB

first...there is a cure for cancer.
The american government is fighting desperately to keep
this info from the people but are not having much success.
Do a web search for dr burzynski. I think his web page is
http//cancermed.com/bri.htm. If that doesnt work let me
know and i will find the correct one.

there ia also a good book called a "cure for all cancers"
which offers another approach that i really cant say
one way or the other weather it works, but it does have some
good info.

Secondly...as some of you know i almost died two years ago
from a fatal disease. I had what some call a near death experience.
while in this other world i saw what happens when we die and where
we go. This place is truly beyond words...incredibly beautiful.
Because i cant describe this in words i often use the metaphor
of the caterpillar and butterfly. We as humans in physical bodies
are just like caterpillars and after we die we become like a 
magnificent butterfly. 
Death is sad in the sense that we are loosing someone very special
but it is also a time of great celebration. the tibetan book of the
dead likens death to one final orgasm...we save the best for last.
Imagine the best orgasm you have ever had, now imagine
that happening on every level of your being, emotional, spiritual,
intellectual, physical,etc simultaneously and thousands of times
more intense... 

That is what happens when we die...its the most wonderful
experience there is and should be anticipated as such.

And what lies on the other side is even better.

if your friend has truely reached the point that death is
certain then there will be a light that he will become 
increasingly aware of...he should allow that light to grow
and it will become a source of strength as he
prepares for this transition

I payed 520+120+50(tax) for my equipement.  Has *anyone* actually purchased
a 449 turntable from Thomas Trouble? 

I think getting a 100 dollar price break for buying something that
has had only home use for 3 months is a very fair deal...  obviously
the price of new 1200's has dropped, so offers will be accepted.

Thomas is currently out of stock (at least last Thursday he was), but I
took his add in XLR8 over to Good Guys and they beat the price by 10%
(their standard policy on anything)  $449 less 10% is $404.10 plus tax is
$437.  The policy actually says that the item must be in stock at the
competitors (which it isn't) but the guy I went to in Emerryville didn't
bother to call over to check.  Your luck may vary on this part.  The going
rate at Guitar center is $479 which is the same price as pro sound  stage
and lighting (www.pssl.com).
New 1200's also have a two year warranty.

I don't mean to make your job of selling your stuff any harder, but as
someone who just went through the whole process of getting set up I know
that there are a lot of people saying a lot of different numbers out there.
 I just want people to be aware of what's out there.  Nothing worse than
spending a lot of cash on something and then realizing you paid too much.
It pays to shop around.   Besides, that leaves you more money for the most
important (and expensive) part ... the music.

FYI, T&J factory is always out of stock. However, just that ad in
XLR8R has prolly brought prices down all over the bay area...And that
rocks. 1200's were always overpriced in the bay area, and I sure there
are people besides me who remember when 1200's were rumored to be
going out of production and the price jumped from $400 to $500. And
gee, suddenly everyone had walls of them again...

it all depends on what his opinion is about the spirit.  as Nachiketa notes
in the Katha Upanishad, the only really important question that humans
should ask of God is "does the soul live after death, or not?"  if the
answer is yes, then it really doesn't matter what he does in this lifetime
and he should go on with life as he has lived it, continuing down whatever
path he has chosen, as that will be the most fulfilling.

but if he believes that upon death the soul is annihilated along with the
body,  i suggest that he explode with activity, spend and donate money,
make love to beautiful people, take lots of fascinating substances...

in short, live a life of gratifying the senses if they are all you have and
will soon disappear.

Andrew,

Thanks for that info. I'm going to be getting my decks in the next couple
of months.. since my roomate is moving and I can't use his decks anymore.
SO I actually have to buy my decks... :) But I've been lucky enough to be
able to buy records with the cash that I would have had to spend if I
didn't live with a DJ...  one of these days I'm going to raid every jungle
record store and get every good looking/looking good/cooking record
available..... :)

XL8R.... I need to get one of them mags...

On the hard trance/techno DJs that can't mix like Jeno thread... 

Keep in mind a lot of techno seems like it requires a slide rule and taped
up glasses just to figure out where the count starts... it's harder to
mix, but much more rewarding (IMHO), due to the amazing variety of tones,
heavy amount of experimentation on the part of the artists, and slightly
more avante garde approach to mixing (less obvious *please mix here*
points like those found on many trance, breakbeat and house records).
Plus there's a lot of it out there... [flames to me please if you're not a
techno believer thankyou]

So yeah, Jeno is smooth, but so is the music he spins.  If you spun techno
records the same way, you'd risk a boring set without that "house pulse"
to push the crowd through the night (that amazing quality about house
music that makes it just grooooooove for days).

I agree, a lot of the local/list DJs aren't at the "supahtight-beatmatch
and long transition like Jeno"  point (that andyw guy included), but it
doesn't mean they won't eventually, or that a lot of them don't hit that
point regularly, just not with the same consistency. We gotta keep
challenging each other, and raise our standards for ourselves and each
other as we accumulate experience and vinyl (so in a way thanks for the
post deepfog).

I'm still trying to figure out why amazing DJs who are creative and
innovative and technically _ON_ often seem overshadowed by DJs with
records that are often less than fresh and mixing that leaves something to
be desired (like, go back to beatmatching 101, do not pass go, do not
collect $200 kid...).  I guess it's talent /= success... 

I only know one thing for sure:
Diversity in an open scene means the music means whatever it means to
anybody who shows up I guess.

Er?,
Andy

Hay Byroni :) I am very honored that you quoted me.  That's very special.
Thanks.  :)

    BTW, I tend to agree with you on this, in the last few years I have seen
an increase of "$$ Return Motivation" for throwing events on the up-rise,
and the "Collective Goodness" of event production taking a secondary role.
This seems to be more apparent with the younger promotional crews than with
the old-schoolers, but it has definitely been more evident this last year
more than ever.   In our society we cannot factor money of  any business
situation, but it does not necessarily need to be such a prevailing factor
and motivater for organizing a rave.  I've learned early on that there is a
strong and direct correlation between the way a promoter prioritizes the
reasons for producing an event... and how the event will be perceived by the
people, and play a big role in the vibe of the event.
    We live in a financially driven society, and there are NO purists in our
community... but there are a lot of people with PURE intentions.  And as the
say "the Cream always rises..." and "Shit will always stink!"

Keep it Real

Yours in PLUR  ...   Vlad (aka Ray Vonie)

I would be curious as to what you think people would want to see at a
party for a nobel cause...???

This is a great idea.  I would like to see more people get involved in
organizing events like this.  It takes it one step further than just a
cash donation.  Its a wonderful idea.  I think that at the next FGE
event we will have a suggestion box setup for people to give input and
recommendations for solutions as well as the overall $$ donation.  It
will add a new level of involvement and interaction between the rave
community and the organization that will benefit from the rave.  It's a
very powerful idea.

BTW in case your wondering the next FGE event is called :  the SPIRIT of
Giving : A Thanksgiving PLURity Vibe-Fest.  It is a benefit for the Bay
Area Homeless Alliance.  So start thinking of your suggestions and ideas
to help with the homeless situation in the bay area.  It is still a
major issue, and it looks like its going to be a very wet and cold
winter.

hey, good to meet everyone at maya's place friday night!  thanks maya
for throwing a cool party!  unfortunately i had to disguise my
identity with an assumed name and brown fur hat, as the vatican mafia
has been hot on my trail ever since i started my own religion.  had to
leave kind of early too, got a tip off that l ron hubbard had sent
some of his goons to jump me and bust up the party.  headed to step 2
k but the sfpd found out i was there, i barely escaped their sting
operation.  gawd what a night!  sometimes i wonder if it's all worth
it...

my friends threw confunctional and i will pass your nice words on to
them.
but just so you know , carlos was not there.  Carlos was throwing his own
party in marin on friday.   Andre lucero from space children is probably
who you saw.
also it was not really near the piers it was in the mission.   and if you
were hungry you should have looked around because there was alot of free
food.   thanks for saying the things you said.   Raindance (the
promoters) barely broke even so they will be glad to hear the positive
feedback.   the space is owned by a collective so the group that owns the
place set the date for the party.   raindance probably would not have
chosen a date that went up against Wicked,SFhouse collective, and doc
martin at nikita.    next time hopefully more people will check it out.
peace

So start thinking of your suggestions and ideas

major issue, and it looks like its going to be a very wet and cold
winter.

That's What Ray Vonie wrote ( above)


I agree with you in the sense that something needs to be done with the 
homeless ANYWAYS, and to do something that is tied into a rave would be 
fantastic.  An idea that I have would be to make a day out of it.  Have a group of people come together and make sandwiches to pass out during the day, set 
up during sunset and party ALL NIGHT LONG ( ALL NIGHT...ALL NIGHT ):):):)
If fact, I have a friend who wants to throw a party and would probably be up for
that to happen.  I don't know if it's going to happen, but if it does, then let the picnic begin :):):):):)


Thanks for your time.

I think it's an intriguing question, but at the same time, I wonder
why you would want to know such a thing. It's so highly personal, that
I don't see what benefit you would get from reading other people's
opinions.

( that's what Alex wrote )

What is your view on support groups alex?  Don't you think that there
is a benefit to knowing that you're not the only one?

If *I* had 6 months to live, I would:
- work at my job for like a month and then quit so I'd have more time to 
do important stuff
- spend as much time as possible outdoors, and in the ocean
- tell everyone I know how much I love them
- spend as much time as possible with my parents and other relations
- party my ass off (plenty of drugs, booze, sex, etc.)
- write as much music as I could
- spend at least an hour a day in deep meditation so I could keep it all 
together and not freak out
- take time to talk to as many holy people from as many beliefs as I 
possibly could

and I wouldn't cut my hair or shave.  I would want to go out tanned and 
hairy if nothing else!

hello beautiful people,

my apologies for the wide distribution but i need help to understand
an event that i experienced saturday nite at spiral tribe, especially
from those who had been there and seen a chinese (asian for sure) girl.

so yeah there she was sitting along the wall with two guardians.  she
was uniquely tiny and young so decided to come over for a closer look.
 seeing me walking over, she developed a ghostly frighten look and
slowly shied her head toward the wall, with body squelching, arms
hugging chest, and knees bent. i have never seen anything like it
before so stayed at a distance and talked to one of the guardians.  it
was so unusual that i forgot some of my manners and hounded the
guardian with this circle of questions: "what's wrong with your
friend? why is she so petrified? is she alright? how old is she? why
is she being like that?"  the guardian kept dodging the subject and
finally asked me to leave. so cool but i hope that little girl is
alright and is in good hands.

i'm very haunted by the thoughts of that event.  could someone care to
try to explain?  

side notes: the promoters of spiral tribe are a cool bunch.  i had the
pleasure of talking to some of them personally and they gave new
meaning to PLUR.  

thanks&hugs,
hai

    Hiyaz!  I'm really ignorant about jungle parties and Step2K was like my
second one.  But is it common for people to be freaking and bringing in 6
packs of Heineken?  I kid you not, Meganz and I were chillin' and we see
this couple dry humping while this girl walks by with a mini keg.  ; )
    The vibe was really cool after we got there but when we first arrived we
saw quite a few goths (that's what they looked like anyway).  It was a cool
party overall until it got broken up.
    I was really happy to see lUUNATiK and SugeR, and I was ecstatic to
finally meet Matt.  I just wish I had worn my laminate because I didn't
realize how many people had gone to that party until I read all the posts.
    Anywayz, I was just kinda wondering what the diff between a standard
trance party was and a jungle party.  I'm not kidding.  : )

    : ) : ) : )  LOVE : ) : ) : )

Yeah, but I find that if you just drop Calculus, you just have to take it

I think it is interesting that people even try to speculate how they would
react to their own death and how their would spend the rest of their life.
Personally, I cannot even fathom how I would react or what I would do.
First, I would probably cry.  But then again, I tend to be somewhat of an
over-emotional crybaby sometimes. :-(  After that, I don't really know.  I
doubt I would spend too much of my time partying, though.  I'm not in too
much of a party head-space right now.
Whatever I did, I  would make sure to tell everyone everything I've ever
wanted to say to them.  Yeah, yeah... I know we're supposed to live each
day as if it were our last and all that crap but let's face it, who the
hell really does that?  Not me, that's for sure.  I've got lots of thoughts
in my head that never make it out of my mouth.  Sad reality but at least
I'm honest about it, right?
Megan

ps - sorry for the ho-hum attitude.  It's just been one of those days...

Friday night, went to Abstract Soul.  Heard Mark E. Quark, ran into Corey,
saw Loren, the place was packed, the music was good, the beer was cold, and
it was a good party! It's good to see plenty of folks out on a friday,
getting ready for the crackerjack hour.  Booze and weed can be good primers.

Anyway said goodbye to the bulk of my friends and headed over to Wicked.
Got settlted into a booth, saw alot of people out I normally don't see
these days.  Danced my ass off with my lady, with my neighbor (hey Astral
Matrix).  There were alot of people in that place but it wasn;t too
crowded, plenty of room to dance, and you could almost carry on a
conversation.  I heard the last part of Garth's set, and although I didn't
like the tunes, he was solid, then Markie took it over and banged the
f***ing drum.  The shit was stompin'! Next the Jeno got on and tore it up!
I was so good to hear the boys out, if for nothing but a gurantee of good
music at their party.  Jeno really did it and it was good to hear him
again.  Damn that boy smiles alot these days!  Good vibe, cool party!  Like
we used to do it!

Security was very cool, and I enjoyed that spot more than I thought (I
remeber in the day when the DJ was way at the top, it was such a
disconnected space).  Anyway they remodeled and the place was cool.  They
wre cool with in/outs if you didn't clown 'em (that meant if you said you
were going to come back you did, quickly (it amazes me people don't do
in/outs at clubs, f'ing restrictions).

Wicked was on, Abstract was on, time to go to bed for a couple of days...

That's that,
John

Subject: [NRR]  Why did the chicken cross the road?
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Just got this from a friend...had anybody heard this one yet?

Why did the chicken cross the road?

MOSES:  And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the
Chicken, "Thous shalt cross the road."  And the chicken crossed the
road, and there was much rejoicing.

FOX MULDER:  You saw it cross the road with your own eyes.  How many
more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?

RICHARD M. NIXON:  The chicken did not cross the road.  I repeat, the
chicken did NOT cross the road.

JERRY SEINFELD:  Why does anyone cross a road?  I mean, why doesn't
anyone ever think to ask, "What the heck was this chicken doing
walking around all over the place, anyway?"

FREUD:  The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken
crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES:  I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which
will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important
documents, and balance your chequebook.

OLIVER STONE:  The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the
road?"  Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time,
whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"

DARWIN:  Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally
selected in such a way that they are now genetically dispositioned to
cross roads.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN:  The road, you will see, represents the black man.
The chicken 'crossed' the black man in order to trample him and keep
him down.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.:  I envision a world where all chickens will
be free to cross roads without having their motives called into
question.

GRANDPA:  In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.
Someone told us that the chicken had crossed the road, and that was
good enough for us.

MACHIAVELLI:  The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who
cares why?  The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive
there was.

EINSTEIN:  Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved
beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

BUDDHA:  Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON:  The chicken did not cross the road; it
transcended it.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY:  To die.  In the rain.

COLONEL SANDERS:  I missed one?

Man, it would really suck to get to the Pearly Gates and have St. Peter 
look down at some transcript and say, "Well, you can come in as soon as 
you pass calculus.  See you next quarter!"

Personally, I think I would go and say goodbye to all of my dearest 
friends and family and go on a walk-a-bout sorta thing, just by myself.  
I'm thinking of the movie 7 Years in Tibet-Walk around, learn more about 
yourself and  other cultures, and how and why people live.  And when it 
was my time, I would pass away, only I would know, and my soul would be 
in existence for eternity.  Every person I that I have had in my life 
would hold on to a piece of my soul and never let that die.  Then it is 
on to the next life as a dog that gets hit by semi truck.  ;0 ouch!



   "Wisdom enriches the soul, not just the mind. It is different from 
mere intelligence, information, and cleverness, which dwell only in the 
mind.  Wisdom goes deeper than that.  When the brain, and it's 
multituinous facts and pieces of information, ceases to exist, the soul 
will endure.  The ageless wisdom of the soul will survive."
                 -from The Power Of The Witch(Wiccan Phillosophy)
                       By Laurie Cabot


P.S.  And while I am on my last trek with the Dali Lama I'll be sure to 
introduce him to Western cult magik called a "slinky"

yeah, i dunno, i sorta woke up and thought, what the f--k am i taking 
this class for anyway?  im damn near failing as it is....so i look up 
the major i want, and i don't even necessarily NEED it, i can take a 
much easier math class next semester...
but anyways, back to the whole 6 months to live issue at hand:

i would definately DEFINATELY remove all extraneous stress from my 
life and be wild and free and ALIVE while it lasts...and then worry 
about what comes next AS it comes next.

i got, like, light.
	in my pocket and all throughout my body.
big unspeakable flashbulb goin' off inside.
silver flying fish
come leaping outta my still waters.
perhaps it's ALL in my mind.
but now it's in your mind.  and your mind.
calm virus spreads from these words, now you've got
infinite golden radiance.
everyone's turning golden.

take me now in your hot embrace.
welcome me into your shaking arms.
let me kiss you
--o just once--
and leave the print of wine and rose petals on your heart.
listen to it beat.
beat.
beat.
beat.
and hearing that you know
what kind ov MYSTERY you got brewin,
just waiting to be drunk.

Howdy folx;

One of you knows me (Hey Siphon!) The rest don't.  I'm not a raver.
Been to one rave, Siphon spun it for us on a camping trip this summer -
What a trip!
(and I DO mean -trip-!)  Since July, I've been lurking here and
reading.  One of these nights I'll makE it out to a rave, but not yet.
;)

However, my girlfriend has done a few mixes, and really enjoyed it.  She
no longer has a mixer to use, and I was just thinking about Christmas
around the corner..  Where would I go to buy a mixer, if I wanted to?
I'm interested in the possibility, at least.

Thanks for any help you could provide!

In a message dated 97-10-07 17:06:32 EDT, you write:
<Why do people think slower = mature>
<< #1    because this is the style of  music from the  disco glory years 
 when alot of people first found the rave (91-92-93)   these people are
 mature now>> 

I thought disco was from the 70's?
 
 <<#2   because more places that are 21+ play this kind of music.   when is
 the last time you saw or heard of a 21+ night of all breakbeat and
 trance?  parties that play predominantly breakbeat and techno often have
 a younger crowd.>>
 
 All the time, just not in SF!!. LA, NY, especially England - some of the
biggest clubs are 3 floors, 8 hours of techno, jungle and trance - nothing
under 180 BPM (except the chill room) and the average age at most techno
clubs is 25-30. Its the house clubs that attract the kids (18-20) except in
the North where happy hardcore is popular with the younger crowds. Over there
techno (real Detroit or German techno,  not Chem Bros/Underworld
 "electronica" techno) is what is considered more mature.

<<#3   most people who are older and still going out are not on speed that
 much so a slower deeeper groove feels right>>

  That doesn't make much sense to me- if you're not on speed you would need
fast                                        music to keep going, slow music
would slow you down.But if you've got good music you don't need drugs . Are
you saying young people dance fast and are on speed and older people dance
slow and aren't on speed? 

<< #4  soul and funk isn't something that you "get over" anyway. (if you
 truly feel it in the first place)>>

I agree but the point is there should be some variety.
 
 #5  alot of this type of music comes from either chicago or england.     
 chicago is the originator of house music( late 70's) and england was
 really  heavy into house music in the eighties before everyone started
 talking about "electronica".  so this type of music has history and
 sophistication.   i guess you could call it mature as an art form.
 
 #5.a   san frandisco has a bunch of dj's from england and at least one
 from chicago so these people have experienced house music that many of us
 have never known if we have only been paying attention to dance music for
 the last 5 years or so.   
 
 so if alot dj's in sf aren't playing the latest progressive hits from
 mixmag, 
 or trying in vain to mix two dat tapes full of goa,  these might be some
 of the reasons  ( in my opinion of course)
 
 HOUSE MUSIC WILL NEVER DIE
 peace
 gabe >>

The other reasons sound like what you are saying is we are 10 years behind
the times! I agree!  What is wrong with hearing some new music? Don't be
afraid of the future or trying something new! It all goes back to people's
need to cling to the familiar and the past. Retro and classic rock stations
are the most popular.....10 years from now all the clubs will be playing
happy hardcore!

IMHO....jd (thanks for the food for thought)

Yup, I went.  The security wasn't very friendly though.  The EAR sound was
ok, but there was a lot of the room where the sound wasn't very good.  The
visuals weren't the best either.  All together there was probably about 400+
people there.

The one thing that I didn't like at all was the competition between Sac and
SF dancers.  All fuckin night long there was this huge circle of Sac and SF
dancers goin' at it.  When nobody was dancing in it, my friends just went
in and started dancing because it was a waste of room.  My friends aren't
the greatest dancers either, and when they started dancing, people were
looking at them like they were crazy for going in the circle.  Anyways,
nobody was going to say anything to my 2 friends because they are both
about 5'11 250lb
guys.  But the competition was just crazy.  There was no vibe at all.  

As far as location, it has been the same wherehouse over and over again.
The one off of wherehouse ct.  One big room and an outside area.    

DJ's: Donald Glaude- o.k. but could have done better
      
      Tony- pretty good through the middle of his set, the begining of his
           set he played too much "tribal" house for me though.
      
      Dreamer- he was ok but a lot of the same 'ol shit

      Carlos- He pretty much tore shit up.  I like the way he drops in
beats	              by "scratching" them in, if you know what I mean.  He's
cool
              because he really gets into the music.  He had double booked
              that night, so he couldn't stay long.  He played at "Love" as
              well.

      Spun- I have no idea what or when he played.
    
      Paul Gordon- I don't know when he played either.    
     
The only bummer for me was the bunk E that I got, and not to mention I got 2
of them for me and a friend.  Oh well.
Overall the party was a 5 out of 10.

Well my weekend started off good. I get off a hard
days work.Ready to go to the party. This was a
underground Trance/Tekno/DnB party if you will, So we
get ready and head out. We get to the location and it
is nicely decorated plenty of nice black lights and
banners all over the place. Not much on the way of
lights but it was a small UG and Free so it fit in
nicely. I wanted to see Li and AndyW play but as I
was walking in the door Li was getting off and my Boy
Science was getting on. Now im not ver knowledable in
the way of jungle stylies but Science was playing
some good fast paced stuff. He was also doing some
Turntable Trickery he was cutting and back queing and
stuff. It was nice not to packed or too empty there
was about 200 people it was a Viberation party BTW. I
was waiting for the Intimadator to go on I had heard
him at a CFC party before and he rocked my world. He
gets on and he did not go off as hard as I would have
liked him too. He was good but I expected to much. I
hate when I and other people do that as well. Then my
boy Siphon was up. He was playing more Trancey breaky
kind of DnB I think it is called tech step? Correct
me if im wrong. So im lounging upstairs chit chatting
and being sillie then I hear Bam,Bam,Bam from
downstairs and I am like Shit who is playing that
poundy Tekno so I walk downstairs and low and behold
it is My man Micron ripping shit up. Now you have to
understand one thing:

Micron= Trance
Macadio= Tekno

So when I hear him playing stuff I would be scared to
play it blew my mind. Heheh Hi Dan He was slicing and
dicing nice set. He does this one trick with this
rekkid called "Getdown" if you have not heard it yet
I am sure he will do it again somtime this is a must
to hear and watch. Very nice party!!.

Then Saturday we head out to this Real underground
trance party in a nice fresh new space it had nice
visuals sound and laser. Joe Rice and MR.E were
laying down the phatest tracks. I had never heard Joe
in a complete set and he was playing some nice hard
house. and MR.E played some nice Cyber. The crowd was
nice but a lot older then I had expected it was more
like a older PSY/Hippie party. But the hosts were
very nice and I had a decent time.  That was my
weekend in a nutshell See ya all soon.

Ermine,

Nice name. 

You can get a good priced mixer at the Trance and Jungle factory for about
$228. Get a 3 line Numark. Perfect to start with...... or youc an spend
$600 and get a rockin Rain (sp?).... the T&J factory is run by a cool guy
named Thomas.... "Hey mate".. :)  call 411 if you're in the 510 and ask
for the Trance and Jungle Factory in Berkeley.. if you're out of the 510
.. dial 15105551212 and ask the same pregunta (question).

Peace, love, and frame relay.

top, then boom, back to trance beat. is that it? almost sounded like
DnB, but not quite. REALLY AWESOME SHIT! nice party, great people, and
I'd say a more mature crowd rather than older.

     Hi all this is a message from Marianne:
     
     
     Hey could you forward a message of thanks to Maya and the others at 
     her little gathering.  I would like to say thanks for putting 
     something together for folks to meet.   Even though I am not 
     technically on the mailing list, i hope it is ok to consider myself a 
     fellowfriendlyraver too.  Like people with boats, it is always fun to 
     find others who share in desires and music.  Andy and I keep talking 
     about having a rave on a boat.  If we could only find a big enough 
     boat to handle all of the phat sounds.  
     
     luv 2 u, mc (marianne)

Break Dancer,

I feel you man. I haven't remembered a dream in ages and what do you
know?... 2 days ago I have a dream that me and my ex are back together and
that she loves me once more. This is more than a dream, this is a fantasy
that i lived for nearly 4 years. Then it shattered on my birthday last
year. :( It's been a very depressing year for me.... I'm so happy that
I've met all of you and received the love you all radiate through
cyberspace and at the great parties we attend. The rave scene helped save
me and renew my pride and belief in myself.... this is such a beautiful
thing. Penicilin for the soul.

Byroni

ps. speaking of long boring babbling... you're probably refering to my
posts... :) oh well....

it sooo broke my heart and i still feel "the pangs and arrows of 
outrageous fortune." 
i hardly ever remeber my dreams...... why when i do does it have to be 
of her??
i miss her and want to call her, but my pride wont let me...so i dont
i need to find someone else, someone just as special, who is right for 
me.. thats what ive been saying for the past year, but it hasnt 
happened...oh well.. maybe when iday, probably when i least expect 
it..someone beautiful will cross my path and we'll know were right for 
each other.. i hope :)   gotta think positively ya know...
well thats all for now....
Peace

Hmmmm.  I got my dm1260x (3 phono/line Numark) for $175 at K & K Music.  
Maybe it was cut cause I bought decks and the mixer, still.

May want to have a look around before just rolling to TnJ.

Isn't it Breakbeat? Its getting a little ridiculous
its like, Oh! I threw in a trance rekkid lets call
it Break Trance. Its Breakbeat with trance lines
layered over it. The majority of the music is
Breakbeat. I agree with you it all sounds like
Breakbeat to mi (IMHO)

     Hey Brother,
     
     One thing I've learned about love is that:
     
     "The Harder you look for it, The Harder it is to find"
     
     It'll happen when it's the last thing on your mind...
     
     Good luck, and have fun!!! You're single!!! Appreciate it for what 
     it's worth... It's a very invigorating feeling, knowing that you can 
     stand alone. That nothing or no one can hold you down... Peace! <JCO>
     
     PS: When things get hard, a strip joint helps!!! ;}

of her??

i need to find someone else, someone just as special, who is right for 
me.. thats what ive been saying for the past year, but it hasnt

it..someone beautiful will cross my path and we'll know were right for 
each other.. i hope :)   gotta think positively ya know...

Remember this guys: Yesterday is history and tomorrow
is a mystery, but today, is the present. It is just
that a gift, so treat each day as it was a precious
gift and nothing will ever pass you by.

Hi all!  ]=}

 Went to  a completly UG party Saturday that was soooo much fun!! (Hi to 
Macadio-thought that was you but wasn't sure so I didn't say Hi!) Party 
was way fun with incredible vibe and kind mature folks everywhere (YEA!!)
Hi to everyone I saw.

 One reason for the specialness (other than a nice reminder from the 
promoters to be thankful for all that we have accomplished for ourselves 
this year-this IS the harvest season ;), was that this was a "coming-out" 
party for me and my new love.

 Amy Starkey and I have been seeing each other for about a month now (and 
a wonderful month it has been!  :) and we felt secure enought to make this 
party our ""official" announcement that we are a couple.

 We are soooo in love that both of us are kinda blown away! I"M SOOOO 
HAPPPYYY!!  I have *never* had a realtionship with anyone before like 
this before. It feels so right and perfect and to know that the feeling 
is felt by Amy also makes my knees all rubbery.   :)

 I would like to thank *everyone* (even those I have been at odds with!) 
involved in the scene here. Amy and I met through SFraves and later at a 
FnF party. (I think I'm gonna cry) Who knows what roll everyone had to 
play in order for Amy and I to finally get together.

 Remember folks; just about anything is possible.


			I LOVE YOU AMY!!!



and all the rest of youse folks as well!  :)

hugz,


 Ran D. Dreams

yeah! my niffty computer is hooked up again, so i can write my 
mini~reviews ;)

Sat. nite...i scored a pass to the <<Global DJ Mix Awards>> private 
boat party!  It took true talent to dance on a rockin' boat!  The 
awards were presented there...

**Doc Martin** got "Best Technical Trick DJ" and he proved it later 
when he played a record UPSIDE DOWN, yes the famous trick that my eyes 
have been waiting to see, so the record was suspendend OFF the pad, 
balanced by my goodness, was it a pencil?? and he placed the needle 
UNDERNEATH the record, thus playing it BACKWARDS, of course everyone 
went BALLISTIC!!! He just had a baby, so now there is a little Baby 
Doc Martin ;)
*Little Louie Vega* played and *Marques Wyatt*, a little too 
Houseymousey for me, but they are still great.  The Boat Party was 
groovy, an amazing light show was projected on the wall of Alcatraz!
Organic presented by FTT in GG Park was a nice treat, DJ DAN and 
Hector provided their best! the sound system was awesome! But due to 
kicking up all the dust, my new adidas are history, oh well.

***HOWIE B*** the only event i actually payed for all weekend and $5 
was nothing to get to hear him at <<ULTRA>>  he totally challenged 
your body, you were in the groove and NoPe, sampling, sampling, how 
many samples does it take to almost drive you insane?? He's amazing 
and so adorable, but i was hoping to see his G~friend, my favorite 
nymph *BJORK* but no sign of her, unless she went unnoticed which she 
gets away with all the time!

Well that my "Mini Review" until <<TRIBAL MASSIVE>> and <<JAMIROQUAI>>
XOXO

Man, I was listening to a very old tape of a very old compilation that is
still in stores.  It's called XL Recordings "The American Chapter".  Holy
Shit.  It's got the good ones like T-99 (Anastasia; speaking of which,
has anybody seen their album "Children of Chaos" on vinyl?  Or have it on
vinyl?), also Cubic 22, Johnny L, old skewl Prodigy, etc.  It's from 1992
and has some really kewl shit on it.

I strongly recommend it if you wanna get nostalgic back to a magical
period in the rave scene.

That is the perfect philosophy to go by!!!  I learned that (not
specifically love but stuff in general) from a Zen/Buddhist book I read a
year ago.  Never try to attain something.  It will only come to you when
you don't dwell on it.  Plus, it just makes life easier, especially when
you're dealing with relationship type stuff.

KEWL.

my co-worker wrote these poems while working on a spam filter for our
email server.  i know this has abosolutely nothing to do with raving,
but i felt that electronically replicating these poems in the virtual
mailboxes of hundreds of people who didn't ask for them was a fitting
tribute to his zen craftiness - i laughed, i cried, i attained
enlightenment.

I had a wonderful time on Friday night @ Maya's...  Good company.  I was
happy to meet  you all.  Thank you.  I wish I could be more exuberant,
however...I am preparing a fairly massive bad trip report for my Saturday.
Including apologies all around.  Kind of my way of clearing the head.  I
have to put it down in writing somewhere, but don't want to bother you all
with my extra special f**k up.  I will be mailing a few people directly.

For those of you interested in hearing/recieving a copy...  [please do if
you were there]  Please mail me direct with subject along the lines of
"What's up?"

Hugs to Maya for bringing us all together.  Maya lost her 'net access so
she isn't getting to hear all of our positive comments.  I'm happy to say
that I left Maya's feeling warm and grounded. I like meeting new peeps.
As of late, I've chosen to live a hermit's lifestyle; sorting my life out,
healing, finding my path, learning to love myself.  Raves have been a
great place for me to sort things out and learn things about myself.  It 
was SO nice to just sit down and share stories.  i'd love to host a little
party, but unfortunately my living arrangements are not conducive.
 
Afterwards, I got stumped at the step2k mappoint, so I cruised over to
1015 for a little DJ mix awards.  DJ Dan spun a tune with a
Joni Mitchell sample in it, "don't it always seem to go, that you don't
know what you've got till its gone."  I heard this and went totally nuts!
Bouncing around slapping people on the behind, hugging strangers, grinning
all the while.  Who, what, where!?  I must have this tune.  And if that
weren't enough, the next song he mixes in has Stevie samples in it.
Samples and beats.  I love it.  

On saturday, Tsunami at the Trocadero went off.  All sorts of layered
trance music pounding away and people bouncing and flailing to the beats.
Upstairs, there was a dj mixing up some really groovy trance, some had
breakbeats in it, others some house flavor, very diverse.  I forget her
name, something like beth johnson?  I liked it a lot. The big day-glo
murals and batiks covered the whole club.  Every wall had a gorgeous work
of art on it, enhanced by yer fav' wavy gravy substance.  

That's all fer now, everyone have a good week.  

Regards,
George

wow, i must say, it's kinda cool to hear guys spill their guts a 
little.  i guess everyone has a broken heart story.  
yeah, that's the thing tho... 'it' never happens when you are looking 
for it.  so stop looking/dwelling/obsessing.  there will come a day.  
:-)  appreciate these days of freedom....

Sharing my broken heart.  I could do it.  Although, I think you would
change your  mind about it being cool to hear guys spill their guts.  No,
actually, I think it's the "a little" that would make me "spilling my guts"
or telling my "broken heart story" be excessive.

I have a rep for being a story teller, and it would be nothing more than
once again, spilling to someone  reluctant to hear.

slap me for having feelings.
wish you all the peace i seek.

Hi all!  ]=}


 Me and some pals are calling some of this new stuff "Goa Breaks". A good 
example (IMO of course) is "Buffo" from Ceiba's upcoming release "The 
Language Of Light 2" (ETA is estimated at this fall). Although on the 
promo hand bill all tracks are labled as "psychedelic tracks".   ;)

 Heard this track for the first time at Burning Man '97. As Ceiba/Kode IV 
were burning up the dance floor with this track, Rob Rayle (who himself 
played an excellent live/CD--DJ set the night before) leaned over and 
remarked how nice it was that Adam was playing the new track he and Adam had 
worked on (composing/creating that is).

hugz,

Hugs to Maya for bringing us all together.  Maya lost her 'net access so 
she isn't getting to hear all of our positive comments.  I'm happy to say 
that I left Maya's feeling warm and grounded. I like meeting new peeps.
As of late, I've chosen to live a hermit's lifestyle; sorting my life out, 
healing, finding my path, learning to love myself.  Raves have been a 
great place for me to sort things out and learn things about myself.  It 
was SO nice to just sit down and share stories.  i'd love to host a little 
party, but unfortunately my living arrangements are not conducive.
     
Afterwards, I got stumped at the step2k mappoint, so I cruised over to 
1015 for a little DJ mix awards.  DJ Dan spun a tune with a
Joni Mitchell sample in it, "don't it always seem to go, that you don't 
know what you've got till its gone."  I heard this and went totally nuts! 
Bouncing around slapping people on the behind, hugging strangers, grinning 
all the while.  Who, what, where!?  I must have this tune.  And if that 
weren't enough, the next song he mixes in has Stevie samples in it. 
Samples and beats.  I love it.  
     
On saturday, Tsunami at the Trocadero went off.  All sorts of layered 
trance music pounding away and people bouncing and flailing to the beats. 
Upstairs, there was a dj mixing up some really groovy trance, some had 
breakbeats in it, others some house flavor, very diverse.  I forget her 
name, something like beth johnson?  I liked it a lot. The big day-glo 
murals and batiks covered the whole club.  Every wall had a gorgeous work 
of art on it, enhanced by yer fav' wavy gravy substance.  
     
That's all fer now, everyone have a good week.  
     
Regards,
George

   Dreams are pathways into an individual's soul, they are used, seen, 
and heard by all, but not too many people can decide what they actually 
can be used for.  If only people could actually feel, and make their 
dreams a part of their reality.  This whole world would be way more 
random.  Just when you thought I was going to say something really 
intelligent...nope  :)
Dreams are wonderful and without them, we would not be talking about 
this right now.
Last night, I actually had a magnificent dream of a little, cute family 
of
Slinkys during the Christmas time, openning presents, and getting all 
o  wrapped up with eachother, but then it became a huge mess, they     
 o  were all tangled up, and then a beautiful jumbo jet crashed into  
  o o0 o0 their little cute Slinky home, then they came to live with
   0  O  o Me.  (Contents of this dream may not be suitable for ravers 
under the age of 99)

Later and sweet dreams,
Danny

Hey, I know a couple of friends who do an amazing pyrotechnic display.
They start out by eating lots of cabbage, broccoli, and refried beans.
Then they have this little stage set up with small tiki torches and
sparklers.  With these they proceed to blow fire out their asses.
Damndest thing I ever saw...

Hurray for Harry!

I was also disapointed by the fact that Maya was not getting all of 
this great feedback about SFR Movie night, which was a wonderful 
experience that should become a regular event (IMHO). 
So, thanks Harry for making sure that Maya hears about the praise she 
deserves for creating and hosting SFR Movie night.

Freud on Seuss
    
A book review by Josh LeBeau (copied from the Koala, UCSD's humour 
newspaper, which has no copyright notices in it anywhere) 

_The Cat in the Hat_ by Dr.Seuss, 61 pages.  Beginner Books, $3.95

     The Cat in the Hat is a hard-hitting novel of prose and poetry in
     which the author re-examines the dynamic rhyming schemes and bold
     imagery of some of his earlier works, most notably _Green Eggs and
     Ham_, _If I Ran the Zoo_, and _Why Can't I Shower With Mommy?_  In
     this novel, Theodore Geisel, writing under the pseudonym Dr.
     Seuss, pays homage to the great Dr. Sigmund Freud in a nightmarish
     fantasy of a renegade feline helping two young children understand
     their own frustrated sexuality.  The story opens with two
     youngsters, a brother and a sister, abandoned by their mother,
     staring mournfully through the window of their single-family
     dwelling.  In the foreground, a large tree/phallic symbol dances
     wildly in the wind, taunting the children and encouraging them to
     succumb to the sexual yearnings they undoubtedly feel for each
     other.  Even to the most unlearned reader, the blatant references
     to the incestuous relationship the two share set the tone for
     Seuss' probing examination of the satisfaction of primitive needs.
     The Cat proceeds to charm the wary youths into engaging in what he
     so innocently refers to as "tricks."  At this point, the fish, an
     obvious Christ figure who represents the prevailing Christian
     morality, attempts to warn the children, and thus, in effect,
     warns all of humanity of the dangers associated with the
     unleashing of the primal urges.  In response to this, the cat
     proceeds to balance the aquatic naysayer on the end of his
     umbrella, essentially saying, "Down with morality; down with God!"
     After poohpoohing the righteous rantings of the waterlogged Christ
     figure, the Cat begins to juggle several icons of Western culture,
     most notably two books, representing the Old and New Testaments,
     and a saucer of lactal fluid, an ironic reference to maternal loss
     the two children experienced when their mother abandoned them "for
     the afternoon."  Our heroic Id adds to this bold gesture a rake
     and a toy man, and thus completes the Oedipal triangle.  Later in
     the novel, Seuss introduces the proverbial Pandora's box, a large
     red crate out of which the Id releases Thing One, or Freud's
     concept of Ego, the division of the psyche that serves as the
     conscious mediator between the person and reality, and Thing Two,
     the Superego which functions to reward and punish through a system
     of moral attitudes, conscience, and guilt.  Referring to this box,
     the Cat says, "Now look at this trick.  Take a look!"  In this,
     Dr. Seuss uses the children as a brilliant metaphor for the
     reader, and asks the reader to re-examine his own inner self.  The
     children, unable to control the Id, Ego, and Superego allow these
     creatures to run free and mess up the house, or more symbolically,
     control their lives.  This rampage continues until the fish, or
     Christ symbol, warns that the mother is returning to reinstate the
     Oedipal triangle that existed before her abandonment of the
     children.  At this point, Seuss introduces a many-armed cleaning
     device which represents the psychoanalytic couch, which proceeds
     to put the two youngsters' lives back in order.  With powerful
     simplicity, clarity, and drama, Seuss reduces Freud's concepts on
     the dynamics of the human psyche to an easily understood gesture.
     Dr. Seuss' poetry and choice of words is equally impressive and
     serves as a splendid counterpart to his bold symbolism.  In all,
     his writing style is quick and fluid, making _The Cat in the Hat_
     impossible to put down.  While this novel is 61 pages in length,
     and one can read it in five minutes or less, it is not until after
     multiple readings that the genius of this modern day master
     becomes apparent.

hey all you lightweights
whats up with the 16 year old ravers who think they are such the shit that
dont dance? i thought it was illegal at raves here not to dance all night
without stopping ;) 

it is where i come from you get thrown out of raves if you sit down for
too long

spiraltribe has a lot of terrific music that people all over the world
unite with and dance their hearts out to, dazncing to sounds unavaliable
anywhere in t he blown up prodigy infested world of techno today.  how
come the kids here just
stand there and brush their hair back and look at each other?  or is it
the norm when the music isnt recycled same ol same ol music... 

these people drove a f'n long way to present their music to the "most open
minded city in the United States" i guess the most openminded
representatives werent representing at the most recent free techno
gathering in sf.

sorry for the funny tone of this message, im just confused a little with
what the new
minds into "raving" ie: sitting around combing their hair and not dancing
their hearts out are thinking

... when i was getting into raving, a little bird told me the true
hardcore ravers were in it to dance themselves to a new level, not to sit
back and complain that the "music is not doing it for them" when the music
was different, translate that into a new movement in dance, rather than
gawk and sit...

oh well i think im caught in an evil non creative non open minded vortex
where raving is more about being "cool" nowadays... heheheh too many
yuppie children, not enough baby busters ;)

anyway, for all you creative minds musicians, artists zippie
representatives of the most radical city in the United States of America,
definitely definitely check out the free spiraltribe 3 day festival on
halloween weekend every one of their three day festivals is truly
unforgettable

heh heh

those two people on the sides of this asian girl often are refered to as
"guides"

if you ever want to see brooklyn in its finest form ill be your guide 
youll need it

brief anecdote regasrding my last experience in brooklyn... heheh just
imaging SPRINTING across the williamsburg bridge (about as long as golden
gate) execpt a narrow footpath over top of bridge being chased by insane
crack fiends desperately in need of guides... and those were only 2 of
like 300 people at the party...

one thing about brooklyn is you dont want to stop dancing because you
seriously dont want to look at the people NOT dancing...

Ok... so I plan to go to this party/weekly in sac, cause its close to 
Davis...  I get shitty ass directions and it ends up taking me 1 hour to 
get there.. oh well. it was only $5..
 the music is all good.. it was house, if thats what you call it...
i just call it music...
its all music..
so i got in the break circle for a bit... but the music wasnt loud 
enough there so i moved to the dancefloor wherer it was a little 
louder...
the vibe wwas pretty cool.. my favorite part was when i closed my eyes, 
ignored everyone around and danceed my heart out.till they turned off 
the music at 2:00!!!!  early.. but its a club...
so it took me 15 mins to get back home.. and here i write my review..
I had fun.. but Next time I would like to go with someone..
Its cool going to parties by yourself, but one tends to get a little 
lonely... :( with no one to talk to. so next time your at a party and ya 
see someone chillin.. go up to them and say high.... :)
later peoples
peace

I'll preface this review by warning that I am not completely unbiased, as I am
friends with the people involved, but regardless, NO TV is a nice change of
pace, a unique environment, and a perfect wind down for Monday. 
The front room of 1015 was set up a space for local artist to create/show
their work - the main room was transformed to a living room/lounge setting,
with all the big comfy couches brought onto the floor in a semi circle and the
disco ball lowered as sort of a centerpiece. Many chairs and stools to sit,
candles, candy, fruit and veggies, and mellow music to start out.. then Freaky
Chakra played live and anyone who's seen him before knows - he rocks! Very
original music of differing paces and beats. Then Henrik finished up with some
classic danceable house music. It was a great mellow lowkey  vibe -
If anyone remembers the Gardening Club it reminded me a lot of that. (Not just
because its on a Monday!) In 2 weeks Mark Farina will be playing -
unfortunately it is 21+........        jd   :)

   well, it's been a secret until now.
 the Evil Dr. Suess, genetic expeirmenter!
 Green eggs from Green chickens is but one of his developments.
 With funding from the underground Cat supremecy movement.
 The cat in the hat books were warnings , you notice that there's a picture 
  of him on EVERY book!!!  
   that was done to desensatize you to cats walking and talking ,wearing
hats.  
   they also showed you the evolution of the cat, remember in the book the
cat                  
   removed his hat only to reveal another, SMALLER cat each in turn had
another                                      
   smaller cat under his hat.
   get the picture?
    the green eggs and ham books were showing the world what Dr.Suess was 
     acomplishing.
    the man was a master of manipulation, Genetic manipulation! 
    THE CATS ARE HERE !!!!!!!! THEY ARE AT MY DOOR CLAWING

The 1260 has 3 phono/line inputs. I think (based on vaguely remembered

I'll spill all my guts to someone who I feel cares and understands.... and
being single isn't all that... and I have as much freedom in a
relationship as out of one... I just like being with someone I care about.
Life is too short (pardon my French) to have too many lonely winter nights
and rainy sundays.... it's nice to have someone to share those times
with... Because you know there is someone out there whose feeling the same
way.....  don't obesses and get all worked up.. but it's hard sometimes ya
know.... because I'm a dreamer and and a hopless romantic so it's a part
of me.. :) oh well...

Kinda rave related.

This is a topic that I'm VERY interested in.

I had an out of body experience at LOVE AFFAIR.... it was beautiful. But I
didn't give in to it and it lasted but of a moment. I want to do it again.
My mom has had multiple out of body experiences and both her and my
grandma see spirits and are comfortable with it. Sometimes (a lot of the
time) I feel presences.... and have been afraid to face this reality...
but now I'm getting comfortable with it and am ready to face them... like
they're wanting to contact me and communicate or something. I swear there
are spirits everywhere and definately within my apartment... and I feel
like if I wanted to I could see them and feel their presence even more.

I've heard of people who are able to leave their bodies and meet others on
plains of existences... I've also heard/know people who are into lucid
dreaming. This all really intreges me and I would love for you guys to
share your ideas, thoughts, experiences with me and others... if you just
wanna e-mail me privately that is coool. But I would definately appreciate
some feedback. Plus any books, videos, movies, etc.. web pages that tell
about reaching the other side....

I talked to my friend last night about spirituality and our existence...
and about how drugs and spirituality sometimes go hand in hand for people.
I talked about Future Sound of London and how deep they are and how I feel
they have a good understanding of things.. and in turn are a path for us 
to pass through some spiritual gate to a deeper understanding..... and he
said it was too spacey for him and that he doesn't think about spirituality o
r even feel it's a part of his life.... Hmm.... talk to me!...

I was just telling my phrend about how its always this time of year, around
october and november, when the seasons start to change, that it is nice to be
romantically entangled. You start to look at couples cuddleing in the park,
they look so happy. Its like x-tra hormone months or something, we need
someone to go into hybernation with us :o) yet you never know you mite bump
into that special person around that next corner...and remember as lonely as
nite may get,  your never alone :o)

lovies to you all,

P.S. be glad your not in Tahoe, its was 23 on my way to skool this mornin!!!

Byroni - Don't worry mate. You are one of THE most genuine, generous and
loving people I have ever met. I owe a lot to this guy. When I first came
to this country and knew no one, he was the first guy to come pick me up
from my house and take me to a rave. We've been friends ever since and
probably always will be.  I completely empathize with you about  wanting
to share stuff with that special someone but for someone of your caliber
it wont be long before someone can't help but fall in love with you! 
Y'know if I was a woman you'd be at the top of my list of suitors
 
Peace be with you
Edx

hello?  before this gets too far, can we back up a little here?

first, the day that you're supposed to bring a "date" to a party is the day
I stop going.

second, the thought that to choose that "date," you should ask imbecilic
meaningless superficial questions is horrifying.

it's bad enough this is even on tv (sorry, spencer, i know it's a way to
get seen in hollywood, and appreciate that you have to take that
opportunity)

but here on sfraves, can we maybe emulate something a little more, um,
evolved???

i dunno, a "dating game" where the contestants don't even know what
each other looks like, and get chosen on their ability to write,
sounds fairly pc.  progressive, even.  i think a computer-based
virtual dating contest would be an evolutionary step forward, not
backwards.  and while i think it's great that you don't have to bring
a date to a rave, or hook up while there, that doesn't mean it's wrong
to do so.

Yeah I know the type of kids that just stand there...or worse with a 
walkman and try to look cool...i guess they just want to watch and learn
or maybe they just think they can't dance...(like anyone cares how 
somebody dances!...I have seen some pretty bad dancing;) Anyway
people just have to loosen up and free themselves...I know there is 
nothing like dancing till the sun comes up...such freedom and clarity
is present in my mind...I'd have it no other way.

on that note...
a friend told me about this site: www.sfbaymatchmaker.com
and i'm embarrassed to admit this to a whole list of people!  BUT...  i
went there to check it out last friday... and i have to admit it was FUN!
you really don't have to participate, it was just fun reading about
different people- they have bios, essay questions to fill out, and some
people even have pictures to look at! the questionnaire is really good-
helps describe people very well in my opinion (age, location, music taste,
cat/dog person, likes/dislikes, etc...) and it's not just to find the love
of your life... you can use it just to meet people (opposite OR same sex)
that have similar tastes or that live near you!
i wouldn't recommend it to find the person of your dreams... i'm sure that
their are some (possibly many) weirdos visiting the site... i suggest caution,
but if you've got an hour or two to spare... check it out for fun!

do i sound like a spokes person or what???

at least this sort of site might give y'all some ideas to start out our own
little "raving ravers rendezvous" game!

Might I bold so bold as to ask "What is wrong with weirdos?"

Once a weirdo looked over Paris and said, "we need a tower that does
nothing but stand there"

Once another wierdo wrote a song about the first weirdo.  Sorry about the
Pixies reference...

Once a whole bunch of weirdos decided that we could do better than beer
busts, and threw a party in a warehouse and had their friends spin
records.  They spun music made by weirdos.  Weirdos showed up.  Soon, they
started to dress weird, the music got even weirder.  Soon, weird hell was
breaking loose.  Platform shoes, glitter, bass bins for 200 yards to
either side of the DJ, mixing in Led Zeppelin when people got to used to
house, jumping, bumping and grinding, taking *stuff*, sharing ideas,
touring the world, using glowsticks as landing beacons, UFOism, and being
nice and talking to strangers for a change. 

Then some other weirdos thought they could contact even more weirdos by
setting up a server so weirdos wouldn't keep making the same mistakes
with drugs, could find out about weirdo events, and even find out info on
how to make weird music.

Before this was the "next big thing", people thought it was pretty weird,
and I think that is a big part of it's beauty.  Keep it weird.

I just opened up my fortune cookie, and it says "You have a remarkable
power which you are not using" with happy faces to either side.

I think this is the fortune cookies way of saying I should quit my job and
become something I'm currently not...

Bye bye.
&EUU

It's like E.T. said.... be good.

alright... alright...
you know what i mean!
in the context in which you used the word weirdo- i too, would consider
myself one... and very proud of the fact!
HOWEVER- the weirdos that i was speaking of are those that you don't walk
too close to, let your children speak to, or trust with your phone #...
blah, blah, blah...
but your point is well taken!
it's people like you that give the term "weirdo" a good name!
i'd get weird with you anytime! and we'd have a blast doing so!!!

WHAT?!?!?

 Oh.. Sorry..
But what did you say again?? "You don't" have to bring a date or hook up at
a ravE?!?!? Like where have you been???  =]:..... ...  This reminds me of
the trip back to my car after the last Home Base ravE.. While walking back
to the car.. One of these ladies in a group of women out in the parking lot
yelled to me "don't come back untel you have a girlfriend"

You couldn't be further from the facts of the ravE scene... You have to
atleast hook up once at a ravE to gain over all respect.. Atleast if your
me....

Hey.. She made me do it!! I know it gets old.. But I like it.

=]:. .....

Well......i went out to that *weird* weekly club that goes by static
last night cuz some *weird* girl by the name of gabber girl was
playing and well.........things got *weird*.

All i can say is that gabbergirl ROCKED, u guys have got to hear this
girl play, she is SOO much fun to listen to and watch.  She had the
entire place literally freakin out.  I hear that she's only been
spinning for a year and a half and she kick's my ass.  i was never
really into gabber/hardcore until the FnF campout but it definitely is
growing on me (but please don't tell anyone).

STATIC is a super phat weekly that u kids should check out sometime.

=)

i agree in theory, except i've always felt bad (i.e., sympathized) with
the poor bastards who end up losing and looking like chumps in front of
the world... english speaking anyway (do they translate singled out)?
can't we all be winners?! 

aw, forget it. i'll just sit here an' watch.

just to clarify what my intention was .....

i have no judgments at all about dating services, answering personals,
whatever people want to do to widen the circle of people they meet...  as a
matter of fact, it was through a personals ad years ago that I was first
introduced into the world of underground raving ...

and i encourage people to visit those personals sites, call those phone
lines, whatever, if they're interested.... and if there are cool ravers
participating there, that's great (and cool non-ravers are great too).

my objection was to the specific suggestion that we use this list --
sfraves, which is a group of 450+ diverse people -- and create our own
imitation version of "singled out" which i consider to be an idiotic show
that makes a mockery of any sort of true interpersonal relationships.

we have in the past had a couple of stabs at "raving personals" ... and, as
far as these kinds of introductions go in encouraging face-to-face meetings
with your online pals, who just may become your real-life friends, i'm with
that.

But "singled out" is crap, promoting shallow values and treating people
like disposable herds of merchandise.  it's like a tv-version of a kegger
or something.  i wouldn't be surprised if they've had wet t-shirt contests
on it.

I'd be much more encouraged to hear us want to emulate "politically
incorrect" or another show that has some brainpower and courage behind it.

Do you get the feeling that there are a lot of single people
on this list hoping to meet new people, romantically inclined and
otherwise?  :)  Come on admit it.  I KNOW there are SO many lurkers out
there that keep their mouths sushed.  Anybody interested in throwing a
singles party?  

It's in the air,
George

look pal,

maybe YOU have to hook up at a rave to feel good about yourself. 
personally, i went to plenty of raves when i was married, with and
without my wife, and had a blast every time.  this summer i went to a
lot of raves, but my girlfriend wasn't into it, so i went with friends
instead.  and had a blast, every time.  now i love a nice sexy vibe at
a rave, and have no problem with hooking up at parties, but one of the
things i like about the rave scene is it's not the only reason people
are there.  people dance in their own space if they want to, talk to
friends, hug strangers they aren't neccesarily making moves on, talk
about interplanetary intellegence or whatever.  i think it makes a
nice change from, say, a friday night club scene where people have one
thing, and one thing only, on their minds.  i like being around people
who aren't one dimentional...

by the way, i got to say sometimes i think i detect a bit of a mean
streak in some of your posts, Jeff.  be careful, that sort of thing
tends to bounce back at you - i've never had any girl at a rave tell
me "don't come back till you got a girlfriend", or anything remotely
like that...

well i haven't seen many actual reviews of spiral tribe, so even though it
was way back at last weekend, i figured i'd give mine anyway.

i got there early, about 11, since i was already in the city and my gf 
dropped me off...  there were about ten people there at the time, most of
them were in spiral tribe :)  oh well, i had a full tummy and had to digest
some before i was gonna attempt dancing anyway.  after an hour or so, more
people started showing up...i had met these swiss kids earlier in the day
and tried to talk them into going, so i looked for them, but didn's see em.
i was surprised at how few people i knew there...there were a few other 
things going on that night, but it was interesting that there was this whole
party full of people i'd never seen before :)  i like seeing attractors
at work.  

now, about the music...  i heard some of the loudest pounding jungle i have
ever heard that night..it just felt like someone had turned something up
to 11 when it was only supposed to go to 10 :)  the bass lines would get
heavier and heavier and then start screeching and squealing...it tore me
apart!  i have to mention that i was so-so on jungle before this night, but
spiral tribe made me a believer!  the other nice thing is that they would
keep alternating between trance and jungle, short sets, only about 45 min
of each.  that really kept you on yer toes, although the crowd seemed to 
thin a little each time the jungle came back.  i wandered outside for a 
smoke a few times and met some of the spiral tribe folks, they were all
very friendly and had some great stories :)  so the cops showed up at about
3:30 and told everyone to leave, which most people did, although i hear
that back room kept a little flame going all morning.  

all in all i had an astounding night, met a lot of cool people, and 
danced me silly head off =D

cheers,
 datura

well it's a real slow day at work so i might as well put my 2 cents
in...  i've never had an out of body experience, but i've had some
experiences along similar lines...

my ex-wife and i did hallucinogenics together quite a few times, and
often we both felt like we had had some sort of telepathic contact
with each other.  someone at party was telling me there were fairly
legitimate scientists doing research on ketamine's ability to increase
ESP etc.  well one time we were doing ketamine with some people,
complete strangers, really.  we all took quite a bit.  and once again
melissa and i were, well, connecting.  anyway, the next morning (uh,
noonish anyway) as we all stumbled out of our rooms and started
talking about the night before, this one guy pipes up and says, "hey
it was the weirdest thing last night!  i was just sitting there
listening to you and your wife talking.  but then i realized, you
weren't actually speaking!".  the funny thing was, at least part of
the time, we were talking about him...

another experience along those lines - for weeks this winter i had
been getting this really strong feeling that i should call my
grandmother in florida, who i hadn't talked to too recently.  "what if
she died and i hadn't called her in a while when it happened?"  this
thought kept popping into my head over and over, so one friday night i
decided to go with the feeling and call her.  and while she was
answering the phone, she fell down and hit her head.  i didn't know
exactly what was going on, so i called the front desk of the
retirement home where she was staying.  they called an ambulance, but
said they thought she would probably be ok once she got to the
hospital.  i wasn't so sure, so i asked if i could talk to her while
they waited for the ambulance.  she wasn't completely coherant when
she got on the phone, but she was concious and seemed to understand
what i was saying, so i told her how much i loved her, and admired her
for bringing up my mom so well after grandfather died, and everything
else i could think of that i wanted to tell her.  then the ambulance
came.  after we hung up, i went out just walking through downtown
portland, feeling this really strong connection to her.  then suddenly
it was gone.  she died at the hospital that night.  at the funeral, a
friend of hers from the home told our family that she had recently
found out she had cancer again, and basically over the last few weeks
had made peace with the idea that it was time to let this world go...

um, i think i'm rambling at this point.  hope you guys don't think i'm
a complete flaked-out acid casualty or anything.  i'd love to hear
about any similar experiences people have had...

cool, count me in.  not only would it be cool to finally be in a good

breakbeat is a rythmic style, where "breaks" are sped up and looped
together. the old happy hardcore (ex: prodigy's experience album and the
like) falls under the broad category of breakbeat, as would today's drum
and bass/jungle. something like "breakbeat trance" is, as you would expect,
is trance with some breakbeat influence.=20

technically, breakbeat would usually be faster than trance since the tempo
is usually greater, but the music might feel slower because your ear might
be focusing on the half-speed bassline rather than the drum line..

as for the danceability of breakbeat, it varies depending on the person.
some people prefer 4 beat, some people prefer breakbeat...

Has anyone offered to give C.A. a proper induction into the SF
rave scene?  When you more e*perienced ravers take neophytes
out to their first rave, what do you do?  I guess what I'm wondering is,
what's the best way to introduce someone to their first rave?  Subjective
opinions appreciated.

Chris, you should come along with us to an underground party.  We will
make sure you dance nonstop and reach that higher plane.  While there you
can have a chat with yourself about impermanence, connect with other human
beings, and have a jolly old time.

Okay, so my story isn't as deep and meaningful as everyone else's, but it's
pretty intereseting nonetheless. . . :)

I had a dream about a friend of mine that lives in SF, and she got lost in
the city.  We searched everywhere for her, but coulnd't find her.  I walk
up to a car and guess who is sitting in the front seat?  Marilyn Manson.
He says hello and gives me body jewelry (they were nice niobium rings,
too... Marilyn has gooood taste)I ask him if he has seen my friend, but he
says that he hasn't . . . And then I wake up.
Here's the deal, though.  I was on Haight Street on saturday doing some
shopping and talking about this friend that I had the dream about.  Guess
who walks by as I am talking about her--  Yes....It was Marilyn Manson and
his peeps.  Does that qualify as a psychic encounter or does Dionne Warwick
still have have the one up on me???

Just a thought.

hello there again peoples,

Okay so I think i am sending this out to prevent anyone from having the
shitty afternoon I have had.  

Mainly this pertains to netadmins whoare using sendmail 8.8.X

If you or someone else hasn't updated your source binary or modified the
sendmail.cf file recently you might want to consider doing that.
please check out www.sendmail.org and check out the part of limiting 
your host as a relay host.

I know this is rave related and all that but getting 1000 emails an hour
and responding to lots of pissed off people isn't my idea of a fun
afternoon. 

just doing my bit of preventative maintenance for the net.

smile = )

yeah, it was cool, although the dj after gabber girl didn't really do
it for me.  usually static is like 4 or so dj's tag teaming, generally
they play this hard-ass dark techstep stuff.  i liked the hardcore
tho, it was fucked up and weird, but surprisingly pretty at times (in
an empty sort of a way).  although i think maybe it would be better
for sticking in your mercedes tape deck while cruisin' at 250km/hr
down the autobahn than for dancing.  wait, mecedes?  gabber is
hollendaise, right?  or hollandic, or something.  hollandese? 
netherlandish?  what the hell do the drive in holland, anyway, and
where (not the autobahn, i don't think).  i gotta find out, i just
discovered my roommate's got a gabber comp...

disco is from the 70's thats true.  (but so is the earliest house)   i
was just using a phrase that i say for the time when i and alot of people
i know first started going out.   this is when we first DISCOvered the
GLORY of being out at night, all night, getting high and listening to
house music with other people who were discovering it too.    The
dub-house-disco sound was bigger then too it seemed. Hits like two fat
guitars and rockers to rockers are songs that always bring me back to
that time.

but why would people in SF care about what people in NY, England and

the most mature things my mother ever said to me was "if all your friends
are going to jump of a bridge are you going to do that too?"

i don't understand your logic.   if you are shaking your ass to the beat
and it is going 180 beats per minute you shake your ass 60 times more
than someone dancing to a 120 bpm house track.    that is one third more
energy to expend.   if i am not high on speed or acid it becomes hard for
me to keep up after a couple of hours.   when i am dancing to house i can
drink a couple of beers smoke some herb and groove and still be able to
keep up with the music.

when i go out to a trance party (beilieve it or not i have been to a few)
  almost everyone is dosed.  it is hard to not be high and still
participate when the music is that fast.  

but if i am out at wicked or come-unity or stompy i could chill and dance
and not have to wait a couple days to come down so that i can participate
in the "real world" again.

i was not trying to say that if you are under 21 you are on speed, but
the older you get the harder it becomes to go out and do speed or take
dose every weekend.

i am not saying we are behind the times at all.   I am saying that we
here in SF don't need the rest of the world to tell us what to listen to.
 Underground music in many cases is becoming mainstream.    electronica
is just another word for pop music.  it is the alternative rock of the
late 90's.  mixmag is a commercial magazine.   Sure there is radio house
music.  but you don't hear that stuff when you go to a good club.   

besides we are not listening to the same old songs over and over like a
retro rock station.    house music has been evolving for almost 20 years
now.   people are making all kinds of crazy styles of house music.   we
just like the whole "easy to dance to 120 bpm" tempo.   my reason #5 was
just trying to say that certain people who dj around here have had the
experience of  hearing the power of house music in an environment where
it really took off and are trying to share it with us in the bay area.  i
was just trying to relate the history and culture of house as an art
form.   i mean why stop playing jazz just because grunge rock comes
along.  you don't just drop one art form because another comes along that
is making more money for some music executive.   

as far as trying something new.   there are ample opportunities all the
time to hear other music than house.   SF is very diverse musically.  
people aren't afraid of playing trance or techno or jungle.   there are
all kinds of parties here.    But there is a large group that are really
into the house vibe, for many of the reasons i pointed out earlier. if
more people really preferred techno, trance, and jungle over house music
they would play less house music.

Turn up your CD player.  That Chemical Brothers CD you hear? That's
probably breakbeat.  Firestarter by Prodigy, that's breakbeat.

Not the Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom...

but the Boom ka! BoomBoom ka! Boom ka! BoomBoom ka! Boom...

Thank you,
Andy

p.s. Breakbeat should be a little slower or the same speed as trance, but
music with breakbeat riddims go all the way up to jungle and british
hardcore...  and that's fast stuff... woohaaa... extra spicy... most
really slow stuff (like rap, lotsa that trip hop chemical stuff) has what
would be considered a breakbeat beat, but we don't usually call it that.
So does a lot of surf music too... in fact, it might all be breakbeat if I
sit and think about it long enough...

p.p.s.	Can be fun to dance to, assuming your shopping cart doesn't get in
the way (inside joke to myself, last time I heard the Chem Bros I was
shopping really late, and the stockpeople were buggin out to it).

I'd have to vote NO as well.  How about figuring out some secret
SFRaves way of indicating to people that you're single?  Keep it subtle,
and that way you know who you can go up and talk to without getting
pummeled.  Maybe wearing a certain color fuzzy pants or something... or
asking, hey, are you, ya know... single.  Anything except a big bunch of
chains and gold medallions (I think I just upset the retro crowd).

Love... and I do mean LUUUUVVVV,

it really depends on the party...you can't really do anything about it if a
person gives raving a try for their first time and it's a bad vibe or what
not...i suppose sharing some smokable substance with them helps--although
most of my non-raving friends are straightedge...encourage them to meet new
people, let them wander around on their own and see what it's all about, if
they're self-conscious about dancing don't chide them for not doing so...if
you think they'll be o.k. with it, give them an ExpEriEncE; for better or
for worse, _that's_ what converted me.

and don't forget that some people are just never gonna be into it...it's
like any type of entertainment, you either groove on it or you don't...

Hello friends, and future friends,  this is Eric from Dublin, Pablo's
friend.  Anyway I am sitting here in my room listening to Goa Gil, and
remembering how much the Goa scene was and still is to me.  It is far and
beyond anything I can explain on the spiritual side.  The Goa scene is soo
Spiritual I feel like a calling to become another enegery presence in it. 
So if any of out there know of any Goa Parites comming up, please respond
to me Privatly.  Thank You
Eric

Is this really about having a part episode of Singled Out?  I regret to 
inform you that this is a spurious argument as Singled Out has been 
cancelled.  I don't think it's such a heinous idea, though.  You could 
change the questions to something like:  rising sign, aura, beats per 
minute, music style, etc.  Then you could move on to tight ass or perky 
**** for the second round.  It could be a marriage of the carnal and the 
spiritual.  

Well, maybe you're right, Leslie.

hello?  before this gets too far, can we back up a little here?

first, the day that you're supposed to bring a "date" to a party is the day
I stop going.

second, the thought that to choose that "date," you should ask imbecilic
meaningless superficial questions is horrifying.

it's bad enough this is even on tv (sorry, spencer, i know it's a way to
get seen in hollywood, and appreciate that you have to take that
opportunity)

but here on sfraves, can we maybe emulate something a little more, um,
evolved???

So... what do you know about these kids except they're a little vain and 
shy?  Are they nice?  Are they asswipes?  What?  Or did you just decide 
if they don't know the litany they should get out of the church?

Actually i was thinking of leaving it up to the person to decide
what they wanted to ask. Because each of us is truly unique
we all have unique desires and needs so its best left up 
to the individual to decide what is important to them.

If you want to ask something superficial like where do you work
or what kind of car do you drive then ask away. If something
else is more important then ask about that.

I have another fortune for you... I sense that someday you will look
down upon your children and say: "Son/Daughter, where did you learn to

Winter is the time of solstice but it is also the time for Rebirth(not
the Mac version).  Winter is about change and gives people a chance to
look inwards and possible change that which needs changing.  Remember
that what we feel on the inside is what we project to other on the
outside.  Its kinda a double-edged sword, in some ways it can drive away
that which we desire but on the other hand it can also attract what we
may not need(in the long run).  So enjoy your freedom and look towars
the positive things like(even though its hard as Hell to think of
anything else).

Yeah drugs are cool but they are also inhibited with those same spirits
that you see floating about.  Remember that its a good idea to ground
yourself when attempting to "connect" with these "spirits".
	I usually ask for, "guidence, porotection and grace"  when I feel as
though there might be a presence about.   Fate

Actually its all spionning of into new and different tangents of music. 
When I was in Germany(93-95)  Techno in germany was 180-200 Bpm, muck
different than British Techno which was more like 130-150 Bpm.  So many
styles these days its hard to keep up with whats Trance and whats
Ambient.  One thing is for sure, Happy Hardcore is one style that is
very pronounced and is easy to tell from the rest.

Anyone know if they've released it?  BTW, if you want to go to the Spiral

Me agree
If you dont ground you can be grounded in an unpleasent way.
Ive seen people standing and then all of a sudden ....splat
grounded...just laying there on the ground...definately grounded.

Like the indians story of tobacco. It is sacred and if you abuse
it it will kill you.

ahem

:D

Back in the day, techno music was dominated by the now ever-so-familiar 
quarter-note "4-on-the-floor" drum beat (boom boom boom boom).  One day, 
some guy was listening to a salsa or marengue rekkid and thought, "Hey, 
if I replace every either measure of this boring-ass drum beat with this 
fresh salsa beat, it will really break up the monotany of this music!" 
and thus "the Breakbeat" was born.

A little while later, some folks thought, "Hey, why not use those groove 
Afro-Cuban and Latin beats to drive the entire track!" and the subgenre 
was named "Breakbeat"

More or less that's how it happened.

Also, this style of beat programming became popular with the rap crowd in 
the early 80's and became a mainstay of breakdancers.  Thusly, breakbeat 
music and breakdancing go hand-in-hand.


"You know if it wasn't for Grandmaster Flash inventing scratching and 
bringing the records back to catch just the break to um elongate it then 
you woulda never had b-boys 'cuz there woulda never been a break."

More or less that's how it happened


Breakbeat ranges in tempo from really slow downtempo stuff (like 60bpm) 
up to as fast as you can get it (Breakcore for example).  In general, you 
find breakbeat at around 100-120 bpm.  I pitch up most of my breaks, as I 
like to hear them somewhere between the 125-135bpm range.  

Personally, I find breakbeat to be the most 'danceable' of all techno 
music.  Where trance or house seem to get into my head and get me on a 
mind trip, breakbeat goes straight to the old booty and gets me movin'.

I think they did this when I was in high school, back in like 
1988-1992... I think the called it "A Dance" and folks would "ask people 
out" and go to "The Dance" and sometimes dance and sometimes not and then 
they'd go back to their parents' house and try to have sex.

Anyone else experience this phenomenon?

:D

with love, laughs and PLUR

who was runner up for Orange High School Prom King 1992 (seriously!)
(that whole prom story is actually pretty funny... ask me to tell it in 
person some time... :D)

Oh, PS, I'd drive to Davis!  Davis rocks!  I miss Davis!!!

sounds good, but i won't be there...

i'm socially inept as it is (esp. w/ females) so i don't want to goto a party
and have to feel that i have to get some #'s.  plus, with e and schtuff
floating around, things may get outta hand if people let the "it's single
night so it's all good" mentality get to them.  it's the music that should be
the theme to any rave, not a marital status IMHO.  well that's my two
pennies. =)

Another khakamaymee idea of mine.  Foolish fish posted a while back ago
about trying to bring the rave community together to help solve problems.
This is along those lines. 

Picture one of these scenarios;  You are at a massive, you feel 
lost, you're friends are missing, you feel a bad trip coming on, you're
dehydrated...whatever.  Hey what's that over there?  Candles, beanbags,
incense burning, a sign that says please come in.  It's the SFR karma zone
where you can find solace, infosheets, hugs, fruit, promotional stuff for 
local djs, good vibes, etc.  We are there helping others and promoting
healthy raving and healthy lifestyles.  It's a win-win situation!  I know
I've had a lot of cracked out ideas, but I think this one is really good.

What do the promoters on the list think of this idea?  Is it something
worth pursuing, something you would support at your ug/massive?  I'm not
really in the promotion loop so any insights would be great.

*GEOrGEOrGEOrGE.... and so on...

Let's see what tommorrow brings. Nothing new, now wait a minute! You've
got a
needle with nothing in it . Go fill it up and poke your arm I'm sure it
cant
do any harm. So what if it desroys your vein, it's already destroyed
your
brain. Become addicted? No way! No how! Sorry pal it's too late now.
You've
taken it a step too far got off your feet and in your car. Drove all the
way
to nowheresville. Just to snort a line or pop a pill. What'll it be just
one
more fix? Just one more time to get your kicks? Just one more needle to
be
shared, just one less life to be spared. Stay awake, just five more
days.
Wait, you'll see, it really pays! Pays for what your life I guess. Does
it
relieve or cause more stress? There is nothing wrong with getting high I
love it lots I can not lie. But everyday at what extent? Weekends
come-your
money's spent. No food, no sleep, no energy, can't you enjoy your
ectasy?
Can't move, can't dance, you feel like shit! Don't you ever get sick of
it?
Smoke the budda all week long, keep other drugs where they belong. When
it's
party time, let it loose. Swallow, snort,or smoke the juice. It's not
easy, I
understand,and I don't like to reprimand. But you have to realize what
you're
doing. It's not only yourselfs your screwing.Those of us that stand up
tall
don't like to sit and watch you fall. But we can't tell you what to do,
it's
your life, it's up to you! So,if you choose to waste away, and get
cracked up
every single day-then so be it! My hands are tied! But I will never lose
my
pride. Enjoy yourselves, it's good I'M sure. I just hope your soul stays
pure. Don't damage it with wasted time, please accept the meaning of
this
rhyme. We can benfit from the drugs we use, just think about it and
don't
abuse.

Hello... this is a completely opinion-free letter so as to avoid flames.

        I just heard on the radio that Coolworld is suing The county of
Alameda for their loss over Cyberfest.  They're asking for $4.5 million I do
believe (Don't quote me on it or anything) to cover the losses and all future
damage that was done to their reputation.  UP for discussion...I'm off to

(what's going on? i just don't seem to be able to get this message thru to
sfraves. if anybody got this 3 times, i apologize.)

hello all you lovely sfravers

i see you're all still around. hi byroni, dErEk, liz, foolish fish, beth...
who else's name did i see amongst the 1600 messages that i just downloaded
after 4 weeks of involuntary abstinence. i tried unsubscribing twice. don't
know why it didn't work but at least i'm not missing anything :)
rubilicious, you still around? anybody seen julie hayes (*fairy princess*)?
could someone please ask her to email us? hi doughboy, hi ari, hi jelo...
ed leech, where are you? please come back to england. we need someone to
hang out with. people are horrid here. they don't understand. they haven't
been touched by the californian philosophy of life...;)

well, we live in manchester, uk, now and finally got the phone connected.
it's a cool city although we'd rather be in san francisco :) ppl are so
much nicer there. we miss you all so much. coming back to england was such
a come-down. i hope this is not going to deter you from coming to visit us.
we'll do our best to find some entertainment for you groovers.

btw: to all those who constantly winge that the underground is going
mainstream and techno is gonna die and stuff like that i can only say that
it's just damn hard to find, especially in a new place...but we're getting
closer. found some wonderful fast and hard trance and spacey techno last
week. after 2 months w/o raving we were so ripe for it. but there's just so
much meat-market handbag house clubs around it's disgusting. oh and this
disco revival sends us running as far as we can every time. someone was
telling us about a place that stays open until 9 in the morning (clubs shut
around 2). his words were: 'no idea what they do that long'. and that the
police is trying to shut it down. yeah, that's what we're looking for, we
said. didn't even have to ask what kind of music they're playing.

well, that's all for now. have a wicked halloween.

Wow! Now talk about memories. I saw Jeno at a Ghostribe
party a few months ago and he spun one of his "old
school" break sets. He tore it up. It was the best
sets I've heard from him in years. Too bad he doesn't
incorporate that into more of his sets these days.

Hi you kids!!!!!

Eric and I miss you two.  We are diligently saving our pennies to go to
England soon.  We can't wait to go!  I'm so happy to here you are doing
well in Manchester.  Is your new address on the list of ones you gave me? 
Eric and I are planning to go to the glastunbury (spell????) festival in
the beginning of our trip (no pun intended).  Do you know the *exact* date,
so we can start planning better.  I talk to ed every so often, I think he
is going to stay here forever, I know for sure he is going to glastunbury,
though.  I can't wait until we can all hang out again.  Eric and I are
well, and we think of you two often.  Write me, when you have a moment, and
let me know how things are going.

 Peace and Love,
Julie

Hi george and others who may be fairly new on this list....

we have the makings of a group called Karma Patrol, which is pretty much
what you describe.... Karma Patrol has done several parties ... but then
when things started slowing down a few months ago (due to lack of sites,
lack of energy, etc.) we haven't done much formally...  (though, in one
sense, we're all on Karma Patrol all the time)

We had a crew who were committed to sobriety at any party where they
worked, we had a "safe spot" corner that was only available for people who
Karma Patrol though should be there to be looked after... we walked the
party, checked on people, spread smiles and good thoughts, and in the
process, found people who might need a little attention..

if you think this is a great idea, then you should be part of it... foolish
fish has been karma patrol, and many of the people on this list (and not on
this list) have chosen to do it...

one of the limitations is that every party needs a committed organizer of
it, who can "recruit" and "manage" the team of people who want to
participate ... and make sure that the safe spot is a workable one ....

Some parties, like Harmony, have always had either a formal or informal
karma patrol.... i encourage each of you to talk to the promoters of
parties you're involved in to try to get a Karma Patrol presence...

love, Leslie

like it if there was a place at places that i go where i could know that
people i know would also go. people could use a place like this one that
is a great idea as a place to share things and ideas and other things. i
think it is hard to make a great idea like this great idea happen
without great effort and determination and planning and other things.
but it is still a great idea and i could help sometimes because i like
it.  

the end

excuse me, but i can't seem to find anywhere in my post about thinking
anybody should leave a rave due to a lack of "litany"...you really ought
to try reading the posts before you start flaming...Everbody has a right

Yeah, "Love comes quickly, whatever you do you can't stop falling..".. one
of my favorite songs... definately my favorite Pet Shop Boys song...
yeah, I'm not worrying about it. If it was meant to be it will happen.

All I know is that I haven't been remembering my dreams lately. Maybe
because I day dream so much that my dream juices are all drained out...
haha. Just kidding.

I hope we all find that special someone. But an intersting point was
brought to my attention. Our collective consciousness works in a way that
doesn't allow us to meet people that we can really CONNECT to very often.
Something about the rhythim of our lives and the energy in the universe.

I think this would be a really good idea. In fact, we could even have it
at my house! Haha. All us super cool singles could come to my house and
have a get together...  it would be fun. But it could also be awkward. How
about if some of you single people see someone who is also single on the
list..... you could e-mail them.... ?? :) 

We need to have another get together. A BBQ. Wher we can meet the man
behind the curtain for those fo us who haven't had the chance. I would
love to meet you Brian.... thanks for the service. It changes the entire
rave experience for us. Because we don't have to really leave people
behind when we leave a party... we can always talk and interact with
eachother between parties on here. It's priceless!

If you're not interested you don't have to go.... just like I don't eat
meat.. but that's my preferences and I don't have to eat dead animal
carnage if I don't want to. But that doesn't mean others can't.

Thanks for sharing that. That's so touching.

As for communication without talking. It happens to me all the time when
I'm tripping. I feel myself flowing in and out of other people's energy
and consciousness. We have convesations and express feelings, ideas,
witout even talking. Then we realize it and laugh and say something like,
"Oh my God.... Trippy". Derek Fieldsoe and I did this the night of Big Top
at Mc Donalds.... we were in a comic strip dressed up as Droogs and we
were communicating. It's so much fun. It happens when you don't think abou
tit and just *exist* without any really deep thought or concentration.
Where your spirit has more attention than your limited universe called
life on Earth.

I come to understandings and learn things about people just from day to
day life. I know I have ESP and have inherited a 6th sense from my mom's
side of the family. But when I'm *DiVERgEnt* I am even more in touch with
this. It's nice. I can read people pretty well and thank myself for this
ability. It saves me a lot of time getting to know people that end up
being worthless, cold, people who have no benefit to mankind and care
little about others...

I'm so glad we brought this up. Because we are all aware of this second
existence that we've been open to. But no one talks about it!... or if
they do it's only to close friends. Which is understandable. At first I
was hesitent to say anything (Wait.. Byroni hesitent to babble and talk
about things, regardless of anything...??) but these feelings and the
importance of these experiences are becoming more and more important to
me. So I want to share them with you and hear your ideas. At a rave I
always feel much more comfortable... because I feel like more people are
on the same level....    

Also.. my cat has to know what's going on... He always knows things. Like
when I'm about go come home, when I'm going to wake up in the morning,
when I'm sad, lonely, etc. It's nice. I love watching my at when I'm
divergent.... examing his sleekness, his dexerity, charisma... he's so
cozmic looking... furry, BEAUTIFUL eyes, nice fur... totally open to any
affection.. weather it's another cat (male or female), a cubbord door, my
foot, himself, etc. They are definately in touch with themselves. :) But
at the same time I wonder... their intelligence isn't as great as ours in
OUR EYES, but maybe that's because they're living on a different path...
but are just as socially aware and spiritually adept.???

FSOL is the best group to get DEEEEEP with. I don't know if any of you
guys remember this.. but there was a time about 8 or so months ago where I
was at work (after Captain Crunch got busted) with some friends I MET THAT
NIGHT... and I was to say the least... tripped out. I was hoping that I
could listen to something while the others and I chatted and got deep. So
I remembered that I had ISDN!... nice.....   FSOL has helped bring to me
placed I never imagined. This stuff is engineered for trippers..... Jack
Tripper... :)

"I killed a man.. a man who looked like me"..

now here's where the irony of this whole "singles" thing really gets to me...

you want to have a "singles" party (yeah, as if 80% of the rave community
is single anyway??) ....

but i guess you'll just have to have a separate event if you want to meet
Brian, because Brian is married to Laura, who's also a cool person ... but
of course, they can't come to the "super-cool singles" event, because
they're under the category of "super-cool married people"....

see the problem here, folks?  the reason having a "singles-only" event
feels awkward is because it's basically contrived and unnatural...

How about just keep on keeping on having small non-dance oriented
get-togethers where all the sfravers are invited, and the ones who have the
time, interest, etc. will come together ....  have that dinner, byroni, but
invite all the people who'd like to come together and meet each other...

and who knows, maybe once you meet the married Brian, he'll introduce you
to someone who's single and will turn out the be the love of your life...

funny how life works that way...

love, leslie

I think a party is a good idea.  Why do you automatically equate a singles
party
with swingers?  As a non-swinging single - I take offense to that...  and as
the
single people here know, someone special is not just going to show up on your
doorstep.  

So when's the partay?!  :)

Hi byroni-

Bad analogy. A lot of vegans don't like going to a macdonalds b/c the
smell makes them sick. Imagine, then having a monthly veganism meeting
in a macdonalds...some would think it was ok and go, others would
freak out b/c their theories on eating are so totally opposed to what
the fast food chain is all about. Some might say let's just call that
meeting off.

Ultimately, you're right. I don't have to go, and I won't go. 

Probably one of the top things I always liked about raves, from the
very first one I went to was the total freedom from conventional
social interaction. Whether I danced with my friends, or by myself, or
with a girl or with a guy..it just didn't matter. 

Sure, I've met plenty of cool girls at parties, gotten together with
one or two..but even so, there was somthing magical in the spontanaity.

So I'm sorry if you think it strange that I consider raves above a
some sort of formal or planned dating ritual, but I know there's lots
of others out there who feel the same way as I do. This scene is what
you make of it, and of course there's room for all our opinions, but I
guess there's some new ideas that I'll never get used to.

-take care-

alex

Heeey kiddos.... This is maya, writing to all you wonderful people from my 
roommates computer, feeling VERY DISconnected from the internet, and all of 
the new buddies I made last Friday night.  I haven't read any posts lately, so 
I don't know what you guys are talking about.  I just wanted to say I loved 
having you all over at my house on Friday night, you were all wonderful house 
guests, and I had a lot of fun...  I hope you did too and I am thinking, that 
I would like to do that again... maybe like once a month, or something would 
be fun... I am getting all new roommates as of Nov 15, and maybe they will be 
a little cooler about all this.    I am in the process of signing up with a 
new ISP...  coming soon to a message board near you will be my new address.  : 
)
To all you lovely people, Scott, Josh, Elaine, Seamus, Sol, Harry, George, and 
everybody else that came, thank you all, I look forward to the next gathering 
with the pb & honey and the BROWNIES!!!!! (that WEREN'T greenies...: )), and I 
hope that to those of you that didn't make it, you are able to next time.  If 
anyone wants to get in touch with me, 565.0740, is my #-  someone left a dish 
here...???  Any takers?  Oh- yeah, whats happening with the zine?  Hows it 
going???  
My roommate is rarely home, and when he is he is always on line- I don't have 
much opportunity to check his email, so I probably can't receive messages 
here.  I WILL be online again this week- I promise-  I am going thru 
withdrawls... twitch...twitch...twitch... as my hand reaches for that mouse on 
my desk...  ;  )
Need to check my email!!!!

Anyways, I will talk to yous soon...
~~Passin'  the Lovin'~

Ok Ok.. just a little humor to lighten this awful day.. =D

The Perfect Story
=================

There was a perfect man who met a perfect woman.  After a perfect courtship, 
they had a perfect wedding.  Their life together was, of course, perfect. 

One snowy, stormy christmas eve this perfect couple was driving along a 
winding road when they notice someone at the roadside in distress.  Being the 
perfect couple, they stopped to help.

There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys.  Not wanting to disappoint
any children on the eve of christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his 
toys into their vehicle.  Soon they were driving along delivering the toys.  
Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and 
Santa Claus had an accident

Only one of them survived the accident.  Who was the survivor?
(scroll down for the answer)

















The perfect woman.  Everyone know there is no Santa claus and no such thing as
a perfect man.   

**A males response:  So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the 
perfect woman must have been driving.... explains why there was a car 
accident.....

Hello, hello...

I'm writing to let you know of a shame and see if you can do anything about
it.  The girl in Phoenix who'd booked Stakka (Audio Blueprint/Under
Fire/Ram Records- Brighton, UK) & Skynet (Audio Blueprint/Under Fire
Recordings- Brighton, UK) for Halloween has backed out.  Fucked.  So, now
they're here for the next week and a half, and they're NOT booked
Halloween.  Anyone interested?  Get back to me here.

Hope you can help, fellow junglists...

Peace

I totally agree. It's getting ridiculous. They go back as far as the
beginning of August too. I think I'm going to have to add a filter for FTT
and use the calendar to see if they have anything going on b/c there's no
sign of it ending.

Hmmm. I don't know if I agree w/ that. By that definition, I guess
Tack>>Head, Gary Clail, Keith Leblanc (DJ SPike), Fats Comet, Mark
Stewart and that whole "industrial/big beats" crowd that accreted
around Adrian Sherwood's production values are "breakbeat" too. But we
all know that's not quite right. What I do know is that these "big
beat" sounds  (which began around 1986) have not been given proper
respect for being one of the progenitors of the techno/rave/house/dub
movement of today.

I've heard this style of music, as well as some of the Chemical
Brothers stuff described as "big beat" w/ a tip of the hat to the
big-beat masters of yore. (actually, i'd rather listen to Tackhead or
Keith LeBlanc). I don't know where the Prodigy fits into this, other
then the fact that I don't like anything the Prodigy did after their
first releases way back in the day.

For more on "big beat" (not breakbeat), check the "The Power Inc --
vols 1, 2, 3" compilations from Alfa in Japan (anybody got copies i can
borrow?? I have some of the original releases, but it would be nice to
have them all on a few CDs).

PS: for breakbeat, an easy to find CD compilation is DJ John Kelley
"Funky Desert Breaks" on Moonshine. It's ok, but it's nothing to phone
ET about.

yikes!
whats this all about?

well in my little own interpretation, okay, rave... do your own thing ie
"do" not "not do" and standing around brushing your pretty hair and not
dancing or smiling just criticising all night would fall under the
category of "not do"

if you arent going to do anything to contribute, dont take up space?!?!?!

DO your own thing, yes :) but if "not doing anything" is "your own thing"
go sit on the haight all night and do your own thing

there is no law (or even an unwritten rule) against being a member of the
audience rather than a performer...it's sometimes preferable...

like when everything is just SO pretty and SO real and INTENSE that you
can't even move, and just kind of sit there watching everything happen...

gotta understand this--a rave is a place where anybody can go and be
themselves while listening to the big bass thump.  and if being themselves
is standing around and "being cool" well then that's the way it goes and
there's nothing wrong with that.

I agree with you on the first one but John came out
with another one about two months ago "Funky Desert
Breaks II" that E.T. recommends highly.  8)

hey all you glowing blinking led kidz out there, i have a question. 
where can i find some of those multicolored glowstring tubes - not the
standard-issue glowsticks, mind you, but the rainbow hued
string-things that you can wear as a neckace.  or a bracelet.  or a
halo.  and while were at it, if anyone wants to share sources for
glowing blinking things, feel free.  i'll start the ball rolling with
one suggestion - radio shack.  they don't have glowsticks, but i've
seen some pretty interesting and unique blink-gear there.  and they
have "psycho lights", which you can't wear at a rave, but will turn
your bedroom into one, for like $12 - HIGHly recomended...

They will send you a free catalog with lots of bright raver-friendly toys.
Very cheap might I add.

this IS a very touchy subject.. in some sense i think they have a right 
to do that, but in another sense, it just adds to the useless " i'm

Please state your point. If you want to lecture me on my bahavior. I suggest "pal"
that you do it off the list before I tear you a new assmunch.

: maybe YOU have to hook up at a rave to feel good about yourself.
You could not be further from the facts. This line is so ass backwards to how things
REALLY are...You - Don't - EVEN - know.
For about four months I had a wonderfull time at the ravEs "being myself" and then
it all happened.  People calling me stuck-up, an asshole, a fag... Does the word
NEWBIE mean anything to you? The fact of the matter is.....Seems like...no body ELSE
can have a good time...when - I - don't hook up at the ravE.

: personally, i went to plenty of raves when i was married, with and
: without my wife, and had a blast every time.
 Thats you "pal" Mr UN-NOTICED in the scene.. I was talking about ME, not you...

: people dance in their own space if they want to
You don't even know...

: i think it makes a nice change from, say, a friday night club scene
: where people have one thing, and one thing only, on their minds.
Dancing and being able to enjoy a trUCKING beer? Because they sell legal drugs at
clubs.

: i like being around people who aren't one dimentional...
Your even worse than a person that talks shit about people he don't even know.

: by the way, i got to say sometimes i think i detect a bit of a mean
: streak in some of your posts, Jeff.  be careful, that sort of thing
: tends to bounce back at you.
Blah blah blah.. Ok.. For now on.. I will """ACT""" like YOU! Fuck being myself huh.
I need to be politically correct. Maybe I will even start spelling everything right.
And cut my hair to....

: i've never had any girl at a rave tell me "don't come back till you
: got a girlfriend", or anything remotely like that...
And I bet you...You have never had a lesbian come up to you at a ravE and tell you
that "your the only GUY she would have sex with" either.. Guess what???? I bet you
never will!!!

Joy...
Happy thoughts.. Think happy thoughts Jeff.. I just hate too gooderz..


Anyways.. I thought I would entertain your post. Because your so clueless as to how
I think and feel...
Jeff
The way you got me talking here.. It probably sounds like I blame everyone else for
reasons unknown. But it's all my fault.. I should have pulled the mac at everyone
one of thoughs ravEs.. I am sorry..

Good breakbeat is really fun to dance to..
I don't know though.. It's like house with a couple steps missing to me.
When I "try" to make some breakbeat beats on my computer. It seems easier
to make it 30steps apposed to 32steps in a loop. But I defonetly don't know
the technical terms to it. I just play it by ear....


Gotta go though..
Damn. Late for work again.. What a slacker w/ a bad attitude I have
become..

Oh.

Well, it initially sounds like it would be a good idea.  From a promotional
perspective, I feel that it is the responsibility of promoters to provide such
attractions for the ravers, if there is a reflected desire for it.   Many
events do not have chill rooms, and could benefit from this type of 'tent'.
But at events that do have a produced chill area... having a second chill out
spot produced by an external entity/organization may actually imply a
'clickyness' and could backfire on the entire concept of itself.  The last
thing we need is any associated segregation.  of course I understand that that
may not at all be the case, and that this is only a reflection of diversity of
our community, but many people may see it as a 'click' and not come over to
the 'tent' because its not their scene.  These are issues that would have to
be addressed.

An alternative to this idea would be an SFR Promotional table, to spread the
word about SFR and try to inform NEW people about this online community.
Incorporate into this table a few bean bags, and a rotation of people on the
list to always be at the table, and one main organizer, and you may have what
you are looking for.  And that would be accepted at any event, and could be
setup inside the chill room, or with the vendors.  This way it does not imply
any form of grouping, but more of an outreach and informative purpose.

Personally, I think that ANY group/member effort made by SFR compromises its
purpose., not extends it..  This list serves as a medium of discussion, were
anyone can discuss anything about raving that they want.   To organize events
and produce attractions... I feel takes away from the very foundation, and
nature of the purpose of this list.   If this list is open for anyone, at
anytime... then a group/member produced activity is a contradiction of its own
agenda, and may seem to some people a bit hypocritical.  Maybe Im just
reaching to far, or getting a bit analytical here, but its just my take on the

My friend says she has these little pills that make everything
look like rainbows. I suppose that would make a standard issue
glowstick look like a rainbow too.

also try the oriental trading company.
They have a web site at www.oriental.com 
or you can get a free catalog at 1-800-228-2269.
they used to give a free sample glowstick,but that 
has been a while.

       Actually CWP is standing up for everyone in the entire dance
community by filing this suite.  Don't get distracted by the $4.5 mill, its
just a statement.   If there will be any settlement it will be a small
percentage of the initial complaint... that's the way our fucked up system
works.  You have to ask for 100 times more than what you want in order to
get what you expect.      But all that aside....  CWP is making a stand on
behalf of the entire community.... They are saying that youth culture should
not be discriminated against, and they are trying to set a president to make
sure something like this NEVER happens again to ANY promoter.  Not just in
this area, but anywhere in this country.  Don't forget, it was CWP that
opened up the city of Oakland for permits after they fought long and hard
for 2 years with the city council to allow after-hours event to happen in
Oakland... And Now they are still leading the fight to eliminate
discrimination and unfair treatment of OUR Youth Culture.
    So before anyone starts to put them down, just remember that they are
not just doing this to recoup a $300,000 loss, but to make a point that We
are not to be Fucked around with, cause We fight back, and are Not
pushovers.  This is the main issue in this suite... not the Money...
remember money is just a tool... it has no REAL intrinsic value, and is not
the end product.  Unless your a drug dealer, lawyer, politician, or a used
car salesman.

Keep It Real

Looks like another generation of DJ CD decks is going to be hitting the
market one of these days.

See ... http://www.cddj.com/pioneer/prodj.htm for a picture ...

Also, a web search turned up
http://www.glenn-miller.com/wwwboard/forum1/messages/410.html , which
says:

--------------------

Posted by Todd Barber on September 10, 1997 at 00:40:18:

I spoke with a rep from Pioneer yesterday regarding the CDJ-700. If any
of you are thinking about getting one of these here is the info I
recieved.

There are five new features in the 700 over the 500II's. First there is
the anti-skip mech. which is the same technology used in Pioneers car
stereo line. The rep told me that they gave a demo of the unit at a
convention in Alantic city where they turned the cd player upside dow
and shook it and it did not skip. Next there is a loop tuning feature
where you can set the loop points and on the fly adjust the length of
the loop making it longer or shorter. Third the pitch adjustment has
been bumped up from +/- 10% to +/- 16%. Fouth is the size which is less
than half the size. Finally the jog wheel represnts the same number of
frames from o to 360 degrees as a turntable does.

There is a system that is offered called the 700S, which includes 2
CDJ-700's, the DJM-300, and a custom case. Pioneer is working on a case
design for two CDJ-700's and one DJM-500.

The 300 mixer features -26db on the eq section and a feature that
allows you to hear both input in your headphones where one side of the
headphones is one source and the other is the other source when used
with Pioneers new headphones. There are some big disadvantages of the
300 series mixer though, inputs and effects.

Also the 700's should be shipping to stores in a couple of weeks.

Ahh, idealism. I can see the gleam in your eye. This will change as you

They have their mind on their money and money on their mind. You can believe
it is about something idealistic like rights but then you'll just be praying
to a false prophet.

 This is (IMO of course) perhaps the most honest and humble approach to what 
many call spiritual in our lives. Thank you.

I can't find it to Re: to, but I saw a thread harshing youngin's up against
the wall tossing hair... somthing about walkmans?  and how this was wrong..
or not good.. or something...

I wanted to throw in my two cents.. not exactly as a rebuttal or anything,
but as a simple statement.

It's all about dancing for me, but I still chill on the sidelines when it
gets too intense, or i just get too hot... need water... check in on
friends......

i have a few friends that just *don't* dance.  they love being there, but
just don't find it in themselves to get out there and shake it.  one of my
friends usually goes home with a numb wrist and hand from just kind of
moving his right hand to the music.  that is his way of dancing.  he has a
blast, and i can't imagine anyone telling him he is not doing the right
thing by enjoying himself as a wallflower.  the music pumping in your ears,
people dancing around... that is an Experience all in it'self.  the
lights... the pretty lights.... visuals from the beyond.  a bit of
brain-bend to put it all in perspective...

how can enjoying yourself, no matter how, be wrong?

peace

 I want really thinking of any specific cause.There are thousands
of issues to be dealt with ...i think different groups would like
to address different issues. One thing that i think would be nice
is El nino...it is killing millions of people and animals. It would be 
nice to think of ways that we could help besides just throwing money
at the problem which often does nothing.

I believe that there is tremendous power in putting our minds
together as group to solve problems...whether it be helping 
ill people, political issues, stopping drug wars, creating more
art, legal/rave issues, helping the homebound neighbor...etc..etc.

And i believe that raves that allow such a diverse group of people
to come together and reach a collective state of conciousness
can be even more powerful and it would be wonderful
to direct that power into humanitarian causes...not just throwing
money but finding practical ways to deal with the challenges.

Hi George!  ]=}


 Dionysus Dreams would be interested in helping with this. We have lots 
of schtuff (parachutes, lights, altar items, sound gear, lasers, 
projections, puppet theatre in the works as well as other alternative 
forms of social/interactive performance pieces).

 No chairs or couches tho....


hugz,

There is also an inner dance that i personally prefer.
I was creating rave like environments back in the early
70's in my apartment and meditating hanging out with 
friends and doing that inner dance thingy...i guess
its called journeying these days. 

So there are many types of dancing and even though
the body may be standing still the soul can be dancing
in many other dimensions.

Breakbeat is simply syncopation in the basic rhythm track - why is this a
big deal? - most pre -"electronica" (for lack of a better term) was and
often still is built on having the kick drum on 1 & 3 and the snare on 2 &
4 - this has a long history in pop music going back at least as far as 50's
R&B - when I say "built on" this literally the way the music is created in
the studio by musicians doing R&B and Funk, first you lay in the drums then
the rest of the rhythm (bass, guitar, keyboard, etc.), then any
instrumental breaks or solos or backing vocals (usually with a scratch
vocal line), then the final vocals and any other overdubs (there are a
bazillion exceptions to this ordering - this is music after all) .....

Since there's alot of other stuff going on the drums of were kept simple,
except at the turnarounds (at the 4th or 8th or 16th, etc. bar) when there
would be a space and the music would need a little push to go on to the
next verse or chorus or whatever - and the drum would play a little
sycopated phrase - a little "break" in the repetition of the basic rhythm
pattern of the song (some drum machines, like the Alesis actually organize
their preset patterns that way - a basic pattern and a break) ..... 

So Hip Hop DJs back in the 80's or so liked these little "breaks" and found
them sometimes more interesting and useful than the rest of the song, and
would construct mixes or entire new tracks based on looping or repeating
these patterns - either with two copies of a record on two turntables or
using a sampler .....

The other "4-on-the-floor" sort of rhythmic structure comes from 70's
disco where every beat has an accent (personally I believe it was that way
so white people could figure out how to dance to it) ..... so electronic
musicians picked up on this process of using the break's beat pattern, to
create a "Dance Track" (as opposed to a more guitar oriented pop song) -
only they started with their own original syncopated pattern - their own
break beat .....

What tends to happen is that because the basic rhythm
track is strongly syncopated the other parts tend to fall on top of, and in
alignment with the basic track - if you listen to Chemical Brothers
especially "Dig Your ...",  you'll notice that the bass line
riff comes in (usually some sort of Rock oriented sample in their case)
then the drum track comes in playing almost the same rhythm pattern with
maybe a couple of notes added or subtracted - or vice versa the rhythm will
be chugging along and a synth line will come in using the same or nearly
the same rhythm but with changes of pitch in the line .....

So Breakbeat can be in any tempo or style of Dance music and seems to me to
be a style or process of creating - personally  I think "4-on-the-floor"
(with 909 kick on every beat) has its place - but it's BORING if that's all
that's going on - pleaze, pleaze, pleaze DJs - no more 128 repetitions of
4-on-the-floor kick drum thank you very much.

Boy this ended up longer than I thought, probably more than you ever wanted
to know about the subject - Well, anyway, that's the end of tonight's
lecture on "Breakbeat Style in Late 90's Electronic Dance Music"

Or WHATEVER,
raen

Hi fellow music makers around the bay,

I find this conversation in general extremely interesting.  I would hope
that more of this type of discussion occurs, in addition to the usual
"when/where/how was" the party talk.  I hope this isn't as off topic
as some of the other posts are... this seems rave related.

i think that one of the coolest things i ever saw at a rave was this
guy, he was standing stock still on the side of the floor, but he had
this cool muppety looking marionette that was dancing it's ass off in
perfect sync with the music.  the guy made that little puppet pull off
the dopest moves i've ever seen, i was astounded...

wait a minute, did i already tell you guys about the puppet?

 I think that a singles party could potentially be fun but it could also turn
out to be really ackward.....what if only males show up...or vise versa? If I
was to go to a singles party....these thoughts would run through my head.....

1) what if no one likes me?
2) what if someone I'm not attracted to hits on me? 
3) what if someone I think I might be attracted to isn't attracted to me?
4) is everyone going to expect to hook up with someone?
5) I would feel really bad seeing people getting together with someone and
then myself not finding anyone
6) Can I talk to anyone without them thinking I'm hitting on them?

 I have more thoughts but I'm sure I sound strange already....I'm not trying
to be negative about the whole thing....because I do think it "could" be fun,
but I think it would turn out to be an ackward situation....I think everyone
who is single should all just get together and play...."spin the bottle" or
"7 minutes in heaven" he he he....I hope this post doesn't make anyone
mad....or think i am a shallow person.....because I AM SINGLE TOO!!!!!!!   =)

Maybe the kids are shy?  I empathize and have felt similar feelings at 
parties, especially crowded parties.  I just get worried (probably has 
something to do with growing up in a fundy family) when I start hearing 
about perceptions based on first sightings, etc.  I've just met a lot of 
really nice people who I once thought were jerks because they were 
posing, y'know?

Peace

Having shut the party down at the LAST MINUTE, it's only fair that they
should cover the damages.  There is no dollar amount that could describe
the kind of work that goes into such a large event.

Who's assuming an alternate persona?  I can imagine that the raving
community with all its creativity will come up with some fantastic stuff!
i think the DJ's spinning are OBLIGED to dress up, wouldn't you all agree?
Seems like every rave I go to is a costume party, or at least that's the
way it should be.   I'm not very creative, so I'm hoping you guys can come
up with some good ideas.

I believe it would take a pretty shallow person to judge
you as being shallow based soley on a post to sfraves.

and besides shallow people are welcome too.

and they are great when you need a new president or a movie
about some futuristic robot that returns to the present to 
terminate the past.

No they are not.  If I read correctly this is not "The Rave Community vs
The City of Alameda"  it's Coolworld, a for profit company vs the City of
Alameda.  They do not speak for me, nor anyone else I know.  They do
however speak for themselves.  Something they have always done.  Quite well
in fact.

>Don't get distracted by the $4.5 mill, its
>just a statement.

No it's just money, TAXPAYER money.  Distracted?  How can you do that if
you just follow the money.  For Collworld the whole object is money,
nothing to be distracted by, that is what they are about.  They are a for
profit company, dressed up in ravewear for marketing, and they sell a
product.  No, I'm afraid the money is much more than a statement, it is a
reason.  Their entire reson for existence.

No, that is the way our legal system works.  It is not so fucked up that I
would *dare* throw it out and try to do something *better* (I think the
founders were great thinkers, far better than the scum who have invaded
that space over the past couple of centuries...slavery notwithstanding,
they did a good job).

To me, there is no better system of jurisprudence.

Judging by teh Coolworld foldouts, you have to multiply your original
number by 10 fold.

>     But all that aside....  CWP is making a stand on

No they are not, they ar representing themselves.  And I am not so sure I
want them to win.  I never elected them, attended any of thier parties
(that is a lie, I went to one and left some 30 minutes later.  I got in on
guest as did my crew, and we bailed.  The party and vibe left plenty to be
desired.  I never attended another event.  That was 1994.

> They are saying that youth culture should

Nope, just to them.  I think they should have bene wiser than to even try
to do a partin in a military installation.  How dumb.  Anyway they are
making sure this never happens to them, and in the course of this ditch
effort, they will scare anyone they approach in the future.  I think that
if they win they will have a heck of a time finding other municipalities to
give them permits.  On the other hand, who cares.  If they pocket 4.5, or
2.1, they won;t have to throw another party again, and will probably go
away or break up and do smaller things that will eventually become
large...oh the drama.

No, that is not true.  There were vents in Oakland before Coolworld that
went on all hours...Flohouse anyone?  Anyway untrue.  Also as for fighting
for *OUR Youth Culture*, I do not consider it such.  I consider it dance
culture, since many of the players, movers, and shakers, are far removed
from being youth.  Just ask some of them (30 something so and so's ;) ).
They are fighting against discrimination against them.  This has happened
to other promoters and Coolworld was silent.  Don;t make them out to be
some great philanthropists.  They could only hope to aspire to such
greatness.

Or a rave promoter, or someone who works, or someone who has to feed your
kids, or someone who has to eat.  In any case I wonder what it must be like
to go to school, the only worry being soem scholarship or grades, with no
job other than school.  Now *that's* good living! Anyway learning is cool,
work is work.  If your parents didn;t work, and didn;t value that money,
you could have very well been one of the multitude of street urchins with
little or no hope.

Money isn;t the root of all evil, people are.

OH MY GOD!!!!!  I went to a party in Tahoe this last weekend and I heard the
best music I have ever heard!  Being the Happy Hardcore FREAK that I am, I
just about died at "Carnival Love" this weekend!  I jumped up and down, yelled
like a maniac, and busted a move at this party!  Josh Wishman spun in the
Jungle room and you guessed it... the only thing I love more than Happy
Hardcore is Jungle!  Wowie Zowie what a fly bunch of DJ's!  Anyway, I just
wanted you all to know how much fun I had and that I think I sweated off 5
pounds at that party!  Josh Wishman is making another apperance this weekend
and I am just Praying I can get Sat. off to go and shake my booty once again!
Lotsa love to you all-
                                                Glitter Princess :-)

hey kiddies... True or False    Happy Kids is Halloween night too?

I thought that it was but I haven't seen any posts about it!  Personally, I
like the smaller parties and would much rather attend it than Tribal Massive.
The only thing that is scarier than a massive would be a Halloween massive!
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  Anyway, any info anyone might have would be MUCH
appreciated!  Thanks again for coping with my dorky posts!

i guess i have to get completely cabbaged beyond hell to find raves here
at all stimulating if 70% of the crowd is sitting there "absorbing" it

i was thinking lately how now the techno scene has is seeing the split
that alternative/rock saw.  mainstreamers scowl at psychos... they scowl
at "weird" sounding stuff that doesnt "rock"  and spends effort working
on a different aspect of music... just a couple things i have notice

so many mainstrea ravers nowadays, way too many people that say "this
party is WACK" when theres some really interesting new music from a
different drummer than the lars ulrich of "progressive house"

i think we should all just plain admit it and LABEL gatherings whetther
they are about pop culture or subversive creative culture because getting
misplaced is not a fun thing for either faction.... (i hate $35 raves with
djs that play 100000 records i have heard 10000 times before) and the
poeple that love those kind of raves often hate the ones where the music
is new and different hmmmmm....

just wondering what some people feel/think because currently i feel REALLY
displacedbeing the minority even at spiraltribe parties here....

please help

Well that is obviously not true since you have placed a dollar amount on
such work.

The stuff you guys do may seem to you to be priceless, but let's face
facts.  After *all* of this passes (if it does), there will be no
monuments, no great human gains...after all it is just a party, like the
millions before it, it too will fade in time.  A lasting legacy?  Doubtful,
humans love to play and watch.  Whether it be the glory of Rome in
Coliseums, or the glory of butts moving at a party.  It's all the same.
Now when you guys start having gladiator fights, and lions, call me, I'll
pay $500 to attend such an event.

My cynicism at all things CW is well warranted.  I will now watch and see
if you guys attempt to rally the troops behind this cause (remeber, to
collect some 4.5 mil).  I can only wonder if you do succeed in doing so
will you pay the troops for thier valiance?  Or will there be, perhaps, a
FREE Massive by CW (and I mean free, no donations to some sundry cause, no
cans of food, I mean free, including guilt free)?

I'll just sit on the sidelines and coach from here.

Drama....gotta love it.  Lawyers and ravers, the devolution continues.

(On the other side, these guys have *BALLS* of steel doing this.  I admire
them for one reason, at least thier fighting for what they beleive in, and
doing it by any means necessary.  I have always said people need to get in
the game.  From where I stand, I just wish it was someone else who was
doing it.  But who other than CW is so well organized and well funded to
pull this off.  My hats off to them for their courage!)

Late,
John

Sure there is, and 4.5Mil is a ridiculously high figure.

Aaaaaaaaaaa-men to that!  I would have to say that I am on that single list. 
 I thought that I had found the perfect one for me, so fairy tale like the 
way it all happened; only he was not ready for what I wanted.  He thought he 
was, but still had a broken heart from his X---not to mention a problem with 
E & pot.  But yah, neways a raver boyfriend near my age would rock!  
Someday...

I have this dream that I am at a rave and then this guy comes up to me and 
says that he has been watching me for so long and finally has brought 
himself to me.  He is gorgeous in every way-physical & mental.  As he dances 
with me its like we are one, so in sync and the love we feel is real and the 
fairy tale is true to last for both of me and you.  Sometime it varies, but 
the idea is the same.

It is just my personal opinion of course, but i feel like raves are
ideally safe spaces (places that people can feel like they can be
themselves
and not be harrassed, ridiculed, or harmed at least MOST of the time).
I think that anything one might want to do there as long as it isn't
stepping
on someone else's rights should be okay and also subject to the same
respect.

Ya know, maybe that person isn't the same as you.  Maybe they haven't
figured
out the intense joy dancing can bring yet.  Maybe they are insecure. 
Maybe a rave
is not a safe enough space to them yet.  Maybe they need some time to
check it out.
Maybe they just need a few more positive experiences before they can
"cut loose" and
dance without worrying about whatever.

People who criticize a lot tend to at least sometimes be very insecure.
I am not saying that it increases the vibe for the party for people to
be like that,
but maybe they can't contribute yet.  I bet ya a dollar if they keep
going and
keep feeling warmth from those around them that those walls would come
down.

Just my thoughts.

your friend jen

so this summer i went to so many incredible parties - lunar love (any
sfravers there?), 4x4, and play nice, in particular, stand out.  and
while the fact that they were outdoors made them really cool, i
thought the best thing about these parties was the beautiful vibe i
felt there. i mean, at this point it's a little cold to hang outside,
but i've been missing that ug plurry diy atmosphere lately.  now where
do you suppose i could find that again?

i just think, from a poor college student standpoint, that $30 for a 
rave is waaaaayyyyy too much......Sure i like big events, but I'm also 
down with small parties too..... i just wish that raves would become 
more accessible to those who cant spend 20-30 bucks every weekend just 
to dance and listen to music.. if thats what its coming too....i might 
as well chill at home and start producing my own jungle sounds.. and 
dance with my self in the mirror :)
my 2 cents.. please dont get angry...
-=*hugs*=- and good vibes for all.. either way, we'll be partying, 
whether in body or in mind or in spirit.. :)
peace

I was tring to aviod jumping on the singularity thread but I decided 
that I must put in my 2 cents in. 

One thing that I liked about raves (most of them mind you , not all, I 
have been to meat market raves, which usually sucked) is that it was an 
environment where you could talk to people w/o having that same club 
type expectation of automagicly thinking that anybody who talked to you 
was tring to pick up on you, or any body you talk to thinks that you are 
tring to pick up on them!!! I did meet my girlfriend of the past year at 
a rave but the whole relationship was based on a friendly non-pick-up 
additude. I think this whole idea of a singles party is a bad idea 
because I feel that it would make people have a similar additude I have 
seen in the club environment which seems to brew the questions below:

.................plz cut upon the dotted line................
>1) what if no one likes me?
>2) what if someone I'm not attracted to hits on me? 
>3) what if someone I think I might be attracted to isn't attracted to 
me?
>4) is everyone going to expect to hook up with someone?
>5) I would feel really bad seeing people getting together with someone 
and
>then myself not finding anyone
>6) Can I talk to anyone without them thinking I'm hitting on them?

NooOOooO sheet :)
staying home and inviting over friends and their ideas and record crates
has been a much cheaper and much more interesting music wise way to spend
weekends thren shelling out $100000s of dollars for prodigy concerts.

you also learn a lot more about people and how they respond to music and
what they like in their music when they spin for only a few friends rather
than a bunch of angry raversa wanting to get their $300000 worth out of
the "party"

hrehehehehhheh im in a much better mood i dont know why, maybe my stomach
has begun to digest itself hence giving me the nutrition i have been
lacking today

does anyone have an extra ticket for Death in June? i totally forgot to
get one this weekend and its sold out now

u have *got* to be kidding...if so, hit d...if not, take your racial
generalizations/stereotypes/ignorance elsewhere...

if what u really meant to say was "so it would have a broader commercial
appeal" then say that in the first place...

where does this snobbery come from? everything from my race is better than
yours to my music is better than yours lately?

Hi. I'm new to this list and to raves, but have been to many concerts where
I am one of the very few who is at least MOVING on the floor and enjoying
everything that is surrounding me. I agree completely with this side of
this dispute that seems to come up on every music mailing list in the
internet. Why go if you just do what you would do at your house? Or at
least go sit down somewhere? I hope I haven't made any enemies already....

I agree and that is why i believe it might be nice to have
a way or place to facilitate this. Im not sure exactly how to do
that but i know i would like to see more rave/weddings like
truelove and anything we can do to bring couples together
would be great.
 
So in order to have truelove number 2 we need to find another
raver couple willing to get married...so who is it going to be?

Man, that sounds hella cool.  That would just make any party perfect,
regardless if it's a good party or not.  The way you described it would
have to happen to me 'cause I'm kinda shy.  Only if it seems totally,
completely right would I have it in me to go talk to her.  Either that or
if she talked to me.  You see, I can never really start a conversation
but once someone comes and starts talking to me, I'm a totally cool
person to talk to.  It's kinda weird.  Just need a catalyst.

My ideal situation would be something like this.  Let's say I'm at that
party Wonder coming up.  I'm sitting there DJing my first party in the
room with open decks.  While DJing, I make eye contact with a girl and I
can just tell there's something there.  Eventually she walks over to me
but doesn't really say anything to me.  The whole time DJing, we just
kinda non-chalantly glance at each other but underneath it all we are
just totally attracted to each other.  At the end of the set, she comes
over to me and sincereley says that she really enjoyed the music that I
played (which sometimes seems like it wouldn't happen since ambient isn't
the most popular music in the world).  We introduce each other, I go put
my rekkids back, and we spend the rest of the party dancing to Macadio
'till we're tired and finally spend the whee hours just chillin' and
talking in the chill room while holding each other or something.  Then to
top it off, we kiss each other good-bye and exchange numbers (another
plus, she lives fairly close to me).  Epilogue:  We eventually fall madly
in love and are happy forever or something like that.  Yeah, that'd be
pretty KEWL.

Hullo all.
Tonight at 6AM-9AM UK time (10PM-1AM San Fran time, I think) me and 
some pals will be playing live from London on the interface internet 
pirate radio station. We'll be doing tech-house stuff and there's a chat room 
for you to play around in and say hello.
Go to:
http://www.pirate-radio.co.uk
And follow the links to Interface
There is a pretty good bandwidth available as there is a server 
dedicated to the station in the US as well as the UK.
Seeya there.

Funky Desert Breaks -

It has *some* breakbeat but I wouldn't call it an example of the genre...

I would try a comp like "Hardhop and Trypno" or that one Omar Santana did 
of all those Tricked Out records... those are better examples of the 
genre on a track-by-track kind of basis

Of course, you could always check out an Uncle Noah mixtape, too... :D :D :D

I talked to Mr. Trouble at the Trance & Jungle factory last night; he 
feels 
like a bloody arse because his 1200's are back ordered.

So he said that if you find another joint that'll meet-or-beat his price
but needs to call him for confirmation that his product is on the shelf,
 go talk to Thomas first and he will say that they are in stock so 
you can get the discount.  but you need to TALK TO HIM first.

He's the funny looking kid with the accent.

If there is anything I miss about raves it's that it seems like there 
used to be so many diffrent types of people from other scenes that made 
up the crowd. It seems today that only certain types of people are 
pre-disposed to even checking out the rave scene. OUR scene was built on 
all thease diffrent types of people and on all our diffrent beliefs 
being united by music. 
Just something I remember and thought y'all should think about-

Raf

Of course. :) That's the UNLTIMATE date. I just did that last weekend and
had a great time. I think the more and more you get to know someone and
care about them the better the Xperience is. :) We're going to Tribal
massive next week...... I can't wait to see Josh Wink.

Hello out there!!!

Well I have finally graduated to being on this list
I would just like to say hello to a few personal friends
Lesile my sweet Fairy Raver Mom I have missed you something allful
and even if Randy loves another, you will always hold a special part in
my hart.

Randy, your losing sight of long lost friends,  your lucky they forgive
easy, but if you have time to e-mail this list I will be expecting a
message soon. ( I have tried every other way to get a hold of you.) I
know how you are all wraped up but this is rediculious

Pango: I think you will make a perfect Scrappy and I will be sure to
bring the Scoobie snaks

I hope to see everyone on Holloween

Now down to important matters

 I have this great van that needs a new home


 1983 Ford Econoline 150 full size custom van
 automatic, only  82 thousand miles on it,
 air, wall to ceiling carpet, interior lights,  dual .
 tanks, tires have another 18k 
 on them,  driver and passenger seat and a bed/seat 
 in the back (very comfortable), lots of room for equipment, comes 
 with a power wheel chair lift that really helps getting 
 all your crap in the van without breaking your back,


 I have fit up to sixteen ravers in it at one time and there was easily
 room for  a few more. Her name is Atilla The Honey and she is my baby, 
 but alas I live in SF and she isn't very practical anymore.   I would
 really like her to go to a good home that she would be appreciated.


 I live in SF but she is staying with friends in San Jose right now.  So
 any visitors would have to get there.


 only $3,000

Sorry to spam the entire list but there are enough of us music makers on
this list to let you all know about a website my room-mate Paul has put
together.

www.spareroomstudio.com

It's new and smallish but growing quickly and contains lots of
real-audio tracks from music makers from all over. ambient, dub, house,
techno, etc.

It's aimed at people like us making music in low budget home based
studios.

It all started when he got his hands on a copy of Rebirth and created a
few tracks. We then hooked up with Crisp Records here in SF and added
some tracks created by DJ Rasoul and DJ Don Crisp. The Crisp record
tracks should be available soon on vinyl.

Anyway... if anyone else out there is creating music and needs a web
place to put a track or two (or even a link to your own site) check it
out.

Thanks,

Martin

well... if it's not about the money and only for the scene.

CoolWorld Productions, will you throw a *FREE* mega-massive with all
your name brand DJ's and super-galactic lazers and exotic space-hoochie
dancers and cyber-moon-castles... if you win the suit?

What would you have to lose?

You can easily prove yourselves if you did throw a *FREE* CyberFest.

Could ja? Would ja? Ya should! =)

I wouldn't dare challange you to throw a massive outta your own pocket,
but as we can see, it costs somewhere inbetween $300,000-$400,000 to put
on this years CyberFest, if you win enough money to cover costs lost and
enough to put on a *FREE* CyberFest, would ya do it?

Prove us wrong! =)

o/~ go coolworld... go coolworld... it's ya birthday!! o/~

 peace.jer

oh yeah.... although I don't agree with what CWP does, I think it's fair
what they are doing.

Raf,

Can yo be a little more specific about the timeframe you're talking about
with "used to"....?  Seven years?   Three years?  One year?  Six months?

We have these "it ain't the same anymore" discussions often, but if you can
give us a point of reference of when you're talking about, that would be
helpful...

(since a recent conversation about how things weren't the same anymore
turned out to be initiated by someone who'd been partying for 4 months or
something)

I met this guy at Sweet last weekend, and he's easily in his late 40s
[sorry if i'm overshooting this, tom]...  He told me about the three
things that attract people to amusement parks:
1. that feeling you get when you are on a roller coaster, about to go
down the big hill
2. that you know you are safe
3. that there's a wonder and awe to the experience....

A good party, good vibe, people....  *this* is the feeling, and it's the
safety, I think, that makes it easier to let go and trust - this isn't
easy for a lot of us.

OK, another personal note:  I was a dancer for fifteen years, and didn't
go to any event where there would be dancing for a long time because I
literally turned my back on my body [just dropped 25lbs i've been
carrying for ten years].  It wasn't until just a few months ago [my
first Goa party], that i said, fuckit!  I don't care what these people
look like, and if they really care what I look like, then it doesn't
matter if i'm dancing or not.

Raves are about music. Not everyone dances to show how much they
appreciate it.  When was the lsat time you saw Sho or BrianB or Rocky M
or MysterE or JohnS at the front of the crowd dancing? [assuming that
they are only there when i am not totally tranced out] I usually see
these guys watching the art of their piers - the *making* of the music.

You and John are right on mark with this call. So how
about it Cooworld? Show us you really care about our
scene and not (just) your wallet getting fat! There are
a lot of folks out here who have completely lost
faith in you. Are you up to the task?

I think this should be the point, and not any dissing of cool world (if
you don't like em, don't go).... the point is that if a party like the
Exotic Erotic ball got nuked at the last minute (after everybody bought
tix, promoters set it up, got permits, performers flew in from out of
town, etc etc etc) there'd be hell to pay on the part of the city-wanks
that pulled the permits at the last moment. I don't think there should
be any difference if the breach of contract (which is what the suit
appears to be fundamentally) is for a rave, for a black and white ball,
or for exotic erotic, or whatever.

The difference is that the exotic erotic and/or black/white ball has
socialites and money and power on it's side, so that would never
happen.  Even if the "morals" of a party like the Exotic Erotic Ball
don't play well by the community standards of the greater bay area
either.... It's time for ravers to claim their power as well,
politically, monetarily, by whatever means necessary. I'm sure Sasson P
ain't poor, so I guess this means he's got the power as well.

Kudos to CW for this lawsuit.

Even if coolworld is not really a rave since they dont do things
like "real ravers" at least they are standing up to police
and government abuse.

I see lots of ravers complaining about being harassed and busted
but how many are doing something to change that?

I know this will probably gernerate some flame but could
you please include an explanation of what you are doing
to stop police brutallity/harasment in your flame? Or
at least a suggestion of what we _could_ do?

"you gotta fight for your right..."  - except...

if the law suit was about making things right by say, making the
governing bodies responsible for the cancellation finance a coolworld
event as retribution, i would agree that cw would be fighting the good
fight. but with these kinds of stakes, i can't see a whole lot of good
coming out of it. my biggest nightmare here is that:

1) coolworld refuses to settle for an amount comparable to what was
"lost" and demands their day on court

&

2) the government is forced to battle the case in and out of the courts,
mostly likely by throwing up a smokescreen and putting cw & ravers on
trial and in the headlines. we don't need anymore slanted 48hr or 20/20
reports misinforming the rest of the world about how we spend our time.

Well since we are on the subject of the way it used
to be do any of you remember "Toon Town"?  well if
you do you will be glad to know that Preston and the
others are trying to put togehter another one for the
newyear of 97-98 I remember the last Toon town I went
to was on New Years of 91 I believe someone correct
me if im wrong? or was it holloweene?? well it was
"Super Nova" and it was downtown I think we cruised
by then when to the old infamous "16@harrison you
know wally and Jimmy's place well I hope for some of
you this was a nice trip down memory lane?  Well
things have changed but I think some good and some
bad but one thing we have to remember it has always
been progressive with the Music, people and Ideas..
Like Vlad says 

"Keep it Real" that is what it is all about..

One love!!

my gawd, your right.... fuck.... I can just see it now.... wow..... this
is way worse than I thought. I mean the public already thinks that all
us ravers are wakkos that hangout all night and do drugs, now they'll
think we're insane for sueing the county for not providing us a place to
do all that! of course not exactly like that, but something like that!
whoa... this is terrible!

John,
I've always respected you on most every post you have made in my 2 years on this
list.  but this time I have to tell you that you are completely wrong about what
you know and what you think you know about CW.   Try a little open minded
approach to the entire situation, and evaluate ALL the possibilities of this
suite, not just the narrow view of the $$.  Its truly not all about that, There
are a lot of principles involved in this suit, and if it is won... everyone
wins.  Maybe you can try to see this... hopefully you can get past your
animosities and understand the bigger picture.  This is a time when credibility
can be established for this "Youth-Dance Culture"  A president can be established
with this suit, that would make legal and political agencies think twice about
discriminating against this scene.   I could go through your entire reply and
comment about all your misconceptions, but why bother.  We all have our visions,
and our limitations.

It was New Years. The single largest party I think I have ever seen or

I do not have the authority to speak for CWP, but I would be very surprised
if this did not happen.  Lets assume hypothetically that in 2-3 years, after
this suite is settled, there will be some sort of event to celebrate the
landmark decision that sets a president to all who would consider
discriminating against independent organizers, and the freedom of youth to
assemble and dance.   That's what this thing is all about.  Fairness, and
equal representation under the letter of the law.  Not about the $$$.  A
suite like this is not worth fighting if its just about the money, there are
a lot better ways to spend a few years of your life.  But if it does happen,
I wouldn't be surprised if CWP through a free party.  But then again this is
all speculation, and who knows what is going to happen in real life.  But if
it was me... I would do it... BIG TIME... And make the Alameda Naval Air
Station  host the event, just to throw it in their faces!!!!

Keep it Real

     It's not that the people are no longer there it's that the scene has
been devide in to groups. You have your Goa Trance parties, House parties,
Jungle parties, Breakbeat parties, etc. Before you also had clubs that only
played top 40 or hip hop not alot of clubs had (so called) rave music. Now
just about every club out there plays house or techno so most of the crowd
that is 21 and over goes to the clubs. Parties before used to have House,
Techno, Trance, Breakbeat, Ambient, Jungle and so on. The music used to be
diverse now you have your little so called clicks that just stick to there
own style of music and don't make it interesting for everybody. Don't get me
wrong there are a few people (Few!!!!!) that throw parties and have a little
variety of different styles of music.

i believe that cw has to do what's right for them as people - sorry (and
i hope you - whoever that is - agree), but screw the business end, $
comes and goes... your humanity is the only constant.  what's right for
them maybe to sue. with the limited info i have heard, i believe they
*were* wronged and shouldn't just blow it off.

however...

it isn't easy to predict the out come of cases like these, and on how
many different levels a community will react. cw may win their suit or
not, but a whole lot can happen in between. there's a vietnamese
(possibly chinese first, but vietnam lived it) proverb that basically
says "when two great bulls do battle it's the ground that suffers." 

either way, ironically enough, it looks like we'll all have to sit back
and watch ...

I imagine that John, like myself has seen and talked to to enough folks to
have at least a reasonable idea of what CW is about. And hey, John is one
up on me, he actually went to one, if for but 30 min... So, because these
folks are your friends/associates/business partners/whatever, John is
wrong in his opinion and experiences? Sorry, I don't follow the logic.

The lawsuit says otherwise.

Really? What is my take of the 4.5mil? Does everyone win? Hell no. As
someone pointed out, if CW wins the taxpayers lose. I'm a taxpayer. I
LOSE.

That said, I still think CW is justified in their suit, and I hope they do
get a *FAIR* (read not 4.5mil) settlement.

Your assertation that this action was taken in an attempt to discriminate
against "the scene" is dubious. This action was, according to base
officials taken because of the possibility and their *PRIOR EXPERIENCE*
with noise complaints with late night activities on the base. I didn't see
any mention of particulars other than NOISE.

You could, and John would eat you for lunch(hi John.) 

Vlad, I have said this before and I will continue to say this:

I have no problem with CW, you, or anyone else making a small amount, or
amassing a fortune from events. What I *do* have a problem with is when
people are not direct and honest about their motives in conducting
themselves and their "business." 

CW are not martyrs. They do not represent me. They do not represent
the "dance culture" in the Bay Area, which has been around much longer 
than, is much bigger than, and will be around after CW is long forgotten.
CW represents *itself* and it's attendees. 
They are not doing me any favors by their lawsuit. The are, and have been
about *money* Because you will not admit, and further, flatly deny this, I
find anything you say suspect. Do yourself a favor and save the 
self-righteous Christ-on-the-Cross martyrdom speech for people that will
buy it.

Why go?  It's *not* your house. The music is a million times louder, and
there isn't a bunch of people dancing to it, or walking around with
glowsticks [don't know about you, but I've never found a rave at my house
in the evening when i get home from work].  Somehow going to a rave is a
bit different, and kinda more fun than listening to my same old music at
home, playing it pretty quiet so my crack dealing neighbors don't know i
have a system worth stealing [bad neighborhood].  Sitting down is sometimes
necessary, and may be what I choose to do.  I could just as easily tell you
*that* was the right thing to do.  [on a harsher note:] who are you to tell
me I'm not doing the right thing?

>>if you arent going to do anything to contribute, dont take up space?!?!?!
****
not contributing if you... what...? aren't dancing?  well, cant those
wallflowers with a smile on their face, wiggling thier hands, or
marianettes, or hugging on a friend while they peak to the music... isn't
that contributing good vibe?  they are enjoying themselves...  aren't you?
or have been you been spending your night giving off negative vibe
concerning yourself over the wallflowers, thinking how they aren't a
positive addition. maybe you are the one who is spreading "you shouldn't be
here" negativity.  those people don't have a problem with  you... why don't
you lay off them and enjoy yourself dancing, or whatever is your thing.  if
putting people down for enjoying themselves is your thing, maybe you should
go sit at home untill you have learned to play well with others.

>>DO your own thing, yes :) but if "not doing anything" is "your own thing"
>>go sit on the haight all night and do your own thing. 
****
they probably *are* doing their own thing.  Sitting and enjoying
themselves.  you got a problem with that?  thanks for spreading the
negativity.  Are you sure you understand PLUR?  you don't respect them for
doing their own thing, enjoying themselves.. you don't seem to want to let
them have their peace.  an ultimatum where they either do what *you* think
is right, or leave to go sit in the cold, is a rather selfish look at
unity.  try and tell me you love them while you're telling them to go sit
on the haight.

They have every bit as much right to be there as you.  they paid their
money, for whatever reason, and it's not for you to say if they are having
a good time, or that they are doing the wrong thing by enjoying themselves
on the wall.  raves may be about dancing  to you, but everyone doesn't
share your opinion.  

i love to dance at parties, i rarely leave the floor, i am not opposed to
dancing by my self in the middle of a barren dancefloor.  if the music is
dancable to me, and i'm up for it mEntally and physically, i'm there
dancing.  

just try and keep in mind, those wallflowers arent' trying to bring down
*your* vibe, but you're trying to bring down theirs, giving them the "you
don't belong" or "your doing the wrong thing" or "you should leave"
negativity.

Ray,

All I can say is I am seeing the reality, at least mine, of the situation.
Logic bears my thoughts out completely.  I am as open-minded as the next
person.  I just don't see how you can foist all of these goals and ideals
on a comapny who you are not authorized to represent.  I challenged those
assertions, then gave them props for their courage.

I can only read numbers, & listen to the street.  This little lawsuit is in
the noise of people's lives (except the CW people).  Just another lawsuit.
There is *NO* rallying cry from rave promoters to support CW (after all it
is in a promoters best interest for other parties NOT to succeed), nor from
the rave community in general.  Nor from anyone else I know other than you
and thier DJ's, who paint the most glowing picture of their philosophies.

>Try a little open minded
>approach to the entire situation, and evaluate ALL the possibilities of this
>suite, not just the narrow view of the $$.

Ray, I did evaluate and gave them props, that's all they'll get from me.
This isn't Rodney King, or Judy Barry, or Critical Mass, it's a party,
entertainment.  The $$$'s are what COolworld is about (please state how I
am incorrect).  There is nothing wrong with that, I am also about $$$'s.
Love it.  Lots of it, and I want more of it.  I work, doing my thang to
make $$$'s and it works.  I love money and nothing is wrong with that.  CWP
loves money too, lots of it.  They work hard for it, they do everything
they can to get it.  If that means putting out a massive 4 color flyer that
ends up in the wastebasket, as much as advertisements do, then go for it.
I don't frequent thier parties because I am not down with *anything* they
do.  That's how I voice my protest.  As a amtter of fact I've stayed out of
most CW discussions, but I couldn't help but butt-in when I saw you putting
a spin on this whole thing as some type of *movement for dance culture*,
yikes.

Here are the possibilities:
-CW Wins:
 + They will get some $$'s (taxpayer $$'s mind you) who knows how much.
 + They will secure permits and throw another party charging people to get
in (obvious).
 + They will secure permits and throw a FREE party(not so obvious).
 + The rave community is shown that if they stick up for thier rights
vigorously they too can get things done.
-CW Loses:
 + They may try another angle and sue again.
 + They will secure permits and throw another party charging people to get in.
 + The rave community is shown that if they stick up for thier rights
vigorously they too can get things done.

That's pretty much it.  Authorities will not be frightened by them or any
other late night party.  So although it may embolden some promoters, I can
easily see municipalities withdrawing all support for all night events due
to the litiginous nature of ravers.  Bitten once you know.

The narrow view of dollars is a self-fulfilling edifice of CWP.  If they
were *really* about dance culture they would have helped others with
getting legal assistance, they would do free parties in the park, etc.
There are tons of things people with money and capital can do, that CWP has
YET to do. (Now of course this is up to some promoters as well, I doubt
*anyone* has asked CWP to help them out due the the innate animosity of
for-profit/lifestyle promoters toward one another).

Let's get JSLick:
I am a promoter of a large successful party.  As a amtter of fact, I'm
incorporated, me and my partners.  We've made stax of cash and now it's
time for our benefit party.  We ask, for the children, that you bring in a
can of food for admission, we'll drop $5 off the price to $20.  The food
will go to the  Food For Homeless Children Fund.  After the pary, I'm
counting my cash, and my cans.  I add up the value of the cans, write it
down, and take that as a charitable *tax deductible* donation from my
company.  Allowing me to effectively pocket more money.  Now that's USFingA
Philanthropy, but someone's gotta do it.

Better yet I'll do a free party and ask for cans.  Of course writing off
everything as an expense w/ a tax write-off to boot.

JSLwakeup.....

Now I am in no way insisting that CW or any other promoter has engaged in
such, er, acts.  I am however looking past the $$'s as instructed.  And you
know what I see?, more $$$.

This whole idea about philanthropic parties has been irritating me for
years.  The one plausible and easy way to give back the the dance community
is to have a free event.  After all the dance community is affording you a
certain lifestyle, you should give back.  Short of that I could care less.

>Its truly not all about that, There
>are a lot of principles involved in this suit, and if it is won... everyone
>wins.

I am curious as to how that is so?  What?, do you think parties will
finally be out of the grasps of officials?  You think that if the lawsuit
is won that the cops will get the message?  The local authorities will get
the message?

real world check:
There was a FEDERAL injunction against the cops shutting down parties in SF
around 95.  Do you know what happened?  The cops still shut down parties,
even permitted ones like 1015 Folsom.

Did you know that after Civil Rights legilastion was passed int he 60's,
people were still killed and lynched.  Even governeors wouldn't obey the
laws.  What in g-ds green earth gives you the notion that a party is going
to change anything other than a record?  Looking at history, I suggest that
things will be staus quo, that CWP will  not do a freebie, and that they'll
be back at the grind of making more $$$ oops I mean parties in a short
while.  Please tell me how wrong I am, I do want to be wrong and will admit
to such if so.

Lesson:  short of a national guard you may be up shits creek with laws as oars.

So far though we're BOTH speculating.  I do not know the outcome nor do I
know *anything* about CWP motives, ambitions.  I am making well educated
guesses by what they've done in the past.  But I could be very wrong and
end up with egg on my mug when CWP announces a huge free party, rides and
all, dancers and all, GRATIS, with a bug FU to the non-believers.  I hope
you will accept same egg on face when it happens in the converse and they
give a rats ass about a freebie.

>Maybe you can try to see this... hopefully you can get past your
>animosities and understand the bigger picture.

G-d I hate this type of holier than thou attitude.  I do not hate CWP, I
don;t go to their parties, nor do I admire them.  You made assertions I
challenged them. That does not make me hateful of CWP or you, I challenged
your ideas and adressed them.  And I did not call you clueless, naive, or
any other characterization.  Too bad the same courtesy was not extended to
me.  Another courtesy you forget is the decency of an explanation.  I have
explained thoroughyl my thoughts and how I think about it.  You wouldn't
even do that as a corrtesy saying:"I could go through your entire reply and
comment about all your misconceptions, but why bother.  We all have our
visions,
and our limitations."  Also the characterizations of:
close mindedness, and animosity.  Without any proff or backup.

Well if you're not going to backup what you say then that is your issue.
Don't be suprised at people checking your assertions.  Nothing goes
unchallenged here on SFR.

>This is a time when credibility

With human history as my teacher, I say that this is not true at all.

>   I could go through your entire reply and
>comment about all your misconceptions, but why bother.  We all have our

>and our limitations.

As for misconceptions I did read a tone of them in your previous posts
standing up for your CWP crew.  I mean if they were half of the things you
said I would say nothing in reply.  They are not, so I did.  I do want to
be wrong and await proof of their philanthropy.

The only limitation I've found within myself how long I can dance these
days.  I can go about 1 hour, then I need to kiss my lady for a little bit.
Oh yeah, I don't like the tank/top bra look, that's another one of my
limitations.  I am limited to seeing that as a totally non-sexy outfit,
even when done correctly.  Ladies (and gents who may dress this way too),
tuck in the bra strap, it's tacky.

That is a interesting question???  I do not have an answer to that, no
one can answer that except you.   Maybe you weren't around in early 94
when CWP stood up for the rave community and was able to get the Mayors
office to grant them the VERY FIRST OFFICIAL after-hours extension given
by the city since the Vietnam War.  Since that president was set, every
promoter can now go and also apply for that same kind of permit.  and
the city can not turn them away if they meet all the necessary
qualifications on the basis of discrimination.  Well i'm sure since then
you may have enjoyed the efforts of CWP anytime you have gone to many of
the parties that take place in oakland... Even though you may have not
given it any thought.   We the situation id the same here.  and unless
it is fought, then maybe the city of oakland will decide that they can
get away with jerking permits after they have given them out, just like
Alameda and the Navy did, and all of a sudden ... oops no more raves in
Oakland... and everyone's is asking "why are the police discriminating
like this??"  ...  get my drift...  think about it, and then ask your
question again.

Keep it Real

Cool. I just got confirmation that I will be recieving the entire set up
(Mixer and DJ CD decks) from Pioneer for two months to review for Citi:Zen.
If you have anything that you think I should know about when I write about
them, let me know.

I'm stoked that they are kickin' them down for me to mess with!

The 700's look sweet! I've got  all the promotional material for them and
according to everything, CD mixing looks likes it's on the up and up.

    I didn't mean to imply that I didn't want CWP standing up for my rights
as a raver, all I wanted to do was to bring to your attention to the fact
that no one really knows CWP's motives are EXCEPT CWP.  So how are we
supposed to join a group of promoters' cause if we don't fully understand
what's going on?  Lots of people have negative views on what CWP is
thinking, and to tell you the truth, so do I.  4.5 million dollars ... I
dunno ... maybe it's a statement.  People's eyebrows raise when they see
that kind of figure so it could be CWP's way of getting the public's
attention.  But of course, I'm not here to decipher what CWP wants, nor do I
really care to.
    You're right on one thing and that's the judicial precedent.  No body of
legislature would touch a matter like this if a court had previously struck
it down.  And even if something did pass through, it would be tied up in the
courts, much like prop 187 and the recently deceased CDA.  However, I have
given a lot of thought about this.  If you want to make a statement, YOU DO
NOT USE MONEY AS A TOOL.  Civil disobedience never involved suing the bus
company because they made you sit in the back of the bus.  Men and women
with nobility sat down and faced arrest for a cause they believed in.  If
this is something that Coolworld Productions believes in, then it would
organize more than just a group of lawyers.
    You know what though? I might have even been swayed to follow your
persuasive arguement but there's something that has bothered me to no end.
THERE IS NO UNITY ON THIS MATTER.  Many of the more vocal list members have
demonstrated their displeasure with CWP.  So it leads me to believe an
analogy my father taught me.  A country should not fight a war unless the
people are behind its cause.  Thus a father should not do something his
family does not support.
    Now I ask you again, what if the community doesn't want CWP representing
them?
    I think you're a really intelligent individual, Vlad, and I respect ALL
of your opinions, I just happen to disagree with you on this matter.

    : ) : ) : )  LOVE ALWAYS  : ) : ) : )

    Nico


P.S.  And personally I don't see how a 32 year old promoter (like the one
mentioned in the CWP article in Mercury News) could accurately represent a
broke ass college student/raver like myself.

ya know, i've never been to a super huge massive, and i was looking
forward to the alemada party.  so, what i'm curious about, being
fairly new to the bay area, is why everyone disses coolworld so hard. 
don't get me wrong, there may be perfectly legit reasons for doing so,
i just don't know 'em.  i mean, what's the big difference between the
coolworld party, which got harshed on constantly before it happened on
this list, and the massive that ftt is throwing on halloween?  i
haven't heard anyone blasting them for throwing a massive, but it
seems like the almeda gig had a lot of the same talent plus a few
other choice dj's to boot, in an interesting location, with rides, for
the same price.  granted, funky techno tribe throws exellent free
parties in golden gate park...

it seems to me that making some quick cash throwing huge parties has
always been intergal part of the rave scene (a part, mind you, not the
whole of it), starting in britain with the huge illegal countryside
parties (you can bet some people made a LOT of dough on those parties).

finally, i'd like to point out that almost every party i've been to
(or tried to go to) recently has gotten busted.  i support anyone
doing anything to help rectify the situation.  and if they make a few
million in the process, well, so be it.  the point of huge settlements
like that is to make it hurt for the people who lose - i mean, the us
navy or town of alemeda probably wouldn't blink at losing $300,000 in
a court case.  besides, legal battles are long, expensive, and
unpleasant.  if coolworld loses, they'll just be that much more in the
hole...

    WOW...OK...HMMMMM.....alright... John and everyone else on the list... It is my
believe that we all have our own beliefs on this issue. :)  And I am not going to
try to impose my perspective on anyone , and if I have I apologize for it.  However
that will not stop me from expressing my perspective to anyone that cares to read
it.
    I feel that if CWP wins this case, then everyone in the dance community wins,
because....  There will be less discrimination and more options for future dance
promoters to pursue.  Many promoters, including myself have benefited from previous
CWP activities.  Much more than CWP has benefited from other promoters activities.
Sure CWP is in it for the money, they are a business, but they are in the business
of providing entertainment to people, and that is also what they are about... and
4.5 million... that's just a joke...  after settlement hearings and evaluations,
and attorney, court, deposition, and investigative costs... shit they would be
lucky to receive a settlement for just the physical cost of the event...  How's
that for absurd...  if they really wanted to make money of this, then they should
have sued for 20 million.
    Any ways, my whole point in standing up for cool world is that I feel that they
got very wronged, and if they, or someone, does not do something about it, then it
will keep happening.  This goes deeper than anything that has been written in the
papers, there is a lot of conspiring going on within the political bodies of the
city of Alameda, Oakland and the Navy that caused the cancellation of this event,
and if CWP did not sue them, then Oakland would follow and they would be the next
city to follow Alamedas example.   There is a lot more going on here than the
obvious, so lets all hope and pray that this lawsuit will plug the leak in the dam,
or else the future looks bleak for permits in Oakland.  Because this suit was
filed, everything is going to be ok for permits and parties will still happen.  But
if it was not filed, then we would start seeing situations develop in early 98 that
would make it extremely difficult and expensive for promoters to obtain permits for
all nighters.  There are a lot of players that would rather not see this raving
develop, or that would rather develop it themselves, then there are (legal, voting)
supporters of raving.  It is a total uphill battle, all the time, with very few
shortcuts.
    Many of you on this list have very little understanding of what it takes to
obtain permits and all the politics involved.... and that's ok...  it shouldn't be
your concern, nor is it anyone's (but the promoters) responsibility.  But I do
know, and What I know is that CWP isn't starting a fight, they are fighting back.
And they are fighting for all of us at the same time, so that the situation does
not escalate, and we are all getting a free ride.   The magnitude of what's
happening right now, will not be realized for some time to come, and at that point
people will have a higher opinion for organizations like CWP, that fought the
necessary fights to keep politicians, organized entertainment, and conservative
lobbies from stepping all over anyone whose perspectives they don't agree with.
    That is why I am standing up for CWP, because I realize what's really going
on.  And as time goes on, and details surface, many of you will probably be jumping
onto the bandwagon.  Or everyone will forget about it until the next CWP event,
when it will all go around in circles all over again.  :)
    This is unfortunately my last public response to this issue.  If anyone is
seriously compelled to ask more, then please do it privately.  As much as I love
this list and addressing issues on it, I am much to busy and am limited in the
amount of time I can dedicate to it.  So I will reply to private posts you as I
find the time.  Thank you for your understanding. And as always:

Keep it Real

Yours in PLUR, Vlad aka Ray Vonie

A couple of thoughts:

in regards to whether cw represent "us" or not..."we" are rather
diverse and anarchic so I dont see how Anyone can really represent
"Us"

burning man, Food not bombs, critical mass,and many
others...none of these represent me..yet i support
their fights for freedom.

they have all suffered the same harassment that CW and raves
in general have suffered. Even though none of these groups
represent me i still feel that the harasment they got/get
has to stop. In politics there are coalitions that even
tho they have different agendas they often come together
to support each other on common issues...even tho they
disagree with each other.

A second thought.... $4.5 mil is pocket change in the world
of high finance and government.

ps...i am not defending cw as a group... i dont know them and
they may be the slimy sleaze some of you say they are.
I am not qualified to make that judgement... i just know
the got treated illegally and unfairly and i dont like that.

 I say its time for a tEa party...now what kind of tea should
we have =)

i didn't think it was lame...i was thinking the same thing.  as a matter of
fact, i had to pull the record from my crate to remember where the sample
actually came from.  which record, that is.  (cevin fischer, "the way we
used to" in case you were wondering.)   :)

Jazz-E's recent post on the musical diversity of the dance scene got me
wonderin'.  Are there any DJ's that spin house, jungle, techno, trance all
in one set or combination thereof?  As each tunes into a different
frequency in my movement, I'd love to tune into all my frequencies, if ya
get my drift.  WHy do DJ's stick to one style?  I'm sure there's ways
around the different bpms.  Actually, I can hear a couple already.

Anyways, the day a dj can take me on a musical journey of epic proportions
spanning the gamut of dance music I will stop...  My book of matches will
explode and ignite spontaneously in a moment of shear exstacy and my
existence will be snuffed out.  That's a like water for chocolate
reference, if any of you caught that.

Peace, have a great and safe weekend, I'm off to Tahoe to interview for
snow bum jobs, so take care in the bay.

George

Please say it isn't so

If my opinion counts in anyway I would like to vote for Happy kids to be
in SF.
It is much easier for me (one of those without a car) to get to.

I haven't been to a rave in almost a month, the one I got ot on HALLOWEEN 
BETTER BE GREAT.  I am by myself, lonely and bored.  So like many others 
I turned to SFR for warm fuzzy feelings & ALAS I WAS rewarded with what I 
seeked for, but all my mail has been read and no more post are to be 
found.

I was just wondering out of my cats' curiosity...who are the youngest 
people on the list?  15,(<--thats patrice), 17(<--thats me) 

Teresa  

***can you tell I am bored and there is no one to talk to, if there was I 
would spam my head off to them about every little thing that I ever 
thought, did and want to do.***

ohhhh, you may be full of youthful cells, but let me assure you, my 28 years
is compacted to the point that I act 14 most of the time.

therefore, I am the youngest.

aaahh..  i hate boredom as well teresa.  sometimes i couldn't stand it
 so mentally i jump myself off bridges.  enough madness from me. 

one way i discover as a boredom killer on the internet is to download
this program called ICQ from site http://www.mirabilis.com/ and have
close friends around doing the same thing.  it will inform you of when
participants are online to send back and forth quick messages, and my
favorite, open a live chat session sans long distance charge. 
everyone too, try it out when you get a chance.  

there are a lot of cool parties next halloween friday guys and gals
but we can only be at one place  :[.  here are clues and reasons to
which one i'll be at:  it's no MysterE that i like Mars.  i'm such a
Happy Kidz.  DJ Lyra is a cool senorita ...  see some of U's there
beautiful people.

SO this is my thoughts on the matter...If a person is 20
in the year 2000  then they would be 0 years in the year 
1980 and if you keep going backwards say to the year 1960
they would be negative 20 years. So if this liftime
is my future lives past life then i am actually minus
36 years old so i am much younger than 14...at least
thats how the foolish fish sees it.

While the folks over at Hormel (The makers of SPAM) have my 
sympathy, I say SPAM Stays!

	There are just too many similarities between the canned variety and 
it's email cousin to name it anything else. 
For example...
Both can be highly offensive to the senses.
Both can give you a terrible stomach ache just by looking at them.
Both  are dispised by normal human beings (yes, vegitarians dispise 
it too).
Both seem to continue to exist dispite their lack of popularity.
Both should be thrown in the trash before you open them....

Yep... No matter how much we try and fight it... destroy it... 
discourage it...  or ignore it...  Spam stays.

-Faro

(Of course, most of us knew all along that all that stuff we find in 
Spam was just a big Scam. :-}

I remeber this place, it's were I went to my first rave, I was 16, my 
friend Mona and her boy friend came to pick me up, I snuck out on the 
fire escape and off we were, I never thought here I would be 5 years 
later, still attending these things, seeing what it's all about, 
wondering if it's just a party or something more(PLZ PLZ PLZ, no long on 
going threads about this I already know some of you think one way some 
the other, or little of both). Ah love that stroll down memory lane..... 
if any of you are wondering I never got caught (for sneaking out)... and 
later found out it was because my step parents didn't think they could 
prevent me from going anyway *B^) ah I love life!

Not so long ago,ID W made the lovely statement:
<< it was an  environment where you could talk to people w/o having that same
club  type expectation of automagicly thinking that anybody who talked to you

 was tring to pick up on you, or any body you talk to thinks that you are
 tring to pick up on them!!! >>

I'd have to say Yes, you are correct.  :o)  Since I began raving, I've always
been asked what it is (as I'm sure we all have over and over. . .) and what I
tell people is to take the pretty lasers and lights and decorations of a
club, some of the big BASSy music (I know, it's not the same, but to people
that have never heard it, club music is the closest they can get to
understanding me) and then fill the place with all your best freinds in the
world and you have a rave (yea, it's an ideal perfect vibe rave, but, hell,
it's happened, no reason it can't keep happening).  The attitude is one that
defies the idea of a nasty ole' meat market or catwalk (again, I'm focusing
on the good raves, not the $$$-raves).  Instead, people can just walk up to
one another and give hugs without feeling awkward or have ideas about hitting
on each other.  Point of fact, my first rave, as soon as I stepped into the
circle (Plasti/< '95) some girl I'd never met walked up to me and my friend
Janis and gave us each a big, happy, glittery, plurry hug.  I just stood
there and couldn't help but fall in love with the idea of hugging random
people.  Now, I wish I could do that everywhere, but it usually only works
best at raves or amongst good company.  :o)

Anyhow, that's my  for t'day.

LuV -N- BiG HuGZ,
~^V^~PhoeniX~^V^~

P.S. if anyone wants some free hugs, find me at Happy Kidz on Friday.  Just
look for the laminates hangin from me  :o)
P.P.S. For more info on what people think raving is, check out my far from
finished website on raving.  Gimme suggestions (esp. for things to put on the
Vibe page, I'm kinda stuck as to what exactly to say, I think I've been too
long without a bunch of good events)

Lotsa blinky fun stuff and candy and stickers in a catalogue that sells
wholesale called Oriental Trading.  A long time ago, it was a boring lil
catalogue with a bunch of cheapy toys that people bought they're kids at
7-11, but they've grown quite a bit since then and have tons of /<ewl stuff.
 I've got a few copies of it if anyone wants to borrow just call.

Maybe easier for you, but really tough for Jeremy and I (I'm picking him up
in Monterey).  I don't wanna do the big long 3 hour drive thing (hour to pick
him up, 2 more to get to SF).  I'd say go for San Jose cause it's nice and
centered for all the kidz up north and down south and we've got plenty of
ways to get here that are nice and speedy.  For those without a car, let the
list know.  I'm sure there are enough wonderfully helpful people here that
would give rides.  C'mon all, let's chip in and help each other out here.


Oh hey, a lil request.  Um, my mom has expressed a desire to pop her head
into one of our lil "rave-things" and I was wondering what you all thought
would be a good rave to do this at sometime around December.  I'm kinda
hesitant to bring her now 'cause we haven't exactly been "getting along" too
well.  But I'm sure things'll be all better by then.

I'm thinkin' something small would probably be best 'casue I wanna make sure
the vibe is right and she won't feel weird being there (and yes, she has
agreed to stay the entire night/morning, a shocking first for my mommy).

G-d, I do love these threads sometimes.  I think you're right Devil (esp.
if you're going back years which is what I'm going to do):

Anybody remember the numerous parties in the Flop House (for those who
don;t know this was an all night event far before CWP was a thought), like
Piggly Wiggly?  How about Felix which is now FTT?  How about WAX, Vortex,
Toon Town, Five Foot Tongue, Don't Sit On The Furniture, Eklypz, Rave
Called Sharon, there are soo many, like the X-Men...literally hundreds of
parties, what about the old sacto parties thrown by Miguel, Scott, & Gina ,
what about....

Oh, those were the days.

there's some cool art goin on in the city, if yer into that kinda
stuff...  i recommend going to the yerba buena gardens (on mission,
somewhere around 3rd or 5th) smoke a spliff in the park while enjoying
the killer view (be discreet and this should be hassle free, though
obviously i can't guarantee that) then go into the gallery and check
out the exhibits, there's some really strange stuff there now...

I just heard about the million womens march( although it seems

I was thinking that it might be nice to have a million ravers
march.

hmmm...i guess we need something to protest...ummm
how about the high price of glowsticks?

A milliom glitter covered ravers with glowsticks marching
dowm market st following a mobile sound system( didnt
someone say they have a van for sale?)

What do you think? Should we do it?

Also did anyone hear about that cannibas contest? It was a 
gathering to test and determine the best canninbis.
Unfortunately by the end...the judges were in no condition
to give their decision so we will have to wait till tommorrow
for the results =(

how about protesting the fact that you can't dance after 2am in SF without
a permit? (or was that a rumor that's embedded in myhead?)
we could all join together at 2:01 am and dance our asses off in the
middle of market street.
sober.

I find these "jokes" very insulting. These jokes describe a very small
fraction of the rave community: the hippies who only go to raves, because
Jerry is dead, and they need a new place to take drugs, and pretend to have
PLUR. God, I miss the old days when ravers went to raves, and deadheads
went to Dead shows.

OK we have two...all we need is 999,998 more ravers .

So far we have two contingents:
1) glowsticks cost to much
2) the right to dance after 2am

you can join one of these or start your own.

i guess we need some dj's so send in your tapes
and please include your experience at spinning
while riding down the steet on a moving vehicle.
We dont want you to fall off cause that could really
mess up the beat.

How about doing it on independence day and we will
get all the producers to come together and have
one huge rave in crissy field at the end of the march.

so who else will come march with us...or is it going
to just be me and lara?

You know... I know some pretty awesome people who are much more than their
identities as raver/deadheads who have been going to "raves" well before
the "good ole days".  Generalizing can get a bit silly.

The fish 
had a wish
for a new scam
to replace spam

But proponents of spam
said we do not like your scam

we would not like it in a box
nor would we like it with a fox

we would not like it with a vase
we would not like it at homebase

we dont want it with tea
or even with E

we dont want it at 420 
for we have had plenty

this is sfrave
so behave

get back on topic
or we will beat you with a glowstick

you should talk about plur
and things with fuzzy fur

your plan is dumb
and you are a scum
so take your scam
and scram...

they said.
so with bowed head

and a tear in his eye
the fish said goodbye

Until another day
i will swim in the bay

But i will be back 
with another trick in my sack

MarQ,
Welcome to the sfraves scene.  Well, I can tell you this, the line up is
awsome, and you will meet a lot of people from sfraves.  True, it is a massive,

You mean like posting a joke that lumps all ravers together with people
who, except for a few who you know, and one or two who I know, are relative
newcomers to raving, and who make up a tiny part of the scene?

Nope, never been a punk rocker. Although I did see the Dead Kennedys play
live back around '82 or so. By the time 924 Gilman opened up in about '86 I
was into NewRo, Techno Pop, and other precursors to rave music. There are
quite a few former punx in the rave scene though, but I'm not gonna out any
of them.

New?  I know of one particular individual who has been throwing some
kickin' parties for at least 8 years and.... some of them were at Dead
shows...  and I would not go so far as to limit the amount of
raver/deadheads to a few... there are quite a "few"... and they have been
shakin' their rumps long enough not to have any left.

I was wondering if anyone knew of someone who would part with a few Rolling
Stones Tickets for November 14.  This is very importrant to me as this is
my girlfriends favorite band and this also just happens to be her birthday.
 I am VERY desperate for these tickets.

Thanks,

My what a cute little hippy dippy screen name. What's the matter don't have
the guts to use your real name. Who the fuck are you to tell me to have a
sense of humor. Anyway, I do. Just not when someone compares me, as one of
many ravers, to a hippy. (Some of thoose were old deadhead jokes with
deadhead taken out and raver put in.) Anybody calls me hippy to my face
best hope they're bigger and meaner than me.

I would like to take this moment to mix a thread or two (and make some twine,
it's much stronger, tee hee).

Great idea (if this isn't a rumor unlike San Diego where there actually is a
new curfew much worse than this).  But We can't just all listen to Jungle
there.  Otherwise it'll be nothing but junglists going.  We've been talking
about the good ole days with all the mix, so what's wrong with bringing that

 Mr.Standish,
  judging from your responce to karma, YOU DO need to lighten up.
  thinly veiled threats are not the way to accomplish anything .
  your responce was that of a child, or a bully, and frankly I, and others on
this list,
  could do without it.

  Yes. I have made the decision to be sober at *most* of the parties and
concerts that I attend, because it's so much more FUN. To me. Do your drugs
at the most boring part of the day, not the most exciting.

WEll.. so a little pre-halloween cheer.  With everyone home saving money for
next weekend we had a nice small crowd.  A.K.A. LESS HOMIE G's.  Lotsa housy
funky stuff, with a different set-up for the T room.   They used the back
room as the entrance and let me just tell you, it feels a lot more spaced out
and natural that way.  OR it could have been that there was hardly anyone
there and lots of space to move around.  when we got in Melanie (??) was
spinning and she is so cute bouncing around to her little housy toons.  Other
DJs followed and I pretty much lost track, but I remembered enjoying
Essence's set.  
THe room down the ramp had some sound system trouble.  At first the music was
too loud and then the whole thing just shut down.  Needless to say, the only
time I went down there was to use the porta potties.  
Mostly it was just a kick-back evening to see everyone and dance.  I was
actually awake for once, but had to go on a quest with Victoria to find
energizers.  Very peaceful.  NOt an intense vibe, but no where near a bad
one.  Too much money for this party, tho..  Hi to Matt, Steve, Steve,
Victoria, Paul (I FINALLY PARTIED WITH YOU) Joey, Dale, Lisa and Kelly From
area 51, Rob, Jive, Autumn, people people and more people =)  See you all
next weekend!

Amen- I agree wholeheartedly.  I go to ucsc, and I threw a party on campus
( drew 200-250 ) where we started off with funky breaks(dj tripp)... then
trance(webster)...then house..then jungle(trident)...then hard
techno(silence)..then I spun techno..into breaks..into house...outw/robert
miles.  fun mix of good beats. Personally my favorite way 2 go.

Subject: Exotic Erotic review & A Reality Check
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

    Last night Jeannie and I went to the Exotic Erotic Ball.  Well, All
I Can say was that most of you on this list who complain about how much
stuff is at the parties (admission, water, parking, security,
location...etc)  You all really need to attend an event like this for a
good reality check.
    Admission was like $60 a ticket, and they sold it out.. with a line
of 4000 people still trying to get in.   It was packed, crammed, loud,
and the entertainment SUCKED.  The band Downstairs were ... Interesting,
and the dj upstairs sounded like he was playing a tape.  I noticed that
many of the people were having a good time, and everyone seemed like
they were enjoying themselves.. probably cause they didn't  know any
better...no points of better reference.
    Water was $3 a bottle, parking across the street was $15 a car (and
yes it was filled up).
The security could not have been any ruder if they tried, and there were
more cops inside than I've seen at a policeman's ball, and I mean real
cops, not just the people in costumes :)
    As far as the costumes go... there wasn't much that I have not seen
at most raves that I have been to.   And to top it off,  the Fire
marshal shut the party down at 11:30 because there were too many people
inside, and the event got closed down at midnight.  We had VIP passes
(HELL YES, I would never pay good money for this shit, Its the only
reason i went) and couldn't even get back in after going out to the car
to drop of our costumes Because the AC inside was not on and it was way
hot and crowded.  So we bolted and went to the Sound factory for the
after party... Well I guess the sound factory was ahead of the game,
cause they Cut of the guest list (which made it extremely difficult for
us to get in) and were charging $30 admission.. YES THIRTY BUCKS... and
this was at 1 am... oh and did I mention that there was a line around
the corner to get in, like 1000 people long!!!! and not much parking
within a 2 mile radius :)  And once we finally got inside, after dealing
with the HELLA rude doorman (shit this place has changed a lot since the
good old days when I was working with there) it was a mad house... nasty
people every where.. all trying to get ugly with you around every
corner, and the bathrooms... DAMM ... I've seen cleaner port-o-poties
after a massive.  It took 15 minuets to get through one hallway... I
thought that the place was going to spontaneously combust from all the
heat and pressure.  Well we bailed that place real quick, and headed
home, for some rest.
    Any ways... my point is that many of you complain about parties and
massive with incredible productions and entertainment costing like $20..
or whatever.  Well I think that those of you that have any sort of
complaints with what raves and massive cost in relation to what you
get... well you all need a reality check by going to a non rave event
like this to readjust your understanding of how good you really have it,
and how fortunate you really are.  Cause from what i've seen in clubs,
and other special event s like the last night... gives me even more
reason to love our scene, and APPRECIATE every party I can get to...
Cause its a mad world out there.

Keep it Real

        Well if you are going to be over in that general area. Why don't you 
jump up to holland for a week or two and check out Amsterdam. Remember that was 
where raves were orginally started.

Hey there kids...
Just thought I'd wrap up the weekend with a little suggestion for anyone
who has ever liked Bjork - even the teensiest bit.
Got her new CD (Homogenic) today and I am truly impressed.  Girl got her
sound together and has really turned out a nice one.  Lots of groovy
rhythms and, of course, those Bjorky vocals.  Who could live without her
mousy little self?  She seems to have grown up a bit and her sound is much
more polished.  Even the art work is impressive.  All around a very nice
production.  Definately worth checking out.  And if you hurry, you can get
it on sale at Tower for $12.99.  Don't ya just love a bargain!?!
Night now,
Megan

hey kids, i am so down to dance on Market or anywhere else you all have
thought of.  i agree we need to have lots of music, to bring the masses and
keep the flow going.  is there a purpose to this dancing for any other
reason than to celebrate life?  do we really think that a million (or one
hundred) ravers will dance on Market?  let us talk this up, build
excitement and pull it together.

change anything if it did . Unfortunatley rave utopia doent exist, utopia

will be questioning kids at parties as well, but i believe  i wil get a
different reply from people on the computer and probably not high.  so,
what do you think?  put in the subject line eeneR. here goes....
1.  what is your self identified gender? (do you think you are a boy or a girl?)
2.  is it the same as your sex?  ( do you have a penis or a vagina?)
3.  if you were to fit in one of western culture's sexual identities, what
would you be labeled as?  (are you straight{their word} or gay?)
4.  How would you label yourself?
5.  do you feel free to express your sexual identity in the  mainstream culture?
6.  do you feel the rave culture is accepting of your sexual identity?
7.  do you feel accepted by mainstream society?
8.  how does the rave culture &/or mainstream society  influence your
persona or decisions?  (but does this really matter?  no, i personally do
not feel that either one of these aspects of my life make me, but it is
human to be influenced by our surroundings.  did nature make nurture or
nurture make nature? anyway)
9.  does the sex of the individual you are having sex with matter to you?
10.  if it did not matter who you had sex with or how you did it, do you
think that sex would be better?
11.  commentary

thank you all so much.  i will process all the info i get and put it
online.  and you will all get my thanks when i win the nobel peace prize
for joining the whole planet together in complete harmony;-)  peace.
love,
'eeneR

We DON'T need a reason, all five hundred people on this list should just be
able to get up, go down to Market St., and go nuts. For fun. I know NOTHING
about putting things like this together....and, well, basically I know
nothing.

sure...we are going to tap into the pg&e grid and send techo
music down every single electrical wire in the city.
All the lights, tv's, anything plugged in are going to pulse
to the beat of techno and this will entrain everyones
brain waves so that they feel exstatic love and an uncontrollable
desire to dance in the street...the whole city will be dancing.
this weeks test at a pg&e substation went great.

I dunno... if they can do it in Berlin (1 million + at the Love Parade), it
could probably be done here.  There's certainly plenty of other rather
interesting parades on Market street from time to time.

If these are insulting, then all jokes are insulting...
  "what did the farmer say when he lost his tractor?"

  "where's my tractor?"
I just pray that the farmers of the US don't get too upset for this one.  
Just laugh.  They aren't said to offend people.

And hippies kick butt.  When you think about it, ravers go to raves for 
the same reasons that "dead heads"  went to Dead shows.  Heaven forbid 
the two collide.

He he, this is going to be fun.(errr!)  I would actually prefer to be a 
hippie over a raver.  I feel that Mr Standish must have gotten into some 
sort of trouble with a hippie in his past life.  This whole thing is 
rediculous.  Try being open, accepting, and forgiving of those people 
that you don't know.  No point in becoming enemies with generalizations 
or stereotypes.  
*classic rock will always be my first love*

P.S.
 just a side note...peace to all, and to all a good night

Its silly
says ms bea

It could not be...
But i think you will see
that it could
and it should.

It might happen in the rain
with djs on the train

It might happen in the sun
which would really be fun

It might happen with faces of glitter
as we pick up market streets litter.

We will have our silly dance
if you just give us a chance

You may even like it
and contribute a bit

canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song
that has never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see
a laboratory on wheels.

We make tools for these kind of people, because while some
see them as crazy ones, we see them as genius.

And its the people who are crazy enough to think 
they can change the world, who actually do.

Hi,

I'd like to introduce myself: I'm a 24 year old partyperson back here in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Europe. I've been on this list for a while now,
lurking, because I'm applying for a visa to live in the US permanently. And,
I just received news that it is working out! It's really going to happen!
(still can't believe it myself..). So that means I'm moving to San Francisco
in january. Now, here in Amsterdam we have a lot of good partying (although
apparently kind of hard to get into if you're an overseas visitor), and of
course I've been on this list to figure out what the scene is about out
there. So if I ask dumb questions on this list, please consider I'm an
ignorant european.. Oh: and I'm still in the market for a job as a web
developer, any help is appreciated!

later,
Wessel

i have to say i attended my 2nd and LAST "rave-you-have-to-pay-for" in
oakland this weekend.  

i saw many things that were thorougghly embarassing for techno enthusiasts
and honest ravers that i refuse to show support for ever again.

lets just say the incident that infuriated me the most was the blatant
mysogeny taking place at what seemed to be an event set up to show that
there were some slick women dj's out there too.  

I guess it wouldnt have been so bad if the white fat soul-free fuck that
played right before heather heart went on for hours on
end with his white soul-free trash pop funk free 'techno' or should i
say electronica breaks and  ate up all of heather's
set, then turned the decks over to his homee with the squeaky voice who
not until getting screamed at by some angry militant ravers for his
blatent show of hatred towards women, gave the decks over to the guest.

i believe that showing of mysogeny was solely because "the boys" couldnt
get over the fact that the women
dj's there were of much higher caliber than they could ever be,, even
after their many many many years of "representing" the san francisco
scene.

in the words of one of the dj's that was among the many many distressing
over the fact that one of her idols was getting dicked over by some dumb
boy behavior "It looks like the boys have taken over"

Im terribly disappointed.  

i am in shock from this scene of massive disrespect to women, to djs from
other towns, djs who present
music with soul, people who project themselves...

:(

(on top of all this the doorman threw out my $8 of sealed water
bottles for me and my
friends, (hence i had to spend another $8 on the exact same water
bottles INSIDE) and the sound
sucked... ie: people talking was louder than the music in the main room.)
man, ive seen better sound at $1 and a can of food parties.

see you next summer ive had enough of this crap for a while

please dont let "the boys" take over techno...

for the many of you who have not heard of the spiraltribe  or know less
than 1k of info about them, i highly highly recommend reading the section
in "Altered State" about the nomadic techno tribes (ie spiraltribe) its
like 3 chapters of wicked engaging material :) it also gives a good
background as to why "ravers" in the states are refered to as lightweights
;)

the rest of the book is good historically but talks about clubbing and
stuff way too much, although it definitely clears up the picture about how
techno started off

rage on

(my response:)
have you ever asked a 'hippie' why (s)he's at a rave? the above statement
from mr standish seems to me to be really 'un-PLURalistic'... i'm not fond
of all this advertising your plur anyway (if you are 'plurry', then why
feel the need to plaster it all over the place?), but god. to tell one type
of person that they have no bsns being at a rave is a bit exclusive. my
first rave: 1990. my first dead show: c.1983. what does that make me?
instead of looking at the difference, why don't you look at the
similarities? have you ever really listened to mickey hart? his drums would
put most d&b djs to shame.

anyway, i'd hate to think that there are little ravers running around
saying that i have no bsns being at a rave because i happen to like the
dead as well. especially when i was going to raves when some were still in
elementary school. there really are quite a few similarities btwn the two -
i suspect that you haven't been to a show otherwise you wouldn't be saying
such things. no dead head ever told me to leave because i dressed in black
- i was welcomed with open arms, the same way i entered raving. if you
close the world out because it's different, it might just do the same to
you. probably will.

off to work - if you've got something to say to me, reply personally 'coz i
just might delete the digest tonight.

And ganging up on the odd man out is PLURy? Look at this thread a little
more closely, and you will find very little PLUR from anyone except Moshe
and Larry. Yeah I was mean in a private reply to a private email, but I am
by no means the only person wha has behaved meanly in this thread.

I never said that. I took offense to the generalizations in the converted
deadhead jokes. Many people who have jumped in to attack me seem to think
that those generalizations are OK, but that some that I may have made are
not. Even if I had said that, how would it be any different from the many
posts over the years where people say that "gangstas" don't belong?

>first rave: 1990. my first dead show: c.1983. what does that make me?

Nothing, you are who you are; unless you choose to define yourself that way.

12 step much?

Hart is damn good. So what? That doesn't make deadheads any more pleasant
to be around.

> there really are quite a few similarities btwn the two -

Yeah, pot, acid, E, booze, crank, junk, and fake PLUR.

That was not my experience. I went to a show once, looking like the
Mettalica fan that I was, and I got hella bad vibes. One guy said "Wow man
unmellow, like this isn't a metal show." No my friends I am not kidding, he
really said that.

I hope hippies do close me out. I have nothing to say to them.

Ah... I bow down to thou Spiral Tribe!  Thou Art so much Hardcore than
us lightweight american ravers!  We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!
I might be interested in checking out a Spiral Tribe party... but I
wonder if they would think they could learn anything from us american
ravers?  Or are we all just lightweights?

Bea, where is your trust in that which is silly and beautiful?  I have been
properly chagrined on asking for a reason to dance, I do not need a reason
to dance- anywhere, in line at Safeway, at work, on the bus.  Foolish Fish
mentioned picking up the trash while we dance, if everyone pitched in we
could really clean this place up.  I'm down, I need to get out and dance.
Let's have fun;-)

Good story, Vlad...

The main difference, I'd say, is that the Exotic/Erotic only happens
once a year...so paying $15 isn't all that cause you go all out. Kids
are goin to massives 10, 15, 20 times a year and it adds up, ya dig?

Anyhow, still a scary halloween story...I'm gonna tell it around the
campfire some night...

hey hey hey,

I completely feel ya there but please don't assume all massives are like this
and that it was all directed at the fact that heather heart is a girl DJ.

First of all.  If you do choose to go to a massive please choose very 
carefully.  I for one do not attend massives thrown by half of the crews
in this area.  mainly to avoid a night like the one you had. but there are
lots of other reasons as well.  Charging for water, Headliner DJ's not showing
up or if they do they usually don't get to spin their full set.  I could go 
on and on.

Second is that think that the DJ's in questions would act that way to any
DJ that they deemed unworthy of their "respect", male or female. 
The scene has definatly lost its sense of comraderie and belonging to
a special family of sorts.  It has just gotten too big.  With this comes 
competition which eats away at what makes a family feel like a family
It is also a sad
fact that the egos of DJ's, especially in this area, seem to be growing
exponentially. With this they lose something, like their heart, and their 
sight and focus of what is really important in their life and in the scene. 
It happens to all of us.  If we aren't careful we are destined to become what 
we at one time despised and fought against.  I don't think a lot of 
DJ's, when they first started out, thought that they would need an agent/manager
but as their popularity increased they felt it necessary. 

It does however fall back upon us.  How can we support a truly good DJ without
him/her becoming what we fear the most.  Granted a lot of the desire relies in 
the DJ whether or not to become a supastar, but we are the critics, fans, and
supporters. A lot of people need constant reminders so they don't lose sight and
focus and that is our responsiblity.

If you don't like a certain DJ or crew for whatever reason don't go to that 
party. Don't support them and get your friends to not support them either.

Anyways if you really think about it though.  We are all just people trying to
make a mark / or leave a mark in this weird thing we call society so can you
really blame them for trying ?

I dont' know, but all I really know is that I don't know.

don't keep it real .. just be true to yourself and what you believe in.

Well, 

Since Megan doesn't have a job at Tower (at least not that is obvious),
doesn't seem like a self-interested move. But anyway.....

Another Interesting tidbit of info:

The album is produced in part by LFO (Low Frequency Organization) member who,
if y'all remember them (Warp records, etc.), was an old skooler techno track master....

FYI only,

rob.

Hey SFraver people.

I just want to know one thing.. 

Is the name DJ DOS already in use? Or do I have dibs on that DJ name?



If it's not used.
Wouldn't this picture make a nice cover for my first mix tape?



Thanx for the info nStuff. In advance.
Jeff (DJ DOS)

ok, so friday night i *thought* was going out to dinner with my 
roomates and a couple of other selected people in honor of my 
birthday (which was thurs) and lo and behold, i'm walking in to the 
restaurant and there's like all 12 of my friends sitting there.  a 
conspiracy!  but a pleasant one.  i really wasn't expecting much, no 
one really does when they turn 20, because it's like "*sigh* another 
year ...." but this has been one of my best birthdays ever.  and it 
is because i reflected on my life and realized that i am one of the 
luckiest people because i have so many rad friends.  true friends.  
friends who are there to listen to me bitch, whine, tell jokes, cry, 
laugh, etc.   i love you molly and yuko, thank you for making my 
birthday... no, my LIFE that much better and brighter.  :-)

     Greetings Vlad,
     
     Welp, 99% of the time I agree with your comments about the "scene" and 
     the price issue that comes to our list every now and then. However, 
     when you insist that some of us need a reality check, I disagree.
     
     Now, I understand that for a "massive" to take place, it take moolah 
     up front, alot of moolah. You need a return on your investment. Most 
     of the time, you can barley break even. Understood. There is a need 
     for high entrance prices. Big name talent, cool location, security. 
     
     Where I disagree: In your note(No offense please, just my opinion), it 
     sounds like you feel that we as partygoers should feel lucky that we 
     have it so good... I will not feel lucky that I have to pay 30 dollars 
     to enter a party. Especially when I pay the high fee, and in order to 
     save me money, bring my own water, which I must discard when I 
     approach the gate. That's not lucky! It's something we have to deal 
     with in order to enjoy the party. I believe it's unfortunate. I don't 
     think the 3 dollars I spent at 7-11 rather the party, will kill a 
     margin you are trying to hit. I've been to many UG's where they had 
     plenty of free stuff! Free Water, Free Fruit... Free afterparties!!
     
     I do feel lucky that these parties are available to the masses, 
     however I believe YOU SHOULD FEEL LUCKY that you have a market out 
     there, that is willing to pay the 30 bucks.
     
     I do agree with your remarks about the exotic erotic, and the club 
     scene. However I choose not to compare our scene to the club scene. 
     That's why I rave... Clubs are a JOKE! 
     
     The "you should feel lucky" remark rubbed me the wrong way first thing 
     Monday morning... But hey, nothin but love for ya babay!
     
     Keep the Peace! <JCO>

    Last night Jeannie and I went to the Exotic Erotic Ball.  Well, All
I Can say was that most of you on this list who complain about how much 
stuff is at the parties (admission, water, parking, security, 
location...etc)  You all really need to attend an event like this for a 
good reality check.
    Admission was like $60 a ticket, and they sold it out.. with a line
of 4000 people still trying to get in.   It was packed, crammed, loud, 
and the entertainment SUCKED.  The band Downstairs were ... Interesting, 
and the dj upstairs sounded like he was playing a tape.  I noticed that 
many of the people were having a good time, and everyone seemed like they 
were enjoying themselves.. probably cause they didn't  know any 
better...no points of better reference.
    Water was $3 a bottle, parking across the street was $15 a car (and
yes it was filled up).
The security could not have been any ruder if they tried, and there were 
more cops inside than I've seen at a policeman's ball, and I mean real 
cops, not just the people in costumes :)
    As far as the costumes go... there wasn't much that I have not seen
at most raves that I have been to.   And to top it off,  the Fire 
marshal shut the party down at 11:30 because there were too many people 
inside, and the event got closed down at midnight.  We had VIP passes 
(HELL YES, I would never pay good money for this shit, Its the only 
reason i went) and couldn't even get back in after going out to the car 
to drop of our costumes Because the AC inside was not on and it was way 
hot and crowded.  So we bolted and went to the Sound factory for the 
after party... Well I guess the sound factory was ahead of the game, 
cause they Cut of the guest list (which made it extremely difficult for 
us to get in) and were charging $30 admission.. YES THIRTY BUCKS... and 
this was at 1 am... oh and did I mention that there was a line around 
the corner to get in, like 1000 people long!!!! and not much parking 
within a 2 mile radius :)  And once we finally got inside, after dealing 
with the HELLA rude doorman (shit this place has changed a lot since the 
good old days when I was working with there) it was a mad house... nasty 
people every where.. all trying to get ugly with you around every 
corner, and the bathrooms... DAMM ... I've seen cleaner port-o-poties 
after a massive.  It took 15 minuets to get through one hallway... I 
thought that the place was going to spontaneously combust from all the 
heat and pressure.  Well we bailed that place real quick, and headed 
home, for some rest.
    Any ways... my point is that many of you complain about parties and
massive with incredible productions and entertainment costing like $20.. 
or whatever.  Well I think that those of you that have any sort of 
complaints with what raves and massive cost in relation to what you 
get... well you all need a reality check by going to a non rave event 
like this to readjust your understanding of how good you really have it, 
and how fortunate you really are.  Cause from what i've seen in clubs, 
and other special event s like the last night... gives me even more 
reason to love our scene, and APPRECIATE every party I can get to... 
Cause its a mad world out there.
     
Keep it Real
     
Vlad aka Ray Vonie

i went last year...
i had just moved into the sf area from the east coast... and let me tell
you- i was SHOCKED! never seen anything like it before! all the nudity,
leather, exotic outfits... things i'd only seen in lingerie magazines! 
i actually kind of liked it... it was nice to see people so free and
comfortable with their bodies... after all it was an EXOTIC EROTIC ball-
what else is to be expected?
(it's funny how after only a year in the city... i've already become
accustom to this sort of thing... i even found the folsom street fair a bit
tame!)
what i didn't like (at the Exotic Erotic ball) were the people/tourists
that were there in normal clothing taking videos and pictures of every
exposed butt, breast, and penis... and NOT participating... it was as if
they were invading this scene for the pornographic value and not the other
natural side of the human body... but i guess there are two sides to
everything and who am i to judge?  just because i chose to see it one way
doesn't necessarily mean that the other way is wrong... but i have to
admit, as a participant, i did at times feel uncomfortable around some of
the voyeurs... almost exploited.  and it was a bit unsettling being in the
company of completely nude people with only face masks on, sitting in the
corner, (for lack of a more polite term) literally masturbating in public! 
at a function like this... celebrating sexuality... is there any limit or
standard to what is and isn't acceptable?
well, i chose not go this year...

I've been pretty busy lately so it's rare that I share anything with the
list anymore (save for my BSPs, sorry) but I had to share this bit of
weirdness...
So Garth was DJing down at the Shack last Saturday and if you haven't
seen him lately he's sans dreads, in fact he had some straw hat on. 
Anyway, the place was electric, the guy was dropping hard breakbeat
(seriously) and everything else under the sun and smilin' and bobbin' up
and down the whole time! And for the first time in a a long while I just
smiled and thought, "Yep, this is how it's sposed to be." (note: not how
it used to be) Even stranger... Pauly Shore (sp?) right in front of
Garth w/ his hands in the air just screaming and smiling and just behind
him Morris Day gettin' down a la James Brown.  Weird huh? Anyway,
Garth's still got it, that's for sure.

Hey,

Y'all remember DJ Digit from BPM (3rd Floor productions)?

Now that was a cool name...

rob.
http://www.citizenmag.com

p.s. I used to live for that radio show they did on KMEL (The Underground from
1 a.m. to 4 a.m.) w/ hosh and the rest of the crew.
I worked graveyards so I would tape the show and listen to it over and over
again. It's where I first heard stella, 2 bad mice's bombscare, zoogie, rabbit
city, all those FUNK rave records.

*memories....all alone in the moonlight.....*

I see what you mean, and I understand where you are coming from.  It sounds like
your saying... "I don't have to feel lucky about anything, cause I'm paying for what
I'm getting"  Which in my opinion sounds like a very valid statement.  Cause it's
the truth!!  My whole thing, was that I hear people say that 20 bucks is too much to
pay for.... Blah... Blah... Blah... etc.  My point is that I was astonished at how
much people were paying for what little they were receiving back at the exotic
ball.  In my opinion (form a price vs. entertainment evaluation)  it was a total
rip-off.  a $50 advance / $60 door cover charge people should have gotten a lot more
than they did.  AND the parody of it all is that they were all happy... like they
didn't know they were getting gouged.    They were getting screwed and they were
loving it.  That's the reality check i'm talking about.   And on top if it all,
there were less people in costume then there were perverts with cameras.   I guess
the bottom line was that I was left flabbergasted after seeing how badly people were
taken for their cash.  I guess I just have high standards of what is fun and what is
a wrong.  Because from a production value standpoint, what you get at a rave; with
visuals, lighting, lasers, sound and dj's and.... for only like $20 , and not to
mention that it runs for 10 hours, comes out to like $2/hour of fun.   And at the 5
hour exotic erotic with 2 small stages and very little production value, at
$10/hr... and that's before you add in the party favors, and accessories... it just
feels all wrong.

I think that we are ALL very lucky that even the most commercial of massive still
gives back 10 times more than a mainstream special event at a fraction of the cost.

I personally don't feel it's a silly idea if we direct it the right way.  I
was just reading about "RIGHT TO DANCE" In Lotus, and it seems like a very
informative thing to do, as long as it doesn't just involve, "Skipping down
market street."  We could definately do a great job of informing the masses.
 An SFR community information drive to let people know that raving isn't all
about drugs and getting in trouble.  Think pamphlets and speakers n such.

New Rane DJ Mixer info!

(only a geek could get stoked about this).

I don't know how much hype there has been about this, but it looks like
fun from here.  I'd wanted to buy a Rane for a while, but I always wanted
that seperate EQ per channel of the MP-22, and the 3-4 deck capability
(no, I'm not all that yet, maybe someday though...) of the MP-24 (plus all
four channels will take phono), and the VCA/active crossfader (read:
doesn't get scratchy) available on some ESOs and the new Intimidation
Apex.

Except for the fact that this mixer is UGLY as sin (well, at least it
matches my crossover now, which is also UGLY...), I think this will be a
welcome sight to plug your headphones into in the next coming months.

Peace,
AndyW

Rane Release Info is below...

taken from...

http://www.rane.com/mm8x.htm

MM 8x
                                 Mojo DJ Mixer
                                                                          
General Description

Combining the success of the Mojo Series with the MP 22 and MP 24 Mixers,
Rane proudly presents the MM 8x Mojo Mixer, the DJ's centerpiece. 

The MM 8x features eight stereo Inputs. Each of the four assignable buses
contains its own three band EQ, allowing separate equalization of
different sources. The four faders are grouped in two pairs, allowing a
custom mix of two input sources on each side of the crossfader.

The MM 8x incorporates new Active Crossfader technology that combines
state of the art voltage controlled amplifier design with a professional
studio quality, dual-rail crossfader control.  Combining Active Crossfader
technology with a removable crossfader, sets new standards for
performance, reliability and serviceability. Virtually all crossfader
noise is eliminated. Channel to channel crosstalk is greatly reduced and
the OFF isolation of the faded channel is greatly increased. Active
Crossfader technology dramatically increases the service life of the
crossfader. In the unlikely event of crossfader failure, there is no loss
of signal. If a crossfader should become rough or noisy, it is possible to
'hot swap' the control during a performance with no interruption of the
audio signal. Simply use the input faders to set the audio levels while
the crossfader is out of service.

Each of the four Phono (RIAA) Inputs switch to Line Level via rear panel
switches. 

Both the Main and Aux Mic Inputs route through Bass and Treble controls. 
The Main Mic input has an Effects Loop. The main program signal includes a
stereo Master Loop for equalization or processing.

The Tape Output can be switched to exclude the Master Loop signal and
record the unprocessed program signal. 

The MM 8x doesnt scrimp on its powerful Headphone Cueing system in which
one or more channels may be cued at one time.  The metering can be
switched to monitor stereo main output or mono cue on one side and mono
program on the other.

The MM 8xs recessed top mounted jacks provide room for cabling in tight DJ
coffins or racks without sacrificing its compact 4"  depth.

   Yeah, I successfully quit/resigned/gave up/hated/and left City 
Espresso  :)  Some advice to people who aren't enjoying their places of 
employment 
1)quit,  
2)do not think things will get any better especially if they haven't 
improved for the last six months 
3)Quit with a hot sword up your butt (don't just quit, make it 
interesting, you only live once)-very unethical, but everyone does 
it-bandwagon you know?  :P 
4)don't beleive anything that the Big Boss Man tells you, cuz they know 
that you can't stand to look at them.  
5)don't clean the toilet in which your mgr. recuperates on because that 
shit stinks and so do they, they should clean it. 
6)don't ask for a raise because you, and only you know you'll be leaving 
in a week anyways.  
7)Keep in touch with everyone that you helped out while you worked, for 
me it was the ravers and without that job, Ida never met anyofyou. 8)get 
a great job that you enjoy and use the 90 day probationary period to 
your advantage.  
    Well, there is my tangent of employment.  I'll still see everyone 
around, just not every single day of my life, i know that is the breaks 
but I got to clean the new mgr's. toilet now.  Take care everybody and 
we'll see you all goolish-like at Happy Kidz
Peace,
Danny
P.S.
Hopefully I'll be the guy dressed as an Umpa Lumpa from Willy Wonka and  
The Chocolate Factory, oooh and with a yummy chocolate
Slinky
o     
 o   
  o o0 o0
   0  O  o  Baruka Salt was a selfish bitch, wanting that golden egg and 
all-geeez, some people just don't learn  :)

P.P.S.  and the Blue moon will be in effect on Friday the 31st of 
October if you guys didn't know--should be a little trippy huh?

I do like the cabling setup on RANE mixers, but aside from that I've had 
really bad luck with them.  Every one I've used had a short in the 
headphone jack :/  Also, the cues are all of the push-button variety 
(Yeah, I've grown kinda used to teh good old rotary style like on the 
Geminis or the "second crossfader" on the older Numarks)

I look forward to playing with the new RANE sometime, but I don't 
know...  I think I'll prolly stick with my Scratchmaster for a while 
longer :D :D :D :D  Talk about a booty mixer!  Oh well, at least it's not 
RadioShack... :D

Now who's generalizing? How dare you presume to say why I go to raves.
There are many reasons to rave. People rave for different combinations of
those reasons. Some times, as you say those reasons are similar to why
people go to dead shows, but not always. Nobody, at least for the last 20
to 25 years has gone to a dead show for the new fashions, or the new styles
of music. Do you mean to say that these reasons, which are paramount to me,
are unimportant?

>Heaven forbid

Fortunately for me they ussually colide at trance parties. And, as I am not
fond of trance, I miss most of the collision.

Damn.  Just trying to help some fellow ravers save a few bucks.  Guess I'll
keep  my bargain tips to myself next time.  Some people can be so
suspicious.

oh, and i wasn't going to get drawn into this again. oooops... i guess
changing to the digest format doesn't really change that much! *anyway*, i
must apologise. i caught this thread at this particular point and missed
all that came before. (effects of that digest thing). i didn't mean to
'gang up' - this, as i understand, requires more than one person. i'm just
one. this doesn't constitute a 'ganging up' - only a difference of opinion.
and once again, i can only hope that my expression of such might open a few
eyes.

again, i missed the initial part of the thread. but you're right - it would
be no different - putting individuals into stereotypes is disrespectful.

thing?)

okay, so i guess i confused your calling people deadheads with the music -
you like the music, you just don't like the people who like it? well, i
don't care for some ravers, either. but this doesn't mean that i don't care
for _all_ of them.... as in any group, there will be assholes and there
will be really beautiful people. it's up to you to seek out those who will
compliment your life. you could be missing out by prejudging a person by
the way they're dressed.....

not all of it is fake. yes, quite a bit of it. but i've met some really
wonderful people within both scenes - and that respect, for yourself as you
are, and for others as they are, is a lot of what brings them together. and
you know, they're both a *circus*, full of hedonistic freaks! how can you
not enjoy that??

once. yeah, i had a shitty experience at one show - meadowlands. :( but in
a way, the bad things that happened brought some ppl together.

and i read shakespeare once in 7th grade. at that point, i decided i hated
shakespeare.

i still don't see how you can generalize this way about an entire group of

awww yea.....gemini represent!  the only thing i enjoy about my
scratchmaster is the tall toggle switches  for cue in/out strategically
placed on the sides of the crossfader (pmx-15a, some dont have them) but
considering the broken headphone pan, no eq's, shitty crossfader, and the
pop/scratch in the main volume, channel volumes, transform toggles, and the
crossfader, I will probably have to invest in a new mixer soon.   btw  I
covered up the gemini scratchmaster logo on top with a sticker to help
myself forget what a piece I have, and it actually works sometimes!

Hey all of you DJ people out there.  Just wondering one thing about what
kinda setup I'm going to be buying in the next six months.  Should I get
a mixer with a sampler already built in or get like a three channel thing
and just put the sampler in the third channel with the the two decks in
the other?  Do you people like the mixers with samplers in them or not? 

I need some pros and cons since I've never used either method before.

Thanks in advance.

I didn't mean just you. There have been hella people acting all high and
mighty, and ripping on me at the same time. In so doing they were being
self righteous, and hypocritical, two things which I find all too common
among hippies.

Gawd no I can't stand GD music. I said Mickey is damn good; I didn't say
anything about his music. Perhaps I should have said 'Mickey is damn
talented.'

Given that I have a finite amount of time with which to seek out people who
I can connect with, I would have take time away from people with whom I
share similar tastes and interests, in order to spend time with hippies.
And, as a result I would be reducing the odds of my finding someone I
really click with.

I have had enough experience to be sure that deadheads are very judgmental
of others. I guess were just going to have to agree to disagree on this one.

So is a punk show, goth club, heavy metal concert, leather bar, Ren.

Believe me I've had enough contact with deadheads to get a statistically

No, it will be my gain, because I'll be spending time with people I have

Well, I can't imagine why you would want a sampler, but...

All the best mixers do not come with a sampler, so you would have to get a
less desirable mixer if you want a built in sampler.

When you go to play out, you will be using the mixer that the sound people
set up for everyone. If you buy a stand alone sampler, and show up before
the rave to hook it up, they'll let you plug it in. On the other hand if
you role up and want to unplug the Rane or Intimidation to plug in your
Numark or whatever sampling mixer, you're gonna get hella grief.

Now who's being mean, childish, and unreasonable? Why do you keep trying so
hard to be hurtful to me? I posted some calm and reasonable statements, and
a harmless question, yet you come back with cruel insults. You sir, are not
helping the image of hippies, and deadheads.

4-channel gemini with a 12-bit 12 sec sampler inside.. its ok.. but it 
would be better quality if he hada 16-bit chip... dont settle for 
anything less than 16-bit or less thn 8 sec sampling time..
thanks just my opinion.. peace

Just got this from the Junior Varsity mailing list.  I've seen a couple
of his in-store performances at Open Mind Music and Fasterbamboo.  An
interesting mix of ambient/experimental and drum n' bass that I'm
looking forward to finally hearing LOUD!

Hey guys. I know it's a bit early for this but I wanted to know if any of
you are going to see Jamiroquai on the 16th of November. Of course I am!
So I wanted to maybe hookup and have a pre-jamiroquai thing. If you're
interested, e-mail me!

Morning all you peoples out there,

I am not sure if you all know this but the bovine crew won RSA's 56-Bit 
encryption key contest and have moved onto the 64-Bit key.  You can help
out by donating all of your spare CPU cycles. It took them almost a year with
over 30,000 computers working together to find it so they are going to need
more help with the 64-Bit key.  You should check them out.  There is a prize
attached RSA gives the winner $10,000.  $1,000 goes to the bovine crew, $8,000
goes to these people who are publishing books on the web (well that is who got
it the last time I am not sure who will get it this time) and $1,000 goes to the
lucky person who actually found the key.  Its kinda like a bonus you know?

Anyways its very cool and it doesn't even require you to have a permanent 
connection to the net. It does however require your computer to run all of the
time.

Please check out www.distributed.net/rc5 for more info.  Then even have a cool
status page so you can see how you are doing versus the rest of the world.

enjoy your tuesday,

Herb

ok, first let me say i think danny is a sweetheart .... but a career
counselor for 10 years, i just have to spout some advice here...

truth is, the secret to being happy in your work is attitude.... and that
includes finding a job that you have fun doing, and finding a boss who you
like (and don't buy into this "the boss is out to get you" mentality cuz it
ain't usually that way)...

and especially that "quit with a hot sword up your butt" is scary, yikes!

it's way better not to burn the bridges if you can help it... everybody
wins that way and you still get the phat reference... and a sense of pride
in how well you handled yourself even when it wasn't easy....

and i should know, cuz i've done it both ways

Well, my very first mixer was a gemini with a hobbled little 
integrated sampler. It was really convenient, though, for just taking 
something quickly from the cue and being able to do sample "hits" with it.

The downsides of integrated mixer/samplers:

- trimming samples is either not supported or very difficult
- so-so sound quality (usually)
- limited sampling time (depending on what you want to do, this may not 
be an issue
- no storage (so all those wonderful samples die when you turn off the power)

The upside:
- cheap (this is the big one)
- unless the sampler is integrated, it's very tricky to be able to sample 
the "cue" channel. Most dj-oriented external samplers either sit between 
your mixer and your amplifier, or in the effects loop of your mixer (if 
your mixer's got one). As a result, unless you have a really fancy mixer 
(ie., the Vestax PMC-56 @ $1800, or use another multi-bus mixer like a 
Mackie 16*4 @ $1000), you will only be able to sample from your live mix (or 
record the samples before you start your live set). 

This is less than ideal: the crowd has to hear everything that you 
sample as you're sampling it!

So unless you are _very_ ambitious and have a lot of money to spare, and 
you're more interested in splicing in shorter samples (as opposed to doing 
sample loops, MIDI, or full-on production), I'd recommend an integrated 
sampler.

-radon

ps. if anyone is curious about setting up an external sampler with a 
multibus mixer, email me.

When: Saturday, Nov. 8, 1997, 9 p.m.
Where: The Lab, 2948 16th St. (at Capp)
How much: $10 to $15 sliding scale

23five =97 a nonprofit dedicated to the development and increased
awareness of sound works in the public arena and to the education of
artists working with sound =97 has recently acquired a facility in Potrer=

Hill. But, like sushi, it's raw. We have the equipment necessary to
operate a recording studio, but we gotta build it. And that takes $$$.

The new studio will give artists access to professional audio recording
equipment, facilitate the archiving of sound art recordings, serve as a
site for seminars and workshops, and produce recordings by young people.

YES... :) (I love this subject..)

The reason I love music so much is because it touches my soul and makes me
feel really good. The reason I love playing music for others is because
it's a great way to share this *magic*. I don't play what others want to hear,
I play what sounds good to me, and others who have similiar tastes will
enjoy my telegrams of love and emotion... this is what makes a true DJ
(in my opinion)... someone who plays what *he* wants others to hear.. not
what he thinks *they* want to hear... 

I don't think you can ever be true to yourself, the music or the listener 
if all you do is play what you think people want to hear... you have to
go deeeper than that, play what touches your heart and tickles your
soul... this is when the true connection is made between the musician, DJ and
 listener...

This is all you should think about when you think to yourself, "there are
so many DJs... ".. and you feel disenchanted to put the energy into
becoming a DJ. If you think this way (thinking that it's hopeless), you're
probably not in it for the right reason..... just play what you love and
be true to yourself... everything is possible if you put your mind,
body and soul to it...... because believe it or not, there are tons of
poeple out there dieing to hear what you want to play....

Well you see, I'm going to be studying abroad to *London* next 
semester and before I go I want to know a little more about 
--= the scene in London =--.  Like who are the good dj's, where 
are the cool clubs, where are the parties held, what are the 
record stores and clothing stores I HAVE to check out???   
If you have been there and can help me, it would much 
appreciated ;)

What kind of music will you be spinning?  Are the samples gunna be a big
part of your music or are you just going to add the samples to make your
sound better?  If you are going to use samples often then you should get a
sampler separate from the mixer (since the good samplers out there in the
market are those that don't come with the mixer).

Hope this helps.

Hi Everyone,
I'm need recommendations for cool but not too expensive places 
in the Bay Area, Sacramento, Tahoe or surrounding areas to have 
a weekend retreat.  The dates of my class retreat are 11/21/97
to 11/23/97.

We expect to play loud music sometimes during the day and 
outside on the Saturday night (a mini rave).  Hopefully, that 
won't bother neighbors or the local authorities.  There are 
17 people in my class so there needs to be enough sleeping 
space (i.e., floor space for sleeping bags) and a room large 
enough for all of us to sit on the floor in a circle.  Cooking 
facilities are a plus.

I really appreciate your thoughts and suggestions.

Bradley

Huh.  I play what I want to hear, yeah.  I started because of things I 
was hearing at parties, etc.  It was almost there, but it wasn't quite 
what I wanted to hear, close but not quite.
So I figured the only way to really hear what I wanted to hear was to 
play it.

I love to look up from the decks and see someone just lost in the music.  
It's that look that makes it worth all the money, the work, etc.  

It's fun, I like the instant gratification you get when it works, I'm 
much better at spinning than I am at actually making music (a 
realization that took me many years of making bad music), and it 
inspires me to make more music (bad or good, we'll have to see).

And I love when someone tells me that they liked something I played, 
just gives me a big ole warm fuzzy inside.

After being exposed to my first rave back in '92, I started to get into the
whole music side of things.  It wasn't until two years ago that I made the
investment and bought some decks and a mixer.  As somebody who studied
classic piano music for the past 20 years, I found an immediate connection
to the music of the underground.  I really don't know how to explain this
connection; it's very personnal and close to my soul.

Though I don't get too many opportunities to get out and spin, I really
enjoy those moments when you connect with people through the music.  The
most fun I usually have at parties is when I connect with others around me
through the music.  It's somehow spiritual, seeing others around you being
affected in the same manner as yourself.

Anyway, those are my few comments.  I could go one and one about this
topic, but I'll save the bandwith.

I want to be a healer.

Vertigo and I were talking about this last night.  I mentioned to him
that (for me personally) there is a superficial desire to be liked and 
admired.  Sometimes I find that I boast about the fact that I am a DJ.

But that isn't what makes me happy.  That just the shallow,
soulless part of me that hasn't fully healed yet.

This music is an incredible gift that has been dropped into the
master program.  I think that locked inside our DNA is a lot of 
really important information about where we've come from, and where
we're going.  The history of the Universe from start to finish.

I think that techno music is a key that opens door to all that
information.  Not the ONLY key, but one of many.    Vertigo said
he thinks it's sound that are souls hear when they're in transit.
Like when you bust a whippit and hear techno music, even when 
none is playing.

Being a DJ is like being the Keeper of the Gates between Here
and There.   "Come one in everybody, I have some secrets I want 
to share with you!"

I also think there is an incredible responsibility for the DJ.  To
carry the audience through the night smoothly  ( I say audience because
I'm an ambient DJ).  
One time,  this kid in LA sent me an email; he said, "I remember you! 
You're the guy who played Arlo Guthrie and sent my friend into a bad 
trip!"
It was weird to think about being responsible for someone's bad
trip.

As Vertigo pointed out last night, we have enormous potential to heal
ourselves with this music. That's the reward to being a DJ, for me.

It's my b-day and my friend and I were contemplating coming up to SF
tonight in order to do a shake our booties.  Anyone know if there are
any weeklies (jungle would be nice) going on tonight or anything else to
do.  Oh yeah,  may have spare room in our car if you need a ride from SC
to Tribal Massive.  Email me if you need a ride.  (this will be more
definate as the week goes on).  Don't know how many seats though. 
love,
Bret

hey...is that the research project sponsored by tribal massive?
I heard they use the electrodes to implant in your mind
suggestions to come to their massive and give them the money back.

Im curious to know if you now have a really strong thirst for 
bottled water also.

Nope.
 Your all wrong...

 Almost but no cigar.
Real is, being true to yourself, what you beleive in, and excepting
other people's opinions & beleifs as possibilities aswell.

Damnit..
Jeff
And.. Make your own judgement, but don't judge other people.
 You might have just got them on a bad day. You know.

Hey man...

 It's like.. Think of that directory as if it were a building..
 You need to evacuate the building before you can tear it down.




Oh..
Nowah days we have deltree.. And my favorite.....Windows 95
I remember one day..Long ago.. I accidently deleted my windows directory
while in
the file manager of windows 3.1

You have to like guess the first letter of every file when your undeleting
too. It sucked.
What a waisted high that was.

I live fairly close to the Tribal Massive and am contemplating having a crew over
for a little pre-shin dig. It is a room where as much noise can be made and complaints
are very rare. Essentially in the middle of an industrial area in a nice, safe section
of the East Bay. If you are interested in stopping by and whooping it up a little
before hand, let me know and I'll send you directions.

Also, if there are enough people I wouldn't mind having somebody spin. I have a kick
ass system and you would only need bring your decks, vinyl and if you have a mixer
you prefer, probably a good idea as mine is somewhat complicating.

Just catch the break mang..

 You don't need be worrying about any sampling going on..
Although. I have thought of recording people live at the ravEs (back in the
day) and then playing selected samples during a set. "Hey, that was me. Did
you guys hear that? Your trippin"
 But... You should worry more about your mixers quality, rather than some
sampler built in strictly for commercial advantages. I love my
Numark1800x..Even though the x-fader goes out really fast. It seems to
bring out that THUMP, THUMP like at the ravEs nStuff.. Whenever I hear a
new mix tape.. It's almost like I can tell when there using a Numark or
not. But I am still only guessing.

 Hey, I was wondering.. I seem to have adapted a pretty special way of
cuing the records.. You know.. Even if the tempo's are dead on with one
another.. If the cue is slitely off, whatever record is trailing behind
will actually sound SLOWER than the other. I have noticed that this makes
novice spinners actually mess with there tempo, even though it is already
set right.
 But, I seem to have this ability to just touch one record or the other
and. Blam! The cue is istantly streightened out, and the mix goes on
forever untell one record runs out..blah blah blah..
 Now, I know you can't go hitting the record to much when your in the mix
but. This works really great when I am matching my tempo's in the
headphones. No more constant speeding up or slowing down of the tempo,
squeezing the turn stile (thumb blisters).. I just hit the record not
currently playing outside of the head phone, over & over while adjusting
the tempo. And when I don't have to adjust the tempo anymore. The beat is
perfectly matched (sometimes?) .... It's really cool. I find myself able to
match the beats within 5 to 10 second of throwing a new record on I have
not heard before.
 I just basically FORCE the beats to match everytime they go off, hit the
tempo alittle, if it goes off again, force the beats to match again, adjust
the tempo..And so on and so forth.. It really makes it more possible to
catch your breaks on time.


Gotta goto work though.
Anyone else use this forced beat match method?
Peaz.

Well for me I personally like the Money, The chicks I
get, and Fame that I have received. heheheeh Now if
you believe that I have a bridge to sell ya!!

Well I enjoy it cause I love making people feel the
way the music makes me feel. I like to "Try" and take
you on a Mental Journey sometimes I feel like I am
taking people there other times I feel like I am not.
It is all about spreading the feeling of the music to
people. To have people come up and say hey you rocked
my world you played some great music. That is the
best payment to me!! My duty is to make people Smile
and Dance. I do see us as shamiens of Music. He do
hold the Keys as Boomer had metioned. 
Now for a few DJ facts:
1.) You rarely get chicks (Except some DJ's)
2.) UG DJ's rarely get paid or at least it is small
amounts that does not even cover rekkid costs at
least for me that is.
3.) It takes so F**king long to get even some what
known. I have been spinning for a long time and I am
know Barely getting known.

So I hope this little guide helps some wanabee DJ's
for the future.

I studied piano and voice for years as well. Since my
voice just isn't what it used to be, I find spinning
rekkids a great way to create. Besides, it beats the
hell out of watching TV at night, I come home from work
take a drag off the blunt and spin for a couple hours.

wow.  I was just about to post to the list asking if there were any
venues that had regular live performances...this 'glad hand' thing sounds
just right!

I'm interested in going...but would rather not make the trip alone.  If
any southbayers are seriously (!--I made this offer before, but was blown
off at the last minute, and it pissed me off!) interested in going, I'll
drive. email me.

I've got an outboard sampler and I think it's a much better idea.  Most 
samplers that are built into mixers (I'm not saying all, but it might be 
all) do not have MIDI or extra output lines.  Why is this important?  
Well, the one day you decide to make some tracks and you want to use 
your sampler, you're screwed!  Of course, buying an outboard sampler may 
cost you a little bit more, but in the long term I think it's well worth 
it.

:)

I spin because I've always loved music in general.  I was trained in 
music theory and I learned how to play a bunch of instruments through 
private lessons and school.  But I always had this almost guilty love for 
electronic music (ever since I was a little Uncle Noah!).  
One of my goals when I went to college was to get a radio show so I could 
share music with folks.  Well, soon, I started realizing that I now had a 
perfect opportunity to get really deep into electronic music and that 
lead me into the rave scene.

I liked some psy-trance and some house, but that boom boom boom boom 
really got to me after a while.  Jungle seemed cool, but it was a little 
too frantic for me, so I started spinning breakbeat.  :)  It made me 
remember the old days of Adidas and cardboard and ghettoblasters on 
street corners.  I liked remembering that stuff.  Nowadays when I spin 
rekkids I'll see some kid breakin'.  That makes me happy.  

The thing about DJing for me is I'd be doing it no matter what.  I've 
always picked through the vinyl and found some stuff I thought was cool 
and then put it on for my friends.  The whole rave DJing thing is a way 
for me to share the tracks I've found with a larger group of people.  

And I have to agree with Macadio, it ain't about gettin ravergurlies and 
it sure as hell ain't about gettin $$!!! :D  If you want sex and money 
you better forget spinning records and go do something else! :D

Last night at ULTRA, Dara spun an amazing set, he got me groovin' for the
long haul.  Lots of breaks, different textures, thump-thumpety
syncopation.  I like when DJ's mix/sample in one tune interspersed
throughout their set, gives the set an mental aural image after its over.
He's spinning at Phunkatech on Wednesday and Eklektic on Thursday, check
it out if you get a chance.

This whole DJ thread is great.  Collectively, all you djs out there are
responsible for 100's of my hours for good times, soothing times,
visionary times, angsty times, the whole emotional gamut, ya know?  Well,
anyways, i enjoy hearing the dj perspectives, I hope you all will post
more about your dj experiences.  What about stories of powerful
connections between dj and dancer?  Anyways, here's a big thank you to the
masters of vinyl.

right round,
GEorgie

ooooohhhhhhhh....well I love to spin because when I do I get so into the
music that it is just like entering another world that I have created
myself....Everything around me doesn't exist for the time being and it is
like being in a trance....especially when the speakers and you can feel the
base going through your whole body. It brings peace to my mind and when I am
all done I take the tape that I just recorded and listen to it in my car as
my base thumps....and I get to experience the whole thing all over
again.....ahhhhhh the exitement of spinning....

What's up all!

Sorry to post to entire list but, it is kind of rave related, 
I used to have a VW bus that I used to go to parties in,
 and its kind of fun when you have 11 people in the back  and two 15's
pumpin'

Anyways....

Does anyone know of anyone selling a old (pre 67') VW bus. 
I really want to get one, I sold my last bus and now I am looking for
another one.
I don't care if its been sitting in someones driveway or back yard for
years.

Please let me know...
Thanks
Pete

a guy came up to me last week after my set and said ( almost verbatim , i
remember it so distinctly ) :
" That was great- sometimes i'd just be chillin and somethin in the music
just pulled me in and I had to start dancing. my body just started moving-
not cause I decided to but subconsciously I just grooved to it.. i've never
had that before. thanks."

Wouldnt it be fun if the vatican revealed that the pope
had been secretley listening to techo for the past 3 years
and as a result has now had a religious awakening. And that
 he is coming to san francisco in his popemobile to lead our
 million ravers march down market st.

And My reply is:

Funny thing happened on monday, I woke up and decided it was time to do 
some laundry, so I put together a load of laundry and pop it in the 
washer, so I go about my day-off stuff and I decide to go check on the 
laundry.... just a moment... the point is coming up ..... Sure enough 
the load was a tad bit big so I start shifting the clothes a little to 
help and the washer starts giving off this combination bass and squeak
groove, So I listen to it for a few minutes and the next thing I know 
I'm dancing the the rhythm of the washing machine,which went on for 
several minutes. The moral of the story............. he he :^)...... If 
you've got the need to dance you can find a good beat anywhere, anytime!

You really need to get your facts before you spew your mind.  The reason soud
sucked was because there were 2 Oakland PD officers there the entire night
monitoring the sound levels.  If you had been reading the recent messages you
would have realized that 2nd and Jackson got their permits revocked by
Oakland.  The only reason they could have this party was if they agreed to
new sound ordinanices.

Speaking your mind is your right, just get your facts straight.

<< Moby has a new single out in October/November. It's a cover of the classic
 "James Bond Theme"; there are remixes by Danny Tenaglia, Grooverider, CJ
 Bolland, Dub Pistols, LSG, Oliver Lieb and Moby himself. It's out...
 
 in most of Europe: now.
 in the UK and Germany: November 3.
 in America: 12" out now, CD soon (ask your local record store).
 
 The video for the single  features Moby as an action hero leaping off
 buildings, dodging trains and fighting attackers, as well as clips from the
 new Bond movie, "Tomorrow Never Dies". It's picking up plays on MTV in
 America and Europe and has been playlisted on MTV UK. It's also being
 played on The Box in the UK and Europe - if you want to see more of it you
 can help by ringing the voting number and requesting it (watch The Box for
 details).
 
 Moby also has a new album, "I Like To Score". It's released in most of
 Europe and America now, and will be released in the UK and Germany on
 November 10. Tracklisting is:
 
 1       Novio
 2       James Bond Theme (Moby's re-version)
 3       Go
 4       Ah-Ah
 5       I Like To Score
 6       Oil 1
 7       New Dawn Fades
 8       God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters
 9       First Cool Hive
 10    Nash
 11     Love Theme
 12     Grace
 
 The album is a collection of Moby music from films such as Heat, Scream,
 Tomorrow Never Dies (the forthcoming Bond movie), The Saint, Cool World,
 Joe's Apartment, Space Water Onion (an indie film made by one of Moby's
 friends) and from his first ever full film score, Double Tap. Double Tap
 was made for America's HBO TV channel but it might get a cinema release in
 some countries.
 
 NEWS
 ** Moby has recently recorded a track - "Tiny Rubberband" - with the
 Butthole Surfers for the Spawn soundtrack, out now. He's got another song,
 "Shining", on the soundtrack to the forthcoming movie "The Jackal", and
 several more of his tracks are due for inclusion on soundtracks soon. More
 info as we get it. He's also recorded a version of The Clash's "Straight To
 Hell" with Heather Nova; that's included on a Clash soundtrack album (not
 sure if it's out yet - sorry!)
 
 ** He may help on a couple of tracks for the new Guns 'n' Roses album, but
 unfortunately doesn't have the time to produce the whole thing, And, as he
 recently said, "Working with Guns 'n' Roses every day for nine or ten
 months might well drive me insane. I like them and we get along well, but
 it's bad enough spending all that time with myself..."
 
 ** He recently met Bono from U2, who told him that reading the sleevenotes
 to Moby's "Animal Rights" album meant more to him than seeing The Clash in
 1977...
 
 ** Moby is currently working on his next album proper, due for release in
 late1998. The first single from that album will hopefully be released in
 the spring.
 
 ** Moby will be touring America in November and December. Unfortunately we
 don't have the dates yet, so if you live in the US check out your local
 press/radio. As & when we get the dates we will forward them to you.
 
 EUROPE
 Moby performed the "James Bond Theme" on France's Nulle Part Ailleurs on
 October 28, and will be doing a live DJ mix of his own records on Fun Radio
 (Paris) at about 1700 on Wednesday 29. He's doing an interview for a French
 internet magazine - it should soon be up at
 http://www.club-internet.fr/rencontres/ (no doubt in French). He will also
 perform live on Ireland's Late Late Show this Friday (31st Oct)and DJ on
 Radio Ireland at 1am on Friday night/Saturday morning.

Hey kids,

		I debated a lot on posting this but decided I would because it never hurts
to ask. I was wondering if anyone on ths list has ever lost a parent. My
father just passed away this Sunday and it was really unexpected. I was just
wondering if anyone has ever gone through this before and if so what kind of
things you might have done to get through it. I have 3 other sisters and one
of them is taking it kind of hard. Any thoughts would be apperchated. please
reply to me privatly, and if anyone could, could you send a feel better note
to my sister Desteena @ Dusty360@aol.com. She thinks all of my friends are
pretty great, she needs some support, and I think she would be really happy
to hear from some of you.
Thanks guys, it means allot.

Lots of love,
Amanda

The feeling when  that build up just drops and takes over everything 
including yourself. IS  why I love to DJ. The first time someone breaks 
in a record and just floors the party. or when you're at the record 
store and you find that piece of vinyl you've been chasing forever or 
discover that jem you've never heard anyone play out before. Or that 
mixtaqpe that puts you in the right mood. Even tho Djing can be a VERY 
EXPENSIVE, time consuming, habit. You got to have your priorites 
straight and love it for what it is. Getting to play out is a mix of who 
you know, having the skills, promotion and preserverance. There is so 
much competion-even doing it yourself (throwing your own parties) is as 
expensive and risky as ever (PROPS to thos e that continue) In the end 
you have what  you started with-The Music..this is the bottom line (at 
least on my screen).--(DJ) Raf  (One)

    there is a couple of articles on wired news' website today about
that wacky 'vibrant youth culture that's gravitated toward electronic
music'.  they talk about prodigy and chemical brothers too much, but
they do have a bunch of audio files (which unfortunately, without a
sound card at work, i can not listen to) of other folk which might be
interesting.  the urls are:

On Sunday, we had the 3rd annual transvestite spaghetti feed birthday
dinnner for my friend Michelle's birthday.  Girls come as boys, and boys
come as girls.  Some of us looked pretty damn good.  My legs are itching a
bit, but it's getting better.  I had to shop half a day trying to find size
12w 2 1/2 black heels.  Found them at Payless Shoe Source for a total of
$14.  Such a blast, getting together, feeling all sexy.  I had this killer
black angora sweater on [for an Ed Wood referance], fishnets, tight black
skirt...  got hella compliments on my legs...

It only happens once a year.... your friends can help you make it something
special.

Happy Birthday.

Best Comment for Chill/Ambient/Trip Hop:	

Ethan Miller after my chill set at 4x4 "So er... what do you call that?"
He then went out of his way to indicate that he meant that in the best
possible way... I think I might have overdone the "art factor" on that
set...

Any time people spontaneously start making out or stop talking, or several
people suddenly open their eyes, look at each other, smile, and go back
into their heads to wander around some more in their spaces comfortable
and confident.

Best Comment for Dance Sets:

Eyes rolling into back of sockets and going into the "I don't know if it's
the drugs or the music or what but I am elevated and very happy dance"

The stomp dance, where they have given up on thinking about dancing, and
are now going into tribal mode... doing what feels best as opposed to a
cohesive dance that might look better.  Actually, I think most dance DJs
go off when they see people just go apeshit.

Like... I love it when people can't talk after a set, and they try anyway,
and they finally give up, blab something that sounds like "Thank You" and
proceed to give a very good hug.  Suddenly, your records cost nothing,
they spin themselves and you ask yourself what you could have possibly
done to deserve it.  That's the one that keeps me beaming for about two or
three weeks afterwards.

Worst Comment:

I guess there are multiple ties...

1. Someone came up during a set and said "why are you doing this to me?" 

2. Someone asked me if I had any Happy Hardcore during an ambient set. 

3. Someone asked me if I thought whale sounds should qualify as music, or
if was just trying to be "trippy" (the track playing at the time was FSOL
Lifeforms band 2, a track that I would consider gorgeous by any
standards).

Secret Fear:

Deck Divers

Peace,
AndyW

>>whats the best/worst/strangest comment you've ever gotten after/while

> and turn off the damn fog machine, i can hardly breathe!!!"


yes, these are always the best!  usually made by newbies. Kind of cute
and innocent.  It's like the dj is 
that Mary Poppins guy, spinning records with his hands while running the 
rest of
the show with his feet.

  can you dim the lights a little?  
  it's too hot in here!
  can  I go out to my car for just a second???
  
At a Ghostribe party:
Nice sound system! where did you get it?

And the absolute best comment;  from this happy goofball who was
psyched to be at his first rave ( i think Love Affair), leaned over 
the mixer and said

  o  What are you doing?
  o  Playin records.  
  o  Oh.  Can I flick this this switch on and off?

This is going to be a let down, sorry.   I recieved news last night that
happy kids is still looking for a location.
I would say my source of information is very reliable.  I wouldn't blame
you if you wanted to check it out yourself,
so please do.  Also if you are going to happy kidz, dress warm it might
be outside. =-(         NO JOKE!!!!

                                                       Stay True,

P.S.  If you decide not to go to happy kidz......  Hopefully i will see
you at Tribal Massive!!!!
P.S.S.  Oh Yeah, if you know who i am and you see me at tribal massive, 
stop by and say happy b-day ( I turn 21 that weekend )

Happy kidz will NOT have their party outside.  They already have back up =
if they cannot find an alternative ideal location.  So don't worry =
guys,happy kidz has it under control (information from a reliable source =
I spoke with a minute ago).  Just wanted to clear up the out - side =
location assumption.

Peace and Love,
Julie

***APPLUASE*** I give to you much praise!  I would love to hear you spin 
some time.  Its nice to see that you are proud of not doing drugs and 
that you find other ways to get your highs.  I am with you on that take. 
 Dancing is my ultimate high, the music takes me on a trip...its like 
the more it pulsates through my body the higher that i climb on my 
invisable ladder.

Friend and I were browsing through a theatrical catalog and came across
some Rosco fog juice that can turn a dance floor into a pulsing hotbox.
Placebo effect?  I dunno...

It occurs to me to actually answer my own question...

Best comment (for trip hop/chill/ambient/noise...)
 - Was that the music, or me?
 - I think it was the music...

Looking up from the decks to see a bunch of sleeping people smiling.


Worst (maybe best, I dunno...)
 - That was really scary, I'm glad I'm sober...

The same morning as the best sleeping thing...
Looking up again to see someone's eyes open, and the MOST frightened 
look I have ever seen lock onto their face.

Supposed to run from 9p.m.-6 a.m. Don't know if it is faux pas to say but
I really don't care about the DJ's. I am going to see Janes Addiction
primarily... DJ's are an extra bonus.

Hi all!  ]=}


 Some important info folks. As I am not the originator of this post, 
inquiries should not be made to me (I'll just ignore them).

PS  Got to watch someone nearly die from consumming WAY too much E (about 
10 hits worth is a guess) and getting very drunk. Secound hand report 
from the emergency room says his blood sugar was dropping fast and that 
he had gone into a coma prior to being admitted.

			PLEASE BE CAREFUL! 

Thank you.

peas,



Ran D. Dreams

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Reply-To: ausgblf@queer.org.au

A Year ago, my boyfriend - Philip Kay, died from an overdose of MDMA.  I
knew that he had only taken 2 1/2 tablets of E at  most, yet plasma
levels showed the equivalent to 22 tablets.  I suspected an interaction
with Ritonavir and with the help of the Terrence Higgins Trust, had the
original Coroner's Inquest adjourned whilst this was investigated.
After two hearings, on 15th October 1997, after examining the evidence
presented, and following conversations with Abbott Laboratories UK, the
Coroner found the following:
Interaction
That Philip had taken only 2 1/2 tablets, and that there had been a
ten-fold increase in MDMA levels in Phil's blood, and that this had been
caused by an interaction between the MDMA and Ritonavir - the Ritonavir
having effected the way in which his body metabolised the MDMA;
Window Of Danger
That there exists a Window-Of-Danger, a period of particular danger
immediately following Ritonavir's dosing-up-schedule, when the CYP2D6
pathway in the liver which is responsible for metabolising both
Ritonavir and ecstasy was almost completely blocked as it metabolised
the Ritonavir.  During this period, other substances using the pathway
are left in the blood and could build up to potentially dangerous or
fatal levels;
Warning
That patients deserved to be warned of the interaction and that Abbott
Laboratories plea that to warn of the interaction would be tantamount to
condoning illegal drug use was unacceptable;
That the Court could see no reason why a clear and specific warning
could not be put on the packaging.
Further Action
On this point, using her powers under Rule 43 of the Coroner's Rules,

So my 2nd cousin from LA calls me up and asks me to pick up an exchange
student from Africa and have her stay with me for a night or two. I tell
her no problem but that I plan to go out on Fri night (to either Happy
Kids and/or FTT.) She wonders if I would want to bring her with me. This
girl is 15 ("going on 20" my cousin says) and is sort of a 'chosen
delegate' for a world youth conference in S.F. Thats about all I know.

Should I take this girl with me to a party? My thinking right now is
probably not. But I thought I'd throw it out here to you guys. What do
you think? I like the idea of showing her the awsome expierence that a
rave can be. But the drug element worries me. Not that I think she'll
take anything. But what would she think? This "world youth conference
delegate"?

Worst: "Dude are you gonna play any other kind of music? Do you have any
alternative rock?"

Really good "This is my first rave, and you're the first DJ I ever heard."
It felt like it was kinda special to her; it was to me, so I gave her a
teddy bear, a Sailor Moon sticker, and some candy.

My all time favorite-est thing anyone has ever said while I was spinning
"Hi I'm TeKnODiVa"

kids are kids, she'd probably like it.  it would be a lot cooler than
the "alcatraz/fisherman's wharf/streetcar" bullshit she'll get from
everyone else.  besides, it's halloween, i don't think they really
have that holiday in too many other countries.  think of it as "local
color".  as for the drugs, well, i'd have reservations about dosing a
15 year old stranger from another continent, but as for her seeing it,
i'm sure people party in africa too...

I'd personally take her.

Four years ago while a sr. in h.s., we'd take this Romanian guy who was 
on the basketball team.

It was a really neat experience for him because he had gone to parties 
like ours back in his native homeland.

The usual thing would be for him to climb a tree b4 he went in.

Pretty strange guy!

As graduation took place, I could remember him say:

"Now I can tell my friends back home I went to a rave in San Francisco, 
Berkeley, and Richmond!"

Much love and increase the serene environment.. Mr. E

I think you should take her, but brief her on the scene first... tell
her what it's all about... why we do it... blah blah blah. I think it'd
be a good experience for her, especially since the SF scene is one of
the best! =) Even explain why drugs play a part in the scene, what they
do, why we like 'em, blah blah blah... =)

peace.jer =)

Foreign exchange students often come to different countries  to see how 
it is, Youth delegates, of all people, or whatever, would be more 
interested in finding out what goes on with students/people/thingies in 
other countries, I would think.  By taking this person to a rave, She 
would have a bit more knowledge as to what we do out here and what  
other people do in other countries...a learning experience.  You totally 
should inform her about the drug scene.  Tell her everything that you 
know about raves, and The United States Of America.  If President 
Clinton inhaled, I would take him to a party too, but he didn't.  :(

Just in case that Happy Kidz doesn't get a location, I think that 
instead of lagging, and being lost souls we should all plan something.  
What should happen, I do not know.  Well, that isn't all that true.  In 
Santa Cruz, My dad says "that it is like a normle day down there but all 
the normal people stay home"-fun,  Castro is always fun.  I can't afford 
the Tribal Massive though...just thought that it might be fun to do 
something, other than raving on Halloween (if happy kids...)
Camping with lots of blankets in my foresty backyard, being plurilistic 
and throw pumpkins at adults, or we can steal candy from 
trick-o-tweekers so we can give it all out at our next party.  :P
Any more ideas?
Peace,
bAByHuey

P.S.
Last year when I went trick or treatin'  I would say to all the peeps
"Trick-or Slinky?" then they would proceed to kick me in the knees and 
o    say "You're too old to trick or treat," 
 o   
  o o0 o0  And I would reply hastily, "No, I'm not!..."
   0  O  o then I would leave, and be really mad for the rest of the 
          O
day.  I'd also look at my calendar and realize that I was 
trick-or-treating a week early.  I just don't understand 
holidays...hmmm?  :P

I once had a bloke come up to me and in a thick thick English accent he 
said, "I'm here visiting from England and I go home in the morning and I 
was wondering if you could play some four-beat for me?"

I said, "I'm sorry, I'm a breakbeat DJ... this is all I've got."

Why dont you have lots of big hugs. They could be planned
every hour and/or they could just happen spontaneously
when ever you all run into each other...maybe the whole
place will join in and have a HUGE halloween hug...maybe you could make 
little simple flyers advertising time and place of the hugs
and pass them out all night. Just make a hundred or so
and tell ppl to read them and pass them on...with a practice hug 
of coarse...practice makes perfect.

Wassup people!

A few of my friends and I are going to be flyin up to your beautiful city
for the FTT party this Friday, and we are quite disapointed to find out
that Jeno is going to be the opening dj. Does anybody know where else he
may be spinning that night?

Any and all info would be gladly appreciated. We'd also like to know of any

rarely do i find a compliation cd that i appreciate as much as the vinyl
itself, but if you love deep trance, you've got to check out "northern
exposure 2" put together by sasha and john digweed.  it's the stuff dreams
are made of.  pretty pricey, coming all the way from the island...but what
is money when you can have this musik to live by.   :)

btw...i'm, of course, not affiliated with said label, just thought i'd
share this find, if anyone is interested.

them its the new military stealth clothing.

five page paper due friday? sounds familiar...nope i havent done any yet
either...and i have math and  computer science homework also due
friday...and I have a set at 8:00-9:00 tomorrow at a weekly...and I need to
go into town to buy some records and smokes....and I need to finish my
pants for friday too!

i think its all a conspiracy.  btw- are you my long lost twin? j/k

how do I deal? well...I will do most of that starting about right now.
sleep? rarely. even when im not getting anything productive done. but
staying up till 5 making a tape did not make waking up for my 930 class all
that easy today. owell. to restate the jokes on this thread (but im
serious!), I think i'll re-organize my priorities later.

Hey!
I know exactly what you mean!
College kinda kicks your ass though! Especially taking Organic Chemistry
and Calculus 1b (or BC for highschool calc, but it's different) together
with another class, trying to work at least twenty
hours a week (which ends up being my weekends usually) and trying to do
homework! Then my mom gets mad because I never come visit her and my
friends think I don't want to hang out with them because I need to do
homework.
UGGGG! Boy do i know!

So how do I manage my time. Just go witht he flow and don't trip on the
shit I need to do cause then I would go crazy- literally. So just think of
the now and what needs to be now. Yes procrastination is what I am doing
now while I should be sleeping for my midterm tomorrow but just get out of
the house and into a cafe or library. You will get so much mroe done. I
swear!
Well that's about it, hope it helps!

Hola compadre,

Write down this number: 415-369-3300. This is the "Buzzline" brought to
you by the Feelgood Entertainment. It has daily party info including info
line numbers, DJ lineups, etc. 

There is always after parties at various places int he city. One that I
checked out for the first time last week is "The End Up". I don't know the
address of this place but I'm sure someone else on this list could give ya
directions there....  it's a good place to go after partying on night if
you're still UP. :) If you know what I mEEEEEan... 

Byeeeee...

Thanks for sharing. I have a buddy who has this CD and I'm planning on
borrowing it.

Another CD you should get (which I feel I could not live without) is
LOGICAL PROGRESSION I by LTJ BUKEM. Definately get this. This too is what
dreams are made of...

I say you explain to her what exactly a rave is and
let her decide. I bet she'll have a blast.

P.S. I was an exchange student in South Africa about
10 years ago. All they played on the radio was house
and early techno.

Since your coming to our lovely city to hear house your
in luck. I haven't seen Jeno's name anywhere else
on lists fo this weekend however,  Stompy Stomp @ VSF
(Pablos Sugar Shack) 12:00pm to ? Great vibe, good
music and cool venue (indoor/outdoor)this  looks like
the best call for a good dose of Saturday afternoon
house muzic "City Style".

careful on the northern exposure cd. i was only mostly-dead coming back
from burningman and my friend passed this disk forward. it was fucking
purr-fekt so of course i asked what it was - sasha n digweed's
nexposure. fine. next week when i finally wake up i buy it. but it's not
the same fucking cd. i take my gripe to my friend; you told me to get
the wrong disk and what's more i don't like most of it... too house.
turns out that the *import* is a double disk set, and the second disk,
unavailable in our watered down domestic market is the one I WANTED...
arrrggh!

Now this is very strange. Not one, but two amazing CDs are mentioned here
and both have some kind of other versions that have similar sounding titles
but are definitely not as good.

"LTJ Bukem presents Logical Progression" is the actual title of one of the
most amazing CDs on the planet. It's a double CD with a picture of the Earth
on the cover. I assume this is the one you're talking about, byroni.

Now, I recommended this one to a friend of mine (not giving her the exact
title) and she ended up buying some other LTJ Bukem Logical Progression,
which was only one CD and wasn't nearly as good.

So be careful with this one too.

Adam

there are actually 2 volumes of logical progression.  vol 1 is the 2 CD
set with the 1/4 shot of planet earth (?) on the cover.  vol 2 is newer
(duh), and I've never heard it.

bukem also has a series called 'earth'...I believe it's an import
only...and I think there are at least 2 vols as well.  earth flat out is
beautiful, and I've heard that vol.2 is good as well.

FYI - vol2 is also a double disk on import, 1 is continuous mixed by
blame with drs & conrad dropping lyrics... the other is cuts. it's good,
spacey and kina chill (like other goodlooking/lookinggood gear)

I've *never* heard anything produced/remixed/created by LTJ that I didn't
love. This guy is a musical genius and I feel we're on the same plain, in
terms of the state of consiousness we strive for. The music is so
beautiful... filled with such emotion.... sigh. Nice. Earth2 (LTJ BUKEM
PRESENTS EARTH 2) is nice... but is more hip-hoppy.. but is just as
enjoyable....

Subject: bar code tattoos!
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi there,

I'm trying to get some information on temporary bar code tattoos
that ravers are wearing in Japan (and elsewhere?) I heard that
the tattoos come in packs of five, and have encrypted messages in them.
The messages are they read by small scanners that club kids carry around.
Does anyone know anything about this? Is this actually a trend coming
our way? Any information you can send me would be much appreciated.

Cheers,
Shana

okay, heres the sitch.

I have an analogue master of my mixtape.  I'm recording that master 
using my sony tape deck, onto an ADAT tape, so I can have a digital 
master.

The analogue master is clean, but for some reason when I record onto
the adat tape,  I keep getting these nasty clicks.  It's like  the ADAT 
machine is putting the clicks onto the recording.  When I play the ADAT 
recording back, the clicks are still on it.  But if I stop and record it 
again, the clicks are in different places.  The same thing happens using 
different ADAT tapes.

anyone know how to fix this?

thanks,

    Don't know about Japan, but I was drawing them on my ankle all the time
when I lived in Central California.  It's easy.  All you do is get a Magic
Marker and a ruler.  Then make a bar code by using various angles with the
Magic Marker for that thin/thick bar effect.  Looks hella cool even close
up.  The numbers are a little bit trickier and for that you'll probably need
a sharpie and a friend.

no, i was talking to my cousin (who lived in germany for a few years),
anyway an ex-boyfriend of hers from germany came to visit this week,
and he was exited because he had "heard about halloween" but never
seen it.  so they don't celebrate it in germany, apparantly.  although
i think i remember going to a halloween party when i lived in england.
 i know it's not celebrated in nepal (but they do slaughter a lot of
goats around the 8th).  anyway, i'm really pretty sure they don't have
halloween in africa.  and even if they did i'll bet they don't
celebrate it like they do in the castro.

while dancing for hours on end.  well I will see you all in the jungle room

Geez.  This list is even cooler than I thought.  There are hella science
people on this list.  There's Natasha the Chem teacher, Pracilla the
Biochem major, and me the Biotechnology major.  I bet there's even more
science nerds lurking out there.

Cool.

With Halloween on a Friday this year, there are lots o' parties going on,
starting tonight with a Halloween edition of Pure Space, and Harvest Moon
and Direction.  On Halloween itself, Funky Tekno Tribe has maybe its
biggest lineup ever, then there are other parties in the city, and in Reno,
Sacramento, Chico, and down South; and your friends are probably having 
parties too.  Expect everyone to regroup at Stompy on Saturday, then I
like some of the other smaller parties during the week next week.

this is exactly what has been on my mind this last week.  I mean... jeans,
and a white t-shirt for me usually.  I just can't imagine wearing my kilt,
or anything else while dancing.. it just isn't convienient.  the whole
point for me is dancing till dawn, 

Sarah, i don't think anyone will think any less of you for not wearing a
costume... go as you please, you still get a hug.

How about this:

Go as...  YOURSELF!!!

You have my absolute 100% guarantee that you won't run into any one 
wearing the same costume that way. ;-)

The weather should be about what your used to in L.A.
Not so much smog though. ;-)

Perhaps a little cooler at night, but not much.
Of course I live in The Mission and somehow it always seems to be 
sunny and warm here no matter what weather conditions are in the rest 
of S.F. or the Bay Area. Any how... enough rambling... Tee-shirt and 
sweater should be fine, that may even get a bit warm if you do much 
dancing.

So im wondering about rave etiquette now...

How do you tell at a rave on halloween who is in costume...
who is in their natural state and who is in a rave outfit.

If you compliment someone on their nice costume and its not
a costume ...this could easily be mistaken as an insult.

i am wondering if some of you have been recieving rave related junk mail...

i don't know how some of these people get my email address, my only guess
is they are pulling them off sfravEs, but if you are one of those people,
please stop immediately!  it is one thing to sort of privately advertise
your party to me in a personal note, but to somehow put me on your mailing
list in my eyes is a form of electronic rape!  stop!  =[

Isn't it nice
Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies
To a life of vice
I could make a film
And make you my star
You'd be a natural
The way you are
I would like you on
A long black leash
I would parade you
Down the high street
You've got the attraction
You've got the pulling power
Walk my little doggy
Walk my little sex dwarf
(Here, doggy, doggy)
We could make a scene
We'd be a team
Making the headlines
Sounds like a dream
When we hit the floor
You just watch them move aside
We will take them
For a ride of rides
They all love your
Miniature ways
You know what they say
About small boys

Sex dwarf...

I'm in my Rolls Royce
Look it's so huge
It's big and it's gold
With my dumb chauffeur
Looking to procure
Run little doggy
Lure a disco dolly
Run my little sex dwarf
I feel so lonely
Get my little camera
Take a pretty picture
Sex dwarf
In a gold Rolls
Making it with the dumb chauffeur

Isn't it nice
Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies
To a life of vice
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice

Sex dwarf...

We could make an outfit
For my little sex dwarf
To match the gold Rolls
And my dumb chauffeur
We'll all look so good
We'll knock 'em cold
Knocking 'em cold
In black and gold

We can have playtime
In my little playroom
Disco dollies
My sex dwarf
And my dumb chauffeur
I would like you on a long black lead
You can bring me all the things I need

I think you should do exactly as is comfy for you. You could always bring
the costume with and change but then you would have to deal with a bag. I
was thinking of going as a candy raver just cause I have never done that
type of thing, but we'll see. If not that I was gonna be a twenties gansta
chick. We will definately see what happens. Only a few hours away though,
not much time to decide. I do want to be comfy that's why I was debating
going as a candy raver. Anyways. . .hopefully see you there.   :)

    Well it's 6:35 am on Halloween.  The reason I'm up so early?  Well so
that I'll have adequate time to prepare my costume!  See I was originally
gonna go as a prep/jock but a friend of mine said,"YOu might have normal
girlz chasing you down."  And that is enough motivation NOT to go as a
prep/jock.  So now I'm going as Clark Kent.  It'll be tres fun.  : )

YES YES YES!!!  It's my favorite holiday of the whole year!!!  Hallowe'en 
rocks!!!

I mean, think about it.  It's really the most no-bullshit holiday there 
is.  All you need to do is have a pumpkin, dress funky and give out 
candy.  It's much like raving (except ravers don't often carry around 
pumpkins...).  There's no hassle about some sweat that Aunt Helena made 
that doesn't fit right and relatives don't come in from out of town and 
mess up your house and there's no undercooked turkey to worry about or 
anything like that!  All you have to do is have fun and then you get to 
give out candy to all sorts of little kids in constumes!  

So I'm very very very happy that it's Halloween again!!!!

I hope everyone has a good time at whatever event they go to!  I'm 
spinning at a fun outdoor thing here in Orange County, so I'll even get 
to boogie with ravers! :D

I'll see you all soon!!  Don't eat too much candy!! :)

I need some help.  Does anyone know of a good place in San Francisco to
buy black light tubes and/or the fluorescent light canisters that hold
them. I'm in desperate need of some lighting effects for this evening
and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Gracias,

Hey hak. I'll be there and I'd love to get a tape, so I'll be looking out

december 13th?

Hey kids.

                                       ABANDON
                                       STUDIOS

          BUILT BY A BAND, FOR BANDS. Our goal
          was  to  create a versatile  project
          studio  where  we  could  have   the
          luxury  of digital recording in  the
          comfort of a psychedelic lounge.  We
          use it to capture our improvisations
          and  edit  them into clean  finished
          pop  songs. Lights dimmed,  candles,
          jamming  pure sound till the morning
          comes.  We had such a good  time  in
          our studio we decided to open it  up
          to public.

A  BIG  BLANK CANVAS. With our  system
you   capture  your  imagination  onto
inexpensive  ADAT tapes  ($12/60  min.
compared  to $75/15 min. of 1" analog
tape).  Cheap tape means never  having
to  record  over a take and plenty  of
room to experiment.

                    LOOK  MA, NO MISTAKES. Much of the polish
                    of professional tracks comes from careful
                    excising  of mistakes and compositing  of
                    multiple  takes through digital  editing.
                    After   tracking,  you  can   edit   your
                    material into perfection or rearrange  it
                    entirely. Non-destructive, random  access
                    editing  is  like using a wordprocessor--
                    you  can  change  your songs  and  always
                    undo.

                THINK  ALOUD.  ABANDON STUDIOS  is  NOT
                like  other studios. We create for  you
                a   relaxed   environment  where   your
                musical  ideas  can freely  flow.  Easy
                inexpensive  recording  with   powerful
                editing   as   comfortable   as    your
                bedroom.   Here  is  the   studio   you
                requested.
          
          
      $25/hour gets you:
        
      O 8/16 channel digital recording
      O Digidesign non-destructive editing, removable
        Jaz harddisks
      O SMTPE, MIDI, TLC
      O engineers with 10 years recording experience
      O producing and song writing available
      O guitars, sitar, guitar synthesizer, drums,
        acoustic/electronic percussion, turntables, DJ
        mixer
      O additional musicians available (cello, DJ,
        male/female vocals)
      O colorful San Francisco location, easy parking
      O relaxed atmosphere, run by a band not a
        commercial studio
      O yard - goldfish pond - comfy lounge - friendly
        pets
        
      call to arrange a package--
      we negotiate!
      
            We're making our CD here, why don't you?

No, it's not time again for the disillusioned angry post about dropping 
off the list...

I'm just busy, and tired.

So, thanx for making life that much more interesting.

I trust that when I get around to resubbing, the politics, 
personalities, and cylical topics will still be around.

So, Have a Happy Halloween (wherever you may be)!

later

I am just wondering who's hittn' up Happy Kids this 
evening. Watering Hole at say 1:00 for a meeting spot?
I'd like to put some Happy faces behind those names.
I'll be loaded with candy, and fun raver toys. Look for
the big guy, all black, with the alien b-ball cap.

Layne

P.S. Boomerang I'll see you at the rock!!

Everyone from Feel Good E. Wants to wish SFR a Happy Halloween.

The following is a small list of safe party tips for this evening:

If you plan on going to the CASTRO tonight, take public transit.  There
are going to be half a million people out there , and very few parking
spaces.  But it will be worth it.

If you are driving to the FTT Massive, be careful were you park, if it
means walking an extra block, but parking your car in a well lit spot,
or paying for parking... DO IT.   And make sure you cover up or hide
everything in your car... clothing, stereo, tapes, cd's... anything that
would make someone want to break into your vehicle.  If you can, take
BART, and carpool if possible.

Please party responsibly... there will be a lot of people out there
tonight trying to perpetrate on unsuspecting people that are just out to
have a good time...  Be aware.  Not everyone is out there for the same
reasons you are.  Many are out there to capitalize of YOU.  Don't get
taken advantage off and don't get poisoned because some looser wants to
comprimise your health to line their pockets full of cash.

Please practice Safe Sex... Should you be so lucky :)   'nuff said.

Be careful driving tonight because there are going to be enough people
on the road that shouldn't  in any way be driving.  Be aware of them,
And Don't Be ONE of them.

Keep an Eye on your friends, and make sure they are keeping an eye on
you.  Have a meeting spot, and don't overdo it tonight.  Know your
limitations, and don't experiment, tonight is not a good night for that.

Any Ways, Just want to wish everybody a very happy and SAFE Night.  Its
going to be VERY Crazy out there tonight, and just want to remind
everyone to Party Responsibly.

Feel Good E. cares about all you crazy and wondrful ravers out there, so
please pass on this info tonight to others....to show them that you care
as well.

Keep it Real

Vlad aka Ray Vonie

Gotta love that Happy Kids voicemail. Funniest one I've ever heard.

Does anybody know the performance schedule, particularly what time Mars &
Myster-E are playing?

my apologies!

sorry everyone!
can't get mail to you liz!
i tried w/ 2 different addresses... hope you get this one... even with your
digest format!
-----------------------

sent this to the wrong e-mail 15 min. ago...:

sorry i haven't gotten back to you until now...
i've just been so freakin busy!
what are you plans?
a friend's having a b-day party at 8pm then around 10pm we'll be moving
on... if you want to come... you're more than welcome. i'm not sure we're
going to be up to... and good ug partys to suggest when everyone it trying
to decide where to go ?
------------------

good thing that you e-mailed me!
i'd like to check out happy kids... can i get a ticket at the door?
a told melody i'd hang out w/ her and the rest of the gang... but i think
that that might get stale really quick- so either i'll be inspired to move
on or every one will be.... how easy will it be to get into happy kids
later on tonight? around 12 or so?
do you know where it is yet?
thanks for the info!
i'm still waiting for my organic treats the ken supposedly has of mine...
he's been completely avoiding me... he better get back to me or i'll be
PISSED!
happy halloween!
how is your costume?

i'm ok w/ mine!  a little red & silver futuristic geisha girl!

bye!
let me know if you get this!
