First, something topical, just to clear the proverbial phlegm from our
collective throats -- http://www.tcp.com/%7Eprime8/Orbit/mission.html

Next, a cool 'zine (IMHO) from a local... "Orbit Around The Web"
	http://www.tcp.com/%7Eprime8/Orbit/index.html

And finally, a thereby inspired harbinger of the webpocalypse now (?)
http://www.thespot.com/ or as I like to call it "my bush in the life of ghosts."

------- Forwarded Message (recycle, maaan!)

So I was surfing through http://www.tcp.com/%7Eprime8/Orbit/index.html
(cool 'zine) and found a pointer to http://www.thespot.com/ (Melrose-Place
meets Baywatch meets Real World meets Geeks/Internet) which was listed
under orbit's "disturbing web sites (URLs to make you hurl)" link...

So who are the people behind this? Hollywood? TV? Ad Agency? And why?  Is
there money to be made in creating these interactive sites?? How much?

Geoff White -- do you know what the deal is -- looks like they're hooked
through Silicon Reef, which in turn is hooked up via Internex. ... Got any
inside info? Anyone?

                     Subject: The Spot

                     Hi again Mike,

Here's something else to disturb you and waste your time: a new site on the
WWW called The Spot. It's a cross between a geek house and MTV's "The Real
World", or perhaps more ap propriately The Resort filtered through "Melrose
Place". The supposed premise of this site is that a quintet of gorgeous
Malibu brats conned somebody into buying them a huge seaside house, a
domain name and a 500-trillion-gigabyte server, as well as hiring an army
of professional HTML geeks, graphic designers, photographers and UNIX
support team to project their collective ego into cyberspace. My hacker
friends here have been tracing the source of this website and have
discovered that it is a huge advertising venture. While I have nothing
against commercialism on the Web (that's how I'm feeding myself, after all)
this site is creepily Phildickian in its blurring of the authentic and the
contrived.

What really disturbs me about "the Spot" is this: even though I consciously
realize that the women presented are (probably) just actresses playing
parts, and that their journal entries are (probably) written by teams of
non-union Hollywood screenwriters, and their photographs are (probably)
completely posed, and this entire project is (almost certainly) an enormous
marketing weapon aimed directly at me and my demographic, I can still get
off on the voyeuristic thrill of looking into these women's "private
lives". It functions much like pornography; the fact that you know it's all
contrived and calculated does not diminish its potency to the erotic
imagination.

This in itself wouldn't be so disturbing if the residents/characters of
"the Spot" didn't spend so much time trying to convince the audience that
they are in fact real people.

It also feels a little bit like a hostile colonization of cyberspace. Those
of u s who've homesteaded the web with our crappy, quirky little sites are
now having the ground bought out from under us by Big Money, and the sound
of bulldozers is not far off. Maybe I'm wrong about this. I sure hope so.

     yours, 
     patrick 

Read some of my friend's responses here.

My friends and I had this conversation on ICB on 6/22/95 7:15 p.m., pasted
here verbatim:


<Davinator> "thespot" is a sham perpetrated by an ad agency which will
<Davinator> soon be selling product placements
<Goddess> I called the ad agency
<Goddess> fattal and collins
<caliban> ew
<prime8> oh really?
<caliban> why?
<maniac> excellent.  now we know.
<Davinator> what did they say heather?
<prime8> that's even more loathesome than I previously thought
<Goddess> I called to make sure it was really an ad agency
<Goddess> and then sean called
<caliban> Net revenues$115,042$97,197$337,027$289,699
<Goddess> and said he was from the sentinel and got even more info
<maniac> we should get the gay and lesbian groups to yell at the ad
<maniac> agency for that idiocy where one of the characters called the
<maniac> other lesbian.
<prime8> fuck yeah
<tapeworm> wow what is this ad?
<prime8> thespot.com on www
<Goddess> it's not an ad yet
<tapeworm> ok sure thespot.com on www but what IS it?
<maniac> it's a cross between a geek house and mtv's "The Real World"
<maniac> in appearance.
<Goddess> they are going to phase in promotional spots
<Goddess> it's a "serial" about life in a melrose place geek house
<tapeworm> oh my
<Goddess> it's REALLY lame
<Goddess> nice graphics.
<Goddess> obviously professional
<tapeworm> where does it take place?
<Goddess> down south
<caliban> geek house
<caliban> no geeks look like that.
<Goddess> nope
<caliban> no geeks have asses like that or washboard stomachs like that
<Goddess> nor do geeks with such nice bandwidth have such lame jobs and
<Goddess> no education :)
<prime8> hey, is it okay if i cut and paste this conversation directly onto their message
 board?
<maniac> go look when you get a chance.  it's amusing in a disgusting
<maniac> way.
<caliban> patrick: yes
<caliban> please do

So I pasted the above conversation onto The Spot's Message Board. It was
there for a few days before somebody there was smart enough to remove it.

                                                        
                                 In this movie, The Spot's Tara gives
                                indisputable proof that she is, in fact,
                                             real. 


I spoke with Tara, Carrie and Michelle live on IRC channel #spot on July 6,
1995. I asked all the pointed questions: who is paying for the Spot, why do
you pretend to be real people, are you going to take mushrooms and if so
are you going to write that in your journals, etc. Tara's response to these
questions were such sophistries as "How do we know anything's real?" and
"What's the point of anything?" The other people logged on the channel were
telling me to lighten up. "Of course it's not real -- it's an interactive
fantasy, so just enjoy it." etc. I began to feel they were right.  After
all, I did on many occasions frequent Bianca's Smut Shack, an elaborate
interactive fantasy featuring a fictitious figurehead known as Bianca. So
what the hell? Why not flow with the Spot?

Later that day I received the following letter from Tara:

        Patrick-

Thanks for your mail.  FYI- I am all woman and the opinions expressed are
my own.  

{Insert -- This in response to my question, "Are you real 
or are you a character created by a team of writers?"}

However, I do realize I was jumping the gun by calling my
professor a pussy.  I believe in equality for all people- I was just
venting during a particularly stressful moment before.  Lets be kind to
each other.
        
                Tara

*sigh* 



Why be angry?

Another post that was wiped off the Spot's message board was this brilliant
rant by bc@wetware.com.  God bless him!



Sat, 17 Jun 1995 22:53:50 GMT 
Why am I angry at The Spot? 

Because I find it so poorly written as to be insulting to my
intelligence.

Because I find the fact that it is a marketing "warning shot" aimed 
square across my bow to be insulting.

And because, like many of the people on the Internet, I was the 
unpopular kid all my life. Now the place where I *am* popular is 
being invaded by the Prom Queens and Junior Marlon Brandos, saying
"Oh by the way, WE'RE the cool people again. We would snub you
in real life, but we're gonna be nice, JUST THIS ONCE, and let you
peer over our shoulders at how WE, the COOL people, live in real life."

Details:

What the Spot claims it is and what it actually is are so 
discordant as to be nauseating. 

It never comes out and says it's real people who write their own 
material, but the creators try as hard as possible to make it sound 
that way. Hey, I don't *mind* fiction, but drop the pretense. 
You're not fooling anyone.

Second, the Spot tries really hard to be realistic, but that's 
so badly done as to be laughable:

1) If these people are all waitresses and aspiring actors, 
why is this site so riddled with slickness? Every single page 
has a different "cool" background gif pattern. All the photos 
are beautifully scanned. Every "member" of the collective has 
their own *logo.*

Here's a solution: Show the "creators" and say, "Hey, we got these
people to live in this house and check out this freaky cyberspace
thing. We've got a trained staff to turn their mewling into web 
pages because, well, we wanted them to look really cool." No shame 
that!

2) They're all poor, yet not one of them has ever been fat in their
lives. Nevermind ethnic mix or any of that stuff! Guess being 
unemployed gives you more time to do your nails or burn up those abs.
Oh yeah, in LA they SHOOT ugly people. I forgot.

3) They are all stereotypes. The stereotypes presented are mean. 
They hurt people. Bimbo characters delude people into thinking that 
the world is full of bimbos. It's not. The world is full of fat
people who are sad a lot of the time, who eat fried chicken 
in their underwear, and work because they have to. You guys claim
realism, yet your world has no room for fat people, smart people,
or uncool people. Most of the romance novels I've read were LESS
stereotyped, and much better written, than your stuff.

5) The characters are totally inconsistent. Here's a woman showing 
a picture of herself in a babydoll nightie and saying, *right next 
to it*, "There's no space for rent between my legs." Right. Does
this woman have an IQ below the freezing point of ice?

6) The characters come off totally wooden. It's patently obvious the
writers have never ever been to Short Stories 101. Clue: the first thing
they write on the board is "Show, don't tell." Translation: if the
character wants to communicate deepness, they do it with deep actions,
not by saying "I'm so deep, man."

Why am I angry? Because I know what "real life" is. This "Spot" 
project tries to tell me that it is real life, or at least realistic, 
and not only fails to do so, but insults me as well.

It asks me to believe in these terribly written, patently fake 
characters. It even asks me to write to them. 

That insults my intelligence.

It says, "hey, LA is full of beautiful white young people who don't
know anything about "cyberspace" but create logo-rife web pages of
their real lives." Nobody I know has a $50,000 plastic-injected chest.
Giant breasts don't come with wasp-waists in my world. I know people
who are in fantastic shape. But since they work for a living, they 
don't have corded abdominal muscles like your actors.

That insults my lifestyle. 

Someone told me this Spot was being done by an ad agency. Well, it
sure isn't hitting ME, the apparent target market. (And I am a single
white male, 32, making in excess of $60,000 per year.)

It doesn't make me envious. It doesn't make me wanna buy perfume or
a car. I make my own perfume, and keep my 1963 Corvair convertible
in racing tune.

This is the Internet. People are smart here. They don't sell
like the rest of the populace. You have to have good content to
sell them. You have to have believable characters. You have to
avoid stereotypes, because people here, if they see a stereotype,
they get angry.

And most of all, you can't go around with a "we're cooler than you"
attitude. People on the net have a chip on their collective shoulder
about that. It's roughly the size of the Moon.

Wanna see a good "real people living in a beach house" web page?
Go load The Armory
                                              
- --------------------
Most telling clue that the Spot is probably fake:

One of the journal entries is written by a dog.

Silicon Reef is a "WebDesign" firm, they have apparently co-located a server
over at InterNex.  When I was last over there, the sales guys at InterNex were
churtling over this site, needless to say I was not impressed. (Makes me glad
I don't work there anymore :)

The angle is to get a bunch of hits and them mostlikely sell advertising, but
think about it for a minute...

  Very true. Huxley comes as close as possible to putting words to the 
ineffable. However, his mescalin experiences were those of a solitary 
intellectual. He sees and reflects -- but his interaction with people, as 
described in the *Doors*, is near zero.
  It would be a service to the rave community if someone could write a 
"Doors of Perception* with an eye to how feelings of belonging or harmony 
with a group are heightened (if they are) by enhanced consciousness.

I think it's brilliant, actually.  

A co-worker met "Carrie" I think it is, at a salon party in SF recently.  
Based on his experience, I think the only conclusion one can draw is 
there's no such thing as 100% "real" or 100% "fake" :)

I'm using the freeware version of Stuffit Expander and it has no problem
unstuffing Compact Pro archives. I just tried unstuffing an old Compact Pro
file to make sure. I just dragged it over and dropped it on the stuffit
icon. (MacOS 7.5.1 not sure how Windoze users do it.) Perhaps you just need
to download a different verson of stuffit. I don't remeber where I got my
copy. It was either AOL (I only used the 10 free hours, I swear) or BMUG.
Good luck there's lots of wicked cool suff on Hyperreal. If you get stuck
and are running MacOS let me know and I'll put a copy on a floppy and bring
it to Sunset.

Before the rumor mill goes out of control on this, let me say that I talked
with both Dub Tribe and Donovan (separately, so it adds even more credence
to the story) about what happened in Santa Cruz.  Basically, the promoter
was a scam artist.  He led Dub Tribe on for weeks about getting a site,
then when they arrived Saturday evening it turned out to be on the beach
at Davenport.  Ex Why Zee already demonstrated in no uncertain terms why
it is stupid to put on a $20 event on a public beach, but apparently you
can get away with a lot of stupidity if you're a promoter in Santa Cruz.

Of course, as soon as they arrived, so did the cops, who chased them away.
Tiring of all this, Dub Tribe suggested that everyone get their money back
from the promoter.  The promoter apparently said something to the effect
that people should get their money from Dub Tribe (who did not get paid).
As reported here previously, some people finally did get their money back
but only after an extended wait.  

I've also heard the record store that was selling tickets continued to
do so past 1 am even though they knew no final location had been found.

I thought we had left this kind of promoter idiocy behind on the west
coast, but it seems that was my mistake . . .

The Techno Report
Compiled by
Mike Huckaby (RECORD TIME)

        First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for the enormous response to my
charts and columns.  The response has been sogreat that I have decided to do
charts and columns every week instead of biweekly.

        Here are a few bits and pieces in the world of techno for this
week.  We are currently completely sold out of Muzik, the new underground
magazine from the UK, I mentioned last time.  You don't want to miss the
next issue for
anything!  The next issue promises to have an R&S Records cassette tape of
unreleased material attached to it!  Tracks from Carl Craig, Ken Ishill,
Kenny Larkin, and Juan Atkins will be included.  And previously released
stuff from DJ Hell and Joey Beltram, just to name a few.  And of course it
will be available at Record Time.

Hot News Flash - Just In!

        Dave Clarke, the man himself has just phoned be up to let me know
that a few
white labels of Red 3 have been pressed up, and that a copy it is on its way
to me.  I'm anxious to hear it again myself.  I only heard it onece in March
when we spun together at a party in England.  I'll do a full review of it whe
I recieve this copy.

        Other News in the making:  The Goodmen will no longer be recording
for Fresh Fruit out of Holland.  Another Holland based label is said to be
responsible for the Goodmen now.  Also look out for a new Jack Prongo 12
inch from Holland as well.

        Zach Roberts of Indx Records from Detroit releases a new single called
Halogen Forthcoming releases from Touch'e Records

        I've managed to track down a bit more information about the releases on
Touch'e Records this summer.  It seems that the very next release on Touch'e
will be a track called "PaRelax" by Amfibian, followed by a Felix Da House
Cat releas.  Tracks on Felix's release include "The Chaos Engine and "Citzen
Bishop".  The third and final release I have info on will be a 12 inch by
Loophole.  The titles will be named "LoopHole", "Antoinette", and "Time
Clock".

Miscellaneous Release Notes

        Air Liquide is releasing a ton of material right now.  They have a
current 12 inch out called "Live in New York", and will have a double 12
inch out soon called "Stoboplastics".  The DJungle Fever crew releases on
acid
tweeking 7 inch by Bizz OD.  The track is called "Little Funky Jazz Piano".
 Ian Poole releases remixs of his "Celtic Cross" 12 inch.  The of the tracks
is a remix by DJ Sneak.

          Christian Vogel releases a Double 12 inch on Tresor through Mosquito
Records called Absoute Time.  There are mabye two tracks on it worth checking
out.  Reload Records out of Belgium releases another Techno pounder entitled
Subjective Duality.  And Finally, look out for Techno Nations Volume 4,
available on CD & LP from Cheap Records.  Good Techno stuff is included.
 Material is provided by Luke Slater, Tim Taylor, Bandulu, Damon Wild, &
Patrick Pulsinger.

Thats all for Now
See Ya!

Man, what's going on with all the promoters and Santa Cruz lately? First 
Ex Why Zee loses their location at the Civic Auditorium and tries to 
throw their party at Bonny Dune, using Bass the whole time. Dumb.
Then the whole Dubtribe debacle. I don't know any more than was just 
mentioned here. Again, some shysters tried to charge money to throw a 
party on a 100% bust-likely beach. Sheer Idiocy.
And remember Catastrophic Planet? Well, I mean do you remeber the flyers, 
since the party never happened? Our friends at Ex Why Zee once again lost 
their location and the Civic Auditorium. This time they only left a 
message on one of their voicemails about someone being seriously ill 
forcing the cancellation of the party. Yeah right. A certain LA dj who 
was slated to play didn't find out that the party was cancelled until 5 
pm Fri night, I'm not sure if he had already driven up to Santa Cruz. He 
later did a little snooping and found out that the Civic Auditorium had 
ceased negotiating with Ex Why Zee a month ago! He also found out that 
Bass had stopped selling a week ago too. Both are extremely ironic 
considering that Thousands of beautiful 5x7 Catastrophic flyers were 
being passed out at last week's Funky Techno Tribe. Now perhaps it was a 
mistake and those flyers weren't supposed to be passed out, but things 
certainly are suspicious....
So all I can say is caveat emptor, buyer beware! Read the fine print at 
the bottom of those flyers. If you see the last three letters of the 
alphabet, you might want to think twice. If someone is throwing a party 
that sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Right now everybody and 
thier cousin bob is trying to be a promoter. Those who start small and 
humble will go far. Those who try to start by throwing all-star mega-rave 
spectacula-ramas will find themselves in the position of Prometheus. So 
if you choose to fly with them, you might get burned...

Sunday night.

Dubtribe at Minna St was nice.  I like the little gallery
there.  It was free.  Fairly well ventilated.  A little mental 
with some housey propoganda.  Shirtless bald guys on PCP were
funny while I was there.  I heard violence in paradise sent
acid trippers running into the alley with their faces
contorted in horror.  The sound system was loud.

I think alot of folks got pretty high - there's maybe some
good drugs in town.  More than a few were commenting "this e ain't
all pahty pahty pahty ..."  Which I interpret as one too many
"a little much" style moments.

Dubtribe was kinda Rock n Roll.  They were ok.  
Headbanging is sooo ... violent looking.

I really wanted to hear Doc Martin.  But I left 
before he came on.

        Reply to:   RE>DubTribe in Santa Cruz?

Dubtribe didnt happen.  I live just around the corner from Urban Oulet, the
store that was selling tickets.  The number said "$15 or $20 for two, so bring
a friend and it will only be 10 bucks each".  So my roomate and I walked down
to the store at around 9pm.  The lady selling the tickets said that the 20 for
2 deal was only till 8.  The message on the number said nothing about a time
limit for tickets.  So we talked her into giving us tickets for $25.   After
buying the tickets we asked for directions and no one would give them to us. 
Everyone working at the store told us to ask someone else for directions. 
After 10 minutes or so we gave up and walked back home to meet up with some
friends.   

At around 11pm we found out the party had been busted.  The original spot was
accross from the cement factory in Davenport just past Bonny Doon.  They
decided to move it to a place called the Eucaliptis Grove.   Its about 27
miles north on Santa Cruz and it is VERY private propery.  My roommate threw a
party there last summer that got broken up in less than an hour.   But, we
decided to go anyway.  About half way there we saw the rider truck and a line
of 20 or so cars going the oposit direction.  So we figured it got
busted.....again......so we turned around and headed back to town.  

On our way back we spotted a line of cars going up a road on the mountain side
of hiway 1.  So we started following them.  We went up this road about a mile
or so and the caravan stopped.  Seems they were lost, couldnt find the
Eucaliptis Grove.   We knew exactly where it was so we told everyone to follow
us.  

It was quite wierd to be showing the people throwing the party where their
party was...........  

The entrance to the Grove is this little drive way with a big fence and a
lock.  Someone managed to .......find the combination to the lock and the gate
was opened and all the cars drove in and found a place to park (by now there
were about 30-40 cars. 

Apparently, as soon as the driver of the Rider truck found out it was private
property they decided they did not want to set up there.  We were the first
ones to leave so I'm not too sure what happend after that but from what I'm
told, Dubtribe went home.  

Meanwhile, back at the Urban Oulet.......

They are refusing to refund any money.  Last I heard we are to hold on to our
tickets as a raincheck for their next party.   Others were told to take
something from the store that is worth $15.   Another friend of mine was
grabbed around the neck and thrown out the door as he asked for his money
back.

	Just as real as those houses on MTV...  with live-in cameras and crew.  
I wonder how many people they have working on it?  I wonder how much text the 
"residents" actually write? (probably interviews with ghostwriters). I wonder 
how much they get paid to live there...  I wonder how many psychologists were on 
the team that picked them (for audience appeal and "dynamics")...  I wonder if 
they really beat some guy up (one womans boss -- was he "in"?).

Andrew

PS maybe in the future, no house will be "cool" unless its "online"...  for the 
entertainment of the un-hip masses...  meaning of course the un-hip masses will 
decide who's cool...

	Netnews arbitron has been around at least 5 years.  Also someone seems 
to be collecting info on www hits and passing out "top 5%" awards.

Frequency 8 would like to thank all of the people who have helped to
make our first 7 events possible - especially those who have helped us
carry the equipment to and from our outside locations, and to those who
have given us a hand driving people from our map points to our trailheads.

This Friday night from 11:30 to 6:00 we ask you to join us in celebrating
our 8th cybertrancendental experience on a beach 45 minutes north of San
Francisco.  DJs will be MARS, MystrE and Cyr.  Map point will be open from
11:30 to 1:30 only.  We are asking for a $4.00 donation - so far this has
been stictly a break/even affair with any extra money going towards the
purchase of a new sound system which we will be using this Friday.

You will definately need a FLASHLIGHT and wearing a pair of sensible shoes
for going down the trail will be a wise move.  Feel free to bring water and
perhaps a stick or two for the bonfire - you may also want a towel to take 
advantage of the nearby hot springs or the ocean.

Please people, remember that this is a renegade party - our last party got
broken up because ONE person drove erratically through the town of Stinson
Beach and when they got pulled over told the Sherriff that he was looking 
for the party on the beach (the sherriff notified the park police (who were
very nice) and that was the only hassle we've had all summer).

We sure could use 5-6 people to help us lug all the heavy equipment - if you
can help, please e-mail me privately.

We do this party because we love the music - and you will not hear an
evening of music like Frequency 8 anywhere else - check us out - smiles
ARE mandatory!!!!

"D-OH!  I mean, Occifer, the barty on the peach!"

That brings up a good idea.  If we just post flyers in police stations,
then everyone would know where to go to find out where the parties are.  No
more having to hassle with Haight St. parking to get into Ameba.  :^)

Think of the possibilities.  We could use emergency broadcast frequencies
to announce events over the radio.  "BEEEEEEEEEEEP....This is a test of the
emergency raving system.  This is only a test.  In the event of a real
rave, you would be notified where to go and who the DJs are....This is only
a test"

Back to the grind...

Peace All!

Tony

Patsy: Visuals, dahling! Visuals! look. it says: "great visuals"
       dahling! this is the plan: we'll drop a couple of hits each,
       dance-trance all night friday, we'll miss out saturday,
       but come out *smiling* sunday afternoon.... it's perfect, Eddie:
       just in time for Sunset.

       Wiggle, wiggle , wiggle! I mean, dahling: if I dance anymore, my
       hips will fall off... Is that what you want dahling? An old, 
       toothless, hipless friend?
Saffy: (walking down the stairs) well, Mommy, maybe then you will finally
       fit into you old clothes again.....
Patsy: oh. IT's the BITCH daughter again...
(Edena looks shocked)
Patsy: ignore her, dahling! look! By friday we could be surrounded by

Edena: oh.... I just don't know....
Saffy: mommy! don't go!
Patsy: EddiE!!!!!!!!!
       look! it says here: "hot springs nearby"....

Thanx all!!! ;)

Hello.  This is dutch from CDC Soundsystem.  I would like to thank everyone
who believed in us enough to come to our event.  We honestly hope you
enjoyed yourselves and maybe learned something in the process.  We didn't
aim to commercialize ourselves by putting on a huge party.  We attempted to
use a little class and honor in generating the numbers that we did.
Besides an extra ordinary budget (all of which went into killer visuals and
sound, great personnel and djs, and a big UFO),  we did not resort to sex,
violence, or other popular promotional tactics.  We just put cool pictures
and our imagination on our flyer.  As Carlos and I have been highly active
in the SF scene, we really appreciate the people who stood up for our
organization and our honor.  Thank You!

We would also like to thank some others who helped to make this event possible:

 The XogeniX crew, the freaks at Ameba (we love you), Tribal funk,  Econ
graffix, D.J. Long of M.U.F.O.N., Hollywood Dog (maybe you'll get that
lazer show right next time), EAR Sound, Synergy, Opticalux, Tim the
carpenter, the guy who discovered helium, the Balloon Lady, Scooter (even
though you were late), and about 30 more of our friends who will remain
faceless so you don't get bored.

The dj line-up was:

in the main room:

        Tracy of the Ameba gang (10-11:50)

        Tony (11:50-1:40)

        John Williams (1:40-3:30)

        Dutch ,GOD I HAD FUN (3:30-5:15)

        Carlos, with an end I shall never forget (5:15-7:00)

in the XogeniX room (foyer area)

        Sausee

        Timmy Hendrix

        Das                       <SAME TIMES AS ABOVE>

        Simon

        Norplant (Orlando, FL)

in the Ameba-Tribal Funk warp zone

        Andrew, Alan, and Mark in no specific order as usual


The books that were donated were forwarded to the city of Richmond to help
out some very needy youths in the area.  Thank you for the support.

There was about 500 people who took advantage of the $15 discount price for
dressing up as an alien.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL.  The last show only 20 did.
People really went all out.  Excellent costumes I might add.  One poor soul
completely covered himself with a felt tip marker!  I am looking forward to
the next show to see if there will be a full room of aliens.

As far as actual numbers are concerned, there was nearly 3000 people at
Area 51.  Almost 2700 paid between $15 and $25.  Yes, we made a little
bundle of money.  We are not going to lie.  This sum of cash should be just
enough to purchase a new killer sound system to add to the growing list of
renegades in the bay area.  Look for us on the next frontier.  We may take
it on a test drive at Burning Man.  Who knows?

Anyway, we hope that in the future some of you will join us and actually
help us, teach the masses about our beloved way of life.

There are many friends on the road of life.  Its all just a matter of
slowing down a little to pick them up.

Ravestock is to be held in Ohio.  Yes, Carlos and I are confirmed to
perform.  There is just this matter of a contract.  I would have to take 4
years of law to understand half of what is in the stack of papers sitting
next to me.  I am not kidding.  The thing is almost an inch thick.  As for
as I know, I am going, but not before a lawyer sees this thing.

Anything else I am blind to.  I haven't spoken to Markie yet.  I did play
for Scotto, the promoter, while I was in New York.  His venue was my
favorite.  He also took very good care of me.  He seemed like a descent
kind of person, a promoter none the less.

Hope to see someone there I know.

Here is one person's comments on "the spot".  Jack currently works at
InterNex so direct all flames to him (not to me).

As far as I.m concerned I don't believe that the spot should not exist,
I fully believe that it should and people should go to it if that's their
thing.   It's OK if that isn't their thing.  Personally I find the concept
rather neat but the content is sorely lacking appealing mostly to the
"free, white and 21" set (and their wannabes :).  So to this end I 
went ahead and registered TheScene.Com, I don't have the time to build
up this Web Site in any major way but I will provide WebSpace for any
of you entreprenurial ravers out there whould whould like a go, ala
"the real deal".  Any takers can e-mail me a webmaster@v-site.net

I know if I used just half of the "tru stories" that I know, (with the names
changed to protect the guilty :) It could put the shallow lives portrayed
on the spot to shame :)  well if anyone is interested in a project like
this, let me know :)

The criticisms mounted against thespot.com are as a fine example of cultural
fascism as I have seen lately.  I will not purport myself to be a ardent fan
of "the spot" nor would I consider myself to be a critic; however, to
dismiss its web page as trash and kitsch is to blindly condemn it as
culturally irrelevanct.

One thing that may appear revolutionary to some may similarly appear as
passe' to others.  For instance, some may consider pro-wrestling as a
steroid-ridden, ultra-violent bastardization of sport.  And yet, for others,
pro-wrestling is an entertaining role-play of good vs. evil.  Nevertheless,
pro-wrestling is still a culturally valid arena of sport and entertainment
in our society, and to dismiss it would be committing an act of cultural
censorship.

In the 1930s, Hitler destroyed numerous works of art by European
expressionists, works by Gustav Klimt, Edvard Munch, Egon Schiele, and many
others, all because he thought that this entire genre of artwork was
culturally degnerate.  He exhibited all these artists in one exhibition, and
spray-painted graffiti all over their paintings, decrying it as "perverse,
satanically inspired, etc."...
And, to many art purists at the time, these works by Schiele and Klimt and
others were "perverse", in their depiction of young nude men and women, so
Hitler was only tapping into a certain sensitivity of the artgoing public,
and exploiting that cultural xenophobia.

All you computer hackers and cyber-purists may find that "the spot" has
bastardized your poor beloved Web.  Well, unfortunately, as with any other
communication medium, whether it be a canvas, a photograph, a telephone, or
a television, even the Web will be used in controversial ways, or ways
originally unintended by its creators.

This aside, I personally find "the spot" to be an innovative use of the Web,
a highly original, well-produced concept, essentially a new and fun (albeit
rather silly) interactive way to view the soap opera via cyberspace.  If the
spot's detractors find its content to be trash, well, then perhaps they
could create an interactive dialogue Web page for Platonic philosophy or
something of the sort.  To deny "the spot" a place in today's cyberspace
culture is tantamount to knee-jerk, elitist and short-sighted censorship.

who is talking about the spot not existing? I just wanted to point it
out as an interesting car-wreck (or billboard, depending on yer point
of vu) for us to rubberneck at as we drive down the info-superhighway.

This whole thing is a ridiculous statement. Like going completely
overboard. Nobody, not me, not the people whose messages I forwarded
have said anything about cernsorship. It's really nothing more than
people collectively going "eeeeewwww -- crass commercialism -- that's
grosss!"

WHat's the big deal about people's opinions? Let them have opinions all
they want as long as they don't run around telling people what to do. 

Basically, people are complaining about TVish commercialism (and  the
cultural control it exerts in telling people what is or isn't cool)
coming to the net. THese same people probably feel the same kind of
disdain for "Baywatch" or "Beverly Hills 90210"... but hey, the
opinions are there, and the shows are still on TV. Chill.

> spray-painted graffiti all over their paintings, decrying it as "perverse,
> satanically inspired, etc."...

I think you need to re-think Nazi censorship. They rarely complained
about "satan" -- Nazi spirituality was actually a strange brew of
germanic pagan "knight" culture/folklore/mysticism, paganism, nature
worship, and satanism. Today we'd call this "new age" (which is one of
the reasons we must keep a watchful eye on both the new agers and the
christians too). Is the Celestine Prophesy the next Mein Kampf? Who
knows -- is Forrest Gump the next "Triumph of the Will" ?? :-)

The nazis did have some very narrow views on what was "degenerate", and
this had to do more with art that didn't reflect the "family values"
they wanted to promote (strangely similar to the family values of the
christian right wing nowadays). A predominant value was
"anti-intellectualism" which meant that any of that
fancy-schmancy-art-skool-schtick (e.g. impressionism) had to go.
Hyper-Realism is about all the average simpleton can be fed as "art"
without getting any weird pretentions ideas... next thing you'll know
they'll be hangin around with jews and communists and wearing art-fag
boots.... ANd you can't goose step in art-fag boots, now can you!

Finally, as a failed artist, Hitler certainly needed to lash out
against all his peers that were getting attention, (and getting laid)
while he was off painting idyllic country scenes and spankin his
monkey.

Normally I just let stuff like this pass me by, but I just _had_ to jump in
on this one...

Okay.  First of all, I think this is going _way_ overboard to accuse people
of cultural fascism.  I'd like you to refer me to a *single* post that
actually proposes banning "the spot" from the web.  You will, however, see
many people talking about how silly it is.  Remember, saying something
shouldn't exist and outlining plans to get rid of it are two different
things.  And, frankly, I think describing culture as relevant or irrelevant
in the first place is a false concept.  Culture simply describes the social
situation of a society at a given period of time.  People aren't condemning
it as culturally irrelevant; they are condemning it for its lack of
substance.  Unfortunately, "kitsch" and "trash" are a part of this culture.
We're simply saying it's a part of the culture we really don't care for and
that we'd be better off without.

I hate to say it, but this example _exactly_ illustrates the point a lot of
people are trying to make.  By your reasoning, expressing your opinion
negatively against something at any time is "cultural censorship."  No, it
is making your opinion on the subject known.  Cultural censorship is "hey,
we don't like pro-wrestling, so let's get a committee together in congress
to make it illegal."  Please keep your terminology straight.
        Also on this note: So what if something like, say, arena gladiators
came back into style.  People killing each other for money on tv, perhaps.
Does this mean that we should accept it and say "well, hey, it's just
another part of our culture" just because it exists?  I don't think so.  The
example is exaggerated, but the message is the same.  Just because something
exists doesn't make it good, even subjectively.

>In the 1930s, Hitler destroyed numerous works of art by European
>expressionists, works by Gustav Klimt, Edvard Munch, Egon Schiele, and many

>culturally degnerate.  He exhibited all these artists in one exhibition, and
>spray-painted graffiti all over their paintings, decrying it as "perverse,

>And, to many art purists at the time, these works by Schiele and Klimt and
>others were "perverse", in their depiction of young nude men and women, so

As stated above, nobody is supporting the idea of legally banning "the spot"
from the Web.  Therefore, this analogy is totally invalid.

>All you computer hackers and cyber-purists may find that "the spot" has
>bastardized your poor beloved Web.  Well, unfortunately, as with any other

So we should just say "gee, that's too bad" and let it go at that?  There is
such a thing as standing up for your beliefs, although a lot of corporate
rep types wouldn't necessarily understand that.  Pragmatists like you have
gotten the world into quite a bit of trouble in the last several decades.
Maybe it's about time that changed.

And yet once again, nobody wants to _legally_ deny "the spot" a place on the
Web.  Have you ever heard of economic sovereignty?  Well, how about cultural
sovereignty then?  If people aren't interested in some part of the reigning
culture, it will disappear.  Saying "the spot" shouldn't exist and not using
it to get your point across is totally different than saying "the spot"
shouldn't exist and lobbying congress to get rid of it.  People are going to
make their opinions known, and accusing them of "cultural censorship"
because of that is not only reactionary and poorly thought-out, it is also
trying to bring about the 1984 mentality that you claim we are spouting.
        Free speech is for everyone, Jack, even those you disagree with.

        Just my $.02 1/2.

	Also, to add a little rave-relatedness (of a sort), it is now coming out 
as anti-psychedelic...  One of the tenants found an old diary, whose (obviously 
synthetic) pages appear linked to his entries.  Today he found a "good entry" 
involving a bad acid trip -- very naively depicted if you ask me, but very 
negative ("I woke up with my cheek in a pool of vomit...  Oh my god the Candyman 
is coming again...  what will I DO?").  Never mind the ethics of posting 
someones diary to the net...

	Maybe they'll have a rave sometime soon...  stay tooned.

PS with a little stretch I can believe that this actually was the idea of an 
MTV-house wannabe with a brother into Webdesign...  In fact a "whois 
thespot.com" mentions "Tara's brother"'s name...  Its still too glossy though, 
and the address, a suite near USC-ISI in Marina Del Ray, doesn't sound like a 
beach house. Does anyone else know about Fattal and Collins (the ad agency 
mentioned in the original post)?  BTW "the spot" did appear as a Glenn Davis 
Cool Site in early June; maybe he knows the story.  Or call Tyler (Tara's 
brother) at (310) 305-1838...

yeah... NASA has been dead for over a year... it was also run by (*gag

not.  how many 12-17 years olds do you know that are allowed to stay out
all night and go to parties where the kidz are drunk and falling on top of
each other?  i dunno, i just graduated from high school in june and i
didn't know any kids at my school who were _that_ fucked up.  yeah, kids
drink and smoke pot and have sex but i think the movie was a little harsh.
they only took a look at all the stupid shit kids do.  did you find one
redeeming quality in any of the characters?  i didn't.  all i wanted to do
the whole time i was watching was tell that stupid telly kid to learn how
to talk and get a life.  i wouldn't let him or any one like him near me
with a ten foot pole.  really, kids today aren't that bad.  don't let this
movie lead you to believe they are.

This is a big issue, not directly related to raving.  The summary - building
the technology and infrastructure for third-party ratings of WWW objects will
enable filtering applications, one of which could be used for parental 
control, in a *voluntary* way, without requiring that content authors 
rate them  For those with even a passing interest in how 
collaborative filtering/rating will work, check out something I've written at

  http://www.organic.com/Staff/brian/community-filters.html

and an implementation of such a system proposed at

  http://wex.www.media.mit.edu/people/wex/rate-proposal.html

using technology related to

  http://rg.media.mit.edu/projects/homr/

with an architecture incorporating

  http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/rmr/TR/TR.html

and

  http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URI/URCspec/

We hope it'll be at least similar what IHPEG commits to, because it does 
a WHOLE lot more than just parental control.

I'm sorry Fred, but I can't help but say that Santa Cruz promoters 
aren't stupid!! I speak only for myself in saying this, but I see Cloud 
Factory, the SC family, and ourselves (Harmony) pull off parties all 
the time in Santa Cruz! So obiously, some of us down here are doing 
something right! I think it was just a matter of bad coincidence for 
XYZ. And they tried to make something out of nothing, (maybe the wrong 
way,) but they tried. Now, about the Dub Tribe party, I don't even know 
who the promoters were. But please, don't knock a whole city, because 
two promoters fucked up. There are some of us who bust our asses 
getting legal spaces for parties down here. Have you ever been to one 
of our parties? Maybe you should come down and check it out! 

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Greg

Actually, I should have made it clear I wasn't including Cloud Factory and 
the other local folks who have the right approach in my condemnation of 
the Santa Cruz promoters like XYZ and the clown who promoted last Saturday
night's disaster. 

If I had my druthers, someone *would* emerge as a good large-party promoter
in the Santa Cruz area.  Until then, the underground is the only place to be.

Here, I disagree.  I love the scene, but I've also seen it
drag people down.  How many kids do you know who go to
parties every weekend, drop out of school, hold crappy jobs,
and sell drugs on the side to make ends meet?  In the
midwest, at least, the answer is "too many."  There are kids
out there who don't have a place to live and float from
couch to couch and party to party.  Is this right?

I guess I feel that we are all partly to blame.  I know we
all want to have fun and I know we all want to escape having
to be "responsible", even for the space of an evening, but
the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of kids out
there who are in trouble.  

What do we do?

Side Projectors shot through color wheels work wonders.  I know they were
using color wheels, but whether it was slide projectors or computers I am
unaware.  There were at least 5 color wheels which leads me to think it was
slide projectors.

I should mention...  It's desert,  VERY DRY,  therefore bring at least
2 gals of water per day per person.   It is,  however a 25 minute ride
into Gerlach,   but because of the dryness,   you will be drinking LOTS
of water....   You'll also need it for washing,  there is NO running water,
but there are hot springs nearby...  I know of two of them...  Most people
usually hang out there during the heat of the afternoon.

You will also need a compass.   Unless you are in the center of camp,
where they have lantern beakons for the 4 points of the compass,   if
you situate your camp in the outskirts of Burning man village,   it
can save you lots of time,  trying to locate your camp at night,  or
even in the day.   Learn how to use it...   It might not be a bad idea
to put a light "beacon" on your tent at night...

Another thing,   don't rely on large busses, vans,  and other moveable
vehicles as landmarks,  they move around a lot.

If you have an airplane,   just fly right on in...   VFR rules apply,
of course...   :-)

See Ya all there,   hopefully with a good internet connection... I've
voluneered to help set up a link.   I have one of San Jose's chief radio
engineers and myself working on the problem.   See me if you really think
you can help.   Right now,  we need some good high gain UHF antennas,  and
Microwave equipment.   Right now,  we are analysing topo maps,  determining
which repeater sites can get a "hit" into the Playa.

I'll report later on the feasability.   My friend has some very powerful
digital radio repeaters,  mostly in S. Calif,   but some of these are on
mountains so high that they can reach well into N. Calif and Nevada.

If the S. Calif repeater can hit a repeater that can hit the Playa,  then
we'll have a 24 hr/ day 64kb connection.   We're keeping our fingers crossed.

My friend and I might fly out there sometime next week to check out the
area in person.

If we get this internet connection,  be looking out for some killer
"On the scene" reports.

I wasn't there are Area 51 -- my $25 didn't want to depart from me.  
Damn! you can attend more than 3 "Come/Unity" with that kind of robbery.  
Anyhow the visuals was probably done by Synergy.  They are a two man crew 
and the software they use are homemade.  Can't buy it at egghead, but with a 
little knowledge of C++ and math alogorithms, one can make over $1000 a 
night.  What it takes a month of flipping burgers, one can make the same 
overnight.  Go figure!

The only thing I can think of to do is to set an example for these kids.  
Show them that we still have *alot* of fun and can escape responsibility 
for an evening, but at the same time hold down good jobs and support 
ourselves.  The ones who are in trouble won't get help until they ask for 
it and some don't even realize that what they are doing is self 
destructive. They have to burn out first and when they realize they have 
nothing to show for all those years, then they may ask for help. It's up 
to us to be there for them when that time comes.  C'est mon avis.......

love,
Amy

It was NOT me.  I was sitting here, numb, at work,
in a sort of allergic, sneezy, hazy-headed stupor,
at least until I got this message...

Then a bunch of energy hit me in waves - Mike's
energy, and YOUR energy (to that same mysterious person/people).

Sending energy out !! This idea really brought me out of
my haze and made me remember that I can TRANSmit too!
(I've been so stuck in the drudgery of "submit", "commit,"
"remit", "omit"...)

Thanks, Mike, for your message - it really gave me back
myself. I'm broadcasting some energy of my own, now -
if it comes through to you all in a sort of strobe-effect,
don't worry, it's just working around my sniffles!

Love,
Rhea

Well, it's not me. In fact, whoever it is that's tipping the scales
in Mike's favor, please balance them out a bit towards me.

I woke up this morning when a large black spider decided to run across
my face. Really and truly. Not a fun way to wake up. At least it didn't
bite me ...

Well, you should check out Harmony's 2 year anniversary on Aug. 11th.  
We are not BIG (like FTT, Wicked, etc), we are just a bigger than 
average family. In my opinion you can't beet that!! We don't ever 
charge more than $10, where as people say our parties are worth more. 
We just believe that it isn't right to charge more than that!! For this 
party we are going all out! If you want some info on it call 
(408)486-9591 or (408)450-3044 Maybe you should come down to the south 
bay and see what we can do! Hey, then you just might have to come 
again!

Peace, love, and harmony to all!,

Greg

HELLO!  (Big *SMILE*) =)

It wasn't me with all the good vibes early this morning when Mike felt it,
but it's hit me and I'm working on giving out a bit of my own that's since
emerged.

I've been reading the list silently for a while now, but today I figured
I'd break my silence and try to release this wave of happiness that's been
building inside.

Just an hour ago I finished up one stage of a project I've been working a
year on and sent it off to my advisor in Scotland.  It's out of my hands
(temporarily) and I am so relieved.  Whew, these past few weeks of 12 hour
days in a lab are over.  YiIPPEEEEEEEEE YAAAHHOOOOOOOOOOO!

So I suggest everyone try to capture and feel whatever positive energy may
be floating about.  Take a pause, think about the last really great
positive experience you had.  How did you feel?  Close your eyes, try to
rekindle that feeling.  Now scrunch up tight all the muscles in your body
and hold it, now release in a big stretch and a smile.

Thanks to Mike for "wake up" (maybe it was _you_ all along).  

Now TAG, you're it.

Keep the energy flowing.

annie

  Sho brings up an excellent point, and one which has been
disturbing me a lot too.. But, unfortunately, it is not for us to tell
other people how to live, only to set a good example..

Also, it's important to remember that a little bit of 
"dropping out" may actually be good for society.. Those of us working
in areas that impact electronic commerce can see that in a few years, as
the impact of some of these new technologies really sinks in, there will
probably be a huge shrinkage in the number of people who need to work
in order to keep the present level of economic activity going.
It will be possible then to build a society where people will only
have to work, say, three days a week. People who are dropping out voluntarily
may actually contribute to stabiliy, because there will almost certainly
not be "enough" jobs to go around. Voluntary simplicity or involuntary, it's
our choice.. (because we will be the ones running the show at that point.)

Fractint, Dazzle, Cthugha(does audio seeded image processing), thats a 
lot right there to learn, so have fun, also each one has come a long way 
since then. The software is readalily available, it's getting high 
quality video mixers that will really set ya back $$$, see ya

Just put up your antena and direct it towards Cupertino.  Here it comes.
Hold on....  There we go, got the right frequency.  I hope you get the

The morning is changing already.  The spider liked you and was just saying
hi! If he didn't, he would have bitten you.

Have a e:hug too.  <squish>

Dear All;

	I was looking through CD's I haven't listened to in a while, and
came across 101. Listening to their studio stuff, you would never know
they have such raw, primal energy in their live performences, but having
seen them in Philadelphia, many years ago, they are just fantastic. They
were the 1st to go all electronic, and are some of the fathers of the
electronic groove. So I'll ask my immortal ?, what ever happened to them? 
I'm told Depeche Mode is French for Fast Fasion, and they fit me just
fine!!!!

Well to throw my response into the pool, I have been extatically 
(sp?) happy for about 2 weeks now, constantly ever since I went 
visiting my friends in Santa Barbara. I had THE best time playing 
with them and spinning awe-inspiring music. I have had the constant 
e-smiles ever since. But today it climaxed for this morning I 
received email that they are coming here tomorrow so we can go run 
around the city all weekend and have some really intense happiness. 
Maybe I beamed a little too much and sent some of my happiness over 
the net via my SLIP!? Oh who knows and who cares as long as happiness 
prevails! I wish eternal happiness to anyone who just takes a minute 
to stop and close their eyes and feel the rush of pure energy that we 
can emminate if we all try! Who knows maybe I might see some of you 
this weekend and be able to share some of my happiness, a happiness 
that I have not known for 2 years when I chose to leave the scene. 
Well I don't want to take up too much bandwidth with my incessant 
ramblings so if you do feel the energy, just take a minute and 
breathe it in!!! You won't be sorry!!!

Luv ya all! ;-}

Hmmm...well I didn't wake up with a bunch of energy, because I never 
really went to sleep.  I just had WAY TOO much positive energy!!!  It was 
really great (especially since I had a final today).  I danced the night 
away at a great club down here and when it came time for beddie bye, 
sleep didn't seem very important (of course I was coming down from X too 
so).  I don't think it was me (though I am sure I released tons of energy 
last night and took it in from all my fellow ravers), so a big thanks to 
whoever it was.  I think I am gonna swim a couple laps...have fun y'all.

I agree with Brian.  The content is only so-so, but the concept is amazing.
It is a totally trashy piece of upper middle class white kids
pretending to be poor while living in a house on the Beach in Santa Monica?
(Okay, one is "hispanic" or something that i dont really see in persona or 
physique) 

Standard hollywood script writing. 

Point is.  The idea of an interactive story where you can suggest
plot lines, get response from characters, talk to them live on IRC, etc etc,
is damn well incredible.

"Tara" the person who seems to be in charge of the project went up to 
SF to do a little demonstration of it at the "Anon Salon" at a 
benefit for the Climate Theater (??? this is second hand)
And she did a demo of The Spot for the people there... 
(whatever that means)

I dunno, i think the point here is, is that people shoudl take this idea
and run with it.  THIS IS ON THE WEB.  Not a TV/CABLE STATION.  A lot 
of people have access to broadcast similar things.  It's like being
able to print a Zine, cuz you've got $10 and access to Kinko's
except this is more high scale.

(Notably, people who havent been brought up in schools where they
are taught to use computers, or who don't have access to computers
because of monetary access are therefore not able to distribute information,
and i, personally, like to keep that in mind:  The audience and the publishers
of any thing are going to be biased because of that.)

(oh great... my first post in like six months, and i coudlnt
figure out how to squeeze some rave bs in here.. :)

YYYEEEEAAAAHHHH!!!!!  What a pumpin day this is! :) How can you make a bigger 
smiley face to beam out across the net.  We are coming to the city this 
weekend, I decided last night, we are running away from Santa Barbara.  I have 
the most insane bass pumpin', I've been spinning, in many ways, and I am 
absolutly estatic.  Went to bed last night in kind of a funk, and woke up this 
morning funky.  Thank you all for everything.  What an incredible community 
this is.  I can't even express in words how incredible I feel today, everyone 
must be beaming out to everyone else at the speed of light.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU

Hope to see some of you this weekend.  We are going out tomorrow night.  We'll 
be the ones with the e-eating grinns on (much better than the other kind).  
Love you all!!!!

So much for the bandwidth, and words are simply failing to express how 
incredible I am feeling at this moment.  So I just beam out to all of you!

LoveAnais

   This may be the fullest weekend I've had in the calendar - a total of
   11 events Friday and Saturday, plus the weeklies, plus Renewal on
   Sunday and Jack's House on Wednesday. On Friday, Stompy features the
   killer Chicago combo of Derrick Carter and Mark Farina, Frequency 8
   returns with another outdoor party, Komotion stars SFR's Ethan and Joe
   Rice, and the other parties also have hot lineups. Spend Saturday
   afternoon in the light at Light! then catch DJ Pierre at Wicked (last
   year's visit caused quite a stir) or mu-Ziq at All Together Now, then
   spend another afternoon at Renewal on Sunday.
   
   I'll be off at Siggraph next week, but I think I'll be able to log in
   and send the calendar from there.

Hi everyone...I'm hoping someone can help me out with more info. In the 
calendar preamble, Derrick mentioned something about Ethan and Joe Rice 
(2 favorites) at Komotion on Friday, but I couldn't seem to find anything 
more about this event in the listings. Anyone know more? Joe? Ethan?  
I've had two solid weeks of nothing but work and would love to make it 
out to hear some *great* music Friday, if I haven't collapsed by then.

Many thanks!

Kathryn

Does anyone know the admission price for ALL TOGETHER NOW this weekend?

I'd love to see mu-siq live, but with info lines in 3 area codes, this 
could be a pricy one...

Anyone know?

Well, Come-unity was as loud, thumpin' and crowded as expected, but for some
reason (beyond my understanding) it didn't have that "feel". 
 I don't know, maybe its the vacation I've had or an overdose of outdoorsy
mellow intimate parties like Freq. 8 and New Moon.  It seems to me that
Comeunity has gotten too big for its britches (at least space-wise).  Hard to
dance, and it gets way hot only after a few mins. on the floor.   


(the 25$ parking citation I found snugly placed on my windshield didn't help
either =p )

Smiley meter:

             Vibe:       8Smiles (still had the hittin' tunes)
Dancin space:       5Smiles (after 2Am, it was a mosh pit)
 Hugz'n'grins:       6Smiles (this too depreciated the night progressed)
    Eye candi:        7Smiles(the dance floor had disco visuals but
downsrairs had some OK trancy effects)

Overall:  6.5Smiles =) =D => =D =) =D =&  O.K.

paz y amor

Adam, although I usually agree with your party SMILEY METER, I beg to
differ on its reading for C/U.  I thought the vibe was very thick all
night, lots of smiles, and lots of unity esp. @ the end of the party.

BTW, did anyone go to the new Thursday night weekly: Anarchist Disco
at 111 Minna?  How was it?

Peace and love

I know what you mean, I got there relatively "early" (around midnight)
It was really clubby which in itself isn't too bad but to top it off
there was a serious lack of "vibe generators" and "strange atractor"
you know, the people that just exhude the vibe and are a joy to look at and
see them on the dance floor.  I kept regressing into thinking about Come-Unities
of days past, which is a bad sign since I always feel that one must look forward
and do whatever it takes to my the party that you are at right now the one to
go off.  But unfortunately I didn't have any friends to snap me out of it
so I would up leaving fully intending to come back but ended up hacking at
Virtual Sites instead.

I'm not sure how much this party will be, but I'm sure it will be
worth it.  The promotor has already spent over $17,000 and put a
great deal of work into it.  u-zig themselves cost $3,000.  3 rooms,
live acts, fire dancers...  It ought to be fun.  And All Together Now
has it coming because at their last party where they went all out, 65 people
showed up and they lost tons, but they kept a positive attitude so those
65 people had an awesome experience.

Hope to see many of you there...

FLAME ON

Well I can only say that I had a great time, the music was great, I went with
about 15 of my friends.  Took a friend who turned 40 that day out for his first
party, and he had a great time.  We've been doing C/U for a couple years and
this
was as usual a really good vibe.  Quit your whining and your complaining.  A
party is only what you make it.  To really truthful I am really tired of
everyone
complaining about every little thing that doesn't feel like it used to, who
is better, and hearing shut up your stupid.  This list has really started
getting
me down as of late.

FLAME OFF

Ron.

Oh, what a cheap scolding you give, Ron Nikel.  In one sentence you say,
"Quit your whining and complaining," and almost immediately thereafter
YOU say, "I am really tired of everyone complaining about every little
thing."  The postings you were referring to weren't whining in any sense
that I see, but your rejoinder sure is.  

Or would you rather have it that nobody should say anything here not
totally positive.  Whining is one thing, telling it like you really
saw it is quite another.  I'll tell you this much, after going to
Come/Unity off and on for three years, I'm disappointed but not
surprised to hear Geoff's comments.  You couldn't ask for anyone more
positive about the scene and especially about Come/Unity than Geoff,
and yet, what do we hear in response to his honest reaction to the
party this week but "quit your whining."

As for what YOU are getting tired of, I have only one piece of advice:
practice what you preach.

Flame off, indeed.

peace out
phred

well SAID PHRED!  The scene does change.  The only thing that is good to 
the last drop is Coffee.  The scene has its cycles.  Some of my friends 
are in the spinning cycle.  Others are drying off.  And myself, I am in 
the folding stages...I am too tired to whine, let alone Flame off.

'Peace in'

As with most of Bog's latest parties, expect a $20 price tag. And figure 
that it'll probably be at Big Heart City.

And unless it's a new alias, Mu-ziq has no jake Slazenger. Mu-ziq is Mike 
Paradinas, period. So far I haven't been able to find out whether this is 
the real thing or some "The Mu-ziq Experience" rip-off. Depending on 
their involvement with the planning, some of the other DJs (especially 
Jonah) should know the difference.

If it *does* turn out to be the real deal, the Mu-ziq boat show back in 
April rocked.

I'll try to find out some more. jmar.

Subject: Dubtribe/Santa Cruz...
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


  i'm at work and i just finished reading a short blurb in
Good Times (a weekly news/entertainment guide in Santa Cruz).
anyways, i thought the article was kind of interesting...

  the article mentions a DJ contest that took place at the
  Blue Lagoon.  It then goes on to say..."DJ David Anselmo
  and DJ Deep Fog took top honors, winning guest spots 
  spinning with Dubtribe.
    But when the time came for the clandestine rave at a 
  secret North Coast beach, says the UAG (Urban Artists
  Guild), Dubtribe 'dissed Santa Cruz,' taking advance
  ticket sales monies and leaving a hord of eager
  rave-goers to suffer dispersal by sheriff's deputies
  from a Davenport meeting place.
    'There were masses of cars out by the eucalyptus
  grove near the concrete plant, all with their 
  headlights on,' related DJ Steve K after the 
  rave-that-wasn't. 'A lot of people went home pretty
  angry.'"

 when i read the posts about this party, earlier in the 
week, it sounded like the promotors were at fault.  
however, it appears as though they are placing the blame
on Dubtribe.  i really doubt Dubtribe would 'dis Santa
Cruz' and 'take advance ticket sales monies'...
  anyways, i'm not sure what my point is anymore...i guess
i just wasn't expecting to read about this in the local
entertainment guide...

  by the way, does anybody know who the UAG is?  are they
responsible for attempting to throw that party????  just 
wondering....

thanks-

I probably shouldn't have teed off on Ron as much as I did.  Especially
as someone who's put in a fair share of concern about where things are
headed with this scene-such-as-it-is.  But Come/Unity was really really
special, in fact, it was rather important in the early history of this
list and the people here.  On the one hand, it's hard to see things
sliding downhill when they really were so great, on the other things
never can or should stay the same.  Overall the energies of the underground
scene that briefly surfaced in the clubs in SF in 1991-93 have dissipated
and there is kind of a plowing under and reseeding going on right now.
The music is still there, but the scene is not.  

There *are* a ton of us out there who learned from the first wave and
are riding along on the second.  The small parties and gatherings and
planning being done around the Bay Area have sustained the vibe and sent
it in a new direction.  It's less glamorous than the big blo-up of the
early '90s but that's probably better for us anyway.  If you want to see
where glamor goes, just read DJ magazine.  

But even in the UK, there's still a strong underground, as indicated in
an interesting article in the new Mixmag (the one with Goldie on the
cover).  It's trance-oriented music, it's underground and semi-legal
parties, it's people doing it because they want to, not because they
are making pots of money off it, in short, it's very much like what
we're doing too.  And I'm sure this is true the world over when you
dig under the flavor-of-the-season superficial aspects of the scene
and find out what people are doing outside of the massive parties.

I loved Come/Unity in 1993 but you know, it didn't happen every night
or even every week, even if in a moment of nostalgia it seems like it
did.  I searched through dozens of hit-and-miss events before finding
Come/Unity and the other good events of that time, the only difference
now is I have a bit more of a success rate based on that experience.
We've got Sunset, F&F, MESS, Frequency 8, New Moon and a bunch of other
regular or occasional gatherings to choose from, and they're all good
in their own different ways, and sometimes they achieve that greatness
we're always looking for.  Kinda hard to imagine a better situation,
really.  

I don't think for the most part that people on this list whine or

Browsed around http://www.gold.net/users/bt22/ (Nicholas Saunders' site)
and found some interesing comments. Note that I still don't advocate taking
X nowadays just because it's like playing russian roulette (e.g. see
http://www.gold.net/users/bt22/pillstilJuly.html) in more ways than one...

I guess it's clear that as with anything else, there are strong positives
and strong negatives. (note pre-emptive flame extinguisher).

For example:

http://www.gold.net/users/bt22/psychological.html:

| Interview with a psychiatrist about psychiatric
| dangers of Ecstasy
| 
| I have always warned that the greatest danger of taking Ecstasy is
| psychological. For my new book, I have interviewed Dr. Karl Jansen of The
| Maudsley Hospital, one of the very few researchers in this field and a
| psychiatrist who specialises in drug related psychiatric problems. Here is
| an abbreviated version of my interview with him:
|
| [[...]]
|
| What about depression?
| 
| Depression and mania definitely can be triggered by Ecstasy if you are
| predisposed. MDMA lowers serotonin, and low serotonin levels have been
| linked with depression and suicide in some studies (not of MDMA users). The
| effect of many antidepressants (e.g. Prozac) is to increase the action of
| serotonin. In very simple terms, antidepressants have the opposite effect
| on serotonin action to MDMA. There are thus theoretical reasons to propose
| that MDMA use will show an association with depression and possibly
| suicidal thoughts, though this association has not been established as yet.
| 
| Are people with strong self image more likely to have problems?
| 
| No. The more strong minded people are, the fewer problems they will
| have. Its the neurotic, anxious people who have a lot of fantasy anyway;
| already have sleep disturbances; have a very high imagery level; an unhappy
| family background. . . these are the people who are likely to suffer
| adverse consequences.
| 
| How should people deal with such problems?
| 
| If a person has anxiety or depressive disorder related to MDMA use, they
| should seek treatment. The options are cognitive-behavioural therapy [where
| the goal is to alter behaviour through finding underlying causes],
| psychodynamic psychotherapy [an insight oriented Freudian-based therapy
| which aims to understand what is going on] and anti depressants such as
| impramine and fluoxetine [Prozac].
| 
| If they have delusions, their friends should take them to a GP who should
| be asked to refer them to a psychiatrist. They will probably be treated
| with an antipsychotic medicine such as haloperidol. This is a more pleasant
| route than going directly to a General Hospital where a less sympathetic
| attitude may be encountered.


==============================================================================
http://www.gold.net/users/bt22/religion.html

| [...]
|
| The rabbi had more positive views about youth drug use. "Traditional
| religions have lost the ability to provide followers with mystical
| experiences. Instead, young people are far more likely to have such
| experiences while on LSD and Ecstasy." Most religious leaders, he said,
| were against the use of drugs because of their own ignorance. "If priests
| really want to understand young people they should take drugs
| themselves. Then they would learn that MDMA can produce the same quality
| and potential value as other mystical experiences." But is taking a drug
| really as effective as years of devotion? "It can be seen as cheating, but
| it gets you to the same place."
| 
| My third interview was with Bertrand, a Rinzai Zen abbot in his early
| seventies. He started taking Ecstasy while he was a Zen student undertaking
| Koans, tasks such as understanding the sound of one hand clapping. "My
| master would give me such a task, and tell me not to come back until I
| understood it. Normally this took hours or even days of contemplation, and
| even then I would be told to go away and try again. But on Ecstasy the
| answers came swiftly and clearly. My master was most impressed though I
| never told him the secret of my success." Bertrand felt that Ecstasy had
| genuinely helped him on his rise to becoming an abbot, but admitted he once
| misused the drug. He was teaching a large group of students, neatly bowed
| before him in their black robes, while under the influence. "I feel no
| energy from you", he scolded, "You are like rows of corpses": an honest
| comment, but one that did not help the students, rather it made them feel
| put down.
| 
| Bertrand had never experienced dancing on Ecstasy, but he was curious and
| accepted my invitation to a party. He found the music unbearable at first,
| but eventually his face glowed and he announced "This is meditation  to
| be truly in the moment and not in your head!" He later explained that the
| object of meditation was to cease the internal dialogue and yet be fully
| aware of what was happening, and that is exactly what the dancers were
| doing.
| 
| Next morning Bertrand said he had had a revelation: his school of Zen
| concentrated too much on the contraction such as disciplined meditation,
| but what was really needed by most students was the opposite, to let go and
| expand in the way he had just witnessed at the party. Two weeks later he
| told me that he had just given the best meditation course of his life as a
| result: instead of strict discipline he encouraged the students to open up
| and have fun.
| 
| Lastly, I interviewed a Soto Zen monk, also a teacher of meditation, called
| Pari who said that his school of Zen was the only one that acknowledged the
| value of drugs: his master had used LSD and MDMA. "Ecstasy is a wonderful
| tool for teaching. For example, I had a very keen student who tried hard to
| meditate but never managed; Ecstasy allowed him to do so without the
| 'trying' blocking his efforts. That one experience helped him to make fast
| progress, and he had since been ordained a monk."
| 
| Asked about how Ecstasy helps achieve enlightenment, Pari made this
| analogy: "It is like a climber walking in the mountains who is lost in the
| fog and unable to see the peak he has set out to climb. All of a sudden the
| fog clears and he experiences the reality of the peak, and gains a sense of
| direction.  Even though the fog moves in again, and its still a long, hard
| climb, this glimpse is usually an enormous help and encouragement."

Well, reading the thread to this point has inspired me to put my two 
cents in finally!  I do have a good suggestion (for those of you who 
have not tried it) as far as trying drugs is concerned.  I've found 
that a real good place to find out "just exactly what the facts is" 
about what you're doing is to look up your specific drug in the 
Physician's Desk Reference.  They spend a lot of time going into what 
the drug is for, the various ways it can affect you, and a lot of case 
studies where different results are all documented there.  No rumors 
floating around in this book, all hard-core facts!  I consider to be 
quite reliable when you're looking to see just how screwed up a 
particular drug can make you in its after-effects.  

Basically all I can say about drugs (I joyously take them myself and 
don't regret a single hit, trip, or experience I've ever done or had) 
is that I've found I have to take a very practical point of view when 
it comes to them.  I do it purely for entertainment, just as I would go 
to a movie, go on a camping trip, etc.  And just like a camping trip, a 
certain amount of practical planning has to go into it to make it a 
really great experience.  I always make sure there's nothing I have to 
worry about (i.e. wearing jewelry I might lose while tripping, making 
sure all my important shit is in one place and easily accessible and 
difficult to lose, and surrounding myself with people I love while 
experimenting with unknowns).  I really do believe I owe it to 
practicality that I've never had a bad trip (knock on wood!) so far.  A 
lot of people I've know don't seem to feel that these things deserve 
any concern, and some bad shit has gone down because of it.  (god this 
is starting to sound preachy!)  I guess it's not drugs I have any 
problems with, it's the people who have no idea how to handle them that 
I have a problem with, like how you don't blame the car but rather the 
drunk driver behind it.  And I totally agree with all the things that 
were said by the guy who first started this drug thread!  

I hope this post doesn't sound too stupid, but it's a point of view I 
wish more people had, they'd enjoy themselves a lot more and would 
probably have a lot less of a moral problem with drugs I think if they 
did.  So all you happy drug-users, bone up on your Physician's Desk 
Reference (no need to buy, just sneak into your local book store and 
sit and read about the drug of your choice, and put it back!), take 
care of your shit, and have fun!

Well first of all, it doesn't feel like it use to, but then I don't expect
it to. I'm almost 39 now and I've been doing this for the last 4 years, this is
not boasting, just a fact.  The Scene does change, some for the better some
for the worse, it definitely doesn't have that innocent LUV PHASER force
that it did 2 or 3 years ago but all good things come to and end.  I think a
lot of the people who were really part of the scene then are trying to take the 
lessons and connections and friendships that were created during that time
and build something lasting... (in cyberspace ? :)  

Come/Unity always was and always will be special in my mind, whether it
becomes the beacon of light that it has been or even if it closes it's doors.

Perhapse a little history is in order here,  You guys out there who know the
real deal please correct any miss information.

Come/Unity was a party originally started by Martin, Simon,Garth, Jeno and
Malachy.  I'm not really sure about the exact players or times but I do
remember at least the involvement of Mal in the parties I went to.  Mal
was a very special person, I'm not going to go into the details here, they
are all on the hyperreal Website if your really interested, but suffice it
to say that Mal was a true "Evolutionary Agent", and the parties that were
held when he was involved were simply mind blowing when it came to the
"LUV Phaser Vibe".  He eventually decided to end the party thinking that it`had gotten too big and he wanted to do "smaller more intimate" gatherings.
The "Final Come/Unity" Was the first Tuesday in March of '93, Mal's
accident was the Full Moon of that same month.  A large party was thrown
in the Richmond Civic center planned by many of the various rave posse'
and promoter groups to be a benefit for Mal and to try and focus all of the
healing energy of the SF FAmily as a whole,  it was most likely the largest
Come/Unity ever held and indeed it was an amazing party and gesture.

The current Come/Unity is a re-incarnation of the previous one,  I'm not
exactly sure who is involved with this one but the DJ's are still Jeno,
Simon, and Garth.  The music is often kickin but it is really crowded
now and it is hard to find a place where you can really d/trance, which is what
It's all about for many of us.

At the earlier Come/Unity's I've seen people's live's altered on the
dance floor I'm sure it still happens for some, that is the amazing
thing about the Scene. No matter how gnarly it get's for you and your
experience, there is almost always someone who has a life transforming
experience at the same party, for some of us who go out, part of
getting the job done is to beam out the energy, even at a shitty party,
for those receptive beings who may be in the right synchronistic
co-ordinate in their life that they can receive it and and "feel the
vibe" so to speak. It is very hard to do this year after year, party
after party, and it eventually wears the best of us down.  I think the
Scene here is in a gestation period.  Outdoor parties like Sunset, Light
and the FMR are tools that people who want to do this can use to
recharge their batteries.

So far this summer has been amazing, I'm not looking back from the point
of view that "boy, it ain't what it used to be", it's true, it ain't, but
we all have to look to the future and make tomorrow the world that many of us
got a glimpse of in '92.

I didn't go to C/U in 91-93. I didn't know Malachy.  I went to C/U 3
days ago.  I had loads of fun.  I thought it was an excellent party.
I even enjoyed the fact that there were lots of people and that
dancing consisted simply of jumping up and down.  So maybe in 1999
I'll be thinking that C/U was more fun in 1995.  But I intend to enjoy
it for what it is now.  And that's what C/U will mean to ME.  Again,
that's just me...you are quiet welcome to romanticize the past.

But now seriously, there IS a good vibe out there.  I can't compare it
to the vibe you guys felt 3 years ago (because, again, I didn't go to
C/U in 92).  But you can't tell me that what YOU felt 3 years ago is
better than what I am feeling now.  It might be the case that my
perception of the current vibe is similar to what you had experienced
3 years ago.

So things get boring after a while.  What else is new?  Maybe it's
time to do something else?  :) ?  Let me recommend restoring MGs.  Or
inline skating?  Jazz?  Maybe polo?  It's a great rush!  (If you are
interested I can point you to appropriate mailing lists ;)

Peace and love

Sho,

we are not all partly to be blamed for someone's misdirection.  If you 
send positive energy at a party than the only thing others will recieve 
is positive energy.  If someone is going to waste themselves don't 
think its because of raving.  They could find it through alcohol or 
speed just as well.  I've met tons of people wasting away who never 
went to raves.

Raving does not have to be an escape of responsibility.  Tribal dance, 
family, music, and the release of your soul are absolutely necessary to 
live a balanced life.  In many ways raves help people become more 
responsible.  I really think those irresponsible people you spoke of 
would be that way even if they did not rave.

Hi Brian,

I am having trouble reaching Andrew D. The adress you gave me (unless I 
wrote it down wrong) was soundgod@iccse.com.   the mailer couldn't find 
this adress.  I than tried soundgod@iccs.com and it gave me some weird 
response.  Do I have these adresses correct?  thank you very much.

love chris

DRUGS AND CULTURE; CULTURE AND DRUGS
The two are interchangable.  Because the kind of culture you are 
sociaslized in will have a great effect on how drugs effect you and what 
your drugs of choice will be.  For example, is any coincidence that me, a 
middle class male from London, is a complete pot head; why, for example, 
have I never taken heroine or pharmacuticals or speed or coke and yet 
been tripping and e-ing since 18?
And this is also a big factor that one should consider when taking a new 
drug: do I like the poeple in this culture, do I respect and like their 
values, do they make me laugh?  All these factors should be intially 
considerd when the individual is straight.  And think about it hard 
because if you like the drug you will know what stage you will be at it 
in six months time.  Just food for thought for 2 cense.

Yes, they are/were a good band (even though there last album had some week 
songs on it).  It's funny you know, they were living and recording all 
there albums in the house I lived next door to in London.  I went in 
thewir a few times to see their studio: awe inspiring, equipment with the 
power to do thing's you have only ever dreamed about.  And it was being 
operaterd by people who really knew what they were doing; th results of a 
lifetimes dedication.  Also, one of them bought my house which turned out 
to be a nice little earner.  Definatly one of my favourite bands (notice 
that there're British?).

        The event takes place the weekend of the 19/20 August. I don't know
much about the 'wars' themselves, but there will be an afterparty on the
Sunday at Townsend. DJ's will be Darkhorse (natural music, the gardening
club) DB (Sm:)e Communications) Markie (Wicked) and myself. There will be
loads of multimedia performances and at least one of the robots will be
there.
        We will probably be putting some info on our Web Site next week
when the flyers are finished and DB gets into town.
        See you there....Jon Williams

And I missed it! I made the fatal error of lying down for a little rest 
last night before going out and woke up today. But thanks to all of you who 
kindly replied to my request for info. - I hope you had a terrific night out

Good morning everyone,
    I just woke up from last night's journey. I went to Frequency 8 
last night, and to be honest I was VERY impressed! Dispite the 
horrible, life threatening, drive and hike to the location, it was just 
beautiful. 
    The music was great, people were beautiful, and the location was to 
die for! I have to hand it to the Freq. 8 crew, they set it up great! 
They set up on the side of a cliff (on the beach), and used lighting to 
get this really cool effect! (I can't really discribe it, you had to 
see it!) I have one question for the crew, how did you guys get the 
equiptment down to the beach? I was having trouble just walking to the 
beach, let alone carrying speakers! 
    In total, good job guys!!! 

(see ya next time!) :)

Greg

Ps. Hello to everyone I met last night. And Mike L. I just stuffed your 
next mailer!!! So look for it!

Tristan or anybody who goes to the meeting:
Could you kindly fill me in on what you discussed at the meeting?  I 
won't be in SF today, but I may be able to attend Renewal tomarrow if it 
isn't too far away (like SC).

Also, has anybody tried subbing to the Burning Man mailing list?  I've 
tried, but got no response. I tried it off the web page.

Ah the discussion of how things used to be and how they are now. People 
in general tend to latch on to things, people, scenes and cultures and 
set themselves up for disappointment when it changes.  If you don't grow 
and change then you stagnate and rot in unhappiness - fighting a losing 
battle of "how it was".  Look at all these politicians trying to tell us 
that the 1950's were the ideal time for "family values".  There was sure 
alot wrong with the 50's as well such as very little civil rights for 
non-whites and women. Look at how we've changed since then! 

On a rave note, I entered the scene after it began "changing".  I 
arrived on New Year's Eve 92/93.  So I'm not "old school" enough to 
remember the costumes and Toon Town days, but I have been here long 
enough to feel like a significant part of this culture.  I can't look 
back at how it used to be, for I wasn't a part of it, but I'd like to 
think that I help contribute tremedous positivity and love to each party 
I go to and each person I meet.  Raving may not be the same, but it is 
still good!  I have met some incredibly wonderful people and been to 
countless mind blowing parties since I came into the scene in 93. If it 
weren't great, I would have gotten bored and dropped out.  Being the 
*same as it used to be* is not necessarily synonymous with *good*.  Just 
go with the flow and as I always say: Change is the only constant. 
Be happy and you WILL be free.

love,
Amy

Are you sure you'll be lugging your record crate to the right club, Jon?  
According to the flyer (which is already out) it's at the Troc.  BTW, DB 
is a great DJ, I got to hear him in Vancouver.  Very versatile.

So, anyone know of a room available in a cool apartment. Thanks for any

Upon reading a previous post concerning the possibility that this Jake
Slazenger guy was a hoax and not really the one we know and love as Mu-ziq,
I was deeply disturbed and had to come down to the truth.  I went to the one
place I knew I could trust... the hyperreal.com web page.  I found the info
on Mu-ziq and here it is...

Q: Who is Mu-ziq?
A: Mu-ziq is a 22 year old from South London named Michael Paradinas.

...

Q:  What other names does Michael Paradinas use?
A:  Mu-ziq, Tusken Raiders, Jake Slazenger, Gary Moschles

Weehee, our dilemma was solved.  These are all one and the same and the world
is whole again...

So see ya at that little shindig...

hello all,

I came into the scene in Feb. 1994 so I'm not old school either.  I 
don't know if the scene was better in 1991 but I do know that it is 
exploding this summer!  I can't believe how many free outdoor parties 
are going on.  Pacific, Gateway, Newmoon, Fullmoon, Mother Earth, 
Frequency 8, parties in Marin, ect.  It is amazing!  It is impossible 
to go to all of them but they all continue to produce that beautiful 
family vibe that its all about.

Yesterday Crunchman told me that there was 12 parties going on this 
weekend!  I don't know if that included Sacramento but it is going 
through some growth as well.  I feel so lucky because for the first 
time I have my weekends free and certain beautiful people are striving 
to bring us together.  I just keep growing and growing and growing as 
we keep growing and growing and growing.

love chris

Dispite turning some sfravers into arsonists I do what I feel.

And I feel that I gotta give props to another real nice Fequ. 8 event.  This
tyme around Id have to say that the guys went to great lengths to pull off a
good party, even when the speakers blew.

Everyone was (as usuall) in that friendly sociable mood and although I stick
to the floor ,er, beach, (i should say) i did drop off the vibe train to say
hi to a few.

Thanks go out esp. to the dee-jays who actually jump into the crowd and
mingle when not on thier sets.

Smile o meter:

             Vibe: 8Smiles (Im sure it gets better, just waiting for the
right event)
Dancin space: 9Smiles (a whole beach, how can you go wrong)
Dancin quality: 7smiles (a beach, if you stay in one place too long you
really do start sinking...)
Hugs'n'smiles:  8Smiles (when people you don't know jump to you and start
chatting, well, there's something right going on)

Overall:  A strong 8smiles

I'll try to see ya'll at 55  Natoma on sunday
peaces and cream....

 I just thought you may be interested in this bit of info from SRL,
regarding the Robot Wars from last year. I have a copy of the entire
article available at www.vmar.com/SRL_scam.html

A much better value (IMHO) $$ will be the SEEMEN show this Friday night at
the Trocadero. These are good sized machines in the SRL style, done by some
local (SF) artists, who I would much rather support.

forwarded text........

REWARD OFFERED for information leading to the whereabouts of Joseph
Matheny. Mr. Matheny was the producer for our last major performance,
A CALCULATED FORECAST OF ULTIMATE DOOM. He was also the
producer for the =84ROBOT WARS=BE event staged at Ft. Mason in SF in
August. He hired Mark Pauline, Liisa Pine, and Terry McGovern, from
SRL to build the protective railing around the machine presentation
area. He also arranged for the rental of one of SRL's forklifts for
5 days to set up and break down the event. Somehow the date for
payment kept slipping further and further away.


Originally, Mark Pauline was assured by Methiny that SRL would be paid
when the money was received from Robot Wars. When payment from Methiny
seemed in doubt back in September, Mark Pauline called the Robot Wars
owners, Mark Thorpe and Gary Pini, to advise them of the problems
encountered in securing payment from Methiny, and to see if a direct
payment to SRL from Robot Wars for services rendered could be
arranged.

Pini and Thorpe agreed that SRL was owed the $1550.00 but refused to
pay SRL directly, instead paying Methiny for work done by SRL. Methiny
then split town. Robot Wars intends to continue their commercial
presentations of =84popcorn machines=BE to the public on a yearly
basis. Admission was $30.00 a head for the August event with 1200
paying customers. In view of the insensitive way that an event as
flush with cash as Robot Wars dealt with SRL's relatively small
payment, Mark Pauline recommends that robot builders stay away from
future Robot Wars events.

I came to the scene in late 1991, early 1992 when I was 18. The Summer of 92 will 
always be remembered for its truly awe-inspiring vibe. I would go 
from Friday to Sunday night with no sleep, every single weekend for 
the year. It was incredible, it change my life in many ways that 
cannot be explained. I made so many friends, people that I could 
actually talk to openly without fear of repercussions. 
It became so much a part of my life that I actually somewhat 
abandoned the rest of it. I ended getting myself in a lot of trouble 
at home, work, and school. I couldn't fight reality anymore, in fact 
it seemed a lot of people felt the same way. All the people I knew 
slowly started to filter out of the scene. I held on as long as I 
could, but finally I left also. I started to put my life back 
together, cleaned myself up, found a job, got back into school. It 
took me up until a couple of months ago to actually get up the nerve 
to go to a party again. And I owe it all to my best friends in Santa 
Barbara, whom I love more than anyone, for dragging me out with them 
the July 4th weekend when they were in the city. I love you both big 
bunches!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =)
Now I feel like I have a balance once again. Anyway, my point is 
that from the few parties I have been to lately after my near 2 year 
sabbatical, the scene has changed a great deal. It will never be like 
it was back in 92. I went through a 3 month depression after leaving 
the scene in 93 cuz of the emptiness I felt without it. But the thing 
we have to understand is that everything evolves. Evolution can be in 
a good direction or a bad direction. A good evolution leads to higher 
forms of the original, bad evolution can lead to extinction in which 
case the chain starts over with something else. The important thing 
about parties is that they are only as good as the energy people are 
willing to put into them. Our scene is more than killer music, 
mind-opening drugs, and trancie visuals. It is a feeling! A feeling 
that we all share together such that when we see each other at a 
party and smile, there is twinkle in each other's eyes that says that 
our love, caring, and individual energy went into this to make this 
work! We love each other and the things we can do together! WE make 
this possible!
I think that when I left in 93 I had just depleted my energy beyond 
my scope of understanding. In my break I developed a life in the real 
world where I was happy. That was my mistake b4, I wasn't happy b4 
the rave came around. I started going and that became my happiness. 
The balance between reality and rave(party) must be defined for each 
of us in order to maintain stability. When there is no stability, 
there is no central point to pull positive energy from, therefore 
making us erratic and the balance tips.
Anyway, what I am trying to saying is that our life is what we make 
of it. Parties may not seem to be the same or have the same vibe as 
they used to. That is true, but what we need to concentrate on is 
remembering the vibe and shaping our energy around that and letting 
other people experince it. Share your energy, you know the difference 
that can make! It is when negativity is introduced in a situation 
that things fall apart, dreams die, imaginations stop. Without the 
positive energy from all of us, we will never know how high we can 
travel or waht we can accomplish. We can never forget that.
I truly apologize for going off for so long, I get started and I just 
can't stop. But just do me a favor and think about what I said for a 
moment one day when you wake up in a funk. Trust me I did...

Luv to all who will listen! =P

[ To SFRaves mailist -  personal reviews of Sunset/Renewal , Nick
  Turner's "Hawkwind" concert , Karma at Big Heart City ]

 After a three week work-enforced absence from the "dance n' trance" 
scene , I was quite happy to don my black and yellowed checkered
shirt with the ecstatic face of Goofy (tm) on the front drive to
Berkeley to Sunset/Renewal. I got there a half-hour before
sunset - t'was so good to hear that house music and see/hear those
happy people again! ( Hello at Mike , Ameet , Philip , Rocky , and the
others ! ). Loren was spinning as the sun dropped below the distant 
ridge. [ Insert the usual warm fuzzy stuff about Sunset here ].
By the way - why Sunset & Renewal? I don't remember what history
is behind Renewal - is it new?

 I couldn't stay too long , as I was going to see Nick Turner at the 
Great America Music Hall in SF. After driving over the Bay Bridge to SF,
I managed to find some well-lit street parking a block from the club, 
and I bought a ticket from someone who had an extra. 

 It was a great concert! Loud , riff-repetious/hypnotic space metal 
music with Mr. Turner on saxaphone and flute. He played with other 
Hawkwind alumni Del Dettmar on synths ,Simon House on violin , and
Alan Powell on drums. The other folks in the band were from a group 
called Pressurehead, and a fellow named Len Del Rio on keyboards. 

 I suspect Mr. Turner is in his late forties , if that young. It seems
the older he gets , the more shamanistic he looks - Genesis P. Orridge
might find that encouraging! Anyway , I'm listening to the new CD with
same band member lineup as tonight's concert ( I bought it at the club
tonight ) , it's called "The Eternal Sky" by Anubian Lights , on the
Hypnotic/Cleopatra label. Very "world-music" rhythmic space trippy ambient 
so far - not as grungy as the concert , athough they were playing 
a lot of old Hawkwind stuff tonight. I recommend both the live concerts
by Nick Turner and the latest CD to those who like to dance n' trance
( and who don't have any prejudices against electric guitars ).

 After Mr. Turner & company , I drove to Big Heart City to check out
Karma , the new Sunday night weekly that specializes in "psychedelic
trance". I liked it! Nice clean sound ( even though it seemed that 
the music was slamming past the red leds at the mixer - I guess they 
turned down the input gain at the power amps ), nice clean club ,
nice clean restrooms. Music was very techno fast trance - DJ's were
Adam and Craig . Someone told me there had been a live performance 
earlier by "Ted" , and the little synths with chiclet keypads were
still interconnected on three tables when I got there at 1AM. 
Attendence was about 30 people .

 Bad aspect of this weekly is that the section of Mission Street that
Big Heart City is located at has street cleaning at 2AM in the morning.
Since Karma is supposted to be a 10PM to 4AM event , some care needs
to be taken in parking. 

 For some reason , Karma shut down at 2AM tonight , not 4AM as shown on
the flyer. I don't know if that'll be happening every Sunday night for
Karma or not. Still - if you like that trancy techno , be sure to check
this out! Usually , I'm not a hard techno/high bpm kind of guy , but 
tonight it felt right! 

 At one point I tried "dancing" with one of the i-beam pillars they 
have at Big Heart City - I tapped and slid the tips of my fingers over
the bumpy textured paint of the pillars , and the sensation from my
fingers seemed almost as "loud" as the music! Very mysterio ....

 See you folks later! ( Maybe Harmony ... ))

Pacific was able to give their ailing sound system a reprieve by teaming up
with Renewal for this weekend's party for a very wonderful time.  It
seemed to be a funkier crowd with a greater vpp (vibe per person) ratio than
the last few sunsets.  I liked the smaller size, about 200 while we were
there.  Hopefully, Pacific's recent decision to take things a little further
underground will have a lasting effect through the rest of the season.

I won't bore everyone with the usual cliche's about the beautiful music,
weather, bay view, naked person, etc.  One incident worth noting occured
when someone who was dancing suddenly collapsed and went into seizure or
convulsions.  The music was turned off and an ambulance was called.  He was
up and walking b4 medical aid arrived, but it was pretty scary for a while.

It made me wonder abou what the proper thing to do would have been if the
guy was taken out on a stretcher.  Do you crank up the music after he's
gone and just continue with the happy vibe like nothing happened?  Do you
end the party out of respect for the serious nature of the incident?  Or
do you play something solemn and ask people to conjur up some healing energy?

We left just after that at around 7:30 as the party restarted and continued
with the celebration of life.

This happened at a party in Kentucky.  It was a free outdoor camping
weekend with a big dj line-up (Interstellar Outback).  A woman that
many of us knew (she was a net-raver) od'd on heroin, and was taken
out in an ambulance.  She was flatlined a couple times, and none of us
knew what was going to happen.  After this, there was a big debate over
starting the music again or not.  No good answers were found.

Stopped by Azul@Casanova on Thursay.  Alfie and James were spinning the down
tempo soulful funky house. No one really dancing but its a nice place to hook
up, drink a beer, not too loud so you can converse, and its free.

Stompy was a classic King St. super sweaty jam.  Caught the end of John's set
-- I like him more and more.   Mark Farina's  steadily become my fave DJ and
its no wonder.  Derrick Carter didn't show so Mark spun most the night --
Chicago showman to the end that boy was on fire.  I actually tried to leave
around 6 but couldn't seem to stop dancing though I could barely wobble
around that last hour.  Good vibe though the energy seemed to be up and down
probably due to the heat and extra tourists this time of year.

Sunset was great as always and it seemed to have a little more of that old
vibe I remember.  The new sound system was sweet!  Got to make up for missing
John Howard's set at Stompy -- he spun some jammin triphoppy stuff that I dug
in a  fun, crazy set.  Great music, great people, and that beautiful bay we
live by -- ya gotta love it.

        Reply to:   RE>Dubtribe/Santa Cruz...

Hi Matt.

I dont know much about the UAG or what they do.  But from what I am told, the
people running it are a family from LA who just moved into town a few months
ago.  UAG and the little Hip-Hop shop next store have only been in buisness
for a few months now.  I've been into the shop a few times prior to the
Dubtribe show and everyone seemed pretty cool.   Untill the night of the
Dubtribe show.  Either they were way over they're head in trying to throw a
party or it was a big scam.

Maybe we can get someone associated with Dutibe or the MESS System to clear up
all the questions for us.  Can anyone help with that??

  i'm at work and i just finished reading a short blurb in
Good Times (a weekly news/entertainment guide in Santa Cruz).
anyways, i thought the article was kind of interesting...

  the article mentions a DJ contest that took place at the
  Blue Lagoon.  It then goes on to say..."DJ David Anselmo
  and DJ Deep Fog took top honors, winning guest spots 
  spinning with Dubtribe.
    But when the time came for the clandestine rave at a 
  secret North Coast beach, says the UAG (Urban Artists
  Guild), Dubtribe 'dissed Santa Cruz,' taking advance
  ticket sales monies and leaving a hord of eager
  rave-goers to suffer dispersal by sheriff's deputies
  from a Davenport meeting place.
    'There were masses of cars out by the eucalyptus
  grove near the concrete plant, all with their 
  headlights on,' related DJ Steve K after the 
  rave-that-wasn't. 'A lot of people went home pretty
  angry.'"

 when i read the posts about this party, earlier in the 
week, it sounded like the promotors were at fault.  
however, it appears as though they are placing the blame
on Dubtribe.  i really doubt Dubtribe would 'dis Santa
Cruz' and 'take advance ticket sales monies'...
  anyways, i'm not sure what my point is anymore...i guess
i just wasn't expecting to read about this in the local
entertainment guide...

  by the way, does anybody know who the UAG is?  are they
responsible for attempting to throw that party????  just 
wondering....

thanks-

First, let me say that regardless of the technical difficulties, Bog's 
party Sat night was quite amazing. I chuckled at the swimming pool idea 
only to regret not bringing a suit a couple hours later. Jonah nearly put 
me in the hospital by refusing to play a bad track and let me leave the 
dance floor (Hearing "Colin's Tamborim" and "testone" again was worth my 
money alone).

So while I still enjoyed the party, I have to say that the sound was some 
of the most damaging I've ever experienced. My ears are still ringing two 
days later. I didn't help that Mu-Ziq used high-pitched noise for 
transitions between tracks. I noticed at least a dozen people around me 
(including myself) covering their ears. I knew I should have brought 
earplugs. It'll be the last time I forget.

But the sound never should have been that bad in the first place. We've 
all seen (heard) how good and loud Bryce and Ethan's systems can sound 
without causing irreperable ear damage. Unfortunately, other promoters 
haven't been so enlightened and continue to light every red diode on 
every meter in the place.

we've talked about this many times before, and some folks have 
contributed some great information, but I'd like to get it off the list 
and in the hands of those responsible for the problem... and those who 
are unknowingly exposed to it.

If someone can write or compile any info on proper sound equalization, 
tinnitus, &c., I'd like to design a small informational pamphlet to print 
and pass out to people (and promoters). I don't want this thing to be a 
killjoy, but we know that great sound doesn't necessarily have to be 
damaging sound.

Hello everybody,

Wow, the Renewal/sunset party was great.  The soundsystem was not 
Pacific's, is that so?  I noticed a group standing around behind the dj 
that had also thrown a party up in the Marin headlands maybe a month 
ago. 

So is Pacific passing the Sunset torch to a new crew?  Personally, I have 
mixed feelings about this possibility, but I think that Javier and 
friends are great.  They seem very  positive, hopeful, together, 
ambitious and clean-cut, which is how Galen and friends always seem, 
too.  The clean-cut part is important because of having to get permits 
and deal with the authorities, as Galen's suave handling of security 
personnel has demonstrated many times.  

Welcome to the new kids, if you're listening.  New people coming in, 
throwing parties, keeping the music alive is what everybody with any 
sense wants to see.  


love,

Yeah, I hear you on this one (pun initially unintended).

But here's a great trick I learned at a live too much joy concert in Ithaca,
NY from one of my roomies...

(1) go into the bathroom
(2) pick a stall
(3) get some t.p.
(4) go back to the floor and stick some in your ears to taste.

now, you may look a bit funny, but if you're like me, you _always_ forget
those stupid plugs at home.  My ears won't ring using this.  Just be careful
cleaning it out later!

Peace,

I faxed the Good Times excerpt Matt posted down to Dub Tribe and
encouraged them to get in touch with the paper.  Perhaps I can get
them to write up a brief note for posting here on the net about the
situation.  I could relay what they've already told me but it might
be better to hear from them directly, so let me check into that.

I haven't been to a Wicked in awhile, but it seems to me that Wicked has
got this new look.  I think they set up King St. really nice also.  I
can't believe that venue can be arranged into so many different
possibilities. More fans, more speakers, more everything, even somehow 
more space.  Even a handy bubble in the middle of the dancefloor for that 
extra bounce.  I had an L.A. techno-rave flashback during a few songs, it 
was quite nostalgic.

this is actually not criticism, but an answer to it..kind of!

first of all, the new moon crew says many, many, many thanks to the 
following:

ethan miller	for speakers, cables, incredibly positive energy
		beaming out for miles around

joe rice	for playing, for the loan of amp, tables, cables, decks
		and also, for radiating positive energy and for
		bringing a friend with the same good vibe

gaby sankovich	for being absolutely amazing in every way.  this party
		could not have happened without you, honey.  this lady
		knows her stuff and can deal with crazy raver moon
		madness in all its forms. we learned so much from you
		last week!  

gregg helt	for keeping it all together, with duct tape

ronan		for being there, for playing, for comprehending the
		new moon vibe

hymns and anthems	a warm-hearted raver tribe that provided 
			brawn, brains, good spirits, encouragement
			and your very own dj-shaman

heather jones	for helping get us organized, for positive female energy

bio-jeff, ronan, cyril, joe rice, jim huckin, billie, kelly for playing

philip		for taping the party

billy sankovich	for transportation, for a level head, for good advice and 
		many thoughtful conversations

greg sankovich	for bringing his amp and cellular phone.  and also for
		having a good sense of humor

philip and gregg again...	for design and implementation of soon-to-be
				patented wind-proof plastic cup/tea-light 
				candles

since this is a party all of us did for the joy of it, i wanted to make 
sure that people got some credit for their contributions.  if i've left 
anyone out..due to ignorance or forgetfulness...i apologize.  please 
post yourself, if you like, to correct any oversights!


finally, i want to say that the new moon is a party we do for the fun of 
it.  to satisfy ourselves, our friends as well as  people we barely 
know.  we are 
NOT really a "crew" like Pacific or whatever...we are mostly a very loose 
group of people that like this party and come together once a month or so 
to listen to music and experience together a profoundly spiritual 
event...the completion and renewal of the lunar cycle.  we are not a 
church or cult or anything and people that come to the party can have a 
wonderful time without thinking about such spiritual matters at all.
HOWEVER, enough magical things have happened around this party to make 
even a dedicated hardboiled scientist such as myself respect the ongoing 
and evolving mystical nature of this gathering.

basically, what i'm saying is that if circumstances or poor planning 
foiled your attempt to make it to the New Moon in July, be 
grateful...because it's entirely possible that you should not have been 
there.  we did everything in our power to guide you.  some people made it 
to the beach that night against amazing odds...some people turned back at 
the parking lot, not realizing that we were only 3/4 mile down the beach 
and that those lights in the distance were our attempt to light the way.  
these difficulties do not reflect badly on anyone, by the way.

again, thank you everybody for making it so good,

ann

ps also a special thankyou to mona love in mississippi, who emptied the 
voice mail and allowed jennifer to find us at last

Here's a trick I invented at some concert or other (I don't know whether it
was really Yngwie Malmsteen or not. All those concerts are a blur for some
reason.)

(1) Bum some cigarettes
(2) Shove the filters in your ears

Funny looking, yes, but I like my ears too.

Hey everyone,

I hope you all had a great weekend.  I went to A.D. saturday night and
had a very cool time.  In spite of some technical difficulties early 
in the evening, the music and vibe were excellent.  Small crowd, modest
visuals but great price (only $4).

It's not a weekly so don't get scared away.  The next one is supposed 
to be on 8/18 and barring anything totally spectacular I'm gonna be
there again.  Yeah, hey for tribal and jungle.

Well, Lee, I can't remember exactly what time you left, but after the guy 
was able to get up, the music began again very softly and it was really 
mellow ambient stuff. The dj (I think it was Solar) kept it soft and 
mellow for awhile I think until after the ambulance left. I went for a 
walk at that time to keep warm and when I got back Loren was on and the 
sun was nearly set. By then the music had incredible energy and so did 
the crowd.  I think the incident brought us all together in a way: like 
reminding us that we are all in this together. I felt such *great* vibes 
- there were about 20 of us in a huge group hug, then we all formed a 
huge circle holding hands.  We were all really together that night.  I 
got to get a little closer to a couple of sfravers that day as well and 
that was very pleasant.  I won't see you all again til Friends & Family.
I'm going to Mount Shasta this weekend for some much needed camping.
As for the proper thing to have been done with the seizure incident - I 
think it was handled perfectly and respectfully.

love,
Amy

Correy, Mike and I went to MUSIC FOR MARTIANS on Saturday.  This was a
free party on a beach 17 miles north of Santa Cruz.  It was very
small: peaked at around 60 people @2am, and there were maybe 20 people
when we left @8am.  The music was excellent; the dj names I remember are
James, Tom, Wool, and Jason, all from Santa Cruz.  I especially
enjoyed James' and Tom's sets.  The vibe was incredible.  Most of us
were trancing all night.  There was some kind of magic in the air.
I fell in love with the Santa Cruz family.

I don't know who the organizers were, but they were really on top of
things.  They had a permit for the party and everything ran smoothly.
The only complaint one could have was that the generator died 2 or 3
times throughout the night.  However, they always got it started up
within 10 minutes.  I actually enjoyed the moments of silence: got a
break from dancing and it was nice just listening to the waves.

Now I'm too burned out to go to FMR :(   But I think it was worth it. 

Peace and love

Last summer I took rolls and rolls of film at Sunset in the Berkeley
Marina. Sorry I havn't had time to go this year :-( I've created a page
just for them. Please if you know who these people are please email me a
description of the picture and who they are as I would like put a
description with each one.
If you don't know who they are send me some mail telling me what you think
anyways, I want to know.  More should be getting put up in the next few
weeks as I have more of them scanned to photo CD.

Even though the 415 number says otherwise, apparentlly Housewares *isn't* 
selling tickets for it, which leads me to ask whether or not whoever 
originally suggested renting a bus to make the trip there and back is 
still commited.

Even though it's been heavilly fliered in downtown San Diego it looks to 
be a great event and would make for an even better road trip to end the 
summer on. Anybody else feel the same ?

[ to SFRaves mailist ]

 I was wondering if anyone here , especially the South Bay folks , have
any nostalgic thoughts about radio station 97.7 ( "Hot 97.7" ). It just
changed owners and formats lately , from "urban contemporary" to yet
one more KFOG style rock music dispenser. This change was made despite
protests from long-time listeners. 

 It seemed that every car with a monster stereo system was tuned to this
station. I never listened to it on a regular basis , but I knew a lot
of folks who did.

Not directly rave related,  though some consider the deadhead
scene to be kind of a sister to the rave scene.  I know that
some here would be interested to know that Jerry Garcia has
passed away.  I was never a fan, but a feel a sense of loss  for
one of our culture's psychedelic musical shamans.

On a more directly rave related note this also means that the last
Atomic Pig was indeed the last :(

Rest in Peace Jerry. Thanks again.

 And let's not forget those great times in the Oakland Colesium
parking lot - Atomic Rooster , etc. . 
 
 I'm also a raver who's a Grateful Dead fan , and I have mixed feelings
about Jerry Garcia's passing. In one sense , the travelling circus
culture that sprang up in association with the group , without the
group's encouragement, was in my opinion a life style dead-end. On the
other hand , I've had my share of spiritually positive moments
at Dead shows that rival many raves' "vibe". 
 
 So - I forsee ... massive Grateful Dead memorial shows where
DeadHead DJs mix vinyl and CD Grateful Dead music ( especially those
tasty bootlegs! ) . They never had a fancy stage show anyway , so
pre-recorded music would be just as well ... I'd go, if only in
memory of a man who gave my some great times in my life.

The big G died this morning, better tell Peter, ...and keep an eye on
'im, gonna be a lot of sad hippies today....I didn't think I'd give
a shit, but I'm actually a little awestruck, it's the end of an era
as it was the first regularly recurring large scale TAZ in modern
Amerikkka.  Fortunately, what with raves, the burning man and the
atomic rooster events, the torch has passed... anyway, thanks for the
pointer, Jerry...

whether you were a fan of the grateful dead or not (as i am), there's
  one VERY important thing they brought to society: a place where anybody
    at all could go and be completely free with their lifestyle, and 
      co-exist with thousands of people from other walks of life, with
        everyone having a good time.
there have been VERY few events in history where this sort of thing 
  was allowed to happen; social and racial strata always blocked the way.

raving certainly holds promise as a successor to this tradition; it's
  time for a change of guard, maybe...

it's quite possible that raving is one of the LAST REMAINING bastions of
  total freedom in music and celebration, if the dead are indeed gone
    (of course, i'm NOT gonna bury that band prematurely, they've had
      several disasters and recovered just fine)
...but just in case, the baton mite have been passed at 4am today...

        Reply to:   Narnia

I was the one who was thinking about arranging a bus to Narnia.  We've dedided not to do the bus because at this point we're not sure whether or not we have to go down a day early to set up.  Also the bus was going to be pretty expensive, and although quite a few people responded, there weren't enough to make sure we could definitely cover all the expenses.  If anyone is going to Narnia, we're going to be setting up a super chill pavillion so keep an eye out for us.  I'll post all the info as it gets worked out.
Also if anyone needs a ride, I know a couple of people driving down so let me know.  Also, if you're going and you have extra room, let me know or post it to sfraves - it's going to be a pretty incredible event and it would be cool to get as many of the sf crew down there as possible.
The Narnia posters just came out last week and they look pretty incredible.  I have a whole stack so if any of you sfravers want one, just let me know.

Partial lineup for Narnia (according to the poster):
Mark E. Quark
Dmitry
Robbie Hardkiss
Jeno
Garth
Jason Bentley
Jon Bishop
DJ Dan
Mark Farina

sfnarnia info: 415.437.4067

See you there!

Even though the 415 number says otherwise, apparentlly Housewares *isn't* 
selling tickets for it, which leads me to ask whether or not whoever 
originally suggested renting a bus to make the trip there and back is 
still commited.

Even though it's been heavilly fliered in downtown San Diego it looks to 
be a great event and would make for an even better road trip to end the 
summer on. Anybody else feel the same ?

	I heard an announcement on the radio (KPIG's Mr. Hedge) that both the 
Dead and the SFPD were discouraging people from going there...  "the PD isn't 
prepared"...  just FYI...

	Also there is a gathering at the Farmers' Market in Santa Cruz at (of 
course) 4:20.

Andrew

PS of course that may just have been a "responsible" way to announce the event 
itself on the radio...

Here it is a day early since I'm in LA and I don't think I'll have
email access tomorrow.  Harmony and United look good for this weekend,
maybe Plastik too if it isn't too big.  This connection at Siggraph is
slow so I'll stop there.  See you back in the Bay Area next week!

would someone please let me know why Re-groove-a-nation is still listed 
in the weeklies?

I have checked the location on and off for the past couple months, looked 
in the window, and its all empty andit looks like its abandoned.sp?

its probably time too take that one off the list.  Unless ofcourse there 
is really a superunderground event going on there that some santa cruz or 
monterey ravers can tell me about. But i doubt it.

anywa, if anybody has tried to check it out or know what happened to this 
weeklie leeme know!

thanks

Hello everyone,

    Well I have to say, everything is coming along great for Friday 
night. Contrary to a little rumor, we DO still have our original 
beautiful outdoor location. We have a couple of changes that need to be 
addressed.
    
    First as some of you know, Dj Dan is booked for two parties for 
Friday night, (Harmony + Common Ground in Sac.) His intentions were to 
spin at Common Ground, then drive to Harmony and spin, then drive to 
the airport to catch a plane. (All in the same night!!!) While that all 
might be possible with his time frames, we don't think it is a good 
idea. We think it would put too much stress on us, Common Ground's 
promoters, and especially Dan! So it is on a sad note that we say, Dan 
will not be performing at Harmony on Friday. :( He will still be 
performing in Sac. at Common Ground. :) 

    On a happier note, we are pleased to say that we have booked a 
replacement. Filling in for Dj Dan will be Markie, (Thank you Markie!) 
All other Djs, performers, etc. are still booked and comfirmed. That 
includes the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Djs: Brandon (solid grooves)
         Trent
         Markie
         Graeme
         Ethan
         Galen
         James
              + Live   E.B.E. Audio (solid grooves recording artist)

    Visuals: Michael Clay   and   E.B.E. Video

    Lasers: Hollywood Dog

    Chill area: The Crew

    Free H2O
                (And yes, still) $10 (with a smile)
***********************************************************************
*    Also, we are working together with Greenpeace, to provide a free * 
*info booth at the party. There has been a lot of concerning stuff    * 
*brought to our attention, (via talking with them,) that we want to   * 
*pass on to you. So please take home some info that we have put our   * 
*own time and money into providing for you. It is really important    * 
*that we all get involved with saving our home, our planet.           *
***********************************************************************

Directions will be posted on the voice mail #'s on Friday (7-8pm)

        (408)486-9591           (408)450-3044

    The location is about five minutes off one of the major bay area 
freeways. (So it's easy to get to!) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    We have many surprises in store for you! Feel free to bring tents 
(if you want,) toys, and anything else you want! Be sure to stock up on 
energy, cause you're gonna need it! Also, bring your best smiles, and 
lots of hugging juice!!! 
    
    Until then keep smiling and keep the vibe alive!!!!

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people!,

Greg

Ps. If you have any ?'s write to me or call the info lines!

Unless you know what you are talking about, don't say anything.  You could
have had a little fun with the rest of us aliens at AREA 51 and got in for
only $15.  You also could have donated a book for the juvi jail and
attended for $20.

I completely believe that we were absolutely fair with our price schedule.
By you infering that we were robbing the scene was a huge mistake.  Not
only did we spend over $42000.00 on production, which by the way included a
30 foot 2/3rd scale UFO, we spent our intire profits on a new renegade
sound system that we purchased and showcased last night at our Wednesday
weekly.  Which we put on for free last week.  Don't call us a rip off!  You
will probably be listening to it soon enough at one of our free parties,
and I still owe partial rent for August. We didn't just show up yesterday
to take the SF scene for all its worth.  I really shouldn't have to defend
Carlos and myself from this kind of onslaught.

When we first dicided to throw a big party we wanted it to be different.
We took 6 months to plan each one.  We put our heart and soul into it.
Were talking 100%.  There was nothing left to chance.  That's probably to
reason we don't get tagged.  people are too busy having fun.

So,  the next time you, Otis <steav@frodi.cs.uop.edu>, decide to talk shit,
make sure you were at the party you were thrashing.  If you were there I
might have been able to get some constuctive criticism.


Irritated that knowing something like this would happen,
dutch
CDC Soundsystem and DAMN PROUD OF IT!!!!

P.S. That goes for all you other shit talkers out there.  Throw your own
party JERKS!

The recent Cosmicbog party had an excellent sound system.  The reason for
the ringing in your ears is due to the reverberation of the sound off the
walls and ceiling.  You did notice that the main room was a basketball
court.  Do you remember the echo you used to hear in gym?  That is reverb.
Without something to kill the sound at the impact point, like foam, it will

CDC Soundsystem finally has one.  A sound system that is.  As some of you
know, our last one went with our x-partner.  We are very happy with the new
one.  We are in the process of deciding when to turn it on at a free
outdoor event.  We don't want to step on anyone's toes so we need
suggestions.  It must be a monthly type of suggestion.  Nothing too taboo.

thanx

It is worth nothing more than a penny beyond SARCASM.

FOR MOST OF US, those days of driving 2 hrs to a rave and dishing out $25

Your parties are perfectly fine for the age group that it is intended

hello all.  I'm really looking foreward to Harmony, tomorrow, (i'll go to
anything outside).  i've been bringing my drum ( a tabla ) to the last
couple raves and have spent much of the time drumming along to the whatever
grove happens to be going.  a couple of times, i've met other people there
who had percussion like shakers, bongos, or other drums, and we've had some
of the most intense drumming circles.  it seems to tap into the tribal
elements of rave music, and bring me into the community really fast and
really intensely.  Rather than focusing on the melody, which seems far to
linear for my tastes, drumming catches me into the groove and doesn't let go.
i'm asking any of you, who might be going to harmony tomorrow who have drums
or percussion to bring them.  i'll be walking around with a multiculored
tabla on a string.  please join me, and help make the rave experience better.

hope to see you all there

matt

Hello SFRavers -

 I'll be bringing my wife Mary to Harmony tomorrow , so if you recognize
me/us come and say hello! ( In memory of Mr. Garcia , I'll be wearing
a silver "skull & roses" pendant. Also , maybe I'll be wearing some id 
with my name/email address on it ). 

 The rave percussion idea sounds like fun! I'll bring claves and join
in , if the others don't mind an less-than-amateur percussionist! ( I'm
humble , so if I throw everybody else off , just let me know ...)
  
 I'm eager to hear Brandon spin - he works at Solid Grooves , and has
always been a decent guy behind the counter. I hope he does well behind
the mixer!

about three months ago i came to san francisco.  i didn't know anyone,
didn't know what to expect, and didn't know where to go. 

since then i have been to the most absolutely amazing parties i have 
seen anywhere, met many of the people i know are the best in the world,
and generally had the greatest time of my life!
so i wanted to thank all of you who have made it so great.  from the 
tiny underground gatherings to the huge parties, the promoters, the
dj's, the people who do it because they love it, and mostly the people.
you are the nicest and brightest i have ever met.  and no other place, 
i mean anywhere, has a better vibe!  the only thing thicker is the fog!

i've been to parties on mountain sides, and parties on the beach.
i've danced in phat clubs, dusty parks, and sweaty lofts.
i've hugged, held hands and danced with people i'd never seen before
and probably never will again, and i've felt so high i thought my
feet would never reach the ground! 

this place is mystical.  magical!  and i hate that i have to leave, but
i have things to finish on the other coast.  so to all of you who have made
my stay so absolutely FANTASTIC thank you so much.  all of you.  those i
have really met and those i know only from cyberspace.  great big special
thanks to mike clay, diane tabellija, jake reichert, and sarvi for driving me
around wherever i _had_ to go every weekend.  you guys are the greatest!
thanks to jan, joe, brian, brian, tiff, patrick, alyssa, ... oh god, fukin 
everybody for being here and making it the place it is!  

but i could drag on forever, and i don't have much time left!  
my plane leaves on monday, and so i only have three more nights to enjoy!
catch y'all out there!   :)

Peace. Love. Unity. Respect.
Keep it alive!

UNITY under it.  On the front of the shirt in the upper left hand 
corner (my left) are the words House Nation one nation under a groove.  
I don't know how many I will need, at least 2.   Thanks.

love chris

I noticed that the sunset number on the calendar is the same as the
"old" number that got published in that SF rag. Isn't there a new
number that was used for the renewal/sunset party from last week?
Anybody got the new number, or is the old one working?

Hopefully I'll be able to make it -- I'm flying back from SIGGRAPH
on Sunday afternoon.... Hope to See You All there.

How Green is Gingrich?   copyright US News & World Report - 8/7/95

For the past several months, House Speaker Newt Gingrich has been meeting
informally with a star-studded group of scientists to discuss a wide range of
environmental issues, from ants to wetlands.  "The key is Gingrich is
interested in animals", says Harvard entomologist E.O. Wilson, a member of
the group, who points out that the speaker keeps a mold of Tyrannosaurus Rex
in his office.  Terry Maple, director of the Atlanta Zoo and a long-time
friend of Gingrich, helped organize the "zoo's who," which includes a
paleontologist Stephen J. Gould, entomologist Thomas Eisner and key members
of the Environmental Defense Fund.  They have already convinced Gingrich of
the ecological importance of smaller organisms, such as fungi and insects,
and may have influenced his decision to oppose Republican efforts to gut the
Endangered Species Act.  The group recently sent him a detailed brief on
disputes between environmentalists and private landowners.  On this issue,
Wilson says they want to serve as "honest brokers" in providing scientific
information and legislative options.  Adds Wilson: "I don't want to paint Mr.
Gingrich bright green, but I've been impressed by his quick, open mind."

There was no foam, but the plaster walls seemed to be 
absorbing quite a bit of the sound- which didn't affect how it sounded, 
but did lead to several rather large chunks of it plummeting to the 
floor, and that was before they even turned the lights off!  I was surprised 
the whole gym didn't just collapse with the rumbling bass provided by 
mu-siq :)

The topic of drumming with electronic dance music has come up before, but 
I can't help but make another comment.  Drumming is wonderful, powerful, 
spiritual, tribal, and all that good stuff, but in combination with 
techno/house, it just makes the music sound like one continuous bad mix.  
It's great for the people drumming, but hell for the people 
trying to dance.  When the music already has tribal elements in it 
(bongos, etc), then it can work, but only with a REALLY good drummer.  Most 
drummers that I have been 
subjected to at raves have not quite been at that level.  Drummers are 
great in a chill out space, but not on the dance floor. Remember, techno 
is *supposed* to be linear and repetitive- this description was even used 
in England's Criminal Justice Bill to outlaw parties (i.e. gatherings 
around a "repetitive beat").  

But I digress...  Basically, it's very rare that any attempts by the 
audience to jam with the music does anything but annoy the people trying 
to dance.  I mean, is there anyone out there who actually enjoys whistles?!?
I didn't think so...

    Seth
<acid232dica>

BTW, the whistles at All Together Now were HORRRRRRENDOUS!!  Ugh.

Yes it's me, your favorite person to hug on a rainy day!

After reorganizing my internet stuff(I moved my accounts around for my
convienence, thats why they were boomeranging for a while) I decided to
rejoin you guys on the magical mystery tour.

Well I just woke up at 7 PM. I did sound for common ground last night in
 a HUGE airline hanger. It was beatiful, dark, and pounding. There was a
ton of rave virgins there but they were all into dancing. It was a
wonderful site.

To Greg from harmony,

I heard your party was really good. Why don't you give me a call about
your next one. The system I used is absolutely wounderful!!!


I love you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I know, I know . . . I've just been involved in a big flamefest over on
ne-raves about whether talking about Jerry Garcia's death and the
relationship between raves and the Dead is inappropriate.

BUT.

Ken, Ken, Ken.

We've been through this before.

Posting random things about Newt Gingrich has precious little to do
with this list.  ESPECIALLY since you've just posted a copyrighted
article, which may violate the fair-use provisions of the copyright
law, although the excerpt is short enough that it might not be
applicable.  And of course USN&WR is virtually certain not to care
that you reposted their copyrighted information here in any event.

Why oh why do you insist on spamming the sfraves list, Ken Stuart?

At least when people were posting here, on ne-raves and elsewhere
about Garcia it had at least some tenuous connection to the subject
matter of the list . .. 

Oh well. I'll shut up now!

Great party.  The music and the people were very good.  But most
impressive was the way you did up the place and organized everything.
We all felt that you guys put LOTS of energy into the party, and this
feeling is what made it a great event.

The only possible improvement: let the party go on a little longer, or
arrange for an afterparty, or simply make it possible for people to
hang out for a while before going home.

THANK YOU

Hello,

I'd have to say Harmony was one of the bestest, gosh darnest, funnest time i
had getin' down and dirty.  The people, the lights, the music, it all made
for a lovley evening in the moonlight.

It was a change of pace to have breakbeat and high tecno as opposed to the
trance and amiance one finds in the SF venues and it looked as if it brought
the firewalkers out on most of us..

I noticed a lot of newbies and first time ravers at this paticular event too
and it was nice to see that, as CYR put it, "they seem to be behaving
themselves".  A lot of the local ravers I saw too and a hearty "howdy" to
thoses that I didn't get to say hi to.


Smile O meter ratings:

         Vibes:    9 Smiles (the only drawback would be the speaker problems
@ round midnite)
Grins'n'hugs:   9 Smiles (The frendship ratings were once again on a high
note having met at least seven new people)
Dancing space: 9 Smiles (With a whole barn, who could go wrong...sorry for
kickin' up so much dust tho..)
Eye Candy:       10Smiles (for $10 the lazers, lights and neonish posters
werre more than enough for visual treats)
Thirst meter:  9.5 smiles (Free soda, you can't go wrong)

Overall   9.3Smiles  One of the strongest showings yet....

In ending, I must say I was really pleased to see people from other sound
systems show up to support this one and proving that the scene isn't about
 competition, but rater, us as a community supporting each other that will
keep us alive...

 For the time my wife Mary and I were there , we had a great time! I was
the guy wearing the Grateful Dead skull & roses/dancing skeleton t-shirt.

 Lot's of folks went out of their way to greet & hug Mary , who I guess has
an earth motherly / mommy look to her. Folks I (literally) bumped into were
very nice and non-attitude.

 I think some monitoring of mixer/amp levels would have helped at some
point - when we got there during Brandon's set at 9:30PM , the sound was
nice and crisp with punchy bass . I noticed that Brandon was keeping the
music peaks at the mixer down to a level where the red leds were just
being goosed . 

 My favorite aural memory was how the corrogated metal roof vibrated with
a hissing rattle on every bass beat - actually sounded good! ( I've been to
an event in an airplane hanger where the metal wall vibrations sounded
bad with the music ).

 Unfortunetly , I found out that I can't dance with horse poop dust swirling
about , it chokes up my throat! Harmony was the second time I've been exposed
to lots of dust in the presence of horses , and both times I've choked
up after about two hours. We left Harmony at about 12:30 AM - damn!

 Next time at that site - dust masks!

 Are you talking about the warm soda in the tub ? Also - I didn't see any
obvious place for water, except two jugs on the left side of the stage,
no cups. If there was water at the site , it wasn't obvious - we brought
our own , so no problem for us two.

 If my throat and lungs had held up , we would have stayed longer as well!

Hello everyone,
    
    This is Greg from Harmony. Finally after getting some sleep last 
night I can muster up the energy to post! 

    I have to thank every single one of you that came out on Friday. 
You guys made that such a great party! I must admit, we didn't expect 
that many people. Every person there was so friendly and beautiful. I 
can never explain the feelings that we all got from this party. We were 
soooooo impressed with the way it turned out. It was like one of our 
past little parties, just magnified 3x. The vibe was still really 
strong, yet the party was kinda on the big side, (at least for us!) I 
was rather impressed with the "vibe per person ratio." (A little inside 
joke between the crew.) We could not have asked for a better 2 year 
party! So thanks again to everyone who came out!!!

    Now for those of you who called the voice mail after 12:15, we 
appologize. Like I said before, we didn't expect that many people, (or 
at least all at once!) So what happened was we ran out of parking, and 
had to shut down the voice mail. So sorry if you didn't get to make it. 

    Also, we would like to appologize for the hard core security. 
Everything was cool, until every single promoter in the bay area showed 
up and started harassing the owners of the ranch. After a while I guess 
the owners thought there was something bigger going on that night and 
started sketching. So they told security to tighten their grip on the 
party. (We told them to be leanient on everyone, and not to bust 
people. But the owners of the ranch had more pull with the security. :( 
) So that is why some of you might have gotten something taken away at 
the party. 

    On a happier note, for all those who are interested we didn't make 
any money, actually we came about a couple hundred dollars away from 
breaking even!! That's really good for that party. We put soooo much 
energy, time, and money into it. And it was worth every second, every 
dollar, and every bit of energy!!!! Thanks :) The total # of people for 
the night was around 1200. Which matched our budget of around $11,000. 
So including all of last weeks (last minute) equiptment purchases, and 
all other last minute expences, we broke even!! (Which was really 
suprising! Good too!!! :)

    There are a number of people I need to thank but it would take way 
too long. But you guys know who you are! So thank you! 

    In total, we will never forget that night. It was the best night of 
our lives! (Yes, I speak for everyone in the crew!) Thank you soooo 
much!!!! We love you!!!!

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people!!!!,

Greg 

Ps. Yee Ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yeah, there is a Sunset today, at a familiar spot in Richmond.

btw, there's a new number, but I don't know if the Pacific crew would want it posted, so ask around for it!

hello all, especially seth, who took the time and energy to disagree with
me.  that's cool.
i've never become annoyed by a drummer at a rave b4, and have seen many
drums, from tablas to bongos, shakers to rattles.  for me, it all depends
how you want to interface with the music.  as a musician, i live with music,
and i love hearing a great piece of music and being with it, playing along
with it, having it contribute to me as i contribute to it.  if your way of
being with the music is by dancing,  cool.  if your way is with whistles,
cool.  if your way is by sitting and chilling, cool.  none of us have the
right or responsibility to discourage others from their own way of raving.
we're all raving with each other, not just individually raving with the dj
and the music.


thanks for expressing ya'self, man

Who went? It was a real blast!!! I did E for the first time, and I never met
so many cool happy killer people in my life!!! That guy with nitrous helped a
lot too! Carlos's set was really good and so was Ghosts! The only part that
suked was the fact that every time I went up to dance there was a huge dust
cloud!(if that was the worst problem, then i guess i really shouldn't
complain!!!) Anyway i was the dude, with the blue backpack with the pot leaf
on it and my hat had a patch that said pyslocybin!

Well I haven't been to a sunset party in about a month.  
This was as usual (for sunset) a GREAT party!  It seemed like the vibe just 
got thicker as the party went on. 
Nice sized crowd.  Didn't take long for the new # to get around.  I think 
the new # helped the party be a bit more underground helping give the 
party a bit more of a "ravier" vibe.  
Just as I was getting my things together the police showed up with from 
what i saw about 7 cars with their sirens flashing.  This brought a loud 
roar from the crowd obviously enjoying their light show.  This was a bit 
past 9:30, over the parks closing time.  I didn't wait around long to see 
the interaction as the cops got out of there cars.  I guess everyone left 
smoothly with no hassle given the beautiful vibe when I left.  
I just hope staying past the park closing time didn't hurt using that 
space again.  
Much thanks to the pacific crew,
and everyone else for helping make the party what it was.
 
:)

Yeah, they'll eventually become oil, and his wife needs a new fur
coat... Actually, Newt privately likes animals because he gets off on
having his nubile 17 year old administrative assistant bend him over,
pull down his stained shorts, and smack his wobbly cellulite-covered
buttox with a stinky mackerel while she says "Daddy's been a baaaad bad boy!".
Ahh, nature! Those vinyl imitation stinky mackerel just don't cut it!

Make that man president! Keeps an effigy of extinction in his office --
that's the future republicanism and libertarianism holds for us.
Yipeeeee!

Hey, I keep MOLD in my office (coffee cup science experiment), maybe I
should be speaker of the house??

Yeah, without fungi, you couldn't have cheese, and without cheese,
there'd be no Wisconsin. Without bees, no honey!  Who ever said it was
easy being at the top of the food chain?? Exploitation is a full time
job, or as some rapper (too short?, Easy E?) said "pimpin' ain't easy!".

In other words, by giving money to scientists that would otherwise not
be funded, you can broker their honesty and have them say whatever you
want them to say. Then play their words into convenient sound-bytes
used to fool the generally ignorant and easy-to-placate populace that
would rather hear a message that consumerism, the convenience of the
individual, and right-to-profit-uber-alles rules over global ecological
needs.

All this just so that the republicans can achieve their final divide
and conquer of our natural resources. After all, the bible says we are 
"stewards of the earth" which means we can do whatever the fuck we want
for fun and profit. Or as Beavis and Butthead say "God is cool. Huhuh
heheh huhuhuhuh."
  
> Adds Wilson: "I don't want to paint Mr.

Open to profit, open to exploitation, open to quick and easy solutions.
Quick to forget, quick to profit. Quick to reap and rape. Slow to sow.

A stitch in time saves nine. How bout saving us and not posting any
more bullshit about Newt "goebbels" Gingrich, on this list. Because if
you keep it up, I'm just going to blather on idiotically like I did
in this here post.

PS: Ob-Rave -- as usual, an excellent sunset! Hello to all and to all,
hello! Me, i was just dancing to keep the bees from attacking my shirt
(they thought i was a flower??) Yeah, that's it!

     Hey SFRavers,
     
     Boy, I totally have to agree with all the posts about how great 
     HARMONY was.. hats off to Greg and Crew for a brilliant job in 
     organisation and production!
     
     The vibe was just great!!!! Although I did see about 50-80 people who 
     were, shall we say 'vibeless'.. about 600 others *completely* made up 
     for that! Gawd,.,, so many smiles and grins in one evening!
     
     Also, the music.. 'Its the music!'.. It was wonderful how the evening 
     evolved from Trent's set, off to the great faster techno-ey sets by 
     Markie, Graeme, and Ethan.... and finally Galen bringing it on down to 
     close it off... I just couldnt stop dancing. 
     
     And was it me, or have I never heard a soundsystem that was so crisp 
     and 'full' sounding at that volume? Maybe a horse ranch is an ideal 
     place for a rave? :)
     
     Still smiling and the blinky light is still going!
     
     Seeya, Sy

As a musician, I like to hear live playing and would always like to see
more of it at raves.  However, like Seth, I very often been annoyed 
by drummers while I dance.  This is not because I find them unwelcome or
inappropriate in the setting, but mainly because the live drumming was 
just not grooving very well with the records.  To be specific, it tends 
to be rhythmically inaccurate and lagging behind the beat.  I hope I'm 
not raining on anyone's parade, but I think it takes a lot of experience
and really focused energy to play along with house or techno in a way 
that adds to the music.  (especially if there are finicky ears around :) )

If someone gets fulfillment and enjoyment from drumming, that's a 
wonderful thing.  But when playing in public, it's not enough just to 
satisfy yourself...you have to do it for everyone around you.  So, my 
advice to any / all drummers is: concentrate, be creative, observe the 
people dancing around you, and most of all STAY ON TOP OF THE BEAT!!! 
(that means, don't get lazy).  Even the best musicians need to remember
these things.  I worked on a studio project this summer with a Brazilian 
percussionist who started playing in samba bands when he was 6 years old, 
and has since played all over the world with all sorts of famous types, and 
even *he* needed occasional prodding when his playing got a little off.
So don't get discouraged, anyone.  Just remember that behind the spirit
and magic of music there is also a lot of brains and sweat.

end of sermon

thanks for listnin'

-Brian

Hello all,

 Exxon Corporation has set up/paid for a 1-800 line to contact US
 Senators.  It is under the auspice of a group that wants to refine the
 environmental laws and the regulatory tendency of US environmental
 policy.  The thing to remember is that EXXon is paying.  Anyway, a small
 group in Boulder has been trying to get this number out to the other
 side, if Exxon is providing we shall take.  They pay the bill but the
 caller is simply connected to the office of a US Senator.


1)  Dail 1-800-444-1555
2)  They will give you a short recorded message.
3)  Follow instructions if you have a touch tone phone, public ones work
 best and they have other advantages.  :
4)  Enter a zip code...they ask for yours but it doesn't have to be...it can

 be any in the US.
5)  Make a choice of the elected politician's office you want to be
 connected to. 
6)  When the staff person answers you are set to discuss the proposed
 environmental reform regulations, OR ANY OTHER ISSUE YOU WANT!

Couple of tricks...we found they limit the number of calls to 3 from each
 number.  Solution:  public phones are everywhere...enjoy Exxon's
 corporate attempt to influence "grassroots democracy"

Kevin

     Mirrors.  
     
     I don't know if any other sfravers were there on Saturday but I had a 
     great time.  To me, it was a place where pretense and judgement were 
     absent and we were open and accepting of who we were and why we were 
     there...as a group and as individuals.  I was grateful that the 
     growing clubbiness I've seen recently was nowhere in sight.  (Hmmm, 
     this last sentence reminds me of Karen's post about mainstream raves.)
     
     Pollywog and James(?) (from Oklahoma/Kansas or whatever wheatland 
     place he came from) were terrific dj's.  James (as I'll dub him for 
     now) has been here about a month and certainly knows how to bring 
     people out on the floor with his music.  I can see him developing into 
     quite a thing as he knows how to work a crowd through his 
     music...something I haven't seen enough of these days.  And it's nice 
     to see that both he and Pollywog have a diverse taste in spinning--not 
     just staying within a particular genre.  James' talent will be a great 
     addition to the scene and I look forward to seeing him play again.
     
     Pollywog's second set was the shit.  If I can give it a name, trip-hop 
     comes to mind as I wound myself into a heavy trance state only to want 
     to hold my head as my brain went on overload with her music.  
     Stringing us out with pregnant pauses, I didn't know what to expect.  
     A definite delight to the senses.  This was the first time I heard 
     either dj and I was impressed...perhaps it was the vibe or the size of 
     the party and/or my state of mind, but whatever happened "it was all 
     good".
     
     Mmmm, didn't make it to Sunset :{ in the past two weeks due to other 
     committments but I'm glad to hear of the changes->growth->evolution.
     
     Looking forward to meeting and seeing people at F&F soon!
     
     Sunshiny love,
     Diane
     
     P.S.  Kevin K. I've got something you left in my car.  Contact me so 
     we can connect.  Oh, and Tristan, please pass along my compliments to 
     the dj's and give me James' real name, please.?!

	When's the next Friends and Family 'appening?

	I should know this, but I've been off the list for two 
months, spending my summer wallowing in the lush, muggy greenery of
Wisconsin and revelling in the mw-raves scene.  
But it's good to be back in SF.


	your lurking friend,

p.s.  If there are any midwesterners turned SFers out there who'd like to 
swap comparisons of and stories from both the mw and sf, I'd love to talk.  
Drop me an email anytime.

To any interested SFRavers,

I'm going to be taking a little trip down to LA next weekend and I was
wondering if there was anyone else headed down that way that wanted to share
ride & gas.  I'll probably be leaving Friday night and getting back Monday
night.  I might take the 101 down, too, so if anyone is headed toward Santa
Barbara or thereabouts I can drop them off there, too.  Send back replies
via email if you are interested.

Jake

Hey all,
 
Over the weekend some friends had a bad experience on what they thought 
was E. Their E was actually herion. After reading a little bit about the 
affects, as well as talking with others who have experienced it before, I 
came to the  conclusion that what they took this weekend was herion.
	What I was wondering for them, and for others, is what are the 
effects while you are on it? How do you feel when you come down? How long 
do the effects last? I heard that it can stay in your body for a few days 
and that it takes a while to feel normal again. What emotional affects do 
you feel? What causes the addiction to the drug? What physical affects 
are there? I've checked the 
archives on hyperreal but they do not address my specific questions.  
	Awhile back there was thread on brown stuff in E, and many 
concluded that the brown stuff was not herion. Well, my friends claimed 
that what they took was in tablet form and was dirty brown.

	Can anybody shed some light on the subject? Suggested reading?

Concerned,

dhouse

> tends to be rhythmically inaccurate and lagging behind the beat.

well a good drummer is a good drummer and a bad drummer is bad -- you
just hear it. You don't need to be a musician to decide if something's
got a groove. In fact, being "on the beat" may very well be the sign of
a BAD drummer. Cuz funk, swing, or jazz is definitely not played "on
the beat".

If I want "on the beat" I'll get a metronome or drum machine. THe
purpose of a drummer is to do things that a machine can't.

Now if what you mean is "arrythmia" (aka the inability to keep the
beat), now that's a different matter entirely.

Most of the conga players I've heard (e.g. at come/unity a while back)
were *great*, they played rhythmically, but infused it with enough
funk to make it interesting.

> To be specific, it tends 
> to be rhythmically inaccurate and lagging behind the beat.  I hope I'm 

Some  house music puts a hi-hat lagging behind the beat. Kinda gives it
that chugging feeling. It's done that way for a reason, because
otherwise you wouldn't be dancing to it. Similarly, the whole effect of
jazz is from swinging the bass line behind the beat. So I think you
need to be careful in dissing "lagging" because funk would never exist
without it.

So to me, a drummer can make boring, repetitive quantized-down-into-
16th-note-with-4-bar-repeating-pattern-techno funky and interesting.
(Not that all techno is boring, but there is a lot of not so intersting
beats that a drummer can help with...)

Electronic Musician mag this month has an excellent extended section on 
how to do various different drumming styles electronically.  Niels is right --
there is far more subtlety and complexity there than you might think.  The
most boring thing in the world is a precisely perfect beat.

don't let it get you down even though it may seem like the toughest thing 
right now. seek peace in the things that are always there, even when the 
people around you are not. 
 
	-the freshness & quiet of the forest when you're alone 
	-the beautiful white sparkle that plays on the ocean water 
	-the feel of the sunshine on your skin on a good day 
	-the ability to dance just for the hell of it (when other people are 
not so lucky) 
	-some stranger smiling at you when you least expect it. 
	(like i'm doing right now- sending you a ray of blue light)

Thanks for the feedback...I have to say that I am *very* well aware of
these things.  Having spent years playing non-electronic music (including 
jazz and swing--I'm a sax player, FYI) before I ever touched a synthesizer 
or drum machine, I find precisely perfect beats just as annoying as you guys 
do.  I've spent hours with sequences nudging notes this way and that out of
their computer-precise places to try to make electronic music that feels more
 human.   So, I think I was a little misunderstood...
I should have been clearer and simply said that I just don't want to have
to endure BAD drummers.  There is a big difference between drummers who
play around the beat because they know their shit and drummers who lag  
through lack of skill or focus.

I guess I've not had as good luck as you in hearing the better conga 
players around...
so, your words are encouraging...

I agree wholeheartedly with that.

ALL-NIGHT TEEN `RAVES' ARE FIRETRAPS, NYC OFFICIALS SAY
Dayton Daily News (DA) - SUNDAY, August 6, 1995
By: Dave Saltonstall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS
Edition: CITY  Section: NEWS  Page: 4A
Word Count: 411

TEXT:
NEW  YORK  -  To  the  kids who attend, they are known as raves - all-night
dance  parties  that move mysteriously into the city's abandoned warehouses
or lofts  for one night, like tremendous floating clubs, and then move on.

But  to  New  York  City fire officials, these raves have come to look like
something  else  -  the  city's  latest  firetraps, filled with hundreds of
partying youngsters reveling in typically unsafe, uninspected buildings.

    ``They're  Happy  Lands  waiting  to  happen,'' said Chief Fire Marshal
Michael  Vecchi,  referring to the 1990 Bronx social club blaze that killed
87  people.  ``And right now these raves are happening every weekend in the
city.''
   Exactly  where,  though,  is another question, since many rave promoters
make  a point of keeping their parties a secret until the last minute - and
even  then  leading  followers  on  a treasure hunt-like search to find the
exact  location.

   The  end  of  the  line is often a little-used office, loft or warehouse
where  the  determined  find  an  amazing  array  of  lights,  speakers and
throbbing  techno  music  -  but  rarely a sprinkler system or any properly
lighted  exit signs, say fire officials, who began targeting the rave scene
last spring.

   Since  May,  the city has closed at least six major raves in a crackdown
by  the  Fire  Department's  Social Club Task Force, set up after the Happy
Land  disaster.  In  most  cases, the spaces were jammed with at least four
times as  many people as they were built to accommodate.

   ``We are just trying to send a message to the promoters by maintaining a
presence,'' said Ken Gorecki, the task force's supervising fire marshal.

   Alan  Sax,  one  of  the city's preeminent rave promoters and producers,
said  the  Fire  Department's crackdown serves only to drive the rave scene
further  underground.  As proof, he said, there had been at least two major
raves  in  Manhattan  with  more  than 2,000 people at each in the last two
months.

   ``And the Fire Department had no clue what was going on,'' said Sax, who
defends raves as healthy, multicultural gatherings.

   One  problem,  fire officials say, is that the only charge many of these
rave  producers  have  had  to  face  is  criminal  nuisance, a misdemeanor
carrying  a  small  fine.  But  officials  are exploring using civil law to
confiscate  expensive stereo and lighting equipment.

   ``If  the  disc  jockeys  find  out  that  they  stand to lose all their
equipment  if they don't comply, they might be a little more hesitant to be
complicitous  in this,'' said Vecchi.

Oh God, here we go again...
E is not cut with heroin. First of all it would me no sense since heroin
goes for something like $150/g. Secondly heroin is not very active when
taken oraly in such small doses (as in a pill).

E is supposed to get you FUCKED UP just like heroin (well, sort of). I have
had many different types of high while on E and im sure it has do with alot
of things (dosage, surroundings, combinations with other drugs, etc).

The brown stuff is probably caused by imcomplete systhesis of the safrole
oil used to make MDMA (its brown). The best way to tell if your capsule of
powder is the real shit is if it smells like liquorice

I wasn't referring directly to your posting, Brian.  Any good drummer
knows how to lead or lag the beat and still basically 'be on the One.'
I've heard a couple of live drummers at 1015 lately who really added
a lot to the sound in the main room.

The biggest problem is that the most experienced drummers (hand, trap
or whatever) don't know about the rave/house/techno/whatever scene
hardly at all.  There's just no cultural connecting point for a lot
of them, in part because the scene is so recording-oriented and live
musicians like to play, well, live.  I think there is definitely room
for more fluid and interactive combinations of DJs and live musicians.
I mean, like duhhhh, that's what hip hop has really been all about
all along.  

In general, this goes with my current theme, which is it's time to tear
down the walls again.  Derrick Carter reminisced in an interview I saw
about how when house first blew up in Chicago in the 1980s, people mixed
that up with Talking Heads and all other kinds of stuff.  Doc Martin told
me about the early days in SF circa 1987 when he was just getting started,
playing in little hole in the wall clubs mixing wailing diva house with
Led Zeppelin and everyone going off in a big way.  

We've all become too category-bound, in my view, me included.

        Hmmm..the eternal question ;) well, from my reading, and my
observations of tests done on street drugs in London and Amsterdam, NONE
have come up with heroin in them.  That, naturally, doesn't necessarily
mean anything. BUT, from my reading (Saunders "e for ecsatasy" and parts of
shulgin's PIKHAL and other 'scientific' reports i've seen a similarity
between what ppl call 'smacky e' and things like MDA, MDEA and other
things. Consider: was the subject feeling 'clear headed'? Were they feeling
drained or confused or disoriented? This could be either from MDA, MDEA or
even a Ketamine/speed combination.
        The other part of this question is that, in my opinion at least,
the effects of anything that are ingested are not objectively measureable
all the time. They synergize with 'you' and that takes into it both
neurochemistry as well as your own subjective disposition in general as
well as your 'mind set.'
        As far as my readings as well i haven't found MDMA to be labelled
as 'physically addictive' but i also think that the body and the mind
aren't so distinct from each other so there may be some kind of addiction
that may be psychological which may, in turn, create a physical craving.

        Also, from my readings, this brown stuff is only impurities that
arise when a part of the creation process is ended too soon. Dunno, i'll
have to look this up again.
        most of all, DON'T JUST LISTEN TO ME! i'm just an art school grad
that likes to hypothesize and read a lot! :) i'd suggest Saunder's "e for
ecstasy" and Shulgin's PIHKAL and, though i haven't been able to find it
here, Bruce Eisner's book. These are the big three to my knowledge. There
is also a book (again, that i haven't been able to find) called "pathway to
the heart" which i would be interested in hearing about (through private
email if necessary).
        overall, i just want to say that get a lot of opinions from a
variety of sources and especially don't just listen to dumb (but well
intentioned) artists with too much time on their hands ;)

I am posting a confession here ...

 I finally admit in "public" that I like "I Saw The Sign" by Ace of Base.

 There , I said it.

   ( The trouble is , other parts of my mind hate these guys , mostly
     because they have such insincere expressions in their music videos )

 So - if I like "I Saw The Sign" , are there any as good/better songs
on their CDs? I'll probably by 'em used anyway ...

It might be my imagination, but the DJing at Sunset seems to be
getting better and better.  I thought Kevin, Galen, Gavin and
Solar all were right on this time around.  Nice crowd.  No one "did 
the fish", but we got to see Niels and David Minuk do the bee dance
instead.  And this is was probably the 3rd Sunset in a row that
the Captain managed to crush Janie's foot on the dance floor - but
she's gotten quite used to that now, so it's OK.  :)

I suppose most have heard that United with its amazing DJ lineup
at the Trocadero got busted Sat. nite at 1:30am.  A major bummer.
There were supposedly noise complaints even after turning the
volume down, to no avail.  The troc, of course kept the full $5000,
and displayed (so I hear) their usual fucked up attitude toward the
promoters and partiers.  There were no refunds.  This is second hand
info, so my facts may be off.

On drumming: very occasionally I've heard a live percussionist who added
something worthwhile to the DJ's art.  Mainly, I prefer music that takes me 
*beyond* the limits imposed by our sloppy protoplasmic origins.  I don't
mind a human feel as long it's sampled, looped, and tweaked to an altered
state.  Sure, as a musician I enjoy playing.  But as a trance-dancer,
drum machines and looped samples work best for me.  I won't even mention
whistles.

Glad Harmony went off, looking forward to F&F. :)

i'm leaving L.A. and the SoCal-Raves mailing list (where i've been hanging

are folks up there into jungle?  any DJs?  any one-offs?  any clubs?

        you know what? i think that, for me at least, this is the ESSENCE
of what raving is about.  Mutual security.  A net of support.  People to
empathize with your struggles, to offer you advice, support, a helping
hand, a sense that you are never 'alone' in an otherwise inimical world, a
bridge across the gulf of alienation that our society cuts into us.  The
amount of energy that i get from just reading posts on here that aren't
even directed at me is amazing, almost too amazing because you can end up
depending on it and forgetting the 'real world' which is the danger that
i'm facing right now, living too vicariously, turning here when all of my
friends are leaving the city.  Yes, we are all responsible for the
happiness in our own lives, we can't rely on other people ALL the time but
knowing that when things get rough for people like sean and matthew and i
and probably a lot of you right now, that you can reach out and ask for
help and there WILL be people there.  Pulling yourself up by your own
bootstraps is a difficult thing, so when you can get that little boost
(even if it's only ascii and not even necessarily a reflection of the
person's 'real' behaviour) you can get on with your life and struggle
through the darkness with a bit more confidence and wait for the dawn to
break.
        well..IMHO at least :)
        peace,

	Real quick post.  As a professional chemist (of the legal variety),
my take on the brown E thing:  it's impure.  Almost all organic compounds 
-- which E is one of -- ARE WHITE SOLIDS.  If it's not powdery and white,
the stuff wasn't manufactured properly, and more likely is contaminated with
something (a byproduct of its manufacture, NOT smack) that may or may not
necessarily be bad for your health. Keep in mind, that depending on what
process the chemist was using, there could be any number of things in
there, including mecury.  All this comes from having inexperienced
chemists working with suboptimal equipment and materials.  Take at your own
risk.

On the way back from Harmony,   I hit some object that did serious damage
to my car.   Right now,  it's in this parking lot on LLewelling Blvd
in San Leandro.   I have someone with triple-A who can get it towed to
a safer place intil I can assess the damage.   My delema is that I need
a safer place to stash the car somewhere within 5 miles of San Leandro
until I can figure out what to do.

I already got my battery stolen,  and yesterday,  while I was transferring
some other things from the car,   some local homeboys were walking around my
car,  deeciding what else to take.   Right now,   it's in the SaveMax
parking lot,  and not in a safe neighborhood,  based on a conversation
with a security guard.

If anyone out there in SFRave land has or lives in a safe neighborhood,
or better yet,   has a space on private property,   I would be willing
to part with some money to pay for storage,  as long as it don't cost
what body shops charge  :-)

Anyways,   if anyone can help the Crunchman,  Pse let me know.

So far,  estimates to get it towed up here to Mill Valley run from $275 and
up.

Thanx
Crunchman

You know, this is really too bad.  For a while there I had some modicum of
respect for Larry.  Now I may have to talk to Brian about having him banned
from the list.  Or put in front of a firing squad.

Yet another lost SFRaver in our midst.  It's really a shame.  :)

Hey, folks! I just finished making my plans for 
Burning Man! Yea!

I'll be in (via flying) to Las Vegas on Wednesday, the 30th, 
and staying the night there. I've rented a 4x4 with 
which I'll go to the Manaflame fest. I'm returning to Reno 
then SJ in the afternoon on Monday, the 4th. Should anyone 
like to meet up in Las Vegas, at the festival, or in Reno, 
please let me know. Also, if anyone in LV _OR_ in Reno (no great pain 
to swing by there) needs a ride to the fest, or from the fest to 
Reno, again please ask. 

I only request that you bring enough water for yourself if you want to 
take me up on my offer.

The car-rental reservationist thought I was going on a whirlwind 
casino tour; I thought it best not to tell her of the meta-gamble 
that is Burning Man!

giddily-

Jocelyn

p.s. for anyone who cannot go- I'd be happy to make any offering, 
recitation, incantation, bizarre act (within personal boundaries),
etc... in your stead and report back on how it was given/received 
upon my return.

Hi folxs,

An article originally printed in Common Ground Magazine about raves in
Seattle was just reprinted in the international publication, Magical Blend.
Please check it out.   I've cross posted to SFRAVES because of the heavy
influence that the Bay Area has had on our scene. (Thanks SF! We Love Ya!)

I offer my apologies in advance if this is inappropriate
(if it is, please let me know, though...)

Hey all! Me and some other folk were wondering about what to expect 
weather-wise, temperature-wise, condition-wise, etc... in 
an attempt to ascertain the must-haves and must-plan fors- with the aim 
of planning what to bring. would one of you Bman-experienced folk 
review my checklist please? 

I will undoubtedly be the mother hen of the group I'll be with-
especially in the planning arena.

Here's what I plan to expect: anything.
Here's what I'm going to bring with that expectation in mind:

a tent- I might bring my own, though it's this incredibly 
old 3 person thing. From what I've heard, it's most likely 
that I'll want to take the tent down (pull the main pole/or
X-bar structure) during the day, so that the wind won't 
wreak havoc on it. Then get it back up before nightfall. True?
I'll know for sure whether I'm bringing my own or renting 
when I get a final head count from some lagger friends of mine 
who I also happen to love

There are two decent ways to secure a tent in sand/sandy soil-
one- instead of staking the ties into the ground, secure them 
with rocks (big ones) two- place your heaviest gear around the 
perimeter of the tent on the inside- I'm not really sure how loose 
the soil is- so I've no way of knowing if I should pack rocks????
and leave the stakes at home???

sleeping bags: mine are -20; so, I'll also bring some top sheets 
in case it's too hot for my afternoon catnap ;)

sunscreen & a hat or two, a long sleeved, light colored, cotton
sun shirt and one pair of lightweight cotton pants or a very long
skirt for full sun cover.

flashlight(s)-  at least one per person, more 
if I've got them. 

one pair jeans/one heavy wool sweater, and some kind of in-between 
jacket or sweatshirt, a tee-shirt, shorts, and swimsuit (I hear there 
are some hot springs nearby- tho I'm sure clothing is optional at 
the entire festival, hot springs included)

one towel per person

my first aid kit to which I'll add- more aspirin, solarcaine, a 
big, thick needle and some dental floss (for stitches, which I'm 
probably too wimpy to actually use), superglue (also for stitches, my 
preferred method) and duct tape (for tent rips), latex gloves, ear plugs

a tarp and some fold-up poles with which to erect it- the tarps I have 
double as rain gear- rectangular rain ponchos with a hood.

a compass,  but I've no idea how to use 
one- so, lotta good that'll do me! But if you're in the know-
definitely bring it! maybe you can teach me?!

toys: hand held instruments, something from which recorded music
can be played on batteries (boom box), cards & probably backgammon,
my camera

my small pilot stove & some cookware

things I'll pick up in Vegas:

food, fuel for the stove (i don't think I want to bring fuel 
on board the airplane- I'm going to call the airline and ask about this), 
cooler(s), water (1-2 gallons per person per day), some candle devices,
a few bottles of some decent Cabarnet and other such acoutrement
maybe some wood if I can find some in Vegas...

The one thing i'm totally in the dark about- how to mark the campsite 
so that i can find it at night??? The only idea I've had so far is 
finding some glow in the dark paints and bringing a white sheet along-
using the daytime tarp poles to hold this up at night. That aside, 
paying a good deal of attention in the daytime when we first arrive/
choosing camp carefully next to a visible/recognizable structure. 
This is one of my primary worries for the whole trip. 
any ideas???

Un abrazo fuerte!

Jocelyn

p.s. are snakes a concern? if so, what kind? what about lechegilla?
other noxious plant life? thanks again :)

I think that any E- tab that people think is Smack or laced with 
smack is probably a pharmacutical synthetic opiate like demerol or 
delouted or even a Qualude (yes they're back). Some body got 'script

So I hear about this blurb somebody wrote about an event in Barcelona,
Spain, where Underground Resistance was on the bill.  The writer has
his head up his arse, and didn't check his facts or willingly lied.

Underground Resistance was not scheduled for a live show.  It was a DJ
assault only.  They were delayed due to weather in Detroit, and missed
the connecting flight out of New York.  They tried every optional
airline, no flights.  They called the promoter, who suggested that they
send just Suburban Knight on the Concord (at an outrageous rate).  SK
went, played a good set, and came home as normal.  The promoter was
happy, and they are planning additional events with UR.

In the article in Musik, the writer makes it out that UR was scheduled
to play live and that they demanded the Concord for their flights.
This is such bullshit for anyone who knows Mad Mike and the UR guys.
These are the guys who are going to be going to the middle of a forest
2+ hours outside of San Francisco, asking only that their plane tickets
are covered, and maybe some pork n beans and some pepsi.

I expected so much more from Ben Turner.  I hope he tightens up his
editorial control.

some people complained they couldn't get through to the web site for
burning man info. It's actually a problem with the WELL being overloaded
with requests, so keep on trying http://www.well.com/user/burnman/

In the meantime, here's a bunch of pages from the web site that I'm cutting
and pasting in here to give you some info. No cool pictures though.

The
                         Burning Man
                         Festival
                         1995

                         Now in its tenth year, Burning Man is a
                         unique annual celebration held in the high
                         desert wilderness of Northern Nevada. Over
                         the course of a long weekend, a temporary
                         community is established on the largest flat
                         expanse of land in North America, a small
                         city complete with its own radio stations,
                         daily newspaper, community centers and
                         civic monuments. Three days of art, music,
                         dance, and performance climax in the ritual
                         destruction by fire of a four-story human
                         effigy known as the Burning Man. This
year's festival will take place over Labor Day weekend, August 31st -
September 4th, 1995, and is expected to draw 2,500 participants.

What It Is

            The Burning Man Festival

         1995

We all suffer from
partial fires caught
somewhere within
us, literally trapped
in one's gut or one's
groin, one's heart,
or one's head. The
Burning is a fire
that flows fully
through us.


         Larry Harvey



     In the desert there are as many paths to heaven as there are stars
     in the sky.

                                    Danger Ranger


Here we present perspectives on the festival. If you have some work bearing
on the Burning Man that you would like to publish here, please let us know.

Burning Man 1995

                     Burning Events

         "One big
         cascading
         mass of
fire, reckless luxury,
the risk that makes you
richer. Something huge
comes to life when that
Man is ignited. A
grand extravagant
gambler's god,
Barbarian King of the
Real American Desert.
We're burning up our
fortune, all together saying, 'We can afford to lose. Pull the handle. Take a
shot.'"

==============================================================================

Welcome to

            The Burning Man Gallery

         1995


There is no single
interpetation of this
event. It is a unique
product of our
postmodern age;
pluralistic and complex,
skeptical and yet
completely
open-minded. Only by
direct participation,
through one's own
unique involvement can any answer be found.




     Some see the event as performance art between audience and
     performers...For others the event has a spiritual significance: a
     revival of "primitive" rituals that contemplate the
     interdependence of death and life in the cycle of nature, a
     sacrificial tribute to the all-sustaining, all-consuming power of
     the sun. At any rate, the days leading up to the ritual burning are
     reminiscent of a mystery pagent: full of torchlight parades,
     sacred dances, masking and holy revelry.

              Media Resource Center

         Over the years, Burning Man has
         received quite a lot of media
         coverage. This area is designed as a
central archive for this information as well as
a resource for journalists who wish to research
the event's history and background.

Important note to journalists: The Burning
Man Project welcomes press coverage on the
condition that participating journalists and
their crews do nothing to interfere with
anyone's immediate experience on the Playa.
Media representatives are expected to register
as participants ("No Spectators") and strongly
encouraged to camp on the Playa and become
part of the community. For more information
about media terms and conditions, or to
request press credentials, contact Project
Director Larry Harvey or call the Burning Man Hotline.

                                        You!

The Burning Man Project does not
merely need volunteers. It is
volunteers. Beginning with two
people in 1986, it has survived and
grown because individuals have come
forward to contribute their time,
skills, and resources. Anyone may
become a member of the Project if
they are willing to do something.
Ours is a supremely activist
community. All positions are unpaid.



WHERE WE NEED HELP: 

The following is a list of areas in
which we need help. If you want to
assist us, please call our HOTLINE.
Specify the task you would like to
perform and we'll refer you directly
to the appropriate organizer. Many
tasks will require no more than 3 hours of your time. 

     GATE 

     Greet participants as they arrive on the playa. The gate is staffed 24
     hours in 3 hour shifts. We need a compliment of sixty people to staff
     the gate. (This can be a fun job. You and your partners will represent
     the only human presence in a void. People will be very glad to see you)

CAMP SET-UP AND CONSTRUCTION

Help construct Central Camp and install the infrastructure of roads, markers,
and spires which define our civilized space.

     Early Construction
     Fifteen to twenty people to help build stages, shade structures, spires,
     markers and to help define the perimeters. It will be necessary to arrive
     approximately one week before the event. 
     Regular Construction
     Build experimental, temporary structures, handle repairs, etc. during
     the festival itself

CENTRAL CAMP STAFF

At Camp Center we maintain a cafe (espresso and juice), gift shop (shirts and
videos), and information booth. These must be staffed at all times during the
day and early evening.

     Cafe Staff
     Eighteen people to work three hour shifts at the Central Camp Cafe.
     Also need an Ice Czar to manage the cafe's supply of frozen water.
     This undoubtedly will be a very cool job. 
     Gift Shop Staff
     Hawk T-shirts and Videos to the denizens of the playa and help
     support the festival. Shade provided.

BLACK ROCK SAFETY RANGERS

Twenty to twenty-five people needed for Saturday and Sunday night to
manage errant revelers. There will be one tactical meeting in the desert.

     SOUND & LIGHTING TECHS

     Ten to twelve individuals with stage sound and lighting experience to
     set up the speaker systems and stages.

PLAYA CLEAN-UP

Everyone is expected to participate in clean-up Monday morning. We need
special volunteers, however, to spearhead this effort and, if possible, to stay
behind at least one extra day and assist in our extremely thorough effort. We
leave nothing behind.

     LAMP LIGHTING

     Our campsite is delineated by more than two dozen spire-like
     lampposts. Kerosene lanterns must be cleaned, lit and affixed to
     poles, and taken down daily. Costumes for this public task are
     highly recommended.

BURNING PAGEANT

This year our Burning Pageant on Sunday night will be choreographed in
way which will feel immediate and spontaneous. We need help to guide
large numbers of people. Costumes of your own invention are required.

BLACK ROCK GAZETTE

Largest Circulation Daily on the Playa since 1992 needs the following folks:

     Assistant Editor
     Mac Expert, Page Layout Experience 
     Roving Reporter
     Digital Camera a big plus 
     Production Coordinator
     Copying, Collation, Distribution

INTERNET

Our presence on the Internet mirrors our experience of the desert. WEB sites
are added to our network very much as fires form an archipelago of lights on
the playa. If you wish to integrate into this fast-growing world and add your
peculiar point of view to the community, please contact:
burnlink-info@well.com

                                                     
Our central organization is guided by more than 30 separate coordinators
who oversee the efforts of nearly 300 people. Among this core team the
following positions have yet to filled in 1995:

CARGO WRANGLER

The Cargo Wrangler is responsible for organizing the transport of all
materials to and from the Black Rock Desert. A Class "B" drivers license
would be helpful.

     PLAYA MEDIA COORDINATOR

     The Media Coordinator is responsible for orienting the media. This
     includes initial contact of all organizations that contact us before the
     event. Last year all television teams, in particular, were required to
     raise their hands and swear an oath: "we pledge not to interfere with
     anyone's immediate experience". In return for their cooperation we
     furnish journalists with a press kit and a list of press guidelines. In the
     desert the Media Coordinator is expected to plan and maintain a Press
     Tent. Operating from this headquarters he or she keeps a register of all
     journalists, arranges for interviews with artists and other organizers,
     and supplies the press with ongoing information. After the event, the
     Coordinator is responsible for securing copies of all press coverage and
     video and film footage shot at the event. This position requires people
     skills. Experience with the media is a plus.

CLEAN-UP MANAGER

Someone is needed to coordinate clean-up on the playa. In 1994 a
beleaguered crew took 3 full days to complete this task. The job will double
in scope this year. If properly organized, we feel it can go much more
smoothly.

     GATE COORDINATOR

     Manage a staff of sixty individuals working in shifts to man the gate.

                                                     
Finally, if your perceive a community task which we have not thought of and
which you would like to perform, please call us and let us know. 

                           Burning Man depends entirely on
                           your initiative.

==============================================================================

A Practical Survival Guide to the 

          Community of Burning Man

         We are
         escorting
Burning Man into an
astonishing and surreal
desert environment. A
primary concern is to
interact with the
environment in a
positive and
ecologically sound
manner. We will
establish a temporary
community in the center
of a thoroughly flat 400
square mile hardpan alkali expanse ringed by majestic mountains. This
environment is worlds away from that to which we are accustomed and is
governed by physical laws which cannot be ignored.

There are a number of safety and conservation concerns which you must
be aware of as a participant of this event.



Coming to the Desert: What Your Party Must Bring:

   1.A vehicle in sound mechanical condition. Make sure you have a
     working spare tire, jack, and highway flares. We also suggest you fill
     your gas tank in Reno. 
   2.IMPORTANT! One gallon of water per person per day. Keep a supply
     of water in your vehicle at all times. 
   3.Enough food/beverages and ice for your whole party. 
   4.Garbage bags. 
   5.Bedding and shelter of some type; the winds can reach 40 mph. A good
     camp tent is recommended along with warm sleeping bags. 

We Suggest You Bring:

   1.Sunscreen/sunblock lotion. 
   2.Umbrellas, parasols, hats, sheets; something to break the midday sun -
     You'll be glad you did! 
   3.A cooking stove if you expect to heat food or liquid. 
   4.Flashlights and spare batteries. 
   5.Compass. 
   6.Folding chairs or camp stools. 
   7.Bicycles (mountain bikes with balloon tires are best). 



Desert Navigation

There are no roads, signs or street lights in the Black Rock desert. Much like
deep space, travel is accomplished in vectors of direction and distance. All
objects - human beings, cars, even our encampment - drastically diminish in
the scale of the desert. A difference in heading of 4 or 5 degrees can send
ones destination sweeping past unheeded to the left or right. Use your
odometer, compass and posted landmarks to find your way. Upon first
entering and leaving camp, take time to accurately observe landmarks among
surrounding peaks. They are useful guides during the day. At night it is very
difficult to determine the direction or distance of anything. Lights array
themselves in random and confusing patterns. Any observed point may be 4,
40, or, should you happen to fix on a star, 400 billion miles distant. We will
locate a tower equipped with a flashing beacon at the center of camp. The
central circle of our camp is laid out as a giant compass. Wooden spires mark
the cardinal directions and are color coded. Lesser poles mark degrees of the
compass. Even finding your own tent within Central Camp may prove to be
an challenging task at night. After you have setup your campsite, go to the
center of camp counting the number of steps. Using the wooden spires and
your compass, locate the vector (bearing) of your campsite. Remember your
vector/distance from this central position.

Our Campsite

   1.Driving on the desert produces a dust plume. Please approach the camp
     downwind. 
   2.Drive slowly and carefully within the immediate confines of our camp.
     Any vehicle which presents a safety hazard to the community will
     be disabled. 
   3.Do not drive or camp within our Central Circle or block roads leading
     into it. 
   4.Secure objects at your campsite (paper products, clothing, tarps,
     everything) against the wind. Objects as large as sleeping bags, chairs,
     card tables and empty ice chests have been carried away by occasional
     high winds. Weight the interior corners of your tent. Tent stakes which
     are 12-inch or longer are recommended. 
   5.Extended ropes or cables used to secure tents should be flagged. They
     are hazardous to pedestrians at night. 
   6.Every camping party is responsible for its refuse. Part of the beauty of
     the Black Rock desert is it's astounding blankness. Except for tire
     tracks and foot prints, our policy is to leave the desert a profoundly
     barren and empty quarter of the world. A general cleanup party will be
     held on Monday morning. You must participate. Take your trash out
     with you. Do not deposit garbage bags in Gerlach. 
   7.Do not ignite fireworks within the boundaries of camp! Do not keep
     loaded firearms in camp or discharge firearms across the playa! All
     firearms must be secured at all times; there are children here. 
   8.Please don't camp or park near the Burning Man. 



Conservation and Safety Pointers

   1.Dig no holes in the alkali desert surface. (We will provide portable
     toilets.) Holes (even back-filled) present a danger to recreational
     motorists. 
   2.Be aware of the very real danger of dehydration and sunstroke. Drink
     lots of water. If you begin to shiver in the midday sun, immediately
     seek the shade. In case of emergency, go to our medical station at the
     center of camp. Medical aides are on call and evacuation is available. 
   3.Do not camp in sleeping bags away from your vehicle at night. If you
     are driving on the desert at night, be aware that there may be people
     away from the campsite and also land sailers running in the darkness
     without lights. Drive slowly and with caution. Never cruise at night
     with your headlights off. 
   4.Use caution when turning at higher speeds. Tires will not slide on the
     alkali and vehicles will roll over. 
   5.After first leaving the paved road and driving onto the desert it is
     critical to avoid the perimeter of the flat where it intersects with the
     surrounding mountains. There is a band of very soft, occasionally
     swamp-like ground along the edge of the playa. If you drive into this
     area, you WILL get stuck. We suggest that when driving off-road you
     stay at least 1/4 mile from the edge of the alkali flat. Also avoid any
     other areas where the ground is not hard-packed and flat. 
   6.There are many hot springs near the mountains along the edge of the
     Playa. Always test the water temperature before entering. Don't bring
     pets, some of the pools are boiling hot. 
   7.Before departing camp on an excursion tell others of your plan.
     Introduce yourself to your neighbors. Contact a Ranger if anyone is
     missing. 
   8.Night-time distress signal: red highway flare or flash your headlights. 

Sound Abatement

Resign yourself to certain facts: a) sounds at night reverberate on the playa
b) people will camp where they will c) we don't live here in brick houses d)
this is, after all, a party. Follow these simple rules: To the degree you enjoy
silence, camp at a corresponding distance from the center of camp (keeping
in mind that any tent which is situated beyond the metropolitan fringe of our
circle could become the target of a stray vehicle at night-- erect reflectors!)
Should your need for quiet be absolute, bring earplugs. Celebrants: turn your
amplified music down at night.

Black Rock Rangers

It is the mission of the Black Rock Rangers to patrol the playa. Led by
legendary Danger Ranger, these intrepid scouts are trained to conduct search
and rescue missions, assist all campers in emergencies, provide for our camp
safety and distribute information. Ranger headquarters will be located at
Central Camp.



Commerce & Concessions

The sale of mass-produced commercial products is strongly discouraged by
our community. This is not a consumer event. Our desert economy has no
convenience stores. Short on batteries? Need more water? Forget your sun
block? Confront your own survival. Ask to your neighbors for help or look
for these supplies in the nearby towns of Gerlach and Empire. However,
every town should have a marketplace and our camp is no exception. If you
have created items which you wish to sell at our market, please contact us in
advance. Anything offered should bear the distinctive stamp of your
individual skill, taste, and ingenuity. Whatever you make should represent a
uniquely personal act. The market will be staffed by volunteers and a 10%
contribution from proceeds goes to the community project. Look for our
market in Central Camp. 

Storms

The Black Rock Desert is sometimes subject to rainstorms. Storm cells, fed
by rising thermals that stream upward from the surrounding mountains, may
arise in the evening. Likewise, dust storms can prowl the playa in packs or
sweep, in a broadened front, across the plain. Suddenly besetting us, they may
produce instant "white-outs". Seek immediate shelter and stay there. If you
are caught outside of shelter during this condition, simply sit down, cover
your face with your shirt and wait. Severe conditions rarely last more than
half an hour. Think of the playa as a giant mattress, flat and forgiving. In the
event of rain, again remain where you. Do not try to drive off the playa!
Rainfall here is quite selective. Fleeing a storm, you may merely gain a
wetter patch of ground and become mired. Sudden rainfall drains quickly
here. A three-hour shower may muddy the ground, but terrain will soon
become passable. Your best shelter is society. Should a major storm overtake
us, the Black Rock Rangers will patrol in emergency vehicles to rescue
straggling pedestrians. Nature is volatile at Black Rock, conditions change
suddenly, but, if you relax and stay calm, your patience will insure your
safety.

Freedom & the Media

Our only dogma on the playa is a simple rule: do nothing that interferes
with anyone's immediate experience. Our festival is dedicated to free
expression and we commend a broad tolerance for other peoples tastes. This
is a very large space and there is room for everybody. Obviously, anti-social
behavior represents very real interference with others, and the Black Rock
Rangers, helpful and hovering near, are ready to respond to any real
infraction of the public peace. More specifically, camera people and
journalists are also subject to this rule. Do not jump in front of the action,
obscure public view, or interfere with anyone's participation. On the other
hand, people do want pictures. Be reasonable. Should you feel that anyone
toting a camera is making a nuisance, contact a Ranger.

The policy of the Burning Man Project is to welcome journalists. We're
non-exclusive and regard coverage as a means of communication. We work
cooperatively with the media-- after all, they are helping us to affect the
outside world. Many who come here have learned about us through the
media. In exchange, however, we require reporters to absorb and respect our
unique ethos. Professional video crews are pledged not to interfere with your
experience. They are merely here to record what happens.



Community

Burning Man is an experiment in temporary community. Because many
people only know a world shaped by institutions, social service workers and
commercial transactions, they may not even recognize the signs of a
community. Here are a few indications: 

Capacity. 
     Communities are built on the recognition of the unique abilities of
     every member. Commerce and the public service sector define us on
     the basis of deficiency and need. 
Collective Effort. 
     Community is cooperative; uniting us as varied members of one body.
     When, by contrast, we consume a service, we're made passive. 50
     million people may view a television program or consume a beverage
     in complete isolation from one another. 
Informality. 
     In the community, transactions of value take place without money,
     advertising, or hype. Care emerges in place of structured service. 
Stories. 
     In universities, people know through studies. In businesses and
     bureaucracies, people know by reports. In communities, people know
     by stories. 
Celebration. 
     Community activities incorporate celebration, parties, and other social
     events. The line between work and play is blurred and the human
     nature of everyday life becomes part of the way of work. You will
     know that you are in a community if you often hear laughter and
     singing. 

Clean Up

Take nothing from the desert. Leave nothing behind. Every camping party is
responsible for its refuse. Part of the beauty of Black Rock is its astounding
blankness. Except for tire tracks and footprints, our policy is to leave the
desert a profoundly barren and empty corner of the world. All participants
are expected to participate in cleanup on Monday morning. Leave no debris
behind, including firewood, ashes, rocks and cigarette butts. Pick up
everything.

Hi everyone,

Here's the article for those of you who missed it. I'm transcribing it 
verbatim; it appeared in this am's Chronicle, although it looks like it  
originally may have come from the New York Times or its syndicate. Without 
further ado, then...

[headline] "Rave Drug Could Damage Brain"

[subhead] "Researchers say Ecstasy affects vital nerve cells"

"In experiments on animals, the popular street drug Ecstasy caused the 
brain to form abnormal connections that could lead to problems such as 
chronic depression, scientists have reported.

"The changes, which affect nerve cells throughout the brain, have been 
shown to occur on monkeys given 'recreational' doses of the drug. The 
finding is likely to apply to humans as well, said Dr. George Ricaurte, 
an assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine in Baltimore, who carried out the research.

"Dr. Lewis Seiden, a neuropharmacologist at the University of Chicago, 
said, 'This is an important basic research discovery with implications 
for people who take MDMA (Ecstasy).'

"The drug, a methamphetamine derivative, may have long-term harmful 
effects on appetite, sleep, mood, impulsiveness and other mental 
functions, he said. Similar problems may occur in people taking a 
chemically related diet pill, fenfluramine, which is popular in Europe.

"The extent of the damage probably varies with dosage, Ricaurte said. 
People who take Ecstasy three or four times a year might not notice any 
changes in their behavior or thinking. But those who take large amounts 
-- like seven or eight doses a night during the dance parties called 
raves -- could be inviting more serious problems.

"Ricaurte's study was published in the August issue of The Journal of 
Neuroscience and was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

"Ecstasy is popular on campuses in the United States, Ricaurte said. In 
Britain, where raves are popular, it is the second-most popular street 
drug, after marijuana.

"After taking Ecstasy, people report an extraordinary loss in inhibitions 
and feel love toward their fellow human beings, Ricaurte said. Ecstasy 
produces its effects for four to six hours, he said, yet no one knows how 
the drug works.

"It is known, however, that Ecstasy perturbs one of the brain's major 
chemical systems for transmitting information. The chemical serotonin is 
released from a bundle of nerve cells in the brain stem. These cells make 
dense, threadlike connections, called axons, to other nerve cells all 
over the brain and into the spinal cord.

"The new research took a closer look at this process in rats and monkeys. 
Animals were given recreational doses of Ecstasy -- the amounts taken by 
many young people -- and their brains were examined 12 to 18 months later. 
In rats, new axons grew and made normal-looking connections all over the 
brain, Ricaurte said. But in squirrel monkeys, he said the axon regrowth 
'was markedly abnormal.'"

A comment from me: is anyone out there really taking 7 or 8 doses a night 
at these "dance parties called raves"? I've never heard of it, and think 
this research could be seriously flawed if that was considered the 
typical or recreational dose.

Is it possible for anyone to get the original paper and post to the list?

Kathryn

Hi SFRavers -

 Anybody here going to the Friday thing at the Warfield? That's the ENIT
festival ( in assoc. w/ Lollapaloooza ) with Freaky Chakra , Single Cell
Orchestra, Sven Vath, Moby , Keoki , and Traci Lords and other folks.

 I'll be there - quite a mix of names! The Warfield isn't my favorite venue
for dancing , but maybe there be enough "intelligent dance music" to sit
down and listen to ....

abnormal connections?
This is a possibility... but it remains to be proven that these regrowth 
patterns *cause* depression etc...

"perturbs" is a very biased term... anything that dramatically affects your 
consciousness will signigicantly alter neurotransmitter 
output... whether this change is drug driven or not.

This reminds me of the the study done on rats to test the carcinogenic 
effects of Asarone (one of chemicals in Calamus), in which MASSIVE doses 
of the chemical were given to rats and found to be possibly cancer forming.
These results were then ludicrously extrapolated to human cases, 
completely ignoring the fact that human beings would *never* ingest that 
much asarone per body weight. Similarly, giving a rat, or even a squirrel 
monkey, a human dose of ecstasy, and then drawing possible conclusions 
for the human nervous system, may prove to be fallacious.
It is also interesting to note that no mention was made of a control 
group... I assume that there was one... but it's possible that there wasn't.

Nowhere does the article explicitly state that they were giving the
test animals *HUMAN* doses of X. I don't think it helps to confuse the
issue by attempting to link the methods in this study with old, widely
reported, and clearly flawed studies of carcinogenicity based on
massive doses of toxins.

Lets not jump to conclusions based on these kinds of specious arguments
until we see the full article, ok??

However, I will admit that the original article is unclear on the
actual amounts used in the study -- my feeling is that this is more a
problem with the general boneheadedness of Chronicle reporters than a
problem with the scientific study. Yes, the sentence "the amounts taken
by many young people" is quite ambiguous. In general, however, these
kinds of studies are based on equivalent ratios of drug-dose to body
weight of the test subject. 

Then again, I've independently determined (at least for myself) that
there is a strong correlation between taking X and depression, and this
also corresponds to statements and empirical observations made by other
people I've talked to as well. You may disagree, but lets get the facts
first before raising the spectre of yet another anti-drug conspiracy
under the guise of "science".

I definitely agree that there is some possible correlation between X 
and depression. I always get this empty void feeling after the 
weekend is over if I have done E and had a really good time. It 
usually happens when I am alone after all the fun is over. I don't 
think that iit is what the article is trying to call a "serious 
problem" though. I just feel that there is a balance to keep, like if 
you really have a wonderful time of course you are going to feel a 
slight longing for it to keep going. And after it is over of course 
you miss the feelings that you had, that is completely natural. And I 
think that X just amplifies those feelings just like all the other 
feelings you may have when you are on it. I don't believe I am going 
to become a manic depressive from taking MDMA, I just have to keep my 
wonderful, positive attitude going after everything is over, which 
may be difficult at times just because of fatigue, and the come-down, 
but it is nothing I believe to be a permanent problem caused by X.
This is just about me personally. I'm not saying that this happens to 
everyone, or that it should. It is just what I have observed 
personally, from my own experiences and some of my friends. It just 
goes to show that you always have to keep the feeling going, and 
always look up!

- squishes to all!

I hear the rats and monkeys given the "rave drug" were alone in a cage 
with no techno music and no dance floor.  No wonder they looked more 
depressed :)

I'd say over-reacting to this article is not in order.  While animal
analogue studies are often done to examine drug efficacy and side effects,
even researchers in the field will agree that the correlation with human
use is weak at best.  There is also a widespread misunderstanding that
all primates are basically the same as humans; this is true at some levels
but not others.

Nevertheless, caution is in order.  MDMA is powerful stuff, and "necking
an E" every time someone goes out is clearly not a good idea.

The mass media reports of these studies can almost always be discounted,
no matter what they say.  I'd be just as skeptical of a report that said,
"Ectasy proven new wonder drug, docs say take it three times a day."

The mass media reports medical research infrequently, badly and without
context.  Strike three.

I am not responding to the above e-mail, but forward on this message
to try and get help in unsubscribing to the SFRAVE line.  I have reason 
(very probable reason) to beleive that my incoming e-mail is sent first
to our D.P. dept. (read) and then pass on to each user.
I have typed "UNSCUBSCRIBE SFRAVES"  three or four time and have not
be able to disconect.  anyone out there have a suggestion for me.

 Yes and further more if they were getting any musical stimulation, it was

I totally agree with you... and was just stating my observations about 
the experiment... nowhere was I disagreeing with the possibility that X 
may be linked to depression, and in no way was I implying the existence 
of an anti-drug conspiracy...

Homeopaths take this rule quite literally, and thus, a drug, such as X, 
which induces an ecstatic state, according to some, will encourage the 
body to produce the opposite reaction, namely a depressing one. Once the 
drug has been eliminated by the body, it is thus entirely possible that 
all that is left for a while is the counterreactive state.

I know that a similar, yet more scientific, approach is used to explain 
certain aspects of *physical* dependence to depressant drugs, namely the 
nervous/anxious state that occurs after the high induced by opiates,
as well as the crash associated with stimulants such as cocaine. I am
not aware of any neuroscience that could also explain the 
post-X depression in such a fashion, but it is nontheless interesting to 
note the existence of a theoretical model, that of homeopathy, within which 
such a reaction is entirely justifiable.

Greetings!

Alas, tickets for F&F are *sold out*; ameba will not have any more.

Our apologies if you missed out on this one, however after our last
experience we felt that safety and comfort, in that order, should be the
factors driving the size of the party. In this case that translated to 500.

Trying to find big spaces that will go all ages, all night, at a very low
cost is extremely difficult.... Leads are always welcome =)

take it easy

	the most i've ever seen is 4 in one night, taken over a 5-6 hour 
period; this person had an increadibly high tolerance (it was good stuff 
too).  This was a one time thing as far as I know.  1-2 is a far more 
common doseage.

Hi Larry and all sfravers out there!

I'm still pretty new to sfraves and the bay area happenings and I will be
at ENIT and I will actually be going there (for the most part) by myself
and would love to meet you (and any sfravers, and hey _any_ friendly people
for that matter)!  

The vibe I get from everyone here is so good, so positive and strong, it
just fills me with energy and happiness.  Hope I can meet you (any of you)
and we can share some of that positive energy.  I'm hoping boogie down,
been seriously lacking in that department lately!

Hmm, how to recognize me?  Dunno what I'm gonna wear yet, probably dark
sneakers and navy blue dress or black skirt and blouse.  For sure I'll have
my trusty blue-grey mini backpack and my long wavy brown hair.

Hope to see some of you there!

hugz and smiles =)

One way I've found to be very effective for me, as far as feeling better
from and "enhanced" weekend is to take tyrosine before going to bed and a
dose of phenylalanine after waking up.  I seem to notice a definite easing
of those post party blahs.

Does anyone know how well these non-essential amino acids interact with
other "substannces"?

Popular Drug May Damage Brain

By SANDRA BLAKESLEE


   In experiments on animals, a popular street drug called Ecstasy caused the
brain to form abnormal connections that could lead to problems like chronic
depression, scientists have reported.

   The changes, which affect nerve cells throughout the brain, have been
shown to occur in monkeys given recreational doses of the drug. Thus the
finding is likely to apply to humans as well, said Dr. George Ricaurte, an
assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore, who carried out the research.

   Dr. Lewis Seiden, a neuropharmacologist at the University of Chicago,
said, "This is an important basic research discovery with implications for
people who take MDMA," or Ecstasy. The drug, a methamphetamine derivative,
may have long-term, harmful effects on appetite, sleep, mood, impulsiveness
and other mental functions, he said. Similar problems may occur in people
taking a chemically related diet pill, fenfluramine, which is popular in
Europe.

   The extent of the damage probably varies with dosage, Ricaurte said.
People who take Ecstasy three or four times a year might not notice any
changes in their behavior or thinking. But those who take large amounts -
like seven or eight doses a night during the dance parties called raves -
could be inviting more serious problems.

   Ricaurte's study was published in the August issue of The Journal of
Neuroscience and was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

   Ecstasy is popular on campuses in the United States, Ricaurte said. In
Britain, where raves are popular, it is the second most popular street drug,
after marijuana.

   After taking Ecstasy, people report an extraordinary loss of inhibitions
and feel love toward their fellow human beings, Ricaurte said.

   Ecstasy produces its effects for four to six hours, he said, yet no one
knows how the drug works.

   It is known, however, that Ecstasy perturbs one of the brain's major
chemical systems for transmitting information. The chemical serotonin is
released from a bundle of nerve cells in the brain stem. These cells make
dense, threadlike connections, called axons, to other nerve cells all over
the brain and into the spinal cord. The axons, when electrically activated,
squirt serotonin onto cells in the cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus and
midbrain regions.

   Previous research showed that Ecstasy destroys serotonin-carrying axons,
Ricaurte said. The drug "literally prunes the axon projections," he said,
while leaving the cell bodies alone. Then, in ways that are not yet
understood, the axons tend to regenerate and make new connections in the
brain.

   The new research took a closer look at this process in rats and monkeys.
Animals were given recreational doses of Ecstasy - the amounts taken by many
young people - and their brains were examined 12 to 18 months later.

   In rats, new axons grew and made normal-looking connections all over the
brain, Ricaurte said. But in squirrel monkeys, he said, the axon regrowth
"was markedly abnormal." Connections to nearby targets like the amygdala and
hypothalamus - circuits that help control emotion and hormone balance - were
overabundant. And reconnections to the higher cortex were absent.

   It seems that the shorter axonal projections recover but the longer ones
do not, Ricaurte said.

   Serotonin helps regulate mood, appetite and cognition, Ricaurte said.
People taking high doses of Ecstasy could suffer permanent damage to their
serotonin systems, he said, which could lead to chronic mood, memory and
sleep problems.

   The appetite suppressant fenfluramine, sold under the trade name Pondimin,
produces the same neurotoxicity as Ecstasy in mice, rats and monkeys,
Ricaurte said. The worry is that people take diet pills for long periods. "It
may well be that the doses used in humans could be without neurotoxic
effects, but we should look," he said.

   A federal study last year found no evidence that fenfluramine caused
permanent brain damage.

After being at a couple F&F that were pretty crowded, I applaude the effort
to strictly limit the attendance.

Have you thought about setting up your site for two nights?  That way, you
could double the people who get to experience F&F, with minimal impact on
time and costs for setup (sound & lights are generally cheaper for a second
consecutive night)

        along this line, here's something i just posted to ne-raves where
we're talking about the same article.
--------
        sorry, i've snipped this entire article as i'm sure y'all have read
it.  What i'd like to pick up on is that the dangers here, or apparent
dangers, arise from the belief that there is a causal relationship between
mood and neurochemistry/brain structure and that this relationship goes one
way: your neurochemistry/brain structure affects your mood.  Now, i'm not a
neuropsychologist, nor am i a chemist, nor am i even closely related to any
scientific field
        BUT...
                i have an inkling that the relationship between
neurochemistry and mood is not a one way thing.  I suppose that it goes
back to the notion that mind and body are separate and that the flow of
cause and effect runs from body _to_ mind. (you do e, you feel good). I
think, rather, that mood is an index of a _synergy_ between neurochemistry,
organic brain matter, 'mind' and numerous other factors.  Because you
change one factor in the equation doesn't necessarily mean that you will
always end up with the same results.  So, if you are creating new pathways
and connections in your brain, this may be only a small alteration in 'the
big picture.'
        My example would be that you can alter someone's neurochemistry
with prozac, which creates 'happy thoughts' but, after the drug wears off
what are you left with? The homeostatic nature of your body 'naturally'
will try to maintain a balance between your highs and your lows. So, you
feel a bit down afterwards.  Maybe the person returns to their normal
thought and behaviour patterns or, MAYBE, the ability to shift gears to a
new way of thinking is realized from the chemical which, after the chemical
has left the body 'causes' the brain to utilize the neurochemicals that
'produce' happy thoughts.  (MIND affects BODY).
        Think about this analogy: your mood is sort of like a thermostat
and say it's set at 20 degrees celsius (which, for you americans is room
temperature ;) haha).  When it gets cold in the house the heat comes on and
the temperature of the house rises up to 20 deg, then the heat turns off.
When it gets hot, the air conditioning comes on to cool the house back to
20 degrees celsius.  Imagine your mood as a thermostat and, IMHO,
everyone's is at different temperatures but some of us, like me, had their
thermostats set REALLY low.
        What i'm trying to say is that, from personal experience, you can
have a variety of factors that make you depressed.  Chemistry is one of
them, surroundings and environment are another, past experiences and
psychological history are another and your 'way of thinking/percieving
things' is another.  I'm sure that there are a LOT more things that affect
your mood, a lot of them that we can't percieve...yet.  Anyways, thinking
about this, i've realized that my 'mean mood' (and i mean mean as in
average, haha) was pretty low for a LONG time, but one factor entered my
uhhh biological system and that caused a shift in my way of thinking, which
caused a shift in my environment and perceptions and that caused a shift in
my behaviour which caused a shift in what kinds of chemicals were in my
body which caused a shift in....ad infinitum.  The result was that my 'mean
mood' was not so down anymore.  I moved from below room temperature to HOT!
;) haha...well maybe i exaggerate.  Now, for me, the 'result' of the shift
in factors that i've described has raised my level up a LOT.  To the point
where the chemical _additions_ to my system aren't as necessary, the whole
equation can balance itself out.
        This is true for me, but, of course, not true across the board. If
i said it was i'd be following along the same line of logic as Ricaurte and
i think when you are dealing with a system as non-linear as mood, making
objective statements about a+b=c doesn't work. Non-linearity is, by nature,
unpredictable.  I know ppl who are depressed wrecks now after doing e (and
not in any excessive manner) but i also know people who's lives have been
altered for the good (i am tempted to say permanently but i won't).  I
think that one factor that might affect which way one goes is an idea of
what i'm saying. Maybe. and that's why i posted this, maybe if you take
this to heart ;) it will affect your examination of MDMA's effects on you
and your life and if you think of things in this way you can cut depression
off at the pass, so to speak. Shit, wouldn't it be AMAZING if EVERYONE who
did e and went out to parties and all that learned how to create their own
natural E-vibe and didn't say things like "i feel crappy, i need some
drugs," but instead said "i'm feeling crappy, look at that person and how
happy and beautiful they are, how much fun they're having" and BZZZAP you
are feeling good because your thoughts have affected your mood and probably
your neurochemistry.  I don't know, it works for me.
        hmm..i don't know if i'm making ANY sense (must have been all those
drugs i did in my past ;) haha).
        think happy,

You can pick 'em up @ Solid Grooves on S. Bascom is SJ.  I forgot how 
much it cost.  Call 'em @ 408-999-0259 ask for Harry or Brandon.  They'll 
sort you out.

Note:  Although the crates are quite nice, the are also heavy.  Packin' 
'em w/ records, and trying to take a trek is an excersize in strenght and 
endurance.  The side handles are fine if the thing is 1/2 full, but 
packed its difficult to carry.  Prefer a metal case with the handle a the 
top.

the case itself is a great utilitarian item.  the top can be used to hold 
recs during a set, blah, blah, blah....

good luck.

Peace,
John

The following is information on Tyrosine and Phenylalanine was derived from
Earl Mindell's Vitamin Bible (Warner Bro's Books):

TYROSINE although a nonessential amino acid, is a high ranking
neurotransmitter and is important in it's role of stimulating and modifying
brain activity.  For instance, in order for phenylalanine to be effective
as a mood elevator, it must first be converted into tyrosine. If this
conversion does not occur because of some enzyme deficiency or a great need
elsewhere in the body for phenylalanine, insufficient quantities of
norepinephrine will be produced by the brain and depression will occur...

....Tyrosine has been used to help cocaine addicts kick their habits by
helping to avert the depression, fatigue, and irritability that accompanies
withdrawal.
(works for nicotine addicts as well) a regimen of tyrosine hydroxylase (the
enzyme that lets the body use tyrosine), and vitamins B1, B2 and niacin
seems to work....

PHENYLALANINE is an essential amino acid that is a high ranking
neurotransmitter. a chemical hat transmits its signals between the nerve
cells and the brain.  In the body, it's turned into norepinephrine and
dopamine, excitatory transmitters, which promote alertness and vitality.
Phenylalanine reduces hunger, increases sexual interest, improves memory
and mental alertness, alleviates depression.  Phenylalanine is available in
250-500mg tablets.  For appetite control, tablets should be taken one hour
before meals with juice or water(no protein).  For general alertness and
vitality, tablets hould be taken between meals with water or juice (again,
no protein). Phenylalanine is non addictive.  CAUTION! Phenylalanine is
contraindicated during pregnancy and people with PKU (phenylketonuria) or
skin cancer.

Well, there ya go.  I would recommend getting the book to get more details.
The book also contains cross references to other vitamins and nutrients
that work well together as well as safety precautions and dosage tables.
As with anything I would recommend caution and education when using these
types of supplements.

Hope this helps!

Peace

You can find Dr. George Ricaurte's e-mail address in that first document. I
would say, though, that if anyone wishes to contact him, try to coordinate
it through one person so that he doesn't get a flood of mail (as he
probably already will from many other sources!). Find out the info, then
post it to the list for others. I'd do this myself, but I don't have the

  Tigger's posting was essentially right.
Tyrosine has been used extensively by clinics to help people quit
stimulants, since it is used to replenish norepinephrine and dopamine
after periods of high neuronal firing.. (this also applies to stress)
The most interesting studies have been done by the military.
One thing that he didn't mention is that tyrosine should be taken in the
early morning, and that repeated, smaller dosages are better than one
big one...

Tyrosine will not reduce MDMA neurotoxicity, though.. just alleviate
some of the catecholamine depletion...

Scientists, after years of intensive research, have concluded that
  the exotic drug <alcohol>, found in many common beverages consumed
    by yuppies, business and sports types, may actually affect the
      health of brain cells:

  "it's extraordinary, the damage it can cause", quoted one scientist

  "there's definitely a link between abuse of this drug and health",
    said another authoritative source.

the exact consumption of this drug by the general populace is unknown,
  due to lack of research and also due to the forgetfullness of almost
    all clinical testing participants.

  "it definitely affects my brain, man" said one participant

  "wow. i'm drunk". said another

the conclusion drawn by our elite band of researchers: moderate use of
  this drug, or even occasional use, KILLS brain cells.  the DEA is, of
    course, considering applying a schedule to this new, exotic drug,
      before it is discovered by the majority of the populace.

Phenylalanine is excellent for post-amphetamine depression.  (You know, that
"down" feeling the next day ;)  And can be taken daily as a dietary
supplement.  Though subtle, it has been effective for me.  You can find it
at just about any health food store.  Phenylalanine is also found in
Nutrasweet and therefore in Extra gum, Swiss Miss Sugar Free Hot Chocolate,
and so on... but hardly in effective doses.

One more word about brown spots in your E or "brown spots in my frat boys"
(as the thread used to be :)

Word from a chemist I know (take it for what it is...):
The brown spotted tabs or chocolate chip or whatever you call that stuff is
"MPPP" which was explained to me to be a synthetic derivative of heroin
which, because it's been resynthesized, IS orally active.  Yet another
theory to throw in the loop...

BTW, I'm back after being off the list for several months!  I hate my first
post back being all chemistry-related, but I can't seem to keep my mouth
shut. :P  Anyway, it was great to come back on and have the first posts I
see be about people helping to support each other through difficult times. 
I had forgotten what a tightly knit family this is.  You guys are the

C'mon guys.  Everything we consume has some toxicity associated with it.  
As for synthetics, who the hell knows for sure?  Not enough research has 
been done on X or any other "illicit" drug to really find out what the 
long term effects of its use are.

The dismissal by some of E's toxicity by illustrating a legal drug does 
nobody a service.  Fact is I trust booze alot more than I trust E.  Why?  
Controls used in manufacture.  Simple as that.  E is not commercially 
avaialble.  the shit is made at labs sprinkled all over the place, as 
well as some pharm labs that stay open really late (done by some who 
moonlight).  A simple question, do you trust your brain on some chemist 
who does not have the quality controls avaialble to large commercial 
pharm. plants?  I do, on RARE occasions.  But alot less now than in the 
past.  I really try to stay away from the stuff.

The E that is going around now ain't the same shit I was taking years back.
As for booze, its pretty much the same, if not higher quality than 
previous years.

Booze is no more evil than E.  I would venture to say that E, and the 
business thereof is pretty evil.  The love you're feelin' on the dance 
floor, is not the same vibe that took place when you bought it for 
$15-$20, is not the same vibe when he bought it for $5-$10 dollars, is not 
the same vibe as the person who sold it to him for $3-$5 per.  People 
have been killed, framed, spent time in prison, and turned in their 
friends due to this "feel good" drug.  Can't really say that about booze 
since the lifting of prohibition now can you?

Yes, btw, I am for legalization of ALL drugs.  That would help the 
quality and underground issues assocaited w/ the drug.

I just hate to see people slam my fav beverage (beer), in favor of some 
uncontrolled crackerjack powder with a specific gravity less than 1.

Many things can be good when done in moderation.  I think E should be 
done in extreme moderation until quality can be assured.  And that will 
only happen when its legalized, and unfortunately taxed.

this is of course IMHO.

Shake your ass and your brain might follow,
John

I'm going too!  Anybody up for meeting and having a pre-event dinner at Tu
Lan (sp?) on 6th Street, across from the Warfield? How about grabbing a
table around 8:00 or so (doors @ 9 p.m.)?

	Don't really agree with this. The evils you cite, and attribute
	to E, are not really a product of the chemical itself. Blaming
	an expensive powder for what are, essentially, human failings
	doesn't seem to make sense. I don't blame alcohol for all but
	destroying the life of people close to me; hootch aint' evil,
	it just is, same as E. 

	You're right though, people should be aware of the crap that 	
	surrounds the pills they pop, much of it due to the legal status
	of the drug - they should also know that they're taking a risk 
	when they do this. If your not completely sure of the source
	of the drug, then there's always the chance its going to do you
	some serious harm.

	When I first became informed, through the usenet, of some of
	the truth behind the propaganda spread about drugs; I started
 	jumping conclusions about 'scientific' studies that I've
	seen echoed here in a few posts on the subject. Now, while
	remaining sceptical about mainstream drug research and media
	coverage, I don't pay that much heed to it. Many scientific 
	'facts' are ephemeral in nature, for better or for worse, some
	more concrete than others. Other dangers seem more obvious to me. 

	Anyway, most drugs are dangerous in some ways, a lot of them are 
	also a whole lot of fun. Pays yer money and take your chance,

	Peace, 
	Gary

Wow, now that F&F has become such a massive party, maybe we should 
consider changing its name to "Friends, Family, Friends of the Family, 
Friends of the Friends of the Family, People Who Met Some Friends of the 
Family at a Rave, and Some Other Folks Who Heard About the Party from a 
Friend of Theirs"  Or is that too long?  :)

I spoke with Rick Doblin today who just talked with Ricarte. The key point of the recent studys:
1. The experiments on the spider monkeys were done with subcutaneous injections of MDMA at doses 2.5 times the normal human dose which in humans would be equivalent to 5 times the human dose since we take the drug orally and don't shoot it up.
2. The doses were administered every 8 hours for two days.
3. The results showed that the dendrites on serotonin neurons grew back irregularly
4. There was no behavioral changes noticed in the monkeys
5. There have been no behavioral changes noticed in humans, even older humans. 
6. There is a lot of speculation in the article but no conclusive evidence of anything to worry about
7. A study done last year with fenfloramine, an appetite suppressant which has identical effects on brain cells as reported above with MDMA  The drug has been used on a daily basis by many people for years and continues to be, it was just written up as the most promising weight control method in a recent issue of <cough cough> Readers Digest.  
A study done with people who used fenfloramine was conducted last year and showed no evidence of brain damage in those who used fenfloramine for many years.  No behavioral abnormalities. Perhaps Dr. Ricartte wishes to dissect these people and examine their brains? 
Let's end the propaganda war against drugs. Ricarte gets his money from NIDA. Let's spend the money to research and legalize drugs, not spread fear among the portulaca!

 Meeting at Tu Lan sounds nice - I may not eat , as I think I'll
want dinner earlier than 8PM. I think I wouldn't mind meeting folks there
for some tea though !

Good thought.  Um, bring an emergency pair of warm clothes in case it
rains and turns the playa into mud.  That happened one year.

The soil isn't sandy, its like packed talcum powder.  It's actually quite an
effort to sink stakes in past the first 3 inches or so.  Last year I had a
large 6 man tent, and once we staked it down we had no trouble with the
wind.

Because its so dry its pretty easy to conk out in the heat.

If you got an umbrella that can block the light, that's pretty cool too.

If you stay in the denser areas around the man, you can use the man and the
navigational light poles (bright blue lights) to find your camp.  Just
familiarize yourself with the layout of the camp during the day.  The only
way to get really lost is to travel out of sight of the man or to take to
many drugs.

Note to trippers, make sure you have a sober guide with you before you go on
jaunts.  Things get really chaotic around the camp.

There are no animals or plants on the dry lake bed.  It's hundreds of square
miles of featureless flatness.

Extremely doubtful. This is a synthetic heroin derivitave that's not too
common and is active at ridiculously low doses with a low margin of safety.
(It's easy to OD if you do too much). Unless he can come up with some NMR
results I'd say he's been seriously misinformed.

There's a simple explanation for dark spots - safrole. A necessary
precursor which is brown. Ever seen "black licorice" e? It's got a lot of
unsynthsized safrole in it and it's very dark brown.

The heroin feeling some e gives you means it's likely to be MDA or MDEA.

I write techno/house music and use live drums (congas, bongos, djembe, etc.)
while writing.  The combination of old technology with new technology can be
quite profound.  

>It's great for the people drumming, but hell for the people

But your right, you gotta be a good drummer and be able to keep a repetitive
beat....well!  More than a couple of drummers at a time just ruins the music
in most cases, but I'm sure there are exceptions.

Subject: Are your co-workers space aliens?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

The following is not rave-related, but I thought it might put a grin on
your faces...

(This article has been attributed to a number of different sources,
mostly tabloid magazines, but apparently the real author is concealing
his identity. Probably for fear of alien retaliation.)

Many Americans work side by side with space aliens who look human --
but you can spot these visitors by looking for certain tip-offs, say
experts. They listed 10 signs to watch for:

  1. Odd or mismatched clothes. "Often space aliens don't fully
     understand the different styles, so they wear combinations that
     are in bad taste, such as checked pants with a striped shirt or a
     tuxedo jacket with blue jeans or sneakers," noted Brad Steiger, a
     renowned UFO investigator and author.

  2. Strange diet or unusual eating habits. Space aliens might eat
     French fries with a spoon or gobble down large amounts of pills,
     the experts say.

  3. Bizarre sense of humor. Space aliens who don't understand earthly
     humor may laugh during a serious company training film or tell
     jokes that no one understands, said Steiger.

  4. Takes frequent sick days. A space alien might need extra time off
     to "rejuvenate its energy," said Dr. Thomas Easton, a theoretical
     biologist and futurist.

  5. Keeps a written or tape recorded diary. "Aliens are constantly
     gathering information," said Steiger.

  6. Misuses everday items. "A space alien may use correction fluid to
     paint its nails," said Steiger.

  7. Constant questioning about customs of co-workers. Space aliens
     who are trying to learn about earth culture might ask questions
     that seem stupid, Easton said. "For example, a co-worker may ask
     why so many Americans picnic on the Fourth of July," noted
     Steiger.

  8. Secretive about personal lifestyle and home. "An alien won't
     discuss domestic details or talk about what it does at night or
     on weekends," said Steiger.

  9. Frequently talks to himself. "An alien may not be used to
     speaking as we do, so it may practice speaking," Steiger noted.

 10. Displays a change of mood or physical reaction when near certain
     high-tech hardware. "An alien may experience a mood change when a
     microwave oven is turned on," said Steiger.

The experts point out that a co-worker would have to display most if
not all of these traits before you can positively identify him as a
space alien.

Greetings Friends!

Let me preface this by saying that it pains me greatly to have to sound
this heavy handed. However, I've got wind of a rumour that there will be
some tickets for F&F at the door...

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE.

No one without tickets, whether or not we know you, whether or not you flew
in from Germany, whether or not you're one person in a car with 4 ticket
holders, you will not get in. We are absolutely committed to this.

Additionally, loads of excess people (and thier) cars endeavoring to get in
will only endanger the party. So if you don't have tix and could make other
plans for the evening we would all really appreciate it.

Once again, we deeply regret not being able to accomodate everyone but feel
it is the only conscienable way to proceed.

thanks much
ethan

After reading a LOT of messages about various problems encountered with
synthetic drugs (Particularly everyone's fav MDMA) over the years on this
list, I've come to the conclusion that SFRaves needs to create a
buyer's/synthesizer's club. Chemically knowledgable synthesis folks could
be supplied with a stable source of stress-free non-narc clientele. Happy
ravers could be assured that they're getting pharmaceutical grade MDMA (or
whatever synthetic bops their bippy). World peace breaks out; hunger and
disease are eradicated; everyone lives happily ever after. Love spreads.
Mass empathy takes hold of the planet. All of life's problems solved,
humanity evolves to the next level where we are creatures of pure light
without heat, pure thought...

Personally, I like this idea a lot. :) OK? Where do we start?


And hey, for those of the law-enforcement persuasion that may be reading
this: We're speaking entirely hypothetically here. No one on this list
WOULD NEVER EVEN THINK of having ANYTHING to do with the EVIL SCOURGE ON
HUMANITY that ILLEGAL DRUGS represent.

We're all too busy getting drop-dead drunk on everclear and getting behind
the wheel, headed for your local elementary school's sidewalks. Cigarette
in hand, another in mouth. Hopped up on legally prescribed pain-killers,
sleep aids, and anti-depressants. The medicine cabinet's empty, better head
for the local drugstore to fill up.

Really, it's just a joke. Right?

The ENIT festival features a bunch of big names and a big price tag.  
Frequency 8 or Out-A-Sight may prove to be the better value...
On Saturday, Tribal Funk has a great lineup as does Eternia, although
both may be large and pricey.  I removed the listing for the
other party on Saturday since there are no tickets left.  Don't try to
go if you don't already have a ticket.

Thanks to all who have been sending in info...

This jogged a memory of a service in SF several years ago where you could
send in small samples of whatever for analysis. Don't recall who it was or
how in the world they convinced people to give an address for results --
maybe a number system where you just called in to get the results or
something.  Sorry for such a vague post, maybe I can track down more info.

Brian's alter ego states:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I've come to the conclusion that SFRaves needs to create a 
buyer's/synthesizer's club. Chemically knowledgable synthesis folks could 
be supplied with a stable source of stress-free non-narc clientele. Happy 
ravers could be assured that they're getting pharmaceutical grade MDMA (or 
whatever synthetic bops their bippy)....
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

WOW! I like that idea! :) Too funny.. It'd be like a co-op, but we'd
replace the O's, an in "Oh No!" or "Oh me god!", with E's...

.. but then, it'd be a Ce-ep, which sounds like a French Espresso Machine 
or s'mthing. !?!

On a related note, about the time of the New Year's last year, I remember 
that there was a major 'drug' bust in the Bay Area, where 40,000 hits of E 
were confiscated. 40,000!!!! Therefore, a friend and I then hypothesised 
that the correct thing for the Feds to do would've been to hand it over to 
NATO so they could airdrop it all over Bosnia and the rest of what was 
Yugoslavia!

If you must go to a rave this saturday:

FYI:

     Ethernia is being thrown by XYZ promoters.  If you have enjoyed the 
last two parties they have thrown and if you think the vibes at their parties
are good, then Richmond is the place for you.....otherwise, Trible Funk is at 
Santa Cruz and since Galen is spining there, then maybe there is an after 
party called......"Sunrise on the Beach" instead of Sunset.  Call Trible 
Funk on saturday and they will tell you where "Sunset" will be held.  
It's there little suprise.....but shhhhhhhhhh you didn't here that from me.

Otis.

Dear All;

	I totally agree with all that's been said, E is Not cut with 
Herion. First of all having tried China White, Mexican Black Tar, & 
French Synthetic Herion, the high is nothing like anything I've ever 
experienced on any E. Herion is any of its forms both pharm, & black 
market would kill a lot of people who weren't used to it, due to respitory 
depression., not to mention the cost increase of the drug itself. 

	For me however, having done the two together (prescribtion narcotics 
& E) the high is something to experience, & I find it very enjoyable. 
However I would not recommend that anyone try this unless they are very 
familar with the effects of both of those drugs separately, and then 
being very conservative, and slowly increaseing the dose of each(together) 
over time, and incidence.

	But hears the ?, if herion & speed is called a speed ball, & E &
acid is called candy flipping or trolling, then what would E & narcotics
be called? Suggestions welcome

As someone who comes from a country where 60% of all crime is alchahol 
related the piece of news that alchahol causes damage of the brain cells 
comes as no surprise to me; anyway, I thought that had already been 
prooven previously.  Alchahol is, with out a doubt one of the most 
fucked-up and bad drugs on the market.  It causes personality changes, 
fucks you up more physically then anyother drug with maybe the exception 
of herione, and one is always forced to buy the shitty tampered with 
version.  Imagine if everytime you went to buy pot it was watered down to 
a tenth of it's original strength; well that's what you do everytime you 
buy alchahol at a store.  It is also one of the cheapest drugs to 
manifacture yet, proportionatly, it is the most expensive.  And apart from 
having the effect of making girls really horney it has got nothing else 
going for it what so ever.  Maybe that's why me, an individual who at one 
or another has taken every known recreational drug known to man, never 
even started to drink until I was twenty-two years of age after I had 
already tried out everything else.  Take it from me boys, alchahol has 
got nothing going for it and if ever a drug needed hardercore leglslation 
to restrict it's use it is this drug.
So I say fuck alchahol, stay in the pink with pot and LSD instead.

Oh dear, I thought people were a bit more clued in then this.  Anybody 
who says that E is just as evil as alchahol has clearly nnever been to a 
bar in surbrben England before.  E is expensive because it is illegal and 
the people who are making it are doing so with good intentions where as 
the people who make alchahol will put anything in it to make it last 
longer and go further, whereas you simply can not do this to E because 
the watering down stage would mean that the substance was no longer E.    
Alchahol causes violence, bigitory, husbands to 
beat up on wives/kids as well allowing Governments to continue to keep us 
as slaves.  If you are a conspiritist like me then you know that 
alchaholol and the creation of safe facards by States are very closely 
linked; why do you think that sport and the alchahol company's have such 
a close relationship with eachother?  In short, I'll be an E head and you 
be a drinker, and I garentee that I'll be in heaven before ye.

As for clued in, I see you're still using someones elses account ;).
Its not that E or booze is inherently evil.  They are just what they are,
drugs. The problem lies in their status within a society, and who stands to
profit or lose from said status.  In the case of booze, large, and small
companies benefit.  The users of the substances benefit as well, when its
used properly.  Booze in excess, or given to those who cannot handle it,
can lead to the problems you cited above.  E when used in excess can do the
same thing.  The fact that E is illegal means that there is an underworld
current that is involved in its manufacture, distrbution, and sales.  There
certainly might be some who do the manufacture for the love, but I doubt
it.  Its a matter of money. To deny that people have been subject to
violence of all kinds due to E's illegal nature, is to deny a reality that
many of us in SF are well aware.  I know people who have been threatened,
and harmed due to E.  There are people on the run due to E.  There have
been people deported to to E.  I KNOW if E was legal none of this would've
happened.   You also dismiss the factor of controls in manufacture.  How
many people have been sick due to "bad" E, or stuff being passed as E that
was really something else.  Controls, especially in the synthetic drug
realm, are quite important to its effectiveness, and realiability.  Shit
being done by people who THINK they know what they are doing (i'm talking
about making the shit), put everyone at risk when safety, and controls are
put aside.

E will not change the world. E is not a cure all.  It does not stop
bigotry, wife beating, or other severities of emotion.  Fact is you can do
as much damage on E to someone as you can do on booze.  It can amplify
emotions, both good and bad. E is illegal, which means there is major
profit to be had in its manufacture/distribution by underworld types (just
ask many SF denizens if they know anybody that has served timne for E,
they'll tell ya! And how many are on the run because of it...).  There are
no controls on its manufacture, which opens up the possibility of sloppy
work during its synthesis.  LSD and other illegal synthetics suffer from
the smae pilght.  Its a matter of status.
The same problems of manufacture/dist. of weed apply as well.  But I'll
tell you this, I'd rather smoke hella weed before I take another hit of E.
Weed is organic, besides, nature can be the overall controller.  She hardly
does wrong when it comes to what she does best, growing living green bud!

As for who'll get to heaven I quote Milton from Paradise Lost: "It is
better to rule in hell than serve in heaven."

As for you being an E head, be my guest. I've already done enough of that
shit to be one happy slappy motherf*cker for the next decade.  I don't need
something to help me empathize with people, I can do it naturally.  IMO,
the only real drug that can bring people together is weed, pre-dates E and
all that other synthetic shit.  As for beer, the egyptians had godesses of
the substance.  It is, throughout history, the great equalizer among
men/women.  Either IMO should be used in moderation.  When done in that
fashion you can't beat 'em.

Funny tho'.  I have seen one fistfight with two dudes on E.  I have been to
parties where everyone was on weed & beer.  Fact is, muthas was so busy
getting high, and enjoyin brew, the most you would want to do is either
sleep or just sit there and enjoy each others company.  Weed, when used at
hip-hop shows, gets even the meanest mutha to say hi, gives props, and say
YO!  Never seen a fight when everybody on the sinse.

Here in Colorado we are trying to use Cu-SeeMe (video-conferencing over 
the Internet) to link some parties (raves) in a couple weeks -- Skylab, 
Narnia, one in Tornto, etc.

However, I need to know if the Cu-SeeMe reflector is working or not.  So, 
could you please try out the following reflector if you are familiar with 
Cu-SeeMe:

		128.138.126.10

And please email me if it works or doesn't work, and if it doesn't work, 
let me know if you get a no response message or what happens (and 
doesn't happen).....my email address is hawks@colorado.edu.

Thanks for helping....

Granted, nevertheless lacking smileys (or something similar), many might
not get it; personally, I'd prefer no confusion on the subject.

Beyond which, I was hoping to treat what, to me, is a painful, sensitive,
and unfortunately very important issue with some degree of subtlety which
is why I specifically avoided pharses like "stay away." The last thing in
the world I want to say is "stay away" from our party :( So it pains me
that I take pains to not to say it (that way) only to have it said anyway.

Certainly no biggie though.

take it easy

     Last night, after a pre-Burning Man test run w/the online Organic 
     crew, I stopped by 111 Minna to check out Anarchist Disco.  A friend 
     of mine told me that last week it got shut down by SF's finest.  When 
     I got there, nothing was going on 'cause the police are requiring 
     $$permits$$ to "allow" it to happen.
     
     Any word from the organizers of this gig on whether or not they'll 
     hold it at another venue?  I heard it went really well before it got 
     shut down and it's right up my alley w/a mixture of art, music, dance, 
     etc. 
     
     On another note, the online Organic people are totally jazzing me and 
     our rv crew w/the chill space they're devising for Burning Man.  If 
     you're going to be there, come on by and chill w/us.  There's alot of 
     love for art and life that's being put into this and we'd love to 
     share it with y'all.
     
     See you at F&F!

Hey everyone...I'm a lurker down here in Southern California!  (I moved 
down here in December from the Bay Area (Walnut Creek))

I'm coming up for Labor Day Weekend & was wondering if people were 
going to be around & what they'd be doing!  Or is everyone going to 
Burning Man?

It would be cool to meet some of you!!  I've met a lot of people through 
the Socal-raves list & got a lot of good friends through it!!

tickets away for me & they'll be at the door, or if they can make 
arrangements to meet me in SF today, I've be in town from about 2pm on, 
or I image at Frequency 8 tonight or the East Bay, that would be cool 
too. Page me at the number listed below, thanks, or just e-mail me, see ya

I know a while back this was talked about, but I don't remember what was 
said. My question is how long does MDMA (E or X whatever) stay in your 
system? If a urine drug test was given how long would it be from the time 
of of taking the drug to the time of the test, when would it not show up?

Any info would make me happy. =)

        Reply to:   RE>This Week's SFR Calendar!

Have you ever considered adding the Elbo Room (trip-hop/ some funk jazz) to
the Thursday Weeklies' list?  Just curious, for all I know there may be a
reason as to why it's not there.  Just inquiring...

The ENIT festival features a bunch of big names and a big price tag.  
Frequency 8 or Out-A-Sight may prove to be the better value...
On Saturday, Tribal Funk has a great lineup as does Eternia, although
both may be large and pricey.  I removed the listing for the
other party on Saturday since there are no tickets left.  Don't try to
go if you don't already have a ticket.

Thanks to all who have been sending in info...

Wondering who all those SF Ravers are that you share the list with?  

Well, me too.  As a public service I'll wear my flourescent orange cap that
sayz "Wired" on the front all weekend.  It's very visible and you should
see it at F8 on friday, F&F on Sat, and the Robot Wars afterparty on Sun.
If you introduce yourself I'll be happy to point out or introduce you to
any SFRAVERs in sight (and anyone else I know).  

Ciao,

I got back from my powerwalk a little while ago - my batteries in my 
walkman were really low, so I had to turn off Garth and in doing that I 
started thinking........

I look around me and am just fed up and disgusted in this society I live 
in.  So often I want to escape and have no part of it. People's 
rudeness, the oppression of our government, radical religious fanatics 
who wish their beliefs to be law for countless others of different 
belief systems....I could go on and on.  It seems as if "life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness" is being corroded away everyday.  Dian's 
post about how permits were needed were just another example.  I could 
easily see something like the Criminal Justice Act over in England 
happening here.  The fact that something like that exists *anywhere* 
disgusts me. 

One of the main reasons I love raving so much is that it forms its very 
own society for a few hours, anyway. I always leave a party a little bit 
sad for having to face "reality" again. But, again, so often we are 
"unallowed" to be together for one reason or another: sound permits, 
trespassing, etc.  It shouldn't be that difficult to do something like 
throw a small party for godssake!  

I'm tired.  I'm tired of feeling saddened every time I have to leave my 
little rave community and integrate into a world I want no part of. I 
want to live a more simple life:  work for a community as a whole - not 
just for myself or some faceless, greedy corporation (hmmm...sounds like 
what Pacific and Gateway does for us, no?) I don't think I'm the only 
one who feels like this.  I think more and more people are becoming fed 
up and restless with their lives.  We all have a choice and as so many 
Americans preach, "if you don't like it, then leave!!"  If enough of us 
are indeed willing to sacrafice and make a huge change, then we CAN live 
in a society that we want to and we will gladly leave.  I think I 
decided to go to Burning Man this year because my subconscience told me 
I was ready and that this was a small taste of what it will be like.  

If any of you feel as I do, please, let's talk. I get so many others who 
give me reasons why it wouldn't work - I need encouragement, not 
discouragement.  So what if it sounds like I'm talking about forming a 
hippie commune - we can make it what we want someday. It *WILL* happen 
one day if our will to change directs us to do so. 

Well, I will see you all in that little slice of heaven tomarrow night 
called Friends & Family.  Ethan or Mike or anyone on the F&F crew: if 
you need any help breaking down after the party, I will be more than 
happy to help.  I know it must be the shits breaking down when you just 
want to take a shower and sleep some. More people who help out, the 
faster you can get it out of the way.  Anyone who hasn't met me yet I'll 
be wearing a sleaveless white shirt with green trim and an old pair of 
jeans with patches on the butt. (my fave pair that I couldn't throw out!)

Cya Saturday!
love,
Amy

Most routine corporate drug tests do not test for MDMA, but it would show up 
as a possible amphetamine (a group that IS commonly tested for).  As for time, 
72 hours should be fine.  The more water you drink the better (this 
dilutes the sample).  I have been told by pharmacologist friend of mine 
that doing one dose of e on a saturday, could be fine for a monday drug 
test (when most companies test) as long as you drink lots of water and 
don't give the first sample of the day (i.e. urinate in the morning 
before going in for the test).  Of course the longer the better... look 
for Friday night parties.   I'm sure other people will have more info to 
add to this, but I hope it helps.

Andrew Lawson (have to add that last name now, since I have been seeing a 
few more Andrews popping up on the list)   ; )

Sacramento and haven't been able to get mine for one reason or another. 
I heard they sold out at Ameba.  I need 4 or more (or less even).  
Please help me, I am about to start school and need to celebrate the

Amy,

I completely understand your frustrations!  Sometimes it seems so difficult to 
believe that we have such an amazing world and that we are such incredible 
people, and we are bound by regulations and restrictions not of our own 
choice, nor for our benefit, but to "protect ourselves"--from who, ourselves. 
 This makes absolutely no sense to me.  I am doing perfectly fine and so is my 
wonderful rave community, if everyone else would just adopt a similar attitute 
and allow people to truly express and be themselves.  The frustration that 
mounts in response to this can often be so dampening, and once again you (I, 
whomever) feel beat and trodden by a system that everyone dislikes and knows 
is so ineffective that the very thought of continuing it is ridiculous.

Sorry for the immense ramblings.  I always enjoy you posts and it hurts me 
inside to know that anyone else feels this way, and unfortunately I know that 
many feel this way.  That is precisely, imo, why we are doing what we are 
doing as a community.  We are creating our own society, we are are own family 
and that is such an amazing, incredible and beautiful thing, that it  not only 
keeps me going, but it gives me such immense energy and life.  Unfortunately 
we live in nothing close to a perfect world, but it has so many wonders to 
cherish, our family comes first.  I truly believe that this family cannot be 
torn apart under and circumstances because of its acceptance and promotion of 
diversity in all forms.  So long as we continue to strive for what we believe 
so deeply in, our right to gather and celebrate life, than no one can ever 
take that away.

I wish I was going to be attending F&F, but alas I have ravers illness and I 
need to stay home long enought to get well.  Have the most fabulous time!!! ;) 
 To everyone on the list, and everyone you know and so on, love and smiles, 
this is going to be a beautiful weekend, enjoy each other.

LoveAnais

well. i'm in the midwest now again.
i'm having a lot of fun.
but i miss the bay area a lot.

everything here is corporate rave.
no new moon collective.
no frequency 8's
no sunsets.
yuck.

$15 dollar minimum.

you guys kick ass. except you 21+ promoters. you suck. take a risk every
once in a while. some people just don't know where its at.

anyway, my point is, i'd like to stay on the sfraves digest, but dumb me
can't find out if there is one. is there?
i mean this is the mw-raves list:
  mw-raves             The Mid-West Raves Mailing List
  mw-raves-calendar    The Mid-West Raves Calendar List
  mw-raves-digest      The Mid-West Raves Digest Mailing List
but this is the sflist:
  sfraves              The San Francisco Rave Mailing List
  sfraves-calendar     The San Francisco Rave Calendar Mailing List
wierd, huh?

cya in the bay area real soon, i hope

   Dearest Amy, 
      I've seen a couple of your posts before I had gotten my own account 
here on S.F. raves and can say that I believe in ALOTTTT of what you say. 
and how you feel:). When I am at A rave especially the F&F's or Sunsets; 
I feel as though I'm on cloud 9, the atmosphere is so clear and our 
little man- made community is so gorgeous and then the day after comes 
and feel a little bit of that  AGGGRRH letdown of support washes in. Very 
interesting:):):):). I have no choice but to enjoy it while I've got it. 
And then continue on with my new and perhaps not so exciting day. None 
theless all or S.F. Ravers are a completely uniqe bunch because you care!!!
Don't ever loose this quality1 This is what will keep our little ole' 
community going. I look very forwarad to seeing tose I have already meet 
and meeting many of you that I haven't at tomorrow's F&F. Amy, I 'll BE 
the 1 with short dark hair; most likely in all black, or wearing a gold 
tank top. LOok for me and be there with a big ole' hug for ya! Take care 
all. See ya soon.
                      Reagan

Anarchist Disco has been moved to 16th/Potrero. I forgot the name of the

Hey guys,
       (Just one last post before I log off of sfraves for another two
semesters.)

           This is a great post about how to stop E Neurotoxicity!

        After reading that thread about the reorginazation of neurons,
I thought I'd put in a little bit of my knowledge and opinion. I've 
basically spent most of my free time this summer reading the current 
journal articles on MDMA, and I'm a junior chemist at Harvey Mudd College 
(which btw, has a pretty cool scene here...), so I THINK I am somewhat 
reliable of a source (though I am always learning, just like everyone else)

        If you don't like boring scientific brain stuff, just skip to the
        end for answers on how to stop E neurotoxicity. There are actually a
        lot of really effective things you can do, and I've tried to list
        all that I know of (I'm sure there are more things...).

Q: What does E do?
A: It causes the massive release of serotonin from serotonergic presynaptic
neurons. Basically the neurons terminals that contain serotonin as their
neurotransmitter are caused to fire (ie. release serotonin into the synapse)
by MDMA. 
A very simplistic view of serotonin might describe it as the "happy
neurotransmitter," since low levels of it are associated with
depression. After this massive release your body probably cannot recollect
all of your serotonin (some gets degraded, some just floats away). Hence
your serotonin levels drop.

Q: What else does E do?
A: It inhibits TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase. This enzyme is the first of two
steps which transforms tryptophan (an amino acid) to serotonin. Hence new
production of serotonin is halted (or at least slowed down signifigantly).

Q: Is this what causes depression the next day?
A: Most likely, yes. After a night in which a chemical has caused the
massive release of serotonin into the synapse, and then significantly slowed
the new production of serotonin, your serotonin levels are likely to be
markedly lowered.

Q: Is MDMA neurotoxic?
A: Yes. It selectively degeneretes (note - it does NOT kill, as far as we
know) serotonin neuron terminals. In experiments on monkeys, after stopping
MDMA use for approx a year, the neuron terminals were found to
regenerate. 

MY THEORY - It's at this point that the serotonergic neuron terminals grow 
back to the wrong place, hence causing the abnormal connections we were just
reading about in the "Rave Drug May Damage Brain...." or whatever. But this
is just my theory on things...

Q: What causes the neurotoxicity?
A: This one's a doozy.....  After the serotonin has binded to the receptor
on the other side of the synpapse (the post-synaptic neuron), there is a 
reuptake pump (on the pre-synaptic neuron) that sucks back up the serotonin 
from the synapse. Every now and then the pump will suck up a dopamine
molecule (another neurotransmitter that isn't really related to the
"feel-good" effects of E). That dopamine doesn't have any business being
inside of a serotonin neuron, so MAO-B degrades the dopamine, IN THE 
PROCESS OF WHICH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IS FORMED!!!!! 
        
Q: So what's the big deal about Hydrogen Peroxide?
A: Nothing normally. H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) is toxic to animals because it
splits in two to form two hydroxyl free radicals, which are very reactive
and very damaging. Normally your body can handle these varmits just fine,
just by reducing them with anti-oxidants (like Vitamin C, E, or
glutathione).

Q: H2O2 and MDMA: so what's the connection?
A: MAO-B also degrades serotonin, but not as well as it degrades dopamine,
but there is usually so much serotonin as compared to dopamine inside of a
serotonergic neuron, that it has a hard time getting around to the dopamine,
so very little H2O2 is formed. HOWEVER, during an E trip, a whole heck of a
lot of your serotonin is outside in the synapse, not in the neuron, so the
MAO-B has a much easier time getting to the dopamine, and hence forming more
H2O2. (Also I think E causes a larger production of dopamine elsewhere in
your brain, and eventually some of that dopamine will get inside of the 
serotonergic neurons). Now there is a much higher level of H2O2 INSIDE of
your serotonergic neurons than your body can effectively get rid of, and
NOW we start seeing brain damage: specifically, selective serotonergic
neuron degeneration.

MY THEORY - The neurons form abnormal connections after being damaged, maybe
because they just hook up with the closet thing nearby. If you could stop
this degeneration damage somehow, there would be no way for the neurons to
grow back abnormally since they are already fine.

                        END OF BORING SCIENTIFIC STUFF

Q: So how do I stop this shitty neurotoxicity?
A: Many Many different ways. Below is a list of the ways I am currently
familiar with, though I'm sure there are probably more...


1) Stop the reuptake of serotonin (and hence the accidental reuptake of
   dopamine also which is the real cause of the neurotoxicity) by taking an
   SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). So take:

                                Prozac 

   Take it 3-6 hours afters taking your E dose, and this will significantly
   reduce neurotoxicity. THIS IS A WELL DOCUMETNED EFFECT! This is not one
   of my other theories. If you do this your brain will love you for it. Any
   other SSRI will also have the same effect (Xanax? Zoloft? Are those SSRIs?) 
   This might even make your trip a bit better, because it will keep the
   serotonin in the synapse longer....

2) Stop the breakdown of dopamine by MAO-B. This is the ultimate step which
   produces the toxic hydrogen peroxide. The documented case I read about
   used:

                               L-deprenyl

   which I believe is a commonly prescribed anti-depressant, though when I
   think about it, maybe it's not since.... Well does anyone have any info
   on this or where to get it? It would be greatly appreciated.... Anyways,
   take it the same time that you take your E, cause that's what worked for
   the rats.... Other MAO-B inhibitors will also work (ask your doctor about
   this....)

3) Increase relative serotonin levels. If you eats lots of tryptophan at the
   same time you eat your E, this will overcome the inhibitory effects that
   E has on TPH (tryptophan hydroxylase), which will increase relative
   serotonin levels, which will decrease the degradative actions of MAO-B on
   dopamine (since all of the extra serotonin will be getting in the way),
   which will produce less H2O2, and hence less damage. So....

        Take something like 2-3 capsules of tryptophan with 1 capsule E.

   Unfortunatley, the FDA has taken tryptophan (an amino acid!!!) off of the
   market for what I believe is essentially political reasons (they found it
   later to be a contaminent in a Japanese pharmaceuticals tryptophan
   product that was causing the sickness, not the tryptophan itself.....)
   You can still probably get it in Mexico though and you probably can even
   mail order it for European Pharmaceutical companies. It's not like it's a
   Schedule I drug like E is....
   This might also make your trip a bit better because you will now be
   continually producing serotonin. IT WILL ALMOST DEFINITELY HELP WITH
   POST-E DEPRESSION....

4) Stop the free-radical damage. This is the easiest to do, since
   anti-oxidants are extremely easy to come by. Some suggestions:

        Glutathione - This a naturally occuring tripeptide in your body. I
                      THINK it is one of the chemicals your brain uses in
                      the process that gets rid of free radicals. And it
                      itself is an anti-oxidant....

        Vitamin C
        Vitamin E
        Melatonin (fairly good report in recent Newsweek on this)
        Many others....

   It would probably be a good idea to take some with your E, and then maybe
   about 3-6 hours later....



                 Summary

Prozac & other SSRIs                    3-6 hours after taking E
L-deprenyl and other MAO-B inhibitors   When you take your E
Tryptophan ***                          When you take your E
Anti-oxidants
    Vitamin C
    Vitamin E
    glutathione ***
    melatonin

*** - highly recommend

        Well, that's it.... Hope I haven't gone too overboard. I would like 
to give one last thanks to the SF scene for giving me what I believe was the
greatest summer I've ever had. Thanks much to all you out there who have
make it so special....

                                          lots and lots and lots o luv,

                                                Jason Sydes

This is used chiefly for Parkinson's.  Folks, don't try this with the type
of  nonselective MAOIs sometimes prescribed for depression, it could prove
deadly.  I'm not even sure about MAO-B selective drugs such as Eldepryl.

Any word on Black Diamond at 76 Minna (Oddball Lounge)? I was by the same 
Thursday that the cops were at Anarchist Disco, and when I left Black Diamond
at 3am, there was one SFPD car at 111 Minna, but 3 at the Oddball Lounge. 
Hope it's still on as it was good clean fun ...

World population is at about 6 BILLION people.  Let's decrease that by
about a factor of ten and we won't lack for good party sites, among
other things.  Wonder why everything costs so much?  Too many people wanting
to live in the same space, and we all have to outbid each other for housing.
The low bidders are homeless, the high bidders on the Hill or somewhere 
equally posh.

You aren't alone.  It's hard to get together and change, though, because
everything is set up to maintain the status quo.  Of _course_ businessmen,
brokers, senators, the FBI and the rest of the people we like to think of
as "The Man" want to maintain the current rat race, because it has carried
them to where they are and they want to stay at the top.

The technical challenges of building a mostly self-sufficient community in
the city or the country have been well-researched, implemented, and 
demonstrated to anyone's satisfaction that cares to do some research into
energy-efficient construction, sustainable agriculture, wind/water/solar
power, recycling, and reuse.  The trouble is finding a critical mass of
people willing to put in the time, effort, and cash money to start something
up, and the resolve to stick with it through the growing pains.

There is a group of people called Dancing Rabbit that meet about once a month
in and around Palo Alto who are trying to get together something like this.
I believe they've been meeting for over a year, and there are a lot of neat
people involved, but not enough people have been willing to pony up to the
$80K or so it would take to get enough land and material to get started in
even Bumfuck, Nowhere, doing everything themselves.  There's a lot of energy
and a lot of good skills, but all this rat race does get us the luxury of 
being able to retreat into our OWN apartment by OURSELVES, melt into the
anonymity of the city, and just skate by at our job or on our savings until
the problem goes away.  We can always do this, and committing to a community
means taking away part of that safety net -- everyone could lose everything.

The problem is within ourselves.  We have to make a scary commitment that
our rat race doesn't leave much time to explore, and all our training
prepares us for the opposite (school, work, TV, radio, billboards, jobs, etc.)

There is a book called the Directory of Intentional Communities that 
has listings for just about every commune/co-op/whatever in the country.

Try alt.co-ops, which should have pointers to these info-bits, and more.

Yes, I want to find, found, or otherwise live in a community which shares
my values instead of Konsumer Kulture and the Wiffle Life (tm).  I know
your pain, and feel it often myself.  Over the years I've been in places
and known people that have or can make it happen.  I am working towards
this myself, by gathering information, forming contacts, and not getting
involved in massive consumer debt (car, house) so I can cut myself loose
from whatever my current job is when the time comes.

What it really comes down to is this: can you stand to find my hair in
your soap cake when you take a shower?  On such little things does 
co-op life stand or fall.

I will see you at F&F!  Not sure what I'll be wearing.  If people don't like
nametags, how about a big sheet of paper ("I'm Here, Say Hi") which we can 
write our name, online handle, and short description?  I'll try to remember
some big sheets of white paper and a few pens...

...and if you're going to be there, come say hi. I'm tall (6'6") and have
red/brown hair w/ a pony tail. I will probably be wearing a big white Cat
in the Hat t-shirt. But look closely, the 'cat' in this hat isn't quite the
one that you are expecting. :)

One last thing: Like others on the list, I also think that SFRavers need an
ID system so we'll recognize each other on the street, at parties, etc. My
suggestion is to make SF Rave "backstage pass" type laminates that we can
have w/ our name and email address on them. They are pretty cool and will
last a long time. If people are interested, I will try to get this going
ASAP. I would like to make them for about a buck each (including return
postage) but I have to check on the costs for the actual plastic laminate
sleeves to determine exact costs...

Reminds me: I recently saw B.F.Skinner, (in)famous founder of 
behaviorism, interviewed on a public TV show. His final statement was 
something along the lines of: after having studied human behavior for 
many years, and having endlessly pondered over the ways in which 
behavior/personality could be changed, he now doubted 
whether change is at all possible. While this statement in and of itself 
may be relatively innocuous, coming from such an important figure in the 
field of psychology, it was, nontheless, quite shocking. After a bit of 
thinking, the conclusion that stayed with me was that behavioral change 
may presuppose a deep change/evolution that Skinner may not have been 
able to conceive of. I feel that the altered states of trance that we all long 
for and achieve in various ways through dance/rave/chemicals/whatever, is, 
in effect, the first step of a re-imaging of ourselves into individuals 
and communities able to initiate change.

But then again, it's 6am, I just got home from several hours of dancing, 
and I may just have my head up my ass...

Nope, It's thru.
The cops have leaned on both spots because people were dancing
all night and having some clean fun. As far as I know
the folks at 111 were really good citizens, they kept the door closed (and
thus the sound levels down) and stopped selling beer at 2). When I was
there last week a copper can in scowling looking around (I guess expecting
to see wanton drugs and sex) and found people dancing (doc was throwing down
some serious grooves) he walked around for about two minutes and left.
The excuse is "you need a permit for this kind of gathering" which is another
way of saying that you need to pay us if you want to have a party. (And
I'm not talking about the price of the permit here either)

There is an even better way:  DONT TAKE E!

Fact is the effects can be stopped in its tracks by not taking the stuff.
Period.  The alternative, taking E, and taking hosts of other synthetic
chemicals to counteract the effects, is tantamount to buying more insurance
every time you get into a car wreck, due to poor driing skills.  The
soultion is to improve ones driving, not buying more insurance.  An even
better proposal in such circunstances is to cease driving until one learns
to drive.

People who tend to do E do maore than the RDA of the stuff.  And since no
real concrete studies have been done on an ongoing basis, it is difficult
for anyone, even our learned frined Jason here, to come up with real
solutions to the problem, much less recommended dosages for safe tripping.
The hypothesis Jason presents is based upon pure E no doubt.  I do wonder
how pure the shit is on the street these day s is, and if there is some
other componenet in the street E that may have other neurotoxic effects.
We just don't know.  So, IMO, unless you make the stuff yourself, and are
sure of YOUR skills as a chemist, stay away.  Otherwise you really don't
know what the hell you're getting.

This much is true, E has changed many times on the street.  When I've taken
it, it used to make me dance really hard, other times it made me piss
blood, other times, it made me feel lethargic, other times, it made me
sleepy, other times I was a happy slappy pappy.  I had been taking all of
the preventative measures outline by Eisner, and Janiger, but still some
nasty side effects.  Fact is, unless I was getting the shit from Sandoz
labs (which never happened btw), I am not really sure WHO the chemist was.
I have taken red/pink E, yellowish E, white E, etc.  And to this date, the
stuff on the street still varies in quality.  Crackin' on ain't what it
used to be, so I stay away from the E.

I am NOT one of those JUST SAY NO kinda people.  I beleive in living to the
excesses, at times.  But even, that must be done in moderation, even for
me.

I just don't like people giving the green light to stuff that is obviously
harmful to them.  You don't see me saying, "Have a beer, your life will be
all the better for it!", because I know both sides of the drug.  Nor do I
go around telling people to smoke weed.  That has its problems associated
with it as well.
I just say everything is ok, for the most part, in MODERATION.  As Markie
told me, "Even moderation in moderation!" (you tricky devil !) ).

Just beware of what you buy, and take care of yourself. Catch a groove to
make you move, and do what you do how you do in moderation. (huh?) :)

Peace out & E 'feelings' to the world,
John

I thought the information Jason gave was cogent and clear.  His hypothesis
well thought out.  I say give this man a govt. grant or a grant of some
sort so that he may do some SERIOUS and REAL studies of the drug.  It could
only benefit us all.  Thanks for the info Jason, I've filed it for future
reference!

no. you don't.  ask any reborn catholic (like me (don't shoot me for that.
i've had too many "open minded people" get mad at me for being actholic))
and they will tell you that to truly form a new society (the kingdom of god,
in christian parlance), you must give up all the aspects of this society and
follow your inner music (give up all your posessions and take up your
cross).  i know it's fashionable to bash big religions, but they say the
same thing as our raver-mindset says, when it gets down to it.

peace and love,
matt

I think this may be true for some ravers.  But I know for me, raving 
is energizing and relaxing, but not colossally consciousness- 
transforming.  I trance out while I'm raving, but afterwards I'm 
still me.

Well, sort of.  The original prophets (Christ among them) said things 
like this.  But the organized churches took those ideas and turned 
them into the basis of some mighty large and inhuman Ponzi schemes, 
killing and repressing a whole lot of people in the process.

You're dead right though:  the kingdom of God, or enlightenment, or 
whatever you want to call that clear cosmic clue, is within us.  
Personal transformation comes first.

Some even bigger reasons to hope:  There are many poor 
societies right now where the birthrate is dropping, due to women 
taking their own family planning into their own hands.  There are 
lots of people who recognize that capitalism is a machine which 
converts insecurity into dollars.  There are even some jobs with good 
co-workers and decent wages.  And even with all the greed and fear we 
see around us, there are lots of ways in which our society is more 
free now than it was, say, a hundred or five hundred years ago.

This story ain't over yet.

Hey everyone,

With all this stuff regarding the police, I'm encouraging everyone to 
begin using a new "service" that a few of us are putting together.

We're still working out the details of what we want to accomplish, but 
generally, we want to start documenting acts of police misconduct which 
might occur at our events.

Should there be any situations where the police appear to be stepping 
outside their authority, we encourage you to report it.

Voice: 415.323.5800  ext. 805
Email: police_misconduct@hyperreal.com 

More info to follow...

See you all at F&F!

Jonas

       Exactly, I've been a wondering myself about some sort of S.F> 
ravers badge that can be conjured up. I have been told that one does 
exist out there. If so, can someone please post some info. on how to get 
a hold of them or better yet how they can be distributed throughout.

FSOL film: missed it.     :(
Traci Lords: missed her.  :)
Keoki: nice mohawk, but didn't care too much for his tunes.  :|
Freaky Chakra vs. Single Cell Orchestra:  these guys TEAR IT UP!  And, 
they have a great time doing it.  In the year that I was away, it seems 
these two have gone from twiddling knobs in their Marin county 
bedrooms to knocking on the door of world-wide stardom.  They've got 
their act down, and they're ready to fly!  
Moby: Wow, in addition to providing a full-on techno-rave-rock'n'roll 
show, this guy even gives helpful moral advice in-between tracks- how 
could you ask for more? (example: After throwing his drum pads on the floor, 
Moby proclaims "See, it's not alive, so I can do whatever I want with it.  
Now, if it had felt anything- pain, suffering, then it would have been 
wrong, but it's just a hunk of plastic, so it doesn't matter."  Hey, who's to 
say plastic doesn't have feelings too? :)  He certainly had guts, though, 
to take a stab at SF and its entourage of big-name dj's, and to show us 
his ding-a-ling while posing as Jesus on top of his synth.  At least he 
wasn't boring...
Sven Vath:  a great set of brain-melting hard-trance from the master.  I 
hear he usually like to spin all night (12 hrs+), which could get a bit 
tedious sans large quantities of psychoactive chemicals to keep it 
interesting (one can only take so many fade-in snare drum build-ups in 
one evening and not start to feel insulted).  One hour was long 
enough to get a good feel for his style.  A good closing for an 
interesting night...

I was at work yesterday evening, sitting at the parking lot behind the 
UCB Greek Theater for the Lyle Lovett concert.  I was VERY bored.

So, I started making techno music by banging on anything around me that 
would resonate.  I discovered that the metal tube which comes off the sun 
umbrella I was using, when tapped just right, with varying pressure, 
while keeping my ear very close to the opening, recreated exactly the 
clangy noise used by Plastikman in "Krakpot", without use of 
electricity.  And I wasn't even on drugs.  Really, I wasn't.  

Techno music is an existing component of nature, and always has been.

ENIT at the Warfield: Missed Connections and a Nekkid DJ

 After not meeting anyone at Tu Lan , I did the usual queuing-up for the
Warfield , with the usual Market Street panhandlers and ticket scalpers
working the line. Finally let in at about 9:15PM. During the night , I tried
to find someone with an orange "Wired" cap on ( Purple Tiger ) or a burgundy
Alien shirt, black pants , and a goatee ( Sean "House Music All Night Long" ).
Missed those connections - anyway , I was the guy wearing the dark grey
pants and the tie dyed shirt ; I had a rainbow stripped vest on earlier in
the evening , but took it off after it got warm.

 The setup was different than the Orb show - nobody selling trinkets upstairs,
and a turntable setup at one corner. The main stage was full of musical 
equipment, with about three drum kits in view.

 ENIT was supposed to be something more "eclectic" than just house/techno 
music. In this case , the "eclectic" was provided by DJ Spooky's spacy dub 
mixes , and homocore ( I believe that's the new term for punk/thrash music
by gay/lesbian musicians ) by the first live music band of the night , 
Extra Fancy.

 Extra Fancy is a drums/bass/guitar/singer band from LA . The singer is a
good humored fellow , looks kinda like a young Bruce Willis ("Pulp Fiction"
version ) from the neck up, and Henry Rollins from the neck down ( only two
tattoos , tho' - as far as I could see...). Among other things , they did 
a version of a Peter Tosh song that they called "Sinner Man". For some 
songs , the singer would bash a 55 gallon drum with two pipes, showing much 
vigor and precision. They had folks come up on stage and dance ... I remember 
two gals in particular, who ended up in front of the drummer and behind the 
singer . They kind of reminded me of young versions of Patsy and Edina 
( "Absolutely Fabulous" reference there ...). The pair ended up generally 
goofing up behind the singer with not even a halfway decent pretense of 
being into supporting the dramatic delivery of each song.

 After Extra Fancy - DJ Traci Lords!  Strange start to the set - the 
audience staring at Lords as she ... mixed records! Wow! That got tired 
quick , and once we realized she wasn't going to do a Market Street strip 
club gynecological show-and-tell or anything even remotely like a 
performance , we got down to dancing.  DJ Traci Lords seems to have good 
taste in dance music - I had a good time. ( For those fans of Ms. Traci 
Lords' epidermis - the most we saw of it was when she removed her big red 
blouse . Black bikini top - nothing less/more than what you'd see in the 
Macy's ads in the paper ). [ By the way - one of the tunes she played had 
a vocal that went "It's all ... future" - who does that ? ]

 I wandered away to check out the 2nd floor DJ - which at 10:40PM was DJ
Spooky. A solemn black guy with neck length dreads of black and honey brown.
He was spinning some real spacy dub stuff - Depth Charge "Legend of the Golden
Snake" and other 12" with Virgin Records labels on them.

 By the time I got back to the main room , some other DJ had replaced Traci
Lords - a tall blond (?) guy . Anybody know who he was? He had good taste too.

 At 12:08 the Freaky Chakra/Single Cell Orchestra jam session got started.
They do make beautiful music together  - if they ever get a CD out , I'd buy
it. At times during the set , a gal would come out and sing vowels into the
mike in an operatic/chanting way. I think the musicians had the option of
sampling and treating her vocals if they wanted it in the mix.

1:20 AM - Moby. I've never seen him on stage , so I wasn't prepared for how 
much this guy RUNS around ! Jumps up on his keyboard rack occasionally .
Does a lot of dramatic posing too , although always in the mood of the music.
Speaking of music ; it was a mixture of styles  : fast techno/house , 
punk/thrash , Jimi Hendrix' "Purple Haze" , Lynard Skynard's "Sweet Home 
Alabama" , industrial.  ( anybody else who was there care to add to the 
list? ). Helping Moby out were Dean and Scott on two seperate percission kits , and ex-Buzzcock Allie McMarty on bass. 

 I had a quite surprising experience during one of his techno tunes - it was as 
if I was a servo-controlled puppet being twiched around by the music. That 
happened for about 30 seconds - very interesting!

 Between the songs , we got little bits of the Moby worldview - ( ... if eating 
dogs and cats is reprehensible , why is eating cattle OK? Anal sex is fun , 
actually.  A lot of DJs don't get out and dance enough . Too many music 
snobs criticizing {his} musical eclecticism, and the already mentioned
bit from Seth's post about how drum pads have no sensation of pain ).). 

 The post-encore finale tune was "Thousand" , which Moby semi-seriously claims 
to be the fastest tune ever made. It's a crunching industrial thing 
that starts at about120 bpm and speeds up - I may very well go up to 
1000 bpm!  It sounds suspiciously like a train engine sample that starts 
slowed down and then is sped up while keeping the frequency components 
unchanged. This tune required no knob twiddling by Moby , so I guess it was 
a playback or done by persons on the sidelines. At the beginning of 
"Thousand" , Moby was just in his briefs. By the end of the second 
"chorus" , he was nude , standing on his sturdy keyboard , arms outstreched 
a la Jesus-crucifed . 

 He said his final "Goodnight" , and I left the Warfield. I guess I missed
Sven Vath , but I had a good time anyway!

Last Friday at 1559 Howard Street, then last Saturday at my house, and last 
night at 2523 Mission I went to three of the best house parties I have 
been to in years.  Remember house parties?  In peoples homes of store 
front space where the music is of all different types and so are the 
people; and there te kitchen scene, or the deck scene, or the roof scene, 
or the bedroom scene, or the dance floor scene; many options await the 
punter.  House parties and outdoor parties are whare it is at and night 
clubs be dammeD.
TRISTAN.
PS Anyone sad at not being at these last two parties which were EXELLENT 
should contact me because these parties are not put on the net, just 
flyerd.  HAVE NOT HAD SO MUCH FUN GOING OUT IN AGES!  THANK-YOU!

I laughed, I cried.. It was a techno rock concert at the Warfield. I should
have gone to Outa Sight at Big Heart City... Moby got naked and said that in
general people from SF are stuck up and don't know good music when we hear
it and something about cats and anal sex. Tracy Lords DJ??? Her first record
skipped but I guess she was allright. Maybe she should have goten naked
instead of Moby. I tried to get the video guy to show one of her early
pornos but he wouldn't go for it. Keoki was trippin on something. He had a
bandage on his nose that he said he got from walking through a plate glass
window. I didn't think he was all that great. Freaky Chakra vs. Single Cell
was really good with Daum throwing off his wig into the audience. Sven Vath
was THE SHIT! And waiting through all the previous bullshit was well worth
the wait. He told me that he was coming back to SF in the spring and that he
wants to play at a real party.
The true highlight of the evening was my roommate John spinning records
upstairs and then Spooky showed up and twisted the beat around and sideways
and played some really bizzare tip hop and punk rock or whatever you call
it. Anyways I'm really glad I didn't have to shell out and $$ for any of
this and I guess I had a good time.

Sorry about the FS post on this group, but hey, you're the ones 
interested in this item.

Denon 2000F DJ CD player with remote. CD player and remote are both 
2-rack spaces. It's the standard in all clubs. + - 8% pitch control.
Works great. New is $1000-ish. Will sell for $600. It's no 1200, but 
you've got CD's it's the next best thing.

One mans truth is anothers lie.  I would suggest spending addtl. time in SF

mafioso, by money grubbing assholes here in the US.  You should start by
LEARNING how things are run here first.  Please do not take your
experiences in England and apply them here.  They are not analagous scenes
at all.

As for the tone of your message...whatever.  It's obvious you want to start
a flame war.  I wish to avoid one, although the temptation...

In your message, you DID say you'll E your way to heaven.  Which suggest
dosages as part of your lifestyle, which suggest E headom.  Maybe it was an
incorrect assumption, and a leap of logic, but you're an E-head by MY
definition anyway.  And as cited above, in your own words, the road to
heaven for you might be a road paved in E....sad.

And quite a pompous ass you are as well.  You make the argument for
Proposition 187 hard to beat.

I'm outtahere,

P.S.  Tristan, you really seem like a nice kinda guy, but the way you
approach things leave alot to be desired.  Where I'm originally from, if
you were to state things like the way you do, face to face, you'd get your
ass kicked.  And all the E in the word wouldn't save you from that.  You
should try to be less vitriolic, and more considerate of people's feelings.
You remind me of my pompous ass days on the list.  No a very good memory
or time for many on the list, or myself.

I had all the ideas, and knew all the right people, and had all the answers
for these clueless newbies on SFRaves.  The one thing I didn't have was
respect for where they came from, and THEIR experiences, which were no less
valid than mine.  And now I look around and see the folx on the list being
very positive, changing things in their own way.  Networking and doing the
shit OTHERS are now just talking about.  Look at the number of people on
the list who have been going out AND doing parties now for 2 years or more.
You gotta respect that.  You also should respect the fact that people have
valid and important experiences here.  Instead of discounting their truth
for yours, maybe you might want to spend some time understanding what
things are about, before diving into how "right" you are, and how clueless
everyone else is.  Be lucky you're in SF, it's one of the last free places
on earht with the potential for change!  Cuz' I tell you this much, you
couldn't get away with half the shit you talk in NY, or Miami, FL. without
either a fist or a bullet in your face.  Just something to think about as
you step heavily on OTHER peoples ideas and feelings.  You wouldn't last a
minute in other areas of THIS country.

I'm done, now.  Bye & good luck on becoming part of a greater good.  It's a
long road, but I beleive even you can get there. I did.

Peace.

PSS:  Shouts out to my man Bryce who let me spin @ his Internet Cafe gig!
I had a great time, as did my friend Mike.  Liked hanging with you and your
buds, and had a good time spinning!  Good luck to you, F&F tonite.  Crush
some skulls!

This "If you don't have a ticket don't show up", bullshit is starting to
sound a little redundant to me. The grateful dead have been saying this for
the last 20 years. This separatist, elitest bullshit killed that scene. I
will give the same advise to Ethan et all, that I also have given to the GD.
If you're going to have a public party obtain a space big enough for all
people willing to attend! We are all on this trip together and we shouldn't
exclude the rest of the world to save intamacy. Intamacy is closing the doors
to others.We need more open doors in this world. If a private party is what
you want, then send out invitations to friends and family. If a small public
party is what you want, then don't advertise for months ahead of time and
don't have the party on Saturday night? These are my attitudes and may be
taken with however many grains of salt you wish. I personally will not be
attending F&F, I only attend partys in which I and all others are cordially
appreciated. Have a great night, I will see ya 'round! PEACE!!!!  =  )

        Xanax is not an SSRI its a benzodiazapine....that is to say its

sites...thus does not effect E's level of neurotoxicity.  Though it may 
lessen the anxiaty that accompanies the crash it does so through 
another type of neurotransmitter GABA.

We got there pretty early and drove through what was really more of a friendly
checkpoint than a map point.  The party was already going off in a major way
when we arrived at around 11:30.  PLenty of room in the main warehouse dance
area.  The lighting was really nice:  a spinning oil projection covered the
entire wall behind the DJ.  Above the DJ was some kind of intellibeam thing.
And another wall hosted some really cool video projections.  Later on, the
oil and intellibeam were replaced by a nice lazer and strobes.  I really like
it when the visuals are varied over the course of a party.  Kudos again to
Michael Clay and other I'm sure.

The sound was pretty good for a warehouse setup.  Not super-crisp, but full
and bassey with no distortion, plenty of volume and no metal rattling or
weird reverberation.  We had no trouble trancing out with it.  The 2 outdoor
ambient areas also had really good sound and some nice visual projections.

The vibe was great; lot's of people dancing hard, hands-in-the-air, smiles,
shouts, hugs.  At one point I remember thinking  that this is really what the
scene is all about; people putting it together for the love of it, people 
coming and participating for the love of it. 

I couple of very minor gripes: I found the big balloon balls on the dance
floor pretty annoying.  Although they added to the fun, it was pretty
distracting to have to avoid getting hit by them or being repeatly shoved
by everyone lunging to get their whacks in.  Happily, the balls eventually
met their fate at the end of an incense stick or some sharp object.

The music was relentlessly hard and fast by SF standards.  We really got
into it and I worked up a pretty good sweat,  but 2 sets of that is usually
more than enough for me, especially indoors with the temperature rising.
Of course, we always had the option of chilling, but we really mostly like to
dance at parties.  I think if things had started off a little slower and 
worked its way up in intensity we might have stayed longer.

But we really did have a great time; it was nice seeing everyone.  Thanks
to the F&F crew and all the rest!  Also, a special thanx to whoever
made the site possible, Greg&Cindy I think?

Oh, and about that issue of elitism someone brought up concerning the need
to buy advanced tickets.  The hard reality is that whether it's F&F, Sunset,
FMR, a cool house party; a multitude of methods have been used to
exclude the hordes from overrunning what the organizers can handle.  When
you think about it, advanced tickets is less elitist than word-of-mouth,
selective flyering, or secret phone numbers.  Anyone who really wanted
to had a few days to go and get one a ticket, or could have asked a friend to
get one.  But obviously, the real solution is for more people to throw great
cheap parties.  And this seems to be happening. :-)

Tristan from S.P.A.Z. here,
Countery to seemingly local belief (judging by two recent surprise phone 
calls, one from CC sound system - I am houned to say -) I 
am not the authority on who can bring a system out to the dessrt or not. 
As a representative of trhe only sound system to have been at burning man 
for the last three years this is, for us, a dream come true.  We say the 
more the merrier.  Anyone wanting help getting stuff out their orsetting 
up when your their I and my possie will be out their from Thursday and 
anything goes although try to check the idea by the organizers of having 
theme camps.  Oh dear, better try to think of a theme; an thinks...
Looking forward to seeing you all at the party of the year and all stay 
in touch by posting,
TRISTAN.

What The Grateful Dead Can Teach F&F

( I was feeling pretty good after F&F , then I logged on and read the
 following post from Begroovy@aol.com. I still think F&F was good , but
 I must exercise my crabby gland and give my reaction to Begroovy's
 post in the recent "The Rumor Mill" thread.  Also - I'm not a card-carrying
 member of Friends & Family , but I do know alot of the folks in it ,
 so I can't claim 100% objectivity. I've also been a Deadhead in my
 younger "Skull and Roses" days ... )

 Took 20 years to die , huh? In my opinion , what "killed" that scene
was the vast increase in the number of "fans" who made touring for the
Grateful Dead a nightmare as far as logistics , siting , and legal
responsibility was concerned.

 See his disclaimer about "taking his advice with a grain of salt" later
in this post before replying in a knee-jerk reaction to such 
egomanical condescension . Maybe I'm overreacting , but , since I don't know
anything about Begroovy , I don't know if (s)he has had any responsiblity
for or experience in the creation and performance of rock concerts or raves 
for large groups of people. I assume very little , thus my reaction.

  "Saving intimacy" had nothing to do with limiting tickets - it was done to
ensure that the proper balance of site and crowd density was kept within
the range where it would be an enjoyable experience for all concerned , and 
also to avoid the attentions of the police -  an overflow crowd attacts cops.
Friends and Family has had one very bad experience with overcrowding
due to counterfeit tickets in the early part of this year. When the cops 
shut that party down , both the F&F and the ravers there lost out.

 This party being discussed was not formally advertised until Aug. 7th.  Your
sense of time needs tweaking.  As far as having it on Saturday night - all the
better  , as folks who miss out on buying tickets can go to other events 
happening on the same night. Friends and Family went out of their way to get 
a stack of Tribal Funk flyers to give to folks who insisted on showing up 
without tickets. 

 According to the sfraves calender , there were three other events to go to :
Tribal Funk , Divine , and Eternia.  Plus four weekly events listed for 
Saturday evenings. Unlike the Grateful Dead , who became the "sole source" 
of yearly traveling parking lot mini-Woodstocks , Friends and Family's party 
last night was not the only happening in the area.

 How was Tribal Funk/Divine/Eternia ?

That was Begroovy - this was Larry " Getting to be like John S. Lee in my
      old age" Ching / larryc@netcom.com

Nope, there's no digest version yet, but I can create one if there's 
interest.  Let me know if you are interested.  Also, keep in mind that 
filtering your email can be a good way of not needing digests....

Dear All;

	Well, from one "F&F planner" who was also suppose to work at F&F,
but due to good friends not having tickets, had to stay away even though I
had a ticket, who went to a totally LAME nameless event lastnight, I will 
still have to agree with the princables Larry mentioned here, Sorry 
Begroove, but I still love ya hon :). Hope everyone had a great time, 
wish I could have been there. FUCK!!!!

         O.k, I don't know how well organized my thoughts will be here
  as I sit still bathing in the warmth of the F&F sunshine:). I do have 
to say that this has to be the best party I have gone to since I ventured 
out to C.A. from the N. Virginia area @ years ago. I tend to rate a party 
on just simpily the pure energy I feel from those around me and believe 
me I was a drowning:). I arrived at the site @3/4 P.M. to start helping 
set up and it is a perrrtttyyyy thing to see all these devoted people 
working their asses off to set it all up. Now I know there were alot of 
gripes about the unavailibilty of tickets. I can only wish that any one 
could of showed up; ticket or not, but it was in the best interests of 
Ethan and crew to keep attendance at a safe and certain #. THings started 
to get a little tricky with parking as the night progressed.
      The d.j.'s had quite the energy punch to supply the night and the crowd
with loads of FAMILY love. I want to especially thank , as always , 
Ethan, Tom, and Phred who gave me just what I like in the morning some 
Funky House. As i said before the people are what can make the party for 
me. Sure, you can the most awesome D.J.'s , but you need that certain 
crowd that is just going to take off with the D.j. I 've never danced 
sooo hard! At one point I was looking down at the ground wondering what 
force was keeping my feet going. I would like give many thanks ( and If I 
get your name wrong it is only because of lack of zzzzzzzzz) to the 
gorgeous Rachel, sidekick Vanessea and Rob for letting me be me, Wayne - 
for the warm cuddles and sacred security. Micheal "e" Clay you and Patrick
gave enough visual output to drench the senses for weeks to come. Greg 
and cindy, I 'm glad to know what the real Greg and Cindy look like. 
Oh boy I feel as though I've gone way off the track here, I' ll have to 
post in a couple of days when I'm a bit more mentallyt capable of  
threading my thoughts together. In conclusion, I just have to say that I 
can appreiciate what the word FAMILY means. Thank you all who made my 
night certainly one of the most memoriable. Take care all, I love you.

Seeing that everyone and thier half-brother Bob was going to ENIT.   I
decided to head off to cyber-wave trace stuff in Oakland.....

Well, I must say getting there in itself was an adventure... After riding
around east Oakland (or, shall I say, The Hood') for a 1/2hr. or so I decided
that maybe I was In the wrong side of town...  So I re-called, wrote down the
directions and managed to find the site around 12:30...

Intimate crowd, good vibe, however, I havent been to an allniter for almost a
month and it showed.. 
I slipped and fell (ouch, concrete is very unforgiving) once.   But the
people, the music was all beautiful.  Caught a few smiles and one or two
huggs.  No light show, but the weird paintings and the blacklights had great
tripabilty potental.  I danced through Myster-e perfomance.  Then nesteled
onto the floor and caught a few zzz's during Mars set (and although the music
certianly wasn't the type to lull one to sleep, it did make for some very
intense visions...).

One of the gems of this event was the "hidden" ambient room off in the corner
of the warehouse.  It was located in a hallway and the larger room totally
muffled the music.  I happend to it by chance when I saw someone walk down
the hallway.  Nice tunes tho.

Smile O meter:

Vibe:                   8Smiles
Dancin' Space:     9Smiles (concrete still the best media for steppin')
Smiles&Huggs:   9Smiles (Intamite crowds make for ideal conversation grounds)

Overall rating:  8.something or rather (you figure it out, im too tired)
In closing, don't worship people for what they do.  Love people for who they
are.....

I would like to say thank you for posting about the job at CompUSA. 
My dear friend really needed a job badly at the time, and she got 
hired. Say hi to her if ya feel like it, her name is Jody and she is 
a real sweetheart, a little shy though. And she loves house music, 
but has never been to party, I hope to change that soon. But thank you
again, it made her feel like she was worth something again. She loves 
it so far.

- Stay true to what you feel in your heart, and you will never be 
alone!

It was a pretty awesome event no matter how you look at it.  Well planned,
great music, excellent visuals, wonderful people, a perfectly sized and
located spot.  Nobody I talked with so far has said they had anything less
than a very good time and some did quite a bit better :)

With two outdoor ambient/tripbeat/chill areas and the main dance room, there
was plenty of music to choose from.  I don't want to play favorites or
anything, but I kinda liked the sets Jon Santos, John Carrel and Moonpup
did especially.  Moonpup showed me some moves on the Denon 2000 CD mixer
that proved again what a really good DJ can do with a, um, limited interface
than usual to get on track, but I liked the second half pretty well.  In
retrospect we should probably have wrapped up around 7, because it was
clear we exceeded the stamina limits, especially mine!  But it was really
an honor to finish this one up, and despite some disappointment in my
selections, I was more comfortable with the mechanics of spinning than ever
before, and that's very important to me as a stepping-stone to a more
responsive mix in the future . . .

What can I say about all the people who really made it happen!  Thanks
again, y'all are the best and it's always worth the trip!!

_THANK_YOU_ to the F&F DJs Sat night who, with an uncustomary complete
lack of any mercy at all, ripped into pounding hard acid trance, sick
tribal techno, other unspeakable things, and kept it relentlessly
going _most_of_the_night_. I've been wanting that so badly for so
long, to get it at F&F is icing on the cake. I normally don't try to
emphasize DJs too much, but this time was really special.

And it worked; they danced like crazy, the party ended, everyone fell
down :).

The crowd size was just right. Chalk that up to advance ticket sales
and good estimation of the space capacity.

And of course thanks to everyone that worked hard to make it happen and
those who brought their smiles. :)

F&F was a good party.  It would have been a great party if they had had 
dj's playing there that were able to listen to and assees a crowd and 
play music accordingly.  Slamming techno is alright for a set but a 
whole night of it is just aural masturbation by a couple of ego infested 
people who have about as much musical sense as a choir boy.  Yet another 
sad example of how the ego can ruin what would have otherwise been a 
perfect night. BUt the vibe was really good and strong.

 Well , I suspect that the DJs could only hear the folks that were going
"YEAH!!!" , which probably sounded like positive feedback to the DJs.

 I don't agree with the "ego infested" DJs idea , but I did find myself
wishing for some other stuff every once and awhile. Some sets were more
varied rhythmically than others ( Ethan's comes to mind ). I actully
yearned for house music for variety . I did enjoy the techno when I was
in shape for it.

 I think they were just playing what they knew best - anyway , there were
other outdoor options to "escape" to if one so desired. When I tired of
the main room  ( which was often ) , I checked out the other music spaces,
once I walked to my truck and took a nap in the back for an hour. 

 I really like the Moonpup set in the back chill/altar space - there should 
be more raves where a space is devoted to acid jazz/trip hop/dub/jungle . 
A slower dance alternative for those who still want to move but don't 
have the energy for hard techno.

my two bits on friends and family - 

this is the first one i've gone to where i didn't stay most of the night 
- i wasn't in the party mood so missy, sho and i went with the pretense 
of staying til about 3am and then going home...

this party was fucking slamming. as usual. :) the space - perfect. the 
crowd - perfect. the music - man, if i could get techno like that on a 
weekly basis in SF i'd be a happy man...

the strict ticket limitations were the greatest idea they could have 
thought of - although that garage was *hot*, there was enough room do do 
anything dance-wise or movement-wise you wanted. 

while talking with many of the people there, the comments of 'man, this 
is a *real* rave' kept popping up again and again...memories of warehouse 
parties in DC and Ohio came back - the view from outside of the energy, 
light, and music coming from the garage brought it all back. this party 
was the jam, it's too bad i was so tired. I probably danced for an hour 
and a half straight while i was there..the music just swept me up and 
kept me going..just wicked wicked tunes. :)

the clincher as to wether the party was genuine was definitely the vibe. 
man. what a wicked wicked vibe going on at this jam...i didn't run into 
one negative person and everybody had the fever. :)

anyway - enough rambling...this party gets the two thumbs up, way up, 
*and* a bag o' chips!

:)

F&F this weekend reminded me of what I love about the scene.  The
music and energy were phenomenal!  I met so many wonderful people, and
I'm still sore from dancing so hard.

Keep up the good work, you guys.

     Hey Folks,
     
     .. and now my 2 cents :)
     
                        + Friends & Family +
     
     God, what an amazing party! I think all this has been previously 
     mentioned, but god, THIS WAS A REAL RAVE! The vibe was just intense, 
     with more smiling 'n hugging than I've seen. Was it just me, or did I 
     notice a much 'older' crowd than in previous FnFs ?
     
     The space was just *perfect* for the 500 odd people there. It never 
     got too hot, although most of the people there were dancin' their bums 
     off! Great chill area as well, although from what I heard, around 6am, 
     the word 'chill' became all too real :) 
     
     The music as well was just fantastic! I for one thought there were 
     many fast and slow moments in the techno-trancing that all the great 
     dj.'s put out. It was truly a very contiguous 'journey' from 10:30pm 
     to 7:30am!! And a very very pleasant one too :)
     
     It was great to meet more of ya SFRavers. The energy put out by you 
     all is sometimes undescribable. It makes me so proud of the scene!
     
     And finally, thanks a million to he hard work and dedication of Ethan, 
     Mike Clay, Greg, Cindy, and everyone else who put on what was 
     definitely one of the best raves I've ever been to! Kudos n Hugs to 
     you all.
     
     (: smiles, and blinky light on! :) 
     
     -Sy

Email the number out - This the same reason I got bored and stopped going to 
the full moon parties- One of the main reasons we are on this list is so we 
can find parties to be with each other-  

I want to be classified 
I want to be stereotyped
I want to belong!

Wow - it's only Monday and everybody has already said what Friends and 
Family was like.  :) It was, indeed, incredible.  I took a very good 
friend of mine who hadn't been to a rave before...I thought an F&F party 
would be a good "first time" rave.  Boy was I right!!!  I found out that 
night how much I **LOVE** that faster paced techno-trance.  I don't get 
to hear it often, and when I do, I like to get it in large doses.  All 
the djs were FANTASTIC!!!  The space was perfect for the # of people. I 
was relieved that when it got to be pretty hot and humid in there, the 
main door was raised about halfway.  Thanks!!!  It kept me cool enough to 
dance much longer. 

I got the pleasure of meeting some more sfravers for the first time: 
Elmo, SASA, Purple Tiger and Drenalin. Sorry I missed out on meeting 
others who were there, but I didn't see you.  I did look for you! :)
I think Wayne's idea of a laminated "backstage pass" type of sfraver ID 
is a great one.  I'll pay the $$.  

Well, if Sunset is in the bay area next week, I will see y'all Sunday!!

love,
Amy

p.s.  Less than 2 weeks til Burning Man!!! :):):):):):):)

Well it's great to hear how wonderful of a time everyone had at F&F.  I
almost made it.  I had some friends (Consciousness Lab) playing in the
Ambient space that had some tickets for me.  My girlfriend and I went to
Berkely to have Thai food (yum yum) then to Oakland to pick up a record I
bought from DJ MinorMinor.(thank you very much)  Several time we tried to
get ahold of our friends but they were at the location setting up.  Turns
out we were very close to the party when we were picking up the record, but
DJ Minor being faithful to the F&F crew would not divuldge the location
(understandable).  So we gave up and drove to Mills college and spent the
night on the stage of the Greek theater they have (which was great).  When
we got back to Sacramento the next day there was a message on my answering
maching from Consciousness Lab that said they didn't get the tickets but
could get us in for _free_ if we were there before 10:00 p.m.  OOOOOOhhhhhh
the pain of it all......uuuuurrrrrrggggghhhhhh..  We were like just a few
blocks from the party at well before 10:00..   ...aaahhhhhhhhrrrrrgggghhhh.
Oh well, maybe next time.  I'm really glad the party "went off", just wish
we coulda been there.

	Sunset ruled.  Tha's all there is to say.  A fantastic follow up 
to FnF the night before, which I also had a great time at but was a bit 
too tired to enjoy to the fullest.
	Here's my Stoopid Me story for the weekend:  I was dancin real hard 
up near the DJ booth (I dun remember who it was), but I liked this one song 
so much that I started freakin' out and in the process banged the table 
with my knee and skipped the record.  I felt like such 
a fool.  Am I cursed forever?  Fah.  Gotta be more careful in the 
futcha... but it's hard to keep your balance when you're digging big, uneven 
holes in the sand as you dance.

	AFter this great weekend, what can I possibly look forward to 
that will measure up?  Another Sunset, that's fer sure.

Hi all!  Hope your week is off to a superb smiley start.  Had to jump-start
the day myself with a run and a double shot mocha, but the good vibes are
flowing strong now.

Those of you who went to ENIT and provided a self-description--I looked for
y'all, honest I did, but didn't find a one of ya!  I did however meet a
bunch of summer visitors to the Bay area from Germany, France, and some
super fun folks from Ireland!  Had a blast!  Pretty much agree with Seth
and Larry's assessment of the show, so I won't re-hash that whole thing. 
Stayed 'til the end, the last 3 or so hours were super, danced, smiled,
passed out skittles, it was great!

So I was a bit disappointed I didn't run into anyone from the list (at
ENIT) and I think Wayne's ID idea is a great one (thought the button idea a
while back was a good one too)!  I'd certainly be willing to pay for one,
and I think the benefits of meeting others on this list are well worth it.

Briefly spoke with someone while dancing to Sven Vath on the main floor,
Steven (?), asked me if I'd ever been to Sunset and I said I hadn't, if
you're out there, I'd love the new number.  Actually anyone who has the
number, it would be greatly appreciated!  I'd certainly love to take part
in the lovely atmosphere of Sunset that so many have described on the list,
it also sounds like a great atmosphere in which to introduce someone to the
wonderful world of raving, which I've been trying to do for some of my
friends.

Last, but certainly not least...
Brian, thanks for the pick-me-up of the day!...

"****<<<<<YOU'VE JUST BEEEN ZAPPED WITH 1 MILLON WATTS OF
LOVE>>>>>*********"

Sometimes that's all it takes to make an ordinary day extraordinary, and a
great day even better.  You've made my heart soar and I'll be on a cloud
for quite a while!

Peace and love to you all!

That was you.  Awwwwwaaa Man, I was in this totally killer groove mind set
and when that happened it totally was destroyed.  The rest of the party
sucked for me. So I left.... No, I'm totally kidding, I wasn't even there
and I'm sure you are forgiven.  Sometimes you just the music just makes you
bug out beyond your control.  Take care.

I think my message got munged a bit, but the part that dropped was about
my own set so no prob.  I felt kind of out of sorts about it since I was
playing vocal-oriented house (actually quite a bit more vocal than usual
for me) after a long string of techno+trance sets, but looking back 
I realize I simply was going a bit too hard and fast given the levels of
energy expended over the course of the night!  So when I dropped it down
a bit things seemed to flow a lot better.  Just another in the infinite
lessons about how to play records in public :-)

Hey!  Who you callin' "odd" pal?!

;^)

I just want to say that helping set up this party gave me an opportunity to
see just how much heart and soul goes into a Friends & Family event.  In
case anyone was in doubt, the vibe of a good party truly begins before the
event starts.  Days before.  In the flurry of preperation mid-week I often
asked myself, "Is it worth all this work?"  And then, about half way
through the party I was in one of the porta-potties and could hear these
people yelling and cheering and generally going mad.  I smiled (and shook)
and thought, "Of course.  How could it be otherwise."

Earlier, during set-up, Ethan's son was hanging out and I had to smile at
the thought of it being like father/son day at work.  At one point Ethan
said he had to take 15 mintues to chill with his son and from a mess of
wires and amps and speakers John Carel peers out and say, "O.K., that's
cool."  I imagine you just don't get that at the Crotch-a-dero.

Anyway, these people do it with their hearts in it.  Not for an ego boost,
but to provide an opportunity to the rave community to share with them the
joy and fun in pulling off a great event.  I even had fun parking cars
because each one represented a load of friends coming to party with us.
Every car counted as one, or four, or six smiles to be added to the worlds
largest ball of smiles that is this community.

NO BUST!  (The pre-party seance worked like a charm!)

Peace all!

Tony Rotundo

(And yes, that is my real last name!  ;^)

You people ROCK!

     Oh my dearest Phred how do I count the many, many thanks I want to 
give you for your set at the very tail end of F&F in the techno room. 
Thanx............................................:). I was soo tired from 
helping being at the site since about 3-4 P.M. and later finally getting 
to dance my booty off. I heard you spinning thouse little house stylings 
and went nuts. Thank you (again) for getting my energy backup. See ya soon.

     Yep, you heard how great it was or perhaps you were even part of it.  
     Yes, the music was good and varied (though like a couple of others, I 
     missed hearing some happy house mixed in), but overall the key thing 
     that made this party go off was the vibe and intention not only for 
     the crew that put this together but for the participants as well.  
     Imbibed or not the love was infectious, thick, and sweet.  
     
     It was a pleasure to meet more sfravers and for the many of you I 
     missed, we'll just have to try another rendez-vous (perhaps pre-rave?) 
     sometime.  
     
     As I mentioned to someone the next day, being a relatively new "kid" 
     into the scene it was a great to experience the warm, open welcome 
     into the F&F family by people I consider to be from the early SF scene 
     which makes sfraves so valueable.  Thanks Brian for creating this 
     space.
     
     It was great to go from F&F to Wake & Bake at 76 Minna (Oddball 
     Lounge) and see a few of the same faces still going off.  Some of us 
     just can't get enough...It was strange, though, to have Derrick Carter 
     and Garth spinning with just a couple of people on the dance floor. 
     According to someone working the gig, this was the second Wake & Bake 
     and they're hoping it'll catch on.  IMHO, if they keep a promising 
     line up of dj's and stay away from too many wailing divas like the 
     End-Up, perhaps there is more life on a Sunday morning--for me at 
     least.  I could easily deem dance my Sunday religion and skip going 
     out most weekend nights.
     
     After chilling for a while, I was talked into driving down to Sunset 
     (like I needed my arm twisted) to continue our weekend mission of 
     love.  Initially most of us chilled as we swapped reports of Tribal 
     Funk & F&F.  I still haven't heard from anyone who went to Eternia 
     (did they get a new space?) and Divine.  Evidentally Derrick Carter 
     and Dan?? (or is my memory failing me?) tried to top eachother at 
     Tribal Funk making the crowd go crazy.  
     
     When we finally rejuvenated, everything started coming together and 
     there we were dancing hard once again.  I didn't catch the line-up but 
     Tony's consistently incredible with his sets, and I wished I had more 
     energy and less of something else to continue dancing--but alas, even 
     this old gal has her limits.
     
     For me, this weekend was inspiring and refreshing to see shared 
     visions and love overcome the negativity we've experienced recently.  
     I'm glad to be a conscious part of it and I think Burning Man will be 
     incredibly unifying for us and our love of dance.
     
     See you on the dance floor!
     Diane

working fine at the new address from here on out.

ANNOUNCEMENT:  If you're not doing anything this Saturday nite, 
August 26, 1995, between around 12 midnite and 7 am Mountain Time, tune 
into Tribevibe and watch as we attempt to bring global rave culture to a 
new level by linking raves around the world via live videoconferencing 
over the Internet.  The homebase for this event will be the Skylab II party 
in Denver, Colorado hosted by Come Together, The Tribe, and LowerWorld 
Productions... (featuring Rabbit in the Moon, the Hardkiss brothers, Sniper, 
MC Marvel, local artists-making-it-big NebulaNine, local kickass 
hardcore-and-junglists Vitamin D & Fury, and local party-vibers Tribal Touch 
& Larry Bishop) 

If you are a promoter or friends with a promoter who is throwing a party 
this Saturday and would like to be part of this trend-setting experience 
in rave culture, and if you have some familiarity with setting up and 
using Cu-SeeMe client software or know someone in your area who does, 
please contact Andy Hawks via email (hawks@colorado.edu) or phone 
(303.693.4361) *ASAP* so we can be assured of a link-up by Saturday.


peace and lur.

Hi, this is Jim Cyr from 
Frequency 8 with two questions:

1)  It seems that the regulars on this list would REALLY like to
    get to meet and know each other - is there interest in organizing
    an entirely non-profit combination potluck/dancing event for some time
    in the early fall for sfraves regulars, lurkers, and friends?

2)  If anyone is aware of a large outdoor event being planned for this
    weekend in western Marin, could you please e-mail me privately?
    (e-mail address is:  surfpunk@well.com   )

As a list newby, I just want to say how great my night was at FnF. I think
I met a few sfravers, but as I was on my own little planet about the entire
night till closing down the shop(I stayed to the last song and was still
dancing) I can't really remember any of the names, I remember seeing that
neon Wired hat, but I don't think I had a single tech conversation all
night(would not have been capable of such dialogue), actually don't think I
talked much all night, only uttered a few silables. As know one here knows
me, I was the crazy little boy running around giving everyone water all
night (yes I was possesed by the need to quench the thirst of the entire
population and did quite a good job I think), I hope you got a few cups
from me. LOve Seth

Yes, in the best of all possible worlds Ethan et all would have
obtained a space big enough for all willing to attend.  I'm sure
that's what they wanted.  Unfortunately, we don't live in the best of
all possible worlds.  So compromises are necessary.  And the advanced
ticket sales seems to be by far the best one.  Advertising a party by
word of mouth or secret telephone numbers IS elitist.  Selling tickets
in advance on a first-come-first-serve basis is not.  Especially since
Ethan has made it very explicit when and where tickets will go on
sale; and warned everyone that they will sell out fast.  It seems to
me that the people who really wanted to go to this party made the
effort of getting a ticket early.

> ... don't have the party on Saturday night? ...

Some people work during the week.  Saturday night is the only time
they CAN stay out all night partying.  It seems to me that a
significant portion of the crowd F&F parties attract is such.

Sure- speaking as a most-of-the-time lurker, someone who doesn't go out
THAT often (but would like to do so a lot more!), and someone who has a
hard time meeting people, this sounds like a great opportunity to meet the
sfr clan. I've gone to many parties where SFR is supposedly in large
attendance, and not met a single SFRaver. Maybe it's me, but it's hard to
match faces to e-mail sigs!

Hey, I'm in pretty much the same boat as Brian. I think a list party would be
a great idea as long as it's not considered elitest.

Larry's SFRaves South Bay Lunch is just a little to far for me for lunch on
a workday, but I do plan to make it sometime.

Well, hope to see a lot of you at Burning Man. I'll be at the camp that has
the four foot paper mache newt to burn, right next to tiki camp.

 How's about some folks volunteer to make SFR/SFRaves banners ; not
the big wall hanging ones , but smaller ones that can be flown like
flags at Sunset and other such gatherings? I promise to make one -
I can't guarentee a comletion date , but I'll make one!

Hey , it's dead easy to have a lunch get together a la South Bay Lunch.
Just pick a nice legal site , pick a date that's convienent for most
folks , and announce it on SFRaves. 

 In fact , folks used to do it a lot more often two years ago. Time
some North Bay folks try it again!

Thank you very much!!! You saved me trips to the water bar by filling up my

I hope to speak more than a few words with you next time we meet. Now if
you could just help me find something for the teeth grinding... :D

Quite hydrated,

....wheew.  the adrenaline is still percolating through
my system.  Downright stellar night of music -- nobody dropped
the ball at all, and Jon Santos, Sabin, & Jeyson were very 
pleasant suprises for me.  I'd give the prize to Jon Santos
for his dextrous turntable hijinx, and for all around workin
that motherfucker.  I've felt nothing more beautiful in this
scene than the F&F luv-juggernaut in motion, and last night
it was rollin!

Hello everyone,

have or know anyone who has two seats in their car, please write me 
back!!! We already have tickets for the party. We don't need a ride 
back, we already have some friends down there that will take us back to 
the bay area. We only need a ride TO Narnia. Thanks in advance :) 

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people,

Greg :)

P.S. I did some head-scratching over this one. On the one hand, I hear 
people exclaming how wonderful it is that the "scene" is open to everyone, 
and on the other I see an immediate change of number when it is published 
in what I would not really consider a "mainstream" magazine.

that we try to get together on such a day as tuesday, in such a location as
golden gate park.
we can probably scrape up a boombox between us, along with some cool cd's,
and have ourselves a cool lunch.

any comment, responses, yaehs, naehs, others?

Dear Jim;

	Just a word of hesitation, with regard to throwing lurker/hack
related stuff, many have tried, many have failed, to try a get the ever
elusive sfraves lurkers/hack, all in the same 3D space, at the same time. 
F&F is the closest true hyperreal party going, since it has, no doubt, the
highest percentage of lurkers & hacks I've seen thus far. Of course I
would love to attend a lurker/hack events, being one, and you will have my
support. Try talking with ptiger, he tried to start, a prerave warmup
party/meal/get together. 

	Good luck & good hunting ahhh planning.

Hello, I'm a fellow "raver" from Seattle on vacation, and this Friday 
I'll be  arriving in SF on the wonderful Green Tortise bus.  I'm looking 
for some kind souls who might take me in for a week or so while I blow 
lots of money all around town.  I am on nw-raves, and Karen, a fellow 
list member, told me to mention her name when sending this message, 
saying that all the sfravers se meet down there were very cool.  

Furthermore, any of you who are planning on going to burningman, I am 
hunting and hunting for a ride there and back to SF.  If you have any 
space, I'd gladdly contribute anything I could for the trip.


Please help me, I'm so unorganized right now.
Patrick Fuller

P.S.  This mailing list is crazy, there's so much traffic. I must have 
seen 20 reviews of Friends and Family.  Wow.

Vince <vince@vmar.com> and I, & Susan Kameny <susie@priscilla.ultima.org>
and I  talked about it at F&F and we're definitely psyched to take the bull
by the horns on this one.

We're going to hopefullu see soon some artwork that Susie has of some "rave
badges of yore". Vince is hopefully then design a new one for '95 (the rave
id badge '96 model year?!). Although I bet that he's got some ideas on art,
themes or ideas, please send us yours to:

<wayne@collab.com> and <vince@vmar.com>

One open issue is for me to get/buy/rent a badge laminator. Anybody got one
hanging around? (f&f crew?)

We'll keep you posted!

weeee!

I was one of those people who were too lazy to get a ticket.  And of 
course I feel a bit out of sync with SFRaves for missing out on this 
event, but it's my fault for not putting forth any effort.  Bum-mer.  

Robot Wars was awesome.  They actually had someone DJ'ing techno while 
the robots fought... Look for a big mechanized walrus next year...  with BIG 
CHOMPING TEETH in the heavyweight class - oh yeah.

Sunset was ok.  less crowd, less vibe... still fancy enough for me. 

Where's David Alves?  I miss his poetic reviews.

I think that a Sfraves Lunch bash would be a really nice gesture in bringing
the the Hyperreal bunch (a I tend to call all of yous') together in one area.
 I see a "usual" crowd at many of the events I go to but (as Cyr and a few
others can support) im usually dancing all the time so I really don't kick
back much and chat...

In ending, post a weekend day and, if my job permits, I'll be there...

I think it would be a really great idea. The only thing I can forsee is 
that it appears that so many people have very different schedules. I 
see a trend to the times people post to the list and it looks as 
though there are definitely people who post during the day, and 
people who post during the night. But if there is some time agreed 
upon I'll definitely try to appear, schedule permitting of course! :)
It's nice to come out of your shell once in a while and see the sun 
isn't it?

Luv to all and may it never end!

Okay, let me try it this way - how many folks on the list work within a 
"reasonable" (you be the judge of that value) distance of South Park in 
SF?  I.e., between 2nd and 3rd and Bryant and Brannan - we could have a 
weekly meeting in the park there, there are plenty of food places around 
and the park's pretty big.  Um... How does Wednesday at 12:30 sound?

One of the things I like about raves is the sense of Unity that can
sometimes pervade an entire party.  I'd have a problem with a banner that
clearly advertised a particular faction or clique within the scene -
unless it's the group that is actually putting on the party.  Last
year the MESS folks displayed an altered, but still recognizable
American flag at a few Sunsets.  Even though I am an American, I
expressed my distress to them about it.  I don't know, maybe this is
just another bug that I haven't removed from my ass yet...

Marco,

	Hey. You remember me because I had an extra ticket to the Enit
festival... Anyway, I saw your post & I thought maybe I knew what you
were feeling, so here I am writing to you, hoping to offer some comfort
or whatever.

	I just graduated from college last year, and although I never thought
it's what I'd end up doing, I did the standard thing. I got a job that pays
well but means nothing. I thought it would be ok for a couple of years
until I could find my mythical dream job that would probably pay well and
involving saving the lives and or souls of thousands of people/animals/plants
a week & then I could feel good about myself & that would be that.

	Well, after a couple weeks I could tell that the dream job was a dream
and the job job I had taken was taking over my life. I felt like a piece of
the machine and I knew I hadn't signed up for that. I felt like I was, without
my consent, slowly giving up little parts of myself (my dreams, my style, the
less societally acceptable elements of my personality) I was conforming!

	I don't know if this is what you were talking about in your post, but
I didn't know what to do with myself either, I felt like I was falling too. I 
felt utterly out of control of my own actions...

	What I did was I cried a lot until I realized that I'm always in control
of myself. I could not believe I had forgotten my own free will. I didn't
quit my job and embark on a journey of the earth, but I regained my assurance
that I control my thoughts and actions. I'm at my job because I want the money.
It's as simple as that. While I'm there they don't control my feelings about
anything, and while I'm not there I can participate in anything I like. It
might sound like a very little thing - but it's something that was being
obscured from my view and I'm so glad I can see it again. 

	I have plans. I'm not going to get stuck in a situation I can't feel
free in because I'm determined not to & I'm determined not to forget that
I'm determined not to. I'm tempted to get specific, but the specifics don't
really matter at all...

	I guess the point is I would never have gotten here if I hadn't
realized I was falling... I'm proud of you for realizing it about your
life - and for posting. We all need a reminder now and again...

						With much love & respect,

								Kat.

Next time you are at Sunset, ask Galen what kind of garbage filled the
voice mail the day after the Guardian article.  

The "scene" *is* open to everyone.  Individual parties can't be.  Even
b4 the Guardian article Pacific was thinking of changing the number.  If
Sunset gets too big and messy and difficult to manage, it will be shut down.
Inevitably, and perhaps unfortunately, idealism must be balanced with reality.

Good enough for me.... Like I said I was head-scratching, not making an 
inditement of a group that has been throwing some great gatherings. 
Actually, I am rather curious about what was garbage was put on the voice 
mail. Guess it is just my smut gland ;) in overdrive.

I felt real cool- when a wonderful woman from Italy, with shiny dark hair 
handed my a Sunset flyer in Golden Gate park, last summer- I decided that I 
needed to check this party out! The first time I went, there was only ten 
people there and we all had a ball. 

The word of month thing is fun it adds to the excitement- but my friends 
generally don't hang with the in/what have you crowd- Were off on our 
own trip and I want to make sure they get the number to keep them out doors 
listening to some hot tunes and blowing kisses at you..

P.S. I did some head-scratching over this one. On the one hand, I hear 
people exclaming how wonderful it is that the "scene" is open to everyone, 
and on the other I see an immediate change of number when it is published 
in what I would not really consider a "mainstream" magazine.

Tonight (Tuesday, August 22nd) there's going to be a
performance by Mandible Chatter at the Hotel Utah (4th and
Bryant in SF)... they're a group with roots in industrial
ambient that's slowly been losing interest in harsh and
noisy sounds and I would say is now definitely in territory
of interest to ambient techno fans...  The last time I saw
them play at this venue they had a woman doing Tai Chi-like
moves throughout the performance, and recently I've heard
about them performing with a troupe of Butoh dancers, which
may give you an idea of what to expect tonight... or maybe
they'll do something else entirely.  

The opening act is some jazz-oriented improv
people... Ellery Eskelin, a tenor sax player visiting from
New York will be joining the Ben Goldberg Trio (Ben Goldberg
is an excellent local Clariniet dude), and in my opinion
this is an inspired line-up.  A lot of the tracks on Ellery
Eskelin's last CD, "Jazz Trash" have a definite ambient feel
to them: lots of long, slow notes.

I don't know what the time is exactly for this, probably
around 8:30 PM.  Cost is just $3.  

This is part of the "Dark Circle Lounge" series organized
by Gino Robair, if that means anything to you...

I didn't realize what a burden I'd been under at some recent parties trying
my hardest to put out positive energy and keep things going up.  F&F was pure
joy for numerous reasons but a big one was that I didn't have to even think
about trying to increase the vibe -- it was flowing into me faster than I
could put it back out!  I too kept thinking, "Oh yeah, this is what its all
about. How did I forget? "  Thanks and big hugz to everyone, especially Ethan
and crew, for a wonderful night and kickin my faith back into high orbit. 

Maybe its just me, post-F&F energy, end-of-summer increased mammalian
activity, post-Jerry deadhead invasion, or that special new friend of mine
but I feel so much positive energy and activity from this list the past
couple of days.  
Badges, lunches -- what we're missing is bowling I'm tellin ya ;-)

Friends and Family/Sunset review
================================

Well,  it's certainly been a while since I posted any reports,   so this
is my first one,  now that I finished my programming work,  which was
writing a new language.   I always wanted to know what it would be like
to design a complete programming language from scratch,  designing a
syntax,  and implementing it.   Now that all I have to do is bug fixing,
I can start writing killer reports again,  and work on my WEB page.

Speaking of WEB pages,  I'm looking for any SFRaver/AusRaver who is
willing to send me pictures of themselves so I can include a picture and
link to those that have WEB sites.

Anyways,  back to the report...   Sorry I couldn't make the indoors
Freq-8 party,   but lack of wheels prevented me from attending.   Nor
was I able to attend the Aquatic park Sat afternoon thingie,  because I
was unable to talk Robert into taking me there.

That evening,  Craig lost his ticket to F&F,   but with some sleuthing
around,  reading my SFRave mail,  learned that someone had an extra
ticket and called him 15 minutes after he posted it.   WOW!  What luck.
But when I tried to tell Craig,  he had already made up his mind not to
go.   Besides,  he needed an extra day for his knee to heal.

Thanks go to Robert for getting me to F&F,   and on the way there,  due
to heavy traffic caused by I-80 road work,  we had to detour through
Berkeley,  and on the way,   we saw some rave-like event on the bottom
part of Gilmon St.   Wonder what it was?

We finally make it to High St (Appropriately named - of course),  and to
the Map point.

The venue was a medium size warehouse in a large shipping yard with huge
shipping containers,  and one was put to use as a cozy chill zone area.

As I arrived,   checking things out,   I knew that this was going to be
ONE FAT party,   and it certainly lived up to my expectations.

One thing that really pit a big phat smile on my face was the higher
BPM's of the music.   Omygawd..  It even got faster than 140 BPM's,
quite rare for these parts.

It didn't take me long to get absorbed into all this good energy
floating around,   as I started dancing my ass off.   WOW!! The energy
was INSANE!!   Especially Ethan's set....  I was literally in a trance,
where my brain was somewhere out in the next galaxy...   The video was
superb and provided me with some great "Eye candy".   Great work!
Speaking of Eye candy,  has anyone seen the HeadTravel computer CD yet?
It contains a lot of clips from the SF rave scene/ Sunsets,  etc.
Check it out,  if you have a Mac or PC with CD player.    The video
section is really spacey and provides some excellent EYE candy...

All throughout the wonderfully warm evening,  the energy level stayed
completely off the scale...   As usual,  the temperature was hotter then
I liked,   but thanks to the fans,  and the wonderful warehouse owner
who opened the large door,   the temperature stayed below my tolerable
level.   Providing me with more dance time...

It wasn't until Fred came on,  that things started to slow down into a
more traditional house pace.    But most people welcomed that,
especially after so much hard trance all night.

Things stayed hopping all the way until WELL AFTER 8:30 AM,  and hats
off to the wonderful warehouse owner who was literally getting into the
groove,  dancing just as much as everyone else.

I left shortly after that,  as Robert wanted to get back and get some
rest before Sunset.   As usual,  I TRIED to get some sleep,   but I was
way too energized to even consider sleep.

That afternoon,  we headed down to Santa Cruz but really phucked up and
took the WRONG ROUTE,  and got stuck in traffic.   We eventually made it
in over 3 hours.   As usual,   sunset was PHAT!   and the vibe was
really great.    As usual,  it didn't take me long before I was out
there, dancing like a maniac....   Again,   thanx to the wonderful vibe,
I went into a really great happy trancey space....  Everywhere around
me,  all I saw was a really good vibe,   lots of people (at least 400 or
so),
having a GREAT time.

The organizers of Sunset really have it down,  and never fail to put on
a GREAT party...  taking care to not let things get TOO BIG!!

Sunset went WAY INTO the evening,  with Tony spinning a total INSANE set
of some of the finest trancey house I've heard.   WOW!! This dude just
gets better and better.   Not to be outdone,  Galen finished up the
evening with his usual brilliant set,  always doing different things
with his music each time he goes on.

Towards the end,   the rangers came "en masse" but as Gelen realized
that the beach ws closing,  faded down the music,  and thanked everyone
or coming,  and reminded people to pick up their litter.

The rangers were really nice about it,   and shined the flashlights
around to help us locate our litter,  as I'm sure all they wanted was
for us to leave the beach as soon as possible.

We get word of an After-party on Pacific Ave.  in Santa Cruz,  so head
on out there to check it out.    We arrive and learned that the cover
was only $1 and danced until 2 am before crashing at a friends place in
Santa Cruz.    While I was at Blue Lagoon (Name of the bar),   This
older hippie type dude came up to me,  and said "WOW!!  I like your
energy?"

We talked a while,   but I wanted to get more dancing in before 2 am,
when the Blue Lagoon closed.   Sometimes,  it's hard to balance my dance
time with Schmooze time...

Afterwards,  we left,  and I still have a big phat smile on my face as a
result of over-exposure to all that good vibe that took place over the
weekend.

        Kat and Marco and others :)

        i know this feeling all to well. Right now i'm not able to follow
my dreams because i DON'T have a good solid income.  It's always a trade
off. What has always helped me break out of that feeling of helplessness,
that feeling of heaviness, intertia. Is to step outside of everything for a
bit, either through meditation or dancing or other things that pull you out
of your way of thinking. We all don't realize what ruts we create for
ourselves in approaching problems, and these 'ruts' can start off as being
a 'groove' too.  Routines can go from good to bad easily. So, every now and
then, break the routine: go for a walk somewhere where you've never been,
do something that you've never done before, cut your hair, drugs may help
some people but it can be a crutch for some as well.  Go perpendicular on
your path through life instead of the straight and narrow. ;) Drop
everything, become one with the universe _then_ go back to balancing your
checkbook, you'll find you can deal with it better. Well, it has worked for
me :)
        hope this helps,
                brad

Well, they're probably one of the many (like me!) who desperately wanted to
go, but couldn't get tix... It probably cost them more than $5 to
counterfeit, so I doubt money was the main issure here.


I can't really answer any of the other questions, as I didn't get to go...
sniff, sniff. :(

Galen's been very concerned this year with the amount of people showing up,
and having the number in the Guardian, which I'm sure has a circulation in
excess of 50,000. And I have to admit, I did prefer the smaller size of the
first Sunset after the number change. There's a reason why you hardly ever
see Sunset flyers.

It's a tough call trying to decide how public to make the number.

The best way to get people frm SFRaves together is: If you know you are 
going to event post a pre-dinner or a meeting place before you go to a 
place. That way you know you can  meet new sfravers and maybe if someone 
doesnt have a ride they can meet there and catch a ride with someone to 
an event.

Yes, very true. "You can't make all of the people happy all of the time" 
comes to mind. On the other hand, as one who happened upon the scene by 
themselves, and not through friends, I feel for those that are not as 
"connected." That's all. It saddens me to think how many wonderful people 
are out there missing out, and get discouraged after going to shitty 
parties that aren't worth the cost of the phone call to find out where 
they are, because that is all they can find. It is a bit of a balancing 
act, isn't it?

Recovering too.  I was in SF over the weekend, Saturday afternoon I did
a two-hour slot at Ameba on Haight St., then we had Friends & Family in
a classic "virgin Oakland warehouse" (now deflowered, heh) and I spun the
cleanup spot (literally, they were pushing brooms across the dance floor
when I finished up near 9 :)

Just came back from a meeting of the local club and rave people with
Officer Langston from the Portland PD Central Precinct.  This was to
talk about club-related problems and to move toward more productive
relations with the police.  Reps from Up Front and Montana (Ali and
Jeff), the Quest, D-J from Queer Night, Brad, Yasu and me were all
there.  It was a pretty good meeting, Langston handed out some preliminary
summaries of the police incident reports from the last couple of years
and it really doesn't look very bad at all, certainly not enough to
support the kind of "teenage nightclub ordinance" a few of the police
command types want.  There's a more formal meeting with the city at
1
1 pm on Thursday to look at the latest draft of the ordinance, which
is almost identical to the last one.  I think we're doing pretty well
in responding to this whole thing.  In Portland, at least, there is a
chance to work with the police in a productive way, which currently seems
to be difficult (Seattle) or impossible (SF) elsewhere.

see you in the future!

Hello SFRavers -

 I sort-of asked a version of this question many months ago , but didn't
follow up on it. Now , I'm more motivated , as my wife and I want to get into
Web page development , and being able to get to and traverse Web pages.
We have NETCOM as our Internet service provider , and they don't offer
new SLIP or PPP accounts any more. ( My wife has AOL , but ppfttt ... )

 So -
 1. Can anybody recommend any Internet access providers that have SLIP and/or
    PPP accounts in the 408 area code ?  We live in Sunnyvale. If SFRavers
    work there , so much the better!

 2. Same question - for 415 area code , near Sunnyvale ( I don't want to
    rack up long distance charges if I can help it ).

 Thank you for your patience -

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

Has anyone thought about doing a dinner/dancing kind of get together?  I 
think it would be cool to have around 40-50 people, all bringing food or 
something to contribute, and maybe a small sound system for 
sfrave dj's to spin in a more casual setting.  Kind of like the ameba 
ambient tofu barbecue, but in a park somewhere around sunset.  I doubt 
the cops would bother us if the music wasn't too loud and everyone was 
eating.  Berkeley marina sounds good to me...

	How to Have Chocolate Cake with Whip Cream & Eat It Too
			by Brian Darkness

	First, take off all your clothes, paint yourself purple(actual 
color optional), grab your genitals(or some other consenting adults), and 
jump up and down screaming repeatedly "Fuck you Stanley Milgram, and the 
horse you rode in on", until you drop from exhustion, and/or until the 
police come and arrest you. This is what I do to keep a free & clear 
thinking mind.

	She stood over me, a bit of bright sunlight reflecting off her
jeweled silver axe, and speaking; she asked; "do you want to live
forever?"

Precedence: bulk

Okay...um...this is sort of an odd request, or inquiry I have decided to
make because of a phone call earlier tonight informing me that it is looking
unlikely that my friends from the south bay area will be coming to visit me
and thus accompany me to Narnia this weekend..though that possibility still
exists, though it's not certain

originally my plans called for me to bring a sleeping bag along to the
venture, while one of my friends would likely supply the tent...seeing as
that may not happen now...does anyone out there on either list who is going
to Narnia on Saturday and is bringing a tent, have room to spare for this
poor stranger's sleeping bag and backpack of supplies? I only ask because my
other ride option is, at least as I understand it, either not bringing a
tent because one or both of them live in or near San Diego, or are utilizing
their friend's tent..who does not have room

so anyway, I may or may not need some kind sould to grant my wish, but I
thought I'd send out the request just in case my friends from Los Altos,
Sunnyvale and Cupertino do actually flake on me, like it sounds like they may

on the plus side, I pack light, and you'll get to meet me :)

thanks a bunch
and hope everyone has a grand ol time at Narnia

Okay, it's me...wondering "loan me your tent" boy :)

I've got another request, wish, desire...apparently, my friends who it looks
like can no longer drive me to Narnia also did not pick up a ticket for me
in San Francisco like I asked them to....so I'm looking to exercise one of
two options...either

1) directions to one of the shops mentioned at the Narnia number as selling
tickets in Los Angeles (my phone makes the shop names difficult to understand)

                                   or

2) purchase a ticket from a list subscriber who happens to have an extra
ticket to spare for Narnia

I would greatly appreciate any replies as soon as possible since I will
likely have to make a trip to the LA area for other reasons either Wednesday
or Thursday, and that would prove convienent for me either getting a ticket
at one of the shops, or if a socal-raver is availalbe for a few minutes one
of those with an extra ticket, I could probably get it then...or if
someone's willing to meet me outside of San Diego, or somewhere along the
way to Narnia and sell me the extra ticket...

anyway, just e-mail me if you can assist with one of the two options listed
about, and I'm sure we can work something out

>>
>>	The study was performed on average people like you and me, well

>>coat(actual experiment dress)), could tell us to perform tasks, or give us
>>orders, that we would carry out to the letter, even if we were directly
>>aware that these orders were directly hurting/harming/maming individuals
>>we weren't acquainted with, and had no prior knowledge or history of, not
>>even a 1st name. 
>>
>>	The study was conducted with 3 people, the authority fiqure, a

>>this subject/actor was the person the study was being conducted on, when
>>it was really the earth people the study was being performed on. They
>>didn't know, until the study was over, that it was all fake, and that the
>>person they thought was the subject, was really an actor. 
>>
>>	The earth people were led into a room in which they could not see

>>subject/actor got the question wrong, that the earth person should throw
>>the 1st switch, and that it would shock the subject/actor with the voltage
>>label on that particlur switch. The more ?'s the subject/actor got wrong
>>the higher the voltage went, the more severe the shock would be ...etc. 
>>
>>	What was actually happening, as the earth person threw a switch to
>>a wrong question, it would play back a prerecorded fake response, Like oh
>>that feels funny; at the low voltages, to fits of pain, screams of "STOP
>>please STOP", to finally dead silence at the higher voltages. So actually
>>no one was being shocked, but the earth people throwing the switches
>>didn't know that, and when the authority fiqure would sense hesitation in
>>an earth person, they would say things like please continue, or they're ok,
>>and encourage the earth people to continue.(Pretty Fuckin Scary Huh)
>>
>>	The results, something like 85% and higher of the earth people

we rented the one we used for a majority of the tix.  we've got a mini one
but that only kicks out 5-10 then you have to turn it off plus you have to
run the laminate through like 3 to 4 times. 
 
 
cheapest place to rent was AJM in Santa Clara.  rent it over the weekend
for the same one day fee.

I am totally down for this idea.  I could spin ambient while everyones
eating. Others could spin after for dancing.  Just tell me what I need to do.

     Over a year ago Brian Behlendorf, sfraves list founder and moderator, 
     bought a machine to host sfraves, the techno-rave archives, the drug 
     archives, and various othe rave and non-rave-related lists and 
     projects on. 
     
     At that time he submitted a domain name registration to the INTERNIC 
     for sfraves.org.  So, to answer your question, he filled out a form to 
     get the name for the machine.  That's it.  It's just a name, no big 
     governing body or anything.  sfraves.org sounded a lot better than 
     sfraves.com :-)

No Fuckin Way.....  In a book I read by T. Lobsang Rampa called "The Third
Eye" (best seller at one time I believe).  A young Tibeten monk (the author
of the book) has his third eye opened by a senior lama.  A hole was drilled
in the third eye area and a wood chip soaked in some kind of herbs and oil
was incerted.  Eventually the skin grew back over the area, but after the
procedure the monks perception was greatly enhanced.  Great book.

When I wanted to make sure no one tried to grab that domain name for less 
than honorable reasons.  Should have done the same for vrml.org, ah 
well.  Don't worry, there's nothing more official than just that name, no 
"organization" headed up by any secret world government under the nation 
of Schwa with Dick Assman as its leader - noo, certainly nothing like 
that.  :)

Karen - since about noon yesterday a whole chunk of the internet 
including AOL and wimsey and a bunch others have refused to talk to the 
network Hyperreal is on for some reason.  It's being traced out now, but 
it does explain why you and others aren't getting mail.  I wish it was 
something I could fix but I can't.  Notice I had to re-route personal 
mail to you to a machine that I knew could talk to yours... I could 
reroute all mail but that would get very ugly very quick.  Just sit 
tight, I'll be surprised (and peeved) if it doesn't get fixed by tonight.

Wow, I was going to say something along those lines right when I read your 
response. Cats have always messed with my head!? It's the strangest thing 
they hiss at me and have often appeared in my life before something bad has 
happened. Don't get me wrong I like cats, they just can freak me out- 
Especially their eyes-

Birds on the other hand, always love me. They have landed on my arm from out 
of the blue and they tend  to appear to me the most when things are going 
well.. For instance a white dove stayed on my car for a whole night- when I 
was working. And the next day I got a raise. Call me crazy- But they don't 
say life is for the birds for nothing..

Dear All;

	I totally agree with all that's been said, E is Not cut with 
Herion. First of all having tried China White, Mexican Black Tar, & 
French Synthetic Herion, the high is nothing like anything I've ever 
experienced on any E. Herion is any of its forms both pharm, & black 
market would kill a lot of people who weren't used to it, due to respitory 
depression., not to mention the cost increase of the drug itself. 

	For me however, having done the two together (prescribtion narcotics 
& E) the high is something to experience, & I find it very enjoyable. 
However I would not recommend that anyone try this unless they are very 
familar with the effects of both of those drugs separately, and then 
being very conservative, and slowly increaseing the dose of each(together) 
over time, and incidence.

	But hears the ?, if herion & speed is called a speed ball, & E &
acid is called candy flipping or trolling, then what would E & narcotics
be called? Suggestions welcome

	Wow, what a great thread.  I love cats... especially Harley, my 
best friend in the world.
	He's got this weird habit, tho.  Perhaps some cat owners 
out there could help me:  I had Harley neutered at age one (as per Bob 
Barker's instructions), BUT--he has this annoying/endearing habit of 
humping my leg (quite often) in a truly obscene manner.  He does it all the 
time!?  Where does he get the hormones from? 
	Anyone know animal psychology out there?

	Wait--this isn't rec.pets.cats....

		ooops,  sorry.

p.s. Halllooo to everyone I met at Sunset, and thanks Dave M. for saying hi.

Tickets are $20 in advance, and I would definitely get tickets in advance. 
I think Behind The Post Office and Housewares are selling them up here - you can call 415.437.4065 ticket info and stuff.

It lasts from 6pm Saturday to 12 Noon Sunday...
I am still unsure how much the event costs though. You may want to call 
the info number and sit through the "worm."

Ok here is all the info.  First it is SUPPOSEDLY going to run from 6pm 
saturday to Noon on Sunday (although from peoples previous experience, 
I would seriosly doubt it if it runs much past 6amish).  It will be in SD 
county and it will be within 1 hour of all major SD beaches.  Also it 
will be outdoors.  The site/directions should be announced either today 
or very shortly.  Rumor has it that it will be in the Ramona area (very 
strong rumor) which about 1 hour from SD proper.  Hope you all have fun.

     A brief lesson about email and the net, for those of you who are new 
     to this.  Forgive me if I bore the techies.
     
     The net's connectivity and reliablity is by no means perfect.  It's 
     not anywhere near as reliable as the phone network, for example (you 
     would not believe the redundancy built into that thing).
     
     For instance, my mail leaves the PC on my desk --> 
     goes out on our local Novell network --> 
     gets pushed through a gateway --> 
     gets put out on a link to UUNET (our company's internet service 
     provider) --> 
     gets passed through multiple machines on the way to UUNET--> 
     once it gets to UUNET, it then gets passed out of UUNET (probably 
     along SPRINTNET) toward hyperreal, again passing through several 
     different machines --> 
     Finally, the mail arrives at hyperreal.
     
     Let's say, for the sake of argument, that my letter passed through 10 
     machines just to get to hyperreal, and that there are 10 machines 
     between you and hyperreal.  Therefore, there are 20 machines and 21 
     individual net-links that my  message must travel over.  At any time 
     one of these machines or links could go down, causing a delay (or 
     sometimes a message to be bounced).  Each of these 20 machines gets 
     its DNS (domain name service) from another machine...if the machine my 
     mail message is on can't contact the machine it gets its name service 
     from, then the first machine can't pas the mail on through the net.
     
     To make things worse, some machines "speak" different mail protocols 
     than others.  There's been lots of work to make these protocols 
     compatible, but every so often a bug surfaces and something doesn't 
     work right ... so mail can be delayed, lost in the great bit bucket in 
     the sky, or be reincarnated in multiple copies arriving in your 
     mailbox.
     
     A lot of the time it's not hyperreal's fault, and there's nothing 
     Brian can do about it.  Believe me, he, Andrew Bennett, and the other 
     hyperreal administrators do stay on top of how majordomo (the sfraves 
     list server) operates and on how mail in general is doing as it passes 
     through hyperreal. 
     
     In a way, it's a marvel that mail works at all, what with all the 
     things that must happen for a message to get from one place to the 
     next.  For example, as Brian pointed out today, something is wrong on 
     one of the links between where hyperreal is and where AOL picks things 
     off the net, so no one from AOL is getting mail (this may be all 
     better by now).  These things happen....
     
     Basically, the Internet is now a collection of networks that talk to 
     each other.  There's really no central routing scheme like the US Post 
     office uses...for example, you'd THINK that if I sent email from my 
     account at Berkeley to my account on hyperreal, it would stay in the 
     Bay Area.  Not true -- last time I checked, it got routed out through 
     WASHINGTON DC to eventually get to Sprintnet's gateway, wherein it 
     then got passed back to hyperreal.  It's vaguely like a freeway -- 
     sometimes you need to go past your destination to get to an exit that 
     will let you on the road you really need.  Actually, it's more like 
     flying internationally -- to get to Swansea (Wales), you might fly to 
     London (closest major international gateway) and then depend on 
     services in London to get you to Swansea.  Along the way there can be 
     bad weather (bursty internet traffic, downed routers, brain-dead DNS), 
     equipment problems (machines down), and dealing with customs 
     (different mail protocols talking to each other).
     
     Yours for better Internet understanding,

Hi there,

What was said was more true when hosts were primarily connected to the
Internet via UUCP. It was truly a co-opeartive effort, and back when my
friends and I first got our AT&T Unix PC's connecting to each other (circa
1985) and sending mail around it used to amuse us to see the wacky and
mysterious routes our mail took.

Now, most computers (or mail hosts, that is) are directly connected to the
Internet via TCP/IP and use SMTP to send the mail along its way.

In my case, I use Eudora on my Mac. When I press the "send" button it
connects directly using SMTPto my collab.com (my mail host) which is a
machine that's always running at my loft. Our loft network is directly
connected to the internet via a dedicated digital line. Because of this, in
our case, no UUCP is involved. As a result of the direct TCP/IP Internet
connectivity of both 'collab.com' and 'hyperreal.com', the hosts directly
connect and transport mail to each other using the SMTP protocol running on
top of TCP/IP. From 'hyperreal.com', it is delivered as directly as
possible to the hosts that each of you have your accounts on. If you
connect to an internet service provider (Netcom, Best, PSI, etc.) there's a
very, very high chance that Hyperreal.com was able to directly connect to
and deliver your mail to your mail host directly. If you are on a LAN not
directly connected to the Internet, then there's some host that has to dial
up and check for mail that's waiting for you on some directly connected
host that is configured to me your (or your company's) mail host.

This stuff's a bit boring to some (I am sure), but becomes more interesting
when things aren't working and you're wondering why... This is by no means
a complete description of Internet mail transport, (hey, it's a rave list,
right? not comp.protocols.tcp-ip!) but I just wanted to interject a bit
more info).

It's F&F review time, part 87!

Last week's F&F was the best event I've ever been to. If there were an
ideal "warehouse rave" I would have ever pictured in my mind, this was it.
The outdoor ambient areas were very cool, especially the carpeted one where
the Jerry Garcia shrine was. It was like a little Ewok village with all the
people piled around on those bean bags later in the night. I spent a bit of
time there myself!

In order, my favorite events I've been here are: last week's F&F, Wicked
(in June) at 174 King St., and that small renegade outdoor F&F at the
Albany landfill a few months ago.)

At Hyperreal <http://hyperreal.com/raves/health/tinnitus.FAQ>
is a FAQ about Tinnitus, which is characterized as "ringing ears" 
due to external loud noises. It's quite interesting. 

I would post it, but it's really long!

friends and family is NOT a public party ...it's based on word of mouth 
invitations/tickets and is limited to FRIENDS (and friends of friends) 
and FAMILY.

i have to disagree slightly here... while i do not speak for the whole 
collective, i must say that i do prefer smaller parties - not over 700... 
once you get over that it can still be great, but it's defintiley a 
ddifferent atmosphere...  especially indoors...however, i would like to 
se not "all those WILLING to attend" attend, but all those willing to 
make it a priority (i.e. getting a ticket in advacne or whatever it 
requires..)  unfortunatley, i think this time there were many willing to 
take the extra steps and just not enuf tickets...however, i am glad we 
kept numbers limited to ensure enuf space and safety for all...

well, i've got to disagreehere, too...advance tickets may be LESS 
elitist, but let's face it, who is the announcement made to: 
SfRaves...people at Sunset...friends and family and friends...i mean, 
we're not standing on the corner of 16th and Mission screaming it out...

okay, wow, this is a record number of posts for me recently..usualy I 
just lurk...anyway, I'll be at Narnia on Saturday, and I plan on meeting 
many of you who have contacted me via e-mail recently...so, I'm gonna 
give you some info on how to track me down
I'm 21, 5'10", 160lbs, brown eyes, short brown curly hair.. okay, that's 
the physical
I'll probably just be wearing jeans and one of two t-shirts, one that has 
picutres of the Mona Lisa on it ranging from "normal" to "falling down 
laughing" or...a t-shirt my friend got at the Nick bolleterri tennis 
academy in FL a couple of years back that says "Bolleterri...serving up 
tasty tennis" and has a weird pic on it of a tennis ball over a werid 
looking plate with a raquet next to it looking like a dinning utensil

also, I will likely have a stuffed animal dog with me, light blue, though 
rave/club lighting tends to make it look more creamy/off white , about a 
foot or so tall and/or a smaller slightly beat up penguin with top-hat

and another probably item on my body will be my old nametag from my old 
job at Safeway as a courtesy clerk...which will read "Michael .... 
Courtesy Clear" and in smaller print "Serving you since 1991" not sure 
why I'm wwering it..just have the sudden urge to do it

anyway, hope to see a bunch of you there and meet a bunch of new people
hope everyone has a great time

see ya there!

Subject: NON-RAVE: Room(s) for rent
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


I live in a big house (2000+ sq. ft.) on 1.3 acres in Los
Altos Hills (lucky me).  One housemate wants to move back
to SF in the next couple of months, and one is considering
going back to apartment living (they get on each other's
nerves a bit).  So, space is opening up.

Cool things:
-Techno/house OK, nearest neighbors 50-100 yards away
-Great quiet location on an actual Los Altos Hill
-Big house with musical-type guy

Bad things:
-Neat freaks will not get along with me.  Sorry.
-Hardcore earlybirds probably won't either.

Rent is $750-900/mo., depending on which room and whether
you want to park your car in the garage.

Oh- it's a 3 BR house.  Master has its own bathroom, two
others share one.  Kitchen has dishwasher.  Other rooms
include dining room, big lounge area, and HUGE rec room,
plus the Ominous Corridor (tm) and garage.  It's an older
house with wood floors and lots of built-in cabinetry but
a kind of strange floor plan (I kind of like it).  Definitely
not your standard econo-suburbo-injection-molded box.

Yard is wild land with trees and such, not lawn, so no 
gardening fees, and trash and water are paid.  It's at the
end of a dead-end: very pastoral.

Enough rambling -- mail grigsby@shell.portal.com if you're
interested.

I do not know the exact geography of this years sight because the 
organizers swear it's in a different part of the dessrt then it was last 
year but as it's on an area of dried up lake bed that is totally barren.  
it should not be to hard to spot.  Last year we were set up about 1/4 of a 
mile West of the main camp (it 
will be easy to spot).  As far as cxamping in the rave area goes we can't 
stop you but I guess we would kind of prefere it if the ravers set-up their 
own little living area slightly away from the rave scene so that  it 
looks like the actual dance floor is open for all.  Remember, there is 
lots and lots and lots of space out their so lewts use as much of it as 
is practical.  I am bringing my bike so that I can ride around all the 
different camps easily and I highly recomend other people to do the same 
(bike/roof racks are very cheap to hire).  BUt it would be exxellent if 
we all camped at the same place just outside of the rave camp so that we 
can all feel like part of the family.  I'll be setting up a camp in an 
area such as this and I sincerlly hope to see as many of you lot there as 
possible.  Anybody wanting more info on the camp or other burning man 
info should call me on 415-487-9804 or, preferably, e-mail me.I am so 
happy about the prospect of what burning man could represent that I feel 
like a little kid waking-up on Christmas morning.
SEE YER ALL AT THE PARTY OF THE YEAR.
TRISTAN.

Thank you all again for sending me the sfrave calendar, and for the
directions to the hyperreal site to get it myself.  I'm still recieving
copies of the calendar (about 60+).  My Netscape stuff is all down so I
couldn't get to it that way.  Thanks again.

How about having your e-mail address tatooed to your forhead. This would
eliminate the need for a laminator. It would be easy to see? It would also be
bibliogically correct?

     Hey all!
     
     As many of you are going to the "most creative time ever", I thought 
     I'd share with you a list that I made off the top of my head for 'our' 
     crew. As this may help you as well, I thought that the rest of the SFR 
     group may want it as well... By no means is this a 'definitive list'!

Oh, and a new EP came out Tuesday. . . have to go down to Rasputin's
today!

----------------------

Hyperreal now houses a mirror of the official Orbital Web Site.

http://hyperreal.com/music/artists/orbital/

the primary site is at

http://www.rise.co.uk/orbital/

The site in London is currently experiencing problems with its
connection.  Those of you who have visited it will appreciate the
speed of Hyperreal's connection.

The debilitating consequences of age-related brain deterioration are

potential major causes of age-related destruction of neuronal tissue is t=
oxic

free radicals that are a natural result of aerobic metabolism. The brain =

enzymatic =

metabolism. The vitamin antioxidants, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol in =

particular) and vitamin C (ascorbate), also aid in protecting the brain f=
rom =

oxidative stress by directly scavenging toxic radicals. A newly discovere=
d, =

potentially highly important antioxidant in the brain is the indole
melatonin. =

The pineal hormone melatonin is rapidly taken up by the brain. In vitro =

ABSTRACT
Three series of 2-phenyltryptamides were prepared as melatonin analogues =
to =

investigate the nature of the binding site of the melatonin receptor in
chicken =

brain and in Xenopus laevis melanophore cells. The 5-methoxy-2-
phenyltryptamides (6a-j) have high binding affinities for the chicken bra=
in =

receptor, in some cases (6a-d) greater than that for melatonin, confirmin=
g
and =

extending the work of Spadoni et al., and act as agonists in the Xenopus =

melanophore assay. Analogues lacking the 5-methoxyl group (2a-n) had a =

considerably lower affinity for the chicken brain receptor. In the Xenopu=
s =

melanophore assay the compounds acylated on nitrogen by an alkyl group (2=
a-d)

were agonists whereas the compounds acylated on nitrogen by an alicyclic
group =

(2f-i) were antagonists. Introducing a methyl group at N1 (7) led to an =

increase in binding affinity in the chicken brain assay, whereas introduc=
ing
an =

ethyl group (13) led to a decrease in binding affinity. A methyl substitu=
ent
at =

the beta-position of the 3-amidoethane side chain (8, 11) also led to an =

increase in the binding affinity. The only analogue acylated on nitrogen =
with

an alkyl group (acetyl) which showed antagonist activity was 9, which has=
 a =

beta-methoxymethyl side chain. In the absence of the 5-methoxyl group the=
 =

methoxymethyl function may cause the molecule to bind in a different =

configuration so that it is no longer able to activate the receptor. All =

these observations are in agreement with a model of melatonin at the rece=

site in which the 3-amidoethane side chain is in a conformation close to =
the
5-

Melatonin protects primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons from
kainate =

but not from N-methyl-D-aspartate excitotoxicity.

SOURCE
Exp Neurol  1995 Jan;131(1):39-46

ABSTRACT
the antiexcitotoxic efficacy of melatonin, a putative endogenous hydroxyl=
 =

radical scavenger, was studied in primary cultures of rat cerebellar gran=
ule =

neurons. Excitotoxicity was induced in 7- to 9-day-old cultures by an
exposure =

to glutamate (15 min in the absence of magnesium) or to glutamate recepto=
r =

agonists, kainate (30 min), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (60 min in the absen=
ce
of =

magnesium). Thereafter, cultures were returned to the culture-conditioned=
 =

medium for 18 h at the end of which time viability was assessed by
quantitative =

staining with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromi=
de. =

Cotreatment with melatonin (500 microM) protected the neurons completely =
from

the toxicity of kainate (up to 1 mM) and shifted the ED50 for glutamate f=
rom
55 =

+/- 2.6 to 97 +/- 3.6 microM. Melatonin cotreatment was ineffective in =

protecting the neurons from N-methyl-D-aspartate toxicity. When melatonin=
 was

added to the cultures only before or after kainate treatment, there was n=
o =

resultant protection from kainate toxicity. The neuroprotective effect of=
 =

melatonin does not appear to be related to the direct action of melatonin=
 on =

ionotropic glutamate receptors. That is, the kainate-stimulated inward
currents =

measured by a patch-clamp technique in voltage clamped neurons and the
kainate-
stimulated increase in free cytosolic calcium measured at the single-cell=

level =

using digital imaging fluorescent microscopy with fura-2 were not affecte=
d by

melatonin. Moreover, the binding of [3H]glutamate to rat cerebellar membr=
anes

was not competed off by melatonin. Further studies are needed to evaluate=
 the

pharmacologic relevance of the neuroprotective action of melatonin.

I didn't realize how much hearing from everyone meant to me until I had my
hyperreal access cut off for two days ... YIPE!  but 126 letters letter I
feel better.  Have a happy Thursday, everyone.

P.S.  There's a game called Addventure which I stumbled across while
wandering around in http://world.net/ - you creative writer folk out there
will LOVE this.  Choose Entertainment from the big picture ... that's all I
remember of how I started to get there ... I'll find the URL today and post
it.

If I remember correctly (from last year) it took about 6 hours to drive from
Sacramento, and that's about 1.5 hrs from SF so plan for 7.5 hrs.  I could
be over estimating this completely though.  It will cost i believe $35.  It
would have been $25 if you registered 2 months ago.  It's worth it.

I just can't get enough of you great people!
I found out I have this Sunday off from work, so if Sunset is going to be 
in Berkeley or Richmond, then so will I and some fellow Sacramento 
friends.

Being it's the last weekend we have together for Burning Man, maybe we 
could all get together and meet each other and talk about it.  I am so 
stoked about it!!  woowoo!! 

love,
Amy

Greetings everyone,

Just thought I'd let you know I've got a new radio show at KALX 90.7fm 
Berkeley, taking up the slack for MinorMinor on thursday nights 
(tonight!) at 9pm until midnight.  I play anything from 
ambient/experimental to acid trance techno to industrial to trip-hop, 
with a heavy emphasis on mixing.  Gotta run now- more info later...

Seth on KALX 90.7fm Berkeley
Thursdays 9pm-midnight

ps- due to the recent change of KSJS to 90.5fm, KALX can now be received 
all over the bay area!!!   :)

Heh ... that's why they do it ... so that by the time you've actually
GOTTEN there, you're at the point of "Oh well, now I'm here, I may as well
pay for it".

I try never to go to anything which has no price listed on the flyers or
the infoline, and buy my tix in advance whenever possible, it saves money,
at least here in the Great Wet North ...

Last $20 party I went to was worth maybe $10 (if that), and the last $10
gig I saw (Sven Vath) was worth about $200!!!

I was just wondering if there is going to be a Sunset this Sunday, and, if
so, if someone could please send me the number.  I haven't been to one in a
while and I'd like to go.

Thanks, 

Jake

Dear All;

	According to Dave the Sysop hear at Liberty, Spritnet among 
other corporate Internet Backbone companies are responsible for the 
problems. I feel that if the Internet haddn't been turn over to Corporate 
America, and it was still in the trusted hands of the NSF Nation Science 
Foundation, that these problem wouldn't be occuring. I strongly encourage 
people to use the AWESOME POWER THEY HAVE AT THEIR TERMINAL, THE POWER TO 
PUBLISH, AND GIVE THE CORPORATE SLACKERS HELL. JUST MY 2 CENTS. Perhaphs 
they need a massage to fix the bad backbone :)

	"Freedom of the press is only available to those who own one"

	You own one so what are you waiting for!!!!!!!!!

Hey buddy, I think it's gonna be the new moon, if you don't mind the drive.

[ To SFRaves mailist - I thought I had sent this out last night , but
  it hasn't shown up , so here it is again , with some more info. ]

 Thanks to all the folks that answered my inquiry about Internet service
providers. Here's a summary of the replies:

ba.internet: Folks recommended I check out this newsgroup. It is supposed 
   to have a weekly listing of S.F. Bay area Internet access providers ,
   and also has posts from folks who are customers of local access 
   providers.

Other sources of information about local access: "Cyberspace Today" , a
SF monthly newsprint tabloid. A magazine called "The Net" had a list of
415 area code providers. "Computer Currents" monthly newsprint tabloid
is supposed to have a Web page that has information about access 
providers.

Work-around - TIA : The SLIP emulator TIA was recommended by some other
 folks on my present provider ( NETCOM ). 

Recommended Internet Access Providers:
[ In 408 area code or with 408 dial-up numbers , or nearby 415 area code ]
best.com - recommended by some , but panned by a lot of folks too.
crl.com 
aimnet.com
the WELL


 Thanks again for the information!

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

I've seen a couple of post about this here and I feel maybe I may be of
assistance.

I recently (past 4 months of my life) have felt a complete increase in
self awareness and self worth. Stagnancy in not in my vocabulary. I'm
comepletely happy with myself and the choices I'm making.

Here are some simple things all of you can do on a daily basis to feel
better:


1) Doing the minimum is never good enough. Do at least one thing a day
that improves your life.

2) Challenge yourself! Find something you would like to do but can't,
   AND DO IT!!!!!!!!!

3) Give yourselfg a mental hug everyday. If you can't love yourself then
   how do you expe t to love others.

4) last but def. not least. Pet your cat on a daily basis!!


Love you all,

Andrew

The holes-in-head group is covered well in "Eccentric Lives and
Peculiar Notions," as well as in Donna Kossy[sp?]'s "Kooks," both
of which may be considered as a field guide to unimaginative
SubGenius thought patterns.

Ah yes, reminds me of the first time I trepanned myself.  The trick is use
the proper equipment.  I tried  hand-cranked tools, electric drills, power
sanders, concentrated sulphuric acid, and half-starved rodents.  I finally
lit on the idea of using a dab of construction adhesive to hold an M-80 in
place while the fuse burns down.  The hole is not as neat as can be
obtained by other means, and it is a bit messy, but the time saved is well
worth it.  I've helped a number of friends and pets reach enlightenment
using this method, although for first-timers, I'd still recomend the
pilgrimage to Dobbstown for an official third-nostril "opening".

I'm the guy who a couple of years ago originally typed in that essay about 
trepanation, so I feel kind of guilty when it shows up without the right 
attribution.  To make me feel a little better could everyone please note that
that essay is a slightly edited version of a chapter from _Eccentric Lives and
Peculiar Notions_ by John Michell.  Rush out and buy it, it's full of neat-o
stuff like that (although that chapter is, by far, the most gory).

are a captive audience WHOM I CAN BLUDGEON WITH SENSLESS RANTS ANY TIME I

Actually, given that it's brand-spankin'-new, I figgered I'd let you folks

as we all know, is really a guy living in a trailer somewhere just south of
Milwaukee.  (Didn't somebody post something 'bout that a while back?)

Hi...  Still no luck in scarfing a ride to Narnia.   Thought I would ask
again,  in the hopes that someone might change their mind at the last minute.

So,  if anyone is going,  and has room in their car,   please let me know.

well, since
 I go to school there I can tell you that there is no scene!
If your into the bar scene there is a few cool places but I haven't 
really checked it out cuz I'm only nineteen. There is one club called the 
"Graduate" that is supposed to be 18 and older.  you might try it out. I 
think thet ocaisionally have alternative music nights.  I know some acid 
house dj's that are trying to put some parties together down there but 
have only had minimul success at atrracting the ravy type crowd.  Mostly 
hip-hopers suport the dance scene there.  The parties are far and few in slo.
But i happen to meet a few ravers down there last year and we know more 
of us are out there its just hard to find em and bring em all together!
Too bad you couldn't make it down for one of our private parties during 
the school year. They rock! Its really funny walking around SLO and being in 
an environment were people have on clue  or don't care that there are other 
ways to celebrate life than keg parties!
take care,
hugs n stuff

Thought you'd all be interested to see the posts we've been 
receiving at So-Cal Raves.  From many reliable sources, they 
say that Narnia is cancelled.  I would check before you all 
head down here to San Diego!

Teena


Just got off the phone with Jason at the G.U.N. office.... 
apparantly the
other poster was right...seems the guy they supposedly rented 
the location
from is being looked for by the FBI.  The sherriffs have 
revoked Narnia's
permits as well.
I don't know why Jason told me before that it wasn't going to 
be cancelled,
but basically this sucks in more ways than one.  All of my 
money is tied up
in tapes, and I can't pay the rent now.  Plus, they have my 
money that I paid
for my booth.
I was told that Narnia was going to be moved to a later date.

Recent posts on SoCal-Raves say that Narnia has been cancelled (or at
least, postponed).  The promoters rented the location from someone
they now know was not the owner, and is currently nowhere to be found.

This was how I woke today (at 2pm so at least it wasn't all bad).

ME: Hello? (very shaky morning/just woke up voice)
Friend: Hey man, I have some bad news...
ME: What?
Friend: They "postponed" Narnia.
ME: No way!
Friend: Yeah they had site problems and said they are gonna try to
	reshcedule it for three weeks from now!
ME: That can't be true.  Who did you hear it from? (realize that I just
       woke up and I am not an morning...err...afternoon person)
Friend: Well I just got off the phone with Man from Mars and that's what 
	said. 

(BTW, when I say list in the following part I mean socal-raves, I need to 
clarify that since this message is also being sent out to all my friends 
up at SF...hi!).

Well I said my goodbye's and then hung up.  This happened BEFORE I read 
anything on the list (and I my friend I don't think is on the list 
anymore).  I then logged on and saw all you guys talking...it must be 
true....ahhhhhh!!!!  This REALLY sucks.  I mean REALLY REALLY REALLY 
sucks!!!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!  

Like I said, my friend said it will be in three weeks.   He also had an 
idea that this may be a ploy on their part to get some of the 
non-raver types out of it.  Afterall the raver types will call the info 
lines but the non raver types may not.  I wouldn't put it past GUN at 
this point.  I'll try to keep you all informed.

What food do you like to eat when you take ecstacy?   We're building a super chill space at Narnia tomorrow night and we're going to be giving out lots of free food.  I know from my own experience that you aren't really too hungry when you take e but since the event will be going on for 31 hours we want there to be nourishment for people that need it.  We're going to buy food in the morning so any suggestions anyone has would be greatly appreciated!!

I've been asking around and here are the suggestions so far:
Watermelon
Super ripe and juicy peaches
Oranges
Bubble Gum

If anyone else from the sfraves crew are going please come by and say hello!  We've got a 32' geodesic dome, and 45 sq foot carpeted area where you can lay on your back and look at the stars (you have to check your shoes first) - all music will be ambient acoustic - live african drummers, sitar and digideroo players plus food, water and tons of other stuff.
And if you're not going to Narnia, see you at Burning Man ...

        Reply to:   RE>Narnia apparently cancelled

I talked to the executive producer of Narnia this morning.  It's true they lost their space but they say they now have a new space and that Narnia will go on as planned.

Recent posts on SoCal-Raves say that Narnia has been cancelled (or at
least, postponed).  The promoters rented the location from someone
they now know was not the owner, and is currently nowhere to be found.

"People need people. Not only for the practical benefits which derive 
from group life, but for our very health and survival. Somehow 
interaction with the larger social world of others draws our attention 
out of ourselves, enlarges our focus, enhances our ability to cope, and 
seems to make the brain's reactions more stable and the person less 
vulnerable to disease"

My friend lost his purple Jansport backpack at the last sunset party in Santa
Cruz.  If you found it or picked it up, please write me back, or bring it to
sunset this weekend.  Try and find me, my name is Matt, probably wearing
either a grover t-shirt, or a blue hook-ups t-shirt.  

thanks and lots of love,

	Howdy!  I'm checking back in after being out of town for a week and
it looks like quite a bit of discussion has happened about the article in 
the Chron.  From a quick literature search, it looks like this guy Ricaurte
has done quite a bit of research on MDMA's effects on various aspects of
human behavior (sleep, memory) in addition to its neurotoxicity in humans.
I'll be running to the library at some point tomorrow to pull a few of his
papers, and I'll post a quick summary of the details.  The lack of dosage
info in the article bothers me too...  From the titles of his papers, it
looks like he's been at this for a while and has a grip on the problem, 
unlike a lot of papers I've seen on the stuff which feature abnormally high
doses in animals.

take care,

steve

There have been few changes in the line-up at 1015 on Friday
nights.  Upon my return from Scotland I learned that I am 
no longer playing at 1015 and Mark is no longer promoting the 
night.  I would appreciate it if the listing could be changed on the 
calander.

hi all!

last night gregg, p. and I jetted up to a little town in the high sierras 
for a rave.

it was a party put on by the light family movement, also known as gateway 
systems, plus some other folks, as well.  including the new moon!

we left the east bay around 11 and arrived in the little ghost town-also 
known as forest city- around 2:30 in the morning.  when we arrived, we 
were instructed at the entrance of the town to steer clear of a house 
with a big green alligator cross on it because some white supremecists 
lived there.  "they have more guns than we do, probably," we were told.  
"just don't bother them and they won't bother us."  well, okay.

with great excitement we walked up the road to the new moon ambient 
saloon.  the saloon was kind of a historic site as it once was the most 
important building in the town in its glory days.

inside we found some new moon folks putting together what would later 
become perhaps the most beautiful new moon altar to date.  some ambient 
tunes were playing and various folks were dancing and talking.  a few 
people were already sacked out in sleeping bags on the floor.  the party 
had been going on for quite some time and already people were getting a 
little worn out.  but it made for a very mellow, very warm ambient 
experience.

then we walked up the road some more...past the aforementioned white 
supremacist house...(which was quiet)...to a meadow that the organizers 
had spent all day clearing and setting up the system.  cyril was 
spinning as we arrived.  there was a firepit and lots of tents, plus some 
people dancing in front of the dj.  after plugging in the trusty DAT 
recorder, we mingled and chatted and danced some.

then we went back to the ambient saloon.  along the way someone told us 
that some white supremacist guys had been bugging some people over by the 
firepit and pissed off some kids, who left.  this was bumming people 
out as we felt we should have tried harder to convince the kids that left 
to stay instead.  i felt especially bad for the organizers who had worked 
so hard on this party and now had to deal with this awful blotch on their 
otherwise perfect evening.  and i also felt sorry for the kids who left, 
after having driven all the way there and then having to put up with 
insults and bad energy.  such are the risks you run when you have a party 
in a new location, in a place where anyone at all can show up.

i made the best of the situation and tried to enjoy myself anyway, 
despite feeling bummed.  the music all night long was very enjoyable.  i 
especially liked a set that Phil Smart (from Australia) did.  it got me 
up and dancing.  later i on, i got to hear dj stonie and his just-right
deep house set.  

as i was listening to phil smart's set, i saw a guy with very short hair 
walking  circles around the dance-area.  he looked like he was 
possessed by some restless spirit as he circled the dancers several times.
this was a ghost town, after all, and you never know what might happen.  
then i realized  he was one of the white supremacist guys.  then i saw 
him talking to a friend of mine, a young woman, and i went up to them and 
suggested we walk back to the ambient saloon.  i asked him if he was the 
white supremacist guy.  this question surprised him a little, but he said 
yes.  his name was greg and he'd come up there a little early for 
a meeting his group was having the next day in this little town.  the 
weirdness of such a thing happening after a rave!

when we got back to the ambient saloon, i suggested we and another 
friend, who is chinese-american, sit at a table and talk about our 
respective "movements," the white supremacist movement and the house 
movement.  we sat and talked for about an hour.  greg had some trouble 
collecting his thoughts as he was very tired and had been drinking, but 
we managed to have a passable conversation.  even though his movement 
preaches separation of the races and other things i don't really 
understand or approve of, greg himself was actually very nice to us both, 
even though we were "mixing the races" by hanging out together.  he told 
us he had been a punker down in L.A. and had done a lot of drugs there.  
he basically seemed like he was completely cut off from mainstream 
culture.  it seemed to me we had similar complaints about the media 
distorting our respective groups.  he thought that was because of the 
media being controlled by the jews. my raver friend and i had no theory 
we believed in so strongly to explain the media's habitual distortions 
concerning the rave community.  his own group is despised by most 
people.  our group tries hard to keep out of the public consciousness, 
but when stories do get told about us in the media, they seem always to 
focus on the negative-such as lurid drug tales and kids staying out all 
night and getting into trouble.  so i guess to a lot of people, we are 
both classified as low-lifes.

then we all walked back to the meadow where phil smart's set was going 
strong.  greg started to enjoy himself a little more.  the restless 
spirit that had taken him over earlier appeared to have departed.

i asked him if out of all the drugs he'd done, if he'd ever tried E.  he 
said no and that he wasn't interested in trying it.  i told him i thought 
he should because it would give a fresh perspective on things. strange
as it may seem, underneath all the rhetoric, he seemed like the kind of 
person who would benefit from such an experience, since in my 
conversation with him he was good at responding to nonverbal cues.  this 
to me  means someone is receptive to other people, and it is this 
receptiveness that gets enhanced when you take E.

well, it just goes to show you that you can meet all kinds of people at a 
rave. i hope no-one will think badly of me for talking to this guy.  
mostly, i was curious to see what kind of a person might have such 
beliefs.  i really don't know more now than i did before i talked to 
him.  but maybe some of the things we said made an impression.  at the 
very least, i think he started to enjoy himself a little more after we 
talked.  the first step for becoming a raver is to have fun at a rave, i 
figured.  the fact that he was there at all, and stayed all night, means 
there's hope.  part of being a raver for me is learning to see the beauty 
in all people.  so maybe if he learned to do that, he would let go of 
whatever it is that makes him want to cut himself off from people that 
aren't white.  the rhetoric of anti-race-mixing and all that other stuff 
i realized was the very same restless, angry and disquieted spirit that i 
saw him grappling with during phil smart's set.  i don't underestimate 
the power of this destructive spirit to hurt its host and others.  
perhaps we of the house community should work a little harder to diminish 
this spirit's power.  love is the only way, i think.

all in all this was a very good party.  the people that put it on 
worked very hard so that all of us could have a good time.  Thank you!  
And good luck with all your future projects!

love,

ann

Individual fires are allowed but not in the main encampment circle, just 
on the outskirts.  BUt you'll have to bring your own wood because there's 
fuck all out their.
And, while stating the obvious, EVERYONE must bring ONE GALLEN OF WATER 
each day.  So if you are planning to stay for five day's that's five 
gallens per person.  REMEMBER: EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT THIRSTY YOU MUST STILL 
DRINK A PINT OF WATER AN HOUR WITHOUT FAIL!  And also, burning man is out 
there, really out their; you can't pop off to the shops to be back in a 
few hours so bring what think is way to much ( like toilet paper) and add 
two to it.  Only six more day's to go!

Dear All;

	I try(an going process) and look for similarites in people with
regard to our respective belief systems, and with reagrd to the
Neo_Nazi's.  What I came up with is: we both like fruit loops, we both
love our child, and that our beliefs systems, will proablly lead to the death
of both of US.

Narnia is a perfect example of a scam that has been going on in Uk and 
Europe for years.  It is this: say your going to be having a massive 
party at a secret location  and say that one must have there ticket in 
advance to go.  Because you have not dealt with a ticket agency but 
dierectly with thhe promotoors themselves (which is, incidently, illegal) 
you buy the ticket with no garuntee from them that you will go to the 
show or 
get a refund.  Thus if one sells a thousand tickets at $20 a pop thats 
$20,000.  A nice little earner for the few promotoirs, if you know what I 
mean.  "It's food for thought, mobsters."

I asked Ron D Core how he dealt with advance ticket sales from his 
store in LA and he gave me good advice: Don't give the promoters 
their money until after the party.

We are going to try to follow this rule in the future.

I also think thats true.   Which is a bummer....   Does anyone know
of any other outdoor parties?

PS:  Cyberlab - 7 party last night was the shits....  It WENT OFF,
but around 5:30 the pigs made them turn down the music,   so "Out
went all that awsome energy"

I have some information on the prevention of MDMA neurotoxicity using 
fenfluramine, and also some possibly partial bullshit (it was in the 
newspaper and is therefore suspect information) about the nature and 
manifestation of said damage on nerve cell axons. Also some background 
info on MDMA if you're interested... it was NOT invented by illicit 
chemists in the 1980's who were looking for a "stronger, technically 
legal form of methamphetamine"... which is what the news article claims...

I don't wish to dump a lot of unwanted info on sfr heads, so contact me 
via email while I put some articles together for ya'.

Dis Post Contains 2 Countem Two Posts, For The Bandwdith Of One

/The Weekend of the Private Parties

Dear All;


	It seems that this weekend was one of those weekends that it was 
who ya know, rather than who you are. I have a lot of problems with this 
rave philosopy, but private parties are still my P favorite.
 
	Unfortuately there needs to be a way to limit parties due to the
number of ravers in San Francisco. I will proabbly annoy Bgroovey will
this post, not my intention, but I feel that Rave Kultur at least in the
early days was elitest, in a lot of ways. In always seemed like it was who
ya knew, rather than who you are, especially in most allof  the major club 
scenes eg New York, London.

	But there were penty o killer events out there, last night to make
up for killer private parties, and my only advice to people who feel that
they were left out is, and I'm gonna quote AA/NA of all sources, cause I'm
the AA/NA Satan, "keep comin back", of god don't ya just love it!!!!!.
Cause hon's, sooner or later, someone will see just how much you shine, and
invite you to one of those closed events, cause we ALL FUCKIN SHINE!!!!!!,
something however, you will never hear in AA/NA. 

/Rave Suicide

	Sometime this weekend one of the members of a band, who are 
considered by many; including myself, to be one of the founding fathers of 
the electronic groove, attemted to commit suicide, by slashing his wrist, 
the band is Depeche Mode, the members name I uncertain of, please add 
details to this story, thanks. I quess it just goes to show you, flame & 
forture won't buy you love, peace or happiness.

Dear All;

	Bloody sick as hell of all dis new age; hmmmmm how should I put it,
crap!!! 

	If your stuck in a rut, maybe it's cause you're taking advice from
others rather than listening to your own heart & your own dream. That
little voice inside you that keeps telling what to do & where to go. Don't
read about how other people did things, you just recycleing stuff that's
not your own. Think for youself, be yourself, love yourself, don't sit at
home reading how some other clueless fucker made their life work. There 
is no manual on life; at least I didn't get one, were all just as 
clueless as the next, or just as insightful.

	The extent of my literialy knowledge you could fit on the head of
a pin. I'm a self made modern day, 100% pure ME, filled with nothing but
my own thoughts, ideas, feelings, belief systems, perceptions, &
perspectives, not someone elses. 

	Educate yourself and use that knowledge to defend youself from the
people in the world the will tell you how to be, who to be, who to love,
who to hang around with, what to do, what to think, what to believe
....ETC. Lead by example and people will if not follow, at least support you.

	Find yourself, whether it be in a drug, in a book, on the top of a
mountain from some beggar, or just by looking inside yourself and
listening to that voice inside yourself. Love yourself, and people will
love you, they will see that light, that light that they see inside
themselves, and love. Cause when it comes to YOU, you are the only person
who knows whats best for you, and I dare anyone to challenge that concept.

Well I didn't go to Friction I went to Flowerchild and I x'd for the first
time. I totally couldn't handle it and I freaked out, I was having a horrible
trip, I thought I was going to die......some girl just came up to me and gave
me a hug and BOOM!!!! I totally changed I just felt this enourmous glow,
warmth, LOVE, I went up to everyone I saw and just hugged them, her name was
KRISTI and she gave me my first E hug.... KRISTI...I love you!! BTW the rave
was real overcrowded, I heard they passed out a quarter of a million fliers,
but were only going to let 1000 people... Well that didn't happen!!! Great
rave!!

i think that's great you talked to the supremist dude - the worst thing
to do is not to exchange ideas and opinions with people whose views differ
from yours.  after all, how are they to ever going to change their opinion
if no one challenges their ideas ?  plus, it's bad practise to assume
what you believe is beyond refute and infallible.  

hey - with your trusty DAT, you can record live raves ?  that sounds
awesome !  are the recordings any good ?

well, not sure if this is important or not, but i found out why sunset 
didnt happen, for those that didnt know. if this has already been posted, 
then sorry, and please ignore.


I went to the state fair today in sacto. and i went to the Technologica 
exhibit and ther were people from some college up there running a booth 
for Netcom. i was talking to one of the guys, and we got into a 
discussion about raves for some strange reason. he asked me if i heard of 
Sunset. "yup."  he said that he knows one of the people that produce it, 
and the guy had to drive his sister to some state above us...so, he wasnt 
in town...probably will be back in town next weekend? so.....if that 
helps any...dunnooo
take care

of everyone there, at least the people I spoke to.The Promoters kept 
everything running smoothly. I have not been to a rave for a few 
months because many people in my eyes, were in the scene for the 
wrong reasons.
       This past weekend I saw and felt what the scene is supposed to 
be. I'd like to thank all the were responsible for the party, and all

Well I had a great time at Progress on Saturday night.  It was at a
warehouse on Mission...not huge, but big enough for an good intimate party.
I spent all but about 5 minutes in the chill room, which was great because
it was on the first floor and was really good sized, and the dance floor for
the main room was on the third floor so there was no bleed through of BOOM
BOOM BOOM during any of the ambient music.  My frinds Dave, Kevin, and Brad
from Consciousness Lab Ambient Sound Research had invited me to SF to
perform live with them at free show in the park on Saturday afternoon (which
went really well), then they invited me to play live and spin some records
in the ambient room at Progress as well.  This was my first SF party. :)
The vibe in the chill space was so great all night.  So many wonderful
people came up and complemented us on the music (live as well as vinyl and
cd)  I was especially moved by Kevins set which consisted of mostly FAX
stuff that he played on his cd mixer.  Incredible music! It was soooooo fun
playing live there.  Most of it was improv. and turned out really really
well.  I played my digeridoo and hand drum - with heavy delay and other
effects, and some patterns from my drum machine, along with C-Lab's plethera
of music making devises.

My brief journey to the third floor was really cool as well.  As I was
coming up the stairs the music had broken down and was building with a nice
snare drum role.  I got up to the floor and it was still building...everyone
was kinda swaying back and forth and feeling the build.  Then as it peaked
and some wicked beat came in the whole crowd just flailed and bounced and
bugged out all over the place.  It was reall cool, and I wished I had got
there five minutes earlier so I could have been a part of it.  It was also
really great to see a large group of my friends bugging out together at this
time too.  Then it was a quick hug and kiss from Phelps (my girlfriend), and
back to the ambient room for my second dj set (which ended up turning into
this live improv with this flute player that showed up....fun fun fun all
night). 

The only problems I noted were that the main bathroom was broken for about
half the night, but was somehow fixed later.  There was also a fight way at
the end which really disturbed me, and I'm sorry for sharing it, but I
really hate violence and like I said it bothered me.

So there you go...My first Progress Party, my first show in SF...and
although reports on Progress parties haven't been all that great, I had a
very good first impression and a wonderful time.

OK,  I aquired a station wagon for Burning man.    I have room for 3 or
4 people to ride with me and share the gas expenses.   I want at least
two people with valid drivers licenses to share the driving.   The ride
takes 8 hours (including the usual stops for gas, toilet,  food,  whatever).

Ideally,  I want to leave late Wed evening to drive through the night and
arrive early AM in Gerlach,  then out to the Playa.

I've seen numerious postings in SFRaves from many people who want to go,
and need rides.   Please RSVP via Email or phone (415) 381-5847 in the
evening.

Don't forget!!   Bring at least 5 gals of water per person (for 5 days)
a tent (or share one),  and a tarp would also come in handy to lay down
on the desert to prevent getting everything dusty.    I should have plenty
of room for baggage and water.

I went to San Diego despite the fact that Narnia was cancelled. Apparently
the cancellation of the event was on the news and it was on the
front page of the San Diego paper. According to the newspaper, the 
promoters did have all the permits, rented the equiptment, etc. While 
they were setting up, they were told to get off the property by the owner,
who lives up in Washington state. The owner of the land did not know 
anything about the party was surprised to find out that this was going on 
without his knowledge. And told the police to arrest anyone who 
trespassed on his property. The promoters thought they were dealing with a
"part-owner" of the property and gave the supposed property owner $3000 
up front and the other have after the event. They were dealing with a 
con-artist. The FBI is now is looking for the guy now. 

Another party happended that night an hour east of San Diego in the
desert. It reminded me of a Full Moon rave, minus the moon. They were 
about 500-600 people there under the stars. I must admit looking at the 
stars was a big bonus. I must have saw a dozen shooting stars. 
Unfortuately there wasn't an ambient area, since the truck ran out of gas 
getting there *doh*. 


Even though we didn't set up the Geodesic Dome, I had a really great time 
thanks to my travelling partners: Bart, Jonathan, Miho, David, Paula and 
Anna(SD). 

Cindy

ps. Is there another outdoor party that anyone can use a 32" Geodesic Dome?

I'm wondering too.  Did it happen?  I called the info number around 9:30 pm
and the same message that was there late in the afternoon was still being
played... that their locations fell through and they were going
"underground" with a map-point and all and it was going to be outside and
to call back later that evening for more information.  Did they get a new
message up after 9:30 pm?

Just curious too...

The Burning Man festival is not free, that is true, it does cost $35.  
BUt we are tottally seperate from the main festival and the rave camp IS 
free and as it is in a flat barren 200 square mile area there's lot a 
lot they can do about it is their?  But people should pay, not because 
they have to but because they want to because it is expensive and all 
and your money will be going to a good cause.

Yeah, that's another angle of the scam that does not really come into 
play in Europe because of the squatting laws over their but I can see 
how, especially with the US laws on tresspassing, how this side of the 
scam could work as well.  But to not talk to all the owners of the land 
was rather silly and nieve.  Better luck next time is what I say.  One 
livces and learns or dies and burns.  We used to have festivvals like 
this in England but what we would do is hit people up for money as they 
were leaving at the end of the party rather then weeks in advance.  This 
way poeple could not complain about paying because they had already been 
to a great party and couold not vomplain.  This also makes the 
promotors/dj's work harder because they know that success depends on them 
and not on the punters.  But something like that is more difficult to 
pull off here then in Europe.  See you all Burning Man!

Yes but In order to get to the rave camp you need to go to the mappoint 
run by the burning man folks, it is really silly to try and circumnavigate
this, not to mention anti social.  The fees for burning man ONLY cover
the cost and if their luck provide seed money for next year's event.
Before you complain about the cost, stop and think how much it must
cost to for the insurance and for the medivac helicopter that is on stand-by
24 hours a day for the 5 days, I don't know about you but I feel a little
more relieved that htese guys are responsible and have RESOURCES
(which in this capitalist world of ours) requires money.

FYI.  I'd plan on forking over the $35.  I went last year, and after you
leave the main hwy you follow small black flags for a couple of mile to the
base camp (which consisted of a small trailer and radio transmitter). You
pay or give them your tickets there.  Then the person working the base camp
says "OK, go that way (points in some direction) for 10 miles, turn right
and go 5 miles and you sould see it."  There are no roads out there and no
signs.  If you don't know exactly where it is, you probably won't find it.
Good luck if you try.

I agree with Rick.  This party was great.  I stayed on the third floor most of
the
night and the music was really cool.  A totally un-orchestrated evening
unfolded.
Where a large group of friends and acquaintances showed up and it was
surprise hugs and kisses all evening.  The crowd tended to be a bit young and
a little on the tense side, but for the most part very smiley and fun.

BTW, the bathroom was fixed midway through the evening by yours truly, of
course it was a bit difficult with my eyes jittering and me constantly telling
the toilet that I loved it :-)'

Also bear in mind that this year, many areas of the playa is under water or
still damp, this means that you WILL GET STUCK, which is very uncool, you will
have to be towed, which STARTS at $100 cash and the tow has to come from
gurlatch, It is really dangerous to try to find the camp without the
proper directions, You could really get in trouble, especially driving at
night.

Also, around the edge of the playa there is alot of soft spots that can
muc up a vehical pretty good (even a four wheel drive.)  It happens every
year, and stuck in the mud in the middle of the desert not knowing which
way to go for help is not much fun.

Oh yea, don't even try to find it (even the base camp) at night.  The marker
to turn off into the desert was a small (like about 10 inches square) black
flag on a 6 foot pole.  And the markers to get to the base camp are spaced
every 1/8 th or 1/4 mile so you would never find them at night.  Again, good
luck if you try.

     I'm not sure where people get their information about Burning Man and 
     the rave camp but my understanding from what was mailed to me from 
     Burning Man is that the Rave Camp is part of the event/attraction(s).  
     Yes, it will be separate from the main camp but it is still part of 
     the festival.  Thus paying the $35 helps support the festival, 
     contributes towards the chemical pit toilets, the first aid, the 
     responsibility of contracting with the Bureau of Land Management for 
     use/abuse of the desert, etc., as well as it gets you a map to the 
     festival.
     
     If we were confident enough in our own abilities to host a free rave 
     festival that would be a different story, but right now we are sharing 
     resources in the spirit of the Burning Man as well as relying on 
     their/our resources to create this interactive event.
     
     "Burning Man is entirely supported by paticipant contributions.  Bear 
     this in mind:  there is no "they".  They have never funded us, nor 
     will they pick up garbage off the desert floor...construct our camp, 
     provide electricity, or help publish and mail the newsletter...Only 
     when they become "us" does anyone contribute."  (Taken from the 
     Burning Man Newsletter)
     
     I realize that $35 is steep for some people but when you think about 
     what you spend on admission to some raves, as well as the "flavors" we 
     purchase at/for raves and compare this to $35/5 days, $7 per day 
     doesn't seem like that much for what we'll be getting in return.
     
     I hope those of you who haven't registered and plan to attend take 
     this into consideration.  And in the future, if you plan ahead early 
     enough you can pay $25 for the event.
     
     See you at the rave camp!

FYI.  I'd plan on forking over the $35.  I went last year, and after you 
leave the main hwy you follow small black flags for a couple of mile to the 
base camp (which consisted of a small trailer and radio transmitter). You 
pay or give them your tickets there.  Then the person working the base camp 
says "OK, go that way (points in some direction) for 10 miles, turn right 
and go 5 miles and you sould see it."  There are no roads out there and no 
signs.  If you don't know exactly where it is, you probably won't find it. 
Good luck if you try.

It's in the Nevada Black Rock Desert. This is about 100 miles north of
Reno, Nevada.

<< check out http://www.aeropac.org/aeropac/blackrock.html >> for more...


>From Reno: Take Interstate 80 East from Reno, about 30 miles from Reno take
the "Wadsworth"/"Pryamid Lake" exit, the last cheap gas is available at the
I80 truckstop
at this exit. Take highway 447 north (it's about 75 miles from the freeway
to Gerlach), as you approach the town of Nixon don't take the Pyramid lake
exit, instead drive
through Nixon and continue north to Gerlach, about 5 miles before you get
to Gerlach you will pass through the company town of Empire - the store by
the road here is
the only thing locally that can be considered a supermarket - stop on your
way through to buy ice (and lettuce if you forgot your wadding). Gerlach
itself has a number
of bars and a gas station, most of which also sell ice. Be carefull about
your speed going through all these little towns

>From California: Take I80 East from the Bay Area through Sacramento to
Reno, follow the directions above. Some people from the north (or Oregon)
take CA 299 from
Alturas to NV 447 to Gerlach - I haven't done it so I can't recommend it myself

Hi fellow SFRavers,

As Wayne's sidekick and boy-wonder, I have finished up a small first batch
of SFRaves laminates that I will take with me to the Burning Man. If you
think you will be going send me a note so I can get an idea how many of my
SFRave friends will be there, I have about 40 of the laminates done so far.
If it looks like I need more, I can try and bang out some more before I
leave on Fri.

I'll be the one with a neck full of laminates :)====
I'm 5'6" beard and moustach and Long Dreads !!
Wayne on the other hand is tall (6'6") and has red/brown hair w/ a pony tail.

I'm sure there'll be plenty of people who opt for this option.  The problem
still exists of getting lost, or at least bringing down the vibe of the
whole event.

Why would people wanna rick their lives, just to "get over" on someone, to
go to a free party?  I despise freeloaders....

So I guess the credo is, follow @ your own risk.....

Or, as I have told people who wanted guest list, but don't do whats required:
'Don't EVER go to a party you are NOT prepared to pay for!, Stay home if
you can't afford to go out!'

Peace,
John

I did not say burning man was free, I said the rave camp was free.  As I 
said in my previous post nobody at the man is going to be standing over 
you with a big club demanding money but it is not free to put on the $35 
only barly covers the expenses.  So one should pay.

Try calling (415) 985-7471.  But I can't guarentee anything.  The people
organizing it may already be out there.

Simply amazing...He spun unreleased FAX stuff that was totally incredible.
He played about a two hour set with about 3 records, 1 microphone, and about
7 cd's.  One of the highlights was Vexelspang II (sp).  This track just blew
me away.  Wicked intellegent dance with an extremely complex structure.  It
was like I wanted to get up and dance, but it was all I could do to sit
there and listen as carefully as I could to atempt to understand.  It
changed the way I look at music I'll say that much.

I'd be interested in going for just the weekend if I could get a ride 
from Reno or SF. 

By way of introductions, I'm Sarah from NYC, freelance writer and an 
editor at High Times Magazine. But I'd be venturing to BM for personal 
pleasure/enlightenment only. 

I could contribute gas money, great company, good mix tapes, etc.

Also, some friends of mine, Keith and Stephanie, will be doing fire 
performance at BM, and are looking for gigs afterwards in the SF and LA 
area. They are truly amazing fire eaters--erotic, fun, awe-inspiring--and 
all around great people. Keith works with the Autonomedia Collective 
(publisher of T.A.Z., etc.)
If anybody knows of any clubs/connections that could help them, please 
email me at sferg@echonyc.com or phone (212)387-7366.

Many thanx.

Is anyone going out Friday night? I'm hoping to fly in from New 
York--either to SF or Reno--and I could really use a ride. I can provide 
gas $, good vibes, mix tapes, etc. 

I can be reached at sferg@echonyc.com or by phone (212)505-3246. 

Muchos Gracias!

Hello Ravers
My good friends Keith and Stephanie will be doing fire performance at 
Burning Man, and they're looking for gigs in the SF and LA area 
afterwards. Their performance is wicked--erotic, fun, and 
awe-inspiring--but they're totally broke and could use some gigs to get 
by on the west coast. 
Keith works with Hakim Bey and the autonomedia collective (publisher of 
T.A.Z.) 
You can email me at sferg@echonyc.com or Keith and Steph can be reached 
by their New York voicemail. (212)726-1935.

Hope this isn't considered a "commercialization" of the site. By way of 
intro's, I'm Sarah from NYC, a senior editor at High Times and freelance 
writer. I met Crunchman and the SPAZ crew last summer when I was out west 
covering those screwy Zippies. I mostly lurk around the site cause I'm 
not in SF. But I'm hoping to make it to Burning Man.

thanx!

It was pretty incredible...everything he played just rocked.  I liked the 
faster stuff he played more, as it was this weird fusion of many styles 
of music (dub/jungle/ambient/whatever).  Check him out if you ever get 
the chance.

Hmmmm....Certainly a fair representation of the scene, eh?

Sarah, maybe you could wear something/do something unique in order to meet
more of "us."  Or better, when you hang out at the rave community, just
start hugging people for no reason.  That's how I got hooked...

Peace in the desert!

        B u r n i n g M a n F e s t i v a l

                 Thursday, August 31 through Monday, September 4, 1995


To aid you in your relentless quest for the latest news, not yet expired
from its media-driven
ever-shortening half-life, I offer you this synopsis of the latest changes
to this site, of the latest
news on the festival front, the latest plans, dreams, hopes and aspirations.

       Latest Changes to This Site:


              Directions to Gerlach are now available.
              What's the weather in the desert now?
              What will I find in Central Camp?
              What the heck is a dry lake anyway, and what can I expect
driving there?



       New Announcements:


       Ride Share to Burning Man!
              The Burning Man Project is proud to announce the Burning Man
Festival
              RideShare Info line. Call (415)985-7152 to help yourself or
someone you don't
              yet know get to the festival. Leave your name, number, where
you are leaving
              from, when you are leaving, and of course, whether your
offering or looking and
              our crack team of transportation professionals will pair you
up with the ride/rider
              of your dreams.

       Take the Stage Coach from Reno to Gerlach
              Once a day, the Gerlach Stage Coach leaves Reno for the
gateway to the Black
              Rock Desert. Shane, your driver, is available to ferry both
you and your
              equipment to downtown Gerlach for a benevolent price. Call to
arrange pickup
              times. (707)331-5181.

       Didn't get your Registration Materials Yet?
              The Burning Man Project doesn't want you to waste away,
sweating and fretting
              over the arrival of your registration materials. If you are
at all worried about the
              arrival of your tickets, you can now call the Burning Man
Ticket Troubleshooting
              Line at (415) 985-7142. Please have the following information
handy: When you
              sent you materials, how you sent the materials, your check
number, and be sure to
              leave your Name address and phone number sop we can get back
to you with the
              details.

       A Live Link in the Happening Stages
              The Burning Man Project is sparing no effort in connecting
you live to the desert
              through the Internet. We will be putting a low bandwidth link
live to central camp
              (barring acts of nature) to the net. At this point we are
envisaging doing something
              on IRC chat (It must be good for something!), possibly a MOO
or MUSE
              environment, and if we can get ahold of a Studio Transmitter
Link (STL) we will
              be able to do much much more. The webified version of the
Black Rock Gazette
              will be uploaded nightly to this archive section of the site.
If you have any
              expertise in radio packet networking, have video capture
equipment, digital still
              cameras, or psychic abilities we would love to hear from you!

Yes, it is quite possible to get into burning man for free? As Geoff stated
it could also be quite costly and/or dangerous. The only people you will be
scamming to get in for free are the others attending the party. BM is not
produced by BGP or some other huge corporation. Most of the money goes to put
this thing together. I went last year and was not hesitant to pay $35 again
this year to attend, even knowing I could easily get in for free. I am paying
the money because I have seen where it goes. These people put on an awesome
experience and we should be lucky to only have to pay $35. If you are totally
anti-capitalism and money, I'm sure you could get in touch with the BM people
and work out some sort of deal. As, I, said this is not a huge corporation.
These are real people with many progressive ideas. They would more than
likely appreciate your anti- capitalistic ideals. The phone # is
(415)985-7471. Have a great night/day, PEACE!!!!  CID

I'm glad everyone liked Pete Namlook this time.  The last Gardening Club
gig he did was not impressive to many of us.

Just out of curiosity, who's going where in the Bay Area that's not going 
to Burning Man this weekend?

I'm coming up for my friend's 23rd birthday, and I know on Sunday we'll 
be either at Lumina or Spundae (though it is 21+ which sort of cuts in on 
the crowd I suppose)

anyway, we're also looking for something to do Friday or Saturday night.. 
though we may just end up at 1015 Folsom, I'm wondering if any out there 
has any recommendations for anything going on those two nights that we 
should check out instead?

thanks

Michael Ball

You can call the hot line (415)985-7471 and get directions to the gate,
then pay there ($40.00) then go on and have a good time with out having to
worry about bullets from the gatekeeper or the Black Rock Rangers disabeling
your vehical.  

Burning Man spends alot to put this thing on. (always ends up several thousand
in the red) They actually have to rent the land from BLM, supply porta-pottys
(please don't trash the playa), pay insurance, and haul everything out there
plus clean up after the people who don't.  The people who work the event only
get five dollars off the price.

so, for those of us not going to Burning Man, would it be possible to 
pick up a laminate before hand? 
I'm coming up for the weekend to visit my parents and some friends and I 
think it would be cool to get a laminate before hand in case I check out 
anything in SF where some SFRavers might be in attendance.

if not, that's cool, I can wait..I realize this might be cutting it kind 
of close...but e-mail me anyway and let me know

thanks

Hey, all! I've finally got some info regarding how to ID 
our site at the Playa. We'll have about 4 or 5 tents (two 
large grey/blue, one red, one sky blue), placed in 
a more or less half-moon at the center of which will be 
a yellow shade tent (roof without walls). Hung somewhere 
nearby will be a sheet/banner, which reportedly has an 
infinity symbol on a background of stars. There are (so far) 
two vehicles associated with our site- though I don't know 
how close they'll be to our camp- one's a Dodge caravan 
of which color I won't know 'til I pick it up from the rent-a-car 
place; the other is a black, Infiniti G20. We'll have firewood,
water and other fun stuff- so come on by!
me? I'm petite; have longish brown hair & brown eyes. i 
haven't got any costumes planned, but I just got a new pair of glasses 
which will likely be hanging around my neck from a 
"i-can't-keep-track-of-these" black chain. i'll be easy to spot if 
i'm wearing my swim suit, too- it's shiny, almost metallic 
aquamarine blue 2-piece that exactly matches my veins (except for the 
shiny part).

also, we plan to reserve at least one of the smaller tents 
as a quiet, private, sort of safety tent- if you need 
such an interlude to maintain that yin/yang balance, please feel free! 

Hasta la playa!

jocelyn

p.s. other people who are reportedly sharing the site:
Gretchen, Kevin, Jeff, Alyssa, Christina, Renee, Brady,
& later on Manny, Daniel, Jim & possibly more ? you?

Heck, we could even do a Carlos-for-Carlos trade.  When I left New York a year 
and a half ago, Brooklyn's Carlos Tera (sometimes listed on flyers as "Tera", 
"Terra", or "Terror") was really hot but unknown outside of the Cybertek / Back 
to Basics / Mental Unity parties.  He was playing trancey acid that ranged from 
dreamy to brain-splattering, depending on mood and move.  Very nice, 
professional guy who never messed a mix.

Heather is great too!  Any DJ who can go from old Chicago-style acid house to 
*HARD* German acid (like PCP - Planet Core Productions) in one set *and have it 
all work* is worth it.

Jim Trickett?  I might end up there, along with me traveling companion 
Dave.  We're both from the nw(Seattle & Vancouver Island)  and I expect 
we'll hook up with one mailing list camp or another.  If your's is THE 
camp, then I expect we'll be there.  Or we might miss you...  It's going 
to be big  :)

I'll be easy to spot, I just dyed my hair purple, and I'll have a straw 
cowboy type hat to kep the sun off.  5'9", brown eyes, pink nw-raves 
laminate. 

Hope to see y'all there,
Patrick

                      Hello out there, I'm just here and in bit of a 
wacky mood so I thought I would post this liitle poem:
                           YIPPEE-
                    I can feel myself coming
                    alive, I feel loved and
                    jokey, and what's more;
                    I've got a smile stretching
                    across my face from here to there.
                          -Unknown-
                         How I feel  sometimes at parties:).
                             Enjoy,
                         Reagan

They kept the map point open all weekend for at least the last 3 years, so
I don't expect it to be any different.

Cool! I just finished braising an ornate starspangled fritillary out of
copper tubing though my genital piercings.... Gives a spectacular light

Just in case any of you need to get ahold of me before Burning Man for
whatever reason, you need to know that my e-mail access will be interruped
starting tomorrow till sometime next week.  Our office is moving to a new
building, thus I have to wait till it's all hooked back up to read any of my
mail.  It will be running through the end of today, but if anyone needs to
contact me my phone numbers are (916)734-7969 (day) and (916)452-4480
(evening).  See you all at BM.

Rick

Hi,   I have room for one more person (Plus luggage/water/whatever)
for ride to Burning man.   MUST share driving and gas and have valid DL.

$50 (gas) split 3 ways would be the costs in gas.   Today,  I'll be in
and out,   but please Email me or phone me at 415-381-5847.

I plan on leaving this evening around 11 pm or so,   driving through the
night,  and leaving the Playa on Monday morning,  and stopping at Pyramid
lake for a swim on the way back.

Let me know ASAP...

I'm at the stage in the development of my Home Page where I need to have
as many links as possible to all the Rave related pages.

So,  if you have a rave related WEB site,  please let me have the URL
and permission to link to it.

I have a special page,  dedicated to my involvement in the Rave scene,
including pictures.

By now everyone's heard about what happened at Narnia, the promoters had planned to use an 800 acre horse ranch in Ramona, which is in the hills about an hour north of San Diego.  They negotiated with someone who claimed to be rightful owner of the land, but later turned out to be a con artist.  Before anyone calls Global Underworld naive, keep in mind that they had applied for and been granted all the necessary permits from the city - the city is supposed to stringently check ownership before granting permits and even they didn't catch it.
Apparently, the main stage had already been set up and part of the land had been bulldozed in preparation for the event when the real owner of the property found out what was going on and stopped the event.

We had already purchased our plane tickets so we decided to go to SD for the weekend anyway.  On Saturday there was a really cool party that was on a mountain overlooking the desert.  You had to drive down this tiny dusty dirt road for about a half hour through cactuses and riverbeds before all the cars abruptly stopped in the middle of nowhere - you couldn't hear music or see anything, there was just a line of cars stretching upward as far as you could see.  We piled out and walked uphill past the line of parked cars for another 20 minutes before reaching the site - there were about 500 - 600 people in a clearing, dancing to Steve Pagan, DJ Knobby from Fat Cat, (a really great record store in London) and some new guy named Steve (?) from San Diego who was really good. Also one of my favorite dj's anywhere, Mark E. Quark, took the sunrise shift.  Pretty solid sound system too, it looked like they had 5 or 6 Jr. Earthquakes. After dancing awhile I walked down a ways from the site and chilled out with two good
 friends next to this giant rock outcropping - looking at the most incredible stars I've seen in years, millions and millions and millions of them. After a while the sun came up and you could see the Salton Sea and desert everywhere.
It started to get hot so we drove back to the ocean and went swimming. 
This event, because it was spontaneous and free and illegal, was a lot of things Narnia could not have been - props to Bill and Brian from Tribal Funk record store and everyone else who was involved in hooking it up.

The official word is that Narnia's been rescheduled for September 23rd.  We'll be there.  I'll pass on any more info as I get it.

It (the rave camp) should last through the entire event.  If they are
burning the MAN on Sunday, let me tell you, you won't want to be at the rave
camp when it happens.  The Rave camp will be about a mile away from the MAN.
After the fire dies down then the rave camp will probably "go off".  See ya
there.

Hello everyone! I was just trying to consolidate a bunch of these posts, 
when I thought how great it would be for everyone if there was one 
single list that we could print out and take with us. So, if you're 
going, please reply to this post publically and add your name, email, 
some sort of description, and what camp you'll be at. Here, I'll start...

Alexandra (Alex) Crocket  <alex_c@scs.unr.edu>
5'4" w/ red hair parted in middle reaching half way down my back 
(or tied up in a bun w/a pencil) Don't know where I'll be yet!

I know this is probably going to add total bandwidth, but I think it 
would be worth it to *finally* find other sfravers!!!
Hope your day is wonderful!!!!! :) :) :)               
						lv, Alex

Well, Wayne and crew are making badges. Since someone said they will be 
wearing a bunch of them around their neck, they shouldn't be too hard to 
spot. So get a badge, and everyone will be able to know who the SF-Ravers 
are. Problem solved. :) Seeya all at B-man.....

	YERS!  Burning Man is gonna totally kikdashit.  I've got a pony 
tail, new earrings (I might be rubbing my sore lobes a bit), and will be 
wearing a tan alien smiley shirt or a red 'exploded' smiley shirt.  p.s. 
Look for the dumpy red two-door ford escort with a 'Doug's Used Autos' sign 
instead of a license plate, I imagine I'll be nearby at times.
	I canna wait for this weekend.  

	take care, and drive safely

Find us and get your SF Raves badges! You can't miss us!

Vince <vince@vmar.com> says, "[The truck] It's a big giant thing with V-Mar
Racing on the sides and big Rasta (red,gold,green) graphics." It is a huge
commercial truck that definitely stands out.

We'll be getting there around 7pm on Friday. I'll have either a "US Coast
Guard Approved" personal strobe light or a big yellow revolving beacon
(like you would see on an emergency vehicle like a tow truck) on top to
make us even easier to find.

Subject: Simply Done Nutshell Review
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     Though I wasn't there the whole night/morning, I did want to check out 
     Jeno playing at DV8 since I was up in SF for a Burning Man meeting.  
     This is the second time I've been to Simply Done at this location and 
     for me, it leaves alot to be desired.
     
     Perhaps I'm just really picky, but I experienced the following.  (Note 
     that it's just _my_ perspective and perhaps it's just where I'm coming 
     from these days.)
     
     -  The high ceilings and the supporting posts seem to divide up the 
     view of the space as well as divide up the contributed "party" energy. 
      It's a good place for lurking, but for me, sometimes to get a party 
     going off, it helps to have everyone more aware of eachother.  This 
     space is not conducive to this.
     
     -  Per a 1015 promoter, the mgmt installed some new boosted bass 
     system or something of the sort.  (I'm real technical here!)  Before I 
     knew this, I thought the dj's were just plain old distorting the sound 
     by pumping the levels 'cause the sound was very muddy.  The highs and 
     lows were not distinct at all making it unexciting for me to dance to 
     (as I like to coordinate my moves w/an instrument, sound, or a 
     vocalist).  
     
     There were some nice things about it:  the visuals, lasers, and 
     lighting are not too bright so you don't feel so inhibited being a 
     voyer or dancer.  Jeno started putting out a nice mix and got people 
     moving harder; and John Howard wasn't bad if the sound was better.  
     And best of all, there's friends who always give good hugs.
     
     So that's my nutshell review.  Can't wait until I get to the desert 
     w/our sfrave rv contingent.  I think we're just one of at least seven 
     rv's that I know of. 
     
     Have a great Labor Day Weekend whatever you do!
     
     Diane

Does anyone know if Sunset is happening this Sunday?

My good friend Mark E. Quark of San Diego will be in town for a few days 
and I'd like to take him, and perhaps he can do a guest spot.

Hi there ravers,

I think the easiest way to identify all the SFRavers at the festival will
be the cool SFRaves Laminates hanging around their necks !!  :)
HeeHeeHeeHahahahohoho I hope everyone is as excited as me!!

 See ya there.

PS: The V-Mar truck will probably be near the rave camp, but may move
around a bit, as I will be doing some work for the Burning Man folks as
well !!  But I think our main location will be near the rave site.!!

WWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

um, you know, not to sound mean or anything, but why do we need those 
east coast DJs here? i've been to maryland a few times, and the "ravers" 
there should be called lamers. to them, its not about the rave "scene" 
and getting along with one another...etc...but its about what fashon 
trend you are in, and if you dont dress like everyone else, or dance like 
everyone else, you get laughed at, and shuned. im sorry, but if the 
general poplulation at ravers there feel that way, then im sure the DJs 
are on the same tip, and my personal opinion is why have them here? let 
them stay there in their own concided(sp) world and think they are ravers.

of course, i could be totally off the wall about this idea, but its the 
way i felt things were out there.

Okay. For those of you who know Vince and I, we're quickly becoming the
"mutt 'n jeff" of the sfraves scene.

You may identify me from the following info:
 I'm tall (6'6") and have long red/brown hair in a pony tail.
 And I will probably be wearing
  (a) full US Army cammo. uniform.
  (b) a serious looking "Chevron" jacket (looks like a police/security jacket)
  (c) a big white Cat in the Hat t-shirt and shorts.
 I will also be wandering around with
  -SFRAVES LAMINATES!
  -an extra soft koosh ball for you to play with :)
  -about a hundred blow pops :)
  -about 500 starbursts :)
   (those are for all of you!)  :)

And I will be staying in the legandary V-Mar Rasta Rig.

Hug me,
-w

Weighing in at 200 pounds, probably one of the oldest ravers at age 47,
having written more words about
drugs and counterculture than most, Bruce Eisner beams empathetically, his
cheshire cat grin
unmistakable in a crowd of 'Ninties punks, skaters and assorted rave kids.
Brown hair, brown eyes,
tan skin to withstand a desert sun.  Be sure to give this man what he wants
-- sex, drugs and raving all night long.
