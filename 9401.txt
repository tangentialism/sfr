Subject: Universal Groove, bah.

[This review is a little late, but might be of interest.]

For the second (and last) time, Greg and I were pretty dissapointed in
Universe Groove at Thunder Bay.

Okay the positive technical details: Cool space, well ventilated, free
water, sufficient volume.

Bad technical details: No ins-n-outs (changed since last time), DJ in
main room is in separate room and invisible, speakers hanging from
ceiling with no real sound imaging.

But two things really killed this party:

One was persistent sound problems in the smaller room. Carlos was
spinning, and man he was jamming, and there'd be a great vibe for 15
minutes, then the speaker would blow out. Every time I walked into the
room, there'd be a great vibe, or everyone would be standing around
looking like they wanted there to be a great vibe. Poor Carlos, having
to deal with all that (they even swapped out mixers mid-party).

But what _really_ killed it was the crowd. I've never seen so many
people at an event for there to be no vibe at all. Lots of attitude.
Everyone standing around trying to look cool. Maybe 15-20% of the
people were dancing, and I don't know why not because the music was
good enough to dance to. It makes me wonder if it just isn't a cool
place to hang out. The place had a very negative atmosphere. Could
have used a very large jar of E.

Next time YSH is cancelled, I think we're going to try out Spacelab.
Would've this time, but I forgot my rave guide and phone numbers.

I don't recommend this event. We've been two or three times now cause
we wanted to give it a chance, and we've always had more fun listening
to mix tapes in the car on the way back. We *had* to listen to those
mix tapes to cleanse out all that negative vibe we picked up.

[I apologise for this late review...]

That was just a killer killer awesome party. Good vibes, good friends,
good music, good space, good visuals.

I can't resist giving a technical review first ;)

Indoor and outdoor space. Ins and outs. Two bathrooms. Excellent
sound. No security. Price: $0. Fresh DJs. No brassiere and booty
gangsta molls (but one temporarily upset goth). Free beer. Free
munchies. Great visuals. Good directions. Lots of chillout space. Pool
and hottub but they didn't look like you'd really want to use them...
Friendly promoters. Free videogames.

Yum :).

Bryce started out with "The History of Dance Music", playing, as
someone pointed out, YMCA, as well as "I'm Turning Japanese" and other
goodies. (What? No Jane's Addiction? :)) And *everyone* was getting
into it. Finally he faded out for the countdown and we all did
champagne and massive amounts of hugging.

And then, as if to say "Welcome to the 90s", he cut into some
delicious acid trance. God I loved that moment, that transition. After
listening to all that disco and stuff, _that_ was cool.

And then Ethan opened with that wailing siren Vapor Space cut, and
dove into one of the most incredible, sick, twisted acid trance sets
I've ever heard. He just fucking blew Tim and I away. Tim kept coming
over to me with permagrin, muttering "Sick...sick..."

And then Tamara got her chance (of course she did, or I was going to
make a scene) and spun some slightly less sick but awesome good
trance, perfect for winding the night down. I cooked off a lot of
calories as I am wont to do when the music's that good.

We crashed there that night, and the next day woke up to redwood
forests, birds, and warm sunshine. A day spent at the beach and in
Santa Cruz topped off a perfect weekend.

Many many thanks to Steve for putting it together and throwing a
perfect house party. And thanks to Ethan, Bryce, and Tamara for the
equipment and great music. Thanks to the SFRavers that showed for
bringing your good vibes and for being family. And a very special
thanks to the hosts for inviting us to their house so we could trash
it.

House parties! Yes!

Damn!  I almost posted a quicktime moov of Barney morphing into Hitler

(If anyone wants it, it's on sumex-aim in the directory w/ all the

  OFFICE MEMO         Wired!                                Date:  1/6/94
Well, Geoff asked for a report---

I really had a ball at Wired, actually.  The space was really cool, I dug the
elevator, and I had a good time watching the Macworlders try to understand the
dancers (and vice versa).  I  came in during the second half of Farina's set, a
good farina set, housey, good.  I hadn't head Evil eddie Richards before, but I
really dug his very tribal sound.  It brings me back to last year, when San
Francisco was really into the whole tribal thing.  Totally cool.  Josh came on,
but he only played for about 20 minutes and then it was over (around 2:15).  I
had a good time doing the coat check, as I was tired of dancing, and just want
to hang out and meet people.  Huge space!  
Best part of the night was when someone knocked over this huge vase of really
incredible flowers.  A LOT of people got free flowers that night!  Fun time,
well worth the drive.  I hope one or two more parties can be put in that space
before Wired moves in!

Josh said that Come/Unity was going off when he left, so I suppose it was up to
its usual awesomeness.  

see ya!
m i k e
(anyone know of any good MacWorld parties on Friday?  I have to go with my
group from work and want to make the best of it.)

Hope everyone had a great New Year's...after the big weekend, it seems
like the promoters forgot about this Friday.  So maybe you'll want to 
check out Corduroy City.  Saturday has a couple of interesting parties;
one is at the I-Beam, great location for Haight area residents, and the
other is a Wicked presentation at the much-maligned 16th & Harrison space.
I dunno how that'll work.

Sunday morning, Sunday Soul and DNA rush in quickly to fill the void
left by the end of Boogie Buffet; Mushroom Jazz has been great on
Mondays and Together returns with a stellar lineup on Tuesday.
Wednesday, you might want to check out the Bulletproof party at Miss
Pearl's, and next Thursday, hopefully Your Sisters' House will finally
return...

I went to both and had a great time at both. After a few 
problems getting into the Wired party (they opened the
dorrs 40 minutes late so we were all standing out in the
cold), we went up to find Mark Farina spinning a really
jazzy set, which I liked, but it sounded lost echoing off
the walls of this huge loft/warehouse? space. You had to
stand close to the DJ to really hear what was going on.
They had a separate area with an ambient room,bars, and
tables, and at the beginning there seemed to be a sort
of segregation, suit-and-tie set in this room and ravers
in the other...it broke down a little later in the evening
(but eventually the corporate set got tired and went home).
Eddie Richards took over after Mark (does he still use the
"Evil" nickname?) and played some upbeat stuff (like stuff
on Murk). Josh came on after that, but I didn't stay in that
room during his set...I noticed that he tapes his record
labels and I really hate that (I think it smacks of
elitism but that's another post altogether).

After Wired closed down at 2, we headed over to ComeUnity.
It was packed and Jeno was playing in the main room...I
enjoyed his stuff since I haven't heard him since he came
down to LA about a month ago and played a lot of stuff that
I just didn't like. The lights were gettting too annoying so I
crashed out in the ambient room (NOISY ambient room!) and 
listened to Dubtribe lay down some cool live ambient...nice way
to wind down the evening.

Highlight of the evening: free money from Mike!!

Status: 

Holy shit! SpaceLab was totally, completely out of this world last night.
Best music I've ever heard in San Francisco -- no joke.

Kevin got things going, was followed by chris who provided serious subsonic
bass therapy as an intro to Jonas spinning the sickest, hardest non-stop
high-energy acid trance I've ever heard. Which was only the beginning; he
was joined live by miguel playing what they described as the "acid boxes" a
bunch of roland boxes 303, 909, and I think I heard him say a 707? I
watched Jonah pull of a mind-bending 5-minute vinyl mix while miguel just
shredded with tweaky acid warps, phases etc. Ultimately they let the vinyl
stop and just jammed on the boxes simultaneously. Live acid is amazing!

They were followed by Alex who continued in like form, totally rearranging
my mind. He appears to a master of the line switch, using it to apply
gate-like to effects to vocals, synths etc. Smoked the vinyl...

Check this one out next time, you may never be the same afterward. 
Grin  :)

A number of people have mentioned that it would be nice to have a renegade

New Moon Raves, and they are interested in getting other people involved.
So if you would like to help -- whether it's DJ-ing, or helping them set up,
or whatever else you think you can do that would be useful -- send me email
and I will put you in touch with them.

I'm not sure of the exact date, but the next New Moon Rave will be some time
next week, during the week.  It will be outdoors.

Yikes! What more can be said? I know where I'll be on Thursday nights. 

I was feeling lazy, so I took the Mission bus instead of walking (only 9 
blocks) and got in around 12:30. Luckily I hadn't missed much (except all 
the great music). Having Miguel's party there was the icing on the cake. 
Everybody coming for it got in for half-price and the place was full of 
his friends. It was like a San Anselmo field trip (now make sure you get 
this note signed by your parents, wear your name tag, &c...). What really 
amused me was the number of Macworldites. If you didn't think the blinky 
red pendant wouldn't give you away...Oh well, as usual, the music was 
amazing. I was waiting around for Miguel to play and around 2 finally he 
and Jonas broke into an acidy-jackhammer set. The dance area was packed 
(for SpaceLab). My ears are still ringing. Unfortunately, it went on only 
for about 15 minutes. We wanted more, but after all, it's their show. 

This is probably too vague, but there's a track Jonas plays every week 
that I *must* know the name of. It came on before the set with Miguel. 
Simple track really, just a beat and simple melody from what sounds like 
an old Hammond organ with a descending piano bit over it. At SpaceLab, 
whever this thing comes on, it's like a physical command to get to the 
dancefloor. I guess I'll have to make it a point to ask next week.

When I left around 3:30, there were still quite a few folks left, and the 
music didn't give any hint of stopping. I hated to leave, but work-week 
fatigue was setting in. So nice to be able to walk home instead of drive. 
Hope to see you there next Thurs. JMAR, as usual.

Subject: 94 - Start your engines...
Status: 

Just got off the phone with a well known personality here on the net, then
got on the phone with James, and re-etab contacts with hosts of others.  Of
course, all on Company time.

One person I will definitely book is Sassy Lime - Disco Detective.
She spun right before, I think, Dani at the last boggie buffet.  She popped
out of nowhere and is a really good.  Mixes that 70's funk & soul so
fucking well I made a point of getting her # right off.  She's booked.

Loren (I need to hear him spin soon) & John Howard are the other two I have
in mind for a few things in 94.  Brad as well is another contender who's
shit should be ballistic here in SF by now, but lack of exposure has kept
him back...I'll do my part.

Which brings up another recurring question on the list.  Female DJ's.  I am
not going to go on and on about this, but something that happened recently,
made this stick out in my mind:

Seth H., after listening to me go on about contacts, and tapes, got my
address and sent me a tape.  It got here in a few days, and barely a week
after he promised me one.  The tape has (as of today), been forwarded to
two of my friends who like some of the harder edge stuff, and are in
positions to hire DJ's.  Seth H. took the time, did the do, and now his
tape is being circulated.

I hope that the female DJ's, who want bookings, do one thing SORELY lacking
from them over the past couple of years (sans Niki, Dani, & Jan), start
promoting themselves.  I would love to hear some new talent come from some
new ladies this year, but I won't be going to the four corners to find
them. I hope I don't have to hear the "stuff" about female DJ's not getting
booked.  Becuase the FIRST thing I will ask them is "Do you have a tape?",
then "Where will you be spinning next?"



Calling all...

I am looking for some stuff for '94.  First, if you know anyone who can
toast, rap, or do spoken word let me know.  I am looking for a more soulful
flavor (like Digable Planets, et al), and good voice.  Improv a plus, but
if you have some records that you've practiced with, and have a set, I'm
looking for you.

Next, I am looking for African American females who can do the do on the
decks.  If they are versed in hip-hop, deep house, & dub. Let me know how I
can get ahold of them.

Next, I am looking for female talent in general.  Someone who can do the do
with acid jazz, house, & deep house.  If you know of anyone lemme know.

Thats' my shopping list for '94.  Just leave me their # and I'll call them up.

C'ya,
John

I guess the thing is, most had never heard of it going on AT ALL.  I know
that P was talking to me a FEW weeks ago about doin something like this.  I
don't think even he was aware (that I know of) that something like this was
happening.

Rave, but only the true cracker-jacks would appreciate this one ;) (btw - I
and a few friends are planning to do just this.  Crack-On & Golf...better

Right on, Ethan!
SpaceLab is definitely my favorite club in SF.  The place
was PACKED, partly because of Miguel Cell Orchestra's b-day.  Maybe they'll
start using the downstairs?!!  As always, the music was mindblowing, but I
have to say,I think Alex might just get a teensy weensy bit trigger happy with
the line/transform switch.  When it works, it REALLY works, pumping up the
crowd and causing scattered shouts of approval, but if the timing is only
slightly off, it sounds bad and makes it difficult to keep the dancin'
groove.  This is my only little (note: LITTLE) gripe about the dj'ing. 
Jonah ripped it up bigtime, as did Miguel and his handy dandy 303.  The
only other complaint I have is that it's on the same day as YSH :(

The only time I really do any party hopping is if I'm promoting.  If not, I
try to stay in one place.  I will also hop if the party sucks and I know of
a better one going on.  Of course getting in free, at times, helps.

Yeah!! ;)!  What I wanted to emphasize is that different promoters are
planning quite a few different types of free parties.  Held at different
time periods, and different locales.  But somehow Howard, methinks you knew
this ;) (you sarcastic so and so!).

No problem... trip-hop is NOT like hip hop except for the beat structure.
Everything else about it is house/rave oriented.  Markie has been spinning
alot of it recently (the ever EVOLVING dj that he is), and it is the shit.
Unless you like hip-hop you would probably not notice it...give it a try.

Damn!  I missed my latest issue, as well as my weekly harassment from those

Before Howard goes any further, I just want to say that his analysis below,
falls right on the mark when it comes to his predictions (at least
reviewing the '93 posts).  I hope that people attempt to prove him wrong,
but I somehow doubt it.

Man this fucking dead horse issue keeps popping up by many.  The fact is
the house scene is QUITE intact.  As I and *others* predicted, there are
alot of more intimate things going on.  Not for mass consumption.  As a
matter of fact, I am attending a house party tonite.  There are some really
good (name/no name) DJ's playing there tonite.  It is a private party.  But
things like this is what people need in order to re-estab family ties.  I
hope there are more of them, as well as more larger gatherings (400-500
MAX).

The only Coast I care about is the soap.  I think I won stock in it.

I hope so.  But looking into the '94 crystal ball I have a premonition that

Hey all,

Just wanted to say hello and thanks to all the SF Ravers who made my trip 
back west so enjoyable.  I really enjoyed coming out and getting to spend 
time in the cradle of a great and different scene.  I had a blast doing 
the things we did (we did do those things, didn't we?) and hooking up 
with the west coast vibemasters.  Specific thanks follow:

Tamara - For giving me a joint to crash at and being a gracious hostess
Cindy & Rob - For giving me another joint to crash at
Jeno the Cat - For playing with my nose in the morning
Jo - For going to all the trouble to finally get us met
Bryce - For having the Liquid Air tapes (very neat)
Susie - For *working it* (you go girl)
Dana - For having such an interesting look on your face when I gave you 
  the fluffy pink handkuffs at the club
Cap'n Crunch - Umm, just thought I should put you in here somewhere
All the Bootstores in SF and Berkeley - For having a hoakey collection of 
  boots, I finally found a pair of steeltoed Cat's in LA
Spaghetti Western - Hey, the food is okay, but I think they are 
  overcharging for the ambiance (come back Delta's Depression Dough)
Housewares - For finally letting me see a pair of Ambiance Pants (?) and 
  having an NE Raves sticker up (Susie?).

And to all the folks I met and saw again, it was a blast.  I dig your 
scene, quite different than the east (observations withheld, do I look like 
flame bait?).  But it is nice to get back to familiar friends, the net, 
work, writing and a stable household.

Dan

Ps. Bryce, I was very impressed with that first set on New Years.  Who 
would have thought they would dance to that stuff, I almost died 
laughing, but you pulled it off.  That's style.

guest DJ's plus a special live performance" and the "fatline:

I sent Derek another flyer for something called "Butter" which looks
like a Jazz event as well.  I know absolutely nothing about Jazz but
if ya like it, these two might be worth looking in to.  (Butter is in
the same place on the 22nd.  I got the flyers in the American Rag, so
these events come as is with no guarantees of quality :-)

SpaceLab was WONDERFUL... Gonna have to write up a review on it later,

Since when was techno in the front seat? Seems to me like funky house rules
(unfortunately), at least in SF.  I definitely agree that hip-hop
influenced beats will become more poplular, but I don't see it as taking
over techno, since techno is already way under represented in the SF
scene.  I see more hip-hop influence coming in the mainstream HOUSE scene,
and hopefully much trippiness as well :)   I don't think hip-hop
will be fusing much with hard-acid-techno, although "techno-hop"
could be quite interesting...

Yeah well, the more, the merrier. It looked like some of them had quite a 
good time. Others looked somewhat perplexed. They and the San Anselmo 
crowd made for a large influx of new visitors. Hope some of them decide 
to come back. If you're there next week, say hi. Unfortunately, having 
only returned to Internet in the past month (after a 1-1/2 yr hiatus) and 
a recent add to this list, I'm still a bit "recognizationally challenged"

Status: 


(This is rather long)

This weeks rave scene as I saw it
=================================

		By
	  John T. Draper
	  "Cap'n Crunch"
	  
   This week,  I had Mac World Expo to deal with,  so this sorta
mucked up my usual raving this week,  but I did get in some raving
in some strange sort of way.    I guess I'll start off by my 
observations of the Wired Magazine's First aniversary party.

   The Wired party was FREE.   Probably the best part about it,
but for me,   it was a togetherness between the MacWorld folks
who I have known for many years,   as all of my "Out of towners"
were there,  and for the very first time,   they came together
with all of my friends and family of the SF Ravers.    It was a
strange mix in a way.   All these "suits" together with all the 
ravers.   Quite a few Mac Worlders were on the dance floor,  even
a few suits.   It was the first time any of my Mac Worlders has 
ever seen me dancing.,  It got quite a few "double takes".

   I would guess there were about 500 folks (Possibly more),  because
I got in rather late,  after checking into a few other MacWorld parties,
and finding them to be total duds.    Yukk!!  After all that time,
hustling for invites,  those parties requiring invites seem to be
really bad.    Good free food and drinks,   but for some reason,
I find schmoosing with ravers much more enjoyable.    At any rate,
when I arrived at the Wired party,   one of the DJ's was playing some
rather slow jazzy stuff.    Good dancable music,   but I decided to
schmoose with my "out of towner" friends and prep my head for
the evening.   After I noticed the music picking up,  I headed
over to the dance floor,  and found all my SFRaver friends getting
into some pretty good energetic stuff,  all huddled by the speakers.
For some reason,  the sound level didn't have as much of a "punchey"
punping sound that I like.    The Mac Worlders were way out away from
the speakers,  but there WAS some good mixture out there.    Lots
of room,  and not that crowded.    The DJ's were really good,   playing
some good newer stuff along with the usual "housey" sound.

   After the Wired party,  I headed over to Come/Unity at 1015
Folsom and WOW!!   AWSOME!!   It was almost WICKED in nature,
and super crowded.    I think it was because I told a lot of
Mac Worlders about Come/Unity, as it wasn't on any of the Mac
World Party lists.    As the very first thing I did,  was to
go to the BMUG (Berkeley Mac Users Group),  and get the latest
MacWorld party list.   WHAT!!  Come/unity not on the list??  
C'm on folks,   you can do metter that THAT!!   It was hard
for me to explain that Come/Unity wasn't a party you would
want to miss.   And they would say,  "Why isn't it on the list?"
I would say,  "It's a SPECAIL party, you won't want to miss it".
It certainly lived up to its expectations.    It was pumpin hard
and strong,  putting 1015's sound system to it's limit.   I would'nt
want to guess how many people were there,   but it was a LOT.
It lasted until 7:30 am,  which was also super great!!!   An
ALL NIGHTER!!  in the middle of the week.   After that was
over,  I headed home for a shower,  change back into my suit,
and headed back to MacWorld to see the General Magic demo.

   After MacWorld,  I was able to sneak into the Todd Rundgren's
private party at the Exploratorium.   I know Todd Personally,  cause
I helped him with a Mac Programming problem a few years ago.    

  The food was excellent,  and free drinks,   so I hosed down a lot
of it,  cause I was starving.   Nothing was really going to get
started musically until later,  but we all had fun,  playing with all 
the science "hands on" exhibits that make the Exploratorium so 
famious.   I sure met a lot of old friends I haven't seen for ions,
and learned that you can put a straight bar through a curved slot,
played with ions,   and generated high voltage sparks.  Whoopee!! :-)

   Todd's "Stage" had a huge mixture of roland electronic drums,
a few synthesyzers,   and a huge array of TV Monitors sitting above
the round stage in the middle of the main exhibit floor.   The
round stage had a sort of metallic floor around it,   then in the 
inside,   the midi equipment,  and on top of that,  the monitors.

   Todd explained the "Protocol" to his "Interactive performance"
where the audience was to have a part of it.    They had rubber
sharks,  dinosaurs,  and other things hanging from rods connected
to the top of the round stage.   Todd explaned that when the green
light goes on,   the audience was invited to dance on the round stage.
When Yellow, the GoGo Dancers had that area.   When "red",  it means
that only Todd could be up there.   When I heard that there was this
possibility of dancing up there,   I started heading towards the
front.   I wanted to be in on this gig.   All the geeks from Mac
World sorta hung back taking it all in.

   Todd went crazy,  playing some new stuff I haven't hear on his
new Video,   then went into some of his popular stuff.   All during the
show,   the green light would go on,  and everyone would jump up on
the stage and start dancing.    People would sorta march around the
stage.    As I looked out in the audience,  all my Mac Geek friends
were totally surprised to see me up there acting like a nut,  having
a total ball.   Todd would jump off the stage,  shaking the hands
of the dancers,  then handing out drum stick to people,   showing
them where their drums are,  and it was a total interactive jam
session to end all jam sessions.   The interactive audience went crazy,
while SOME geeks and the suits were schmoozing,  totally unaware
of the insane amount of jamming going on.

   After Todds show,  I schmoozed around for a while,  talking to
old friends,  and telling them where the Space lab party is located.
Naturally,  it wasn't on any of the Mac World party lists,  and
the Mac Worlders were just starving and drooling over the prospect
of learning of a new PARTY.   I told them,  you don't want to miss
this one,  and it goes till 4 am.    Wish I had those Space lab flyers,
it would have made my life easier.    So I made sure they all knew
how to get there,  as I told about a 150 of my friends about it.
It was at the Trocidero.

   Sure enough.... as I arrived,  so did a LOT of my Mac World
friends,  and they would say WOW!!  Great party.   And it sure
lived up to it.    Absolutely AWSOME Acid Techno stuff,  and
after not sleeping the night before,  it was just what I needed.
Good fast music.   Great German stuff.  Ohhh!!  I wish someday
to get back to Germany and attend one of their raves.   I went
totally insane on the dance floor.   Met a raver friend from Seattle
I met while attending the BASIC rave up there a month ago.    He
was also at the previous evenings Come/Unity party.   Anyway,  the
music was the best I've heard since Darcy spun at the last "Your
Sisters House" party.   All my Mac World freinds really dug it.
One would come up to me and say "How to you hear about these parties".
I said "It was on the raves list",  then explain the SFRaves calander
to them.    It was all over much to soon for me,   Yukk!!  4 am,  and
nothing going on...   Guess I'll go home and try to sleep.   I managed
to trance out for a few hours at least before I had to get over to
Mac World again in the morning.

   Friday morning....  Time to hustle around at Mac World,   and
prepare for yet another evening of partying.    I knew that I would
have to hustle to try and get into the DIGITAL BE-IN.  It costs
a whopping $25.... YUKKK!!   I ran into Ted Nelson on the way
to Mac World,  and he told me that Tim Leary was sick and couldn't
make this one.   Oh WOW!!  no Tim Leary this year....

   Before going to Digital Be-In,  I headed over to BMUG party
at the "Bottom of the hill" club.   I just popped in there to say
hi to the crowd,   then headed over to the Be-In.   I wanted to get
there before it started,  cause it would be easier to sneak in.
No such luck.    It already started,  but.....  Egad!!  Allan Lundell
had remembered to put me on his STAFF list.    They handed me a
STAFF sticker,  and it was FAT CITY.   Yow!! I was in...  plus
could go back stage...  omygod!!  what luck.

   I get there just as it was starting.    First I'll explain the
venue...   It's the FASHION CENTER,  a big swankey place, with
multiple stories,  and a large center.   Many rooms, stores,
and definately a multiple entertainment gig.   There were VR stations,
and the "Body Synth" people,  computer demos,  smart drinks,  and
a lot of stuff even I can't explain.    NO house music yet...  Ughh!
So I schmoose,  and take in the entertainment,  and an opportunity to
get off my feet from walking around Mac Expo all day long.  YES!!
even *I* have certain limits,  I just know what they are...

   Eventually I hear the music,  and start heading down to where
a few SFRavers are dancing.   WOW!!  good music,   volume a tad too
low,   but alright next to the speaker.   I was kickin as usual to
some pretty common stuff.    The rest of the geeks and suits were 
just sitting down,  shaking their heads as I was going crazy with
the music.   Sets were rather short,  about 20 minutes long,  and
used as filler between gigs.    The main sheebang started,  and
the acters took over the dance area.    Really good stuff,  people
on stilts grabbing other dancers and swinging them around.   Really
good high energy stuff.  Sheesh!! Wich I could dance to the stuff,
but I thought at that time,  it would be in-appropriate.   As the
gig started to really take off,  when the actors left,  everyone
made a bee-line for the dance area,   and we were off.   YOW!!
SUPER HIGH energy.  A Whole lot better than a rave.   More
band members picking up anything they can find,   bongos,  drums,
and other instruments,  and all joined in.    The dancing was awsome,
and very crowded.   Even the geeks were up there.  This was one of
the most intense primal get-togethers I've seen in a long time.

   After the main event,  things started to peter out,  as most of
the VR machines were shutting down.    But they kept the house music
going till 3 am.   I was wondering aound for a while,  trying to
decide if I want to go to Corduroy City or a private party at a 
recording studio.    I chose the recording studio.   Hung out there
with some dudes from Santa Cruz,  then headed over to Corduroy City,
but it was over by the time I got there.    I headed home for a much
needed shower,  then went to the LAST DAY of Mac World.    While
there,  I learned of yet another party.   It was the Digital Queers
gathering.

   I learned it was $25 to get in,   but I was lucky to some across
a friend who payed my way in.    It was very strange,  mostly gay
computer professionals,  video artists,  and a comedy gig.    But the
ONE thing that really made it great,  was a super surprise comedian
Robin Williams made an appearance.   The crowd stood up and just
went wild.   Robin fucused on gay related jokes,  and the place
roared with laughter.   I met Robin at a Computer Faire party
about 5 years ago,  and after the dance music started,  Robin
comes over and grabs my arm and said Hi.  WOW!  I had thought
he already left.    The music was the familiar house music on a super
wimpy sound system that distorted on the bass sounds.   Not only
that,   but the DJ apparently hasn't heard about "beat matching",
so my dancing was rather scattered,  besides that,  my banged up
knee was giving me problems,  not helped by all that walking around
at Mac World.    By that tim,  I only had 2 hours sleep in 4 days,
and was ready to do a full system shut down.    Anyway,  it was
a really great 4 days of trade shows and parties.  I got lots of
yoga to catch up on,   so don't plan on going out for at least
3 days.

Later...

This is about the stupidest tactic for combating drug dealing that
I can think of.  I think it has more to do with phone vandalism
then "drug dealing" (besides, I'm sure they are not removing the phones
from which the SIGNIFICANT drug deals are made as in "O.K. I'll send my
boys to unload the tanker tonight").  I can't buy the drug dealing story,
any drug dealer who has his/her shit together should have a cellular phone
by now anyways, they don't cost that much and even the $1000 deposit
(for air time, I'm assuming the dealer doesn't have a credit card) is a
relatively small operating cost considering the potential revenue.

Sometimes San Francisco people tend to think that everything starts 
and revolves around the city, and if it isn't there it just isn't.  
That is why I decided to post my reply to that message. OKAY??!! ;-) 
;-) ;-)


On another note,  I attended a really great, free, house party in 
Santa Clara on Friday night.  It went from about midnight to 8 am. 
New DJ's I hadn't heard of but they were great.  For the most part, 
I knew everyone, but even the people I had just met were very generous, 
and very friendly.  The best part was was that it was only about 
a mile away from my house.  

Hope everyone had as great a weekend as I did.

These events come out of what I guess people refer to as the "mr
fives" crew.  They get a lot of ink in the rags like klub and urb - so
I've read a bit about them and have been intrigued, but I haven't
really made it out to any of their stuff (except maybe the Elbo Room
once).  They seem to have a large following, and regular events (lots
of flyers at Behind the Post Office), but I haven't included their
stuff in the calendar, because it seems distinct and separate from the
house scene.  Anyone have any comments/observations on their parties?

It seems like there has been a good deal of hype behind jazz/hiphop/house
music over the past year and it would be surprising if this style doesn't
get more popular and translate into parties.

I think it'll be a nice change.

Recently I heard the US3 jazz/hiphop cd and thought it was kinda dull.  It
was a rehash of other acid jazz songs with ok rapping added on.  The
super-happy piano and horn licks over flat sounding synth bass lines got
old.  The drum samples were sometimes cool. Hopefully this is not where
things are heading.

Tribe Called Quest's - Midnight Marauders is good.  I liked it.

I want to hear freakier (for lack of a better word) jazz samples and/or
original stuff.  Anthony Braxton, Ornette Coleman, Archie Shepp would
be great for really trippy music. 

My best christmas present cd was Miles Davis - Standing on the Corner
This is early seventies fusion with a bad ass Shaft kinda feel.  It is
a really cool cd.

Nope, I've got that one. This song was more on the acid-jazz-trance end 
of the spectrum. Maybe Church organ would be a better description instead 
of hammond. I usually can't stand piano techno, but this song and that Aphex 
<mu>-ziq mix really get me movin'.

ObTrivia: I was hanging out outside of the Moby/Aphex/Orbital 
shew and over heard the Vapourspace guy talking about 'Gravitational 
Arch...' Apparently, whoever did the cover screwed up as the title was 
supposed to be 'Gravitational Arch of Io' (as in moon of Jupiter). Bet 
he'll neaten up his printing on that songlist next time. Can you say 'doh!'

Thanks. JOHN.

they're pretty decent parties. i attended a few about 2 years ago. not
quite the rave vibe, kinda clubby. emphasis on more african american
music forms (funk, hip hop, "black" disco (i.e. not satyrday night
fever), rare groove, acid jazz.

Ya, I caught that, too!  My sister and my mom are visiting from Texas and
they watched it with me.  They liked it.

I'm talking my sister in coming with me to Spacelab on Thursday since it got
such great reviews!  My mom, unfortunately, said she's more of a rhythm &
blues fan and declined to come.  Her comment on my Liquid Air tape:  "it
sounds a lot like disco"  (!!!!) 

i guess the seventies will never really die....

You don't even need a cell phone to get around the rotary situation.
As the story pointed out, a cheap ($15 or less) handheld tone dialer

I don't care about having to dial a number by rotary as opposed to push
buttons, although it would take a few more seconds.  I *do* care very
much about using a payphone to call my answering machine and *not* be 
able to recall my messages.

I don't have much to add about the Wired party.  Fresh space,
fun cross-cultural pollination, loads of friends.  I had a fun.  I
might even go out and buy an issue.

ComeUnity wasn't quite the religious experience of the first and only 
other one I've been to since it's resurrection, but it was still a
great party.  The price has increased to $7, and they used the
front room for the chillout area, where Dubtribe played some truly
excellent live ambient house.  Markie/Jeno/Simon gave solid sets,
although watching Simon rifle through his records in silence for ten
minutes as he frantically searched for an appropriate encore song helped
end the party with a touch of stupidity.  I mean, the guy picks out song
after song during a 2 hour set, and then can't come up with a final one -
as though he didn't know he was going to do an encore.  I guess you just 
can't plan for those moments of pure inspiration. !-|

Did anyone go to Pucca High?  I'm real curious as to how they set up
the IBeam, and what the sound system was like.

Sunday we checked out the grand opening of Sunday Soul at the Oasis.
It was somewhat dead.  We went over to the DNA, danced a bit to some 
of Tony and Simon,  but the sound was barely adequate: the main
stacks weren't on, and neither were those Servo woofers.  There weren't 
many people there anyway, so we checked back on SS, which at 1pm was in 
need of a decent burial.  Oh, well.  We went home where I was reduced 
to watching the the N.Y. Giants warm up for the thrashing the're gonna 
give the 49'rs this Saturday.  Hope to see everyone at the Blue Cube!

well, someone asked about pucca high. i went there and saw susie, giamma,
jackie, some other folx. i was not that impressed, or i should say, it did
not do that mauch for me. they walled the main room so now u have to go by
the bar to get to the dance area. the sound quality was ok, a bit distorted
at times. the musick was ok but it got too disco-y for my tastes. there
is the side room, just as u enter, on the right. that was made into the
chill room and there was some really cool mello acid jazz kinda stuff. but
the musick selection was pretty inconsistent. towards the end of my stay there
i was desperately trying to find a vibe in either rom, going back an forth
between them. left about 4 am. i would say, i'd give it a bit more  chance
to develop, but was not charmed by it yet.

basically want to confirm what ovid said - a space in search of a

terrible (we heard simon for > 2 hrs and he utterly failed to excite
me - probably karmic retribution for my dissing him just a few days
before on sfraves).  the music in the smaller room was better - hip
hop-ish, acid jazzy... unfortunately the sound system there was
horrible... like an AM radio cranked to earsplitting volume.

i did like the space, however, and would go if they got DJs i liked.

Well, Chris, I was speaking more along the lines of hip-hop influenced
techno-acid, rather than vice-versa, but Mr. Jon D has informed us that
he's working on it...  Can't wait to hear what you come up with, Jon!  As
for acid induced hip-hop, I'd be interested to hear your stuff.  I have
definitely noticed some psychedelia popping up in hip-hop lately.  For an
example, check out Justin Warfield's album, it's awesome!  Serious tweakiness.

Actually, rumour has it that the new music coming from the UVC
trendsetters will be *doo-wop* fused with hard-acid-techno.
Can't wait to hear Jon & Mike belt out some "techno-wop" tunes.

Thanks for the props Chris!

THat's no 303 -- don't need no steenkin' Roland pap-crap, not me.
That's a Yamaha SY-77 voice I "programmed" -- consists of a digital
filter sweep and an FM parameter sweep controlled by a
breath-controller. Happened upon it quite by accient... With the
appropriate breath-controller gestures, can sound more acidic than a
full bottle of "visine"....

One of these days, I hope to have time for music again...

Yeah, maybe you guys can sing "feels good, feels good, feels good,
feeel so so good" in a doo wop styleee. :-)

I heard they played this song many times at Pukka house, causing many a
mouth to fill with mock-vomit as the crowd headed for the nearest
receptacle. That song gives me more pucker than Dizzy Gillespie's got

(89.7FM, Los Altos Hills, CA) on sunday afternoon (he was subbing for
DJ Spliff-Skankin). Early on in the show, he played this reggae/dub
influenced song that i've often heard played by varous SF rave DJ's
(e.g. Spun). The song is "Rockers" by "the Original Rockers" (or vice
versa).

THe DJ said this was off a brand new compilation CD from "Different Records",
Birmingham, UK.

Anybody know where I can pick this up in the SF Bay Area (preferably
SF, or Palo Alto). Or anybody know how I can mail order this?

I'd love to hear the other songs on this CD, if they're anything like
"Rockers" it'll be really good.

It's "Rockers To Rockers (come again)" by Original Rockers.

Different Drummer Records, actually.

>Anybody know where I can pick this up in the SF Bay Area (preferably

you can get it at Tweekin', or BPM...

>I'd love to hear the other songs on this CD, if they're anything like

unfortunately, it isn't.  in fact, i think it basically sucks except
for the two different mixes of Rockers To Rockers (you've probably
heard the other mix as well, Niels - it also gets rave play - in fact,
I think I played it at the last Liquid Air party).  the really good
tracks have already been released on the Ambient Dub CDs anyway.

Now, if you want some crazy techno/dub collision, check out Dread
Zone's album "360 Degrees" on Creation.  Also, the new Dub Syndicate
album "Echomania."

very surprised.  It was pleasant to attend a rave at the I-Beam.  I
have many fond memories of Sunday Tea Dances years ago there...
glad to see that the space is finally being put to good use.  I hope
to see more house music in that venue.

The street that inspired Barbary Lane begins with an M but I can't remember
what it is, it's right off of Jones Street though.

Bingo. I've walked through there several times. I'm pretty sure the actual 
house they use is somewhere else through (or built set). This was one of 
the first things I did when I moved here two years ago. Just had to find 
'Barbary' Lane. I almost rented an apartment there. Too bad it was $700 a 
month (eek) and a studio at that. Landlady: "now where did you say you

From: Elaine.Leffler@Eng (always wash your halo with mild soap and warm water)
(yes, i'm begging for your hard-earned $$) 

During the first week of May 1994, over 500 (closer to 600
at this time) volunteers will be riding bicycles on a 500
mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles to raise money
for the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center.
My sister will be among them, and is seeking sponsors at
this time.  The requested pledge is a $100 minimum but *ANY
AMOUNT* will be greatly appreciated (a thought:  pool your 
$$ for a group donation and fight over the t-shirt).  When was
the last time YOU got to wear a hundred-dollar t-shirt?  
There are several options for payment - Visa, Mastercard, American
Express, installment plans (debits from your checking account on
a monthly basis), etc.  

The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Center is the largest
and oldest gay and lesbian social services center in the world, the
largest provider of early AIDS care in Los Angeles County with 
3,000 medically indigent clients.  The medical services offered include
psychiatry, hematology, radiology, urology, dermatology, gynecology,
neurology, and cardiology as well as an AIDS pharmacy.  The center has
a Women's HIV Clinic where over 150 women with HIV get a continuum
of special care.  It is the largest HIV test site in the nation - 
14,000 are tested each year, half of all those tested are heterosexual.
80% of all who have tested positive for HIV in L.A. County have tested
at the Center. The Center provides AIDS prevention education/inter-
vention to over 25,000 individuals per year, has 184 full-time staff
and serves over 65,000 people each year.  Programs include legal,
addiction recovery, counselling, job training, 24-bed youth shelter,
AIDS education and a computerized AIDS Information Network with 
40,000 articles on AIDS/HIV.  For more information, please contact
California AIDS Ride '94 at 213 874-7474.

The people participating in the California AIDS Ride are making a
huge commitment, not just during the weeks of the ride but also in
the months to come, training for this event.  Please consider 
sponsoring one of the riders.  Contact me via email if you are 
interested in sponsoring my sister or obtaining additional information.  
Don't forget, many companies have a gift matching program (double
your donation!) and the Center is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization
which makes it eligible for most of these programs.  Please spread 
the word to anyone you think might be willing to donate some bucks
to the AIDS Ride '94.

Subject: New Moon party report
Status: 


I was at the New Moon party last night. I didn't get home from work until 
9:30pm, and it wasn't until then that I picked up the msg on my answering 
machine letting me know that the New Moon was happening.  By the time I'd
finished eating and cleaning up, it was 11:00pm, then I spent some time 
on the phone and finally hit the road at midnight. 

It was held on Dusty's houseboat in Marin, apparently it was originally 
intended that it be held outdoors but Mona told me that the generator 
proved unobtaianble at the last minute, so Dusty kindly provided a backup 
site on his boat.

It took me 45 minutes to get there from San Mateo, I hadn't been to this area
of Marin before, although I guess others among you are probably familiar
with Dusty's place, I seem to remember mention of his boat in the past.

I got there about 1:00pm (the directions were a little unclear to me) and 
there were 12 others there. Sorry, don't know who was on the turntables, 
I'm bad with names, although I was introduced to one or two of the DJ's,
who seemed to rotate every 3 or 4 tracks.

I spent some time talking to Mona and she told me they'd had a discussion
before the music had started up, talking about what they wanted to accomplish
with the New Moons, fellowship, companionship etc. Everybody physically
touched everyone else, too. She wants to hold more outdoor events in the
future and is particularly keen on dancing around a fire... In my conversarion
with her there was much talk of astrology, planetary alignment, revelatory 
dreams and other worlds.  I had to be at work today so I intended to leave 
at 2:00am, as it turned out that's when it wound down anyway, Dusty wanted 
to go bye-bye's, I s'pose, and it was too cold to hang around on a beach, 
which was the original intention for the post-houseboat timeframe.

The music was low-volume and I didn't get much of an opportunity to listen to
it, I spent a lot of time locked in conversation with Dusty's housemate on
his work in the computer biz.  That and hearing all about the closest planetary
alignment in Capricorn for 300 years.  What music I did hear was acid-y, lots
of 303 noise. I think there may have been some folks learning their craft
on the turntables as well (and why not) since some of the track/beat shifts 
were less perfectly aligned than the planets.

John, I would've been able to pick you up, (if you are somewhere on the 
peninsula, that is) but I didn't read your mail until this morning. Sorry.

Status: 


There is going to be a Billboard Dance Music seminar held in San Francisco
next week, from Wednesday 19th through Friday 21st.  It is being held at 
the Pan Pacific hotel.  I understand there are going to be DJ showcases and
various panels meeting during the day discussing various aspects of
dance music. 

A friend who is travelling from LA to attend tells me that Moby will be 
among those in attendance, and will be sitting on one of the panels. 

Does anyone have any info on which DJ's will be playing ? Or on any events
taking place in the evenings loosely connected with the seminar ?

My friend Sue spoke to the event co-ordinator (I have this co-ordinators 
name and tel. number at home somewhere) and asked her why SF was the
location.  Apparently SF is seen as where it's at right now, for dance music,
although Miami was also under serious consideration at one point.

This is the first such event to be organised by Billboard and it seems to be
proving quite a challenge to piece together. I'll have a look for the contact
number at home, if anyone wants to find out more.

for the record, here's more "rules" on what to send him

-------------------from ECHO in NYC (where Mark worked) 

Mark Abene
FPC/Schuylkill
P.O. Box 670
Minersville, PA 17954


He can receive no more than five paperbacks/six magazines at once.
I didn't ask at the time if that was five books AND six mags or
five books OR six mags, I'm sorry.  To be safe I would send two
packages until we know.

Hardcover books can only be mailed directly from a publisher or
bookstore.

You can send photographs but no more than 30 and no polaroids.
That's it besides letters.  You can send nothing else.  You can send
money orders instead of care packages and he can buy some things for
himself.

As for visitors, he can have no more than four at a time.  If other
people come down to visit they must leave the prison and wait their
turn elsewhere.  Anyone that wants to visit must be approved.  Mail
Mark that you want to visit, he'll get a form from his counselor that
he will send you -- you fill it out, send it back and the approval
process begins I guess.

The person I spoke to thought Mark could have no more than 20 approved
visitors but she wasn't sure, she said Mark could find out for sure from
his counselor.

Subject:  New Moon Party Report.
Status: 

I went to the New Moon party last night.  Here are my impressions:

The night started off rather slowly.  We called the information line
around 7 pm and found that they were having difficulty finding a
generator for their outdoor space.  In any event, we were told to
call back a bit later, sooner if we knew someone with a generator.

So, we relaxed and wondered if the event was going to go off over a
bite to eat.  We called again at 8 pm and learned that they found an
indoor space for the party, so didn't need a generator after all.
This was happy news for us, so Jen, Steve, and I piled in the car
and set out on the trek from San Jose.  The indoor space was a three
story houseboat in Marin.  What an incredible space!  They had a
nice fire going in the fireplace and a view out over the water.

We were among the first to show up (10:30ish).  The DJ's hadn't
arrived yet, but the hosts had some decent trippy music on the
stereo.  We chilled in front of the fire and became familiar with
out hosts:  Dusty, Mona, and Allison.  The topic of conversation was
mostly centered around what they wanted to accomplish by holding New
Moon Raves.  This included a good deal of astrology (I understand
that Dusty is an astrologer by profession) - a topic that I've not
been exposed to very much which made it quite interesting.

After a while, the first DJ and his friends showed up.  His name is
Brad - I've never heard him before, but he's really nice and played
a good set.  (I'm quite musically ignorant, so I can't comment on
the different types of music styles that were played.  I generally
tend to put music into two categories - The stuff I like, and the
stuff I don't.  My deepest apologies to those who would have liked
more info on this aspect.  Jen is much more musically inclined, so
I'll try to get her to review the music...) He set up his equipment
and got started.  At that point, there were maybe 10 people there -
all really friendly.

There wasn't a whole lot of dancing energy in the group, but the
time was well spent in meeting and getting to know new people.  Over
the next hour or so, Brad kept spinning while we talked, danced a
bit, and ate LOTS of candy while people slowly trickled in.

Eventually, another DJ showed up and took Brad's place.  I've not
followed the DJ scene that much, so I wouldn't be able to recognize
anyone, but I do know names and such from fliers, etc.  Therefore,
you can imagine my surprise when Brad told us that the new DJ was
Robbie Hardkiss.  Robbie recognized that the people at the party
were in a pretty mellow mood, so he played some really good ambient
stuff that fit the mood of the party perfectly.  I didn't pay too
much attention to the DJ's after that, so I'm not sure who was on
after Robbie.

At about 1:30, the three of us decided that we should be heading
back to San Jose.  All three of us had to be at work by 8 this
morning and the hour and a half drive back to SJ would give us
enough time to catch a decent nap before getting ready for work.
So, we thanked our hosts and headed home.

So, here's my overall impression of this New Moon Rave:

1.  I'll definitely be at the next one!

2.  Even though not many people showed for this one, the vibe was
great and the people were very nice.  I really enjoyed the
difference from the massives that I've been attending lately.  It
was great to break from the pattern that we've created for ourselves
in that we'd rarely meet new people at raves because we generally go
with a large group of 15 or so friends.

3.  I think that this is an event that is worth supporting and
expanding.

Jen, Steve, and I had a really good time at the New Moon Rave and am
looking forward to the next one - with a few more people attending,
these can be an incredible event.  Mona has some interesting plans
for outdoor spaces that promise to be exciting.

That's all for now, I hope to meet many of you at Friends and Family
this weekend!

PPS - Paul, you must have been the person who arrived right before
we left.  I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to meet you as I was
in a pretty deep conversation with Brad.  I hope that we'll meet
sometime soon.

vivianm asks.....

>What is phone phreaking?

Ahem!!  And I thought *I* had the bozo award for asking about where
I can get a car window for my Toyota...   Phone Phreaking is the
act of exploring how the telephone network works.    The authorities
frown on these things,  but in the true sense,  it is LEGAL provided
that you don't solicit free phone calls from the system.    Just dialing
up numbers to learn where they take you,  as long as you are not
malicious shouldn't be illegal.   usually while phreaking,  it is 
common that one might discover holes in the system that might allow
for one to make free calls.    But for the most part,   phreaking is
just dialing up numbers,  usually non-standard prefixes,  to see who
is at the other end.   One can find test numbers issuing tones,  and
special computer access numbers for phone company internal use.  Most
of which are useless to the casual phone hacker.   Hope this answers
your question.... From the horses mouth :-)

Phiber was a phone/computer hacker busted by the new NY computer law,
and was one of the first cases prosicuted under this new law.    People
say that he was made an example of (Similar to what happend to me about

Phiber Optik was/is a phone phreaker- someone who explores/abuses
(depending on your viewpoint) the phone system. There are ways to redirect
services, tap services that are usually only available to telephone tech
crews, get free calls, etc. if you can figure it out. (Now a lot of this is
computer aided, and so it crosses into cracking, too.) Phiber Optik gained
a pretty big rep as being damn good- he is a big part of the 2600 scene (a
magazine/club into phreaking and computer hacking and the like), and is
very respected in those circles. He was busted for phreaking, pleaded
guilty (they had him pretty well, from what I hear), and in now in jail for
it. A big community figure, and *really* smart and (sorta) likeable. The
case got to be big news, mostly because of him. It just highlights a lot of
controversy around people who know too much about telephony and computers
getting in trouble for it. So no, it wasn't exactly consentual ;).
check out the alt.2600 newsgroup for more info.

Well actually John I take offense to your reply above.. but since the subject

regarding the original post, and not bringing the subject up in the first

Busted for phreaking? Let's say I am unfamiliar with the term. Would
that be a euphemism for, say, gaining administrative privileges on the
phone network? Perhaps theft of services, too? Perhaps non-invasive
yet unauthorized network switching?

I've been a hacker and been around many hackers and crackers in my
time. One or two got busted even.  It was pretty much understood that
they didn't want you breaking in, you knew they didn't want you in,
and they knew you knew. If you got caught, you got busted. Those were
the rules of the game; we didn't pretend we were justified in breaking
in if it was "in search of knowledge". We hungered for forbidden
knowledge, and we enjoyed the thrill, and we knew the price of
carelessness.

A lot of people view their systems the same way they view their homes.
If you walk in or break in--harmless or not--uninvited, you're
committing a serious trespass. Whether or not it's an appropriate
analogy, they feel that way. We *should* be exercising the Golden Rule
here.

No, I don't think he should have gone to prison. There are too many
murderers, robbers, rapists, and wife beaters still enjoying their
freedom while Mark sits in a cell. Perhaps some strong measures were
in order, but prison? No. A whole hell of a lot of community service
would have been much better. And God knows I have no love for The
Phone Company.

But I don't think Mark should be completely exonerated. He broke in,
and encouraged a lot of others to do same. He deserves our sympathy
for his cruel punishment, but not for what he has done.

	Right on.  Seems to me that he might have made such dangerous
activity seems really cool to some who weren't as well equipped as he
to handle the risk of what they were doing. 

	But it just kills me to see somebody with talent caged up in
jail.  My mind spins thinking of what "community service" from someone
like that could have done.  Oh well.

I've been back in socal a couple days now so here's my belated SF trip
report:

Got in tues. (28th) night somewhat excited about checking the FMR.
After getting the location around 12:30 and finding out that it was an
hours drive from the city and wouldn't be starting until 2 I started
having second thoughts, mostly cuz the friend I was staying with had
to go to work the next morning.  It was unfortunate to find out that
it didn't happen but I was relieved that we didn't go.

Thurs. night dana and I headed over to Spacelab.  The music varried between
very good and obnoxious, some of it was a little too stomping for my
tastes but there was also some really good acidy stuff.  It's a
bargain for $3, and it was fun hanging out and meeting new sfravers.

It was difficult figuring out what to do for new years since there was
so much going on.  We were going to head over to mission rock but
ended up going to wicked cuz some other friends were going.  Since
we arived early it was $20 instead of $25 (still pretty steep, I heard
it was only going to be $15), but it was worth it to me.  The location
was amazing, a large parking lot under a freeway downtown.  There was
also a 3 or 4 level building that had another dance floor as well as a
chill room.  The only real compaint (besides the cost) was that is was
really cold outside, especially in the morning.  Most didn't seem to
mind though.  Also the security at times seemed a little rough, at one
point when everybody rushed the fence a girl who was climbing the
inner fence was either pushed really hard or hit by one of the
security guards about 10 feet away from us, this brought the vibe way
down for a while.

The music got really good after midnight.  I'm not sure who the dj was
but I recognized him from Tweekin' (Gavin?), his set was really good.
I also enjoyed Garths set, althogh it wasn't as good as when he came
down to Irvine a couple weeks ago :) Jeno was good but at times
it was getting too vocally for my tastes.  I'm not sure who the other
dj's were but things got really crazy around dawn and the view of the
city was amazing, we headed home around 8ish and it was still going
off pretty hard.  I wish I could've caught Dub Tribe though, I didn't
know when they were going to play and the line to get inside was
long...

The rest of the trip was mostly spent relaxing and record shopping.
Tweekin had a pretty good selection as well as Primal.  Also recently
reopened Record Rack in the castro had a pretty decent import
selection, they mostly carry pop-house and disco, but I found Sabres
of Paradise's Smokebelch II 12" (which I've been looking for) as well
as FSOL's Papau New Guinea and a couple others.  I picked up a lot of
used vinyl at streetlight, they've got a good used cd selection too (a
friend picked up YMO's technodon II (orb remixes) and the Space
Bootleg ($4!) in the bargain bin and some other great stuff) Also
there were about 15 vapour space promo 12"s on FFRR for $1.98, grab it
if you haven't.

It was a great trip, I hope to return soon...

Andy

Yea!!  And the Irony of it is that Phiber is probably sharing his
hacking secrets with white coller embezzlers,  terrorists,  drug
dealers,  and the very people that shouldn't HAVE hacker technology.
Gack!!  Talk about shooting ones own feet!!  - Instead,  he should
me doing comminity service,  helping the government by fixing their
computer software problems (Under tight supervision of course).

I might bring your attention to a rather interesting post in
"alt.2600" by Emmanual,  editor of 2600 Magazine,  who wrote a
rather interesting piece on Phibers last day of freedom.  Check

garage/AcidJazz/Rap...)
Of course, Detroit for techno, chicago for house, miami for garage,
SF for ?, New york for house+hardcore will be a good choice :-)
but no limitation...
We, European would understand more about US scene, so, explain us!!

                          Underground rave-magazine

                                  ISSUE #1

                       Release date: 10th January 1994


         Why a text version of PLANET-E ?
         ================================
         Yes, this mag is supposed to be an Amiga mag. But, due
         to the fact some reporters haven't this computer,
         I decided to write the mag in a text file. The mag will
         be available in the future in an IBM pc version too. So,
         check it out!
         Of course, a 'full' computer version (amiga/pc) is
         better, because there are music and pictures :-)
         Hope this mag will be read by all the internet ravers,
         so, spread it around you! ;-)
         Now, the following text is the same as the one used in
         the amiga and IBM pc versions...
         Sorry for all the english writing faults which are still
         in the articles! I didn't correct them all due to lack
         of time (and because I'm so lazy!) but the comprehension
         is ok, even with those faults ! :-)
         Now, just two words about this specific version.
         Here, we can't have menus, sub-menus as in a 'full'
         version. So, here's just the order of the different
         sections.
         First, we have the Editorial and then the articles in
         the following sections: Events reports (sorted in a
         chronological event order), The Scene, Clubs,
         ep/lp/album/cd reviews, Drugs.
         After that the 'How to be a reporter' section and the
         'Reporter list'. Please mail me (I'm Psyched, the
         redactor of this mag, look at the email address in the
         'How to be a reporter section')to tell me your comments,
         ideas, and of course write articles! ;-)
         Contribute to this mag, and the idea about an
         international rave-mag will be a reality! (I hope so!)



         Editorial
         =========
         Hello everybody! Welcome to the 1st issue of the
         Planet-E mag! With this mag, we would like to provide
         you some articles of the whole planet (I should say the
         rave-planet). This mag is 100% international, 100% dance
         and 100% non-commercial. (I hope so!)
         We want to make it the most underground and
         international possible, because we think it's great to
         have some other points of view about rave-culture.
         Rave-culture is not only techno and hardcore, even if
         those two styles of rave-music are dominent in some
         countries; we want to follow the new way: the unity of
         dance-musicS. Even if in this issue almost all the
         articles speak about techno or trance, we want to speak
         about ALL the dance-musicS. I mean techno/trance/
         hardcore/gabber/mellow/jungle/house/garage/progressive
         house/rap/acid jazz... This mag is yours, every article
         which is related about non-commercial dance-music will
         be published.
         The views expressed in this mag are the views of the
         respective reporters and aren't necessarily shared by
         the mag and its staff (especially articles speaking
         about drugs).
         So, write what you feel...
         How to write articles? Read the 'How to be a reporter'
         section please. Please send us your comments, critics
         and the features you would like to see in futures
         issues!
         The next issues will be out AS SOON AS WE HAVE ENOUGH
         GOOD ARTICLES. So, it's you who choose when it will be
         out again! I'm waiting for your New Years Eve
         articles!! :-)
         I hope this mag will make you,non-ravers, feel inclined
         to go to a rave and see how great it is!!
         Finally, I want to say a BIG Thanks to all the people
         who have contributed to this mag: Idea, Jam&Spoon and
         all the reporters!
         And of course, thanks to all the readers and futur
         reporters too! :-)
         Ok, that's enough!
         Now, read the mag and enjoy it! (I hope! :-)

         Energy'93 Techno & House festival
         #################################
         ******* Party: ENERGY'93 festival & Streetparade
                ******* Date: Saturday 28th August '93
                       ******* Where: Zuerich / Switzerland

         hello Everybody!
         On 24th August'93 a big house/techno festival called
         "Energy'93" was held in Zuerich (north-east
         Switzerland).It was the biggest rave event ever
         organised in Switzerland.The festival comprises the
         party itself and the Streetparade,which is similar to
         the Loveparade held in Berlin.
         Let me start by the Streetparade.
         On this day, the weather was not very good.A lot of
         clouds and the temperature was a little bit cool. But,
         fortunately, contrary to previous days,no rain!
         The Streetparade began at 3.30pm, and the meeting point
         was a square in the center of Zuerich, near the Station
         and the mercantile streets(big banks,smart shops,etc.).
         I arrived at 3pm at the Station and they were a lot of
         party people all over the streets! It was great to see
         all those people during the day!  Finally, I was in the
         Swiss-techno-paradise !! :-)
         3.45pm, the first float arrived;a much more people came
         from the neighbouring streets!
         Only a few people followed this float, the rest waited
         for others to following ones. About 15 floats followed,
         at five-minute intervals. Each float had different
         music, so, each person could find his own style
         (hardcore,trance,breakbeat,house,garage,techno,mellow)
         I, naturally, follow the breakbeat one! :-) There were
         a lot of curious spectators. It was funny to see how
         surprised they were!ahahah Yeah, more than 20'000
         people were dancing on the steet,that's quite amazing!!
         Almost all the party dj's were on the turnetables to mix
         quite good music... The procession continued and joined
         the terminal point at about 7pm. Hehe, people were now
         ready to eat some food which would give them the extra
         energy for the party...
         The party officially initiated at 7.30pm and the first
         dj began his mix at 8pm.
         The place for the party was the Hallenstadion. It's
         Switzerland biggest indoor-venue!
         The party place was composed of 3 dance floors :
         DANCEFLOOR 1 MAINHALL : Techno, Trance, g-hardcore
         DANCEFLOOR 2 TRANCE-TUNNEL : Trance, Ambient
         DANCEFLOOR 3 GARAGE-GALLERY : Garage, Underground
         CINEMA: science-fiction & cyberspace
         The mainhall is in fact a big cycle-racing track!!
         The cinema, cloak-room, and other various stalls were in
         a big outside hall totally up to standard for throwing
         parties!! Waouw, I was in a real dream!!
         Now it's the time to speak about dj's and music!

         SVEN VATH (Frankfurt)      MIXMASTER MORRIS (London)
         APHEX TWIN (London)        LAURENT GARNIER (Paris)

         GARAGE-GALLERY:

         8 Swiss dj's including DJAIMIN (he made a hit called
         'Give you')

         Isn't the list quite a-m-a-z-i-n-g ?!? If you know the
         dj's you must admit that it's almost impossible to do
         better! :-)
         At 9pm, when I arrived, the mainhall was already full at
         about 70% of its capacity. The light was almost
         inexistant (there were only big fluorescent frames with
         objects on it directed towards the crowd). The scene was
         quite big and the dj was on a kind of pyramid (to give
         the impression he's a god! :) with a big screen (20*8 m)
         behind him! The dj's and the lives, because they were
         very numerous in the mainhall,changed every 30 minutes!!
         Let's continue with a chronological review
         ***** DJ Noise - DJ Jeff - Gangsta ******
         yep, Swiss dj's... I can't tell you a lot about their
         set because I wasn't on the place early enough :)
         ***** DJ Tom *****
         Not too bad, but I expected more from him(never listened
         to him before) as he comes from Frankfurt... But it was
         fair.
         ***** A.Utomatic S.Ound U.Nlimited (live) *****
         Hmmm... what I could say?...It sucks!! Yeah, the music
         is hardcore, but bad and boring hardcore (it's only
         chaos). They had their own MC, and she was quite bad!
         (no feeling).
         ***** Electric Indico *****
         Right now, it was 10pm when she start. Yeah, she was
         the only women dj in the night... Not very good
         ***** Max Durante *****
         Perhaps you know he's the producer of Automatic Sound
         Unlimited on ACV records. He played also bad hardcore,
         but technicaly, the mix was ok. Don't move your ass to
         hear him...
         ***** Illuminate (live) ******
         Right now, the music had really change, the party begans
         really.
         The light show was coming to grow up. Illuminate do
         jungle tunes without the breakbeat!!!Just a techno beat.
         Very cooool. Hehe, the last tune was a 'full'jungle one,
         yeah, the breakbeat comes (I was waiting for it! :-)
         ***** Colin Dale *****
         Everybody knows him!! One of the techno leaders in the
         UK... As usuall, he played great techno. The lasers
         begans to move at this point.
         ***** Kenny Larkin *****
         Nothing special... It was techno from detroit.... nice
         ***** DJ Hell *****
         All the german people were waiting him... hehe, lot of
         shouts when he began. He made an intro, so 30 minutes
         were short for him.. He played some cool trance.
         ***** Structure (live) *****
         Getting more acid with them! A great live!!!
         ***** Jeff Mills *****
         Now, it was time for the god! In facts, I didn't know
         exactly when he begans (1.30am) because he mixed so well
         his first record with the last tune of Structure !!
         The light show (laserstorms) was GREAT at this time!
         He put the ravers in a real trip with his hardtrance.
         And his mix was quite superbe! He changed everytime the
         records. He didn't let one more than 2 minutes, and in
         less of 6 secondes, he can set the pitch and put the 2
         rhythms together!! In facts he was the only dj who tried
         really to do a spectacular mix. His scratches were
         really amazing(he just did one fault, but who cares?!!!
         :-) To resume,I can just say one thing: he's probably
         the best underground dj worldwide!
         ***** DR Motte ******
         This famous dj (he's created the Love Parade) didn't
         play the best side of german techno/trance... Yeah, not
         a great moment in the party, but not too bad :-) (I mean
         he's not a great dj)
         ***** Frankie Bones *****
         He played techno, nothing more (hmmm... sincerly, I
         can't remember his set very well :)
         ***** Aphex Twin/Polygon Windows (live) *****
         The fifth first minutes were slow (and boring), and then
         the music cames hardcore, but also noisy. I expected
         more from them! One (with A.S.U.) of the badest live of
         the party :(
         ***** Lenny Dee *****
         Quite hardcore (the hardest of the night, with Max
         Durante). Less noisy than Durante but still boring.
         At this time I was upstairs on the ledges, admirating
         the most beautiful seeing one could hope!
         There were a lot of laserstorms. There were 6 columns
         2*2m and 8m height placed on the dancfloor's
         circumference. Inside there were strobos!!! One of the
         best visual effect I ever saw!!
         ***** Source (live) *****
         Yeah, I love Source! Really very good techno (I think
         they are one of the best techno composers). All the
         ravers were raving (it's the best word I could find!
         hehe).It was really a great trip,believe me!
         ***** Dave Angel *****
         A very clear mix. And he played very good deeptrance...
         yeah, he's one of the leaders of this style of music in
         Europe (I could say on the planet!), why do you think UK
         ravers tell about him 'Is he a man or a god?'!!!
         ***** T-Bass *****
         This one is a international swiss dj (he played in
         knowledge/London, in some German and Parisian raves).
         He played the more commercial stuff at the party (I mean
         commercial in comparaison with the other sets!).
         ***** Arpeggiators (live) *****
         Another group from Frankfurt! Yeah, I hope you know
         them!! If not, go to buy their lp's!! Simply excellent!!
         (no other comments are necessary! :-)
         ***** 303 Nation (live) *****
         And another one from Frankfurt! A less good as
         Arpeggiators but very good too!
         ***** DJ Edge *****
         Cool techno... At this point, they are less people on
         the dancefloor, it seems that a lot are gone in the
         ledges to wait the afterhours :-)
         ***** DJ Mao *****
         Swiss local dj. I can't really remember...
         ***** Laurent Garnier *****
         The last set of the party...
         I was waiting him, because I like his cool mixes, good
         deeptrance. But I prefer a little more Dave Angel
         (perhaps,because they were more people on the dancefloor
         when Dave Angel played :)
         ***************************
         MC Orson X was really great! (That made me remember all
         those MC's on my british hardcore tapes!!! :)

         I can't tell you more about the other halls. I was 1
         minute in the TranceTunnel, but it was far too warm!
         A lot of people were in there(waiting for Sven the Guru!
         ehehehe).
         And I didn't go in the Garage-Galery, because I know
         already the dj's in it and I don't like them at all!!
         (hey, I not made 300km to hear fucking garage and
         underground!!!)

         I didn't go to an afterhour, yeah, I was really
         shattered. There were 2 afterhours organised with the
         festival from 6am to 2pm. One garage-underground, and a
         techno/trance one with Sven Vath, Laurent Garnier,
         DJ Hell, Jeff Mills, Colin Dale, DR Motte, Gangsta and
         Noise!!!
         And after these  you could go to another techno
         afterhours (not organised by the same ones) from 4pm to
         2am!! Yeahm, you could party until Monday morning hehe.

         Conclusion:
         Really the best party I never been to (but you expected
         that, huh?! :-) Raving by day on the streets is also a
         different thing, it's quite exciting, really. For me, it
         was surely the best party ever held in Europe (except UK
         of course :). The people were really cool (German ravers
         are cool!), the crowd was dancing continuously.
         About 24'000 people were at the party! a-m-a-z-i-n-g!
         My last words : YOU MUST COME TO ENERGY'94 !!!!!!!

         1 Year BonZai records
         #####################
         Name: 1 Year BonZai Recordz !!!
         Where: "The Extreme" (Affligem/Belgium)
         Date: Friday 1 October 1993

         For the ones who are from Belgium, I don't think I've to
         introduce this label, for the others, Bonzai is the
         biggest and absolutly the famoust record label here in
         Belgium, so it's rather normal that there where many(too
         many) people presented at the "1 year Bonzai party"
         Like I've said before, the party was at "The Extreme"
         and for the ones who know that dancing, it's to small
         for such a party. (maximum capacity for 2500 people).
         We've had to wait more then half an hour to get in, but
         it was worth it!! When we were finally in we've had our
         12 inch. Yes, that's right. The first 1000 people who
         arrived at the party got a 12 inch with some new Bonzai
         recordz, called 'The Anniversary Rave' ofcoz.

         The Dj's that night were...
         - Lenny Dee (Industrial Strenght - New York)
         - Paul Elstak (Rotterdam Recordz)
         - The Fly(Bonzai Recordz(the BIG boss of Bonzai recordz)
         - Franky Jones (Cyberdelia - D.M.C.)
         - The BountyHunter (Bonzai)
         - Deg (Bonzai, B.W.P. Experiments, Rave Explosion)
         - Frank (Zolex, Globe)
         - Franky (Cherry Moon)
         - B.B.Bell (Say No More recordz)
         And warming up by Dj. Steel.

         I can't tell much about this party, coz they didn't say
         who was playing the recordz, I mean there was no
         presentation, too bad.
         There was also a live act, from "Dream Your Dream" (from
         the very famous Bonzai record, better know as
         jjjjiiiiiihhhhhaaaaaaaa)(The same guys gonna do a live
         act on MayDay 5 !!)
         The live act was pretty good, nothing special to say about
         this one.
         I suggest if they organize a "2 Year Bonzai Recordz" party,
         that they do it in a much larger place, coz it was really
         too small!
         But after all, it was one of the better rave parties in
         Belgium.

         Conclusion
         ----------
         Nice party but they were to many people for such a small
         place like "The Extreme".

         This part above is taken from the flyer from "The Rave
         Explosion Part III". Pretty impresive eh?? So,
         I decided to go there...

         ** The Dj's **
         --------------
         On the MAIN STAGE => Techno - Trance - Hardcore

         ** Jeff Mills ** (Axis, Detroit/USA)
         -----------------------------------
         One of the best Dj's I've ever seen!! He is really
         amazing... I think there are no recordz he plays longer
         than 1 minute, and he mixes all the 'one minute' parts
         perfect.
         He was also one of the best Dj's on MayDay IV.
         (If you've been to Mayday 4, I think you already know
         enough)
         One of the top Dj's in the world of house if you ask me!

         ** Blake Baxter ** (UnderGround Resistance/Detroit-USA)
         --------------------------------------------------------
         Also a Dj's from Detroit, since there were some
         technical problems when he was playing, some things went
         wrong, but after a couple of minutes everyting was back
         ok, (for a couple of minutes heheh)

         ** Laurent Garnier ** (Fnac Music / Paris)
         ----------------------------------------
         He was the last Dj that played that evening and was
         absolutly the favourity Dj.When he played his first song
         (Melody - Beat your heart out) the crowd went totally
         crazy, and I mean CRAZY !!
         He played too more 'commercial stuff' if you compare it
         with the songs that the other Dj's played. I mean no
         'Usura' 'Dance 2 Trance' or '2 Unlimited'but songs like,
         "Wake Up" and "Beat your heart out". Togheter with Jeff
         Mills he was the favourite Dj of the evening.

         * Yves De Ruyter *(Bonzai Recordz,Cherry Moon/Antwerpen)
         --------------------------------------------------------
         Not as good as he used to be if you ask me.
         Since he had also a lots of technical problems many
         things went wrong.

         These where the Dj's I've heard, there where more Dj's
         like
         - Dano (Dreamteam - Amsterdam)
         - Deg (BWP, Rave Explosion - Brussels)
         and the Source Live (R&S Recordz - Sweden)
         But I haven't heard them since I've arrived rather late,
         and I've spent some time in the 'Chill-Out Room'

         ** The Chill Out Room **
         ------------------------
         Nothing special to say about this..Maybe just one thing,
         it was very cold there!! The music was good, the lights
         where not so good since all the best stuff was in the
         'Main Stage' Hall.

         Maybe some details now.
         - The service was good, but VERY expensive!
         - They've had many technical problems during the evening,
           especially problems with the music.
         - And the sad thing about 'The Rave Explosion III' was,
           that they closed the place at 05.00 Am, don't ask me
           why ?! Normally 'The Rave Explosion III' was from
           9.00 Pm until 08.00 Am, and then there was an after
           party in 'The Cherry Moon' but at 04.50 they said that
           they must close at 05.00 Am, and that there was an
           after party somewhere else, (somewhere in Brussels,
           sorry forgot the name)
         - There were about 7000 or 8000 people
           (not bad for a little country like Belgium, I think it
           was the biggest rave ever held in Belgium)
         - The presentation was also very good.

         Ok, enough about that. In my opinion 'The Rave
         Explosion III' was very good, one of the best parties
         I've been to (togheter with "MayDay IV", "The Big
         Cyberdelia Rave" and "1 Year Bonzai Party")
         I should say 'Come To The Rave Explosion Part IV' !!

         Conclusion
         ----------
         A very good party with very nice music. One of the
         Belgium biggest raves !!
         My score for this one is "9/10"

         Thunder Dome
         ############
         ****** Party: Thunder Dome
               ****** Date: Saturday 30th October '93
                     ****** Where: Zuerich / Switzerland

         hi everybody!
         When I saw the flyer of the party, I was immediately
         decided to go there, for one reason: Carl Cox and
         Loftgroover (Colin Dale was on the flyer also,but he
         came not) will be at the party!! I could suppose there
         will be some british hardcore (breakbeat,if you prefer),
         and when I hear that, I'm coming mad!! (unfornately,
         british is extremely rare here in Switzerland and in
         other countries also(hehe except UK,but you know that :)
         The party was held in the old military barracks, in the
         center of the city (that's very cool in Zuerich: almost
         all parties are in the center-city). The organisators
         are XTATIC, dissidents of ENERGETIC, who organized
         Energy93 (as you suppose it, they are the best
         organizators in Switzerland).
         It was supposed to be a 24hours party (Saturday 8pm to
         Sunday 8pm) but I don't know when it stoped :) (but WHO
         wants to be in the same hall 24 hours?)
         For several dj's in this party, it was their 1st
         performance in Switzerland.
         The flyer wrotes:'The former military facility will be
         transformed into one huge dancefloor.It will show you a
         cybernetic vision of our world in the year 2350'.
         Generally,experiences said me to not believe the flyers,
         but this time, it was ok :-)
         When I arrived, it was about 9.30pm (after 3.30 hours
         travel!). The barracks were very big (a big rectangle
         with a big court in the center) but only the right part
         was used, hmmm... it was a hall about 25*100m. Not so
         big, but enough to put 4000 ravers in it! This time,
         I believed the flyer, because it was really a vision of
         the future, perhaps only my own vision of future :-).
         Hmmm, how could I describe that? I should say that:
         when I entered, I couldn't see the faces of the people
         2m around me! A lot of smoke!! A lot of UV too, and some
         nice strobos!!
         The ambiance was very glaucous!!
         When I arrived, the hall was 50% of its capacity. They
         said also in the flyer 'multiscreen videoshow', yeah,
         in facts, there weren't giants screens,but multiscreens:
         a screen was composed by four 70cm screens, and there
         were 4 of those 'big' screens. But it was ok. I couldn't
         see the faces of the dj's because some lights (and
         lasers) were behind him, and with the smoke, there were
         simply dark faces :-)
         OK, now I give you the guest list (you was waiting for
         that! ehehe :)

         dj's:
         CARL COX (UK)*             LIZA N'ELIAZ (BELGIUM)*
         LOFTGROOVER (UK)*          MOGUAI (GERMANY)*
         PROPHET (HOLLAND)*         T-BASS (CH)
         C-H-T (GERMANY)            NAUGHTI (GERMANY)
         TEK-JAM (CH)               MANIAC (CH)
         PARA DB (CH)

         and the lives:
         GENLOG (GERMANY)
         CONFUSION A (SOLID PLEASURE CONTINENTAL) (GERMANY I
         suppose)

         CH = Switzerland if you don't know that :-) and the
         * means performing first time in Switzerland.
         Colin Dale was supposed to come but he didn't :-(
         ok, now, let's go with a chronological review:

         ***** MOGUAI ******
         I think it was him (not sure at 100%).
         Some 'normal' trance, like the one you could hear at a
         good party :-) Nothing, very special...
         ***** T-BASS *****
         Yeah, I know him. He's an international Swiss dj.
         Usually he plays some well known german trance, but this
         time he really impress me! He played more than usually
         on the underground way. He played even some breakbeats!!
         This was great,people! Really, a better set than Moguai.
         ***** NAUGHTI *****
         He comes from a little (?) club called 'Ohne-Worte'
         in Ulm, Germany. I heard it one time only. It was at
         the Streetparade. Yeah, I remember him well: he was the
         only dj who played some breakbeats!And of course,
         I followed his mix almost all the afternoon :-)
         One more time, he impressed me! He played some loud
         hardtechno, very great mix, and he played also about
         15 minutes of pure jungle (his set remained one hour).
         It's not useful to say you we were only about 20 to 30
         ravers moving like mads on his jungle tunes! Yeah,
         in Zuerich, as in France, Germany and everywhere (excpet
         UK, one more time!:-) people don't like breakbeats very
         much (some try to dance on but it seems they can't find
         the beat!). But I adore them! ehehehhe
         One of the best sets I heard for a long time!
         ***** GENLOG + CONFUSION A (lives) ******
         hmmm, I thought it would be better. In facts I heard
         Genlog 10 minutes and I've go out to search some
         Red Bulls (some multivitamin drinks which are illegal
         in Switzerland) to take more energy :-)
         Energy was important, because I knew that the hardest
         will come: Carl Cox, Loftgroover and Liza N'Eliaz!
         When I came in, the 2 lives were finished.
         ***** CARL COX ******
         I have a tape from him and I must say it's not very
         good. So I only hoped he'll play some breakbeats,
         because the techno on the tape was bad. Shame on me!
         He played a lot of techno and some great one, waooooow!
         I was on my knees!!! Hard and sometimes acid: that was
         his beautiful set!
         Certainly, he played also some jungle (pure UK
         breakbeats, to resume) ehehe, with that, I were in
         paradise!!! You can't imagine that, I waited 6 months
         to hear some jungle in a big party!
         The mix was also great (I don't think he used the
         3 decks this time :(
         Conclusion: send me some tapes from him!! :-) ahahaha
         ***** LOFTGROOVER *****
         He played some hardtechno too, harder than Carl Cox set,
         but also more boring. Not great as Carl cox, but cool.
         ***** LIZA N'ELIAZ *****
         People, this is one of the wicked dj I ever heard!
         In facts, she's the wicked Female dj I never saw! :-)
         She played some wicked, not with loud basses, but speed
         hardcore. It's rare to hear no-boring hardcore, but this
         time it was!
         And the Zuerich crowd was getting mad! waoooow! great!
         Last but not least, the mix was perfect! What a crazy
         girl!!!
         ***** PROPHET *****
         This one comes from Holland (Mokum records).
         hmm... after a great set like Liza's one, it was very
         hard to do better. This one was far worst. Yeah, he
         played some more commercial stuff (but still hardcore
         stuff). I don't mean commercial,but it wasn't 100%
         underground too, as Liza set.
         I heard him 15 minutes and then, with some friends, we
         went to find the afterhours. Loftgroover (and we
         thought Carl Cox too, as Colin Dale wasn't there) was
         one of the dj's (they were the only 2 dj's of the party
         who were afterhours-dj's and have finished their sets at
         the party).The afterhours had to be in a club called
         Exit (usually a garage club), but when we arrived, there
         were nobody outside. Strange... We rang and a guy camed
         to tell us the afterhours were canceled, because not
         enough people were there.
         In facts, all the ravers were still at the party!eehehhe
         It was a shame, because we prefer to hear Loftgroover
         and Carl Cox than Prophet and the other Swiss dj's! :-(
         We tried to go to other afterhours places (not'official'
         ones from this party). After 30 minutes past to turn and
         turn with the car (it's hard to drive in this city!),
         we decided to turn again in the barracks.
         ***** Tek-Jam *****
         Now, Tek-Jam was playing. It was about 5.30am.
         Not a great set, simply some too usuall deeptrance.
         The people was getting slowly out and after an hour,
         when there were 50% of the people left, we decided to go
         out...

         Conclusion:
         A great party,but I excepted that.Could it be different?
         When some UK's top dj's are there, it couldn't be a bad
         one!
         I was very impressed by Carl Cox, Naughti (hope he'll be
         bigger on the international scene!) and Liza N'Eliaz
         (a friend heard her 2 weeks later in France, and he said
         me she played lame and boring hardcore! hmm...quite
         strange!!...).
         My rate: an easy 9/10

         An illegal party
         ################

                         PARTY - REPORT
                             OF AN
             ILLEGAL PARTY HELD IN AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND

                     DATE: NOVEMBER 13, 1993
                   REPORT BY: KiLLraVeN/MYSTiC
        
         Sorry dudez, but I have no flyer info about this party,
         I kinda rolled into it.  It didn't plan to go to this
         party, due to circumstances beyond my control 8-* I
         ended up there...

         It appeared that the party was held on a industrial
         field in the North of Amsterdam.  We got a lift from a
         guy who was standing behind Central Station in Amsterdam
         (we were supposed to get on a party/pendle bus that was
         driving all night between the party place and Central
         Station but we just missed it and got an offer from this
         guy).  He told us that the party was scheduled to last
         until 07:00 hours in the morning...
         Soon we arrived and outside was a big square formed by
         dots of lights spinning in the air, turning and turning.
         Now that was cool!  This is what we were looking for,
         the place was thumping and you could hear the massive
         sound coming from the entrance.

         Once inside we were frisked and we had to pay US$ 17.50
         to get in plus US$ 2 to get our coats safe :( But once
         we were passed the security the sight was awesome!
         The party place was a large hall (75 meters long and 30
         meters wide if not more) with some concrete pilars in
         the middle.  The whole place was filled with smoke and
         the sound was LOOOOUUUDDDD!  It was exactly what you
         could expect from an illegal party... tremendously cool!
         There was not much light, but the light that was there
         was enough, a few spots (coloured) two strobo's and one
         sun-flower.

         From the minute we got in until the minute we got out
         they only played hard hard hard hardcore, there was not
         _one_ slow song! I gues the average BPM was 200 or more!
         They played stuff like "Fuckin' Hostile" by Lenny Dee
         and "Bigger and Bolder"...  I can't tell you all the
         D.J.'s that were there because I have no flyer of the
         party, I don't even know the name of the party. But DJ's
         playing were:  Menthal Theo & Charly Lownoise and 100%
         Isis (female D.J.!).

         It isn't hard to imagine that soon my buddy and myself
         were jumping and raving around the building, really
         getting into the thumping sound of the drums and wicked
         sounds you could hear!  Although the place was crowded,
         there still was enough space to do some good raving, it
         was not like Hellraiser that you danced against each
         other.  You had about one meter around you to dance.
         They played the hardest and toughest numbers after each
         other and it was hard to stop, but eventually I had to
         quit because I really could do nooo more.  I went to the
         side to lean against the wall and check out the babes!
         ;-)

         And where there babes!  Several girlies were doin' some
         serious raving and didn't hide too much of theirself and
         they didn't mind you watching either.  There were one or
         two really good-looking girls, the ones that make you go
         'duuuuuuhhhhh...  can I eh...  can I ehh... can I ehh...
         offer you a ehh..  drink?' Hehehehe...  too bad though
         that most of them brought their boyfriend with them :(
         Ah well, I didn't come too find a luxious girl for some
         action, but to blow my mind out!

         Now you foreigners out there must be wondering what was
         happening behind the scene, esspecially the drugs,'cause
         this is after all The Netherlands! (How do you mean,
         'prejudiced'?) Ahhh... it wasn't much, nothing more than
         your usual party in Holland; people take some Speed or
         XTC and have a great time!  But you had to watch out for
         the security, if they catched you havin' some stuff, you
         would lose your stuff!  I girl next to me got three
         pills taken away, that is almost worth US$ 40!  I myself
         had not taken anything 'cause my supplier was ill (no,
         really :-/) and I don't buy stuff on parties 'cause then
         you don't know what you get!

         Later on the evening there was a live performance by
         Menthal Theo and Charly Lownoise.  Men, that sounded
         cruel!  The played live but it sounded exactly like the
         singles as I remember them, they play extremely well and
         do it with a lot of fun.  They played "El Gallinero" by
         Ramirez and some other famous stuff of them. People were
         really flipping on their performance, myself included!
         I started dancing again and didn't stop for quite a
         while...  but eventually there is an end!  Together with
         my friend I got some drinks and there we met two guyz
         from Alkmaar, not far from where I live.  They told us
         that the plug would be pulled at 6 o'clock...
         lame!  So we decided to get our coats while things were
         still quiet at the wardrobe and get back home!
         Easy said, easy done.

         The organisation was excellent 'cause outside a touring
         car was waiting to get us back to Central Station (and
         that was no luxury, the weather sucked major!).

         Now that I look back to it I must say that this was an
         excellent party and had a little extra because it was an
         illegal one. This concludes my party report and I hope
         you liked it.

         Where; The Extreme, Affligem Belgium

         The Guest List
         --------------
         "The Belgica Wave II" only invited Belgian Dj's, here's
         the list
         - Dj The Fly (Extreme-Bonzai Recordz-(Ex)Cherry Moon)
         - Dj Frank (Globe-Exterme-(Ex)Jerry's-WareHouse-
           Antler Recordz)

         - Dj Christophe (Globe - La Luna)


         The Live Acts
         -------------
         - DREAM YOUR DREAM (BonZai Recordz)
         These two guys have already give their show at the
         EXTREME on the first of October at the "BonZai
         Anniversary Rave". (They are also one of the live
         performers in the next MayDay!)
         They have already created the following hitrecordz:
         Dream Your Dream, Dreamland, Belgica Wave Part I,
         Traxcalibur, Belgica Wave II.

         - Krid Snero (Say No More Recordz)
         This guy is the creator of the remixed giant hit "White
         Line".
         For the first time in Belgium live on stage the master
         of the pumping hardcore KRID SNERO. So as you know this
         will be his debute on stage in Belgium this is a unicum
         and a privilege for the EXTREME and the BELGICA WAVE.

         Ok, now my opinion about The Belgican Wave II.
         When we arrived at the party-place "The Extreme",we were
         very surprised only 3 cars where on the parking place!
         So, we waited a couple of minutes in the car. After a
         couple of minutes more and more cars arrived, so it was
         time to get in. The entrance was 300bfr, when we were
         finally in the dancing, we stand for another surprise,
         there were only 20 people in The Extreme, so we waited
         again (I think about an hour) and then it began. Oh boy,
         there where more than 1500 people showed up in that
         hour.)
         All togheter I think there were about 2000 people at the
         party place.
         Now for the music, I can't tell you which Dj has played
         good or bad since there was no presentation, I only know
         "Stefaan" (Music Man) and I can tell you he played VERY
         good, very good songs and and excelllent mixing-
         techniques.

         - The live performances:  were also good, Dream You
           Dream was very good and also Krid Snero too (altough
           "Dream Your Dream" where the favourites)
         - The lights: nothing special to say about this, just
           the normal lights you can see every week in the Extreme.
         - The Crowd: VERY good, almost everybody was on the
           dancefloor dancing and flipping all night long...

         Conclusion; A very good party, we just arrived a little
         bit too early :-)

         Hardware 4
         ##########
         Name: Hardware 4
         Where: somewhere in Melbourne
         Date: probably in Novemeber

         After many hours of setting up the doors of Hardware
         finally opened. As expected there was a huge turnout and
         many were hardcore ravers who hit the dancefloor all
         night. The twin head laser entranced its audience until
         the unforgiving rays of dawn hit (yes I forgot My
         sunnies).
         Good looking Jumping Jack (from Sydney) pumped the
         trancing tunes out to us and made sure that insanity had
         arrived before Richie Rich hit the turntables.
         It was a brilliant night and the crowd loved it but I
         felt that some took it too hard.I definetely see another
         hardware in the distance.....Maby next Janurary.

         Aliens
         ######
         Name: Alien
         Where: somewhere in Melbourne
         Date: probably in November

         As we journey into the underground we are sprung upon
         by Alien.
         When strolling in we come across the extremely comfy
         chill area!!!! With its stinking seats and massive
         matresses which suited this atmosphere to a T. Tall
         glass walls seperate this from the intensity of the
         colourfull sweaty bodies that moved to the full-on
         hardcore sound of techno on the steamy yet packed
         dancefloor. The DJ's easilly maintained the hype until
         the sun came up and way beyond.
         Then there was the infamous rooftop chillout with the
         gravity defying ladder which proved to be a bit tricky.
         The venue, actually being some residence, was ideal for
         the insane which was definetelty a night of happy
         memories and total madness!!!!! I am definetely looking
         forward to the next Alien. Will you indulge????

         The Live Acts
         -------------
         Only 1 live act this evening,
         "Phrenetic System"

         Well, after the succesfull "BonZai Anniversary" Rave,
         "The Extreme" decided to do another BonZai party, well
         here it is, "The BonZai Users Rave".
         Well, as you can see on the guest list, very good dj's,
         so this must be another terrific BonZai party.

         The Dj's
         --------
         - B.B.Bell; hmmm nothing special to say about this one,
           played good.
         - Miss Djax; Hmmm not really my style of house-music she
           played.
         - Bountyhunter; Not as good as he used to be.
         - The Fly; Wwhhoow very very good !! Excellent (it was
           about time they not played some "good" recordz :-))
         - Cj. Bolland; Great!
         - Robert Leiner, Franky Jones, Deg (Haven't heard them....)

         The Live Performances
         ---------------------
         - Phrenetic System
         Nice! one of the best live acts I've seen.

         Conclusion
         ----------
         Well, like every BonZai rave in The Extreme there were
         again too many people for such a place (The Extreme can
         only handle 2500 Ravers). I think there were more than
         2500 Ravers hehehe. At a couple of moments I even have
         had some problems with breathing :-).
         I find it strange, The Rave Called "BonZai Users Rave"
         but I've heard only 2 or 3 BonZai Recordz ????
         Like every BonZai rave I'm gonna say the same....
         The Extreme is just too SMALL!
         My Vote for this Rave; 7.5/10

               The UnderTaker/Tragedy - Gent, Belgium



         The Scene
         =========

         Icelandic scene
         ###############
         CLUBS:
         At the moment there is only 1 decent club here in
         Reykjavik, it is called the Rosenberg Cellar (due to the
         fact it is under the ground) is used to be a part of a
         quite big club called the moonclub which was the hottest
         club for some time about 2-3 years ago. In Rosenberg
         they play Trance/Techno and people in there are in the
         18-25 years range.
         Another quite cool club is called Ingolfs Cafe. That is
         the ONLY garage club in the whole iceland and the dj
         there is the only garage dj in the contry. In that club
         most of the people snob are, it is not the underground
         style as Rosenberg. The third and the least is a club
         called Casablanca. There the dj (called Bigfoot and I
         wont mention him again :=) ) plays much too commercial
         music for our taste but there are quite a lot of people
         who go to Casablanca every weekend. But the TOP of this
         3 club list must be THE ROSENBERG CELLAR, if U are
         travelin in iceland contact us and we'll take U there,
         it is only a 200-300 people place but it is an
         experience to be there on a good night.
         RAVES: Recently there have been almost no 'illegal'
         raves here but last year (summer of 1992) we had plenty,
         but since the police are so fuckin aggressive on us
         about the raves people dont have the guts to hold 'after
         parties', as they are called now, because of the trouble
         they can get into.
         DJ'S:
         There are some VERY good dj's here in Reykjavik. I'll
         list 'em out in no particilar order.
         Gretar G    : Techno/Trance
         Arni  E     : Techno/Trance
         Margeir     : Garage
         Maggi 'lego': Techno/Trance
         Dj Psycho   : Techno/Breakbeat
         Agzilla     : Breakbeat/RaggaHardcore
         Dj Mercedes : Trance/Ambient/Acid Jazz
         Thossi      : Acid Jazz/Funk
         Hendrik     : Techno/Gabber
         Leon        : Varies

         The Dj's mentioned above are the more known ones here.
         I'll skip the young upcoming dj's that we'll hear from
         in the future.

         DRUGS: As in most contries (I think) extacy is popular
         but unlike most contries it is VERY hard to get and
         VERY expensive ('bout 30-40 lbs.)
         Easier to get is offcozz Amphetamin and in the fall
         it seems like everyone is eatin mushrooms, which for
         most ppl are free. People also smoke Hash and Marijuana
         which is fairly cheap. I dont think there are alot of
         people here that use cocaine due to the fact it is sold
         at and ridicilous price, I think :) ('bout 100 lbs pr.
         gram).
         And another very much used 'drug' is 'Rush' or 'Pops'
         which people sniff and it makes your head dizzy for
         about 1-2 minutes, great to use with the mushrooms and
         'E'.

         BANDS:
         There aren't alot of people who create music here but
         there are some. Bubleflies are the latest to do somethin
         worth noticing but they play Acid Jazz which isnt that
         popular here(Dj Mercedes is one of the main men there).
         Dj Mercedes also released the first 12" Vinyl that the
         icelanders released, along with his friend, it was a
         breakbeat white label and the band was called Ajax.
         Agzilla and Leon have released a tune on Reienforced
         label (breakbeat offcozz) and then there was an EP
         released in April/May with 3 bands,Gangland(that is us),
         Spaceman Spliff, and Passive aggressive. 2 years ago the
         bigest record company here in iceland released a
         compilation with dance music from the so called
         'underground' people here in iceland but it wasnt very
         good. Rumours say that a group that Maggi 'lego' and his
         friends are in is gonna release a cd soon(it is the BEST
         ambient music I've heard). And Gretar G and friends :=)
         are gonna release a 12" vinyl soon.

         FOREIGN VISITORS:
         We have had some people come here from the UK to play
         for us.
         Late in 1992 Adamski and Mr.Monday camed over but their
         equipment didnt come from New York so that was a
         disapointment, they only played some 5-6 tunes from a
         DAT (how lame can they be???).
         Baby Ford was better when he camed here in Jan/feb '93.
         He came with all his equipment :=) and it was a great
         night! :=)
         Ray Keith came in april and dj'ed the saturday night,
         with loads of people havin fun :=) and Dj Shakra has
         been here some 3 times or sumthin and is gonna come
         again. Freaky Realistic played a failure concert here
         on 20th of October but few people showed up and it was
         a failure. The things I have mentioned are only the ones
         that have been recently but in the past there have been
         other visitors (but I wasnt old enuff to be there :( ).
         RECORD SHOPS:
         There are two 'underground' record shops here, Thunder
         Records and Hljomalind. There U can buy and order almost
         anythin U want.. :) but since I dont have any money to
         buy records I dont spend alot of time checkin 'em out.
         :) hehe..
         RADIO STATIONS:
         There have been 'bout 4 radio stations that have had
         people playing the finest music available :) but on all
         the 4 stations there have been the same guys playing,
         that is my friend here Spoon and his friend. Now they
         are playing on a station called the X (fm 97.7)
         and there they get most of the previously mentioned Dj's
         to play a 30-40 minutes set and then 'the dj of the
         night' get's to play from 23:00-01:00.

         Italy and its trend
         ###################
         *** CHRISTMAS DAY AND THE DISCOTEQUES ***
         Christmas is near and the discos are preparing to
         welcome Santa Claus. The last 25th december into the
         Pascia in Riccione there was a cool crib with strange
         actors like Madonna's double in place of Our Lady and
         the 3 Kings carried gold, Chanel (the perfume) and beer.
         Ah.. Jesus was black! This year ouf of the Pascia there
         will be a big X-mas tree with a lot of condoms and
         slogans like "No War". In Rimini is born a new club
         called ECU European Dance, a mix  of all european
         fashions, it can to give hospitality to 3000  people and
         The MTV is its sponsor. Tina Turner'll unveil this new
         local where you'll be able to look some fashion shows
         (do U know the Ministry of Sound in London ?) and "live
         windows".

         *** 3 NEW DISCOS TO VISIT WHEN YOU'LL BE THE ITALY ***
         ICS (Disco Dinner Club) - Castrocaro(FO)
         It's builded into an old medioeval castle and you can
         find a lot of music kinds; on Monday '80 and '90 disco
         music; on Friday, Saturday and Sunday medioeval shivers
         with underground, funky and acid jazz.

         Il Maneggio - Romagnano Sesia (NO)
         3 rooms to dance trend music like garage and
         underground.

         Hippodrome - Magliano Alpi (CN)
         3 differents rooms with 3 differents kinds of music, the
         smallest with trend music (underground and rap),
         the medium with sperimental music and the biggest with
         fuck music (revival).

         *** THE MOVEMENT OF THE MOUNTH ***
         In Italy the first thing you must have care is your
         look; every kind of music has combined a kind of
         fashion. So if you decide to go to dance you must find a
         right dress. These are the TREND music and fashion.
         The new italian style is a meddly of techno sounds and
         beat house. The house is not died; it's shelved. A new
         sound is born, bad and melodious in the same time
         (like Robin S.)
         My personal enjoyment is the HYPNO-HOUSE, strange and
         paranoid resonances, maybe a bit singular, but it's very
         involvement.

         *** THE BEST 10 DISCOS OF NOVEMBER ***
          1) Prince - Riccione
          2) Pascia - Riccione
          3) Gasolyne - Roma
          4) Cocorico - Riccione

         London Techno Scene
         ###################
                       LONDON TECHNO REPORT
                       --------------------

                   [up to about 13th December 1993]

         Well, while dance music in general gains still more
         popularity, certain aspects of it get forced more under-
         ground.  The springing up of so many new artists can
         only be good for the scene as it keeps it moving on - if
         some aspects of the rock community did this, perhaps it
         wouldn't be so boring!  Most of the big rave
         organisations in the UK have now gone bust, are very
         quiet, or the people behind them have moved operations
         overseas, notably the USA. Exceptions include Raindance,
         who held an illegal rave during last summer,and Fantazia
         are holding a rave somewhere in the north of England.
         Over the summer, three 30,00 capacity events were
         scheduled; Big Love, Dreamscape and Fantazia, but the
         latter two failed to obtain liscences, Big Love having
         a meagre 12,000 attendance.  This was the final straw
         for Universe, who are supposed to have gone into
         liquidation - but are also organizing friday nights at
         London's Club UK in January.  All this does not mean
         hardcore is dead, tho' - it is now dark, underground,
         hard and fast - check out AWOL at the Paradise CLub on
         Saturdays, or Club Labyrinth in Dalston, who are
         currently hosting some '89 revival events in an attempt
         to recapture that old buzz.
         Jungle pretty much rules as far as pirate radio is
         concerned - Kool, Format, Rush, Impact, Index etc. are
         breakbeat only territory, Pulse F.M. still having the
         most musical variety, but still little techno.  This is
         partly due to Kiss F.M. hosting two weekly techno shows,
         Colin Favor & Colin Dale, but both have just been halved
         to two hours each.  On Friday nights, the only allnight
         techno venue is Deep Space, with Sabresonic finishing
         at 2:00 a.m. most weeks, both clubs doing very well even
         though their times overlap.  All this as the Aphex Twin
         (or Polygon Window, A.F.X, etc.) finally storms the
         national charts with "On",the first "intelligent" techno
         artist to do so.  So what the hell is going on?

              Well, it seems to me that there is a definite split
         in techno forming at the moment - the hard, HARD stuff
         is going still further underground, and can be heard at
         Tribal Energy and Spiral Tribe parties (dirt cheap, a
         must!), with DJ's like Az-Tec, Liberator sounds, Mr. Oz,
         etc playing.  Then we have the "intelligent" techno much
         loved by NME, including artists such as Sabres of
         Paradise, Reload, Future Sound of London, B12,Black Dog,
         and of course the Aphex Twin, gaining increasing media
         attention and musical credibility.
         There is also a new breed of sample-heavy techno-funk
         emerging from acts like FSOL and Reload,which could well
         attract previous followers of garage, hip hop and old
         ravers.  Wonder what the Bomb Squad would think of FSOL?
         Anyway, enough reading of the tea-leaves, on with the
         news!

              Big newcomers this autumn are without doubt the
         Sabres of Paradise, with their own group, record label
         and club, Sabresonic.  The man behind all this is none
         other than Andrew Weatherall, producer of Primal Scream
         along with Alex Patterson of the Orb.  The Sabres of
         Paradise debut album is definitely in the "intelligent"
         mode, ranging from near-ambience to dub, to straight-up
         techno.  No nosebleed stuff, just good tunes,
         "Smokebelch II" already a techno classic.
         "Deep Cuts", the Sabres of Paradise label compilation
         album carries this track, as well as clubby techno to
         songs with a real ravey vibe, not that "intelligent",
         and definitely having wide appeal.

              Along with them came the re-appearance of the
         Future Sound of London (FSOL), after silence following
         their massive "Papua New Guinea" and a deal with Virgin
         Records for stlg200,000,  as well as appearing under the
         name Stakker in the meantime, creators of the "Humanoid"
         anthem.  They came back with "Cascade" on October 25th,
         a 31 minute tune (thankfully split into five parts) that
         is magical; made up of weird noises, sparkling melodies,
         crackling breakbeats and a strange mix of analogue,
         ancient sounds and modern electronica.  They have also
         presented two (at least) shows late at night on Kiss FM,
         3 hour continuous chillout monsters, with no ad breaks,
         hundreds of samples, drifting in and out of tunes,
         melodies, beats and ambience, all with definite
         cyberpunk and multimedia influences.  This shit is
         extreme, on the edge of the new music.  Album out in
         January.

              Reload also experiment with multimedia, their debut
         double-album "A Collection of Short Stories" coming
         packed with exactly that, a little book of cyber-tales
         that can be read in time with some of the tracks.
         In the same mode as FSOL, but with their own flavour,
         one half of the Reload duo was the Aphex Twin's
         origional partner, and indeed there are Reload remixes
         of AFX's "On" out now.  Their album is excellent, one i
         know i will listen to many times, it ranges from cyberia
         to blissful, massively credible techno-funk, to the
         eco-stomp of "Mosh".  It is a definite milestone in
         techno, and the short story idea works well, too.  It is
         out on Infonet Records, who will be releasing a
         compilation double-album "Useability Now" in
         mid-December, have heard the preview on Colin Dale's
         show, and it sounds very good.
              As does the new GTO album, which not only features
         their own brand of stomping techno but also the odd
         bliss tune, which no doubt will have a wide appeal to
         the old rave crowd from the Carl Cox school of techno.

              More new vinyl definitely worth a look is the
         remix album of the Shamen's "Boss Drum", featuring mixes
         by Ritchie Hawtin, FSOL, The Irresistable Force, and
         others.
         On the subject of the Shamen, Mr.C's Plink Plonk records
         goes from strength to strength after its first release
         in January this year.  The emphasis is very much on the
         music, signing already publicised acts under pseudonyms
         so that hype does not effect sales (Rephlex records
         follow a similar policy).  The latest release is
         "Germination" by Underground Science, but be quick 'cos
         Plink Plonk tunes are snatched up very quickly in some
         of the cooler techno shops around!

         Deep Space, London
         ##################
         Deep space has two rooms the aim being to create two
         different musical vibes - one room is usually harder in
         a more acid trance style while the other is more ambient
         intelligent experiment effort.  Resident DJ's are Colin
         Dale and Colin Favor, marc and josh, brenda russell
         recent guests have included Aphex Twin, John Aqua Viva,
         Baby Ford, Dave Angel the list of quality names goes on
         and on...
          The emphasis is definately away from drugs and
         pretentiousness (A good thing in my opinion) and the
         entrance fee is six pounds which is very good for an all
         nighter.  My only gripe is the decor which is non
         existent.

         Megatripolis, London
         ####################

         -  stlg5/stlg3 concs, at Heaven, Thursdays 8-3 a.m.

              On the first (free) night of this event at
         Heaven 2000 people had to be turned away!  It is the
         only club i know of where they have a lecture at the
         start of the evening in one room. Subjects have included
         topics such as LSD, "scientific proof of life after
         death", chaos magick, quantum physics, Paganism in
         Britain, etc, all the kind of stuff you wish they taught
         in school!  Terence McKenna should be speaking here in
         the Spring.  Also here are blanket stalls selling
         underground magazines, books, tapes, jewellery, etc.
         It is billed as "the future perfect state", and is tied
         up with Fraser Clark and the rest of the evolution
         posse, creators of Encyclopedia Psychedelica amongst
         other things, it's a whole culture in a club.  Music
         is varied, tribal house to acid techno in the main hall,
         with a good "ambient cauldron" too (well, Mixmaster
         Morris looked like he was enjoying it!).  It's...
         different!!!  Check it out, miles of smiles, if you are
         losing your ego you won't find it here.

         Ministry Of Sound, London
         #########################
              Definately the best venue in London with a wicked
         PA this club has got much better recently.  There seems
         to have been a change in door policy, the pretentious
         types being turned away and the emphasis is on cool
         people who like to really party. Sad vicks sniffers and
         split skirters don't bother!  They also invested some of
         our fifteen pounds in some new decor, which is about
         time i'd say! The music policy is deeply progressive
         chunky funky techno house that bumps and grinds and is
         really cool to dance and trance to -
         Keep it up MINISTRY ;-)

         Sabresonic, London
         ##################
         -  every friday somewhere nr london dungeons.

              Walkin into Sabresonic is like walking into a
         blackhole (maybe) the venue is is an average sized
         cellar-like affair, the sort of seedy dive you know
         you're gonna love ;-)
         Sabresonic is Andy Wetheralls club, but for the first
         couple of hours we are warmed up by an accomplished
         guest Dj playing deep deep house... meanwhile the club
         fills quickly until it's rammed to capacity with punters
         who have only one thing in common - they r there to
         dance and keep on dancing.
              When Lord Sabre wields those wheels of steel you
         know abput it! the sound is loud the trippy visuals
         effective and the musik Funkin blindin
          "more mood swings than Liz taylor on detox"
          " the only rule is that there are no rules"
         This is not a club that is brimming with peace love and
         harnony, but its not for the miserable either... Hard
         music for hard times and a bit of a pick up joint maybe
         but the Sabrettes with their sleazy grins appreciate the
         good things in life; Sex drugs and Tribal acid techno
         house - then its 2:30 and time to move on, the night has
         hardly begun but we've done Sabresonic - from here we
         shall scatter throug- hout london like a virus
         spiralling out of control on a trance mission to spread
         the Knowledge (but KNOWLEDGE is another story).

         ep/lp/album/cd reviews
         ======================

         Sven Van Hees - Planet Jupiter 6 on Global Cuts
         ###############################################
         Three tracks in all.  Planet Jupiter 6 is solid trance.
         Very pleasant but nothing more.  Tropical Aftermath has
         a fast-paced discoey beginning.
         Then--2 or so minutes in--WHAMMO--a beautiful ambient
         break.  The beat picks up again but the disco is gone
         and you are in trance dance heaven.
         Then the disco returns, but the trance stays.  Ambient
         exit follows.
         Track 3, Opium Bliss is strong tribal trance.  So, outta
         five stars, I give it *** and 3/4.  (I'm a geek for the
         3/4, I know, but it doesn't quite get a four.  If that
         disco had been dropped, that's another story)

         Ohm - Tribal Tone (Sabre Of Paradise rmx) on Hubba Hubba
         ########################################################
         Many of us know and love the original Tribal Tone.  But
         how overplayed did it get?  And it's already had remixes
         prior to this(which I haven't heard). But wait a f---in'
         minute!!!  This is HOT!  Is this the same song? Did they
         put the wrong stamp on the vinyl?  One mix is a gorgeous
         wind-down-to-the-ambient-at-sunrise-with-your-body-
         sweaty-warm-and-relaxed tribal trance monster. The other
         two are energy-packed aural mountains.  They sound like
         they were recorded in a HUUUGE temple.
         And hey.  Don't be offended.  It's ok to get down in the
         house of your Supreme Being/s(or whatever that temple is
         for).  ***** outta *****

         Braincell - Hybrid EP on Harthouse
         ##################################
         3 trax.  Time Is Suspended (that's IT!  No more school
         for you). OK just Time Is Suspended--no remix title.
         Somewhere in the 150s, this is pounding acidish trance
         with cybals everywhere like bubbles in the whitewater
         rapids of a deep, small river.  And damn--the sexy fairy
         of that river occasionally surfaces with heavy breathing
         and a whispered word (I dunno what it is, tho), weaving
         her magic and drawing you into the water.  Sorry
         heterosexual women.  It's a female voice.  A cool track
         no matter what sex the voice, tho.
         Next track--Shapechanger:  Less absorbing than the
         previous track.  More of a mover.  Cool ambient break
         changes the mood and the stomping beats turn into
         floating beats.
         The last track is Nimrod.  Look out cuz it's got an ACID
         AMBIENT INTRO!!!
         Trancey acid or acidy trance.  Give it the label you
         want.  Oh yeah, and it's got changing tempos.

         The Jokers - Meitje on John Doe records
         #######################################
         Group:  The Jokers
         EP Title:  Meitje--6 trax in all
         Label:  John Doe records (this is 001)
                Up first(well, at least this is the side I played
         first) is Arrow of Death--'ARDCORE?  YES?!  'ARDCORE!
         YEAH!  Ok, so this song is boring when taken in its
         entirity, but in a small dose, it'll RIP THEM DISTORTION
         LOVIN' HEADS APART.  And I'm liking the sample, too.
         "The Black Arrow of Death"<------in a sinister voice
         "Yeeeeeaaaahhh!!!"<--------sounds like the ye-hah of a
         cowboy except the cowboy in question just shit bricks!
         OK so it's stale when ya read it.   Just hear it for
         yourself--then tell me it's not funny.
                 Final Countdown--minimalist run-o-the-mill
         hardcore.
                 Avasi-dodo--Long, drawn out schoolbell, beats,
         static, beats, sample.  "What the fuck is that?"
         "I dunno."  Dull hardcore, I say. My roomie tho, loves
         this track, and has images of a dj playing it without
         listening first and freaking out when the static pops up
         and all the other noises vanish.
                 Mietje--3 versions to chose from
         Remember how Arrow of Death left them skulls' innards?
         Well, you can pity whoever has to clean up after this
         song's thru...  Whereas Arrow of Death was good in small
         doses, this aughta be taken full-strength. Childish
         lyrics which might offend some, but hey, the rave
         version doesn't have 'em (unless of course Mietje is a
         reall bad word in Holland--but i dunno what it means).
         ****1/2 outta *****

         Ecstasy, instructions for use
         #############################
              The  medical research for this article is taken in
         the main from one of the same title appearing in
         Encyclopedia Psychedelica by Dr. George Greer, and also
         from many other sources, including the practical
         experience of myself and others i have talked to.
         ** It is intended to help those who will take the drug
         to do so safely, not to encourage or condone casual
         use! **

                                 MDMA SCIENCE
                                 ------------

           3.4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine,  MDMA, or "E" is a
         psychoactive (mind affecting) substance, usually found
         in the form of a white pill,  with or without a small
         logo embossed upon it,  but can also be found in liquid
         form,  and  "tab" form (a small square of paper soaked
         in liquid E).  It has been shown to alleviate certain
         psychosomatic symptoms,  and has also been demonstrated
         to help in the treatment of some mental illness,
         epilepsy,  depression, etc.- under the guidance and
         supervision of expert therapists.  However, as all
         research (official and otherwise) is banned throughout
         most of the Western world,  no research on long-term use
         has been completed,  although research is now being
         restarted in the USA, as well as LSD research in
         Switzerland.

              As  far as physical side effects go,  no serious
         ones have been proved (from a single dose), any reported
         minor ones (e.g. wide pupils) going in a couple of days.
         However, some research has shown that upping the dose
         does not greatly increase the experience (i.e, take two
         and you won't necessarily feel twice as good, after
         about four it doesn't make much difference,  you are
         just incresing the risks of side-effects).   It should
         not be taken by people with the following conditions;
         high blood pressure,  heart disease,  bouts of heart or
         circulation trouble (e.g. heart fibrillation or
         "flutters"), hyperthyroid conditions,  sugar diabetis
         (mellitus), hyperglycaemia, glaucoma, diminished liver
         functioning, actual or possible pregnancy, or during
         breast feeding.  Also, it should not be taken with
         anti-hystamine or bronchial treatments for hay fever
         or asthma (including cold cures), diet pills, caffeine,
         and above all Beta-blockers.  It would also be  wise to
         avoid use at the same time as anti-depressants, as well
         as other psychoactive drugs.

              Psychologically,  if you have suffered from any
         mental problems in the past,  including panic attacks,
         avoid E.  If not,  reoccurence of the symptoms can occur
         (called  an  "E panic").   ** Most importantly,  be
         mentally ready for anything, turn off your mind, and
         don't try to fight it because you can't! **
         For this reason,  NEVER EVER spike someones drink with
         E (or any other mind altering drug - people have been
         admitted to hospital after hallucinating vividly from
         being spiked with marijuana),  as if you are not ready
         for it, it can induce a panic with can lead to heart
         failure, even if the person has taken it in the past,
         with no ill effects.
         Possible side-effects include tightening of muscles
         (especially the jaw muscles), exhaustion following the
         experience for one or two days after, the urge to vomit,
         shivering, sweating, speech impediments, rolling eyes,
         widening of the pupils,  walking difficulties, nervous
         blinking, headache,  fainting,  distorted vision and
         geometric visual hallucinations.   Blood sugar levels,
         pulse rate and blood pressure may rise or fall and the
         ability to withstand pain are also reported (a friend
         of mine stubbed out a fag on his finger and didn't
         realise until the day after).   Emotionally,  the main
         side effects can be anxiety,  depression, lack of
         concentration or constructive thoughts altogether,
         which can all occur during or after a session.

                         PERSONAL E ADVICE - TAKING E
                         ----------------------------

         1:  NEVER DRINK ALCOHOL WITH E!!!!!!   That's how people
         die from it, usually from either dehydration or heart
         failure.

         2: Take it with people you can trust, your best friends.

         3:  Drink water to stop dehydrating, and if at a rave
         take a break from the dancing every hour or so for 10
         minutes,or you risk total body fatigue or heart failure.

         4:  Drink a pint of milk or eat some dairy products the
         day after,  as E takes calcium from the body,  and
         prolonged use (every weekend for a year or two) has been
         reported to induce brittle bone disease.  Also,  don't
         arrange to have your grandmother round for tea as you
         may well not feel in the  mood.   If possible,  stay
         with the people you took it with the day after, to "come
         down" nicely and talk about it.

                        PERSONAL E ADVICE - GETTING E
                        -----------------------------

         1:  IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL OR SUPPLY E IN THE UK, AND
         MOST OF THE REST OF EUROPE.   IN THE UK IT IS A
         "CLASS A" DRUG,  THE SAME AS HEROIN.   Whether right
         or wrong,  this is the law, and YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

         2:  E is more dodgy now than ever before,  it is hardly
         ever pure MDMA these days,  and is often pure MDA,
         which is more harmful to the body.   Some E's (such as
         some  "Lovehearts") are  cut with Ketamine,  which can
         be found in pure form as "Disco  Biscuits" - this stuff
         is generally thought of as nasty; effects can include
         total paralysation at high doses, as well as paranoia,
         rolling of the eyes, inability to speak or do much else
         except sit there off your face, really - not very nice.
         Some E's, often having the word "brown" in their name,
         are cut with heroin ("brown" being slang for H),
         sometimes referred to as "smack E's".  They are becoming
         increasingly common in the UK.  Some are also cut with
         Speed, LSD or Cocaine.
              So basically, if you are going to try E, buy it off
         someone you know or a type that has been recommended by
         a friend - but beware,  E's of the same name can often
         change in ingredients from batch to batch,  the first
         often being good quality to gain a reputation, the
         subsequent batches being crap.

                                THE FINAL WORD
                                --------------

              In summary,  look after yourself,  'cos the dealer
          certainly  won't!   Don't drink alcohol on it,  try to
          drink a pint of water an hour if at a rave and dancing,
          and take a break every now and then, and you should be
          OK.  Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK alone
          have had blinding times on the drug,  and their have
          also been a handful of reports  of  E-related deaths,
          but if you follow these instructions the possible
          harmful effects should be minimised -  but be prepared
          for suprises,  'cos every E is different and you never
          really know what is in that pill. It may even be stlg15
          worth of aspirin!
              If you want to read up on E some more,
          "E For Ecstacy" by  Nicholas Saunders is widely
          available in the UK and is impartial and
          unsensationalised.   It also has a lovely glittery
          cover, and costs about eight pounds,  so you and some
          mates could club together and buy it.

personally, i think Mark is an attention grabbing immature brat,
just my opinion based on dealings with him on BBS'
i HAVE defended him to a lot of people who think worse of him, tho

i think the situation is very much one thing

but Mark's situation is very much another

anyhow... we dont need half of alt.2600 forwarded here

Status: 


Well, let me start by saying I basicly agree with Dana's point that this
probably doesn't *really* belong on sfr. But...

If any of you are interested in a characterization of Phiber along with
alot of good observations and information about the larger social and legal
issues surrounding the use of and access to networks, like the one/s carrying
sfraves, check out an article by John Barlow in an old CPSR Newsletter.
It's in volume 8, no. 4 (fall 1990) and is called "Crime and Puzzlement".
It's old, but very well written. I've given this to friends whenever they
ask "What the hell do you do with internet?", and the like. If you're
interested, email me; I think I can get the ascii version somewhere.

Keep dancing!

Subject: Have new records - wanna spin!!
Status: 


Hi,  I'm about halfway through reviewing the records I got from this
UK record company called Irdial-Discs.    WOW!!  I'm really impressed
with the variaty of records.    Origionally I thought there were 10 
discs,   but learned there were more,  as some of the jackets have
2 disks in them.    Some are very "Housey",   120 BPM stuff,  others
up to about 155 BPM,  but most are around the 135 BPM range. 

As I am reviewing them,  I'm labeling the BPM's on each cut to make 
it easier for the DJ to select the appropriate cuts on the records.

It is my plan to bring them to the Friends and Family party on Sat
evening and spin them (Or have someone else spin them).

All this is new and refreshing stuff.   so look forward to hearing
and dancing to some new and refreshing sounds on Sat evening.

It's not an "impression", it's hard cold fact....  Take it from one
who was incarcerated,  and initially refused to talk about it,  and
almost wound up crippled for the rest of my life...  Obviously,  you
could not know this,  cause you were luckey enough not to get incarcerated
by the pigs.

Status: 




To all interested in the New Moon Raves:


I spoke to Mona (the coordinator of the New Moon Raves) today, and
told her of the interest among the Net regarding these raves.
So, instead of putting out her home phone number (too much traffic!)
she has listed the name and contact number for the NMR's in
a community newspaper called the "Great Day News".  But, I promised
her that I would post it here, for all of you crazy SF ravers!  So,
enjoy, and I hope to meet you -- either on Saturday @ 'Friends &
Family', at the next New Moon, or at any other rave!!
The information number is 415-267-3076.

Take care,


Jennifer   (GC.JXS@FORSYTHE.STANFORD.EDU  OR  415-723-4082)

Hello, Just thought I might introduce myself: I moved here to Morgan Hill Ca
from Stockholm Sweden to study for a year. While I lived in Sweden I used to
go to a bunch of Raves, Some big, some Small, but since I moved over here I
haven't been to ANY Raves (It's been 5 months). And ghod, are ravers hard to
get in touch with. Are we to be a dying breed????? 
Anyway's, I'm really glad I found out about this mailing list, seems to be a
lot goin on! One problem tho: I go to school, and I live a long way away from
S.F, is there anybody out there who lives in the same area? If so, please
E-mail me!

So tell me...What's this Blue Cube you're posting about? Will there be a full
moon rave? When's the next New moon? Where are all the Techno Oriented Music
stores? And so on...

You know Vivian,

When people read your posts you DO kinda come off as a know it all (even
when asking questions).  You should *really* watch not only the *tone* of
your posts but your *style*.  I think that's why people have such a viceral
reaction.  My suggestion to you is to choose your words a bit more
carefully and remember your audience.  Remeber to step very carefully and
offend as few people as possible.
In this way people will not only think you're not defensive, but that
you're not serious, and as such will take your posts less seriously.

If you buy into that load of rubbish I have a few Bay Bridges to sell you
at half off!!!

Be yourself!  I didn't take it seriously.  What *I*S rather serious is our
new DJ "Jammin Jumpin" John D.

What I wanna know is what will he call himself...I have a few suggestions:
He should forget about using the name John at all...to many DJ's with that name.

How about:

DJ "Jumpin" JD

DJ JD

DJ Yoga D.

DJ Frenetic

DJ Old Skool

DJ JD Phreak

DJ Dialup

DJ Dial Tone

DJ Blue Box

DJ Insomnia

DJ Vivarin

DJ Stretch

In any case, I look forward to any addition to the family of DJ's here in
the city.  Hell, just another person to contribute to the, er, "vibe".

heh heh heh

Peace out,
John

(P.S. JD, don't take it at all personally.  As a new Member of the Cracker
Jack Bowling League, I know how it feels to be different)

(P.S.S.  Did I mention our new Golf Team called the Cracker Jack Green League?)

****MESSAGE FROM INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH****


  I'm glad to see that you have posted our event.But there are a couple of
mistakes in the information i would like to clarify.

 -DJ DEMIGOD is from San Francisco not Los Angeles.
 -And Industrial Strength is billed as the first HARDCORE TECHNO,and   hard
acid trance party in Northern California.
 -Also we're bringing in the largest ever Shredder sound system in Northern
California for this event.
 -The location is a massive virgin  werehouse in central S.F.
 -The party is all ages,bust free,and all night long.
 -The forces behind this party have gathered together to bring     TECHNO
back to the S.F. rave scene.

  Thank you once again for posting our event.And we look forward to seeing
all of you on Jan 22 at Industrial Strength.   Peace!

From: Scott Michael Nelson <drenalin@duckmail>

This is my first post so please don't harsh on it to much.  My friends 
and I have been raving for about two years now.  I'm going to U. of 
Oregon at the moment but one of my goals recently has been to help the 
rave scene in some way.  Information distribution is the way that I think 
the rave scene could start to change.  At a rave called the Promised Land 
I received a flyer called House Music and Planetary Healing, alot of you 
may have read this flyer.  It was an inspiration to me but is the only 
such flyer I have received in two years!!!!!

This is an idea for a flyer I would like to print up myself in a small 
number to help promote a sort of cleansing and unity in some aspects of 
raving.  I would appreciate it if you have any comments or constructive 
criticism to reply.  Maybe this can become a place where people can 
present some information or an opinion and receive comments and then 
print it up for all of the people that are not on SFRaves that we still 
need to reach.

---------------------------------------

A Higher Consciousness through Dancing

	Take this time to reexamine your role in this underground scene.  
Raves have the potential to be a channeling force for positive ideas and 
the goodness that can bring about change in our society.  To be a 
positive force we must show everyone that we have good intentions for the 
whole of the world and those who live here.  Although drugs can help you 
enter into an altered world or a completely different one there is a 
realm we can all explore inside of ourselves.  I myself have reached 
higher levels of awareness using drugs and am not condemning their use.  
But recently I have been exploring the levels of energy and higher states 
of consciousness that can be reached through dancing with a positve group 
of people while sober.  By dancing with a group of open and positive 
people you can open up your mind and reach a higher plane through 
yourself.  If you have explored this natural high hopefully you can agree 
that it is one of the best and it's free, it's you!!!  I'm tired of 
hearing friends and others saying how they need drugs when they are at a 
rave.  Show yourself and the world that raving is a state of mind that we 
can hold everyday and everywhere to promote unity, peace, and love 
through ourselves and our actions and not through drugs.  Educate 
yourself and others about the joy of life!

---------------------------------

Please reply with any comments and especially any criticism because I'm 
not exactly sure this sounds like I mean it to be and maybe you can help 
me clean up the wording.


The Cloud Factory

P.S. I have an active (408) voice mail through January maybe February if 
you need a short term line for a rave you're throwing e-mail me and you 
can use it fro a week or two.

PAPER:    SF Weekly, January 5 (year blanked out, it must have gone to press
                as 1993.  Obviously the editors did too many dumb drugs
                that week. =)

TITLE:    The K CHRONICLES, "Raving About the Club Scene" or: "Clubbing
                About the Rave Scene" by Keith Knight.

FRAME 1:  caption:  San Francisco is a great town to go clubbing in...
          drawing:  Tall black guy and spike-haired ?lesbian? walking on
                Pier 39 with toward the Sea Lions, both carrying baseball
                bats (hers studded with nails).

FRAME 2:  caption:  But my very most favorite of places to go clubbing is
                at a RAVE...
          drawing:  Doorman at "Club Stimpy" collecting, literally, arms
                and legs of people on line, sign saying "COVER CHARGE Your
                very SOUL"
          caption:  Sure.. Admission is way overpriced...

FRAME 3:  caption:  The music is REALLY ANNOYING...
          drawing:  Black guy ("your humble narrator") bug-eyed and screaming
                "AAAAAA", and being administered eyedrops (?!), background
                consists entirely of "THUMP THUMP THUMP chicka chicka chicka
                chicka."

FRAME 4:  caption:  And smart drugs [sic] are actually very DUMB...
          drawing:  Our two heroes sucking down drinks from a cup, eyes
                consisting of huge spirals, he says "I don't feel nothin'...
                you?", she "Blbbxxt...".
          box pointing to characters:  Way too blitzed already to ever
                figure out whether smart drugs work or not.

FRAME 5:  caption:  Still, I think these gatherings really do unite different

I think Ethan covered the Blue Cube party. Majority of the techno stores 
are located in San Francisco. You might want to try Upstairs Records or 
Underground Records in San Jose. Otherwise whenyou come to SF, you can 
hit BPM, Tweekin', Gaia Mantra,andafew used record stores.. In berkeley, 
there is primal records and rasputins. Also Tower Records carries a 
good amount of techno imports...

Hello, and yes ythis is yet another message from a new addition to
the mailing list. I have waited for alomost two weeks, like the info
in the begining says i should :), but i thought that it was time for
me to ask some questions. Btw, my name is kathy and i am a bezerkely
student who used to live in the city, but now is trapped in bezekely.

Question 1:
    I have noticed that most of the music and people you guys "rave"
(every bit of that pun intended) about are acid whatever and smaller
DJ's. do any of you like house music? and bigger DJ's like ernie munson?

please i don't mean to offend by calling the dj's small, all i mean is that
the ir names are not smeared all over every rave flyer.

Question 2: 
    okay, so i guess i only had one question.

anyway, i can't wait to hear some replies and get into the whole mailing
list thing, although i am rather new at it, so i am not sure if i am
doing everything right.
keep the groove going

Status: 

<wierd psycho comic with a kinda funny pun deleted>

> P.S.  What are "Riot Grrrls", and do they actually exist?

Now thats a good question.
the "Riot Grrrl" movement (?) trend  whatever came out of
the Garage Punk sound that was basically punk with a real poppy sound
and also tended to have females as lead singers
and that more or less came out of more poppy all women bands like
the go-gos or the bangle or tons of others

the label was basically given to bands with women who had dropped
the poppy sound and went for a harder edge to it
and also tended to deal a lot with women's issues
or try to reconstruct the idea of woman through
their performances and lyrics
(esp. through claiming a sexual autonomy or being the 
agressor in the sexual relationship as well as 
reclaiming their bodies: who looks at them and in what ways)

for example: when i was doing sound at a bar for concerts, 
Bikini Kill played there, and me and my male partner were told
"Don't make any sexist comments, they'll beat you up.
If they get hot, they might take off their shirts,
Don't stare at them if they do, they'll beat you up.
etc. etc. etc."

I think that is some of the image that gets portrayed about Riot Grrrl bands
just like it does about other feminists,
and like with other feminists, it was totally false
they were wonderfully nice people, who although could most definitely
do me lots of physical harm, i highly doubt would

BUT apparently, some of the men in the front row of the concert
felt very uncomfortable because while performing them group members
esp. the lead singer, would just look at them in ways
that just basically made them feel very uncomfortable

images that have been popularized have been things like
when L7 dropped their pants in the middle of a concert,
Inger Lore, formerly of the Nymphs, urinated on teh desk
of someone at her label and also in concert said
"My voice is really messed up right now,
so im going to show you how nice girls clear their throats"
and then had her b/f come up on stage and performed oral sex on him
(which also got her arrested)

K Records up in Olympia, WA has been one label that has put out a lot
of stuff by Riot Grrrl bands and solo acts
Theres another label that has come out with lots of stuff whose name
slips my mind right now

personally, i think its one of the only interesting things going
on in the rock scene right now, but its also pretty damn
trendy so there are more and more groups that are 
imitating it without havign the same political motivation

ALL this info is just what i happen to be coming up with right now
and could be totally wrong, so please correct me if it needs to be done

hate 'em all.  burn the lot of 'em and dump 'em in the nearest ocean.

actually, in all seriousness, i have to say that ernie was one of my
least fave DJs ever until a few weeks ago and a small party name o'
"Bliss" at king st...  ernie rocked out with some funked up house that
made my little white butt move outta control.  awesome!

and, so far, one thing that my roommate pointed out about the
acid/trance DJs around here (and I agree with this entirely) is that
they just aren't very good DJs.  very little skill in the beat
matching and energy directing departments.  say what you want about
Jeno - the guy can mix and knows how to build a set.  so far, all the
trance DJs i've heard have been flailing blindly through a crate of
aphex twin and black dog 12 inchers.  last night at spacelab was a
textbook example - shoban launched with a *brilliant* Eat Static track
(played about 8% too fast but that's just my opinion) and then utterly
failed to follow up on the promise of that track... energy went
through the floor.  dance area cleared in ten minutes.

_I_ think that most of the people who are pretty vocal on the list
are pretty burnt out on most large scale events that have a an
amazing lack of creativity and real drive recently

that while they would admit that a lot of the big name DJ's are good,
and like their music, that they are also starting be less creative
and are getting into a rut musically,

the less plastered (on flyers) DJ's tend to vary their musical selection
more and get more daring with the stuff they will play
(i would hazard to guess that this is because more well known
DJ's feel that they have to play a certain thing to make people happy)
(okay, actually im saying that because i've heard that said like
2,000,000 times by really popular DJ's)

and the people who post a lot are also more into the musical creation
side than your average person and are more into making pretty
deep complex music, which _I_believe_ acid is, while house music
is more poppy, and fun oriented 

i think the major reason for the leaning of discussion on this list
is due to the fact that some people post a lot and have a certain leaning
and other people would chime in if the leaning were different
but its not, so they dont

i've heard this too and i think it's bullshit.  when we were doing a
show in oklahoma, we met joey beltram who played a really hardcore set
despite the fact that all his new stuff is pretty mellow and tweaky.
we asked what was up with that and he said it's because that's what
they expected him to play.  i said "bullshit, you should play what you
LIKE... they wanted you to come here because they wanted YOUR STYLE."
and he said "nah, they just want what they *think* my style is..."

i guess he's got a point.

just to make sure, i wanna say that i think its also ridiculous
that a DJ will play somehting that they may not even like
because they *THINK* that's what people want to here
(not dissing oklahoma, but from your review of the show,
Joey was probably right, though)

anyhow.. last nite Taylor spun one of the best sets i have heard him
spin in ages and when i told him this he said
'Well, yeah, its hard to spin that type of set here,
because people dont like it that much'

I had to refrain myself from slapping the boy around because
A) the club is filled with yuppies and pseudo-neophyte clubbers
who dont deserve to get music they like because while
Jason Bentley was spinning a great set they come up
and asked to hear some Prince
(nothing against Prince of course, cuz he's got a real cute butt)

B) everyone i talked to kept saying that it was one of the best 
sets they have heard from him in a LOONG time
(of course i didnt talk to the people in point A, 
so i was talking to a minority)

C) the owner of the club WANTS him to play wierd, out there shit
that people wont be able to hear anywhere else
hell, before the DJ's get there, they track ambient CDs

> i guess he's got a point.

pshaw, you should've taken him out and smacked him aroudn abit
(mostly so that you could say that you went and 
smacked Joey Beltram around a bit :)

Status: 

> MykL:  it's amazing what passes for humor in the age of Beavis 
> and Butthead, huh? 

ALthough I don't watch much TV, I've recently come to the conclusion
that Beavis & Butthead are the most important media personalities in
America today.  I would have never even checked them out if it weren't
for congress and various "Traditional Values" groups freaking out over 
them.  Gee, they must be doing *something* right, I thought.  At first, 
I wasn't sure why I liked them.  But now I think I figured out: The 
Beavis and Buttheads of today are the ravers of tomorrow!

In the world of Beavis & Butthead, things are either "cool", or they
"suck".  Their criteria for what's cool and what sucks represent the
fairly typical twisted outlook of 15 year old socially outcast
white male suburbanites.  Niether jocks nor geeks, they belong to
no clique, and are loyal only to their own interests - adolescent
fascination with sex, money, mischevious destructiveness, catching
a buzz, shirking responsibility, and poking fun at every "respectable"
institution they come into contact with.  Their complete absorption
into their own values and total rejection of more socially accepted ones
seems to have resulted in the perpetuation of their intellectually
and emotionally arrested development (i.e. they are both morons and
jerks).  Ultimately, it is apparent that their extreme idiocy is merely
a reflection of the idiocy of everything they have so far been exposed
to.
 
Beavis & Butthead - Future ravers?  Yes, I think so, and here's why.
 
- Love of music.  Although their taste leans towards metal, I've seen
them boogie to Madonna as well.  They like to dance.  It is pretty
obvious that music that speaks to their emotions is one of the only
positive pleasures in their lives.
 
- Lack of community/family.  It is those who are most lacking in this
area who are most likely to seek it outside the normal structures.
And although it may not be apparent, these guys want to be loved as
much as any of us.
 
- Active Renegades.  Whether it's breaking into a nudist camp, egging
a neighbors house, or holding a neighborhood kid for ransom...B&B seek
fun irregardless of rules or laws.  Their lack of dedication to anything
(too stupid to do anything that well) prevents them from being
truly malicious.  Even the rather heinous acts of blowing up a frog
comes more from boredom than the desire to torture and hurt.  Raving
would satisfy their rebellious spirit and rechannel their destructive
energies.
 
- Disrespect for Leaders.  They march to their own drummer, and all
public figures, even rock stars who are "cool" are targets of ridicule.
B&B will not be led into corporate-approved conformity.  They don't
even have fashion sense.
 
- Transcendental Cowboys.  These guys really want to get high.  They
checked themselves into an emergency room in the hope of getting
prescriptions for cold medicine that would cause "hallucinations", and
Beavis sucked on a frog/toad in an attempt to catch an "awesome buzz".
 
So in conclusion, B&B seem to be fucked up amoralists only because their
society hasn't addressed any of their needs.  They seek many of the
of intense thrills that raving might provide.  While it is true that they
lack the "vibe", and respect for their fellow beings and the environment,
this is only because of their current outcast status and resultant
repressed anger.  Let's not forget that many ravers today have come from
punk/metal/goth/industrial backgrounds.    
 
I could go on about how B&B are really a satire of society and of
themselves (like The Simpsons) and how their "cool" vs "sucks" value
system makes a mockery of all purveyors of "right" and "wrong" and
therefore promotes transcendence from the ego-based absolutists who
would decide for others how people should behave.  Raving is about
freedom and Beavis and Butthead, like information, just want to be free.

Status: 


I must say how suprised i am at how fast you all respond to messages,
and how well......

As to what everyone has told me about how much better or much pppreferred
smaller sfraver dj's are, this is what i have to say;

1. i can't wait to hear you all spin, i lam already committed to going
to tAhoe this week-end with my sis, or i would have loved to have come
and met all you peoples. I am going to try and go to Spacelab next week,
and maybe i can meet you then...

2. I am sorry to hear that you all think that all the bigger dj's are
just boring. As for most of them i agree. Personally, the only big
one i really like is ernie munson, that boy can mix, and if you ever
have talked to him, he doesn't mix what he thinks people want to hear,
he mixes what he likes and he mixes for the art of mixing. Most people
can get two records on beat, but that isn't mixing. mixing is the art
of creating new music from old. YOu almost can never hear when ernie
mixes from one song to the next unless you are really trained. IF you
all still don't believe, i would suggest listening tohis tap called synchro
systems, it's live from the housing project and it is sooo incrediable.,
but it is house.

3. As for those other big namers, i can't sy much, except that Carlos
and Dutch are cool, but they usally play the same stuff. Ghost, just
thinks he is good, and he is better at techno then anything else. Jeno
i have yet to hear, although i have hear really good things. Pete Avila
is cool, i like him....etc.....but you don't need my run down on sf's
overused dj's.

anyway, the more feed back the more interesting.....not all big dj's
suck......:)

leading the world to a better groove....

***2. I am sorry to hear that you all think that all the bigger dj's are just
***boring.

    I for one don't think that all the bigger Djs are boring.  Jeno, Ernie,
Garth, Markie, Tony are all big names and among my favs!!!  These guys are able
to throw down and make that crowd move which is something that the less
experienced Dj might not be able to do.  Mixing is one thing but being able to
take a crowd, lift them in the air and punch them through space and time is
another.  These guys still can do that to me.  When I dance I surrender myself
to the music and let it take me.  I just like the way these guys tell the story

I can certainly say that "John D" as a name is already taken,   and I'm not
seriously thinking of getting into the DJ scene,  so I wouldn't worry
about lack of a name right now,   I just want to introduce some new
music to the area,  as requested by those folks in the UK,  who were
nice enough to mail me about 15 disks.

Talked with Ethan,  and he says that after all the OTHER DJ's spin,
he would give me a chance to spin my new records,   but we'll see,
and that is of course provided that I will even be in a state of mind
to deal with working on equipment I am un-familiar with,   but I'll
be willing to make a go at it,   at least to play some new stuff.
I HAVE worked with similar equipment before,  not just at radio 
stations I've worked at,   but at several discos in Lower E. Side
in NY in late 70's.    Equipment hasn't changed that much,  and I've
observed current systems in operations.   I think that by 5 am,  
everyone will be so "hosed" that nobody will care.   I only have
15 disks,  so my time behind the turn tables will be rather short
anyway,  so don't blink your eyes,  you might miss it.

That was *cool*, Lee.  Most of the pundit viewpoints I've seen on
Beavis and Butthead *suck*.

Actually, I think Mike Judge and the other B&B crew capture certain
social and behavioral nuanaces dead-on.  Especially in the way that
people portrayed on the show drop their social masks and show who
they really are.  The health inspector who thinks the french-fried
earthworms B&B cooked up to gross out the customers are actually pretty
good, as he walks away from the totally trashed-out burger barn.  The
too-sensitive high school teacher with the ponytail and sensitivity
training who finally applies good old authoritarian tones when B&B get
out of hand.  B&B are the innocents of an in-between era, and while they
are definitely portrayed as *cool*, there is no sugar-coating of their
selfish, inane, ill-informed, hormone-driven behavior.  

So I think the analysis of B&B as future ravers is dead-on too.  
Although at first they would probably take off their shirts, head for
the nearest beer vendors, and start sucking down balloons as fast
as they could be served up!

Ah yes, I can see it now: 'Moby's *cool*.'  'No, Moby *sucks*.'

I'm really glad to see that the American Rave scene is not as Drug oriented as
I thought it was... In Sweden, many raves are legal, which has it's upsides
and downsides: The upsides are: No cops to bust you at 3 am, GREAT sound and
visuals ( One rave I went to was sponsored by Sanyo, AWESOME!) and not as amny
drugs circulating. The downsides: "Wrong" crowd shows up (peopl who go to pick
fights or just stand around looking bored...) and not as friendly atmosphere
due to cops astnading around watching your every move...

Raving is a state of mind, to some even a religious experience, It should not
be an excuse for people to chemically alter their conciousness. To all fellow
ravers who think that they CANNOT enjoy a rave without E, poppers, nitrous or
whatever: Go sober and enjoy the ULTIMATE high, the NATURAL high, the
ADRENALINE HIGH, the LOVE high, or whatever it is that you might experience,
It's all about being who you are.

Right ON! I must say, having been on both sides of the fence that I totally
agree, in fact I was sober for the majority of parties that I went to in 1993.
This was for several reasons:

	1) I don't put random stuff that I don't know what it is 
	in my body and MOSTLY the stuff available was not what it was
	advertised to be.

	2) I wanted to see if there was anything to the experience without
	the aid of xhemical assistance.

	3) At many renegades, I often get to be the one to talk to the 
	authorities and I never talk to them while under the influence.

	4) I was having some incredible deep psychic experiences without
	the chemicals.

I'm not saying don't take substances when you go out.  I've found that 
taking various things can definately get you to a certain place very quickly,
like training wheels on a bicycle, but eventually they hold you back if
you keep using them ALL the time.

These days, I`ll take things at a party as a treat.  If I'm sure the cops
aren't comming and I don't have to work and there are a lot of my friends
around, etc I'll as jsl says, crack-on, but most of the time I get pretty out
there with just myself, although sometimes I must admit, that these days,
all I seem to need to send me through the roof is just a whiff of some good
herb :) Which is something I wouldn't touch 2 years ago. 
I guess I'm just gettin old.

So although you say that they are absorbed in their own values not socially
accepted ones, you admit that the values that they have absorbed (their
idiocy) reflects the idiocy of everything they have so far been exposed
to, ie society.  It seems a contradiction in terms.  (Clarify and I'll be
more than happy to agree with you).

Although I agree with your basic premise, I disagree that they are
unintentionally stupid.  Butt-head, especially, shows signs of
intelligence.  Both are grotesquely creative (who would think of playing
frog-baseball or buying a lawn mower with $500.00 or fishing outside a
window) but eccentricly so.  They are by all practical social purposes
"mad" although they make absolute sense in their own minds and in the
minds of the viewers who judge them only by their own internal laws, not
those dictated by society.  These internal laws essentially being no laws
at all. 

Essentially, then, they are polar opposites to society.  Their madness
reflects the same madness of society turned inside out.  We, the viewers,
stand in the middle, the objective sane observers, who identify with the
madness of B&B and with the madness of society.  Both madnesses lie
within: the insanity of the individual in the insanity of the world. 
Almost existential.

> Beavis & Butthead - Future ravers?  Yes, I think so, and here's why.

Oh yes.  I agree here too.  I was a heavy metal head during my teen years
and evolved from AC/DC to Duran Duran to the Cure to Rave.  But I'm not
stupid (to my knowledge). (:

So although you say that they are absorbed in their own values not socially
accepted ones, you admit that the values that they have absorbed (their
idiocy) reflects the idiocy of everything they have so far been exposed
to, ie society.  It seems a contradiction in terms.  (Clarify and I'll be
more than happy to agree with you).

Although I agree with your basic premise, I disagree that they are
unintentionally stupid.  Butt-head, especially, shows signs of
intelligence.  Both are grotesquely creative (who would think of playing
frog-baseball or buying a lawn mower with $500.00 or fishing outside a
window) but eccentricly so.  They are by all practical social purposes
"mad" although they make absolute sense in their own minds and in the
minds of the viewers who judge them only by their own internal laws, not
those dictated by society.  These internal laws essentially being no laws
at all. 

Essentially, then, they are polar opposites to society.  Their madness
reflects the same madness of society turned inside out.  We, the viewers,
stand in the middle, the objective sane observers, who identify with the
madness of B&B and with the madness of society.  Both madnesses lie
within: the insanity of the individual in the insanity of the world. 
Almost existential.

> Beavis & Butthead - Future ravers?  Yes, I think so, and here's why.

Oh yes.  I agree here too.  I was a heavy metal head during my teen years
and evolved from AC/DC to Duran Duran to the Cure to Rave.  But I'm not
stupid (to my knowledge). (:

(What?  No smileys here???)

If this is true, the future of the rave movement is pretty grim indeed.

I can accept all this social analysis behind B&B, but the bottom line
is:  does anyone here actually find them funny???

Some commentator (I forget exactly who) said the most remarkable
thing about Beavis and Butthead is that in broadcasting it MTV is
essentially reveling in the stupidity of its format *and* its audience.

Maybe I'm just not capable of the mental gymnastics required to
reconciling the ethos of rave and that of Beavis and Butthead, but
if you are, more power to you.

I thought they were kind of annoying until I heard a couple of songs
from the B&B album, which were pretty funny.  I can pretty much
tolerate them but I think the Simpsons are far funnier.

Phone Phreaking, Riot Grrls, Beavis and Butthead ...

All this pop culture discussion reminded me of an essay I started a 
a few months ago.  Here is the first chapter (don't worry, it is short)
Hope you like it!


**********************




		Fuedal Anarchy and Pedagogic Existentialism
		   The Beavis and Butthead Connection
	
				   by

		    Jean-Paul Sartre and David Alves 
				



**********************

Chapter One:	  Anguish, Beavis says "Pole"


	First, what is meant by anguish?  The existentialists say at once that
man is anguish.  What this means is this: the man who involves himself and who
realizes that he is not only the person he chooses to be, but also a lawmaker
who is, at the same time, choosing all mankind as well as himself, can not
help escape the feeling of his total and deep responsibility.  Of course,
there are many people who are not anxious; but we claim that they are hiding
their anxiety, that they are fleeing from it.  Certainly, many people believe
that when they do something, they themsleves are the only ones involved, and
when someone says to them, "What if everyone acted that way?" they shrug their
shoulders and answer, "Everyone doesn't act that way."  But really, one should
always ask himself, "What would happen if everybody looked at things that way?"
There is no escaping this disturbing thought except by a kind of double-
dealing.  A man who lies and makes excuses for himself by saying that "not 
everybody does that," is someone with an uneasy conscience, because the act of 
lying implies that a universal value is conferred upon the lie.


	Anguish is evident even when it conceals itself.  This is the anguish
Keirkegaard called the anguish of Abraham.  As it is so painfully obvious to
the viewers of Beavis and Butthead yet concealed from the characters within
the context of their world, we are witness to profound anguish.  Why does
Beavis find humor in the hardening of his penis if it is not the denial of,
or more benevolently, the profound understanding of the very paradox that 
modern man must face.  The analogy is striking.  I have penis therefore I am.
Butthead is forced to question, "Do I have a penis?  How do I know?  What
proof do I have?"  What proof indeed!  Is the momentary state of his penis
a pathological condition or his conscious choice for man?  For every man,
everything happens as if all mankind had its eyes fixed on him and were guiding
itself by what he does.  There is no question here of the kind of anguish
which would lead to quietism, to inaction.

Well, the smiley was certainly virtually implied.  I don't think you
could realistically expect B&B to beatmatch their consciousness with
rave-satori immediately.  So they would have to do an episode or two
as part of the shirtless hordes before crossing the threshhold and
becoming DJs and shaving their heads like Sven Vath :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'd go further and even say that "enlightened" people still can't experience
these states (if they're anything like the ones I've had ;-).  I think it's
drug-culture myth that mystics, yogis, misc. eastern religious acheive the
same or even similar states as psychedelic experiences.  There are 
similarities, I'm sure, but I think it's an overused comparison, and maybe
even a little insulting to the "enlightened" and mis-leading to everyone.
Some similarities are that both methods can give you the feeling of
understanding or comprehension of the universe (and beyond) and the feeling
of "enlightenment" but one way is through meditation and is a calm  
contemplation of reality while the other is a sometimes aggresive roler coaster
ride throught reality (and un-reality, whatever either one of them are).  I
don't think enlightened yogis feel the same feelings and see the same visual
effects or that there minds race at such seemingly high speeds from one thought
to the next or that they feel that intense joy or so overwhelmingly loose
touch with everything.  I know you can get way out there with meditation
because I've done some and I'm sure that a practitoner of 20 yrs. can get
into some interesting states of mind but it's a slow relaxed jouney, where
psychedelics don't even give you the time to pack your suitecase.  I think
they are just opposites that take you to a similar destination.  Meditative
states and enlightenment are more stable too, in that you don't realy have
to all-out "loose" it in order to "find" it.

I think they're funny cause there a lot like my self when I was 13 (except
the blowing up frogs, etc.).  I've also known people like them and theres
a lot of right-on cynical social commentary like the simpsons but it's 
cruder and I like that.  Also I don't have a TV so they're probably not as
played-out for me as for some of you.

I personally disagree about acid being more complex.  Most of the acid house
I hear is just little more than a 303 or Super Jupiter doing lots of bloops
and filter sweeps and a 909 hammering away.  House for me has lots more
subtlety and complexity, combining more traditional instruments with
tweaky samples.  And it's usually more rhythmically complex and interesting.

This is especially true of really deep house, which I prefer to the
more commercial "straight" house music where vocals tend to be a bit too
prominent.

I feel a flame war coming on -- I will only respond privately to any
followups on this (if at all)...

the music.    I would say that I have about:

70% - House (120 - 125 BPM),  really trancey stuff,  all new.
25% - Hard Acid (135- 140 BPM,  trancey stuff,  but faster.
5%  - 150 BPM stuff.

I have heard NONE of this music played at any raves I attended,  so
be looking forward to some very new and refreshing sounds.   After
talking to Ethan,  he says that I MIGHT go on after 5 am.

See ya all there at Friends and Family tonight....

  I'm glad to see that you posted our event.But there are a couple of
mistakes in the information i would like to clarify.
 -DJ DEMIGOD is from San Francisco not Los Angeles.
 -And Industrial Strength is billed as the first harcore techno,and hard
trance party.
 -Also we're bringing in the largest ever Shredder sound system in Northern
California for this event.
 -The location is a massive virgin  werehouse in central S.F.
 -The party is all ages,bust free,and all night long.
 -The forces behind this party have gathered together to bring     techno
back to the S.F. rave scene.

Hey y'all, we just got back from Friends and Family and boy oh boy
it was great.  

It was great to meet all you sfravers for the first time, plus a few
for the second and third time. 

Smile factor was incredibly high.  Glowing faces lit up the dance floor-
once again, boy oh boy it was great.

Hmmm..about the music, i got to hear laura and mescalina and for the first
time, could tell the difference between two djs.  sorry, but i am way
lotz ignorant, but am learning more day by day.  anyway, i loved them
both, but i have to say, i think like the trancier stuff the best.

The digeridoos were great too.  i talked to one of the players who makes 
them -- he blends traditional craftmanship with modern polymer technology 
and comes up with some really nice instruments.


Well, that's all for now as i am a little tired.  Looking forward to the
next party at the Blue Cube, and thanks again to Ethan and Resonate and
everyone else who put on this wonderful party.

Well I do think the experiences are different, I won't say that one is 
superior to the other, it's like saying a screw driver is more useful
than a hammer, there are instancs where you will luck out if you have
one or the other, (You'll be in really good shape if you have both,
unless what you really need is a wrench, but we digress :)

I have had profound experience while drunk but don't think drinking
is a "spiritual path" to enlightenment.  Neither are psychedelics,
but they most definately are tools that can be used on the Path.
Just remember what your reasons are for starting the Journey.

Some meditation is calm but not all,  I have been _DEEPLY_ into trance
(one full moon morn at bonnie dune, with Jeno spinning) without imbibing
a single thing, I must say my deepest "Vibe States" have been reached
without psychedelics.  But I have reached some very deep and magical
states with the use of certain things.  I think It would have taken me
longer to get to those states if I had NEVER used psychedelics but
I don't think that you need to use them continueously to continue
to make progress.  I know for me there are times when I take things to
seek enlightenment but there are times when I take things t HAVE FUN.

An experience of Gnosis can occur with or without Psychedelics
(But I must admit it can be more _fun_ with)

the mix of net and non-net people was perfect, the DJ's were on fire,
and the vibe was as thick as maple syrup!  And very pleasant live
ambient by that guy upstairs (Amit?)

I loved the idea of having two chill rooms, one dark and one light!

Hats off to Resonate, Ethan, and all friends new and old who were there!
If we can build on this base, things look really bright for this coming

Hi, folks!

Many thanks to you all, netters, for helping to make Friends and Family 
*the* best party I've ever been to in my life!  I'm really happy to have
helped with some of the logistics for the party, and some small promotion,
to help get things rolling.  Clearly, though, this was a collective effort
by *everyone* to blast off to another space and time.  The whole party
just felt right, from the very beginning, all the way through to the very
end as I helped unload the sound system.

Many thanks to Steve/Resonate and his housemates for providing a wonderful
space for us all to do the do.  Many thanks for the care they provided in
setting up the space, providing water and munchies, and for acting as the
cleanup crew...bravo!

Many thanks to Ethan for the best sound system...Sound Vision just keeps
getting better and better!  I pat myself on the back for providing part
of the sound system for the upstairs, with a big nod to Steve again for
the sound in the dark chill room, and a prop to Amit for his gear. Live
house for the family...weeee-o!

Major props to all of the DJs!  bitchin' music all night long in both
spaces...chill and dark! Wow! way to move people!  Major props, too, for
everyone of them for providing the space and time for everyone who wanted
to play...truly a remarkable achievement...no ego, only fun.

Special thanks to Philip Chang and (humbly) myself, for getting this all
on DAT, too...we have the recordings to prove it to ourselves, too!

Most of all, the biggest props to every single person who came...smiles
were in effect from the get go, everyone pitched in to *make* the vibe.
Lots of consideration, lots of patience when things got cramped or didn't
go quite as expected.

I was very happy to see everyone who came out...so nice to see you all
after such a long time...it's always a pleasure to get together with you
all.  Sorry to have missed some of you...it was a legendary party, and
I wish you could have been there to share it with us, and I'm sorry that
you had to be elsewhere.  I hope to see you soon!

There's just too many great things that happened for me to recount...
guess you had to be there.  

I can tell you that it was a pleasure, and really easy to load out the
sound systems after this party.  There have been events I've helped
load out from where it was "drag my butt coz it has to be done".  This
was a real high.  It was an honor and a privilege to help provide a few
of the underpinnings for this party.  It was even fun to act as the greeter
for a little bit...it was so much fun to see happy people coming and going!

Wow! is all I can say.  This one set a new standard for me!

'Probably will. A number of live bands are picking up on this too.
Check out the 'Broun Fellinis'. Also, Eddie Marshall is fronting a

Humm, I actually kinda like it. The raps are a bit un-inspired, but just
take it as texture. Besides, it 'works'. I was at a bar on New Years where
no one was dancing or even moving too much. The jukebox was oscillating
between Sinatra and the Rolling Stones. One of the bartenders turned off the
jukebox and put on a tape of US3; instant dance party! (sorta)

Hey, this was a really fun party. The attitude level was way down, and the
relaxation level was way up. The 'cube' itself was a little crowded to dance
in, but that has the advantage of forcing you to talk to the people you're
dancing with :) The wierd part was meeting several people I didn't know
that knew people that I had tried to get to go to the party... actually,
it is a little known fact that there are really only 34 human souls in the
universe, and all the rest is done with mirrors; think about it, have you
ever had more than 34 of your friends in one place at one time? The only
bad part was when someone put the salsa under the faucet and it turned into
red tide. Amit (sp?) did some really well paced 'live' housey ambient, with
keyboard over sequences upstairs. Didn't get to hear Mescalina, but he's
on KALX right now. To everyone involved in pulling this off, Great Job!
If more of these go off, '94 should be great!

A lot of people have the impression that "acid" is just 303's and
909's, but I think acid encompasses a lot more than that.  For me, acid
can be used as a description for any song which does something to tweak my
brain.  Although 303's are a perfect tool for this, almost anything can be
used to create an acid-like sound.  Trying to say whether house is more
complex than acid is kind of pointless, like trying to compare two races
of people.  I don't think you can really make such broad generalizations. 
Take, for example, Amorphous Androgynous (something which I very much
consider extremely acidic) versus anything out on Strictly Rhythm records
(straight up house).  No comparson here, Amorphous is about as complex as
they come.  BUT, we could easily compare a really complex house song
(sorry, can't think of one right now- my bias is revealed 8)  to a 303/808
or 303/909 acid house track.  Well, you see where I'm going here...
Basically, the whole argument is pointless.

As far as Maria's comments on SpaceLab, I have to say the crowd this past
Thursday was ESPECIALLY bad, very few people willing to dance, and it is
true that in certain cases the DJ's there fail to lift the crowd up, but
if you were there the week before, you would have felt totally different. 
The place was packed, the energy was high, and there was a great DJ/crowd
connection going on.  The thing I like about SpaceLab is that it's
something DIFFERENT from the rest of SF.  This club has only just started,
so I'm sure they're still working on perfecting everything and getting a
steady, energetic crowd.  Don't give up!  Try again this week!

First of all, a round of applause for Ethan for putting together this
party.  The shit went OFFFFF!!!  I had a great time.  I'd like to
personally thank Ethan for letting me spin on a sound system for the first
time.  It was an honor for me to spin in front of so many people
(the place was PACKED!).  Of course, I was not satisfied with my mixing
(is any DJ?), but I think I'll get better with experience.

Actually, I'm thinking seriously about throwing a house party, or rather,
an apartment party, at my place.  If you ever knew Leah (former sfraver),
I live in the same complex, but in the biggest apartment (!).  The
combination of living room and kitchen space (they're connected) is about
50% bigger than the blue cube space, and my apartment has access to the
roof, which spans over the entire complex, and has a partial bay view-
perfect for an ambient setup.  The only problem would be that we'd most
likely have to stop the beats by around 2, but we could go completely
ambient from there.

Another possibility is to throw a Sunday afternoon deal in the expanse of
grass which is right next to, but enclosed in the complex.  There would
definitely be no problems with loudness at that time, assuming I warned
everyone.  So, is anyone interested???  I think after the Blue Cube, WE
NEED MORE SMALL PARTIES.  Let's make '94 the year of the free party!!!

See you all, it was great to meet everyone.  Thanks again Ethan, and
everyone else who participated (including dancers) in making Friends and
Family go off like we all knew it would  8)

  For those who haven't heard.  6.6 quake happened in San Fernando
Valley (Northridge) at 4:31am.  Many buildings collapsed (mostly near

(gas leaks) and water main breaks.  Aftershocks expected in the

I chucked it.  But I remember that the MDRV600 was the Citibank part
number, the headphones looked identical to our MDR-V6 except ours has

600's are fatter and bigger and crappier.  don't settle for cheap
imitations (or even expensive ones) - get *real* MDR-V6s.  you'll be
happier.

(nick philip of chill core collective has a new model Sony set which
is really phenomenal but costs around $200... but as he's doing mainly
ambient stuff with DAT the quality jump is worth it.  V6's have one
main advantage over everything else as far as dance music DJing is
concerned: they are LOUD as fuck!!)

I recently made a comparison of the V6's and V600's.  I found the frequency
response to be radically different between the two.  I personally preferred
the response of the V6's, but other people who made the same comparison
preferred the V600 frequency response.  My personal observation was that
the V600's emphasized the low frequencies (in comparison to the V6's).
I have a high end pair of studio headphones with an incredibly flat response
that I use at home, which is probably why I prefer the V6 response.  I
can understand wanting to have more prominent bass response for DJing house
and techno.  I highly recommend a side by side comparison if one is available.
Although the V6's have been discontinued, I have seen stock in most of the
stereo and electronic shops I've visited in the SF Bay Area in the past
month.  Oh, and importantly, the price seems to be the same for the two
models.

The MDR-V600s are identical to the V-6s in every way as far as I can

NO! The V6 headphones were discontinued because they were replaced with a new
and better model.  This replacement model is the MDR-7506 *NOT* V600.

Not only is the MDR-7506 model the replacement, but it is an *improvement*
over the old V6 model which is why they discontinued it in the first place.
I bought mine for $82 at Sam Ash in New York city.  Most stores are eager to 
get rid of the old V6 model which explains why they're on sale all over.

Bryce is right, the V600 line has a different frequency response.  You
should compare the 7506 side by side with a pair of V600, the V600 isn't as 
brilliant/clear sounding.

Holy Shit! What a party  :)

First off wanted to thank everyone that helped out, most especially Bryce
without whom this party and many others future and past would never have
come off. Analog, *the* coolest guy and most gracious host I've ever
encountered. Sean Casey and Gregor Moshe for lots of hard work setting up
and tearing down. And of course *you* for being there with all your smiles
and positive energy. I really feel like we opened up a hole in the
space/time fabric on this one, really warped  ;) And lets not forget the
neighbors. Heard one woke up in the morning and said: "Martha, I had the
strangest dream last night..."  ;-)

Not enough said about the music so-far:

Derek: great jazzy set really got me feeling warm and fuzzy, all smiles.

Giamma: Kinda blew my mind matching beats on his Denon, makes it look easy.
Really excellent music too, very soulful housy stuff with lots of energy.

Me: thought it went allright; I don't usually spin house, but I was in the
mood and it seemed to go over ok. Lot of the music I played was fresh out
of the shrink wrap, so I look forward to working with it a bit more.

Jon D.: Jon was in a different dimension, one of the best sets I've ever
heard. I'm at a loss to attach a name to what I heard; kinda housy, trancy,
acidic, percussive, mind bending shit. 

Laura: Ditto. Laura really did the do. Flawless trancy/acidic set, really
worked the crowd.

Mescalina: this guy is the Acid King. His music selection was so internally
consistent, every song just worked perfectly with the one before/after.
Really impressed me.

Rocky: First time on the Denon and he smoked too. i had freinds coming up
to me asking who he was and just flipping over his music.

Brad: Spun for an hour early in the morning. Nice housy, trancy stuff. We
were all alittle wrecked by then. Like to here him when he's fresh.

Fred: only caught part of his set, sounded great though. I expect we'll
here more from Fred in the future.

Bryce: unfortunately I missed all of his set cos I was playing. Heard he
wreaked havoc with some twisted european acid though :)

Dr. Teeth: I missed his set too. People I talked to however, went on and
and on about what he was doing. I think getting more live house/trance/acid
etc. into the scene is a definite must.

Jesse: a freind of mine who just coincidentally showed up and spun some
really deep dub upstairs. People really loved it!

DJ Crunch: caught a couple of his famed toons. Mostly stuff on Iridial
(sp?) records. Nice toons. I'm *sure* we'll here more from The Captain. :)

The dijeridoo players: really blew some minds; who are you? step forward
and identify yourselves, we want you :)

Plus many others: lots of folks had fun on the decks, good opportunity for
the ultimate in the DIY experience.

I can hardly wait to hear the tapes :)

Really enthused in the afterglow of this party. In the wake of the last
Liquid Air, I think this list really generated a lot of positive energy and
information about what it takes for us to be a community. Personally, I
consciously tried to integrate that feedback into making this party come
off. While I appreciate all the thanks I have recieved, I did not throw
this party; I consider it a group effort and I think we did a hell of a job
and really want to thank each and every one of you for your feedback,
energy, creativity, and support. 

Looks like a good year ahead.

peace always

amorphous androgynous is one of my favorites....i don't nec. go for everything

I was refering to the thursday before new years, but you're right its unfair to
generalize from one night of an event.

I certainly understand and support the need to support small 'underdog' events,
that;'s what started this scene in the first place and is exactly what's at the
heart of it... i was only responding to what i thought was the notion that the
hard 'acid' trance whatever it is that seems to be catching everybody's eye
right now is exactly more complex than alot of house...it's simply not very
complex at all....but hey, 'everybody's free' right.

besides good toony techno is a hellofalotta fun.

Well I stand big-time corrected.  Sorry if I misled anyone... Jon is
right, the MDR-V6 is a great set-o-phones.  In fact, Gunther bought
ours on Jon's recommendation.  If in fact the V600 is inferior I'd
recommend the new (and by all reports better) model Sony is replacing
the MDR-V6 with.

	Here's a little story for you.

	There once was a disinterested punk rocker who had a subliminal craving
for electronic music who was, unbeknownst to himself, looking for a scene that
had more to offer his senses than the burned out negative iconographic punk
rock scene. He started working at raves during the breakbeat phase and enjoyed
the crowds and the sci-fi aspects but really didn't the *people* who crowded the
massive gigs like Psychadelic Apocalypse and Mr. Floppys. He worked very hard
to provide quality graphics and interactive computer fun stuff but never found
any rewards outside of being able to get himself and his friends in for free.
He would argue on the internet for hours with a character at Berkeley called
"vitamin B" about the nature of this rave scene but was convinced that it would
only be a consumeristic dead end like punk rock.
	So he took of for a year of travel around the USA working at normal
concert halls and seeing our great and diverse (and bizarre) nation and noticed
something interesting. The "techno" music which used to be horrible noisy 
digital and square-wavy stuff started waning and a much high quality composed
and rich sounding "trance" music started flowing. He also started going to 
smaller and harder to access parties and found them to be a nice scene.
Each city, no matter how small, seemed to be growing an underground dance
scene. In between concert tours he went to SF parties which were by far
the best.
	As the parties he found got to be better and better he started noticing 
something: many of them seemed to feature a smiling two tall goateed guys 
running the sound and talking to everyone. One had tattooed arms and the other
had many piercings. The connection between the good parties and these two 
figures was never lost upon our former-punk rocker who had by then ditched his 
leather jacket and donned his striped shirts. He had many friends like 
caliban, blindman, umlaut etc... who had worked with him on events in Santa Cruz
but SF was new territory.
	In time he tired of travelling around the USA and decided to move to
Japan and work in audio and sound there. He sold off almost everything he owned
and prepared to move until he was snatched out of his plans by an amazing 
digital sound company in Marin. He had planned to eventually move to SF when he
was successful later in life but now SF was to become his home.
	After a few months in SF he came to know the names and faces of the
tall smiling goatee guys and after talking to them realized that their energy
and dreams were very similar to his and that eventually they must work together.
All of our former-punk now ravers' skills were used to show our goatee brothers
his style of event promotion and managment and lo- they energies merged and
two very successful parties were generated: SFR New Years and the Blue Cube 
Friends and Family.
	These are just the very smallest examples of what the future will hold.
To our tall goatted guys- the one with the tattooed arms and the one with the
pierces: my heart goes out to you. And anyone else who wants to join and help
create a place where we can dance and dwell in our own surreal and beat filled
space.
	If you are having a party and want help: i'm *always* on line. always.
More organizers = more events = more family = more organizers ...

Subject: A new challenge
Status: 


Hi all, epsecially those who are into sk8'ing...

If anyone should get bored by the simple act of movin one's feet to the
bang of the beat, may I remind you of, or introduce you to the Golden Gate
park Sunday Roller Disco rink. (I know, but I missed all the fun of the
70's disco scene)

Ahh I can see the Beer commercial now... "If you can combine the mentally
stimulating activity of raving, with the sheer physical challenge of
Skating..."

Last Sunday, after attending the Blue Cube party and crashing at Rob&Sin's,
I awoke to a bright and beautiful Sunday morning, went for a stroll up and
down Irving street to find breakfast, and then put on my blades and cruised
over to the park. I had been once last year, but it must have been a bad
day, because unlike last Sunday, I saw very few accomplished skaters.

There were three Hot-Spots I found at the park last Sunday. The first was
the above mentioned disco rink. This was a relatively small oval asphalt
rink with a pretty cheesy boom box setup on one side. Most of the people
skating were relatively talented skaters who could easily dance and skate
at the same time.  I did not percieve an attitude vibe  from these people.
It seemed as though they were happy to have anyone out there who enjoyed
skating and dancing to music. The best scene here was a guy who was jumping
length-wise over a mountain bike. (Ok so this is not dancing, but it
certainly was entertaining to watch). After this got boring, he turned the
bike so that it was perpindicular to his path and then jumped the frame
doing a 360 in the air. Now, I don't consider doing a 360 on skates
terribly difficult, but over a mountain bike... lets just say I'm not sure
if the guy has a full time job.

I wonder if they would mind real DJ's... Hmmm.

Another hot spot was the slalom course. It was really cool watching the
"pros" cruise through the course at high rates of speed. Of course going
forward on two skates was much too easy, they also went forwards on one,
backwards on one, forwards criss crossing each skate, backwards criss
crossing each skate, and my favorite, the
bowlegged-both-skates-pointed-outward slalom (I only saw two guys that
could do this) all at high speeds. Could these have been members of the
Roller Blade professional team? They all knew each others names, and one
guy was actually wearing a "Team Roller Blade" shirt. The guys that I saw
doing this were some of the same guys that were going off at the roller
disco earlier.

The third hot spot were these stairs in front of a white building (it was
kinda like a gift store or something). The same group of guys entertained
themselves, and a crowd of people, as they went flying down these stairs
again and again. Of course once this got easy, they started jumping half
way down the stairs and somehow retaining balance with 10 stairs left to go
down.

Anyway, I am looking for others interested in skating also. I came from a
skating town (skateboarding) and a skateboarding childhood. I progressed to
ramps and half-pipes in college and got pretty comfortable doing simple
grinds and slides on large ramps. I also experimented with street or
freestyle skating, until I broke my ankle doing a 360 boneless off a raised
platform.

I re-kindled my skating spirit last summer and bought a pair of inline
skates and progressed pretty quickly on these, but have only sporadically
given them the time they need for me to become advanced.

So, anyone else out there who wants to skate?  I currently only own inline
skates and not a board, but I may end up getting back into the board stuff
also. I'm interested in anything from leisure Sunday strolls in the park to
aggressive circuit training including speed skating ovals (my personal
favorite), slalom course workouts, and freestyle practice.

If next Sunday is as beautiful as last Sunday, I will be there again
hopefully with much improved balance and more protection (I had none last
Sunday - this was not a good thing especially after the extremely close
call with the speeding biker)


skate   hard
dance   hard
sk8ance hard  :)

I basically agree with you and Mark, however, I question your analogy.  I
think meditation and psychedelic experiences will perhaps enhance the
quality of life (I am being generous here for my trips have been fun but
have not enhanced my life one bit) but they are not requisite to enjoy a deep
and meaningful life.

The last trip I took was almost my final trip.  I almost discovered the
meaning of the universe (it had something to do with second-guessing and
the motivation of events and action).  Nevertheless, when I returned to
planet earth I hadn't the foggiest notion of what that meaning was.  LSD
destroys the ego which lies between the id and superego; when that ego was
put back into place I lost whatever I had gained.
Now, when I am meditating, whether it is on the dancefloor or while
running (exercise helps me accomplish the state), I have no need to figure
out the meaning of the universe; I am the universe.  I am part of the
whole, I AM.  There is extasy in that moment, I enter a state when mind
and body and soul are ALIVE.  And guess what?  When I return to the
isolation of the individual, I REMEMBER it.  I remember what I had gained
because I am permanently altered by the experience.  It has incorporated
itself into my being.  It is not the removal of something (the ego) but
the addition of something (wholeness).
My personal view on psychedelics and meditation.

first of all id like to give a great big thanks to cindy kawakami for
letting me stay at her place in sf and for picking me up at the airport
and showing me around town - thank you very much! i had a great time!

well, phew- where do i start???? friday i got into sf around 8pm, and
cindy met me  at the gate- from there we drove to twin peaks to look at
the awesome view of the lights, the city and the bay... we then went back
to cindy's place, where i met rob and jeno the cat (a very nutty cat i
must say) - we tried to figure out something to do but there didnt seem to
be too much going on.... there was a renegade that night but the location
(outdoors no less) wasn't announced until like 3:30 - and i was smashed
from the 3 hour difference- so i hung around cindy's for a while then
called susie up and went over to her place in the haight area.... i met
derek chung, ovid and a fellow chris who was staying with susie... we
watched the sf orb show, and the full moon madness tape by the nitty
gritty video folks while waiting for the renegade location to be
announced.... at about 4am i decided that i would have to get some sleep
and i walked back to cindy's place and crashed (susie neglected to tell me
that i'd be walking across the panhandle - the location of most crime in
her area - oh well :) ) 

at 6am i was awoken by the very loud meowing of jeno - and then he somehow
got the door to cindys room open and came in and began meowing in my face
and generally trying to wake me up - i quickly got the cat out of the room 

saturday cindy and i walked around chinatown, went to the golden gate
bridge, and north beach -we went to a couple of used bookstores, ate at a
chow mein place, and generally milled around until she had to be at work -
at which time she dropped me off at susies place where i hung out with
chris.... later on that afternoon susie got back from classes and brian
and laura came over, who i had met fri nite (or was it sat morning- my
chronology is messed up :) ) - and we all hung out until it was time to
get something to eat... after dinner chris and i went to brian and lauras
awesome appartment until it was time to go to the cube.

when we first got to the blue cube there werent that many people there so
i tried to meet the folks that were already there - i met sooo many cool
people there that night - way too many to list - all very freindly
people!! a big shout out to you all! derek was down stairs spinning so i
went down and started dancing.. people started to come in and it started
getting hotter and the energy kept building up.  the sound system wasnt
loud at all at that time, but it has to be one of the cleanest, crispest
sound system ive heard! i'm not quite sure who was spinning when- but i
think it was ethan's set that i really got into, along with jon drukmans
and lauras- phat tunes spun by all this night though!!!!!  by midnight i
think (or maybe i was losing track of time) the downstairs room was just
packed, and hot as a sauna - but i couldnt quit dancing because of all of
the energy and intense music -- i havent seen much quite like this on the
east coast yet.... i liked the black light downstairs- it really made the
sfr banner look incredible, and lauras laser too :)

by 4:30 or so i was beat- still unused to the time difference so i caught
a ride back with brian and laura and a carload of other folks - thank you
brian for going out of your way to drop me back by cindy's!

i must say i had an incredible time in sf this weekend and met soooo many
cool people - i didnt meet as many people at the cube party as i would
have liked to but i was just so overcome by the energy and the nusic i had
to dance!

big thansk go out to resonate for sharing his home with everyone, bryce,
ethan, all the dj's, and everyone who helped w/ friends and family for a
wonderful party, and to everyone there for being so friendly and emanating
a massive vibe for everyone!!!

i had to kind of leave sf abruptly b/c i was worried about getting back to
school for classes- i almost got stuck in charlotte, NC last night b/c of
all the bad weather..... but i will be back, hopefully very soon!

peace out!

I stand corrected.  Does anybody out there happen to have stats on
all three of the models we've been talking about so much lately?

...into an incredible experience of vibe, music, and family.

Friends and Family at the Blue Cube was the best party I've ever
attended. You couldn't have put any more vibe and positive energy into
that room. There'd be spontaneous combustion :).  I've never seen so
many people having so much fun.

Practically everyone I know on a first name basis showed up.
Practically everyone I know who DJs showed up :). Talk about a family
presence!

Jon Drukman and Laura just fucking SHREDDED. People couldn't stop
dancing if they tried. I loved how they were interacting with the
crowd, sharing the energy, and really getting into the music.
They just took the roof off. My socks are gone. Somebody help me frown
:).

And Laura, welcome to the city of love. What a way to start :).

Upstairs we had Amit improvising on the keyboards. Wow. We had the
chill out room. We had the trip toys ("Oh my God!").

Many thanks to Steve, Ethan, and Bryce for putting this together.
And thanks to Greg Mosheh and others who helped with setup and moving
gear. These parties, I think, have a bright future. I think there'll
be a lot more underground parties, and a lot more good vibe and
friendly personal presence.

And thanks to all of YOU who showed up and shared your positive
energy. This is what it's all about.

Words cannot do justice to this party. A 10 out of 10, it was
everything I always wanted a party to be, and more. Let's do it
again :).

Just wanted to thank Resonate, Ethan, Bryce and everyone else who
helped put this on.  The things that stick out for me were:

- As crowded as the Blue Cube got, I think that the lack of smoke was
the key to keeping the space hospitable.  It's a drag to have to police
people, but I have to give points to Resonate for enforcing this.

- The music was great.  The progression of energy from Ethan
to Jon to Laura really worked for me.  I especially peaked on Laura's
set.  Just the kind of good hard trance that I love, similar to stuff
I've heard Goa Gil play, except that Laura can beat match.  The volume
was a bit low, but that probably kept the party from being busted.
Mescalina played some interesting stuff that was a little dark for
where my head was at, but this just added to the variety that made
the whole evening special.

- Live music.  The keyboard playing in the kitchen and the 
digideroos made this party feel like a real participatory happening.
This is what raving is all about - the party is *us*.

- Infectious vibe.  There were quite a few people who heard about this
party and stopped by on the way to Organic, and stayed.  One house
scene old-timer remarked to me "So this is being put on by your
SFRaver net friends?  What a wonderful party!"  It was great to see 
quite a few people outside the SFR community having a such a good time.

- The people.  I'm not sure how many attended, I would guess 200+.
For such a packed open house party, everyone seemed respectful of
the place and each other.  I have to applaud the lack of alchohol
and the enhanced vibe for some of this, but mostly, it was just a
reflection of just how cool our community is.

- New UVC.  Jon unveiled a preliminary version of the new UVC single.
ALthough it didn't blow me away, it's definately a well crafted, solid 
tune.  No doowop vocals, though.

I've founds stats for headphones and speakers to be almost completely
meaningless. The only meaningful metric is one's ears. 

The only stat I even bother to look at anymore is "Headphone output
voltage". This tells me at a glance whether I need even bother
listening to it. I find a tape or CD player that won't give me
sufficient headphone output pretty infuriating.

I wonder how hard it would be to build a small headphone amp? That
could come in *really* handy at times. Especially if it was small and
portable.

well, i dont know about the time that you were there, but when i was there
i enjoyed it, people i was with didnt, but i did
so maybe i just have lousy taste in music
the music that was bieng played was a bit fast and sometimes
overly break beatish, i liked a lot of the stuff that was being done
on top of the beat that was screwing happily with my mind

what did you find annoying about the music? that same stuff or was it
different music? 

i think there is a lot of bad music out there in general of every genre
and i probably was just relating good music of one sort to 
bad music of another, but i probably am even confusing music names
and saying that house really kicks ass cuz im calling acid house

Unfortunately I left the stats at my parent's house.  Off hand I can tell you
the following:  the V6 was a consumer line headphone (that you could get at
most dept. stores) while the 7506 are professional line (that can only be
found at specialty/pro music stores.  I could only find them at Sam Ash).
Also, the bottom end has been cleaned up.  The bass sounds better.

Build an amp?  Look no further, this is one of the other selling points of 
the 7506.  The output is a *lot* louder than the v6.  I was really impressed 
by this.  Check it out & see for yourself.  Ack, I sound like a commercial!?!

Was this the SHIT or what!!!
 
Megaprops to the Friends & Family Massive . . . to Resonate, whose
preparation and patience were readily apparent . . . to Ethan & Bryce
and all the others who planned and spread the word and hauled the gear
and cleaned up the mess (which made me feel a little guilty over leaving
without helping, but circumstances &c . . .!)
 
I got into the Cosmic Launch Mode right at 9 pm for my first ever public
decktrip.  Overall, it was a big kick.  The list is below for posterity
such as it may be.  My mix&match skills, quite shaky anyway, were
put to the test by my first encounter with the ubiquitous Galaxy mixer
and the confines of a small space.  (But I have to say, after seeing the
Water Temple FMM video last night with someone holding an umbrella to
keep the rain off Markie Mark while he was on the decks that I have *no*
reason to complain, not to mention C II with "so much rain on the records
that the needle made a *wake*", dealing with conditions as they are is
part of the Calling . . . but I digress . . .)  However, I appreciated
the comments in favor of the tracks put forth.  It's certainly not the
last time I'll be doing this!
 
In retrospect, I thought briefly that I might have erred too much in
the deephouse direction, and I could have tranced quite a bit more
(hey, I could have just mixed together the entire new DIY double disc
collection with excellent results!), but actually on third-thought
I was pretty pleased/honored to have the easy task of starting any
old way I wanted to and presenting the sounds that intrigue/move me
the most right now.
 
And that alone would have been a lifetime highlight for me, but things
hadn't even "got to the *cool* stuff yet," not by a longshot.  The rest of
the party reached cinematic levels, and I'm sure we all saw diferent
versions of*that* movie! In my case, I spent most of the time cocooned
in the chill space, and ventured into the garage at length only at the
end.  I was very highly impressed by Bryce's fine presentation and
especially by Amit's amazing relaxophonics, a smooth sailboat of live
trancey loops and keyboards that was perfect for my state of mind.
And Jesse's amazing dubtime, which had me almost convinced of trying
to talk him intohrowing in some of the Augustus Pablo stuff I have,
except I ended up not bringing it and I wouldn't generally want to impose
on another DJ's presntation in any event (but it was the thought that
mattered y'see!).  And Ethan, muttering at the end about playing house
for the first time ever in public ("Second!" corrected Bryce) but the
perfect energy pickup after the long languid night of musical starsailing.
 
And all the DJs I missed or don't know ther names, whose presence built
the fabric we all rolled around in, hanging/meditating/discussing . . .
The sheer level of musicality and excellence in this crew just amazes me.
As a little button I have says, "Creativity is intelligence having fun!"
This was one of the few parties I spent more time relaxed into the music
instead of dancing because I realized that any choice I made at the time
would be the correct one.  Yowsa & selah . . .!
 
The New School, the re-evolution of rave.  Amazin', ain't it!
 
I can't wait to hear all the tapes, although mine will sound a bit rough
(I managed to hit the line instead of cue switch once and dropped a few
seconds, plus the mis-hit mixes and, y'know, rookie errors but what the
hell!).  I was especially pleased to model the weh-kewl uk-dance shirt
and spin 'Disintegrate' in honor of Taylor 808 and the ne-raves crew, and
Mike, Randall and Jim and the Twitch collection which is the core of my
new obsession and one hell of a body of great musical work.

Finally I emerge from the dark recesses of sfraveland, lingering where
I can see but not be seen, into full fledged postmanship. In case you
aren't sure who I am, I'm Graham, the guy who disappeared for a year
into the war-torn Urban African hinterland, only to return to the
beautiful Bay and bounce around on the fringes of the UVC posse and
the Ramona/Cyborganic realm. Crazy red dancing thing on my arm and
hair that seems to hang a little longer each day, that's me.

Anyway, I'm writing to thank those of you who took the time to fill
out the "Stark Raving Survey" that I handed out to some upstairs at
the Blue Cube on Saturday night. Your responses provide a valuable
angle to the whole research project by showing a little of the
character of smaller undergroundier events that surround the
mainstream rave scene. For those of you who didn't fill it out (mostly
becuase I was too busy bugging out to Jon D's religious wizardry to
hand out any more), you'll have to catch us at another event. The word
is that we won't be posting the survey on the net, for reasons that
have more to do (I hope) with statistical balances than
technologyphobia. The idea is to survey people at the events.

I will keep this list informed of the results, possibly making the
final report available on line when it comes out, and I will try to
answer any questions you have. Thanks again, take care, keep on
bursting with that legendary and irrestable energy, smile to the
stars, and I'll see you on the dance floor.

Hello San Francisco!

I've been here for over a week and I don't think I've posted
anything to sfraves.

Let's see . . . Brian, Cece (my cat) and I have an apartment up
in Twin Peaks now.  Once we get everything unpacked we'll see 
about a house-chilling party.  We can't have a house-warming
one (with dance music) because rave-force music would cause 
eviction, but a chill party would work great. Humm, maybe *THIS* 
will convince that ambient DJ "Vitamin B" to come out of retirement!

I'm working down in Menlo Park and so far like it (I've only
been there for 3 days).  And the commute isn't bad at all --
50 minutes and the traffic isn't all jammed up since I'm heading
southbound.  Of course, this means my weeknight party choices are
a bit limited because I have to get up weekday mornings, but every
so often I can make an exception and come in late.  I intend to go
to SpaceLab tomorrow since I'm taking Friday off to wait for the
moving van to come and deliver my furniture.

Now for rave-related stuff (after all, this is sfraves):

Friends and Family at the Blue Cube was brilliant.  Thanks to
everyone for everything they did.  You all might not believe this,
but I'm actually a very shy person and hate going to parties where
I have to talk to people I don't really know.  Well, the vibe and
people were so great last Saturday that I didn't have a problem at
all.  I talked to a lot of people who I don't know (and who's names
I don't quite remember, unfortunately) and had tons of fun.

Something pretty funny happened while I was spinning:  since Rocky
was up next to me working with the CD player, people would come up
to him and complement him on the music if I happened to be bent over
digging through my crate.  

I really liked what Amit was doing with his music, and think Dr. Teeth
is a great performance name.  I used to adore the Muppet Show.

Anyway, thanks for everything everyone.  It's wonderful to move nearly
3000 miles to a new city and immediately feel a part of things.
What happened at the Blue Cube was EXACTLY what I meant when I said
that list parties shouldn't fail.  The set up was perfect, people
drummed up excitement and brought their friends, and the whole thing
worked.  Now that we know how to do it, let's do it again!  

Love and community,

Laura

Well, this didn't quite do it for me.

I visited Together last night, at its new home at 1015.  I listened to
an excellent acid jazz set, and a fine transition from acid jazz into
house (with a brief stop at reggae and dub).  Unfortunately, the sound
systems were as loud as all get out.  I talked with the person who
identified himself as "in charge of the sound", to no avail.  Unfortunately,
whether i have picky ears or what, the adjustments just weren't enough
for me, and i left with my ears ringing for the rest of the night.

Bob's right about the crowd not picking up downstairs until about 1AM.
The upstairs never took off while i was there (unfortunately, because
the upstairs system seems much better than the one downstairs).

The decorations/ambience was first class, however, and the people, overall

    i agree that the fnf party was ON!  i came with two non-sfravers/ravers     
    we all had a great time though
    dancing in the err...garage/trancateria.  planted myself early on right in
    front of the speakers - such great sound, i wanted more volume!  but
    slumbering neighbors and all...the space got really crowed at times and
    HOT too...had to move to where the fan was to cool off but kept dancin.
        jon d. sounded great (who was that before him?  good stuff too).  missed
    others before that, oh well next time.  all
    people we met were xtremely friendly and movin.  look forward to more
    of these kinds-o-parties.  thanks to resonate for the hospitality and
    ethan, byrce for the sound, all the djs for the music - and everyone else   
    for the smiles.  did DJ Krunch ever get to spin?

    bye  (the guy with the jellyfishes on his chest)

    btw - amy and sameh say hi too!

     Personally i think that this is a great idea. But then again, i think
that there are a lot of things that need benefits, and i am the type that
is out on some sort of small mission to heal the world. But anyway, all
that aside, count me in, let my vote be yea, and let me know how i can
help.

Groovin to a better world...

Subject: Hi, I'm back -- and F&F
To: sfraves@techno.Stanford.EDU
Date: Thu, 20 Jan 1994 09:25:54 -0800 (PST)

We probably don't need another post on F&F, but I felt a need to say
something.

If you don't know me, hi, I'm Stevie.  That's what I'm called in rave land
mostly, anyway, you can also call me Steve or Steven if you prefer.  I used
to be around a lot more than I have been the past few months, but what with
finding a major I like and really diving into academics, getting involved in
a serious relationship, and moving into an apartment together, going out got
lost in the shuffle most of the time.

Hopefully that'll be changing.  Because I had a *great* time at
Friends&Family.  I didn't even really dance that much (I have a hard time
getting into a groove when it's so crowded, but that's just me) but just
being with all the "gang" - Brian B, Laura, Susie, Marlo, Cin, Jo, Mykl,
Steve, everyone - made me realize a coupla things.  First, these are all
really wonderful people and I shouldn't neglect them.  I would benefit
greatly by spending more time around them.  Second, if I got around and met
some more of the people at these parties, I would find even *more* wonderful
people and I would run the risk of being asphyxiated by wonderfulosity,
which probably wouldn't be so bad.

'S funny, because I actually have known Steve for a while (met him at the
same party I met my sig O, matter o' fact) but I didn't know that he'd moved
to SF, changed his net-name to resonate, gotten so involved in sfraves, or
that the Blue Cube was his house until I got there.  Small world.

The thing about the party (this message loses point on cohesiveness and
flow, I know) was that it was a really comfortable place.  Sometimes even at
parties where I know a lot of people I don't really feel like I "fit in"
entirely.  I guess I'm still a little shy; I sometimes feel like a little
kid or a goofball at raves.  Not sure why.  But at any rate, I didn't feel
like that at F&F.  That has a little to do with me growing up a bit, but it
has a lot to do with the party-throwers maintaining a good atmosphere, and
discouraging people from "looking down their noses" as people have done at
some of the parties I've been to.  I saw that Steve made an effort to go
around and try to talk to all the people there and let everyone know what it
was all about.

The point is that I'm hoping to get more involved.  I don't have the time to
get as involved as some people here do; I'm glad to help out some setting up
and tearing down parties, but I can't pretend to have the motivation to put
in the effort that people like Brian, Bryce, Ethan, Steve, Lee, and Geoff
have done, much as I might like to.  But I'll try to do my part to feed the
vibe.  It might be hard, because I am extremely serious about my studies,
and also unfortunately my sig O Jolie likes raves not at all, and I don't
want her to be a "rave widow" but I'll try to make it out as much as I can.

You know, though, there is one way I might be able to contribute - I'm doing
independent study at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies.  In
computer and electronic music at the research level, there is some crazy
incredible avant-garde type shit going down, very little of which is
trickling down to techno and house music.  I'd like to see if it's possible
to apply some of this stuff in a form you can still dance to.  Two things
that immediately come to mind are first, the manipulation of MIDI data.
This is the concept that when you hit a key on the keyboard, you don't have
to just play that note, but the fact that you pressed it and how long and
how hard you pressed it can be used as just one element of a data stream
that can be manipulated by random or not-so-random processes to create
music seemingly totally different.  Second, the idea of alternative
controllers.  Instead of just plinking on a keyboard, one can play a MIDI
guitar (and as someone who likes distorted-guitar rock, the idea of mixing
the sound of the direct guitar output with the synthesized MIDI is
intriguing), slide controllers, wands that you can wave around and bang
against things, and gloves that you can use to make music with gestures.  I
like the idea of constructing big huge cranks or levers or whatever that you
have to put a lot of physical effort into to get MIDI data out of.  I don't
know if these or any other projects could really pan out, but it's a
thought.  ANy comments?

Well, sorry this is so long, but I wanted to voice and extended Hello Again.

thanks for reading,
stevie

I think this is a very good idea,   and it might even be possible
to get media interest in this,   and be a wonderful opportunity for
us to get the word out that we are NOT the druggies that the media

I was thinking maybe you guys are getting tired of the same old blabber

other people do guest intros for the calendar.  I'm still compiling
and sending the calendar out, so keep on sending those flyers.  If
anyone wants to volunteer to write the intro, send me mail, and maybe
I'll be actively seeking volunteers also.  Anyway, this week's guest
hostess is Susie Kameny...

P.S. I'd like to add that our man Ethan is spinning at SpaceLab tonight.
   Also lotsa out-of-town celebs are here for the Billboard Dance Music
   Seminar, being held at SF Pan Pacific Hotel till the 21st.

I think that having a rave for -just- LAravers is a bit tasteless.  There are a
lot of suffering people down there, and should we hold a benefit, it should be
for Everyone, regardless of their musical tastes.

True. I have a feeling that there are many others who could use the help
more. Some friends of mine in Santa Barbara are organizing such an event,

Wow. Ever have one of those nights when the music was perfect, the sound 
system was perfect, the location was great, the hosts and promoters were 
great people, and everyone was so vibed-up that you couldn't have a bad 
time if you tried? That was the party at the Blue Cube.

Resonate, Steve, the same guy who put on the fabulous New Year's Party, 
let Ethan and Bryce use his house for the party. He opened up the whole 
house, bought food, and even provided a terminal (heheheh) for people 
who'd want to log in in the middle of the best party I have ever seen.

All night long, the music was fantastic. I don't know who all played, but 
there were great, every one of them. By name, I know that Seth, Laura, 
John D., and Ethan spun downstairs, while Bryce, Fred (Phred), and Crunch 
played upstairs. Amit came on sometime during the night (who cares about 
TIME with that much vibe going on?) and synthed some really sweet ambient 
tunes. Everybody just poured their hearts and their energy into the party 
and made it a beautiful experience.

One of the highlights of my night, I think, was standing on the steps 
with a bunch of people I didn't know and suddenly saying "Excuse me, but 
I need to go hug someone." Suddenly, some guy who was walking past me 
stopped, turned around, and hugged me! Wow! That was great!

I really don't think I have _ever_ had that much fun at a party. It 
really must suck to be anyone in the world who couldn't make it. Thank 
you, everyone who was there, everyone who helped with it, for making it 
what it was. I love you all!

Our guest speakers are experts on the rave scene and are here today
to comment on Satruday's party at the Blue Cube:
huhuh huh huhuh  That was cool. huhuh huhuhuh He said "vibe." huhuhuhuh

It's fine with me if everyone could benefit, but the truth is that
we may only raise a couple of hundred dollars, which might be better spent
targeted toward one person/org/situation then just handing it over to the red
cross (Which I hope we don't do), not that the red cross isn't useful but I 
think we can be more efficient then they when it comes to financial relief.

I just have a bad taste in my mouth from the way the red cross handled
themselves and others up here when we had our earthquake.

meet b4 INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH on sat.  I'm up for that maybe early (11-12)
because this event will prob. be  $20 (any info or get-there-b4 deals ?)
and i for one hate walking into the $20 with 4 hours left.  I've been
tring to think of a all ages type place to meet, no good ideas yet.
I'll be near where market goes under the 101 fell/laguna exit. So there
is always the orbit room on the corner of market and laruna (i think),
it is open late.  Any other ideas?  any ideas on the local? any ideas if
Sharon has his shit together on this one? (been to really good parties
(devotion was just fucking great) and a coupled canceled ones, must
mention that hardcore at the fashion center was also one of the best
times i ever had too).  I'll be driving up to the city friday and will
lose internet access at 4pm friday ( havn't got that damn notebook
(yet);) so if any wants to get in touch with me or needs a ride to the
party (if its driving distance i prefer cad if i can) i can be reached
at 415.864.8274 my girlfriends place. 

could some on fwd the rave guide since mine was munched, thank you.

Oh yeah i went to spun daz for the project open hand benifit (thx to the
list for the info, good cause).  Really good party.  i stayed in the
smaller room where dubtribe played most of the night that room at least
went off. for the first time is desired and recived in-n-outs. all n all

Okay, everyone WANTS a meeting yet no one has come up with
a concrete place or time.

So, here's what we'll do -- I will be home ALL DAY on Saturday,
unpacking my wordly belongings since the moving van is arriving
Saturday morning.

I just called the info line and they didn't say what time the party
starts or where it is ("central San Francisco") but I'm thinking
people can show up at my house after they've had dinner -- like 9
pm -- and we can hang until it's time to go to the party.  If people
want to meet for dinner somewhere they'll have to figure it out
because I don't know the places to eat and probably won't be going out
to eat anyway.

My address:  545 Burnett Ave. #105 (in Twin Peaks)

	     (415) - 642 - 9734

If you can find a bus map the 37 goes around my neighborhood and

The writing is a bit nutty. It's just far enough into the Zone that I
had a hard time taking it seriously ("uh, yeah"). The essay on the

message, it kept making me think: "Shrooms. It had to be shrooms."

(Remember that one page essay that was on the table a lot at YSH? The
one that spells Neitzsche 5 different ways and goes on and on

Number 1, I think the red cross is a goverment scam run to look like a 
humanitarian organization that gets money (more taxes) for disasters (and
wars) when are tax dollars should and could pay for all this and more if
we didn't spend so much on "defense", number 2, a freind of mine just told
me yesterday that he saw a red cross rep on a talk show cornered with the
accusation that they use dissasters as opportunity to pump up more money and
supplies than they actualy need and she didn't deny it and seemed caught off
guard about it and they also don't garuntee (sp?) that your money will go to
the cause they are canvasing for, in other words if three million dollars
come in for the earthquake, they just may decide to stop at two and pocket
the difference, though this may have changed there was a big stink about it
during the last flood or the bay area earthquake, I can't remember which.

I know they do a lot of good too, but I think there are more direct channels
to put money throug, rather than using middle men who are so large they need
a lot of your money just for organization and logistics.

but the pace isn't quite as manic and the sounds tend to be less

And if the Chicago posse doesn't do it for you, there's always Garth,

Jonah.

Sharon raves are usually in the $15 to $20 range.

The rave will be in "virgin warehouse space".  The definition of "virgin
warehouse space" is "a warehouse that has never been used for a rave before,
but that will probably be busted between 1 and 2 am."

Hi folks,

My name is Glenn (aka Tigger) and a group of friends and I have started a
weekly event called the Choc-Lit Factory in Seattle.  Opening night was
last Friday which went off beatifully.  Admission was $5,  w/ free water
and cheap consessions.  The vibe and atmosphere was very similar to what
I've read about your postings regarding Friends and Family.  Lot's o
smiling, happy vibed out folks making connections.  I would especially like
to thank DubTribe for being there and launching a vibe intensity of
inter-galactic proportions.  

The Choc-Lit factory is cooperative venture.  Whatever small profit we've
made so far is being invested right back into it.  Our format will be
changing weekly with various nights dedicated to funk, house,
trance,tribal, etc...  and since the location is in a theater we are able
to change the setup and sometimes have actual built sets from the plays
that are going on during regular hours.  We'll also be incorporating dance
and ritual performances with our parties!

In any case, I would like to get feedback and advise from you sfravers
about what to do in the circumstance that I currently find myself in.
Based on the success of our opening night, a couple of promoters from other
production crews have expressed their concern that a Choc-Lit Factory the
night before their massives would hurt their party.  They have requested
that I NOT do a Choc-Lit Factory on a couple of dates in the upcoming
months.  I've expressed to those promoters that we would be willing to do a
theme or format that would be different (i.e. a funk, or ambient dub night)
so as to not have an overlap as far as the crowd is concerned.  But, they
are adamant about NO Choc-Lit Factory at all.  What do you think, folks? 
I'm trying to find a win-win situation so's that everyone can be at least

I look forward to hearing from you.  Kindess, joy, love and happiness to

well, first off, it's easy to bash the promoters over this, but at the
same time, my first raves were in seattle, and i can understand.  the
scene up there is very small, and it's definitely possible that a
really good vibed-out party the night before a massive might well keep
some of the crowd away.

you are never going to get something which you'll both be totally
happy with, because they've already said that the only thing which
would make them happy is no choco-lit factory the night before, and
you've already said that you want to keep having them (basically)
whenever it works with your schedule.

options:

1) give in.  it's a small scene, there are plenty of nights for
everyone and splitting up the crowd is bad.  i don't think this makes
a lot of sense, though, especially as they are basically telling you
that there are entire weekends that you shouldn't throw a party.  this
sounds greedy and unreasonable.  besides, if they are worried about
their investment, they should shift to smaller more inexpensive
parties.  (i'm sure a lot of your success is due to the very
reasonable $5 cover.)

2) passively advertise the other events at your event.  set up a flyer
table and get flyers from promoters.  they might reach new people and
improve their draw.  this is easy and just helps build the scene,
imho.  you can never lose by advertising other events --- if the other
events are cool, it strengthens the scene, if they turn out to be
lame, you'll get more return customers coming to your event.

3) actively advertise the other events at your event.  poster, large
flyer, perhaps even print the event info for the next night on
"tickets" for your event.  could be considered overly commercial tho.

4) merge.  throw events in conjunction with another promoter.  sell
joint tickets to your event and their event the next night.  have a
special "choco-lit factory MASSIVE" where you provide the style /
direction and the other promoter provides logistics / advertising /
financial backing.  of course there are all the caveats that one
should observe when working with others and $$ is involved.

just my $1.67.  and good job!  i'll have to check it out next time i
get home (probably memorial day)...

So have your party on the nights OF their massives :-)

Seriously, you have plenty of options.  You can either (a) ignore them (I
would), (b) have a Choc-Lit after their party (maybe during the day),
(c) go in with them if they aren't too hokey and have a Choc-Lit
chamber (thereby ensuring that at least some of your friends are
guaranteed a good time), or (d) comply with them (which I wouldn't
consider acceptable more than once or twice for special parties).

I think the these promoters you're talking to don't deserve to have

not sure if this is serious or sarcasm.
ummm....
okay i'll admit right now that having got in at 2:30 last nite
and having my alarm set at 7:00 
and not actually getting to sleep til 3, 3:30.. im not
in a very fit physical condition,
and i do very much plan on going out again tonite
BUT
tomorrow i do get to sleep in, so... :)

last nite, though, while i was sitting under the speakers
in a very trance like state i was realizing how good the music makes me feel
and maybe it is escapism,
but then again if youre in the hospital and really sick
and someone comes by and makes you laugh and feel happy
and forget your situation, thats escapism too
except a lot of people saying that laughter is the best medicine,
so is it escapism or healing?

i think that feeling the music and being freed spiritually by it
and the people around me is very healing

of course, if one spent all her time laughing, the she would only get sicker
and it one spent all her time raving, well i think everyone pretty
much says that balance is a good thing

Steve Masters rotates taped mixes during his "modern mix" occasionally
instead of doing live sets each time and there's this one that is
probably 3/4 made up of great summer-of-92 choonz.  Including a couple
of Twitch mixes.  He also occasionally plays sets that are only a few
months out of date.  I usually try to hear the "modern mix" when I
can... nothing really new, but usually good and ocassionally nostalgic
(mid-late 80's dance music mixes... vicious pink, kon kan, other
razormaid type stuff).

I say work with them on an individual basis,
ask yourself (and them) would they be willing to change dates
for you in the future?, How often will they be asking for this type
of favor?, See if they are willing to combine parties.  Otherwise
i say go for broke!

Geoff White said something about it being a shame that Industrial 
Strength and L P de V are the same night because it further widens 
the "rift" between the house and techno scenes.

When will people realize that there doesn't HAVE to be a rift.  I've 
been to so many events out East where there were both house and techno 
DJs on the same bill.  It all lies in picking the right DJs and scheduling 
them at the right times.  Heck, F&F had a mixture and that worked really
well.

It all lies in finding a balance.  Some people hate breakbeat, but putting 
a good breakbeat dj on the night will please the breakbeat lovers, not be 
so long as to annoy the breakbeat haters, and might reach the open-minded 
or new people in between.  Ditto for any other sub-genre of dance music.

What I hear isn't so much that people can't stand house or techno or hardcore 
or breakbeat, they just don't enjoy the same stuff all night long.  So mix 
it up and give it variety!  Even I, hard techno lover that I am, get 
annoyed of hour after hour of 160 bpm Belgian mayhem.  I have to be in a 
certain kind of mood and have a certain kind of energy (and a certain kind 
of, er, assistance) to do the all night all hardcore thing.  Last time I 
was in the mood was last April.  It was one of the more brilliant raves I've
ever been to, mainly because I was totally in the mood and I totally wanted 
to be there.

One more thing:  one night of a hardcore/techno rave isn't going to make 
or break any "rift" any more than having one more all-night all-house party.  
It just *is*, that's all.  And besides, if there were only ONE party in all 
of SF worth going to on a given Saturday night, that party would be so big 
and so crowded that it would have lots of annoying logistial problems.
People should have choices, people should have fun.  It looks like there
are a few good choices this weekend, so people will have ample chances

is great but this sounds like pressure or demands bein put on you.  There are
regular and unregular on every night of the week around here and when/if the
scene can't support it a natural balance happens and the weaker parties don't
make it.  If your parties are good in a large or growing scene there should
be enough bussiness for everybody, if your parties aren't good in a large or

I enjoyed myself immensely at F & F but umm, ther was no (or very
little) HOUSE (in the full no-sell-out sense of the word) played there.
I realize that some people have a different definition of House music
then I do, this has been an ongoing thing with me for several weeks
around here, I've been talking to people who feel about true House music
in SF like you feel about Hardcore in SF PEOPLE JUST DON'T LISTEN TO IT!
Well hopefully I and a few other people around are hoping to start some
type of regular deep house party for the true believers.

This is true, I love Hardcore in the early part of the night up to about
midnight or one, I get all my pent-up aggression out but eventually I`ll want

Yeah it's an awfully big town. Unless the promoters are actively
fighting each other, I don't think competition has to be a rift. 

I think it's really fun to go check out music I don't normally listen
to. Yeah give me a 135bpm slammin' house beat any day. Or some spaced
out hard trance. But recently I've had a good time listening to music
at Spacelab (acid-acid-acid), a cool Chicago-house groove by Mark
Farina in Sacramento, some totally tribal on a DRC tape, and so on.

Long before I ever listened to house, I noticed a pattern in that the
music I really love and stay with over the years I almost inevitably
don't like at first. Don't know why. But knowing that, I give music a
_lot_ of chances before I give up on it.

I'm going to Industrial Strength because I want to hear some *fast* in
your face mind blowing supertweak fucking hardcore. Let's do it!

I agree with Laura that F&F was extremely diverse- Derek and Giamma were
very housy, but that was at the beginning, so a lot of people missed it. 
Jon D. tends to get pretty damn housefunkay in the middle of his set. 
Laura even got a weensy bit housy there near the end of her set :)
My set was pretty acid-centered (although I held back a little bit since
it was 4-5 in the morn).  Ethan even claims to have spun house for the
"first time".  I guess Geoff wanted the real deep Chicago kinda deal, but
for an SFR dj's only party, we were incredibly diverse, and it worked!  I
think it would be easy to schedule a lineup of deep Chicago house, acid,
trance, tribal, hardcore, and funk.  In fact, it would be great!  I'd like
to see more diverse lineups at parties, big and small. But anyway, I've
gotta run to work, maybe I'll see some of you tomorrow night at Laura's
(and Brian's).  I haven't decided yet if I want to go to Indus. Strength.

ok, how to answer.. the spacelab i was at was befor xmas... what i heard was
alot of one very loud tone (sounded to me like an air raid or an emergency
broadcoast tone or something) but not alot of beat... that's really all i
remember by now....it was not very dancable to me...and i was trying.... noone
else was.. as i've said/...its not to fair to judge something by one listening
or an event by one visit...so that the end of that...

i also think it's sort of funny that the whole house vs. techno or whatever
thing is still on... i agree its all house (to me, thats at least what i use as
an umbrella for the whole gengre... i mean it is ACID house right...)

a funny story:
winter of 91 zanzibar did a sunday morning thing called toon-down (it tended to
be after toon-town,,,duh) that featured the hardkiss boyz... kevin b. who sort
of ran the music at the club had this stoopid ' no techno' rule...(kevin was
SERIOUSLY into very deep old school house) which was regularly ignored, much to
kb's annoyance, and ignored especially by the hardkisses.. i remeber robbie
once saying "fuck deep house, nobody dances, and i put on some toony techno and
i've got em dancing on the bar" and he did, too.

what i mean it, if it has a vibe, and people are digging it and its NEW
(dammit, that how this whole damn thing started) than that's what matters.

About all of this negativity surrounf=ding Sharon.  OK so some of you 
think this is associated with Sharon (I've been told it wasn't), but 
anyway supposing it is.  My first rave almost two years ago was A Rave 
Called Sharon Hardcore 1 and it was one of the best raves I've ever been 
to.  It introduced me in a large way to the rave scene and looking back 
it may have been one of the contributors to the commercialization and 
sudden explosion of the rave scene in the summer of '92 (luckily I was in 
Paris raving!!!)  but when I came back the scene was dilapidated and 
overgrown.  But in reality look what it has turned into.  The real people 
who care are overcoming this to promote smaller parties and a bigger 
sense of community.  Anyway I'm babbling but all of you who are for some 
reason not liking Sharon you need to learn to live and let live and maybe 
even forgive or forget about it and do your thing without stomping all 
over other people's prerogative.

I also think F&F went a long way toward healing this false "rift". I too
like a varied diet, but when I say Chicago House does a lot more for me,
that's just me and I'm not putting down anyone else's tastes.  Like JSL
said recently, "IMHO" is redundant and should be continually understood
implicitly!

One thing I liked so much about F&F was not just the diversity
of styles, but that the DJ's were more gradual than abrupt in their
transitions, which is really important but hard to do well!

The only reason Geoff and I were lamenting the overlap of the two events
was otherwise we would have a chance to be immersed in the music you hard
beat folx lean towards (actually, I got a full-on dose of that at Essense
IV in NYC).  I'd love to check out Heather Heart, but there's no way
I'm going to miss this Chicago xtravaganza!

Subject: Deep house vs. Techno
Status: 


Here's my .01 trillion cents on the Deep house vs. Techno choice.

Certain vibrations of people attract people to different styles, speeds of 
music.  Whatever speed/style of music resonates best with your internal
resonance at a particular point in time, go with it.  

Hard core techno is definitely hard core.  But there are some who can use it as
a vehicle to release pent-up feelings.  And in that way, it can be perfect to 
go with the hard-core flow until it's time to change.

Deep house is definitely deep.  But there are some who can use it as a vehicle
to express or get in touch with some aspects of their inner self.  And in that
way, it can be perfect to go with the deep house flow until it's time to 
change.

Vice versa is true too.  

Why do people have musical tastes??  I ain't gonna ansa dat one, but all I can
say is go wid your flow until you change.  Don't put your preference in musical
taste above others' musical tastes  AND don't allow others to mistake your 
raving about your favorite music as an attack on their fav music.

Who the fuck am I?  I dunno.  I'm just one of the 6.5 billion humans on dis
Earth.  But I love you all and have a good night out EVERYBODY!

Subject: Choclit Factory
Status: 

I just returned from an incredible trip to Seattle, checking out the
second edition of Choclit Factory at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle.
This is a now-weekly party being sponsored by a collective group
with major coordination by Tigger (Glenn Fajardo) and Dred-I (Greg
Richards).

I'm cross-posting this to sfraves because I think it's important to
hear how things are going outside the Bay Area.  They're going GREAT!

According to a handbill at the theatre:

  The Velvet Elvis Arts Lounge Theater is dedicated to all that is
  tacky and tragic, classic and kitsch.  Here, a group of actors,
  directors, musicians, designers and visual artists come together
  to work in a "creative incubator" style atmosphere -- a forum for
  local artists to mingle and exchange ideas that will ultimately
  give birth to performance supporting all disciplines.

The Velvet Elvis also sponsors the non-profit YouthCare group which
'has been providing non-coercive programs and services to runaway
and abandoned youth since 1974.  We have developed an outreach program
working with clients from YouthCare through a theater/educational
experience.  The program is designed to give young people practical
technical skills, greater self-esteem and a permanent venue for
exploring their creative abilities.'

Currently, there are two plays going back-to-back at the Velvet Elvis.
At 8 pm they're running 'Kerouac', a 'jazz play' with Vincent Balestri,
and then at 11 pm they have a short drama, 'Snake in the Vein.'

Then at 12:15 the curtain goes down and the Choclit Factory krewe rushes
in to set up turntables and sound, put stage props away, and set up
decorations.  Meanwhile, in the 'lobby' at the back of the theatre,
XLR8R's editor Andrew Smith and Matt Corwine, also both nw-ravers, are
setting up their gear for a chill space effect.

The theatre itself is a typical Pioneer Square Seattle space with brick
walls, high ceilings, a large stage (I know, I swept every square inch
of it three times this morning after it was all over!) and old movie
theater-type seats for the audience.  The stage is also the dancefloor
(a little bouncy, and I could only pine away for the magnificent original
hardwood floor underneath, which very well could be the best dance floor
in Seattle but we'll never know :).  The curtains are pulled back and
the DJs play at the back of the stage for the assembled massive.

And we are talking massive here -- somewhere in the neighborhood of
500 attendees over the course of the evening, and the door crew were
turning people away by 2:30 am (though that lasted only a while).
It's a bit cramped, but very congenial space, what with the tacky
Elvis painting and other miscellanea on the walls.

I liked DJs Masa (who started the evening) and Quest (who finished off
with the final chewn right at 7 am); in between was a long hip-hop oriented
period that I found a bit under my preferred pace, but it was fine to sit
in the chill area with Andrew and Matt providing ambience. 

With an after-party in November after Basics, the New Year's FreeVibe
and one Choclit under their belt, the VE crew did *no* publicity the
previous week and the place was filled but not uncomfortably so.
This shows again how a well-run event built up from months of careful
work can help shift the direction of the scene in an entire area, as
this is clearly doing in Seattle.  

The door cost to support all this -- including rental of the space which
supports the theater and its own artistic and community work, as well as
weekly expenses, DJ stipends, etc.?  

$5.

And it's being done mostly by net.ravers, applying the principles we've
learned and discussed literally worldwide over the last couple of years
here.  This is only one type of presentation that can be made, along 
with anything from house parties to outdoor renegades to true massives.
So I send this out with the advice that we 'keep on keeping on'!

I know it's hard to do this one, much less week after week.  But I'm
impressed by the dedication and spirit being put into this effort.  
When you get to do something you really want to do, there's only one
possible response, "Go for it!"  Come what may, this adds more proof
to what we all know, that the music/dance/culture scene of the future
has more resilience and flexibility than we may at times think.

I apologize for the obvious abduction of net.band.width for something

Somehow somewhere sometime I lent someone two CD's by Gabrielle Roth and
Mirrors, titled "Bones" and "Rituals", and I've just been missing them
*badly* the past couple weeks or so.  There is something incredibly
magical and transcendental about these recordings (which in turn is lacking
from her more recent techno-hip but less spiritually adventuresome works...)

If by some miraculous synchro-cyber-serendipity, you've been holding the
very copies I originally belonged to, I'll gladly swap bygones for bygones,
no questions asked.  =)

If not, and you happen to find old copies of abovementioned CD's on the
bottom of a pile you were about to run down to Ameba, could you possibly
give me a net.shout!   ... or better still if someone wants to bequeathe
their set to me as an ongoing way of sharing her work and spirit to the
Healing of the Planet/Mother (quick, somebody stop me before I start choking
on cliches...)

Anyway thanx for listening!

As much as I wanted to check out Industrial Strength, there were just
too many warning signs (missing DJ, lack of permits, 16th & Harrison 
site, overly hyped tone of phone message) for me to gamble away $20
on it.

I got to Le plaisir de vivre at around 2:30 and immediately liked it.  
There weren't a ton of people there, but it was a real friendly, vibeful
crowd; a lot of fresh, new faces, warm and happy - non of the clubby 
selfabsorbed trendoids that I've been encountering at the last few 
1015 Folsom Wicked parties.

The Chicago DJs were given the main room, there was some nice acid-jazz
going on upstairs, the SF posse were in the front room (with much
improved sound), and some interesting music was going on in the basement 
the couple of times I ventured down there.

> Those Chicago DJ's delivered as advertised; fresh, chunky,

I have to say that I was rather unimpressed with the Chicago DJs that I
heard.  The music just seemed to be too thin for me.  Maybe I missed
the good stuff.  Still, it was nice to have the variety present just for
the change of pace.  

From 2:30 to 4, there was some great stuff going on in the front room -

All in all, though, it was a good party, and I was encouraged to see

i had no interest at all in checking out industrial strength, and to
be honest, i wasn't really too psyched for this one either - i feared
it would be crowded and the music would be too housy for me.  but i
went anyway.

first pleasant surprise - i snagged a most excellent parking space.
second pleasant surprise - no line to get in.  third pleasant surprise
- it wasn't even that crowded.

we get in and the back room is where the featured chicago house DJs
are playing - what i heard back there wasn't as bad as i expected, and
in fact some of it was really fantastic - there is a sub-genre of
house wherein they take the typical beat but put really tripped out
technoish stuff on top of it.  i liked that but there wasn't enough of
it, and the DJs typically would switch back to the more commercial
stuff pretty quickly anyway.  bummer.  pluses in this room:
comfortable temperature, plenty of room for dancing.

i ventured into the front room to hear Garth ripping it up with some
hard funky stuff, which caused my feet to instantly launch into Full
On Dance Attack Mode.  unfortunately i had to quit pretty soon
afterwards because the air in this room was practically unbreathable -
it was hot and stuffy and i felt like i was taking in a lungful of
lint with each breath.  so, i went to see what was happening in the
bassment...

downstairs, thomas was playing some stuff with a funky beat but
depressingly mainstream melodies.  i decided to complete my tour of
the club by checking out the upstairs level.

the usual acid jazz crew was in the back room up and the fireplace
room was the chill-out lounge, as always.  i made a mental note to
check back there later.

i went back downstairs to say hello to thomas but he was busy handing
over the controls to jonah of spacetime continuum.  jonah started out
with some nice acidic techno.  i wound up hanging out down there quite
a bit because the highly electronic groove was just what i needed at
the moment.  however, after 4 or 5 records i began to get really
annoyed because jonah has to be one of the worst DJs i've ever heard!
his technical ability is completely non-existant.  i was fighting a
powerful urge to gut him like a trout right there and take over.  it's
no wonder san franciscans generally aren't into techno - so far all
the DJ's i've heard have blown huge chunks!  laura la gassa has more
DJ talent in her pinky than 10 jonahs but she also plays stuff that is
too hard & fast for wimpy old me.  i liked jonah's records (rarely
venturing over 130 BPM), but not in the order he played them!  it was
frustrating, to say the least.  i wish there was a techno DJ in the
city with the talent of a Jeno or Garth... say what you want about
their musical choices - they know how to construct a set and rock a
crowd.

so, back upstairs to the acid jazz room where (i think) julius was
doing a great 100 BPM hip hop set including a wonderful Beastie Boys
track...  unfortunately, he quickly veered off into that soulful
jazz-not-jazz stuff that i hate.  i seemed to be developing a knack
for wandering into a room to hear 5 minutes of good stuff followed by
lots of bad stuff.

so, back downstairs to the house room for a bit.  but 10 minutes in
there and i couldn't take it.

so, back to the front room for someone who i've never seen who was OK
but not too special, and more of that unbreathable air.

so, back to the basement for jonah again who had gone into total
ambience for a bit before cranking in a 135 BPM slammer and then into
some real low energy stuff.  i wanted to clock him so bad...

and then my energy level plummeted through the floor and i just about
passed out on my feet so i decided it was time to leave.

to sum it up: a wildly uneven and inconsistent party with lots of
different types of music to sample and spaces to inhabit.  i really
appreciated the mix of styles, but i found myself wishing that there
was a place i could go to just get into a groove and space out.

  Everyone at Industrial Strength would like to thank the many people who
supported and attended our event. After reading the mssg's regarding
Industrial Strength on this net, we would like to clarify a few things. 
 1)Heather Heart was booked and under contract to perform on the night of Jan
22, 1994 at Industrial Strength.  Heather missed her flight the morning of
our event.  It was not the fault of the promoters but the fault of the
artist.
 2)In regards to the never before used venue. We had secured (or so we
thought) a brand new werehouse - the Contract Center Annex. The police put
pressure on the management of the space not to let us proceed with our event.
This is not the first time they have done this. As a result the from
Industrial Strength are filing a law suit againt the San Francisco police
department. 
 3)EVERYTHING else promised was delivered at Industrial Strength.
  
  We thank everyone for coming out for Industrial Strength and we look
forward to seeing everyone at the next event.

Many of us knew this by early afternoon.  What bothered me was that your
phone message, updated late evening, still claimed that she would be
there.  I suppose it is possible that she never let anyone associated
with IR know.  And although the lose of original venue also may not
have been your fault, once a $20 party starts showing signs of not
having their shit together, people are going to make other choices.  

Good luck in your lawsuit against the SFPD.  We appreciate your 
clarification and I'll certainly consider attending your next party.
If it's less than $20, some of my less wealthy friends might also.

I had pretty much the same reaction at first, but as the later DJ's came on
the music got progressively deeper and less commercial.  I said goodnight
to all my friends who were glued to Jeno's set at about 6 am and was
on my way home, but the music in the main room was *SO* great I had to
stay and dance another 1/2 hour!  The beaming smiles and eye contact that
were bouncing back and forth around the dance floor reminded me of why I
started raving in the first place.  I didn't notice any sense of group
interaction or unity in the bassment.

I know Jeno is the master and all that, but I'm sorry people missed out
on this really fresh style that you don't get to hear every day in SF.

Almost makes me think of moving to Chicago... (NOT!)

I'll second that too -- I felt like there were too many rooms until
they closed the front and upstairs; I never quite knew for sure
where I wanted to be.  When they boiled it down to two rooms it was
easier to hunker down.  Definitely a stark contrast to the unified
feel of Come/Unity, though...

This subject's getting really old, but there are some quick points
begging to be made:

1.  "house" and "other" (acid/trance/analog/techno or whatever) are very
subjective terms, and the boundaries between them are extremely fuzzy.
To me, a majority of what Jeno and at least half of what Garth plays
I would not consider "house" in the strict sense of the word.  There's
acidy and tribal sounds galore at the average SF rave.

>         rap and disco are both the sources of house music and we can get
>         plenty of that.

2.  So?  House, Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream are the sources of acid/
trance.  Does that allow one to dismiss acid/trance as being derivative,
old, stale?  Although a small percentage of what you call "house" uses
elements of rap and disco (or dancehall reggae, or salsa, etc. etc.), for
the most part house has a feel and rhythm quite unique from its antecedents.
That's one of the great things about house -- it's the universal musical
recipient!  It absorbs 47 times its own weight in other styles, and it
still comes out sounding like new!

3.  There are plenty of DJ's serving up the music you're talking about.
Support events spun by Jonah, Shobhan, Goa Gill, and Ghost, not to mention
Laura.  Maybe Mescalina should start playing out more.  Become a DJ
yourself.  It's a big city -- the more variety the better!

I have never understood people defining their taste in music strictly 
in terms of style.  For any sub-genre you can name of this modern
underground dance music we're all interested in (and there are truly
dozens), there are plenty of records that are lame and a few that are
really well made.  As long as the DJ can build sets with variety and
control the energy of the dance floor, any style of music can be fun to
dance to (for a while).

You already have the solution well in hand -- keep throwing parties like
the one you did last weekend!  I have little doubt that hard trance will
grow in popularity as the year goes on, but try not to diss us house
fans too heavily!

Your not being very to people who might want to call and respond no.  On 
sfraves we need to be open and if you are providing info for helpful 
causes you might want to make sure you approach both sides.  Please don't 
take offense to this just a suggestion.  Not everyone on sfraves hsa the

Weekend Rave Report
===================

Greetings Raver dudes all over the world...   Here is yet another report
from the eyes of a dedicated San Francisco 50 yr old raver.

Thursday... Went to SpaceLab which wasn't that well attended this week,
but our very own Ethan (nrg@netcom.com) spun and as expected,  his
awsome record collection and mixing style was second to none.

I wanted to take it a little easy on my injured knee because I want it
to heal before this Saturday,  as I was to go to my very first 100% Hardcore
rave.    I spent a lot of time,  talking to the manager of the Trocadero
about some crazy ideas I had,    then when I got back to the party,  someone
was spinning some rather interesting trancey spacey music that just didn't
pursuade me to do anymore dancing.    Things degenerated rather early
(about 3 am),   So I headed home.

This Saturday,  Spent a lot of time doing my yoga and other exercises,
preparing for "Industrial Strength",  as I wanted to be in top physical
shape to deal with the 160-190 BPM breakbeat and hardcore dancing.

Prior to the rave,  our own Laura,  one of the "Sister DJ's" who often
spins at "Your Sisters house" invites us over for Pizza prior to the
big rave.    There were 3 raves scheduled for this evening...

Saturday, January 22nd - Industrial Strength
        Ron D Core (LA), Deadly Budda (Pittsburgh), Heather Heart (Brooklyn),
        R.A.W. (LA), Demigod (SF), Nikadeemas (Portland).
        hardcore techno, hard trance, breakbeat, house, old skool acid, 
        All ages, all night.  415.979.8411

Saturday, January 22nd - Le plaisir de vivre
        Chicago's Freddy, Orlando, Bain, Lil' John
        SF's Garth, Jeno, Markie, Thomas, Leon
        Ambient & acid jazz w/Jonah, Brennen, Julius
        1015 Folsom, SF.  415.995.4602

Also, REVOLUTION...  not listed in the rave calander.

The new Virgin warehouse that was supposed to host the Industrial
Strength rave didn't pan out,  thanx to the faschist SF police
(which will result in a lawsuit),  so the info line said that
we were supposed to stop by the 16th and Harrison venue (Hays
Theator).  Boy! were we confused...  Was this supposed to be
a Map point?  or the actual location for Industrial Strength?

We were ALL confused,  and didn't know what to expect.   We did
obtain some free tickets to REVOLUTION,  which was ALSO supposed
to be at 16th and Harrison,  so we all (or at least most of us),
decided to head down there,  after picking up some free tickets
to REVOLUTION.   At least it was free.

When we get down there,   they had two lines.   One for Industrial
Strength (which costed $20 to get in),   and REVOLUTION.    Revolution
allowed ins-and outs,  but Industrial Strength didn't.    Yukk!
how TWISTED...   

I think that I should say a little thing about the Hays Theator.
This venue is known for it's faschist goons that are big tough
gorillas that some even carry guns I was told.   They always
have NO ins and outs,  and keep the doors closed shut and it gets
sickly hot and stuffy MOST of the time.    Thay also have a small
outside inclosed area in the back,  and on ocassion,  they allow
people to go outside to chill out.   The Hays Theator has two
main dancing areas,   and for most raves,  both are opened.

In the case where both REVOLUTION and Industrial Strength occupied
the space,  they had the areas split apart,  thus was two seperate
and self contained raves,  and nobody was allowed to go back and forth.

Industrial Strength (IS) was supposed to have this super 80,000 watt
Schredder sound system that was supposed to bring armegedddan to your
brains and ears,   but next door,  it was almost impossible to hear it
unless you went upstairs.  Had they decided to not have the schredder
system?

The  upstairs chill area,  was reserved for the REVOLUTION rave,  but
not the IS.   From upstairs it was possibole to hear the super scredder
sound system through the lazer projection booth,  so I stayed up there
listening for the first time the super fast hardcore sound,  longing
to get down there to try my hand at dancing to it.   My freind Sean
had agreed to help me pay to get into IS,  but I failed to find him.
I guess he went to "Le plaisir de vivre".  Yukk!! and double Yukk!!
as I was drooling and longing to get down there.

Knowing there was a pathway to the other section in the upstairs area,
I checked it out.

Naturally,  a GOON was stationed there,   and I just stood there looking
out the window,  looking confused.  The goon said "Can I help you?",  I
said,  "I'm looking for my friend up here",  and he said "Where did you
come from?"  "Did you come from down there...?",  then asked how I got
upstairs.   I said "I came in the other way".   The goon then pointed to
the downstairs area Where Industrial Strength was happening,  and
asked "Did you pay the $20 to get in down there?"   In my
quick thinking,  I said "Yes!",  and he said,  "OK,  you
can go through here, and opened the door.    I said "Let me
first recover my jacket and umbrella,  I'll be back".    So thats
how I got in.    And BOY!!  It was INTENSE Energy,  but there weren't
many people dancing.    Most folks were all huddled away towards the
front of the room,  keeping as far as possible from the gnarley
loudness of the schredder system.  The noise was tremendiously
loud,  and I normally don't wear ear plugs,   but this time,  I wished
a had some.    There was a place on the dance floor where the sound
apparently cancelled that was ALMOST tolerable.   But I liked the
fact that there was plenty of room to dance,  and boy!! I went totally
crazy out there.   My knee felt GREAT,  and due to the much faster 
beats,  I stayed on the ground,  because the earths gravity was too
low to allow me to get up in the air and down again before the next beat.
But I modified my dance style to keep up with the 190 BPM insansely fast
stuff.  I worked a whole new set of muscles at THIS rave,  and surprisingly
my knee didn't complain at all.

I stayed at IS all night long,  digging the shit out of this (for me)
new and exciting super fast dancing.   Most of the other california
weenies were just standing along the side wondering if they should try
and get out there.  This was the first time I heard "Demigod",  a local
SF DJ.    WOW!!  Sure wish I know how to reach him,  and wonder where
he DJ's around here.    he was totally INSANE....

About 5 AM,   I went next door to REVOLUTION,   after talking a goon
into allowing me to return.   I chilled out a while up stairs for
about a half hour,  did some yoga,  and gave my weak knee a rest,
then danced for a while at Revolution.    Revolution ended promply
at 6 am,  so headed back to IS.   They were still playing that insane
hardcore,  and after my rest,  I really cooked till about 7:30.

Yow!!  I practically OWNED the dancefloor,   as it was almost empty.
Still,  lots of people sere seeking refuge from the super loud scredder
system in the front room,  or next to the wall.   I skittered around
looking totally insane for a total hour and a half of practically
continious hard-core digging it totally...

As good things always come to an end,   a goon finally waddled up to the
stage and said "CUT IT NOW!!",  but the DJ protested,  but finally gave
in,  and faded down the totally awsome cut that was playing.   Good God,
those Hays St goon won't even let the cut end....  What cold bastards
they are....  Then the goon loudly said... Come on.. Clear out NOW!!
I barely had time to recover my umbrella and coat,   and out we went.

Someone handed me a flyer for GROOVE MORNING,  AND I still had my $10
so decided to head down to the ATLANTIS club on 1st and Harrison to
check it out.   It costs $5 to get in,  and I decided it was really
a nice place to hang out on a rainy morning.  They had a very great
chill area,  similar to Boogie Buffet,  and great DJ's and dancing.

I recommend that SFRavers check the place out,  as they go until 3 pm,
and of more people show interest,  they may go on longer.    Sure
beats the EndUp.    

I stayed till about 10:30 AM,  then headed over to the EndUp,  to
see who was there.    Yukk!!  dance floor really wet,   but they put up
some awnings I hadn't noticed before.    Usual stuffy crowd,  a few
ravers from the Old School,   but what the heck... It was free, 
provided you can find a dry spot on the dance floor.    Also,
they had managed to blow out another speaker next to my favorite
dacing spot   Yukk!!  Oh well....  I only  stayed for about 20 minutes
schmoozing w/ a few friends.  Then headed over to the DNA lounge for 
their usual after party.   I still had $5 left,   so didn't balk about 
the $3 cover charge.   Things  were really hopping over there,  but 
not that crowded.    The DNA has a much better sound system then Atlantis,
but nothing compared to 1015 Folsom St venue.

After DNA closed at 2 pm,  I headed back to Atlantis,  and hung out
there till about 4 pm.    Met the people sponsoring Groove Morning,
and noticed the Raves calander didn't have it listed.  Learned
it is now every Sunday... and I highly recommend it.   Good Venue
good vibes,  and it gets my seal of approval.  Check it out..

'Nuff for now...Keep the scene alive...

Susie explained this one to me:

See, the guy behind the IS party is named Sean (I think?  It was some
male S name).  ANYWAY, the "Sharon HardCore" logo is actually HIS logo,
not Sharon's -- this S-guy worked with Sharon when they started doing
their hardcore raves and Sharon put the S-guys logo on their fliers.
Over time, the S-guy's logo became (mis-)associated completely with Sharon
rather than being associated with someone who worked with Sharon from
time to time.

Yeah, keep us posted on what's up with that!  Why would the SFPD
discriminate against one venue vs. another?  (Permits, fire code,
payola from existing club owners?)  What was the excuse they gave?

I can safely say that raving in Detroit is not about drugs (born there 
and just got back from a week's visit). There just aren't any reliable 
sources there. And when you do find anything, it's either heavily cut or 
rediculously expensive (or both). Unfortunately, the Motah Town is fueled 
by alcohol, bad pot and attitude. That's why I came out here

#2. <see above> nope, most people drink alcohol.

#3. nope. It's just like the club scene that preceded it. Lotsa attitude 
and in-crowding. Yeah, the hippies had it too, but they generally weren't 
into violence.

Sorry if this topic is way dead. I just got back and I'm now catching up 
on my *267* messages. ugh. JOHN. brrr...

BASS BASS and more BASS!!!

i decided that saturday's events were much too amusing to leave untold, so
here it is...

after a bunch of people congregated at brian & laura's apt. in 
twin peaks for a pizza get together (which was a lot of fun... thanx so much
to both of you), anne & i were trying to decide whether or not to give up
on the rest of the night or still try to go out.. after hearing that the 
industrial strength ppl lost their original permits for this "virgin 
warehouse" as they put it, and the location was moved somewhere else, _and_
the ticket price was $20, and worst of all, Heather Heart who i'd heard so
much about hadn't been able to make it out here, 
we figured there was no reason for us to go, it simply wasn't worth it..

At the last minute steve (resonate) said that someone has a bunch of passes
to Revolution at 16th & Harrison that night, and so a spur of the moment 
decision landed us (cindy, susie, anne, steve & i) at the venue around 11:05, 
so we were stuck with paying
$7 after all, but we went it in anyway. 

Revolution had some *great* visuals, friendly crowd for the most part, and 
what i thought was the best part of it was the chill-out areas upstairs (which
in the strange lighting looked like rooms in a funhouse..) with plenty of 
very comfy couches & bean bags.. AND they had a coat & bag checkroom (yay,
finally!) 

As for the music.. it was funky, just a bit slow for me...

However, the evening took a much more interesting turn when we discovered,
to my very pleasant surprise, that Industrial Strength was going on 
just next door...

I'd been very much looking forward to this event, dubbed the first legitimate 
hardcore rave in SF.

Susie grabbed me from the other event, and we went upstairs to the laser room 
where the guy in charge of the laser show was sitting, bored out of his
mind and staring in wonderment at "kids our age who had so much energy" 8-)

Many thanks to Paul btw, who not only let us watch the event from
upstairs, but after i wrote out the email addresses for
SFR - sfraves@techno.stanford.edu - & the telnet address for vrave, he
wrote both things in laser and flashed it at the Industrial Strength crowd
for a while ....along with the words.. "for a good time call susie" ;-)

After that, a bunch of us played with the lasers for a while, and at one
point, i was at the helm for about 30 minutes or more, beatmatching lasers to
180 BPM *grin* I think i've found my new calling... ;-)

After that, Susie, with her beguiling charm (;-) susie.. actually, as 
coincidence would have it, she knew the promoter of I.S.) 
managed to get us into the actual event, where we, 
along with anne, stayed for much of the rest of the evening. 

A few comments about the crowd: young highschool-age types, hardly anyone 
was even dancing (tho it's not too surprising since people out here tend not
to know how to dance to hardcore really), rather rude ppl on the whole, i'm 
sad to say, and no chill-out area at
all, extremely crowded..essentially everything that was good about the party
next door was not present here...all except the music..
In short, the event was *definitely* not worth the $20...and to think had
we gotten there 5 minutes earlier it would have been free 8-)

Susie kept saying "oh these songs are so old" but it was stuff that i've never
gotten a chance to hear at any event, so it was all new 
to me.. and while Easterners may scoff at me for enjoying Deadly Buddha's
set, i thought it the best one of the night, except for DRC (IMHO, still the
one and only DJ goddess 8-)

So this bass bin worshiping girl had an incredibly wonderful time... i am
very glad i remembered ear plugs tho, since i seemed to spend most of the
time right in front of the speakers, completely drenched in sweat but 
with a huge grin on my face...
i danced so hard that i can barely move today, but it was worth it... 
we practically mopped the floor with our hair we were headbangin' so much ;-)

Long Live Hawdcoah! ;-) what can i say...i love it.. i couldn't get enough of 
the pulsing, breakneck speeds and pounding rhythm...i just wish there was a lot
more of it in this city.

my idea of the perfect rave.. the crowd and scene at Revolution with hardcore
and hard trance... well, i can dream, can't i? 8-)

And we have at least one new convert to the realm of hardcore madness.. 
Anne (Boobo) recently indoctrinated into the SFR scene ;-)

Many thanks to susie once again, without whom it have been a much less 
interesting night out, no doubt...8-)

So now i'm just waiting for the next one, with any luck, maybe it won't be
too far off - it would be wonderful to get Heather Heart
to make it out here sometime soon.

Jeno spun downstairs, and it was just as rockin' as the front room was before
they closed it. 

I really liked this party and I really liked the chill space 
that was upstairs beyond the acid jazz room. Nicely lit (with a fireplace!) and
quiet enough to reasonable hold a conversation. Now, that's what a chill room
should be. I'm tired of chill rooms with DJs, because the chill room DJs 
invariably play their "ambient" music up so loud that you can't hear anything
else. If they alway had this room open I would enjoy going to 1015 Folsom a
whole lot more.

Hey all you SF ravers,

Just thought I'd let you know, if anyone needs housing in the east bay,

($495/month).  Call me at 486-0645 or email me...


Please don't be too annoyed about the non-rave post, but I just thought
I'd try and help a fellow raver out.

See ya at the Gathering or Full Moon or something similar, soon!!


By the way, I'm from Detroit and agree about two things:
  1)  The rave scene there is much less drug-oriented (but not totally so)
  2)  The drugs that are are are really cut and really overpriced


Later,

absolutely no need to go out on saturday.... THe party was a bit slow
to start, but it just got better and better and better, peaking
around 5-6AM.

THe only unfortunate thing is that I didn't see any of the familiar faces

Sorry to burst your bubble BUT,

Here's my theory on this drug violence poll:  NBC is cashing in on 900 numbers.
Regardless of what you or others say, NBC will say x% supports, y% is against,
where x and y are made up.  Ever notice how the percentages reported on TV or
in newspapers are such neat and even percentages like 60% or 80% instead of
49.8% or 27.3%?  Ever notice how the sample size is almost never mentioned?
Ever notice how it's not even mentioned how they obtained their sample?  I've
taken 2 courses in advanced statistics and I'm always wondering how they came
up with THEIR "margin of error".

As for drug violence, I think that it is a fostered part of American society.
It's fostered by the media and by the police.  It's all one large game.  
Violence is used as a bargaining chip by the government to increase their 
surveilance of every-day Americans.  In my humble opinion, most Americans 
believe what they see on their nightly "world" News or the local news or major
newspapers like the NY Times, Washington Post, etc, and it is very sad.  I
recommend that you see "Manufacturing Consent" a documentary by Noam Chomsky
playing at the Red Vic in upper Haight on Feb 19 & 20th.  It will be crowded
so get in line early if you go.

It may be time to start venturing out to check data that you hear via the media
to see if it's really true.  You may be surprised by what you may find.  Don't
be lazy and believe the news, check it out for yourself!!

If NBC was really interested in the opinions of it's viewers, it would have
listed a non-toll number or an 800 number for YES or NO.  Don't get sucked
into this "express your views, it's important to us at your cost" game.
If 20,000 people call at 55c each, that's an easy $11,000.  But I must say
that even if these were not toll numbers, it still wouldn't make much of a 
difference on what THEY choose to or DON'T choose to report.

Sunday's NYTMagazine had an amusing bit in its "Sunday" column, titled:
 
HTIJX KTW PNIX
 
"The scrambling and decoding of electronic communication is one of the
hottest issues in cyberpolitics.  The Government would like to have
the key to all communications.  Export of cryptographic software is
restricted.  Both software companies and independent groups like the
Cypherpunks argue for the rights of individual privacy."
 
"All of which makes Microsoft's new Creative Writer software for
children intriguing.  It includes some primitive cryptographic tools
to enable kids to encode what they write ... to hide it from curious
siblings and F.B.I. agents."
 
What surprised me was the next line -- "Theoretically, this product
would come under export restrictions, even though the code would not
challenge a spy, let alone a bright 9-year-old."
 
After explaining what a Caesar substitution cipher is, the bit goes
on to note that "Presumably, Microsoft will not face any
difficulties in exporting its product even though it comes from
the K.G.B. (Kids Games Business) at Microsoft.  On the other hand,
it does instruct the youth of America in the basics of electronic
privacy."
 
In case you're wondering, the encrypted phrase is "Codes for Kids."

Maybe we should enter a SFRave Technobot into the competition,
It may not win but it might be great fun and an excuse to show up

University in San Jose, California. 

Robot Sumo is a contest in which two robots attempts to push one another from 
a small (approximately 5 feet in diameter) circular pad. The robots may compete 
in one of two classes, radio-controlled or autonomous. They are restricted in 
size (must fit in a 20 cm x 20 cm footprint) and weight (3 kilograms).

The defining rules of the contest are set by Fuji Software in Japan. A copy of 
these rules is available from the San Francisco Robotics Society Bulletin Board 
( 415-648-6427) or they will be included in return confirmations to registrants

About UNIVERSE..  I went to a samll Universe party in Santa Cruz over the 
summer.  It was definitely one of the best parties I attended all 
summer.  The place was small but comfortable and the crowd was great.  I 
met Captain Crunch and the people who were helping with the Orb visuals I 
think.  They were playing around with some visuals at this party and I 
saw some of the same clips at the Orb (at the Warfield).  There was no 
live DJ but they were playing DJ tapes of the Universe event earlier in 
the summer in the UK.  I got one of the master copies of the Universes 
album from the guy who was running the tape deck!  I was stoked!  The 
night before they had a party also and they had live DJs I heard that one 
was fun also.

I think their poll is biased towards only those rich FAT CATS that can
afford to call those expensive 900 numbers,  so I would NEVER trust those
900 number polls.  I emailed them a note expressing my concerns about the
accuracy of such polls.

On another note:   I recieved a flyer for Kulture Shock this Saturday
which isn't on the raves calander.   It features Jeno, Garth, Markie Mark,
Simon and Thomas.   The Info number is (415) 995-9620.    And I'm
just wondering what the best rave will be next weekend,   as I'll be
having a Japanese writer to entertain,  and was thinking of bringing 
him to a rave.

Also,  the TV program "On the money" didn't have my interview on it
last Saturday,  but I was told that this coming Saturday they plan on
airing it.    Channel 2 (FOX Network) at 10:30 locally.  For those out
of the area,  check your TV listings for times and channels.  Yours
truly will be talking about Hacking,  and encryption.   I think
you'll find it interesting.

I don't think so...  There is some house music that has been
influenced by disco (disco house), but house music has been around
for much longer than you or I, and certainly much longer than the
disco movement.  House music came from jazz.  Listen to all of the
basic underlying chord progressions, piano tracks, bass tracks, drum
tracks, etc.  It's very easy for me to see the origins of the house
music that I like, but I guess it depends on what type of house music
you like.  House music has probably been around for a lot longer than
jazz really, if you consider the meaning of the word house.  House
music has always just been music made by everyday people, in their
own house, or for friends visiting their house, or for somebody
else's house.  It has never really meant to be like a sell-out
100,000 attendance live house concert in a football stadium.  Just a
few thoughts.  Don't take any of this personally.

Why don't you just express your opinion without telling us that if you call 
you are stupid and if you don't your are smart.

I may agree that calling means also to give free money to them, but you 
shouldn't imply that whoever called is not smart enough or actually that
you are smarter.

Obviously I called, but I don't think the issue here is to prove who is smarter
and who is not.
There are so many things that we do and indirectly go to support big 
corporations even if we don't realise that.
For instance buying lots of music (no matter how "alternative" is) does that.

Of course I think there is a big difference in buying "alternative" music
versus commercial one, in the same way there is a big difference calling that 
number and saying yes or no.

Just my point of view.

Every day on our way home from work, Gillian and I have looked at the
scaffolding on the mural at the Women's Building, eagerly awaiting its
dismantlement. Today as we walked by, workers were taking down the
last metal bars and wooden planks in the moist evening air. The work
of art they so casually unveiled rivals anything I've ever seen for
its spiritual intensity, political savvy, brilliant color, and awesome
size. It depicts on one enormous wall the all-encompassing energy of
the human existance from the woman's perspective. Make a point of
walking by that spot sometime in the next few days, while the paint is
still fresh. It's on 18th Street between Valencia and Guerrero.

Yes, Cellblock X, Disintegrator, Biochip C, Electric Indigo, Assylum,

Critical Mass are all hardcore.

I didn't go to the Industrial Strength Party, though, so I don't know what

Little question: are there Canadian projects in there or just US? Interactive
tv has been a reality here for some years (over 100000 users) and in
january of next year they will start adding services like email (internet
format), banking and purchases (like the services we had with Alex, but
i think there were only 25000 users of Alex...). They think that by the
end of the millenium, every tv owner will be connected (that is, for the
province of Quebec). If it goes as well everywhere, expect to see the
raving community invaded by lots of non ravers...

Computer Gaming World had such a graphic, but it lacked all major projects.
I sent them email regarding that, and basically they said to fuck off.
(in the previous email i must say i had pointed out enormous conceptual,
technical and methodological errors in one article, along with a good
bunch of readers and they also said about the same thing, so i think they
dont want to read comments).

How about Sega, Accolade, Microsoft and Compton :) :)

money's worth?...we did more than that!  I hit up laura and brians new
place with the excellent view before heading out to revolution.  It was
next door to IS and was free before 11 (but of course we got there 5 min
late).  *oh and for you triva buffs 16th & harrison use to be the Eurkea
Theatre where they did realy cool plays including the premeire of what is
now on broadway as "angels in America"*  So we got into revolution for
seven bucks.  They were playing some serious house! I went to go take a
look around and found this guy in charge of the green laser for IS in
the chillout upstairs for revolution.  So i brought jo (that hardcore
woman) and my friend anne up to watch *and the laser guy let us play
with the laser* wheeee! Then we realized that the 2 parties were conneted
by this stairway so i went to go and take a look.  I convince the security
that we really belonged at the IS party and they let us through.  So we
hung around that party for a while and the tunes were pretty good and the
crowd was so so. Also the visuals other than the laser at IS sucked
compared to the video screens and lights they had next door at the
revolution party.  So after a while of sneaking back and forth i met up
with sean ralston who i had met when i spoke down at the board of
supervisors.  He told me that a california state court overturned the
curfew law but now the police are enforcing another section which says
that they can by there discression decide whether or not to grant 1
night party permitts.   So he and Larry Murry are sueing a
whole bunch of people including mayor jordan and the
police (cool!!)  Sean then introduced me to deadly buda from pittsburgh,
who knew all the net ravers from there (ie diesel boy, mike b, joe lesene) 
!!! the first half of his set was great.  We then waited for drc to come
on at 6 am and heard part of her killer set (which resonated the
entire room) and went home to get some sl**p.  ahhhh

Wow, that's amazing.  It's really too bad that that space is being used so
poorly now.  I mean, it's fine to dance in and all, but that is a fantastic
theatre space---the bad security and the other countless complaints about 16th
and Harrison really spoil the place's history...I wish the Eureka would come
out of the ashes again and use it as a stage....sigh...

wistful at work...anyone know who is at Motion tonight?  Oh...for those of you
who listen to DJ tapes--the new Dutch set is absolutely fantastic.  It's a
great two tape set and very very very good...I hope that some promoters listen
to his set and book him straight away...

It's a long distance phone call.  They cost money.  At 55 cents NBC isn't
making a profit on this.  The money goes to the phone company.

Hey now,

     I don't know about any of you but I can fell the moon coming this month in
a big way!    

     Tonight at Motion they are featuring local Djs:

Mailon    sp?   (May-lawn)
Julius
Rick Preston  

     I have not heard Mailon play but I have heard good things.  Julius plays
alot of Acid Jazz and not often does he get to play for people to boogie but he
is a very good Dj.  And of course there is Rick, he will be bringing it on
home.  
     I also wanted to say that Deep Space has started up again.  It is located
on the back corner of the Oasis on the 1st Street side.  They have already had
the likes of Ernie, Mark Farina, Spun, Rick Preston, Harry Who, Josh...   anyway
it is on Thursday nights in a new cool space.  
     For people in the South Bay these two parties are close and both quality
events so come on out and dance!

Peace                  T. Scot

Two interesting articles in todays chron on the subject of drugs, one
legal and the other not... 

First, evidently surgeons are testing a narcotic-laced lollypop to
give to children before surgery, basically to dose them before they
get scared.  So someday at a rave if someone hands you a lollypop ya
might get lucky.  :-)

Second, an article on eastern european kids shooting up a home-cooked
compound made from ephedrine (via reaction w/ iodine and phosphorous.
Sounds nasty, organophosphates can be Really Bad (tm)).   Typical
"drugz ruined these kids lives" slant, which will no doubt give
ephedra even a worse name. 

Anyway, check them out.

Subject: my sf anniversary. thanks.
Status: 


Well, two years ago today at just about this time, I made San Francisco 
my home. I remember upon getting off the plane thinking I had 
accidentally landed in Bedrock. The flora around SFO looked very 
neanderthalish. One thing was certain. It was *warm*! This little fact I 
take for granted now (esp. after just getting back from a week home in 
Detroit) was a *big* deal to me then. Most of us wouldn't think of 
wearing shorts yet, but I had 'em on in minutes after landing. Needless 
to say, the bus ride coming up 101 through the hills for my first 
real-life look at my new city was amazing.

Not knowing a soul, a luckly roll o' the dice landed me in the SOMA 
warehouse I still live in now. The folks who became my family have now 
all moved on elsewhere, but new friendly faces have appeared here and 
there to fill the gaps. 

My first real SF rave experience came a month after moving here. I hung 
out at the Top for a while and overheard people talking about the Full 
Moon later that night. After asking around a bit, a few great guys 
offered me a ride there (later turning out to be Martin and Jeno). Other 
than Berkeley, I hadn't been out of the City so I was worried about just 
how I was going to get back home, but it was a little too late to think 
about it as we passed over the bridge into Vallejo. I was going to go 
even if I had to walk back home. Later standing on a lonely hilltop 
looking down on several hundred people dancing to the best music I've 
ever heard (in or out of Detroit), the lights of Vallejo, and the sun 
just starting to come up, I knew I had found the place where I most 
wanted to be.

I don't know many of you, but you all sound just as friendly as the great 
people I've met so far. I don't know of any other city where someone 
knowing noone with nowhere to live and no job can just arrive with a 
suitcase and begin to make a future for themselves. Thank you all. And I 
want to extend a warm welcome to those brave and hopeful people that, 
probably as I type, are getting off their plane right now, with only 
their suitcase and a smile. Good Luck.

I hope to see some of you at SpaceLab this Thurs. I'm gonna be celebrating.

JMAR. best damn two years of my life so far. sounds like there's gonna be 
a third!

Hi Henry!!!

Thank you for your insight and encouragement. And yes, your "rambling"
makes a lot of sense.  I agree with you that I need to do whatever I need
to do to send out the message of the vibe and cultivate this "scene" into a
viable community.
For the most part, I think that the other promoters have been supportive of
what we've been doing with the Choc-Lit Factory.  However, regardless of
how important the message is, I need to find a way to communicate that
message in a way that comes across effectively and in a way that would
benefit everyone around.  In other words, instead of saying "Fuck you Mr.
Promoter, I'm gonna have this party no matter what!!", I feel that a more
effective way would be to say, "I understand your concern but, what we're
doing is not a matter of competing with your event, it is a cultural
endeavor.  What can we do to work this out?".  The Choc-Lit Factory was
started with the same principles as the FreeVibes in the sense that the
party will be paying for itself to keep it alive and going as long as
possible while minimizing the impact that the financial factors will have
on the party and it's partycipants. The Choc-Lit Family does need to be
sensitive to the needs of other members of this community.  If we find that
what we're doing is going to be detrimental to our community we need to
take a step back and look at what we're doing and why.  For me it's a
matter of constantly taking my bearings and doing reality checks as we
travel along a an ever changing landscape.   Again, thank you for your
insight and support.  Please keep the feedback coming!!!

Kindness, Joy, Love & Happiness to you

Tigger(Glenn)

Regarding your message about when to throw parties:

You have a responsibility to throw your party when you want to, 
regardless of pressure from other promoters.  You have to provide 
direction in this community as a promoter and organizer.  What is a good
rave
for you?  What does positive spirit mean to you?  If you think you 
may know and have the means to provide people with a taste of it, do it.  
Why do you have to compromise your good intentions and positive 
commitment to appease another organizer?  They may not know what you know 
or have the same good intentions.  Maybe they do.  The point is that if 
you feel that you are doing the community a service, advancing the cause 
of this house/underground/party/together/rave thing, you need to bring it 
to everyone so they can join in and support your commitment.
Does this rambling make sense to you?  I hope so.

It's all about empowerment.

Then why not just have a plain old phone line,  and then callers only
have to pay 20 cents a minute to vote.

this seems to be a good time to bring up the obvious.  i'm presuming
that Scott is flying, so this isn't really directed his way.

from conversations with people down there, the freeway situation is
still quite messed up, and Caltrans is strongly recommending that
people not attempt to drive to LA from outside of the area.

on the other hand, many areas north of LA proper and areas east of LA
proper are quite accessible from the north, so you should check before
making / changing plans.

just stating the obvious...

This isn't a very good answer, but ...

Perhaps it costs more to call NBC (which is either in NY or LA) from
different parts of the country.  If it's gonna cost *some* people $2.00 to
call, they won't call.  With the 900 number, it costs a flat 55 cents no
matter where you're calling from.  So at least their statistics won't be
skewed by geographical location.  (though they will be skewed by one's
ability/inability to afford a 55-cent call.)

Also, look at it this way. If it was a 'regular' phone number, the call
would probably call you 55 cents anyway... but you would pay it to the
phone company instead of NBC. 900 numbers that charge very small amounts
like 55 cents are really just a way of redirecting your money from AT&T
to whoever is running the poll/service/etc.

Of course, it would be better if the poll was an 800 number, but you should
realize 800 calls aren't really free, they are just paid for by the callee.
Then NBC would be paying out lots of THEIR money just to run a poll, which
isn't incredibly fair, and not very businesslike.

		Ecstasy a soft drug says Spanish Court
			by Jane Walker in Madrid

Spanish anti-drug officials are alarmed at a weekend ruling by a high-court judge
in Madrid which defines ecstasy as a soft and non-addictive drug which does not
damage health.
  The ruling came at the trial of three men accused of trafficing the popular 
"designer drug", and means that they now face only five-year sentences and fines 
of 50 million pesetas (about #250,000).  Prosecutors had sought the 11-year 
sentences and higher fines prescribed for dealing in hard drugs.  Spain's penal 
code differentiates between soft drugs - such as marijuana or hashish - and hard 
drugs, which include heroin and cocaine, amphetamines and, until now, ecstasy.
  The four defence lawyers assembled a team of expert witnesses, several from the
United States, who stated that ecstasy, a cocktail of chemicals known as MDMA, was
different from a similar drug, MDA, commonly known as "the love pill" which has 
dangerous side effects.
  They said MDMA was not hallucinogenic but "accentuates visual, tactile and aural
senses and produces a sense of well-being and greater empathy.  "It is not known
to cause physical or mental dependancy, and it's effects only last for two to 
three hours."  Their controversial evidence contradicts other medical experts who
believe that long-term use of ecstasy has psychological side-effects and causes 
dependence.
  Ecstasy first appeared in Spain in the 1970's, particularly on the island of
Ibiza, where it became popular in tourust discotheques.  The drug became more
freely available and is widely taken by young people embarking on the "bakalao
route", a binge beginning in Madrid and other big cities on a Friday night and
continuing through the weekend to throbbing bakalao music.  It often takes the
form of a pub crawl which involves driving at breakneck speed along main roads 
and ending in bars on the Mediterranean coast.  Many of the weekend road accidents
in Spain involve young people.  Drugs, both hard and soft, are openly sold in 
and around bakalao bars but most of the young people who take part in the raves
say they prefer ecstasy.
  It now appears that what they have been taking could have been MDA.  "It is 
important to become aware that what is sold as ecstasy on the bakalao routes
is often not that drug and could be more dangerous," said Jaime Sanz de
Bremond, the main defence lawyer.  The prosecutor in the case intends to appeal
to Spain's supreme court.  He is certain to be supported by the interior
ministry's anti-drug campaign.

Status: 


Ummm... maybe someone mentioned this before (i'm 143 msgs behind on
sfraves), but with a 1-900 or 1-800 number, the people on the other end
can easily get your phone #, and from that determine the caller, and
from that they can probably correlate your vote to the number you are
calling from, and perhaps to the caller him/her-self. This is
especially true for a 1-900 number where they have to know who to bill.
SO I WOULDN'T CALL THIS NUMBER UNLESS I WAS AT A PAY PHONE, unless one
is willing to express views that correlate to legal practices.

I don't know much about phone systems, but I've seen and heard about
such "caller id" systems with mine own eyes and ears. Back when I was
employed at HP Labs, the HP Response Center was using some of my UI
software (WINTERP) for interfacing to such "caller id" 1-800 machines,
amongs other things, so I got to see what they were doing first-hand.

When a customer called for software support, the "support engineer"
could do an early determination of who they were because the caller id
phone system would output the number from whence the call originated.
This would speed the process of ensuring that the "complainer" had
software support; for example, if the originating number had been used
previously, a form would pop up containing the people most likely to be
at that number, any "software support identification" numbers, previous
complaints or request for support, etc.

It's pretty easy to extrapolate from such a system, which are in wide
use among large US businesses, to a system which logs the phone numbers
of people which have views that aren't in synch with the law.

Just call me paranoid, ok?

Actually, this is a documentary *about* Noam Chomsky, filmed by Mark Achbar
and Peter Wintonick, co-produced by National Film Board of Canada.  I can't
recommend this highly enough -- I saw it twice during its run at the Castro
last year.  Considering the seriousness of the subject matter, the production
is actually quite snappy and entertaining.

See it -- you'll never view the media in quite the same way afterwards.
You'll understand exactly how futile it is to try to do things like "use"
the media to our advantage.

I can certainly say,  that I DO get the number of the person who calls
my 800 number.   Also, I hace the "*69" feature that permits immediate
call back,  and normally this won't work if someone calls from a payphone,
but if they call my 800 number,  the "*69" WILL work from ANY payphone,
including privatly operated ones (COCOTS),  Although when I call back
SOME COCOTS,  I often get a modem tone.    Just thought you should know...

also my other score at streetlight was O FORTUNA, not the apotheosis

I think the data (which I am sure is being collected) is more likely for
marketing. They get an opinion to map you to a demographic and a phone
number. They combine this with the content of other big databases and
decide that since you are 'pro drug', used your ATM card to buy distilled
water and miso at Safeway for 3 weeks in a row, and are paying a monthly
payment on a motorcycle that mailing you ads selling vacation packages
isn't likely to result in a buy, but that a plea for money to save the
rainforests stands a chance. Then they sell this data to other big
companies.

Not to mention they get a big news story 'from the people' and you pay for
the research.

I was changing channels the other day on cable, and there was a corny

Locklear. I don't remember the name of it. Well The climatic ending was 
at a rave.. You couldn't miss it.. Chessy techno. the DJ was pretending 
to spin records.. the offers of Nitrous and X. The posters behind the 
DJ that says RAVE. And this time there were no people who wore cat in the 
hats and pacifiers. Well at least it is a step up, though they didnt have 
to make it that obvious that it was a rave.

Howdy!

Deep Space is being held at the Oasis tonight (in SJ). I think it's free 
before 11pm and $5 after. The DJs are Garth and Spun. 

I'll be at home painting the walls and recovering from last 
night's booty shake, but I highly recommend that you other wallflowers 
check it out. 

Motion mini report-
Efx was Efx- generic club venue. 
Mei Lwun did the best DJing of the evening in my NSHO. I've heard much
better things from Rick Preston in the past, what can I say, I was
underwhelmed. The crowd was a bit sparse (SJSU started yesterday),
but I had fun anyway. Great seeing johnnyturpin and meeting Bryce!
sorry I missed mike_romo et al.

I think this is all very true, but there's another angle to these 1-900
polls.  I believe the media is using them to *calibrate* how well they are
manipulating public opinion, and using the results to tweak the techniques by
which they present the news in order to more effectively control people's
opinions.  On the drug legalization issue, maybe the results showed them
they have to change tactics.

In case you think I'm a hopelessly paranoid conspiracy maniac, here's a
story that was buried comfortably inside this Tuesday's Chronicle (and before
you scoff, it was reprinted verbatim from the Washington Post):

--------------------

MEDIA HAVE STOKED ANXIETY ON CRIME
By Richard Morin, Washington Post

Washington, Monday January 24,

In the past few months, crime has soared to the top of the country's short
list of major problems, replacing the economy in most surveys as the single
most important problem facing the country.

Yet some serious students of public opinion view this increase with a
disquieting sense of deja vu.  They wonder whether current concerns about
crime are being driven by the media rather than by crime statistics.

Such doubters recall a similar spike in public concern about drugs during
the 1980's.  Scholars now convincingly argue that the concern about drugs
was largely prompted by the media's sudden interest in the subject, rather
than by an increase in the prevalence or use of illicit narcotics.  They
note that when the media lost interest in the drug story, it fell like a rock
from the top of the polls.

Similarly, we may just be embarking on a similar roller-coaster ride over
crime.

First, a bit of statistical history.  In January 1989, 19 percent of those
interviewed in Washington Post-ABC News polls named drugs as the "most
important problem" facing the country.  In October, more than half of those
interviewed -- 53 percent -- said drugs were the country's biggest problem.
The pattern was as apparent in other major polls.

But just as quickly, the bottom fell out.  By September 1990, only 16 percent
named drugs as the nation's most important problem.  This year, drugs elicit
no more than a single-digit response in the polls.

As it turned out, both the boom and the bust of public concern about drugs
were out of step with reality.  Data from a number of large-sample surveys
taken during those years suggested that drug use during this period was,
if anything, flat or perhaps falling slightly -- anything but up.

What had increased and then dropped out of sight in this period was the
media's attention to drugs as a social issue.

"The New York Times discovered drugs, and thereafter many news organizations
discovered it," said Maxwell E. McCombs, a professor of communication at
the University of Texas.  "The reality was that nothing had changed regarding
the incidence or use of drugs."

Current concern about crime may be following a similar pattern.

The percentage naming crime as the nation's most important problem rocketed
from 5 percent in June to 21 percent in the November Post-ABC News poll.  A
similar trend has been captured in other surveys.

Meanwhile, nationally and in most states, the overall crime rate has been
essentially flat or rising at an incremental rate.

Part of the focus on crime could be attributed to the apparent health of
the nation's economy.  "It could well be," McCombs said, "as the economy
moves off the agenda, then in effect it opens the door to another issue to
move on the stage, and crime may be it."

--------------------

I'd add to that last paragraph, that by keeping the masses of TV-fixated
Americans obsessed with issues like crime and pro sports, they don't have
time or energy left over to pay attention to really important issues such
as truly effective health care reform, the real causes of the homelessness
problem, etc.  And why don't they want people to pay attention to these things?

Remember that the networks are dependent on the advertising income of
insurance companies, real estate conglomerates, medical equipment and
drug manufacturers who DON'T WANT people to demand a change to status quo
in areas where it would affect their bottom line.  And don't forget that
NBC is actually owned by one of the largest military contractors and
manufacturer of megabux medical equipment, GE.

They'd much rather have the public screaming at politicians for a "three-
strikes-you're-out law" (which, by the way, most prosecutors, prison
officials and academic criminologists say will actually make the problem
worse, and is much less cost effective than putting money into drug treatment
and rehabilitation programs), than have them screaming for real medical or
real-estate reform.

And it's *so* easy for them to create this climate by bombarding us with
wall-to-wall coverage of the Polly Klaas case, Nancy Kerrigan, etc.  Can
you believe how blown out of proportion this story about Kerrigan and Harding
has been played, in comparison to its actual importance?   It turns out that
the  very same day Kerrigan got bopped on the knee resulting in a minor bruise,
a pro basketball player named Larry Stewart got his home broken into, was shot
in the neck (one inch from his spinal cord) and stabbed in the thigh.  That
story ran as a few paragraphs deep in the sports section, while Kerrigan
was plastered all over the front pages for weeks.  You don't suppose it
might be because Stewart is a black male and Kerrigan a white female by any
chance???   Nahhh....

Regardless of whether you agree with this reasoning, you'll find Manufacturing
Consent to be quite eye-opening...

And now... back to our regularly-scheduled hardcore vs. deep house flame war...

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
movie on USA with Cloris Leachman, Timothy Busfield, and Heather 
Locklear. I don't remember the name of it. Well The climatic ending
was  at a rave.. You couldn't miss it.. Chessy techno. the DJ was
pretending  to spin records.. the offers of Nitrous and X. The
posters behind the  DJ that says RAVE. And this time there were no
people who wore cat in the  hats and pacifiers. Well at least it is a
step up, though they didnt have  to make it that obvious that it was
a rave.

If you've ever heard of the movie Plan 9 from Outer Space, there is a
sequel coming out soon called Plan 10 from Outer Space, that isn't
made by the original producers of Plan 9.  The final scene was filmed
at Playscool, a local (to Salt Lake City, anyways) performance arts
center/dance club that plays house music.  The last scene is a rave
with aliens and mormons (members of the LDS church).  If you're not
familiar with what mormons are, just picture stuffy religious types
in suits and dresses, and aliens from outer space having a rave
together.  It should be really wild when it comes out.  The original
plan 9 wasn't that hot, but the guys that produced this one know how
to do it right.

Are the FMR outdoor presently? lucky people... yesterday we were two degrees
short of the north pole with -28 Celcius :) (-42 windchill).

Speaking of FM, for those who want to keep an eye on the phase of the moon,
(plus time around the world and other neato things) check out EOSunrise.
That is, if you have a PC and windows... (it's on cica under eosun.zip).

None of the handful of FMR's I've been to have been truly outstanding.
But it doesn't matter, it's always an adventure.  If only I knew it
would end up being tonight I would have flown down for the weekend a
day early.  As it is I'll prolly see y'all from the plane as we pass
over the Marina :).  

Like all events these are not for everyone, Wicked have their own
style and interests musically, but let's give credit where due for
their persistent efforts which have, after all, really changed the
scope of the r*** scene in SF overall, in my opinion, for the better.

But I don't hold it against anyone if they don't like/attend FMRs, no indeedy.
There's nothing wrong with having likes and dislikes as long as we let each
other hold our own counsel and make this whole thing grow through the
diversity of our preferences and opinions.

As an archeologist, I learned long ago that typologies are a trap.
Drugs vs. non-drugs.  House vs. hardcore.  Vinyl vs. CDs.  Analogue vs.
digital.  Indoors vs. outdoors.  Floppy hats vs. baseball caps (OK,
I'm a partisan on that one :)

I had a great time that night/morning, too, and I remember that track and

Via the neuroanatomy of analog resonate:

I happen to be listening to a *really* excellent bit of that right now.

It's the "Pure, Impure" EP by Seefeel.  Tracks 4 and 5 are coproduced
by Aphex Twin.  Highly recommended for those who haven't given up on the
processed-guitar-loop-trance approach of My Bloody Valentine, etc.

The reason I don't go to FMR's is because they never start 'til 3 or 4,
so unless you go to bed *real* early the night before and head down to
where it's happening an hour or two before sunrise (and if you're *extra*
lucky, they haven't been busted into submission that particular night)
it's just not worth hanging around cold parking lots for hours on end.

But that's my own humble non-declarative opinion, and for those of your
who are into the thrill of the chase for old time's sake, and other
die-hards, I do wish you a most transcendent of night/mornings.

Yes.  I agree that the monthly sacrifice of Christain virgins to
the pagan moon goddess is becoming problematic, and is giving the scene
a bad rep.  Frankly, they'd be better off sacrificing agnostic
UNIX geeks - the're easier to find around here, and then the FMRs
won't have to start so late.

(we already covered the fact that this is obviously just an opinion
hidden as a fact so we dont need to bring that up again 
*assuming ahawks tone of voice*
That was a joke my boy ahhh say a joke)

This is really funny cuz when i went to the FMR that was held
at the Marina after the Point Reyes location got busted
i thought it was way too dark and trancey

personally i love nice airy music when im outside,
maybe the daylight had something to do with it too
but to me, a lot of trancey stuff is too...
i dont know.. it just doesnt seem natural to me...
its wonderful music, but i think it relates more to machinery than
to mother nature

i cant say anything about wicked, the only thing i know is that
Garth isnt to kind on earthquakes
and thats just a rumour

BUT anyhow.. i can only assume what 'habits' means...
no matter what though i say you start throwing your own parties if you
dont want to support peoples personal choices over things
cuz im sure someone who is getting some part of your money
is doing something you dont like

Or, most likely, someone who works for at&t.  All the people
who work for AT&T who have email have att.com in their addresses.  
There are tens of thousands of AT&T employees, and none of them have to 
pay for their internet access because it's part of their job.  I know, 
I used to be one of them.

orbital are a terrible example of live techno, if you ask me.  yes,
they DO supposedly actually manipulate the sounds but their setup
doesn't seem to have a whole lot of interactivity.

now Dubtribe on the other hand are probably my peak example of live
techno.  they don't have any "songs" per se, just "groove elements"
that they can mix and match and arrange live to respond to the crowd's
energy.  and oddly enough, i don't think they sound all that great on
record because the crowd dynamics are missing!

jeff and i tried doing this but it's a lot of effort and i really hate
the thought of lugging our gear all over the place - a lot of it is
very fragile.

Plan 9 wasnt that hot??????????
you're kidding...
Plan 9 has been deemed by many to be THE worst movie EVER made
(and i assume, that was released & distributed as such)

i believe Johnny Depp i starring in a movie this week on TV
about Ed Wood (?) the guy behind Plan 9...
should be interesting

There is a 12" of this track out now.  I believe it's on Dub Tribe's own
label (called Organico?).

BTW: DON'T look for this track at BPM because apparently there's some rift
between BPM and Dub Tribe.  Try looking at Tweekin' or Star instead.

Organico was put together by David Prince from Chicago, who is the editor

Tribe and Derrick May.

Status: 

OK, so I'm a mere human which entails a certain inevitable degree of
self-contradiction...  life would be so BORING if everyone were 100%
consistent, don't you think?  =)

The FMR this morning was inCREDible!!!  I was just about to blow it
off as usual, but I was struck by a burning hunch at about 5:45 am
that this one would be really special and I *had* to be there...
so off I went...

The place was a dump... literally... a spiralling jetty of probably toxic
landfill jutting off the shores of Albany, just behind the race track.
But this site is the ULTIMATE FMR site -- loads of parking, but a twenty
minute hike over the landfill before you could even hear a HINT of the
sound system.   Almost unimaginably remote -- the dance area was a
sort of (un)natural amphitheatre molded out of twisted hunks of metal
and gnarled entrails of some earlier reinforced concrete structures:
perhaps the remains of the Cypress Freeway after the '89 quake?  Not
even the remotest chance of any authority figures turning up -- the
effort it would have required just wouldn't have made any sense.

Gotta give the FMM crew credit -- they did a LOT of prep work getting the
site together, marking the safest trail down to the dance area (there
were definitely some majorly hazardous obstacles to encounter along
the way.)  People were treating the site as an ongoing art project, painting
the twisted fragments of metal with day-glo acrylic colors.  One had
the feeling of dancing INSIDE a huge installation of post-modern sculpture.

I touched down there at my usual preferred strategic time, about 45
minutes before sunrise, dawn just starting to break as the moon was setting
so picturesquely DIRECTLY over Mt. Tam.  Yes, just like the Berkeley Marina
you could get a fish-eye view of the whole Bay Area, all those bridges and
islands, the downtown skyline looking like a toy model, and seeing Highway 80
coming to life but oh so far away...  But this time no early morning joggers
and dog-walkers giving us odd looks...  Just the right number of people
(maybe 200 or so).

And then, the music -- Garth and Jeno were pulling out tracks from
somewhere between Leftfield and Neptune...  deep acid, trance, house,
and every flavor inbetween.  And it all seemed to fit together underneith
the clear, crisp morning skies...  Actually, Garth was playing a Bjork
remix at the moment I arrived, which caused the corners of my lips to
connect with my ears in a grin the likes of which my face hadn't experienced
in untold months...

Greetings and hugs to all net.friends who were there:  the Wings, Marlo,
Geoff, Ravi, TAXI (oops, I've blown his cover!), and who out there remembers
Shaun Ralston from his brief stint on this list?  And of course Gregg, who
popped over after sunrise to see how his original brainchild worked out
(and seemed rather pleased).  Paul K -- I hope you made it safely!

Anyway, just when one least expected a major comeback from the FMM, they
gave this observer a morning to remember like none other since the Bonnie
Doon classix...  Maybe the fact that this one was one day late, technically
speaking, was probably a major factor in its success in an odd sort of way.

And to the Wicked Posse -- a three-month period of immunity from my usual
jaded cynicism!  =)

went to spacelab, got there early (10:45ish).  crowd is very different
every week.  this was a pretty cool crowd, but small.  as people left,
more vibe-ridden people took their place.  max was around ten people
on the dance floor, but everyone was going well.  Shobhan didn't
really get it on, but Alex did.

many people were asking for the FMR info from me.

i left spacelab at 2 with every intention of going home, but decided
to spend the extra $1 on bridge tolls and drive over to the site.
parked my car and within 2 minutes Trish came up and asked me for a
donation :-)  i consider this to be the ultimate sign that the party
will actually happen, it means that a reasonable subgroup of the
wicked posse are already on the site.

hiked in about a mile, got lost in the landfill, started wandering
around, found the party.  took until 3:30 before the music came on.
nice party, site was cool overall, and definitely non-bustable, would
have required a LOT of police effort to bust it.

intermittant generator problems kept the music going on and off
through 5 am, when i left.  seemed like the party would go off nicely
if they managed to get the generator going consistently.

glad to see that they still happened, and i'm not sure, but imho, it
was a good site and will be filed away in my data banks for future
parties... lots of parking and pretty hard to bust, far away from
residences.

Status: 

MykL,

Thanks for calling me last night.  Yes, I did make it to the FMR.  I understand 
this was a brand new location and it did resemble a post-apocalyptic 
landscape.  It was a little unsettling at first.  Me and my friend stood 
around for what seemed like an age before the music started.  Full marks to Alan 
and the others in Wicked for going to a hell of a lot of trouble to put this on.

It wasn't a wholly successful night. There were a few teething problems, 
as you'd expect with any new space.  It was unfortunate that the generator 
wasn't operating very well.  This meant that from about 4:00am until 4:30am, 
every few minutes it would sputter, cut-out and the music would die, then 
it would respark, the power would flow again and the music would come back.  
Too bad, but nothing Wicked could do about that.  Then there was a longer 
break later on in the night while someone went off and got gasoline for the 
faulty generator ??? I found myself sitting on the raised landscape above 
the dance area and looking at the lights on four sides.  Great view of SF, 
the Golden Gate, Oakland, everywhere in the north bay. Crowd were friendly 
too.  I didn't think walkways were marked at all, I didn't see any marking 
myself. I was afraid, actually, that someone would do some real damage to 
themselves by falling as they tried to descend into the dance area.

It was funny, at one time the generator was coughing and failing to fire and
it would spew out these noxious fumes, for a minute I thought Wicked had
supplied dry ice machines !  I was soon enveloped in what turned out to be 
harsh, acrid carbon-monoxide fumes.

My friend was visiting from LA and she commented that it was just like home 
to her...  lots of pollution, tent cities, evidence of earthquake damage 
everywhere and collapsed freeway sections thrown in as well.
On the nitrous issue, yes it was there again last night, lots of it. 
I have never done it myself but my friend tells me that it isn't a pleasant
experience.  She is very familiar with the LA scene (she's a writer, one 
of her articles is stored on techno.stanford) and said that the
thing that was a bodyblow to the scene there was the death of three guys
who were in a van with a large tank of nitrous that had a leaky valve.  
They asphyxiated from the fumes and it bought a lot of heat from the law.

It would've been a very special night last night if the generator didn't 
persistently deflate the mood by failing.  The music at the start was a 
bit hit and miss as well, it was only after a long time that it settled 
down into consistently good trance.

The fairy lights that were strung of the industro-sculpture were cool, 
winking on and off while the music played.  Also, I was glad of the opportunity
to give Wicked a few bucks to help offset the expenses for this.  I pity the
folks who have to drag all the gear back that long path to the parking lot.

I drove back home to San Mateo at 7:30 and surfaced too late, missed
an important meeting.  But I'd do the same again.  And my friend said she
wished LA had events like this.  It no longer does, so make the most of
them while you have 'em.

Thats what I think anyway... thanks again to Wicked.

Pk.

Status: 

Hi, folks!  Hope you all are doing well.

I was casting about for dates and times, jonesing for a party in February
of the kind that only SFRaves can do.  So, I looked at the calendar, and
considered that February 19th seems to be an ideal date for a party...the
Saturday of a long weekend.  However, close consultation with the calendar
reveals a benefit for Malachy that night.  Hmmm.  I had an idea that I 
wanted to share, and request your comments on.

Would folks be interested in a "pre-party" that day, say from 4PM to 10PM?
Filled with that special SFR magic where we all pitch in what we can?
I really want to support the Malachy benefit, and I'm sure that many of
you do, too.  I also (personally) want to get together with you all in
a more intimate setting to catch up on happenings, gossip, network :), and
do the things we love to do together.

I would be happy to help organize and coordinate everyone's efforts if 
folks are into such a thing.  We would need a space, a sound system
appropriate to the size of that space, DJs, and anything else you want
to bring that's fun.

Please email me with your comments, suggestions, and offerings if you're
interested in such an event, or have feelings about it.  I will summarize
to the list.

Thanks!  I look forward to seeing you soon!

nitrous is *great* fun!  however, i wouldn't want to do it at a
rave... it's the ultimate crawl-inside-yourself drug and raves are
about opening yourself up, not shutting yourself off.

i find this incredibly suspect.  unless the van was absolutely
airtight and they were breathing nothing but pure nitrous, maybe.  but
it's more likely they'd start giggling and then if there was a high
enough concentration of nitrous in the cab, they'd pass out and
probably crash the car.

you got a reference for this event?

I still love to go to them, but I have the same complaint. If it starts 
at 2 like it's supposed to, fine. But 3 or 4 is just way too late. That's 
why the Fremont one got shut down. If the party's already going with a 
strong crowd, the police can't do much other than stop other people from 
getting in. If everybody is milling around or there are just a few people 
waiting for it to start, the police have an easier time of stopping in 
completely.

Wish I could have gone to this one, but we were just too damn tired. 
Wanna go? <yawn> I dunno. You <yawn> wanna go? Well, if you really <yawn>

Seefeel are completely excellent.  The album "Quique" is going to be
released domestically by Astralwerks, btw.  I already bought the
import and it's great.

According to an article I read, Sine Bubble has nothing to do with
Richard James.

Well, there are the broun fellinis, but that's the club scene, and the
word acid is fairly minimal. However, there are two bands that I'm 
involved with right now, either of which might go in that direction.
One of them had a gig at 1015 Folsom a few months ago, but they were
doing the funkified thing at that time. My influence on this one is
minimal, since right now I'm just a sit-in, but things are changing all
the time :) I think you have a good idea, although I can't say that there's
anything wrong with the current paradigm. It may happen.

Not an event, but three guys in the cab of a parked pick up, with the windows
up tight and they were inhaling from balloons i believe when they
passed out with the tank on

All the news reports were that they OD'd on nitrous,
when of course they asphyxiated instead
but who really gets picky about stuff like that

They had a ton of fliers in the back of their car for some event
and i really DOUBT that had much of an impact on the rave scene
just on the nitrous scene
it was about 3 months before i saw nitrous again at a rave

THere are LOTS of great little events in LA,
you just have to find them,
the scene is not Dead, its just hiding in different places

It happened like two years ago in Chatsworth. They didn't crash the car,
apparently they were parked in the car. It was all over the major news
publications here in LA a few years ago...all the news shows began to do
major "rave exposes" using flyers that they found in their car as a 
guide. It was quite disgusting, really.

Status: 


well, not to bring up a huge thread that's been beat to death here
previously, but nitrous is the only drug that MIT tells its students
that if you are caught with it, you will be thrown out, no excuses
taken.  many people have died at MIT doing it in areas which aren't
all that sealed.  many people have also died from sealing the area to
intensify the effect.

if you are going to do nitrous, use balloons and do it outside.  the
biggest danger in this case is hitting something hard (like the
ground) when you pass out.  this danger shouldn't be minimized, i have
friends with facial scars from hitting a gravel surface.

if you do it inside, have the windows open and good air circulation.

the negative PR associated with nitrous is incredible precisely
because people die from it all the time.  nitrous has no oxygen in it,
and using a lot of it will make your lips and hands turn blue.

imho, on the other hand, proper use is as safe as a trip to the
dentist :-) tho there are those who would argue with this and claim
that the brain is damaged by the lack of oxygen (i.e. some people
argue that most of the effects are from oxygen deprivation than an
actual effect of the nitrous).

yow!

There was a lot of hoopla about this several years ago. The media jumped 
on it immediately to show how immoral and dangerous drugs are. ;) If I

   i find this incredibly suspect.  unless the van was absolutely
   airtight and they were breathing nothing but pure nitrous, maybe.  but
   it's more likely they'd start giggling and then if there was a high
   enough concentration of nitrous in the cab, they'd pass out and
   probably crash the car.

   you got a reference for this event?

maybe i remember a different event but, it was a long time ago, and it was
on every local news program that night...

3 guys and a pickup truck.  they had stolen 2 cylinders of NO, one was still
in the bed, the other in the cab.  from the news footage, the pickup was
parked by the curb on what appeared to be a fairly busy street.  the cab's
windows were closed and they were asphixiated.  there were plenty of
references to doing NO as a hip thing done in clubs etc...

maybe somebody else on this list from SoCal can verify this...

hope you're being sarcastic... seefeel use drum machines and synths
and samplers to mutate and mangle the guitar noise.  usually they
sample a loop of guitar skronk and build a bizarre towering dub
inferno over it.  i love 'em.

Yes, I was there too - and it was fun.  I'll definately be there tomorrow.
Anyone know who the DJs are?  And BTW, park rules only allow 5 hours
of amplified sound, so it'll be interesting to see if there
really is music from 11-6.

Oh Goodie!!  I got a little time to whip up a report on the Full Moon
Rave last evening....

Not sure that FMR was even to take place,   I headed into SF early
to try and score some IOB.    After that,  I headed over to Space Lab
and got treated to the most awsome trancey tunes I've heard since listening
to a German mix I got from my German friend.    It was really good
hoppin 145 BPM acid trance.    Yow!!   I couldn't sit down,   it just 
grabbed me by the "Wazoo" and didn't let go.

After a while,   I decided to give my knee a rest (And some ice),  and
hung around and schmoozed for a while.    I met Martinko 
(martinko@netcom.com) for the first time.

Brian was there,  and gave me the FMR location and asked me not to
give out the info till after 1 am.   Besides,  I was having so much fun
trancing out to some incredably awsome trance.

Eventually,  all good things must come to an end,  so after the plug
was pulled on SpaceLab,   I headed east over to E. Bay and somehow
managed to locate the FMR,  which was literally in the dump.   It
was a large landfill area near the race tracks in North Berkeley.

As I approached the parking area,  I saw at least 50 - 60 cars neatly
parked in a very large parking area.    I saw other groups of people
heading in the general direction of the bay,   on this small penninsula
made out of landfill.    The walkway was rather tretcherous,  and
one had to be careful not to get stabbed by concrete re-enforcement
rods.    Knowing how clumbsey I am,  especially in dark area,  I
had to be extra careful.    The IOB didn't help matters either.

I kept walking and walking and STILL didn't hear any music.    Some
people were leaving the area,  and politely told me to "Follow the
arrows",   which really helped out.     I must have walked 
about a half mile,   and faintly in the distance,  I heard what 
might be the music.    Sure enough,  it was getting louder,  so I must
still be going the right direction.    This was about 4 am when I arrived.

I wandered sround,  looking for little arrows,  and eventually,  just
behind this mound,  I could hear people cheering and blissing out.

The "Gas heads" were out in force that evening,   and I don't even want
to know how many nitrus tanks were whooshing. 

First thing I did was to locate a nice spot to taste more of this IOB.
I wanted my head to be in the right space for THIS event.

Finally,  as I headed over to the dance area to get into some pretty
good tunes,   the music stopped.   Yukk!!  generator failed.   I 
commented "Someone forgot to feed the generator!".    The music
eventually started up again,   but didn't last long.    Apparently the
generator was making a last gasp for survival.    Eventually,  things
started up again,   and at least a good hours worth of dancing out in
the clear moonlight really put my luv phazers on to full blast.

Then the music stopped,  so I decided it was good time to chill out
and schmooze for a while.    Really good crowd this morning.   The
music wasn't going to start up again,   until someone volunteered to
walk all the way back for more gas.    At this point,  I decided to
go and get some food.    It was about 6:00 am.    As I headed over to 
the freeway,   I noticed an unusual amount of cars,  and I figured that
if I waited another half hour,   I would never get mack to Marin,  so
I headed home.

This FMR location has to have been the BEST site for a rave then anything
I've seen so far.    A little more effort to clear away the junk,  and
a very large dance area can be realized.

They also had decorated a mound side with multiple colored lights that
added to the visuals.

So,  in closing I would say that this FMR was a really good one.   I'd
say at least 200 plus people attended,   although a tad more descrete
as lots of people didn't know of its location.

Later... Keep the ecene alive!!

Lest you or anyone else think I'm tsk tsk-ing the use of nitrous, I would
like to say that I am not.  All I've personally heard about nitrous seems 
to indicate (to me) that the possible positive effects from doing it are 
outweighed by the possible negative consequences.  Just like skydiving.  
And what I've read from other contributors to this list today hasn't
changed my opinion ! I merely mentioned it in the FMR context because 
in the recent past there has been a lot of comment regarding those seen 
as wrong-type-ravers who take nitrous at renegades.  I was simply trying 
to paint an accurate picture of what I saw, no judgement should be implied.

Actually, this prohibition-like attitude puzzles me.  Alcohol is frowned 
upon at these parties, I know.  This may be because of litter problems 
posed by bottles and cans after the event, but I think it's discouraged 
because it is seen as a nasty intoxicant, likely to be a catalyst for 
arguments or violence.  I'm of the opinion that if you are an aggro-prone 
individual, you are probably going to be difficult to encounter regardless 
of whether you've imbibed e, nitrous, alcohol or indeed nothing at all.  
Jeez, I like a good gargle every now and again myself, it doesn't turn a 
timid individual like me into a nutter.  And I suspect that a guy who goes 
nuts when he's had a few drinks isn't going to turn into a lamb if he 
takes e.  There doesn't seem to me to be a direct provable correspondence 
between menacing behavior and any one particular substance that we routinely
see at these events.

The coolness-hierarchy (unless I'm misreading what I've seen on this list)
applied to these substances seems to me to be wrongheaded.  Any of the 
substances I've mentioned here can be lethal in string doses.

As far as I'm concerned, the only rule is "Take whatever you want, just 
respect yourself and others".  And don't do anything stupid like overdose
or asphyxiate. 

Besides which, the music is the important thing.

Pk.

'acid jazz' event Ive ever been to was something called
'SpeakEasy'.  In a small warehouse near the Haze Theatre,
live jazz band that wailed til 6 in the morning.  Great
crowd...some ravers, some goths, some clubbers, and other

While I didn't go to this FMR, I know of the area it was in and I have
to beg to differ.

The best location I'm aware a rave has occurred in:  Bonny Doon beach.

The best site for a rave (implicit john "powerpc warrior" s. lee IMHO
here): Hoyt Arboretum in Portland, OR.

Not that the FMR (SF style) could have been there, but if you've been
there really late at night w/ a clear sky (rare in portland) then you
know what I mean.

keggers/yr  in the rose gardens (non-pdx'ers: about 1/3 mile away from
Hoyt) but anything out of the ordinary in Washington Park is sure
disaster, esp. that close to OMSI.

(not that I have anything against yuppie keggers, I was at a lot o'
them meself over the yrs, PDX police is just really funny about who
gets busted.)

I just realized I still owe nw-raves a list of suggested sites...
sorry, I'll put it together and send it, Fred.

Hoyt would be so fucking awesome.  Too bad it will never happen.

I like many different kinds of music, and yes I like Spaceman 3.

There wouldn't be so many problems with nitrous if people would fill the
tank 50/50 with nitrous/oxygen. That's what people used to do in the
70's. Actually they would fill one tank with oxygen and another one with
nitrous, then they would fill a single size water bed with 50/50 and attach
a one way valve with a short hose to it. This would be in the center of the
room with everyone sitting in a circle around it. Then the hose would make
its rounds with the others pushing on the mattress. BTW , to state the 
obvious, the bed was empty to start with. Anyway at that time it was great
fun. I haven't done it since then because straight nitrous gives me a 
horrid headache and I don't like the idea of killing off my brain cells
by aphyxiating them.

Which one?  There were two of them:  one in May '92 thrown by the Hardkisses,
then one in September '92 that was a joint production of dozens of promoters
(incl. Martin, Gavin H., and SFR) where we raised hundreds of dollars for
charity.  That was the day following the first Bonny Doon FMR.

They were both wonderful experiences.

Well, being 700 miles away will make it hard for me to help much :-)

Still, I hate to say it but Phred's right. (not that I hate to say
that Fred's right, it's just a big bummer that it couldn't happen).
There are at least 2 insurmountable problems to a big party there.

1.  Proximity of anal retentive neighborhood
	An SF equivalent would be trying to throw a renegade FMR on
the Presidio golf course.

2.  Parking
	While there are 3 lots nearby, they are either patrolled (like the
one by OMSI) or in view of a major road (the one by the rose gardens).
Other than that it's all narrow roads.


Also, it's been a couple years since I went to a party up there, so
this phenomenon may no longer exist, but for some unknown reason,
parties in the park, esp. near the rose gardens courts, *always* seem
to have  huge numbers of people hanging around in anticipation, no matter how
"private" the party is supposed to be.  Parties have been busted an
hour before they were supposed to start because police came up and
dispersed the crowd waiting for the party! 

(Portland police are notorious for this kind of thing, indeed it might
be their primary function.  We used to joke that if the police were
around you were guaranteed to be safe, since they were guaranteed
never to be anywhere near an actual crime.... they're too busy raiding
the Satyricon or other clubs. :)

I have no idea why it happens, but it would be hard to keep people
from visibly milling around the area before the party.  It's like
local high-school partiers can sense when a party is going to go off.

I think you are making the "coolness-hierarchy" in your own head.
Other than that, I think many people would agree with you.  

Of course, every persons idea of what *respect* means is probably 
different.  That seems to be the root of most conflict - a perceived

While reading alt.rave today I came across Captain Crunch's 
review of the FMR.  

Was it really a good idea to post the location of the FMR site -- even 
after the fact -- the a world-wide distributed newsgroup?  Especially
since this was a virgin site? I thought Wicked was feeling that the FMRs 
were getting too big and that they should go deeper underground.  

Just wondering.

I know I'm being paranoid, but I think it's a good idea to keep 
re-usable renegade location information quiet.  

Sometimes a little caution is a good idea.  All we need is a bunch of 
careless people to use a good renegade site for some wild beer party 
(or even a rave) and trash the place or have someone get hurt and then 
*blam* we lose another good site.

Yeah Laura, I agree totally in principle, but somehow I doubt the big
problem here will come from people w/ net access...  I'd say it's more
likely that someone at the party will use it again than someone on the
net, but not at the party.

You're right, though, now the whole net world (incl. any constables
listening in) knows about the site.  Although I've heard really mixed
things about this particular location wrt a rave.  (I know roughly
where it was, and I wouldn't plan a party there... too many ways for
people to get hurt.)

Yes, I agree with Laura that it's a good idea to keep a re-usuable
renegade location very ,very QUIET.  My friend who thought that the
FMR was going to happen at the Marina said he saw police hanging out 
there when he went by around 3:30 or so on Thursday night/Friday 
morning.  The police know what's what, especially when the moon is full.
I mean, I thought the point of not disclosing the location on this
sfraves was to AVOID it getting busted, the night of or in the future.

Personally I think that there are not going to be people on sfraves or
alt.raves looking for renegade spots where they can go have wild beer
parties anyway.  I'm in Oregon right now and when I come back for the
summer I think it's great that if someone says "it's at the landfill" I'll
know just about where it is.  Most people who don't care too much I don't
think are going to sit around and write this stuff down.  For instance if
you told me Bonny Doon or the Water Temple or Candlestick it's as simple as
that, I don't need further info I know what is being talked about.  This
way the directions become simpler for the people who care to know and
remember.  Just my own opinion.

I pretty much agree, Laura.  In fact, I had serious afterthoughts
after posting my review yesterday.  A little discretion goes a long
way, ditto indiscretion....

In any event, the word is going to spread quickly about the location.
Putting it on sfraves just accelerates the process, in that the word
is diseminated to >300 people simultaneously.  Putting it on alt.rave
takes it one step further.

Others have said it but here's my .02:

Some things should be kept amongst family.  Posting the location or a clear
description of the whereabouts has the potential of alerting certain
authorities in such locales.

Hey, the cops KNOW what's going on (the may be cops, but they aren't *that*
stupid).  So why talk about the location...why talk about it to those not
involved with the SF scene (i.e. not on SFR List)?  Hell, it's a free
country and you can say what you please, but don't forget about the
consequences of being so free with info, there is more than the individual
to keep in mind (at times).

Oh well...I wish I understood why things are done.  Maybe then I would
understand why certain things get undone.

Site will ALWAYS have limited usefulness, what should happen is that there
is a pool of renegade sites, so that we can alternate and not burn any single
site out.  If we used Bonnie Dune for each and every FMR then the authorities
would feel compelled to take a position, (this is what happened to Berkeley
Marina) the best thing to do is to keep looking for fresh spaces ALL THE
TIME and don't use any one space too much.  I think a small (50 -100 person)
party could work at the water temple if it were kept quiet and was executed
properly (no cars to give it away, I have a plan if anyone is interested :)
a FMR would never be allowed to happen however.

Status: 

The only "bad" thing about some of the parties is that they never seem to
end.  There is always the "last" of something or other.  I think that
things come to an end, and it's best to end a project as gracefully as
possible.  But always telling people that it is the "very last", and then
to put on another party with the same name, just makes people go "er, uh,
but I thought...".

The Gathering, Wicked, A Rave Called Sharon are well over a couple of years
old now and are in need of progeny.  Just a few suggestions:

The Gathering's progeny should be called Gathering II or Perpetual
Gathering, or Gathering Returns.  It's obvious it ain't goin' away any time
soon so (besides, it's GREAT to see a Gathering that does not use the
Jeno/Garth combo! Right On!!!)...

Wicked should spawn the Son Of Wicked or The Boyz Bollocks or just plain
Bollocks.  What was once "the one", has become another club.  Like an old
man, it very well could be past it's prime.  Time to pass it on to a
yungun... (Markie is STILL the man tho' !!!!).

A Rave Called Sharon should just stop.  Besides the fact that it's namesake
is now married, and the party should rightfully become community property.
So it's spawn would be more properly named A Rave Called Mrs. Preston, or A
Rave Called Sharon & Preston, or A Rave Called Community Property. In any
case he (Halim) needs to pay people before throwing another party....I
guess a more apt name would be A Rave Called The Check Is In The Mail.

I dunno about other parties, I am just watching as each one goes on for 365
days.  Once it reaches that age, I think it's time for the soap factory.

The park: fresh air, sunlight always brings out the best in people.
The joy of being in a setting of revitalization is absolutely the

Actually the TV itself is pretty innocuous (sp?).  In fact you are reading
this on a television of sorts (how much different *really* is a computer
monitor?).  It's like any other tool.  It's all in how you utilize it.  You
can take a hammer and pound people on the head or you can build a shelter.
The problem with TV is everyone is running around pounding people on the

Yesssss!  I agree totally!

and now I get to play the hypocrite.  (again :-).

For the first time in over 2 years, I own a TV.   (It was given to
me.)  And I have to say that the 'Recliner ski jump" by miller lite is
so far (15:05 hrs) the best commercial of this years' Superbowl.

[[ I'm watching because I expect apple to have another sweet
commercial during halftime, this being the 10 yr. anniversary of the
famous "1984" Mac commercial.]]

Having nothing better planned for 2day, I'll keep y'all posted :-)

Yeah, it was great.  I miss not having a TV.

Ok, superbowl update:  Nat Cole sang the national anthem, though it
seemed kind of weak because they were using an ancient-sounding DX7
piano patch as the synth lead.  In the current setting, kinda like
Mariah Carey meets Desert Storm.   The choir was great, but in the
setting it seemed too much like a "we're white but we want to get
across this message that BLACK PEOPLE ARE IMPORTANT TOO!" type
message.  John S. Lee is probably cursing (if he's even watching this
blatant media pyroflatulation :-)

The first Coke commercial is WEAK.  Miller Lite is still on top.
The Bud Bowl opening wasn't bad graphically, but was aimed at a ~3rd
grade audience.  How they can legally buy bud wasn't explained.

Converse, however, came out on top.  Although Miller Lite is still

No shit.  You suddenly have all this _time_ to do things you didn't
before.  I can play guitar, bass, drums, and enough keyboards to make
synth muzik -- I have read and done enough to consider myself an
authority on science fiction, situationism, ecotopianism, anarchy,
co-operatives, and New Hype Religions, and still have time to be
"into" tekno, punk, weird electronic knobtwisting, and the occasional
foray into newspapers just to see how boring people live, not to
mention writing arcade games for money.

Television is an _inherently_ fascist medium, because the tiny group of
people who control the broadcast control the dissemination of information
to millions who watch it.  This information bottleneck at the top
guarantees easy control of content, as anyone who has participated in
an event later covered by the news can attest.

And I don't have stupid commercials running through my head all the time --
at least no more than when I stopped.

If you want to do fun things, get rid of your TV, and suddenly they will
become possible.  I shit you not.

Naw, dump your TV.  Though I sarcastically posted stuff based on my tv
earlier, it was all non-serious.  Quite seriously, it's all a bunch of
shit..  Watching the tube after 2 yrs of near-abstinence reinforces
this.  

What a bunch of bullshit.

I really hate aguing the side of TV, I'm a habitual non-watcher :-), BUT...
I would have totally agreed with this statement 15 years ago, i.e.,
CBS,ABC,NBC.  (Oligarchy rather than Fascism.)  I would argue that this is
becoming less true every day.  Those old ivory towers of communications are
crumbling very rapidly.

I would also argue that there is very little in the way of information
being disseminated.  It's a noise to information ratio of about 1000/1.
The answer is not to just never watch, you just have to have a mighty fine
filter!

Oh!!  There is a GREAT book on this very subject that everyone should read!
It's called "The Age of Missing Information"  by Bill McKibben.  McKibben
collected all the television footage broadcast in one 24hr period via a
cable network in Fairfax, VA and watched all of it (including some 25
episodes of The Brady Bunch).  Then he compared that "information" with the
information he gained by taking a 24hr hike in the Adirondack Mtns.

Well after reading your comments on television.. I admit tv is bad.. I 
have watched less and less of it lately. That is bad for me, because I am 
required to watch tv for class.. (I am a mass media major). The more I 
watch tv or event study the media, the less I enjoy it..  There are VERY 
few quality tv shows that are on. Majority of them are on PBS, Bravo, and 
the Discover channel. That is why I have cable. 

Now a more productive time is spending time reading, enjoying music, or 
even being on the net.. In some ways, if you think about it, your 
computer is your television.. It provides entertainment and news 
interactively.  And it is addicting!!!

 Hmm.. maybe they will get the hint if we start putting out stickers that

Now when they get that SuperHigway to Hell going, I WONT be plugging into

Since I get all the NEWS that's fit via my gruesome threesome (Hard

	Here are some tips from an owner, restorer, and user of
	vintage mechanical, analog, and digital electronic music
	devices:

	Never buy anything from Guitar Center. Ever.
	Never buy anything from Sam Ash.

	Never accept ludicrous prices for gear that is single purpose:
	i.e. Roland TR-808, TB-303, Moog, and all other non-MIDI
	synths.

	If you want to buy from a dealer who will support it for
 	90 days and give you a reasonable price call up
	Starving Musician in Santa Ana, CA, or Carusos Music in
	New London, CT. I don't have their phone #s off hand.
	If you wan't to buy a Sequential Circuits box then call up
	Wine Country in San Jose.

	If you can, try out the gear and push every single button
	and twist every single knob on it. 

	Do the knobs make noise? Do some of the buttons not work?

	If something isn't 100% functional make sure you haggle a 
	good price for it.

	Always ask for the manual. If they dont' have it
	haggle a better price. Complex gear needs manuals.

	Try to buy efficient musical instruments. A TB-303 is a very
	simple synth and you can spend far less money for far more
	powerful devices that will be more useful i.e. any
	MIDI controlled analog synth. Same with a TR-808.

	Don't expect to MIDI up your old analog gear unless you have
	a lot of money and/or have good electronics skills.

	Beware of samplers that have proprietary storage. If the
	discs aren't 3.5" and the hard drive isnt' SCSI then don't
	buy it.

	And the most important point: dont' try to sound like
	everyone else. We have way to much TB-303 sounding stuff.
	
	if you have any *serious* questions about electronic music
	gear please email me.

	     Aphex Twin runs his whole show from his Sequential

No, TELEVISION is evil.

I didn`t always have this belief, I use to watch "redeaming"
TV like PBS, Discovery, Star Trek:TNG, etc. With a little Twin Peaks
thrown in to get my dose of twisted psychosis.  I thought as most of
you all did that television "was just a tool" it depends on how you use
it... well I suppose explosive nuclear devices "are just tools" as well
but I'm willing to bet that 99.999% of these devices in the world are not
intended for mining (or some other such benign use) Anyway, the Gulf War came
along and every single fuckin station got in goose step behind the government,
I don't want to start a flame war on this but you would think that with over
250,000 in the streets of SF protesting the war KQED of all places could have
come up with more balanced reporting.  This is when I decided that I had
had it with Television and turned it off for good.

Obrave:  Now I have a lot more time for raving :)

Actually, if you have a *really* old analog synth that uses control voltages
and patch cords (like my ARP 2600), you can buy a fairly inexpensive
MIDI-to-CV box from PAIA in Oklahoma.  If you buy it in kit form it's even
cheaper.  If I can dig up my catalog I can provide more info on this
product.

Subject: Privacy As Roadkill
To: com-priv@psi.com
 
Jacking in from a "Private No More" Port:
 
Washington, DC -- If privacy isn't already the first victim of
roadkill along the information superhighway, then it's about to be.
 
A law enforcement panel addressing the Administration's Information
Infrastructure Task Force Working Group on Privacy told a public
meeting here last week that it wanted to "front load" the National
Information Infrastructure with trap door technologies that would
allow them to easy access to digital conversations;  eavesdropping
on any conversation or capturing electronic communications
midstream.
 
But only for "the bad guys."  Us honest, hard working, law abiding
citizens have nothing to fear from these law enforcement agencies
selling out our privacy rights to make their jobs easier.  Nope, we
can rest easy, knowing that child pornographers, drug traffickers
and organized crime families will be sufficiently thwarted by law
enforcement's proposed built-in gadgetry for the national
information infrastructure.
 
There's just a small problem:  Law enforcement agencies, any law
enforcement agency, has yet to prove it needs all these proposed
digital trap doors.  In fact, according to a U.S. Assistant
Attorney appearing on the panel, "Right now most law enforcement
personnel don't have any idea what the NII is."
 
Gore Gives Go Ahead
===================
 
Panel members, representing the Justice Dept., FBI and U.S.
Attorney's office, said that they took Vice President Gore's
promise that the White House would work to ensure that the NII
would "help law enforcement agencies thwart criminals and
terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications to commit
crimes," as tacit approval of their proposals to push for digital
wiretap access and government mandated encryption policies.
 
Gore buried those remarks deep in a speech he made in Los Angeles
earlier this month when the Administration first fleshed out how it
planned to rewrite the rules for communications in a newer, perhaps
more enlightened age.  Those remarks went unnoticed by the
mainstream press.  But readers here were forewarned.
 
Fuck Ross Perot's NAFTA-induced "giant sucking sound."  That
"thump" you just heard was Law Enforcement running over the privacy
rights of the American public on its way to the information
superhighway.  The real crime is that the collision barely dented
the damn fender.
 
This cunning and calculated move by law enforcement to install
interception technologies all along the information superhighway
was blithely referred to as "proactive" law enforcement policy by
Assistant U.S. Attorney, Northern Dist. of California Kent Walker. 
Designing these technologies into future networks, which include
all telephone systems, would ensure that law enforcement
organizations "have the same capabilities that we all enjoy right
now," Walker said.
 
With today's wiretap operations, the Feds must get a court to
approve their request, but only after supplying enough evidence
warrant one.  But Walker seemed to be lobbying for the opposite. 
Giving the Feds the ability to listen in first and give
justification later was "no big difference," he said. Besides, "it
would save time and money."
 
It's Us vs. Them
=================
 
For Walker privacy issues weighed against law enforcement needs are
black and white, or rather "good guys" vs. "bad guys."   For
example, he said the rapid rise of private (read: non-government
controlled) encryption technologies didn't mean law enforcement
would have to work harder.  On the contrary, "it only means we'll
catch less criminals," he said.                    
 
But if law enforcement is merely concerned with the task of "just
putting the bad guys in jail," as James Settle, head of the FBI's
National Computer Crime Squad states, then why are we seeing an
unprecedented move by government intelligence agencies into areas
they have historically shied from?  Because law enforcement
agencies know their window of opportunity for asserting their
influence is right now, right at the time the government is about
to take on a fundamental shift in how it deals privacy issues
within the networks that make up the NII, says David Sobel, general
counsel for Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
(CPSR), who also spoke as a panel member.
 
"Because of law enforcement's concerns (regarding digital
technologies), we're seeing an unprecedented involvement by federal
security agencies in the domestic law enforcement activities,"
Sobel said.
 
Sobel dropped-kicked this chilling fact from behind the closed
doors of the Clinton Administration into the IITF's lap:  For the
first time in history, the National Security Agency (NSA) "is now
deeply involved in the design of the public telecommunications
network."
 
Go ahead.  Read it again.
 
Sobel backs up his claims with hundreds of pages of previously
classified memos and reports obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act.  The involvement of the NSA in the design of our
telephone networks is, Sobel believes, a violation of federal
statutes.
 
Sobel's also concerned that the public might soon be looking down
the throat of a classified telecommunications standard being
created.  Another move he calls "unprecedented," is that if the
NSA, FBI and other law enforcement organizations have their way,
the design of the national telecommunications network will end up
classified and withheld from the public.
 
Sobel is dead bang on target with his warnings.
 
The telecommunications industry and FBI have set up an ad hoc
working group to see if a technical fix for digital wiretapping can
be found to make the Bureau happy.  That way, legislation doesn't
need to be passed that might mandate such FBI access and stick the
Baby Bells with eating the full cost of reengineering their
networks.
 
This joint group was formed during a March 26, 1992 meeting at
FBI's Quantico, Va., facilities, according previously classified
FBI documents released under Freedom of Information Act. The group
was only formalized late last year, working under the auspices of
the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS).  The
joint industry-FBI group operates under the innocuous sounding name
of the Electronic Communications Service Provider Committee
(ECSPC).
 
The ECSPC meets monthly with intent of seeking a technological
"solution" to the FBI's request for putting a trap door into
digital switches that would allow them easy access to those
conversations. To date, no industry solution has been found for the
digital wiretap problem, according to Kenneth Raymond, a Nynex
telephone company engineer, who is the industry co-chairman of the
group.
 
Oh, there's also a small, but nagging problem:  The FBI hasn't
provided a concrete basis that such solutions are needed, Raymond
said.  CPSR's Sobel raised these same points during the panel
discussion.
 
The telecommunications industry is focused on "trying to evaluate
just what is the nature of the [digital access] problem and how we
can best solve it in some reasonable way that is consistent with
cost and demand," Raymond said.   One solution might be to write
digital wiretap access into future switch specifications, he said.
 
If and when the industry does find that solution, do you think the
FBI will put out a press release to tell us about it? "I doubt it
very much," said FBI agent Barry Smith with the Bureau's
Congressional Affairs office. "It will be done quietly, with no
media fanfare."
 
Is it just me or are these headlights getting REALLY close?
 
The FBI's Settle is also adamant about trap door specifications
being written into any blue prints for the National Information
Infrastructure. But there's a catch.  Settle calls these "security
measures," because they'll give his office a better chance at
"catching bad guys."  He wants all networks "to be required to
install some kind of standard for security."  And who's writing
those standards?  You guessed it:  The NSA with input from the FBI
and other assorted spook agencies.
 
Settle defends these standards saying that the "best we have going
for us is that the criminal element hasn't yet figured out how to
use this stuff [encryption and networks in general].  When they do,
we'll be in trouble. We want to stay ahead of the curve."
 
In the meantime, his division has to hustle.  The FBI currently has
only 25 "net literate" personnel, Settle admitted. "Most of these
were recruited 2 years ago," he said.  Most have computer science
degrees and were systems administrators at time, he said.
 
You think that's funny?  Hell, the Net is a still small community,
relatively speaking.  One of your friends is probably an FBI Net
Snitch, working for Settle.  Don't laugh.
 
Don't Look Now, Your Privacy Is Showing
=======================================
 
The law enforcement establishment doesn't think you really know
what you expect when it comes to privacy.
 
U.S. Attorney Walker says:  "If you ask the public, 'Is privacy
more important than catching criminals?'  They'll tell you, 'No.'"
 
(Write him with your own thoughts, won't you?)
 
Because of views like Walker's, the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act (ECPA) "needs to be broader," said Mike Godwin, legal
services counsel, for Electronic Frontier Foundation, speaking as
a panel member.  The ECPA protects transmitted data, but it also
needs to protect stored data, he said.  "A person's expectation of
privacy doesn't end when they store something on a hard disk."
 
But Walker brushed Godwin aside saying, "It's easy to get caught up
in the rhetoric that privacy is the end all be all."
 
Do you have an expectation of privacy for things you store on your
hard disk, in your own home?  Walker says that idea is up for
debate:  "Part of this working group is to establish what is a
reasonable expectation of privacy."
 
That's right.  Toss everything you know or thought you knew about
privacy out the fucking window, as you cruise down the fast lane of
the information superhighway.  Why?  Because for people like
Walker, those guardians of justice, "There has to be a balance
between privacy needs and law enforcement needs to catch
criminals," he says.
 
Balance, yes.  Total abrogation of my rights?  Fat chance.
 
 
Meeks out...

Television is an electron beam sweeping across phosphors. It's an

Most Television Programming is not, shall we say, utilitarian. It is
designed specifically to make money by making us pay attention to it
as long as possible. That being the driving force behind its existence
it is not surprising at all that things have reached this state.

The real evil is the lack of alternatives sufficiently interesting to
make people want to do them instead of TV. Some of us get bored with
TV and seek other things. Others perhaps don't get above the
"action-reaction" mental state, and stay dependent on TV for
stimulation.

I'll agree with one thing Clinton said in his address last week: "We
need to give kids more things to say 'yes' to."

That was my revelation too when I stopped watching TV, how much time
it was using. At first, I didn't know what to do with the time. I'd
get bored. But after a while, other interests kick in, and the time is
filled doing other things.

I've got so many projects planned and going on now, I feel like I have
no time at all :). I wish there were more hours in the day. Boredom? I
let loose of that concept years and years ago. Nowdays when I find or
plan a few hours to just mope around, I simply relax and enjoy letting
the brain run on idle for a while.

My life is so much richer, because I get real intellectual and
creative stimulation from the things I do with my time. I can hardly
watch TV now; it feels like someone is injecting Novacaine into my
brain, a sensation I distinctly do not like.

That really is the crux of it.  Some people (the ones who seem to make a

I guess a lot of journalists felt the same... 80 or so walked out in
protest of the "Thank God We're free" message in Natalie Cole's
performance, as (although it received little or no media attention),
there was a large civil rights protest going on outside during the
opening ceremony.  It was attended by Jesse Jackson, most of the
African-American politicians in GA, and many others, and was
protesting the Georgia State Flag (the confedarate states of amerikka
flag).  The fact that this got little or no coverage makes the Nat
Cole media extravaganza seem even more contrived.

Struck me that way anyway.

For ME,  a good TV program is NATURE,  or some first run nature program
like what might be on the Discovery channel.   I also like "Invention"
"Next Step",  and "Beyond 2000" as some of my favorites.  Very

WOW!  I would like to hear that tape.   I normally don't go on the netz
on Sundays,  so missed the news about the pirate station.   I used to
operate one myself in the 60's.    I remember Trickey Dick Nixon banning
certain songs because they had reference to drugs,   so we all went out
and aquired those songs,  and went on the air from my VW Bus.   I had
two battery operated turntables,  an FM transmitter that COULD put out
about 65 watts (but we didn't have set that powerful).    We went up into
the mountains over San Jose and was heard all over the bay area.
We called it "Free Wireless" or "San Jose Free Radio".   We learned
the FCC knew about it,  but we weren't sending out a "dirty" signal,
nor did we use profanity.    We used a phone company "Loop around" to
recieve phone calls from listeners.

If I remember,  I think I know the dude in Berkeley who is doing it,
but I doubt if he has the balls to go on the eir like this,  cause the
FCC already has a case pending on his previous activities.   Enough people
have bought his FM transmitter kits now,  so ANYONE could be doing it.
One can build a reasonably powerful FM transmitter for as little as $15
in parts.   Anyone having a pair od SL-1200's and a mixer could go on
the air.    Antennas can easily be constructed for less than $10.

The FCC has spectrum monitors,  usually in the hills in Livermore,   but
I'm sure they cover the bay area.    If a loud enough signel appears
on the FM band,   it signals attention.   Once the engineers detect
a signal,  they look for additional harmonics (Which are usually present
from hand made transmitters).   If they are interfering with other services,
they will attempt to locate it (Takes several seconds),  and go out and
investigate.   If not,   they usually will monitor it,   but most likeley
will not bother to shut it down.    Most people won't be going on the
air 12 hours a day for this very reason.    The FCC knows this,  and
has better things to do.   Don't ask me how I know all this,   but reliable
sources have enlightened me on this subject.

Weekend Rave Report
===================

This weekend,  had to entertain some guests from Japan,   but they were
more then willing to also partake in a little bit of raving...

Late this Saturday afternoon,   We went to the Organic party in GG park.
WOW!!  What clean good energy...  It was bigger and better than I expected,
and almost immediately saw all of my friends.    My Japanese guests were
really digging it and daning around.    Really good afternoon trancey
music that turned on my luv phasers to full blast.    The afternoon was
warm and sunny and just perfect for dancing.

It was held between the Steinhart Aquerium and the musium.    A picture
perfect setting to have a rave.    I sure hope we can have more of these
in the future.    

Then,  we headed down the penninsula to go to "House Sweet House" on the
Stanford campus.    Mostly a college affair,   but the SF Ravers were
behind the turn tables that kept the place hopping with some really fine
"housey" sounds.   There was barely enough room to dance,  which was 
unfortunate,  because the music was totally insane.    Amit (one of our
local SFRavers had his MIDI system in the chill area,  pumping out
some awsome trancey stuff.

We left around 1:30 Am and headed back into SF to ceck out Kulture Shok
It was in a new warehouse,  very big high cielings,   and very ideal for 
dancing.    It was so cool that I was able to dance for hours without 
stopping.   Great Funkey music,  and all the usual DJ's were there.    
They had a super powerful sound system,  but the corrugated aluminum 
walls and ceiling didn't help much with the acoustics.    Apparently 
they had the base speakers pointing out AWAY from the center of the dance 
area,  and the higher treble sounds were focused towards dance area.     
There were some interesting acoustical effects while I was moving around 
the dance floor.   I would say about 350 raver folks showed up at this
one.    Unfortunately,  the $20 admittance fees kept a lot of the old
schoolers away from this one.

The crowd at "Kulture Shok" was rather young (It was an ALL AGES event).
Very early on,  people were starting to get all hosed out.    The dance
floor was getting rather empty,   and you can tell that acid must be
scarce these days.

After Kulture Shok,   headed out for breakfast then headed over to
the DNA.    Things weren't happening over there yet,  so headed over
to Atlantis.    Later, returned to the DNA but there wasn't much 
happening so it closed early.    That afternoon,  the weather was really
great,  and enjoyed the outside patio area at the End Up and danced till
about 4 pm.     They had some really good funkey house playing all 
afternoon.

Keep the ecene alive...

Some of you remind me of this story I read my kids by good 'ol Frog and Toad
called Willpower.  Frog comes over to Toads house with a box of cookies which
they proceed to start eating.  The cookies are so good, they realize that
they can't stop eating them.  Toad tells Frog that what they need to help them
stop eating the cookies is something called "willpower" and proceeds to put
the lid on the box of cookies.  Frog quickly points out that all they need
to do is take the lid off the box and they will be in the same predicament
so Toad then wraps the lid on with a ribbon.  Frog points out that the scissorsare only a few steps away and that they can cut the ribbon so Toad puts the
cookies on a high shelf.  Frog points out that they can use the same ladder
to get the cookies down and then use the scissors to cut the ribbon and  then
take the lid off the box to eat cookies again.  Finnaly, they throw the cookiesout the window and shout "Hey birds, here are cookies" and a hungry mob quicklyeats all the cookies.  Satisfyed,  they look at each other and agree that
it's a good thing that they have "willpower".

Anyway, I think instead of "Kill you TV" I think it should be "Controll your

Definantly true.  My problem with television, despite my jokes about
missing not having one, isn't at all that I waste my time on it.  It's
that it's such a valuable communications resource being badly misused,
and in some cases used as a weapon in a psychological warfare campaign
aimed at the US public by companies/peepul/govt. agencies with the
cash to sway the media to spew forth their message.

Believe it or not, the programs I detest the most are ones, like the
"news", that most people consider the worthwhile part of television.
There are a few shows I actively like to watch, but overall TV just
seems like a festering pile of mis- or noninformation to me.

I will not force anyone to stop watching the tube.  I will point out
that my life improved drastically when I stopped.  We 100% agree here.

Someone else said:  (my mailer doesn't autoquote):

This is the central myth of mass-media, which is that it is a neutral
medium and can be put to good use if we just figured out how.  Television,
magazines, newspapers, radio:  all give a very few the power to control
information flow to the many.

Remember the saying "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely"?  For every Whole Earth Review sold there are tens of
thousands of Reader's Digests.  For every public access cable viewer
there are millions of people watching "Cops".  For every KPFK listener
there are millions of people dittoing Rush Limbaugh.

A distillation of the above two points: mass media is inherently fascistic.

I don't trust it one bit.  Any time I see a TV on in a house,
everyone's attention zips over to it and they stop interacting --
including me.  TV has been optimized for decades to catch your
attention with images and jingles, and it works.  You can't help but
be distracted by something that well-researched, especially when the
noise pervades the whole house.

I mean, sure, I _could_ leave a big sugar bowl full of blow on the
breakfast table, and if I had enough willpower I wouldn't have to
snort it all the time, but why waste the time tempting myself with
something I know I really don't want?

Kicking television is just like kicking any other drug.  If you want
to get off you don't surround yourself with it.  Now that I've been
off I can deal with my housemate's occasional laserdisc movies, but I
don't like them, and plan on finding TV-less housemates next time.

This thread may be in danger of straying from raves ( :-)) but ...

Technically, the 800- and 900-prefix information is called ANI, and is
passed from the Local Exchange Carrier to the long distance carrier
for billing purposes.  The long-distance carrier then passes it along
to the 800 or 900 subscriber in real-time, if the subscriber pays an
extra fee for this service.  The phone numbers always appear on the
(electronic) billing detail.  Phone number databases are then used to
determine billing information, as well probably income, probable
ethnicity, and so on.

The thing to remember is that ANI bears no relation to the information
used for Caller-ID, which is called CNI.  In some states, CNI can be
blocked from Caller-ID and similar services (often called CLASS
services), but ANI can never be blocked, because it is required for
long-distance billing, and there is no protocol for keeping the
long-distance carriers from giving the ANI information to anyone they
want.  The only way to block ANI is to launder your call through
something like "Private Lines" in Los Angeles.  Otherwise, 800 and 900
lines always know who you are (or who's phone you are calling from).

AmEx started using ANI, and for awhile they were greeting their
customers by name, as their account records come up.  Customers found
this very unnerving, and wasted a lot of AmEx's time with questions
about how AmEx knew customer names before customers announced
themselves.  So AmEx stopped greeting customers by name.  Of course,
they still use ANI to pull up customer records faster.

Another point which applies to both CNI and ANI: your number appears
even if you have a nunpublished/unlisted number.  For CNI, the billing
name is also delivered.

Yup.  Ever see one of those ads for a free 800-prefix phone call to

nice list of decongestant/antihistamine customers.

I don't really know, but it seems unlikely that the media much cares
what public opinion is, except that dramatic or wierd swings in public
opinion are cheap sources of "news".  Advertisers care with all their
being about the public's opinion of their products.  Money is power,

 What would you consider to be the perfect rave? I have my own ideas of the
perfect rave as im sure everyone else has their own thoughts. Being involved
in the production and promotion of raves i am curious to know what the public
would like to see and experience at parties. I personally think its the duty
of any good promoter to present the audience with a new music experience
every time. Going out and hearing the same old DJs play at the same old
parties gets a little old and boring week after week. How can a scene grow
and evolve without new music pushing our minds and body's to new heights? It
cant.
 So speak up and let us know what you want from a party. What DJs do you like
locally and what DJs would you want to be brought in for an event? What
promotional things would you like to see used? What things what you like to
see brought back to raves?(Dr. Seuss hats,whistles,free candy,break
ins,.....) What locations would you wanna see used for parties?(keeping in
mind the police have cracked down on parties) And anything else you would
like to see at the PERFECT rave. 
 Remember this is your scene. You make it happen. Lets make 1994 a turning
point in the way raves are thrown. Peace and "keep it real".

occasion, listen to Techno/house/disco/trance music.  I am somewhat of an

It's good to see the unity of all the people in the rave scene (at least

	What about Drum+Guitar City?  I go there on occasion and really like the

Guitar Center in LA is just a trendy place to go.  I don't know of many
functioning musicians who order there.  Most order from Manny's music
Mailbox in NY.  Regardless, the advice about testing gear was very sound
not only for the Rave musicians, but for all stage/recording musicians. 
However, I must disagree about the Moog.  This is vintage stuff here.  I
guess that it doesn't have much $$ appeal or efficiency, but I've never
hered an other set of keys produce sound like the original Moog.  Maybe I'm

You may be right that the media doesn't really care what the public
really think, at least about some issues.  But on issues like foreign
policy (not a *single* media commentator so much as questioned our "right"
to invade Panama, capture their head of state and bomb thousands of innocent
civilians to death in the process) or health care (single payer system?
That would cripple one of our biggest segments of advertisers) the media
constantly marginalizes perfectly reasonable views and pushes them
off of the scale of "acceptable" opinion.  Look how they treat drug
decriminalization.  Look what they did to Loni Guinier, or even Robert
Bork (yes, it can operate on both ends of the spectrum, but far more
often to one particular side.)

And even if I can't convince you of that (and I think Chomsky would
if you read him or see the movie), maintaining their *ability* to
manipulate public opinion is crucial, and these 900 feedback polls
are the ideal way to perfect their technique.  After all, they are merely
polls of people who are consumers of their particular medium, "not a
scientific sampling of the population", although the poll results strongly
influence those whose views are less certain.  They need to maintain this
ability in order to exert their power over politicians of either party.
(And the fact that they also produce revenue is icing on the cake!)

Advertisers care about far more than the popularity of their products.
Even more important is not to upset the status quo that lets them
operate under social conditions that if enough people started thinking
for themselves and demanding change, could be altered significantly to
their disadvantage.

Another strong point Chomsky makes is that built-in to the format
of those ubiquitous news-analysis programs (Nightline, Crossfire, MacNeil/
Lehrer, etc.) guest "experts" are only allowed 30 seconds or a minute at a
time to make their point, which means that anyone with an unorthodox
viewpoint would never have time to explain their position.  That's why
the guests on these programs always represent positions that are within
the boundaries of the "national party line", largely shared by both parties.

The media set the agenda, so that the people themselves cannot.  That's why
the percentage of people who rate crime as the #1 problem has more than
quadrupled since the clearly contrived over-exploitation of the Polly Klaas
story.  It surprises me that that isn't obvious to everyone.  (JSLee: 
please tell us you *were* being sarcastic about Hard Copy, Inside Edition,
etc. yes?)

Aside from Chomsky, two other excellent critiques of television I recommend
are _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ by Neil Postman, and _Four Arguments
for the Elimination of Television_ by Jerry Mander.  Postman basically
describes how TV has structurally reduced the terms of America's political
and social debate to the most trivial lowest common denominator.  Mander 
(a former advertising executive) makes many cogent observations; one I 
happen to like has to do with the hypnotic, addictive trance-like state
that is induced by the CRT scan (but there are dozens of other equally
powerful arguments).

I lived happily without TV for periods of my life, but I'll admit that
there are occasionally things worth watching (like Tales of the City!)
Still, I think we have an obligation to understand and challenge the
iron grip it has on the mentality of our society.

This is also why it's crucial that we demand the many-to-many model of the
Internet prevail in the current "Information Superhighway" debate -- if
the cable TV people win out on this one, we're all in *deep* shit folx.

The perfect rave should be a puny event (50-75 people, that's fine:)
in a great place. Good sound quality, gorgeous outdoor scene, esp w/ a view....
1 dance floor, 1 chill area... breakbeat, techno, house, trance, ambient.
Now, some local great dj's, spinning fresh tunes, willing to take risks
(tamara, jon d, ethan miller, ...)
The perfect dj lineup was liquid air in october, don't need lives, visuals, etc
Just a very friendly scene, maybe people brought food to share, and vibe.
I would go to a part cuj like that! ;-)))

 ok, as far as awsome rave sites go....worldwide:

Enchanted Rock in the texas hill country...(known locally as E-rock :)))

don't know how high it is, but its this big pink granite dome in the middle of
a flat area as far as you can see, and it's awsome!! Airlift in a sound

THAT would make me happy.

  I think that was Harmony... The main area was a field and the chill area
was in a grove of trees.  Carlos and Alonzo spun...  I had a great time at
that rave.  I just wish it would have started earlier.  Memories....  =)

SO I get home, and settle down so I can start the windown from a long day.
I look through my video catalog and find this tape buried in the rubble of
tapes.  It's called Come-Unity 4/93, given to me by NGV (Nitty Gritty
Video).

I turn it on, and it was sight!  This was the first benefit for Malachy,
with the monks and all that.  Looking at the tape it is obvious many had a
good time.  My favorite part tho was the music!  Jeno was on the decks, and
he was going *OFF*!  Do you understand?!?  I mean, he was doing the
recombinant DNA re-sequencing right there at the decks (I *HAD* to Geoff),
and you could really FEEL the power of this particular mix!  Incredible.

Another cool thing was the Garth set, and his closing set.  It's too bad he
can't spin like that any more.

Im back in '94, feet well planted.  When I look back on the past few years,
I know that it would be very difficult to match past glories (damn near
impossible), but it's always good to see where you came from.

It will be a long time before there is a combo that could hit as well as
Jeno/Garth.

The ONE duo I have got to see in '94 is the Carter/Farina combo, which I
hear is ballistic.  DCarter, from the last time I heard him, coulda given
Jeno a serious run for his money.  Jeno would have to *WORK* to do what
Carter can do on the decks.

Speaking of which...

I dunno...I'm gonna try to make both the Gathering & Wicked.  I've wanted
to hear the boys play for some time, but I dunno.  Markie seems to go off
during Wicked's, and since I can't make it to Rhythm all the time this may
be the weekend to catch him.  I wanna go to the Gathering to see some of
the SJ DJ's (like Harry, Spun, and Rick Preston).  I only hope the
Gathering is in the city.

Right.  And I suppose that before the advent of mass media "the people"
were setting the agendas for the power brokers of their time.  It is
a simple fact that as distorted/slanted/innaccurate the info we get
from the media is, people are more informed about what's going on in
the world than they *ever* were.  Call me an optimist, but ultimately,
I believe that truth will prevail - for those who want it.

Today's lowest commom denominator is more accurate than yesterday's.

I predict that interactive TV will eventually resemble the internet in

For me the perfect rave as well would be outdoors, something starting in the
sun (vitamen d feeeels soo good while dancing) going into the night. Not
being a partaker in drugs, i enjoy visuals for the cool things they do w/out
the help of drugs, and i would want some there, as the sun went down. A 
smaller party would be best, maybe 100-200 people, (small compared to some)
and as for dj's well, my bias is for Ernie munson, have him go late in the
evening, he is a great guy to just *listen* to. And (shameless plug for my
best friend) talizmen, he can really do some incredable things to songs,
and he knows how to get the crowd going. Most of the other dj's i am  not
familar enough with to request and those that i am i would not request.

anyway, just my hlaf-baked idea of what a perfect rave would be :)

This is pretty inaccurate.  It's pretty hard to "overdose" on E in one
shot (I've read reports of effects at >1000mg, and while it wasn't
dangerous per se, it was a bit overwhelming.)  The ratio of lethal
dose to active dose is much larger than you suggest (I don't think a
lethal dose even HAS been determined for E - I'd bet it's comparable
to the lethal dose of cauliflower :) What you may be thinking of is
the self-anti-addictive nature of E over the long run - the fact that
people generally do not abuse the drug, because the more often it's
taken, the lesser the effects.  Right now the only medical concern is
that when someone takes E for the first time, it (I can't remember
correctly) either depletea the brain of serotonin, or causes the brain
to stop the production of serotonin.  This comes back 18 months later,
supposedly.  The big question is - does this make any difference? 

Anyways, for more complete references, check out "Ecstasy - the MDMA
story" by Bruce Eisner - I think it just went into its second
printing, because I saw it had a new cover yesterday while in the
bookstore.  There are other good books too, like the above-mentioned
Psychedelic Encyclopedia by Peter Stafford.  Also, I've archived a ton
of stuff about E on the FTP/gopher/www site on techno.stanford.edu,
under /pub/raves/chemistry/mdma.  Check it out.

Finally, whilst on the topic of books.... while looking for a book
yesterday at Cody's I decided to check out one of the many books on
the Internet, and found a listing for sfraves in two of the three I
picked up!  They even had the correct address :)

Subject: Degeneration of Serotonergic Neurons and MDMA toxicity..
Status: 

   Ann started a thread that basically contains what I can gather about
the current opinion of the toxicity of MDMA.Basically,the studies
indicating serotonin receptor damage and a decrease in serotonin (5HT)
levels were derived from a study that used huge,intervenous doses of MDMA,
a pattern not at all similar to the usual vectors of human ingestion
(oral,much lower dose/kg) Note that I'm not absolutely sure of the gist
of this citation,since its something I overheard at a potluck last
Friday,but basically this is the current situation as I see it.

A more recent study,also using monkeys,found no measurable serotonin terminal
degeneration with similar doses /kg as are typical in human use patterns
and found no measurable brain damage.However,I would caution against the 
use of street drugs of unknown origin.I think further research needs to be
encouraged in "safe" intoxicants,since people like to alter their states 
of mind.This needs to be done by reputable laboratories.Education and risk 
reduction should be the primary method of drug 
control.Perhaps a distinction might be made between synthetic and natural
substances and synthetics be regulated through some kind of licensing
system so they could remain to be used in psychotherapy and guided 
consciousness exploration.Natural entheogens with a history of legitimate
religious use could be exempted unless their use began to pose social 
problems.This would enable a sense of reconciliation between the generational
factions and would empower a new truth and community based pragmatic
approach to the drug problem. Misinformation campaigns sour the atmosphere

you may be referring to a primate study (unpublished) conducted by george  
ricaurte.  in dosing primates with MDMA and then looking for morphological  
changes in their brains, he found that there was no effect after 2.5 mg/kg  
doses given every two weeks, for a total of eight doses.  but after a single  
oral dose of 5 mg/kg, he observed a 20% reduction in serotonergic neurons,  
only in the thalamus & hypothalamus.  there appears to be some regrowth over  
time, not necessarily complete, and also some "collateral sprouting" - growth  
of other types of neurons in the reduced serotonin areas.

note that in all of the animal studies, even when there are quite large  
serotonin system reductions (up to 90% in high MDMA dose rat studies), no  
behavioral deficits are observed.

it is also uncertain how these studies would extrapolate to humans - the  
human brain may well be more or less sensitive, or sensitive in different  
areas, compared with other animals.  in any case, what is known is that there  
are no reported cases that link behavior changes in humans with MDMA-induced  
serotonin system changes or "damage".   and, the long-term human behavior  
changes that are noted (in studies and from anecdotal case reports) are  
generally regarded as positive - lowered impulsiveness and hostility,  
improved social/interpersonal functioning, changes in religious/spiritual  
orientation or practice, etc.

one of the reasons so little is known about the physical effects of MDMA on  
the human brain is that no subjects (to date) have recorded their drug use  
history, then volunteered their brains for study.  if you would like to  
consider doing this, you can get donor information at 1-800-UM-BRAIN.

Brian, what YOU are posting is 'pretty inaccurate', and probably
dangerous. You suggest Eisner's book, here is a quote:

"Furthermore a very high dose might be physically harmful or even lethal.
Under no circumstances should anyoke take a dose over 250 mg."

While I agree that 250mg is an awfully conservative piece of advice, the
point is still clear. You suggest that no lethal dose even has been
determined??  We're talking here about a methamphetamine. You take too
much, your body is going to break in some way.

I know there is an excellent FAQ file on MDMA on alt.drugs... if there
is interest I could post it here, but it is very long. On the other hand,
if you want a copy, you can drop me a line.

Yikes! Flashbacktime. Remember the absolutely mind-warping laser effects 
they brought out after the big ceremony. Egads, I've never seen anything 
like that again. Watt for watt, nobody's matched the power of that show. 
My friends and I couldn't even dance. We were just staring slackjawed at 
the show. Anyone know who that was? JMAR.

!1 OTC  04/1 0947  MICROSOFT ANNOUNCES BETA RELEASE OF WINDOWS TP
 
REDMOND, WA (JAN. 13) BUSINESS WIRE - Microsoft Corp. announced
Thursday that a beta release of Windows TP, the telepathic operating
system, was released to 1,500 test sites worldwide.
   Developed using the soon-to-be released Microsoft C for Neurons,
Windows TP bypasses awkward user interfaces by interacting directly
with the user's brain. Using the Microsoft MindMouse, users can
visualize images in their mind, and the application associated with
that image (or "thought icon") is executed. Users can visualize
pictures to create Windows Bitmap images, or think text directly into
Windows applications. Windows TP is fully compatible with all previous
versions of Windows.
   Data stored under Windows TP can be copied into the user's
short-term memory (the Windows TP Clipboard), or transferred
directly into the user's long-term memory using Windows' new 32-bit
Direct Neuron Access technology.  Users can then plug into other
Windows TP systems to transfer the data.
   Microsoft also announced the first application developed exclusively
for Windows TP. CyberMail is a mental mail system designed to
transfer messages by thought. Users visualize the person or company
logo they want to send a message to, followed by the message to send.
Microsoft has had a beta version of the application in use for several
months.
   Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the worldwide leader in
software for personal computers. he company offers a wide range of
products and services for business and personal use, each designed with
the mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take
advantage of the full power of personal computing every day.

mole growing on the right side of her lip.  A blue tattoo on her right

!2 RTf  04/01 1012  TESTERS REPORT PROBLEMS WITH WINDOWS TP BETA
 
   NEW YORK, Apr 1, Reuter - Microsoft's new Windows TP has a long way
to go before final release, say beta testers of the product.
   Testers report numerous problems with the thought icons included
with the product.
   "I can see a fish tail representing some useful things, but the
Program Manager? It's just not intuitive," says Clyde Revlon, an MIS
specialist with McBalmy, Crain, and Larch. "Whoever came up with these
thought icons needs therapy. I'm sure the guy's Yorkshire terrier is
wonderful, but as the File Manager? A golden retriever I could
understand. And that sweater the terrier is wearing, it's just too
loud. Let me control the sweater."
   Testers also report dangerous corruption problems with the Direct
Neuron Access technology. "Colors, I smell colors. Dog, good dog, go
to the light mom," said Maggie Ferreaux, a consultant with Sharp,
Trenchant, and Blunt Computer Services.
   Other testers were less understanding. "I'm working on a
presentation, and suddenly all I can think about is pages A through
C of the Miami telephone directory. It took me three hours to get it
out of my mind. That blows my productivity right out of the water,"
says Max Pirenich, a salesman for Carp Technology. "Just thinking about
Excel scares the crap out of me."
   Microsoft officials acknowledged the issues, citing that no beta
release of a product is perfect, and vowed to provide testers with
the services of the same Neurologist that helped Microsoft Quality
Assurance recover from testing the product in its early stages. Many
Microsoft QA engineers are expected to lead long, productive lives.

Over the holidays I heard a similar story - that there was new (?) research

Maybe this is the posted monkey research?

This was from my chemist friend who has always dismissed other rumors and
research results.  

Anyway, I would imagine any published book to be fairly out of date.  Does
any one have any real news on current research?  (without getting too far 
away from our otherwise highly focused rave discussions) ;)

Apologies for the vague references - I don't wish to start bad rumors
I am just asking if anyone knows of new, published(?) work and any criticism
of that work.

Barring any previous medical condition to which stimulants are a risk, 
larger and larger doses are not so much *dangerous* as they are 
*unpleasant*. After two or so, the stimulant effect starts to overshadow 
the enactogenic effects. Hard to feel much empathy when your teeth are 
clattering and your sweating bullets. That's why it isn't considered an 
addictive drug. The more you take, the worse it gets. The fine line is 
between enactogen and stimulant. It varies from person to person but 
usually ends up around the dose you mentioned above. Anything higher and 
you usually just end up chewing a hole through your cheek <grin>. JMAR.

He is the one who is doing research on human subjects with MDMA
probably is the most relavent research out there.

But its not too far along considering he just got subjects.

And he might not even give a damn about effects on the brain

I agree, but PULLLLEASE stop using that term. The automobile mentality is
the _wrong_ way of thinking about interactive TV. And if I hear the phrase
"roadkill on the information superhighway" again, I'm going to order buicks
over the porceline telephone. You don't interact with other people when
you're locked in a metal box. Interactive TV is most interesting when used
for peer to peer communication, like the telephone. Who but a luddite would
say "kill your telephone"? Computers and TV's and phones are all going
to merge into a small fast and cool box, and it's not going to be anything
like an automobile.

In case you people don't know, low serotonin levels are responsible for
depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, suicide, eating disorders, etc.
 Violent behavior is also a result from screwing with these fragile
receptors.  So look before you leap.  If you already have low serotonin
levels, prolonged use of extasy could exacerbate your problem.
Finally, ANY drug can be psychologically addictive.  Beware how casual you
treat this facet of addiction because psychological addiction can be just
as powerful as physical addiction.

Well, you know there *was* France in the 1790's, Russia in the 1910's,
Germany briefly in the 1840's, Berkeley in '64, Paris in '68, Eastern
Europe in '89, etc. etc.

Every once in a while people DO become directly empowered...  The 1890's and 
1900's saw the rise of a powerful US progressive movement; the development of
Hearst-style yellow journalism and Spanish-American war jingoism was the
response that ultimately put the people back in their place...   But things
like the 40-hour work week or the end of the Vietnam war would never have
happened if not for the active involvement of huge numbers of ordinary 
but involved people.

Depends on how you define 'informed'.  We get oceans of carefully crafted 
"facts" from CNN, etc. but very little context with which to make sense of them.

OK, you're an optimist.  Now can I call you a taxi?  =)

(You see, my Marxism *is* of the Groucho variety! =)

It's the rare few who have the time, energy and perceptivity get a picture
of the world different from that of the propaganda machine -- consume and
don't ask questions.  Of course, we being on the Internet and especially
living in the Bay Area (not to mention being ravers) see things differently
but go to something like a sports bar in Pacifica sometime (like I did
during the baseball playoffs) and see what's really up with the American
psyche.  Or go up to Eureka and hang out with some loggers.  You'd be
amazed what a tiny minority we are.

This is a straw man argument -- never did I say things were necessarily
that much better in the past.  But at certain times before the turn of the
century in the US (and today in Europe) people were much more "in the loop"
with the political process than they are here and now.  And, I'm sorry, but
there's a world of difference between Maury Povich (or even Ted Koppel)
and Edward R. Murrow.

Some people want things like the Internet, but many more would be satisfied
with dozens of channels of interactive home shopping and Oprah and the latest
Schwartzenegger movie on demand.  Look in the business sections at what
kind of money companies like QVC, Paramount, Time-Warner, etc. are marshalling
to try to impose their view of the future on us.  The jury is out, but
we can influence the future with some effort and organization (no, I'm
not at all completely pessimistic...plus if anything I side with the
phone companies...)

I guess everyone has had their best visual moments...mine happened at the
FIRST Wax (A Preston production).  Man, he had a MULTI-COLORED laser, with
blue, green, white, and red, GOING OFF!!!  He also had the Archie Bell
dancers. Man, that party was the SHIT!

Visually-The Archie Bell dancers were good to go (the female dancer was
unvbelievable. Now, if there were a tape of *just* her....).  They had the
proper dress which made good use of BOTH the laser light, and the other
lights that were around (of course Erik Lutz was working the intellabeams
[a TRUE master at work]).  Along with that, and the laser making all kinds
of shapes/spaces with the smoke, and with the vibe of all 500 in
attendance, that party was THE one that night (March '92).  The music was
good too ;)

As a matter of fact, I can hardly think of any other light show that was so
intense.  There have been other good light shows though, like the one at
the first Malachy Benefit I and John mentioned,  the last 2 Toon Towns,
Liquid Palace.  All of these places had the shit for visuals (I am talking
ALL OUT visuals with video/lasers/oil/slides).  These were the best that
the massives had to offer....oh yeah, another good show was the  first Let
Freedom Rave (I know that when those 3d lasers hit the side of that
mountain, and that E starting kickin in, I was done for!).  But nothing has
come close since.

Sometimes I miss the mega-non-LA-productions, if for nothing else but for
the visuals.

John

 Proud to say that I helped organize this one.  It was Harmony.  Shows 
how if a rave gets fucked up and you stick with it trying to make it work 
it could turn out to be one of the best things going on.  It was supposed 
to be on a beach but the wonderful police didn't think this was 
appropriate so we went to the parking lot at Denny's in Santa Cruz.  Then 
someone offered us the use of their land.  Carlos who was the only "big 
name" DJ that we had really commandeered was supposed to go to Nectar but 
instead stayed with us.  We got set up around 3 or 4am with Carlos 
spinning a very energetic set and the people just going wild.  It was 
definetely in the Top 5 list of best raves I've ever been to.  Truthfully 
I lost $200 dollars but ended up not giving a shit at all because I was 
so happy to be happy and see everyone happy.  I don't think I saw anyone 
that wasn't having a good time.

I think a name like the Gathering is perfect.  I think that the Gathering 
just shouldn't do stupid things like saying this is there last party.  As 
for changing to something like The Gathering II, I think this would be 
even more cheesy.  Starting to have sequels to good raves?  If the name 
fits a double meaning I think its ok to keep it.  The Gathering, Basics, 
Harmony, Organic, etc.  these names don't just mean  a rave to me they 
have a deeper meaning, whereas raves with names like Romper Room and 
Where the Wild Things Are don't necessarily mena much except stolen 
(borrowed) ideas. A gathering of people, a gathering of ideas, a gathering 
of love, a gathering to dance...

P.S.  I'm always pretty sure when I hear Gathering that the event is 
going to be good. Everything above is IMHO .

But it *IS* the way it will end up.  The best services will go to the
highest bidder or who ever can pay.  This 500 channels of bullshit bothers
me.  Yeah, all this information.  From whom?  From you?  Are you
originating *ANY* of the services?  Will it allow you to encrypt messages
so that you can send truly private transmissions?  What will be the *real*
level of interactvitiy, if you cannot freely navigate through a medium.
That's why TV is attached to the word Interactive.  Just like TV, you will
be able to not only SEE commercials, but buy from them (this has been one
of the most focused on aspects of ITV).  Big deal.

All of that programming will STILL be brought to you by Coke, Pepsi, Bud,
Phillip Morris, Nabisco, whoever.  And they will justify this by saying
that there is not enough money to maintain such a highway without massive
revenues/budget.  So here comes another hand for the taxes.

Naw. I'm not buying into this thing unless they can ensure that I have
*access* to it.  To be able to, er uh, jack-in.  To be able to control
*completely* how I use it.  And most of all to be able to turn it off so a
signal is not attached to my home.  And most of all, it should be *really*
fucking cheap since *everyone* will have it.

If it can't do that, then it's just another intrusion.

No the big thing here Don is privacy.  I just don't think ITV has enough of
it.  It DOES however have NUMEROUS features built in for tracking data,
like what you watch, the time.  Hell the bandwidth is high enough for every
dwelling in America (using fiber otics).  I just want to be able to turn it
off when I don't need it, and turn off the tracking (I'm not a Neilsen
Household).

Announcing the p'airfect rave (c) shite, inc :)

Greetings, Ravers young and old alike! For this once-in-a-lifetime event,
  you'll be presented with your airline tickets, whether you be in
    SF, LA, or Seattle.  All aircraft depart promptly at midnight, so
      be on time, and bring yer warm-weather gear (hint!)

Each of our sumptious Boeing 747's has had it's interior gutted of the
  dreary seats you are accustomed to seeing, and has been outfitted
    instead with beanbag chairs (w/ seatbelts, de rigeur!), swinging
      chairs hung from the ceiling (great during turbulence!) and, of
        course, lotsa lounge seating for those who want to conserve
          energy for the main party.  The dome lounge has been converted
            to an ambient/trance area, and the main lower floor is
              divided up into soundproof areas, with the fastest BPM
                being in the center area (most structurally sound :)

After 8 hours of flight/raving, the party should be warmed up (did I mention
  the nitrous/oxygen mix in the air system?)

As the planes begin to descend to their destination, the sun will be just
  coming up, and you will find your eyes blessed with the beautiful lagoons
    of Bora Bora, in French Polynesia, 4000 miles from traffic, air pollution,
      and crowds, with nothing between you and nature but yer skivvies. No
        problem landing on the outer reef, since it was built to handle
          large military aircraft.  After taking the boat from the outer
            reef to the main island (where we have graciously chartered 
              the local Club Med village for those sleepyheads who need
                their batteries charged), you will find your party-boats
                  ready.

The main event will take place on a 2 acre coral islet, known as Motu Tapu,
  once the playground for Tahitian Royalty hundreds of years ago.  This
    little island is surrounded by blindingly white sand and waters of
      every shade of azure your mind can picture.  The sound system has
        already been airlifted in, and is cleverly concealed amongst the
          palm trees, so no electronic equipment is visible whatsoever.
  For those of you who like to snorkel and sample the irridescent fishes
    and reef animals, we've hooked up a radio/sonar underwater transmission
      system, complete with special underwater headphones designed to
        receive these frequencies.

Towards sunset, the locals (Tahitians INVENTED the all-night party) will
  start to arrive, complete with all sorts of interesting things they
    have grown up in the jungles of the island, and the sunlight will
      cast a yellow glow on the 4,000 foot jagged mountain in the center
        of the island, a mountain so steep no one has ever climbed it.

The clouds will part as they go around the island, the rain will be drawn
  to the mountain, and the dolphins will begin to breach all around in
    the laggon (did I mention the free shark-rides, courtesy of the
      locals from Rangiroa?)

Yes, all this and more can be yours if you all get together and pool yer
  resources!  Towards midnite, as the incredibly intense southern stars
    come up, we'll light up the lagoon with some special halides we 
      brought in just for this occasion, and you will witness the wonder
        of a coral reef in full bloom, you will have fun feeding moray
          eels (quite friendly when stuffed with food), and don't forget
            the whale watch outside the reef (if the sea isn't too choppy)

After 4 days of tropical hedonism, the flights will depart back for the
  US (yup, we'll have to drag you kicking and screaming). Not to worry,
    we'll up the nitrous mix in the air coming back.

so, any takers :)

seems to me tanya is on track, though i would prefer to say "have been  
associated in some individuals with" rather than "are responsible for".   
researchers find a very wide range of serotonin metabolite levels in "normal"  
humans - low serotonin levels are not by themselves indicative of any  
disorder.

one study (Ricaurte & McCann) found that there was an average (with high  
variability) of 30% lower levels of a serotonin metabolite in the  
cerebrospinal fluid of a group of MDMA users (averaging some 75 MDMA sessions  
each) compared with a control group of non-MDMA-users.  the only functional  
differences noted between the two groups was that the MDMA users "reported  
less impulsive and hostile personality traits, and general constraint and  
control."

for a lucid description of the wonders of the serotonin system, see  
*Listening to Prozac* by Peter D. Kramer (Viking 1993).  the entire book is  
worthwhile, but note pages 134-136 especially.

for those who are concerned about the possibility of serotonin level or  
serotonin system changes in humans with therapeutic doses of MDMA, some  
researchers reckon changes can be lessened or prevented by taking  
antioxidants.  In an article titled "Phenethylamines, Free Radicals, and  
Antioxidants" (MAPS Newsletter, Volume IV Number 1), author Brian Leibovitz  
suggests in Table 1 taking as a preventive measure the following:  5 mg  
B-Carotene; 2 grams Bioflavonoids; 100 mg Coenzyme Q10; 2-4 grams L-Ascorbic  
acid; 1 gram L-Carnitine; 2 grams N-Acetylcysteine (NAC); 250 ug Selenium,  
and 1,000 IU Vitamin E.  "There is nothing magic about the doses listed; it  
is my best estimate based on present knowledge in nutrition."  i would add  
that if you don't feel like buying out the local vitamin store, taking a  
subset of these (even just the vitamin C) could well be helpful.

and, if you're really concerned, recent non-human animal research suggests  
that most or all of the serotonin system changes may be prevented by taking  
Prozac (fluoxetine) 0-6 hours after taking the MDMA (see McCann and Ricuarte  
in J. Clinical Psychopharmacology, 13 (3):pp. 214-217, 1993).  one might  
speculate that other SSRI drugs (Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Paxil) may work too.   
note, however, that some people report that Prozac taken before or in the  
first portion of an MDMA session lessens some of the desirable effects of the  
MDMA.

my synthesis of all this information is that there are a great many questions  
unanswered by research as yet - thus it's prudent to figure that the risk of  
some kind of subtle neurological "damage" in humans from MDMA use is not  
zero.  yet there is no emperical evidence of "damage" in humans (and there is  
considerable evidence of benefits) - this in many years of legal use (before  
1986 in the US), and quite widespread illegal use since then.

given a non-zero risk, it makes sense to examine the benefit side, and take  
the drug only when you expect to get some tangible positive outcome from it  
that you feel makes taking the risk worthwhile.

you could have been more effective if you had been out in the streets

american to watch safely from their television at some horror in the world,
as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the evils of TV, it makes us spectators

    massives:

    the perfect rave would feel like safe sanctuary where people
    can do the things people do at raves without worrying about
    being busted/hassled.  the perfect rave would have many options
    of music slow/fast loud/soft and some inbetween.  a live act
    near the middle.  the sound system must not be over the top
    causing distortion.  there should be no displeasure zones of
    sound.

    eye candy visuals are a must, hopefully something that builds
    and changes and isn't just loops.

    some kind of ceremony to tie it all together...some kind of
    empowering theme.

    local djs to warm things up, known miracle workers to do the
    climax then go free style after that.  live techno/new djs/old
    djs whatever fits the situation.  rave compatible entertainment
    happening simultaneously.

    a place where people could talk would be nice too.  maybe an
    area to dispense info/enlightenment on issues near and dear to
    the community.

    renegades/outdoors:

    the perfect rave would be fairly small, 200 tops.  sanctuary
    applies here too.  but the format is extremely low key.  the
    only other requirement here is a descent mobile sound system
    and great djs.  being outdoors provides the visuals if the
    site is right.

    the single most important ingredient for any rave is positive people
    who want to party

Status: 


Several people have told me that for a few nights after taking X they've
experienced more vivid dreams than usual and that they remember their
dreams in greater detail.  (These two phenomena are probably related, of
course...)  I've personally experienced much greater sensitivity (?) or
awareness to other people's emotions, body language, whatever for maybe
a week or so after the initial fun wore off.  One person I know says he's
experienced psychic episodes afterwards, while another friend told me it
cured her of a depression that had been crippling her mood for weeks.  

It's hard to separate out the effects of the drug from the effects of the
fun events experienced while under its influence, of course.  i'm usually
in a great mood for days after a rave, regardless of my substance intake!
But the effect on people's dreams seems to be a fairly dependable effect.

Does anyone else have any thoughts on this?

he's dragging subjects through countless blood tests, overnight sleep EEG

    on dreaming:

    i have experienced this effect too but with off-the-shelf amino-acids
    taken just before bedtime - more vivid, remembered dreams.  i too
    experience greater sensitivity to people and communication for about
    one week after e/rave.

    on being happy:

    has anybody done any studies that map the effects of being happy on the
    brain?  maybe all these physical changes that happen in the brain from
    taking e also happen when u ride a roller coaster or hear a good joke
    and laugh you head off.  im not trying to belittle the subject but
    isn't it obvious that a change in behaviour (good or bad) has a physical
    change in the brain associated with it?
        isn't learning changing the bioelectric pathways in your brain?

	I am not a DJ. Nor do I have any desire to do normal DJ activities.
	What I am is a sound engineer. I work for very very high end

	sound equipment.

	story:
	I have many sources of sound in my room. I have cd players,
	a rack of electronic music gear, a radio, and a pink noise
	generator to use for sleeping. I have long searched for a simple
	elegant solution to mix and switch between all of these. The solution
	would have be useable in the dark and in non-sober states. It would
	have to sound good, be durable, work at consumer audio levels (-10db
	max), and be eventually rack mountable.
	I own a Mackie mixer but its life really lies in mixing instruments,
	not stereo line level sources although it does very well at that.
	I usually don't purchase normal consumer gear but I have been
	desperate for a solution to my mixing problem.

	result:
	Eventually I realized the answer to my problems was perfectly
	presented: a Numark DM1175 mixer. You can get them at Uncle
	Ralphs DJ supply on Telegraph near Amoeba.

	features: 4 stereo line ins with separate sliders. Mic in.
		  2 path xfader which fades between two of the 
		    line channels (which means you can use it for Quad!)
		  5 band stereo eq with a +15 db gain/cut. 
		  several other minor switching
		  cueing
		  meters
		  $300 out the door.

	praises: its very elegant, sounds great, and fits right on top
		 of my rack of electronic music gear. the EQ could
		 easily smash a sound system. the meters are big.
		 it operates at -10db nominal which is perfect if you
		 assume highs will reach 4db.

	criticisms: its noisy. really noisy. all switches make a "pop"
		    when activating/deactivating them. it has 60hz hum
	 	    everywhere but i haven't tried grounding the case
		    yet.

	I'll eventually use it for mixing music but until then its the

There has been some talk of the Perfect rave, and I was just thinking that
instead of talking about it, we should just make it happen.  I am not talking
about throwing a party, which is great, but I mean, just go to some party, say,
I dunno, okay, The Gathering (which will go off) and just use all your ideas
(and they are nice) and push this party to the limit.  The park this Saturday
was the perfect warmup for me--I haven't danced continually like that in
months, and I am pretty certain it was because it was outside, sunny, and I was
stone cold sober.  The Gathering may (I hope not!) not be outside, and it
probably won't be sunny, but I know that it's going to rock..

Subject: Recent MDMA research info
Status: 

I pulled this up from Biosis, a database at stanford similar to Medline,
for those of you who are interested.  If you want to search yourself, use
"
"f kw mdma and serotonin" or something like that.

I think that the take-home lesson from the study below is that it doesn't
take 20x the recreational dose of mdma to possibly mess you up.  But,
all these studies are done under unrealistic conditions.  (I.E. if you drank
2 12-packs of beer twice a day for four days, your liver would be damaged
and you might be dead.)  Many things are toxic at levels not too high
above what we normally take them at.  (Fugu, sodium pentothol, alcohol,
nicotine, etc.)

Anyway, here's the abstract!

TITLE:           Oral administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
                   (MDMA) produces selective serotonergic depletion in the
                   nonhuman primate.

LANGUAGE:        English
ABSTRACT:  MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) has been reported to
   produce serotonergic depletion in nonhuman primates at doses as low as 2.5
   mg/kg (1-2 times the typical human dose). The current study evaluated the
   dose-response relationships of MDMA (1.25-20.0 mg/kg) using regional
   concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
   acid (5-HIAA), and home cage behavior as endpoints. Adult female rhesus
   monkeys (n = 16) were treated orally with 0, 1.25, 2.5, or 20.0 mg/kg MDMA
   twice daily for 4 consecutive days. Eighteen behaviors were measured in the
   home cage prior to, during, and after MDMA treatment. One month after the
   last dose, the animals were sacrificed and brains dissected into several
   regions for neurochemical analyses. 5-HT and 5-HIAA were analyzed via
   HPLC/EC. The lower doses of MDMA (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) did not significantly
   alter 5-HT or 5-HIAA concentrations in any brain region except hippocampus
   in which 5-HT concentrations were decreased after 2.5 mg/kg. MDMA at 20.0
   mg/kg significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in several
   cortical and midbrain structures. However, 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in
   brain stem and hypothalamus were not significantly altered after any dose of
   MDMA. Combined with previous data from this laboratory, these results
   indicate that the decreased concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in selected
   brain regions show a selective dose-response relationship for MDMA-induced
   neurotoxicity as measured by  serotonergic depletion in the nonhuman
   primate.

Speaking of Ted Koppel...

"The news is the 15 minutes of fill time between commercials."  This
was said by someone (a news anchor person I believe) in an
interview with Koppel.  He went on to say something about keeping
news interesting so people will stay tuned for the commercials.

It seems that they didn't succeed in keeping the news interesting,
now there's only 5 minutes between commercials. :)

If you didn't already know what the news is really for...

Subject: Anonymous mail service up for alpha testing
Status: 

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

	I've written a small anonymous mail service, and it's now
available for testing. There's no security, and I'll be keeping logs,
so don't think that it's secure, in any way. It's also running on a
PPP link which isn't connected all the time, so it's rather flaky.
	(I'll set it up as a real service once I get a real link-- if
anyone else wants to do it, they're welcome to use my code.)

	How to get an anonymous account:

	Send mail to admin@infinity.hip.berkeley.edu -- include in the
message a login, a "Full Name", a choice of remailer, and an encrypted
return address block encrypted with that remailer's public key.
	I'll set it up.

	How the anonymous account works:

	Someone will send mail to
login@infinity.hip.berkeley.edu. Then the system looks up in a table
which remailer is associated with that login. It then sends out mail
to that remailer, starting with the contents of the encrypted return
address block, then a "##" and then all of the message to
login@infinity, with "Received" lines taken out.

	Thus once the message gets to the last remailer of the chain
in the encrypted return block, the ## pasts the identifying
information of the person mailing to login@infinity.hip in the header
of the message. (It *should* do that...) If the person mailing to the
infinity address would like anonymity he/she should use an anon-mailer
on his/her end.

The encrypted-return address you send me should look like:

::
Encrypted: PGP

- -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
etc.

	Make sure you include that ::/Encrypted or the remailer which
gets it won't know that it's PGP encrypted.

	Remember, this is just setup for testing. Don't use it for
real applications.

Perfect rave
============
Mike Romo Says...

RIGHT ON!!

For me,  a perfect rave would be an outside rave,   preferrably a
meadow in the woods,  weather fairly cool.    With camping areas out
in the remote fringes far enough away from the music to make talking
easier.

The closest thing that came to a perfect rave was "Penalepes Web"
held way up in the hicks near Willits,  at a remota farm which had
beautiful gardens,   a mud pool,  plenty of water,  and a swimming
hole fairly close.   The next perfect rave was LoveStock held out
near Modesto at a fishing camp along the San Juaquin (Or was it the
Sacramento) river.  Multi-color lights along the banks of the river
was making some awsome visuals that lit up the fog setting on the
river at night.  Pieces of tree branches in the river had added an 
eery feeling to the scene.

I attended a number of outside raves,  with some having multiple dance
areas,  but to make the rave a perfect one,  I would want to have at
least one dance area play hardcore or hard acid trance.   Yow!!  Super
fast acid trace in the woods.... Now THATS! utopia...

The same wako friend warned me against spending too much time trying to
reachieve peak experiences... which i think is sort of good advice to ravers
since we sort of live for peak experiences.. but there will always be some that
can't be redone... so, as i keep saying, don't fergit that a major draw at

having said that, i'd love to get my hands on some of these videos..especilly

MAD DAWG SUPER SPEW BUBBLE CHEW!
"The Gum That Does Colorful Tricks In Your Mouth!"

DIRECTIONS FOR THE MAXIMUM MAD DOG SPEW (*):

The MAD DOG "Spew" experience is only limited to your own creativity. 

1) Unwrap MAD DAWG... they don't chew very well with the wrapper, and this
   seriously retards the "Spew".
2) Place MAD DAWG on your tongue.
3) Do not suck MAD DAWG, chew promptly, but slowly.
4) Allow saliva to accumulate in your mouth while chewing.
5) Do not swallow for 10 seconds or more. 
6) To maximize "Spew", swish it around (like mouth wash, but do not attempt
   to gargle.
7) Depending on your personality and the people you are with while "Spew"ing,
   you may choose to do one or more of the following:
  A) Open your mouth to exhibit "Spew".
  B) Allow "Spew" to run down your chin.
  C) Float "Spew" on lips.
  D) Place both hands on your cheeks and push forcefully. (this option is not
     highly recommended). 
8) Swallow "Spew" and chew the bubble gum.

MAD DAWG "SPEW"ing ETIQUETTE:

1) Warning. Chewing multiple pieces of MAD DAWG may cause "Spew" to overflow
   from nostril cavities.
2) Do not attempt to talk while "Spew"ing. 
3) Share the "Spew"ing experience, give a MAD DAWG to a friend.
4) If you feel you must spit "Spew", be discrete. 

* "Spew" is the fizzy, frothy, foamy, colorful stuff that the MAD DAWG does
in your mouth.

INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, DEXTROSE, GUM BASE, CORN SYRUP, CITRIC ACID, MALIC ACID,
SODIUM BICARBONATE, MODIFIED FOOD STARCH, NATURAL & ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS, 
SOFTENERS, RESINOUS GLAZE, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (INCLUDES YELLOW #5 AND YELLOW #6,
RED #3, RED #40, BLUE #1), BHT (TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS). 

Aaaah, nothing like a *_FRESH_* MAD DAWG SPEW to kick off the day with
RESINOUS GLAZE!

	Well, for some of the newbies out there, if you

	experience, consider Come/Unity.  This is a legendary 
	party, the vibe has always been strong and it has
	consistantly "gone off" ever since I can remember,
