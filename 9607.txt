If anyone has a crack for this CD, you'd be the bomb.  I think if I 
remember correctly, PWA or someone put out a crack for it, but I haven't 
been able to find it anywhere...  It's got 2,100 fonts, including that 
Chemical Bros. (Sho) font, so someone pleez pleez pleez get it... <beg>

Hi all, it's Nancy here reporting from my friend Josh's account on the 
events of Friday night.  Only Friday night, because the rest of the 
weekend was spent recuperating! ;)  Lazy days drenched in sunshine are a 
great antitode to outrageous partying... 

Friday night - One Track Mind
We headed out to this little, Mission district, $5 party after hearing 
the depressing news about Meridian.  None of us felt like driving over an 
hour to spend a night at the beach - and from what I heard from friends 
later, that was a good thing!  Too bad about all the mishaps of the night 
for Meridian.  Hopefully next time the space will be secure and the party 
will go off!

So we faced the prospects of Fusion (spare $20, anyone?), Out-a-Sight (no 
directions at 11PM - thought this was a guaranteed weekly?), Nikita (for 
the clubby thang - and of course, Derrick May), or the small unknown, One 
Track Mind.

$5 seemed a safe gamble, and I'm always curious to check out a new 
party.  By midnight we had found the industrial space in a south Mission 
area.  Good location for a medium-size party!!  (Heads up, F&F!!).  
Oblong warehouse that could fit several hundred people.  Unfortunately 
for One Track Mind, only about 100 had ventured to their party.  

I was impressed with what they had furnished for just five bucks.  A 
large screen flashed graphics, decent sound system, free water flowed, 
in-and-out privileges, and a chill area with couches and some artwork 
(somebody's living space, maybe?).

Jon Santos (the biggest name in the line-up) was spinning.  Billed 
"Detroit Techno and Chicago House" night, hardcore crashed through the 
air, sounding much like dueling blenders.  Not my taste.  Some people 
tried to dance, but the feeling wasn't there.  The chill area - featuring 
"improvisational" ambient - wasn't any more musically inviting.  We (minus 
KaySEE, who opted for a good conversation and a mellow night) wanted to 
GO OFF, and headed out to 1015 to hopefully catch the legend, Derrick May.

Nikita

The Club - unbelievable sound system pounding, blinding lazer overkill, 
stocked bars pouring, club crowd preening.  Nikita is like sensory overload 
after any rave.  I observed the suburban crowd with the women in heels 
and the drunk men and grew petulant - why do THEY get the killer space 
and sound and lights and the underground has to scrounge?  We hide out in 
dirty warehouses and get excited over a simple lazer, while in clubland 
overstuffed couches and openair balconies and amazing light shows are 
wasted on the cruisers.

The weird thing about Nikita is, after 2AM it's a totally different 
experience.  Until the bars close, you have your mainstream crowd (and 
the crowd at Nikita gets more mainstream every week - two months ago I 
swear it was a different scene).  But after 2, the real dancers come out, 
getting down to the music and not at all interested in clubby attitude. By 
5AM, it's just the groovers, with everyone there absorbed in the 
same feeling.  At that moment, the connection is close to the rave 
experience.  The music has transported us to the same level, creating the 
collective experience that is at the heart of the best rave experiences.  
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

First things first - Derrick May is THE MAN!! See him the next time he is 
in town, because this is one legend who deserves it.  I was worried that 
he'd be too old-school, that his legendary status derived from his place 
as an originator of techno dance, rather than any current relevance.  But 
this guy can still rock the house!!  His fifteen years of spinning was 
reflected in an arsenal of records - his set weaved everything from 
pophouse to trance to hardcore techno and back, throwing in bits and 
fragments of sounds and voice and samples to create a totally danceable 
mishmash of sound.  He spun incredibly for two-and-a-half hours.

Simon came on after, spinning better than he has for quite a while.  Two 
hours of throbbing trance that held the crowd like a spell.  My favorite 
kind of dance music. :) :)  Many people stayed until the end came at dawn.  
(And probably, like us, had to face an hour delay on the Bridge).  But we 
did get to see the sun break through the clouds over the bay in the 
morning - intensely beautiful.

One thing: I was handed an invite to get in free next week, as was my 
friend Marnie.  On it (I don't have it in front of me), it said something 
like, "you are invited because of your happy smile.  We want positivity 
only!"  and made me think that the people throwing Nikita want the 
dancelovers and the good vibe to come.  I suddenly saw them bummed out by 
the mainstreaming of their club (although they probably don't mind 
the massive dollars generated!), and trying to get another sort of crowd to come to their party.  ??  

The club elements can be a downer, but as I was saying earlier, after 
the drinkers leave, and with a good dj, 1015 has potential.  During Simon's 
set I felt close to everyone in that room, and although funny hats and 
presents would have felt inappropriate, the connection that heartfelt 
dance brings was starting.  It was not the same total acceptance the rave 
atmosphere sometimes brings, but Friday night I realized that the venue 
or the legality or the fact of "club vs. rave" becomes immaterial.  We 
can bond through dance, regardless of location or promoter or purist ideals.

When I began raving I would go to any party, just 'cause it was a 
"rave."  I thought the fact that it was a rave was enough to bring the 
community and the soul-lifting experience of dance.  As I've gotten more 
into it, I've realized that the music creates the experience.  At One 
Track Mind, "bad" music created a mediocre vibe.  At the club, 
unbelievable sound united everyone into a single groove.  

I often wonder what's at the origin - people or the music?  Is a good crowd enough to 
generate a feeling or is good music the catalyst to bring the people 
together into a shared experience?  "Raving" (meaning, to me, a certain 
experience) takes the people, too - sharing their love and openness and 
positivity.  The crowd is critical to the highest experience.  But dance 
is universal, perhaps creating the connection that allows people to then 
open up, and create an even higher level of connection.

I just know that now I choose parties (whether rave or club) based on the 
music, because I know the experience will follow...

This post is long enough!  Good-bye everyone - have a beautiful, short, 
3-day workweek (isn't it wonderful?!)

Love, Nancy

Damn! I had a great time this weekend..Mars set at Space Teddy was awesome.
I think I left my body on that one..Sunset boat party.. My first one, only
due to having to get up at 4:30am for work on Monday. This was great, I've
been on many boats, ships and what not, but this was great.  I was just
having a hard time choosing what deck to stay on..Well I'm sooo tired right
now, got to bed at 1:30 and up at 4:30 so I think it's time to close my
eyes and take a snooze before I actually have to do work here.


And to think I almost didn't go out this weekend.

HI!!  Happy HOT Monday to Everyone.  Hope your weekend was swell!

For the time being, I've switch back to my old confusing Quickmail Email Address (mark_camp*@quickmail.apple.com) because Claris Emailer SUCKS!  Apple is in the proccess of loosing Quickmail and switching over to Claris Emailer and while they are doing this, the Emailer servers keep going caputz (SP?).  And I never receive any messages.  

SO, once again, if anyone has tried sending me anything over the past coupla days, I didnt receive it. Please send it to: 

mark_camp*@quickmail.apple.com.

Thanxs!! This concludes my Monday Morning Grip Session

Looking Forward to the FOUR DAY WEEKEND!!!!,


-M

If anyone's interested I have a Tascam 48 Analog 8 track tape deck(DBX) 
and a large 4' x 3' Tascam 24 input ( 2 phono even ) 8 bus out mixer that
I'd like to sell. I'm looking to get $1500 for the deck and $1000 for the 
mixer. These are very nice units with boxes ( I can help deliver ), 
manuals and look like new ie very few if any blimishes... the deck has 
less than 200 hours use so the heads are like new.... The mixer is a full
studio mixer with meter bridge, lots of inputs & outputs etc but is too
large for small time live use ( unless you are the Orb )....

I'm only selling these because I do only electronic stuff that uses MIDI
and so I just don't use their capabilities - so I'm looking to simplify
my studio....

E-mail me if you have any interest.

Mike

Hi all- I haven't posted in days because I don't really have a place and 
I've been couch surfing for about two weeks now- I really really really 
missed the vibe I get from all of you- wow, do I ever need some positive 
energy sent my way!!!!  I'm stressed and broke, but I've still got a 
smile on my face and I know that I'll make it- I just didn't want any of 
you to think I fell off the face of the earth...  Hopefully I'll make it 
to a party soon.

Love,
jessica

Well, well, well....


I really hope you all can handle these next 3 or 4 days...

I had fun in the woods, however, the Harmony party "pulled" me out of my
outback contemplation to do some serious  dancing...

So much for a "raveless weekend"....

Had fun, shared smiles, did some serious damage to the beach (dancing my own
pit, one could say) and can't wait till Wendsday...

-C/U Wensday night.

-Pacbowl Thursday (DJ Demigod - Gabber/Hardcore)

-Light from Friday till Sunday

Talk about a Full Plate!!!


"dance with me..."

Hey Everyone.

If you're near the Cats Bar tonight in SF (or if you're not) come check out a super cool band called Soulstice.  I've had the pleasure of listening to them every day for the past two weeks (thanks to my roommate, the man, Mei-Lwun Yee) who does some kick-ass scratching to live hop-hop-funk-acid jazz-rap and even some jungle beats with a lovely female singa.

Show starts at 10 or 9 or something like that.  So come on out, I'll by you a drink!  Really, I will!

Fo mo info, and a little sampling of the Soulstice sound,  call the BCE info line @ 415 607 2290

peace,
-M

Oh Jeez,
I didn't realize it was this Dave.  The steamboat was the tip off.  
I got the privledge of meeting him at his beautiful berkeley home once 
back in '93 after a Basics party at the Armory.

Although I never got to really know him, I could tell the instant I met 
him what a special and wonderful person he was.  I was always glad to see 
him with his cute little hat and glitter around his smiling eyes.  

My thoughts are with him and all who knew him.

love,
Amy

I have a great, albeit second-hand, story about Nancy and Derrick May.  
Another friend of mine witnessed the following interaction between Nancy 
and Derrick May.  (Nancy, I hope I don't embarrass you, but this story is 
too cute to pass up!!)  Anyway, my friend sees Nancy go up to Derrick May 
before he starts to spin and starts talking to him.  Of course, he is 
very curious as to the interaction that has occured, so he asks Nancy 
what they talked about.  Nancy replies, "Oh I just told him to really go 
off and show us what a bad-ass he really is!"  I can just see her doing 
this!!  My friend thought it was pretty cool because then Derrick May 
would know that he was appreciated out here in SF.  So, if his set had 
even a bit more pizzazz then usual, maybe it was due to your fellow 
sfraver!!

as it was
only $5. Great evening/night of open air dancing right on the

I think it's gonna be once a month.
Was anyone else there ?

Since, I just purchased my new Rane MP22 mixer, I no longer have a need for
my old one. It is a Gemini PMX2000. I purchased it for $300 over two years

graphic eq for each channel, and 2 mic inputs ( for whatever use that is?).

Hi!

I'm posting this for a friend who doesn't have email access.

He's just moved into a new appartment where his decks are set up in really
close quarters.  These speakers are _way_ too big to have set up 1 foot
away from your ears, so he's looking to get into something smaller (but
doesn't that go against the natural evolution of things?)

Anyhow here's what he's got.  If you're interested, either email me or give
him a call at 759-5604.  His name is Dave.  He's a good guy.  Call -- it'll
be fun!

HI!!! I'm Anastazia5 (creator/editor of a Dallas-based rave newsletter called
SWELL). I will be making a two week trip to San Fran. & L.A. in August in
order to take a break from this ultra-conservative area. I was wondering if
you guys could give me a little scene-related info about the following:

*A few "quality" promoter names/groups:)
*Record shops--especially those with a large selection of Trance/GOA...Dallas
is TOTALLY into the Progressive House/Funky Breaks stuff, so it's harder than
hell to find the records I wanna play here. I'll be bringing an extra, empty
suitcase just to fill up with records:)
*Are there age limits on parties? Dallas usually has a 17+ limit, in the
hopes of avoiding a party-bust by "Bobby Joe the Arrogent Hick Cop"
*Any primo clothing stores...Dallas has ONE (believe it or not) called Moda
that carries a lot of the Mondorama line:)
*I have organized a Sunday night raver-coffee/chat session here in D. Do you
guys have any specific meeting place/time? I'd love to meet some of you
during my trip:)

Any info would be greatly appreciated!

Take Care of Yourself and of Others!!!!!

had a pretty good time last night. met blackadder and shawna for the first
time. got reintroduced to john (burger king) and reintroduced myself to tim
(knucklehead). i now also know who reagan is, even if we weren't introduced..
the weather was absolutely perfect for a boat cruise. nice and warm, but the
bay kept the temperature down to a perfect level.. dancing downstairs, they
had the side doors open and you could look out and see the water rushing by,
as well as feel the cooling breeze. hmmm.. now why can't warehouse parties
have air conditioning like that?
heard some good jungle, and andrew spun a nice ambient/jungle set that was
beautiful to listen to, although very difficult to dance to. however
(warning: house music rant ahead), my evening could have been much better
had there not been so much house music. the music sounded ok if you were
right between the speakers, but if you were back further all you got was a
muddle whoompy bass sound. more treble would have made it much more
enjoyable. i also was unfortunate enough to hear the worst house song i have
ever heard. it had a cheezy bass line and vocals that sounded like they came
straight out of a 2-unlimited rap. ugh!

and on another note: when i was in canada, the funky techno tribe came out
to toronto on tour or something and put on a party with Dose. my question
is: why do no outside production companies from other cities come to SF and
help put on parties?

With much anticipation, we (a group of 7) set off to got to the party.  I 
had been nursing myself back to health from my second cold in two weeks.  
This one hit me out of the blue, but I refused to let it interfere with 
going to the boat party.  There are too few wonderful parties, that I 
didn't want to miss this one.  A little mind over matter goes a long ways....

ONE COMPLAINT:  It ended to soon :(  I was just not ready for it to end 
when it did.  Great time for punctuality, we docked at 11:01 p.m.  I was 
hoping that they would go a bit later.  The time flew by.  Next time, I 
hope it can be a bit longer.  But it was still wonderful, so this is a 
mild complaint.

I got to see some people who I hadn't seen for quite awhile (Shawna, 
Reagan, Black Adder, SDream, Marty) and met a few new people (SDream's 
friend, Julie and sfraver Troy Sheets).  I looked for more sfravers, 
assuming they were there, but didn't find any.  

I spent the entire time running from deck to deck to see the amazing 
views:  sunset underneath the Golden Gate, moon rise over the east bay, 
full moon behind a beautifully lit City, moon light reflecting off of the 
water, clear skies, and more.  

This was the "hang out and bond with your friends" party, which I did 
enforce. It was nice spending some quality time with the people that help 
create the vibe.  Reinforce that love of the scene, and get to know 
people's wonderful individuality. It just reminds me that "the rave" is a 
combination of many things, people being what makes it all happen!!  I 
also appreciated the fact that in this vast world there exists a place 
for my silly, friendly side to show itself.  It is a struggle to keep it 
couped up, but the "regular" world just isn't ready for it in many ways.  
People always have their guard up too much, and spend too much time 
worrying about appearances and acting "grown-up".  It's nice to step into 
that "temoporary autonomous zone" for a bit, and be able to express an 
important part of yourself.  It refreshes my love of living which is easy 
to forget and difficult to remember.


The music didn't move my relaxed body too 
much, but it was beautiful to listen to.  Even heard a Tangerine Dream 
track in there.  My body won't move if the music is (I believe) below 130 
bpm.  I need stuff from Progressive House and on.  Trance rules, 
especially acid trance!  But, this was a different mood and people did 
seem to enjoy themselves.  The "experimental" cabin got in some good 
jungle licks and ambient grooves and the main cabin was pretty much pure 
house from what I remember.

I enjoy listening to house, but when I put my body out on the dance 
floor, I didn't feel the familiar grab.  Usually, I feel this contagious 
sensation under my skin which sends electric pulses to my limbs and makes 
them flail wildly.  Just didn't get there this time, but that was okay.  
I'll just have to feed this little dancing addiction of mine later!

Smooth move Ex-lax aka #1 dumb move of the evening:

I brought my camera and proceeded to take pictures of the party.  Then my 
camera ran out of film.  I had another role in my back pack, but was too 
lazy to go down to the bottom cabin and get it.  Later on, as the sun is 
setting, and we are going under the Golden Gate bridge, I grab my camera 
and take (what I thought) would be some excellent pictures of Jon and 
myself underneath the bridge.  After I left the party, it dawned on me 
that those pictures had occured after I ran out of film, and before I had 
re-loaded the film.  So, I guess those pictures will only be etched in my 
memory.  Can you just say airhead?

signing off,
KaySEE

p.s.  I hope to see some of the pictures that people took.

              ****Shit, goddamn, get off your ass and jam****

	This non-rave related, might be considered blatant self-promotion
	as well, and is actually commercial spam. 
	This said, you can go on, you may find a good deal. :)
	
	My company changed its product line, and wants to get rid of
	a few leftover products: we have a clearance list where you
	can find Unix software/books for half the usual street price.
	Have a look at 
http://www.softway.com/america/prices.htm

	No need to mention my name when ordering, I don't have anything 
	to do with the sales department. :)

I respectfully disagree.  His set left me uninspired.  He may be
"the man"... but not on this night, not in my opinion.  You should 
still check him out though if you never have -- his historical
significance warrants as much.  Rok.

I heard this was supposed to happen in Sacramento.  I was even given the
lowdown on the space.  I went around midnight to see if anyone was there
setting up, cuz that is what time it was supposed to start.  No trace of
anyone, except two shady characters in a pick-up who, when I inquired if
they knew anything about a full moon party said, "full moon party?....I'm up
for a party....where is it supposed to be."   I said, "that's what I'm
trying to figure out"   Then the same guy who just asked me where it was
supposed to be said, "can I get a ride with you, I know where it is."  So I
said, "where."  To which he responded, "right over there up the road"

I drove away without another word.  

At about 12:30 am the directions were still not posted, so......

Did it happen?

Was if big fun? 

What's the story?

Erm, there were some logistical problems (it was to have started at 1am),
but it did happen, albeit not until about 4 or 4:30 am. It was a meadow
somewhere just outside Sacramento, near a bog, which meant thousands of
mosquitos. I played first, but couldn't hardly spin for the mosquito bites
(I counted about 50 this morning - never would've thought they could suck
through two shirts! At least they don't itch much). I had to leave at 5:30
to go back to SF for work, so I don't know how long it lasted. There were
about 30-50 people there when I left.

The moon was utterly exquisite.

The moon was indeed magnificent!  It was said to be at it's fullest at
8:59pm, so I went onto the balcony of the apartment where I live to see.
Incredibly bright.  I opened myself up to receive the energy the beautiful,
silver-white orb was radiating, and perceived a cool (as in temperature)
and substantial energy, unlike anything I've felt before.  It was medium in
intensity.  I let my energy flow with it for a moment, then came back to
myself, breathed deeply, smiled, sighed, and returned indoors.

Yours in lunacy,

>love and positive energy.  Anyone got some to spare?

I'm having an amazing week full of love and light, and even though I've
never met sister Karen, I can empathize with "overwhelmingly bad times".

Hang on, sister.

"Wake now, discover that you are the sun that the morning brings!"

LOVE and HUGS to you!!!!!

Woah, I was about to give her e-mail address to the list, but maybe it's
better to do it this way: if you'd like to send her a message, and don't
have her e-mail addr., let me know, and I'll send it to ya private-like.
OK?

Peace,

Just a quick note on my *Harmony* experience.

I had a great time while it lasted; I had to split early to go to
an engagement party for my brother in Salinas.  Left at about 5:10 pm.

The weather was perfect, the music was just getting good and the vibe just 
starting to happen for me and then I had to go...  :(

Highlights (Good AND Bad)

* The great location/ The hellish trek to bring equipment down to the beach.
* The perfect weather
* The great views- Ocean spray, Natural arch, Naked people...
* The shitty incident with the pit-bull.  Fucked up, man!
* The constant hissing of nitrous tanks.
* Getting to meet John (short hair, blue shorts and white t-shirt, extremely 
friendly), Rob & Jenny (met them at wrong beach.  got to harmony together.  
introduced themselves right away), and Charlie (holder of the sacred 
sunflower), also the girl whose name I don't remember that had the same 
Airwalks as me.  Met her with Charlie? when we were trying to get the 
generator going. Did I get all your names right?  You were the only ones who 
cared enough to act friendly toward me and my wife Patty.  It was a true 
*pleasure* to meet you.  What are your i.d's on the list? So I can match the 
faces with who you are on the list?

Me? I was the half asian, half mexican dude, about 5'8" with the red and 
black beanie that had a yellow happy face on it.  MOst of the time I was 
dancing on the rock in front of the arch.

Wish I could have gotten a laminate.  Damn.  maybe next time.  C'mon... 
people. be a little friendlier.

Despite my pissy mood right now, I had a pretty good time on Saturday.

It was great fun, and I'm glad we got to share it!  Didn't meet as many new
faces as I'd like to have, but sometimes a returned smile is all I need :)
There were more of you I knew than I even got to say hi to, but that's the
way it is with families, eh?  Looking forward to the next wonderful
experience!

Love,

Eric

Greetings,

I'm sitting here in Sedona,  Az.    Just woke up to a beautiful morning and
some of the most incredible sights of beuatiful red mountains,   and
surrounding countryside.    I've taken some pictures and will soon have them
up on my WEB site.    So far,  I've been able to get on-line,  thanx to
Kinko's Courticy phones.

I already miss dancing,  but I got a fair amount of dancing in San Diego,
although the rave scene is quite a lot smaller,  but LA isn't that far away.

Anyway,  please keep the vibe alive until I get back and have phun for me
while I'm gone.

Cheers
The Crunchman

Just wanna thank everyone who sent me info regarding the SF and L.A. scenes,

more excited about jetting out this hell-hole for 2 weeks now:) Actually,
Dallas isn't THAT bad...hell, we are lucky to even HAVE a scene in this
state, considering the fact that we have to fight an on-going battle against
the conservatism that surrounds us daily. Gotta jet--trying to update the
on-line D-Raves section and add some LIFE to this city! I will probably
e-mail some of you again once I know exactly when I'm heading your way:) Take
Care!!!!

Hi, everyone!  (It's Nancy).  I haven't seen anyone posting about Gateway's 
upcoming camping trip in the Sierras!!  This sounds beautiful - I hope 
people are going because Josh and I will definitely be there.  I tragically 
missed Tribal Future (and I'm still pouting).  But the wilderness is calling out 
to me...I swore to myself I would commune with nature this summer (beyond 
exploring the trees on campus!).

Fourth of July in a small town, tripping on the natives and the culture.  
It's amazing that within the borders of our state you can travel to so 
many different worlds.  I think Grass Valley, CA will be a far cry from my little hometown of Los 
Angeles.  And after visiting the folks we're heading up the mountain on 
Saturday for Gateway...

Let this be a plea to everyone to consider camping this looong week-end.  
I want to see happy faces up there!

Love, Nancy

Amen! You are so correct. This is one beautifull state. There is so much
to see, so much to do, and so many people to meet.

just an amazing party.

surrounded by nature in all directions, with the sound starting around 3 
am we were an island in the middle of nowhere - celebrating the full moon 
overhead beaming us with lite energy. that morning dj fell into a groove 
with awsome house with just enough acid undertones to make this trance 
head dance right up to the last record. thanks gateway for an incredible 
morning.

also much appreciation to brian for taking me, to larry ching for the 
bannanna, and everyone else who gathered there.

energy,
tom

Thanks for your replies to my discussion on Gays at Raves. I have 
been having a blast recently and haven't had much time to respond but 
there were a few that really caught my eye....my whole idea for the 
gays at raves discussion was not for the reason of being able to 
find bed fellows. If I want to go out for sex there are any number of 
clubs or bars I could go to.

What I am talking about is merely finding more gay people who enjoy 
the rave scene as much as everyone else. Everyone is entitled to feel 
like they  belong and if you feel like you are the only gay person 
then no matter how good the music and vibe you are not going to have 
as good a time as you might.

Is it not a human trait to seek out others who are alike?
Would you enjoy the rave as much if you didn't find others with your interests?
Even though you don't go looking for bed fellows isn't it nice to know that
there is always that chance that you may find a partner with the shared
enjoyment of the rave culture?

I love the openess of raves and the fact that it is so enjoyable to 
make new friends without thinking they are trying to pick you up or 
that they are presuming that you are trying to pick them up. I have 
met some of the coolest, nicest and most loving people in this 
environment. It would be way cool if there were more gays at raves 
too. Thats all.

Thanks for all your replies, keep them coming.

Lots of love


David

I will be at the Gateway weekend party. If Tribal Future was anything 
to go by then this will be another weekend to remember. Nearly my 
whole crew will be there, the soon to be wed Keith & Pip, my Brother 
Matthew with the constant smile, Mark, Gary and Kevin to name but a 
few. We will be indulging ourselves in the pleasures of new friends, 
continuing the journey with old ones and lots of circles of love. And 
who knows what else.

Gotta love those four day weekends.


Dave.

 Right around 3PM I was driving around looking for an all-night store that
had insect repellent. I finally ask for directions from the clerk at a 24hour
porno store ( nice guy! ). Someone bought some too, so we ended up with plently.

 Nice small but very friendly crowd - many folks from Tahoe and Sacramento? 
About 30 folks. Intimate

 I'm still tired from it, after sleeping almost 6 hours today. Maybe I'll post
a longer , more personal review later, or just let this one stand. 

 Good night again ...

Great reply David! 
 
How are you?  ..and the gang?  I hear your brother met Jess on Friday.  She
loved your place. 
 
How did you like the Gay Pride Parade?  Any wild after parties?  I had a
great time... hot as hell, though.  Renaud, Me, Jess and Jess' mother
celebrated a special day for Jess' mother who is gay.  Also thought of my
gay friends back in DC and here in San Francisco, you included.   
 
Are you going to ComeUnity Wednesday?  Seems like everybody is going.

This is tangentially related to Karen's troubles, only because I was
thinking about it this weekend.

I only know of two national, "underground communities", those being
DeadHeads and Radical Faeries.  No matter where you go in the U.S., you can
always find them, and they will always put you up for the night, find
someone who might be able to help you with a bigger problem, etc.  Its a
comforting and amazing thing to have, especially for people who have lost
their "natural" support network, for one reason or another.

So when I see things like all the posts offering Karen Hardie words of
encouragement and hope (and all the other things, like people on the list
getting jobs, flats, sharing rides) I am FULL OF GLEE that now I know of a
third underground community.

And not to take anything way from Karen, my legal sweatshop sister in arms,
whatever it is, I am glad that all the kind thoughts and words are helping
you through.  Sometimes it ain't much, but yet, sometimes a kind word is
all I need to get me through.

I don't have a great quote or anything, but I hope you find the strength
and courage to pull through.  At least for me, whenever I have had to
struggle through major, nasty shit, I have come out on the other side a
better person.

enough of my senseless ramblings.....

"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger" - Nietsche

For a complacent pessimist such as myself, this helps--though it doesn't
seem as comforting as they way arkay put it.

Hello all you ravers out there.  Well I am finally going to be getting out
of Santa Cruz, not that this is really a great thing, but I am sure that
the bay area will provide me with more than enough to do.  I have to leave
because I have a new job in Burlingame and cannot afford the commute as it
destroys my car and the gas is really expensive.  So here is the deal. I
can pay up to $600.00/month for a place.  I really am shooting for a place
that I really like (safe, W/D, REALLY FUN PEOPLE, and responsible too,
etc.) over a cheep place.  So if any one needs a house/apartment/flat mate
please let me know.  You can e-mail me at ecoman@megabios.com or to
darwin.ucsc.edu.  BTW I'm 23 year male, long brown hair, vegitarian, N/S,
into molecular biology (this is what I do at a  biotech company)  And I
need to move in ASAP, but my place in Santa Cruz will kick me out at the
end of the month (this is when we gave them our month's notice).  Well
thanks everyone.  Love and hugs.

 Subject:Why Go To Burning Man? [Somewhat Rave Related][longish]

 While I was at Getway's Blue Moon on Monday morning, I did some thinking
about personal issues. One of the things I concluded was that I shouldn't 
go to Burning Man after all. ( Even though I've already bought two 
admissions ). Reasons are:

1. I don't like camping anyway. I never was someone who looked forward to 
   or initiated any camping trips. I have attended some as part of a 
   group, and enjoyed them. But my natural instinct is to keep the heck 
   out of nature.

    Strangley enough, I make exceptions for raves on the beach. I think this
   may have to do wih growing up in Hawaii and enjoying the ocean. Also,
   most beach raves are , at the most , 2 hours from home, while most
   campout raves are multi-day and far away.

1.a  A new thought - maybe, since I grew up in a humid , life-abundant
   enviroment, the harshness and sterility desert may be an especially 
   scaret environment to me. However , I'm at the age (41) where I've
   already had my share of initiatory/face-your-fear experiences - so
   why do I need another one?
 
2. Since I don't normally camp, I have no camping gear except for a 
   sleeping bag. No tent, stove, compass, etc. All would have to be bought
   or rented. 

3. Uncreativity. I get the idea that Burning Man participants should be
   part of a group working on a creative project for display to the other
   attendees of Burning Man. So far, I have not come up with any project
   except little personal things that no one else would understand or 
   appreciate. 

     I haven't gotten any fresh information about the projects that
   other SFRaves are working on to present at BM - what's planned/in
   planning? Maybe if I was part of a "crew" , I'd be more motivated.

4. Time. Part of me feels that the large chunk of time I'd be taking 
   to attend Burning Man would be better applied to upgrading my job
   skills, as I do want to leave the company I'm working for now ( and
   I'm typing this at work too! ). Maybe it's time to make some
   sacrifices to achieve the goal of improve hirablitiy.

 Whew! Sorry for all the verbiage! Well, if anyone could give me some
suggestions one way or another ( Go To BM/Don't Go To BM ), I'd
appreciate it. Since this topic is only vaguely rave-related ( I know that
at least one crew is going to hold a rave at BM ) , please email me with
your suggestions -

 OOps! here comes the boss!

Dear Gateway & SFRaves;

	I alluded to some neagtive things about Gateway Systems a while back, 
that weren't very complimentary, and I just wanted to say that I was wrong, and 
that I'm sorry. Being a person in my position, it's difficult sometime to see 
the truth when I get so much conflicting information from so many unreliable & 
malicious people.

Peace

Dear All;

	I got up late; what else is new and missed the parade; however I did end 
up driving around the Castro for my frist Gay Day. I've never before seen such 
community anywhere I've been so far on the planet; and yet I didn't feel like an 
outsider; I felt welcome and accepted. I love you all from a place of my own 
fear, and enevy your freedom.

THX-1138,

There is nothing said by the statement about that which does kill us--i.e., 
you don't necesarily disagree with him (at least not in this context.)

Hey there!  Me and a buddy are trippin' up to Portland, Oregon, for the
Fourth of July (7-4-96).  We were hoping to hear about some gatherings
before we left. If anybody out there in WEB-land knows of some really
positive-vibe places, please let us know.  We don't do that dark thing at
all!  Nope, we just like the Love-vibe.  You can drop a line via the SFRaves
or send direct e-mail.  Thanks so much.  Godbless...

Larry, 

There is no raver rule that says you MUST go to Burning Man.  There are 
simply some people out there who do not like camping and the lack of 
modern conveniences.  That doesn't make you a pariah, by any means. 

If I were in your shoes, I would just do what I want to do. What makes 
you happy.  There is no sense in attending an event just cause everyone 
else is.  You will probably not have a good time, because not only is it 
outdoors, but the weather can be rather extreme out there.  

Do what you feel is best for YOU. No one knows that better than yourself.

love,              
Amy                 (check my new sig!  I had to say bye to 
                                 Bill the Cat!)

I might go to Gateway, but the only day I can go is Saturday. Any help

Hi Brian -

 Re Burning Man - try http://www.istorm.com/burningman 

 be prepared to wait - their graphics are big and take a long time to download
to your computer. 

 Also - hotline number with touch-tone info menu (415)-985-7471. There is 
registration info there , and other info.

Yeah, even though I'm a former boy scout turned drug scout, I don't much 
care for camping either. Add to the fact that I'm addicted to cafinee and 
Burning Man could become an ugly detox situation, even so I'm going. 

There aren't that many rites of passage for white people in america. You 
have your high school experience, your driver's licence at 16, TJ at 18, 
beer from 7-11 on your 21st birthday, your first drug deal, senior prom,  
graduation,  but no real growing experiences like taking peyote from your 
den leader and establishing a relationship with your god.  

I'm fortunate that I live in a city where on almost any night of the week 
I can go out and have a meaningful experience on the dancefloor with 
like-minded people. That's what it means to be a local. 

Part of the appeal of Burning Man, for me at least, is the quest. I've 
all these goals that I've set for myself, like growing dreadlocks or 
working for George Lucas, and part of the fun is working to make that 
happen. Right now I'm on a quest to find which of my friends really do 
have their shit together, a quest for sleaping bags & tents to borrow, a 
quest to find someone to sit in for me on that first day of class that I 
plan to be spending roasting in a Disneyland for weirdos.    

I know so many people that are going. Santa Cruz people, City people, 
High School people, people who are spinning, Dorm people, people who 
went last year, State people. At the moment I'm still a student person, I 
go to The State and as a result have far to much free time on my hands. 2 
years from now I'll probablly be a real person with real obligations who 
woun't be able to afford dropping everything to go play make believe for 
4 some days. I may not even be a raver 2 years from now, but for now I'm 
gonna rage.

hey lope,

I'm sure there's more than one song out that says "the house of god".. 
but one song i have on a cd comp. called Techno Truth Vol. 1 (Moonshine,
1992) might be the one you're looking for.  It is by DHS called "House of
God"  I believe I saw the vinyl at Reckless Records a few months ago.  
if you're looking for the cd comp. try any tower records or streetlight.

sm:)in' sun



the house of god..
i am excited..
the house of god..
fifty dollars or more

you gotta believe in something
why not believe in me?

Just wanna thank everyone who sent me info regarding the SF and L.A. scenes,
shops, etc.!  I received TONS of postive e-mail from you guys, and I'm even
more excited about jetting out this hell-hole for 2 weeks now:) Actually,
Dallas isn't THAT bad...hell, we are lucky to even HAVE a scene in this
state, considering the fact that we have to fight an on-going battle against
the conservatism that surrounds us daily. Gotta jet--trying to update the
on-line D-Raves section and add some LIFE to this city! I will probably
e-mail some of you again once I know exactly when I'm heading your way:) Take
Care!!!!

Sending Divine-Ultra-Mint-Full-of-Love-Positive-Groovilicious Vibes Your Way,

The Top 15 Problems Encountered Along the Olympic Torch Route
--------------------------------------------------------------
15) Forward progress hampered by slow moving white Bronco.
14) Torch commandeered in Waco by over-zealous ATF agents.
13) One *really* pissed off Smokey the Bear.
12) Budget cuts cause torch to be replaced by less-than-dependable Bic
    lighter.
11) Difficulty getting melted marshmellows off torch after "s'mores"
    party got out of hand.
10) Running 7 miles before realizing the torch is still on top of the
    urinal at the last rest stop.
9)  First-degree burns to runners unfamiliar with how to "receive the
    baton."
8)  Jim Bob, lying in wait on the outskirts of Memphis with a case of
    Bud and a supersoaker.
7)  Rosie Ruiz takes flame in NYC -- appears 30 minutes later in
    Atlanta.
6)  Drive-by goosings.
5)  Torchbearers driven insane by repeated playing of the "Chariots
    of Fire" theme.
4)  Torch-jackings in urban areas.
3)  Crazed hippie terrorists replace Olympic Torch with new Olympic Bong.
2)  Male runners repeatedly get lost and refuse to stop for directions.

and the Number 1 Problem Encountered Along the Olympic Torch Route...

1)  Obnoxious drunks who run up and yell, "No, I meant a BUD light!"

	Here's something for everyone that believes the full moon screws 
up everything. Three vans all broke down that night and it would never 
have happened if some kind soul didn't pipe up and give the system a 
ride and then sit through the mosiqutoes to give it a ride home. 
Citranola oil for tiki torches is a must for locations like that, next 
thing on my list to bring to EVERY outdoor party?

	If you were at the festivities at the end of the parade route,
did you happen to see me? I was the one who was topless with the words
"If you're butch, I'm available" inked onto my fairly large, er, gazongas.
:-) There was some more cool stuff down by the fountain where a whole
group of people were playing & swimming in the water nude until they
were chased out by the "safety" people... Sigh... to be able to go
out in public like that every day...

	If BM is a _show_, does a rave really fit the purpose of the event?
	Is our dance enough to create a "performance" as expected for BM?

	I've been told that raves might actually not be _so_ welcomed at 
	BM, because they "take" more than they "give", which doesn't fit the 
	deep spirit of the event.

	This is a very deep criticism of our scene, and is actually the only 
	thing which would prevent me to attend, if my presence as only a
	raver is considered unfriendly to the event.

	How do the others feel about that?

I hope that all the straights who attended the events in the City were
welcomed, and not resented, feared, etc., just for being straight.  Some of
us are not a threat to anyone.  Part of the reason (a VERY small part) that
I didn't attend was that I felt my presence might not be wanted, or that I
might be confronted with a situation with which I'd be uncomfortable (I've
been approached before, and it frightened me).  Does anyone understand what
I'm saying?  Any thoughts?  Please be kind :)

With several thousand people attending, I doubt it will be the ravers
taking and not giving...

I don't think ravers will be considered BM unfriendly.  I think ravers know
better than anyone what it means to engage in a spiritual, ritualistic
pagan celebration.

I think if anyone will be not welcome at BM are the people who drink way
to much beer and say "Hey, we are in the middle of the desert, we can
do whatever we frickin' want" and proceed to drive their car at 100 mph
in the middle of the night through the main camp, take photos/videos/gawk at
nude people, litter, do donuts, you get my drift.

Plurry ravers in the desert have resulted in some of my most intense 
experiences as a human on Planet Earth at serveral Moontribes in socal.

I think ravers will *make* BM the cool party the promoters envision.
I can't imagine that party being half as good without us.

It's the music, loud, constant, dare I say, incessant, that is the problem,
and to help curb that they are moving the rave camp *2* miles away from the
main camp (opposed to 1 mile last year) and having the loudest systems
point away from the main camp.

I'm quite certain it isn't about who we are, or what we do, it's that it
involves very loud, thumping music the entire time with the exception of
when it's raining.

To be quite honest, it got to me last year, which is why I'll be camped
away from the rave camp, but I'll probably swing by once in a while.  ;^)

Hi everyone,
	I know that there are a lot of web authors and programmers on this
list. I am one too, I am not sure where this will go but I have an idea
that we should network, maybe have some sort of freelance collective to
share work ideas skills etc. I think a good place to start would be to
keep a database of people and skills willing to take on freelance work,
 put up a web page with this info, If you are interested or have
any more ideas or comments or want to be part of this, e-mail me privately
at trose@uclink2.berkeley.edu.

Hi All,

I'm trapped in the office and would love to find a Web site where I can 
hook up to some music--house=good, techno=better, goa=best! I'm using 
RealAudio, and I've already heard most of Groove Radio's shows. 
Suggestions???

Thanks.

:)
Kathryn

[ to sfraves list ]

 I see on the calendar that Come/Unity will be happening this Wednesday!
I haven't been to one in ages... and the next day is a day off! Does 
anyone have any special news about this week's Come/Unity, other than
it being at 1015 Folsom, 10PM-4AM, 21+ , $7 , DJs Simon, Jeno, and
Garth?

 Also - I see the hospice charity event "Chateau de Boom" is happening the
next day in Hillsboro from noon-8PM. Is anyone in SFRaves involved with
that, and is there any special details were should know about it ( are
there age restrictions? ). $3 is the stated admission. But, what is
"classic spelling" ?

"Loud, constant, incessant" -
could anyone hope for more ??  :)  :)

For three days last year at Burning Man,
the music I love most became
the (literal) soundtrack for my life!!

I camped in the rave camp last year &
on the night of the craziest storm, I stayed inside my
sleeping bag, so blissful - drifting in and
out of sleep and rain and dreams and beats.

In my tent that night, cozy, listening to the music -
hell, VIBRATING WITH THE MUSIC, as it thumped up
into me from the ground - knowing that outside, people
were dancing madly through the wind & the rain,
dancing as if their very lives depended on filling up
400 sq. miles of darkness with such ENERGY....
I felt so connected to everything, and like
there was nowhere at all that I would rather be.

Yay!!  oh, yay!!  Just remembering this makes me so happy!

The Black Rock desert is a beautiful place.

eric - 

not to worry.  the more, the merrier..  plus, unless you're gawking,
holding on to your girlfriend and saying "oh my god!!" a lot, nobody would
even know or care that you were straight.  as far as getting picked up on,
once you've been here for a while, you'll get used to it.  you might even
get to the point where you flirt back most of the time.  it's great fun!
just keep on smiling... plur at parades is just as good as plur at raves.

With twice as many people going this year, though, I bet it won't seem 
like two miles out.  The main camp is obviously going to be bigger and 
therefore more spread out and there will still be complainers.

HotWired has a set by Jon Williams and Derrick May, recorded back on
February 26 of this year... There's an interview with Derrick, plus a hour
or so DJ set from each. Here's the direct RA links, just cut and paste the
URLs below into your browser. (You can't look at the pages that went with
this event, but you CAN listen to the audio.)

We will be doing more events like this in the future, as soon as we move
into our new facilities...

Dear All;

	I feel a fear that I don't understand. It's weird, because as I look at 
this feeling, fear being an emotion; question it, I draw a fustrated blank. 
Feelings not being facts, I'm approached by a person I believe for all intents 
and purposes wishes me no harm, and to the contray wants to make me feel good 
because they like me. Yet, I am almost parazied, by a feeling that litertally 
chokes all logical reason from me. Why?

	Logic would indicate that if companionship is the goal that being 
available to both sexes would make that goal twice as easy to obtain. Or is the 
goal reproduction. Reproduction being for all intents and purposes the act of 
having sex to make a baby.

	I feel the goal for most people is companionship because reproduction as 
defined above is the last and furthest thing on my mind when I meet someone I'm 
attracted to.

	So why the fear? It's just so frustrating, and to add to that it seems 
like neither community accepts bi-sexuals, or so I've been told.

	I'm personally straight and don't understand when I see something as 
clearly logical as this, why these (feelings) stop me. 

Peace

Conditioned response.  They've been brainwashing us since day one.
(to be read with an appropriate dose of sarcasm--but not too much)

Sounds more ominous than it is but essentially one assumes the
emotional responses of ones environment--most prejudice is learned from
one's parents, friends, society, etc...

If you live in an environment were you aren't around homosexual,
bi-sexual or heterosexual behaviour or more importantly were it's
relegated to the fringes or just condemned, it wont seem normal or
natural to you emmotionaly despite what the logical mind says.

Face your fear, accept what you know to be right and the fear
will eventually fade.

"Fear is the mind killer" unless you let your mind kill the fear first.

 That's 'cause Come/Unity , being a repeating event at a fixed time of each 
month, is placed in the "weeklies" section of the calendar - check the
calendar again under the "Wednesday" weekly section.

Hey there!  Me and a buddy are trippin' up to Portland, Oregon, for the
Fourth of July (7-4-96).  We were hoping to hear about some gatherings
before we left. If anybody out there in WEB-land knows of some really
positive-vibe places, please let us know.  We don't do that dark thing at
all!  Nope, we just like the Love-vibe.  You can drop a line via the SFRaves
or send direct e-mail.  Thanks so much.  Godbless...

Precedence: bulk

Hey sfravers!  This post may take you a bit off guard and is a bit long, but
I REALLY needed to express myself.  Can you relate?  I hope so. This warning
post could may be considered weird, or kooky, or drug-induced....but it is
not in any way.  I write simply because I care so much about all of you.  

I'll try to be brief and to the point, cause I know you all can handle it.
This will offend some of you, but those who appreciate the love of God and
the beautiful "positive" vibes we share at selected gatherings may well
appreciate what I've got to say.  Others will not like this post, cause I'm
"outing" them bigtime. I've attended raves from New York to San Francisco
and points in-between. SF is actually my home, but I am away for a while.  
The group called "Come unity" (aka:  community) is bad news.  I've been to
their gatherings before and they are bluntly...Satan-worshippers.  And I do
mean this quite literally.  They go beyond ideals of peganism and actually
practice worship of the ultimate negativity.  They call out to demons, seek
to practice what they call "ancient" rites and are altogether very foolish.
The energy at their so-called gatherings is swirling, confusing and heated
with types of negativity that actually can molest unsuspecting individuals.
They will deny this completely if you confront any of their "members" and
will dodge all of the issues I speak of here.  But as I have said, I know
this first hand.  If you peel away the layers of novices and hapless people
who have simply stumbled into their party, you'll find a "secret" cult group
that is organized and diabolical.  This is their core and it is quite ugly.

My worst and best experience with them happened in 1994.  I was called to
attend their gathering around 4:30am.  It was at the SoundFactory space.
They absolutely hated my presence there because I was reaching out beyond
their self-imposed prision (that horrific negative energy I described
earlier).  They bumped me.  Heckled me.  And attacked me in various ways.
Their eyes were big and black, and it was not due to 'crissy' or 'X'.
My crime? I was simply trying to shine my light, because I love all of you
so much.  But the tables were turned on them.  Let's just say that an
"awesome" assistance was rendered that night to turn the tables. Special
assistance was rendered from the ultimate Love vibe that night to help those
poor children, who were caught up in that nasty scene, see more clearly what
was going down.  Thus, it was one of my worst because I found "community" to
be actual, bonifide, card carrying Satan-worshippers...and it was one of my
best experiences because they lost the "battle" that night.  So to speak.
Their hexigons and magick candles and demons were seen by many for what they
really are:  Foolishness.  Emptiness.  Lies.  Powerlessness.  Pathetic, huh? 

So here's my warning for each of you:  be aware!  Someone recently told me
there is nothing quite like experience..and to this I agree.  But I must add
that immersing yourself and giving up self-awareness and conscious thought
IS NOT what self-discovery is about. In fact, this is the OPPOSITE!  There
are many opportunities out "there" to grow in Love and to become acquainted
with the larger concepts of Life and our existance.  Sadly, "community" is
not one of them.  So please be aware and I hope you'll seek out other places
to attend, especially if you are seeking the 'real' positive vibe in Truth.

Taking a chance for Love,

Troy          

p.s.  Please don't be afraid to shine that beautiful light inside of you.
You were not made "wrong".  Love is real!

I've got about twelve full-length techno, trance, and rave cd's on my site. 
it's called x-radio and it's at http://www.x-radio.com/x-radio/.  I've got 
another dozen cd's on my desk waiting to be encoded.

Let me know what you think, and if you've got any requests, send them to me.

Since we're on the subject of internet radio, I should mention that I've been 
looking to add some programming to the site.  My next step, after getting the rest 
of these cd's on, is to add a few live programs.  I was thinking about finding 
somebody that had a "real" (as opposed to "internet" ) radio show and simulcasting 
it on the net.  I know others have done one-off simulcasts, but I'd like to make it 
a regular event, say, each week.

Or, if there is an enterprising radio personality out there that would like to creat 
their own show and broadcast it on the net, that would work too.  I mean, come on, 
there's how many of us now, 30-50 million?

If anybody's interested, you know where to find me.

Best,
pauly

Dear Wowser;

	First of all there is NO GOD, you've been lied to as we all have. Second I've 
been to Community many times and if they are in satan worship they also have been lied 
to because it doesn't exsist either. The bible is trash as well as the satanic one; they 
are both self subscribed, self perpetuating, control systems; don't believe the hype, 
and stop doing speed.

	As for Community being evil, it's a great party, it's the most awesome monthly 
going, and yes I have NO affiliation will them, I just like their party. Furhter more if 
the satanist like to party like community does, then sign me up. What kind of rave do 
you go to, ones sponsored by Bob Dole, ravers for Christ.

	Jesus Christ!!! man do you actually think in this whole fucking thing we call 
the universe, this infinite space where; to quote Carl Sagan there are millions, and 
millions and millions of stars, surrounding them are billions, and billions, and 
billions of planets. That you think we the people of Earth, a planet so far out in the 
sticks of the galaxy, that we are Gods chosen people; HA HA HA. This belief is so 
grandiose, & megalomical, it itself is a sin.

	Please do not bore the educated, aware, and enlightened with this childish 
tripe.

	Yes, please do something for the planet, first lose the God stuff enough people 
have died ovber Christ for me to belief it's a bad thang. Second belief in yourself, 
your worth it belief it or not. Third go to community and have so fun for Christ's sack, 
I know he would want you to be happy, he is Christ you know pure love.

Peace

Dear All;

	He's mine!!!!!

Dear Wowser;

	First of all there is NO GOD, you've been lied too, as we all have. Second, I've

to because Satant doesn't exsist either. The bible is corruptted trash as well as the satanic one; they

speed, it is rotting your brain.

	As for Community being evil, it's a great party, it's the most awesome monthly 
going, and yes I have NO affiliation will them, I just like their party. Further more, if 
the satanist like to party like community does, then sign me up. What kind of rave do 
you go to, ones sponsored by Bob Dole, ravers for Christ, Christians for E, Catholics for House Music, 
Buddists for Trance, huh?

	Jesus Christ Man!!!! do you actually think this whole fucking thing we call 
the universe, this infinite space where; to quote Carl Sagan there are billions, and 
billions and billions of stars, surrounding them are trillions, and trillions, and 
trillions of planets, that could support all sorts of life forms. That you think we the people of Earth, 
a planet so far out in the sticks of the galaxy, that we are gods chosen people; HA HA HA. This belief is 
sooooo grandiose, & megalomical, the belief itself is a sin.

	Please do not bore the educated, aware, and enlightened with this childish 
tripe.

	Look at history man!!!, gods have come, gods have gone, look at the roman gods like jupiter, the 
greek gods like zeus and apollo, and the eyption gods like rah; where are they today. I tell ya where 
they are today, an old rotten dung of a memory; interesting only to historians and people needing 
something to believe in because they won't or can't believe in themselves.

	Yes, please do something for the planet & yourself. First, lose the God stuff, haven't enough 
people have died over that Christ person. Enough have for me to believe it's a bad thang. Second, try and 
believe in yourself, see that you are divine, that we are divine, and feel your own power; your worth it 
believe it or not. Third go to community and have some fun for Christ's sake, I know Christ almighty 
would want you to be happy & content, he is Christ you know; pure love. We were not put here to resist 
every tempation that could make us feel good so we can feel miserable.

Peace

THX-1138:
	Whoa, my friend, I think you need to go night-night! ;) 

	It's way too late to form a coherent argument, but it's also too late
to not jump in on one...
	Wowser never mentioned Christ(I don't think), and he didn't come down on
non-Christian beliefs (it wasn't clear whether "pagan ideals" were good or bad),
just "evil" Satanism.  Disregarding the fact that not all Satanists (and some
would say no "true" Satanists) are evil or practice evil, he theoretically has a
point, if you believe in any kind of group-generated vibe/power at all:
"bad vibe not good, intentional bad vibe worse" (I'm tired).  And if you don't,
he's still entitled to his spiritual/religious beliefs.

	That being said, I think he's being crazy as f**k too.

One way to find out, of course, is to go.  Heck I wasn't so sure if I was going
to go, but after reading his post I can't miss it!!

See you there?

should be just that - PERSONAL.  I think that trying to impose one's 
belief system on another is getting close to being the height of 
rudeness.  No matter how much text, dogma and jargon people spout, NO ONE 
KNOWS FOR SURE, FACE IT!

I am a humanist and as such don't believe in any form of the 
supernatural.  I do believe that there may be things in the universe that 
we will NEVER explain scientifically, however, simply because they are 
beyond our current ability to make sense of them.

But God as a force can't be called supernatural either ... if he exists, 
he HAS to be a part of the whole and therefore part of nature.

it's a litle too early in the morning for me to be getting into heavy 
shit like this but Wowser's post touched a nerve ... and THX1138's did 
too, from the opposite direction.  I don't agree with any of the 
accusations Wowser levelled at Come Unity, but i just as strongly 
disagree with THX1138's lack of respect in his response.

Actually, probably lack thereof. I hear there has been great progress made

Cool!!! Given that the Burning Man theme is Hell this year, you think I 
can sign up for my card there? Man, what will they think of next? Does 
the card entitle you to discounts anywhere, for Satan related business, 
like, I dunno, trips to a lawyer, or your next purchase of a Microsoft 
product?

daddy--what does regret mean?

Well, son--a funny thing about
regret is, it's better
to regret something you have
done than to regret something you haven't done.

And by the way, if you see
your mother at Comeunity, tell her   SATAN
SATAN        SATAN       SATAN       SATAN        SATAN        SATAN

Ok, so who's going where tonite???

I had thoughts of Come/Unity... However mingleing with the Club Kidz till 2AM
dosen't really agree with me...

Promise lives up to it's name with it's lineup alone... 

I've been to both locations before so the sense of "something new"  is a moot
point,  the costs is the same and they're about 10 -15 Min from each other...

Hmmm, any suggestions...

(Belive me the "come/unity  warning" post has been filed under the: "Humor/
This is the reason not to take too much drugs" section of my mail, and is in
no way swaying my decision...)

It'll be a long, fun weekend (especially if you can take Friday off too!) -
Freedom, Wicked, Organic and Bulletproof are all doing parties, and the

There's also a Stompy event at 1015 during the day on the Fourth; 
I lost the flyer but it should be fun.  Trust me :).

I'm definitely going to "The Promise" simply because of it's printed
message/story inside the flyers...the story is AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL!!!
I was going to transcribe it and post it to SFRaves but I've given
all my flyers away and don't have any more copies with me here at work!
I have an extra copy of just the story at home so I'll make some
photocopies and bring them to the party tonight...I'd love to give you
a copy if you haven't read it yet, just ask me for one! 

I'll be wearing a Curious George t-shirt and I have really short hair
and am about 5'8" and asian.

Peace Everyone!
John

	You shouldn't have worried, last weekend was a weekend for all
peoples, straight or otherwise, to meet, mingle, and share a day in the sun.
I know that I didn't care about the (I can only assume) straight guys
coming up to me and asking to have their picture taken with me. It was just a
really cool vibe.

I totally get where you're coming from. Sometimes I get the
heebeejeebees just walking around The Castro on an average day. In the
past, I've had members of my gender attempt to pick me up on the
street more often than women have. It had a way of calling into
question my manliness, if you know what I mean.

As for the parade, I attended it for the first time with four of my
friends -- all of us being straight, to a degree. (I don't consider it
to be a black and white thing, really.)  I found the scene very
entertaining. One of my favorite bits was the group of paraders toting
a banner that read, "Straights for Gay Rights". That was right on for
us. Another one was when I saw one of my roommates (who happens to be
of the lesbian persuasion) walking along on the very last float in the
parade, The Church of Radiant Light. We shared waves, smiles, and
blown kisses as she marched by. Needless to say, I felt quite welcome
there (and I wasn't even hit on, either).

It's all come a long way for me. Ever since high school, when
classmates called me a "faggot", I was quite homophobic. I was
programmed to think that being straight was normal, at a time when I
was in great need of acceptance. It wasn't until I moved to New York
City in 1990, and got to know several gay and lesbian people well,
that I was able to confront that biggotry of the past, and what
created it, and open myself up to accept and be related with people of
all sexual persuasions.

My advice for you is to inquire into how you became who you are
sexaully. What were those moments in your past that forced you to make
the sort of decisions that I made back in high school? What does being
gay mean to you? What judgements and opinions do you have about gay
men, and gay culture?

PLUR,
George (about an 8 on the gay-straight scale, 10 being totally straight)

> p.s.  Please don't be afraid to shine that beautiful light inside of you.
> You were not made "wrong".  Love is real!

I'm not afraid to shine my beautiful judeo/pagan/pantheist light on
you.  My light sees that you are steaming pile of shit with a halo of
flies. You need to deprogram yourself from your twisted schooling in
Christianity, in whose name the greatest evils of this earth have been
perpetrated (crusades, pogroms, witch burgnings, slavery, and the
rape/abuse of innocent children at the hands of "celibate" priests and
nuns). Lots of dead souls hovering around there,
killed/tortured/maimed/repressed at the expense of your smothering,
mind-numbing, lie-perpetuating, stupefying "christian" love. Jesus can
kiss my ass, not because of who he was (a charismatic jew of the essene
order), but because of what asshole christians like yourself have
twisted his "love" into.

Also, just because "signs and symbols" of paganism are used, doesn't
make a group satanic -- and satanism is completely different from
paganism. Those symbols existed long before that charlatan called Jesus
became the comic-book hero of the unwashed and stupid 2000 years ago,
and Satan was just reinvented to provide a balanced dialectic anti-hero
for the comic book we call the New Testament. The Old Testament doesn't
really give a flying fuck about Satan he's just part of "the one" which
encompasses good/bad, love/hate and all dialectics imaginable. We jews
believe in the "one" (adonai echad!, ALL-IN-ONE-GOD-FAITH of Rabbi
Hillel (Jesus' teacher), and the everything-is-god of the Jewish
Pantheists (Spinoza)). All this "one" is a funny precursor to today's
"everything is related" new-agism and nature-worshipping paganism that
might be found amongst ravers today. 

The "one" is also an essential part of "funk", as in the unique
booty-freeing rhythmic structure invented by James Brown and handed
down to his funky house/techno/dub disciples today, it's the same "one"
that DJ's aspire to when they beatmatch... finding the universal rhythm
of god in nature and beats ... it's the "one" in which dancers come
together as a whole "sum is greater than the parts" that makes a rave
(or COME/UNITY). You're god, I'm god, we're all god and so is the earth
and the heavens.

Once you realize that you can make your own heaven here on earth by
believing in "the one" you can do away with your pathetic christian
notions of a paternalistic "god" and a paternalistic anti-god called 
"satan" and seek your salvation in your direct future of the here and
now.

Personally, I *LIKE* it when satanic symbols are used at raves. It
keeps butt-stupid spoon-fed-by-ignorant-lies-to-keep-them-submissive
Christians like yourself away from a perfectly good party.

Hey did you dig some of that old Woodstock brown acid out of your bottom

 Come/Unity AND Promise - Why Not ???

 Seeing the recent topic thread of Come/Unity vs. Promise - I thought to
myself "Why not try to attend BOTH?" 

 Pros: I would see more folks that I know if I go to both events.
       Musical variety
       Crowd contrasts

 Cons: Missing "favorite" DJs if I'm at "the other place"
       May get kept out if there are no "ins-and-outs" allowed

 So - Will Come/Unity allow ins-and-outs ?
      Will Promise allow ins-and-outs ?

      Come/Unity is scheduled to go until 4AM - what about Promise?

      How far will Promise be from 1015 Folsom?

 Any answers to my questions would be gratefully received!

Hey SampleHeads!

I'm trying to get ahold of the MegaBass Sampling CD.  I borrowed it from a friend (who has since lost the CD!) and sampled a ton of vocal stuff.  The drive that the samples were on took a nasty fall and, well, it no work no more. 

All I need is One vocal sample off the CD, called "Crying for More".  If anyone has this CD, Please Email me privatly.

Thanxs!!

YES!  =)

        My favorite was "Decension" Put together by the drop bass network
in Milwaukee.  On the flyer it had a grinning red devil, complete with
pitchfork!!!  Designed for this exact reason!!!  It was an EXCELLENT though
intense party!

Bless you raver son, 

Your email was too long to actually read Niels
but I saw something about spoonfed and thought 
fondly of myself ...

a day late - Crash Worship has not an ounce of musical
interestingness to back up their cake throwing freak parade.
The show blew ... I left after about 1/2 hour or 45 minutes.

my line - used only once (so is it really a line?) - at that
concert was "no one told me I was supposed to wear face paint"
to which I received the somewhat clever or at least snappy retort 
"I wear it every day honey (wink)".

I can't help myself - I'm going to quote Gertrude Stein
who is actually quoting Pablo Picasso ...

"They are not men, they are not women, they are Americans."

Have a happy 4th!
Dave

Neil :

While I find the rest of your message both infomative and informed as well
as entertaining,
I don't agree with the closing paragraph. Of course I acknowledge the fact
that you are expressing
a personal opinion but my own opinion is that rave paries should be kept
free of all religious
and political interference.
I extend this viewpoint to the recent Gays at Raves discussion. Why use
labels such as religion, color,
gender preference, etc. to pigeon-hole each other ? This happens enough in
the world outside of the parties we attend.
 I beleive that any organised religion is a personal matter for an individual.
For centuries religion has been used as a tool to beat your neighbor with
or an exuse to hate someone you don't even know or looks different to you.
In Nicholas Saunders book "ecstacy" he writes about the rave scene in
Northern Ireland. Here, he tells about Catholic and Protestants coming
together and partying. This NEVER happened in the days before
house/Techno.
In closing, I think any religious affiliations should be left at the club
entrance.

P.S. See you all at Come-unity tonight. I'll be the one without the
inverted pentagram. :-)

I called the voicemail this am, and Promise is at 21st and Mission. I'm 
going to swing by there on my lunch hour to see what the location's like, 
but my impression is that it's sorta residential around there. I don't 
know what the possibilities are for noise complaints, but I wonder if 
it'll really go all night. Anyone else have some perspective?

	Well, actually a few have. Sebastin from Spiral Tribe came over and
was doing parties with SPAZ, but few people went out to them. Think about 
this, how many people will come out to a party that does not have a 
reputation in SF? How many people will come out to a party that doesn't 
print a big huge flyer with the same five names on it? A name goes a 
really long way in SF as far as I have seen, and if you are from out of 
town, you aren't going to be able to come in here, setup shop and throw 
your type of party as far as I have seen...

Just wondering wich sf ravers went?  I thought the space was super, it was 
held at Pier 21 I believe (one of those) and certainly enough dancing room 
was available.  I didn't catch much of Myster E's set but I really found 
myself dancing hard to Mars.  I think I may check out Pack a Bowl tomorrow 
night for the trance war! I'll definately plan on the F-8 party next Sat at 
Red Rock!

Dear All;

	Ok, just for the record, I'll entertain the existence of God, & Jesus Christ just to be fair. He 
or maybe she is suppose to come back, ya know the second coming. So how will we recognize this person,
let a lone what will we call him, or her; Jesus 2. How will we recognized this person, will they have a 
tattoo or something saying I am the messenger of god. Or will they just walk into the white house and say 
I'm the second coming of christ; (chuckle) they usually lock those people up. Well, maybe their coming, 
maybe their living in our time right now, maybe their locked up in a mental hospital right now; has 
anyone checked The Betty Ford Center. Maybe, just maybe their gonna come back, and tell us that we all 
been lied to; maybe. Maybe, they'll come back and perform miracles like healing AIDS patients, or maybe 
that's what they will tell the people ten thousand years from now when all this is forgotten.

	Anytime I run into a belief system I apply what I call the Pure Love Logic Test to it. It kinda 
goes like this; if the belief system in question makes another human being less than human, it is nothing 
more than hatred, and a license for oppression. So if it dehumanizes, it's bad.

	Our creator gave us a way to tell when something is right, and something is wrong; it's called 
our body. When I believe in myself I feel powerful, complete, whole, and loved. I get goose bumps and 
chills all over by body; it just feels sooo right, and it's never ever failed me. So go a head try and 
believe in yourself, that you can change the world, that you are divine, and you can make a difference. 
Does your body tell you something, how does it feel, I'll bet pretty good. Does it feel like it fits you, 
like your familiar with it, something that you can trust without doubt, or debate, something you just now 
to be true?

	So instead of waiting for a human being to come back from the dead, which has not happened to 
date. Why don't we all start believing in ourselves, and when we believe in ourselves, we end up 
accepting & believing in each other, and we just might end up taking ourselves, our race, and our planet 
where it's never been before; hey and if they come back we can all say; hey we didn't need you go have a 
beer and chill by the DJ.

although from my understanding, another of the gripes against ravers last year
dealt with the beleif that many (majority) of the people who came to the
festival without buying tickets were people who went there just for the rave,
and thought of the whole burning man thing as secondary.  This may not be
true, but in fact a great many people who were there last year didn't
buy a ticket.  A number of the ravers I talked to can be included in this 
category.

	Well, the simple answer is all the alcohol that was observed from 
the bars. Underground doesn't really have income like that to invest in 9 
intelabeams (which make the place far too bright anyway). I kinda of like 
scrounging in the spaces that other people seem to think aren't really 
good for anything - though I wouldn't mind an open air balcony. There is 
something about taking a space, making due with its constraints and 
filling it with the energy we bring in... Then we do have outdoor parties 
and one would be very hard pressed to find a club that is rigged to bring 
a simple lazer out and bounce it aruond a valley all night like I have 
heard people talking about doing very soon...

	And will a dj spin a killer set if the crowd cannot keep up with 
that djs energy? If the crowd oozes the meatmarket aggressive vibe, how 
is that going to affect the dj because as I see it, there is a big energy 
circle that forms between the crowd and the dj and when the crowd doesn't 
want to go in the direction the dj moves (or the dj moves too quickily in 
that direction with setting it all up and the like) the crowd isn't going 
to match that energy... So I would think the two are linked in such a way 
that you cannot say the music makes a party or the crowd makes a 
party....

Ultimately, in the name of fairness, I'd have to agree with you on this
one. It is probably as inappropriate to have overt "satanic" symbols at
a rave as it is to have massive "crucifixes" or "stars of david" all
over the place because of the cultural connotations they have. Same
with swastikas. (I remember complaining about the original SFR logo
back in 93-94 because it looked like a crucifix to me)....

On the other hand, perhaps having religious symbolism around is 
appropriate in that it allows people to reclaim symbols that have been
given inappropriate cultural significance, e.g. pentagrams are defined
"evil" by christians, and swastikas by nazis (even though swastikas are
used decoratively in india w/o such cultural connotations -- hitler
stole the symbol from the hindus).

Beyond that, there's the possiblity of using symbols as an in-your-face
way of reclaiming/proclaiming your identity and strength of being
"outside the norm". Much in the way homosexuals have reclaimed "gay"
"queer" and even "faggot" as their own. Maybe the "satanic" (pagan)
symbols serve this kind of purpose??

Since I have to deal with Christian symbology on a day-to-day basis as
a citizen of this country, i think it's only fair to counterbalance all
those "in god we trust" and "under god" credos with appropriate
equal-and-opposite counterbalance (especially because I know that
"their" god is not my god). So what's a simple pentagram between
friends?

I'll probably be at C/U tonite if I'm not too tired from slaughtering 
farm animals for sacrifice. Perhaps I'll drag out my upside-down
crucifix earring. I remember some asshole threatening to beat me up a
few years ago for that one -- guess he wanted to show some of his good
Christian love...

On the subject of Burning Man (BM) and paying or not.... since I know the
guys that put the affair on and subsequently that they don't get rich
off of it.... I'd like to suggest considering paying for the affair if you
can at all... the $$$ ($40) goes to keep good porta potties, lots of BLM
people, emergency air lift backup, the building and transport of THE MAN,
BM radio station etc.... even if there was $50K+ left after expenses the
main crew would split that to actually make very little each... This is
really no way to get rich.

  Also, consider not leaving a mess since EVERYTHING including ashes from
fires must be cleaned from the playa... last year I watched them sweep up
the ashes of the man before I left... so $$$ also helps pay for the cleanup
which takes some time after the event ends to complete... unlike a forest
where trash can hide - it's really easy to spot any garbage left on the
flat, otherwise desolate playa.... and you can be sure the BLM people are
watching....

Just a public service announcement... ;-)

I think it's 'promise' for me... I'm bringing a couple of newbies out and
i'm scared that come/unity will be too housey and too crowded & clubby to
give them a good first experience..  I know I would be able to enjoy it by
bringing some good energy and connecting to folks while dancing crazily,
but my friends who haven't done this before might not be able to do that. 

Hope to see many of you there!!

Hey all !

I'll be celebrating my b-day (after 12 tonite) at Come-unity, and maybe
Promise later.
Easy to spot me : I'll be the one surrounded by an entourage of beautiful people
proferring sweet-meats, party favors and free love.
Er...actually I'll be checking for a friend in the patio around 12.30 so
I'll probably

Not really rave realted except for the music loop on the backgroud.
Comming soon instead of the music loop it will be Orbital's Satan on

	 When we asked the people at the gate where the sound systems were, the 
woman working got all flustered and went off about how us ravers had to 
pay just like everyone else; this was before we handed over our money 
that we had in a nice little stack - though I admit it was short like 10 
bux between the 5 of us in the car. So after handing over the money I 
explained I wasn't trying to get in free, just wanted to know where we 
were going, and she said the people working had many people say "They 
were with the sound system" and because of this, they should be exempted 
from paying. That would explain why the staff didn't like many of the 
raver people. 
	To represent all sides, the festival is on BLM land and 
just because some idiot is asking you to pay for toilets which you don't 
use because you know how to pack you shit in and out and you are not 
really there for the fesitval anyway so the BLM should not count you in 
the organized use permit that the Burning Man project pays for is simply 
ridiculous (take from an argument on the burning man list)... Legally, 
the burning man project has no way of making you pay. And legally, you 
have no recourse for when you wake up and find your tires slashed in 
the middle of the playa, far from the nice easy things that cities 
have, unless you saw who did it ;)

	Not all people who came up to rave camp were looking for the same
spiritual or ritualistic celebration (let alone some form of pagan
celebration - whose definition of pagan celebration are we going to use
here anyway?). There were plenty of people with tons of attitude flicking
cig butts in a most practiced manner across the playa (just for the
record, it was the manner that the butt was flicked that I making this
judgement on) and whether that has anything to do with spiritualism and
the like doesn't have much bearing on my perception that I considered them
arses. There was this conversation that I was sitting in on, near sunrise
on Saturday morning where someone guy was talking about how commnity was a
great thing and he was all for it, but that currently, any community we
might have had at the time was dead, a lie, a pipedream, or a basic
delsuion - quite frankly, I thought he was full of shite. I think that the
pretenious behavior that could be found in parts of rave camp during the
day could have something to do with other people looking unfavorably at
those people who chose to inhabit such a place, especially when most
people at the festival have an active saracasm unit. Saracasm and
preteniousness don't mix too well when the saracasm is making light of it
all. 
	All kinds of people come up to the rave camp of burning man. Some 
of them may be on the same journey as you. Some may seem like twisted 
evil fiends. Some will have a sense of saracasm and be able to laugh 
while others cannot and take offense at just about everything. (warning, 
about to speak out of my arse) The main thing about the "spirit of 
participating" is not producing a show, but interacting with the people 
around you and not playing the judgemental observer who sits back and 
stares things up and down but does not put any of oneself out. If you are 
going to go up and be an arsehole, you will probably be viewed as one. If 
you go up and play, I doubt anyone is going to shit (as long as you can 
laugh a little) and be prepared to be open enough to let people run 
around naked spewing fire from their mouth without crinckling your nose 
(although I suppose one would have to be comfortable enough with oneself 
to do that that your crinckled nose wouldn't have too much effect on them).

	Hmmm, main camp had Xoas camp spewing forth a loud siren 
throughout the night. I doubt that the beats of rave camp were much more 
annoying than that.

	That's my spew... Have a good time if you come up...

[ to sfraves list , from Larry Ching ]

 The Last Times ( for awhile ... )

[ The following contains no news about raves , and can be skipped by
  folks who don't know me ]

 I've recently decided to greatly reduce my attendance at raves for an 
undeterminate amount of time ( maybe a few months or until Spring 1997 ). 

Some personal issues have led to my decision, including an attempt to
improve my resume by learning some Mac OS C programming. Every once and
awhile, I'll keep my sanity by showing up at a daytime event like Sunset 
or a Golden Gate bandshell party or a beach rave. But no overnighters 
for now.

 Also, I'll be unsubscr*bing from SFRAves soon, for about the same period
of time as my "rave drought". [ Reading about all the great upcoming 
raves would just be too tempting! ] I'll still be getting the calendar, to 
anticipate and schedule any upcoming daytime events. 

 I want to say that it's been a great four years on the SFRaves mailist 
for me, and I've met a lot of wonderful folks because of it! Blessings to 
all of you! I shall return, someday. 

 Anyway, I'm going to do tonight's parties like they're my last! I'm 
starting at Come/Unity for my heart's sake - staying until it gets too 
crowded, then go to Promise. Tomorrow, after a nap and some food, the
AIDS benefit called Chateau de Boom . The rest of the weekend - I don't
know.

 Anyway, if you see me tonight,say "hello/goodbye" ! I'll be wearing a 
black t-shirt with a cubist rendition of a jazz band on the front, and on 
my face will be my perscription, red-rimmed, "rave goggles". Oh - and
maybe some SFRaves regalia ... 

 Love 2U All !

Hey SFRavers-

Does anybody know anything about this Mission Move event? (see the following 
e-mail)  My brother and I went to the Transatlantic Move and this sounds 
interesting. Camel Cigs sponsored the whole thing and I still have a 
collectors edition trippy colored raver Bic lighter and matching phone 
card!!!!!!!!!!!!

gee Niels, your a liberal, you talk about loving everyone as all fucking 
liberals do, yet you and your liberal mind-set have totally contradicted
everything that you "believe" in. Let the man believe in God, let him not 
go to Come/Unity, but dont tell him to go fuck himself as you did. Its 
really funny how fucking liberals like you are nothing but HYPOCRITS!
you talk about PLUR, and here you are telling him he's a bad person for

[ to sfraves mailist ]

 ( No new raves news here )

 Wardrobe change announcement! Of course , I should be wearing my first
ever "ravish" bit of clothing tonight instead of my new black t-shirt.
Look for Larry Ching in a yellow-and-black checked t-shirt with a 
big portrait of GOOFY (tm) on the front!

 Garsh!

I'm about 5'11" -6', short blond hair and reddish goatee/smig type thing.
Might be a little sun-burned as I just spent my lunchbreak lying out in

My hat is off to George, I completely respect his thoughts and 
feelings -  mature and open minded.

If the scoring system he uses is anything to go by then I am a a zero 
so I would rather use a different type of measuring stick! 

But I do concur that our society only leads us to believe that being straight 
is the norm, just as it leads us to believe that being married, 
having 2.2 children, driving a Ford Taurus and loving it at Levitz is 
"normal" too. Interestingly enough a recent study showed that in fact 
only 8% of the entire US population is "normal" according to this 
cultural myth. Gays are supposed to represent around 10% of the 
population so it would seem to me that there are more of us than 
those normal folk anyway!

Non-the-less I am not attracted to members of the opposite sex, only 
my own. I was at the Gay Pride Festival and found the whole mood to be the 
best I have encountered because it was one of openness and acceptance of 
all. I even heard one person on the stage saying lets thank the 
religious right for making us a high profile group, I believe that 
with every negative there is a hidden gift, or a way to make it a 
positive and this statement was a wonderful example of that.

Finally, my whole feeling about San Francisco is that it supports you 
who ever you are and who ever you want to be. You can be you here, 
you are allowed and encouraged to be you and not who you think you 
are supposed to be in order to please other people. What better place 
to be than one that nurtures that reality? 

Then add in the rave scene and phew, what an awesome place. In fact I 
think I will live here for the rest of my life.

The End

Bye for now

love

David

[ to sfraves again - I didn't see it show up the first time I sent it out ]

 For those who might be looking out for me - decided not to wear my
new black t-shirt w/cubist design. Instead, in honor of the occasion,
I'll be wearing my first ever "ravish" item of clothing - a yellow-and-
black checked t-shirt with a portrait of the Disney cartoon character
GOOFY (tm) .

No, don't hyperventilate - it does happen sometimes you know :)

Today's decision is to attend Promise.  And I'm very pleased with my
decision if I might say so myself.

I'd love to meet more of you so here's the ID:

I'm a human being with two eyes, a nose etc...
AND I'll be wearing all black and white with black and white stripped
tights.  They are hard to miss, especially under the black lights...

see ya there (or be way square)

In a message dated 96-07-03 03:31:46 EDT, you write:

>The energy at their so-called gatherings is swirling, confusing and heated
>>with types of negativity that actually can molest unsuspecting individuals.

Just a piece of whoevers writing.
Isn't this basically every rave? It kinda sounds like my dancing, (sorry
about hitting all you people with my chain from my keys).


So god doesn't exist. I don't completely belive that. I'm totally against
organized religion. 
People (you, me, them), are all in control of our own lives. We control
eating, sleeping, and other things. There is no entity which says that it's
your time to go. Religion has people all over the world, trying to make
people who don't even understand them convert to their religion. THRY'RE
TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!! I should at least have some clue about it,
my friend is a mormon, with two brothers off as missionaries, a mother who
watches religious cartoons all the time, and a dad whos the Bishop of the
mormon church in our area. I have never seen so many brainwashing books in
one place. Tons of books telling that everyone is evil, that your kid is
going to go to hell if he doesn't go on a mission. Some people just have
problems.
        A bit off the point there:::: So people in some way always have
affect on the outcome of themselves. There is no destiny, fate, or gods will.
You are the one who has the power to make your life happy and long, or shitty
and short. Therefor everyone is god. Everyone is their own supernatural
being. I'm God, people who would happen to believe in me could, but it
doesn't make any diffirence. They're their own gods as well, they just don't
know it yet.
        So anyone thinking that there's a good and evil are wrong. There
isn't. There are bad people who do good things and there are good people who
do bad things. And that doesn't make them evil, or good. They're just who
they choose to be.

        Have a good one!

Greetings Friends!


There's been much discussion internally, (as well as externally I imagine)
about when and if there will be a Friends and Family this summer.

Believe you me that it is the most fervent wish of everyone involved that
there be one soon, yesterday, two months ago.

Alas, spaces, that oh so infamous, and horribly scarce bay area resource,
have not been flowing for us recently, much to our frustration.

My eyes and ears are to the ground, spacewise, and as soon as one flows,
group willing, There Will Be a Party. Meantime should anyone come across
one, I'd love to hear about it =)

take it easy

I wasn't going to be anal and comment on this, but I just drank a bunch of 
coffee, and have diarrhea of the fingers, and it's kind of interesting:
	The Aryans brought the swastika with them when they invaded India from
Europe in pre-Vedic times.  They also spawned the religion of the Vedas, which
eventually evolved into Hinduism.  That's why the Hindus have the swastika, and
that's why Hitler "stole" it (to link Germany with the Aryans, and also because
it was supposed to be some symbol, I can't remember the details of that though).


	But I mostly agree with you.  Symbols are an easy way of proclaiming
your identity, being as they are loaded with meaning and... symbolism, and
imply group membership.  But this same strength is also a great weakness.  
Groups of people are always attacking other groups of people, and how easy it is
to identify and attack groups through their symbols.  Much easier than singling
them out by their viewpoints.  When the Christians wanted to take out the
pagans, they vilified them and then identified all of their symbology with evil,
making it very easy to spot and persecute the bad guys without needing to find
out just what they were really.  Or when someone sees a crucifix and can
easily realize that the wearer is a narrow-minded fool. 
	Of course, there's also the problems of people hiding behind symbols,
and of symbols becoming diluted, but I've already run on way too long and 
semi-coherently, and others have posted plenty.  I just wanted to mention the
Nazi thing :)

It only took a couple of sentences to realize that Wowser's "warning"
about Come/Unity is just a totally predictable provocation by someone
who has come under the wing of one of the cultlike "religious" outfits
out there who are always trying to save us from ourselves so they
can control our lives.  It reeks of the stale manipulative rhetoric
of that tired crowd, the self-loathing, the deceit and the outright
lying about the circumstances involved.

I'm glad to see, therefore, that sfravers are not taking this all too
seriously.  I liked both Neils' outraged and erudite flame, and Black
Adder's sly invitation to check out the *real* action -- the Year of
Hell at Burning Man.  

The whole thing runs counter to the real message of Come/Unity, one I know
Malachy, its founder, subscribes to: *think for yourself.*  That's exactly
what the Purveyors Of Revealed Truth from all ends of the spectrum don't
want us to do.  

For myself, once upon a time Come/Unity *did* have a higher meaning.
It seems to have faded a bit as the crowd and the times changed, but it's
still a great dance party and in these illbegotten times that is good
enough for me.

"Foolishness.  Emptiness.  Powerlessness.  Lies.  Pathetic."  How easily
the words we use as insults tend to describe ourselves . . .

All the same, if Wowser is actually coming to Portland (as another post
indicated), I hope I have a chance to meet him.  Nothing like a good
party to open someone's eyes and let them experience a wider reality
that they understand for themselves, rather than having it handed to
them by some Authority Figure.

Have a great holiday, everyone!

You can't judge the positive message of a religion based on how people can
twist that message to their own needs... You're doing exactly what Hard
Copy did a few months ago when there was a huge stink about their
misrepresentation of the SoCal rave scene, just because some (well, OK,
alot) of ravers take drugs and because some of them use the scene to
fullfill the "teen orgiastic isnane club" angle of the Hard Copy story.
Christianity has brought alot of hapopiness into the world... every
religion has a good message, and every religion has members who fuck up for
their own personal gain. You can't fight human nature.

>Personally, I *LIKE* it when satanic symbols are used at raves. It
>keeps butt-stupid spoon-fed-by-ignorant-lies-to-keep-them-submissive

MTV shock imagery used to get attention? sounds like another Trent Reznor
stunt to me...

I think I have serious problems with the direction this thread is taking...
actually I don't like this discussion at all because no one is actually
reading posts, just looking for parts they disagree with and fanning the
flames with 'em.

yeah, me included. =(

Subject: Look for me at Promise!
To: sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hey all!

Ok, the verdict's in for me.  Promise it is.  1) I will much more enjoy 
the dj's listed for Promise cuz I just couldn't get into ComeUnity's 
music the last time I attended.  2) ComeUnity only goes till 4 am, and 
I hear you hafta wait till at least 2 or 3 am to lose the clubbier 
types, and that only leaves me one hour of an actual rave!  So off to 
Promise I go.  

It appears Promise is at 2519 Mission, I am interested in Kathryn's 
question of bustability, does anybody know this area?  Just curious.

Anyway, look for me & come say hi!  I'll probably be wearing my comfy 
jeans as usual and a grey tank top, and I will have a bunch of shit 
around my neck, including my old-style sfraves laminate, my new FnF 
patch (produced by the Wonderful Tony Rotundo :), my Basics ticket from 
their party a few months ago, and my People!  These people consist of 
three little plastic clippy people of three different colors, and they 
rave with me wherever I rave. :)  Lastly I usually almost always have a 
hot-pink glow stick around my neck, and its possible I may dancing 
wildy with two of them.  So come say hi!

Love,
Shawna

I'm gonna head to Freedom on Saturday with some people, and I'd love to 
meet some more sfraves folks!  

How to recognize me?  Um, I'm about 6', long brown hair and glasses, and 
I'll wear (ah, what's clean?) um, a black Teeshirt with a purple lotus 
flower on the front, and tan baggypants...  and I'll wear a BIIIG smile.

;-)

Please come say hi!

love
john

Troy, I smell the words Christian hysteria in your post and the only

I think you're putting words in my mouth. I may share some opinions
with Liberals, but I don't think I can call myself a Liberal. Look
where the lamo liberal/conservative axis has gotten us? It's two poles
of the same thing as far as I'm concerned. Most things in the human
realm that split into polar opposites occur because both "sides" are
wrong and haven't found the solution. Then they end up fighting each
other's dogmas rather than solve the problems at hand. I'm still
looking for the center that is right. (and in the mean time, I'm going
to vote for Ralph Nader).

> Let the man believe in God, let him not 
> go to Come/Unity, but dont tell him to go fuck himself as you did.

They're just words, jerky. I wasn't holding him hostage at gunpoint. He
can choose to read or not read, respond or not respond at his own
opinion. He used words too. Words that insinuated that we are "evil"
and need to be "saved" and that he in his infinite, psychotic wisdom is
able to see through all the "swirling confusion" and find the ultimate
source -- SATAN! I'll tell him and any other Christian that takes this
path to go fuck himself in new and unimaginable ways. He basically told
me I'm fucked, and I feel like I have a right to respond to his idiotic
insinuations. This is how I thank him for his insightful warnings
into the true nature of things.

If he wants to be a Christian in his heart and in his mind then I'll
happily let him be. I have plenty of respect for "Christians" that have
a faith, understand it, and FOLLOW IT WITHOUT HYPOCRICY AND WITHOUT
TRYING TO CONVERT OTHER PEOPLE. Jesus' supposed teachings, and those of
Rabbi Hillel and the Essenes was a GOOD message that got twisted into a
"swirling confusion" of lies by a bunch of greedy, hypocritical,
hateful, child-molesting, adulterous assholes that now call themselves
Christians.
 
I don't know about you, but I'm the kind of "liberal" that believes
that a good verbal ass-kicking is the best defense against stupid
unenlightened opinions.
 
I don't preach love my neighbor -- I leave that bit of hypocricy to the
Christians who like to pretend "love" between sessions of theft, lies,
greed, gay-bashing, race-baiting, and taunting/denigrating those that
don't believe in their shared mass-psychosis. They preach love like
they put on their "Sunday gone-a-meetin' best" clothes before they go
to Church -- to give the impression of unity, conformity, and decency.
But  when they get back to their own world, they're typically back to
their base human instincts of greed, deceit, and lust. And typically,
they're back at it with a vengeance due to the fact that their
instincts were repressed while they're putting on a public show of
"being a good christian". This is why I think most Christians suck the
big hairy donkey dick.

> Its  
> really funny how fucking liberals like you are nothing but HYPOCRITS!
> you talk about PLUR, and here you are telling him he's a bad person for  
> believe in christianity.

There you go calling me a liberal again. Are you some kind of
politician? I call him a "bad person" because he's trying to convert
people and tell them that their pagan rituals are evil/bad; that he's
seen the light and that we're so stupid and unenlightened as to have
not noticed the presence of SATAN in our midst! (If I ever see Satan,
I'll be happy to tell him to get the fuck out of my face and get back
to giving Jesus a rim-job with his long forked tongue.)

I never talk about PLUR, except to make fun of it (go read the
archives). PLUR is just like Christian hypocricy, a lofty ideal which
cannot be practiced, but at least it allows people to intellectualize
how they would like to be perceived by others (so they can have more
friends, get laid, be popular, or whatever).

help that my roommate Jerry was rubbing it in my face as well (bless his
soul). To satisfy my dietary requirements for raving, I was planning on
attending Come/Unity last night.

At the last moment, I got a call from my fiancee, who told me that two of
our friends (who are engaged, and were planning to marry this fall) have to
get married this weekend, because the INS is holding a shotgun to the
bride-to-be's head!

As a result, I'm off to Lake Tahoe with them, and didn't go raving last
night at all. However, I'll be back in time to make it to Freedom! Yea! I'll
be wearing a t-shirt with multicolored patterns of NYC Subway tokens (sort
of Andy Warhol style), and my laminate. Hope to see y'all there.

George

P.S. Hope everyone who raved last night, either at Come/Unity, The Promise,
or wherever, had a great vibe. Reviews, please!

w/r/t to the "come/unity warning" thread... here's christianity for ya!
--------------------
Date:    Thu, 27 Jun 1996 23:39:36 -0700
From:    Andreas Ramos <andreas@NETCOM.COM>
Subject: Religion at an early age...

After Mandoki asked what to do about his boy growing up among Colombian
Catholics and then someone recommending that this is a Christian world, I
wrote the following. Now, remember, folks, I grew up in Tennessee, among
Baptists. This isn't about theology or some tract from the 1920s. This is
what it's like to grow up among Baptists. If you don't like it, well,
it's anarchy week.

I never met a Baptist minister who didn't have the morals of a snake. The
principal of our grade school was a Baptist minister and quite possibly
the most evil man I've ever known. Aside from daily hiding behind a tree
to dash out and attack us school boys at random with a stick and sexually
molesting just about every girl, he drove two black brothers out of our
school; one ended up drowning in a pond, where he'd gone in loneliness,
since he couldn't go to school. The minister's wife finally found out that
he was fucking eleven year old girls; she accused him in church one Sunday
morning. We know that Satan truely walks the face of the Earth; he sweet
talked the whole congregation into falling upon their knees and praying
and weeping for his salvation. Not a damned thing happened. He continued as
minister and principal.

Baptist friends would try to convert us as kids; my brother finally
figured out that it was only because they felt that they would get points
with Jesus. They really didn't care about us, whether we were truely
converted or not. As kids, we learned very quickly that when some damned
Salvation tent was in town, the Baptists would be intolerable with their
eagerness to find someone to convert. They'd lay their sweaty hands on
your knee and ask if Jesus was truely the King of Your Heart. If you said
no, they'd weep and pray and drive you crazy and every time you said no,
more of the fools would join the prayer circle. So we learned to lie like
their ministers and shout "o yea!  Jesus is in my heart! Hallelujah!" and
they'd give a half-hearted hallelujah and walk off, to find a jew to
convert. My brothers and I told the few Jewish and Catholic kids what we'd
discovered and after that, they didn't bother us any more. Sweet Jesus!

To this day, I still know quite a bit of the Bible. Our teachers often
read it to us; one teacher did nothing else except read the Bible to us
every day. We saw that the Bible was just rhetorical phrases that the
Baptists used to justify whatever they wanted to do: bomb the gooks in
Vietnam ("Let us PRAY for our sons and brothers who are Fighting For Jesus
in Vietnam!"), beat the shit out of the gays before the school football
games, or get some girl to suck their pecker. I remember listening to the
Baptist boys laugh about this: "oh, Lisa, I don't know, I... I... well,
maybe I don't feel that Jesus is in my heart, but... if you give me a blow
job, I'd try REAL HARD to let Jesus into my heart!" and all the boys would
fall on the floor, laughing. One girl was the blow job queen of the
school; she did the whole baseball team one night to save their souls and
win The Big Game. Blow jobs for Jesus!

Baptist girls were totally amoral: they found out that they could do
anything for Jesus. The girls at school knew that the best way to get some
hot action time with the ministers was to ask for private Bible study.

My brother was very good at ranting like a minister: "And I say ha!
Jesus is Lord ha! Open your hearts ha!" and he could get a crowd whipped
into a frenzy of hatred against this or that and take up a collection
which he usually spent on booze or Rolling Stones albums.

We all know about the TV ministers who tied themselves to a cheap motel
bed and let themselves be whipped into orgasms by black hookers or who
were using the church money to keep their mistresses in expensive
apartments. Anyone heard about Jesus Land? Some damned minister went
around in the early 70s, pointing out to farmers and their wives that the
sinners in Los Angeles had Las Vegas and the New York Jews had Disneyland
in Florida, but there wasn't a proper place for a God-fearing Christian
family to go. He'd roll out the ground plans for Jesus Land: a family
theme park for Jesus: streets paved with gold where children dressed up
like angels, with little wings, would sell fishes and loaves; a Noah's Ark
with elephants and giraffes, and a 500 foot revolving illuminated Jesus,
that could be seen clear all the way to Atlanta! Lordy! And the farmers
would press their money into his blessed hands.  The fellow fled the
country with millions. It was all a scam.

The captain of the high school football team, who was our neighbor, and a
very nice kid, turned out to be gay; his Baptist family threw him out of
the house. He was found a year later, naked, dead, with his head in an gas
oven in a fleabag hotel. He was buried alone, which just goes to show you
what happens to sick people like that. Praise the Lord!

So... how to raise a kid in a religious world? If the little bastard has
any brains, he'll figure it out.

Actually, Burning Man doesn't really sound like it's gonna be what
raving is all about.  5 competing sound systems; so much
for unity.  The Burning Man organizers don't really want us
there (please move away another mile) and don't want to hear our
music (please point it away from us), but who cares?  

Let's face it, there will be 2 separate events out there; Burning Man
with its "Hell" theme, whatever that means, and the rave camp.  I'm
sure being there will be loads of fun, even spiritual.  Most people will
probably find what they are looking for.

Some people enjoy wearing daipers, others follow the crowd.  Each to 
their own.

Mmm...  I can't agree with you Neils.  PLUR is definitely a lofty ideal, but 
it fits in as a subset of the teachings of Jesus and of the Torah -- and 
don't get me wrong, I'm not spouting televangalist propaganda here.  As you 
yourself stated, Jesus' message was not about hate.  The Torah says 
something to the effect of "do not to others what you wouldn't want done to 
you" and Jesus paraphrased it with the "Golden Rule", "do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you".  In my way of thinking, if you're reaching for 
these truly lofty ideals, you've got PLUR covered.

I do believe in a higher being, but I dislike organized religion as much as 
the next guy.  I don't think putting the label "Christian", "Muslem", 
"Buddhist", etc.,  on someone automatically makes them a good person, and 
organized religion has been used throughout history to control people 
through their fears and ignorance.  But at the same time those labels don't 
make that person evil either.  Good intentioned and maybe a little weak, but 
not evil.

I thank the original poster for the information.  To his way of thinking, he 
was looking out for us.  I hope he won't be too offended if I don't find it 
particularly useful.  I didn't go to ComeUnity, but only because it just 
gets too darned crowded and hot.

 The URL I posted was "http://www.istorm.com/burningman" , and it comes right
off of an official Burning Man publication that is sitting next to my computer
as I type this. It may be that xlr8r has old info or got the URL phonetically

 Probably typical web access gremlins - try again. Don't forget that even when
you get to the page, their graphics may take awhile to download for viewing.

I always imagined that one important thing that raving is all about
is accepting that everyone and everything is different and letting
everything go free.  Which means that people who decide that Burning Man
isn't for them are no less important or mature than people who do go.
and shame on you for suggesting otherwise.

I would probably not enjoy a world that was Burning Man year round,
as much as I would not enjoy a world without a Burning Man.

Let everyone make their own choice.

 I called the Chateau de Boom info number a half-hour ago [ (415) 572-3250 ],
and got some old message from last week. Not a good sign for an event that is
supposed to have started two hours ago at noon. Anybody have any real info
on this event?

dude, I remember reading the *exact* same elitist bullshit last year. 
Something along the lines of only the cool kids were at Burning Man and 
everyone who went to Basics was a poser. someone can check me on this, 
but I even think it was a Tristan who posted it as well. Fuck that.

Just because you have the means and drive to make it does *not* make you 
a better person or a better human being. Not everybody has the same 
health or economic resourses that you may. 

instead of making condesending remarks, I'm thankful that I've got all my 
limbs intact, a good back, some cool friends, and a bit of cash for my trip. 
There are enough assholes in this world, you really don't need to add to 
their numbers.

I just wanted to relate some brief (you can start laughing now)
impressions of my experience at the Orbital / Underworld show in San
Francisco last night, with maybe a brief jog into discussing last
Friday's Chemical Brothers show.

I had a great time. I mean, a _really_ great time. I haven't danced this
hard since last October's great Friends and Family party. I was a fish on
a line all night long (aka: hooked), and was only briefly able to stop
dancing.  Everything about the show kept me moving, from the tight (if
overly treble-heavy) sound, the great lighting and video, and the
MUSIC. My goodness, the music.

So, specifics. I got to the show at around 9:00. Either Jonah Sharpe
didn't play live or he was the gent with the short-cropped hair dropping
the hard funked Detroit jams. I have to give that guy props. He may
always be riding the current trend (and make no mistake - the Detroit
sound is _very_ trendy amongst the SF techno elite right now. Big ups to
Jon Santos and Joe Rice for being two of the biggest perpetrators behind
this fashion conspiracy), but he does it with style and (dare I say it)
panache. I approved.

The DJ that followed him, though, completely knocked my shit right
out. From step one he started dropping the cold, dark techno jams that
give me body rushes and make me jerk spasmodically. Cool, precise mixes
of tons of material on Reload records (the choice of discerning darkcore
beat junkies everywhere), and a few notable surprises (of which I will
write more anon). He was exceptional (in my incredibly arrogant opinion
-- I imagine that many of my compatriots at the show were less than
thrilled. TOO BAD. I was happier than a pig in slop ;). I didn't know
they let DJs like that play in SF. Does anybody have any clue who he was?

Somewhere along there the DJ winked out and Orbital clambered up to take
the stage. As has been mentioned, one of the two Ps was wearing a laser
pointer strapped to his flashlight glasses. He did funny things with it
all night, but really, who gives a shit?

Orbital were all about THE MUSIC. The lights were great, the video was
just as good as I was led to expect, but oh dear, I got my ass rocked by
the sounds pounding their way away from the speakers. I mean, they
_started_ with my current favorite Orbital song ("Out There Somewhere")
and proceeded to methodically work their way through the high points of
their already very high-point-laden catalog. The reworks of "Choice" and
"Satan" were particularly tasty, although I thought my ears were going to
jump off and make a run for the hills during the more trebly bits of
"Satan". Ouch. And, of course, they played "Halcyon" with the magic
little Belinda Carlisle bit, which probably would have affected me more
profoundly had I not already been expecting it. They finished with a
encore consisting of "Planet of the Shapes" and one of the songs off of
_Snivilization_ that I never bothered to learn the name of (me? dislike
_Snivilization_? Whatever made you think that?). I think that otherwise
their set was probably note-for-note the same as the set they did in LA.

I personally could have handled a tiny bit more reworking of Orbital's
material. I could hear what they were up to sometimes, but I think a lot
of the subtler knob-twiddling got lost, and it was sort of odd knowing
exactly where all of the breaks were going to occur. It was life-
affirming hearing the artists that made me decide that I wanted to be a
DJ play their music REAL LOUD through a big sound system, but I thought
one of the positive things about techno was that it encouraged
experimentation, right?

One thing that their video made much more explicit was that Orbital is
unusually political for techno artists. The video made explicit many
points about consumer culture, the power of symbols in our culture, and
our overweening blindness in the face of rampant environmental
destruction. I don't think I'm just pulling that out of my butt,
either. Some of it would have been difficult to misinterpret (like all of
the shots of guys with chainsaws cutting down trees, f'rinstance).

In any case, Orbital were exactly as stunning as I expected them to be,
and I could have gotten down on my knees and wept at the beauty of it
all, but I was too busy dancing and whooping and generally making an ass
of myself to be bothered with such maudlin sentiment (those of you who
were there -- I was the tall geeklike person with the pony-tail, packer
boots, and the bright cheery Public Image Limited T shirt who kept
screaming and had the amateur obstacle course set up next to his feet).

After Orbital left the stage, That DJ started up again, spinning more
incredible hard traxxy mean-spirited techno stuff, including (drum roll
please) the Prodigy remix of Front 242's "Religion". Keep the crossover
indeed. Both I and the recently-transplanted Midwesterner I was with were
well pleased and grinning like idiots at the surprisingly good music.
Don't get me wrong -- there are a lot of really good technohead DJs in
San Francisco, but I prefer a harder / more abstract sound than what most
people here spin, and it was good to hear some of my favorite tunes spun
loud.

After an interminable break while the road crew tore down Orbital's
incredibly huge stage setup and set up Underworld's marginally less
complex array of gear, Messrs Smith, Hyde, and Emerson took to the stage,
looking cheery and happy to be there. At this point, I was standing up on
the balcony, so was able to see what they were doing on stage, which was
basically live mixing of presequenced material. Don't forget that Darren
Emerson is a DJ first and foremost. I kinda wondered why they bothered
doing it that way, considering that it would have been just as easy to
sequence everything, but as they warmed to what they were doing they got
more fluid with the mixing and it all made sense.

They had a buttload of gear up on stage which I could be a faithful
little trainspotter for y'all and detail, but I won't. Suffice it to say
that they had the usual array of trendy techno gear, and my partner in
crime for the evening spent a good chunk of time torturing himself,
trying to decide if the little Roland box mounted vertically in one of
their rackmount cases was a 303 or a 606. He finally decided that it was
a 606 when he saw Karl Hyde tweaking the cymbals on it late in the
show. I'd much earlier decided that it really wasn't worth worrying
about. I will say for thems that's curious that they were making very
prominent (and obnoxious) use of a Nord Lead throughout the evening, and
made me decide that I need one of those, monophonic or not. They
certainly do make some jaggedly analogesque noises. I'll also say that it
was cool that the only use that I saw for the guitar that Mr. Hyde was
hauling around stage with him was to act as the frequency input for the
vocoder on his voice. I thought that was a neato change of pace.

They played a very long set of very dancy material, which suited me just
fine, because I was, in fact, there to dance. I personally thought that
the vocals were a perfect counterpoint for the music, but I think that we
established long ago that there are those that like Underworld's vocals
and those that find them superfluous and annoying. I'm one of the former.
High points for me included a great, extended version of "Pearls Girl"
and a nicely-done encore of "Cowgirl" and "Rez" played back to
back. Hearing "Rez" was a very intensely nostalgic moment for me. If
Underworld deserves to be remembered for only one thing, it's definitely
that song.

What struck me most about Underworld was the enthusiasm they brought to
their set. While Orbital were content to bob their heads energetically
and occasionally confer with each other, Underworld were positively goofy
with energy. All three of them were bobbling enthusiastically around the
stage, with Karl and Darren pausing periodically to hype up the crowd.
When Karl wasn't singing, he was running around the stage like Moby or
something. It was fun to watch. And, of course, getting to see the Tomato
video was cool, although it was pretty obvious that the videos were
intended to be set to different songs than the ones that were currently
playing (a disadvantage when a) your song has words and b) those words
are integrated pretty heavily into the video).

What was remarkable to me was that in the past two years I've gone from
being a die-hard anti-fan of Underworld's to thinking that they are
positively the bees' knees. The vocals used to _really_ get on my nerves
and the music didn't do much for me, but once again, as they finished off
Rez I was just about fit to cry (and just about to fall over, too -- I
haven't danced that hard in a LOOONG time).

I hadn't really thought about what an important show this was to me until
I was there last night, but both of these bands have played pivotal roles
in my musical development. If it hadn't been for Orbital, I never would
have decided to indulge my musical fanatacism and become a DJ, and if it
hadn't been for the amazing singles that Underworld put out a couple
years ago ("Spoon [Deep Mix]" anyone?), I'd be a much different sounding DJ
now. It was a good night.

As a brief side note, I did go to see Chemical Brothers last Friday
night, and they did in fact go straight for the throat. Those kids do
_not_ fuck around. Bombastic beats, dark atmospheres, and light-show
imagery rife with images of death, destruction, and repression.
Considering how often their music is played by jolly la-di-da handbag
club DJs, it was surprising how much their set made me think of a
different kind of club altogether. Most excellent, especially the new
material, which wasn't quite so {hip|trip|crip}-hop oriented. After they
got into a groove they even seemed to be having fun. I think I saw one of
them smile once or twice.

They also had another wonderful opening DJ (this time DJ Terminator, who
played excellent hardstep jungle with good humor, despite the fact that
he was in the lighting booth up near the ceiling, had no monitor, and
therefore had absolutely no idea what his mixing sounded like).
Unfortunately, the [expletive deleted] Trocadero had its usual quirks,
this time being a dishwater-dull crowd and some very irritating sound
system problems. I'm sorry, but every time I see the name "Blasthaus" on
a flyer, I _know_ the party's going to be full of the sort of irritating
faux-hipsters (which I guess could be shortened by the omission of the
"faux-") guaranteed to set my teeth on edge. Maybe I'm an opinionated,
easily-irritated codger, though. Maybe.

I _was_ surprised at how friendly and cheerful the Trocadero doorfolk
were, I will admit. But now that I think about it, they've always been
nice to me, even when they've been firmly telling me (f'rinstance) that I
can't bring my pepper spray into the club. Maybe I just look close enough
to Goth to pass. Maybe I just relate well to shaven-head death-metal
headz. I shrug.

yrz,
ozymandias

onNow: sqpr - "tundra" / "dimotane co" (I have a feeling I like a
   completely different album than the rest of you, because tracks like
   these are peachy, but Mr. Jenkinson could drop his bass out the window
   and I'd still like the album just as much. In fact, the reason I like
   this album as much as I do has to do with its strong resemblance to
   works by *cough* Aphex Twin or *cough* *cough* Mu-Ziq more than any
   resemblance to the current crop of ambient jazz innovative listening
   progressive intelligent dolphin softstep jungle-meisters.)

Dear All;

	Ok, enough of you have asked me this ?; and I firmly believe there should be no secrets, plus I 
can't keepem; no doubt this will be my Nemisis. I'm also in much more of a secure position than I was a 
few months ago. So who is THX1138; some of you guessed it right of the bat, I think fellow hacker Wayne 
D. Coerria was the first person to find me, without asking, he's a good computer guy. 
THX1138@planet-jubip.com = Brian DarknEs^2, planet-jubip.com is my site on the net. Pronouced ja-bip, 
it's an east coast expression, and refers to a place in the middle of no where that everyone has been to 
at one point or another in their life. My B-day present to all of you who were wondering, remember Fred 
H. when he said, "no one knows you're a CAD in Cyberspace."

	The withholding of the knowledge of who I was, was strictly a personal decision at the time and 
was not designed in anyway to maliciously try and deceive anyone, just protect myself.

	But like I said I'm sure most of you knew this.

Peace & Love From Across Cyberspace

[ to sfraves list ]

 All the years I've posted stuff to mailists and newsgroups, I've never
managed to say something that was upsetting enough to get flamed about
( that I can remember ). So, it's ironic that it took my last few days
on SFRaves to get my first ever flame! 

 In reply to my request :
"...Well, if anyone could give me some suggestions one way or another 
( Go To BM/Don't Go To BM ), I'd appreciate it. Since this topic is only 
vaguely rave-related ( I know that at least one crew is going to hold a 
rave at BM ) , please email me with your suggestions - "

 ( Thanks to you folks who did reply ) The most unique reply came recently 
in a post to sfraves from Tristan/sandoz@sfsu.edu ( who may be the same
person who used to use Kevin Keiper's account ??? ): 
> 
> Anyone who does not like burning man and is not going to go when they 
> could has totally no idea as to what raving is all about and should, to 
> put it bluntly, go back home to mother as soon as possible.  At BUrning 
> man music and nature are one and that is what raving is all about.  NO 
> offence guy but do you still wear dypers?
> Tristan.

[ a question on terminology here: Have I been the recipient of what the
  british call "taking the piss" ? ]

 I've decided to treat this post as an attempt to convince me to go to BM.
I will assume that , deep down inside, maybe Tristan has my best interests
to heart. I don't have time for a detailed reply ( going out to enjoy the 
4th of July holiday ), but let me try to do short replies to the points being
made:

1. Being a true raver implies liking Burning Man: 
   * Assumes I don't like the idea of Burning Man. Quoting from a BM 
   newsletter - "...so is the festival itself a blank canvas for the 
   creative energy of its participants. The possibilities for self-expression 
   are nearly limitless." What I focus on in that quote are the words 
   "creative energy" and "self-expression".  Sounds good to me! Problem is
   I have personal issues that get in the way of me getting into the
   creative mindset in time for BM.
   * Implies that if I don't go, I'm not a true raver. If that's what 
   Tristan and others think, it's OK by me. Their opinion is not required
   to validate the raver portions of my life.  

2. A rave out on the playa is in nature:
   * From the descriptions, the Black Rock playa during the time of BM 
   is sterile; free of plants, animals , and ( I'm guessing here ) even 
   insect life. Probably has some hard-scrabble bacteria that come to life for 
   a few hours when it rains.  In my view, this makes the playa-as-nature idea 
   about as valid as SPAM-as-haute-cuisine. The world's biggest warehouse 
   rave with mud on the floor. 
   * How linked to exterior non-man nature is a spiritual path that's 
   dependant on the generator working reliably ?

3. Avoiding BM will prove me to be a sissy:
   * I guess this is an attempt to convince me to go by shaming me. That would 
   work if the folks who would think that I'm a sissy/wuss/wimp for not going
   were known to me, and were my friends. To take Tristan as an example, I'm 
   never met him , so have never formed a bond with him. His opinion of me 
   therefore doesn't matter in this case. 

 OOPS! Spent too much time on this. I think that's enough analysis for now!

the lad with the T shirt with the Russky and the megaphone on it. I'll
probably also be trying to dance painfully, too. Last night took a lot

Hey everybody!

Happy Independence Day!!!!!!!(Anyone see the movie?)

It's a beautiful day here in the south bay...so I hope everybody gets a 
chance to BBQ, relax, and enjoy the weather wherever you are.

I  also hope you're all planning to go to Freedom. I'd *love* to see a 
large contingency of SF Ravers there.....yeah! That would be beautiful! 
I don't know what I'll be wearing, But I have a backpack with blinking 
LEDS across it. Come say "Hi!" and pick up a laminate! 

oh and pleez, watch out for stray fireworks tonight! ;)

Hugs,

I wish I had the patience to reply to flames with as much insight as
Larry did!

As many of you know, Burning Man is not my cup-o-T, and I've never
felt any particular need to explain why.  It's one of those things
that I could never pinpoint in explainable terms, yet I really feel
it strongly.  I like reading about it and enjoy the descriptions of
those who've attended, who nearly universally have at least an
amazing time.  All the same . . .

I'm sorry but this has to be the _most_ immature and pointlessly
destructive post I have _ever_ seen on the list.  Why did you feel the
need to respond to Larry's sensitive description of his personal
thoughts and feelings like this?  I just don't get it...:(

In fact it makes me so mad that I don't even know what to say.

Get a life Tristan...

When returning to my room after a moonlight swim in Lake Anza, a message 
from Justin was waiting. 
	"Hey, you wanna go to promise?"
	"Sure"
So we were off, Justin, Sami, and I. We arrived at the location close to 
12:30 maybe, were let past the security gate, climbed the stairs, and 
entered a most incredible location for a party. After paying the ten 
bucks (twice as much as i had ever paid for a party in sf), we wandered 
into a room that looked very much like an apartment minus furnature, with 
a stereo set up and some non-ravey style music playing. We found the way 
down a staircase and entered a small room with many couches and 
blacklights and carpet and a little window through which a dj could be seen 
spinning dubby-triphoppy type stuff. I chilled to the music a bit, but 
found it a little to fast for chilling and a little to slow for dancing. 
However, my ears had picked up on another bass line, and I followed the 
sound to "the main room" equipped with larger sound and intelligent 
lighting and a trance-spinnin dj. Immediately I dropped into a trance of 
my own and swam to the front where the decks were set up and danced and 
inadvertently bumped off innocent bystanders who had wandered a little 
too close for saftey. When approching dehydration, I headed back up to 
the top floor where an automated ambient room had emerged, with a cd 
player playing chill-out tracks. Unlike most parties, where the sound of 
the main room usually drove through the walls in to the ambient room, now 
two soundsystems found their way into the chillout space, but that was 
ok. Eventually, the ambience stopped and a silly cd started up, which was 
not ok, so I journeyed back downstairs and bounced around the two other 
rooms. (btw, although the automated style of the chill space was unique, 
and ambient dj would have been much cooler...and not too hard to get, most
ambient dj's are used to playing for 8 hours for free:) Anyway, I'm not 
sure if I can describe in words how rad this party was. The main room 
featured trance and house while the other room specialized in slower 
triphop n' dub n' stuff. There were lots of big couches and sofas and 
someone would run in and out of the main room with a milk crate full of 
free bottled water for those dancing a little to hard!! The sound was 
perfect, not too loud which keep things safe from cops and earaches. The 
size of the space was perfect as well, and there were just the right 
number of people to fill it, with enough room for breathing and dancing 
(well, maybe the smaller room was a little too small..) I borrowed 
Justin's digital camera and ran around taking pictures of everyone and 
everything and blinding the innocent and unsuspecting with my flash. 
Several familiar faces were present, including a few with names (Justin, 
Sami, Sara, Todd, Jess, etc. etc.) This was obiviously a very spiritual 
event for many, with a statue of Ganesha in front of the DJ in the main 
room, and several girls were whearing a pottu on their forehead, in a 
bizarre display of neo-Hinduism (the pottu's were red..?) At around 
three'ish, they stopped charging money for admission. For me, the party 
really took off at around four or four-thirty. The music in the main room 
became much too housey so i drifted into the smaller room to discover 
incredible drum & bass radiating from the soundsystem, and fell head-first 
into a speaker for quite a long time. All the sets were good. The space was 
good. Everything was good. Perfect, even. This was my second 
Spacechildren party (the first being the Oribtal/Underworld show) and my 
second indoor party in sf(!) (the first being the Orbital/Underworld 
show. Somehow the parties I go to while in the bay area are _all_ 
outdoors. I guess all our midwest parties are inside). I thank everyone 
involved in throwing this party, and possibly I'll see you tonight at 
packabowl, and then later at freedom or the light campout. Take care

I suppose hipocracy is an unavoidable human issue, without it we would have
little reason to QUESTION OURSELVES AND OUR MOTIVES.

Niels Mayer also said:  >>I never talk about PLUR, except to make fun of it

which cannot be practiced...<<

Could the peace I can find within myself be an illusion,  is the love I have
for my brothers and sisters a front of some sort?  The unity we felt at the

give up the respect that I'm giving you and your opinion, and make rude and
derogartory comments about your beliefs?
Nope.

First off... Tristan, you're a CUNT 
 (I've been waiting to use that word for the right person). 
Congratulations... I have to look no further! 
 
It seems to me that you've not even listened to Larry or tried to
understand him at all.    
 
Larry was kind enough to open up and share with us his feelings about his
decision not to go to burning man and why he's decided to slow down in the
Rave scene.  There's nothing negative to say about that.  He didn't have to
tell us at all.  And for that reason, what Larry chose to share with us as
well as any other personal beliefs and opinions, should be respected. 
 
If you disagree with Larry's views and values, then that's YOUR fucking
problem.  His decision has NOTHING to do with you at all.  And most
definately does not deserve a IMMATURE, negative response like yours,
Tristan. 
 
You just seem too occupied with your elitist "True Raver" attitude.  Well,
let me give you a clue, Tristan.  You're no "True Raver" to me.  So far
your attidude contradicts just about everything I believe Raving is all
about. 
 
It's not about cutting up people for sharing what they're feeling.  It's
about respecting people for thery're feelings and providing support and
other positive or constuctive types of feedback.  If you don't agree with a
person's beliefs, and can't think of a decent way to let them know... then
keep it up your ass. 
 
>NO offence guy but do you still wear dypers? 
Maybe you should be asking this of yourself.  It seems to me your need
something down there to hold all your BULLSHIT.

At no similer event in the US will you find such a diversity of people 
then at burning man.  Everyone is there: from bikers to ravers.  Mothers 
go with there kids; ravers who haven't seen eachother for years meet up.  
People who last saw eachother at a party in India or Tailand then see 
eachother there.  Here, people take acid or E for the forst time, hear 
rave music for the first time.  And ravers get to meet other kinds of 
people that they would not normally meet.  In one of the most barren 
places on Earth we bring life and love in the form of the universal 
umbrella of love that all people like us (weather they like rave muisc or 
not) are under.  Remember: rave culture is a truely world wide phenomina 
and burning man (together with maybe the Rainbow gathering) is America's 
contribution to it (like Glastonbury festival in England and the techno 
fests in Europe).  In short, burning man is not some regular kiddy rave; 
it is a universal gathering of the clan.  And, to me, this is what raving 
is all about; it is why I got involved in the rave scene in the first 
place.  Is that not why everyone on this list is a raver too?
And this is why I get so angry when I hear people who won't go to it 
because they don't like to go a few day's without there creature 
comforts.  Eight months ago I went to a party in the dessrt in India to 
celebrate the lunar eclipse where there were a thousand people and there 
was not even a toilet let alone clean drinking water.  This fact did not 
in the slightest bother any of the people there so why is burning man 
such a problem for people?
  Yes, there is a lot of sound systems (that's what a techno fest is all 
about); the more the merrier I say.  But at burning man I have felt a 
unifying vibe that I have never felt at anyother event in America 
(although I used to feel it a lot whan I was doing parties in England) 
and I feel very sorry, as well as slightly confused, that other people on 
this list do not share these same sentiments.  Burning man serves to 
remind us that we are merely a part of the overall world-wide rave 
culture.  But oh yeah, I forgot, this is America where no-one likes the 
idea that  poples of other countries have got it going on even more, or 
at any rate as much, then they do.  Sad but true I'm afraid.  
I hope that everyone on this list comes to burning man where they will 
feel a vibe at a party that one can simply not find anywhere else at a 
party/festival in the US.  If people do not agree with the above words 
then I really can not understand why they are into raving in the first 
place. 
See ya all at burning man.
Tristan.

So, here in Chicago, it seems that every other event has DRC from San 
Francisco in the lineup. While I know I've never heard her spin in SF 
(quite possibly because SF is much more sophisticated than the House 
stuff they play here), I'm wondering if anybody's ever heard her play in 
SF.

I'm sorry but this has to be the _most_ immature and pointlessly
destructive post I have _ever_ seen on the list.  Why did you feel the
need to respond to Larry's sensitive description of his personal
thoughts and feelings like this?  I just don't get it...:(

In fact it makes me so mad that I don't even know what to say.

Get a life Tristan...

 Ranting and Raving (I guess :(...)

 He has some good points , that I'd like to give my reply to in a fuller
post soon. Before that , here's what I think is the most compelling part
of his follow-up posting -

It's too bad love seems to be in short supply on this list...  Your comment 
about dead Christians was pure vitriol, and is in complete opposition to the 
sentiment stated above.  I think you should reexamine your views on PLUR.  
If PLUR was all you ever managed, you'd probably be a better human being.

>Is that not why everyone on this list is a raver too?

To go to Burning Man?  Nope.  I got involved because of the love and 
acceptance I found, and the unifying drive to gather, to enjoy really good 
and hugely varied music, and especially to dance without all the hangups 
that go with dancing at your typical club.  Why did I stay involved?  
Because of the wonderful people I found once I got here.

>But at burning man I have felt a

Geez, I'm sorry that's the case.  I felt it at Sunset, the New Moon Rave, 
the Tahoe Trip(!), Tim's BBQ, Beautiful People, Chrysalis, Tribal Funk, 
etc., etc., etc.

Tristan, I haven't been raving for years, but along the short path I've 
taken thus far I've only found a very few people on this list I didn't care 
to meet and make friends of.  Until you find it within yourself to be more 
accepting and less exclusionary and judgemental, I'm afraid I have to number 
you among them.  And if you are typical of the kind of mentality I'd find at 
Burning Man, I really don't see the point in going.

Oh yeah, those red pottus come from the kit "Instant Brahmin -- just
add E-tabs" available at finer rave-shops throughout the bay area.

A few hours after becoming an instant brahmin, those rave girls are off
singing "love means never having to wear your sari". Very enlightening!

	Well made it out to my first Pack-a-Bowl last night and it was
loads of fun. I havent bowled in at least 6 or 7 years so it was weird.
But by the end of the night I had remeber the correct form and made a
couple of strikes and spares. Made some SFRavers: Renaud and Jess.
Man can Jess go offf. You got a lot of energy in you girl. Also
interesting to see some hardcore for the first time in SF. Loads of fun.
Mars spined later but I dont know what happened to that Mars vs Mystr-e
thing. Anyone know? In anycase see you all at Light.

Hey, hey!

I finally went to a night rave for the first time since I got back from 
Croatia.  Although it was at 1015 and the crowd wasn't my favorite one 
(having my butt grabbed more than once while walking around the dance 
floor isn't really what I expect at raves), I still had a great time and 
was happy to be back in SF.

I hang out with Leslie and she said hi to everybody.  I hope she gets an 
account soon :).

ComeUnity was fun - it was packed and it stayed that way till 4am (when I 
left).  The music was good and I had a great time dancing.  The only 
problem about ComeUnity is that the place is so packed that dancing with 
glow-sticks is more difficult than at some other places.  The outdoor 
area is great because you can always go out and cool off (which is 
necessary after some dancing).  Not having to go to work the next day was 
also great.  There should be more holidays on Thursday :))).

About BM - I am going because I saw a video from 2 years ago and it 
looked very interesting and all my friends cannot stop talking about it.  
I think it will be a fun experiance and I can't wait to go.  Only 2 
months :)).  

Have a great weekend and hope to see some of you at Freedom.

Also, I would just like to voice my opinion about flames on the list.  I 
think that is not necessary and I think everybody should just try to 
tolerate others a little bit more.  Why call each other names and try to 
hurt each others feelings?  I am really getting sick of reading posts 
on sfraves that show bitterenes of poeple towards life and others.  What 
about PLUR that everybody is talking about?  Maybe if there is something 
one doesn't agree with why not just e-mail the person rather than getting 
everybody involved?  I think I said enough about this...

Hugz,
Branka

  Well lets see? :

  1) BAD ASS computer graphics
  2) action packed from the beginning
  3) very important overall message  (no race but the human race)
  4) great acting, Will Smith = very funny, great comic relief from such 
     a tense movie
  5) see it on a big screen with THX or the best sound system you can find
  6) it's just as good as all the hype has made it seem

What is the difference between Tristan's comment about dead christians and
your dogmatic mouthing of PLUR. I will paraphrase a story that some say about
future "christians" who go back in a time machine and meet Jesus, only this time
it is the PLURist of the future who travel back to San Francisco in 1992 :)

PLURist: Look! Overthere! There's Will Hicks! And there's Malachy!!!
PLURIst: (Goes over to Mal) Hi! Malachy! Wow It's really you! We're totally
devoted tp PLUR and want you to know in the future, the whole civilization has
adopted PLUR as it's ground of being!

Malachy: Wow that's great! I hope it works.   (PLURist leave contented)

Mal turns to Will Hicks: PLUR? hmm. What's that?

The point in going is that there are other people in the world other then people
who see things your way that you need to learn to get along with and realize
that no matter how childish, or impropper their opinions may be, they are
still family
and deserve respect.  Tristan may be opinionated, I often don't agree with what
he says, but when the shit hits the fan or it's time to carry speakers or many
of the other places where PLUR becomes mere words and action speaks louder,
then the whole PLUR-pile, Tristan has been there. He's right, Burning Man
shows that our commonalities are greater then our differences. It is a
celebration of
what a tolerent open and yes anarchistic society can be even if it is only
for 5 days.
It is maybe the largest modern day example of a Temporary Autonomous Zone.

The Promise did live up to it's name dancing through Lucrino Andre's and
Ethan's sets...  The SFR family was in full force chatting and dancing with
each other.  Many happy vibesters bringing the energy level to an all time
high...
The free water was a blessing since, although there were several fans
running, the heat (in the main room) was enough for me to break a sweat.  The
main room was the only room I reallly stayed in, but that was enough.  
Wonderfully situated spot (hidden, but risk factor was ever present...).


Demigod @ Pac was amazing...  
Although I was quite spent from Promise, 3hrs sleep, and running from place
to place all day, I was still able to muster up some energy to throw down
some serious footwork... for at least a little while.  I couldn't stay
through the whole set tho' since the allure of sleep was far too inticeing. 
I did wake this morning with vicious hardcore beats thumping in my head, that
was an interesting experience.

Mystr-E had a OK set but I've heard better (seems he's @ a lull at the
time)...
Didn't hear MARS (although I wish I did, from the previous posts...).

Unfortunatlly I won't be @ Freedom ( i have a 'job' to do on Saturday) but
I've heard of a lil "event" a going-on which sounds VERY entiCing, Saturday
night...

So, hell, Have agggrEEEAAAATTTT weekend with you and yours,


"Dance with me.."

---Adam

PLUR and helping out aren't the same thing... I guess I agree with what you
say, but it's still pretty fucked up to publicly insult people becuase
their tastes in partying differ from yer own (I'm not going to BM either;
I'm not even vaguely interested in going... does that mean I'm not
"real?"). Yeah, maybe he's a cool guy and lends a hand when it's needed,
but on a list like this your words are the only thing alot of people know
about you, so you damn well better choose 'em carefully because that's what
people are gonna base their opinions on. Not everyone knows or cares that
he's a "nice guy" or that he likes to carry speakers if his contributions
to the list consist of unfunny namecalling and pretensious posing. Maybe he
had his toungue planted firmly in his cheek, but that really doesn't carry
through the e-mail medium.

ID4 Review (warning - kinda long winded)

I first got sucked into seeing this movie about 2 months ago when I saw an
extended-length teaser while at another film.  As soon as I saw the
sequence where the Empire State Building (and everything else) gets
leveled, I was hooked.  The special effects looked killer, and I kinda
liked the idea that most of the world gets destroyed before we manage to
overcome the slimy green guys (as opposed to the standard approach to these
things where there's "loads o' battle" but no real impact on the future of
society as we know it).

Thanks to the efforts of some fellow officemates, I was able to see ID4 on
premier night with only a minimum (read - 2 hours) of waiting.  Saw it at
the Coronet on Geary (it's a must for an action film -- killer sound, huge
screens, cupholders -- need I say more?) with 1000 or so of my closest
friends.  When the doors to the theater finally opened, people made a mad
dash to claim as many seats in the "prime real-estate" as possible.
Reminded me of that "land-grab" thing that they did in the Midwest in the
1800s.  Pretty crazy, but also pretty fun...makes going to a movie seem
alot more exciting than it usually does.

Before the movie started, I was talking to a guy who told me that the
director of ID4 was the same guy who did "Stargate".  If you ever saw
Stargate, then you'll understand why my heart sank upon hearing this fact
--- Stargate had a killer concept, great special effects, and a shit plot.
Somehow, they just couldn't pull all the elements together to make a
convincing film.  Anyhow, I was hoping that the director learned from his
last mistakes and had gotten his act together for this movie.

Well, he did, kinda...By this, I mean that it takes a good solid 1 1/2
hours (out of 2 1/2) before the whole plot goes to hell...and during that
time, I was entertained as hell.  Great ominous opening sequences (don't
want to give it all away, in case you see it).  Really killer
mass-destruction & carnage, lots of fire and flying bodies -- ya know -- a
generally good time...

But then it clicks in my head who the guy who is playing the President was
the "Han-Solo" character in "Space Balls"!  Bad acting in that movie was
funny -- but here it was just a little out of place IMHO.

And then there was Will Smith (Aka The Fresh Prince).  I was a little
skeptical about what kind of an action hero he'd make.  Well, he was funny
(with the lion's share of the good lines of the film), but not particularly
believable (way too damn hammy in the face of certain annihilation by evil
alien beings).

And then there were a couple of cheesey melodramatic scenes, intended to
shove the sheer tragedy of the entire situation down our throats, but I
just laughed through them, due to the Velveeta=AE factor.  Give me a little
credit next time, eh guys?

And then there were the plot holes.  In my opinion, it's kind of hard to
resolve a conflict involving overwhelming odds in 2 1/2 hours without
introducing some holes in the plot that you could drive a Mack truck
through.

Case in point:

Rag-tag caravan of RV's and trailers are screaming across the desert trying
to escape the destructive power of the alien spacecraft, who are primarily
concentrating on leveling every major city on the planet.  They come upon
Will Smith, who has recently been shot down and is hoofing it towards his
base.  They give him a ride.  When they get to the base, random
military-looking guy asks the group of RVers if any of them have any flying
experience at all.  A bunch raise their hands.  These people are quickly
whisked away where they then receive a 6 hour "crash course" (pun intended)
in piloting an F-18 Hornet!  Oh yeah, forgot to mention this -- they will
be carrying nuclear weapons to use on the aliens.  Well, the training is
sooooo good that these guys are able to successfully dogfight the green
dudes (while making standard dogfight wisecracks, of course).  Ugh.


But enough bashing of the film...I must admit that I was thoroughly
entertained for the duration of the film (even when it was by the utter
stupidity of the plot).  Special effects were amazing, the sound was great
(at the Coronet), and the cheering, screaming audience made it all the more
fun.  I'd even see it again.  But don't expect this to be the next Star
Wars -- it ain't.

If they are still running this movie around the clock (as they've been
doing since it's release) it'd make a perfect spin-down activity following
=46reedom on Sunday morning -- junk food for your brain for when you can't
handle anything stronger!!

Ok, that review was way too long.  Maybe I'm just bitter about having to
work when everyone else is enjoying that 4-day weekend....

C ya


Oliver

yeah, it was a good party! nice space in SF, got there about when ethan 
got behind the decks. there were plenty of spaces to chill out, even one 
outside in the cool air. a few SFR people i knew were there (hi paul, 
shawna, one of the erics, ethan, joe, tony and others).  paul brought some 
new 
kids into the rave scene and they seemed to enjoy themselves. its nice 
crossing paths with people at their first rave. the music was a nice 
change from what ive heard in SF lately, heard the hardest goa set from.. 
was that Surge after ethan? even a few records i have found their way 
onto the decks - which almost never happens in the land of house. after a 
few hours quite a few people took off, and i couldnt stop dancing in teh 
small room to the last dj playing - house??? thats two house sets this 
week that were irrisistable to this trance feind, the other being Deaks at 
the FM sun. nite. so thats my story, hope all is well with you all - have 
fun camping or at freedom or wherever youll be.

energy,
tom

Of course we've heard DRC spin in SF.  Her style has changed over the
years -- as many good DJs do.  In '93 when I first met her she was
spinning trancey house, but has moved more toward the German-style
hard trance over the last couple of years -- not the plop-plop kickdrum
style but the really hard and deep zone with the big open ambient breaks.
DRC has a great ear for interesting music outside the current favorite
fashion, and her tapes are consistently some of the best from SF.  

I admit to some bias here, because she's a Northwest native (I live in
Portland) and a really good friend.  And as anyone who's shopped at BPM
knows she's always knowledgeable and helpful.  If you think this is a
plug, so be it :-)

I know she's getting a good response from the Midwest and Texas since
she's always flying out there to play.  So if she's in your area -- go!

triple bad ass sets from Ethan and Solar!

Dear All;

	Ya know, you can teach an old putty tat new tricks. I was ay an awesome party last night put on 
my the Dimension seven people. Thanks for opening up your space Crystal, AJ, Erin, Cleo, Dusty and 
everyone elses whose names I'm forgetting. I hope you guys enjoyed the party favors, I know I did. You 
guys made it a great B-Day for me, not too crowded, not too hot, it was just right.

	Lastnight, I didn't have access to my regular rave fuild diet of Ice Tea(sugar water, & caffiene) 

hmmm. hmmmm. good. So I just drank water all night long, this morning I woke up after a very sound sleep, 

feeling refreshed and vibratent. Water, water, water, is a good thing as long as it's not too much, 
because too much will KILL YOU. In addition, it was my B-Day lastnight and believe me I went all out.

	Anyway I feel great, & off to do some clothes shopping, what else is new, later folks.

Peace & Love From Across Cyberspace
aka Brian DarknEs^2

Subject: Benefit for John Howard (SF)

Hello all,

This is Little T letting u all know that I am planning a benefit show for
John Howard.  I am lucky enough to call myself a good friend of his and have
been watching him limp around on his bad leg for over a year now, although
he has been for the past 8 years.  When John was a 17 year old skater he
screwed up his leg really bad and hasnt been able to get the $8000 surgery
done on it to fix it yet.  If he doesnt get it done soon he will be in
deeeeeeeep trouble.  Soooo, I am trying to organize a party for him in
Seattle (for the simple fact that AMerican money is better than CAnadian).
THis will take place on Saturday September 7th.  I am asking all Seattle
promoters and grooovers to please be simpathetic and let me know if they are
planning a show on that date so that I can try to move my date if need be.
I am NOT doing this show for profit and ALL the proceeds are going to him
for his surgery.  The DJ's who will be playing for free and helping organize
the party are:

Markem (VAN)
Buck   (SF)
Minute Maid (VAN)
Quest  (SEA)
Rein   (SEA)
Little T  (VAN)
Mike Stevens (PORT)
and John Howard (SF)

John does not know about this, all i have told him is to keep this date open
so dont be calling him up and telling him.  I would really apreiciate your
help with this so if u have any ideas or spaces u know of who whould give me
a fair price could u e-mail me.  I also need help promoting for the simple
reason that i live in Vancouver and am usually out of town most weekends.

THank you for your support

Love


Little T

Ah, now I see why he wants to go.  I don't know, I think he's considered family
here.  He doesn't need to go all the way to BM just to get respect.  And you
don't need to drive xx hours and camp out to find people with opinions
different than your own and realize that you need to get along with them.

I don't know.  Helping people out whom you feel have the same ideals (defined by
being at Burning Man) as you is indeed admirable.  But this whole PLUR thing
(which to be honest I haven't completely subscribed to yet - still too cynical,
I guess) seems to be about treating others outside of your group the same way,
and if that is the case I don't see it at work here.  Sure there may be all
types at Burning Man, but he's defined his groups as those that go, and those
that don't, then put himself in the first, and castigated the latter.  

	This all reminds me of a debate on the Misfits list.  There's a running
thread that flares up every once in a while about which bands/subscribers
are/aren't punk.  It gets really pathetic, too.  The funny thing is, the people
who yell the loudest about how punk they are are usually the ones who have
little clue and are just trying to lock themselves into an easily recognized
identity to hide from the fear of decision-making and personal evolution.  I
wonder if that is the case with some of us on the list.
	The greatest part about it is that the Misfits weren't/aren't even a
punk band (by their own definition), but the "Punker than thou" types are always
trying to classify them as a punk band to fit them into their own little
ideology.

	I hope the above admission doesn't preclude me from ever being a
"raver" (I also love old Iron Maiden!  Ahhh!)  Wouldn't matter, of course.  To
paraphrase YHWH (sp?)in the Jewish Bible, responding to "Who are you?"...
"I am".

It beats working,

I think that this is relevant to the readers of this list!

Over the past few years I have been fortunate to have as my friends, many 
people who call themselves "ravers".. I recently discovered something 
somewhat disturbing about them that I thought I should share with the group!

I have reason to believe that many of the members of this group are Aliens!

BE CAREFUL, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO TO TRUST!

Your best friend could be from another universe...

I take offense to your message. Just because some are different from 
you, (or as you say: Alien) it does not mean they are not trustworthy. 
One's trust may only be questioned if one is asked "Are you human?" and 
the reply is "Yes". In western society, Aliens are the target of many 
unjustified accusations. A common example is the movie "Independence 
Day". The advertisements (and the movie as well, i suppose) depict 
unfriendly Aliens with evil aspirations. Not only is this unfounded, it 
is a blatent lie used to cover for one's insecurity for that which one 
does not understand. I know for a fact that the director of Independence 
Day never counsulted any non-human entity before making the movie.

Be suspicious of those who answer "yes" to the question "Are you human?" 
Parhaps they are, but even some of the most devout Jews chose to hide 
their faith and identity from the Nazis during the Holocaust. And some do 
not know the truth about their identity. Evolution is a very slow and 
gradual process. A raver may be physically indestinguishable from a 
"normal" human, although a raver's "humanity" may be debatable. 

> Your best friend could be from another universe...
Do not fear that which you do not understand.

Wow, I am really put on the floor by what I have read on this list.  I have
known about the sfrave list for about a year, when I started getting into
raves and such, but I never really had the time to be able to read all the
mail.  This summer I figured I would get a chance to read the mail and find
out more info on raves around Northern California, since I have more time to
go.  Maybe it is not my place to say what I am going to say, because I have
just put my name in on the list, but it stuns me to see how much negative
mail is here.  I have always thought of people who attend raves to be those
few people in society who could accept the thoughts of others.  I did not
think that they would be telling others that they should go home if they do
not attend a certain rave, or complaining about imposing beliefs upon others.
 What has happened?

My best friend, who introduced me to raves (she posted as "Annie", maybe you
all remember her) is the most loving person. Through her I have met some of
the best people at raves and on my own as well, but this bunch of letter does
not seem to be what is idea behind raves.  Do we not attend raves because we
love the music that is spun?  Are we not there because we love the music, not
because we are there to say we went?  It seems to me that where one person
goes to do what that person wants to do is up to them.  It does not make them
any kind of person. other than someone who knows what they want to do.  I do
not understand what is going on here.  Please someone tell me that is
different at other times and that this is just a time when there is a lot of
negative energy circulating.

Neither did the director of E.T.  I'm assuming the above was written tongue-in-
cheek, so I won't say more.

Ok, so another scant record buying week, Man, I've really got to learn to
conserve $$ a little better. Anyhows, I'm really psyched on what I bought.
Same type of stuff as last week.


Domestic:

Robert Hood: The vision, Metroplex

Right, so this record isn't new, but I held off on buying it until now.
Four tracks of the classic '95 Hood sound. One track definately reminds me
of Minimal Nation. The standout is the b-side #1 track entitled Detroit:One
Circle. This is a wicked deep jam which has been slithering it's way into
my dream and effecting my subconcious in ways I won't understand until
later. It starts off with a nice blippy synth line and then opens up with a
deep base kick.Then the sample "DETROIT" starts looping and you just lose
it...add some double time hi-hats and it's all over. Massive.

Import

DJ Jean-Pierre and DJ Groovehead, XS-03

Another enigma. I assume this is an x-Trax product. There's no title or
date. "Definition from the soul" is enscribed on the clear plastic.
Anyhows, this is a really really solid plate. It's not often I buy import
acidhouse/acid/whatever, but I was blown away by the care put into this.
Both trax are pretty fast with nice low base kicks (but not low enough to
be 'ardcore) and have interesting snares and hi-hats. Both tracks are also
groovy as phuck and have enchanting detroit-ish strings looping throughout.
Close your eyes and let the drone take you away...

Jungle

Nightmares on Wax: Still Smokin II- Warp Records

I bought the first one last week, so I lose originality for buying pt.2.
but after you hear the DJ Food remix of Dread Overboard (and you WILL hear
it), you really won't care. This is a 1st rate remix from the first rate
trip/hip-hop/jazz/funk MASTER as of late. The tune starts off inna mellow
hip-hop stylee some beautiful organ and flute lines float somewhere above
the clouds. There's a really nice break with just a pulsating heart beat,
and then the number explodes into a jazzy drum'n bass line which took my
breath away. There's also a Rae and Christian hip-hop mix and an
instrumental jungle version of stars. With music like this...who needs
drugs? (and who has the money...*grin*).

Hi All!

 Sometimes my intial reaction to flame posts is the same as Branka's 
here. Sometimes, however, it seems neccessary and good for people to 
honestly communicate and then to get feedback from their community ( and 
other comm unity's ;) on what they expressed. This is one factor that 
gives me hope for the heathy survival of the human race; our increased 
ability to communicate.


Peace all

Fear is a HUMAN emotion and can cut both ways. Those that cherise and 
respect their humanity usually find a graceful way to live with their 
fear ( as well as their other emotions ).

hello everyone, whether you be negative, positive, nice, evil, condemning,
etc-

i joined sfraves just about 1 year ago.  jake reichert dragged me in,
kicking in screaming, and i was converted instantly by the love i felt. 
then, i made the promise to myself:

IF RAVING EVER INTERFERES WITH MY LIFE AS A CATHOLIC, I NEED TO LEAVE.

i made that promise then, and i must hold to it.

recently, there have been a rash of postings that have so offended and
hurt me to my personal core, that i am speechless.  i have seen phrases like:
1)i dislike organized religion like the next guy
2)dead christians
3)--and numerous other comments displaying a basic intollerance of
christianity.

i understand that many people have issues with christianity; so do i! as a
practicing church musician who also happens to be bisexual, that can lend
itself to some problems.  i choose to be there, and i expected the support
of those in my communities (friends, family, sfraves) to be there behind
me.  the recent underhanded comments of a few ravers have appaled me and
made me realize the blatant lack of support.

[note: matt goes away and cries for a few minutes, so disturbed about the
comments he has heard recently].

i came into the rave scene, and loved it.  i, for the first time,
felt
part of a community.  i thought, they won't mind that i'm a practicing
catholic, and they sure as hell won't make comments that will make me feel
lesser as a person.

boy, was i wrong!  

thank you to all those who said things like:
1)plur, christianity, buddhism, etc, are all paths to one truth
2)eric petersen's "i love you" posts

good bye, all.  thanks to the wonderful people i have met:
shawna
the entire tahoe-trip crew
the 4'th street crew (trish, bekka, kc, etc)
there are many others that i have met and loved, but i'm a bit too choked
up to remember them now.  thank you.

feel free to write, feel free to say hi, but keep your anti-christian
comments to yourself.

i love you all dearly-

matt lanier

When ever I go to a party, I end up asking every person I meet if they're an 
SF Raver.  I was thinking that it would be much easier if SF Ravers wore 
a sticker on their shirts that said that they are SF Ravers.  You know, 
like the "Hello my name is..." stickers, but "Hello, I'm an SF Raver".  
Putting your name on your sticker would make life a lot easier, because that
 way when you run into somebody that you met earlier, they will actually 
remember your name.  I know that I always forget names, so it would help 
me a great deal.  To take this one step further, I'm willing to design a 
standard sticker with the SFR Logo on it and have a place for you name if 
people want to add it.  Mail me back if any one has any comments, 
questions, or suggistions on how to go about doing this.  Also mail me 
back and tell me your opinions on this idea.  

PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUR, isn't Love great.

I have to say that ID4 was the most AP (Action Packed) movie I've seen 
this year, or the last couple of years for that matter.  The plot had a 
few inconsistancies and the alians ability to communacate with the humans 
was kind of a cop-out to explain why the alians were doing what they were 
doing, but over all, I thought is was a epic movie.  It's one of the few 
movies that I thought was worth $7.  The best thing about the movie was 
the computer animation, it has to be seen to believe.

Sorry guys I do have to defend this movie.




>it takes a good solid 1 1/2

The only problem with the plot was in the beginning when they tried to throw
a romance angle into an action movie. It slowed down the otherwise fast paced
story line. However after they split up the movie returned to it's original
pace.

By what do you rate an actor?

Have you ever seen Bad Boys? One of the great action movies of the decade and
an excellent job by WILL SMITH. Yes the directing was excellent (by Michael
Bay, The Rock) also. However Smith proved he was an actor.

Gee I wouldn't have noticed.

Perhaps you should spend more time to try thinking for yourself and not try
to be the next Siskel and Ebert. Maybe you should try going to movies for
enjoyment instead of to practice your cynicism. They are a break from reality
not a prediction of a future.

My roomates and I live above a storefront that has been converted into a
practice space for a band, and we intend to have occasional shows. The
space is pretty large, also suitable for artists. The front of our space is
presently being painted by the infamaous SF graffiti artist Twist.
The bedroom available is kinda small, but but the living room can be used
for a deskspace and such. The kitchen is pretty big. Extremely close to
Bart. $300.00 a month, utilities not included.
I'm really the only "raver" of the bunch, but we're (3 males) all pretty
likeable, creative people.

OK, I made the first set, some just have the day SFR logo and underneath 
it, it say's SFRaves.  I took the logo directly off the web page, so if 
there is any copyright issues, please let me know.  The second set of 
stickers have the same logo, but on the right side of it there's blank 
space for you to put your name.  I'll be at the Freedom rave giving these 
out to any SFRavers who ask.  Now I bet nobody can guess how to identify 
me?  Yes I'll be wearing my own sticker with my name on it (Matt Abrams).
See all of ya (that are going, of course) there.

what faith you hold.  

Forget all the bad vibe if you can.  I too am frequently distressed by the
number of ppl in the rave scene who are astoundingly narrow-minded and
vituperative.  I find that most people who attack another's faith do so
because they are insecure in their own beliefs.  For a culture that is
supposed to be so open, accepting and loving, i find there are a LOT of
ravers who simply have no clue.

HOWEVER!  i also have found some of the most amazing, astonishing,
gorgeous, vibrant, open, loving, giving, marvelous, groovealicious people 
thtat have ever existed on the planet.  You guys keep my delight in 
raving fresh and joyful.

PLUR should be a way of life, not just an acronym.

[ to sfraves list ]

[ yeah, Larry's stiiillll hanging around! You'll get rid of me come 
  next week Wed ( Unsubscribing Day ) ]

 After reading Dalshire and Branka's posts, and especially Matt Lanier's
post , I thought I'd express some of my opinions about SFRaves I've developed
over the years . Please excuse the rambling -

1. SFRaves is composed of a subset of humanity, with all the variety 
   and faults of the species. ( any Extraterrestrial-Americans on SFRaves 
   are trying to pass as human, so my point still applies in this case ) 
 
2. There is no monolithic SFRaves mindset - some folks have strong 
   opinions about spiritual/religious beliefs that are at odds with others. 
   Some include religious tolerance in PLUR, some feel raving as a refuge 
   away from religion(s), some , like Matt, try to resolve the spiritual
   power of raving to their religious beliefs. 

3. To save on heartache, try considering SFRaves as a news medium for
   awhile, not the meeting place of a community. 

 I've been on SFRaves since summer of 1992. I have learned that, like any
group of people put together by a common interest that doesn't require
strictly adhered membership rules ( raving, DeadHeads, science
fiction fandom ), the common interest doesn't guarantee a "party line"
or 100% adherence to any common philosophy or code of manners. Given
enough variety, it doesn't even guarantee shared opinions related to the 
common interest ( "DJ # vs DJ *", spirituality and raving vs religion and 
raving, this crew vs that crew vs the cops, etc).

(  I have come to rely less on the idea of an SFRaves "community" and more 
on a "circle of friends". I have applied this idea to my time subscribed to 
SFRaves , and I'm hoping that the friends I made via SFRaves will stay in 
touch with me when I unsubscr*be next week. ) 

4. The longer subscribed to SFRaves, the more posts you will read, and
 the more familiar you will be with people's personalities. You will
 develop a "calibration" that you can apply to any future posts they make. 

 ( That's why Tristan's original short sharp Burning Man post didn't really
   bother me as much as it did some others. It was in the style of his older
   posts - "in character" )

Finally -

5.  Take the sometimes disconcerting or disturbing beliefs that may be 
 expressed here in the same manner as if you read it in the "letters 
 to the editor" pages of the daily newspaper [ or, worst case situation, 
 as if you had accidently tuned in some bizarre and scatalogical talk 
 show on your radio ]. 


 Hope these hints help!

>recently, there have been a rash of postings that have so offended and
>hurt me to my personal core, that i am speechless.  i have seen phrases like:
>1)i dislike organized religion like the next guy

i think the beef with organized religion is that in general, it makes people
all think the same way about a certain religion (i.e. christianity) instead
of being an individual about it and interpreting it for themselves. not that
all people cannot interpret it for themselves, but that the majority of
people i have known cannot. that is the sad part for me, that people look to
their minister (or whomever) for interpretation, rather than their own
hearts and minds.
i'm all for chistianity, if it is truly about the christian ideals.
however, i do dislike the current right-wing reactionary biased religious
types who have so much to say in the media these days. obviously, most (i
hope) christians do not fall into this category, so i surely won't try and
judge all christians by this vocal minority.
anyway, i see two different things: christianity as an organized religion,
and christianity as a personal philosophy. anyone who thinks for themselves
fits into the second category and i am happy for. but i do have a problem
with those "sheep" who just follow along in someone else's footsteps without
thinking for themselves.

my only real complaint about christianity is that it seems to promote the
afterlife over our current life - saying that we should be good in order to
attain eternal happiness, instead of being good for the sake of being good
and leading a fulfilling life. oh well.

>2)dead christians
well, i'm not a christian and this offended me. so you aren't alone.
i'm not sure if i was offended as much as sickened by the overt display of
ignorance and intolerance. tristan (an others) don't seem to believe in
plur. like the acronym or not, what it is about is realizing that we are all
together on earth, and realizing that the best possible life for everyone is
attained by caring for others as much as ourselves. yes, being an individual
is good, but you must always realize that no matter where you go you are
always part of humanity.

>3)--and numerous other comments displaying a basic intollerance of
>christianity.
again, i should hope the problem is with the organized "preach to the
masses" approach of christianity, not the individual approach.

>1)plur, christianity, buddhism, etc, are all paths to one truth
i'll certainly agree here. not that there is "one truth", but that any
philosophy that gives you a way to live and comes from inside you, is the
ideal. truth can be internal or external, but the realization of it (or part
of it) must come from within.

anyway matt, i hope you don't view this as more christian-bashing, as that
is certainly not my intent. good luck.

and to all others: i hope everyone can remember to be civil and intelligent
with their discussions, and i hope that everyone can find a philosophy that
runs as deep at matt's obviously does.

Stickers would seem to be a waste.  You would have to throw them away after
every time you went to a rave.  A better idea (and one which has been done
for SFRaves in the past) is to create a laminated card that could be worn.
 This way there is no waste involved.  Each person would only need one and it
could be worn on some part of their body.  I do not know exactly who it was
that did this in the past, all I know is that my friend picked one up from
the guy who made them at the Renaissance Faire that went on in Black Pointe
Forest.  Would this be a feasible idea?

Thank you to everyone who told me the truth.  I was very troubled by what I
was reading.  It had seemed that the list had become crazy, but now I
understand.  I am sorry to anyone that felt offended by me judging everybody
as a whole.  I did not mean to and I will not do it again.  I am just happy
that there are those people who care enough to let me know that everything is
not how I had pictured it.  Thank you all again.

Peace, love and happiness...

The advantage of stickers is that it's easy to get one with your name on 
it.

There is nothing wasteful about somebody taking the initiative to 
execute a creative idea for the benefit of everybody.

Wow.  I think... <nudges thread with toe>... I think it's dead...  
<nudge, nudge>  Yup.  It was pretty stupid anyway, but now it's more than

     To everybody involved with the flame war re: Come Unity, thank you.  
     The whole argument made Promise seem more appealing, so I went (alone 
     even).  Best I've ever been to (only my third) VIBE VIBE VIBE.  I look 
     forward to seeing you all at Freedom.
     
     ... Who was that drum&bass dj around 4:00am at the second room?! ...
     
     Thank you:
     John with the Curious George shirt,
     Whoever had them Tic Tacs,
     Everybody who spun,
     The girl with the Elmo,
     The entire chill room,
     Just plain everybody dammit,
     The people I met from San Jose (ride to Freedom?;) who called me Adam,
     The scene,
     The promoters of that thing,
     And the ever most awesome city of San Francisco...
     
     Peace Peace Peace.

E-mail is wonderful don't get me wrong and the list definitely has it's place
in the Scene. But I must remind people that that the list is a list, it may be
about raving but to talk about it and to do/be it/throw it/dance it are too 
completely different animals.  People put too much emphasis on what a person
says
on the list, they should get out and meet people and then form an opinion.
TRistan may have his ways and like many people who get behind a terminal their
alter ego comes out.  Bersides I didn't say he's a "nice guy", I said he's
there for the Scene where it counts, if it we;re for people like tristan, there
wouldn't be anything for the 500 or so people to gobble about on a daily basis.

Hey all,

Sorry this review is a little late but I been caught up in all the
independence celebrations.  I hadn't been to a party since BASICS, mostly
because I was getting turned off by the greedy promoter attitudes at many
parties and I wasn't willing to spend 20 bucks for a halfass time... well
Promise reintroduced me to the reasons I loved to rave- great music, great
people, and interesting venues.

I'm sure everyone's read about the location on mission already but I just
wanted to add that it seemed comfortable, like a house party, very
inviting, colorful and exciting.  Many rooms, hallways, and interesting art
work.  Anyone see the bugs crawling into the face on the bathroom wall?
anyways I loved all the music.  Memorable dj's Ethan man he got me movin',
Henrick - very rythmic and great mixing, Ryde (NY) was great (anyone hear
him at Organic?), Solar - Yeah, and all the others fit the mood just
perfectly.  I hadn't heard drum and bass/jungle spun in a while and it was
great to hear it again.

Many great people, what's up Shawna M., and to the many others who I don't
remember.  I did more dancing than socalizing though cuz I couldn't stay
away from the main room.  i think I'm always like that.  I do more dancing
than socalizing at party because I come for the music first and people come
second.  Sorry guys.

Well see ya at FREEEEEEEDDDDOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will have a tent set up with a flag of some sort and a tiki torch outside
the tent.  I'm wearing my old and new laminate and I will have a few
glowsticks...I'm bringing a watermelon cuz we didn't eat it at the BBQ on
the 4th.  I'll probably b wearing blue jeans with some white shirt.  Come
and say hi if ya see me or my tent.  OOOHH yeah it's kidee's birthday today
too and she'll be hangin' with me too some where, along with a bunch of
other new and old friends.  See ya all there..

While I know I've never heard her spin in SF
>(quite possibly because SF is much more sophisticated than the House
>stuff they play here), I'm wondering if anybody's ever heard her play in
>SF.

I have heard DRC spin plenty o times and I LOVE her stuff.  (Though I am
realizing I have not heard her spin this year (1996) as I am "out of
circulation" at the moment).  She manages somewhow to keep it hard without
being completely electronic.  It is this "natural" element in her stuff
which is why she is one of my favs.  Of course, if you like the total
non-reality experience of really hard trance/techno, then maybe she might
not be to your liking.

Wondering what others think of DRC....

Hello people, I'm am long time reader of sfraves but I don't post very
often... I just wanted to know if anyone felt kind enough, and had enough
space in their car, to give me a ride to freedom to catch the sunset (at
around 7 pm)...
All o' my  friends are on vacation so I guess I'll have to go at this alone...
I'll contribute some $$$ for gas if it's cool...

Love,

Be sure to look for Knucklehead, Marcy and I at FREEDOM

We'll be taping the party so if you don't know what we look like we're the
silly people changing DAT tapes all evening/night/morning in both the
outdoor DJ area and the ambient tent.

the info line for FREEDOM is 415-905-9629 and it starts at 7:00pm

Well... my ride-to-freedom options are dwindling fast... can anyone with

conversation, free tupperware samples, or whatever...

if you can help out, give MIKE a call at 408.264.6604... I probably won't
check my e-mail again today.

anyway, I know there's a bunch of you I've been meaning to meet, so here's

polo shirt, and a green backpack with an Friends and Family patch, an Alien

Hi All!
 I must humbly and ashamedly apologise for a post that I made. In 
response to the Tristan post below;



>  On Fri, 5 Jul 1996, TRISTAN BERNARD BLAUG wrote:
>  The only good Christain is a dead one.

I wrote;


> Your fucked up intolerant attiude is EXACTLY like a christians.

which is a prime example of cognitive dissonance at work. I was 
essientially saying that ALL Christians are the same and they all think 
alike. WRONGO BUDDY BOY! Christians seem to be just like any other group 
of people; some "good", some "bad", most pretty average folks (meaning a 
mixture of "good" and "bad" qualities). I've meet Christians that I would 
be proud to call my friend. I've meet some that scare me to death. 
Unfortunately I had just come from a 4th of July Christian event (I work 
with a stage lighting company that provided lights) and part of that 
event was a lip synched production crying for more God in school and 
government. The biggest problem I had was that instead of God the play was 
pushing conservative values (big anti-same sex marriages bit with a lot 
of hate, anger and intolerence thrown around).
 
 So anyway I had a bit of a one sided view on this situation. My real 
perspective is that I do not know how this world and universe is put 
together and that any group that claims they do is arrogant in their 
assumption(s) but they may be right. And that includes my view on how the 
world operates. Maybe everyone is right and we do not live in a universe 
but a multiverse.
 
 Oh yeah, apologies for misspelling `attitude'.


Peace all

This is completely non-rave-related -- I need some quick tech info.  I just 
bought a 2gig drive.  My AMI BIOS sees it and did the low-level format and 
the interleaving.  DOS does not see the whole drive though.  FDISK thinks 
there's only 504 megs on it, and will only work with that much of the drive. 
 Can anyone give me a heads up on what's going on?

 I agree with you 100% on your 6 points, however didn't you think that
the movie developed too slowly?

Hey people, some of you might disagree, but I think a motocross track (MX
track) is not a cool place for a rave. I've raced there a bunch of times and
never would I even think of dancing???? I didn't like it how the main dance
place was in the middle of the oval track and the rocks, dirt, dust, and bugs
made it really annoying to dance. Also, someone put some kind of wierd drug
on a button in my water bottle. It made my girlfriend wired, and tasted like
metallic bitter like stuff. But I don't see how you'd get crank on a button
if you had too. 
      I was trying to dance and every couple moves, I'd slip into a little
hole or one of the whatever many million people would walk into me or go in
my way. In doors was a little better with the same jungle music constantly
playing. Not much room to do much in there either and the uneven carpeting
made is pretty hard not to trip and fall on my face. Though I didn't dance
much cuz of all the people.

       So I pretty much think that it was a huge ass waste of money for what
I got out of it. Give me your opinion. I think the bigger commercial raves
suck. I had waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more fun at independance friday. For any
sfravers out there , I was the dork with a black shirt, khakis, and white
gloves on dancing by the front right black light (Right front black light
family!!!). 
         
       To RLunatic:::: Hey buddy, hope you had fun. I'm looking forward to
seeing you again cuz It's pretty cool to actually know people from the cpu
world and put them together in rreal life. Oh. . . my girlfriend thinks that
you're pretty damn good looking. Just so you know.

       To the right front speaker family::::: I went to the right front
speaker to see if I could meet any of you people but I had no clue what any
of you looked like. I asked some chick if she was part of the right front
speaker family and she looked at me like I was crazy. Don't blame her though,
I would if I was her. Tell me what you people look like so I can meet up with
ya and boogie down.

       Love ya all (and thats not just the "E" talkin)

Aryck      

       Also, why didnt someone tell me that freedom was at sandhill ranch, I
would have brought my bike and done some nac nac's off the doubles.. . .


        See ya again.And again, and again, and if anyone wants to go dancin
some time, feel free to call me cuz If I have money, then I'd love to go.
Just ignore my Answering machine message and leave a message. (510)276-3743.

 You are right there is nothing wasteful about somebody coming up with a
creative idea.  I am just interested in trying not to cause waste in our
environment and this is what I meant by waste.  I believe most heartedly in
creativity, it is the essence of our world.  It just seems to me that
stickers can only be used once and in a world where we all must try to do our
part to help out the environment, wouldn't it be somewhat better to have
something that can be reused many times?

How about laminates with a white area so you could write your name with a 
dry erase marker or permanent pen and it would be readable but no one 
would have to go the trouble of making each laminate personalized, which 
might take awhile.

Well, this party went off! I can understand ARYCK's opinion about this 
rave. It was tooo damn dirty!! Dust and dirt everywhere you went.. My 
black shoes and pants turned YELLOW!! Haha!

This has to be one of the best parties I've been to! (Besides Harmony's 
BP) =)~  This party was good  because of the people I hung around the 
whole night!! Brenden, Todd, Leslie, Terry, Ian, Phelps, -MIKE M-, 
Umm... my mind is sorta spaced out right now so if I forgot anybody 
just chew me out.. and some people I met but didn't get to hang 
around.. Sherry, Sarah, Austin, oh man... too many people to name..

Music was great! VIBE was EXCELLENT! Temperature was PERFECT!!! Maye if 
the ground was paved it would have been much better!! 

Anyways... time to go to work all spun out! yeeeeheeeee!!!!

Live it, love it, rave it!!!

There was a time when I knew all this crap...
Is your disk controller IDE?  I think IDE can only handle drives up
to 5xx megs (I thought it was 540, though).  If that is the case, you may need
a new EIDE controller card (cheap). EIDE can handle a 2gig drive; it's only been
around for a couple of years, so if yours is older, it's probably IDE).  Of
course if your drive/controller card are SCSI than it's something else, maybe
DOS?

yeah!

that dirt was annoying, but there was just no way it was going to ruin my
night...

It was one of the best damn parties I've ever been to... music was top
notch, location was great (I like it! Dust and all!), visuals and lighting
incredible, and the people were just soooper (hi: Jan, Sarvi, Adam (thanks
for providing the EntErtainmEnt), Terry, Brendan, Sherry, Austin, Todd,
Ian, SteveO, Phelps (i forgot you friends' names already! =( , Leslie (get
e-mail back soon!), Wayne, Tim, Raf, all the non-SFR folks I met 'n "hung
out with" =) and anyone I may have forgotten: sorry!)

I gotta say that I really had fun after the sun came up and everyone was
content to just chill and talk and hang out.

I need to head out to more of these outdoor affairs!

As this is my first posting to this list, I will try not to be too critical. 
However, having just arrived in the Bay area after 5 years in England and the
English party scene, I have to say I was most disappointed with Freedom.  As I
spent over an hour walking up and down the entrance area looking for someone,
all I heard over and over again was groups of teenage boys making rude and
obnoxious comments about several of the girls walking by.  I have never
encountered this at a party and it really isn't my idea of what partying is
all about.  I also thought the music was wholly uninspired, and that there was
a general lack of PLUR.  (Yes, I've read enough postings now to pick up on
some of the local vocabulary.)  
I'm trying not to let this experience taint my feelings about the SF rave
scene, as I was fully aware before I went that this was a commercial rave and
would be very different from what I was used to.  However, I decided to give
it a shot as I haven't been involved in the SF scene long enough to know where
the parties are that I might feel more at home at.  
If anyone has any reassurance or information on other types of parties (i.e.,
not so commercial and maybe a little older crowd), I would sincerely
appreciate it and would love to hear from you.
Looking forward to making some new friends . . . 

---Laura  :)

I have really mixed emotions about last night.

On the one hand, the party seemed to be missing some TLC. I found the light
uninspired, and the location way to dusty. I liked some of the music being
played, but to be honest, the quality of mixing was really subpar. If
you're playing in front of that many people, you should really have your
shit together. When I wanted to chill out, I found the chill-out tent WAY
too loud, and tho I like drum'n bass, it was a little much hearing it so
overdriven on a little sound system. I found some of the crowd kinda tough,
but that's the great melting pot we have here.

On the other hand, it was a beautiful night, as warm as you like with a
slight breeze. The sunrise was nice, and the drive home was wicked. If
anything I just enjoyed getting out and being around so many people.

Overall, I just found the party had little character. There wasn't a BAD
vibe- it just seemed like one big commercial party with some rough edges.

sleep tight, kids

Hi All!
 On the last Harmony beach party; Oops, I forgot to mention Hi to Adam from 
tiedie.com. A pleasure to meet you and hope to bump into you again! :) 
Big Thanks to Andrew K. for giving me a lift and helping me out with the 
hunger demon. ;) Also thanks to Joey for the grreat vibe and odwalla!!!

 I hope everyone can make it to the 3rd aniversary of Harmony in September. 
Michael Clay and I have tentative plans for a super phun ambient chill 
space. I am very sad to hear Greg say it will be the last Harmony party! 
=( 
 
 Greg and the crew from Harmony have consistantly put on some of the best 
overall parties around (in terms of music, vibe, free water, free parties 
and just trying to make everything friendly). I really feel that anyone 
on SFraves who has been to one of Harmony's parties might want to think 
about e-mailing Greg or calling the info lines and letting him know how 
much we appreciate the tremendous amount of work and love Harmony has 
given to us.

 I know that Greg and Harmony have made my life a happier place and I 
love and thank the folks with Harmony with all my heart.

Peace all

  Ok so just imagine a small rave collective wants to throw a killer 
campout party so they go looking for a space... when a friend gives them
directions to a good outdoor space. The collective follows these 
directions and come upon a WONDERFUL TO DIE FOR SPACE in the deep dark
woods. When the friend arrives- " this isn't the space I gave directions
to but it's SO MUCH BETTER!" Sometimes fortune smiles and so began this
weekend's Gateway campout...

  Damn what a wonderful party... first go to the woods 30 miles off the
main road... The space on forest service patrolled land but in an
out of the way undeveloped camp ground... The rangers who came by 
were very cooperative as was the Gateway crew ... Gateway set up a latrine.
There's a killer creek that everyone pitches tents by... going down
the creek ... day time ravers slither over, around and through 
rocks, waterfalls etc down said creek... we're in heaven!

  Night comes. Wonderful 4 corner sound system for clear dance in the
middle sound. Extra bass subs add ground vibrating bass - lookout
mole people here comes an Earthquake. Tekki torches light various areas.
Out comes the complete NOT obscured by city lights stars. DJ after DJ 
spins wonderful hard, driving techno trance all through the night.
wonderful group of 150+? ravers dance into the night. Dave and gang
unpop the final blow.... mind blowing fog machine, lasers projected
on pine trees, lights projected in all directiions... Large sitting 
log surrounded campfire ( thanks for remembering the fire permit )
this was a "no holds barred" all out in the woods RAVE. At one point
I looked at people dancing, loud pounding tunes, lasers shooting
through the man made fog ( nature supplied none of her own ), lights
and lasers making patterns on trees which surrounded us and I knew
this was really special - even topped Tribal Future (which itself
was wonderful! ) by more than just a little.

  Sometimes heaven DOES come to Earth.... This was everything an outdoor
event should be. This was NOT "Freedom" - this was FREEDOM! Wonderful
space, ins-outs into the deep dark woods, low dust factor, plenty of 
water to share, no young "testosterone" posturing, laser on trees,
lights on trees, great sound, great DJ's like Ethan, Monty, Alex, Joe,
Frank, John, Claire et al., reasonable cost factor, after daylight go 
hang out in and around a creek complete with jumping rock pool... red, 
white and blue = white skin becomes blue in water and red in sun but it feels
so good anyway..... 150+ high vibe ravers....

You people really should reconsider the massives even if they are "word
of mouth" famous... no, on second thought we don't really don't want
heaven too over-crowded after all ;-)


Mike

IF it's not obvious THANK YOU Gateway ... you did this one to PLURRR-FECTION
with only a dog fight incident to mar an otherwise georgous weekend. 
Obviously, dog fight NOT = gateway fault. Damn am I glad I made that 
drive ;-)

hi all!
i have been reading all of your posts for so long, i thought i would finally
post myself!

i had a great time a freedom!
maybe the reason was because we,(mark camp, my boyfriend courtney nielsen
and some other friends) ended up arriving late.(around 3am)  i was supposed
to run into an old friend of mine around 2am, but obviously never made it on
time. :(  (i spent the whole evening scanning the crowd for her)

anyways, when we arrived tony was just going on.  we were hanging out behind
the dj booth, just enjoying the lazer on the mountain and the music.  i saw
a lot of my friends, a great gathering of people.

probably one of the greatest highlights was when the space shuttle flew
over.  it was fantastic, exactly on time @ 5:18am. it was so perfect, the
igit(forgive the spelling, i have no clue on the true spelling but they were
great) brothers were on and there is this pink spot just quickly passing
over! (i got this great picture of it right over the dj booth!)  my friends
and i were all dancing, in front of the right front speakers, and it just
increased the great vibe we all had going!  one of my friends was looking
forward to seeing the space shuttle, but totally missed it. (kind of like
that gum commercial - i hope that my picture comes out)

the next best part was at 7:20am when Spun started.  he opened with this
great song that had this line repeating, "feel my mother f***ing bass in
your face" and another that said, "i've seen the future and it works." it
was great, the crowd was really into it.  Spun had a great set, a great way
to bring in the sun.

with the exception of the hot sun in the morning (i noticed a large group of
us dancing in the shadow of the truck holding the right front speakers) and
the little bugs swarming around (minor things compared to getting together
with thousands of people and enjoying a great morning), i hope you all had
as much fun as we did.  i looked but did not see any sf raves laminates.
maybe next time 

peace 
				         
				         :) shannon :)

ok, slight retraction- I realize that I did on;y hear 3 DJ's while I was
there. I heard Dan's set and the two jocks after him. I did not hear Jason,
who I'm sure I would have enjoyed. Regardless, the sloppy mixing was during
'prime time' (2-6am).

hello all-

just an apology to those who got tangled up between the current battle
between me and tristan, it's a nasty one.

i almost let someone drive me off this list this weekend, the tristan we
all know and love, who gave me the biggest bashing i have ever gotten for
my beliefs.  i almost let him make me quit.  then, after i went to mass
this morning (yeah, that's where we sit around and condemn people or so
that's thought) i realized just how much power that would give him, for he
would have the control over whether i was on the list or not.  once i
thought about it that way, i realized just how ludicrous it was to let
someone who disagrees with me and sends me personal messages accusing me
of being close minded, bigoted, and not qualified to go to raves control
that part of my existence.  HOW STUPID OF ME!

anyway, sorry people for the posts of mine taking up bandwidth that could
be given to loving and healthy topics, like, say, music!


i love you all, and sorry to those who find this type of post boring-

matt l

yah. i didn't dance very much. way too dusty, and i didn't feel like
twisting an ankle or anything. i just played with my glowsticks all night
instead. it's amazing how oblivious people are sometimes. yes, those trails
of light rushing through the air _do_ have objects attached to them, and if
you walk in front, you _will_ get hit. however, lots of people came up to me
and thanked me for putting on a pretty little light show. i think that was
the best part of the night for me. i think when adam et all started everyone
applauding when i was doing it was a bit more embarrasing than flattering,
but oh well. i liked the music in the experimental tent, but it was just too
hot for me to hang out there. it was even too hot outside for me for a
while. ick. oh well, the weather was beautiful, regardless. 
saw a few shooting stars and the space shuttle.. very pretty.
overall, the best thing was meeting new people. :)  so a shout out to
R.Lunatic, LowUFO, and the rest of their group, Wayne, Steveo, Phelps, and
Sarvi. i also finally got to meet mike migurski! =) . sorry to anyone else i
met and forgot.
everyone make sure to get leslie to show you the secret spot in her red hat. ;)

this is jungle sky volume II - jungle sky records/liquid sky music [JS008]
  - slower stuff. very nice to listen to.

4 hero: parallel universe - selector/reinforced records [SEL 3]
  - 4 hero is the greatest! =)

A history of hardcore part 1 (mixed by dj kenny ken) - sub base records [SB
86005-2]
  - kenny ken is sweet! older stuff, but very worth listening to

the history of out universe. breakbeat and jungle ultramix by dj DB - ? (on
tape)
  - some of the same stuff as a history of hardcore, but some excellent
tunes. the versions of 4hero's Mr Kirk's Nightmare and Boogie Times Tribe's
Dark Stranger are great.

smile - (can't find the cd right now, but it's in a bright yellow with blue
case)
  - not all breakbeat, but it does have 4hero's Mr Kirk's Nightmare 95 EQ on
it. =)

new york jungle ep - sm;)e communications (vinyl)
  - nice stuff. haven't had much of a chance to listen to it, as i don't
have a record player. :(

4 hero - Mr Kirk's Nightmare (vinyl)
  - ok. i saw this the other day but was short the 5 bucks to buy it. if you
see it, don't buy it!! it's MINE!!! =) (or buy it for me!)

Need we say more?  The vibe at Freedom was the best of any rave we've
attended -- maybe ever.  

Early on in the evening there was a sense of a desire for unity, for
cohesion, which was fulfilled as the night progressed into the morning.  At
sunrise still-eager ravers climbed the hills to watch a spectacular pink sky
and beautiful women danced in the golden glow of morning sunlight.  

By the way, I wish to add that scribing this check-in is Willow Girl (I'll
call myself), recent fiancee of the Awesome E. Nygma.  We fell in love at a
New Year's rave last January and have recently consummated our attachment
thru the exchange of a ring and are Beyond Blissful.  This event was, for
us, a celebration of our six months together and an anticipation of many
fine years to come.  Back to you, Nygma...

There were many highlights of this event. Awesome funky sets from Galen, Jon
Williams and DJ Dan. Watching the space shuttle make re-entry over our
heads. A man giving out roses to any woman he passed. A beautiful blonde
woman named Sarah who radiated love with everyone on the hill awaiting the
sunrise. Someone else (we called him Johnny Stickerseed) who offered cool
stickers to all of us. Another man with a long didjeridoo sharing a calming
vibration into our chests. The organic fruit cut and handed out.

One minor caveat: the fool who decided to light off a big firecracker amidst
the tents, just as we were considering leaving. I have come to the
conclusion that bringing fireworks to events like this is right off.

I -- er, we -- could go on for hours, but we have some more Bliss to create
amongst ourselves. Many thanks to Martin (who I had the pleasure of thanking
in person as we left) for such a well organized and safe event.

G & J (a/k/a E. Nygma & Willow Girl)

Wowser writes:  Thanks for all the compliments!!  Not! At least your blunt.
But Niels, NEVER in my post did I mention anything being "saved", nor
"Christianity", nor "religion" for that matter.  Further I did not mean for
you to be so outraged by the post, but I warned that some would.  My post
was for those who I thought might appreciate another's perspective...since
it was given strictly out of concern (mostly for newbies).

Your maturity overwhelms me!  As does your respect for people in general

love either. I practice it.  Even though people such as yourself belittle me

sis's, then I would have kept my mouth shut.  Seeing as how you defend
satanistic rituals, such as those found at "community" and some other

Wowser writes:  A simple gesture of concern is not a method of "conversion".
If I, and others, have seen the "Light", then you would really sound like an
idiot here. I don't appreciate you twisting my words.  Clearly a re-reading
of my original post is required, for I said that "community" went beyond
simple paganistic ideals.  And by the way, the parties I've attended with
"community" were rituals designed at calling forth unclean and nasty little
scum spirit things...so maybe you'll get your chance to talk to the ol'
S-man, or his "whore".  Or perhaps you know well of what I am talking about
already. I will not be willing to engage you in a debate, nor defend my
concerns for others, nor scrap with words over details.  You don't seem to
know or appreciate God.  I do.  And it is the coolest thing in my life,
although I don't consider myself "religious".  I can't help but want to
share my joy and/or conern just a bit.  But "convert"?  My post was simply
out of Love for others and I will continue to post in the future.  We're
still in the USA right?  Anyways, I can't say let's part with no hard
feelings.  But I can say, let's try to have some type of respect for other
people who think differently or see the world differently than you...OK?
Maybe you don't think anyone has feelings but you.  Me included.  But they
do, Niels.  Let's practice the first ammendment.  We're still in the USA, right?

Regards,

Troy
(Wowser)

PS.  A many thanks goes out to TEMPoNAUT and many others who appreciated my
concerned post about "community", regardless or not if they thought my
approach a bit odd.  And let me tell you Niels, and those of you who are
bashing God and everything spiritual only to talk about the dark energy
which sends your bodies into spasms or how cool it is to be a "darkie",
there were MANY who related to what I said and who also appreciate the REAL
vibe.  We dislike the imitators.  A big thanks to the 'fam' who supports
free speech and knows well that a great goodness does indeed exist...by
whatever name you call it.  I have a few more replies and then I hope
everyone will chill and put this subject to rest....at least for a while.

        Hi sfravers!  I just wanted to extend a heartfelt thanks to those of
you who responded in either a mature or positive manner with regards to my
recent **warning** post about "comeunity".  It was amazing the amount of
flaming this generated.  And even more amazing is the amount of hatred out
there.  My o' my, but did I almost cry.  My words really touched a nerve,
which was not my intention. I thought long and hard about what to say in
trying to warn my ravin' bros and sis's about what I consider to be a VERY
serious danger.  Originally I said my words would anger some...but I didn't
realize who. The numerous nasty and childish replies really hurt, but I am
not a stranger to childish hate.  Thus I hope you won't be a willy-nilly
when trying to express yourself from the heart (which is not the same as
expressing yourself from the ass as so many did in response to my post).
It is HIGH time (at least for me at) to express myself about the negatives
which threaten the rightious vibes which can happen at rave-type gatherings.

        I posted another response here tonight, which sums up some things I
wanted to say...so I hope you'll read it. I tried really hard to not be too
angry, even though the crap-flame posts really hurt.  Yuk!  My words ever
twisted by some 'sleepers' who thought they were being really cool.  Hatred
and a lack of respect for the 'fam' is NOT cool.  Deception is NOT cool.
Games are also NOT cool.  But what is "cool" is respecting the views of
others, at least for free speech.  What is "cool" are those of you who might
not have agreed with what I said, but supported my right to say it.  And
what is really, really "cool" are those of you who were aware of what I was
warning others against(especially newbies)and your strength to take a stand
for your convictions.  God is cool!  I hope you will shine that beautiful
Light of yours and take a stand for FREEDOM.  (I heard it was awesome!)

In Love for Truth,

Troy

Hey,

On Gay Day I was cruising through the booths of various interests, and 
walked up to the booth titled The Sperm Bank of California. I told the 
person attending that "I would like to buy some sperm."  She was so 
serious, she didn't get the humor.  But I did come away with some 
interesting promotional material and I may make an appointment with them 
when it comes time for my insemination....

D.

First off... Tristan, you're a CUNT 
 (I've been waiting to use that word for the right person). 
Congratulations... I have to look no further! 
 
It seems to me that you've not even listened to Larry or tried to
understand him at all.    
 
Larry was kind enough to open up and share with us his feelings about his
decision not to go to burning man and why he's decided to slow down in the
Rave scene.  There's nothing negative to say about that.  He didn't have to
tell us at all.  And for that reason, what Larry chose to share with us as
well as any other personal beliefs and opinions, should be respected. 
 
If you disagree with Larry's views and values, then that's YOUR fucking
problem.  His decision has NOTHING to do with you at all.  And most
definately does not deserve a IMMATURE, negative response like yours,
Tristan. 
 
You just seem too occupied with your elitist "True Raver" attitude.  Well,
let me give you a clue, Tristan.  You're no "True Raver" to me.  So far
your attidude contradicts just about everything I believe Raving is all
about. 
 
It's not about cutting up people for sharing what they're feeling.  It's
about respecting people for thery're feelings and providing support and
other positive or constuctive types of feedback.  If you don't agree with a
person's beliefs, and can't think of a decent way to let them know... then
keep it up your ass. 
 
>NO offence guy but do you still wear dypers? 
Maybe you should be asking this of yourself.  It seems to me your need
something down there to hold all your BULLSHIT.

We had her spin at Planet Rock last Dec. 8th.  She was supposed to spin 
at a certain time, showed up late and only spun for 1/2 hour, and wanted 
to be paid in full.  I like her a lot, she's got a lot of heart, but she 
also has a lot of attitude.  As far as her style, it does fit in with 
Chicago a lot better than here too.  There was a short time that DJ Dan 
rubbed off on her, but now she's back to that same 'ol "too hard for SF" 
style...

I must say, twas such a fine holiday...

Friday night I was hanging with my non-techno chums.  Running around the city
ending up at he Cornet theatre for the late showing of ID4.  Having an early
brekfast @ some hole-in-the-wall restraunt @ 430AM.. 

Saturday I was off buying a new speaker system 4 my home getup.  Some decent
sized mids and a sub cabinet.  Spinning and trying to get that "just right"
sound...
Then to a CCC party round' 11:00 PM that lasted well into sunday morning (I
left around 9:30 and the DJ was still spinning)...  Wow, talk about spun.
I lasted till about 12:30 and then slipped into a blissful semi-coma till 6am
today...


Hope you all had a great time as I did...

"Dance with me..."

-Adam

I'm sorry if anyone missed it, but that was IMHO the best party so far of 
the year!  Who could forget all the people, the music, the UFO :), etc.

The music was definitely cool all night, and I noticed that there was a 
wooden booth built for the DJ, probably to built so the tables wouldn't 
get bumped.  Still, there were people crowded around the booth, making it 
almost impossible for the DJ to see how the crowd as a whole was reacting 
to the music.  While DJ Dan was spinning, there were two people with 
video cameras in his face, and he wasn't too happy about that.  I 
probably don't have to tell anybody here, but c'mon ravers, respect those 
DJs!  His set could've been even better.

I think DJ Dan, Tony, Rob Vaughn, Josh, and Spun all showed up the Idjut 
Boys... they're definitely good musicians, but mediocre DJs... cheers to SF!

About that "UFO"... a lot of people saw it... yeah, it could've been a 
plane, but do planes leave trails of sparkles? :) :)  Yeah, I might have 
been a little high or something, but everyone around me saw it too, and 
some people were <gasp> completely sober.  I'm not really too spiritual, 
and I don't believe in too much paranormal stuff, but there was 
definitely a lot of energy at Freedom, and I felt it.  Maybe all the 
energy we channeled acted as a beacon that got the aliens' attention... 
err... maybe not... some people say it was the space shuttle landing.. 
nevermind :)

Went to Nikita for the 2nd week in a row and had a little less fun than
last week.  When there is great music at Nikita, 1015 can be a fun place.
Last week Terry Mullin spun and the place rocked.  This friday the music
was very clubby and not too interesting.  1015 Folsom was just 1015 Folsom.
We spent most of our time upstairs groovin' to hip hop.  I won't go back 
until there is another killer DJ coming into town.

Despite being held in a a big dirt hole, Freedom was fun.  Again, great music
made this event.  Tony, Dan and Josh are bomb dj's who are perfect for
summer massive parties.  Too bad the outdoor location was not more, um,
inspirational? at sunrise.

	Thank you all Gateway folks. Light was awsome. Beautiful location
with a clearing for dancing near the stream, an area that became the tent
city, and the most delightful pool formed by the river, with waterfall and
a high rock to jump from. Spent 2 or 3 hours in the cool water enjoying my
self and meeting some wonderful people. I wish I could name them all by
I'am horrible with names. But if you are one of them respond to this
message so I can drill your name into my head. All in all one of the best
weekends I've had. Hope all of you had such a wonderful 4th of July
weekend.

I have to throw my two cents in with those who said Freedom was a blast!  
It was a helluva fun night and morning!  We got there around midnight, 
and set up our tent on the track.  Obviously, the dust sucked, but it 
added to the adventure of it all.  Plus, what better way to prepare for 
Burning Man, than to find the dust deposit pockets beforehand!  ;)

The music was nice, if not inspirational.  We grooved in front of the 
right front speaker several times, but I never saw any laminates!  We 
really must find a better way for sfravers to meet beforehand!  I was 
with some old skoolers and had some fine conversation, but it would have 
been great to meet some more people from this list!  Maybe next time...

Sunrise was beautiful, and when we were able to climb the ridge we saw 
the wonderful faultline and pastures beyonf as the sun broke the horizon.

Thanks to Martin for a solid vibe and a beautiful crowd!

love
john

For your Bastille Day (French Independence Day) enjoyment: Stella Luna
plays the Paul Masson Winery the evening of 7/14, the last of a four-band
line-up for a gal's birthday party.  There may be flyers printed, and I'll
add details as I get 'em.  Every time they play, it's new and different.
The music is psychotic/hypnotic/ambient/psychedelic, beautiful and
satisfying.  Please consider this for your weekend entertainment, if it
sounds appealing.

Enjoy,

Best party I've ever been to?  Yea, I could say that.....but geeez, I've
said that so many times that it really doesn't mean much anymore I guess.

The space was perfect, incredible, breathtaking, marvelous, and uh...really
uh good!  Plenty of grass, a beautiful stream running right through the
camp, and right behind the dj's.  A huge fire pit surrounded by big logs for
sitting.  The raver tent city that formed down stream a ways.  The shrine
someone set up accross the stream that I used for my daily meditation
(thanks).  The "garden of eden" feel of downstream at the waterfall...water
flowing down steps of rock...various pools of various depts for dipping.  A
15-20 ft. high rock for jumping into the big pool.  A beauitful meadow of
little flowers on one side rising to the trees.....   And many, many
complete strangers, nude and happily soaking up all of the bliss.  Children
playing in the shallow pools.  Dogs running and spashing about.  I don't
believe I've ever seen so many beautiful people in one place.  I was quite
taken by the experience.  True family.

I was lucky enough to get to dj at this party, and I was even luckier to be
asked to open up on the incredible sound system Friday night.  I guess the
original first dj hadn't shown up yet (I was scheduled to play Saturday
morning) so Clair asked me.  Dave, Justin? and I started playing didg into a
mic while a circle of meditative peoples gathered around the dance floor.
Dave did a little chanting as well as I, then I proceeded to slowly mix in
the ambience to begin the festivities.  I played ambience and a bit of slow
IDM, and had a blast playing on the biggest system I've ever played on.  I
didn't know half my records had that much bass in them :)  Great techno all
night.  I must commend the dj that spun after me, (sorry I can't remember
your name).  He spun techno all from cd's...and may I say....he did it WELL.

The laser fucking rocked.  The smoke from the fire was lined up directly
with the path of the laser, keeping a flow of smoke going even when they
wern't using the fog machine.  Really nice touch.  I was quite impressed.

Saturday evening, after spending time in the garden of eden mentioned above,
a wonderful thing happened.  Clair was spinning some ambient soundscapes
that just went so well with the landscape.  Then Dave, Justin? and I once
again proceeded to play didg, and once again a large circle formed (standing
this time) around the dance floor. (they took a little prompting, but all
was good after that)  After playing for a few minutes, we all joined in the
circle and stood for a few minutes just feeling the energy.  I was thinking
we should do a spirial dance and within a few seconds, Dave had started one
a few people down from me.  We proceeded in turn, spiraling toward the
center, laughing and smiling...all of this to sound of Clair's ambience
which helped everything to flow that much more smoothly.  Once we reached
the center there were woops and clapping and bliss all around.  Then we put
our hands on the ground to feel the Mother Earth, and once again, Dave took
the lead and started toning.  Soon we all were doing it.  There were
Ohhhhhhmmmmmmm's and Eeeeeeeeeeeee's, and Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh's all over the
place.  I just love doing that.  Then we stood and soon a large group hug
formed, which was definately the biggest hug I've ever experienced.  Clair
provided ambience for a while longer, into the darkness, then the thumping
again went off into the night and late morning.  Ethan premiered a great new
techno track he created to the delight of our ears, then proceeded to go off
as he usually does.  I ended up passing out, but I know Minor spun greatly
(some day I'll get to see you spin man, I promise), then John Carol did a
crazy marathon set of around four hours (I heard someone mention).  When I
woke up, John was still spinning.  I went over to the dance floor and to my
amazement there were about 15-20 people still dancing thier ass off.  I just
watched in amazement as Mr. Carol put them on and off, and even though I was
watch him do it, there were still times when I couldn't tell which parts
were the new song, and which parts were the old.  He's really good.  I think
he played almost every record in his box as well.  Eventually he stopped and
passed out next to the decks.  We all spent the day at the swimming hole in
bliss all over again.  Then it was time to load all the equipment up the
hill.  Special thanks to Dave Able and Ethan Miller for loading every
speaker in the place on to the 4X4 and then onto the big truck....and to the
guy with the blond dreads who owned the truck and spent the entire day
packing it with all of the sound equipment.  I had fun hanging out with
everyone all day.

I got to meet lots of sfraves, and please forgive me if I forget some or
most of your names.  I am working to be able to remember the names of people
I meet.  Let's see, Ben(not sure if he's an sfraver), Dave Bayer, Tony
Rotundo(sp), Jess Fogler, Erik (the guy at Moonpups house) (Jess and Erik,
thanks for the wonderful conversation about piercings, ambient music and
music making gear).  And was it Nancy? that I met in the raver tent city who
somehow knew who I was....I wish I would have gotten to talk more with you,
but my habitual distractions let me off on some adventure and I never got to
see you again.  There are several others that slip my mind at this point,
but I hope I can see you all again sometime.  (There is one guy I met, I can
see you in my mind.  You are blond and I met you first at RAW, but again
sorry I have misplaced your name.

Had a great time getting to know the Gateway crew, and getting to connect
with Ethan on a deeper level.  We shall make music together really soon.  I
met so many wonderful people...so many I can see in my minds eye as I write
this(the two beautiful women working the "door" when I arrived, who I talked
with so much and really tried hard to remember your names), but even walking
away with as many names as I did is an accomplishment for me.  I have
certainly been changed by my experience, and I *will* remember this party.

I love you all.

Rick

You say that there were Satanic "rituals" being practised.  Would you mind
telling those of us who have never seen anything of the sort exactly what
this looks like?  Were they building altars?  Any power symbols of evil
around?  Being a humanist who hasn't looked deeply into the darker sides
of spirituality, i admit i wouldn't know a Satanist ritual if it kicked me
in the ass, but i would like to be able to avoid em if i see em.  Can you
eludicate?

I really enjoyed myself at Freedom.  I hear the people
who had problems with it, but I would like to say that
it's important to realize that heaven and hell are two
different perspectives of the same place.

If you focus on the negative young boys at the gate or
the dirt on your shoes things may seem a bit bad, whereas
if you focus on a group of thousands coming together to
dance the night away and sharing their myriad of
personalities and differences with each other, then
things can seem a little inspiring.  Either way is fine,
just know you have the freedom to choose the perspective
that best suits you.

I thought the setup was a bit nicer than the last few years, with
the laser going over the crowd and the sweeping colored lights.
The sound system was great... the music was up and down.
I liked Josh and John Williams a lot... but then DJ Dan
lost it a bit for me... he got a bit too chaotic that a
strength was lost.  Tony's set was good but vanished into thin
air and the Injut boys were a bit mellow.  But then in the
morning I was having a great time dancing with the
remaining people in the morning light.  That's where my
night was made, in that peace and energy I felt in the morning.

I've said this before but I'll say it again...
It doesn't matter if it's a big or small party, a
commercial or underground party, an old timer or fresh
people party... All that matters is you and your attitude
right here, right now.  You can find the ultimate vibe
and joy anywhere, as long as you're willing to look where
it really all comes from... deep within your own heart.

Sometimes it's easier than others, but it's always the
same thing that makes the real difference... you.

I'm glad people found heaven at the gateway campout, and
I'm glad people found heaven at Freedom.  I'm also glad
some people found heaven staying at home getting a good
nights rest.  All are just as important as each other,
and we need to remember that.

If you're not willing to debate your point of view, then you shouldn't
have wasted our time posting your very debatable points of view in a
public forum. The existence of  Satan, God, and the Tooth Fairy have
not been proven beyond a doubt, and therefore have been, and always
will be a subject of debate.

I guess you're the only one allowed to post hype right?

> Further I did not mean for

So you expected it to outrage, even though you didn't "mean it"? What
kind of twisted thinking are you employing? Or did you figure that
Christianity is a common enough cultural background that people would
tolerate your blathering? What of the Hindus, Jews, Pagans, Wiccans,
Atheists, and other religions (even Satanists) on this list -- we're
just supposed to take it because we're "minorities"??

Go reread your own post. Your "warning" was a condemnation. You were 
being negative about something you don't understand or believe in.

> My post

I appreciated your perspective, and I replied in kind. You can couch
your blatherings as "protecting newbies" or "concern" or whatever, but
it was a very thinly veiled religious proseltyzing in my eyes
(and clearly in the eyes of a number of other people as well).

I believe you are putting forward a fallacious argument in positing
that satan exists and gives a flying fuck about being present at
Come/Unity (he's too busy telling your church elders how to steal money
from the church coffers, too busy figuring out new ways for pastors to
fuck underage boys and girls and get away with it under the guise of
"love").

You are using abstract words like "love" "freedom of speech" "concern"
to defend a message that didn't really have any place on this list.
Post away, go ahead and make my day. You shouldn't be  surprised if
people respond to you as they did, and being pathetic as you are, you
feign "injury" -- you fluffy little helpless sheep you!

> And by the way, the parties I've attended with
> "community" were rituals designed at calling forth unclean and nasty little
> scum spirit things...

That's not true. Those strippers and hoes have been known to shower 
occasionally.

> I will not be willing to engage you in a debate, nor defend my

So you won't be able to debate me until I "know or appreciate god"?
Isn't that conveeeeenient!  You can only preach to the converted, in
other words.

I am truly happy for you that you've found god and are happy. However,
you should realize that this is a *PERSONAL* thing and that your god is
not my god, and when you condescendingly make public claims that we are
the worse for not being under His grace, you are insulting us.

> I can't help but want to share my joy and/or conern just a bit.

Neither can I.

> But "convert"?  My post was simply out of Love for others and I will 
> continue to post in the future.  

Then I guess I'll continue to respond to your posts out of "love for
others" too because I've "seen the light" and know in my heart that you
Christians (especially the ones so insecure in their faith that they
must warn/convert others against "sin") are all a bunch of liars,
charlatans, con-artists, and thieves! 

If you were secure in your faith, you wouldn't find the need to warn
the unbelievers about the perils of evil. You could walk through the
valley of the shadows of the night of the living dead and come out 
undaunted. Or do your "soul savings" make you eligible to collect
special coupons granting you seating near the apostles that you can
cash in at the pearly gates?

> We're still in the USA right? 

Yeah we are. Which is why I can expect christians like yourself to make
school prayer mandatory even though we are supposed to have a separated
church and state. We're in the USA where Christians have organized
resistance against distributing condoms and birth control information
in schools (why would christianity want to limit it's flock of poor,
disaffected, impoverished, diseased, uneducated dimwits by which it
fills it's coffers, when you can create a bumper crop of newborns ripe
for the pickin?)... this is why I can expect "good christians" to be
killing abortion clinic workers -- taking lives to protect the "pure"
souls of the unborn. We're still in the USA with "in god we trust" on
every dollar bill , and with school children forced to repeat "one
nation under god" every morning before they begin their studies. We're
still in the USA where Christianity was used to justify slavery... 

> Anyways, I can't say let's part with no hard

THat's right. Lets have some respect. I WAS DEEPLY INSULTED BY YOUR
POST. *I* *HAD* *TO* *RESPOND*. If you want nice cordial discussions on
this list, then don't bring up off-topic postings on religion that
fundamentally cannot be shared by all readers on this list. Perhaps you
can't understand that because you think your sick and perverted ethos
is just "love". But I don't.

Here's the deal. If there's some Xtian postings on this list that I
find insulting, I will reply, sometimes rudely, always blasphemingly.
If you want to keep your pretty little eyes away from the evil filth I
promise to spew in response, you'd best not post about it on this list.
There's plenty of lists where you can get together with other cretins
and blather on about "love". This isn't a freedom of speech, it's just
common courtesy (netiquette).

> Let's practice the first ammendment.  We're still in the USA, right?

Freedom of speech doesn't mean that I have to tolerate your speech.  I
let you speak. I even spent the time reading your spew. If you believe
in freedom of speech, you must let me respond to your lies. That's
really what freedom of speech is about -- it's a double edged sword and
it can cut like a knife!

If you're not willing to debate about your postings, then you're really
not employing freedom of speech, which implies discourse -- just
proseltyzing and propaganda. I still believe that is the fundamental
purpose behind your warning and I won't stand for it.

is there a name for the kind of mellow/inspiring/house/trance they were

just called it "morning techno."

 This was a really great party. I couldn't imagine a better location, 
with the grass and rocks, river and trees; it was sublime. Props to the 
guy who watered down the dancefloor on Saturday afternoon. It stayed as 
dust-free as could be expected, and was flat, soft and spacious.
 The music was right-on too. I usually prefer faster Goa stuff, but the 
techno Ethan, Minor Minor and John spun was very trippy, fluid, and 
perfect for an outdoor party.

 One group of our friends arrived around 6pm on Saturday, only to find 
all the signs torn down. Lost for hours, and ready to turn back, they 
hooked up with a couple of guys in a 4x4 who had been camping in the area, and somehow 
knew where where the party was. They gave our friends a ride in, and 
actually stayed and had fun for an hour or so. Some good karma working 
there, I'd say.

 Hi to Jess, Andrea, Rikki, Renauld, and everyone who's name I've 
already forgotten. Thanks to that crazy, smiling guy who danced his 
nutty dance back and forth between the rear stacks all night (btw; I'll 
have what he's having; does anyone know what it was?), you kept us 
entertained when we were too tired to dance! And big thanks to Gateway 
for all the hard work that went into organizing everything.

You'll never see a flame from me, or even so much as a spark ;)  I don't
like the bitter, nasty messages either, but I love every person on Earth,
and that includes people who are closed-minded, people who hate or ridicule
me for my beliefs (even if they haven't met me), people who think I can't
be cool because of my age, clothing, or hair, etc.  All I want to do is
give my love and support to everyone; it's up to them whether or not to
accept it.

Peace,

Those are wise words. I don't think I heard many people say they were
dissapointed they went to Freedom. I had some problems with it, but was
incredibly psyched to be out and around tons of nice people. That's not to
say that constructive criticism can't be made about these events- and that
one can't have a good time and yet be dissapointed in the same stroke. I
believe this is because though these parties are great communal events (for
some of us), at the end of it we are individuals with our own special and
unique agendas. I hope it stays that way.

Dalshire,

This list ebbs and flows.  On the average it is *MUCH* more positive than 
negative, one just needs to wait out the conflict.  Since we live in a 
world of yin and yang, positivity circulates right along with 
negativity.  However, both serve equal purposes, and each person must 
decide for themselves how they are going to learn from the respective 
experiences.  One needs turmoil in one's life in order to put it in 
perspective.  Sometimes the most real "living" comes from understanding 
conflict.  It is my opinion that we are the most alive when we interact 
with others, and in this interaction their is always conflict.

Sometimes people need a forum to vent and express their opinions.  
Problems arise when all that is expressed is negativity, but I'd feel 
the same if all that was expressed was positivity.  So, just give this 
space a chance, and you might be pleasantly surprised.  

finer shades of grey,
KaySEE

I picked up someone's thick navy sweatshirt at the AMAZING campout this weekend
from a chill area just off the dance "floor". It has a little embroidery on it
too. Let me know if it's yours!

It's actually pretty tough to find good Jungle mix CD's. Though I mainly
buy vinyl, I went on a quest about a month ago to buy a good mix CD to see
what I was up against (jungle mix styles). Here's what I came up with:

Legit:
Renegade Dub Selection II: Continuously mixed. Great stuff from '94 when
Dark Step was first starting to hit. Features a lot of the top producers
that went overlooked by the first wave of major label signings. I got it at
tower for domestic price...

Logical Progression: A nearly definative history of Drum'n Bass. From LTJ
Bukem's Demons (I CAN'T belive this is 91!!!) to modern classics like "One
and Only". Though a little on the fluffy side, still a great comp.Seperate
trax

Artcore: Number two just came out, and looks just excellent. A great mix of
dark and intelligent stuff by some of the UK's most respected
producers:T-Power, Optical, Doc Scott and more. seperate trax

Pure Rollers #1
I listened to this last week. Solid. Though it doesn't have lots of peaks,
it just keeps going and going. Really good mood music. continuously mixed.

------------------------------------------------->
There's a lot of crap jungle out at the moment. In MY OWN OPINION (!!!)
these are some things to watch out for:

-Moonshine Comps- there's some good stuff on there, especially on
Counterforce, but mostly this is way way mainstream stuff from the UK...Oh,
and the 140+ compilaitons are mostly happy hardcore these days. BEWARE!

-Jungle Sky- Much respect to these east coast boys for really pushing the
scene, but their comps just aren't up to par. The most common criticism I
hear is that the UK stuff they mix is played out, and domestic stuff is
weak overall. *shrug* It IS the UK's music- hell, this is their
hip-hop...it's gonna take a little more time...

-Random UK comps with scantilly clad women on the cover and noone you've
ever heard of before on the track listing...listen before you buy:)

-peace-

After a fabulously beautiful weekend at the Gateway campout, I'm leaving
for Europe tomorrow for a few weeks.  I'll be in London first, visiting
friends and I'm planning on hitting as many raves and clubs as I can get
my poor wrecked body to go to.  I'm especially looking forward to hearing
some wicked drum 'n bass and some harder, faster techno...:)  Then I'm
going to France to visit my Dad. I'll be back in August.

I'm unsubscribing from the list until my return and when I get back I'll
have to decide whether or not to re-subscribe.  Much as I love y'all, I
did just about fail physiology this last quarter because I spent to much
time on the list.  I'd hate to flunk out of med school (or worse, kill a
patient one day) because I was too busy reading reviews of the last Sunset
:)

So either I'll see you on the list in August or I'll see you in person at
the next event we're at together.

It's been wonderful getting to know you all and being a part of the
community.  I'll look forward to some real-life hugs and exchanges of good
vibes next month.  If I get a hold of a computer in Europe I may post a
little hello/review of the scene.

Be good to each other while I'm gone...

Peace,

		Ranting and Raving

Hey all!

Here's my Promise review, albeit a rather late one.  

First off, let me say that it was sooo nice to be able to go to a 
regular ol' indoor SF-based rave, I do love the outdoors, but not when 
there are nothing but outdoor parties due to space problems for the 
indoors.  Thanks! :)

The location was pretty cool, it almost looked like someone's house.  I 
think it was a yoga place or something, judging from the random yoga 
flyers I saw everywhere!  In certain ways, it reminded me of the Acme 
(the good points of the Acme) because of the multi-level/multi-room set 
up, which I find kinda fun.  I do like having one big room with 
everybody in it, there's always a nice unification of the group with 
that, but I also enjoy wandering around from room to room discovering 
new stuff with every turn when there are multiple rooms & levels, it's 
kinda like wandering thru some surreal fun-house! :)  Always something 
new to discover each time you turn the corner.  And this space had a 
*big* bonus that the Acme lacks big-time, that being an outdoor area 
with chairs in which to cool off.  Very nice!  One thing I would have 
changed would be to add more cushions & soft stuff to sit on in the 
main chill area upstairs, that hardwood floor with 2-3 pillows just 
didn't cut it for me.  Gimme Beanbag chairs, & mattresses like Madness 
had! :)  

This was a particularly cool party because Paul brought along two 
newbie friends who were trying out the whole Experience for the first 
time!  This was really nice to watch & participate in their first 
journeys.  Paul, they were really cool, you have to bring them out to 
play again!  

The music was pretty damned cool too, found myself jumping all around 
to whoever it was playing that juicy hard goa after Ethan's set, really 
dug on that!  Does anybody know who that was?  I thought I heard 
someone say Surge, if so, I'm gonna hafta keep a lookout for him again. 
Altho really, this party ended up not being so much with the music, 
more time was spent with friends & the newbies, which was cool too.  
Met some new sfravers too, like Austin, Jim Cyr, & Carol Saldana (with 
the groovy psychedellic tank-dress!) and ran into Brian Darkness whom I 
haven't seen in ages (thanks again B!).  

Well I think that about covers it.  Hope to see you all at Beautiful 
People next weekend, muchly lookin forward to it! :)

Love,
Shawna

Damn str8!  The best part bout this is that it is my understanding that
this will be held at the Greek Theatre!  Could probably stick your head
out of the window and attend the concert if the tickets cost too much :-)

I have to second this one.  Everyone has their own interests, their own
pace.  Anyone who thinks that what they do and know is better than
anyone else is just wrong.  I started raving years ago and thought I was
cool as fuck because later everyone was doing it and I was
first..etc..etc.  Now, it's not the greatest interest of mine and I am
not up on the latest happenings as others are, but does that make them
cooler than I?  Does it matter?
To each their own and praise diversity.

dude, I remember reading the *exact* same elitist bullshit last year.
Something along the lines of only the cool kids were at Burning Man and
everyone who went to Basics was a poser. someone can check me on this,
but I even think it was a Tristan who posted it as well. Fuck that.

Just because you have the means and drive to make it does *not* make you
a better person or a better human being. Not everybody has the same
health or economic resourses that you may.

instead of making condesending remarks, I'm thankful that I've got all
my
limbs intact, a good back, some cool friends, and a bit of cash for my
trip.
There are enough assholes in this world, you really don't need to add to
their numbers.

Hmm... that last message makes no sense without an introduction... :-)

Ive only been on the list for a few days tho Ive been here in Berkeley
enjoying the sunny west coast for a month now.  Im originally from 
Pittsburgh...  a city with a well-deserved reputation as an up-and-coming
rave scene (well, actually, its had that reputation for a while :-).
Anyway, I will be starting grad school here at good ol' UC-Berkeley in
the fall and am here getting a jump on things.  That last message about
Dead Can Dance got me so hyped cause I currently live in the Foothill
Residence Hall and can hear all of the concerts at the (outdoor) Greek
Theatre.  Yes!  Anyway, Ive been meaning to post here and stop
lurking so here goes...

My first SF-raves experience was not good I hate to say.  I went to
some party...  the last Saturday in June...  Uhh... I forget the name.
Anyway, it was on the ROM.  The crowd was a decent size (it was at
a location around 21st and Mission) but the attitude was *GREATLY*
dissappointing for a locale w/ such a great reputation.  The only
people who spoke to me were asking me if I was buying or dropping...
Im totally fine w/ people getting wasted but please dont bug ME about
it!  In four years at Pgh parties Ive never had that happen!  Anyway,
the people *I* spoke to (only a couple) were quite discouragingly
standoffish.  I *really* think I found a bad party judging from the
heavy PLUR of this list.  So to stop this rant Im looking for
anybody whode be willing to show me the ropes in picking out
good parties and getting familiar with DJs, etc.  Id especially like
to hear from any UCB students cause they are nearby!

- David

PLUR up ya scene!

you could just climb the hill behind it, and check it out... How about a
bunch of SFR's (DCD SFR's of course) get together and stake out a nice hill
spot for the concert? that'd be nice... or I could just pay the ticket
price. =P

Dear You;

        I agree I can't spell, and to make it worst I even forget to use my
reader equipped spell checker. So much for the English language, but areas I
do however shine in are Calculus, Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Differential
Equations, Multi-Dimensional Vector Calculus, Thermodynamics, Licensed
Massage Therapist, Master Electrician(unlicensed), Certified Electronic
Technician, Electrical Engineer, Computers, The Net, Psychology, Certified
Crisis Counselor, Certified Body Centered Awareness Therapist, ...etc.  

        In addition and as an Electrical Engineer I have designed systems
and parts for the following Military aircraft; A-6 Intruder, A-10 Warthog,
AH-64 Apache Attach Helicopter, F-4 Phantom, F-15 Strike Eagle, F-16 Falcon,
F-111 Ardvark, Discovery Space Shuttle, Tomahawk Cruise Missile, Maverick
Missile, and numerous air sea rescue helicopters as well. Also, helped
design the following hi-speed computer mass transits vehicles(trains),  New
Cities Metro-North * Long Island Railroad's FL9-AC Dual Mode Locomotive, New
Jersey Transits Electric Silver Liners and ALP-44 Electric Locomotive,
Baltimore Light Rail Vehicle, Maryland DoT's Coach Car's, Amtrak's Northeast
Corridors AEM-7 Electric Locomotive, and LA Metro.

        Sometimes skills like spelling have to suffer, sorry. Nice mature
remark there Randy, your name has just been added to my redirect to the
trash can list. You have the pleasure of joining people like: Wowser, &
Captain Crunch. Congratulations.

Let Freedom RAVE!  Wow, it was great hearing the fam's reports on this
year's gathering.  I missed it, but did some cool stuff up North.  I went
last year, or so, and it was GREAT then.  Glad to hear it was still cool.
Let Freedom Rave is one of those special times of the year when we get
renewed, or at least it seems like that to me.  Shine on!

[from conversation overheard while waiting for my apple fritter at lunch]

1: I went to a rave this weekend. There were 4000 people there, and not one fight

2: Were they that drunk? or on PCP or something?<girl titters.shes out of her league>

1: I dunno, they weren't drinking. maybe noone knew how to fight. There were
some people kinda slapping each other, though...but no one get hurt 
<he's not disapointed, hes just confused> 

<time/speech elapses. I ask what party he went to. He asks if i do dust. 
I eat my fritter>

1: you know, real ravers hide their appearances when they aren't going out.
They don't look like they go to raves. 

<like aliens, and supergyros, i guess>

I was kinda irritated for a minute, then i realized that i 
would really like to see 4000 dusted aliens sfraving away.

well, maybe from a distance. 

them aliens are unpredictable as it is. 

besides theyve prolly got super-cool barbarella drugs.

and just say 'no' to PCP

does the gov't have any alien tranquilizers?

maybe we show them TV until they pass out from 'days-of-our-lives' shock.

but bettty sez she still wants to go.

and to stop wasting bandwidth

take care

A couple recent house cd's I would recommend are: 

Future Sound of Chicago Vol. 2 

- great selection of Cajual tracks with mixing provided by Derrick Carter,
  on Ministry of Sound

DJ Mark Farina - Seasons One (I think?) 

- If you like Mr. Farina's sound you'll dig this cd, and it's easy to
  find (it's distributed by moonshine)... 

also, in the slightly experimental house vein, I *highly* recommend
Herbert's "100 lbs" on Phono. Awesome.

Nope, but it's the same Taylor profiled in the latest xlr8r.  He used to
be one of my favorites years ago but it's been awhile since I've heard him
spin...

Andy

ps anyone know if exist dance is indeed defunct?

Hi Karen! Yeah, they were building alters there...but it wasn't so much that
as it was who and what they were building them to.  There were hexigons on
the dancefloor and walls, with candles and all kinds of stereotypical
satanistic crap everywhere.  Their ring leader got up on the speaker and
kept putting on these ram-looking masks.  He chanted and ordered everyone to
call out to the "demon" although they called it by another name.  It was
erie!  The vibe was not there, needless to say.  But another presence was
there...a presence which calls itself a vibe. Yuk! It was as though a veil
of swiriling, hot, confusing, fear had descended.  There were also some
pretty weird supernatural things there...like voices in the music saying,
"Love can only hurt you" and "Stop Love!" and other lies. It was gross, K!
As though these kids were being brainwashed.  They were dead for all
intensive purposes.  Makes me sick to my stomach to think about it. Their
eyes were big and dark (not like from drugs though), and I found out later
what "comeunity" was all about.  Sadly, there are other groups like this in
SF and elsewhere.  Like I said, I've raved from coast-to-coast.  The main
characteriscs I've found in these 'sleepers' is that they lie about what
they do and jump down your throat it you try to talk about it.  They want to
keep their activities secret.  They also lash out and ridicule anything that
is positive...usually spewing a negative and calling it positive.  They try
to keep the Truth from being known and keep everyting up-side-down. Oh yeah,
they also put words into your mouth ANYTIME you talk about Love or God or
the positive vibe (like they did with my original post....saying I was
"religious" or a "Christian", even though I NEVER used these words).  I
think most people know that music is a powerful tool.  And I hope most
ravers know about the REAL vibe, and not just the imitations.  We all know
the spiritual nature of rave events (usually), and I think those who deny
this are only fooling themselves.  After all, music is the language of love.

On a more positive note, however, the real vibe did come that night in
particular as a result of a few VERY dedicated individuals who knew what was
going down.  Things turned around for a while and I think everyone there was
faced with some choices.  Oh so important are those sublime choices!  The
presence of Love actually came down!  Hard to describe, but AWESOME!  Let's
just put it this way, we kept calling out for help...and help came!  That
kind of help is available to anyone willing to take a stand.

Karen, if you have any questions, please feel free to post them.  FREEDOM!

In Love,

Troy

Hello All!

I saw Symbiosis live a couple months ago at a party, (forgot which one,
sorry!), on 50 Oak street and just this past weekend I happened to be
looking through the CDs at Tower and stumbled on their first full CD
release. I immediately snapped up the last CD left remembering how much
I loved them when I heard them live...their CD is just as INCREDIBLE!!!
I'm not too good at classifying music but it seems to me to have a bit
of everything for everyone...ambient, techno, trance, breakbeat. Anyone
else have an opinion on their music / CD?

The CD is titled: Clandestine Electronic Subculture
Released by: Domestic Recordings

well well well, where to start... first, a hewmungous thank-you to gateway
systems, for throwing such an amazing party.  the sound system just raged
and i admit i got caught up in the laser wave-thingy more than once..
the disco ball hanging between the trees was a nice touch as well.
of course, the thing that made this event so special was the people.  i
met so many kind, loving, open people i won't even try to list them all
(i did make an attempt in my journal tho :)  

rilly good moments:
 -seeing lots of familiar faces and getting to know many of them much better
 -waking up sunday morning and jumping off the big rock into the icy water
 -getting to play didjeridu even though i forgot mine
 -the spiral dance on saturday's opening ceremony

barely bad things:
 -forgetting my didjeridu at home :/  i kicked myself about 130 times for
  this one...next time..
 -getting way lost after taking a wrong turn and spending 3hrs trying to
  find the campground..good thing it wasn't dark!


thanks again to everyone, i hope to see you all again *soon*


love,
 justin

NON RAVE RELATED: Update on my disk problems, then a joke.

First, thanks to everyone that helped me out with my EIDE disk problem.  

For those of you that find yourself in this position in the future here's 
the scoop:
        1. Normally a low-level format of an IDE drive destroys it.
           newer drives ignore the system request for a low-level
           format, so my new drive is ok after all, but I DOS still
           thinks it's only 504 megs.

        2. Either your system BIOS (or disk controller BIOS) has 
           to recognize that the disk has more than 1023 
           cylinders and create a special internal
           table that is used to fool DOS, or you have to have a
           special software driver that does the same.  Since my
           BIOS is an old ('92) AMI BIOS, it wasn't quite doing
           the trick by itself, and the software drivers that
           came with my new EIDE card didn't work.

        3. I've ordered a card from AMI that supplements the 
           existing BIOS to handle the large drive.  $50 through
           Colfax International in Sunnyvale.  This way I don't have
           to replace my current BIOS chip, and since it's from
           AMI, I think it's pretty safe to assume that it will
           work ok with my existing BIOS.

The card should be here in a couple of days, so we'll see how it goes...

Second, here's a joke from a pen-pal of mine in Singapore.  Seem to me we 
need some good vibes on the list right now, and humor is a universal language...

---------

Once upon a time there was a nice young man called Karim. He used to sell
caps for a living, and roam around several villages. One day he would be in
Mughalsarai, the other day people would find him in Faizabad.

It was an afternoon in summer and he was traversing the vast plains when he
felt tired and wanted to have a nap. He found a nice mango tree with lots
of branches and cool shade, placed his bag of caps beside him and went to
sleep.

Tired as he was, he was quickly fast asleep. When he woke up after a
refreshing little nap, he found that there weren't any caps in his bag! "Oh,
 Allah!", he said to himself, "Did the thieves have to find me of all
people?" But then he noticed that the mango tree was full of cute monkeys
wearing colourful caps!

He yelled at the monkeys and they screamed back. He made faces at them and
found the monkeys to be experts at that. He threw a stone at them and they
showered him with raw mangoes.

"Ya Allah, how do I get my caps back," he said. Frustrated, he took off his
own cap and slammed it on the ground. And lo, the stupid monkeys threw
their caps too! Smart Karim didn't waste a second, collected the caps and
was on his way.


   50 Years later ....

     Young Abdul, grandson of famous topiwala Karim who was also working
hard at making $$$ doing his family business, was going through the same
jungle. After a long walk he was very tired and found a nice mango tree
with lots of branches and cool shade. Abdul decided to rest a while and
very soon was fast asleep. A few hours later, when Abdul woke up, he
realised that all the caps from his bag were gone! Abdul started searching
for the same and to his surprise found some monkeys sitting on mango tree
wearing his caps. Abdul was frustrated and didn't know what to do. And then
he remembered a story his grandfathers proudly used to let him.

"Yes!!!! I can fool these monkeys!!!", said Abdul. "I'll make them imitate
me and very soon I'll get all my caps back!"

Abdul waved at the monkeys        -- the Monkeys waved at Abdul
Abdul blew his nose               -- the Monkeys blew their noses
Abdul started dancing             -- the Monkeys were also dancing
Abdul pulled his ears             -- the Monkeys pulled their ears
Abdul raised his hands            -- the Monkeys raised their hands
Abdul threw his cap on the ground ............
          ........ one of the monkeys jumped down from the tree, picked the
cap, walked upto Abdul; slapped him and said "Idiot!!! Do you think ONLY
YOU HAVE A GRANDFATHER?????"

The words of Mr. Matt Kodama (thank you) led me to look further into
the Dead Can Dance show (this is my last post on the subject... I 
*PROMISE* :-).  Anyway, it would seem that they are also playing at
the Greek Theatre (as I had said originally.  *sigh*) on August 9th.
Apparently tickets went on sale yesterday (Sunday).  See 
http://www.usfca.edu/usf/neufeld/concerts.html for a little more info.

        You bet freedom sucked! All that fuckin' dust and shit on the
ground, and anyone trying to dance just a little more than shaking around
either got the shit kicked out of him (I was near the speakers...) or
choked on the dust he kicked around...
        Without being age-discreminatory, I thought that overrall the crowd
wasn't too young but way to immmature... I got the impression that people
coughed up 20 bucks just for the "scene", the "vibe" and not at all for the
music, at least for the majority... And why should they come for the music?
DJ Dan's set was way uninspired that night, and the rest was just lame...
Maybe I'm just losing taste for breakbeats... I can understand laura's
critique about freedom: compared to the parties in england like
megatripolis, freedom was pathetic...
        And without wanting to be an asshole, what the fuck's up with the
tents!?! I mean, this was only a one night celebration, not a fuckin'
weekend drug-a-thon (which are tight, by the way...)

        Well overrall, freedom sucked, and the only I liked about it was
the bus ride to and back... I met some of the coolest people: It doesn't
get any better than riding in a ex-hippie bus going at about 50 mph with
happy ravers, a garth + jeno tape ripping it up, and bowls of weed being
passed around like flyers...

        Went to Mantra, though... as the VM says, "fuckin' awesome"...
Surge, Theta-blip and Dutch absolutely ripped it up, and Neil really spun
some good orbital-type shit as well... The only thing I didn't like at that
party was the music was so good in both rooms and I couldn't be both places
at once...

        Catch you maybe at f-8's cypertrance party... Mars ripz!

Hi Dalshire -
 Couldn't agree more.  It's really distressing, isn't it?  It seems to   
come in waves.  I think the problem is that the list is really large now,   
and if you include enough people, then the number of loudmouth,   
offensive, thoughtless, and negative people eventually gets high enough   
to be really irritating.  It's the bad apples spoiling the barrel.   
 Remember that these negative posts all come from a half-dozen people,   
and there are 900 more out there that wish they'd put a lid on it.

Waiting for the wave to pass...

Wow, I am really put on the floor by what I have read on this list.  I   
have
known about the sfrave list for about a year, when I started getting into
raves and such, but I never really had the time to be able to read all   
the
mail.  This summer I figured I would get a chance to read the mail and   
find
out more info on raves around Northern California, since I have more time   
to
go.  Maybe it is not my place to say what I am going to say, because I   
have
just put my name in on the list, but it stuns me to see how much negative
mail is here.  I have always thought of people who attend raves to be   
those
few people in society who could accept the thoughts of others.  I did not
think that they would be telling others that they should go home if they   
do
not attend a certain rave, or complaining about imposing beliefs upon   
others.
 What has happened?

My best friend, who introduced me to raves (she posted as "Annie", maybe   
you
all remember her) is the most loving person. Through her I have met some   
of
the best people at raves and on my own as well, but this bunch of letter   
does
not seem to be what is idea behind raves.  Do we not attend raves because   
we
love the music that is spun?  Are we not there because we love the music,   
not
because we are there to say we went?  It seems to me that where one   
person
goes to do what that person wants to do is up to them.  It does not make   
them
any kind of person. other than someone who knows what they want to do.  I   
do
not understand what is going on here.  Please someone tell me that is
different at other times and that this is just a time when there is a lot   
of
negative energy circulating.

if you any poor person wants to listen to show, we can hang out on the 
hill right above the greek theatre. and stuff. DCD would be an incredible 
show, but 30 bucks?

I've been to parties where this happens... and I'm not the usual
crystal-wearin' clone, either.  I've got a pretty healthy dose of
skepicism.  But we (humans) don't understand half of the energies around us
(if that), and I've SEEN shit happen I can't explain.  Like when the energy
of a party is manipulated into something dark and dominating, full of
tricks and lies.   I've seen it done more with visuals than music,
actaully, but both are direct pipelines into vulnerable minds.

...and every one of those similar parties I've been to ended THIS way, with
a few VERY dedicated, powerful people taking a stand and keeping their
roots in LOVE and making those sublime choices based on the REAL POWER of
that love.   Yeah brother Wowser, yeah sister Karen, help DOES and WILL
come to those who are willing to take a real stand.   FREEDOM!

You are too harsh, IMHO.   I've been to the Megatripolis club next to
Charing Cross many times, back in the day when it was good, too.  Don't
expect all scenes to have the same vibes.  Freedom did what it could, for
being a massive commerical event.  It wasn't magical, for sure, but it was
nice.  It seems you had set expectations beforehand that were sure to be
dashed.

First you bitch about dust, and then about the tents?   Um, maybe tents are
a good way to escape dust while you try to do certain things?

Sorry, but I had a good time, and am trying to see the positives, not
trying to tear down the promoters because it wasn't like Glastonbury or
whatever...

	How many different types of techno do people like around SF? How 
many times have people said they would like to hear this or that. Well, 
with at least 6 systems with there, you will be able to find the vibe 
that comes with the music which pulls you the most at that time. We don't 
seem to have many multi system parties around here (maybe because it is 
so hard to get enough people to come out and fully populate one system 
let alone a hard techno/trance and then a second housier system...) but 
when you get enough people out there, there will be a vibe to suit 
everyone. So why is that competing?
	And who said the organizers do not want rave camp there? It makes 
sense to any community to put the big noisey things away from the 
sleeping areas. Systems like the Wicked system and ones that some people 
are talking about bringing up (to a very wide expanse of land where you 
can be really silly with the amount of bass you produce) would rattle the 
poles of tents. Since Burning Man consists of more than a rave, I think 
it is common courtesy to point the larger systems away from main camp. I 
may have said in an eariler post that the gate people were not exactly 
happy with people trying to get in for free because "they were with the 
sound system", or that the organizers may not have been happy that some 
people in rave camp didn't know how to clean up after themselves, but 
since I never talked to Larry and company in person, and only heard my 
information from people who ran the medical tent and a few who worked as 
builders or cleaners, I cannot say that they were either happy or unhappy 
with the raving community as a whole.

> Let's face it, there will be 2 separate events out there; Burning Man
> with its "Hell" theme, whatever that means, and the rave camp.

	Hell is on Saturday night... And is a short bicycle ride away if 
you camped at the rave camp. Two events? Depends on what one does with 
oneself out there now doesn't it?

     High 9's on the rant'O'meter... one of the best e-mails I've seen!

     Pavement doing Velvet Underground covers.  I loved the use of the 
     fritter as a symbol of fleeting time, and the closure of the

They don't look like they go to raves. 
     
<like aliens, and supergyros, i guess>
     
I was kinda irritated for a minute, then i realized that i

well, maybe from a distance. 
     
them aliens are unpredictable as it is. 
     
besides theyve prolly got super-cool barbarella drugs.
     
and just say 'no' to PCP
     
does the gov't have any alien tranquilizers?
     
maybe we show them TV until they pass out from 'days-of-our-lives' shock.

	I think there was one Chrysalis which approached the type of vibe
that burning man had, the first one in the amce. The one where things were
going so well that the needles kept running (ok, so the vibe never hit
that really high point because of the needles jumping, but it was there). 
Out on the playa, you could feel the energy of the people dancing getting 
caught up in the vortexes coming off the playa (and for those of you who 
don't believe in energy or whatever, go out to the playa and feel your 
hairs stand on end - that is what I will call th energy of the playa) and 
getting sucked off into the night. There were those that brought their 
citiness with them, and those that still felt they were not enough, but  
there were many that could let themselves go and run out into the dark of 
the playa, strip and yell and scream. Try that at a Sunset and see how 
people react... Being strong/self-sufficient enough to pack a backpack 
and leave for another country and journeying with loads of other people 
who you have never met, and who you don't know if you have anything else 
in common with but the desire to journey in this or that place and 
experience things with them, is not exactly an easily task. To some, that 
journey and the experiences you take with you is what raving and 
traveling is about.
	How many parties are there that if you don't want a sticker on
you, you will not offend someone by saying no thanks. How many parties are
there that if you don't want glitter all over you, you can not have it on
you without hurting someone's feelings (granted they probably are just
trying to be nice, but I may have reasons why I don't want glitter on my,
like I don't want it on me for the next 10 weeks)? How many parties are
there were people free comfortable enough to prance about naked? And why
don't people like other people to prance about naked? If the same unity 
that we experienced at burning man existed at the above parties, why do I 
have these questions?

	Tristan is right about not being able to find ANYTHING quite like 
Burning Man anywhere in the states. And if people would look at what 
Tristan says instead of how he is saying it, they might actually find 
something worth listening to (one can separate the two and object to how 
it is said while still getting something out of what was said). I said 
something about PLUR eariler to the effect that it is easy to apply it 
when it is convienent, well, here is a time when it seems people are 
striking back at someone who is not from SF, has been rasied what is 
probably a more sulf-sufficient manner than we Americans are used to 
seeing and who happens to be a bit too blunt for many people, but who I 
have seen say what I believe to be some spot on accounts of how things 
have been. And maybe his views of unity are different because of this... 
	To a degree, you will find this attitude with people who are
self-sufficient because they are not going to let you hide from the shit
you don't want to deal with - to a degree. Everyone can come up to burning
man, for some it might be a positive life changing event, for others it
might be hell (theme for saturday night in main camp left aside). To each 
their own experience.

Please let's not lose sight of how subjective all this is.  What's dark
and foreboding to one person can be intense, focused, and transcendental
to another.  Was it "tricks and lies" or fun and games?
Good and evil only exist relative to a chosen value system.
Ultimately, too much white light will blind you just as much as pure
blackness.

However, I don't think wowser's concern about spiritual manipulation 
within the rave scene is *completely* without merit.  A few on this list
may remember the uproar that occurred a couple of years ago when Matthew 
Fox, new-age Episcopalian priest brought over a group from Sheffield,
England who were incorporating rave elements into a religious service, and
were eager to spread their message here in San Francisco.  A group of us
met with Matthew Fox to express our concerns about raving being used in
an exploitative and manipulative manner.  It was a constructive meeting of
the minds (IMO), and the "Nine O'Clock Service" ravemass  went off in the
basement of St. Patrick's with much media attention, and very positive
reviews.  To make a long story short, the Sheffield group disbanded some
time after that after its leader Chris Brain was discovered to be sexually
abusing some of his disciples.

You see, it's really not the brand of spirituality that matters.  Satanism,
Christianity, PLUR, etc.; these are basically the tools that people
use to help each other become more aware of the forces of nature that seem
to come from outside the observable universe.  Of course, power vampires
can use these concepts for their own egocentric ends, and *that's* where a
potential danger might reside, though I suppose it is a person's right
to give up their individuality and will to a "leader" -  we all do this
to some extent.

Of course, some tools (like guns) are more tailored for abuse, and history
has a way of demonstrating this, which is why Christianity gets such a
bum rap sometimes.

Anyway, I don't think anyone needs to worry about the possible detrimental
effects of rituals, imagery, spells, on ravers.  Those things must
quickly give way to the beats, or everyone  starts getting bored.  No
ritual can replace what most of us get on the dance floor.  The ceremonies
I've witnessed at raves succeed because they are nonspecific in their
intent other than to bring us closer to each other, the music, and perhaps
the nature surrounding us.  If the message starts becoming more structured
that that, like if one person says "let me show you THE way" then it is
no longer a rave: the ravers tune out, while those who want to follow are
free to do so.

>...and every one of those similar parties I've been to ended THIS way, with

Whatever. Maybe it just took time for everyone's e to kick in.  Either
way, it can often take a while for a good vibe to take hold, for many 
reasons.  Interpret it however you like, but I agree that each of us has
the power to help spread it.

so i went to LA this weekend to check out one of their massives - 
stratosphere - to check out a friend spin and to experience LA energy 
again. unfortunetly they lost their indoor venue and decided to throw teh 
party in the desert. unfortunetly because they obviously wernt prepared 
for an outdoor party. needless to say it was total chaos come morning. at 
least a few 
generaturs gave out, and there was no music by daylite. after getting 
our truck stuck in desert sand and having a tow truck rescue us, we got 
to teh site about 3 - 3.3o am. at this time teh desert was dark with 
beautiful stars and the lights of lancaster in the distance. the middle 
soundsystem was playing some sweet goa (dj theo) and a shitload of lazers 
were firing off into the desert. people there seemed really disconnected 
from communal vibe but quite a few were incredibly into the music, like 
ive never seen in SF, but is common in LA. people just mob the speakers, 
hanging from them and heads in bass bins and a thick wall of pulsating 
human flesh absorbing the thick trance sounds. then that soundsystem gave 
out, and there was teh remaining two playing less hard trance and some 
trancy house. now the sun is illuminating the desert from below teh 
horizon and the tall yucca desert trees and and surrounding mountains 
turn colors with the approaching sunrise. there is problems with another 
soundsystem and only one is left. and then something quite amazing 
started to happen. people began gathering around the one soundsystem as 
one group, just crowding the speakers with people on top of 'em grooving, 
everyone fell in sinch and hands flew into the air as lite continued to 
illuminate teh desert. with every pulse of bass the crowd pulsed closer 
and together. this happened for about a half hour, till another 
soundsystem was turned on, one of teh larger ones with dj trance droppin 
the wax. the sun peeked over teh horizon and people scattered 
again. for an hour or so dj trance played some hard house and trance and 
then the last of teh generators gave out - and thus brought the party to 
an end. 
for some time i wandered off into the desert and had quite a spiritual 
experience with the immense yucca trees and other desert life. the sun 
was getting quite warm, and i just relaxed under teh shade of one of them.

and then we left.

there was quite a bit of potential, especially with that beautiful 
location (minus all teh garbage people left) but it was just too 
unorganized. from my experiences LA energy is quite different, but a well 
organized event there could really focus that energy into something 
wonderful. i hope they all learned something from their experience.

an interesting moment...
	- i was strolling a dirt road walking to our car when a group of 
ravers yell from their car "friends and family"  and take off. wearing my 
FnF laminate i just had a feeling that someone would recognize it, and 
felt a breif moment of solidarity with those ravers speeding away down 
the road in a trail of dust, knowing that somewhere, some time ago we were 
getting rocked at an FnF.

well thats the breif version of my weekend,

energy,
tom

I must say I'm really surprised to see all the negative reviews about
Freedom.:(????

I was kinda hyped on it since I missed it last year but all my friends 
went. So I was expecting a lot when I got there...and they delivered.

-A nice secluded, non-bustable location with plenty of parking and a  
pseudo-dance arena.

-Everything seemed to be well organized, lines flowed and the security     
 (and owners) were cool. I could see how things could have gotten 
 easily out of hand considering the number of people they were trying
 to cram through that one lane driveway.

-A top notch sound system (you could hear the bass all the way from the 
 top of the hill in the morning.

-Dj's ripped it up! Dan played some sick ass breaks! Unfortunately, 
 (and I think it was Dan too) Someone hit a double beat soooo bad it
 almost knocked me sober.

-The free fruit in the morning just hit the spot!

I was impressed, massives can be so...yucky! This was definitely one
of the better massives that I've been to. Yeah the gangsta element was
present, but as the evening progessed it dwindled to nonexistent

 It was good to see all the people that I haven't seen in a while and 
to meet all those that I've been meaning to run into. (I'm not even 
going to begin to name off names)

To those that had negative experiences, *find us SF Ravers!!!*! We 
don't bite and we're not hard to find. And together , I think we have 
enough vibe to fill a small country ;). 

Special thanks to Martin and the crew for yet another fantastic 
production...and I'll see all of you at the BBQ!!!!!!

Hugs,

CT

P.s. Branka, I hope you're leg is okay. I told you that you couldn't
     breakdance on the dirt! ;)

:) Hey people :)
I've only just joined the Sf raves mailing list a week or so ago, and I've
been patiently reading everybody's stuff, but I can no longer passively sit
back and watch. I have to get involved, become part of the cyberscene, if you
know what I mean.
Anyway, the main purpose and inspiration for me writing this is note to let
people know that I have been to many, many, many  raves and kickin' clubs and
parties in my life, all over the world, and the club called Mantra (on Sunday
nights) is without doubt one of the best I've been to.
In fact I wouldn't really call it a club, because the word "club" for me has
a kind of commercial, meat-market, bad vibe tone to it. Mantra is like a
secret underground party whose atmosphere reminds me of the first rave events
in England back in 1986-88. (You had to have been there to know what I'm
talking about, and maybe some of you were??)
I've been here in San Francisco only 3 months now (I'm an older hard-core
raver from England) and I've been going out to parties/raves/clubs about 4-5
times a week, always endlessly searching for the right people/place that has
good music, high energy, positive people etc. But I've never come across a
place that carries so much clear spirit as Mantra.
It will transform you and transport you to a higher vibration. This place is
sacred space, a trance-endental experience that is uplifting and rejuvenating
- food for the soul.
It helps if you're into psychedelic goa trance 'cos that's the music in the
main space (the DJs are Dutch, Surge and Theta Blip) 
But even if you don't like this kind of music, I swear you will LOVE it after
a while 'cos the vibe is so strong and pure and beautiful. 
Anyway if you need a different sound you can always check out the other space
- "The Temple of Osiris" where DJ Neal spins amazing down-tempo-lush-techno.
Much as I love trance music, I've been sucked in many times to this room
because the music is incredibly addictive.
I'm so happy to have stumbled across Mantra, and now I wake up on Mondays to
start work (after 2-3 hours sleep) and I feel refreshed and invigorated,
instead of trashed and knackered!! A new experience for me, for sure.
You know, I could go on and on and on (even more than I already have, believe
me!) about how much I love  everything within Mantra, but I think I've said
enough for now. I'm sure you all get the picture.
All I can say is come and check it out for yourself, it's a really special,
magical place, and surprisingly not many people seem to know about it yet
(though I predict that this is about to change soon).

Blessed Be

There is a big difference between being blunt, and being an asshole. 
Asking someone if they are still in diapers because they have 
reservations about going to BM certainly puts their comments in the latter 
category.  I am so tired of people being beaten with a bunch of PLURilist 
crap. I will say it again: PLUR DOES NOT EXIST IN A VOID! If you want to 
receive, you have to offer. If you are not willing to give, don't expect 
to get.

Ah, more hardcore fans :).  Through a joint effort, some of us acquired 
tickets by leaving 'Light' and  (thank you Ben who borrowed my 
truck) driving to the nearest payphone (15-20 mountain road miles away) 
...upon his returning we broke camp and took one 
last plunge into the deep river pool before saying 
our goodbyes..home through the Sacto Inferno to San Rafael by 8:30 PM.

Definitely, let's all meet at the Greek, it's a small intimate place and 
just thinking of experiencing DCD there, of entering their labyrinth... 
...sends chills down my spine...............

~~peace,  Maureen

Sorry to say you went to the wrong party. You should have checked out
Sweet a much smaller event. No fancy lighting or visual, just very
good music and an awsome vibe. It hapened at a restorant of all places.

*SIGH* Where to begin?

I was not aware the hexagons were consider satanic symbols. I guess we 
better start pulling down all those stop signs, because they are satanic 
symbols. Hey, everyone, don't pay attention to those stop signs! They are 
signs of the devil! Go Go GO!!!!!

I can only imagine that you are referring to a *PENTAGRAM* Pentagrams 
have been long associated with both white and black magik, but I suppose 
the distinction is lost on you.

I would love a further definition of "sterotypical satanic crap." Upside 
down crosses, baby coffins, goats heads? Any of those there? 

While I find your observations interesting, they seem *very* subjective. 
Have you ever stopped to consider that mask was "ram-looking" because you 
wanted it to be? Did you ever stop to consider that they were calling out 
to a daemon by another name, because that is what you wanted to hear?
Is it possible that you are confusing paganism with satanism, because you 
honestly don't know the difference? Have you ever seen the former as 
seperate and distinct from the latter?

I would like to know the title of that song. The concept of someone 
actually playing a tracks such as that seems rather far-fetched. Anyone 
else that has gone to ComeUnity ever heard such a track?

Funny, I didn't know that Niels was representitve of ComeUnity. Didn't 
ever hear him mention it either. Or is he just part of the conspiracy? 
Who are 'they?' People that don't agree with you? 

While I don't necessarily agree with the method with which Niels chose to 
respond(although he appears very knowledgeable about Judaism and 
Christianity, even in a tirade,) I offer him kudos in one important area: 
insight. While I saw no overt mention of Christianity in your original message,
the subtext was certainly present, and he caught on.

Personally, I feel that anyone that capitalizes the word truth, as you 
have, feels that they know what it is, not just for yourself, but for 
everyone, and has the annoying tendancy to go on ad naueseum about it, 
which is probably why you have the opinion that people jump down your 
throat when you choose to talk about it.

Do you purport knowledge of what the "REAL" vibe is for me, or for anyone 
else? If so, you are fooling yourself. Music is *A* language. And as a 
language, it can portray love, hate, melancholy, desire, apathy, and 
almost any other emotion, just as any other language. The listener also 
has a role in the interpretation of music, what a particular song means 
to *them* Music can be communal, or deeply, deeply, personal.

Freedom? What Freedom? To listen to you tell us the "Truth"? Sorry, I 
think the world has had enough messiah's to last it a lifetime...

Oops! Well, except for comic value the above is pretty worthless. Someone 
was so kind as to point out that stop signs are OCTAGONS and not 
HEXAGONS. I stand with bowed head....

I wasn't planning on entering this discussion but you should realize that 
pentagrams are spiritual symbols to many faiths other than satanism, such 
as Jewish Cabala and Christian Cabala. When you say you are posting "In 
Love of Truth" you must realize your posts are only half-truths at 
best. Also, you can't be offended when someone calls your posts 
"Christian". To acknowledge satan, one must believe in the christian 
dogma (or a deriviative thereof).

Can't believe i'm posting,

Hi All!

 I don't get to the City often as I do not have a car but I would Really 
like to go to Beautiful People this Saturday. So I would like to ask if 
anyone out there in cyberland is in a position to give a lift. I would of 
course be happy to help with gas but that is all I can afford. If someone 
would like me to drive I can (legally!!) do that as well.

 

THANX IN ADVANCE!!!!!  =)



Ran

Someone told me about this book they recently read (perhaps it was a movie),
anyway it was about a person who "landed" in another, rather "primitive"
world.  This person took advantage of the tribe and ended up attempting to
rape one it's members.  The tribe came upon this wrong doing and stood there,
in unity.  Without internvention, the attacker of course could not cary
through with his crime.

I am very sad about our dear brother Matt Lanier's decision to leave the
list.  I certainly hope he recondiders his decision, and realizes the value
of his input as a person and as a member of his faith.  I am more sad about
the passive tolerance and even support of such negative, degrading and
disrespectful posts such as those by our list mate Neils Mayer.  I suppose I
can now agree it be high time we take Todd's preverbial baseball bat to this
thread before any more damage is done.

pluR,

P.S. Matt: ...fear no evil...

P.S. Neils: I apologize for my politeness.

>From July 10-15th I'll be heading for my yearly camping trip with alot of
friends from the Sacramento and various other places. There will be  some
friends that are in a band that will perform and I will be spinning there.
A house set and a trance set. I've been saving up a trance set to blow
these campers minds away. Some of them are not into the scene and probally
haven't heard much of the music. So I'm going to try and take them on a
ride of there life. So, if anyone can spare some of that positive energy
please send it my way to help me out with my sets and as I start spinning,
I'll let that energy flow into me and then I will send  it right back out 2
folds into the night and hopefully hit everyone with a great force of that
positive energy. This will be the most people I've ever spun for. There
will be about 30 or so people there all having a great time. This is the
9th annual campout, and it get better every year.

Now for the hard part. I'm suppose to be leaving either tonight or tomorrow
morning, but I also have a playoff and championship softball game to play
weds night at 9pm and 10:10pm which means leaving at about midnight weds
and driving about 2 hours past Sacramento or not going to the game and
driving up to Sac meeting up with friends and caravaning there. I want to
go with everyone, since I'm driving alone. It would feel like I'm with
people on the way to the campsite, and being there from day one, or driving
at midnight alittle worn out from the games and driving alone. Even If I
wait until thursday, I'd still  be driving alone, and I'd miss a day and a
half of camping. So, what should I do? Any thoughts

Tim (knucklehead)

Speaking of geometric shapes, what about the PENTAGON! Isn't that
satanic? When I was in my senior year of High School, I got to
participate in this science awards thingie where they gave us kiddies
visits to of interest in DC. I visited the Pentagon because I was
interested in digital signal processing and got to speak to some DSP
experts there... I also felt a strong, dark presence, during that visit
but that might have been a hangover from shaking vice-president Bush's
hand.

I bet every country we've helped destroy (Vietnam, Iraq, East Timor,
Guatemala, etc) probably would agree with me that the Pentagon is
Satanic.

Also, what about those lighted Christmas star thingies that people in
some parts of Orange County (Southern California) put on their houses
during Xmas season. Those are five sided stars too, but they're not
upside down....

To quote from The Illuminatus trilogy by Robert Anton Willson and Robert 
Shay:

"There are a million holy books, in words and pictures and even in music, 
and they all tell the same story.  The most important lesson of all, the 
one that explains all the horrors and miseries of the world, is that you 
can get off The Wheel of Life at any point and declare that your trip is 
over.  That's okay for any given man or woman, if their ambitions are 
modest.  The trouble starts when, out of fear of further movement - out 
of fear of growth, out of fear of change, out of fear of Death, out 
of any kind of fear - such a person tries to stop the Wheel literally, by 
stopping everybody else.  That's when the two great bum trips begin: 
religion and government.  The only religion consistant with the whole 
wheel is private and personal: the only government consistant with it is 
self-government.  Who ever tries to lay his trip on others is acting from 
terror, and will soon resort to terror as a weopon if other's won't 
except the trip through simple persuasion.  Nobody who undersdtands the 
whole Wheel will do that, however, for such people understand that every 
man and every woman and every child is the Self-Begotton one: Jesus 
mother-fucking Christ himself."

Tristan.

Hey I happen to LIKE goats.  
 Why is it that they get this bad rap with being tied in with satan and such?
 Why not like, a chihuahua, or something (that's mainly because I don't like
chihuahuas)...

If it's than Pan thang (and I don't mean Peter), Well, he was an allright
joval sprite anyways...  I mean, ok the guy had cloved hooves instead of feet
and a sexdrive like a rabbit, but hey, we all have our faults...

Excellent threat dude! Baseball bat -- now there's a tool of divine
christian retribution if I've ever seen one! If you can't understand
it, destroy it! That's PLUR for ya!

Destroying interesting topics is an old Christian tradition -- like
when they burned the library at Alexandria (which amongs other things
contained extensive medical knowledge that some claim was as good as
anything we had up till the 1900's). This, more than any other act of
culture-reversion brought forth by the Christians precipitated the dark
ages. A time of disease, stupidity, poverty, war, and suffering in
which Christianity finally thrived, took root like a weed, and drove
out all that was good in human culture....

     Whoa!  And the "This is What You Want, This is What You Get" of the

     The flyer I got while I was in LA quoted:
     
     "Reinforced against the elements of darkness at a Legal Venue, with a 
     county approved Permit, Police Cooperation, Fire Dept Cooperation, a

     Wow... I wonder if they took their lawyer to the desert with them, or 
     if he/she stayed at the 'Legal' venue?

so i went to LA this weekend to check out one of their massives - 
stratosphere - to check out a friend spin and to experience LA energy 
again. unfortunetly they lost their indoor venue and decided to throw teh 
party in the desert. unfortunetly because they obviously wernt prepared 
for an outdoor party. needless to say it was total chaos come morning. at 
least a few 
generaturs gave out, and there was no music by daylite. after getting our 
truck stuck in desert sand and having a tow truck rescue us, we got to 
teh site about 3 - 3.3o am. at this time teh desert was dark with 
beautiful stars and the lights of lancaster in the distance. the middle 
soundsystem was playing some sweet goa (dj theo) and a shitload of lazers 
were firing off into the desert. people there seemed really disconnected 
from communal vibe but quite a few were incredibly into the music, like 
ive never seen in SF, but is common in LA. people just mob the speakers, 
hanging from them and heads in bass bins and a thick wall of pulsating 
human flesh absorbing the thick trance sounds. then that soundsystem gave 
out, and there was teh remaining two playing less hard trance and some 
trancy house. now the sun is illuminating the desert from below teh 
horizon and the tall yucca desert trees and and surrounding mountains 
turn colors with the approaching sunrise. there is problems with another 
soundsystem and only one is left. and then something quite amazing 
started to happen. people began gathering around the one soundsystem as 
one group, just crowding the speakers with people on top of 'em grooving, 
everyone fell in sinch and hands flew into the air as lite continued to 
illuminate teh desert. with every pulse of bass the crowd pulsed closer 
and together. this happened for about a half hour, till another 
soundsystem was turned on, one of teh larger ones with dj trance droppin 
the wax. the sun peeked over teh horizon and people scattered 
again. for an hour or so dj trance played some hard house and trance and 
then the last of teh generators gave out - and thus brought the party to 
an end. 
for some time i wandered off into the desert and had quite a spiritual 
experience with the immense yucca trees and other desert life. the sun 
was getting quite warm, and i just relaxed under teh shade of one of them.
     
and then we left.
     
there was quite a bit of potential, especially with that beautiful 
location (minus all teh garbage people left) but it was just too 
unorganized. from my experiences LA energy is quite different, but a well 
organized event there could really focus that energy into something 
wonderful. i hope they all learned something from their experience.
     
an interesting moment...
 - i was strolling a dirt road walking to our car when a group of 
ravers yell from their car "friends and family"  and take off. wearing my 
FnF laminate i just had a feeling that someone would recognize it, and 
felt a breif moment of solidarity with those ravers speeding away down the 
road in a trail of dust, knowing that somewhere, some time ago we were 
getting rocked at an FnF.
     
well thats the breif version of my weekend,
     
energy,
tom

One of the promoters of the event was Jason Jay. Anyone on the socal-raves
maling list would have told you NOT to attend this event. Jason Jay is...
how should we say... not the most respected promoter in LA. Stay away from
any events promoted by this man, even Magic Wensdays (which just got moved
to the Roxy.. huh), they are trouble. (Last fiasco was Futurama 2).

I think the only reason he went to Stratosphere was to see a good friend who was 
supposed to be spinning there, otherwise I'm sure he woulda been at the Light 
campout with all you other lucky folk! :)

OOOOPPPSSS!!

Sorry all! I live in Santa Cruz. ( cheeks a nice scarlet red )



Hi All!

 I don't get to the City often as I do not have a car but I would Really 
like to go to Beautiful People this Saturday. So I would like to ask if 
anyone out there in cyberland is in a position to give a lift. I would of 
course be happy to help with gas but that is all I can afford. If someone 
would like me to drive I can (legally!!) do that as well.

 

THANX IN ADVANCE!!!!!  =)

And how are people to know YOU aren't interested without asking?
Granted, it would be nice to have at least one "Hey what's up" for
every few "Want some E?"s.  But then I rarely approach people to begin
conversations so I ain't complaining.

It is somewhat disappointing how many times I've offered water to
people who's eye I catch (i.e., no interrupting of the dance-flow
involved) on the dance floor and gotten looks that seem to say "Get out
of my face".  But hey!

Everybody, please fell free to bug ME about this and anything else for
that matter, if I'm not interested in the offer or conversation I'll
let you know--assuming I'm capable (please take an incoherent
mumbling/rambling as "No thanks, maybe later").

Tim

    DCD-  is the band Dead Can Dance; completley non-rave music. 
Simply Beautiful! They are playing at the Greek Friday, August 9th.
I just purchased tickets: $25 ( plus the fucking $4 BASS service charge )
for general admission. Show starts at 8p.m.

	Black German Shepards are something to look out for, I hear.  There are 
some religions in today's world you don't have to be dogmatic at all to worry 
about.  I doubt you'll see them throwing raves though.

Wowser,

I think you're mistaking Satan with Clubland (TM). THey are both very
similar, and very different at the same time :-). Even worse, it sounds
like you were tripping pretty hard (did you take LSD? Did someone
"spike" your drink, or did you just forget to take your Lithium
supplement?). Did anybody else even see this kind of stuff happen at a
Come/Unity? 

Granted, I've only been to a few Come/Unities and the closest I can
imagine to this kind of stuff happening was that Zen Monk that did some
chanting, healing prayers, and bell ringing at the Malachy benefit in
'94 (i think). Maybe Richard Sun did his spectacle as well, which has
the evil content of, say, Cirque du Soleil. But hey, then again, even
the most benign Barnum and Bailey Clown can become EVIL under the right
circumstances!! And remember EVIL spells LIVE backwards!

Sometimes they like getting "dark" at raves (and industrial, rock,
etc); sometimes the DJ can do it without additional circus performers
setting the mood (e.g. R.Sun); sometimes they'll take you from "dark"
to "light" just to give you that redemptive feeling. There's a good
message to take home from all this -- look at how easily others can
manipulate your mood, then extrapolate that to President Clinton, Ralph
Reed, Bob Dole, or Rush Limbaugh speaking on TV or at some rally. Then
ask yourself about freedom of speech and democracy, and how free you
actually are.

Anyways, I think this "evil rave" thing, if it ever really happened at
all, is more a catharsis than real honest-to-god devil worshipping.
Much in the way people like seeing a good scary or violent movie,
people may just be getting in touch with their primal jungleistic inner
being that modern society (and especially Christianity) has repressed.
I've been to raves like that and I like it because of the primality it
evoked. I'd only be worried if they started telling you explicitly to
"worship satan" but then again, I'd be just as annoyed if they asked
you to "worship god".

At the same time I would have to agree that these could be pretty
psychologically powerful moments, and they CAN be used for the purpose
of "doing good" or "doing bad" -- I sincerely doubt that Come/Unity is
attempting the latter.  I think the same mass evocation thing happens
in a Gospel Choir going into a frenzy of dancing and singing (too bad
they mix in xtian symbology, but to my way of thinking, it's no worse
than using satanic symbology), or in the Nazi events that mixed
spectacle, music, rhythm, and an invocation of pagan, barbaric symbols
of the past to evoke conformity/strength. Clearly the latter was "bad"
but in many ways no worse than similar church-lead anti-communist
(communists being "bad" because they were atheistic) religious rallies
in the 50's-70's that helped us (for example) commit genocide in
Vietnam and throughout Central and South America.  The frenzy of a
large group of people can be powerful, scary and evil. Or good. 

One of these days people will just "do it" (the mass evocation thing,
not the athletic footwear thing) just for the sake of doing it, without
a message, without an ethos, without a war/cause to rally people ...
just because it seems like just as good a thing as going to work,
brushing your teeth, taking a big steaming dump, going to sleep, sex,
or whatever. A good deed and a good thing freely chosen. Perhaps
raving/dacing/communing is a way to "do it" without having to worry
about being psychologically manipulated (as it would in a gospel
church, nazi spectacle, or Christian anti-communist rally). 

I believe people should be free to choose individually what to do --
for example, some Jews believe that your good deed freely chosen
(without a church/temple or society telling you it is "good" or placing
a raver-approved PLUR stamp on it) turns you from a waste of skin into
something that makes your role in the universe "worth it" and makes the
the creation of "the universe" worth it because it enabled you to do
that good thing. (that worthiness and eternal betterment IS YOUR "SOUL"
-- THAT WHICH WILL DEFINE YOUR BRIEF ROLE IN HISTORY FOR ALL TIME,
nothing more). PLUR, as ethos, is completely pathetic in comparison
with this view. IMHO, if you can define it with a word, it's probably
not all-encompassing enough, and any word can be used in a lie. By not
making it trite and pronounceable, you're preventing that. So when
Christians talk about Heaven, Hell, Sin, Soul, and Satan, these are
just convenient comic-book concepts making some deeply abstract
existential concepts palatable to the masses... Taking these too
seriously as concepts/realities in and of themself is the reason why
most Christians are so fucked up. Taking the bible for anything more
than a piece of literature is also very misguided. The bible is more of
a literary time-capsule of words that you cannot interpret accurately
in this day and age (hermeneutics). Literal adherence to the words is
folly -- most Christians interpret the bible freely already (where
convenient). So feel free to read and interpret the Book, but remember
that it's no more relevant to life today than a play by William
Shakespeare or some Greek tragedy.

Well, I'm struggling through the work day here and am pretty unfocused, so

What? Yes the special effects rocked and it had potential but the plot
sucked. "Oh yeah I know lets use a computer virus on them!"  PLEEASE....
And like no one would notice a huge chunk of the moon going black while 
the mother shit passed in from of it... no one looks at the moon now a
days. If they going to spend 84 millions on the movie they might at least
get someone to give them technical advise, and a good writer to create a
belivable plot.

I'm still living and working in the afterglow from this weekend. Light 
Campout was one of the most incredible parties..
Lots of thanks to Gateway Systems for their love and energy, dragging 
that sweet soundsystem and the cool blue laser and the crates of oranges, 
bananas, peaches, plums, nectarines, grapes, breads, cookies, water, 
juices, generators, and all that jazz. thank you thank you thank you. 
Everyone should try to support Gateway and attend a couple of their 
parties every once in a while.. they are really great people

The Bible has been interpreted accurately.  See the New International
Version.  Not 100% accurately, of course, but closer to original intent
than any other written translation to date.

Crystal-clear to me.  This simply refers to Jesus, who was the Word, a
manifestation of the divine, and the architect of creation.  It's
completely relevant to life today, because it speaks of the beginning of
all that exists.
Shakespeare's plays and Greek tragedies contain many concepts that are also
relevant to life today.  The settings, no, but the stories, certainly.  In
light of this, it appears to me that your last statement in the top
paragraph of this e-mail is invalid.

believable plot? Aliens! Giant Spaceships! If you have a concept like that,
I figure you can make the plot as whacked out as you want... I admit I have
yet to see this film, but I'm really looking forward to it.

  From a recent review in the SJ MercNews the reviewer said to see
  this movie on the big screen since it would be "worthless" on video.

  Given all the special effects and action I'd tend to agree with that
  view.  I'm going to see it on the big screen if for nothing other than
  the visual fest is should provide. =:-)

Nope. One thing is to assume a set of axioms at the begning of the movie
and take it from there. In this case the axiom would be that Aliens exits
and they decidde to move into the neighborhood. But if you start making
random assumtions, and breaking any type of logic along the film you end
up with a bad plot (or an acid trip). Like someone said this aint no new
"Star Wars". But this has nothign to do with raves so I'll shut up.

Hello all,

This was my third Freedom and by far the bigesst and best for me.  My first
(or maybe 2nd or 3rd) rave of my life was Freedom in 93'.  In 93' I saw the
lasers on my way to the delta, said "what's that?", looked, went in,
Xplored and started my raving career that night...

Sound was great. Did anyone go up to the hill to dance?  It seemed just as
loud echoing off the hill as it did in the arena. Soo many tents this year.
I guess it's really catching on to have your own little chill tent.  I
borrowed a tent from my neighbor and gave it to kidee to set up.  I had no
idea what it looked like but I figured I would find my friends around it
some time in the night.  I never found my tent.  Ahhhhhh can you believe
it.  Not till it got light out did I find it.  The people were very
friendly.  I took my naval buddy, whose on leave right now to the party and
he was blown away by this party.  He was the one walking around with a
viedo camera, sorry if you got blinded by the light.

I have no idea what order the dj's went in but the music was sic all night,
except when someone bumped the tables during _____'s set.  I didn't see who
was up but he was after tony, and I bet he was pissed.  Sunrise was cool.
people were cool, music was cool, the dirt was uncool but as the saying
goes "God made dirt, dirt don't hurt"  (I'm not religious but thought it
might be humorus to say at this point on the list).  HHHHHMMMM what else
can I say.  Ohh yeah I met a few more sfravers and hung with the RFSF
(right front speaker family// I think this is catching on Sarvi)

Well I think this weekend I want to go check out Unlock the House.  I've
been hearing good reviews of this party in LA last Sat.

Anyone going to Movement tonight, I hear Tylor from LA is on with Kimo and
Graeme too.

Much love

There's already one SFR banner. You'll find it at F&F parties, I'm not sure
who's in possession of it though.

I want to hear some feedback on this...

I've been going to parties for over 5 years now...I've been DJing off and
on for almost 3...I think I've heard enough to know if a DJ is doing well
or not so well on a particular night. At freedom, I heard 3 DJ's beginning
with Dan, who were not having good nights. I'm not talking about
deck-bumping...I'm talking about falling out of a mix- or poor record
selection (songs that don't work together).

ALTHOUGH the music might have been good- meaning the songs were fresh, or
whatever, did anybody notice the bad mixing? Or were people just into the
music...or was the vibe cool enough that people didn't really care? I'm
just wondering, b/c it seemed pretty obvious to all my friends that
something was amiss...

This isn't a diss on the gathering, the dj's or anyone who had a good time
at the party...I'm just curious...

-peace-

I noticed exactly the same thing.  Since I started DJing a couple of months
back, I've been paying much more attention to the mixing styles and song
selection of the established DJ's out there, trying to pick up bits and
pieces along the way.

There were some killer songs played on Saturday, but the mixing was
definitely sub-par.  There was an instance during DJ Dan's set, for
instance, where I wasn't really listening to the music, as I was heading
out of the main arena for a little fresh air where the mix was _so_ off
that it totally caught my ear and made me turn around...Someone mentioned
that the decks got bumped at some point, so maybe that was the cause...

But there were alot of other goofups as well.  Alot of people seemed to be
"mixing on the fly" -- meaning that they were bring the cued record into
the mix before they had beat-matched them (they usually use the pitch
adjuster to get the records synched after a few measure or so).  That seems
to work for really housey tunes -- on smaller systems, but when you are
playing through a mega-wall-o'-sound, it really sounded off...And, yeah,
alot of the mixes sounded "forced", as if the tunes didn't really want to
go together, but were being mixed anyhow.

The jungle was pretty killer on the other hand, but some of the DJs had the
system up _way_ too loud.  The bass was totally getting clipped, and was
assaulting my ears to the point where I had to leave.

Oh yeah, and another thing...

Did anyone notice that the Simon Tune (Two Crates) got played twice within
the same 20 mins?  I thought I heard it, but I heard the second playing
from the bleachers and it could have been another heavy-bass acid track I
heard...

But, as Alex said, I'm not dissing on Freedom or the Gathering crew.  I
think that Martin is the only guy around who can pull off a massive like
that one.  No security problems, plenty of facilities (read: bathrooms),
and a generally cool crowd instead of the 'pose fests I've been to at other
massives (anyone check out Lucky Charms?)...

I think that some of the bad mixing was a product of the DJs being so
removed from the audience and having trainspotters weilding bright lights
and video cameras surrounding the booth.

     I don't know dill about DJing but,
     
     Although the mix 'dropped' a couple times as far as song selection in 
     my opinion, what a lot of people considered DJ error sounded like an 
     artist just 'going deep'.  I LIKE to hear a double beat, or a rough 
     blend every once in a while, especially if the DJ takes their time 
     doing it ... fades it in real slow and tasty... so it's not shocking, 
     but pleasantly disorienting.  Usually it makes me dance a little less, 
     and listen a little more, but if I'm already *ON*, it's great.  It 
     takes me somewhere that neither disc alone or mixed with a clean 
     matched beat could.  ((Horrified bystanders may have observed the rare 
     "my left side is dancing to this, and my right side is dancing to 
     that" phenomenon several times around 3:00 am.))
     
     I actually started feeling kinda sorry for the DJs towards morning 
     though, as I could see better, that shed started looking really small. 
      Not only that but people were hanging off of it, and walking behind 
     the DJs all night... I'd be afraid to move around at all while 
     anything was spinning in there.

     I do agree with Alex somewhat though...

You know, according to middle english legend and lit, Sir Gawain had a
pentagram emblazoned on his shield to symbolyze unity.

The Navajos were using the "swaztika" when Europeans still practiced
feudalism...

Symbols get borrowed and recycled (for good and bad) all the time...

related by Christ, have merit in this world. Love thy neighbor? Sounds
pretty PLUR to me...!  Also, many of the Greek Tragedies and certainly
Shakespeare have merit in today's world as well.  The general themes,
perhaps not the details, will be relevant as long as there is greed,
ignorance, friendship, love, or any other basic human feeling or emotion.

okay...the english major will quit preaching now...

Because the party started a little late (~9:30?) most of the DJ's sets were
cut a little shorter than the normal 1.5 hours... the exception was the
Idjut Boys set, which was two full hours. Polywog's set ended after about
an hour or so when the chill tent's generator ran out of gas.

Adder get his/her degree of Plur.  Let's be friendly to all.

Nick Philip played after Darkhorse. Polywog and I both had about 1.5 hour
sets. I'd never heard her play before. Pretty damn cool.

Yes, I know, I'm the 3rd to say it but...

The amazing thing about reading Shakespear and, more so, Greek anything
is how they show we have the EXACT SAME problems today we've had for at
least 2000 years, i.e., intoloerance, disrespect for the old religions,
youth against their parents, etc...  Take away technology and we're the
same pathetic (for still having the same problems) creatures we've
always been--add it and we can destroy our home too!

In other words, they're all very relevant today but most of us will
keep on missing the point.

Yeah, this is a really good point, Lee.   But if it's one of those "power 
vampires" you spoke of playing with "fun and games", then I would indeed 
interpret it as "tricks and lies".  DOmination is domination, whether by 
means of light or darkness, by subtle or obvious means.   If someone has 
a strong enough will, they can project thier value system of light and 
dark onto you, and it takes your own power to ward it off and remember 
the subjectivity of these uses of power.  I've been affected by both 
kinds of magicians, light and dark, so that's where my opinion comes from.

My reaction to Wowser was an emotional one, so thanks for inserting a bit 
of wisdom into the thread.

hell basked in the lurid glow. Vast space ships made us question our power
to defend our rave way of life from PLURless alien aggressors. Our San
Francisco trance power will save us! Chant our MANTRAS, broadcast on
Frequency 8 to the world's satellites!  
 
 God's ears burned just a little bit more, but they're always toasty. True
un/believers defended their un/faith; let's bathe in the pool of LIGHT,
let's meet again in the embrace of the beats, with the promise of new
days to come after the SUNSETs.  

 .... Thanks to all of you who have tolerated my posts over the years. 
I must admit that SFRaves has been my first chance to express myself to
a group of people - I just hope that others have gotten some amusement
or useful information from my messages out to our little part of the
international rave community.

 See you folks on the dance floor!

 Larry "Unsub Me , Major Domo!" Ching

Whisk.  Task.  Bask.  I quickly took off my mask.  They stared.
        That sharp pain grew from my belly.  I was scared...at first.
Rip.  Tear.  Twist.  So many were still covered.  Black mist.
        I saw eyes which were dark as night.  No.  No.  No light.

Words spewed forth from perverted lips, peircing other words spoken,
        For 'it' desired to molest all context.  Words written.  Broken!
Look how smart I am...it proclaimed loudly.  Proudly.  Proudly.
        Ignorance proclaimed 'it' had crucified Love yet again.  Sin.

Illusion was thrust upon blind, selfish children.  Tempt.  Hell sent.
        They learned to crucify.  Passify.  Break.  Take.  Lie make.
A moment came quite suddenly upon them.  Reflection.  Detection.  Aahh!
       Your games will be broken. Your 'powers' are just an empty token.

That sharp pain ceased.  Fear fled from places unseen.  Light increased.
        Nasty little beasts tried to steal. Kill. They could not feel.
A sheild rose high.  A sword appeared which pierced perverted tounges.
        It rang into desolate minds...as ignorance read these words:

                     Truth...Justice...Time....Choice

>that it's no more relevant to life today than a play by William
>>Shakespeare or some Greek tragedy.
>>


 Ahem!!!!! "Whereof one does not know, one should not speak"....And who do
we have today, pound for pound, who can match Aeschylus or
Shakespeare?Having taken a break from the list to write,read, and learn how
to spin, I don't think I could have read a more "tragic" human utterance.
Today's "relevant child" uses, on average, a daily working vocabulary of 300
words. Shakespeare's was over 50,000. As Pope indicated, Shakespeare said
things which had "oft been thought, but never so well expressed." his mind
invented many of the common metaphors that people use when trying to express
what they do not have words for, "but that's Greek to me."

  Shakespeare and Greek tragedy "not relevant"--Then I guess the sun or the
moon are no longer relevant, but "what's in a name anyway?" Or let's
see,exactly what part of human nature has changed in the last 600 or 2000
years??? That he (man) is greedy,
flawed,loving,hating,despairing,cunning,cruel, capable of acting only in
self interest, and divinely selfless, "the quintessence of dust."(Hamlet
ActII,scene ii,lines 312-319)...

 Consider a man who said, "If you cannot love, be silent"...(for)"all
creatures in this world exist through love, and lacking love,
lack all that may persist...or is yet to come."

 I am not as kind or insightful as Shakespeare, and for those who think
"independence Day" has something more to say about "aliens" than "The
Merchant of Venice"...I say, just be "silent."

Oh Yeah..I'm going out to my first party in a while..Syntonic(sp?)...If you see
and older raver...definately a Shakespeare type, I mean I teach "da
shit"..say Hi!! so I won't feel like an alien..you might be surprized...but,
then again, you'll find out sooner or later were all in disguise anyway and
only temporary residents of this planet....

B,

Goats are good.  They make cheese and milk, and entertain shepherds when 
they are far from their loved ones.

Tonight I made a delicious dinner using feta cheese as an ingredient. It 
was so good!

Long live goats.

And let's not forget the great goat Capricorn! Half goat, half fish this 
pungent half breed is a result (they say) of a saytr stealing from a god 
and fleeing that god's wrath. When cornered, the satyr asked Posiden to 
hide him. "Sure, jump in, the water is fine." replied Posiden. In jumped 
the satyr and the rest is history and a new astrological symbol.

Peace all.

Who is to determine what's accurate or not? The only person who  could
determine the accuracy of the Bible is someone who was there for the
entire thing. Old testament and new. Only person possible in your
"faith" is "god" him/herself. Summon that someone so that I recognize
him/her and have him/her tell me directly that everything in the Bible
is word-for-word true and I will believe! I do not share your faith, so
it's simply not good enough to tell me that some church elder told you
so, not even a gaggle of vatican-funded hermeneutic scholars... I've
already seen far too much evidence that your Church elders have sold
you a load of unbelievable bullshit (but then again, maybe you believe
in Santa Claus too). The fact that I'm supposed to have "faith" in said
bullshit makes me even more skeptical.

And if you had any background in Judaism or the Qabbala, you'd see that
"The Word" could easily have had completely different meaning from the
perspective of a different culture (trust me, in Hebrew it does). I
have a feeling the authors of "John" in the New Testamant were a lot
closer to that culture than you are, and a lot closer to it than the
authors of the "new international version". Chances are that nobody
alive today has even the foggiest of notions of the "correct"
interpretation of John 1:1 -- I'd say mine is just as valid as yours,
perhaps mine is more valid because I do not have the mirages of
Christian faith clouding my hermeneutic circle.

Invalid appears to be a relative term.  All I was saying is that the
bible is full of stories just like classical literature -- parables
which you might find applicable to life, or might give some historical
evidence on the evolution of Judeo/Christian thought; you could even
look at it as a comedy of errors and remark on what a bunch of foolish
dipshits your apostles are. To me, the bible is more of a soap opera
and comic book than the "word of god" as interpreted by men. 

But unlike Shakespeare or a Greek tragedy, people don't go around 
stabbing out people's eyes because they took a Greek Tragedy literally
as a code of behavior and the word of God. Unfortunately, there's some
pretty ugly words in the bible that Christians (and Jews) are all too
happy to act out, which is why we WILL see Christians shooting abortion
clinic workers, which is why we WILL hear of Christians beating the
living daylights out of a "sodomite", which is why we WILL know
Christians that preach hate for others while claiming they Love. And
these same CHRISTIANS will *ALWAYS* go back to some widely held,
twisted Christian interpretation of the BIBLE to back up their crimes
against humanity.

Here's my original words -- note that nowhere did I say that
Shakespeare or Greek Tragedies were irrelevant to life today, just that
the  bible is "no more relevant to life today" than other works of
classic literature:

Niels Mayer (and any who care to read),

Here's a tirade or two of my own, no excerpts included.

Intrpreting the Bible and other such works:

Yes it can be interpretted `better'.  As we learn more about the
customs, language and literary techniques of ancient peoples (those who
wrote the bible, old and new testaments, and those who's religions gave
birth to the bible) we are better able to interpret their writings and
understand their meanings--literal and figurative.  There are people
out there (Christians among them as well as people with no religious
affiliations) doing just that.  Granted they're not the ones you
encounter in everyday life but they're there and their findings are
available though it's much easier to just write it all off as ramblings
of various religious types.  There's even literal interpretations which
don't deal with god(s) but beings who's powers forced our very early
ancestors to treat and refer to them as such.

We can also take into account facts we know or learn about the writers
(or those to whom such writing is attributed) and by comparing related
religious texts, myths, etc... to decipher what's what.  For example
(and here's a major paraphrase from Joseph Campbell who spent his life
(80+ years) studying the world's religions and myths and who wrote much
on the subject:

The New Testament makes mention of the Virgin inception, but only one
apostle mentions it (name forgotten) and he happend to be Greek from
whence such myths had been common place.  Next thing you know it's a
major part of some Christian religions.  What does this tell us?  God
wanted only 1 apostle to teach us this?  Jesus told only one in
secret?  A man interjected his own believe's when he was claiming to
write God's words?  We can't be sure, but I'd say we're a damn sight
closer to the truth.

Obviously, this isn't what you'll learn in churches, temples, etc.. but
it's out there to be learned if you're interested.  And if you want to
continually spout on about it, then I'd say you should be interested.

Personally, I'm interested in where we came from physically, culturally,
intellectually and spiritually (whatever that means) and therefor am
interested in these `interpretations' founded in less religiously
biased traditions.


Mis-Interpretations:

People have mis-interpreted everything from their dog's bark to the
Beatles songs and some of them have killed people because of it--the
Christians don't have a corner on the market.  I wont disagree with any
of the acts you've attributed to them, just want to point out this can
be said about just about every religion, culture, etc... you can think
of (obviously on a smaller scale).  The criminal in all this is
humankind--that greedy, selfish, animal granted (by devine intervention
or not) `intelligence'.


Determining Accuracy (of interpretations):

In the end YOU (each and every individual) must determine what makes the
most sense in any interpretation (including physcist's interpretations
about how the universe works).  The more informed you are, the better
you'll be able to decide.


Prejudice:

Again, whether or not more people have died/suffered in the name of
Christianity or not, whether or not most people claiming to be
Christian are morons who completely missed the boat, to say (as you
have) that ALL CHRISTIANS are like this or to be blamed for this is
somewhat out of character of your otherwise intelligient, informed and
coherent ramblings on the subject.  And to completely leave out all the
other religions in your condmenation seems like you're playing
favourites or are you just going after the easy targets--come on,
challenge yourself.


Finale:

As far as Christianity goes, I think of it as living one's life
according to the teachings ascribed to Jesus Christ (whether or not
they were his original ideas is irrelevant) not necesarily what one
could get from studying the acts of those claiming to be
Christian--most people I know who do so claim, completely missed the
boat and are exactly like the people Christ is said to have been
speaking out against--I'd have to say they're not Christian).  By this
token, a Christian is a Budhist, is a ...

Hmmm...

It seems to me that Niels has several valid points, once I got past the
hostility.  Granted, the Christian religion has, in the name of God,
committed terrible acts, sometimes against their own flock (Spanish
Inquisition, anyone? anyone know any surviving Heugonots?).  But this
intolerance and hatred is not what Jesus Christ (whether he is fictitious
or not at this point is irrelvant - the impact remains the same) taught.
The doctrine he taught was one of compassion, mercy, and humility - it was
intended to replace the teachings of those before him, hence the "new
covenant" between man and god.  Jesus didn't spend time in the temple with
the Pharicees and other religious teachers. He spent his time with Lepers
and whores, if i recall.  Sounds forgiving enough to me. He went ballistic
when he came to the temple in Jeruselem only to find the corruption there
we find today in the religion.

All I am trying to point out is that, in ESSENCE, Christ was a proponent
of Peace, Unity, Love, and Respect. Religion is a tool of man to try to
(in purest form) explain the things we cannot understand. Somehow, though,
we managed to fuck that up as well as it has become a tool to manipulate
people.  Look at the Religious Right - nowhere does Christ propose hate,
ignorance, sexism, and racism as the path to "knowing God."  Buchanan,
Duke, and the rest of that flock are just dead wrong. they know nothing of
God, Love, Peace, or Understanding.

I feel that there are many roads to many truths, and ultimately people
have to follow what works best for them, and it is a trial-and-error
process - that is why so many of us get caught in a cycle that hinders
personal growth. The Taoists, Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, Wiccans,
Pagans, and any others all have a piece (some the same, some different) of
the puzzle, but I firmly believe that inside every one of us we have a
personal path just as valid as any one offered by an organized religion -
we just have to look for it.  Church never really did a whole lot
for me. Raving has helped me to get in touch with the personal truths that
I needed to find. To everyone a different path, I guess.

I am pretty sure my higher power lives around 140 bpm...

I'm only 20, so maybe I'm just full of youthful idealism (read: shit...),
but I am pretty sure that guy from Liverpool got it right when he said:

"all you need is love"

;)

giant steps,

There is a quote from one of the Gospels (can't remember where, don't have
time to look it up) where Jesus is hungry on the road and he finds a fig 
tree.  He's all happy and then discovers the fig tree has no figs on it 
(i would assume that a. it's not fig season or b. someone else ate em 
all).  So he damns the tree and says it will never have figs on it 
again.  Could someone please explain this in the context of his peace, 
love and generosity?

Yeah, you know some of us still like movies that allow us to use our 
imaginations and be creative.  No, I did not nit-pick the movie for

some critics gave it bad reviews.  Most critics are so anal they are

Very much agreed!  Besides Wayne Correia and Knucklehead, Black Adder and 
Reagan Reid are my closest friends off this list. Guess you'd have to 
know him in person to get it....

Mike,

        It's been my experience that Black Adder's voice of reason is very
frank at times, and generously accented with sarcasm.  It appears to me
that he often intends to encourage people to think, and also to not take
some things too seriously.  Am I on the right track, Adder?

Peace,

- E

I guess he really, REALLY wanted some figs... I once damned a coke machine
to hell when I realized it was fresh out of Mr. Pibb's.

Maybe it means: "even the peaceful, loving, united respectful people can
sometimes get angry at stuff and damn it to hell."

o.k. - here's an attempt at deciphering this:

it isn't literal - it's figurative.  the fig tree is the ungenerous man,
who, having given to some, refuses to give more of himself to others as
they ask it of him.  the lesson is that we give of ourselves not from a
limited resource, but instead that as we give we are ourselves enriched
and have even more to share.  at least, that's how it's supposed to work.

otherwise, look out, cause jesus is a comin'.

wow, you'd almost think i was christian ... did i mentioned my theory that
jesus raved?

i also seem to recall gawain decapitating a woman and then carrying her
body around until the next pentecost, plus sleeping with the green
knight's wife and then later trying to kill him.

perhaps gawain is not the 'family values' poster child the pro-pentragram
factions have been seeking ...

I too noticed a few skips and mis-mixes last Saturday. As for the
skips, I thought it might have been caused by all the dust circulating
around, and interfering with the stylus. As for the mismixes, well...I
let it slide, because the music selections were very good, and the
vibe was really on. Had the event been in a more controlled
atmosphere, I may have been more critical about it. Sometimes I like
it if a DJ is experimenting with new material during a performance,
even if it means an occasional mismix.

I've heard really excellent mixing from DJ Dan in the past, and am
looking forward to better sessions with him in the future.

Rave on,

     A. The tree was growing in a mildly radioactive water table region.  
     Although travel through the region would not be considered harmful, 
     fruit grown there might have a high enough concentration to affect 
     young children.  He did it for the kids.
     
     B. Perhaps the all knowing understands how bad it hurts a fig tree to 
     bear fruit, and wanted to keep it from anymore trauma (having been 
     stripped of it's current fruit inventory).  He did it for the tree.
     
     C. Perhaps Jesus met the person who ate all the figs, and asked them 
     "did you eat all of the figs".  the person who ate all the figs lied 
     and said "No".  Jesus then taught the jerk a lesson by neutering his 
     fig tree.  He did it for the fool.
     
     D. The figs are a symbol of goats.  He did it for the goats.
     
     E. Figs are pretty ugly, and a lot of people passed by this tree.  In 
     the spirit of love and generosity, perhaps this could be considered an 
     "urban beautification project".  He did it for the people.

There is a quote from one of the Gospels (can't remember where, don't have 
time to look it up) where Jesus is hungry on the road and he finds a fig 
tree.  He's all happy and then discovers the fig tree has no figs on it 
(i would assume that a. it's not fig season or b. someone else ate em 
all).  So he damns the tree and says it will never have figs on it 
again.  Could someone please explain this in the context of his peace, 
love and generosity?

ok, so maybe the moral of the story is [drum roll please]

well of course he said it cause it was fucking disrespectful and immature of 
that tree not to have figs when HE wanted some.
the tree can actually be quite grateful he didn't turn it into firewood.


if this should really be in the bible it would be one of the more harmless 
examples of stuff in there that makes me wonder, how in the world 
christians who *really* relate to the bible do get along with it. i mean, 
hey, when moses led his people into the promised land, according to the 
bible they literally butchered the inhabitants there alltogether in the most 
cruel way, for no other reason but because they took up space. 
and guess who said : 
an eye for an eye, and so on. guess who made long and detailed demands how 
he wanted his altar to be, with neat little golden flowers here and small 
ribbons there. well it was god himself.  according to the bible. 
you can take this literal, you can take it figural or sideways, 
it will never in any way be compatible with what is normally understood 
to be christian.  i take it the  concept of 
christianity is mainly determined by the new testament, which i haven't 
read yet and which seems to contain all the stuff about turning the other 
cheek and love your neighbor and let the children come to me, but finally: 
jesus is only one part of that holy trinity. how can one believe in one 
part and deny the others. so do you bible friends ignore the 
other parts, or are they simply not in there in the new international 
version?  
don't get me wrong, i don't have anything against religion, on the 
contrary i feel a certain inclination towards it, probably because my 
country is effectively atheistic and i can't help thinking that some 
people here will definitely fry in hell for their self-sufficient lack of 
spirituality. 
and the bible is kinda neat and kinda cool, but i can't understand how 
somebody can build ones belief on it or something.
i am really interested in getting informed, so if maybe eric could spare 
a few minutes or somebody??
thanks, and best wishes
ulrike

Red Rock Beach is a very wonderful place in Marin County.

For more info check out this url...

I'm hope I can make it to the party (though I'm working my ass off on a 
rather big deadline). 

Take care... JoB.

Redrock Beach is on the other side of Stinson Beach in Marin.  Hot location 
for those nude sunbathers (not that I am or anything)!  F-8 should have 
further directions, though.  My honey talked to Mars at "Space Teddy" and 
they were coordinating about torches for the beach.  If anyone has extra 
tiquey (not sure on spelling)torches, I'm sure they'd be greatly appreciated!

=) Hello everyone and anyone =)

Does anybody out there know anyone who would be willing to host a trance
event on Sunday 28th July??? This is for the Sunday Mantra people
(Dutch,Surge,Theta Blip and DJ Neal) because they can't use their regular
space at Clementina Alley for that night only.
They need a warehouse space and are willing to pay cash to use it for the
night (10-3 am or quite possibly later) like $200-300.
Please E-mail me with any ideas (RavenLaFay@AOL.com)
Thanks
Love and light
***Raven***

Dear All;

        As a Test Engineer, it is my duty and responsibility to make sure
things that I test are traceable back to NIST, who are tracable back to ISO.
Anything that has been laid into the hands of human beings for safe keeping,
is not, and cannot be considered even remotely accurate, and is at best,
ficition. It's all data in the end.

Peace

i think i figured it out - when god was young, he was into a more clubby
attitude, and everything had to 'just right' or god would get pissy.
he also was more concerned with his 'rep' and would have his followers
lay some sick shit on other tribes just so word would get around that
'god was in da house!'  later on, god chilled out and got more into trance
- he spent a long time hanging out in the far east and spawned off some
mean meditation trips.  then, he came back to his old club pals (who were
trying to get into 'roman-style' but weren't liking it too much) and
that's when he laid this whole new groove one them with jesus etc.  but
you can still see the remnants of the 'old-skool' god with stuff like that
regrettable fig-tree episode.

-matt.

p.s.
while we're talking figs ...
another nasty one to check out is (i think) elijah and elisha humping
their way around canaan on a donkey, when some kids started jeering at
these two crazy, raggedy guys - that pissed one of them off (elijah?)
and he cursed the tots - whereupon a she-bear came up and slew the kids.
what ever happened to 'kids will be kids'?

and this really is in the bible.

Alright.. we need a new thread.

Why is it that Ravers seem to identify with Aliens/symbols of Aliens?  Is it
because we feel we are cultural aliens transcending society?  Or something else?

Is it just a fad?

Have we all been abducted?

Who likes aliens?  (I do!)

and Rat Dog (with Bob Weir) will be there . . . my BASS tickets ($30 +
monopoly rent) say the show is at the "Oregon Country Fairground" . . .
there will be camping made available

I remember Vince telling me at Tribal Future that he would be at the fair
in some capacity or another . . .

We do?  Yeah, those wierd posts about Raving were really starting to
bother me.  Good thing I have a Delete key so I can filter that garbage out.

Nothing is going on.  Remain calm.

You have the good aliens, those that talk to us through the technology
we are creating.  The ones that are trying to induce global spiritual
trancendance that will eventually save the world.

You have the bad aliens, who are colonizing the Earth and raping its
resoucres, and they distract the natives by brainwashing them with
electronic media.  

Both use advanced technologies that few Humans understand.

> Is it just a fad?

No.  People have always been keenly interested in the unknown.  Those
that can explain the unknown can do cool things like punish Fig trees.

> Have we all been abducted?

No.  Remain calm.

> Who likes aliens?  (I do!)

Which ones?

Aliens are symbols for the unknown.  Aliens are symbols for those that
hold power over us.  Aliens are symbols for the beings that will someday
save us from (...whatever...).  The conspiracy is we are the 
conspiracy.

You may be interested in subscribing to abducted@schwa.org by sending a
message to:

majordomo@schwa.org

and including the word:

subscribe abducted

In the mean time, I highly recommend purchasing a Schwa Survival Kit,
available from Housewares (aliens make great marketing tools)... double
meaning.

Funny, the bible never mentioned all the other people who Elijah

And that's too bad,   The F-8 promoters thought that Harmony's shing ding was
going down on Friday but....  

Oh, well so much for the misinformed....

To my understanding there is no amniosity(sp?) between any of the promoters
(Harmony, Cloud Factory and F-8).   It just happens to be a great night to
throw  an event...

I'll be @ a small 420 parite in Berk for the begining of the night and end up
@ the F-8 gig (gotta love cybertrance...)

Redrock is located on the other side of Stinson Beach in Marin.  It's the hot 
place to do your nude sunbathing (not that I would know or 
anything)....anyways my honey and Mars were talking about getting tiquey 
(hope that's how you spell it) torches together for the night.  The more 
torches the merrier!  Anyhow, I'm sure F-8 will have info on directions when 
you buy your tickets!

We all know that Technics 1200's are alien tech.  Someone posted this a
while back:

Oh yeah, technics turntables are actually satellite receptors that tap
into gaia-one and draw energy out through the conductive receptors in the
tone arm.  The disc (or vinyl/record/wax/UMMM THATS GOOD DRUGS 
I CAN KEEP FOREVER!) is actually like a key or access node into the massive 
amounts of energy in gaia-one.  The art of mixing comes from the dance the dj
must do in order to attract hyper dimensional space elves who are masters of
aligning musical energy.  The dance is done by holding your hand on the
pitch slider and moving it really slowly.  The elves decide when the beats
line up and you must put your faith in them.  Then if you take your time
and appeaze all the forces that be circling around the room as you mix, a
dimensional portal may be opened if the musics align properly (but nothing
will happen if they are not).  This dimensional portal gets created when
the energies flowing from one disc can find room to continue to flow as the
other disc gets louder.  If one disc pushes the other disc "off" it's river
of sound the effect is ruined.  Through this dimensional portal you have
direct access to the ear/energies of the gods and godessess of gaia (most
people call them aliens/angels)   Once you do this once they can reset your
internal compass so that your path goes to, hmmm, the happy place.  This is
how I mix.

  Watch out which records you play or you may end up in a dimensional of
beautiful busty bondage biker babes with bad additudes, whips and hmmm,
maybe I should just let you explore...

Okay, this falls into the category of Kinda Rave Related (KRR), so I 
thought I'd post it here first :)

I need someone to help with the graphics on a few rave/electronic music 
websites that I'm working on.  For example, one of the things I'm doing 
right now is Rampant Records webpage.  I need someone who can design good 
imagemaps - the kind you see where several pictures are seemlessly pasted 
together in a neat fashion.  I'm pretty good at logos, buttons, and small 
graphics, but I need someone who has DOPE PhotoShop skills :)

I posted this here first because I'd like to give everyone here a chance 
at this first.  I know there's a lot of graphics hotshots here (ie 
Mike Migurski :) that would probably fit this category.  This would give 
anyone an opportunity to work on some cool sites, get some exposure, and 
make a little money.  So if you're interested, please drop me a line, and 
if possible, some links to examples of your work.

John

>> > Why is it that Ravers seem to identify with Aliens/symbols of Aliens?

probably has somethng to do with the popularity of Alien Workshop skate
stuff (damn, they have some really hotshot graphic designers over there!).
Plus, they're a cool symbol of "other-worldliness." I try to stay away from
the whole alien/UFO thing in my work (pretty cliche) but I'm really tempted
sometimes... The alien head image is so simple and so expressive... and all
the cool visual jokes and analogies that go along with it... wow!

of course I'm looking at the question from an almost totally graphic POV.

Ok here's the scoop...


Techno is actually a language to commune with our extraterriteal brothers
(and sisters)... Apparently the "Darker" Aliens like slower beats (note the
rythmic "countdown" in ID4) while the "Lighter" otherworldly visitors perfer
faster, trancy tunes... Hence a light side and a dark side...
Now If you listen to the radio, you'll notice those hip hop commercal staions
have some deep bass thumping music... all pretty slow BPM standards.. It's
the hypnotic vive that's bring the bass to slower and slower beats.. soon it
will be a sloooow drooonee and the Dark ones will come....

But there is still hope!!! We, the underground, need to keep throwing illegal
parties, playing faster music (jungle, gabber, trance, happy hardcore...) to
mix up thier singnals.. Why do you think the police come enmasse to distrupt
our parties while so much REAL crime is being commited??? Cos' we're
interferring whit the "master plan"... We are the Rebels of the future
attempting to bring the sides (E.T's, that is) of the light to help and guide
us...

But Iv'e told too much now and I must go back into 'Lurker mode'...

(and to think some peole actually believe this...)

"dance with me..."

Hi all!,

    Well, I just wanted to clear any misinformation, before this gets 
wierd...

    There are NO bad or mixed feelings between any of these production 
teams. I personally did not know that F-8 was even doing a party until 
today. Also, I did not know that Pro Soy was doing a party until after 
I booked Jon Bishop and started organizing this Beautiful People.

    So coming from us (Harmony), is all the good wishes and love in the 
world to the F-8 and Pro Soy crews. The only thing is, I wish I could 
be there!!! 

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Greg :)

My guess is that Raves attract "Wanderers".  What is a wanderer, you ask?  A
wanderer is an alien soul reincarnated onto this planet in human form.  This
isn't my idea, mind you, its a concept originated by the channeled entity
known as "Ra".  Whether or not you actually believe in channeled beings, the
concept itself is worth some thought.  I mean, if you believe in
reincarnation and the existance of ET's, as I do, its conceivable that ET's
could end up reincarnated in human souls.  Such individuals would have
common characteristics like:

       - a feeling of alienation from society
       - strong identification with UFO phenomena
       - a love for new technology
       - a call to service (RA sayz aliens are here to help)

Certainly, all the above are things that call or apply to Ravers.

If the son of god, the same guy who could walk on water, create an endless
loaf of bread, bring sight to the blind and raise Lazarus from the dead,
walked up to YOU and said, "Grow figs baby!", how could you not grow figs?
I wouldn't matter if you were a tree, a rock, or a Raver.

The only way you COULDN'T grow figs is if you said, "Bite me Jesus!  I'm a
devil lovin' spawn of Satan and you and that God guy can kiss my hairy
buttucks."  At that point, DAMN is a bit redundant.

More literally, if Jesus calls you into service of mankind, the only way you
wouldn't be able to do it is if you were totally and eternally damned.
The good news is that there are a bunch of other teachings in the bible that
no matter how bad a shape you are in, no matter how far back you've slid
from good, you can always come back.  The christ power, when it comes to the
human soul, is so powerful and so complete that he would never, ever have to
damn you just because there are no "figs" on your branches.

IMHO, this is one of those more powerful and pure christian teachings.  It
the sort of stuff that reforms hardened criminals and causes men and women
to dedicate their lives to the betterment of humanity.

Same goes for the ProSoy crew, I'm not really throwing the party per se 
but know that no one doing the main organizing has any animosity toward 
the others, my suggestion to everyone going out is to keep the numbers of 
all the parties with you, because as i understand all three are supposed 
to be less than 300 so if one fills up you can go to another =)

love scott

have a good weekend (and come to the cloudfactory party next week ;)

 Wow. Your post has me Trippin'! I recall a very detached, surreal state
of mind I was in one time when I had the distinct impression that  I was
an energy projection (from the future/another dimension?) inhabiting a
body that was essientially like an enviromental space suit. The problem
was that the "suit" imposed it's concerns over mine and eventually I
forgot my purpose for being here (which I'm still am not sure on?). The
focal point of this experience was this radio-like contact that "home
base" was trying to reestablish with me.

 This was years before I discovered the concepts in the role-playing game
"Dream Spell", which deal with the ideas in the two above posts.

"Mr. Data, do you see a potential solution for this problem?"

"Yes, Captain. We can modify the modulation of the flux capacitors on the
main deflector array, which will generate a positronic beam that we may
direct at our target."

"Make it so."

"Modifications are complete, the deflector is ready and standing by."

"Activate the beam..."

P.S. Good luck!

Pentagrams get a bum rap too.  Their association with "evil" is fairly recent.

I saw a book in a used bookstore in Palo Alto a while back.  It had a pentagram
emblazoned on it, pointing down.  What manner of sinister text could this be?

It was a geometry textbook, printed in 1903.  The pentagram contains the
golden ratio,
and has some other interesting properties as well  which is why it was the
symbol of
the ancient Pythagoreans, who picked it up (along with everything else) from the
Egyptians, where it has been (_very_ recently) traced back to before Ramses.

The difference between a pentagon and a pentagram is that one term switches
from real to imaginary.  Imaginary terms are what tone and rhythm are made of 
(When a simple exponential switches from real to imaginary, you get a sine
wave).

The difference between a pentagram pointing up and one pointing down
is not one between "good" and "evil".
It is the difference between stasis and motion.
You have all seen the picture of the pentagram superimposed on a human form
(the top point is by the head, the next are by the arms and the next the legs).
Now superimpose that pentagram on a DANCING human form!

The pentagram is a very appropriate symbol for the kind of magic that we
all experience when we're dancing and everything is going off.
It is time to reclaim it.

In early 1995 Kevon Banks (Funky Techno Tribe) introduced me to
Mike Robbins because he felt that we had similar musical tastes 
and ideas for a more "progressive" "spiritual" rave.
We did. And we wanted to keep it inexpensive and small.
That was easy, because neither of us had any money. :)

I owned a functional coffin, and Mike's roommate, Eric Newman had
two decent speakers.  Great! Let's have a party!  Where?  My small
studio apartment in Stinson Beach - let's keep it small and see 
where it goes!

What to call it?  From conversations Mike and I had about Navajo 
teachings of evolution and higher vibrational levels, the three of us
came up with FREQUENCY 8.  Mike became MARS, Eric became MysterE and
I'd always liked my unusual last name - Cyr (pronounced seer)

1st Party - 15 people, 2nd Party - Over 40 people and the walls were
sweating!  Still no money.  :(
What to do?  Rent a sound system (on my overtaxed credit card) and see
if we could keep it going.  I've lived in Stinson Beach for over 10
years, so, with the help of "locals" who've always preferred to remain
anonymous, we moved to the woods.  Over 100 people and we broke even!

We kept it up - every two weeks, all last summer into the fall 
advertising only on SFRaves and printing 200 flyers for friends.
When the weather got too dry, we moved to Red Rock Beach (my fantasy
fulfilled - playing with the waves in the early morning) AND we
had the BEST crowd!

3 or 4 guys hauling all that equipment down to the beach is never easy,
(MAJOR understatement) and hauling it up in the morning is even worse.
Adam G was always a major help.  Dino, too.

When the idea for the store came up, I neither had the money to invest or
the time, so, I chose to remain associated with the party only.

Life was good and we enjoyed inviting new people to play with us.
Along the way we lost several hundred dollars (out of my pocket)
but, we were sure I'd get it back some day.

July 1996 - After over 20 parties, I am told, indirectly, that I quit
Frequency 8.  I'm out.  I'm not playing this week.

This really sucks. And hurts. I spent so much time promoting, lugging
tons of equipment, losing money.  And neither Mike nor Eric has the honesty
to talk to me.  I've often asked you sfravers to support this party.
Not now.  How could I?

grace.  Hey raverundoes!  Despite our differences, I will say many of you
out there are extremely delightful, funny (ha. ha.) and quite thoughtful.
So many of you made me smile tonight with your humor, graceful wit, charm
and outright intellengence.  While we may argue at times, we are thinkers.


Umph.  There it is.

A friend of mine is looking for a roomate.  She lives in Berkeley in a 2 
bedroom apartment.  The apartment is off Ashbey street.  I think the 
share of the rent would be $330.

If you are interested please e-mail me with your phone number and I will 
give her the info so she can call you.

Thanks,
Branka

...and there's plenty of stuff in our own Hyperreal archives.

My mom last sat night: "You're not going to one of those rave things,
                      are you?"

Me: "Naw mom, I'm just going on a campout with a few thousand of my
     closest friends!" ;)

Actually, I think it shows a more humanistic nature to raves, and not the "uh,
so when's the next party?"
-yea, humans tend spam on each other if they dont belive OUR beliefs.  
But we are learning.  
And if So-cal (or any other list for that matter) can learn from our
mistakes....Then they become wiser from our folly.

"dance with me..."

Marco,
I'm going up...leaving today and I'd love the company if you can go today
also.  I've rented a car - a Geo Metro which is supposed to get some
astronomically high MPG, so costs should be low.  I'm picking up the car
right after work and leaving a.s.a.p.  You can reach me at the number in my
sig file until 5:00 - feel free to call if you'd like to come!

"No animals or aliens were harmed in the making of this film."

   (spotted in the credits of _Independence Day_)

I tend to agree with Mr. Mckenna when it comes to aliens.  Maybe we're 
the aliens, ya know?  Collective unconscious, or future humans (post 
sapiens) breaking through to try and tell us something?

Or maybe they're just slimey Borgs who want to kill us all, and we should 
listen to the global-wagon circling memes of ID4.   ;-)

        My company, Virtual Sites is in need of 1 - 3 interns who can
        put in 10 - 20 hours a week learning/doing various tasks in a
        small ISP.  Virtual Sites primarily provides Web space to small
        and medium size companies but we also provide dedicated ISDN and
        Frame Relay connectivity to a number of firms.  You can visit our
        home page at http://www.v-site.net.  Some of the tasks that need to
        be done are:

                Web site installation.
                Web site maintenance
                Network Monitoring
                Web site authoring
                Customer Relations
                Network Engineering

        This is an intern position (basically we can't afford to pay
        a salery) but there are definite perks. You get to have plenty of
        webspace for your own projects, you get to learn an awful amount
        about the operation of the Internet and you get to meet and hang out
        with other kool raver types.  The Internships lat for 2 - 3 months,
        we can also work with your school if you want it to be work-study
        credit.


        If you are interested send some e-mail with a resume to
        webmaster@v-site.net Please put INTERNSHIP somewhere in the
        Subject header.

Regarding a collective unconscious, I happened to be using the bathroom
at Mantra and thinking this very thought (that feeling of unity 
consciousness) trying to put my thoughts into words when I looked
up and on the left hand wall among the various other graffiti messages
was the beautiful sentence, "I am swimming in a sea of souls". Also,
in an astrology report, the Neptune Transit portion says:

----
The planet Neptune in the current sky above us points to how we let go,
relax, and find that common thread -- communion. It is connected to our
imagination and our dreams too. Neptune can inspire us to share in a 
communion vision with others. "The dewdrop slips into the shining sea."

An appreciation for ideas and thoughts that are quite other-worldly 
is upon you. It is easy for you to love and be compassionate and to
value what life offers. You have a sense of unity and humanhood that 
will stay with you. A renewed set of values.

Insights into your deeper, more spiritual nature are available to you
during this period of time. You may be able to discover whole new areas
of your psyche or mind that have been closed up to now. Insights into
dreams and ideals.

A time to reach beyond the physical into the realm of myths and dreams.
You may have the sensation of being awake within your own dream, and 
reality may be like you dreamed it could be. This is a time for visions
and seeing the UNITY BEYOND DIFFERENCES.
----

I forgot to bring in the story called "The Promise" which was the
basis for last weeks "The Promise" party on Wednesday. I'll be sure
to bring it in next week and post it to sfraves.

Peace All!
John

Dear All;

        Yes, YES THAT'S WHAT WE NEED!!!!! A Naked rave; at Baker Beach, ok
who's got the guts on this, who's crazy enough; I guess the DarkinEs^2 will
have to do it. Look forward to details about SF and maybe even the world's
firstnaked rave.

Don't you think it would be hard to dance (both from female and male 
point of view)?  I personally don't have anything against nakedness (I 
did grow up in Croatia where nude beaches are a normal thing), but I am 
not sure if I would go to a naked rave....

Bad things about it
- could be cold
- body parts all over the place (maybe if there were see-through holders)
- some people would show up just to look at other naked people not to 
rave which would be not comfortable for some people 

Good things
- it could be pretty cool :)

P.S.  At Tribal Future there were some people that were naked - mud baths 
and hot tubs, but it wasn't planned - it was just natural and it was fun 
and normal - I think making it a planned thing would ruin the spontaneity

Holy sheat batman! this sounds too good to be true...I wonder how good it
works...I cant help but speculate on how neat this could be to work into a
rave...imagine...hook up the link instead of to the video game drone into
the master control to the lighting system...then the lights would be
synched into everyones brainwaves...which are synched by the music which
is synched by the dj which is synched by the crowd...wow!... circular
causation at its finest...now if only the music production could be more
closely tied to real time crowd intentionality...

I've got a pair of Cambridge Soundworks Model 7's ($260 for the pair when I
got 'em 2 yrs. ago)

These speakers _rock_.  They're really solidly built, come in nice
cabinets, and cover all the frequency ranges _really_ nicely.  Plus, they
come with a 5 year guarantee.  Check them out.

A word of advice, however...When you go into the store, the guys will take
you into a listening room and show you all their stuff, starting with their
top-of-the-line model first.  By the time you get down to the system you
can afford, you are terribly depressed and disappointed.  Don't be -- they
still sound awesome, but when compared to their best stuff (which is
_epic_, BTW) they kinda leave you wanting more.  This is an illusion.  The
model 7s are great for bedrooms and small to medium sized living rooms.

Dear Audio & Computer Geeks;

        First, I will be in the market shortly for some computer multi-media
speakers + sub, and a digital IO card for the PC running Windows 95. Any
suggestions?

        Also, I'm running Windows 95 on a P166 PCI/EISA/ISA mother board; a
SCSI subsystem using an Adaptec 2940UW; running SCSI 2 Wide Fast Drives and
am getting like 297 MFLOPS as a benchmark. A system I designed and put
together myself, compares or is equal to a Gateway P166; per Wintune. I was
wondering if I should expect more or less performance from a system such as
the ones mentioned above.

        Please respond privately to both ?'s

Thanks
Brian

The Millennium bug: experts see computer chaos in 2000

WASHINGTON - A technology industry group is painting a grim picture of the
potential havoc on computer
systems around the world from the so-called millennium bug. 

The failure of many computers to recognize the date 2000 properly could
disrupt vehicle traffic, paychecks,
benefit calculations, security systems and even weapons systems, the
Information Technology Association of
America said. 

Fixing the problem is going to cost businesses and governments literally
hundreds of billions of dollars, the
ITAA says. 

"I don't want to be in traffic, I don't want to be in an elevator in a
tall building, I don't want to be anywhere
computer dependent on Jan. 1, 2000," says Nancy Peters of Software AG, in
Darmstadt, Germany. 

The problem arose because computer programmers in the 1960s and 1970s -
when storage space was tight -
used two digits to represent a year instead of four, expecting the
programs to be obsolete before the millennium. 

Most computers, lacking human intuition, either think that "00" means 1900
or reject it completely as an invalid
date. 

Unless the problem is fixed, the U.S. Treasury will be unable to write
checks dated 2000 and computers will
reject birthdates in that year, Peters said Wednesday at an ITAA
presentation to members of Congress. 

City traffic signal systems, which depend on computers to tell them which
days fall on weekends and which days
are holidays, also would be in chaos, she says. 

Since Jan. 1, 2000, falls on a Saturday, the first workday will be Jan. 3. 

The problem is cropping up already. Some cash registers refuse to accept
credit cards with expiration dates in
2000. Employees type in 1999 instead. 

William Scully of Phoenix-based Viasoft said every company his firm
examined had major problems,
compounded by the fact that systems were interlinked and interdependent. 

"Systems are so intertwined that it's very difficult to touch one file,
application or system without having an
unanticipated effect somewhere else," he said. 

ITAA estimates the cost of fixing the millennium bug will be $300 billion
to $600 billion worldwide - based on
an estimated cost of 80 cents to $1 per line of new program code. That
would mean an average cost of $4 million
for an average-sized company. 

Recognizing the size of the problem, Nebraska has implemented a two-cent
per pack cigarette tax to pay for the
overhaul of the state's software. 

With demand for competent programmers already booming, "There are not
enough qualified people to help
everyone simultaneously," Scully says. 

The problem is not just confined to old mainframe computers. In a
demonstration for congressional staff, Peters
reset a personal computer's internal clock to just before midnight on Dec.
31, 1999. At the stroke of midnight,
the PC's clock jumped back 20 years and declared it was 1980. 

She said the PC's internal code was probably written after 1980, and the
programmer likely set 1980 as a start
date for the clock. 

She warned it was a dangerous experiment, because the outcome was
unpredictable and varied from PC to PC,
even resulting in the loss of all files in some cases. 

Despite recent calls from Congress for action, many U.S. agencies are only
in the planning stages of dealing with
the problem, Scully said. 

The most advanced federal agency, and perhaps the one with the biggest
problem, is the Social Security
Administration, which started work in 1989. 

For U.S. federal agencies, the millennium comes a little earlier. Fiscal
year 2000 begins on Oct. 1, 1999.

>>>Sorry for the wasted bandwith<<<<

I *AM* the self proclaimed speaker guru. Before you buy anything let me 
know to see what I can find for you. Here's my $.02

*Consumers beware: Like Oliver said, salespeople are sleazy, good for 
             nothing, would lie to their mom creatures (for the most
             part). Mail order has been known to screw people over 
             time and time again! Almost all speakers are sold at 50 
             pts. (100% markup), so if you don't get at least 25-30%
             off you are getting ripped off! And do not ever buy 
             extended waranties!

Cambridge Soundworks makes excellent speakers. Their biggest selling 
point to me is the fact that they were designed by Henry Kloss
(founder of AR, KLH, and Advent) and they are sold with less margin 
than most other speakers. But would still just rate them slightly
above average.

My personal favorite bookshelfs approx $200 pair 
(I have auditioned 100s of speakers in this price range)

Klipsch - KG1.5 Yes Yes Yes. These are the f**kin bomb! I love these
          speakers sooo much!!! Klipsch is known for designing ultra
          high efficient speakers with excellent bass and REAL wood
          veneer (Most other speakers in this price range are plastic
          laminate) The major benefit of these speakers is that since
          they are very efficient your amp will love you and you'll get
          more overall sound for your dollar. Pseudo-horn tweeter.
         
Paradigm - Titan $199 pr. Good, clean sound, excellent bass for size
           You won't find them at a regular retail store. 

Polk Audio - RT5 - (can't remember exact price) *NICE* top end! I love
             these speakers cuz they work great alone, and they kick
             ass if you add a sub in the future. They also integrate
             with Polk Audio's new Home Theater line. 

PLUR,

CT

Klipsh, like Bose, has gone downhill. This probably is the direct result 
of the demand for speakers being sold to the Good Guys/Circuit city. 
Their mid-level priced stuff has gaping holes about 50-250hz. Yeach.

Good. Also some of the Infinity stuff, although infinity's are 
notoriously power-hungry. Advents are nice also, as long as you have some 
bass-reinforcement.

I'm sorry you feel bitter Jim and I understand partly why.  My
question to you is were you dj ing at other parties causing you to be double 
booked?  Is that why mabye you weren't asked to play?

As an "sf" or just plain raver I think I should have the right to choose 
which party I'd like to attend.  I've enjoyed the F-8 parties I've been to.
I think personal experiences of others whether positive or negative shouldn't 
be cast upon me.  I support the scene and hope that mabye you can let go of 
past negativity and forgive.

Subject: The PROMISE story
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Sorry John,

I said I'd do this after Freedom.  I guess I had to work or something... anyway,
here goes the (lovingly hand data entered) story from the flyers to last week's 
PROMISE.  The story's vibe matched the raves ... warm, beautiful, weird, loving 
and vast (yet somehow familiar).

Andy W

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE PROMISE

The call had gone out and they answered it from far and beyond.  Willingly they 
came, armed with their gift for changing frequencies and old hands at slipping 
undetected into dimensional realities.  But this mission would be dangerous and 
difficult and like none ever encountered.  Yet they came by the thousands and 
agreed to the conditions, for this would be the single greatest infiltration 
ever attempted at any one time.

They were trained and schooled, this hand picked group, for they were to enter a
planet so locked in the frequency of dark energy - so controlled by powerful 
forces, it would be akin to a suicide mission.  But the trouble-shooters, 
confident and challenged, still agreed to go knowing the importance of the 
mission, not only to the holographic universe this planet moved in, but to all 
other universes and galaxies interacting with it.

And so the plan began.  Before entering through the spiraled dimensional energy 
bands and into the planets vibrational field, each member was programmed with 
coded information of a so-called "past" that would be indigenous to the planet. 
The staging was complete even to the activation of amnesia as to who they really
were.  Their programmed "past" would then become "real" and the illusion of who 
they believed themselves to be would take over and stay imprinted until they 
were fully integrated onto the planet's surface.

They would become entrapped in the time bands of that space continuum and then 
begin to `believe they had already experienced years of association with many of
it's inhabitants.  However, there would always be a feeling they were different 
from others.  They would struggle with the pain of loneliness and alienation 
from their original surroundings and be driven by a strange sense of purpose - 
some mission they felt they had to complete where time was of the essence - and 
would drift in and out of their subconciousness like the gossamer thoughts of a 
fading dream.

They would arrive like the landing of paratroopers, and although inserted into 
different geographical areas, they would soon begin to meet with others of their
group as somehow their paths would cross and they would feel again the 
familiarity as friendships and associations began.  They had been assured of the
many reminders and clues that would surround them if they would search for them 
and the computerized information in the crystal instructors if they would learn 
to communicate within the limited vibrational bodies of dense matter they had 
taken on.

But the greatest danger of all, and one they had been forewarned of, would be 
that of becoming caught in the light sapping bands of frequency surrounding and 
infiltrating the planet's atmosphere.  They would feel the emotions of 
hopelessness and fear, despair and sadness, anger and rage, hate and sarcasm, 
power and greed and enveloped in the magnetic particles that carry these 
negative emotions they would wander lost and forgetful of their mission.  This 
was to be the greatest danger of all for the dichotomy was this necessity to 
experience these emotions for without this understanding they would be unable to
help the inhabitants of this dying planet.

The struggle would ever have to be that of "Waking up" and remembering who they 
were - light workers bringing knowledge and freedom to a peoples who were 
trapped.  Each member of this great and magnificent undertaking would be 
assigned a specific task.  A portion of this master plan would be coded into 
their DNA and, like cosmic mercenaries, they would blast their way through the 
dark.  But there would always be the danger of being recognized by those who did
not want to lose control of the planet, and efforts to destroy these light 
carriers would become the planetary directive of the dark forces.  Every 
programmed fear that had been implanted to protect the members as they 
integrated onto the planet would now be used to destroy them.  It would be the 
prophesied Armageddon.  The war between light and dark.

Once the group had landed, the 11:11 dimensional doorway would open.  They would
have approximately 20 earth years to complete their mission and return through 
the vortex.  Yes, they would learn to ride the emotional storm of Earth's 
frequency and feel the pain that held it crippled and it would be a challenge 
beyond anything they had yet encountered, but they would never be alone.  There 
would always be the means to communicate with those who had trained them and who
now stood by with hope and love.  And with envy from the skies they would watch 
by the thousands upon thousands as the unique and majestic drama unfolded on 
this blue-jeweled planet sparkling in a black star studded universe.  No, they 
would not be abandoned.  If they would only remember the promise they each 
carried in their hearts.  The promise given to them in the beginning...

    ... from this journey you shall return.

I just wanted to say that I'm for it for others (if that's what you're
into), but I can't dance naked. I'd look like such a dork dancing naked it
wouldn't be a good idea. I have to wear baggy clothes so the moves I do look
like something. People say that I know what I'm doing, but I really don't,
it must be the pants!

But I would be naked somewhere I wouldn't be dancing. . . 

Besides, where would you have a naked rave where there wouldn't be
spectators, police, and whoever else.

Subject: A Party For Those Who Throwem; Maybe....
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Dear All;

        I've been on SFR for a long time, it's coming up on almost 2 years.
For a long time I've wanted to say thank you; in a Brian DarknEs^2 kinda
way; to all the wonderful promoters; even the greedy ones = >.

        I, for a long time have thought about the possibility of throwing a
party for the people who throw parties, a huge and expensive undertaking,
because hey I'm Brian DarknEs^2 and I like doing thangs with a smigh of
class, style & originality.

        Ya know; something different, with different DJ's that we've never
heard of before; so that no one would have to work. May of these resources I
have access to already having friends all over the bloody planet, and it's
not even the money that stops me most of the time.

        It's the SFR popularity contest that seems to prevail on SFR, that
if your not popular; having views and beliefs that don't fit well with the
rest of the horde; your ideas are often rejected, and if accepted; not
supported. Support being defined as just showing up, sigh = (.

        I've never been a politician, and at 34 am not going to start, so I
guess it will never happen. No responses necessary to this I'm just bitchen
about SFR life out loud, ya know it's happened most of my life, but it still
kinda hurts just the same.

        Anyway, I have a dream, and if your interested in hearing it e-mail me.

        Thank me, I believe in myself.

Later
Brian

Hello,

In the run up to the awesome Burning Man festival we have organised a 
Burning Man benefit rave. It is going to be held on Saturday July 
27th and we (together with the Burning Man organisation) are very 
excited about it. (see SFRaves calendar for further details) (also 
see the events section of the Burning Man web site).

We have produced some great flyers and have just started distributing 
them, does anyone have any suggestions as to the best 
stores/locations that we should have our flyers distributed from?

Is anyone interested in helping distribute flyers and generally get 
the word out about this up coming event - as it will no doubt be an 
awesome experience that no one would want to miss!

Your input would be most appreciated.

Love David

Hello,

Before I start this message, I would like to express that this note
(unaltered and taken from Mystr-E & MARS) is wholly in no way expressing my
opinions what so ever.  I hold all of the sound system families (Cloud
Factory, F-8, Harmony, Pacific, New Moon, Gateway, Liquid Grooves, Friends
and Family, belive me the list goes on and on...) closse and dear to my
heart. I also feel that although I do love Jim (As I love all my raver-kin)
and feel that this is quite a painful time for him, the other side of the
coin should be shown as well...

-Adam

So here it is...

Michael Robbins and Eric Newman ventured off to a sunny daytime rave in
Golden Gate Park.  They arrived at the given location, to find that the
promoters who were throwing the event had lost thier permit and sound system.
 Mike and Eric owned a sound system and a garage at their home in the Sunset
District of S.F., so they offered to move the party there.
>From that point on they started thier own after hours "club" known as "Sunday
Joy".

-6 Months later, South of S.F., 15,000 Sq. Ft. wharehouse.
A rave is underway called NASHAMA, which is being thrown by Mike Robbins
(A.K.A. MARS). This was an old school underground with about 400 happy ravers
and also the event where Eric Newman spun for his first time at a rave
playing techno/trance (under the name Mystr-E).  These days were a success
for another 6months until MARS left for a quest for new music in Germany.

-Early 1995 MARS is distributing German trance music out of his home in SF.
Around the same time MARS is introduced to Jim Cyr through a mutual friend
(Kevin Banks/ Funky Techno Tribe). MARS, MYSTR-E & CYR all got together and
concluded that they wanted to get this german trance sound out in S.F.  They
all joined together and formed Frequency 8 (The name being created from MARS
experiencing a calling from the #8, and Mystr-E set on the idea of using the
word Frequency, which represents a wavelength). The name frequency stood
strong depite CYR's reluctancy towards it.  The events started off small and
grew into a tight family of people devoted to the trance conciousness.  These
events were being thrown for the love trance music, conciousness, and
gathering of people searching for something new.  Lots of hard work and time
were put into these events with very low profits being made.
It was apparent that one of the promoters / DJ CYR, was losing faith in F-8.

-Dec. 95' Full Moon Gathering in the forest.
Jim Cyr expresses his concern with the low profits, hard work, and little
time due to his professional carreer.  With 4 hours notice prior to this
event, CYR calls MARS & MYSTR-E, officialy resigning from Frequency-8 due to
the amount of stress that was being created for him by these events.  Thrown
off by CYR's cancellation, MARS and MYSTR-E driven by faith throw of the
event on thier own.

-Jan. 95' F-8 the record store has been open on Haight St. for a couple of
months.
MARS turned his home distribution into a retail record store devoted to the
trance scene. Trance music is becoming more popular, and the F-8 parties are
becoming more recognized for thier own sound.

-Frequency-8 1 Year Anneversary Gathering.
MARS and MYSTR-E invite CYR to play (D.J.) out of respect for the previous
hard times. The party was a success.

-Now. July 13th
Frequency-8 is throwing an outdoor trance event exposing a couple of new
trance DJ's to the scene.  CYR has been and always will be a good friend.
Because of his spontanious decision to resign from Frequency-8 and leaving us
completely short-handed, we are reluctant to work with him on a professional
level again.  When CYR contacted us regarding the upcoming event, the
situation he created for himself was explained, and he replied, "We've all
made our mistakes". 
Cyr will always be part of the Frequency-8 family.  We hope this clears up
any misunderstandings that may have been projected in the previous post on
SFRaves about Frequency-8

We apologize to the people who culdn't make it to our last event due to the
early sellout of tickets.  For people interested, there are still a small
amount of tickets available for our july 13th event.  For all thoses
anticipating the upcoming f-8 event, we're looking foward to seeing you under
the starry sky,

Keep up the faith,
Stay tuned in,
Sincerely,
                 MARS & MYSTR-E

The facts (or as close to facts as I can come):
______________________________________________
As some of you may have heard (and witnessed) there was a brief, but
semi-voilent, dog "fight" at the Light party this past weekend.  It wasn't
so much as a fight, as one dog attacking another dog and someone stepping
in and getting bitten in the process.

Word is the dog and the person bitten will be alright; they are both
recovering.  The dog had a pretty severe injury to it's left eye, not sure
if it will be blind or not.  It is a nice, cute small dog.  It was attacked
by a huskie, that had all necessary shots, thankfully.

The person who stepped in is an artisit and was bitten on his drawing hand,
with no insurance, but he will be alright.  He put his hands in to stop the
fight, I can't say whether that was wise or not.

It was an unfortunate incident in an otherwise perfect weekend.  It was out
of the control of the staff, happening in the heat of the day when most
people were in the shade, or down in the river.

Personal thoughts:
_________________

I own a kitten.  I would love to bring my kitten to parties, but dogs will
eat her.  That's an unfortunate thing of nature, animals love to chomp
other animals.

However, since i have had this cat I have had my ears open for "dog rough
housing" at outdoor parties.  (Truth be told, I have a "vicious dog
phobia," so I'm atune to it all the time.)  I can't say the report is good.
Almost every Sunset I've been to has had some instance of a viscious
(sounding) dog making aggressive moves on another dog.  People look
troubled, scared, and anxious when this happens.  Owners scramble and
pretend that they are in control.  They are not.

I agree with dog leash laws!  That is, I think dogs should be kept on some
sort of leash when in the presence of other animals.  I imagine it would be
much less painful to grab a leather strap than a snapping jaw, wouldn't it?

I don't have a dog, and would probably feel different about it if did.
Unless, of course, my sweet, cute, friendly puppy got chomped by a huskie.

I know this is futile, but please respect the fact there are some people
out there that aren't entirely comfortable with *all* dogs roaming the
grounds.  Now maybe we should have dog personality check points at the gate?

See ya!

Tony

To listen to simply some of what can only be described as some of the

the latest by Sandoz cd from the main man himself Richard.H.Kirk.  If you

Hey Jim,

BOHICA - Bend Over Here It Comes Again!

Sorry about your loss. I could carry on the story from the inception of the
store, but Mike and I are having some "differences", so I'll refrain from
expressing my feelings until everything is resolved.

As JSLee mentioned to Ethan a while ago, there are lots of people who get
taken advantage of in our community. Perhaps the key, however hard it might
be, is to not let others ruin your spirit for supporting the community you
love?

Fair enough, Carol, but sometimes pain is a hard thing to let go of. It'd be
nice to forgive the person you've trusted, once you've felt they've taken
advantage of you, but emotions tend to muck things up a bit. 

catch ya'll later...

 I heard there was a Beautiful People party but was surprised to not see
it on the calander....

If there is indeed a BP there are at least 3 real winners (IMHO);

  CHI - Deaks promises this will be hard techno/trance indoors (SF area)
        BSP I'm doing visuals and lots of the Cloud Factory DJ's spin
        in addition to Jon Williams and Clair +
  
  F-8 - Another party for the hard techno/trance lovers but outdoors north
        of the city.... presale tickets F-8

  BP - if this is indeed happening (Greg?) should also be good energy but
       music is most likely to be a bit more mellow but still high nrg...
       location ?

 So there are 3 of the choices that I personally wish I could attend.... none
of these will be massives so it's fine if we all split up according to our
musical/location preferences... I'm betting that they will all end up as
great events..... support your local underground.....

David Letterman says these are the signs you have seen"Independence Day too
many times:

      ..... Whenever a cloud passes in front of the sun, you scream, "we're
all gonna die!"

      ..... You refer to any car larger than a Miata as "The Mother Ship."

         ...You always keep one hand on your popcorn so it won't get abducted.

         ...During a job interview you take off your shirt and say, "See?No
tentacles."

        ... You've built one of those alien Death Rays to heat up your pancakes.

        ... Your new pickup line: "Prepare to be Probed."


                                    Got anymore?......SpinSilver

Dear All;

        A little while ago I called the Burning Man Hotline, and volunteered
my technical  and health care services, I got a call back today saying that
their interested.

        Oh my, the pale white club kid in the desert. My heritage being one
of Irish & Northern Italian decent, I'm the type of person whos doctor tells
him the minute they see me, "Brian your not going to go out in the sun are you."

        My weird, weird life that an old Native American friend told me too
embrace, and see where it takes you. No one ever told me that it was going
to take me to Hell, oh my. 

        Well, we still need to talk more, but I'm pretty much sold, so see
ya in the desert people; look for a brown, dried up human being; with the
title of Black Rock Ranger, no doubt resembling an Alien at that point. Hey
anyone have one of those bio-mechanical suits.

Peace
Brian

Hello everyone,

    Appearently there is some confusion regarding this Saturday's BP 
party. So let's clear it up!

    Yes, there is a Beautiful People party on Saturday July 13

    It will be in San Francisco, starting around 9pm and going til 6am

  Djs: Trent - Galen - Jon Bishop - Dutch - Minor Minor (replacing me)

    This is NOT a presold ticket party, however, we might do a map 
point so you need to call the voice mail numbers (408)486-9591 and 
(408)450-3044 to get information.

    I hope that clears everything up!

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Greg :)

Yeah!  Glad to hear your going:)  That would be very cool, but wouldn't you 
think you just might die of heat exhaustion in one of those things?  I think 
you should where one at the BM ceremony!

Although "transportationally impaired", I intend to make it to this one too,
watch out for the guy with the huge Uncle Sam hat (if not covered by the
speaker
box), that'll be me (unless I run into serious problems getting to the map
point and from there to the actual party). Hope to meet some of you folks
there.

that night (not the F-8 one).

I really would love to go to BP this Sat...my wishes are with those attending 
and the folks putting on the party! I'll be doing F-8. Most likely I'll be 
wearing my big black coat and bell bottom jeans since its outdoors under the 
stars**  

Looking forward to hearing the BP updates next week!  Take care everyone:)

Here is the solution to the religion problem that has been plaguing the
list as of late...

If there is a God then you will find me at Beautiful People tomorrow ;-)
Im working on it.

You wont recognize the face but, as I said earlier, any fans of Sailor
Moon will recognize the neon pink backpack.  Say HI and I will regail
you of stories from my 'hayday in Pittsburgh, PA'.

- David

and fans of leashes will recognize the handcuffs ;-)

  I saw this movie when it was out in the theaters...
  I really enjoyed...it's one of my favorite movies.
  It's one of those movies that makes you once again look @ the human race 
  as a whole and realize the things we do to those who are not like us...

Absolutely!  We had one rave-hung-over person and one work-hung-over person
watch it, and we both concurred that it was an AWESOME movie...
{Oh hi, y'all, my name is Shamini...new to this group :)
I like the energy here :o)}
It's funny that someone mentioned this movie, because I always kind of
associated it with ravers...I guess the 'evolution' part of it is why...
have fun this weekend :-)

Well a lot of people have asked and it was posted to sfraves. Guess
you guys need to read more cloeasly. Anyway there is a Trance rave
at 150 Folson starting at 11pm. Caban & Craig will be spinning all night.

Also, Riffat Ali Kahn of the famous Ali Kahn's will be performing after
the drum circle wich starts at 10:00 pm so she should be
on at 11:00 pm with Markus playing live underneath her Sufi Singing. after
that it will be full on psychedelic trance till the late morning.

I strongly recomend that people get there as close to 10:00 as possible to
take part in the whole ritual. also these parties tend to get filled up
pretty quickly.

See you there!

Enter a World where horror and hilarity are strangely intermingled -
and visions float in the darkness like fragments of a dream...

Descend with us through the outdoor GARDEN of unEARTHLY DELIGHTS
where Pyrotechnic Robots, Fire-Spitting Dancers, Mechanical Monsters
and The Waving Jesus frolic as you dodge the Minotaur eager to take
you to Satan's Throne!

The VESTIBULE of HELL distracts you with eye-popping artwork
and ~whoops~ you're in PURGATORY, where Sales Reps from HELCO* 
guide you up the towering Throne of Satan.  After the Soul Sucking
Machine, a Satanic Apache Priest and the Piggish and Wolfish Pope,
a live-mix video-projection maze brings you to yet another realm...

The GREAT HALL, where swarms of human-sized insects emerge from the
darkness, passing ominous eggs to luminous Angels on the bridge overhead.
Eerie Butoh Dancers slip through the pillars of MUDHENGE, the first
of many processions this evening.  Above, The BURNING MAN himself,
illuminated in neon, is flying from the rafters.

*HELCO, a supra-national conglomerate, has recently acquired
 Hell as the result of a hostile takeover, with Satan as paid
 spokesman.

Yeah, I saw this flick.

took me about a week to get through it, other things to do.

I must say, the only message I got from the movie is:
It does not pay to look like Michael Jackson.

The other message I got was:
Young male albino's raised in cellars who have particularly high IQ's 
should stay away from electricity.

One other thing (the last) was:
When will Jeff Goldblum stop playing quirky scientific types?
(Actually he is a great actor and I love the roles he chooses to play.  
Always fun & interesting, even the one in this tearjerk movie called 
Powder.  )



Peace & have a good weekend...I know I will!,
John

You know, the instrument made of a flat, marimba-like playing board, except
that the keys are metal instead of wood. And you play it with mallets.

So it looks like I'll be at Beautiful People. I was considering F-8, but my
friends are super set on Harmony parties and I like their vibe as well. My
only misgiving: John Bishop. I lived in SD for 4 years and heard him 1 too
many times..However, it should be a really close and intimate affair:)

For anyone who's going, I'll be wearing a red Realtime t-shirt with a happy
alien on it...I finally stole it back from my brother...

Dearest Raver Love Bunnies,

I was going to say something seminal, but I forgot.

The Titan IV carbine was my baby one summer, that 
ol lox-rp1 coking problem.  My first ever DOE security
clearance, even.  Oh the injector test memories.  All
those engineers scrambling to bring me the instrument readouts
after she blew in the second second.  

And then wearing those goofy hardhats as we climbed around
the 3 story firing stand out behind the bunker 
in the granite quarry.

Come with me Boys!  

Those were the days.  I'm tempted to tell y'all about the
top secret space plane ... sorta surprising that didn't make 
it into the alien flick ... but honestly, I'm too scared.

After that czech born berkeley student increased the
US a-bomb tonnage by 20% with a single hydro calc, I burned
out.  Yup the pressure got to me.  Pride is a devil.

Oh yeah, now I remember -

Thee-O sent me a few of his tapes and I just love 'em... would be thrilled

Do you ever get that electric tingle under your skin?  You know what I 
mean; the anticipation of a great party.   AAAHHHH....I revel in it!!

My crazy self will be in attendance at the aforementioned soiree...

I will be dawning my emerald slippers, well, actually they are my 
favorite silver tennis shoes.  So, if you see those, I will be the 5'4" 
female type being attached to them.

I'll be shaking my booty in some kind of outlandish type clothing, well, 
maybe just normal to you guys, but quite outlandish to those who don't 
rave!!  Ahh the slack I get for having fun.....

Anyways, my spirits are very high.  I hope to meet a bunch of you.  The 
last BP in May was where I met my first large group of sfravers, and I'm 
hoping to add more faces and personalities.  I just love human nature 
(most times, that is!!:)

don't be shy, either...   been there, done that, doesn't work :)

lots of love and happiness in the many paths you might take this weekend,

KaySEE

p.s. my real name is NOT kaysee nor casey nor any derivation, it is 
Kirsten.  my tag is a play on my *initials*.  <--that's just to clear up 
some confusion which always seems to happen when I meet sfravers!

To those going to Beautiful People: I'll be there, with my hair in the
trademark ponytail held together by colorful hairbands all up and down it.
I also have a silly, scraggly little goatee (need advice on how to bleach
it!).  I hope you'll say hi.  I'll have candy, smiles, and hugs to share,
and water, if they let us bring it in ;)

Love to all,

OK, before I said I was going to Chi, but after seeing how many of you 
were going to BP, I've changed my mind. So here is my situation, I'm 
going up north for the day (Bodega Bay) and then I'm visiting a friend 
until seven in San Leandro.  But between 7 and 9 (when the doors to BP 
open I think) I have nothing to do so I was thinking that this would be a 
good time to meet some fellow sf Ravers.  I don't know the city that well 
(I'm from Santa Cruz), but if people want to meet somewhere before hand, 
that would be great.  THe location would have to be somewhere that I 
could use a map to find.  I really hate going to a rave and not knowing 
any body, and talking to people is usually hard because of the music, 
that is why I like meeting people before hand.  If any one wants to 
respond, you got to before 10 PM tonight, cuz that's the last time I'm 
checking my amil before the party.  Also if someone does want to meet up, 
I'll be riding my motorcycle, so I'll be where a black leather jacket, 
black leather chaps, a blue backpack, a black helmet and I also have long 
hair.  Believe me, I'm easy to find.  See ya all later. PLUR x 10

P.S. I'll bring the SFRaves stickers I made, and to the people that I said 
that I would send then to, sorry I slacked, but I'll send them out real 
soon, really I will :)

Got my California car registration form in the mail, and I guess I forgot
to pay a parking ticket I received on December 10, 1995 . . . somewhere on
the streets of SF outside the Acme on a Sunday morning after Chrysalis
introduced me to this world . . .

The $52 it will now cost me was well worth it . . . :)

Wish I could be there with you beautiful souls!  But alas, I am still in the
Pacific Northwest working on a few projects.  As I have told a few, I won't
be back 'till September and then not perm for a while.  But I am looking
forward to the end of September.  The 29th is my B-Day!  I'll be in The City
the 26th thru 31th.  Hope something major will be happening, I'm sure it
will...but back to my reason for posting.  There would not be any type of BP
party without actual, real Beautiful People.  And this means you!  One of
the most spectacular site a pair of human eyes can behold is a group of
loving, devoted, caring and determined individuals whom are sharing in that
'little' thing called Love!  Here's to you fantastic fam to shine onward and
outward at BP and bring the light just a little closer to home.  Remember,
as I know you will, the vibe at BP is caused by what's inside, not out!       
Love,

Troy

PS.  Don't forget to send the DJ's your 'inner' light while your there!!!

It's a tough decision but I have to side with F8. For one reason or another
I have missed every F8 party I've tried to go to. I will not miss this one.
I think any party this weekend will have tremendous vibe and energy.
Personally I  have been waiting for this F8 party for a long time so I will
go crazy on Saturday night.  Hope to see a lot of good people there and meet
a lot of SFRavers.

Keep on Groovin'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi all!

 Well I hardly ever make it to SF so this Saturday will be a real treat 
for me. I'm going to BP as some very special friends of mine are throwing 
it and have asked me to come. I'll be wearing my BP, SFraves and my 
Harmony laminates ( can you spell snob, ;) ) and I love meeting people 
(despite being a little shy and having troubles remembering descriptions 
and names on the list). 
 Anyone who says hi to me will win a phat smile. :)

Have an ecstatic weekend everyone!!!

I'm not sure if I have ever properly introduced myself, however I have posted
Gateway events for awhile.  I'm from Sac originally and moved to the Bay Area
1 1/2
years ago. After a few full moon experiences(Thank you David Sarlin!), a
summer of sunsets, and a Gathering, I moved to this area with because it's
wonderful people and
opportunities.  I work with a group of friends which make up Gateway Systems
which create some local  indoor and outdoor events.  Some of you may
recognize me as the crazy girl with glasses handing out funny flyers at
various events.  Some of you may know my brother Mathew as well (we look a
great deal alike).  Hmmm.....  

Well with some rather sharp posting shrouding the Burning Man Project,  I
thought I would share some Burning Man developments.  Recently there was a
meeting with the different rave organizations (including  Ultraviolet,
Wicked, Gateway, Dimention 7 and SPAZ) and Burning Man Organizers for the
planning of the rave camp.  After last years semi-confusion the rave camp
this year is to be organized as a community with lots of space for everyones
camping, sounds (house, ambient, trance, goa, you name it), sound systems,
and styles.  The camping area as now planned is called the Techno Ghetto
which will be 2 miles South East out of the main camp area.  There will be
first aid, bathrooms, and personel with radios in our camp.  The camp will be
set up in a huge circle 400 yards wide with the center reserved for
bathrooms, first aid, and message board (to find out all that's happining).
The sound systems will be set up on the far outer area of the circle 200 yard
minimum apart facing out with the louder systems continuing to go out further
so everyone has their space.  The smaller ambient systems will face twards
the main camp.  Rave camping will be inside the circle behind the systems
outside of the facilities area.  All will be able to camp within the large
circle.  
 I would like to share some thoughts and feelings about Burning Man inside
and outside the rave camp.   Burning Man was introduced to me as an
experiment in temporary community building.  This is something many
soundsystems, and various groups do in special individual ways.  I see
Burning Man as an opportunity for all our individual efforts, communities and
energy to come together in an amazing place with amazing people without
compromising any person or groups style,  but celebrate and explore that
which
makes our community special in one circle of many different sounds and
lights, lasers, and creations.  It is not any one thing, moment, sound, song,
light, car, or person that makes Burning Man so amazing, but the effort and
creativity of all those things in one special place for a time, sharing, and
doing their own thing, but together.  Communication, respect, and creativity
are essential.  

 This event (although I recommed it to anyone)  is not for everyone.  A super
harsh environment where you have to bring everything makes you think and take
responsibility for yourself which some of us do regulary enough.   At the
meeting               for planning the rave camp we all had the opportunity
to meet the 3 main creators of The Burning Man project.  They are quite
amazing men.  They work hard most of the year
planning this event and continue to make it work with the local comunity in
the Black Rock Desert area.  That includes benefiting the local schools
(fundraising selling ice), local authorities, government and buisnesses.  BM
project is not just about raving, although it captures the sense of community
that we as raveheads share.  It is about creating, destroying, adventure,
burning, discovery of self,  community, nature, sanity, insanity, survival,
being a human being and love of life.  The rave community holds all these
values  and we are fortunate there is an large event that can house our
community as well as so many others.   For thousands, the BM Project is not
soley
about rave, but building a community where there is space for everything
there is not space for in every day society. The main camp this year will be
huge.  People from everywhere comming together.  Please remember that we as a
community are sharing and contributing to this gathering and are a part of a
greater community of individuals, not just ravers pounding it out in the
desert, but human beings. 

The Rave Camp area has it's own web page if your interested...
http://www.sirius.com/~shag/burn   
The BM Bulletin Board  <http://www.chorus.com/~eric/bm96/bbs.html>, is a
multi-use multimedia resource for locating rides, collaboratiors, and just
about anything else you can think of. 

For those who are not aware, it is important that all who wish to attend
register.  This event is completely supported by its attendants so there are
no corporate sponsorers etc. 

I took this from the BM '96 guide I recieved at the meeting...
Here is  a part of the Burning Man Description of community:

Burning man is an experiment in temporary community.  Because many people
only know a world shaped by institutions, social service workers and
commercial transactions, they may not even recognize the signs of a
community.  Here are a few indications:

Capacity.
Communities are built on the recognition of the unique abilities of every
member.  Commerce and the public service sector define us on the basis of
deficiency and need.

Collective Effort.
Community is cooperative; uniting us as varied members of one body.  When, by
contrast, we consume a sevice, we're made passive.  50 million people may
view a television program or consume a beverage in complete isolation from
one another.

Informality.
In the community, transactions of value take place without money, advertising
or hype.  Care emerges in place of structured service.

Stories.
In universities, people know through studies.  In businesses and
bureaucracies, people know by reports.  In communities, people know by
stories.

Celebration.
Community activities incorporate celebration, parties, and other social
events.  The line between work and play is blurred and the human nature of
everyday life becomes part of the way of work.  You will know that you are in
a community if you often hear laughter and singing.


This is all my tired brain can put together so late,  no, so early in the
morning.  Sorry this post goes in and out of my opinion and BM info. take or
leave what you like.  If you have any personal questions or comments for me
please send them to my private account.  BM is comming up fast so start
planning now and remember this is an opportunity to create freely in any way,
shape, or form and share it or just enjoy what others create too! Feel it-
Love! 
-Claire!

       So, you people like movies eh. Well, There are a couple movies that
make you have to watch them over and over again. Natural Born Killers is
more than just a movie about the nicest killers in the world, it's kind of a
big puzzle game that has to be put together in your perspective. Watch it
closely, on acid if possible, and pay attention to every little thing that
happens. There are sooo many things that happen in that movie that no one
knows about. I'm still figuring it out and I've watched it in the ???teenth
times. (Hint, look for the demons, and don't watch the characters).
       Also, a ton of people seem to be really into The Clockwork Orange. I
watched this movie a couple times and it's the kind of movie where you have
to see it like 5 or 10 times to understand it. Obviously, the writer of NBK
was influenced by this movie.
       And I kinda have a thing for Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory.
Willy Wonka is just the fu**** most pissed off guy I've ever seen, I wanna
be his friend!

       I haven't found  any others but I'mm looking, so keep an eye out.

Love yall

       Ok, I just watched the movie last night and I feel empty from it.
About the only real part I liked was the sound effects as that big tall
building got totaled by the alien electron beam particle fusion cannon
thing. It was pretty scary. The rest of the movie didn't really belong
there. I mean, why did that lady, her dog, and her kid survive being in a
tunnel as the entire tunnel and the contents of it were completely
destroyed. Why didn't the flames enter the doorway she was in? Why was there
sort of a love scene? Why was there the mad hatter for a research scientist?
Why was the acting sooo crappy? The special effects were too fake looking
(obviously budget problems). The little girl was cut but couldn't act for
shit. The fresh prince thought he was all bad cuz he punched out ONE alien
(somehow), while there were millions all over the place. The whole story
started out telling about all the diffirent countries, but only ended with
one, actually, one city. Whatever city it was? Whaty happenedc to the rest
of the US? How did our slow ass computer technology interface with their
obviously more advanced system? If we humans have 5$ software programs to
keep cpus clean from viruses, why don't aliens have something? I mean, they
are space travelers and all. How do the aliens fly thier ships with those
tentacles? How do they sit in their chairs? Why was the president usually
unprotected? Where was the secret service, the police, whoever? What was
that guys problem, the one with the scratchy voice and the edipus complex.
How did an Air force Jockey know about area 51 while the president had no clue?
       I don't know. I just think they hyped up the movie too much and
should have put more thought into it before they released it. It could have
been waaaaaay better. It was just too much of a joke. You can't have an
action space movie comedy romance sci-fi thriller movie. It just don't work.
       


      Also, I think Alice in Winderland is another Bad-Ass movie. Definately
recommended viewing. But  you have to pay very close attention.


Peace love and everything in between.

Heyya all of ya's!

Ok, for all of you folks going to Beautiful People (or at least those 
of you who don't know me, cuz those of you who do already know what I 
look like!), I finally got my rave-wear down for the evening, so I 
hafta do my usual and post my description:

5'8" tall, shoulder-length brown hair, medium build.  I'll be wearing 
some nifty new stuff I found this week, shirt: shiny spandex shirt with 
a metallic swirly black & silver pattern on it.  pants: my regular 
comfy baggy old jeans.  shoes:  shiny silver tennies with black & gold 
sparkly shoe-laces! :)  And I always have a bunch of shit around my 
neck!  This usually consists of the following:  1 old-skool sfraves 
laminate (I hafta get around to adding the new one), 1 dayglo-orange 
Basics ticket from one of my favoritest parties of all time (remember 
that one wayne?), my FnF patch, and my little plastic people which hang 
on a neon-green shoelace covered in Sylvester-the-Cat heads.  I will 
also most likely have my trademark hot-pink glow-stick hanging around 
my neck too. 

So, all you sfravers I haven't met before, come up & say hi if you see 
me (of course, all you sfravers I *have* met before, don't bother! ;)  
I love meeting new sfravers, and there are a lot of new ones on the 
list I've not yet met.  So come up & say howdy, I won't bite (unless 
you want me to!)

Love,
Shawna

Man, you should read the book by Anthony Burgess. Stanley Kubrick did a
great job with the movie, but the book has about 500 times more impact.
Only problem is that the book is written mostly in this really fucked up
slang that's like a new language. It comes with a glossary, but I had to
read it again right away to get all the stuff that I missed the first time.
Check it out.

hello all-

look for me at beautiful people!!

i'm about 5-10, short brown hair that's died red.  i'm kinda pudgy (my
friends describe me as squishy, so i can go with that)  i'll be wearing
nothing in particular, just my regular clothes.  i'll have a medallion
with a large smiley face around my neck, and a hat with a big "M" on it
(that's for my name!)

i love you all-

matt l

First we'd like to apologize for the massive cross post but if anyone 
wants to exchange information in the future let us know and we can mail 
only those individuals (as to prevent posting to all the lists like this)

We're still compiling information like crazy but the following is a list 
of events that we do not have ticket/admission prices for.  If you know 
any of the following please mail us privately (at ravedata@partnercomm.com). 
Thanks everyone!

Love, 
Nicole and Matt

Hello everyone,

    I have to make this brief, so here it is...

    Tonight's party is NOT a presold ticket party!!! It is on a first 
come first serve basis!! We have confirmed a map point for tonight, and 
everyone who plans to attend BP tonight must get to the map point 
before coming to the party. 

    The map point for tonight is 2779 16th st. (between Folsom + 
Harrison) (in San Francisco) 

    The map point will open at 8:30pm. Ticket price is $15 dollars 
(sorry for the hi price, but we had some unexpected costs pop up) 

    We ask all of you who are attending tonight, to come with an open 
mind, an open heart, and truck loads of positivity!!! Open yourself and 
share your positive energy with all who surround you!!! This is going 
to be beautiful!!!!

   If you need more info call our voice mails (408)486-9591 + 
(408)450-3044  

Peace,

Greg :)

Yaayyy!  Matt's coming! :)  Good to know, Matt!  I'll *finally* get to see 
you at an actual rave once again, it only took us 6 months to do it! :)  

This is shaping up to be one really cool party.

Dear Andy,

Just wanted to say thank you for the positive energy and other such fluxes
at the not so party party last night.  Well, the party actually did happen
around 2:30 a.m.  It ended up the sound system was at the other end of the
pigeon point road.  They got everything setup and played a very good set.
Only about 20 people though so it was very low key and
COLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Have a good time at BP tonight.

P  L   U   R,
Wolf

I am sorry but I forgot your name.  You were at the pigeon poit party last
night that didn't really happen till much later and you were with the girl
from Australia.  Just wanted to say it was nice to meet you and keep the
vibe flowing in Tempe.  If I ever make it down there, I would love to party
Arizona style.  Have a good time at the Unlock the House party tonight.
Dubtribe will spin hard...........  I was the guy with shaved hair and with

ever come back to the Bay Area you have a place to stay, both of
you....................

RE:  how do you build a space plane?

Without revealing national secrets I think it is
safe to say that you need several pods protruding
from the plane, each with a few dozen miniature liquid
fueled ricket engines that can fire for a millisecond.
Hook it up to a computer and run it through its paces.
It's like the loudest machine gun you've ever heard.

I wish hard hats weren't so anti-fashion.  Otherwise,
I'd still be a rocket scientist.

fetch that flashlight lt. MS DOS - have you ever driven 
through an accidentally spilled liquid oxygen cloud?  Very
cool when your honda hits 200,000 rpm and then melts.  Thus 
all the sirens going off before each test.  Close off the roads 
and get _underground_ Now.

I've always been amazed with some feats of engineering.
It's so old school to not have a fucking clue but throw
a few 100g in fuel at the problem and you're bound to
stumble onto something that works.

kiss kiss,
Dave

Oh man, I feel so much vibe right now! It's almost scary. I'm being REAL 
careful about what I wish for right now. I'll be sure to spread some of 
this tangible electricity around tonight.

Raver Kittys Come to ME.

I used to drive a motorcycle around Napa alot.
It was an upgrade from my bad-ass moped.  Any, I
loved riding around Napa - going to the little 
wineries.  All those curvy roads, there would
be literally hundreds of bikers, all kinds,
enjoying the day.

What did the harley guys call the japanese
bikes?  I forget, but it was something marginally
racist yet sorta funny and appropo.

My favorite bikers are the grandparent types
on the green with those sparkles built into the
paint giant touring deals - they would have a 4ft
tall windshield, built in stereo speakers, and
antennaes sticking out of their helmets so they
could keep in cb contact with the rest of the
caravan.

But that's really it, isn't it?  The contact. 
Every biker that passes another biker on the road
gives them the patented "wave".  A raised hand. 
A little "hello brother".

After they passed that damn helmet law, I sold my
bike.  It took me a couple months before I finally
stopped... I confused a lot of bikers trying to
wave at them from my VW.

poor, poor humans....the object of this thing is for each of you to "get it"
on your own...if it was something so simply that one human could just tell
another and that other human would "get it" this whole thing would not have
to take so long..besides, it is more interesting this way...there are
obviously some of you out there that know what I am talking about...& it is
so painfully (I mean that the nicest most sincere way) obvious that there are
many others that "think" that there is something to "get" or that are in the
early stages of "getting it"...I want to tell you to relax!!! Once you "get
it" you will fully understand and once you understand, you wil realize that
it is inevitable that all of you will understand...so please, do not attempt
to explain what you do not understand yet, you explanations may only harm
those that are on the right path..just share each others love, power, energy

I think that cop is snowing people. You just don't find lasers strong 
enough to burn cheeks laying around hill sides (even if it is near the LLL).

Greetings,

I'm currently in San Diego,   have been offerred a job down here,  working
as a WEBMaster for the "Loft",  a really cool collective of Rave DJ's,
artists,  yoga teachers,  computer geeks,  and the works.    Just got done
with my first 2 hours of DJ practice,  spinning Hardcore and Goa trance,
getting familiar with the huge record collection I have access to.

I'll be spending half my time down here and the other half up in the Bay Area.
I'll be planning to return next week to get some of my Video equipment like
the "Bit bopper",  my records,  and other stuff for the move down here.

I'll still be showing up for most of the GOOD parties that take place,  as
well as stimulate the rave scene in the San Diego area.

Crunchman

Ever seen Star Wars?  It's not too heavy on the thriller side, but it's got the
rest, and you can throw in Samurai movie elements (the Force/Jedi Knights) too..
And it works!

This was a reply to one of my questions on how to see the info. that these
people have collected.  Their reply was:

>Right now (and you can check this periodically by fingering 
>ravedata@partnercomm.com) we've got about 2600 DJs with over 5200 
>occurances of them spinning across about 800 events.  We also gather info 
>on production companies (promoters), merchandise, etc.  Our database is 
>growing steadily (we just started on Jan 30, '96).  We print a "Rave 
>Phone book" (actually a listing of promoters grouped by state).

>We gather the information from flyers, 18 or so regional email lists, 
>people like yourself and an ocassional flyer in the mail.

I was just wondering if anyone knows how to see this stuff.  I don't know
how to finger!  Any help will be appreciated!

  WOW.

  As John K. said to me, words can't describe...

  That was a beautiful party with beautiful people and beautiful vibe and
beautiful music.  And it's still going, but I had to leave due to sore
face muscles from smiling so much :)

  You know how sometimes you're smiling, and you look at someone, and
they're smiling, and they notice you and they smile more, and so your
smile grows, and soon you have to look away or else become a puddle of
love-goo?  I didn't see any unhappy or negative people.  Everyone smiled
back at me.  Everyone who got a gift from me understood.  The love was
thick in the air.

  I am so glad I went to this event!  It was the excitement I saw in the
posts here that led me to decide to go (after working all day, yuck!) -
Thanks!  This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime affair.

  It was great to meet people, too.  I don't know who that I met is on
sfraves, except Robert (nice to finally meet you, however briefly!) and
the guy whose name starts with M and who is *really* into hugs - and yes,
this is how my brain works.

  And finally, a massive thank-you to Harmony for an awesome (and I really
mean I was awed!) rave.  Wow!

  Take care everyone!  See you around!

Nice to see some positive coverage of this world event in the local
Sunday paper (Examiner, pg A-9); a great photo of happy 
hands-in-the-air ravers with the following caption:

* * * *
Crowd shakes das booty at 'Love Parade'

A crowd of about 500,000 celebrate in front of the Brandenburg Gate
Saturday during Berlin's eight annual "Love Parade", making the event
one of the largest public gatherings in the city's post-war history.
A caravan of 40 trucks armed with booming sound systems that blasted
techno music led the huge parade through the center of the German capital.
Pollice reported no major trouble during the parade.  "It's about the
music, just a huge party," organizer Matthias Roeingh said. "there are
no political concepts."

Killer location, even though the beach party got cancelled!  The woodsy trail 
and the stream running by up to the forest location was etheral and mystical. 
 I was expecting to see little fairy people peaking out from the bushes:)  
Very cool light visuals and a kindhearted vibe.  Everybody was friendly and 
heavy into DJ Mars's set.  Very phat!  I especially liked the fog that was 
drifting through the trees~|~|~|~

I was thinking of the BP party that was going on simultaneously and new it 
was a success:)  Hope everyone had a wonderful evening and have a GREAT WEEK*

Love to everyone,

Yeah, last night was really fun. The vibe was thick. The beats were pretty
good- a lot harder than I expected, but I danced my ass off anyways.
Hi-fives to all the SFravers I met. I wish I didn't have to drive home at
6, though...

I'll start this off by saying, out of the countless number of raves that 
I've been to in the last four years, not one of the matched the vibe and 
enery of this BP party.  It was simply incredible.  Everyone I met was 
really happy, and always willing to give a good hug.  I wanted to thank 
Greg and the Harmony crew for throwing an great rave.  I also wanted to 
say hi to all of the SFR people that I met last night, like -E, Moonpup, 
Frying Dutchman, Nancy, Kay Cee (sp?), Ran @ Dionysus Dreams, David, 
R.Lunitic, Breadan, the guy how gave me the SFR laminate, and finaly to 
the guy wearing the burger king crown (I believe I rembered that many 
names).  Also a big hug to all of those other SFRavers that I met but 
can't remember.  I love you all.

folks around as well - shawna, marcy, wayne, melanie, burgerking jon (nice 
to see ya out again), the other jon, adam L, tony, and some SFRaver i talked 
about the mayan calendar with. a little too crowded for a while, making 
it hard to get around, as well as hot and sweaty, but overall a good one!
thanks harmony crew! hope all teh other stuff went well too.

energy,
tom

keeping it short, but...
Although there weren't quite as many huggly glowy ravers as I would have
liked, i had a really fun time at the caban/craig/sufi party last night.
Visuals were by Dim se7en , and covered two of the walls of the space, as
well as a hanging ..uh...mesh circle thing. Graphics were a little too 3d
modeled at first, but after w ehile it was just digital color patches,
which were great to dance in.

met aleph there, and dan , jon, catherine (if either of the last three are
on the list, drop me a line).
never really saw the drum circle happen, but the first set (live
instruments, even) was pretty amazing. Could have listened to them for much
much longer. I don't know who was DJing (craig?caban?) DATs, but the music
was good, and way way way many beats. Couldn't keep up after a while.
Oddesst part was I felt like I was the youngest one there. Felt like an
art-set kinda crowd. yeah, i guess, great time, just missed the sparkles :)
of you all.

take care
KcR,,

hello all-

i'm jealous of you all who ended up at beautiful people!  i got stuck at
the last minute down in san jose.  i had fun, but couldn't get up to the city.

i hope you all felt the love i was sending!!!

anyway, i'm working late in the computer lab, wondering exactly why the
hell i'm working on a website at 10pm on a sunday night.  then, i realize,
i'm a geek, and it all makes sense.

so, if anyone wants to drop me an e-mail or a ring (my cell phone is on)
feel free

Yes the music at this ritual was amazing. If you like hard GOA trance this
was the place to be. My body could not take it after to long and I had to
leave early. I was lucky enough to get there early and see the drum circle
(what was not really a circle), and some amazing live music by Sufi. The
visual were great, specially the see through ciclinder hanging from the
ceiling on which projections looked 3-D. And all that without any chemical
enhancements. 

Hat's of to Adam for a great night. BTW, did anyone tape this? I would
love to get a copy of it.

Meet fellow sfravers Adam, and kc. Adam the name of your friend was
catherine, right? Please tell her hi from me, she is a lot of fun.

Chi was fun.  Located on the Stevenson alley, just south of market street,
in a medium-sized loft/warehouse location.  Upstairs Clair helped make a nice
chill area with carpeted floors, a shrine, and lots of candles and incense.
There were also flowers that seemed to be growing out of all the walls.
The ground level main room had plenty of sound, 2 video projections and
some other decorations that were cool.  You could hear the sound outside
in the alley pretty clearly, but I guess the spot was deep enough in the
city that no one really cared.  The music was on the faster, techno side.
It was spun well and by about 1am people were climbing the walls with energy.
They had big fans and open windows that kept the temp. very comfortable all
night.  Downstairs was another chill room with another soundsystem playing
ambient, slow funky stuff, and the Muppet Show Theme song.  There were lots
of pads and carpets downstairs too.  All and all the place was really
comfortable and clean.  We met lots of cool people there and the vibe
was pretty ripe all night.  Speaking of ripe, there was plenty of free
grapes, bananas and other fresssshhhhh froot all night.  The space never
got too crowded, which was nice.  The whole affair was pretty intimate and
fun.  It was interesting to see the Cloud Factory people (from Santa Cruz),
some Gateway people (from ebay) all partying it up in the heart of San
Francisco.

It was really nice having Sunset at a non-frequently used location.  Although
it seemed a little rough at first, once we threw our mats down and got
into the vibe we had a great time.  The weather held nicely and the clouds
never came over us (the power of positive energy) and the sunset across
the water was wonderful.  Good vibe while Doc Martin spun some groovy house.
Cops came, a helicopter circled, but I guess they figured breaking up this
party would be more trouble than it was worth... so they let it continue....
again, the power of postive energy :)

 I don't know why this wasn't posted on sfraves, but Mark Farina, 
Dubtribe, Thomas + many others put on a free show at the Bush street fair 
on Sunday, this being one of the rare cases where the French do have 
their shit together...or at least have far better taste than anyone who's 
been calling the shots at the Haight St.fair for the past 2 years.

 I had been planning on keeping a low profile this weekend but ended up 
hanging out w/ Sun & Mike Ross for most of the day. Street fairs are 
unique in that I party with people I normally wouldn't associate all that 
much with. I think that hanging out at raves, be it all ages or 21+, 
affects how I percieve myself & how much of an adult I choose to be in 
either making new interpersonal relationships or holding onto old ones. A 
part of me acts like "so long as God keeps giving me zits I'm staying 16" 
and the other part knows that one day I'm gonna be a 30 year old white 
guy with a bad haircut.

Stompy Stomp parties usually bring out a real colorful, real hip crowd. 
Almost none of which showed up on sunday, but the music was fun, old 
Chinease Moms smiled at me, dubtribe thumped, and people I didn't even 
know were buying me drinks. I'm glad I live in San Francisco.

Good morning all,

Well I hope everyone had a fun, exciting, and vibe filled weekend as I had.  

It comes to no suprise that BP was a smashing success.  Great Job Harmony...

I would esp. like to show gratitude to F-8 for putting thier faith in myself
to close up a very trancy event, and to all those that went to F-8 and showed
thier support. 

Yea, I threw a few balls (i.e. mixes) into left field, but all rookies hit
fouls once in a while...
For those, I do apologise.

And to those who missed my debut, well there's all ways next time....



"Finding yourself will bring you closer to the whole"


-Adam ( AKA   Anakin)

Will anyone be selling tickets at the BBQ & Beats this Saturday?   If so, 
I'm bringing extra $$. :)

What a rave to go to to get out of my burnout!  I think I am ready to come 
out of the woodwork now and I am *SO* looking forward to this one. For 
anyone who hasn't been to an F&F yet: You really REALLY **REALLY** should 
go. It's gonna be a loooong two weeks. Thank goodness for BBQ & BEats 
to break up the wait. 

Are the dj's decided yet?  

love,
Amy

Here is some interesting news about the southern-california desert rave

a few bucks and at the same time killed the whole desert rave scene.

I'm so glad everyone had a great weekend.  I beamed lots of positivity and
energy towards the city from out in the mountains. ;)  I would have liked to
been at all of the parties this weekend.  I was planning on going to Mantra,
but after backpacking 13 miles, I don't think I could've danced much. ;p

I'm looking forward to next weekend already!  I plan on going to whatever
sounds good on Fri and Sat, then hitting Sunset and Mantra on Sun.. 

BTW:  Does anyone have any good recomendations on where to get videos that
could be used for visuals.. (besides like The Minds Eye)  Also.. anyone have
any info on cheap projectors?

PlUrrr,
Aaron.

Well, I fucked up!

You see, in trying to produce nice colorful fliers for the second BBQ and
Beats picnic/rave, I didn't have time to complete them, and so I didn't get
any fliers out.

Yea!

To all who went to Beautiful People: THANK YOU!!!  To those who decorated:
it was a delicious feast for the eyes :)  To those who smiled, shook my
hand, joined me in single or group hugs, gave me gifts (flowers, stickers,
food, water, and love): you warmed my heart and made it a wonderful time.
To those who made music: every second I heard great danceable stuff, and
thoroughly enjoyed it.
It was, in every way, beautiful.  A perfect family reunion after a bit of
self-imposed hibernation.

Still blissful, and still loving you all,

Speaking of movies.....

I really want to see "Trainspotting" when it comes out in 1-2 weeks 
(can't remember).  It's about Scottish heroin addicts.  I read that the 
reason for the name of the movie is that Trainspotters do something that 
gives them structure to their life, but that it is ultimately quite 
worthless in a larger sense.  This is the analogy that they draw with 
heroin addicts.

Anyway, another reason I want to see it is the soundtrack which has great 
British artists on it including Leftfield and Underworld.

Well, what can I add to this? BP was a magical experience, great vibe,
location,
beautiful people (beauty is on the inside!) and I finally got to meet some
of you (U know who U are!). It is reassuring to find out that I haven't been
mailing to some Turing machine, impersonating a bunch of SFRavers! ;-)
You people are the best, and it still fills me with awe that events like
this are happening all over the world and we (I) can blend into the scene
on either side of the ocean so smoothly. And thanks to the Harmony people,
(thanks for the personal assistance Greg) for putting so much effort into
this event, it really showed. This was a party as they are supposed to be,
everybody doing their thing and getting along fine. Too bad I sweated of
my SFRaves-sticker, the "clearance"-ones are still on my shirt though.
And Eric, thanks for stepping up to me and introducing me to some of the
SFRaves regulars, hope to see you all again out there in the near future...

The Fried Dutchman

I'm reading the book now, one of the most entertaining things I've picked
up in awhile.  It takes some effort to get past the scottish dialect, but
you get the hang of it after the first 10 or so pages.  The movie should
be great...

I saw "shallow grave" last week (on video), it was done by the same person
that dirrected "Trainspotting", it's kind of gruesome but it also has a
good soundtrack (by Leftfield). Recommended.

Also, I'll more then likely keep the BBQ hot until 8pm, it still gives
plenty of time to pack it up. If anyone wants a flyer in jpeg form I can
email you out one, just let me know.

Hope to see you all out there.

I thought this list was about Bay Area raves.  Not movie reviews,
computer problems and dog fights. I am not intending to insult anyone
but maybe another list should be started for non-rave related
discussion.  Not everyone has the time to read 50 posts a day.

I think this will be for LA audiences only.  If we are lucky, though, some
nice socal-raver with some free time will put it
on Hyperreal in the same jpeg/text format as the other Fox report.

To all the shiny happy people,

Thank you for coming to the party on Saturday, I had loads of fun playing
and sharing energy with all of you, It was nice too see our friends from
Tokyo Tekno and Israel there. Mantra was also great last night. Hopefully
soon we will be able to ignite San Francisco back into its Psychedelic splendor.
On another note for Burning Man we are proud to announce that Blue room, TIP, 
Harthouse recording artist Kox Box (from Denmark) will be playing live
amazing Psychedelic trance), as well as several other Djs. Look foward to
several Burning Man Fundraiser parties in the near future. 

Till next time love and light.

DJ Caban

Sfraves is about the rave COMMUNITY, not just the raves.  If it's got NRR 
in the title, skip it.  I personally think that all the non-rave posts 
are great cos it gives you a wonderful feeling of WHO is on the list 
instead of just a bunch of critiques of parties.  I value the NRR posts 
and hope they never cease!

Subject: review: Oregon Country Faire
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

This year's Oregon Country Faire was, as always, a magical event.  Those
OCF folfs know how to throw a party!  Arriving at the faire you're greeted
by smiling faces wishing you a happy faire and thanking you for coming.
Once inside, you enter a dreamworld that only those who've been to the
Faire can truly understand.  Everywhere I found myself surrounded with
beautiful, smiling, playful people.  There is something special about that
faire...

For those who haven't been, the faire is set in the woods west of Eugene,
on what is wetland during the non-summer months.  Large, wide trails loop
through the woods, with streams and rivers guiding the pathways.  The large
loops are lined with wooden booths, many of which have an upper level which
give the booth-holders a place to rest and watch the fairegoers pass by.
The booths are filled with beautiful handcafted artifacts and delcious
home-cooked, mostly organic food.  The whole place looks like the land of
the ewoks!  There are small clearings with stages, little nooks for chillin
with your favorite chellum, and of course the main stage, which is the
biggest open space at the faire, which is filled all day long with dancing
freaks like myself.  Thankfully the OCF has sprayers set up overhead at the
main stage which saved me from dehydration.  I danced like a muthafukka!

After the faire (in the evenings) there is camping at various sites (either
on-site, across the road, or within a couple miles), and drum-circles rage
all night, filling the air with a delightfully tribal feel as you make your
way from drum circle to drum circle.  Goodies abound and everyone is in
kindred spirits.  I always leave the faire with the feeling that human life
should be lived this way...there is a richness, a sense of community, a
sense of excitement in the air as if all of the region's tribes have
gathered for an annual summer gathering and you get to see many people who
you never see at any other time, but with whom you feel nonetheless a deep
kinship.

I heard the tempurature was aound 100, and I believe it, but as always
there was plenty of free water all around for drinking and spraying and
splashing, so the summer heat was enjoyable.  And it gave us all the more
reason to strip off most of our clothes and dance a thankful dance to the
divinities that make such a happening possible.

For anyone who's interested, the OCF website has some photos which might
add some color to my words:

plur,

Thanks to everyone that came out.  It was definitely a great event!

Brief review:
	Sorry to anyone who showed up before 10 and had to wait while the 
sound was fixed.  That was when I was supposed to be spinning so if you 
were there early I was the one who played three songs to open!  The 
shortest set of my dj career, maybe one of the best ;)  Upstairs Blue 
opened with a nice set to get people grooving and then came the 
inTIMadator (aka Tim McKnew) who was punishing in the least with some 
great trancey tunes and got everyone pumped up for Deaks, who literally 
devastated the crowd, amazing set which left us sore but asking for more =)
Unfortunately I think everyone was to tired for Jon Williams and Cloud 
(aka Sabin) but they still played great sets!
	Downstairs Moshca opened, followed by James, then a brief ambient 
debut by MC^2, Maya played for a little while Tim and I were at Safeway 
buying them out of water. (we bought 20 gallons at the start of the night 
which ran out, so we bought 20 more, which pretty much depleted 
Safeway!), I got back and played some tunes, my roommate from Oregon, Jon 
got the whole ambient room grooving with some crazy tunes, he was the one 
who played the Muppet Show and some of the crazy samples.  I had a great 
time playing some slow stuff for about two hours, then Moscha came on 
again, finished out by Maya and Luke.  
	All in all no problems and a great vibe, it sounds like all of SF 
was getting off!  Heard great stuff about everything at Sunset, which was 
nice also!

love drenalin

ps thanks to Claire and Rob, all the cloud factory crew, and anyone else 
who helped, Jamie for donating the sound upstairs!  see ya'll soon!

yeah, but when the list becomes just a straight "I went to a rave last
night and heard a good set by so-and-so" it starts getting pretty dull... I
like the idea of being able to discuss alot of different stuff on the list;
provided it doesn't turn into a bitchy-i'm-right-you're-wrong argument like
some discussions (that people feel strongly about) tend to. Even if it's
just lighthearted chitchat... helps the workday go by when I'm getting lots
of amusing fluff and info in my mailbox all day... I know a LOT of people
on this list use it as a break from work...

yeah, that was really cool... they digitized something like a hundred
frames from the report; gave a really good idea of what was going on... who
did that?

Didn't we just have this discussion?  If you're going to post a Non-Rave 
Related topic, please put (NRR) in the subject.  If you get a message 
that you don't want to read (rave-related or not), just press delete.

But please don't complain.

This topic comes up every three months or so.  The only answer is:

"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.   :)

Hello again,

    I forgot to include all of the upcoming party information in the 
last post. So hear it is!!!

    First, on Saturday July 20th, a very special friend of ours, whom I 
personally love dearly ;) , will be putting together her first party. 

                            -Family Circus-

It will be a FREE DAY PARTY, in the Santa Cruz area. It will start at 
1pm promptly.
                               
    Dj's will be:   Gerlando Piro  -  Supermonk  -  Matt Bailey 
                      John Carol  -  Shilo Maggi  -  Cloud

    Info for this party will be given on (408)457-spam. Call, it will 
be fun!!!               
                        

    
    Second, on Friday August 9th, 100 acre woods proudly present

                                 -HUNNY-
        
    This party will be in San Francisco, 10pm - 6am. This is another 
close a dear friend of ours putting together his first party. It will 
have a Winnie The Pooh theme, which should be... well... interesting! 
It is going to be a great production, and be a lot of fun!!!! 

        Dj's:     Gerlando Piro  -  Dutch  -  Greg 
                  Dj Dan  -  Cloud  -  Jon Williams   

    Info for this party will be posted on (415)263-4885. Call and get 
anyother info that I might have left out!


    
    Third, is the Harmony 3 year anniversary/ finale

    For three years the Harmony crew has been pooling our energy 
together to create some of the most memorable nights in our lives. We 
truley thank everyone who has supported us in the past and those who 
are still suporting us, even those who will support us. This will "most 
likely" be the last Harmony. I can't make any promises, cause there are 
a lot of people with a lot of emotions tied into the party who might 
not let it go. We'll see...

    There is not a whole lot of info for this event yet. But here is a 
general rundown. It's going to be a blast!!!


                          -September 14th-

    Starting @ 12 noon on Saturday, Knucklehead will be bringing down 
his BBQ for a pre-event / lunch / party. This will go until around 9pm 
when the anniversary event begins. (Dj's to be announced) The event 
will go all night, until early evening / late afternoon Sunday. You may 
bring tents, toys, food and water. But make sure you bring enough for 
the entire time you plan on staying, because cars are not allowed on 
the facilities. You will be bused from your car (which will be parked 
in a secured and lighted parking lot), to the event. Buses will run all 
day and night through the entire event, but you should plan on staying 
the entire time. Camping (tents, not motorhomes) is allowed and is 
recommended. This event   ----WILL BE PRESALE TICKETS---   Tickets will 
be a bit expensive(at least to us). Most likely $20, but every single 
dollar is being put into this event and it's going to be spectacular! 
Tickets will be sold at parties and other undeclared locations. There 
is a lot more info to be given, so keep posted.

    Well that's what is in the works for right now! See you soon! 

Peace and harmony,

Greg :)

All,

So where do `newbies' get to learn all these acronyms?  Obviously some
are figured out fairly quickly (such as NRR) but there seem to be many
more in use less frequently--do we have a dictionary of such terms?

Ideally a place for reference as some of us (most notably me) have
a less than adequate memory.

Of course, for world politics it's "If you can't join 'em, beat 'em."
Wait, is this rave-related?

  How about:

So do we make sure events like this happen more than once a lifetime
or do we just increase the number of lifetimes we all get?

Both, although the second may be harder than the first.

Dear All;

        Could someone please tell me whether or not there is some kinda rule
out there that states a hetro man must initiate the conversation when 2
parties are attracted to one another.

        I for one am attracted to most of the womyn I meet and see, and with
regard to most of the womyn I'VE MET; very few are able to start the
conversation, they do other weird things however to get your attention,
except talk.

        Speaking from MY experience, I thought we where working on equality,
which seems to stop at dating & courtship. I know down to the last fiber of
my soul that any womyn can do anything any man can do, some even better. So
why do WE(men) have to do the chasing, it just annoys the hell out of me.

        Equality means to me doing everything a man does to court you, and
maybe more, cause the rest of the crap is just plain obvious to me. I guess
what I'm bitch 'in about, is that most of the womyn I'VE MET, not all womyn
seem to have absolutely no confidence with reagrd to taking the lead when it
comes courtship & dating. Hon, if you don't believe in yourself, why should
I believe, and or chase you.

        Serious, private responses welcome!!!!!!

Peace
Brian

            Well, ya know cats do get 9 lives, so I don't think that
  asking for an extra lifetime could hurt?  ;)

As long as that doesn't entail (no pun intended) taking any away from
the cats, I know the cat that lives with me wouldn't be up for living
only 8 lives just so I could get 2--I don't blame him.

Raving is just not about the music and the parties.  Its about community and
friends.  This community is built by communication among people within the
rave scene.  I think we need more non-rave discussions to better grow as a
sub-culture or what ever anyone would like to call it.  It's not just
parties, it unity, community and love!  No insult or aggression intended in

I went to a small great party this weekend with bunch of my closest 
friends.  The party rocked and everything seemed pretty great.  Some 
people got sick on E and other stuff, but that happens everywhere.

Around 10am I found out that one of my best friends was rushed to the 
emergency room due to the seizure.   She took 3 hits of E, because 1st 
didn't do anything, from the 2nd she came down too fast and 3rd was what 
she needed (at least she thought).  After getting sick few times, looking 
pretty miserable, she had a seizure.  I wasn't there and I am sorry I 
didn't help my friends, because most of them were freaking out (not that 
I wouldn't, but I still feel bad for not being there).  She was 
unconscious for 15-20 min and she woke up in the ambulance not knowing 
what's happening.  

The doctor told her the reason she had a seizure was because her sodium 
level went too low.  Supposedly too much water diluted the sodium in her 
body and caused it to be too low.   
My friend is OK; she was released from the hospital in 4 hours after 
getting some IV.  The doctor said there were 4-5 cases like hers that 
happened the same night.

Maybe I am wrong for sharing this with the entire list, but I just want 
everybody to be careful and think about what they do and how they do it.  
Sometimes all of us get carried away and don't think too much about what 
can happen.  If you are taking stuff, please be careful, don't overdo it 
and make sure you have friends with you  (my friend was lucky she wasn't 
at a big party wondering around by herself).

Hugz,
Branka

P.S.  Great to hear so many of you had a great weekend.  Mine was almost 
great....

Hey!  I think you forgot one that has been causing some trouble
as of late... :-)

Vibe - (i) n. - The feeling that is generated by a party.  Common
sources of the 'vibe' are music, people, and miscellaneous foreign
substances ;-)
USAGE : 'Da vibe at dat party was phat!' : translation : 'at the
rave, the feeling induced by the atmosphere was overall a very
good one'

(ii) n. - a musical instrument (see someones post from last weekend)
USAGE : 'That vibe player is very good' : translation : 'the person
playing that tube-shaped musical instrument is producing a calm,
harmonious sound'.

(iii) n. - something that you would buy at one of those seedy shops on
Market (you know the ones ;-).  Usually 2 AA batteries are sold
separately.
USAGE : 'I killed two packs of batteries in my vibe last nite' :
translation : 'I had a *VERY* good evening' :-)

- David

did I see you at Chi on Saturday?  That party was simply AWESOME!
I think Im going to like the scene around here... :-) :-) :-) :-)

Greetings from the SoCal Massive! 

I'm in town for a few months (I live in L.A.,) so 
I'll be out and about on a weekly basis in your 
lovely city. I'm counting on you people to let me 
know when and where the coolest stuff is going down.

I'll be using this email addy (at work) until I get 
my home setup up and running.

All right, back to your regular programming.

Phil out.

It's NEVER wrong when someone who cares wants people to take care of
themselves, Branka.  That's called love :)  Besides, there's something to
be learned from every experience.  Maybe something with a healthy but not

How about Gatorade?  It's for that deep down body thirst (and has
electrolytes/sodium to balance out/replenish you), and it's been
scientifically developed to taste best when you need it the most!

  Often times I will mix up a sports drink in a bottle and bring that
  with me, which seems to work quite well at replacing the lost
  fluids _and_ nutrients lost during a glorious night of intense dancing.

Unlock The House looked like a winner.  Cool secret 
phone number and map point.  Well Done!  I passed out, though,
just before I was going to go there.
How was it?

One of my friends told me all about DJ Spooky, who's coming
to town.  6 turntables for the ultimate sound effects experience.

I also heard good things about funktion - is this a weekly
or semi-regular-ly?  Did anyone go?

All,

Well there are various `heavy-duty' training drinks for before, during
and/or after an intense workout.  They have a variety of amino acids,
sugars, etc... for quick energy and/or muscle replenishing.  I assume
these are just a step above gatorade and the like.  I get 'em at
health/vitamin/supplement stores for about 2 - 3 bucks a piece.  So far
I've only managed to drink them the day after and they do seem to give
immediate relief to very sore muscles.  Ideally, (i.e., if I remeber
and/or can bring a couple into a party) I'd have some before and
during.  There are powder forms of these you could make for cheaper.

Of course, a good smoothie/smart drink bar at the party is always a
big plus (at least for those of us who can afford such).  And speaking
of which a HUGE thanks to whomever that was making drinks at BP--mine
was great and helped, though my aging body still collapsed far too
soon--some things just require a less natural solution.

Not to pick nits, but keep in mind that this is what raving is to *you* 

For some, it is primarily about the music and the parties. Also much of 
the discussion falls *way* outside the stated purpose of this list. I have 
asked a couple of times that sub lists be created because of the amount 
of divergence that has occured. Both times I have been told 'no.' 

The list has evolved(or devolved depending on your P.O.V.) and encompasses much 
more than parties and music. What I really would like to see is an updating of
the stated purpose of the list by the list owner(Hi Brian!) The original 
stated purpose(s) for the most part no longer seems to apply, and for 
someone newer to the list, who just got a copy of the stated purpose of 
the list, this could be very confusing.    

Myself, I stand guilty of being one of the "if you can't beat them, join 
them" crowd. But it would be nice to have some of the possible confusion 
cleared up.

Hi!
 Thanks to the kind soul that fowarded this post and it's response's. I 
just wanted to add to the person who wrote about lasers being 1970's 
technology; Sure, I know lasers are not THAT difficult to design and 
build (after all, I was born the year the laser was invented. It's a 
trivia thing-don't give the answer away!), but it is a bit difficult 
getting power and cooling to a cutting laser, particularly to one in the 
middle of nowhere (sorry Livermore residents).

...introduction.

Howdy- 
	welcome to the KEE-One show.  that's pronounced:
		'kee oh nee' 
if you like- and if you want to sound vaguely asian...

Okay, okay, HI. My name is Laura, and i'm a RAveR.  thanks for your support.
according to "etiquette" i've been lurking for a little while now- but 
now i feel it's time to reveal myself. (oh goodness.... what a show!)
i've written a few of you random messages - and introduced myself privately,
but i'd like to get to know
		LOTS
of sfravers.  previously a "mtn-raver" type (and will be forever in my 
heart..), i'm moving from  Abq. NM  to the bay area in two weeks-

	oh yes,	in the city o' love on July 28th. 
is it just me or does it seem like EVERYONE is moving to sf?
so- maybe i'm jumping on wagon. but....
	
	i decided 2 & 1/2 yrs. ago at a TRIBAL FUNK thanksgiving weekend
	party that i must move to "tha city". yep, that party was awesome-
	changed my life- AMEN! 

i'm quite impressed with this list- there are some very intelligent & 
cool people posting here- i enjoy the NRR stuff too.

hey- anyone is welcome (encouraged!) to write to me with tips, warnings, 
random shit, or whatever... i'd like to hear from some groovy sfraver types.

oh yeah- i'm looking for housing and employment too =).
thanks for viewing!

*keyone!*

Just so folks know; I videotape at some parties and my material IS NOT 
for sale. To Fox or anyone else. I use it for class projects, to teach

parties.

Hi All!

 I had a great time at BP, my first SF party ever (well, except the 
Ravers in Wonderland party, but I worked there-not the same). I have 
never seen so many happy, sharing, genuinly nice people in my life!
Some favorite moments;

       -watching the Harmony banner (the outstretched figure with rings 
	around him) switch from full blown day glo (when the black lights 
	were on) to just a single pulsating ring when the b-lites went 
	off and the strobes came on.

       -THE MUSIC!!! Sometimes the BP and Harmony parties lack (for me) 
	intensity and the music sounded intensly beautiful and 
   	progressive. Especially the stuff Galen and Dutch were spinning.

       -playing "Larry the Lamppost" for the folks on the stairwell.

       -meeting SO many nice people!!!

       -watching Matt da Loaf become a puddle of happy goo ;) 
       
       -twirling my day-glo slinky in front of the black lites.

Some less favorite thangs;

       -The heat on the main dance floor. It was too much for me most of 
	the night. I'm glad I danced hard early on but really wanted to 
	dance later (especially while Dutch was spinning).

       -The power going out twice(?) during Dutch's set. :(

       -The ambient areas not being "fully" stocked with entertainment.



My thanks to the BP crew! This was a great night for me. Thanks to all I 
met; Matt da Loaf, Shawna ( ;) ), Jon/burgerking hat, Frying Dutchman, 
the Frenchman, R.Lunatic(thanks for the stickers!!), Wayne (thanks for 
the computer info), the guy who I talked to about the mayan calender, 
Jen, Greg, Carrie(sp?), Greg's female housemate, John (BP), Joey, Matt, Dan, 
Phillip (from Mantra), the Unity folks I met, Terry, and to a zillion 
other folks whom are slipping from my data bank at the moment.


Peace all, seeya at the next one!!

Realizing that one rarely knows what one takes, you might be interested
in wether those 3 E's were the same type or that the last one was a
different one. I'm just surprised that the first 2 are apparently very
weak, while the 3rd knocked her out. That might influence your choice
of supplier.

It's interesting to note that after all the scary stories about people
dying from dehydration some people are now overdoing the opposite, drinking
too much water (remember the autopsy reports posted here on E-related
deaths in England, one of them was a water overdose). So instead of the
sportdrinks, salt and whatever, one could maybe just stick to reasonable
amounts of water? And the dry mouth is unlikely to go away by drinking
water in my experience, candy/gum/fruit works fine.

I'm happy to hear that. I'm still surprised by the sodium explanation
though, it seems to me that one would have to drink a _lot_ of water
to get to that point. I would think more of some of the other changes
induced in the body by E, like changes in heartbeat, glucose levels
etc. and the cirumstances in the place you are (oxygen, heat).

That is very appropriate on this list. But then again, anybody can be
suprised since nobody really knows what they're taking and what for
instance long term effects might be (keep checking that short-term
memory, folks!)

And for the promotors, make sure that there's somebody around who has some
limited medical knowledge = common practice at the larger raves in Holland
for instance.

Hey! Somebody told my cousin to stick this sticker that said "TRASH" in 
the back of this guy's jacket. He did it and they laughed. so he asks, 
"Who is this guy?" And they reply, "THAT'S PUCK!" 

So I guess Puck walked around the party with a "TRASH" sticker on the 
back of him. HOORAY FOR MY COUSIN!!

Yes Yes Yes....
F8 was a great party.  The music was very good the forest was wonderful and
the crowd was interesting.

Highs:
        -me, went a little crazy 
        -running through the pitch black forest with a small flash light,
         gave a great tunneling effect
        -getting lost agin but this time with some raving Russians
        -some girl doing a great glow stick dancy type swrily thing around my
         head
        -meeting some very open friendly people
        -dancing till the dj stopped
        -watching the morning sun slowly permeate the dense fog and forest
        -walking to the redrock beach the next day to rest
Lows:
        -large amounts of trash being left on the ground!!!!!!Lots of beer
cans          and bottles were all over the place the next morning.  Very
disgusted.
         I thought people would know better by now.
        -umm..................................... can't think of anything else.

F8 can throw a great party but I think with beautiful people happening the
same night, there just wasn't that magical touch from great people at this
party.  I still had a great time though.

Wolf.

Yes, another Beautiful People review!  So much for originality.

Found out about this one just in time - and whoop! there went my weekend 
plans...BP is definitely the kind of party you plan your weekend around...
I'm glad I have at least one raver friend who's as dedicated as I am 
(what's up, crazy K!) to go with at the last minute.

First time at this location.  I liked it!  Main rooms off of the street 
(less noise = less bustable), inside were two levels with multiple rooms, 
creating several chill areas (including a nice open-air area for the 
smokers), and of course, my home, the dancefloor.

As usual, Harmony's beautiful decorations transformed the place into a 
visaul candyland - Raver's Delight.  Rainbows of color washed over all of 
us, psychedelic mushrooms sprouted on the walls and dayglo clouds hung 
from the ceilings.  Superbright Elmos and teddy bears and other inanimate 
friends rode around happily on many ravers all night.  Blankets and 
pillows in the upstairs chill area were too comfortable, people oodled on 
them all night.  The sound and lasers were thick downstairs.  And I got 
pictures of it all!  I finally remembered to bring a camera along to our 
strange nocturnal world, though now I think I'm going to be camera-happy for 
a little while!  (Paul, you inspired me - but where were you?!  YOU would 
have eaten this party up!).

Extra big thank you's to everyone there for the megaPLUR.  This was the 
happiest bunch of people I've gotten to party with in a long time!  
Everywhere I was greeted with smiles and hellos.  I met so many people, 
which was a delightful pleasure for me, a serious speaker hound.  I wish 
I could name them all...

I did meet an older ex-hippie guy who had come to investigate this rave 
thing.  He sat in the chillroom and exclaimed, "people pay hundreds of 
dollars hoping for this in therapy!  This is great!"  I asked him how 
long he'd been at the party.  "Ten minutes!"  He was very curious, asked 
everyone around many questions (including, "what happens when there's 
fights?", "is there any uniformed security?"- very new to the scene!).  
He went down to the dancefloor but wouldn't leave the wall, however, 
because he was afraid to leave his stuff unguarded.  Hee hee!

On the dancefloor Adam the Lunatic was very entertaining.  With a huge 
cartoon checkered hat hiding his entire head, big baggy clothes flopping 
and dazzling glow sticks spinning, this "newbie" has turned into one of 
the crazier rave characters.  You go!  (But no way do I believe that you 
never danced before raving!!)

Fun!  See you all next at FF (or in the line for the tickets Saturday 
morning...)

Love, Nancy

Well, my mom bought this really *NASTY* Nortic salt licorice. The name

So, random drug question. how come ketamine, a somewhat popular back-east rave drug,
and one that is hallucinogenic (feel free to argue about that statement)
, as well as having some serious alien experiences attatched to it,
is such a non-thing out here.

(by alien exp, i mean that _all_ of the people that I know who have used
it intesively  have described visiting different planets,
and many have felt that they have caught glipses of, or 
even come into contact with, alien lifeforms.)


is it a synthetic vs artificial thing?

Not that I really care, i just find it odd.

where did I buy my grammer anyway? Prolly the same Bazaar I bought mt 
spelling from.

take care

This is not the first time he has been to a party, I have seen him and the
guy who plays David on 90210 at the same party about 8 months ago in the
city. I talked to both of them for about 5 minutes and they said they try to
go to underground parties as much as they can. Puck more then the other guy
though. what a small world.

I think the idea of using an animal trank to get high is silly .... also,
from what i've heard, K gets you REALLY screwed up and i just don't like
that sensation.  If i'm going to ingest something, I want it to be FUN,
and this just seems like it'd be a little much.  Sitting around completely
lost having conversations with things that aren't there isn't my scene. 

IMHO

Hi all again!

 As most of you who are reading this know, I do live ambience and 
enviromental/room tech design. I would really like to be able to e-mail 
some of these folks;

	UNITY
     	MANTRA (Phillip)
	GALACTIC FREEDOM DAY
	SPACE CHILDREN

regarding providing ambience.

 I plan to contact the info lines but find these usally ineffective. I've 
talked to a few folks flyering at BP about these events and they invited 
me to contact them.

Thanx in advance!!   =)

Hi!!

Just a quickie-

I noticed that on my adventures in SF, that there was hardly any apparent "come 
down" effects from your e- is this a normal thing, or was I just lucky?

In the UK we have what is known as "sunday dinner syndrome", which is the 
feeling of depression & disgust that you get around sunday lunchtime 
(particuarly if someone sticks a large roast dinner in front of you!)

hugz to all my chicken-pies in the US,

Daryll

     All right people. Hyperreal has a drug archive. You can also find
numerous archives to read upon on any single drug you want (so there's no
reason in not knowing the dangers). 
     E, first off, is like alcohol in a way. Too much makes your body reject
(puke) it. E always makes you semi-DEhydrated. It makes your body use up
it's liquid stores to fuel itself and therefor you need to drink a lot of
water. You can't overhydrate yourself, and if you somehow did, there's
enough electrolytes in ordinary water to keep your bodies leveles balanced
(unless it's distilled). 
     When you sweat, your body uses its liquid to cool your skin. Salt comes
out through your pores with the water. Your body can become deprived of
sodium through sweating, but I'ver never heard of it being diluted. (that's
why you taste salty when you sweat).
     Also, Last year or so, I had a similar experience. Me and my girlfriend
(at the time), went to a rave and wanted some E. We weren't really
experienced much at all with it and bought some aspirin looking things from
some guy. He called them white tylenol, I whink it was. After about two
hours it didn't seem to be working. Me and my girly decided that we'd get
more, but from a diffirent person. I found the guy and got two of something
called Black Licorice. I took one but my girly didn't cuz she was afraid and
wanted to wait to see if it was cool or not. When I tasted it, it kinda made
my tongue tingle (sorta like licking a battery). I didn't know any better
and swallowed anyway. About an hour later I really didn't feel much else
than a kind of wirre that would come over me in waves like every 9 minutes.
Anna asked me if it was cool and I said "I guess" so she took hers. That
wasn't cool. About 45 minutes later, Anna started feeling sick. She went
into the bathroom, threw up, passed out, and I didn't know what to do. Damn
promoters just wanted to get her outside. ( I found out that the sales
manager for one of my racing sponsors was putting on the event). I helped
them outside and layed her down with my jacket as I ran 4-5 blocks down
broadway to get the car.
     Eventually We made it home. On the drive back I was seriously wired out
of my mind, and Anna was barely concious. I had too keep talking to her
(which wasn't a problem) so she wouldn't go to sleep. We ended up going to
my house and sleeping through the next two days. She ended up OK, but I've
learned from my mistakes.

      People, read the literature on the drugs you use. I don't want to see
any of our family get hurt. There are too many assholes out there selling
tore up ass shit to people who don't know any better. 

      Next time you want E, ask what kind it is. If they give you some name
other than Methylenedioxymethlamphetamine (MDMA), don't buy it. Same if they
don't know what it is. MDMA is usually yellow crystally or white powder.
What out for capsules, because you can't tell what's in it, but I trust them
more than anything else.

      Try and get whatever you want through someone you trust.

Love ya guyzzzz. . .

Well, Ketamine is a general anesthetic made by Parke Davis. The good news
is, if you get it in the sealed vial, you know its pure. The bad news is
most of the time its taken intermuscularly..meaning injected.  Although it
can be evaporated down to a powder, but that tends to be expensive. John
Lilly injected Ketamine up to 24 times a day over consecutive months without
(as he claimed) serious damage or difficulty.

For those who have done it, (and I have) they will tell you it is the most
intense psychedelic experiences they have ever had. Once the experience
starts,its  like doing a full summeralt, with a twist down into your
unconscious. But, the experience only lasts for about 20 minutes, and my
friend, the good doctor,
said to me, "go where IT wants to go, do not resist, panic or attempt to control
this." Kinda like the instructions for the old Outer Limits TV
program--"Something else has definately taken temporary control of your
telvision set"--This is not a "fun" drug---or something to do at a
party--although I did this once while lying down (that is recommended since
you lose any sense of your body) on the hillside at a Sunset in the Berkeley
Marina.

It is a titanic, exhilarating experience, and one which stretches the
meaning of reality or consciousness as you have known it.  This is not a
recommendation.  It is a warning not to do this casually or for fun.

About SYNTONIC....

It was great meeting Branka at the Syntonic party.  At first, when I didn't
see it listed on the calender, I was a little disappointed.  I hadn't been
out in about three months, and everyone seemed to be going to the "cool"
parties; BP, Freak-8,Unlock,Chi--But, somewhere across town a great house
party was given--for friends,by friends, by invitation only.  A nice loft,70
smilE faces, four J's playing for the Vibe---(But Biojeff was great--hear
him soon)  It truly was the spirit of ravin'...I got hugz and smiles from
everyone there...danced to the trance..

Bye the Bye...I came up to visit a friend who has been suffering for the
past four months from what is thought to be an over-exposure to E.. he has
shown symptoms usually associated exposure to toxic chemicals;
tingling,dizziness,etc.
This is just to say, that taking e repeatedly, in high concentrations, over
a few years, may lead to physical complications.  The good news is that my
friend has recovered.(almost) but, again....remember--you are not immortal,
nor are you invincible....

Learn how to drive under a lot of pressure, in strange situations, under the
influence, and very fast. 
    San Francisco is the gnarliest place to drive. Half the people never
stop at lights. Always jump the green. Go waaaaaaaaaay fast. And drive like
maniacs. Also be patient. You'll be waiting for days after 5:00 on workdays.

Enjoy.

Ahhhh special K...
I don't know if I'd classify it as a hallucinogen (it's more of a
tranquilizer, being related to PCP), but the effects are slightly
psychedelic at higher doses. I think it's o.k. in moderation, but when a
lot of people are deep in k-holes at a party, it sort of detracts from
the overall dancefloor energy.  It's a chill and kick-it-on-back high,
but in excess it's as if one is dusted. From personal experience Special
K (at certian threshold doses) makes one so dissociated from their own
body that dancing or any coordinated movement is quite difficult. I've
fallen into a deep K-hole with several other hapless souls at an
afterhours or two when the music was sooooo good but we couldn't really
get up and groove until the K metabolized (an hour or so). It can be an
interesting experience if you don't mind being slightly-to-severely
incapacitated for a bit.

Its currently used in hospitals as a trank (IV) in serious cases where
other meds arent working, and was used in vietnam as well.

I would agree that it is as silly (or relevant) as _any_ drug (LSD, E,
Alcohol, ephidrine) taken recreationally. Make your own judgement call on
that.

I guess it doesn't groove too well with a dance scene (it effectively kicks
your brain into a lucid dreaming state for about an hour)

Im just surprised that a subculturethat at times seems so  concerned with
psychadelics seems to have overlooked a rather significant one.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND I am NOT NOT NOT NOT suggesting you use abuse refuse k.
I am just curious why it seems to be such an east coast phenomena.

A few thoughts and warnings.

1. it isnt pcp. it isnt like pcp. Its still used in hospitals as a heavy
form of sedation.
2. don't buy shit off the street
3. its IM, not IV, if you are gonna take the hard route. IV could kill you.
4. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER mix alcohol and k. Unless you really enjoy
being deathly sick.
5. read some of that John Lilly character

There: Just a few words of advice from one of those straight-edged dc kids
who got to see a bunch of other people play their games on both the safe
and unsafe side of the fence.

Hi everybody,

The New Moon Collective is celebrating the new moon's first quarter with
an event to be held someplace in Marin- that's gonna be about an hour drive
away.  We hope to start the music around midnight, possibly earlier,
finishing up at some point after sunrise.  Possibly followed by an ambient
brunch for all at an East Bay location.

The Date:  July 20- that's Saturday!  

What to bring:  food and water, warm clothes, a flashlight, firewood,
cardboard to dance on, something for the altar, and lots of love!

For directions, call:  415-267-3076.

See you Saturday!

the New Moon and friends

It's SUPPOSED to come out this friday at exlusive theaters. My friend know
tha distributer and he's having problems selling it out, so it might be
postponed another week. I'm a total trainspotting freak and have read
everything Irvine Welsh has written (except his newest book exstacy which
JUST came out) and I highly recommend any of his books. I'm getting to the
age (finally) where there are popular writers who are in touch with our
generation. Though none of his books are about raving specifically, all of
them deal with it in some way, and the experiences are usually positively
protrayed. I know Irvine raves HARD in amsterdamn and Scotland (he says he
likes trance the best). Anyone else read any of his work??

i think sfr is a community, and is both a part of, and distinct
from the non-list community.
parety lists are available via the calandar and a number of partylines
not to mention flyers and word of mouth.
Mailing lists _are_ high volume, and _are_ a apain in the ass soetimes.
Thats just their nature. (well, not all of them, but SFR is a 
_vague_ list. raving includes everything from getting the party ready,
to whose going,
to what movie you are going to see afterwards while lsd is still dripping down 
your spinal column, to latest musik, etc...

and on top of all of that, for many of us, it's the people that help make
the parties beautiful, and thats what all these rants are about.

I think that if you really want to skim down your messages, just throw together
a kill filter to include 

NRR:

(yeah, yeah, im sure someone will throw the best party in the world called NNR:
but, whatever..)

I mean, i agree that there are a hell of a lot of 
threads here that make me want to blink this list out of existence, but thats the price for a 
a community voice. Sometimes the noise drowns out the signal.

I agree that many of these discussion need to go private _immediately_.
and i think people should be responsible about that.

A raver is someone with a particular vierw on life who has chosen to 
express his opinions through music and dance.  BUt there are obviously 
people out there who share the same thoughts and feelings as us but are 
not ravers (e.g. film makers etc).  BUt they and there ideas are still 
important and should therefore be discussed by this community along with 
other important topics such as politics, drugs, astronomy and anything 
else that tickes are fancy.

Hello. Speaking of lasers; wish me luck on my
photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery today.  One
reason I'm doing this is that without glasses or
contacts I'll be able to rave in harsh environments
more comfortably.  Hope to break in my first altered
eyeball at the Sunset boat party this sunday, or maybe the BBQ.

SEEYA!
Lee

Folkes, I've been lurking for a long time.

A serious raver who some of you may or might not know is moving. His nick
is Asy and he's loved the S.F. rave seen for a long time and had
additionally introduced me to it a few months ago and I ALWAYS- have the
best times when I go. So as a friend, as he heads to Florida this Friday
for untold wealth, please join me in wishing him good tavels and vibes and
may he meet many, many happy people.

You will be missed.

Hello,

Did I notice a posting that someone was looking for new employees at a Bay 
Area computer/graphic artists company recently or am I mad? A good 
friend of mine who is an awesome computer graphic artist is 
interested but is not on SF Raves, so if you are out there and still 
looking please e-mail me and I will pass the info along to him.

Thank you and don't forget "Lust for Life" the Burning Man benefit 
rave on July 27th.

Love Dave

 Ah, so Lilly's "Vitamin K" WAS Ketamine?  My boyfriend and I have
 arguments about this...he thinks it was another drug.  But according
 what I've heard about the Ketamine experience, I always thought that
 Lilly's "Vitamin K" was this...He used to draw these far-out maps of
 consciousness when supposedly under the influence of K...if any of you
 are interested, this man is fairly brilliant, though he may seem a
 little wacked.  In addition to studying consciousness through means of
 sensory deprivation and/or psychedelics, he has done a LOT of great
 work with dolphins and human communication with them.

	Try DXM, it lasts at least as long as acid, if not longer. In my
case, tripping almost every day for a period of months, I had so much
residue built up into my system that if I did just slightly over my
normal dose I would in effect not come down for almost 24 hours (although I
would regain control of my voluntary muscles within 4 or 5 hours).

> telvision set"--This is not a "fun" drug---or something to do at a

	I agree with that - I am a little surprised that people would do a
dissociative at a party. For me at least it is a very private thing -
something I do when I expect to just be able to chill and listen to
music or watch TV (before it kicks in so hard that outside stimuli become
irrelevant)...

	Cool, another valid point I would support your right to have.

>

	Sorry, but one little "IMHO" at the end isn't a blanket "cure-all".
I am _very_ into dissociatives like K, PCP, and DXM (they are my fave
substances, and even better they are NOT usually tested for on drug test) and
for me I can think of little that is MORE fun then being so under the
influence of something that your whole body is just _gone_ - you can't
feel yourself breathe, you can't feel your heart beat, you can feel yourself
stand up, sit down, feel what you are lying on, _nothing_. And the music
is just swelling inside your head and you begin to feel it, to feel like
you are flying through space in a waking dream. Now I would hardly take such
a dose before a rave, since at a rave I want to be able to move and on the
kinds of doses of K or DXM I take I literally _can't_ move even if I wanted
to, but as long as other people aren't like collapsing on the dance floor
I would never dis their choice of "fun"...

I think if you can afford to go out, and afford 1-2-or 3 hits of 'e', you
better be able to set aside a few $$ to keep yourself healthy. $5 will go a
long way on Gatorade(tm), Powerbars(tm), and fruit. I usually make a point
of stopping at a grocery store (or farmers market on Fri) and picking up
bananas, oranges, etc.. to bring to parties.

Play hard, but take care of your yourself. ounce of prevention, blah blah blah.

love you all

Vince

PS: I usually bring extra fruit, so just ask.

Absolutely you are right - boyfriend wrong....

SOmeone was looking through the PDR and came upon Ketamine ( or Keteject or
similar trade name )... looking at side effects noticed that it caused
"paranoid delusions" - that's the ticket we want some of those... so a
number of people including lots of folks at Esalen ( a poplular Lilly
hangout )... tried it and tried it... It was perfectly legal especially
for an MD - which is why he called it vitamin K so as to not have it come
under direct drug enforcement scrutiny...
of course they all shot it as someone said not IV but IM.... I only heard of
people using it orally recently...

 And out of all that developed an increasing awareness of the solid state
beings and intelligence all around us - preparing to do battle with the
forces of carbon based life... boy are we in trouble ;-) (reference to Lilly
book )

Awesome!  Never had the opportunity to try any of the above but have
had similair experiences after a few days of artificially-induced sleep
deprivation followed by some quality muscle-relaxants/pain-killers
(with THC ever present of course).  Talk about melting into your
couch.

By the way, the sleep-depravation alone brought new-found understanding
of the various `saints' and other reliugious types who claimed to have
seen and spoken to God.  Granted, they tended to blend in starvation and
pain but then again, they didn't have amphetimens at their disposal.

Thanks.  Now I prefer to be mobile too (at least for most of it).  But
my first rave-like expereince was a Wicked which I spent mostly in a
chair travelling the universe on the sound waves using the visuals on
occasion to set my course--the mushrooms and Dilaudid helped I'm sure!
I was hooked immediately though the dancing bug didn't grab me `till
later.

I wouldn't be too sure about PCP (which was quite popular in the States
for a while) and DXM (which is chemically related to morphine and thus
might show up in tests for heroin etc.). And DXM... that stuff left a
a very unpleasant taste in my mouth for 3 days (+ not sleeping for 48
hours while I had to work...). Some interesting effects when lying
down though....

To everybody his/her own indeed. However, I feel such experiences are better
done in the privacy of your own or a friends home. It can be quite
disturbing to people, say at a rave, to see somebody apparently
unconscious lying in a corner of the chill out or injecting themselves
with syringes (have witnessed both at raves).

Collapsing is sort of the end of the line, personally I draw the line at
people being approachable and still able to have some sort of coherent
conversation (at raves). Otherwise, what is the purpose of coming together
if everybody is on there own personal trip?

SCARY!!!  A few days ago I was supremely bitched out by an irate motorist,
who imagined that I cut him off.  He threatened to murder me if he ever saw
me again (yes, he said "I'll murder you!").  He also called me a
"hippie-looking punk."  Should I feel insulted or complimented?  ;)
How are the drivers in Boston?

is there a particular reason that the acme warehouse is *always* packed 
to dangerous proportions? i like the space, but i will not go to another 
party there without some limit on the number of people.

granted there's always risk, but acme has only *one* accessible exit, 
an obstructed and narrow traffic flow, a structure showing serious 
fatigue (e.g. floor jacks), and -last, but not least- at most two toilets. 
it's an accident (in both senses of the word) waiting to happen. during 
the last nye begin again there, my roommate says he saw occasional 
sparks from wiring in the back of the basement (as perspiration and 
other unidentified moisture consistently dripped through the ceiling).

besides, two square feet of space does not make for much dancing 
enjoyment. 

are we *that* hard up for spaces in the city? i do like the place; i just 
don't like the overcrowding. sounds more like someone's hard up for money.

jmar! adios.

Yeah!  My beloved Sara and I watched it several weeks ago, and we were
struck by not having recalled any of the first part, all the way to the
part where she first encounters the March Hare.  The movie is full of
subtle language and mathematical games, as well as lots of drug references
;)
Listen to the Jefferson Airplane song "White Rabbit."

system. When I noticed the settings for Jazz were similar to the settings I
lock in for TECHNO. TECHNO being for the purpose of this discussion, all
styles of the music we listen to TRANCE, HOUSE ...etc. 

        The EQ setting for JAZZ basically resembled a V shaped waveform,
with the highs and lows up, and the mids down. These are the same setting
that I set the EQ for when I listen to TECHNO.

        I know nothing about JAZZ, and really can't, or haven't taken the
time to appreciate the genre or form of  music called JAZZ. I was just
wondering how, and if they are musically similar in structure.

        Also, I feel TRANCE is very similar to Classical Music due to it's
ability to provoke emotional reactions from it's listeners, as well as
produce tremenous imagery. I was also wondering if it was similar in
structure to Classical music?

        Another question about feelings; how does you TECHNO make you feel,
what does it make you see, or what imagery does it produce. Remember these
are feelings, there are no right or wrong answers here.

        It makes me feel harmonious with the planet, light, happy, positive,
powerful to name but a few, so how bout you, just curious and please try and
stick to FEELINGS. = >

Peace
Brian

ps This should satisfy those rave/techno only people.

With No Abatement,

I was at a party talking to an SF librarian
who looked across the room at a growing commotion
and stated dryly, "man, it's just a fucking light saber"

Which brings me to my favorite movie star hottie [1], Parker Posie!! 
I'm sure all ravers have seen Party Girl.  An outstanding film.
Heartwarming.  Best movie Ever Made!  Introduce me you lurking
hollywood fucks ...

Dave

PS - never design your web page on crack.

[1] hottie.  one who makes you hot.  someone you find
attractive.  a baby kiss orgasm.

depends...

when I listen to IDM (banco de gaia, the orb, etc.) i feel like I'm
floating. Drifting through the Galaxy, if you will =) . The imagery I get
is of physical emptiness, but total sensory immersion. Like I'm in the
middle of a giant empty stadium with all the amps on 11. (this one goes to
11, for when you want that extra kick. why not just make 10 the highest?
...uh... this one goes to 11.)

when I listen to GOA TRANCE or HARDTRANCE with a lot of buildups and
letdowns, I feel like I'm flying forward. I'm in a space full of "stuff,"
zooming around, between and through objects of huge proportions and good,
complex surface detail. It's a similar feeling to the one I used to get
when I'd play my Iron Maiden (Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, if you must
know) tapes on loud; which probably explains why I ran into a bunch of the
junior metalheads from HS at Freedom a few weeks ago... they're goaboys
now. =)

when I listen to AMBIENT (FSOL lifeforms a good one) I visualize nature.
Not *normal* nature though... it's changed somehow. There's *nature* stuff
happening, but it's mixed up; juxtaposed in a way that makes it
nonsensical. But nonsensical in a structured way. Like seeing a cow
upside-down in a waterfall with bubbles floating around; it doesn't make
sense but it seems right at the moment.

when I listen to JUNGLE or BREAKBEAT (prodigy's firestarter is *the shit*)
or TRIP HOP I just feel like dancing. I don't have any specific imagery
that goes with it, because I'm so intent on MOTION. I *feel* my physical
surroundings (both real and imagined =), rather than *observe* them.

when I listen to GABBER I feel like hitting things. But not in a really
destructive way; just sorta banging my fist into stuff to get some
aggression out.

when I listen to GERMAN HAPPY GABBER and HAPPY HARDCORE (marusha, memebers
of mayday) I feel like whistling. I visualize fluffy, poofy things bopping
around. Then I like to hit stuff (in a fluffy, poofy kind of way) when the
beat picks up.

when I listen to HOUSE I feel like changing CDs.


and, no, I don't do hallucinogens and I don't plan on starting anytime
soon. I don't get stoned often, I've only e'd once (loved it-- thanks Adam
=), and I only get drunk in social situations, so all this stuff is just
the product of an overactive imagination and years of walking the dog with
a walkman and immersing myself in thought.

No doubt!  The beautiful thing is, in Boston the drivers and
pedestrians all seem to be suicidal taking whatever right-of-way they
canypu let them, yet I saw no accidents the couple weeks I was there.

My apologies before hand--if I'm incoherent the first time come back
later if it seems my conversation will make that big a difference.  I'm
rarely out of my head for too long.

Sometimes I just want the anonymity of a large gathering of people
whether you know any of them or not, whether you talk to any of them or
not, just having a good time.  Sometimes it's just the music or just
the trip.  For those times when you want to hang with some people,
there'll always be enough coherent people I should think, so those that
aren't shouldn't matter.

Personally, I draw the line at not being able to take care of yourself.  I
rarely need to be able to hold a coherent conversation for that.  And often
take better care of myself when I avoid coherent conversations.

     SF drivers are the worst in the world!  I'm convinced people were sent 
     to school to learn how to run red lights, NEVER use a turn signal, 
     stop at all times in the middle of a street without any indication, 
     totally forget that there are other drivers on the road, and  
     horse-blinkers are a must!! Forgive my ranting, but drivers here scare 
     me!

The drivers out here seem downright mellow compared to the ones in Boston.

 I've driven extensively in Boston, New York, and now SF. I think 
that while drivers in Boston and NY are very aggressive, and sometimes 
mean, they are doing it on purpose, and do have a certain degree of 
driving skill. They just choose to drive the way they do. In SF, I think 
many people just don't know what the hell they are doing. I have seen 
more people driving the wrong way up one way streets, making right turns 
from the left lane, and doing similarly stupid things here than I have 
anywhere else, ever. And when it rains, shit. There isn't a rainy day 
that I don't pass at least three wrecks on the way to work. Thank god it 
doesn't snow in SF, or this whole town would come together in one big 
crash right at Market Street.

no doubt!  I am probably awaiting flames with this statement, but I must say
that some CA drivers are the WORST I have ever seen...I'm from South
Carolina and the drivers there are pretty good...(Georgia drivers suck
though ;^) )...and when I lived in NYC driving was stressful, but everyone
was pretty good about it..
Here, it's just insane.  Almost as bad as Bombay! 
And the rain traffic...jeez, you'd think the earth was quaking or something

Hello all.  I just recently moved out here from the east. I'd been living in Cincinnati,
Ohio.  Boring place overall.  Too conservative for me. :)

Anyway, I'm living in San Jose right now and was wondering if any of you know any
cool places to hang out or any cool stores. 

Also don't know that many people out here yet so I'm looking forward to meeting some
of you.  Perhaps at the BBQ&BEATS this weekend.

thanks and :)

Actually, having just moved out here, the traffic and people's driving
doesn't seem that awful for a metrpolitan region of this size. I resided
in New England for a couple of years and Massachussetts drivers are, in
my opinion, some of the worst and scariest drivers in the contiguous
states. Driving in Boston is a nightmare, especially when the streets
are
blanketed in snow and ice.  I also lived in D.C for several years and
that is a city where people just fly through red lights (Hell, I used
to!) Traffic in and around the nation's capitol is just aggro/ whack. I
used to frequently drive home to DC from Fever (DJs  Scott Henry's &
Feelgoods' club project) in Baltimore in the early am hours and it was
really weird to come out after dancing all night and trying to drive in
a semi-relaxed mode (coming down off an E), while dealing with really
anxious and agitated commuter traffic!  All I can say is: if if you see
a car w/ diplomatic plates, watch out because unpredictable manuvers are
de rigeur. Try touring the Beltway around DC and you'll probably
consider SF a cakewalk.

     Mmmmm Brian?
     
     There was this woman @ CHI this weekend that blew my mind.  ( I didn't 
     go to Beautiful People because my modem crapped out on my notebook and 
     I hadn't printed out any info for BP ... Chi was killer though).  I 
     was walking around in a haze and looking for something I'm not sure I 
     ever had, and I ran into some nice people in the upstairs chill room.  
     We were talking, when one of their beautiful group grabbed me by my 
     neck chain thing, and started eating my brand new, rainbow tech 
     graphic really pretty SFR laminate that I made so I could meet some of 
     you.
     
     Eitha way, she was definitely the instigator, and I was epicly turned 
     on (kinda breathless, confused, really emotional/cerebral).  Only 
     bummer was I was so zonked I just sat there marvelling at how gorgeous 
     she was, and wondering if she felt the same, and being pretty sure I 
     felt the same, etc.  We spent undetermined minutes touching and 
     smelling each other  (!mmmmm!EEEEE!), then went our seperate ways (I'm 
     not sure I was making too much sense here).  ONLY AT A RAVE !!!!!!!!!  
     The moral of the story is that some women feel comfortable taking the 
     lead, and some men like it (I was an instant fan!).
     
     Thanks,
     Andy
     
     P.S.       Special Kudos to Maya for her spunky morning set (perky!), 
     the best best put together bowl of fruit ever, Erin - 8P - and her 
     friends, the second vowel experience, and the 100% cool & authentic 
     crowd @ CHI.  Sorry for hogging the speakers... they just sound so 
     good.  Oh, to complete the mental picture I was wearing the trendy 
     annoying rEvo shirt and the green velvet pants...

Dear All;
     
        Could someone please tell me whether or not there is some kinda rule
out there that states a hetro man must initiate the conversation when 2 
parties are attracted to one another.
     
        I for one am attracted to most of the womyn I meet and see, and with
regard to most of the womyn I'VE MET; very few are able to start the 
conversation, they do other weird things however to get your attention, 
except talk.
     
        Speaking from MY experience, I thought we where working on equality,
which seems to stop at dating & courtship. I know down to the last fiber of 
my soul that any womyn can do anything any man can do, some even better. So 
why do WE(men) have to do the chasing, it just annoys the hell out of me.
     
        Equality means to me doing everything a man does to court you, and
maybe more, cause the rest of the crap is just plain obvious to me. I guess 
what I'm bitch 'in about, is that most of the womyn I'VE MET, not all womyn 
seem to have absolutely no confidence with reagrd to taking the lead when it 
comes courtship & dating. Hon, if you don't believe in yourself, why should 
I believe, and or chase you.
     
        Serious, private responses welcome!!!!!!
     
Peace
Brian

Hello party people!
My housing search continues...does anyone out there know of any rooms
opening up in the next couple of weeks? I'm still trying to find  a
household or flat shared by intelligent, creative people who are
enthusiastic about techno/house music and who are enjoy raving/clubbing
and the arts and having fun, but who are also responsible  and
multi-faceted. Any leads would be appreciated.

Adam,

     I missed BP much to my chagrin, but I believe I know who Puck is.  Puck
is a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream.  He was a sprite.
 A mischeivous green little spirit that delights in causing trouble for
humans.  Read the play it's short, funny, and has absolutely nothing to do
with television.  Peace!

I am looking for people interested in taking a wilderness first aid 
course taught by Earthbound medical which teaches how to deal with really 
bad situations in the wilderness, a good course for a few of you who like 
camping parties. I don't have a price on this yet because 1) it is highly 
dependent on the number of people who attend and 2) Earthbound hasn't let 
me know when they will have time to set  a class up (they are 3 day 
courses) but they will arrange one for a group of 10 or so.... So any 
takers?

	Mmmmmh, I'm pretty sure that your intentions are very pure, but,
	no way!, I just don't feel at ease when being tapped at a rave.

	I feel like videotapers are more "greedy," they "take" much more
	than they "give", they kinda put themselves "out" of the event by
	hiding behind a camera. Imagine more than 50% of the people at a 
	party trying to tape it... What? Everybody would just look stupid, 
	and the vibe would be ruined.

	So I _really_ dislike being shot at a rave. I don't really feel like 
	this in general, it's just that I don't feel it fits. Have you ever 
	seen rave pictures? Honestly it's not really great, neither is 
	footage... Is it? It seems like this material manage to get only 
	1/3 of the event; maybe is it because nobody has found a way to 
	catch Vibe on film yet ;)

	I don't have anything against videotapers, I just want to make
	sure with this post that they realize that some people (me included)
	are not at ease with the idea of their image being caught at a rave
	and thrown around the world (maybe not, but how can I know?)
	It's my liberty NOT to be tapped, right? But how can I enforce it?

	So please consider it twice before bringing your video stuff at a
	rave, thanx!
Renaud

Actually, you can.  There is such a thing called overhydration (water
toxicity) or too much water!  There was a case I recall in England where a
guy at a rave drank something like 4 gallons of water.  Apparantly, at that
point a condition called water toxicity reveals itself and the person
becomes seriously illin'. It is one of the few deaths that has occured in
the UG scene as an indirect result of E.

Anyone else heard of this?

Your information is out of date.  Ever hear of Leah Betts?  She and
other people in Britain have injured themselves and died from "water
poisoning".  It is becoming clear now that isotonic drinks (containing

There was the funny case of the stewardess on an airline that came up
for drug testing and drank some number of gallons of water to flush
her system ( because she had been told it would flush the drugs/residue
out ).... anyway after doing this and gaining altitude on a flight she
became so intoxicated and out of it that she had to be relieved of duty...
It made the papers...

Past the point she hit... intoxication can indeed become an even deadly
problem... proving that there's always too much of a even a good thing.

hello all-

if you're not a perl hacker, disregard this message.

help!!!  i can't seem to get the use() function working.  i know that's
odd, but it doesn't seem to work on this system.  i'm trying to use strict
and socket, but it keeps bombing.  i can require them both, so i know the
@INC is correct, but i can't USE them.

any hints?

thanks, and much love!

Maybe we could throw a video tapers only party? What if all the video 
tapers were on ketamine? 
 In some ways I sympathise and agree with your position but again, video 
tapers are like any group of people; some good, some bad, most somewhere 
in the middle. Anyone who knows me much at all knows that I give a LOT 
to the scene (in my own limited way).

I use to know some Dead Head tapers and one common thread was that the 
best shows are never taped. Kinda a post-romantic attitude if you ask me, 
but not totally without some merit. Actually, in video taping  only 
about 10 % (if that) gets used after editing (for most purposes other 
than family shots of the kids for instance). My perspective of shooting 
people is that I treat them roughly with the same respect they treat me. 
A courteous request for anonymity will be instantly met. However I feel 
very strongly that in public I can do whatever I want. If you are doing 
something in public that you feel should not be documented than perhaps 
you shouldn't be doing it in public (like comsuming drugs). This is a 
personal opinion of course and I'm willing to entertain different opinions 
on this. In general I try to respect others while capturing material that 
I can utilise for my artistic impulses.

Believe me, most video tapers are SO aware how much some people don't like 
being video taped. It is part of the thrill of doing it. And actually it 
is not your liberty (legally) to stop someone from video taping in the 
public arena. It is a free country, especially in the public arena. 
 I really feel that there should be an attempt at respect for people on 
each side of the camera. If you request that you, personally,  not be 
video taped and that person does so anyway I would encourage a like show 
of respect by throwing water or something on their camera (salt water is 
especially nasty to video cams ;) ) Squirt guns maybe? ;)

> Renaud
> 


I consider it many times and usually ask for permission from promoters 
before I bring my cam. Promoters can also support folks who feel this way 
by barring videotaping and discharging those wideo tapers  who don't 
comply.


Peace 


Ran

Precedence: bulk

And now for something entirely different....threadwise.....

Disclaimer: This is Long..and represents this afternoon's writings and
musings. Exit now, if you're not interested or think it is NRR. Thanks to
those who read. 

Since we're Geeks....an wedded to computer technology in our jobs and for
many of you in college.....I would welcome any feedback on my rantings and
ravings.

After writing a grant for 1.5 million dollars over a 5 year period, to
tranform a traditional high school, with much of it spent on new technology,
and teaching at the Junior College and High School levels..and a 10 year
believer in the promise of technology...I am now confounded and perplexed. 

Do the new technologies really improve
learning,(reading,writing,math,thinking) or are we just learning more and
more about new, expensive, and rapidly changing technologies? Is there some
strange paradox at work between learning and the increased dependence on
computers? What the computer giveth, does it also taketh away?

..I am thinking about putting together a talk, article or some consulting
services for the K-12 educational establishment.(This is the nuts and bolts
of that) Flame and Fire away at me if you wish...but I have been playing
devil's advocate with myself this morning...and the range of opinion, and
perspective of SFR is always interesting on any topic....or just tell me to
fuck off!!!

 I am going to assert heretically,(burn me at the stake) that K-12 schools
severely reduce the money expenditures spent on attempting to put computers
in every room, link every room to the internet, and that expending hugh
amounts of already limited resources of such rapidly changing technologies
is folly (evidence schools which still have Mac IIe labs and 286's)--

Evidence the new innovations and products featured in WIRED from month to
month!!If not provided by your company or school, how much of your equipment
is already obsolete?

Before money can be budgeted,teacher's trained, technology installed,
maintained,and students taught--the technology is obsolete, and it comes
from and industry that "plans obsolesence."(Windows 95,er, Windows 97 that
is!!!) 

Apple is announcing another 250 million dollar loss this quarter, putting
its total near a billion dollars lost. What effect would the collapse of
Apple have on k-12 schools which are largely Apple only schools.

My thesis is that money spent on this be limited to scaled-down Computer
Departments in K-12. The lion's share of money should be spent by
individuals, Junior Colleges,Technical Schools,Colleges, and the business
community itself.

 Neighborhood schools, given their current circumstances, and the increasing
rate of change and product development from the computer industry, will fall
further and further behind cutting edge developments. Their best efforts can
only appear as a "drop of green in a sea of red incarnadine."(Macbeth) 

Nevertheless, schools with vast amounts of technology have faired no better
on the SAT test, than schools with just pencils and books. Computers may not
simply extend or improve literacy. What do computers improve besides their
own use? They may, in fact, have replaced traditional literacy, with
electronic media...and so far, the effects on learning are not that
encouraging. 

While I am looking and studying this philosophically, I am approaching this
primarily for its pragmatic, cost-effectiveness to k-12 schools. After ten
years, billions of dollars, and millions of computers in schools....where is
the Magic Bullet?? Where is the Modern Miracle??????

In the wake of the Unabomber Manifesto, and other recent anti-technology
books; The Gutenberg Elegies by Sven Birkets, Amusing Ourselves to Death by
Neil Postman, and A is for Ox "The Collapse of Literacy and the Rise of
Violence in the Electronic Age,  by Barry Sanders......

.......I am wondering if those of us who so eagerly embraced the new
interactivity of computers,cd-roms,webs,hyperlinks,electronic books,etc..are
having any second thoughts about the "brave new world?"

Unlike the hippies, who embraced the Romantics for their back to the land,
filthy lucre($$$$), anti-government, anti-industrial
themes,Geeks,Nurdboys,and techno-ravers have hitched our wagons to the
progressive scientific materialism of the late 18th century; i.e.,a belief
that the end of all this scientific progress will be positive, and possibily
result in some form of utopian society or enlightened community. 

For man freed from physical labor,would be free to educate himself,create
abundant material wealth sufficient for all, and transform an adversarial
political system into a cooperative one. Does there seem to be a utopia at
the end of this technological tunnel? 

This is the Information Age isn't it...but people don't really seem to value
the information (paradox principle)  We seem more interested in the Messager
than the Message (paradox principle at work again.)

A brief look back at the history of the machine and it's technological
babies shows us that the writers and thinkers of each epoch heralded the
"new" gadget as the coming New Savior, a messiah or MAGIC BULLET to cure
every social ill.

I'm gonna fast-forward here, past the machine age to the Information
Age--The radio,the television, were thought to bring access to information,
once only reserved for the elite. Television,(once thought to provide the
common man with the equivalent of a college education, has trivialized
politics, and replaced high culture with entertainment only. Also, it has
replaced reading the paper as a major source of information. Newspaper
subscriptions are dropping, book sales are likewise falling.  In fact, the
computer and the net threaten to replace the printed word and the television
altogether. What are the possible consequences of that?

If you don't know, the US ranks last in literacy among industrialized
nations, while we have the greatest access to
libraries,newspapers,bookstores,television,
computers,(all manner of electronic media)--every accessment indicator says
that we are reading less, and know less as a general populace.(The paradox
principle)

We have the highest prison popluation, 80% of whom are illiterates. In the
area of public debate, we might be better served to address some gang
members,criminals, and drop-outs as illiterates to emphasize the problem,
for without literacy, one cannot be a functioning member of society.
                                1(Barry Sanders--A is for Ox)

 However, it appears, like the world of economics,  the rich are getting
richer, and the poor getting poorer, while the technological elite are
getting more skilled and educated, while the middle and lower class, are
less informed and unskilled.

So, is the computer of the 90's really the television of the 50's???Just
another diabolical gadget? In the past few days, it has been the technology
stocks that have triggered the 7-10% drop in value on the Dow. Nasdaq
(primarily tech) stocks dropped 15 per cent. Bill Gates stock holdings
dropped 200-300 million dollars in value. Wouldn't you like that problem??????

 Is the market losing its belief in sustained technological change and
unrelenting innovation.  Anybody for putting the Genie back in the bottle???
But since there is no going back, what does the future really hold in store
for us? How do you stop a runaway train anyway?

 I think, we just might be that we are more the by-product of the word, than

  Hi all.
  I had a really bad commute home today, and I'm new to the area & haven't
got any friends to call and cry at.  I just need to get some stuff off my
shoulders.  This is a personal, NRR post.  Skip it if you don't care to
read about my feelings.
  Argh.  I take the CalTrain home, live in SF, work in Palo Alto.  I don't
mind the lengthy commute, it gives me time to read.  Anyway, today the
train was stopped just before Redwood City - a southbound train hit and
killed someone at that stop.  It broke my heart.  Then I tune into some of
the conversations and mutterings around me... people saying awful things
like "another fucking suicide..."  Everyone seemed to be focused on the
"delay" part of the announcement, rather than the "fatal" part.  Even if
it was a suicide, does that make it less tragic?  Don't people empathize
with the misery someone would have to feel to step in front of a train
moving 70mph?
  I was pretty much stunned, feeling deeply hurt and saddened.  And then
we started moving again, and one of the conductors was being a jerk,
shoving people around and bellowing... urgh.  And then, on the bus, there
were some young men sitting behind me being really insensitive.  One was
blaring some really awful music (I mean the lyrics, the message - I can't
judge the music, but there is no excuse for music that actively promotes
murder, racism, & the debasement of women)  The other was smoking crack.
I choose not to use drugs - I respect the choice of others to do so, and
don't mind being around them (how could I rave otherwise?) when they do.
But the second-hand smoke from crack is quite intoxicating.  I had no
desire for a confrontation, so I got off the bus.  Crack freaks me out.  I
would have been almost equally upset by someone smoking a cigarette or a
joint on a public bus, but probably wouldn't have felt the need to get
off & walk.  It strikes me as really insensitive to expose people to
dangerous side-effects of a drug, whatever that may be.  At a rave, I make
a conscious decision to allow myself to be exposed to such effects.  I
have made no such choice when I ride the city bus.
  Argh.  I just saw way more than my share of insensitive, cold, cynical
people on the way home from work today.  I don't get it - how can people
be so self-centered?  Doesn't it hurt to hear that a life has ended,
regardless of whose life?
  On a day like today, it's hard to cope emotionally without some support.
I could really use a hug or a couple of vibes in the right direction.
Someone to tell me I'm not crazy to feel hurt and upset by these things.
  Thanks...

So, random drug question. how come ketamine, a somewhat popular back-east
rave drug,
and one that is hallucinogenic (feel free to argue about that statement)
, as well as having some serious alien experiences attatched to it,
is such a non-thing out here.

(by alien exp, i mean that _all_ of the people that I know who have used
it intesively  have described visiting different planets,
and many have felt that they have caught glipses of, or 
even come into contact with, alien lifeforms.)


is it a synthetic vs artificial thing?

Not that I really care, i just find it odd.

where did I buy my grammer anyway? Prolly the same Bazaar I bought mt 
spelling from.

take care

If you play drumms or know any that plays drums, please read.

I have been in a local band for the past two years.  We play a very mellow
alternative style with strong bluesey guitar solos and a strong singer with
very intelligent lyrics.  We have done two studio projects and have played
several clubs in the SF and Berkeley area.  Recently we fired our drummer.  

We are looking for someone who is very solid and creative.  We are not
really fast but we would like to have a very solid rythm section with a
little jazz influence.  If interested please e-mail back.  I can also mail
an attachment with our demo in .wav format.

Thank you,
Wolf

More anecdotes...I had a very interesting time on DXM, the first in fact, 
walking out into the desert at BM two years ago.  Trancelike...tough to 
describe.  But every subsequent experience has been in party situations, 
and they've been pretty much a drag.  I think it's definitely not a good

  Seems to me that the main unity among all three is that they started 
out as dance music.
  Classical music came out of the confluence of two traditions: sacred
music, which helped carry the religious message of the service, and
secular music, which was dance music from the taverns to the courts.  A
lot of the names of movements of early classical music came from the
dance (gigue, bouree, chaconne, etc.).  But little by little, the "get up
and dance" part of classical music disappeared. There are still folks who
do classical waltz today; but it is professional ballet that carries on
most of the dance part of classical music.  Dancing to classical music,
however, isn't for the plain folks. If you got up during a classical
concert and started to boogie, you'd be thrown out or locked up. 
  Jazz had something like the same beginnings: the blue notes and rhythms
of spirituals worked their way into the early jazz played at brothels in
New Orleans. Then, with the advent of bebop in the 40s and 50s, folks
stopped dancing to jazz (Charlie Mingus used to tell people who started to
dance at his gigs to sit down, shut up, and listen). "You can't wiggle
your butt and really listen at the same time," John Handy once said. So,
though there are still folks who dance to jazz, jazz dance is becoming
more and more of a hobby form: something you learn because you're
interested in the genre, noty because it has a life of its own with broad
popular support. Jazz itself, like classical music, is in danger of
becoming a museum form: a tiny corner of the music world that can't
support itself without government and private grants to keep it alive. 
I hope this doesn't come to pass. Jazz is America's greatest contribution 
to the music of the human race, and deserves to survive on its own 
without institutional transfusions of cash.
  Techno seems to me to have been born without the sacred roots. Some 
trance and ambient seem at times to be headed in the cosmic direction; 
but the roots of the music are secular. Whether or not techno musicians 
can make music that appeals to people in future generations remains to be 
seen. If not.... then picture yourself as Gramps or Grandma in the year 
2050, with the young whippersnappers snickering, "Oh wow! That old-time 
techno is REALLY funny! Imagine people actually wanting to listen to 
thump-music for hours!"

It is a defense mechanism.  Most of them would be afraid to show any
significant emotion in such a public place.  Our culture vaues toughness so
very much more than openness and sharing.   Even more, many of them
are not really that sure that they could not end up in a similar situation.
(Is that what happens when you LOSE the rat race?)

They make remarks such as those to try to _avoid_ empathizing.

That sounds like _his_ defense mechanism.  In some railroad people the sorrow
over these tragedies turns into anger.  Not excusable, but not typical either.
Caltrain conductors are mostly very nice and professional.

It's very hard on the engineer, of course.  All he can do is slam on the brakes
which will stop the train about half a mile later, blow the horn and watch.


Rave is an antidote for some of the conditions that make people jump in
front of trains.

A place of Peace and Unity, which to Love and Respect,

Some interesting points have been made on VideoTaping.  I think it was   
Heisenberg who first recognized this important scientific principle: to   
observe is to disturb.  In scientific circles, it means that any system   
you wish to observe is changed by virtue of the fact that you observe it.   
 In raves, it means that by trying to record the vibe, you can disturb   
it, even destroy it in the extreme case.  People can't let go when they   
know they are being observed, and a camera is the coldest of observers.

It's something to think about.  Videotaping a public event may be within   
the bounds of one's rights, but if many find it disturbing, then perhaps   
it's not within the bounds of courtesy.

Welcome David,

Sorry to hear that you had a bad rave day. My not so vast, yet pleasant experiences, have brought
me to the conclusion that the smaller parties are the best place to start; if the people and the
vibe are what your looking for. "New Moon",  "F&F", "Tribal Future",  "Sunset",  "F8" and our very own
"BBQ & beats" are a few that I would recommend. Try meeting up with a few of the "sfraves"
members at one of these or other parties. I have found them to be quite good company on various
outings. I think the "smaller space",  "fewer distractions" angle gives you a better chance to spot
,and consequently meet, some our local ravers. Then set ready to make your own vivacious vibe.


Take care,
                     Jason

Good day,

>>pluR, StEvEo

I don't believe that we can expect others to act or react as we would like them to. PLUR is a 
wonderful concept I hope catches on; and I am trying day by day to incorporate it into my life.
But I don't see where it is always possible for me, with my beliefs, to practice it. Certains actions,
I think, deserve an opposite and not always equal reaction. This can empower people to affect my
actions: a weakness to be carefully monitored. But, I cannot let go of my instinct to react during
"extreme" situations. Especially if it is someone I care about. 

And then there are THOSE instances...man hits old lady in jaw and runs off with her purse....

Do you?
 
a]  watch him run off
b]  check to see if the victim is alright
c]  step on the gas pedal, knock him down, jump out and whack him as he tries again to flee

In this situation, and it was a real live one folks, I don't see how plur applies. 

I guess my point is that anything taken too far, even plur, can get ridiculous. 

This doesn't mean that we can't be civil and caring in our daily interactions with those around us;
to create for ourselves a better world in which to live. It's that whole "do unto others" thing.

Be kind and take care,
                                            Jason

P.S. It's difficult to come back to civilization after a week of camping bliss. IT'S not very civilized.

Subject: The Perils of Raving In The Summer
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Dear All;

        It's that time of year again. I thought I would offer up a little
loving reminder. Hey, I want to go to raves; not funerals for my friends.

        From Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary:

        dehydration: 1. Removal of water from a substance. 2. Contrition
resulting
         from excessive loss of body fluid intake. Occurs when output of
fluid         
        exceeds fluid intake. May result from fluid deprivation, excess loss
of fluid,      
        reduction in total quantity of electrolytes, or injection of
hypertonic         
        solutions. 

        water intoxication: 1. Intoxication ingesting large quantities of
water or from 
        kidney disorders that reduce urinary output. Symptoms include headache, 
        dizziness, vomiting, convulsions and coma. Death may result.

        heat cramps: 1. Acute painful spasms of voluntary muscles following
hard 
        work in a hot environment without adequate fluid & salt intake; in 
        other words a rave.

        F.A: remove the patient to a cool place and give a salt solution
(1/4 tsp, or 1g 
        of table salt in a glass of water) by mouth. Repeat at 5 - 30 minute
intervals 
        until cramping stops.

        heat exhaustion: Acute reaction to heat exposure. Not the same as
heat         
        stroke.  See either attached heat.gif or heat.psd for a table of
differences

        heatstroke: 1. An acute & dangerous reaction to heat exposure.         
        Characterized by high body temperature, usually above 105 degrees F
(40.6 
        degrees C); cessation of sweating, headache, numbness;tingling and
        confusion prior to sudden delirium or coma; fast pulse; rapid
respiratory 
        rate; usually elevated blood pressure. The basic defect is failure
of the heat 
        regulating mechanisms of the body.

        TREATMENT: Effective therapy may save the patient's life. Without
delay, 
        the patient should be placed in a bathtub filled with ice water,
preferably 
        nude. This will not cause pain, shock, or cutaneous
vasoconstriction. The 
        patient's temperature will need to be monitored carefully. Remove
from bath 
        when temperature fall below 103 degree F (39.4 degrees C). If ice
water & 
        bathtub are not available, place wet sheets on nude body, fan
vigorously, 
        and massage the skin. The use of sedatives may be required to control 
        convulsions. Careful observation of patients for signs of fluid
imbalance and 
        renal failure will be required for several days.

        Remember to keep track of how much water you have consumed, and use
good, simple common sense. Please, please take care of yourselves; it starts
with you!!!!

Peace
Brian

Hi Robertj,
 I don't quite understand your post... yup, I did go to Syntonic; rocked,   
did it not?  ;)  Did we meet?  Well, I'm embarassed to admit that I'm not   
entirely sure.  I met a lot of folks, and I might well have met you.   
 Were you the dude who set up the camera?  It was that camera I was   
thinking of when I wrote my last message.  A friend of mine pointed it   
out to me and indicated that she found it a little disturbing.  Not a   
huge deal, but as I say, I think it's a bit of a vibe taint, and I know   
I'm not alone in that feeling.
 -Roy

This last weekend,  another rave promoter from the San Diego area touted
a party called "The Magical Sunshine Festival" with Thomas from Wicked,
and a host of other out of town DJ's.   We were just getting ready to
head out there,  when we got word that it got busted.

The flyers were huge glossy suckers... it was supposed to be up at Live Oak
Springs,  off of I-8.   Would this happen to be the same promoter?

Word got out that this was an "Underground" but many tickets were sold
at $20 each for this party.

It turned out that it was NOT under permit,  and was shut down even before
it started.

" The funny thing about regret is...."

Well the funny thing about video taping is.... most people are shy or at
least affected by being taped BUT in my experience they love it when they
see themselves up on the large screen LATER..... (usually)

 Like Randy I also video tape as some events ( I'm a visual's guy after
all ) and occasionally people ( often who don't know me ) are at least
shy or at most paranoid about it... I'm always open to them asking me what
I'm up to and I'm personally very careful not to overextend my welcome and
very sensitive about not poking the camera into private moments like drug
taking, sexual experession etc..... further more I carefully edit before
I show anything....

  But then I sometimes tape because I love the scene not because I want to
expose it to harsh or unjust critism..... thus I act accordingly....

Just heard about an article in a UK rave publication that says they are
investigating the effects of E on the body's ability to regulate water
level and sodium levels.  Yes, you can drink too much water and bring your
sodium level so low you are in serious danger.  Plus, like all drugs, it
varies with the individual.

These are not toys to be taken lightly.

	The "sick" feelings come from the nasty syrup that the DXM is
usually sold in, not from DXM itself. There are ways to extract the DXM
from the syrup to avoid this, if it is really a problem. Additionally,
many people don't take enough DXM to reach the interesting "plateaus",
and DXM is a VERY "dose centric" drug - taking a dose below one of the
thresholds will have significantly different effects than a dose of just
a little more that puts you over the threshold. You have to keep track of
the mg/kg ratio and taking the same amount as your friend who weighs 120lb
when you weigh 150lb isn't going to work.

	The fun stuff starts at 7.5mg/kg for most people, and I frequently
am taking it in the 11 to 13mg/kg range. This means, for example, that
I need to drink _3_ of the 4oz (30mg variety) bottles to reach that point.
ONE 4oz bottle is not enough for anyone to get interesting effects, unless
you weigh 90lb or something...

Tyrosine is good for catecholamine depletion..
Any drug that releases dopamine will make you feel tired afterward,
so stock up on tyrosine if you indulge.. Make sure you drink a lot of 
water too..  I have heard that dehydration is crucial in the England deaths..

best advice, stay away from anything you don't know intimately..

Subject: SRR: Montel Williams and Ephedrine
X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 1.4>

Precedence: bulk

Hey, did anyone see the Montel Williams show last night?  (Or am I the only 
one who thrives on 5 hours of sleep?)  It was about the perils of ephedrine.

The guests:
        A couple who had lost their son after he suffered
        massive coronary failure.  He was a high school football
        player, 6'1", 200 lbs., athletic, and he had been taking 
        a dietary supplement that contained ephedrine.

        A pharmacologist.  A very fired up individual who was
        incensed over the rampant selling of ephedrine in 
        everything from dietary supplements to legal
        recreational substances.

        Two teenagers that took large doses of ephedrine to get
        high.

        A body builder who had been taking energy boosters
        containing ephedrine, and who had suffered a minor
        stroke and is still slightly brain damaged.

        AND...  The CEO of Herbal Exctasy (sp?), Sean something.

I gotta tell ya, Sean came off like a serious money grubbing jerk on this 
show.  He went on and on about how ephedrine in an herb like Ma Huang was 
far safer than the ephedrine found in "drugs".  He kept asserting that there 
was a distinction to be made between herbs and chemicals, as if the two have 
no connection.  He purported to have some kind of expertise in pharmacology 
but would not mention where he got this knowledge except to say he'd been to 
some private schools and talked to some people, none of which he would name. 
 He hid behind the wording on the packaging of his product, as if that 
absolved him of any responsibility.  He claimed ignorance of or refused to 
acknowledge

        1. anyone abusing his product by not following
           the directions and taking either too many or
           taking it too frequently, or both,
        2. anyone using the product below the age of 18,
        3. and any delitirious effects of Ma Huang.

He came on the show with a t-shirt on that had the phone number for ordering 
his product.  At one point he admitted to Montel that his primary motivation 
was to make money, and he began trying to make it look as though what he was 
doing, selling a potentially dangerous substance that wasn't literally 
illegal was in effect a battle for Constitutional integrity.  I imagine the 
next step would have been for him to wrap himself in an American flag and 
start singing the "Star Spangled Banner".

Give me a break.

Y'know, if you want to alter your state of mind with various substances, 
fine.  If you want to sell those substances, legal or illegal, whatever.  
But let's not kid ourselves.  Sean made a statement somewhere along the line 
that people have a right to be informed, but he's dodging the issue by 
avoiding the questions, fabricating factoids, and being disingenuous.

One of the things that griped me was his hiding behind the "herbs are safer" 
myth.  Folx, think about it:  Plants have varying levels of a given 
chemical.  But distill the target chemical out and you can at least control 
the dosage.  With Ma Huang, you don't really know how much or how little 
ephedrine there is in a set amount of the herb.  You could be taking a 
really large amount or a really small amount.  There's very little control 
there.  At least when it's distilled out there's some control over the 
amount being taken.  Not that I'm advocating the use of ephedrine.  
Personally I think it's nasty stuff.  It's fat soluble, so it has a very 
long half-life in the human body, allowing the substance to accrue in your 
system with regular usage until, although you're taking small amounts, the 
overall level in your system reaches an extremely high toxic level.  I'm 
just saying that "natural" doesn't mean safe.  Hemlock is natural and it 
will kill you.  Ephedrine occurs naturally in Ma Huang.  Extract it and what 
do you have?  Ephedrine.  Same chemical, same effects.  Period.  Same with 
caffiene.  Is caffiene better for you when it comes naturally in coffee than 
when you pick up caffiene tablets at Walgreens?  Or do both make you jittery 
and cause you to write long missives about jerks you see on late night TV?

Ok...  I'm laying off now.  But after seeing this guy on TV, I'm more 
convinced than ever that what we have in Sean is the typical dark side of 
the American success story: someone selling a product that's dangerous but 
not illegal for as long as they can get away with it because there's a huge 
market for it among those not bright enough to think for themselves.

Nuff said.

     You're all wet.  Although 'water toxicity' is possible, I think the 
     point is it's better to have a little too much than a little too 
     little.  Dancing, hot rooms, fans, excitement, and hot audio and video 
     equipment are all a good reason to be thirsty.  I guess if you find 
     yourself bloated and unable to move in a pile of empty Evian bottles 
     you've gone too far, but cool heads prevail.  Carry water with you, 
     and if your mouth feels dry, or it seems like a good idea, drink it.

     I can just imagine the Burning Man headlines... Hundreds dehydrated 
     due to local San Francisco overhydration scare.  Film at 11.

Actually, you can.  There is such a thing called overhydration (water 
toxicity) or too much water!  There was a case I recall in England where a 
guy at a rave drank something like 4 gallons of water.  Apparantly, at that 
point a condition called water toxicity reveals itself and the person 
becomes seriously illin'. It is one of the few deaths that has occured in 
the UG scene as an indirect result of E.
     
Anyone else heard of this?

Greetings Friends =)

Barring any disasters at the printer, we will have FnF tickets available
this Saturday at the SFR BBQ and Beats gathering a well as at Sunset on
sunday. As usual they will be really nice flourescent laminates =)

I *strongly* encourage those of you that want tickets to get them at either
of these events, they may be gone my monday. Just ask soemone wearing one
of those flourescent smileys you've prolly been seeing, they can prolly
point you in the right direction =)

I also wanted to mention that this party will be a benefit for
hyperreal.com, the system this list runs on and indeed a bastion of
electronic music, rave and alternative culture not only locally but
worldwide. Unfortunately our budget for this party, with a a donation of
$5, is right at the break-even point. We will, therefore, have a donation
box at the party and I personally would encourage everyone to support this
amazing and ongoing project. Many, many thanks to Brian and to everyone
else that has made hyperreal what it is. Nice one.

love ya
ethan

I beg your pardon Renaud, I think some rave pictures are fantastic and
definately give some vibe of what raving is about. Unfortunately there are
not many good or great photographers in the rave scene. I don't mean to
toot my own horn here, but I think you should look at some photographs I
took at Sunset a  couple years ago (http://www.bigz.com).

Alas, there won't be a Sunset on Sunday, or at least PAcific isn't planning
one at this point, so the SFR BBQ would be the better bet.

I saw Glen from the L.A. Real World at a Sunset last year.  It's a funny
thing when you've seen someone in "real life" on t.v.  and you think their
and idiot.  I didn't want to talk to him and I probably wouldn't have
talked to Puck either.

Sure, a little too much is okay.  A little too little is okay too.  I think
what people are worried about here is a case where someone is feeling bad
because of too much of drug x or y or z and thinks "OK, I'll just hydrate
myself out of it."  

First of all, maybe this false confidence can mask a real problem, and
second of all, yes, there is the possibility of overhydration.  Water
seems so harmless, and I can see where someone could get into the 
"more is better" mind set  (Naw, not a raver, they never think that ;) )
and get him/herself into trouble.  So yeah, you've REALLY got to overdo
it to become overhydrated, but it's important that people know the
possibility exists.

i personally see no harm in them, provided one follows mike clay's lead:
"not poking the camera into private moments like drug taking, sexual
experession etc..... further more I carefully edit before I show anything...."

seems like common sense to me.

Hi Steve =) and anyone else who's bothered to read this note...

Yes it's true, I remember that case back home in England, plus a couple of
other cases over the last 10 years that I've been on the rave scene. You
really can drink too much water and DIE from water toxicity. It's bloody hard
to drink anywhere close to 4 gallons of water, but evidently it can be done.
Excessive water drinkers take heed.....

Due to  circumstances Ethan won't be spinning at the BBQ & BEATS II, but we
have gotten Monty to step in for him.  It's really great that he can do
this in such a short notice. I'm looking forward to hearing him spin since
I'm not sure I have yet.  So the lineup will be...

Todd Manley, Jonathan, BioJeff, Monty and Tom

2-9pm, the BBQ will be hot from 2-8pm, there will be a limited amount of
food supplied by the SF Raves Collective,  but to make it even better
please bring some food  to share and your positive energy. We hope to see
everyone out there Sat.  Location and directions will be posted on Friday
at some point so call...415-974-4357.

Good day,

I think it's a great idea to try and capture the moment on film.  Precautions must be taken to keep
photos that may contain illegal activities from the public forum.  Beyond that, what's wrong with
trying to help remember all of the wonderful times we've had, and who we've had them with?
In the scope of history past, do you really think today's raver will end up trying to deny, at some
congressional subcommittee, that he or she inhaled?  If our rights to express ourselves freely
diminishes much more, these pictures may be the only evidence left to expouse the wonderous 
benefits of music and dance on the human psyche.

Take care,
                     Jason

P.S. Just finished looking at some of my camping trip photos...could that be substance abuse?!!

Good Day,

One grade a metal head here!  I still listen to all of the music I have acumulated over the years,
especially older Metallica.  Ever try to vacuum the house to ambient ?  It just isn't the same.

Actually, I have my own views to what is and is not a raver...

People who are " at parties hootin' at girls and selling bunk e's
and getting free feelies on the dance floor and taking advantage of
people..."  may Go to raves...  

I don't consider them as ravers tho...

A raver, to me expresses a certian degree of "awarness" which others may or
may not sense... Of the very few to whom I really discussed this with have
come to a same conclusion...  We, ravers, are not unlike monks or mystics
that gain thier insight through meditation,  frenzied dance, or just the
association of being in theour SFR community, gaining a concioussness and
communal awareness...

I 'party' every weekend, and in the early years I could relate to scannin the
crowd for "e-gals" or "crossing" (buying a large amt of E @ discounted price
and selling in 1 and 2's at value)...
But as time wore on I choose to which scene I assoicated with.  Being more
underground  and attached to the vibe...  
To me,  in 93 and 94 the scene probabibly had some of the most darkest
aspects of what ravers (just going out to get high and/or laid ect..) were,
and to my understanding this was fuled tremedously by the media...
And, in a way, that was good since it pushed us back into the underground... 


So,  I see thoes that Michal describes on a weekly basis as just flegling
scensters, trying to figure out which path to take and just hope that, in
time, they too might choose thier way...

Wiether thier way  be right or wrong,  light or dark it must be accepted...

"Dance with me.."

Yeah, but ambient's great for doing stuff where you hafta stand still, like doing 
dishes.  Cuz if i listen to anything with any sort of a beat, I'll end up dancing the 
whole time & getting nothing done at all!  With some sort of ambient type of music, 
your brain goes sailing off into the horizon to think odd random thoughts while your 
hands do the dishes! :)  Cuz lord knows *I* don't wanna be around while doing 
dishes...


Love,
Shawna

Jason, bring those to the BBQ, I'd love to see them. What a week of camping
that was. It too bad we do that once a year, but then again we do enough
partying and camping for most of the year in that one week.

I wish everyone on the list could have been there. They would have had a
great time. Camping, party, live band, spinning some records. About 50
people showed and about half left 2 days later when it started to thunder
and rain  alittle. Seperated the true campers and partiers from the week.
It was great. Neither rain, hail, slush and mud didn't ruin it, it was a
blast!! Sitting at the campfire when it was raining was refreshing and not
at all cold. In fact it was nice and cool, maybe body temp.

Did the bear visit again on Monday or tues. Also when you come for the BBQ
can you bring may blue cooler that Steve borrowed and my power strip.

Hey, why all the fuss over video taping at rave events?  As long as it does
not interfere with what we're trying to do there.  I mean, we're not ashamed
of who we are and what we do....right?  Sure, our gatherings are personal,
but indiscrete taping should not bother anyone.  Most would not even know it
was occuring.  So I ask again:  we're not ashamed of who we are and what
we're doing....right?  Perhaps, some are actually very reluctant to really
look at themselves afterall.

In Love for Truth,

Being ashamed and breaking the law are tow different things.  I know many 
people that aren't ashamed of smoking pot and are very open about but 
that doesn't mean they want to be filmed partaking of illegal activites 
which could get them arrested?!  I do illegal things sometimes (I'd say 
everyone does but I'd get flamed ;) and I'm not ashamed of them, but I'd 
rather not have those moments/times be publicly accessible.

It's not really a matter of how we feel about what we do but what other
think and their actions. Your employer or familiy may have a very
different view on what we do and it may have dire consequences if they
would find this on the web. Since I know that in my line of work I'm
kind of limited to larger companies or universities to work at, I prefer
to be somewhat discrete towards them about what I do in my free time.
I feel that if we really want to change something in this world, people
like us should come to positions of power. I have no problem with them
lying about inhaling or whatever, as long as they use there position
for the good of all (unlike the famous non-inhaler). Being too open
about whatever illegal hobby one might have can be very harmful to
the individual, as well as to our scene, since it will not likely be
understood by the Hard Copy type of people...

of course, proving that that joint you were smoking ("joint? what joint?
that was a self-rolled herbal cigarrette!") on video might be a tough job
for the prosecution in court. =)

For reference, the one time I did the DXM thing, I ingested 6 ounces of that
lovely syrup we all know and love.  I weigh 135, and let me tell ya, I must
have reached one of those "threshholds".   5 hours of absolute seperation
from my body.  I could not possibly see taking it in any other environment
than a very DARK room, with plenty of music on a 7 disk changer.  Cover up
any lights including the little l.e.d.s on your stereo, they will make you
dizzy beyond comprehension.  Prepare to be completely immobile.
Try this one next time you robe: create an environment, choose your mode of
flight, butterfly wings work well, observe how your music completely changes
your environment as you explore it, measure by measure, song by song.
I can't say I have the urge to do it again, very draining, but I'm glad I
tried it.

Trainspotting is the act of keeping track of Trains and what time they come
and go. It's also a term used to describe people who have to keep track of
all teh hot new singles being played. A trainspotter, for example, would be
the guy right in front of the dj's face asking him what what record
he/she's played right after they're done with the mix.

Ok, the important stuff first.
Thanks to everyone who responded to the BP pictures. The script was a 
total hack in the middle of the night that was completed in 23 seconds, 
but it works. So, please check http://www.lbl.gov/~kumar/bp and send me 
the picture descriptions/script bugs.

Secondly, Promise pictures are in the same format: 
http://www.lbl.gov/~kumar/promise
The promise story is there, lovingly typed in by Andy Wyszkowski.

Finally, my little BP review:

Hmm. Definitely a lot of house. even older-school house. sf never 
reminded me that much of st. louis before.

The last set in the morning, lots of breaks, sf never reminded me that 
much of columbia, mo before.

And all the beautiful people!! Definitely unique to this area. The people 
(even a puck i suppose) made this party really really great, and i thank 
everyone involved with getting this party going.

(oh yeah, the price tag reminded me of st. louis too ;)
some review, huh?
check out the promise pictures

Arg. I forgot to tell everyone to look at the Promise pictures and then

Also, send feedback on how I can make this script better. 

Thanks again to everyone who had provided picture descriptions!

Chris,

I would appreciate a physiological explaination for your claim.  I really
offhand can't think of any, although I'm open to hearing any rationale you
can provide. And by the way, which drug are you referring to that releases
*dopamine*?

Please don't spread information if you really don't know.  And if you *do*
know, provide some references or at least a good explaination so that
people can respond intelligently (or reject it immediately).  Lots of
people without a medical background read this stuff and don't have a frame
of reference to interpret it in.

Thanks,
Paul

     And one from the young and stupid over the counter psychoactive 
     files...
     
     Has anybody ever heard of people taking Marazine (the sea sickness 
     stuff with the green and yellow spiral on the cover) for psychedelic 
     effect?  When I was about 15, I took 16 pills and experienced...
     
     0:00       Took 16 in photo lab at 5th period
     
     1:20       Total Inability to Balance, stagerring like a drunken 
     moron.  Had to get out of my drafting class.  Deadhead desk partner 
     laughing hysterically at how hosed I am.
     
     2:00       Three years later, the bus gets there to take me home.
     
     2:45       Walking home I see my friend Nathan.  I go up to him and he 
     dissappears.
     
     3:00       After almost meeting some other imaginary friends, I 
     realize that I might be hallucinating.
     
     3:10       Oh great mom's home.  Mom notices... Dialated pupils, quick 
     pulse and breathing.  I told her I ran from the bus stop.  Feeling 
     flushed.
     
     3:20       Try to do homework.  Pens dissappearing.  Things moving 
     when I'm not looking.
     
     4:00       Try to watch TV... waaaay to much going on.  Three's 
     Company re-runs shockingly stupid.
     
     4:30       Try to sleep.  Close eyelids.  Wild animals are everywhere. 
      Closing eyes reveals bright warm colors and squishy flowing bodily 
     sensations.  I can't tell when my eyelids are closed or open, as 
     hallucinatory creatures are passing freely between the 'imaginary' 
     (eyes closed) and the 'real' (eyes open).  Put on VanHalen's 1984.  
     Too much.  Put on Peter Gabriel's So.  Much better.  All this time I 
     am experiencing disphoria, but no really negative or sanity 
     questioning effects.  In fact, this seem shockingly normal.  Only 
     annoying affect is the fact that things I need keep appearing, then 
     dissappearing after I try to touch them.
     
     Turned tape over several times.  I put my ear up to the wood members 
     of the bed to hear 'real sound' better.  Time goes to shit.  No clock 
     in my room, and I haven't looked at my watch in a long while.  Tiger 
     jumps through my window and out my door.  I ask my mom to come 
     upstairs.  She shows up, and we're talking as she stands in the door 
     way.  Then my mom walks in, and my other mom disappears and my mom 
     starts asking who I was talking to.  I'm really worried about how 
     worried my mom is, but I have no sense of concern for myself.  I 
     eventually go to sleep, after finding my stuffed tiger from my box of 
     shit I'm too cool to leave out anymore.  I dream of stones at the 
     bottom of a running river, and clouds, and a benevolent angel.  Strong 
     music throughout the dream sounds like end of 'I am the Walrus' by the 
     Beatles, with a little of that Ofra Haza quality thrown in.
     
     Next day, still feel weird.  Friends who told me about Marazine admit 
     the had never heard of somebody taking 16, but that 'someone they 
     knew' had taken 12.  Weirdness tapers off after a couple days.  
     Closest 'common' drug might be mescaline (never have done peyote 
     proper).  Seems like this would definitely be a set and setting 
     drug...
     
     Final disclaimer... I would never do it again, because of the 
     headaches I got for a couple weeks afterwards, and the dizzy spells I 
     get sometimes even now.  But it sure was funky...

For reference, the one time I did the DXM thing, I ingested 6 ounces of that 
lovely syrup we all know and love.  I weigh 135, and let me tell ya, I must 
have reached one of those "threshholds".   5 hours of absolute seperation 
from my body.  I could not possibly see taking it in any other environment 
than a very DARK room, with plenty of music on a 7 disk changer.  Cover up 
any lights including the little l.e.d.s on your stereo, they will make you 
dizzy beyond comprehension.  Prepare to be completely immobile.
Try this one next time you robe: create an environment, choose your mode of 
flight, butterfly wings work well, observe how your music completely changes 
your environment as you explore it, measure by measure, song by song.
I can't say I have the urge to do it again, very draining, but I'm glad I 
tried it.

Y'know, I've only brought one person into the scene, and it didn't go off 
with a bang.  I mean, the newbie I brought liked it ok, but mostly was just 
plain bored with it.  I figure I blew it, so in case I'm ever in a position 
to introduce someone to the scene I need a little guidance.

1.  What criteria do you use to determine who to bring in and who not to 
bring in?

2.  What kind of rave do you bring them to first?  What do you look for, 
seeing as how there won't be anymore BPs and F&Fs are few and far between?

A good friend of mine took lots of Marazine in school and now has central

Ok, just a quick clarification for those of you who either don't have a 
web browser or or too lazy to use it ;)

This course is a medic course aimed at teaching people the skills they 
will need if something goes wrong in the wilderness or a long way from 
EMS (which may mean long enough to require a lifeflight pickup or if an 
earthquake hits and wipes out all transportation in the East Bay). Here is 
Earthbound's description of the two offered classes:
 
Earthbound's Survival Medicine Class
       A class like no other in the world! Taught by a Special 
Forces medical officer, this class explores just what you can do when 
medical support simply is not a possiblity. 

Earthbound's Wilderness Medicine Class
       Any natural disaster or civil disturbance has the potential of 
turning the area in which you live into a medical wilderness. Be ready 
for your next wilderness experience.


I am trying to get the survival course because it is more in depth than 
the wilderness course, but I can only get people together for the 
wilderness course, so be it...

Here is a review of the wilderness course, I think it statements all this 
the best:

I took the Earthbound class last year.  For those interested, here is a
review I wrote back then:


----------------------------------------------------------
The screaming stops and the silence is not welcome...  tremors are
beginning  in the climber's legs... Oh hell, here we go again... 

His body begins to convulse uncontrollably. Three rescuers dive 
across him in an effort to prevent further injury in the rocky terrain. 

Two people have sacrificed their rain gear and jackets to help keep 
the injured climber warm.  They now stand shivering and soaked in 
the pouring rain.

The convulsions cease for a moment and the team goes into action.  
Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC).  The climber is beginning to 
mumble incoherently.  Airway is clear, Breathing is present.  
Capillary refill at the extremities indicates that circulation is not 
impaired.  A serious head injury is the major concern and probably 
responsible for the convulsions.  Level of Consciousness times 0 to 
times 1 - a bad sign.

The rain is really coming down now.  It's very dark out, the sun set 
long ago. Flashlights fitfully illuminate the area where small groups 
surround the three injured men.  One climber is actually laying in the 
creek.  He is slowly turning blue as the icy water flows around him.  

Fist sized rocks are washing off the cliff face next to us.  30 more 
minutes until the Medevac helicopter is expected.  It can only carry 
two victims and all three need immediate evacuation; which ones to 
choose?

A figure in a poncho looms out of the dark.  She looks down at our 
victim and says "I'm afraid his head injuries were just too severe... 
he's dead". "Let's get out of the rain".

As the other "injured" begin to arise, our "climber" gets up as well 
and we all begin to scramble out of the creek bottom and back to 
camp.


It's been the final "scenario" for our Earthbound Medical Rescue 
training class, a two day intensive course on backcountry medicine.  
The injuries were simulated, the "victim" in the creek was wearing a 
wetsuit, but everything else was real.

This superb class teaches the essentials required to deal with major 
injuries sustained beyond the reach of professional aid.  While 
targeted at backcountry explorers and wilderness trip leaders, the 
skills would be equally useful after an earthquake or hurricane when 
local resources are overwhelmed.


Earthbound Medical Rescue is the current Wilderness Medicine 
contractor to the US Geological Survey. They have recently made 
their classes available to the general public.  The instructors bring 
with them a wealth of practical experience as EMTs with wilderness 
certification.

No prerequisites are required, although a general knowledge of basic 
first aid procedures is quite useful.  The class I took was about half 
medical professionals and half interested outdoorspeople like myself.

The class was taught outdoors and was evenly divided between 
lecture and exercises, culminating in the "emergency" described 
above.  I viewed the "hands on" portion as being, perhaps, the most 
valuable portion of the course.  Practicing skills as they taught 
reinforced the lessons and builds the confidence necessary to handle 
an actual situation.  Class size was small which allowed us to work 
with the instructors on an individual basis.

Briefly, the course contained sections on Lyme disease, Cervical Spine 
immobilizations, Level of Consciousness evaluation, Wilderness vs. 
the Urban environment, Patient assessment, Chest injuries, Shock, 
Spinal Injury, Environmental (Hypo/Hyperthermia/AMS...), 
Orthopedics, Wound Care, Bites & Stings, Medical Emergencies, Long 
term care, Rescue Considerations, and Ethics. This is not a 
comprehensive list, but provides some idea of the breadth of training 
provided.  A brief introduction to alternative medicine, specifically 
homeopathy, was also given by a guest lecturer.

All in all, I was well satisfied with the course and would not hesitate 
to sign up for any further classes that Earthbound might offer.  If 
you ever expect to be in a situation beyond the reach of 911, I highly 
recommend this training. The cost for the weekend was $100.


I have no affiliation with Earthbound Medical Rescue other than 
being a satisfied customer.


anyway, that's it

Ever notice how, when you first started raving, it was all good?  It was 
new, (almost) no party was a bad party, and everybody was cool to party 
with?  Then by the time you've been in it for six months, you avoid certain 
parties because of the promoters?  And it's because:

1. There are nasty narc/jerk/weirdo rumors going around about them.
2. They had a falling out with some other promoter you consider cool.
3. The general consensus is that their parties attract the "wrong element".
4. Your friends dislike them and they want you to go with them somewhere else.

And suddenly you find yourself going to fewer parties or picking some 
parties over others because of politics?  Sucks, doesn't it?  Leslie and I 
were chatting about this and we came to the conclusion that raving is 
easier, purer, when you first start and you DON'T KNOW ANYTHING about the 
promoter politics.  You're ignorant, and it is in fact a blissful state.

Just an observation.

Hey Kids,

	I just subscribed to this list in hopes of someone or somebodies
being able to help me out here on a trip I'm planning on making out to San
Francisco this mid August coming up.  If anyone could tell me where I
should go and what is a must to do out there while I'm going to be there,
I'd most appreciate it. 
	I already know about the FedEx rave and I'm planning on making it
out for that party.  What are some good options for clubs, say on Sunday
out there?  I'm going to be caravaning a group of kids about 18-20, alas
no twentie oners! :(  But still, can someone tell what I should check out?
	Thanks a bunch!

					Lost and bored as hell in Tucson,

Ah, Jello... what words of wisdom.

I know you all know this, so spare the flames, but since there seems to be a
number  of you that watch it..
The Real World is anything but.  Each character (and I do mean character) is 
followed all day by a camera.  Multiply the number of hours by the number
of characters in the show, and then by 7 (days).  Then hand the footage to the
MTV editors (those shapers of youth personality), and get back a half-hour of
footage.  Real??
	Not to mention that some of the kids on the show are using it to try
to further careers (at least that's what they said).  And how real can your life
be when there are cameras following you?  And will an employer turn you down for
a job, losing the free advertising?
	Sorry to vent, I got too much sleep yesterday/last night.  I'm sure you
people that watch the show just to laugh at it (I can't even do that).  But I
know a number of people who think that it IS real-life, spontaneous reality!!!!
More candidates for forced sterilization, I guess.

And because it's a useless topic, feel free to flame or reply to me privately.
I don't want to clutter up the list with it.

I know what you're talking about, but when the politics come into play
it's usually time to make quality of events a factor in your decisions
than quantity. Expecting the scene to be utopic is a bit too much,  but 
no matter what, there's still always going to be pure music and pure
people!

It can be real hit or miss.

i mean, sometimes, for me, its jkust like going to a party to hang out with 
friends. Sometimes, i get lost in these mystical loops that are 
combos of music/vibe/etc.., Sometimes, its just to listen to musik, and
relax, and hell, even do work sometimes (yes, scary isnt it).

Bringing a friend along depends on what we are looking for.

ive found that bringing people who like to dance or at least like the
music helps. 

uhm.. this isnt helping

I could not disagree with this statement more.  While I'm not intending to
start any flaming sessions, IT IS REALLY A MATTER OF HOW WE THINK AND FEEL.
We cannot allow others to dictate our actions or our beleifs, because they
rarely have our best interests in mind.  The world has spun off in very
negative directions because individuals could not and would not take
personal responsibility for their actions or their beleifs.  Hiding who and
what you are, and who and what you beleive, is more than simply self-
destructive...it causes the breakdown of independent thought and rational
actions towards the insanity of the world.  In other words, we must stand.

>for the good of all...(reference to Clinton)

While liars claim to have intentions for the 'good of all', this is not the
case and we should ALWAYS have problems with them.  Liars are selfish and
chaotic individuals seeking nothing more than their own self-fulfillment.
As far as striving to reach positions of "power"(I strongly encourage
everybody to re-read 'The Promise'), I think we need to think about real
"power" and worldly "power".  These are completely different things.

While there is an abundance of drugs at rave parties, most people usually go
to the bathroom stalls or outside to do their drugs.  Others might quickly
swallow something like 'e', but rarely have I seen many people do anything
else but smoke pot in front of others.  I don't think Hard Copy would take a
video tape of people smoking pot to the police, and if they did, how could
they arrest us or prove beyond doubt as to exactly what we were smoking?  

I think the essence of raving is the vibe.  This might be difficult to catch
on film, but don't some of you desire to share with the rest of the world
the "powerful", spiritually moving gatherings we sometimes attend?  And the
powerful, wonderous, innovative and special music we sometimes hear? I know
there is a lot that happens at some raves which the rest of society might
not understand. But I definitely think that honesty and Truth about what we
experience at times, especially those things which are 'esoteric', should be
shared with the general population for educational purposes.  

The "kingdom" is within, why not share it?  It's the only way to maintain a
presence there anyways.  As a very wise man once said...Stand!  Shine!

Love,

Troy

PS.  If I beleive in you, and you beleive in me, there ain't nothin we can't
do.  Of course, first, we must believe in ourselves.  Love don't help those

Let's look at the assumptions being made here.

   "There is a vibe of some sorts." While I essientially go along with 
    this belief it is by no means a certainty except in certain belief 
    structures (flame away). Also; is there just one type of vibe? if 
    more than one, what are they? Would all vibes be "destroyed" by video 
    taping or other documentation? Why can't a vibe exist alongside 
    documentation? If the vibe is a human construction can we not learn 
    to have it coexist with documentation? Is a camera any colder than a 
    audio tape deck? How many of you enjoy audio tapes from parties 
    you've been to? Is "disturb" choosen for it's negative conntations?

Define many. One? Three? Twenty? A thousand? If there were to be more 
video taping maybe folks would not find it disturbing.

 I would at this time like to restate my position: At any free public 
gathering on public land, I and my camera are no more intrusive than the 
often times destructive elements of a rave party. If you are doing drugs 
(or other illegal activities) in public, at a rave, you are doing far 
more to damage the vibe and the rave communitty than I or anyone else 
with a camera could ever do. In my not so humble opinion.

 If the party is public but a paid admission event I feel it is up to the 
promoter to regulate the door and well being of the public within (within 
reason) and this should include weather cameras of any type should be 
allowed in (which at big commercial concerts they are not). Again, folks 
doing illegal things openly are hurting the scene far worse than any 
camera and I have very little sympathy for them.

 If folks really want to have parties where there are no cameras, by all 
means throw them!! If a promoter asks me not to document an event I, for 
one, will respect that request.

I really am enjoying all the exchange of ideas on this subject!! By no 
means is my mind shut on this issue and hope to hear from more folks (yes 
that's an invite to you lurkers out there!!).

I brought a friend, who had never been to a rave much less heard good
underground music, to Freedom and while we were sitting on top of the
hill watching the sun rise he said that he had no idea that the feeling
of intense love from everyone there was even possible and the music 
according to his words, "it's just...just PERFECT!!!".

Last weekend I brought 4 friends to Beautiful People but in their case
they all had been to several commercial massives, I met them at the
last Funky Tekno Tribe, but they had always felt that something was
missing...yeah there was the incredible music, the mind bogling lasers
and special effects, and E but was that it? I told them about the first 
Beautiful People that I went to back in May and how it has changed my
life, so they came to BP this past Saturday to find out what they had
been missing. Later that night all they could say was that words would
not even begin to describe the intense LOVE that they felt for and from
EVERYBODY!!!! Again it changed all of their lives saying that not only
would they take that love and bring it to all the parties they attended,
including the massives, but also into their daily lives...they're
re-learning how to base their decisions on their HEART and NOT their
fears! Fear and hatred are learned emotions but we've NEVER had to learn
how to love! We were born in a state of pure LOVE!

The thing that all of my friends had in common was that they all
had a deep desire to know why they are here? What is their purpose 
in life? They all knew already that becoming filthy rich wasn't
the answer....so it seems one set of criteria could be:

1. The person is in search of the answers to their life's questions...
a spiritual mission to find more than just material wealth. Not 
everyone is ready for this since they may have yet to experience 
enough to realize that there MUST be more.

2. Bring the person to a party where you know the promoters intentions
are to spread the vibe of LOVE and NOT just to make a quick profit.

With Love and Light,
John

I always bring newbies to Sunset! It's in the day, it's in a beautiful place
with lots of nice people and people often bring their kids and dogs and stuff
so it feels like a real family.

Hi All!

 Yes it is that time to see Ran on his knees begging for help with a tear 
in his eye (can you spell melodramatic?).

 I would like to cruise by Family Circus for a bit (to say HI! to Jen who is 
throwing her first party. GO JEN!!!!) and then head up to BBQ and Beats 
as I have never been to one. Then IDEALLY go on to New Moon. Wow! I get 
flutters just thinking about all that fun (I like traveling :) ). 

 I'm also open to combinations of the above events. I'm not real picky on 
time and I will certainly help with gas. I live in Santa Cruz and 
folks can call me if they like. E-mail me and I will send you my number.

 Check with -E on my compatibility as a car mate.


HUGZ in advance!!  =)



Ran

Motivated by earlier work.  I just put some pics up of a beach clean up 
we did last summer.  It has pics of C-Labs, Ethan (and children), Tracy, 
and a lot of Cloud Factory kids, plus some nice shots of Bonny Doon.

Back at ya, Randy!  ;)

I think there is a common understanding of what a good vibe is, some   
elements of which might be people having a good time in a friendly,   
comfortable, non-threatening atmosphere.  Are you suggesting that vibe   
doesn't exist?  That would imply that the atmosphere at every rave and   
every gathering is identical, which is a difficult point to defend, I   
think.

>Would all vibes be "destroyed" by video
>    taping or other documentation? Why can't a vibe exist alongside
>    documentation?
I'm suggesting that for many people (we'll come back to that "many"   
concept) being on video makes them feel observed, recorded, and therefore   
(important point here) they are inevitably going to be more aware of how   
they appear.  Do I look like an idiot dancing?  Sure other ravers see me,   
but they're dancing.  They aren't there to watch me.  A camera is there   
solely to watch and record, and it's somewhat threatening in that   
respect.  This has a negative effect on one's ability to let go of   
thinking about how one appears... it's natural to be nervous about being   
observed.  Stage fright is a great example.

>If the vibe is a human construction can we not learn
>    to have it coexist with documentation?
Maybe we could learn, but I'm more interested in talking about how things   
are than how they could be if we could videotape every rave and persuade   
people to feel differently than they do.

>Is a camera any colder than a
>    audio tape deck? How many of you enjoy audio tapes from parties
>    you've been to?
Sure it is.  Audio tapes are typically made of the DJ's mixing, not of   
the conversations of individuals.  BIG difference.

>Is "disturb" choosen for it's negative conntations?
Yes, it is, because I'm suggesting a negative effect.
   

>Define many. One? Three? Twenty? A thousand?
Many?  Hmm.  Many is enough that I sense it in myself and have heard it   
from other people and have come to feel intuitively that "many" people   
feel the same way.  This is of course arguable, but really, do you   
honestly believe that there are NOT many people who find a camera   
disturbing?  Surely you've seen people shy away from your camera.  So you   
respect those folks; that's cool.  How about the people who are   
disturbed, but not disturbed enough to make a fuss?  They're still   
disturbed.

>If there were to be more
>video taping maybe folks would not find it disturbing.
Well, again, maybe things could be different, but I'd only talking about   
how things ARE.

>If you are doing drugs
>(or other illegal activities) in public, at a rave, you are doing far
>more to damage the vibe and the rave communitty than I or anyone else

>Again, folks

You keep coming back to illegal things.  I think cameras can be   
disturbing to people who aren't doing anything illegal, but instead just   
don't wish to feel like their actions are going to be recorded for later   
scrutiny by someone (or many people) they may not even know.

>I really am enjoying all the exchange of ideas on this subject!! By no
>means is my mind shut on this issue and hope to hear from more folks   
(yes
>that's an invite to you lurkers out there!!).
Hear hear!
While we're clarifying, I don't think cameras are evil.  I don't think   
Videotaping at a massive rave is a bad thing because it's so public to   
begin with, and there's tremendous anonymity.  I'm thinking more of   
smaller, more intimate settings.  And even then, I'm not saying   
absolutely don't do it.  I'm just saying, realize that if one tapes   
people, some will not like it.  If one goes ahead and tapes anyway...   
well, maybe those folks will just have to deal.  But at least then the   
videographer isn't living under any illusions.

Hi all,

sorry this is late but I've been sick and it's been a very depressing week.
I am getting better though.

I went last thursday to funkitron which also ws spun's birthday.  I't was
alot of fun.  It's going to be a new weekly at the maritime on 1st &
harrison starting july 25.  The dj's last thursday were Tracy, Jeno, and
Spun.  I only got to hear jeno and spun and both were great.  I got hung up
during jeno's set when he sped up a tune (accidently??) and tryed to
recover buy playing with the speeds.  It cam out all right but up till that
point i was in a dancing trance from his beats.  The music continued and i
met many great people.  About 30-40 in all but the place has great
potential.  We all sang happy birthday to spun at the conclusion and went
off to the beach to mellow out.  Great party.  I didn't go out at all this
weekend because i was sick (except for a outdoor psycadelic excursion on
friday).

Well next thursday on the 25th Josh and John Howard will be there, and i
might go if I have the energy or money.

Peace

Good day,

I would have to agree that you are a very considerate " Visuals Guy ".   And most people who see 
themselves up on the screen or in pictures with their friends do enjoy the finished product.
I was so happy knowing that someone else could see the naked dudes from Burning Man 
skiing behind a baja bug in the mud.  "Guess you had to be there"....and all of a sudden, you were.


Take care,
                     Jason

What's really amusing is those television gods over at Viacom have decided
to start up a new channel, an MTV2 of sorts. So what will be the mainstay of
programming? Music Videos, of course, bringing us back to those nostalgic
days when you could turn on eMpTy V, and actually see musicians (or an
occasional Liquid Television installment)...

ObRave: life for me is being so busy these days, so I'm missing out on lots
of great events. I'm looking forward to Nation next month, which will span
my actual birth time!

And the shadow fell away...

Big assed HELLO!!!! to my new found family I have never spoken to.  In fact,
I have never even sent a message to anyone (yes, I was scared for some
inexplicable reason...)on the net, and I'm glad I waited for the proper time
and place to loose my virginity....

So, as a newbie to both the web and rave culture, I was wondering a few
things:

--   1: What is a reasonably close estimate of the % of  lurkers vs. ...% of
what.......posters?

--   2: I get the basic picture, but please define more thuroughly  the
concept of flaming (feel free to test by fire... a little...) and is there
such a thing as a reverse flame?

--    3: I found the rave slang posts (am I using the term "post" in correct
context?) I read cool, informative and caring , and I would like to open a
 discussion topic along those lines:

                                SO MANY TYPES OF TECHNO!!!!!

Can everyone here please help this big excited guy get all these definitions
a little more in order?  I mean, some are self explanatory like ambient or
trance, but even those get broken down in to sub-categories.  And, like,
which DJ's spin what, and do we consider Hip-Hop a type of techno, or just
related cuz they both use Techniques(sp?)  I'm sure all have their own
opinions, and I'm not trying to start wars here {some people are like wine
snobs about it:  Firm urine overtones subtled by  roasted iguana nuts and
motor oil undertones with a piquant tannic finnish reminiscent of dog pubic
hair...{|8^]) }, but discussion and multiple opinions would smell nice...

To ooze a bit on a general note:

Education about the inherent truths of positivity and community given to
those who don't necessarily want to hear it MUST cotinue, and I know I dont
need to say this but it makes me feel good, so: Everyone, please, DO NOT BE
AFRAID to let the good, sincere feelings that are inside us seep out of the
cracks of our very existance and flow on to the freaking floor!!!  Those who
do not feel them inside must see that WE DO feel, it's OK, and would like
them to come along on our fantastic voyage beyond any party ever thrown!!!  I
know we all (mostly, when we arn't down for personal reasons) smile at that
scowling old woman at the grocery store, so keep it up.  And cops.  Some of
them are people too (no, really...) and it might help (besides, we need them
on our side for the revolution!).  So tell everyone to be cool to eachother
and self, and make HONESTY with everyone and self the cornerstone upon which
trust, love and a great time can be built.

Thank you all for being so real! (Hallucinations please disregard this
statement)

        I for one am not too fond of sunset. It had its moments at times
but now I'm just more into the darker type rave scenes... For instance, now
on sunday nights I try to always go to mantra because I personally love
trance, especially goa, and the ambiance is just dark lit only with
blacklights and psychedilic images and shit... Also, those f-8 parties are
always pretty cool, again because of the cybertrance, but also just because
of its ambiance.

        I mean, I don't know, but it just seems to me that some, not all,
music is better suited to different scenery. I mean sure, some funky
breakbeats and thumping bass is always a joy on a hot weekend afternoon, or
progressive, deep house in a club if you're more into that clubby,
meat-market, alcohol scene, but at least since I matured musically, nothing
beats lung-shaking cybertrance in a abandoned parisian sewer, for instance,
with movies of anime and sci-fi computer generated animations speeding like
crazy.... or mind-rushing goa eating your brain in a room only lit with
flashing strobes, lasers, and my own acid.

        Going back to sunset, it's really nice and all, and not meaning any
disrepect, but sometimes that happy shit just gets to me.

        But please people, this is only an opinion, everyone has their own
tastes...

Okay, I figure it's not too entirely early for us attendees of the BBQ & 
Beats to get a compilation of who is bringing what to the party so we 
have enough variety of yummies to eat.  

How does homemade-from-scratch hummus with onion pita bread and cucumber 
slices sound?  I'm putting the chick-peas on to soak tonight so there is 
no noxious farting going on the day of the picnic. :P  

For the many of you newer sfravers who have not met me, I will be wearing 
a white tee shirt and a maroon floral skirt. I'll have my laminate on 
too!  This is my first event in a long time where I feel like being 
social, so watch out - I wanna meet lotsa new folks! :) 

love,
Amy

Right!  And then you can put *your* energy into a group and help shape it.
Believe me, it's very satisfying.  That way it will be that much more pure.
Unless of course, you're 50% artificial (or 100% pure from concentrate) and
then we'll all avoid your sucky parties.  :^)

  Agreed.  I'll be bringing:

 .	a bunch of veggie dogs - probably not enough, but I'm poor :(
 .	a bunch of hotdog buns
 .	ketchup, mustard & relish
 .	Sprouts (veggie dogs require them, don't you know?)

  Oh yum!  I'll bring along my hummus too, and some extra pita bread, and
some falafels & veggies.  Again, probably not enough for many people, but
what the heck.

  I look forward to it!  I've not decided what I'll wear.  Don't know what
the weather will be like.  Ho-hum.

In case anyone missed it, Dave Bayer, [dlb@typhoon-ether.Berkeley.EDU]
forwarded the message below.  He's interested in taking a class regarding
emergency situations.  Ahnon has suggested this too,and I think it's an
excellent idea.  Let's get some input on this, does anyone know of any other
of such classes.  It would be great to attend one that covered other areas
such as epileptic seisures (e.g. last years sunset incident), and maybe
negative drug reactions and overdoses.  
Keep in mind the key factor of cost, perhaps if we find something good, but
not very affordable we can arrange some sort of fund raising thing.  Goddess
knows we all need one more reason to throw a rave!

>I am looking for people interested in taking a wilderness first aid  course
taught by Earthbound medical which teaches how to deal with really  bad
situations in the wilderness, a good course for a few of you who like
 camping parties. I don't have a price on this yet because 1) it is highly 
dependent on the number of people who attend and 2) Earthbound hasn't let me
know when they will have time to set  a class up (they are 3 day  courses)
but they will arrange one for a group of 10 or so.... So any takers?

Although I agree with you in general, there are several cases where it is
not wise to be open about your identity, simply because it will be directly
harmful to you. For instance, it would not be wise to visit KKK meetings
if you're black, to tell a police officer you are carrying herion and feel
you should have the right to do so or to tell your employer that you like to
smoke pot. Such actions are unlikely to improve the world we live in but
likely to ruin your chances of living happily ever after. Saying that, I
would like to add that this doesn't mean that you don't have to fight for
your rights and live as you want to, you just have to do it smarter. My
motto is, if you can't beat them, fool them. The fact is, a large part of
society, law enforcement and politics are against us, you can stand as
much as you like, being a minority you are likely to loose. I still intend
to change "the insanity of the world" but I feel our chances of success
are greater when it's done from within. Otherwise I might end up as a
unabomber-kind of person.

If you claim that you have never lied to anybody in your life, I would

You would be surprised of what people are arrested for these days. And if
are lifestyle is going to portrayed in the media as drug-infested too
many times, you can bet some politian will see it as an opportunity to
"get tough on raves". Look at the situation in England were small gatherings
have been outlawed and promotors are being sent to jail just for throwing
a party. Keep it underground, I say, they don't understand.

Look at what happened to the Flower Power generation, on average they seemed
to be more idealistic than the average hedonistic raver. They haven't achieved
too much in terms of increasing love and understanding in this world. This
is a slow process and I feel that confronting the masses with our "thing"
might backfire. For the past few thousand years people have already told
everybody that they should love each other and their planet and progress
in that direction is still slow. Raving, I think, in itself will not change
that too much. Making sure people with the right mindset enter the mass media,
politics, big business etc. might be more effective.

I think we only disagree on the way of sharing it.

I think it comes down to diversity and decisions.  We are lucky that this
scene is so diverse that we can all be satisfied by different types of
parties.  I mean, on one weekend there will be people going to a jungle
party in a wharehouse, a cybertrance journey in the woods, deep house in the
city, and ambient grooves in someone's loft.  Once you get involved in the
scene and know more about it, you start making decisions about where, when,
and who..  You start having music preferences, location preferences, and
friends in the scene. 

For me, any promoter/crew/system who believes in a positive VIBE, and the
ideals of PLUR will get my support and full props.  To me, big parties !=
(not equal) BAD.  I like going to big parties as well as small parties,
because of the immense diversity available in the people.  Big parties also
draw lots of newbies which is cool esp. when you take someone 'round and
introduce them to lots of people.

Anyways.. discuss <-

PLUR,
Aaron.

Hi everyone,

  After being gone for a while,   and after the BBQ party,  what good
party is happening that evening?    According to the calander,  there is
Eon,  Cloud Factory in Monterey area (which is kinda far,  unless I can
find riders willing to share gas,  but I won't rule it out),  and Urb with
DJ Spooky.    Is there anything else going on this Sat Evening?

I would probably bring them to a Sunset party or BBQ party or a daytime
party in the park.   It's during the day,  when the newbee is less likely

> Has anyone here ever heard of a dj named Dante?

Dante is from New York, although he now lives in San
Francisco. I've spun with him before in St. Louis, but
I didn't stick around to hear him. He seems to get a lot of
bookings on the east coast and in the midwest.

"EXTREME trance!" tonight, on MTV! With halfpipe and pro-skaters! and lots
of attractive twentysomethings!

I watched MTV for the first time in AGES last night... I'm ashamed.

I just started raving about a year ago, and when I first got into it I
noticed the politics.  ing
On the DJ side of it, I'm a rookie (less than 1 year) DJ and I've had talks
with other DJ's who can't believe how political the whole thravi is.  I was
advised not to even try and send a demo to Wicked!  I just wish that more of
the promoters would give new DJ's a chance, because I can honestly say that
some of the DJ's that are so played out are SHIT compared to some of the
fresh, new DJ's that I've had the pleasure of hearing.  I have even called a
couple of the promoters to try and get in touch with them about hearravi my
demo, and very few have called back!  

One thravi that I thrnk is funny is ho havsome promotend will be so friendly to
a DJ t I  fuwith them but they wi soalso say, hey next party you play make
sure to p theyour name nnder your DJ amme.  It's all about advertising and

The best way to become known as a DJ is to promote your own parties.  Most
promoters have thier own circle of DJs that not only spin but also get the
party together.  Look at Galen or Ethan... they became successful DJs
just by working hard on their own parties, not relying on other promoters.
Even the Wicked crew owes much of their success to putting a huge amounts
of effort into the free Full Moon raves.  

If you put effort into the scene, you will become popular.

I agree, though, that there is lots of DJ talant that is being overlooked
in the scene, and many established DJs are sounding stale.

So i was surfing the information highway, with my new kicking 
AOL browser, when the information police cruise by
(while munching on their cy-bear-claw doughnuts)
chasing david letterman in his red-mustang who is reading WIRED
and doing an EXCITE search on his cellular laptop.
Then I went into a chat room and met this Cyb3R grrl named
'amber' And our virtual beings 'chatted' about the buzz clips
on MtV. And how we went to this rave, and someone put some
U4EA in my drink, and i took my shirt off and made out with some girl
on my mustang (not davids) and then she said that was a 90210 episode
and I got scared and turned off my PC.

i forgot to ask her about cyber-trance

f course I remember a time when cyber wasn't so cliche.  Back in the 80s when William
Gibson first came up with the term Cyberspace.

I really suggest reading his books if you haven't. Neuromancer is a favorite of mine.
Lots of Hi-tech stuff, drug use, and sex.

Same concept as Real Word, 'cept its centered around a bunch of 20-ish people living in a wharehouse.  

A money greedy promoter that throws $20 parties that get broken up by 12

A DJ from New York named Super Star DJ Groove.

A slimey "X" dealer

A guy that wears nothing buy those Cereal Box T-shirts

a country guitar player from Memphis


-They're still looking for more "charactors" to fill the wharehouse.  If you know of anyone, just add em to the list......

"The media hack"

The guy who seems like a pretty normal, charismatic fellow who would
entertain people nicely in-between commercials for Zit cream and Hair
Gel.  But midway through the season, he decides to make it his personal
goal in life to use his noteriety on the Rave World to spead the message
of the evils of television and the joys of responible, community-building
dance cultures who use psychedelics to break through the mental shackles
imposed on the youth of this country, much to the chagrin of the show's
producers, MTV executives and Ted Turner.

As you can see, I have often daydreamed about being on that show.

     Hello all,
        Anybody ever heard of something called GHB? It looks like water and 
     supposedly has the effects of being on nitrous and E. A bunch of 
     people I know have been taking this stuff lately and it seems to have 
     no effect on some people while others' simply pass out shortly after 
     drinking this stuff. It looks like water and supposedly has a really 
     bad taste. Apparently it doesn't take much to get to you. Anybody know 
     what it is? I've never seen this shit, but someone said that it is 
     some sort of herbs or aminos or some shit. Later......

I agree, though it somewhat dissapoints me. DJ's are like musicians, and
shouldn't have to promote their own 'concerts' to get recognized. Talent is
talent. Often times (but not always) the music does get stale, because the
same DJ's are always hanging out and playing together in the same context.

In San Diego we had Sundays in the Park, a venue which encouraged new dj's
to come out and make themselves known. Often times an unknown jock would
get the crowd pumping more than a vet would. Sometimes a new dj would
trainwreck, but people would note the quality of the music he/she was
playing. This exemplified the overall community. We were looking out for
our own, encouraging fresh faces to become involved, giving them
inspiration by giving them a chance....

GHB is gamma hydroxy butyrate, a small naturally occuring chemical that
as far as I know (it's legal in Holland) comes as a white powder. It's
effects are feelings of well-being to mild euphoria. There are two
major problems with it, in combination with alcohol you can very easily
pass out and it is relatively easy to overdose with the same result
(passing out). It is apparently dissolved in water for easier intake.
I think a bunch of people have ended up in the ER after someone passed
them a spiked waterbottle (there was an article in the SF Weekly on
GHB some time ago). Pretty harmless for the rest. It's not allowed
by the FDA but the DEA has no problems with it, making it illegal to
sell but legal to have on you I think. It's not derived from herbs,
it's just a chemical.

Uh ho...  This question tends to come up every once in a while and no
one ever seems to answer it to a reasonable level of satisfaction...
Its really hard to describe music with words, yknow!  :-)  Lesse if I
can spell out some of the more basic terms w/o losing my audience/mind.

Ambient - (I know you said you get it already but lemme have my fun :-)
Ambient is the Little Fluffy Cloud in the sky during sundown.  Y'see,
we lived in Arizona and the skies all had Little Fluffy Clouds in them
and uh...  You don't see that...  You might still see it in the desert.

Jungle - Jungle is the shootout at the OK coral...  Sometimes its
the Romeo and Juliet but more often its litter on the sidewalk and
you knew who threw it there.  It has a habit of running around alot
but it always ends up back in the same place.

Hardcore (Happy) - Happy Hardcore is elusive.  Sometimes it can be
found hiding in a brush but lately it likes to try to stay in motion.
My advice : Just Close Your Eyes.  Get the No More Tears formula.
After all, its the Music For The 90's, kid!

House - Very popular around this time.  Be careful : sometimes there
are Six-Million Ways To Die.

- David

In case you havent noticed, I have a tendency to be of no use to anyone
:-)  You try running simulations all day and see how much sense YOU make :-P

On the 2nd page of the Bay Area Section of today's Chronicle (I think page
A18, but it's not in front of me), there's an article reporting that a few
people were admitted to hospitals last friday night due to problems
associated with GHB they took at clubs or at raves . . .

yes, I've heard of it, come across it, but have seen almost NO discussion on 
it anywhere.  I've heard it is a steriod that was used by bodybuilders.  Some 
people say it is VERY dangerous <like most drugs aren't, right>.  It is 
supposedly very popular in the gay community.

I know a few people that have taken it a lot, and they tell me that it tastes 
like bad, salty water, and it's perfectly clear.  Two or three capfuls (evian 
bottle cap) are a decent dose.  

After about twenty minutes you'll get flushed and start to lose your balance.  
DON'T ride your bike, drive a car, or try to go hiking in the woods at night.  
Don't do anything that requres serious motor coordination.  

You will like touching and feeling others.  Sex will be good, very good (and 
it doesn't require good motor skills!).  It lasts for a little under two 
hours.  No hangover.  You could take it in the morning and be fine the rest of 
the day.

If you take too much you'll vomit badly for a few hours, although I think 
you've got to take a lot to get to that point.  I know a smallish girl that 
took three to four caps over the course of a few hours and was fine.  I'm not 
sure if you can die from it, although another friend of mine said he heard a 
report about a fellow that dropped dead drinking it <sigh>

My friends tell me it's probably not even illegal.

That's all I know.  Hope it helps.
pauly

Hey all you SFRaves kids,

I know I haven't posted for a while, but I've been here at home in The
Great Southland for the last month.  Missing all of you as I do, I've been
planning on coming up for the BBQ this weekend.  However, when I logged on
today I noticed that there is going to be a F&F in the near future.  What
to do???  So I need some help.

Could someone pleeeeeeze pick me up a
ticket for F&F(I'll pay ya back as soon as I'm up there)?  I'm debating
wether or not I should come up this weekend for financial reasons, so that
would be appreciated.  Actually, pick me up two (I'll find someone who
wants to come along).  If you can, please drop me a line and let me know.

I miss you all!!!

Mr. Jake (currently .sigless :(  )

Some quick thoughts. GHB is very dose sensitive. Not enough will not
give you much of a trip. To much and you'll go to sleep. Also NEVER
mix GHB andother drugs unless you know what you doing, specially beer,
etc.

It's not a steroid and it's not very dangerous. It's:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHOOH (gamma hydroxy butyric acid)

and it acts through the GABA (GammaAminoButericAcid) neurotransmitter system,
similarly as alcohol (!). It's usually sold as the sodium salt and then
dissolved in water.

Yep, no hangover or burn out as with E.

The problem is that that point is essentially unknown until you pass it :-(

Seems unlikely.

Not allowed by the FDA (so you can't sell it in a store) but allowed by the
DEA (possesion is OK).

Actually the only compilations I bought within the last 3 months is GOA GIL

that too is pretty tight... I'm actually trying to look for a Mars vs.

Trane S. Potter -> Brash, upstart New Kid on the Block who wants to be
the new new sckool DJ on the scene. Spends most of his time a parties
trying to get as much information on tracks being played: He tries hard
to jot down copious notes but has trouble with all the strobe lights and
the fact that he gets dizzy trying to read the record labels as they
spin round n' round n' rounnnnnnd..... Carries his record bag everywhere
(coffeeehouses, the mall, etc)he goes, just in case there is a  opening
slot where he can jive his way behind the 1200s. Often seen walking down
the streets lopsided as his vinyl weighs him down. No matter, it is his
burden, and he shall shoulder it!

Flo  Werpauer -> Peripetetic Deadhead babe...keeps showing up at parties
trying earnestly to fill the void since Jerry broke on through,
man...Attempts to sell her dried leaf & twig jewelry to finance her
travels, but no one's buying. Really, really needs a shower.

     GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate)*   ---   by John Morgenthaler and Dan Joy
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

        GHB, or gamma-hydroxybutyrate, is a normal component of mammalian
metabolism. It is found naturally in every cell in the human body and is most
properly considered a nutrient. In the brain, the highest amounts are found in
the hypothalamus and basal ganglia [Gallimberti, 1989]. GHB is found in
greater concentrations in kidney, heart, skeletal muscles, and brown fat
tissues [Chin and Kreutzer, 1992]. It is believed to be a neurotransmitter,
although the jury is still out as to whether it exhibits all of the properties
required for fulfillment of this function [Chin and Kreutzer, 1992]. It is
both a metabolite and precursor of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA
(gamma-aminobutyric acid, or gamma-aminobutyrate), another nutrient to which
it bears a close structural relationship. GHB, however, does not act directly
on GABA receptor sites [Chin and Kreutzer, 1992].
        GHB was first synthesized about thirty years ago by Dr. H. Laborit, a
French researcher interested in exploring the effects of GABA in the brain.
Because little or no GABA crosses the blood-brain barrier, Laborit synthesized
GHB, which substitutes a hydroxy group for an amino group. This difference
allows GHB to cross the blood brain barrier where some of it is metabolized
into GABA [Vickers, 1969].
        As it turned out, Laborit found that GHB exhibited a range of effects
beyond those expected from GABA. Over the intervening years, numerous
researchers have extensively studied GHB's effects. It is has come to be used
in Europe as a general anesthetic, a treatment for insomnia and narcolepsy (a
daytime sleeping disorder), an aid to childbirth (increasing strength of
contractions, decreasing pain, and increasing dilation of the cervix), a
treatment for alcoholism and alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and for many other
uses.
        During the 1980s, GHB was widely available over-the-counter in
health-food stores, purchased largely by body-builders for its ability to
stimulate growth hormone release which aids in fat reduction and muscle
building. In the last few years it has been gaining popularity as a
"recreational" drug offering a pleasant, alcohol-like, hangover-free "high"
with potent prosexual effects.

        --- Scientific Reports on GHB ---

        For the thirty years prior to 1990, the scientific papers on GHB were
unanimous in reporting numerous beneficial physiological effects and the
absence of long-term negative effects. In 1964, Laborit listed "very low
toxicity" as one of the "principle elements" of the compound's pharmacology.
In a 1969 report on GHB's anesthetic uses, Vickers referred to GHB as "a
truly nontoxic hypnotic" and repeatedly emphasized its "lack of toxicity."
Vickers cited evidence that GHB demonstrates "no toxic effects on the liver
and kidney." In 1972, Laborit described the body's metabolism of GHB and
stressed "the absence of any need of detoxification by the organism."
        As recently as 1989, this scientific consensus on GHB's benign nature
remained unchanged. Gallimberti's study from that year on its uses in
treating alcohol withdrawal in humans notes that "GHB's action ...seems to be
without serious side effects." His almost off-hand reference to the "safety
of GHB" shows how well-established this property of the nutrient had become.
        Then, on November 8th, 1990, the FDA banned the over-the-counter sale
of GHB in the United States. In 1991, two scientists from the California
Department of Health Services wrote a report on ten "poisonings" associated
with GHB. The authors, Chin and Kreutzer, warned of GHB's "tremendous
potential for abuse." They observed that "all interviewed patients reported a
pleasurable sensation or a `high.' Several of them...continued taking [GHB]
because it made them `feel good'." Apparently, the authors construed feeling
good in and of itself as a potential threat to public health. Despite such
dire language, the report acknowledged that "there are no documented reports
of long-term [detrimental] effects. Nor is there any evidence for physiologic
addiction."
        Of the ten "poisonings" reported, four involved "unknown doses," four
featured the "coingestion" of other drugs, (usually alcohol), one involved
unmedicated epilepsy, and another a history of grand mal seizures. Since
alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are not
recommended with GHB, and because GHB is contraindicated for epileptics, such
cases are not unexpected. Chin and Kreutzer acknowledge that the "more severe
reactions...generally occurred when patients took an unmeasured dose, a
particularly large dose, or several doses within a short period of time."
Such problems are easily avoided by following the directions for GHB's use.
        Although the specific clinical details of these ten cases are too
lengthy to go into here, one point needs addressing--the use of the terms
"coma" and "seizures" in descriptions of these cases. At a sufficiently high
dose, GHB can cause CLONUS, a rapid, rhythmic contraction and relaxation of
muscles which would be better described as muscle spasm or uncontrollable
twitching than a seizure. GHB can also cause intense drowsiness, abrupt
sedation, and deep sleep which is probably better described as unarrousability
or deep sedation than coma. Vickers [1969] described it as a "nontoxic coma,"
which blunts some of the inflammatory connotations of the term coma.
        Regardless of their alarmist tone, the authors confirm that "there
have not been any reported deaths" and that "if product use is discontinued,
full recovery with no long-term side effects is universal." They concluded
that "the prognosis for people who experience GHB poisoning is quite good."
        The degree to which the pleasant state of GHB euphoria may be
psychologically addicting may not be fully appreciated. Anybody with known
attraction or addiction to tranquilizers or alcohol should pay special heed
to this possibility. In the few cases of GHB abuse that we have investigated,
there were pre-existing use/abuse patterns with alcohol and/or tranquilizers.
Ironically, it was GHB's lack of toxicity that led to increased frequency of
use (numerous times per day) that characterized what can only be called
classic cases of psychological addiction. Without the dehydration and CNS
irritation of alcohol, or the side effects of tranquilizers, there was no
incentive to moderate or curtail GHB use. Fortunately, few people seem to
have such overwhelming attraction to the GHB state. Even Chin and Kreutzer
minimize GHB's abuse potential by stating, "No investigator [has] reported
any long-term adverse effects, addictive or dependent qualities associated
with discontinued usage of the drug."

        --- Why Was GHB Banned? ---

        It seems likely, then, that at least some of the motives behind the
1990 FDA ban of GHB were other than those of public safety. Such a ban
constitutes the only means of Federal control of a substance neither scheduled
by the DEA nor approved by the FDA as a drug. In the absence of a genuine
public-health concern, such control might have been motivated by a desire to
protect the pharmaceutical industry (with which the FDA is closely
intertwined) from competition from a safer, more effective and less expensive
alternative to sleeping pills. Is it a coincidence that the FDA has also
banned L-tryptophan, another nutrient that functions as a safe and effective
sleep aid?

        --- What Are the Real Concerns? ---

        As with most substances, unpleasant and possibly dangerous side
effects can be associated with excessive doses of GHB. A dose usually only
about twice the amount required for relaxation or a prosexual effect can, as
one user put it, "knock you out but fast." In this respect, GHB is probably
comparable to alcohol: if you drink twice as much as you normally would, you
probably wouldn't function very well. Despite its general safety and lack of
toxicity, the safe use of GHB requires information, preparation, caution, and
good judgment. In other words, follow the usage guidelines!

        --- How Does It Feel? ---

        Most users find that GHB induces a pleasant state of relaxation and
tranquility. Frequent effects are placidity, sensuality, mild euphoria, and a
tendency to verbalize. Anxieties and inhibitions tend to dissolve into a
feeling of emotional warmth, wellbeing, and pleasant drowsiness.
        The "morning after" effects of GHB lack the unpleasant or debilitating
characteristics associated with alcohol and other relaxation-oriented drugs.
In fact, many users report feeling particularly refreshed, even energized, the
next day.
        The effects of GHB can generally be felt within five to twenty minutes
after ingestion. They usually last no more than one and a half to three hours,
although they can be indefinitely prolonged through repeated dosing. The
effects of GHB are very dose-dependent. SMALL INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT INGESTED
LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION OF THE EFFECT. Higher levels feature
greater giddiness, silliness, and interference with mobility and verbal
coherence, and maybe even dizziness. Even higher doses usually induce sleep.

        --- The Actions of GHB in the Body ---

        GHB temporarily inhibits the release of dopamine in the brain. This
may cause increased dopamine storage, and later increased dopamine release
when the GHB influence wears off [Chin and Kreutzer, 1992]. This effect could
account for the middle-of-the-night wakings common with use of higher GHB
doses, and the general feelings of increased well-being, alertness and arousal
the next day.
        GHB also stimulates pituitary growth hormone (GH) release. One
methodologically rigorous Japanese study reported nine-fold and sixteen-fold
increases in growth hormone 30 and 60 minutes respectively after intravenous
administration of 2.5 grams of GHB in six healthy men between the ages of
twenty-five and forty [Takahara, 1977]. GH levels were still seven-fold
higher at 120 minutes.
        The mechanism by which GHB stimulates growth-hormone release is not
known. Dopamine activity in the hypothalamus is known to stimulate pituitary
release of growth hormone, but GHB inhibits dopamine release at the same time
that it stimulates GH release. This suggests that GHB's GH-releasing effect
takes place through an entirely different mechanism [Takahara, 1977].
        At the same time GH is being released, prolactin levels also rise.
Serum prolactin levels increase in a similar time-dependent manner as GH,
peaking at five-fold above baseline at 60 minutes [Takahara, 1977]. This
effect, unlike the release of GH, is entirely consistent with GHB's inhibition
of dopamine. Other compounds which lessen dopamine activity in the brain (such
as the neuroleptic Thorazine) have been shown to result in prolactin release.
Although prolactin tends to counteract many of the beneficial effects of GH,
the sixteen-fold increases in GH probably overwhelm the five-fold increases in
prolactin.
        GHB induces "remarkable hypotonia" (muscle relaxation) [Vickers,
1969]. It is now gaining popularity in France and Italy as an aid to
childbirth. GHB causes "spectacular action on the dilation of the cervix,"
decreased anxiety, greater intensity and frequency of uterine contractions,
increased sensitivity to oxytocic drugs (used to induce contractions),
preservation of reflexes, a lack of respiratory depression in the fetus, and
protection against fetal cardiac anoxia (especially in cases where the
umbilical cord wraps around the fetus' neck) [Vickers, 1969; Laborit, 1964].
        GHB is completely metabolized into carbon dioxide and water, leaving
absolutely no residue of toxic metabolites [Vickers, 1969; Laborit, 1972].
Metabolism is so efficient that GHB can no longer be detected in urine four
to five hours after it is taken by injection [Laborit, 1964].
        GHB activates a metabolic process known as the "pentose pathway" which
plays an important role in the synthesis of protein within the body [Laborit,
1972]. It also causes a "protein sparing" effect [Laborit, 1964] which reduces
the rate at which the body breaks down its own proteins. These properties,
along with GHB's effect on growth hormone, underlie its common use as an aid
to muscle-building and fat loss.
        Anesthetic (large) doses of GHB are accompanied by a small increase in
blood sugar levels, and a significant decrease in cholesterol. Respiration
becomes slower and deeper. Blood pressure may rise or fall slightly, or remain
stable, but a moderate bradycardia (slowing of the heart) is consistent
[Vickers, 1969; Laborit, 1964]. A slight drop in body temperature also occurs
[Laborit, 1964].
        GHB also stimulates the release of acetylcholine in the brain
[Gallimberti, 1989].

        --- GHB and Sleep ---

        GHB has been called "almost an ideal sleep inducing substance" [SMART
DRUGS II, p245]. Small doses produce relaxation, tranquility and drowsiness
which make it extremely easy to fall asleep naturally. Higher doses increase
the drowsiness effect and decrease the time it takes to fall asleep. A
sufficiently large dose of GHB will induce sudden sleep within five to ten
minutes [Laborit, 1964].
        Many other hypnotics interfere with various stages of the sleep cycle
thus preventing the body from achieving a complete and balanced session of
rest and recuperation. The most remarkable facet of GHB-induced sleep is its
physiological resemblance to normal sleep. For instance, GHB sleep is
characterized by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the arteries, as in
normal sleep [Vickers, 1969]. During normal and GHB sleep, the CNS continues
to be responsive to "noxious stimuli" (pain and other irritations), a factor
which sets limits on GHB's uses in anesthesia [Vickers, 1969]. GHB facilitates
both REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and "slow-wave" (non-REM) sleep, the
stage of sleep featuring increased release of growth hormone [Laborit, 1972].
And unlike the unconsciousness induced by other anesthetics, that triggered by
GHB does not feature a systemic decrease in oxygen consumption [Laborit,
1964].
        The primary disadvantage to GHB's use as a sleep aid is it's
short-term influence--about three hours. During GHB's influence, sleep is
deeper and more restful, but after the GHB has worn off, people have a
tendency to wake up. The higher the dose, the greater is this tendency. Some
have called this pattern the "dawn effect" and have speculated that it is
related to the release of stored-up dopamine. Some people minimize this effect
by taking minimal doses of GHB. Others take advantage of this effect by
getting a couple of hours of work done in the middle of the night. Still
others choose to take a second dose of GHB to sleep for another three hours.
        It should be noted that not everyone can be put to sleep by GHB. We
have spoken to three men who have never achieved sleep even with the doses
normally used for such purposes. In addition, Takahara [1977] reported that
one of the six men in the growth hormone study cited above remained conscious
even though he had received two and a half grams of GHB intravenously, a
dosage which rendered the rest of the participants unconscious.

        --- GHB, Alcohol and Alcoholism ---

        GHB shows great promise in the treatment of alcoholism. In Europe,
one of its primary uses is to relieve withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and
anxiety among alcoholics.
        In laboratory rats addicted to alcohol, withdrawal symptoms closely
resemble those exhibited by humans, including tremors, convulsions, and
hypersensitivity to sound. All of these symptoms were blocked by sufficiently
high doses of GHB [Fadda, 1989]. Administration of GHB has also been found to
prevent alcohol consumption among rats that voluntarily ingest alcohol
[Fadda, 1989; Gallimberti, 1989].
        In a rigorous, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted of
human alcoholics, "nearly all withdrawal symptoms disappeared within two to
seven hours" after administration of GHB. On a severe-moderate-mild-or-none
scale, withdrawal symptoms remained below moderate during the entire period.
The only side effect observed was slight, occasional, and transient dizziness.
The researchers concluded, "the results clearly indicated that GHB is
effective for the suppression of withdrawal symptoms in alcoholics"
[Gallimberti, 1989].

Part 2 of 2

        --- Other Uses of GHB ---

        GHB has a decades long track record of use as a general anesthetic.
Administered intravenously, an anesthetic dose of GHB is in the range of 4-5
grams for a 150-pound person [Vickers, 1969]. Its advantages as an anesthetic
include low toxicity, relatively few contraindications, slowing of the heart
rate without loss of blood pressure, the absence of irritation to the veins
with intravenous administration, muscle relaxation, absence of respiratory
depression (usually), reduction of body temperature (hypothermia), and various
protective and anti-shock actions [Laborit, 1964]. However, GHB can almost
never be used in anesthesia without the additional administration of other
drugs [Vickers, 1969] because it does not produce complete surgical anesthesia
except in children [Laborit, 1964]. The autonomic nervous system remains
active during GHB-induced anesthetic coma, and thus the body continues to
respond to surgical stimuli through increases in heart rate, blood pressure,
and cardiac output, as well as through sweating, peripheral vasoconstriction,
vocalization, and reflex muscle action [Vickers, 1969]. Local anesthetics or
other drugs which suppress these responses must therefore also be used, like
the way a dentist or orthodontic surgeon might use Novocaine to kill pain
along with nitrous oxide to render a patient unconscious.
        It is suspected that part of GHB's protective function involves a
slowing of the metabolism of brain cells, thus reducing their requirements for
oxygen and glucose [Chin and Kreutzer, 1992; Artru, 1980]. Another factor in
GHB's anti-shock capability may be the marked vasodilation induced in the
liver and kidney, thus increasing blood flow to those vital organs.
        GHB's efficacy for treating anxiety has been positively demonstrated
in tests involving schizophrenic subjects [Laborit, 1964]. Its sedative
properties have earned it a role as a psychotherapeutic adjunct [Vickers,
1969]. It has also been used to assist the process of "abreaction," or the
release (usually through verbalization) of repressed emotion [Vickers, 1969].
Unlike other "anxiolytic" (or anti-anxiety) drugs, GHB's effect is non-toxic.
Furthermore, GHB's reduction of inhibitions, its tendency to encourage
verbalization, and the typical lack of fear during the GHB experience would
seem to provide an ideal context for the verbal exploration of difficult
emotional territory during therapy.

        --- GHB and Sex ---

        Scientists and doctors have traditionally been reluctant to ascribe
aphrodisiac properties to any substance, although this tendency may have
abated somewhat in recent years. It is a testament, then, to the power the
GHB's sexual effects that they were clearly acknowledged in the scientific
literature by 1972. Dr. Laborit wrote:

      "A last point should still be mentioned: the [GHB] action on Man
       which could be called 'aphrodisiac.' We cannot present any animal
       experiments on this subject. However, the oral form has now been
       sufficiently used so that, as generally agreed, no doubt can
       subsist as to its existence."

We have identified four main prosexual properties:
        1) disinhibition,
        2) heightening of the sense of touch (tactility),
        3) enhancement of male erectile capacity, and
        4) increased intensity of orgasm.

        Perhaps the foremost prosexual property of GHB is disinhibition. Some
users suggest that GHB's other sexual benefits are secondary effects, made
possible (or at least amplified) by this loosening of psychosomatic
constraint. A number of people have commented that this disinhibition is
particularly marked among women.
        Women often report that GHB makes their orgasms longer and more
intense, as well as more difficult or time-consuming to achieve, especially at
higher doses. As with its other effects, GHB's impact on female orgasm seems
highly sensitive to small adjustments in dosage.

        --- Legal Status and Availability ---

        GHB is not approved in the US and has been banned from
over-the-counter sale by the FDA. GHB has not yet been "scheduled" as a
"controlled substance" by the DEA, and therefore simple possession is not
illegal. GHB continues to be sold to legitimate laboratories and scientists
for research purposes, but selling it specifically for human consumption,
especially while making claims about its health benefits, is a violation of
current FDA regulations and policy.
        In some European countries, GHB is an approved drug available by
prescription. Local doctors, pharmacists and government bureaucrats should be
able to provide country-by-country specifics.
        GHB is growing in popularity and seems to be widely available in the
underground "gray market." Since most of the GHB available through such
channels is of the "bootleg" variety, manufactured by nonprofessional
"kitchen" chemists, concerns about quality and purity should be kept in mind.
Caveat emptor (buyer beware)!

        --- Safety Issues ---

        As has been emphasized, the overall safety of GHB is well-established,
and no deaths attributable to GHB have been reported over the thirty year
period that this compound has been in use [Vickers, 1969; Chin and Kreutzer,
1992]. In fact, as of 1990, only forty-six adverse reactions had been reported
in the United States surely constituting only an infinitesimal fraction of
actual usage, all followed by rapid and complete recovery [Chin and Kreutzer,
1992]. Unlike a large proportion of other drugs including alcohol and even
Tylenol, GHB has no toxic effects on the liver, kidney or other organs
[Vickers, 1969; Chin and Kreutzer, 1992]. One program of sleep therapy using
six to eight grams daily for a period of eight to ten days produced no side
effects. Vickers [1969] even reports that doses as high as twenty to thirty
grams per twenty-four hour period have been used for several days without
negative consequences (don't do this at home kids!). In the Canadian studies
of narcolepsy mentioned earlier, the nightly use of two to six teaspoons (one
teaspoon equaling roughly 2.5 grams) for several years resulted in no reports
of long-term adverse effects, or problems with issues of addiction or
dependence. In one of these studies, one patient inadvertently ingested
fifteen teaspoons without adverse consequence "other than deep sedation and
headache the next day" [Chin and Kreutzer, 1992]. And in France,
sub-anesthetic oral doses were used by "a large number of patients for about
six years" without untoward effect [Laborit, 1972].

        --- Side Effects ---

        According to Dr. Gallimberti [1989], the action of GHB is "without
serious side effects." Some research programs have reported no side effects at
all. Nonetheless, it's clear that some minor side effects can occur. Those
most commonly experienced are drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, and sometimes
vomiting. As a sedative-hypnotic, GHB's effects bear some similarity to those
of alcohol and tranquilizers. GHB not only "may cause drowsiness" like these
other drugs, IT WILL ALMOST INVARIABLY DO SO. Ataxia, or incoordination, can
also be a side effect of GHB. DO NOT DRIVE A VEHICLE OR OPERATE DANGEROUS
MACHINERY WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GHB.
        As mentioned, clonic movements (muscle contractions or "seizures")
have been observed during the onset of GHB-induced sleep. Headache is
sometimes reported. A moderate slowing of the heart rate is a consistent
effect, and small changes in blood pressure can take place. Likewise,
orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure caused by standing up
quickly) has also been reported. Sometimes this is experienced as brief
dizziness, and rarely people can briefly lose consciousness. At very high
doses, cardiac and respiratory depression can occur.
        Sufficiently large doses of GHB can cause sudden sedation and loss of
consciousness. Do not take such doses except when reclining on a bed or sofa.
It is also a bad idea to take such doses in the presence of people who don't
know anything about GHB. You may alarm your family or friends and wake up in
an emergency room (with a large medical bill).
        More unusual and extreme reactions have included diarrhea, lack of
bladder control, temporary amnesia, and sleepwalking. Whatever side effects
may be noted, they are often much more severe when GHB is combined with other
central nervous system depressants [Chin and Kreutzer, 1992, Gallimberti,
1989; Takahara, 1977; Vickers, 1969].

        --- Contraindications ---

        Although contraindications for GHB have been described as "remarkably
few" [Vickers, 1969], those who suffer from any of the following conditions
should not use GHB: severe illness of any kind, epilepsy, eclampsia
(convulsions), bradycardia (slowed heart-beat) due to conduction problems
[left-bundle-branch-block is an example of conduction difficulty], Cushing's
syndrome, severe cardiovascular disease, hyperprolactinemia, and severe
hypertension [Gallimberti, 1989; Vickers, 1969].
        Severe alcoholism is sometimes mentioned as a contraindication for GHB
[SMART DRUGS II, p244] even though GHB has been used quite successfully in
the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. The explanation for this seeming
contradiction probably lies in the likelihood that severe alcoholics may
combine GHB with alcohol.
        GHB should not be used with benzodiazepines ("minor tranquilizers"
such as Valium and Xanax), phenothiazines ("major tranquilizers" like
Thorazine and Stellazine), various painkillers (barbiturates and opiates),
alcohol, anticonvulsants (Dilantin and phenobarbital) and even many
over-the-counter allergy and sleep remedies--without direct medical
supervision.

        --- Dosage ---

        Determining the ideal dose is probably the trickiest aspect of working
with GHB. The amount required for a given level of effect will vary from
person to person, and the dose-response curve is fairly steep. Overestimating
the dose can have consequences ranging in seriousness from ruining your plans
for the evening to waking up in the emergency ward as a result of panic on the
part of concerned-but-uninformed friends or relatives.
        Once you have found the levels that give you the effects you desire,
they will remain consistent. Tolerance to GHB does not develop. However,
recent (not current) alcohol consumption may decrease the effect of a given
dose of GHB [Fadda, 1989].
        Most people find that a dose in the range of 0.75-1.5 grams is
suitable for prosexual purposes, and that a quantity in the range of 2.5 grams
is sufficient to force sleep.
        Some people think that GHB might lower potassium levels and should
therefore be taken with potassium supplementation. Some research papers have
identified such an effect, others have not. If you want to play it safe, take
a potassium supplement equal to 10% of the GHB dose.

Many Americans first heard of GHB through a widespread rumor that actor
River Phoenix's death was caused by a GHB overdose. This rumor was started by
club-goers, exaggerated by reporters, confused by DEA agents, and rejected
by the subsequent coroner's report. NEWSWEEK called GHB "an obscure and
dangerous steroid substitute," but perhaps the most egregious purveyors of
misinformation were DEA field agents who informed reporters that GHB's slang
name was "Great Bodily Harm," a designer drug with a less-than-benign
reputation on the streets of Los Angeles. The press took it hook, line and
sinker, failing even to recognize that the three-letter acronym G-B-H was a
scrambled version of G-H-B. The DEA's attempt at misinformation was a
brilliant attempt to scare the American people and support the FDA's
questionable ban of GHB. Although it worked on the mass media, it boomeranged
in the clubs. Said one New York nightclub patron, "I'd never heard of GHB
before. No one in New York had. This month it's the only drug" [Rogers,
1993].

Please, people, let's not go spreading information around unless it's
confirmed and traceable to a reliable source.  We don't want anyone to get
hurt because they did something that Joe Raver heard from a friend that it
was OK to do, right?
Yeah, Eric P. learned his lesson about this...
Find some text to read.  Then find some more from another source.  Talk to
people who have first-hand experience with whatever you're interested in.

I can assure you of at least ONE thing about this.....
Being famious and finding work as a result of it,  is a pipedream.   It
will normally
NEVER happen.    Potentual employers will always shun publicity or anyone
who might
generate publicity.   I'm speaking from hard cold experience.

That word has gotten so much attention among the Australian ravers mailing
list that the joke now is that of that "C" word is ever mentioned whenever
they get together,  they have to pay into a "Cuss box"...   Just some
useless information for one to chew on...

But that would kinda depend on what you're famous for, right? :)

>-They're still looking for more "charactors" to fill the wharehouse.  If 
you know of anyone, just add em to the list......

An LSD scarfing New Age spiritualist who meditates, burns incense, and has a 
wide assortment of crystals for every situation.  She has spoken with aliens 
and channels for Elvis.  Owns an very obese cat named "Jerry Garcia".

A computer hacker.  A nice guy, but we rarely see him since he immediately 
locks himself in the smallest bedroom and isn't seen since except to meet 
the Domino's pizza guy at the front door.  The clicking of the keyboard and 
the occasional maniacal laugh are the only evidence that the smell seeping 
past the door is not that of a decaying body.

A rastafarian (sp?).  Long dreads, questionable hygiene.  When he's not 
high, he's quoting Malcolm X.  When he is high he occasionally DJs, throwing 
down jungle and heavy beat ambient.  Has a tattoo he's horribly ashamed of, 
and several segments are given over to trying to discover what it is and 
what body part it's located on.

A right-wing extremist, Religious Right espousing Republican.  This is the 
token adult, the only person every put on "The Real World" that was over 30. 
 He jogs in designer sweats and a headband, loves red meat, and listens to 
Pat Boone when he's alone.  He's divorced and is always trying to bed the 
19- and 20-year old ladies in the house.

A Japanese exchange student who's deeply into asian heavy metal bands.  He 
has long hair, wears 80's rocker torn-up skin tight clothes and bandannas 
tied to various parts of his body, and he plays the electric tamborine.  
Owns a chihauhua named "Kato".  Hates rave music.

A hard trance/punk/industrial loving curmudgeon who foams at the mouth 
anytime a hint of religion is mentioned.  Highly opinionated even in the 
absence of logic.  Growls occasional elitist comments about "Real Ravers".  
His goldfish, "Satan", dies two days after arriving, but is left to float in 
the bowl throughout the show.  Teases and tortures Kato mercilessly when the 
Japanese exchange student isn't around.

A vegetarian environmentalist.  Constantly sorting through the garbage 
picking out the recyclables and nagging everyone to boycott this company 
because their products are made by farmers that clear-cut rain forests or 
that company because they print the directions to their product on 
non-recycled paper.  Complains loudly about the nauseating smell of "burnt 
flesh" anytime anyone cooks meat.  This character disappears suddenly 
half-way through the show -- foul play is suspected.

The clean cut, fresh scrubbed, college student.  Doesn't have a major yet, 
just fulfilling GE requirements.  Believes the hype about herbal products 
being safe.  Also believes illegal immigrants are destroying the American 
education system.  Demeans anyone taking "drugs", but chokes down Herbal E 
like it's popcorn.

A lesbian garbage collector.  Usually silent, but when she speaks it's often 
a single sentence so profound that everyone else is silent for a full minute 
pondering her words.  Collects pictures of Adrian Barbeau.

The clubgirl e-freak.  Everyone suspects she occasionally sleeps with the 
slimey X dealer, but she denies it emphatically.  Always primped and glossy, 
lot's of attitude.

How's that?  Am I bored or what?

S

I'm going to try to drop by the BBQ & Beats gathering on Saturday...from
there the Cloud Factory party looks good, although I may stay in the city
to catch DJ Spooky.

I updated the phone list on the sfraves web site so it's a little more
up to date.  Someday I'll get it automated...

Crunch burned by Fame,

I've never turned down an interview and I wrangle my way into
one every chance I get.  It's good for your career - PLUS your
Mom will get *really* happy.

What DJ out there would turn down some spotlight piece in a 
music magazine?  How about CNN featuring your startup?  Or UPI tracking 
you down in your hotel ... you wouldn't call back?  Bullshit.
Everyone would.  

It hasn't hurt the hardkiss boys.  They certainly seem to 
live large, for sf I suppose.  Or wicked tours.  Fame helps
them do that.  Don't ya think pacific's sunset notoriety has
helped that crew get paid for other dj jobs?

I just have one thing to add:  RuPaul

Hey, all!

        I'm curious to find out if there are any astrological signs that
are most common among ravers.  John Kawamoto and I are discovering that
there are quite a few fellow Scorpios among us.  Who all out there knows
your sign of the Zodiac?  Maybe I'll make a list and post it after the
results are in.

A Scorp in almost every way... ;)

GHB is a product used by bodybuilders. It's some sort of hormone or amino
acid. I don't think that it's legal for sale in CA. but I'm sure you can get
it if you really wanted it from a gym.
    I tried it once. It was semi-transluscent, it had the taste of baking
soda toothpaste. It wasn't bad and it really had no effect on me at all. My
sister told me about when her and her friends tried it at someones house and
everyone was walking leaning against walls, and they were always sitting
with their head tilted to the side. Sounds interesting enough.
    I wouldn't try it too often because anything your body uses (eg: amino
acids, hormones, proteins) can have the opposite efffect if used too often.
Like taking hormones, sooner or later your natural homones will decrease
even more (don't quote me on this) as the unnatural ones provide for the
body. Anything has it's side effects, but products your body regularly uses
tend to stay in your system a bit longer.
    Correct me if I'm wrong.

How about that damn tall skinny guy who constantly blows his whistle ?

Or what about the "natural" ravers with the armpit hair (more than me) that
only eat stuff that grows in the jungle and wear clothes they made
themselves from the leaves of their pot plants ?

The guy with the glow sticks?

The guy with the mask that dances really good then later leaves, takes off
his mask, and comes back to dance inconspicuously among the crowd ?

The "Acid" guy that constantly does the ROBOT ?

That funky guy who gets all wasted on drugs, then dopes at the chicks all
night ?

The flyer people ?

Me?

I'll probably write more on this another time but::

     Do not take someone who gets drunk for fun.
     Do not bring someone who has anything against: gays, men in womens
clothing, people who are diffirent, or people who do drugs.
     Do not bring someone that has to bitch about everything (you'll thank
me for this).
     Do not bring someone looking to get laid.
     Do not bring someone who usually doesn't do anything ever and always
just sits at home wondering what to do when there's tons of things that they
wouldn't do anyway.
     Do not bring a violent person.
     Do not bring a person with any respiratory problems.
     Don't bring a clean freak.
     
     Do bring the opposite of the above.
     Do bring loveable, kind, sharing people.
     Do bring someone who could have a good time dancing, or watching people
dance, or meeting people.

Hmm.. Me might have. The last time I saw him was six months
ago, at which time he was still living in SF. Anyone else
know? Anyone else care?

Actually, I think the bbq is definitely a good place to start, especially in 
particular for people on this list.  Sometimes you run across a newbie who you 
feel is ready for the full-blow nighttime rave experience, but a lot of times 
they may be a little leary of something like cuz it's so totally completely 
different from what they're used to.  So a party like the bbq is good, cuz 
it's a daytime thing, they can see everybody they meet, they can hang out & 
eat barbecue, listen to the music, and have conversations with the people they 
meet while still hearing the music, experiencing good vibe, & seeing a 
rave-like setup.  And I think it's particularly good for people on this list 
because there will just be a ton of people that we all know & can introduce 
our respective newbies to since there will be lotsa sfravers there.  I am 
bringing several newbies actually, ones who expressed real reluctance to come 
to a nighttime rave ("aren't those parties too wild??" "I dunno, I'm just too 
old for that!"), and I think this will give them a more comfortable approach 
to the scene that will make them more comfortable with trying full-blowns in 
the future, cuz they will now know some of the people they'll run into there, 
it will be a little more familiar.  or so it seems to me!

Love,
Shawna

I dunno about astrological signs, but I'm getting less & less surprised to hear 
any given person tell me they were born on September 21st (my birthday)!  I 
can't tell if this influx of 9/21'ers is significant, or if our parents were all 
just partying down New Year's Eve x-number of years ago... ;)

they are vegetarian beans!)

No, he definitely still lives here, I coincidentally ended up at his house 
yesterday, a friend of mine is staying there while visiting SF.  He 
mentioned that he was a dj, and the named sounded vaguely familiar to me, so 
I thought I'd ask to see if anybody here knew of him.  Whoever it was who 
said he was an east coast dj was right, he currently (ironically) only 
really plays east coast/mid-west gigs, he hasn't really done much here.  
Those of you who remember him djing here, that was when he was living on the 
east coast, so now that he lives here, he only dj's on the east coast!  
Sounds like he musta been big on the east coast, someone said he was 
headlining 2000 person parties over there, he musta been somethin else! :)  
He really was an awesome guy, had a lot to say, hopefully he'll start 
spinning here, I'd like to hear that.  Especially since if he's an east 
coast dj, he probably does some good hard stuff! :)

Shawna

> Don't a lot of fire departments host free cpr, and medical training courses
> for people?

	Well, the courses that EarthBound runs cover a little more than 
basic first aid and cpr. Granted, these are valuable skills, but basic 
first aid is not meant to help someone in a situation where EMS is more 
than 15 minutes or so away. The EarthBound courses are geared toward 
providing one with not only the knowledge to handle all types of 
accidents, but to also train people to NOT panic when their skills are 
required and this is something you will not get at the Red Cross. 
Depending on the course, they teach you how to deal with a situation when 
you don't have the gear that most people take for granted (like sterile 
pads for wounds, or ice packs for sprains). Medicial assistance is 
something a lot of people take for granted, and when we are going out 
where you cannot count on an ambulance getting there soon, some people 
need to know how to handle these situations. Otherwise, everybody should 
know that when you go to an outdoor event in the middle of no where, you 
are more or less on your own if you get cut, or wet and cold, or sprain 
an ankle on the wobbly dancing terrain.
	One last note, to be slightly optimistic. When the Hayward fault 
decides to move. The whole East Bay is going to become the middle of no 
where... A quick fix to the population problem we are experiencing.

Dear All;

        How bout that dude from White Zombie; OD's on dope, dies, and then
is resuscitated back to life. Wow, it was a really stupid thing for him to
do, but gee; I can't stop thinking about how much this little episode will
help his and the band's career. Think about it, now he can really claim to
be ..... undead.

Peace

I need a recommendation for an internet service provider in San
Francisco.. should be very close to a backbone and totally reliable. 
Basically just need unlimited SLIP/PPP dialup access at 28.8 for a flat
monthly rate.  I'll be doing a lot of work on this connection so the speed
and reliability are key.

Thanks!

i've noticed that best.com is popular... does anyone have their phone
number?  I need to get this cranked up tomorrow (friday).  

also, since i'm asking advice, I need to purchase a fast pentium box
decked out with a bunch of toys TOMORROW and be able to pick it up by
saturday.  does anyone have any suggestions for an inexpensive place to do
this near san francisco?  i don't have a computer shopper handy and really
don't have time to shop around much -- this came up kind of suddenly.

thanks again!

great point.  DJing is something that I spend countless hours working on (as
well as most DJs that I know), honing my skills, knowing each record beat
for beat, etc.  With all that time and energy spent on that side of it, I
shouldn't be expected to make my own parties so that people can hear me.  I
do agree, I should have to promote myself as all DJ's do.  

>Often times (but not always) the music does get stale, because the
>same DJ's are always hanging out and playing together in the same context.

Not only that but I feel that some areas are not open to new sounds such as
jungle, gabber, etc.  S.F. is somewhat open to new sounds, but I feel that
progressive house/deep house and trance are becoming the norm at alot of
parties and people are just coming to accept it as what should be heard. 

just my $.02

Well I finaly got through all 400+ messages that I had.  That's what I 
get for getting a job and not having time to check my messages.  I'm 
really happy with my job.  My offical title is software quality 
assurance, so ya, I'm a game tester.  The jobs pretty cool so far, but 
there is one problem, they want me to work on weekends and late at 
night.  They told me this in advance and I really wanted the job, so I 
accepted the terms.  But this means that I might not be able to rave 
anymore (at least not as much as I would like). :(  But I have hope that 
I will be able to ballance my social life, my girl friend, my other 
friends, and my job, only if I know how.  Boy, isn't life weard 
sometimes, just when everything is great, a slight perspective change 
ruins every thing.  Maybe I'm just upset that I might have to be missing 
all of the great parties coming up. WAIT, HOLD ON, SMACK, SMACK, OK I'm 
all better now.  Happy Matt, happy Matt, happy Matt.  Life is good, I not 
hungry, I'm not sick, I have people that love.  Now I'm back on the right 
track.  Love ya all and hopefully I will see this week (BBQ) or next 
(FnF) week.

Hey all

Jeez I'm posting a lot today, guess I've got nothing better to do with 
my time than hang out with you miserable losers! ;)

Anyway, I've just recently gotten into jungle and was wondering if 
anybody could recommend a good jungle mixtape that would be worth 
picking up & checking out.  I currently have Andrew Rawnsley's tape (I 
think it's called In The Zone), and I like it fine, but am interested 
in checking out stuff further.  

Thanks!

Love,

  Dante was one of the originators of the NYC rave scene.  One of the first
big-time raves he threw in Brooklyn in Dec'92, Revelation, was amazing 
until the cops shut it down at 5 in the morning.  He was one of the 
big-name dj's of the scene back then.  Spinning up and down the coast in 
92-93.  His set at this one afterhour party in DC (Andromeda in March 
'93) was the best trance set i have EVER heard.  
  from what i understand the reason he doesnt play out here is that he
does not have the desire to go through all the grind to get gigs out here.
people still remember him from the east coast so he gets asked to play out
there all the time, and gets paid the big $$ also for it.
  if you can ever get a chance to hear dante spin, it is definately worth
the experience.

Hey all,

  so is anyone going to Eon II Eon this weekend??  I would strongly 
recommend it.  Scott Henry, Baltimore-DC's premire DJ will be spinning
at this party, his first time in San Francisco.  Its been two years since
i have heard scott spin and i am definately looking forward to it.
  There is a message for Scott going around that he wants all the 
transplant east-coast ravers to be up front while he is spinning to 
help him feel at home out here, so dont dissapoint!! =)
  the rest of the line-up (Terry Mullan, Onionz, Tyree Cooper) ant 
that bad either, sooo....should be a fun night!!!
  see ya on the dance floor!!!

Hey everyone!!!!!

I hope you're all going to pass by the Beats & BBQ 2 on Satuday!

I'll be there with a new batch of new and improved double-sided
SFRaves laminates. I'll probably have a bunch around my neck so just
look for that. Also, sorry but I have to ask for a buck ($1) for them 
since they cost a lot more to make than the previous ones. If you can't 
make it to the BBQ then snail mail me and I'll send you one.

Grill it up Knucklehead! My mouth is watering like one of Pavlov's 
doggies!!

PLUR,

Terry

Hi-
I'm scheduled to play at the BBQ & Beats party on Saturday, but I need to 
get a ride there.  would anyone out there be willing to give me a ride to 
the location from Berkeley?  I'd be willing to exchange really bizarre 
stories of fame & fortune(and fluffy) for transport.  Please reply to my 
email address at work."lukejl@aol.com"  thanks!

My wife's out of twon with my son, so I'm here alone with my 2 year old
daughter and thought it might be difficult to spin under those
circumstances.

Hello all,

        Every day brings something new.  Today I realize that my heart is
breaking.  Sara is pulling away from me.  She says that the powers that be
in her life don't want us together, and that she has no choice but to
comply.  I will make a valiant effort to salvage our feelings, partly
because it was she who first pursued me, but if it doesn't work out, I
won't torture myself.
        If anyone would be so kind, I could really use some of that light
and love, and maybe a hug, if that's not asking too much.  Eric P. has his
down days, too :(

Love to you all (because I know YOU won't break my heart),

- E

	If it is, I will personally do everything in my power to make sure

	You know if they come, they will bring the whole vibe down...not to
	mention televise everything to make everything known for the DEA and
	whonot for the next one...

	 (sorry if this topic has already been talked about/beaten to
	 death...but hopefully all I have heard thus far about MTV being at
	 Burning Man is just an evil rumour...right? right?)

So who cares if they are there?  The whole event is suppose to be one
big performance on the participant's part.  So what if MTV wants to videotape
you?  Additionally, with over 10,000 people expected, I don't see how
one group of people recording some video could "bring the whole vibe down"

As far as the DEA is concerned, what are they going to videotape that
is so incriminating?  A bunch of crazy people?  

Look, there is going to be a whole lot of mainstream media at buringing man.
Find them and put on a show for them!  Be a media whore!  Chances are they
will be having just as much fun as you, and who knows, they might get
really into it and present the whole thing in a cool way that makes televison
watching youths across the nation say "Wow, that looks like a whole lot of
fun!!"

Instead of shunning the media, we have to accept it, control it, and use
it for our means.

Good day everyone,

Just want to tell everyone that I'm looking forward to going to the BBQ 
tomorrow.  I'm not sure anyone else is posting their descriptions, but since 
I've soooo many sfravers that I'd like to meet I'd thought that I'd describe 
what I'll be wearin. Look for me in a long printed vest and white pants with 
a smiley face sticker on my cheek:)  I've got many more to give out!  See you

Hey everyone....

I'm new to the Bay Area but I'm not all that new to SF-Raves (just quiet 
=) so I thought I'd take a second to introduce myself and ask a couple 
questions.....

I'm Andy Hawks, 22, I help build web sites at Eagle River Interactive in 
Mountain View....I just moved out here from Colorado where I've lived 
most of my life (Aurora, Denver, & Boulder)...I've been going to parties 
for about 5 years on-and-off, but consistently about every weekend the 
past two years...Recently I've been writing Denver scene reports for URB 
magazine (but no more!), and I also wrote some for Denver's local scene 
mag, RISE....I've been an active person on the Mountain-Raves list the 
past year, so, if you're on that list too you probably alreay know me -- 
I tend to blabber on a *lot* about parties and rave culture, especially 
the community, spirituality, and plur aspects of it all....So you can 
expect more of that from me now that I'm living near the center of it 
all....=)

I'm currently homeless, living in a hotel -- my girlfriend Jen and I are 
looking for a decent house for rent (2 or 3 bedrooms, $1500/month or 
less) in the south bay and east bay between Mountain View and Fremont -- 
so if anyone knows of anything or has any house-hunting tips, please let 
me know!! I'm sure some of you know how overwhelming relocating to this 
area can be!

Also a couple questions about the scene out here: obviously SF is huge, 
but what is there to do closer to San Jose?!?!? any clubs worth 
mentioning?!? or stores where I can pick up flyers?!? 

Thanks for any and all help, and I look forward to meeting a lot of you 
soon!

Have a good weekend, and peace and lur....

All,
	Picked up my copy on vinyl at Rasputins in San Leandro about two months
ago. Try them....if no results you can order it at Primal Records in Berkeley.
It is on the Emotive Label. The remix is the BOMB!!!

I have a tune in my head from BioJeffs Bass Analogs Vol. 2 tape that goes
something like this...
First off don't laugh, I'm bad about describing sounds without saying them.
...here goes the part in my head

we we we we we we  I ain't got no one we we we we
                                or
plee plee plee plee I ain't got no one plee plee


It's only part of it and when it goes we.....we.....we...we..we.we.we.we.we
(it build up and hits.(. we we we I ain't got no one..we we we



so know that you have a basic sound.  Can anyone tell me what song and
label that is,  it's driving me crazy I had to goto my truck and get the
tape. It's a bad song....I would ask BioJeff but it's kinda early to call.
So if you have it listen to it and it's past the halfway mark on I believe
side A...

They look like these monsters with their one eyed spotlights and stabalized

the only time.
but it was really scary.
Theyll prolly fit right it.
I'll just avoid watching the footage later.

All,

As usual, The Frying Dutchman seems to have the low-down but for those
wanting more info and personal experiences in a relatively controlled
experiment (I haven't checked out hyperreal's info yet), High Times'
250th issue (June '96) has an article written about this and other
`prosexual drugs'.  He mentions this as his favorite of them and
recommends _Better Sex Through Chemistry_ by John Morganthaler & Dan
Joy for even more info on the subject.

Hello everybody!

I hope everybody is having a great Friday.  I've been working on this web
page for my company for two days now, and I need to take a break.

My girlfriend and I are going to S.F. tomorrow (we got a babysitter), and
we'd like to stop by and meet some people.  So if I could get directions by
email it would be great.

Goodday,

Noah

Welcome Andy,

        I live in the San Jose area very close to San Jose State University.
There really isn't much to do here in San Jose as far as parties go.  The
police get a hard on every time they hear loud music.  A few months back
apple put on a rave/party here in San Jose.  Before midnight the cops had
busted it for some reason.  This seems to be the usual case in San Jose. 
        Clubs on the other hand suck because they are.... clubs.  There is a
club in downtown San Jose called "The Usual" (1St street). On Friday nights,
they have what's called soul'd out.  The crowd is pretty clubish but they
get some good djs and cool light effects.  If you don't feel like driving to
SF it can be a fun place.
        I would recommend just driving to SF every weekend though.  There is
a great scene, lots of plur and good people.  This saturday there is going
to be a great party in the monterey area, Cloud Factory 2-year anniversary.
It's about two hours away but it will be worth your trip.  If you ever need
a place to stay in San "HO"- town write.

Wolf

I have A question On the integerity of this promotion...

Saturday, July 27th - Theta presents _Lust for Life_
Ethan, Thomas Trouble, Biojeff, Jeremy (Portland), Alex, Mars,
Mystr-E, Shaggy (the original), Andrew, Mike, Moshe.
A benefit rave for the Burning Man Foundation

I belive the original flyer states that Dutch is spinning @ this event, and
now Ethan's out too???
10$ isn't a bad cover, but, which DJ's are actually CONFIRMED???


"Dance with me..."

Hello to all!

Well...I was unsubscribed for two weeks while I was on vacation and I come
back to find all these strange names.  Who are you all??!!  I also noticed
quite a few from aol.  What does this mean, I wonder?  Everyone have a nice
day and remember to floss ;) !!

on a totally non-rave note:  Does anyone else think "3rd Rock from the Sun"
is the funniest show to come to TV in a long time?

Later,
              Megan                Czefir

Hello all you beautiful sfravers, I know by posting this I'm going to seem
a little fucked up, proposing a party at the same time as the bbq + beats
party but if anyone at around 3 pm or maybe later would want to find
something to do and not waste 20$ on eon2eon, check out this FREE outdoor
goa party in mari, complete with good vibes, a creak to swim in, beautiful
surrounding woods, and killer trance + goa ringing in the trees :) ; I'm
begging some people to go because I desperately need a ride... : )

ps. also has killer lineup, I've heard cyril before and "il fait p=E9ter la
GOA" (in french)... It also says to bring tents and good vibes, sounds all
good...

sorry but due to the renegade style of our event we have pushed the start 
time back to midnight.  please be on your best behavior when coming to 
the site and if you get lost remember to call the voice mail. 

(note re: renegade style, we won't be doing anything illegal, like b&e, 
but we do not have permits and such for an outdoor gathering, just so you 
know, although we never have either =), and we do have several backup 
spots so we'll keep going all night long!  =)

          The toughest thing about vacuuming to ambient is letting the
          bongwater stains adequately presoak without falling asleep.
           The guess early Metallica (pre-Jason) was epic, and
          had some influence (at least an affirming one if not an
          originating one) on bands like Killing Joke and Nitzer Ebb,
          who IMHO had a profound effect on the music we now drive
          miles to go listen to.  Does anybody else here get a total
          woody for the other disk that comes with Orbital's In-Sides
          (the 5 song one)?  I played it for my students in class
          today during lunch and they all looked at me pretty funny,
          but i just love it...  I had to wake up at 6:00 today, and
          I've had about six cups of hand imported Costa Rican coffee
          fresh out of the airport this morning!!!!

          AIiiiEEEEEEE!!!!

          This weekend is going to kill me, but I'll be happy when I
          go.

Heya... I'll be at da bbq.. possibly a little late.  Look for me.  I'll be
wearing a white  *alien with a dr. Seuss hat* t-shirt, black pants, and
brown and blue Airwalks.  Plus, my SFraves laminate ;)

I think I'm going to that untitled party tonight.. Anyone else going?  I'm
sooooo glad it's the weekend!  There's so many events going on.. I don't
know what to choose!

PlUrrrrr,
Aaron.

Hearsay tells me the promoters are cool and respectable - Ethan's out
merely because F&F became viable after he'd told Theta he'd play. From my
understanding of the situation they knew he'd be out if F&F ended up
happening.

Dunno about Dutch.

just to check out the party...

hello all-

just wanted to greet you from my new computer (natasha) and richocet 
wireless modem (boris).
i'm sitting on a park bench in the middle of redwood city, marvelling at 
the fact that i send e-mail from here.
a person's joy should not come solely from material objects, but a 
kick-ass new laptop sure doesn't hurt!

just wanted to share my joy of playing with my new toy!!!

love-

Just to add my description in, since I haven't been around much for a

COAT.. I'm even bringing old-school sfraver Steve Lerner along, who is
back from Brazil now, just in time for F&F.  :)

See you all there!

Sigh...

Nobody offered to pick up a ticket for F&F for me this weekend. :(

I'm not going to be able to come up this weekend for the BBQ for financial
reasons, but I'd REALLY like to see all of you at F&F.  Could somebody,
anybody, please pick me up a ticket whilst they are at the barbeque?  I
would be eternally grateful, and might even make you a balloon animal or two.

If you can get one for me, please either leave me a message here
(reicja00@usfca.edu), or call me at (714) 846-6187.  I'll pay you back for
it as soon as I get up there.

Have some chicken at the BBQ for me,

Jake

        MTV WILL NOT BE AT BM THIS YEAR!!!

        I just got off the phone with Rolando Reece of MTV national
sales.  I asked Mr. Reece about buying time during MTVs coverage of BM.

        THERE IS NO COVERAGE.

        Reece says he looked over the schedule and MTV is instead
covering other concerts/events.  In fact Reece was really unaware of BM
at all.

        He did state that they MAY film a news clip there IF it is news
at that time (so there may be a 10 second blip on MTV News.)

        There will be no "MTV Beach House on the Playa".  The worse that
can happen is they send out a couple of camera guys to bug us.  Which
means of course it will be MUCH easier to make sure MTV doesn't snag any
footage.

        I repeat.  MTV WILL NOT BE AT BM!  This is from the horses mouth
at MTV.  I doubt they would steer me wrong when it came to selling air-time.

        Now about those Jesus Crispies....:)

Dante is just amazing..
 I have known him since 1991, and see him from time to time..
If anyone needs to get a hold of him, I could pass a message on to him.

sorry but due to the renegade style of our event we have pushed the start 
time back to midnight.  please be on your best behavior when coming to 
the site and if you get lost remember to call the voice mail. 

(note re: renegade style, we won't be doing anything illegal, like b&e, 
but we do not have permits and such for an outdoor gathering, just so you 
know, although we never have either =), and we do have several backup 
spots so we'll keep going all night long!  =)

Pac Bell will begin offering their Internet service next month. I think its
$14.50 for 10 hours and then something like $.50 per hour up to a maximum of
$19.50 for the month. I've got a beta account with Pac Bell and it seem to
be pretty fast. You can get more info at www.pacbell.com

Now what's so wiggy about that?  Hell, I've got email from Stang sitting

This is now the third year in a row I've heard this rumor.  Never figured 
out if it was true, but it didn't seem to make much difference either way.

I wouldn't stress about it.  MTV or no, there are plenty of other 
"straight" media (lots of metropolitan TV news organizations, for 
example) who will show up...take it as a compliment.  Maybe you'll 
inspire some MTV drone to get up and *do* something exciting instead of 
watching it on television.  In any case, Burning Man has already changed 
a lot from just a few years ago.  It's growing exponentially, literally, 
and that kind of growth is inevitably accompanied by change and, in some 
respects, dilution.  It's still a hell of a good time...just means you 
have to be sure to put all you can into it.  The one thing, it seems to 
me, that can guarantee that BM and events like it remain a vital 
experience is the spirit of participation and contribution.  Media 
exposure and growth in general do tend to temper this spirit and to 
foster observation and a lack of participation, but that's no reason for 
YOU to back down.

First, I'd just like to say it is rad to see people actually making an effort
to research the drugs they take.  It's a big responsibility, what with all
the factoids and just straight bullshit out there to wade through.  But with
all the new drugs these days that have not stood the test of time, it is most
important to get the latest info.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In light of some heavy media and law enforcement attention on the rave
scene, bunch of us on So-Cal Raves realized that it was time we centralize
and begin educating ourselves.

The end result (to this point) is a first draft of a handbook for
responsible raving that we are giving out at local events.  The 16 page
booklet is called "How Much Do You Love Raving?"

The basic angle of it is that our own selfishness, carelessness and
ignorance is keeping our movement from positive growth.  It outlines ways
to combat these obstacles and encourages people to begin communicating
about the importance of individual efforts in responsible raving.

Enclosed is a text-only version of this first draft.  I encouage each of
you to read it and learn from the mistakes we've made in Southern
California.  I also hope that you will in turn print out your own versions
of the information and pass it out to ravers in your communities.

It's time to innovate a more perfect future.

Please e-mail me if you have any questions or comments.


Thanks for your time,

Kc-of-DUNE

how much do you love raving?


a handbook for responsible raving


<page 1 BLANK>


<page 2>
The Goodvibe Starts from Within

Stop complaining
about everyone else.  What about yourself?
Are you treating others
the way you want to be treated?
That is the only route toward the
positivity that will unite us all.
Don't be afraid!
Fear is the source of all our conflicts and
aggressions.
The next time someone gives you a hard look,
understand that they are still captive
to their fears like you once were.
Don't resort to a negative response because that
will only create more  negativity.
Smile! Let the goodwill within you flow!
Maybe your strength and love will give them
the courage to open themselves,
and they will follow the new direction.
It is all up to you...
						-tito



<page 3>
This booklet is not intended to be definitive in its' approach...
it is a starting point for communication about very important
issues that directly affect each of us.

Our hope is that it will encourage you to step away
from the music with some friends for a moment so
that you can discuss the importance of individual
efforts in responsible raving.




Yeah?  So what's the problem?

It is becoming more and more difficult to continue our cultural
phenomenon known as the "Rave Movement." The reason
that raving is more difficult is because raves and even smaller
parties are being shut down by the police and other authorities
at an alarming rate.  Apart from DJs, sound and lights, in
order to throw a successful event you need secure locations,
permits/permission and insurance.  With any of these
ingredients missing there is a strong chance that the event will
not get off the ground.

In order to get these ingredients we must go to people outside
of the rave community... the public.


<page 4>
It is the public that formulates opinions about us as ravers.
Most times it is public opinion that keeps a landowner from
granting us on his property... that keeps an insurance
company from providing a necessary policy... that keeps civil
agencies from issuing a permit that makes an event legal and
"unbustable."

The police are not shutting us down because of a giant
conspiracy against ravers, raving and living life to its'
fullest...

They are shutting us down because of our own...

selfishness
carelessness
&
ignorance

If we rid ourselves of these anchors, our public image will
greatly improve and our fragile movement will surely
flourish.

How?  What can you do?  A lot!

YOU can make or break our movement!

<page 5>
It is incredibly easy to combat selfishness,
carelessness and ignorance and still have the time
of your life... maybe even have a better time than you've
ever experienced.  Imagine having the best time you've ever
had at a rave... now couple that with the feeling of
satisfaction and accomplishment that you would get from
helping build up and progress our scene... knowing that you
did your part.


*SELFISHNESS IS OVERCOME
BY RESPECT*

Each rave event is not yours alone... it is a communal
experience made for everyone.  It is the togetherness of
everyone that makes raves fun and fulfilling.  To completely
kill a group experience it only takes a few individuals who
don't understand the concept of community.  Here are some
examples of selfish acts.  Each is  followed by a way to
overcome the selfishness.

-RESPECTING  THE PUBLICS'' OPINION OF RAVERS-
Visibility of drugs and alcohol-
Drugs are taboo to most of the public that forms an opinion about us... the
same public that gives us permission to
gather and rave.  If you feel that you need to have your mood
elevated, please be discrete.  Don't let anyone see the presence of drugs.
Don't give them a reason to accuse us.  Nitrous
balloons are the biggest problem in this area.  Balloons can easily be seen
from a great distance and the hiss of the valves
makes it very easy to find the tanks.  PLEASE DON'T BRING BALLOONS OR
NITROUS TANKS INTO RAVES!   Similarly marijuana can easily be smelled.  It
is more difficult to find but don't make it obvious.

<page 6>
Being rude or obnoxious to non-ravers-
Rude and obnoxious behavior does nothing but upset people,
sometimes to the point of having them call the police.  Please
be polite to any "outsider" that you encounter while on the
way to or away from a rave.  Be polite to everyone for that
matter!

Noise-
Noise is a very big problem in most residential areas and is
often the reason for shut-downs.  Please be as quiet as
possible going to site.  Playing car radios loud, horn
honking, screeching tires and yelling can be louder than the
sound system enclosed in the venue.  Loitering around in the
parking area is illegal and only draws unwanted attention to
the party.  As you're walking to the door remember that you
are only moments away from being able to make as much
noise as you want!!

Fireworks-
Although cool to see, fireworks are a reason for instant shut-
downs. We all know about the danger of fires.  Enough said.
Additionally, the loud explosions can be misconstrued as
gun-shots which will get the police to the location faster than
anything.

Guns and Violence-
Neither of these belong at a rave.  It is our non-violent nature
that sets us apart... makes us better than than the rock and rap
scenes.  Hopefully, a positive rave experience will change the
life of a violent natured person.


<page 7>
-RESPECTING EVENT FACILITIES AND THE DESERT-

Parking-
Park only where it is permitted and, once again, don't hang
out in the parking lot or on the streets.  Don't throw trash and
flyers on the ground.  Keep as low a profile as possible.

Tagging-
We lose locations because of tagging more than anything else.
Tagging simply tells the landlord that we don't have any
respect for him or his property even though it is the landlord
that has been so kind to share his property with us.  Tagging
makes insurance rates climb. If you see someone tagging,
explain to them that they are keeping you from being able to
rave in L.A.  Ask them if they want to continue to rave...
then ask them to please stop.  Make sure everyone in the
area hears you so that they also become involved in making
the tagger stop.

Trash-
Many times the property owner is shocked by the trash left in
the facility, especially bathrooms.  It only takes a few seconds
to find a trash can... a very worthwhile investment of your
time.  Trash and especially flyers should NEVER be dropped
outdoors.  The wind can blow them away and where they will
never be found... except perhaps by a park ranger or other
authority figure.  It is very difficult to say  "that trash
was already there when we got here" when the trash is a
bunch of rave flyers.  Gum, candy and cig butts can be just as
incriminating.

<page 8>
-RESECT FOR OTHER RAVERS-

Aggression/Violence-
Part of the attraction of a rave is that it can be a place to escape the
craziness of the rest of the world.  Leave your personal problems at the
door...    don't bring them into the celebration. Alcohol often brings
about aggressive behavior as well.

The rave scene prides itself on its' peaceful nature so there is absolutely
no tolerance for violence or aggression.  This even includes any
frustration that you may have with security, entry lines, etc.

A peaceful but enthusiastic attitude can quickly spread to others creating
a pocket of "vibe" that everyone will want to be a part of.  Acceptance of
others, even those different from
you, catches on quickly and creates a bond among all of us.  When outsiders
look in at our scene and see this bond, they cannot discredit it... they
can only see something positive...
perhaps it will be something that they will discuss with others. This is
the easieast way that we can create a more positive public image!

Blatant Selfishness-
This not only kills "the vibe" but it breaks us apart, making it difficult
to band together to help our movement as a whole.  A prime example of this
is blatant nitrous usage.  People sucking on balloons must know that  they
are jeopardizing EVERYONE'S right to rave and yet they continue to do it.
Their short-term high becomes more important than the future of raving
itself.  This kind of selfishness will certainly kill our future.  PLEASE
DON'T BRING NITROUS TO RAVES... leave it at home where it won't be a
selfish act that discredits all of us.


<page 9>
*CARELESSNESS IS OVERCOME
THROUGH ACCOUNTABILITY*

Carelessness, which sometimes is accidental, can easily be
overcome through a system of accountability.  It only takes
two friends to commit to be accountable to each other in
reminding the other if they are being careless.  The more
people you have in your accountability group (also called
"true friends"), the less likely you are to do something
careless. Create an acountability group with the
friends you rave with the most.   Ask
someone to be accountable for you RIGHT
NOW!!!!

All you have to do is give a simple reminder.... speak up and
say, "I don't think it's such a good idea for you to do that."
Here are some places where carelessness becomes a problem
for each of us in the rave movement:

Forgetting about any of the above selfishness issues-
Go ahead... re-read them!

Driving safely-
There is nothing wrong with being too messed up or too tired
to drive home... unless of course you try to drive anyway.
Ask a more sober friend from your accountability group to
drive or wait until someone is able to drive.  Coffee and other
stimulants won''t do the trick..  Take your time so you
and your friends can rave again another day!
	
<page 10>
Dealing with the wrong people-
Who are the wrong people? Unscrupulous drug dealers are just as problematic as
undercover drug enforcement agents. If you think getting something "bunk"
is a problem.... think about how bad it would be if you bought something
poisonous or lethal! This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem as drug
manufacturers are finding cheaper ways to make money. Most of them aren't
chemists and don't bother testing their new batch... you may become a "test
subject" for an unknown substance.   The media and law enforcement agencies
are infiltrating our masses to collect information to use against us at a
later time. You can never know who is who... so be careful.  Know who
you're dealing with.

Loitering outside of the venue-
This only draws attention to the  event and makes police curious enough to
"investigate."  Loitering also makes it more difficult to patrol a parking
area to look for people breaking into cars or doing other selfish
activities that hurt individual ravers and hurt the scene overall.  When
you're walking through a parking lot and you see people standing around ask
them to please go inside... but explain to them why it is important for
them to help in this regard.

Acting safely/Acting responsibly-
This is a broad area that has too many specific "infractions." Every once
in a while just ask yourself (and the people you''re accountable for) these
questions...

What am I doing?
Am I directly/indirectly harming myself or other ravers?
Am I keeping someone else from having a great time?
Am I helping build a positive public image about the rave scene?

<page 11>
*IGNORANCE IS OVERCOME THROUGH
COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION*


Ignorance is the easiest problem to overcome but it also depends on
individual efforts..  All we need to do is educate ourselves.  But two
things must happen before we can educate each other.

First, we must be willing to be educated... we must recognized that we are
being stupid and want to change.

And secondly, we must communicate with each other.

Since we have no organized arena for ravers to come together and
communicate we are held in the dark.  We must find a centralized forum
where together we can learn from our past mistakes and innovate our future.
Until we find that forum, it is up to you to discuss these problems and
re-shape our future.

The existence of rave culture depends entirely on you to simply talk with
one another... to share all of these important issues with others... with
people you meet for the first time.

<page 12>
Know what you're talking about-
Rumors and misinformation are splitting us apart.  Know the facts about the
realreasons for "busts"... or the dangers of certain substances.  Don't let
yourself be used as a tool for a promoters personal gain... or mouthpiece
for fabricated drug hysteria.

Know what you're taking-
We've already discussed unscrupulous drug dealers.  Don't combine lots of
different drugs!  There are combinations of substances that can quickly
become lethal.  In fact, more drug related casualties are due to lethal
combinations of drugs and alcohol than overdosing!

Let the DJ do the mixing!

Know your limit-
Your accountability group can help you with this.  Be careful trying to
"bump" your dosage.  Always let someone know exactly how much of what your
taking BEFORE you take it.

Know the law-
Get to know the specific legalities of possessing controlled substances.
Know the consequences if you're busted and ask yourself if it is worth the
risk.

Know how to handle yourself with the police-
Be cooperative but also know your rights regarding search and seizure laws
(especially in searching a vehicle).  Avoid dragging down the rave scene
with you.  Don't even mention
raves if you have a run in with officers.  Be afraid of the seriousness of
the consequences but don't let yourself be intimidated to the point that
you incriminate yourself.


<page 13>
Know what to do in case of an emergency-
This is a very important area if we wish to police ourselves at raves.

In case of an overdose or other drug related medical trauma
follow these steps before calling an ambulance.

1)Move the victim to a safe, private and discrete area away
from the noise and everyone else.

2)Find out EVERYTHING that they took... including
dosage, combinations and alcohol.

3)Find the victims friends.

4)Don't panic.  Some drug related trauma can be relieved
simply through sleeping it off.

5)Find someone trustworthy and knowledgeable about those
substances and get their advice. (Like Medi-Rave!)

6)Do NOT administer CPR, induce vomiting, or other
first aid proceedures unless fully capable and qualified.

7)In the desert or in a hot venue, dehydration
could be the problem, so try drinking some water.

8)If necessary ask security to call for help or ambulance.


<page 14>
Know your promoters-
It's time that ravers determine how much an event is worth.
If you think you're getting ripped off or if a promoter is
constantly being busted... STOP SUPPORTING THOSE EVENTS!!!  Try to remember
that promoter's  other events.  Think about what the promoter promised for
those raves...

Bust-free? (which might not really possible anymore)
Carnival rides/visuals/multiple areas?
Free water/gifts/etc.?
Big name Djs/bands?

So what do you and your accountability group do if you're
not getting your money's worth?  All of you should:

-find and tell the promoter that you're not satisfied
-leave a message(s) on the voice mail
-don't go to that promoter''s events again
-write letters to local music magazines
-post to the internet rave related mail groups
-throw your own event... large or small!!!

Remember that many promoters throw raves for a living and
that they must make money.  We're not asking promoters to
lose money!  We're thankful that they go through all the
hassle to even HAVE an event to go to.  However, we ARE
asking promoters to re-invest into the scene.... after all... if
the scene doesn't survive, the promoters don't survive either.

Support promoters that are helping our movement flourish...
that are innovating with creative ideas...that deliver what they
promise... that re-invest in the scene... that respect ravers,
DJs, venues, officers, public opinion and Mother Earth!

<page 15>
The best way to combat ignorance is to get and stay informed.
All that is required of this is communication!  Call unbiased
info lines to get the "scoop" on upcoming events.  Read the
local magazines that report on rave culture.

Perhaps the BEST way to get informed is... if you know
someone with an internet connection... get online!  Subscribe
to So-Cal Raves or visit web sites like Dr. Freeclouds and
Hyperreal (see next page).

 The information  and feedback offered by online
communication can really benefit you as an individual raver
and will help the rave movement flourish overall.  Here's
what you can get from being informed through the net:

-A calendar of upcoming raves, clubs, after-hours and rave-related radio/TV
shows
-Help determine which promoters and events are worthwhile
-Find out about events that you may have missed
-Read other ravers'' opinions of events, DJs, music, and mix tapes
-Find out more about DJs or bands you like
-Voice your frustrations about specific rave related issues
-Get advanced info on location, line-up, changes, and mergers
-Get info on specific drug-related warnings or scams
-Learn more about rave/DJ culture

Sorry about the massive bandwidth consumption but this is important...

There's been a HUGE amount of response and questions from all over the
world on how to assemble these booklets.  Below is a basic description on
how to set up the text layout and assembly.  Enclosed is a revised version
of the text based on some of those comments.


If you follow the proceedure below, you can make a handy little booklet
that fits perfectly into your back pocket and doesn't end up on the floor.
We're making ours with flourescent paper to further entice people to keep
them and take 'em home to read.


HOW TO CONFIGURE THE TEXT BY PAGE NUMBER:
(3 sheets per booklet- front and back)

     Front         Back

*Page 18 is just a bunch of lines to write phone numbers of new raver friends!
**Page 16 is specific to the Southern California area only!!!



HOW TO ASSEMBLE THE BOOKLETS:

1)Layout the text with the corresponding page #s as above

2)After placing the text into quadrants on each page, photocopy them double
sided as indicated above (top to top)

3)If you've done everything correctly and accounted for some margin space,
you should be able to cut each page EXACTLY across the middle of the page
so that you end up with 5 horizontal half sheets of paper with printing on
front and back.

4)Arrange the half sheets in numerical order.

5)Fold the half sheet EXACTLY through the center so that it makes a booklet

6)Staple through the binding (you may need a long stapler!)

7)Pass them out to all the ravers you meet!



Feel free to costumize them as needed for your community...

Like the first paragraph says "This is booklet is not intended to be
definative in its' approach... it is a starting point for communication
about very important issues that directly affect each of us."


RESPECT+
ACCOUNTABILITY+
COMMUNICATION & EDUCATION=
RAVE ELATION FOREVER !

how much do you love raving?


a handbook for responsible raving


<P A G E  1 BLANK>


<P A G E  2>
The Goodvibe Starts from Within

Stop complaining
about everyone else.  What about yourself?
Are you treating others
the way you want to be treated?
That is the only route toward the
positivity that will unite us all.
Don't be afraid!
Fear is the source of all our conflicts and
aggressions.
The next time someone gives you a hard look,
understand that they are still captive
to their fears like you once were.
Don't resort to a negative response because that
will only create more  negativity.
Smile! Let the goodwill within you flow!
Maybe your strength and love will give them
the courage to open themselves,
and they will follow the new direction.
It is all up to you...
						-tito



<P A G E  3>
This booklet is not intended to be definitive in its' approach...
it is a starting point for communication about very important
issues that directly affect each of us.

Our hope is that it will encourage you to step away
from the music with some friends for a moment so
that you can discuss the importance of individual
efforts in responsible raving.




Yeah?  So what's the problem?

It is becoming more and more difficult to continue our cultural
phenomenon known as the "Rave Movement." The reason
that raving is more difficult is because raves and even smaller
parties are being shut down by the police and other authorities
at an alarming rate.  Apart from DJs, sound and lights, in
order to throw a successful event you need secure locations,
permits/permission and insurance.  With any of these
ingredients missing there is a strong chance that the event will
not get off the ground.

In order to get these ingredients we must go to people outside
of the rave community... the public.


<P A G E  4>
It is the public that formulates opinions about us as ravers.
Most times it is public opinion that keeps a landowner from
granting us on his property... that keeps an insurance
company from providing a necessary policy... that keeps civil
agencies from issuing a permit that makes an event legal and
"unbustable."

The police are not shutting us down because of a giant
conspiracy against ravers, raving and living life to its'
fullest...

They are shutting us down because of our own...

selfishness
carelessness
&
ignorance

If we rid ourselves of these anchors, our public image will
greatly improve and our fragile movement will surely
flourish.

How?  What can you do?  A lot!

YOU can make or break our movement!

<P A G E  5>
It is incredibly easy to combat selfishness,
carelessness and ignorance and still have the time
of your life... maybe even have a better time than you've
ever experienced.  Imagine having the best time you've ever
had at a rave... now couple that with the feeling of
satisfaction and accomplishment that you would get from
helping build up and progress our scene... knowing that you
did your part.


*SELFISHNESS IS OVERCOME
BY RESPECT*

Each rave event is not yours alone... it is a communal
experience made for everyone.  It is the togetherness of
everyone that makes raves fun and fulfilling.  To completely
kill a group experience it only takes a few individuals who
don't understand the concept of community.  Here are some
examples of selfish acts.  Each is  followed by a way to
overcome the selfishness.

-RESPECTING  THE PUBLICS'' OPINION OF RAVERS-
Visibility of drugs and alcohol-
Drugs are taboo to most of the public that forms an opinion about us... the
same public that gives us permission to gather and rave.  If you feel that
you need to have your mood
elevated, please be discrete.  Don't let anyone see the presence of drugs.
Don't give them a reason to accuse us.  Nitrous balloons are the biggest
problem in this area.  Balloons can easily be seen from a great distance
and the hiss of the valves makes it very easy to find the tanks.  PLEASE
DON'T BRING BALLOONS OR NITROUS TANKS INTO RAVES!   Similarly marijuana can
easily be smelled.  It is more difficult to findbut don't make it obvious.

<P A G E  6>
Being rude or obnoxious to non-ravers-
Rude and obnoxious behavior does nothing but upset people,
sometimes to the point of having them call the police.  Please
be polite to any "outsider" that you encounter while on the
way to or away from a rave.  Be polite to everyone for that
matter!

Noise-
Noise is a very big problem in most residential areas and is
often the reason for shut-downs.  Please be as quiet as
possible going to site.  Playing car radios loud, horn
honking, screeching tires and yelling can be louder than the
sound system enclosed in the venue.  Loitering around in the
parking area is illegal and only draws unwanted attention to
the party.  As you're walking to the door remember that you
are only moments away from being able to make as much
noise as you want!!

Fireworks-
Although cool to see, fireworks are a reason for instant shut-
downs. We all know about the danger of fires.  Enough said.
Additionally, the loud explosions can be misconstrued as
gun-shots which will get the police to the location faster than
anything.

Guns and Violence-
Neither of these belong at a rave.  It is our non-violent nature
that sets us apart from the rock and rap scenes.  Hopefully, a positive
rave experience will change the life of a violent natured person.


<P A G E  7>
-RESPECTING EVENT FACILITIES AND THE DESERT-

Parking-
Park only where it is permitted and, once again, don't hang
out in the parking lot or on the streets.  Don't throw trash and
flyers on the ground.  Keep as low a profile as possible.

Tagging-
We lose locations because of tagging more than anything else.
Tagging simply tells the landlord that we don't have any
respect for him or his property even though it is the landlord
that has been so kind to share his property with us.  Tagging
makes insurance rates climb. If you see someone tagging,
explain to them that they are keeping you from being able to
rave in L.A.  Ask them if they want to continue to rave...
then ask them to please stop.  Make sure everyone in the
area hears you so that they also become involved in making
the tagger stop.

Trash-
Many times the property owner is shocked by the trash left in
the facility, especially bathrooms.  It only takes a few seconds
to find a trash can... a very worthwhile investment of your
time.  Trash and especially flyers should NEVER be dropped
outdoors.  The wind can blow them away and where they will
never be found... except perhaps by a park ranger or other
authority figure.  It is very difficult to say  "that trash
was already there when we got here" when the trash is a
bunch of rave flyers.  Gum, candy and cig butts can be just as
incriminating.

<P A G E  8>
-RESECT FOR OTHER RAVERS-

Aggression/Violence-
Part of the attraction of a rave is that it can be a place to escape the
craziness of the rest of the world.  Leave your personal problems at the
door...    don't bring them into the celebration. Alcohol often brings
about aggressive behavior as well.

The rave scene prides itself on its' peaceful nature so there is absolutely
no tolerance for violence or aggression.  This even includes any
frustration that you may have with security, entry lines, etc.

A peaceful but enthusiastic attitude can quickly spread to others creating
a pocket of "vibe" that everyone will want to be a part of.  Acceptance of
others, even those different from
you, catches on quickly and creates a bond among all of us.  When outsiders
look in at our scene and see this bond, they cannot discredit it... they
can only see something positive...
perhaps it will be something that they will discuss with others. This is
the easieast way that we can create a more positive public image!

Blatant Selfishness-
This not only kills "the vibe" but it breaks us apart, making it difficult
to band together to help our movement as a whole.  A prime example of this
is blatant nitrous usage.  People sucking on balloons must know that  they
are jeopardizing EVERYONE'S right to rave and yet they continue to do it.  T
heir short-term high becomes more important than the future of raving
itself.  This kind of selfishness will certainly kill our future.  PLEASE
DON'T BRING NITROUS TO RAVES... leave it at home where it won't be a
selfish act that discredits all of us.


<P A G E  9>
*CARELESSNESS IS OVERCOME
THROUGH ACCOUNTABILITY*

Carelessness, which sometimes is accidental, can easily be
overcome through a system of accountability.  It only takes
two friends to commit to be accountable to each other in
reminding the other if they are being careless.  The more
people you have in your accountability group (also called
"true friends"), the less likely you are to do something
careless. Create an acountability group with the friends you rave with the
most.   Ask someone to be accountable for you RIGHT NOW!!!!

All you have to do is give a simple reminder.... speak up and
say, "I don't think it's such a good idea for you to do that."
Here are some places where carelessness becomes a problem
for each of us in the rave movement:

Forgetting about any of the above selfishness issues-
Go ahead... re-read them!

Driving safely-
There is nothing wrong with being too messed up or too tired
to drive home... unless of course you try to drive anyway.
Ask a more sober friend from your accountability group to
drive or wait until someone is able to drive.  Coffee and other
stimulants won''t do the trick..  Take your time so you
and your friends can rave again another day!
	
<P A G E  10>
Dealing with the wrong people-
Who are the wrong people? Unscrupulous drug dealers are just as problematic
as undercover drug enforcement agents. If you think getting something
"bunk" is a problem.... think about how bad it would be if you bought
something poisonous or lethal! This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem
as drug manufacturers are finding cheaper ways to make money. Most of them
aren't chemists and don't bother testing their new batch... you may become
a "test subject" for an unknown substance.   The media and law enforcement
agencies are infiltrating our masses to collect information to use against
us at a later time. You can never know who is who... so be careful.  Know
who you're dealing with.

Loitering outside of the venue-
This only draws attention to the  event and makes police curious enough to
"investigate."  Loitering also makes it more difficult to patrol a parking
area to look for people breaking into cars or doing other selfish
activities that hurt individual ravers and hurt the scene overall.  When
you're walking through a parking lot and you see people standing around ask
them to please go inside... but explain to them why it is important for
them to help in this regard.

Acting safely/Acting responsibly-
This is a broad area that has too many specific "infractions." Every once
in a while just ask yourself (and the people you''re accountable for) these
questions...

What am I doing?
Am I directly/indirectly harming myself or other ravers?
Am I keeping someone else from having a great time?
Am I helping build a positive public image about the rave scene?

<P A G E  11>
*IGNORANCE IS OVERCOME THROUGH
COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION*


Ignorance is the easiest problem to overcome but it also depends on
individual efforts..  All we need to do is educate ourselves.  But two
things must happen before we can educate each other.

First, we must be willing to be educated... we must recognized that we are
being stupid and want to change.

And secondly, we must communicate with each other.

Since we have no organized arena for ravers to come together and
communicate we are held in the dark.  We must find a centralized forum
where together we can learn from our past mistakes and innovate our future.
Until we find that forum, it is up to you to discuss these problems and
re-shape our future.

The existence of rave culture depends entirely on you to simply talk with
one another... to share all of these important issues with others... with
people you meet for the first time.

<P A G E  12>
Know what you're talking about-
Rumors and misinformation are splitting us apart.  Know the facts about the
realreasons for "busts"... or the dangers of certain substances.  Don't let
yourself be used as a tool for a promoters personal gain... or mouthpiece
for fabricated drug hysteria.

Know what you're taking-
We've already discussed unscrupulous drug dealers.  Don't combine lots of
different drugs!  There are combinations of substances that can quickly
become lethal.  In fact, more drug related casualties are due to lethal
combinations of drugs and alcohol than overdosing!

Let the DJ do the mixing!

Know your limit-
Your accountability group can help you with this.  Be careful trying to
"bump" your dosage.  Always let someone know exactly how much of what your
taking BEFORE you take it.

Know the law-
Get to know the specific legalities of possessing controlled substances.
Know the consequences if you're busted and ask yourself if it is worth the
risk.

Know how to handle yourself with the police-
Be cooperative but also know your rights regarding search and seizure laws
(especially in searching a vehicle).  Avoid dragging down the rave scene
with you.  Don't even mention
raves if you have a run in with officers.  Be afraid of the seriousness of
the consequences but don't let yourself be intimidated to the point that
you incriminate yourself.


<P A G E  13>
Know what to do in case of an emergency-
This is a very important area if we wish to police ourselves at raves.

In case of an overdose or other drug related medical trauma
follow these steps before calling an ambulance.

1)Move the victim to a safe, private and discrete area away
from the noise and everyone else.

2)Find out EVERYTHING that they took... including
dosage, combinations and alcohol.

3)Find the victims friends.

4)Don't panic.  Some drug related trauma can be relieved
simply through sleeping it off.

5)Find someone trustworthy and knowledgeable about those
substances and get their advice. (Like Medi-Rave!)

6)Do NOT administer CPR, induce vomiting, or other
first aid proceedures unless fully capable and qualified.

7)In the desert or in a hot venue, dehydration
could be the problem, so try drinking some water.

8)If necessary ask security to call for help or ambulance.


<P A G E  14>
Know your promoters-
It's time that ravers determine how much an event is worth.
If you think you're getting ripped off or if a promoter is
constantly being busted... STOP SUPPORTING THOSE EVENTS!!!  Try to remember
that promoter's  other events.  Think about what the promoter promised for
those raves...

Bust-free? (which might not really possible anymore)
Carnival rides/visuals/multiple areas?
Free water/gifts/etc.?
Big name Djs/bands?

So what do you and your accountability group do if you're
not getting your money's worth?  All of you should:

-find and tell the promoter that you're not satisfied
-leave a message(s) on the voice mail
-don't go to that promoter''s events again
-write letters to local music magazines
-post to the internet rave related mail groups
-throw your own event... large or small!!!

Remember that many promoters throw raves for a living and
that they must make money.  We're not asking promoters to
lose money!  We're thankful that they go through all the
hassle to even HAVE an event to go to.  However, we ARE
asking promoters to re-invest into the scene.... after all... if
the scene doesn't survive, the promoters don't survive either.

Support promoters that are helping our movement flourish...
that are innovating with creative ideas...that deliver what they
promise... that re-invest in the scene... that respect ravers,
DJs, venues, officers, public opinion and Mother Earth!

<P A G E  15>
The best way to combat ignorance is to get and stay informed.
All that is required of this is communication!  Call unbiased
info lines to get the "scoop" on upcoming events.  Read the
local magazines that report on rave culture.

Perhaps the BEST way to get informed is... if you know
someone with an internet connection... get online!  Subscribe
to So-Cal Raves or visit web sites like Dr. Freeclouds and
Hyperreal (see next page).

 The information  and feedback offered by online
communication can really benefit you as an individual raver
and will help the rave movement flourish overall.  Here's
what you can get from being informed through the net:

-A calendar of upcoming raves, clubs, after-hours and rave-related radio/TV
shows
-Help determine which promoters and events are worthwhile
-Find out about events that you may have missed
-Read other ravers'' opinions of events, DJs, music, and mix tapes
-Find out more about DJs or bands you like
-Voice your frustrations about specific rave related issues
-Get advanced info on location, line-up, changes, and mergers
-Get info on specific drug-related warnings or scams
-Learn more about rave/DJ culture
-Find out about unpromoted events and micro-raves
-MOST IMPORTANTLY...
Find new raver friends that share similar tastes and views with you.

called gamma hydroxy butane, aka liquid e. girl got taken off the 
bulletproof boat 2 sundays ago cause she had a bit too much. 2 capfulls 
should do it, i mean induce mild euphoria. very subtle, almost like it 
was having no effect. 45 minutes later it was over. not a big deal at 
least to me, but i hear there is a fine line between enough and too much.
be careful!

I would recommend *anyone* other than PacBell, no offense to anyone who 
works there but I've had the worst experiences with PacBell, trying to 
setup my own ISP, they are not very helpful.

  For whatever it's worth, I just took a few minutes to HTMLize that
handbook from SoCal Raves.  I also removed the Socal-specific text (just
at the end, with the URLs) and made a couple of minor cosmetic changes.
You can see the results at:

  http://www.best.com/~dlowe/handbook.html

  Criticism or compliments are welcome :)... and FYI I tested it in Lynx
so if it looks crummy under netscape or any other browser... well... it's
not my fault!  :)
  See you all tomorrow afternoon, I hope!

No doubt it is completely a coincidence that since Pac Bell got interested
in that business
that our previously rock-solid-reliable ISP suddenly started having trouble
with lines
accidentally getting dug up, made hopelessly noisy or disconnected, over and
over again.

I thought I put this out, If anyone from the South Bay can give Tom
(djtom@svpal.org) a ride to the BBQ please let me know asap. If know one
can, I'll be getting up about 8am drive to San Jose then Drive back to the
City and then switch cars and drive to the BBQ, then to berkeley pick up
some equipment, then back to the BBQ and start setting up. I figure if
someone else can get him, I can sleep maybe 2 more hours before having to
setup and not drive back and forth. I'll be getting up at 8am and check the
mail, so please email me or leave a voice mail on 415-974-4357 if you can
do it. If not I'll have to do it. I'm not complaining and will do it if
need be, but would like it if someone that's already down there can do it.
Thankss..

great group of people. despite some nasty tech difficulties, people were
partying , enjoying themselves, being nice glowy selves.
music: started <?>
seemed like first dj threw on a record, sat down, let people playing with
drums and Dig;s confuse the beats.
LAter DJ's seemed pissed, shaking heads, etc.. i guess this was just bad
sound set up or something.
im too tired and confused to write this.

hope people at the party previously known as Untitled had good fun.
hope to see you all at the BBQ tomorrow.

take care

Poor little Timmy is very, very tired from a hard week of work and is
asleep on our couch as we write this. It would just break our hearts to
have to wake him in just three hours, just to drive all the way to downtown
San Jose to find Tom.

We all know how much Tim, the hardest working dj/chef/promoter in show
business needs his sleep --

-- and only *you* can give it to him.

Won't one of you kind hearted south bay ravers please pick up your
telephone and call now?

Dear You's

        Hiya, I was wondering if I could come by before I leave for a
camping trip today and come and see you. E-Mail or call me at 510-595-7988,
I won't see you'a at the BBQ; because I'm going Trancing; sick or not I've
been in the house to long and am starting to forget how to use the English
lanuage because I'm forced to speak Siamesse Kitty; meeow, mowl, mowl,
purrrrrrrrrr, see what I mean it just starts coming out. Drop us(me & the
kitties) a line, and I'll probably play with it.

Peace
Brian

Subject: 60's movie

Last night I saw a flick aptly titled "the Hippie Revolution". First off:
it was incredibly cheesy! Imagery of naked girls frolicking through the
forest...a girl selling a newspaper for twenty cents which is dipped in
acid and can be rolled up and smoked (?!?)- scenes like this are all too
stereotyoical and campy. At the same time, the entire film/documentary is
set in SF...which still looks the same!! The way the kids were talking
about the communal love they felt was reallt remeniscent of my first summer
in the scene. But somehow the innocence was lost...after the disenchanted
70's...the money-grubbing 80's, we're trying our best, but who can blame us
for being at least a bit cautious.
       It was also amazing that so many people migrated here from around
the world in 1967. I always wish that we could have a bigger community
which was highly mobile (like the rave cummunity in the UK), but we are so
large and diverse- nestled in alcoves across the country. Imagine what SF
would be like if a 100,000 kids came here (crowded, sure!) for the scene.
That's what 1967 was like...anyhows, despite the cheesiness of the movie,
the images of the past blew my mind.

Hey Everybody -

I am in the currently in the process of making a website devoted to 
personal rave reviews in the S.F. bay area. Originally I was going to 
write all the reviews myself, but it would take forever for me to 
review the 75+ raves I've been to in the last few years.

So I've decided to open it up to you guys. If you've been to a rave in 
the last few years that you absolutely loved (or hated). Write a review 
of approx. 250 words or less with this format:

Title
By (your name)
Date: (date)
Location: (location)

Body

Then e-mail it to me with "Rave Reviews" in the subject.

Please feel free to make them as personal as possible. Write whatever
you want. But depending on the response (and server space) I may not be 
able to publish every single review, but I'll try my best. The site 
should be up in a week or two. 

Big special thanks the Troy Sheets and Mike Migurski for helping me get
this thing going! =)

PLUR,

CT

Subject: Help us buy a tent for the rave camp at burning man!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


We are raising funds to purchase a huge tent to cover rave camp at burning
man, and to provide shelter for underground outdoor raves in the bay area.
Which would extend outdoor party season through the winter.

Those of you that have attended burning man before know how important shade
and shelter are, and this will provide them both, protecting us and (uh,
one of the) soundsystems.

The tent we want to get is 20 feet by 60 feet, canvas with removable side
walls (that help keep heat and sound in and wind and dust out), and High
ceilings (for killer light shows and scaffolding towers).  Ever seen a
circus tent?

-------------------

The price of the tent is : $9930.00

$7770.00 - Top and frame
$2160.00 - 16 - 10 foot sections of side walls

-------------------

Damn pretty expensive...  Well, it's worth a shot...  Many people will
benefit from it.  I believe this may be worth substantial money to some...


So If you want to rave in the shade/rain/hail/sandstorms, send me what it's
worth to you...  I'll hold all donations until we have all the money, if we
don't get enough, I'll send it back to you.

If you want to check my scene friendly credentials, contact Ethan Miller,
Tom Leichardt, Derek, or anyone in Gateway systems.

-------------------

Send checks (payable to me) to:
ed colmar
6114 LaSalle ave #120
Oakland Ca 94611

Be sure to include a return address, a phone number and email.

If you have an ecash account, you can donate on the Web.

http://www.immersivearts.org/trust/

Do it fast too, there are outdoor events happening now that could be
benefiting from this hardware, and burning man isn't too far away.

-------------------

Some math for reference...

9930/20 = 496.5 (I personally don't think that many people will donate)
9930/50 = 198.6 (more reasonable cost)
9930/75 = 132.4 (getting pricey, but more realistic people wise)
9930/100 = 99.3 (I dunno....)

-------------------

Feel free to spread this information to those that may be interested.

aquarius is air sign. mutable air. what is air about? i mean are there 
generalizations?
what about water?
i had my  chart done not too long ago, and there were pages of accurate 
and some not so accurate(but really mainly accurate) insights about me 
and my energy patterns/personality etc. that she got from a computer that 
computes positions of planets according to exactly when you are born, and 
i knew she did not know me very well at all(hmm...maybe in a way she 
really *did* know me?) but here were all these true things about me. the 
non-coincidences were too numerous to dismiss...

Dear All;

        We live in American right, I just woke up...... Oh, yeah we live in
American where almost anything can be purchased, and also RENTED or better
yet LEASED.  I think this would be much more a prudet idea than investing
10k in a tent. Just my 2 cents worth.

Peace
Brian

Dear Yous;

        In addition, it's much more a lucrative tax break/deduction to rent
capitol equipment rather than purchase it out right.

Peace
Brian

hello all-

from any of you who are out there and deciding if they are going to the 
bbq, here's a picture of what's going on.

to my life are approximately 20 individuals dancing to jonabomb, who is 
spinning a great set.

to my right are a bunch of people eating, smoking, laughing, juggling, 
and generally having fun.

to my front is a beautiful view of the sun and san-pablo bay.

hope to see you (if i haven't already!)

love-

matt l

Allright, since the infoline for EON doesn't have any location info as

Just back from the BBQ, sunburned, grinning, and STUFFED.  What a lovely 
day!  What lovely people!  What a nice party!  

Pt. Molate is beautiful of course, a little cove at the foot of Richmond 
Bridge that is just far enough away from civilization to let us seriously 
CHILL.  So great to see all you netheads out in PERSON (yes, there ARE 
real people behind the posts!).  Finally got my requisite necklace 
laminates (had felt like a naked raver without them :).  And macked on 
the F-n-F tix.  A sell-out before the last veggie dog had even been 
cooked!  It's a trip that 600 tickets would go just from the greater F-F 
collective and the internet picnic'ers - I guess our extended family is 
HUGE!  And many more are going to be bummed out to miss it.

Music was _really_ good, our own Jon dropped the bomb on us, Jeff got 
biological on our asses, but the sun was too hot for many of us to show 
our appreciation.  I bobbed my head in the shade.

And the FOOD!  You SFRavers are too generous - every single person (it 
seemed) came loaded down with bags of food, way more than we could consume (though I tried my 
best!).  Props due to Paul's brownies, Eric's massive fruit salad, and of 
course Tim for standing over a steaming barbeque all fuckin day (and for 
organizing this, you're the best!).

Keep an eye out for Chris the cameraman.  He's got stacks of amazing 
pictures from many parties, and he is truly an artist.  Especially good 
is his trick of layering several images, so ravers appear to be dancing 
amid fields of daisies or one person is shown in several moments.  The 
images really captured (for me) the true feelings and range of 
raving.  I wished I could have them in a book to show outsiders when 
I try to tell them what I feel.

Good-night!  Have loads of fun wherever you are headed tonight - 
Eon, New Moon, or (like me) something NRR.  'Cause I like to keep it 
something special. 

Love, Nancy

I'm not trying to be smart or anything, but I don't know about all these
don'ts--I think one of the best parts of raving is bringing one of "these
types" to a party and watching their belief system melt away.
Best,
Timothy

  Whoopee!

  Well, I had a great time at the BBQ too.  It was my first outdoor rave,
and it was great!  There is definitely something to be said for dancing &
music in an outdoor setting.  Quite a different experience, and, I'm happy
to say, a very good one.

  The space was gorgeous.  The sunset was not very dramatic, but still
gorgeous.  The food was excellent!  I brought lots, but there was so much
food that I got most of mine back at the end of the night.  I don't know
what I'll do with all the veggie dogs :)

  The music was good, up until the last DJ came on (sorry, I don't know
any names)... then, it was GREAT!  I danced a fair bit, and it took me a
few hours to figure out that barefoot was the way to go.  It only took a
few minutes to figure out that it wouldn't be wise to dance in the full
sun though!  It was hot!  Beautiful weather we've been having.

  Best of all was the people.  I had wanted to meet lots of SFRavers...
but in the end, shyness got the best of me, and I only met a few new
people (matt/lanima00, crunch, and a couple others) - hi!  It was also a
great chance for me to hang out with a couple of the sfravers I already
had met (john k, robert, mattloaf - howdy!) in a more laid back
environment than a full blown, overnight rave.  To the curious: I was the
guy with the outgrown buzz-cut (damn, I need a haircut!), wearing a dark
red t-shirt and black corduroy cut-offs - and a big grin most of the time.
If I met you and didn't remember your name, please don't take offence!  I
have a crappy memory for names!
  
  Special thanks to the people who organized and executed this little
get-together.  It was really wonderful, and I hope there will be more!

  The rest of you will probably be at F&F next weekend, but I will be out
of town.  I'm pretty bummed about missing it.  But I will live.  AIDS walk
tomorrow.  Should be great.  Sleep well (or rave well to some of you!)
everyone!

I just want to say, to Ethan and to everyone else at FnF: 
thank you! thank you! thank you!  There's actually a good amount of
upgrading that I've been meaning to do on hyperreal (more disk space, more
memory, and a new motherboard - with the latter, perhaps a new OS) which
something like this will definitely help with.  Woohoo!  

With this as a spark, I will be starting a page on hyperreal which will
outline exactly what the "status" of the machine is - what hardware's
being used, what new hardware was bought, what's on the wish list, and
what the donation level is at, etc.  I think that's only fair, so you know
where the money is going, etc.  I'll post details about that when it's up.

See you all next Saturday night!

	Brian

Welll...

the previous reviews have pretty much covered it, but I though I'd add my 2
cents:

Thank you Tim, thank you Tony, thank you everyone else on the planning
group and everyone who donated equipment, time, food, money, and effort. It
was well worth it!

I had a blast; never danced barefoot before but it was a lot of fun. All
the DJs were incredible (Tom! this was my first time hearing you live; you
tore shit up!), the food was tasty, and I met a lot of new people.

glad to see it went off.

see you all at FnF next week!!

I just wanted to express my thanks to every single person that help out
with the BBQ & BEATS and to all the people that came to this party. I had
one hell of a time and I think I can say that hopefully everyone that went
also had a great time.  I really don't know what to say, I'm still
recovering. All I know is DAMN! I had a good time. And everyone there made
it that much more enjoyable. All the DJs I thought spun great sets. This
was the first time I heard Todd Manley and Monty spin and they were great.
Jonathan, BioJeff and Tom did great also.

I want to say thanks to the FnF crew for coming and providing FnF tickets.
I heard someone talking saying that they came just for the tickets and
ended up wanting to stay for the whole thing, that was great. I also want
to thank the New Moon crew for setting up the alter on the rocks by the
water, it looked really beautiful.

I'd sit here forever thanking everyone so I'll just say

THANK YOU ALL, for showing, helping with the BBQ.

the BBQ was SWEET! I had a great time and met some really cool
peoples...thanks everyone...what a great community we have together...so
damn nice! i grought a new(bee) friend and we talked about the origins of
underground culture, he is more into punk scene and stuff, we were talking
about this as sort of a new techie subculture with the music as the soul
of the machine, but the difference being here we need access to
machines to be in touch with the subculture..., anyway enough ramblings
about the postindutrial angst of modern man...my friend had a great time
as didi I...see ya'll on saturday

Besides the events that happened this weekend, where else can
one pick up tickets to FnF?  I made it to the BBQ (I was the
guy on the bike) and got some for myself and some friends, but
now some others want to go, too, and I'm at a loss.

let me 2nd this - i got to the bbq after the feeding frenzy and am
still seeking FnF tickets - any help or pointers toward tickets
for me and a friend would be _really_ great.

i'm willing to go as high as a 50% interest in my eternal soul, or 10% as
a finder's fee for info leading to tickets ... 8)

p.s. djtom was _outrageous_ - MoreMoreMore!

Since there seems to be two of us called "Troy" on this list, the best place
to look to see who sends exactly what to who is on the return address.  So
to avoid any confusion, I'll just start using the name w/my handle.

Dear Tim,

Thank you thank you thank you for a delicious Saturday afternoon!  The
food was sooo good!  And the music was great, also.  I very much liked
Monty's and BioJeff's sets.  I love the stuff they play.  Everyone did a
great job, I thought.  And it was loads of fun for P. and me to come and
put together a little altar next to the water.  Pt. Molate needs lots of
love!  

See you soon,

Ann

Hi again!

Despite my troubled heart, I still managed to pack in a full weekend of rad
parties Friday, Sat and in to Sun...  
Friday I went to this dinker party in Concord.  Not much, just a bunch of
friends doing the small intimate type, I had a good time and met some nice
folks...Till the po po's came at 1:00ish and made us all leave! Lame!  

But ever quest full, we ventured forth to Berkeley, where we went to the
"symbol" (no name...like Prince) party.  We were too late for the map point,
frustrated, about to go home, when some coolies struttin pointed the way!!!
 Was fate, cuz it was so much fun!  Two floors, rad outside area with cool
visuals (low tech, but  on 2  20X20' screens, all 60's style) plus a
synchronized strobe and low frequency sound generator experiment at like 4:30
upstairs...really mind boggling except for the lameos yelling (why? cuz they
turned off the beats? GO DOWN STAIRS!!!!) It's going to be a weekly, so you
should all check it out $10.00  510-869-4114  415-263-3926

And then,  on SAT I went to the coolest, deepest party I've been to in a
while, the GOA trance party in the woods!!! Well worth the giant hill we had
to climb to get there.  Beautiful setting.  Stars so bright you didn't need a
flashlight even after the moon went down.  Plus AMAZING music.  Admittedly, I
am not the most qualified judge, but it seemed the beats pouring from the
system there were the best music ever created since the beginning of time
(which is infinite).  But I did get agreement from some well knowledged
friends.  Strange system.  Two DAT tape decks that they used all night to mix
the most amazing shit, with some sort of little book with song names and
numbers in a list, all hand written.  SO MANY LAYERS OF SCI-FI FX!!!  Like
aliens on acid in a belching contest (oh no, that was just me).  Plus the fat
fast trancey beats holding it all together. Weirdness.  When I asked the DJ,
he said it was "stuff we made 'back home' that was still not on vinyl".  He
had an accent... from Germany? They had tables, but they didn't even use them
till like 8:00am (well, we got there at 11:00pm ish, and it had been going
since noon, so they might have earlier).  But, they didn't need them in my
opinion.  Who are these guys/gals?  Smiles, food to share at 7:00am, good
feelings, they all knew each other it seemed (by morning, or already?).
Really good folks, fun to dance with especially when there were only like 15
of us left! This is what the scene is really about (I believe). Even if the
dance floor was a dirt hill (I can see the headline:  Erosion Caused by
"Rave" Party Starts Rock Slide Covering the Town of Cazadero!!!!)!!

Shout out to the SFR people I met there: WATZUP TRIPPERZ!  

Ann:  Sorry, I forgot to give you my address...didn't remember until I was 
way down the hill...acadosi@aol.com

Brian: Thanks for the stoke, helped the synapses return to normal! 

Moander (aw, man! I forgot your real name!):  Dude!  Thank you SO MUCH for
pointing the way to this local [for me] party.  I even met some friends there
I didn't expect to see who I've been missing...

If they ever do it again, GO GO GOA!!!!!

Hope all your weekends were fun, and don't forget to follow your heart, even
if it hurts!

        That was SF transplant, from Germany, Peter of Kode IV; awesome
creator of Techno/Trance Type Music, and really nice guy. Who I'm told has
like 9+ CD's out in Europe, and has also toured Europe on more than one
ocassion. Our very own Adam of CCC/F-8 fame is also freatured I believe on
some of these tracks. I personnally own 2 of Kode IV CD's and plan to get
more as I findem, usually available at F-8 on the Haight.

        I personnally refused to move my sick ass from the living room
fireplace, enjoying my fish and shimp, who said's you can't eat good outside.

        Thanks to all you vunderful beautiful people that I met which
included Justine, Kat, Devon, ....etc + people I'm forgeting because I'm
such a space, and it's early.

        A personal note, YES FOLKS I'M STILL SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Newsgroups: alt.drugs
Subject: Ecstasy spiked with heroin and other rumours

This is an edited version of an article in December issue of
Eternity/magazine/Rumours

You've probably heard stories of E being spiked with addictive and
poisonous substances. True, when you buy "Ecstasy" there's no quality
control and you may well get cocktails of other drugs, particularly when
the dealer has run out of MDMA. You may also get a dud. But not heroin or
poison.

Every day the police confiscate suspect drugs which are sent to a
forensic laboratory at Aldermaston specially equipped to detect drugs,
and they have never come across drugs sold as Ecstasy containing heroin.
People taken to hospital with possible drug problems have samples of
their blood sent to the National Poisons Unit which has special equipment
to detect drugs: heroin has not been found in the blood of patients
reported to have taken only Ecstasy. So how did the rumours start?
A year ago Time Out magazine ran a double page feature entitled "Bitter
Pills", subtitled "Ecstasy has turned to agony for thousands of E users"
as dealers spike tablets and capsules with heroin, LSD, rat poison and
crushed glass. The story was repeated all over the place, even in a
Danish newspaper.

I questioned the source quoted: Stephen Beard of the Newham Drugs Advice
Project. He was elusive, and when I finally I got him on the phone would
only say that the story came from a dealer who said he made fake Ecstasy
by crushing light bulbs. There was no supporting evidence such as lab
tests or reports from doctors who had treated users. The National Poisons
Unit told me there had been no recent cases of poisoning due to ground
glass or rat poison. Yet, in spite of my protests, Newham and Time Out
did nothing to correct the story. Likewise, Mixmag's recent feature on
Ecstasy omitted to mention the Glasgow tests showing that Ecstasy was not
contaminated, even though they had the results. Mixmag also said: "300mg
MDMA can kill a small girl" (the lowest lethal dose recorded in animal
trials was 20mg/kilo, or 300mg for someone weighing 15kg: a very small
girl); and "MDA is like strong LSD mixed with speed" (MDA has no LSD-like
effects, it is similar to MDMA but longer lasting and with less warmth).
Its as though no-one wants to undermine the established myths.
One of these came from a satirical song in the fifties called The Old
Dope Peddler: "He gives the kids free samples because he knows full well,
that today's young innocent faces will become tomorrow's clientele". Its
no more likely than your local wine merchant going to the trouble and
expense of injecting bottles with heroin, hoping that you will become an
addict to boost his sales. True, some dealers cheat by selling any old
white powder as Ecstasy, but cheats are unlikely to sell heroin at a loss
or go to the trouble of crushing light bulbs.
Most of the substitutes found in Ecstasy are not harmful, but can produce
unexpected effects. However, before you blame the pill, you should
realise just how important is the situation and you own expectations. In
fact, very few people realise and accept how much the effect of drugs
like Ecstasy depends on their own situation, and state of mind at the
time. My best E experience was caused by an identical tablet as one that
made a friend sick and another that had no effect (at a party in an
enclosed tunnel).
Remember that E is not simply a happy pill, but lowers your defences and
allows you to open up. However, it may be more comfortable to remain
defensive and reserved unless you are in a situation where you feel good.
E can bring up suppressed feelings which you may not be prepared to face.
More on situations to avoid and emotional dangers next month.
Deaths in Scotland
I have been trying to discover what caused the deaths at Hanger 13 - so
as to inform people and prevent more tragedies. I have even spoken to say
they know but can't tell because, mad though it seems, Scottish law
prohibits them from revealing cause of death. However, the Home Office
licensed Glasgow University to collect and analyse 15 samples of
"Ecstasy" after the deaths. 14 were pure MDMA and one was a capsule that
contained speed with just a trace of MDMA. So it seems unlikely that
these deaths were due to poisons sold as Ecstasy. Incidentally, doctors
who had talked to users of "Rhubarb and Custard" said they believed it
contained "MDMA plus a strong hypnotic" (e.g. heroin). In fact it was
pure MDMA.
A possibility, believed by the National Poisons Unit, is that these
people died from overheating which has been the cause of nearly all rave
deaths, particularly in clubs with nonstop hard core techno, no chill-out
area and no free water. The tragedy is that those people didn't know the
importance of avoiding overheating. The media love to say that people who
take Ecstasy risk dropping dead without warning, but the warning is clear
to those who look out for it: getting too hot. The risk can be avoided by
taking breaks, cooling off and drinking plenty of water. Overheating also
kills people who do not take drugs, but without drugs the discomfort is
more obvious.
Another theory is that the Scottish victims took Temazapam or Valium with
Ecstasy. Reports say the two taken together can "hit you like a hammer".
The lesson is: "Don't mix E with other drugs and don't take too much too
often".

My book E for Ecstasy is completely sold out, but a revised edition is

Had a great time this weekend.  Met a lot of people at the BBQ.  Didn't dance
though.  I ate too much.  For those wondering who I am I was wearing black
shorts, black/brown stripped tshirt (sorta), and Simples.   Hi to everyone
I met. 

Also, I left around 8:30 and I forgot my blanket.  Anyone happen to pick up
a small plaid blanket??? 

Went to EON afterwards.  The guys workin door stunk.  They weren't very well 
organized and it took a long time to get in.  It was $25 bucks too.  But, I
had fun once inside.  The music was pretty good but the DJs lost me a couple
times.  The only thing that bothered me inside was people trying to give me
flyers while I was dancing.  

Lookin forward to next weekend and FnF.

Jay

in my previous message, i meant to say something uplifting to the
community (let's bring what we do on weekends to the week, etc) and i
inadverdantly offended some individuals, who thought i was preaching.

so, here goes-

SORRY!  i just say what i think and try to stay happy.  just don't flame
me for it (as i already have been today)

kinda pissed off-

Another praise report for the BBQ & Beats II: I had a wonderful time the
whole time.  It was very special to prepare food together, to find others
who understand how nearly-sacred garlic is, to have been blessed with
grapes and nectarines to complete my fruit salad by two beautiful angels,
and to witness ground beef being Matt-handled ;)  All the food was
outstanding!  *BURP*  :)
The weather, the water, and the space were gorgeous, the music just right
and very danceable, even though the heat discouraged many of us from
getting out there till there was more shade.  Sound system was excellent!
The altar was a sight to behold, and looked especially enchanting right as
the sun was setting.
We learned a valuable lesson from Renaud: don't sit on a Styrofoam cooler!
Graceful Gazelle Award goes to our brother from France ;)
Thanks to everyone for being so supportive at a time when I really needed
it.  If I didn't seem as friendly as I usually am or maybe should have been
or whatever, it was due to my weird state of mind because of this Sara
situation.  I appreciate all of you, and all you did for me, more than you
know :)
It was cool meeting so many friends and seeing so many friends I've already
met.  Another one of those perfect parties where both happen throughout the
event.
OK, maybe I should do some work now...hope to see y'all at FnF!

Love and more love (with bbq sauce!),

Eric

Dear friends,

        Many of us had such a good weekend, and (hopefully) all of us want
to treat each other decently, so please let's not be nasty to each other.
Get past the wording in a message to find the sentiments behind those
words, if you read something that rubs you the wrong way.  Brother Matt's
intentions were beautiful, and it hurts when kindness is returned with
unkindness.
(Hey, Matt, can I have my $2 now?  J/k  ;)).

Love to all,

Eric

Hello all,

        When I say I love you, please don't take it the wrong way.  I don't
do it expecting anything in return; I just mean that I appreciate you,
respect you, and value you, and wish you all the best.  I don't mean to
turn anyone off with mushiness or make anyone feel uncomfortable.  I'd say
"I love you, but don't let it go to your head," but that's kinda silly
(even for me ;)).  That's been on my mind for a long time, and I wanted
everyone to know it.
        Second note: In Saturday's mail, I received a card.  It's one of
those computer-printed cards that you print on a sheet of paper and fold in
quarters.  The art is in Egyptian style.  On the front it says "Beware the
thorns of the Black Rose of Love" and inside it says "Lest your Soul they
prick."  There's nothing written on the card.  The envelope has no return
address, has a San Jose postmark, and has the letter E on the back.  The
front has my first name, and the address was applied by cutting out my
return address from a piece of mail I sent someone.  This has me puzzled.
If anyone on this list sent this, please let me know who you are.  I
suspect it might have been Sara, but I'm not sure, and I'm very curious.

That's all for now.  Thanks!
Love, light, and peace to everyone,

Eric

Dear All;

        Every time I go to a Trance Party it's like visiting the United
Nations. The SF Trance scene is soooo much more multi-national and diverse,
than the other Techno styles. I routinely meet people from Germany, France,
England, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, & Japan. It's so empowering, like
I have the world before me and I'm it's embassador, right here, right now, I
can help change how we think & feel about one another through MY actions.
That it's MY responsibility to spread some love & goodwill that will travel
the world, and also get some of that global love for myself.

        Fuckin AYE!!!!!! It gives me sooooo much hope that yes, I can help
change the world for the better, That TODAY I helped the planet get a little
bit more positive, that TODAY I helped take back this grid we call planet
Earth from all the negativity that dominates our globe.

Peace
Brian

Dear All;

        I feel that often the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I
feel that it's the writers responsibility when composing their retoric to
make sure their ideas, feelings, and intentions are brought out in a clear
and concise manner allowing the reader to digest only the writers true
meaning. As difficult as it sounds, I certainly believe that it is possible
to do. I myself need a lot of help in doing the above mentioned, and would
be happy to hear some suggestions from our literary experts out there on how
this can be achieved.

Sincerely
Brian

Excellent!!!  Irie!!!
I'm gonna have to get out to more Trance events (goa trance is my
favorite).  I like this multi-national view, and hope to experience it to
the fullest, to witness the same sentiments and high hopes for positive
growth & change that we hold espoused by others around the world :)

Peace, indeed :)

Hi all...

I'm looking to invest in a Zip drive, and before blowing 200 bucks through
commercial channels, I thought I'd check to see if anyone on the list has
one for sale for less or knows someone who does...

thanks.

ok...get this...I am writing a ten page paper on how media manipulates 
language to change their audience's perception on raves...say...lilke 
Hard Copy?!?!?
Anyhow...it would really help if y'all chipped in your opinion to help my 
evidence.  If you don't have much time, you can just type in y/n 
answers...thanks.

Do you think that media has a major handle on individual's perception of 
things (raves)?

Do you think that media from sources like Hard Copy,etc. purposefully 
misrepresent raves?

If you have seen-read the Hard Copy bit, do you think that they 
represented raves as they are?  Please comment.

Do you think that raves are a safe place to be?

What do you think is the negative side to raves?  and the positive?

Why do you attend raves/support them?

Please give additional examples of media misuse or media that represented 
the scene well (if you know of anymore).


Thanks for everyone who has helped me with this assignment so far!!

I had a really great time at the BBQ.  It was so nice to sincerely talk 
with people and get to know them.  It's funny how my "raving" life goes 
in jumps and spurts.  My relationships with you guys goes from one 
weekend to the next, and this BBQ allowed me to bridge that gap somewhat.

The collective effort of the party was amazing and the music was good too!!


I got my FnF tix, and I have one word: EXCITEMENT!  I already told this 
to a bunch of you, but I was dreaming about what color the laminates 
would be the night before the BBQ (I dreamt the wrong color, though!).  
Maybe I'm just a spazz, but I derive so much fun from anticipation alone!!

I'm bringing two dear friends to FnF who have never ever been to a rave.  
I told them that if they never go to another one, they just can't miss 
this one!  My excitement comes off as very bizarre to them, but maybe 
they will understand after next weekend!  They have begun to ask me the 
list of "silly" questions, my favorite being "Is this going to be in one 
of those, you know, warehouses?"  Too cute!

I saw Roger's and Justin's pictures of Beautiful People.  I have to admit 
that I *never* thought there would be a picture of myself on the web.  It 
is so strange!! I kind of laugh about it because a year ago, I didn't 
even know how to use the web.  It's so funny:)  And, their pictures are 
amazing.  That camera made some really flattering pictures.

I remember everyone who I met, I just don't have time to list all the 
names.  I am very good at remembering names and also the first time I met 
you.  I also remember all of your posts (when I have time to read them) 
and all of the spellings of your names.  I think I have a slight 
photographic memory which I didn't realize until I realized that no one 
else seemed to remember some of the stuff I do!!  So, I have a challenge.  
If you see me, quiz me as to your name and where I met you.  If I get it 
wrong, I owe you a sticker!! :P

Have a great week, I'll be seeing you SOON!!

Dear All;

        I either come in, or end up waking up when the Alex Bennet morning
show is going on. They always ask for people to come down to their show, and
I was thinking about invading the Alex B's morning show with a bunch of
SFRavers.  I think it would be a blast, especially if we where on. Intersted

I'd rather go country line dancing at a Knights of Columbus hall in the

But you have fun!

Dear All;

        This is a perfect example of why I won't do a party in this town.
Only the politically popular people get to see their ideas in action.

        Tony, how else but negative would you take something like this if
you got it in your box. This is anything BUT positive and affirming.

        I was in a good mood to.

Sincerely
Brian

Uh, sarcasm?  I don't like Alex Bennett, alright.  It wasn't meant as a
personal attack, believe me.

okay.. run down of the weekend if peeps want to hear it.

Fri-  "Untitled" party.  Berkeley housing.  lo-tek 60's style visuals.  Nice
patio w/ torches.  Glass blowing person NICE touch.  Some good jungle work
by Polywog & Abstract.  Mind test experiment... woowoowoo.  Who the hell was
shouting '96??  Dutch (now Starbuck?) played high energy music in the early
morn.  People I saw (hi!).. girl promoting "Nation", Chris, branka, Jeff,
John and others.

Sat- BBQ and Beasts.. or was it BBQ and Beets.. Beef? (Nope.. no beef there)
=) Solid music. Lots of happy faces.  Real family style atmosphere..  Props
to all involved in putting it together (Tony, Tim).  Hi and hugs to Amy,
Paul, Kirsten, Nancy, Chris, Tony, John, Adam, CT, everybody else I met.  
If I didn't meet you, I was the guy with long hair running around in the
"Alien with Dr. Seuss hat" t-shirt, and shiny blue shorts.

Hung out with Jeff from Nexus.  Everyone should go to his party on the 23rd
of August called "Open".. If you liked "Second Chakra" you'll love this one.
I've got flyers if anyone needs them.  *SPECIAL*  There is going to be a
*live butterfly dome*  where you can sit among butterflies!

Sun- Hit Haight street.  Spun some reckids.  Drooled over new gear.  Saw
Mars + Myster-E at F-8.  Also saw Paul and John there. 
Watched the anime "Ghost in the Shell".  Definately pick this one up if you
like Japanimation.  Real dark futur kinda stuff.
Wanted to go to Mantra, but had to drive the hr and 1/2 home.. :(
 
Have a good week!
Aaron.

Hey all!

I am glad there are so many good reviews from last few days.  It just 
makes me happy to see how many people had fun :).

Friday night I ended up checking a small party in Concord, which was in 
an apartment complex, by the pool.  I didn't know many people, the 
party was too small, and I felt a little old (hmmm...  I usually don't, 
but that time i did).  My friends and I ended up leaving soon and going to 
Untitled.  The place was pretty cool (a dorm - I am impressed how people 
who live there didn't mind the loud music).  The upstairs area was OK, 
although it seemed there wasn't enough air at some points.  I ended up 
spending a lot of time in the nice outdoor area watching the LSD show 
:).  It was fun.  Met one SFR person - Aaron at the party - hey :))).

Saturday I couldn't stop thinking about the BBQ, because although Untitled 
was fun, I felt like I didn't know enough people and I wanted some of my 
friends to be there...  I guess I really depend on people :P.  
Everybody already said so much about the BBQ, that I am not sure what to 
say.  I LOVED it.  Thank you all for making it so much fun.  Big thanks 
to Tim (who stood by the BBQ all afternoon while the heat was kicking in) and 
Tony.  It was great seeing all the people I know.  The only thing I regret 
about the BBQ - I haven't met many new people.  I was reading some posts 
and I was looking forward meeting some of you guys, but somehow it just 
didn't happen (I guess I was too busy eating great food and dancing).  
For those that I met, but can't remember (except Nancy and Greg), I was 
wearing green bathing suite top and green baggy shorts, long brown hair..
 
I will be looking for you guys at FnF.  I also want to go to Theta, but I 
am not sure if 2 parties in 1 night will be possible.  Also, I heard so 
much about FnF and haven't had a chance to go to any, so that might be my 
first choice.  And many of you will be there :).

OK, time to get back to work....

Love you guys,
Branka

I might have missed this , but when checking out the 
SRL page, noticed
http://www.srl.org/scam1.html

" The Funky Techno Tribe
released posters the week of May 19th claiming that SRL would be performing at a rave
they are holding this weekend (Sat May 25th). This is a scam! These people never
contacted SRL in this instance or any other."

Im kinda curious what happened. 
please respond via email, 
especially if this thread has allready torn across SFR

It was my fault that I missed Brian on Satrurday and thus was in need of 
a ride.  I overslept, pure and simple.  Miss-understanding would have 
been a far better choice of words.  I am sorry if I have caused any 
offence; Brian is, in fact, one of the most reliable people I knnow.  Wasn't 
really paying attention to what I was writing when I wrote it.

It's a student cooperative aka co-op.  Berkeley has the oldest, largest 
co-op system in the world.  It has lots of history, including FBI files 
during the 60's, and even a racketeering suit brought on one house during 
the late 80's.  The house where the party was has a lot of ravers, and it 
is notorious for obnoxious parties.  Green Day got their start there as 
well as many other bands!

just an old co-oper,

Hi, I was wondering if anyone in the berkeley area has DOS 6 on disk that
I could uhh...borrow?
	Im trying to set up this old 386 laptop...first I put linux with X
on , but that is TERRIBLY slow, so I decided to just use dos/win3.1, 
	Does anyone know if I can just copy it from my desktop through
floppys or something?...The problem I am haveing is getting it to boot
without the <format \s> floppy. Windows is installed as well, but it says
that himem.sys is not there when it is! I have also copied my entire dos
folder over (from my desktop)as well as config.sys and autoexec.bat.

You can get electrolyte powder packets from any clinic or hospital and
put them in the water.  We used them at stanford during the last hunger
strike and they were really cheap.

It was Sunday morning, a GORGEOUS day.  I threw some pies in the front seat, 
the hamstas climbed in the back seat, and we sped off towards Pt. Molate and 
the BBQ...

Todds, Tims, Toms, Tony, et al, we all went to pick up the sound equipment 
and some more food.  Ethan provided the sound -- a very respectable system.  
We regrouped at the Point, joined by Shawna, Matt, Eric, Jeff, a couple of 
Jasons, and more.  We set things up, Matt and Eric prepared food, and we sat 
back and waited.

And the ravers came.

The sound started up with Todd Manley who threw down a short but fantastic 
set.  I got a chance to talk with Todd about a couple of his ideas for 
future sets.  I think we'll be seeing some really good stuff from this guy!  
The people gathered, ate good food, danced in the grass, and had a WONDERFUL 
time.  I tried to get the hamstas groovin, but they found a bushy spot next 
to the water and settled in for a nap.  Every time I'd try to get them 
dancing, they'd throw bits of grass at me and tell me to ... well, I won't 
tell you what they said, but I let them alone...

Tim has a grill that would get any guy's testosterone pumping.  He loaded 
the grill with goodies, loaded the goodies with his World Famous BBQ Sauce, 
loaded his forehead with lotion, and got BUSY churning out some serious 
grub.  By the end of the day the poor guy was burned out big time.  A truly 
heroic effort!

The New Moon folx set up an altar on some rocks next to the water.  A very 
nice touch.  I got my FnF tix (sorry, I only got 2), stuffed myself fool of 
food, and talked to SO MANY PEOPLE!  I was the regular social butterfly.  My 
apologies to anyone I just said a few words to before running off again.  
Y'know how little kids get when there's a lot of company over?  At first, 
they're a little shy.  Then they're running here and there playing with 
everyone.  Pretty soon they're overloaded, totally unable to sit still.  
That was me...  8)  About the only time I really sat still was to chat with 
the lovely Miss Starkey (FINALLY!).  And I also got a chance to meet Larry 
Ching and Brian Behlendorf (sp?).  Met the SFR Amazon, Marisa, and I got to 
flip through Chris' pix.  I think we'll be seeing a lot more of Chris' work 
in the future.

Leslie showed up with popsickles (WE'RE NOT WORTHY, WE'RE NOT WORTHY!)  Num, 
num!

Tom threw down excellent choons, backed up by BioJeff, Jon, and Monty.  Yow! 
 Great music!  Some of these "ravers" just sat and watched (woosies!!! ;) ), 
but I bopped around in my bare feet.  I even popped a little when the music 
got funky...  but don't tell no one...

But the star of the show: Ethan's daughter.  What a CUTEY!

Y'know, I really like the outdoor events because you can get away from the 
music and actually converse with someone if you want.  I got a chance to 
have intelligent, non-shouted, conversation with so many good people.

The sunset was soft and beautiful, and everyone cheered Nature's 
performance, but Kirsten and I both voice the opinion that it was over too 
soon.  I just wasn't ready for the sun to go down yet.  I wanted to keep 
playing.  Even Ethan's daughter (whose name escapes me) was upset -- she was 
bawling in his truck as we tried to load the gear up.

About this time I noticed some of the hamstas sitting on one of the rocks, 
wiggling their toes and watching the sun go down.  Some of them were bopping 
to the music.  Then they started pulling on their baggy jeans, bootie 
britches, and Adida jackets, packing their gear and sneaking off through the 
tall grass.  I heard them whispering about trying to find the New Moon party...

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PLEASE READ:

BTW you guys, Tony and Tim put a lot of money into this venture out of 
pocket.  I *know* there weren't enough donations made to cover the whole 
thing.  We need to work something out so these guys don't take such a heavy 
hit just to help us get together.  Perhaps there should be an additional 
donation box sitting among the food.  Perhaps the food should be in a tent 
with tickets required to chow.  I don't know, but these guys shouldn't have 
to take it so hard in the wallet doing such great work, y'know?  Just my $.02.

Over the course of the last couple hours my cover has been blown.  I have
been successfully guiling you all.  Yes, I have been in disguise.  I am not
Tony Rotundo, stout contribtor to The Scene, sort of balanced, some what
adult like character that servers fruit and smiles indiscriminantly.  I do
not put positive energy into some of the fun parties that happen in this
area.  I do not like you at all.  In fact I hate you.  And one more thing!
I shall now reveal my true identity!

I am Ted Bennett, giant among men!  Yes, it's true, Alex Bennett is my
illegitimate father.  And that's why i hate him so.  He was so mean and
cruel to me...Once he made me watch Benny Hill for 48 hours straight.  By
the end I was in love with the old bald guy.  He was soooo cute!  Boy I
hated when Benny used to slap him around...

Anyway, with that said, that explains why I'm such a loud, farting,
dripping asshole to you all.  That's why deep down my master plan is to
throw a giant gala party called A Scam for Cash And Money (ASCAM) and take
all the proceeds and move to a deserted beach in Reno.  If anyone would
like to join me, feel free, but large breasted woman need only apply.
Damn, see there I go, just like dad again.  :^(

Oh one other horrible trait: I'm sarcastic on Monday mornings, and I know
that's what hurts most.

Please, if you see me out, you can now refer to me as Ted.

:^p
TB

P.S.  Thanks to *everyone* who made it out to the BBQ Saturday.  I think I
saw some old faces I'd just *love* to see again!  ;^)

We really wanted to go to the New Moon party, becuase the weather in SF this
last weekend is as good as it gets.  New moon was cancelled, so....

After having so much fun at the Chi party, and hearing such great reviews
of the Cloud Factory party last year in Monterey, we made the trek down
for this year's Monterey party.

We went to Monterey, found that the map point was in the direction we came,
so we back tracked a bit.  The party was on an old military base that has been
shut down.  We arrived and the police were in the process of busting the party.
We hung around for awhile, talking with some people, and at around 1am we
got the directions to the 2nd location, the one that was used last year.
We got there and they told us to park off the main road to keep us from
attrracting attention.  We did, and waited for about 20 mins until we
got the word that it was okay.  We caravanned, with our headlights off,
to the location and payed 5 dollars/person to get in.  We walked down to
the cool, sandy site where they had the system setup and playing music.
We were inthe process of setting up our tent when the music stopped.  The
2nd location was busted.  Our money was refunded.

We hung out for awhile, talking with the police who were pretty friendly
and happy to see that we did not have any alcohol.  The sympathized with
us and told us how hard it was even for them to get permits for their 
police get-togethers.  They suggested minature golf.

We decided just to make the 2 hour drive back to SF.  As it turns out, CF
decided not to try another location.

All in all, a good effort by Cloud Factory, but luck was not on our side.

Dear Andy;

        First of all I have all day to debate this publicly with you & am
ready to, which is none of your business to begin with anyway.

At 02:02 PM 7/22/96 -0700, Andy Thomas wrote:

>nah, Tony's post was harmless... 

        No, it wasn't. It was all the things mentioned in my last post, and
considering it wasn't addressed to you how would you know anyway?

>that's pretty funny, *you* complaining about people sending (what you
>think should be) private responses to the list.  

        No, Andy it's not & it's also not for you to say either. All your
doing is demonstrating your similarity to a condom.

        Andy trying to pick a fight with me will get you one, and in the end
people on this list will see the truth. Your way out of line Andy, I had no
ill feelings toward you until now. I don't understand why your getting
involved with this, as I'm sure are other people, but go ahead make an ass
out of yourself by continuing to debate with me publicly a private matter I
HAD with Tony.(note past tense)

>sure, but why won't you say "positive and affirming" things like this
>publicly: 

        Involving yourself in a personal matter between two people will
usually get you responses like that. You really must be stupid, & rude so
I'll say it again for clarity, fuck you too and mind your own business. 

        Who's ass did you kiss to get on hyperreal's staff huh? you don't
deserve to be there with comments and posts like these, at least in my opinion.

ps: dude, get a life & some manners

        I was ready to let this post drop an hour ago, but if Andy continues
so will I. This is all so unnecessary, cruel, rude, bandwidth consuming,
trash, mean, unthoughtful, unfriendly, & disturbing to myself  & others. I'm
so sorry that this has had to be continued to this point ruining the spirit
of the list. BUT I WILL NOT LET SOMEONE PUBLICLY TRASH MY IDEAS, AND THEN
ANOTHER PUBLICLY & RUDELY INTERFERE WITH A PERSONAL DEBATE WHICH HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THEM, AND ON TOP, DO IT PUBLICLY.

Sincerely;
Brian

ps i hope this is the last public post i have to make regarding this issue


Sincerely
Brian

Reno? You don't know how much some of those parties make, do you? Try 
*Rio*. You are going to buy me that cottage of of the chateau right?

Ass-kissing does not get you on hyperreal's staff.  Contributing does.
Andy manages the ambient music mailing list.  If you want to contribute

Dear All;

        I'm sorry that it went this far. I had an idea to try and get people
on this list together for some fun. If someone like Ethan, or Joe Rice
...etc  had put this out there it would I feel have been a very different
picture. The lesson is don't take risks on this list, the list vultures will
get you.

        I have two F&F tickets for sale and will happily part with them, as
this feels nothing like friends & family to me. Well maybe it does, my
family always treated me as well.

Sincerely
Brian

ps what did I tell you

Hey Fam!  For a nice break today, why don't we all help out Maren with her
paper about Raves?  I know she would really appreciate your perspectives!!
So instead of arguing between us (what most brothers and sisters do, so a
little is ok, ya know?), why don't we turn that energy towards a goal?  I
sent Maren some pretty blunt (but well thought out) reponses about raves,
the media and the postive and negative aspects of our gatherings.  Those of
you who know my posts also know I had a LOT to say about the positive and
negative aspects of raving.  So I encourage you to let your voice be heard!!

Love,

Dear All;

        I won't waist any more of your time re-explaining my reasons for
leaving, you know how I feel, and I know I'm right. So it's been fun and
I've cherished many moments that I've had here with most of you. Most of you

OK, I feel like I have to say few word because I personally know Tony and 
Tim and some things that are said here are just plain wrong.

I met Tony when I started raving - 5 months ago and I think he is one of 
the most wonderful people I know.  He accepted my roomates and myself far 
better than some other people in the rave community did.  He has been 
there for me at some moments that maybe he is not even aware of when I 
had arguments (misunderstandings) with our mutual friend.
  And I would never consider myself popular, so why did he do that?

I don't knwo what Tony has done to you Brian, but although I didn't want 
to get involved with this, I feel that you are getting a little bit out 
of line.  Considering Tony so dear to me I am asking you to please stop 
this flames, because I fond them not only silly, but also rude.  If you 
have a problem with him why don't you take it privatly?  His comment 
about A. Bennet show did not sound rude (IMHO) and I think you 
over-reacted.  Relax :))).  He apologized to you and selling your tickets 
to FnF seems to be very childish act (if it's for the reason of 
popularity).  Even if you don't want to hang out with Tony I am sure 
there are many more people that you might meet and like (I am sure I am 
not on your list after standing on Tony's side, but I just wanted to say 
my opinion on this).


OK - enough said.
Hugz,
Branka

P.S.  I was considering going with you to AB show, but I hate mornings 
and getting up that early just makes me bitchy...  I do listen to him in 
the morning on the way to work, but I must admit sometimes he is too rude...

I love the hierarchy around here.  Apparently, mind you, the elite
hyperreal is not pronouced hyper-real but instead rhymes with imperial.

Joe and Ethan are not that cool.  I am.  But that's not the point.
Mr. Rice sheds in the shower every morning and never cleans out the 
clogged drain.  Worse, when he's fucking his girlfriend, he makes too
much noise.

I ate all of his chocolate chip cookies once.  He didn't give a shit.
But his fans did.  They were *pissed*.  The rule?  Don't screw famous
people.  The lesson?  Stupid ideas are a dime a dozen.

Raver encounter:  I bought a bagel from a raver.  I said "you look 
really familiar - are you a raver?"  She said saturday's wicked party 
was great and held the mayo.  

I said no sprouts, please.   She said mad props.

I say mad props to anyone who sells bagels with glitter
for eye shadow.

Dave

In addition to Ethan, it'll be Alex, myself, and either Jon Santos or Scott
Henry from NY.

I think I'll just let Mr. Alves' post slide into oblivion.

I confused Scott Henry with Scott Richmond. Scott Henry is from Baltimore
and may be playing Mad tonight. Scott Richmond the the NYC Scott.

bemusedly,

Hey all!

I had a *great* time at the bbq, thanks to all of you for showing! :) 
However, just checking to see if anybody perchance found one of those 
disposable cameras lying in the grass and picked it up.  It's obviously 
not a big deal that I lose the camera itself, but all my undeveloped 
pictures of that beautiful Sunset Boat Party were on it! :(  It's a 
unique looking camera, cuz it was a marketing gimmick from Carnival 
Cruise lines, and therefore has Carnival's logo all emblazoned on it. 
So if anybody happened to find it, please let me know!

Much thanks

Love,
Shawna

just cos YOU don't have an account .... i've noticed that hyperreal tends 
to be very cautious about who they give accounts to and was quite honored 
when they allowed me to have one to help with NW-Raves.

i, for one, suspect that some things _other_ than this mini-flame
war have been bothering brian.  i sure hope he calms down before he
gets a peptic ulcer!

Hi Everyone

Since i've just made my first post to SF Raves, it's probably about
time to introduce myself. :)

I'm Jeremy, i'm 26 and am originally from New Zealand. I've been
living in and around Sydney from 91 until two weeks ago, and raving
there and in other bits of Australia since 92. (Also this year:
Mayday X in Germany, a great little Goa party near Dunedin, New Zealand,
and a really cool night at a trance club in London. :) I've
also been a regular on the Ausrave list since it got started in 93.

Some of you know my good friend and ex-roommate, Grant (the one with
the fangs), and i've met at least one SFRaver in Sydney (heya
Crunchman!)

I'm working in San Jose. Not exactly rave central, but SF isn't that
far away. :) Does anyone know anyone looking for a rave-friendly
roommate around here?

Jeremy

Subject: And he departs, with even more hatred
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

You know what kids? I won't let this pass cause I've been wronged too long
by him. I can't believe that THX1138 (Brian) can flame me and others like he
has done in the past, and still does, and then expects us to feel sorry for
him or respect him because somebody didn't like Alex Bennett and flamed him
a bit.  Everytime he has responded to ANYTHING I have ever written here, he
fills it with lies, twists it and is just downright nasty.  NASTY!

Everytime I post something about Love or the positive/negative conflicts, he
puts "religous" labels on me, claims that I am a *&^#$^% Christian, claims
that God is evil, and insults me in front everybody!  If I mailed him
privately in the past, he would send his nasty responses to the group and
twist what I had written.  I've tried to be his friend on this site, but he
is filled with only hate towards me.  His insults have passed over the line.  
Today, I sent him a note PRIVATELY saying how I wish he would not leave the
group. I was trying to be honest with him.  Since he is convinced that I
sent it to the group, I will now.  But I do this ONLY because you all should
know EXACTLY what was said between he and I...and for no other reason.  
Here was what I wrote to him today:

****************************
Hi Brian!  I'm sorry to hear your leaving.  A few weeks ago I posted some of
my thoughts on a controversial subject.  It was about "comeunity".  I shared
my feelings and concern about what is happening with regards to positive and
negative energy.  As I recall, you were the first one to attack me...did you
ever!  You were rude, mean and downright viscious.  You told the other
posters, "this one's mine!".  You ridiculed not only my views, but my faith,
my perceptions and even my God.  You hurt me really bad with your words.
But you know what...I took it all in stride.  Even though you were obviously
upset by what I wrote from my heart, and even though you attacked every word
I wrote and flamed me brutally, I told myself that you were just pissed off
about something else and that I was getting the blunt end of it.

After that, I watched what you wrote.  You lightened up a bit after the
comeunity thing blew over and I even liked some of your latter posts
(unrelated) about finding strength in yourself.  I agreed with you.  

I honestly have no hard feelings for you, cause I know that you must be
going through some tough times or something and needed to vent.  But I ask
you now...after what you did to me, how can you justify leaving the group
because someone treated you like you treated me?  Just does not make sense.
I know you might think it dumb, but what comes around goes around.  That's
why we treat others the way we want to be treated.  It's gold.  It works!

Brian, I know you've been sick with the flu, and I know those people bummed
you out today about that silly Alex Bennett thing.  I just hope that you
will keep lookin' ahead and not let it get to you.  Your feelings were hurt,
as was your pride.  But hey bro', don't go!  I care about what you think,
and why, and when and how and all that stuff.  I know you like posting and I
know you'll miss it.  And strangely, if you go...I'll miss ya.  (Even though
we don't see eye to eye).

Think about it?

Love,

Troy
(Wowser)  

**********************************
(And here was his "lovely" response to me)

Dear Troy;

        I got your post by mistake, it should have been auto-forwarded to
the trash can.

        Troy your talking about apples and oranges. Your inital post
attacked Community in a very negative way, and without any proof(the bible
is not proof, it's fiction). (note**I NEVER METIONED THE BIBLE!) 

        My post was  an innocent post trying to get people together for a
good time; how can you compare the two. My post attacked no one, hurt no
one, it's intention was simple. There's also history here your not aware of,
and I find you weak attempt at comparison sick, and offensive. Also, your
disrespect at my request that you didn't e-mail me privately just shows how
much you are full of shit christian. You don't and can't care about anyone
except yourself, and the wicked god of yours.

        If someone asks you not to contact them and you do anyway is this
the christian thing to do. You make me sick. (note**Christian thing????)

        Don't make the mistake of e-mailing me with your tribe ever again.

brian

GEEZ!!!! So much negativity!  How about a joke to lighten things up a bit?  
One of my coworkers just told me this.

First, let me say this is JUST A JOKE!  No offense is intended to anyone of 
the Christian faith or to any lawyers or lawyers-to-be.  It struck me as 
funny so I'm passing it on...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Three lawyers are chasing a ambulance one day when their car loses control 
and slams into a telephone poll.  As other lawyers descend on the accident 
with dollar signs in their eyes, the souls of the three dead lawyers get 
misrouted and end up at the Pearly Gates.  Saint Peter immediately sees that 
there's a problem and tells the lawyers they can't enter.  Each of the 
lawyers insists that in fact they've been good little Christians and should 
be allowed to enter.

Peter says, "Ok, so you're all Christian, eh?  Ok, I'm going to ask you some 
questions, and if you can't answer, you can't enter."  The lawyers looked at 
each other, and each having received the best education litigated money can 
buy, they agreed.

Peter asked the first lawyer, "What's Christmas?"

The lawyer thought about this for a moment and replied, "That's when the... 
uh... pilgrims and the indians .... um ... they dress up in turkey suits 
and, ...eh ..."  >POOF!<  The lawyer was gone.

Peter asked the second lawyer, "What's Thanksgiving?"

The lawyer gave this some serious thought, then replied, "That's when little 
kids look for eggs, and they have football games on TV, and..."  >POOF!<  
Another lawyer gone.

Peter turned to the last lawyer, a smug look on his face, and asked, "What's 
Easter?"

The lawyer, who would be sweating if snakes had pores, did his best, 
"Easter... uh... ok, I know.... see, Christ was nailed to a cross and uh, 
then he was taken off the cross and put in a cave... and ....let's see...  
and he was in the cave for three days and... wait, I know this one...  and 
then he arose from the dead and came out of the cave... and ... uh... he saw 
his shadow and went back in the cave and there was 3 more months of 
winter..."  >POOF!<

     Well allow me to retort...
     
     Eon:
     I got to Eon at about 11:30 and the line was fairly organized.  An hour 
     and a half later, after security had inadvertently let in everybody 
     behind me, I got near the front of the line.  Right then, they carry a 
     guy out who's suffering the classic good living side effects of yacking 
     all over himself and convulsing mildly.  The security were total morons 
     (chaos, yelling and threatening is NOT an effective means of crowd 
     control), and had no fu@!ing idea about Drugs, People, Ethics, Safety, 
     Security or Organization and probably spent their high school years 
     trash-canning people who would later drive nicer cars than them.  It's 
     a good thing the cops intervened, and got the guy on his side, checked 
     vitals, looked for funky chunks in his airway, etc.  Thank you for 
     being competent.
     
     Once inside, I found a reasonably pleasant rave environ, and met up 
     with several of the brethren and sistren.  It was a pleasure to go to 
     a rave totally sober, and get some good vibe and some good music.  I 
     think the problem with most twenty-plus dollar raves is people walk in 
     with a 'SHOW ME' attitude, which is not an ingredient to a whoppin 
     fiesta de noir.  The sound was pretty, the lasers were lasing, and the 
     video screens were tasty.  I really liked the fact that the video crew 
     were actually asking if it would be cool to 'put people up' on the 
     video screens (a recent topic of controversy around these here parts).
     
     So I met a lot of your corporeal chassisssiss at BBQ&Beats despite 
     getting there really late.  I'm always pleasantly surprised by the 
     openness and acceptance by all whenever I have met SF-Ravers.  
     Everybody I met was megacool, and a SuperStrength Bomb Hug o' Mighty 
     Love to JOHN!!!  Not only has John been one of the greatest people to 
     talk to, and a proponent of goodness unadulterated, but he kicked down 
     the grand palooka of all gifts in my time of weakness... I will bring 
     vibe John, I will spread it like boysenberry preserves over toasted 
     seven grain bread.  And finally, yes it's a SF-Raves laminate, yes 
     it's my design (unofficial as it may be), no I don't dislike the ones 
     that they were selling, I'm just a social salmon sometimes and have to 
     engage in self indulgent grafikal arts and crafts from time to time 
     (shouldn't do it for a living, too colorblind they say).  Great music, 
     great company, I wish we could have stayed right there and locked that 
     vibe in all night long, or tunneled off to some epic outdoor 
     location... bummer how those permits and complaints and legal issues 
     of all flavors interrupt life's finer moments.  
     
     It was nice meeting you everybody,
     Andy W

     Safety and Sanity Tip:
     Never drive home from an Oakland rave at 5:45am if you:
     a. drive a convertible suzuki summersault and left the top at home
     b. sweat when you dance
     c. live in south san jose
     d. notice it's a little chilly walking to the car
     e. don't have a jacket

As everyone has already said, the BBQ&B2 was a great time, great people,
great strawberry and black cherry sodas etc.

Went to Hedquarters on Saturday night, a new downtempo club at the Voodoo
Lounge hosted by Tomas and Markus, who did Techsture at Cafe Abir earlier
this year. The beats are in effect here and it was fresh -  a well dressed
slightly clubby crowd, but in a good way. =) The place for headz to check
on Saturdays before the big rave, perhaps.

bsp I'll be playing there 8/3.

LOSER IN BIBLE CONTEST SOUGHT IN WINNER'S DEATH
Associated Press

DADEVILLE, ALA.-A man who lost a Bible-quoting contest is suspected of 
killing the man who beat him, police said.

Gabel Taylor, 38, was shot once in the face outside his apartment 
Thursday.  Police are searching for the suspect, whose name was not 
released.  Taylor, a minister's brother, and the suspect apparently were 
comparing their Bible knowledge outside an apartment complex, each 
quoting different versions of the same passage.  The suspect retrieved 
his Bible and realized he was wrong, witnesses said.

"He said Taylor did know more and that made him mad," police chief Terry 
Wright quoted witnesses as saying.  The man then threatened Taylor, 
saying, "I'll kill you before the night is out," Wright said.

If anyone has any leads on a couple of used Technics 1200s and/or a decent

	Hi,

	I had my "breaking-day" on Saturday: a glass in the morning,
	a cooler in the afternoon and a computer in the evening... See,
	it got worse as the day went by :(

	Yeah, I stupidly broke someone's steerofoam (sp?) cooler during
	the great BBQ ... Put my ass on, sure, that's not what it's made
	for, the poor thing just exploded.

	I really feel stupid, so if it was yours or if you know the person it
	belonged too, please get in touch.
	
	BIG thanks to Tim for this BIG event!
Renaud

Did you ever wake up in the morning and log onto SFR and find it had been
invaded by the Nasties?  That happened to me today, and I'm still trying to
wake up from this little short nightmare.  Quick, somebody pinch me!

Oh, you say your mommie used the Nasties spray and sprayed it under the bed
and in the closet, so now the Nasties are gone and they won't come back?
Well, I don't mind if they come back, because sometimes Nasties  keep our
little world interesting, but it sure would be nice if that spray just kept
'em in line a little... you know, kept them from calling people dirty
names, and it would be really cool if they could get a little sense of
humor back in the process .... You know, nice Nasties who see the world in
a different way, but don't forget their manners ...

Oh well, I guess maybe I'm still dreaming!  But let's keep those Nasties
away, ok kids?

Had a great time at the "no-name" party at the Casa Zimbabwe co-op
in Berkeley...superb buffet of different kinds of music from house to
trance and a cool trippy experimental visual "mind test" to boot!

I wasn't gonna go to the BBQ because I was feeling kinda tired after
staying out partying all night but, DANG, I'm sure glad I did go! It
was great meeting a bunch of new sfravers and seeing everyone again...
thank you Tim and the BBQ crew for organizing the perfect picnic!
Cool to hear some new fresh sfraves DJs spinning...WOW, I didn't even
know y'all were DJs, can't wait to hear ya spin again?! I've been
hearing a lot about the Hunab Ku "the Mayan calendar" lately so I
asked Dave Abel, with Gateway, what it's all about. He piqued my 
interest enough to do some research and I found a really cool
web site that gives an introduction to it. Check it out at the URL:

http://www.resonate.com/

Also, be sure to check out an article at the web site called
"Psychedelic Shamanism" by Jim DeKorne. At the URL:

http://www.resonate.com/places/articles/m_blend/dekorne.htm

On Sunday went and did the Aids walk with Robert Brown and David
Lowe from the list and had an extremely trippy but FUN day. I read
the Little Prince for the first time in my life Sunday morning before
doing the walk and for the rest of the day weird coincidences 
"synchronicities" just kept happening about every hour seemingly to
reaffirm my belief that it's necessary to try and return to that
mental state of pure innocence and love that everyone is in as a 
newborn baby. One of the more trippy coincidences included an 
unplanned stop at F8 after the walk on Haight and having Mars 
recommend to me a beautiful trance track on a label called, "Le
Petit Prince" the Little Prince!!!! Of course I had to buy it!

Peace and Love Always,
John

My friends and I were thinking of having a small house party in Davis on
August 3rd and were wondering if anybody would be interested in stopping by.
So far, this is what we have decided on:
It will be in an apartment that can comfortably accomodate 50-75 people.
The DJs will be Xpress (me) and Jeyson (FnF). Mainly house and breakbeat.
There will be a very mixed crowd and plenty of nice people.

If anybody has any input or ideas please let me know.

Thanks!

Subject: BELATED THANKS FOR OUR BBQ!!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I'm sorry for the delay in writing a total THANK YOU!!! to Tim and Tony and
everyone whose efforts made the Saturday BBQ such a success!!

Unfortunately I couldn't get there until 6:30 (hey, at least the Giants
beat the Dodgers!), and I was so psyched to see how many happy faces were
there having a great time!  I apologize for so greatly underestimating how
many popsicles you guys could suck down on a scorching day!  Next time,
I'll bring LOTS more!!

Now, I hope people don't mind, but since Tim was our total
slave-labor-of-love all day, getting up at the crack of dawn, schlepping
his HUGE barbecue, then cooking all day long, then staying until the very
end to clean up ... I promised him that we would repay him with MAJOR
massages ...

So how about at Friends and Family that each and every SFRaver who had fun
due to his efforts, would give him a 10 minute massage (more if you;re
loving it as much as he will!) -- just picture, poor tired Tim, laying in
the chill space, a smirk on his face as someone has his left arm, someone
his right, one on each leg, and someone putting him into bliss with a
face/head/neck massage ...  he'd be a happy man, and he'd know how much we
appreciate his work on our behalf!

So let's show him our thanks .... of course not to leave out Tony's great
work, and all the djs and equipment people who made our music possible, and
the great banner, and the awesome food ... I can hardly wait until next
time!

(p.s.  In case you missed my obnoxious nagging for donations, any
additional supplemental cash would be helpful to replenish the
out-of-pocket expense that Tim and Tony personally took on -- just a couple
bucks apiece would be well worth it, more if you can -- any overages would
be applied to our next picnic!)

Anyway, Saturday was a reminder to me of how many wonderful friends I've
made through SFR, and how thankful I am to be part of this group!!!!!
YESSSS!!!

Love, Leslie

FTT were reasonably upfront about it, with a message on their VM and a 
sign up at the event saying no SRL.  No info about where the original 
claim cam from.  The party seemed a bit of a scam in some other 
respects...half the promised DJs were never produced, for example.

Dear All;

        A very close friend who is far away told me I should do this.

        Regarding why I'm acting like such a shit. I've been sick, sick with
the flu for over a week, combined with a sinus inflection which either
forces my left eye closed or blurs it's vision with mucus, in the process of
self with-drawing from a 6 month Heroin addiction, and today I just found
out I have an inflected root canal that screams at me. 

        My head is splitting in half, I feel so bad I want to die, I spend
the day sitting on the toilet with a bucket in my hand, I'm running a 100
degree temperature, and have all the pain associated with the flu. I can't
remember when or what I ate last, but it doesn't matter my sinuses just
drain all day long and this seems to take care of my hunger. I have nightly
nightmares about people physically torturing me; that's when I can sleep.

        I don't get any visitors except the postal person. E-Mail was my
only form of contact until everyone started jumping on my shit for an
innocent post. I had people who I opened my home to, given free massages to
and taken all around the city tell me there glad I'm un subbed from the list
rather than ask what's wrong. People posting private messages publicly that
I sent to them behind my back; twisting them so they can appear cool. People
getting involved in personal battles that have nothing to do with them, and
having others support them. A lot of these so called friends I've personally
helped out with either rides, money and/or assistance on more than one
occasion. Others taking advantage of my depleted state and trying to steal
money/property from me. Oh, and others to  busy checking my spelling; hey
you forgot my grammar.

        Yet, where are you now huh; busy kicking me when I'm down & in one
of my darkest hours that's where they are; and you wonder why I'm so bitter,
and angry. So when you say we didn't know, I'l say you never asked, just
jumped on my shit; I fight pretty good for the vegetable that I'm right now.
Just goes to show you can't keep a good man down.

Sincerely & Back To Un subscribed Land
Brian

Good day,

>>Tribal Future!  (They *loved* it!) The Tie-Dyed Side of the Force

Apparently, BBQ & Beats was also a score in this area.  A friend I forgot I had even told
about this event showed up and had a great time. Thanks for sending great vibes to
the newbie everyone!

Hi all!

 First;
 
I'm really unhappy that I missed BBQ & Beats. :(  Sounds like a great 
time with great people. I really wanted to go but forces held me back.

 Second;

I hope everyone is feeling better! A lot of people (myself included) are 
going through some turbulent and difficult times and I think a little 
patience is very healing for all of us. I really want to bless everyone 
with hope, health and good vibes.

 Third (and finally);

Some BSP next folks: It seems that Dionysus Dreams will be performing on 
Thursday, July 25th for Galactic New Years Eve, Green Day 1996. I'm very 
serious in saying that this will be an extra-dimensional affair!!!  =) 
A lot of personal effort and pride is going into making this an intimate 
yet expansive party that will help you dance and see the cosmos in a 
unique way.
 We are currently looking for someone to assist me in transporting 
equipment. We will pay your gas and you get to experience the party 
without paying the door admission.

Here are the particulars:

Driver needs to meet me at UCSC at 1pm sharp, on Wendsday-July 24. From 
there we drive a short ways to my storage facility and pick up audio and 
lighting gear. Then it is off to SF to set up for the party. I will be 
spending the night in SF. Driver must commit to hauling me and equipment 
back on Friday (say  8-9 am or so). We can accomadate driver if they wish 
to stay overnight on Wendsday. Vehicle must be a van or pickup with 
camper shell (or like hauling vehicle). Decision will be made on Tuesday 
evening as to driver. I don't need someone to do any lifting.

 We are checking into other sources for transportation but I posted this 
notice as we are trying to cover all possibilities. Info line is 415-646-0751
Party is from noon Thursday to 6 am Friday. Free glph and tribe readings 
to help cope with the memory virus.

DJs are;
Dutch			Andrew               
Surge			Bonny
Radley			Jason
Theta Blip		Neil
Tracy

and the inevitable special guests (like me!)
Didjeridus and drums are invited!!


Peace out



Ran                          ( oh yea!!! )
                                  /

	Saturday night I went to Big Heart City with my bro' P.
to hear Felix and Thomas spin together on four turntables,
with two mixers.  It was unbelievable.  Toward the end of the set they had
developed a powerful rapour.  In the beginning of the set, they kept
interrupting the beats in a painful, almost aggressive way.  I felt like a
victim, listening and trying to dance to that. Toward the middle of the
set the flow took over. 

I moved closer to the dj's, so that I could see what they were doing. I
went into some kind of trance in which I
was completely focused on the music, and what it was telling my body.  I
felt like I was swimming in air.  I wasn't paying any attention at all to
the people around me.  

I tried to shake myself out of the trance to look at how the other people
were responding.  There were many different rhythms in the music, and it
seemed that people were grooving to different beats.  People were doing
different dance styles.  Many people were dancing with their eyes closed,
with looks of deep concentration on their faces.  

Felix and Thomas were
jumping from record box to turntable looking totally psyched about the
musical pastiche they were creating.  They were mixing like fiends,
playing bits of records over other bits, switching from record to record
so fast that that nothing sounded like it "normally" does when you hear
the whole unadulterated track.  

Recently I started trying to play and mix ambient music, and just a couple
of hours on the decks have given me a new appreciation for how complex the
dj art can be.  And it made the transition that dj's often make from
playing records to making records seem so much more natural and obvious.

Last year around this time I heard Felix play before dawn at a New Moon
party.  I could tell then that he has an unusual gift with music.  I heard
him a few times at Roots after that, but the setting wasn't perfect- the
club had a
system downstairs that bled through to the lounge where Felix was playing.
He told me once he wasn't happy with that.

At Big Heart City there was no such problem.  He and Thomas were playing
on a long, wooden coffin suspended from the ceiling.  It was a trip
watching it sway gently every time they dropped a new record onto a
turntable.

Getting to dance to this set was worth every penny of the $14 I paid to
get into the club!  Can't wait for another chance to hear these guys do it
again.  Makes me want to buy a fuckn' DAT recorder.

-Ann

 my Florida eyes, consulted each other..are you seeing what im seeing. I 
have biked up Panoramic to the top of Strawberry Canyon, again. Waiting up 
there is usually what is down here- the East Bay/Bay/City/Headlands and 
anything possible obliged to sight, not imagination.  Usually.

 Tonight I am lost above the lingering fog. I have walked in on a 
sleep-over. Where Alameda/Oakland once burned in the night, two children 
hide under cotton-candy covers, flashlights selling secrets to the night. 
Not far across the bed, Berkeley has fallen to Pirates whose treasure glow  

stolen from the black Pacific City and its Gate. The room is oblivious to 
me 
and the stars above.

  I will close the door and come in through the window. Both hands tied 
behind my back,reason and rational kneel before passion. I have turned my 
head upside down....stars become starfish and above me ....above me 
mother-of-pearl has fed milk to the grateful skye..and me   I am drowning.

 
  are you here?

Hello everyone-

 WOW!  I would just like to say that I loved everything about the whole event.  
Thanks need to be given out to all those people who helped in whatever way; 
from those who organized from the beginning to the people who helped clean up 
as things were winding down.  Being part of this group has opened my heart up 
to many new people, and meeting some of you at the BBQ was a great experience.  
 Personally, I'd like to thank Tim for the use of his BBQ, Ethan for the sound, 
and the whole group for allowing me the opportunity to dj.  There are many more 
people I'd like to thank, but I can't seem to remember everybody at this 
moment.  I'm sure there are many of you that I didn't get the opportunity to 
meet, but if you remember seeing a tall guy (6'9") wearing a Wimbeldon tennis 
shirt, then you know who I am.  Now I need to meet the rest of you at FnF!  See 
you there:)

-Todd

I love Eudora email.  All you have to do is point your mouse and hit
subject.  It gathers all the post that are the same title.   Then
highlight, and push delete.   That simple!

Help save me from my horrible sadness:

I went to Primal and Ameba and found no tickets (I know, me and everybody
else who missed the BBQ).  If anybody has extras to sell, please call or
email.  I'm getting ready to move to Tokyo for a year on August 1 and this
will be my last weekend in SF; I was hoping to go out with a bang and make
it a F&F weekend...  (Hopefully I might be able to locate an extra for my
friend who's coming up from L.A. to see me off, too.)

Leave me a message at 510-450-0257 or email (I check it frequently).
Thanks for your help,

Mike

P.S.  You folks might not recognize my name from the list, as I don't have
time to keep up with the email flow, but a lot of you've probably seen me
at parties over the last few years since I moved out here from Detroit.

>Just a thought :)

I agree.  Here's another.

Sometimes, sfraves can seem like a virtual community, but this
list is mainly a forum for communication.  Which is still a very
wonderful thing.  But as a "community", there are limitations as
to what we can expect from it.  Sure, we can comfort, entertain,
inform, and even insult each other.  BUt I think it is unfair to
expect sfraves to be a place where deep serious problems of a
personal nature can be resolved, or even helped to a significant
degree.  Likewise, it is unfair for someone to expect this list
to be a place where such problems can be catered to.  Like others
have pointed out in the past (JS Lee) we really can't even expect
to get to know each other very well through this forum.

There are other places in our society where serious cries for
attention/help are served.  And if these are inadequate, there
is little this list can do about it.  Well perhaps there is.  If
anyone here is truly moved to help someone who expresses a need,
they do have the option of getting personally involved, though I
would hope that they truly understand what it is they are getting
into.  Serious problems require serious action.  Writing that
you care/love/forgive someone, welcoming their rants and tolerating
selfdestructive behavior... that's kinda like throwing a bum a quarter
so they can buy another bottle of wine.

But then there are a lot of people who really thing they are helping
when they do that too.  Anyway, sorry for preaching; looking forward
to sharing lot's of positive energy at F&F and beyond.

Lee

hello all-

this is matt's happy message for the day, hopefully i won't get blasted
for this one and start a chain reaction like i did yesterday (oops!)

mad was wonderful last night!  got to see several wonderful dj's, and
see several wonderful sfravers (shawna, mike, sarvi, jan, jonathan,
michael clay, wayne, etc).

i hope your tuesday treats you better than my monday did, and i repeat
my mantra: "let us remember to bring into the week what we do over the
weekend (love!)".

enough said-

love-

matt l

Don't be fooled.  Although the Official DPT vehicles look like overgrown
tricycles, they are actually state-of-the-art Urban Assult Units designed
by Lockheed.  I mean, where do you think all the money for those 2.2 million
traffic tickets are going?  DPT is quietly building an covert army to
take over this city.  You see them all lines up, poised for battle down
on Harrison street.  Under that flimsly-looking sheet-metal skin are
dual, side-mounted 50mm rotary cannons, 2 surface-to-air missles that
can take out an F-14, 4 anti-tank/Hummer projectiles... they are tied
to an advance radar system that can track several targets at once.  All
of this packaged in a tiny, highly manueverable vehicle that can run
circles around M-1 tanks that are stuck in traffic.  Yes, when the DPT
fist comes down on this city, nothing will stop them.  We will be forced
to hail the New World DPT Order, lest be destroyed by the best technology
parking ticket money can buy.

     Bar humor......
     
     
     A very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at 
     the bar.  After an hour of gathering up his courage he finally goes 
     over to her and asks, tentatively, "Um, would you mind if I chatted 
     with you for a while?" To which she responds by yelling, at the top of 
     her lungs, "No, I won't sleep with you tonight!" Everyone in the bar 
     is now staring at them.  Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and 
     completely embarrassed and
     he slinks back to his table.
     
     After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes.
     She smiles at him and says, "I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.  You see, 
     I'm a graduate student in psychology and I'm studying how people 
     respond
     to embarrassing situations."
     
     To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, "What do you mean 
     $200?"
     
     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     
For decades, two heroic statues, one male and one female, faced each other in a 
city park, until one day an angel came down from heaven.

"You've been such exemplary statues," he announced to them, "That
I'm going to give you a special gift.  I'm going to bring you both to life for 
thirty minutes, in which you can do anything you want."
And with a clap of his hands, the angel brought the statues to life.

The two approached each other a bit shyly, but soon dashed for the bushes, from 
which shortly emerged a good deal of giggling, laughter, and shaking of 
branches.  Fifteen minutes later, the two statues emerged from the bushes, wide 
grins on their faces.

"You still have fifteen more minutes," said the angel, winking at them.

Grinning even more widely the female statue turned to the male statue and said, 
"Great!  Only this time you hold the pigeon down and I'll crap on its head."

Hee hee. I'm sorry I missed it. Anyone who knows me knows
how I feel about DJs cutting it up and working the mix. I
know it's not for everyone, but I just love it when a DJ
shreds two songs apart and puts them together in new and
unusual ways. People like Jeff Mills and Claude Young, or 
even Carl Craig are good examples of what I'm talking about.

The problem with this medium is that you can not see a persons body 
language, the expression on their face, or the look in their eyes. 
However I respectfully disagree that we can't get to know one another 
through the list or with this form of communication in general. Even with 
it's limitations, this manner of expressing ourselves allows for one 
important advantage; that is to organize ones thoughts and feelings 
before expressing them. I would wholeheartedly agree however, that 
sometimes people don't bother to take the time to do so.

Sunny, if you need any help rolling a few of those pups into the Bay,   
gimme a call.  Also, hot tip I learned dealing with parking folks in Ann   
Arbor:  for just a few dollars, you can buy a handy little tool at a bike   
store that will let you unscrew the valve from a tire, like, say, a meter   
reader's tire (hypothetically), in just a couple of seconds.  And you   
know how busy they are when they are going down a row writing tickets...   
it's pretty easy to duck down next to their vehicle (which is probably   
parked illegally as they go down the row), and have that valve out in no   
time.  Seems to slow them down a bit.

Not that I would _ever_ advocate such... such... good, therapeutic fun...
;)

Sorry for anyone that came from far away to our party.  It's not directly 
our fault but we do feel bad for having people come from all over.  I 
hope everyone made it home ok, and hope you'll give us another try 
sometime =)

We are having a camping trip in September, so maybe you can make it out then.

love scott

ps We got busted twice and decided at about 2:30 not to keep trying, but 
we haven't really been shut down before so we figured maybe our time had 
come karmically and we needed to just chill.  =)

Have a good week.

ehm, yeah, so I missed the BBQ too (Mrs. Frying Dutchman requested to spend
the weekend with the two of us, thanx though to fellow SFRaver Thomas
Schwartz for offering us a ride [Vielleicht werden wir uns irgendwo anders
begegnen, Thomas?]) So what's the deal with these tix, I haven't seen
anything posted about them on the list, are people getting response by
private E-mail? We're having NRR friends over from Holland for the next
two weeks so I'm not sure if I will be able to attend, I just want to
keep my options open for next weekend...

The Frying Dutchman (sign: Taurus, pretty rare on the list it seems, I saw
only one other (David?), I wonder what that means...Eric, am I doomed?)

Yeah, when they first got on things were a bit silly, we should have given
them a little more time to get going... 

We got there early in hopes of getting some of the promised freebies and
the cheaper cover ($12).  Caught part of Anna's (?) set, which was fine,
and Gavin's set, which was really good until he ruined it at the end with
two really lame vocal tracks that were bordering on rock, bummer.  DJ
Spooky (that subliminal kid) was on next, who started with some heavy
jungle (which went on a little too long for me), and then got into more of
a nice hip/tr*p-hop groove later on.  His set was interesting, but I got
the impression he didn't know the music that well, some of the mixes were
rediculously abrupt.  But overall, it was cool...

the turntable setup was nice (although the flyer/voicemail promised 6
turntables, but I can't really see anyone putting to use more than 4
really...), and the sound system was more than adequate, maybe just a
little too bass heavy though...

definitely, hopefully we'll see more events that give dj's a chance to be
a bit more experimental...

Greetings Friends!

Regarding FnF tix... the sad truth is that they sold out almost instantly.
We had hoped to be able to put some in ameba or primal but after the bbq
there were simply none left, and the prospect of telling the people that
came out in force to get them at the bbq, "Sorry, wait till tuseday, then
go to ameba" seemed ludicrous...

We did offer (and deliver!) mail order for people that would have a hard
time getting here from wherever. I got 3 orders... kind of surprised me.

In any event, there *are* tickets out there in the community, so ask
around, and good luck =)

take it easy

Count me in that group.  Boy, I always thought everyone was a Taurus!
Well, heres a piece of trivia for you about the greatest show on TV :
Sailor Moon!  None, not one, nada, zip, nil, zero of the Sailor Scouts
are Taurus'.  Not even my favorite bull-headed flame-thrower, Sailor
Mars.

Well, I thought it was important ;-)

Every so often the subject of SFR t-shirts comes up. People seem to be
interested but the topic always eventually dies out. SoCal Raves has 'em...
NW Raves is considering 'em...

Well, I'm going to be making a bunch as a favor to all y'all (and because I
enjoy silkscreening)... I finished preparing the screens yesterday, and
I'll have a bagful of printed T's ready by FnF this weekend. If you want
one at FnF, e-mail me by early Friday afternoon and tell me what size,
color, etc. The place where I'm buying them has pretty much any color you'd
want, and they're cheap too. I'm buying them for about $3.99 per shirt, so
if you could give me 3 or 4 bucks for 'em that would help (I don't like
charging, but I'd like to come close to breaking even).

The design is posted on my website, at www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lachim. Look
in the gallery section under "illustrator work." The final size is about 5
or 6 inches square, right on the center of the chest, like all those shirts
the hip daddy-O skater boys and skater girls are wearing these days.

I think they'll look really good in green.

OK, while we're on the topis of trivia, I was born on the 17th of may,
and so was my brother, though he was born five years before me. I was
his birthday present (hehe, he was _really_ happy I guess ;-).
Another weird numerical coincedence is that my dad died on the same
day as his dad (though later) and that on the same day (this year) I will
fly back to Holland (getting real nervous here)...

I am NOT spinning at Lust for Life. A month ago they asked if the could
book me in the event tht FnF didn't happen (we didn't yet have a space at
that time). However FnF *is* happening... =)

Would be nice if they took me off their voice mail though...

see ya

you know, I owe alot of tickets too...I was just thinking as I crossed the
street to my house today, and I saw a mini fleet of these pesky obnoxious
menaces driving by me I had the thought that someone should go by their
den late at night and plant little bombs in each one of them. I live 1/2
block away from the den in berkeley, any takers?

Did you guys know that at the Durant/Channing parking structure in
Berkeley, the meter bastards drive around in little golf carts that say
CUSTOMER SERVICE on them?

Aren't we lucky more places don't provide quality customer service...

OK, gang, many of you have responded, and I'm keeping all the info
together.  By the end of this week, I'll start counting, and I'll post a
list, sorted from most members of one sign to fewest.  Finally, I'm putting
my accounting skills to good use ;)
So far, it looks like there are more Aquarians than any other, with
Scorpios and Pisces also well represented.  Keep 'em coming!

Thanks, and peace,

Thanks for a thoughtful response about the moolah issue, Tim.  I'd like to
suggest that we begin discussing the overall issue among ourselves and
think about where we want to go with it ....   and in the meantime ... Tim
and Tony, please think about how much out-of-pocket you are from Saturday
(beyond what you might have spent anyway on your share of "potluck"
donations to the feast, of course) and maybe accept some reimbursement of
that now from the offerers.   Then we can talk about our fiduciary setup
for later.

Actually, I am too!  Just caught the tail end of this thread, since I've

know a bunch of ravers who are Geminis as well, although they are severely

hello all-

this thursday night, matt is sponsoring (i.e. arranging but not
financing) a sushi night at ebisu sushi on 9'th avenue and lincoln.

we'll meet around 8 pm (i'll be there around 6:30 getting a table) and
eat wonderful sushi and have a good old time.

we've done this twice before, and it's been fun both times.  anyone
interested, please let me know as soon as possible so i can make
reservations.

bring friends, random people (one person brought randall schwartz, for
all you perl hackers!)

love-

If you are going to BurningMan  then  blow off the driving,  take the =

 InfoFlow,  in collaboration  with many others,  has reserved an =
entire train  for a private party with  rave DJ's ,  The Mermen, and =
more, entertaining us to the  Burning Man festival on Friday Aug 30th =
and returning  on Monday Sept 2nd.  The train route is from  Oakland, =
CA  to  Gerlach, N.V.  and hopefully right to  Trego Springs at the =
lakebed edge of the Black Rock playa. Then transport from the train =
to the camp. 

 This private train trip includes:
 food  & drink on the  train,
 music
 other entertainment,  
breakfast on the weekend
a  ticket to BurningMan. 
Truck for oversize items and bicycles and anything not fitting on the =
train

 What you are not convinced yet? 
Imagine how relaxed you could be  by  traveling  by  train instead of =
by car. No car no hassles, no playa damage, no dust  to wreck your =

that  great talent to listen to. 

It's really the only way to go. 

Information about the train: 
The trains is a specially chartered  Western special with 3  Amtrak =
passenger cars, 2 deluxe private viewing  bubble cars (the Indian =
Chiefs), and our  own engine. The  train is exclusively for =
BurningMan and only contains those going to the festival. 
Smoking of all types is allowed. We will have a non smoking car as =

Each car is equipped  with a bathroom, and the private cars have a =

Sounds cool, but Space Children's party, The Juggernaut Festival is the 
same day.  Barada live, Sleepy C, Terry Mullan, etc. etc. etc. (I could 
go on all day but you could probably just look at spacechildren.com) :)
... and a phat jungle room too! :)  I just don't think I could miss that 
for anything...   If you make it another day, I'll be sure to make it 
though...

what?? what's up with that? Tickets were scarce. I hold no animosity
towards anyone, it's just my opinion. Please don't post a "flame alert"

Alterations to the previous post, of which the significant portion is below.

 My sound system does not need to come with me so I can ride in a smaller 
vehicle. I still need to bring some stuff so the vehicle in question 
should be somewhat roomy. Am also willing to consider pickups without 
shells at this point. Time, due to neccessity, is more flexible now so if 
anyone is interested send me your phone # so we can work out the nitty 
gritty stuff.

 Thanks to the folks who maintain this list and help bring about special 
events like this one!!!   =)

        Hello all,

        My apologies for the confusion with the DJ line-up for Lust
        for Life. As Ethan mentioned, it was originally planned that
        he would play, but now with Friends & Family happening that's
        not the case.

        The entry on the calendar has been changed to reflect the
        current line-up, and I'll make sure the voice mail gets updated
        tomorrow.

        Gary

At a liberal estemate (i.e by the time you've gone shopping, smoked a few 
joints and then smoked another one just to be sure that's four hours 
gone right there) it is eight hours on the freeway and four hours once 
your off it.  And remember: not even insects live out there so under no 
circumstances go off-road onto the dessert floor at night.  Distances and 
angles are real deceptive out there and just because it appears to be just
over there it's nine-and-a-haf times out of ten not.  The best time to 
get there (that is where you have to go over the railroad just before you 
get onto the floor) is right at dawn.  Travel all night on the freeway 
becauuse, obviously, their be less traffic and Bob is your uncle.
  It's a clear run all the way to the State line and then rudeuce your speed
 for 
the last two  and then turn off and party time is just around the 
corner.  Please: do not speed in Navada, do not have no/out of date 
driver's license, do not have a warrent out for arrest and make sure that 
you stash your stash well; remember to talk about where it all is before 
you set out on your journey, what you are going to tell the cops as far 
as where you are going etc and have all your documents readily at hand.  
Providing all these are in order and the cop has told you why he has 
stopped you in the first place he has no right what so ever to search you 
or your vechile nor does he have the right to detain you while they send 
for a sniffer dog.  In Navada an eigth will get you a manditory six month 
sentence even if it's your first offence and your car will just be a 
memory.  But don't worry, I've been to Burning Man for the last four 
years and not heard of a single on-sight arrest. 
More helpful Burning Man tips to come from your friends at united way.

Reply-To: South East Rave List <SERAVES@AMERICAN.EDU>
To: Multiple recipients of list SERAVES <SERAVES@AMERICAN.EDU>

on behalf of some of the djs that r looking for bookings by placing a
posting on the internet, i'd like to pitch in 2 pennies and let everyone
know how i feel.

first of all, i respect those djs & commend them for using an effective
media, the internet in an effort to try and reach as many ppl as possible
on seraves & any other parts of the world.  it shows that they're trying
hard to let everyone know that they want to introduce their talents to your
areas.  if you're interested hearing their gig live, we as ppl with
internet access ought to put a few words into our promoters & let them know
that dj so & so is looking for bookings.  regardless of whether if it's dj
joe smith, or if it's someone with a well-developed reputation such as
orbital or photek, everyone has their highs' and lows in their lives, and
are trying hard to let everyone know that they're interested in doing a gig
in your town.  so i think everyone should have a fair chance in letting
everyone know that they're interested in doing a gig.

secondly, for those of u who r so frustrated with such postings, with a
click of a mouse, u can hit delete & trash the posting, and *NOT* send
prank mail to them by letting them know that u don't want them putting up
such postings.  yeah, it may get on your nerves in your perspective, but
not everyone is like that.  i'm always on the look, and i'd like 2 support
as many ppl as i can if they're lookin' for gigs in an effort to introduce
new talents into our scene & other outta town scenes if they may b
interested.

so please, all i ask is that u all give everyone a chance, and don't
bombard them with negative e-mail or bad-mouth them when they're trying
hard to get a gig to introduce new talents in your scene, okay?


cheers,


seul    :)

I don't think it's accurate to say that you hvae to be in the family to get
in.  I'm hardly known, but I was at the right place at the right time.  I
suspect that whoever printed the tickets had no idea how fast they'd go.
Keep asking if anyone has one they can sell/trade/whatever; chances are one
will pop up at the last minute, if not sooner...

Well, I was gonna just list the signs and the number of people born under

Ethan made available the option of mail-ordering tickets if you couldn't 
get them.  However, people didn't capitalize on this fact.  Also, who was 
to know that the tickets were going to sell out at the BBQ.  Actually you 
had an advantage of knowing about the party over the internet, which many 
people don't.

FnF is a *very* popular party.  It sells out faster and faster each 
time.  Tickets were spread out the best they could have been.  You really 
can't control the "consumers."  I realized this last time when I almost 
didn't get a ticket.  So next time you can prepare for this.

However, don't give up hope.  Lots 
of tickets become available the night of the party because that is when 
people know for sure if they have extras.  Last time Purple Tiger 
(haven't seen him post in a very long time) arranged all of these extra 
tickets and set people up the night of the show.  All my friends got 
tickets this way.

I understand your angst, but, dare I say, I think it's a bit mis-directed.

I should add, that it's too bad our dates ended up coinciding, cos I was
actually pretty psyched for Lust for Life; really nice folks throwing this
party, hope I get a chance to work with them some other time =)

take it easy

Is hyperreal sending out 2 of every post or is it just me. I've been
getting 2 of every public post.

Dear All;

        I'm very happy to say that the H left my body 24 - 48 hours ago, and
it's a memory at this point. This is one of my greatest personal victories,
for I rank this up there with dropping out of high school in the 10th grade
and going on to collage to finally become an Electrical Engineer. 

        I have no psychological or physical craving for it, because I was
only physically addicted to it. I'm still very sick however with this very
nasty bug that appears to be going around. I'm not leaving my house even
though I've been stuck in here since the end of the weekend, because I just
refuse to past this awful, awful bug onto anyone else. 

        On the bright side, my siamese cats Ernesto Kitty, & Archimedes are
in 7th Heaven because they get to lie around on top of me all day. I hope to
be out by the weekend if not sooner.

        Thanks for all the wonderful e-mail everyone; there are many people
on this list like Eric, Roy, KCRoy, Leslie, Tim, Tom, JDub, Tristian, DJ
Tom, Matt, Tony Rose, Geoff White, Martin, Artoo 99, Joe Rice, Raven,
Maureen, and yes Niels P. Mayer who ****I***** think know and understand a
lot more about what PLUR is about than many of our lists so call
"contributors"; and that we including myself could learn a lot from them.

        I'm so shocked at the level of hatred, cruelty, & negativity from
some of the people on this list who talk about PLUR that it totally appalls
me. Despite my history or anyone elses for that matter; two wrongs don't
make a right. What ever happened to lead by example, or does that just apply
to negativity? I've gotten some awful responses from people who I've never
even met me, and I'm sorry I just don't & can't understand your cruelty,
because that all it is. Like sharks smelling blood, it really makes me sick.
Does it make you feel good to be cruel to another human being that you don't
even know? I felt bad with regard to Wowser, but then again I didn't attack
anyone, state any beliefs, PUBLICLY accuse anyone or any organization, in
fact I just asked for people to get together for what I thought would be a
good time; with the added benefit of bringing more Techno awareness to a
section of the public which have no idea what they are missing.

        Whether or not Tony's post was humor, or an insult is not the
question. It was a PUBLIC post devoid of positivity, with no indication of
it's tone or intention ...eg smiley faces. I'll take responsibility and
limit my apology to list for not checking it out with him further, but
that's all. However, me mother(intentionally written that way) always told
me that if I didn't have anything nice to say, not to say anything at all. I
wished at this point I would have listened to her, as I wish Tony would have
listened to his mother. As for the rest of the people who chose to get
involved PUBLICLY you were wrong, & rude for doing so, and you know it.
Tony's response should have been private, not public. Yet I was made to feel
like the bad guy for posting it at all, I didn't know Tony & Andy ran this list.

        I noticed that anytime someone sent me a negative post, their
friends like Andy & Tony ...etc were copied, what's that about huh? I'm
actually glad that this happened for it clarified my relationship status
regarding certain list person/s who I have been nothing but kind(money,
shelter, time & energy) to, I'm glad you showed your true colors. Tell me
how does it feel to be cruel to someone who opened up their home, life, &
heart to you?

        Enough of that, it's my day today, and I'm VERY, VERY HAPPY to have
SUCCESSFULLY gotten through my ordeal, and am SO MUCH STRONGER as a result.
I got more excellent news this morning from the Burning Man staff; that they
definitely want me to be at Burning Man as a Black Rock Ranger. So look for
me setting up both the Rave & the Main Camps Electrical Systems; as well as
working in the Camp/s First Aid Areas hopefully giving away free massage as
opposed to having to save peoples lives. 

        As for the F&F tickets I understand that people really want to go to
this hyped up event to feel that so called Family vibe. I however am so
disheartened & disillusioned by the fact that a lot of you only seem to care
about the tickets(what can I get from you) rather than the human being(PLUR)
holding them that I've decided to most likely either give them away to two
people on the street who have never been to a Rave before, or end up going
myself. I actually have had a few people who have flamed me either recently
or in the past who are asking me for these tickets, my only response to
these sad individuals is do you really thing I'm that dumb.

        Thanks once again to all the beautiful people who practiced PLUR
instead of talking about it. If I forgot to mention your name, my heart has
not forgotten you and I'm sure fate will bring us together eventually. I
will not entertain anymore posts regarding this, if you sent me a negative
post your name was added to my trash can list as I hope my name was added to
yours. I just hope that when we finally meet in person, that you, as I, will
put aside our past virtual disagreements and try to be kind to one another.
This always feels much better than what has been happening as of late.

        It seems, and to my surprise more people than I thought really care
about what I have to say, enjoy my humor, as well as my and uncompromising
honesty, & sincerity so I will for the time being remain on this list.

        Hope to see you out at a Trance thang this weekend if I'm better.

Sincerely;
Brian

Then,  also in Seattle from 10th - 21st aug.   Anything going on up

P,

Just wait until parking amnesty day arrives,(about ever other year in 
July.) You can pay off tickets really cheaply.

Dear Tony;

        I had to pull dis one from the can, I'm glad I did.
Mannnnnnnnnnnn!!! to quote Ulrike; you need to be hella careful what you
say, who you address it to, and whether is public or private. Yeah, I'm
hyper sensitive I know, I like being hyper-sensitive Tony there's a world
universe out there most peoples aren't even aware of, and I never would have
discovered  it if I wasn't.

        Tony some people have been so kicked around, & so abused you just
can't joke with them unless you know them very, very well. I'm one of those
people. I wish man that I could go out there with a light heart, and trust
and embrace the world; yet every time I do someone comes along and does it
to me again.

        Your apology is excepted, but I still think your actions, even in
humor were at best unnecessary.

Sincerely;
Brian

hello all-

just saying hello for the day!  i'm kinda tired and am having a dreary day
today (too much work, not enough sleep, bills, you know, the usual!)

i hope your days are treating you well, better than mine, but i look
foreward to seeing whoever is going to friends and family, for i will be
there hanging in the chill space as i most often do.

by the way-  the sushi offer is still up!  i've heard from diana greer,
leslie, and brandon.  anyone else interested in joining this fine crew for a
night of fishy debauchery?

love and all that other mushy stuff-

To anybody who bought in bulk and may end up having a ticket to spare, as 
tends to be the case, you can add my name to the growing list of have-nots. 
Here's what I'll gladly trade for one (1) laminate :

* $5. cash.
* DJ Dan :Chicago: 2/4/95: 80min audio from soundboard : A really good 
night for the guy, better than anything he's done recentlly. It's not 
harder tech - no, but it does have a beat that the kids can dance to.
* a black & white roxie cinema 'Naked Killer' poster. 
* Longshot #1 : Art Adams first work at Marvel Comics. Kinda odd on some 
panels, but still a great comic.
* that Deee-Lite booklet flyer from 2 years ago: The show never happened 
but the flyer stands out in my mind as being one of the more unique  
things put together.
* Beastie Boys 11/24/92 LA video. Second to the last show on the Check 
Your Head tour. Has real good interaction between the Beasties & the 
crowd. Good for doing your morning areobics to or just a good excuse to 
bounce around your living room.
* 2 orange ninjas

that's really all I could come up with at the moment. If this means 
anything to anybody out there I'd like to hear from you. thanks -

Mike Bolger.

Hi Crunchman,
there is a mailing list called nwraves...I don't have the address but you
might find it on the sfraves website.  I'm not sure about specific parties
coming up, though there are several parties every week in Seattle.  As far
as ongoinf events, I highly recommend Electrolush on friday nights at the
Showbox...there's nothin like it!  There's also an ongoing acid-jazz thingy
on wednesday nights at the Crocodile Cafe on 2nd, and another moday nights
at Moe on Pike.

Cc: tgrigsby@best.com

Precedence: bulk

Yesterday I posted that the design for the SFR shirts was on my web-page;

it is, but it turns out that the staff of the OCF (my server) is in the
middle of moving files to and fro, so web pages will be "up and down over
the next few days." Sorry for the inconvenience, it really is a nice
design!

It's a version of one of the laminate ideas I have posted on SDreams'
page... Todd, what's the URL for that? Is it still up? The SFR shirt logo
is a slightly edited update of the "molecule" one. The main difference is
the lack of a slimy looking background and the lettering: the letters are
sort of "disintegrated." It looks pretty cool (IMHO). So, if my page is
still acting loopy but you're interested in checking out the design, check
with Todd's page. Maybe he'll post the URL or something.

stupid local network.

It's acting up and we keep having to reset the friggin' printer. And I keep
having to do the same boring repetitive task over and over because
printmonitor's being a bitch.

there it goes again.

and my webpage isn't working because of the dinks at OCF who are screwing
the whole server up, so people can't preview the design for the SFR shirt,
and they won't know what an ugly, big-necked undersized shirt they're
getting (oops! =).

And my eyes are glazing over because I've been staring a computer screen
for most of my waking hours the past half-week.

not a good day.

can't wait 'til FnF.

will definitely be in a better mood by then...

Tim,

Wow!  It sounds like the BBQ & Beats II went OFF!  I really wish I 
could have been there; I had a good time at the meeting at Tony's 
house, just think of the fun that I would have had at the actual 
BBQ! (I just returned from a family reunion in Nebraska.)  

I did notice the thread about money and donations.  Boy, do I have a 
timely story to share with you!  My family reunion takes place every 
other year, and requires an expense to put on the "shindig" for about 
170 people.  Passing the hat was "uncomfortable" and never netted more 
than about $300.00. Because there are not many people who can afford to 
help with cash donations, the costs are always absorbed by the few 
people that plan/pay for the reuion. 
 
NOT ANYMORE!  This year we had an auction.  It was made up of donated 
crafts and food.  We brought in over $1900.00!  I couldn't believe it.  
Upon first glance, the offerings on the auction table looked pretty 
simple, nothing looked like it would sell for very much.

I bought a pie for $16.00, after beating one of my cousins in a bidding 
war.  Upon unwrapping it, I discovered that it was a "cow pie." I had a 
great time, and an aunt slipped me a real pie that was the best I've 
ever eaten.   

An auction is great in many ways:
-Providing auction goods is a way for people to contribute without 
involving money or time.

-An auction is fun to watch.

-People bidding on items know that the money is going for a good cause.

-Good deals can be found at auctions, (someone bought a hand-made afghan 
for less than $100.00 at my reunion.)

Ravers are an interesting bunch, imagine what kind of things we could 
donate for an auction.

Sincerely,
Diana Greer

Good day, 

It was a pleasure to here you spin at the BBQ.  I was in the process of cooking for a 
good part your set, so it was hard for me to judge the total experience. But, I can say
that I liked what I heard...cool records.  Thanks for hangin' with us and our newbie.
He really had a good time and will be back in the future. In fact, he wanted to go to 
F&F, but I wasn't able to get him a ticket.  Guess he'll have to make the Harmony 
finale instead.

Good day,

I think this post has something to do with the use of sfraves and other mailing lists for
the sole purpose of advertising their wares.  If I recall correctly, a previous post by DJ
Hardware, was an advertisement for about a half dozen or more cds put together by 
him.  My response was to delve into my own little archive to retrieve the post that is
sent to all new sfrave subscribers by the server and echo the part back pertaining to
using this base only to advertise a product etc.  I have no problem with an occasional 
plug for one's self, but this looked like junk mail to me.  I get enough of it here at the
house, that I am less tolerant of it here on the net.  If anyone really cares to see the 
origional post, I might be able to dig it up for you to peruse.

Take care,
                     Jason

Hey yeah! I do remember that flyer, and I *think* it's still around
somewhere...  I really liked the tissue paper-type inserts and the
photography was great.  I think maybe a departure from the usual CPU-graphix
type fare we're all used to seeing is refreshing. (not to dis grafix heads

Does anyone have any extra Area 51 flyers lying around? First, second or
third... doesn't matter.  I would LOVE a copy of Carlos' U.F.O tape from the
1st Area 51.  My copy was stolen.. I'll pay up to $20.

Thanks,

Hello =)

Obviously everyone's free to do wahtever they want ultimately, but I would
like ot point out that selling an FnF ticket for any more than you paid for
it, ie $5 would really go against the spirit of what we're trying to do in
the first place. Better to give it away and make a $5 donation to
hyppereal, IMO.

just my $.02.

take it easy

Not to disagree at all with what Ethan said about marking up FnF tix, but...

I think it is kind of humorous/cool/wickedly delightful that there is a
BLACK MARKET in Friends n Family tickets.  If you got your own underground
market going, you know you're doing something right.  Pehaps there will
soon be an options market in FnF tix.  "I'll pay $25 for an option to
purchase a block of ten FnF August 1998 tickets."  They could trade on the
Pacific Stock Exchange!

O.K. I am evidently going a bit mental.  Partly due to the fact that I will
be missing this FnF due to out of town committments.

Waiting for the next one already.  (I know I'm not the only one)

          Yeah... $25!  If you want that VIBE you gotta pay the
          piper.  You think VIBE is free...?  Next thing you know
          you'll start ranting about Love, or taking care of people...

          Jokes aside, if this thing is half as together as the events
          that lead me there (knock knock knock), I will probably die
          a happy freak walking back in a post-loving-event bliss
          cloud as I get punked broadside by one of those crappy SF
          drivers who's driving around town downloading smutty gif's
          to his Ricochet equipped notebook.  Weeehaaaa.

          Meanwhile, I brought my roommates to a weekly (weakly?) here
          in San Jose on Sunday night (stop laughing until I'm
          finished!), and it was really scary.  Just when you think
          they might get hung up over the music or the openness or
          something like that, you realize they're scammers and are
          talking to ravrrrrchicks from the get go.  Either way,
          fortunately their advances were rejected, and they decided
          that it did in fact suck (it's amazing how much the scene
          CAN protect itself from the forces of selfishness
          unbridled).  I think if someone can maintain at a weekly,
          and be cool with the music and the scene and not use it as
          an opportunity to use their crotch as a docking station,
          maybe then you should take them to a rave.  It's a bummer
          really.  Now I have to start looking for a new drummer (I've
          heard this guy -Roland- is pretty popular around these
          circles) because I was just kinda disgusted by the whole
          commodity aspect of the thing (the worst 'evil cult' vibe of
          all) that I had brought myself.

          So I tried explaining on the way home... I go to raves to go
          to raves.  When I'm there, I don't want to be doing anything
          else.  I'm full of emotion, be it tension, or awe, or love,
          or willingness to try new things, or just talking to new
          people.

          His reaction:  Whatever...

          Whatever is right.

I would say you got hooked. I notice no one at the tables  at the time and
mixed in a record and started to get a few more out to play. I stepped away
for a sec and you went right to the tables again. I was Damn!  Should have
stayed at the tables, I was wanting to spin.

Your hooked dude...and remember "It's a small world after all".....I song

Have fun though, it's an expensive hobby. I'm glad I don't play out yet, I
haven't bought a record in a long time. But, YES thanks to some stocks I'll
be selling shortly, I can get rid of my Technics SL22BD and get some 1200's
next month.  Good luck find the 1200's

Well first it looks like me email seems to be working  for the moment. I
didn't get a return post of my message saying thanks, so here it goes and
sorry if you got this twice..


All I can say is Damn! I had a great time. I want to thank every single
person that help with the BBQ and to all the people that came, thanks you.
If it wasn't for all your support and positive energy, I don't think it
would have been as good as it was. All the DJ's I thought did a great job.
Thanks for spinning such wonderful sets. Thanks to Ethan for the sound, I'm
glad you made it out. Thanks to the New Moon Crew for the alter at the
water, it looked awesome. Big thanks to the FnF crew for having tickets
there. They went fast.

It's people like all of you that make me feel happy to be alive. THANKS!

Also, while I'll was face first on the ground toward the end of the BBQ, I
heard a "Click" of a camera.
YES I did hear that, but didn't have the energy to look up and see who took
that picture. I WANT IT., or at least a copy.

Black market markups are lame, but to be expected for any
high-demand/low-supply situation. However, it seems that allowing people to
buy large blocks of tickets  CREATED that "black market" in the first
place... as much as I hate fascist BASS/Ticketmaster, there's a reason that
they have a per-person ticket limit for some of the higher-profile events.

It sure seems like there are LOTS of people who want tickets (myself
included). Understandably not everyone can get in because of space limits,
but there are lots of people who wanted to go, but couldn't make the BBQ.
Perhaps if tickets hadn't been sold in giant blocks, there would still be
tickets for a few of us?

Just my .02

Unfortunately you're a little mistaken here. In general *no one that was
not a member of the FnF production team"* was sold 'large' blocks of
tickets. At teh bbq one or two peopel bought 8 - 10 only after convincing
me, by naimg the people, that they were doing it for people that couldn't
be there. Most of the tickets taht were availabel for public consumption
went in groups of 2 - 4.

Of the ~45 people in our group each was allowed 10 - 15 to get to their
friends and associates, however,once again, many of these 45 people took
only 3 - 5. I see nothing wrong with the people that break their butts to
make these parties happen being able to invite 10 -15 friends of theirs,
especially given the massive overlap bewteen those friends and this list
for instance.

However, more to the point, here is the situation: We made a decsion a
*long* time ago to limit the size of our parties. We did this to a)
preserve an intimate experience, and b) try and insure a safe, manageable,
and fun party --  in that order. Since then, the amount of people that want
to attend FnFs has far outstripped the number any of us comfortable
hosting. This, by definition, means that people that want to go, won't be
able to.

Trying to be as fair as we can is important to us, and I feel very strongly
that we always make a *real* effort in this regard. How many other
'promoters' do you know that offer mail order? We can't help it if people
assume a, b, or c, wait till the last minute, and miss out.

If you review the post in which I said they would be available at the bbq I
think you'll notice that I also suggested that they would probably be gone
by monday, which they were.

sigh.

take it easy

As it should be, then. Thanks for clearing up my misconceptions - it seemed
that (from the posts on sfr, anyway) that there were many people who bought
LOTS of tickets. If this wasn't the case, then forgive my ignorance...

I agree that those who put on the party should be allowed to invite as many
as they want. I also think it's great that you keep the parties small. It's
too bad that it leaves so many out in the cold, but I guess there's nothing
that can be done about that...

(have parties more often? :)   )

(from Nancy)

The last couple of FnF's (way WAY back in our foggy collective memory) 
almost happened without me, but miraculously a gleaming, shiny ticket 
materialized for me the night of. :)  This time around I raced to the BBQ 
way too early to make sure I got my ticket. 

Yes, it sucks for those who didn't get a ticket on Saturday.  But first 
off I'd like to say that all the people I know who bought 5+ (myself 
included) were buying for a bunch of friends.  I don't think anyone snapped them up to scalp (and anyone profiting off of this goes against 
the spirit that makes FnF so special!).  

However, this DOES mean that probably Saturday night some tickets will 
become available. :) (You can try wandering around in cyperspace calling 
out, "I need a miracle!") I would like to ask of the list that if anyone 
has extra tickets, before giving them to some random acquaintance we should make them available on the list.

But what bothers me is my feeling that the FnF feeding frenzy obscures a 
fundamental ravetruth.  I have learned through "partying" that WE create the vibe, that each of us is 
responsible for our own happiness through the love and positivity that we 
center on and share with others.  This fixation on FnF suggests to me the 
belief that such experience is only possible at certain parties, i.e. the 
vibe stems from a party and not from one's own inner state.  Raving has 
been a very spiritual journey for me in the sense that I have come to see 
my power in the creation of my reality.  FnF is not the power, it lies 
within each of us.  

If FnF is so special because everyone comes there with open heart and 
mind, the people involved do it from love, and people's excitement and 
anticipation animate the whole atmosphere around the party, I 
think we are fully capable of creating MANY FnFs.  It sucks to think that we are dependent on an FnF 
happening in order to have that experience (and the last one was HALLOWEEN, 
everyone!).

There are other groups that are coming from much the same wavelength.  
Gateway is throwing Chrysalis the very next weekend after FnF.  Harmony is 
coming up.  But still, FnF is composed of a volunteer vibe army.  To have 
an even more vibrant underground just takes people who are willing to 
take more responsibility in creating it.  (I don't mean that facetiously 
- what I mean is that when we recognize that we really are the creators, 
we take more and more conscious action toward the creation of what we want).


Here lies the division between takers and givers.  Now as this applies to 
the underground I have been very ambivalent, because I am torn between 
loving to run all around a party slurping it all up, and realizing that 
maintaining that experience requires HELPING at some point.  There are 
too many people who love to slurp it all up for one FnF to accomodate.  
Instead of anger over the ticket roulette (which is bound to unfairly 
exclude many), I would love to see our community rededicate itself to the 
CREATION of a bigger, stronger underground. 

Just something for us all to think about as this weekend's Friends and 
Family fades into memory...

Love, Nancy

Clarification
(from Nancy)

I didn't mean to imply in my post that MANY people got lots of tickets for 
"bunches" of friends (though reading it over, that's what it sounds 
like!).  I actually just know one other who got 5+ like me, and in both 
our cases it was for people who wanted to go but couldn't get to the BBQ.  

I HAD assumed that a lot of people did the same (though I also assumed it 
was for people who couldn't go to the BBQ, probably almost all 
SFRavers).  Ethan's post helped clear that up for me.

Thanks for all the responses I've been getting on this. I feel my 'angst'
was misinterpreted. Being bummed doesn't mean being angry. As far as my
comment about being in the family, I admit it sounded a bit solomn. All I
meant was that basically the tickets all sold out in one place in a matter
of hours. It was pretty centralized. Sorry if I offended anyone, it was a
post written out of anticipation of attendence crossed with the sudden
realization that I might not go. But not angst:)

Right on! The Moontribe Collective in SoCal has run into similar problems
of becoming trendy, and being overrun by people congratulating themselves
on having found the coolest party around. This has forced them to go *deep*
underground, and, as an unexpected bonus, has forced the SoCal Raves
contingent to go out and start their own parties.

You're absolutely right, the spirit is within us. We are responsible for
influencing the vibe around us, whether it's at some 6-figure megarave or
on a secluded patch of sand somewhere with 5 other people.

Peace,

People on this list really need to LIGHTEN UP!
So what if someone dosen't like what you have to say?
Is it all really so important that people have to leave the list?
Is it really ruining your day if someone you probably have never met posts
something you don't like?

Stop making such a big deal about nothing!

Plus, remember for future reference that Ethan offers to sell his tickets 
via snail mail if you cannot make the event the tickets are being sold.  
He has said that each time there have been very few who have taken him up 
on this opportunity.  Perhaps from now on, more will take advantage of 
this.

No. MORE people should throw more parties!!!!

 If you can't go to a scene, make your own. That is how raving got 
started and what all great thinkers (IMHO)tell others; think and do for 
yourselves.

I would like to share some personal experience here and hilight what may 
be a potential problem for the scene in general and for FnF in 
particular. I used to participate in the somewhat underground scene of 
the deadheads from about 1978 to 1992 or so. During that time the scene 
went from a fairly intimate feel to a way too popular, overblown feel. 
One aspect that drew a lot of unwanted attention from the police and 
public were hordes of deadheads trying to bum/buy/trade tickets at the 
shows. This became a serious problem (IMHO) and really hardened me to the 
show as, clutching my ticket, I would procede through (sometimes) 
hundreds of desprate, sad, pathetic yet occasionally radiant people. I 
really was trying to be happy going into the show but all those people so 
desprately trying to get in saddened me. Hopefully FnF is ready for 
something like this. Perhaps a map point where tickets are checked will 
alleviate some of these potential difficulties.



> I would love to see our community rededicate itself to the 
> CREATION of a bigger, stronger underground. 

I would like to see more people involved in throwing parties. I think 
therin  lies the true growth and survival of our scene. The Dead had 
problems as they were pretty much (after a certain point) the only ones 
who did what they did.

Hi all!
 
 An update to the posts below; still need a ride. The very latest I can 
arrive in SF for this event is 6 pm (thursday). That means leaving Santa 
Cruz at about 4pm. That means arriving in Santa Cruz at about 2 pm to load up 
equipment and supplies. Driver needs to commit to driving me back (leave 
SF at about 8 am, friday). Again, gas and admission will be paid for and 
special surprise perks are in store for the person who can help.

 Thanks for reading this!!!!!


Beats to all ya's


Ran

Which is really too bad.  This is the real reason I don't generally
go to classical music concerts.  To REALLY listen to music my

Perhaps HE couldn't.  I can't really listen and sit still.  I've done it both
ways, a lot, and there is no comparison.

By not allowing people to dance at classical concerts and discouraging
it at jazz concerts, they are choking the life out of them.   A dancing
audience just adds so much power to any kind of music.

The techno people will have gotten together with the jazz people and the
African drummers and  people will have become accustomed to dancing to
stuff that's 140 bpm and 11 or more  beats to the measure and you never
know where it's headed next.  :^)  :^)  :^)

Television has centralized the control of information in a very small, very
conservative group of corporate executives.  You could fit all of them in
one room.  They have used this control to sell people an entire lifestyle,
all the acoutrements that go with it, and the beliefs that go with it.  Every
Presidential election year the number of television stations that could be
owned by a single entity was raised, which made the TV networks very
very happy (I don't think there is any limit anymore).

Cable TV was supposed to offer more diversity, but it has done nothing
of the kind.  Cable companies have been getting bought up right and left
until cable is just as centralized as over-the-air TV, and largely by the same
people.

>replaced reading the paper as a major source of information. Newspaper
>subscriptions are dropping, book sales are likewise falling.

But the newspapers have been their own second-worst enemy.  Most papers
are part of nationwide newspaper chains now, with some of the same effects
that the networks have on TV.  And a lot of papers just are not very good
(including all of the ones in the Bay Area that I've tried).

>the computer and the net threaten to replace the printed word and the
television
>altogether. What are the possible consequences of that?

This is a GOOD thing.   You seek out information on the net, and choose what
you want to explore further.   You READ it, like a newspaper.  You are not
spoon-fed it by the anchorman, like on TV.  You can get your news from
anywhere in the world, from anyone with network access.   You can POST.

If you only count reading books and newspapers.  Why does reading a computer
screen not count as reading?

> and know less as a general populace.(The paradox principle)

Know less about what?  Your results will vary a lot depending on what you
test for.
(this usually resolves to "know less about what I had to learn when I was a
kid").

This is rapidly becoming true for computer literacy as well.
In any case, computers can be a powerful tool for learning to read.

There is little reason for this anymore.  Old computers are extremely cheap
now, and even they can provide access to the network.

>So, is the computer of the 90's really the television of the 50's???  Just
>another diabolical gadget?

Not at all.  All one can do with television is passively watch it, unless one
has access to a studio and a TV station -- something that very few people
have.   The network can be a channel for anyone to present the fruits
of his|her creativity.   Nothing quite like it has ever existed before.

Now that's waht I call a party.  The other day some one was on this list 
talking about politics in raving; but it was about people only and not 
issues that effect them (e.g. having your village ripped up for a new 
freeway). For me, this is why I got into raves in te first place: not to 
simply go out and have a good time (although obviously this is a very 
important factor) but, in the tradition of punk rock, to do my two cense 
in trying to smAsh the system.  And that's what needs to happen here: 
raves need to become more politicised.  Don't forget: every time you are 
at a rave and are tripping you are risking going to jail for ten years 
with no remission or porole; yet this is never talked about on this 
list.  And as for how we rape our natural evironment!  We need to have 
people at raves giving out info on drugs etc as well 
as free condoms to name but a few.  We need more people at raves doing 
healing and body work. In short, we are in danger of becoming victims of 
our own superficiality and we need to stop this from happening.  Because, 
otherwise, when we are older and we are hanging-out in the sterilization 
chamber with your kids and they ask us what we did to try and stop this 
from happening are you going to be able to live with yourself and look 
them in the face and say, " I dunno, I was to busy working and and having 
a good time to bother about it!"  That's not good enough and we all know 
it.
So what can we, as an American movement, do about this?  This is a 
difficult question as politics is much more elitist in it's nature then 
in England (where everyone has already be politicised from an early age) 
and there is a danger we might alienate the very people we need to 
educate.  BUt it is definatly some thing we need to think about.  Any 
suggestions?

Well, the one thing that we can't/won't bend on is the right space.  The
main reason we don't have more parties is not due to lack of participation
or enthusiasm, but directly related to finding the right space(s), and not
compromising on that.

In order for our parties to have the unique characteristics that they have,
and that people seem to enjoy, we need to feel a little special something
about the space, a certain jene sais quoi if you will.

One problem with the map point idea is the someone is stuck standing there
in the freezing cold all night while everybody else has fun. Unlike the
parking people or the trash people, who are close enough to the event to
just hop over every once in a while, the map point people are, by
definition, far from the action.

I don't know. I guess I've always considered the map point the suckiest job
in the DIY rave business.

Also several map points have been robbed at gun point. Not a pleasant 
thought....

Je sais quoi, all right ;)  The spaces that appeal to me the most are
interesting in structure, have places you can go to cool off, and are
located in areas where vandalism/car theft isn't common.  The space has to
have something of a vibe of it's own, as if you can feel that it WANTS us
to gather and enjoy there.

Roots is wednesday, but Natural sounds pretty cool if you're looking for
something to do tonight:

   _Natural_ - house, techno w/DJs Mark Farina, Mattski, Spun, Galen,
   Solar, John Howard. Mission Rock Resort, 817 China Basin, SF.

According to the voicemail, the lineup tonight is Buck, J-Jay, and
Solar...

Ok, everyone, Michal asked that I put the logo he's using on my SFR art 
page, so here's the URL, check it out:

        www.tgrigsby.com/sfraves/index.html

There's a link on there to send him e-mail, let him know what you think.  
And if you get a wild hair and want to see your funkiest artwork, good, bad, 
or really stinky, put up for the whole world to see, attach it to an email 
and send it to me.

Y'know, guys, I really feel for those that didn't get tix, but Ethan 
explained the break down to me when I bought mine and it made perfect sense. 
 FnF is being quite fair with the distribution of tix, IMHO, and very smart 
about limiting the number of tix sold.  There're a LOT of people on this 
list, and a LOT of people in the extended rave family.  Something like 900 
people on this list (?) and only a fraction of the rave community is online. 
 It's not surprising not everyone will be able to get in the door.

If I had any advice for Ethan, it would be to only take half with you to 
sell personally and, yeah, go ahead and put the rest at Ameba or something.  
Not everyone could get to the BBQ, and I think that's where part of the 
frustration is coming from.  Then when you sell out, just say, "Oops, only 
brought so many, they're gone, check with [whoever]..."  I know, it seemed 
like a lame excuse at the time, but in hindsight...

Ethan, don't sweat the controversy.  It's kind of a compliment, this 
scrambling for tix.

And lets not forget the last minute addition of Dionysus Dreams who will 
also be performing with Stephen Kent and others as well as solo. Be sure to 
check the voice mail as a few things have shifted. The info fair for the 
Mayan calendar/DreamSpell readings has apparently been cancelled. That 
was the noon to 8pm thang. All Dj's are a go!!

 Will be most delightful!!  =)

Nancy,

        Excellent points and reminders for us all.  It's sometimes easier
for people to think "This will be a wonderful experience" rather than
"Let's MAKE this a wonderful experience."  Nevertheless, there are some
parties that are thought of as most likely to have what some of us seek the
most.  For me, Harmony events always come to mind first, then Gateway
(specifically, Chrysalis).
        I recall a FnF I attended quite a while ago, my first FnF, which
also had "it," and it was probably because of the combination of elements
present, not just who the promoters were, that created "it" at that
particular party.  That was the party where Baktash (sp?) stood up in the
chill area toward the end of the night and exclaimed something to the
effect of "Beautiful people!  Beautiful people!  The party's not over!
Carlos is spinning!  Get up!  Give each other a hug, and go dance!!!"  That
was the inspiration for Harmony's Beautiful People parties.  That was also
where and when I got my first tast of "vibe," though I wasn't superficially
aware of it.
        I recall reading reviews of parties that described the writers'
efforts to create a positive situation out of a less-than-positive party
environment.  This supports your comments that we create the vibe.  I
receive you loud and clear, and I agree with your point of view.  Let's do
what we can to make every party a wonderful, magical, and fulfilling
experience!

Love to all,

Eric

does it matter?

I think that just the fact that everyone's going to FnF with high hopes is
going to make it a good party. If everyone walks in thinking "This party's
going to KICK ASS (it will!)" then it will just because everyone thinks
so... The promoter has very little effect on the vibe. It's mainly a
people-created thing, though not necessarily consciously created.

IMHO.

Dontchu miss dis one sucka!  :-)  Meat Beat!  Yes!  I assume that some
of the music played during this broadcast will be c/o his magnificence
(and not just from his record collection ;-)  Yeah, and while youre
at it, check his box and see if there is any 'My Life With The Thrill

Ah, right around the corner of where I live.
Unfortunately I hate seafood :-(
Are you folks likely to have a beer afterwards somewhere?

i'm printing up transfers to put peoples names on the sfraves tshirts, but
if anyone would like a transfer to put on a tshirt of their own, just let me
know. they'll have a little mike migurski sfraves logo next to your name, or
just a small logo if you like that better. i don't need any money, but if
you must, you could give me a quarter. i think that will be about cost. =)
ahh.. the joys of modern technology.

brendan

i'll probably print up a whole page of just sfraves logos and bring them to
FnF for people. any special orders should get to me by friday night at the
latest.

Yes and no. There are a lot of steps that promoters can take to help make a 
party. Things like free water, adequate bathroom facilities, well 
equalized and amplified sound, good lighting, adequate ventilation, decent 
chill spaces, competent DJ's, and the little intangibles. I can't count 
the number of times lack of one or more of the things mentioned above 
have been listed in peoples reviews as detracting from their overall 
experience. These are the things that the groups like Harmony, Cloud 
Factory, Gateway Systems, F&F, and all the other groups that get good 
reviews usually do. There is a real synergy between party-thrower and 
party-goer. Show people you care about them, their safety, and their 
well-being, and they will notice.

hello people who read this post-

if you don't know html well, don't waste your time.  if you do, read on-

i know the <hr> tag, which displays a horizontal line.  is there an
analogous attribute that displays a vertical line (i've tried <vr> and it
doesn't work).  i'd put in a graphic to do it, but it screws up when people
resize the window.

any suggestions, help?

love-

Well, in light of the situation of FnF and no doubt Harmony, chrystialsys
(sp?)  that will be coming soon, I many are begining to realize what thier
concepts of ravers are...

I would of loved to fo to FnF, however a current obligation had kept me from
the BBQ, and thus not acquiring a ticket.  So instead, I contacted others and
alinged other venues to go to.  Some of us rave for the association of the
family we create.  I've seen SFRaves, on many ocasions, be referenced as a
"tribe" more than once, and within that collective are seperate more intamite
circles.  Other SFRavers (such as myself) try to create the Vibe where we go
and travel through more personal paths.  Ultimatley we grow, we care, to
whatever path you choose.

To the list, I know many...  Face to face I know few...

It's about choice...

If you feel that you need the SFR family @ events then, yes, FnF will be the
bomb...
If you dance like a mad man for 5hours straight, turn and see a crowd of
happy  dancing ravers, none of which you know but, on that higher level,
share the intimacy of the vibe, weither it be @ FnF, _LUST_, CCC, Resistance,
Fast step Productions...  That's the bomb too...

I've learned soo much from all of you, one's that I've talked to, yet never
seen... The very few to whom I talked to (Vince, Wayne, Brian, Rikki, Purple
T) I consider honored.   And the ones to whom I've yet to converse with, I
look foward to our meeting...  And there are the slecet few to which I just
have to see, and communicate at a level where words are meaningless (YOU have
seen me to and know who you are...).

So Have fun.  Live, learn, cry, smile...  Be with thoese you love or be with
none and love everyone.

"dance with me..."

-Adam

AAAUUGH!!!!!   I hav'n't even finnished reading your post, but I HAD to give
affirmations and agreement!!!!  I have been printing info from the Hyperreal
web site on drugs and passing it out to people at raves for like the last two
weeks!!!   It gets a little expensive, but I am now printing both sides, an
*vioala!*, my over head was reduced by 1/2!   And let's hear it for PUNX NOT
DEAD!!! it lives on in people like you and I, who have heard the messages and
 in folx who arrived at that point w/o ever even hearing the music!
 Political awareness is so important!!! Unfortunately, it seems like more
people are just too caught up in the whole "buy 'till you die" American
Disneyland FREAKSHOW that the media (a corporation and NOT an objective
reporting agency, like most believe) along with the oil/auto industries,
banks(EVIL)  and giants like Beatrice force on you every day!  Kill your
television!  Thank "Bob" the net exists, and will take over television(I
hope) because it allows people to put their ideas in a place anyone can get
to it.  But I fear censorship by electronic means.  That makes it too easy to
controll.  A filter to remove info with any inflamatory info.  Is that a
possible reality?  I don't know programming enough to know...Perhapse I
should be a programmer, learn it all, make it fall...
Our government has been doing all kinds of fucked up things in the last 10
years that seem so blatant to me, I just can't believe people are not
outraged and storming the streets to correct it.  These are things like stuff
in your highschool history text that were marked as great achievements of the
US people, like bank regulations (they are now DE-regulated and can do
whatever the fuck they want) and anti-monopoly laws   (they still have the
laws, but the corps are now able wheel and deal with the govnmnt to make
their corp's bigger using loop holes and "government assistance", where the
corp agrees to pay the gov money to be able to be above the law...Sound like
a bribe to you?).  Plus, all kinds of unconstitutional search and siesure
laws that no one hears about cuz the media suppresses it.  I think the gov is
the corps.  No, I know that.  Tell everyone.  Let them see the truth.  They
have it so well planned though, that it is now viewed by most as "Unamerican"
to question the government.  That was how we got out from under Brittish rule
250 years ago!!  That is the most american thing anyone could ever do!!...OK
enough words, how bout some action?  Any ideas? REVOLUTION anyone?  I feel so
helpless with all the TV zombies so tuned out!!  How can you teach someone
who doesn't want to learn?  And the truth is that I don't have any solution.
 PLEASE HELP!

There is no <vr> tag, but you might try javascript.  It's much
more dynamic about the context in which it's running than, say, 
java applets.

  Other than javascript (already suggested) the only thing you might do
would be to create a wide, skinny background graphic with your line in it.
No control over the height of the line that way, and you have to be
careful to keep your text off it.  But it won't be affected by a window
resize, and it will be vertical.  On the other hand, if you already have a
bg graphic, this is a lot of work, unless your bg graphic is already
horizontally oriented.
  All I can think of.  Good luck.

Not that I'm aware of, but you can use a table to format the page and keep a 
graphic of a vertical line in place.  I forget the actual syntax, but 
there's an attribute you can use to make the table itself invisible so it 
only controls where text and images appear.

Not much help, but a clue nonetheless...

OK, all, thanks for your responses!  Feel free to e-mail me your birthdays
as well (I'll want them anyway, so I can remember y'all on your special
days!).  I want to set a deadline of 1:00pm on Friday (tomorrow) for anyone
who wants to send me their zodiac sign and hasn't yet.  As soon as I can,
probably sometime next week, I'll make a list, in order from greatest
number to fewest number per sign, and post it to the mailing list, so we
have something of a picture of how many people are of this or that sign.
Based on the responses, it still looks like we've got more Aquarians than
anything else.  If the traits associated with the various signs apply,
we'll also have something of an idea of what kinds of people are attracted
to this scene of ours.
For the statistically anal out there, I realize that this isn't
scientifically accurate, but hey, neither is astrology (MHO, no flames,
please).  I'm just doing this as a curiosity, and to take my mind off other
things (like work ;)).
Thanks again to all participants in this project :)

PLUR,

So for all of you who can't or aren't going to Friends and Family, 
remember there is another awsome rave going on this saturday night, 
yes, its the "Lust for Life" Burning Man Benfit Rave. 

There is a great line up, everyone is giving their time and effort for free
and all the profit goes to the Burning Man Organisation, which will help us 
all have even more fun in the desert too.

Dress up and expect a night of great fun. My brother Mat and friends 
Mark, Gary and Dave have put alot of effort into this, not to mention 
all the work that young Irish Thomas Trouble has put in. And seeing 
as how these guys are probably your favourite's how could you not 
support them.

We are all really looking forward to seeing you, for further details 
including info on the virtual reality room call 437-5797.

Love Dave

     Hey.  This is a test-tell you I'm a Gemini-let you know my first rave, 
     Eon, was real good-I'll see everyone at FnF-message.
     
     Last Saturday's picnic was cool and much props to those who influenced 
     me into going to Eon and the overall rave scene.  A former Bostonian 
     is now headed in the right direction -> SF Raves.  :)

Ok, ok.  I haven't seen anyone throw this sign out, so I guess I might as well 
contribute on this beautiful day. 

I'm a Virgo.

I don't really know much about signs, etc.  So if it's bad to be one of these, 
don't let me know because I'm having a great day so far :)

There are several of us on the list!  At least five that I know of anyway, and 
I'm sure there are more.

Great post Eric, however (not that it means much) the party that you 
described was at Richmond Civic Center. I don't believe FnF has done a 
RCC party. But, it does not matter, the story is just the same. Both 
parties were beautilful!!

 FnF in Richmond Civic Center???. although for a brief moment grandeur
such as that was considered - it was very quickly dropped....
Anyone who talks with Ethan understands quickly that FnF is about
small is beautiful (including cost) values... not about how big we
can get... although there are a few of us who wonder just how many
tickets could we sell if we really tried ... hummmm..

But really, bottom line this is a party for family put on by the rave
families... which is one reason no one profits from it... except by
the joy we get in sharing the experience.....

Greetings to all ye sfravers!

I'm just writing a quick note to everyone to say I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY this Saturday.  I'm curious to know what some of you will 
be wearing?  Look for me in my silver pantsuit!!  I've got quite a weekend 
lined up for myself and my honey.  I'm in my cousin's wedding (I'm a 
bridesmade) on Sat. in Colfax (leaving tomorrow after work) and we're driving 
back that same night to be at the party!  Chris is sewing my dress, what a 
guy huh?  

Seriously, this F&F is very important to me!  It's where I got together with 
Chris (at a F&F last Haloween).  He left a very significant impression on me 
and I followed up with a phone call to him (thank you Amy S. for his #) the 
next week inviting myself over for a visit.  We spent the day together and 
ended up going out to Stinson Bch. where during sunset we kissed each other 
and fell in love:) Since then I've left Sacramento to move in with him and 
we're now engaged, thanks to F&F I've met my spiritual partner for life! It's 
been hard at times moving and getting reacclamated over here but I'm 
extremely happy and I've managed to get what is looking like a permanent gig 
as a computer graphic artist at Broderbund where I live in Novato.  Looking 
forward to seeing all my friends (I love you guys) and meet more of the 
sfravers on this list!!  Take care everyone and enjoy yourselves:)

Subject: Malachy's healing fund
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

It is stated that proceeds will go toward Malachy's healing fund for the FnF
gig.  I remember something about Malacy's healing fund a few years back and
have noted that several gigs talk about this.  But, rack my brain as I can,
I can't remember exactly what this is.  I can only recall bits and pieces.
Could someone send me some more info on this?  Thanks!!

The proceeds of F&F are primarily to benefit Hyperreal. Unity is supposed 
to benefit Malachy.

Hey Kidds--

LA Dave here.  

Hey I just picked up the July/August issue of "Psychology Today" and
they had a great article on the Second Coming of Psychadelics.

I don't have it with me--but here's some interesting tidbits--

**1987--39% of college student had tried MDMA at least once
**1993--3 billion doses of MDMA are being manufactured in homemade labs
**"the most shining example of this are parties called 'raves'"
   In SF, on almost any given weekend, you can find 10-20,000 teenagers
at these all night parties--80% of which are on drugs.

It's actually a very balanced and good article!!

I'm glad my favortie mag has caught up with me!! :)

See ya kidds--

Hope you're all doing well!!

Hey Dave!

Why does Burning Man need to have a benefit if the tickets are $25 a 
pop, and there is a projected attendance of 8000-10,000 people?

Is wood really that expensive?  

Sincerely,
Diana

             Hello all,

             This weekend sees THETA's first party, Lust for Life
             a benefit for the Burning Man foundation. All profit
             from the event will be donated to the foundation. In
             particular, most of the money will be going to help
             with the cost for facilities at the Techno Ghetto - this
             years incarnation of the Rave Camp.

             We'd like to give back to the Burning Man for the time
             we spent on the playa. Also, there's been some animosity
             in the past between the Main & Rave camps, by working
             together we improve the relationship.

             We're really looking forward to the night. Putting the
             event together has been very rewarding, especially due
             to the many people donating time, equipment and services.

             All we need now is a cast of participants for the nights
             celebration - hopefully we'll see some of you there.


             The DJ line up for the night is...

             In the main room:

             Jeremy (Portland), Alex, BioJeff, Thomas Trouble, Mars,
             Myster-E

             And in the other:

             Mosha, Mike, Shaggy

             Call 415.437.5797 on the night for final information, we'll
             be kicking things off at 10:00.

             THETA

BBQin all day. I know someone took it, I heard a "Click". Just didn't have

Isn't it funny how the media thinks raves are all teenagers, young and 
impressionable.  Seems like the majority of ravers I meet are in their 
20s and 30s.

Porta-potties, trash cleanup crews, permits, medical facilities, security,
paying for the BLM presence, paying off... er, supporting the local
population, insurance, ect.

Doing this large of an event 100% by the books and 100% legally requires
more expenses than you can imagine.

How to spot me (for those who don't know): SHROOMARAMA t-shirt (again!),
next-gen sfraves laminate, FnF laminate, long ponytail with those colorful
hairbands (what a hippie).  I'll have candy, hugz, & smiles to share, and
I'll be taking lots of pictures (I promise not to capture anyone in a

If there's anyone in Santa Cruz who wasn't able to get a ticket to Friends

figured I'd post to the list in case there are any Santa Cruz people
out there (or people who can make it to Santa Cruz tonight) who still
need one.  I can't really  deliver it anywhere, but I'll be home in Santa 
Cruz for a while tonight, so if you can come get it it's yours...

Send me email privately if you want it!

To all,

Gary wrote us about Theta's Lust for Life party....

For those of you who aren't able to make it to FnF, and in case you don't
know the crew that's put this party together, they are totally great people
who have worked hard to put their first event together so everyone can have
a great time

So this is a great alternative for you for a smaller kind of party, and
with a great vibe ... and all for a good cause!

Allow me to preface this with the request that I no longer be referred to
as RaveMom by anyone over the age of 18, ok?  I'm not that old for
Chrissakes!  And unless you were born of my loins, I'm not your mom
(besides my daughter would be really jealous).  Nevertheless, I have some
thoughts from the perspective of age that I'd like to share.

I'm noticing over the last days (as often happens) the tendency we all have
to take our hopes and anticipation, and put them into some upcoming event
that we're really looking foward to.  I do it too, but I had a realization
about it a few months ago that I wanted to share.

OK, it's Tuesday, we're really excited about something that's going to
happen Saturday, and we say to ourselves .... "I can't wait.... I wish
Saturday would get here soon!"   Stop!  What are you doing?  YOU ARE
WISHING YOUR LIFE AWAY!!!  You are wishing that PRECIOUS DAYS of your life
would speed by, so that you can get to an experience that you HOPE will
make you happy!

This is so seductive, and it's SOOOO DANGEROUS!  Because, you have to face
it, Saturday (or next month, or Christmas, or your vacation) MAY NEVER
COME!  Really, something could happen that keeps you from being in that
much-anticipated place (an accident, family emergency, whatever) and you
now have lost those days with no way to get them back.  Or, as often
happens, the upcoming event doesn't live up to your expecations at all.

So, not to sound trite, it's so important to LIVE FOR TODAY!  Yes, plan for
tomorrow, and yes, make plans that you really are excited about ... but
whenever you find yourself wishing today away so that tomorrow might come,
stop and put yourself into the 'now' and find what you can do to make TODAY
the place that you're happy to be ... when it all comes down to it, that's
all we have.

Pep talk over.

Love, Leslie

I have to agree with Leslie and support her opinion on this .  These guys 
are great and I know a bunch of wonderful people that will be there.  I 
will try to hit both FnF and Theta (never been to FnF and I heard so much 
about it that I just can't miss it).

Have fun this weekend whatever you do,
Hugz,
Branka

P.S.  Come up and say hi at FnF.  I will be wearing...my striped black 
and white pants and a white sports bra :) - long brown hair (down if I am 
not dancing, up if I am :), glow sticks.  I migt change my mind if I go 
shopping on Sat, but will make sure I post what I will be wearing...

Hi Folks

This here newcomer (to the USA, not to raves :) was planning on
doing minor things like find a place to live, get settled
in at work, etc., before heading out into the rave scene.

Strange how plans change. :)

See lots of you at F&F. I'll be wearing a distinctive
smiling sunflower t-shirt and i'll probably be somewhere near
Captain Crunch, who's kindly organised me a ticket.

Your words make all the sense in the world, Leslie.  Last week at the BBQ 
I was thinking that this week would go by at an incredibly slow, 
torturous pace.  Was I ever wrong!  Maybe if I sat at home all day long 
with nothing to do, then the week would crawl by.  Thankfully, most of us 
are quite busy during our weekdays to make them go by faster.  The bad 
thing is that when you are having a really good time, the time also flys 
by.  Sheeze, no wonder the years seem to whiz by - all the more reason to 
follow Leslie's advice and cherish each and every day.  And if you live 
in the moment, anticipation will loosen its grip on your gut a little. :)
Nonetheless, I am excited about tomarrow cause Mel and I will be leaving 
for SF sometime in the afternoon. But I shall appreciate Friday at the 
same time!  

love,
Amy

Dear Lee & All of You;

        No to be cinical, but I heard a very nasty rumor that some parties
were held for Malachy's benefit and the money never got to him, what's up
with this, is it true or false? Enquiring SFR'ers minds want to know.

Peace
Brian

          8 for feel, and 9+ for this wierd vibe about them), and my
          white pancake shirt, unless I can't figure out how to get
          Freedom's brown glow out of it (oooh.. a laundry challenge).

Who has a used 386 or better laptop that they want to part with for cheap?
I want something that can at least run Windoze, and would like something
with a PCMCIA slot.  I don't want a monster "portable" but it doesn't have
to be super light.

Would like:  25Mhz+  but less than Pentium
             Intellipoint or trackball onboard
             4mb of RAM
             At least 300 Mb Hard Drive.
             PCMCIA Modem.
              


I don't really care too much 'bout what software is on it.  I might just run
LINUX off it. ;)

Thanks,
Aaron.

Well, I currently have no idea what I'll be wearing.  But I can tell you have I
about shoulder length, wavy dark brown hair and am 6'2" tall.  I know with all

Dear All;

        I just checked Webcompass from QuaterDeck. Webcompass is FREE
Internet  Search Engine software. What it does is, say you want to search
for Raves or rave related material on the net. It will send the search
request to every search engine publicly available on the net and compile all
the results for ya. Pretty neat; so instead of you having to go to every
search engine on the net, you have but one place to go. This however is bad
news for Internet Bandwidth Activists, because it eats up a lot of bandwidth.

to download the FREE software go to:

http://arachnid.qdeck.com/qdeck/demosoft/

Peace

Hi everybody,

sorry I didn't make it tonight, when I arrived home I found out the plans for
last night had changed rather drastically. By the time I had my hands free
(around 10:30) I wasn't feeling too sociable anymore...
There will be other occasions I'm sure. Thanks Diana for sending me e-mail
last night, unfortunately I could read only this morning. Hope everybody
enjoyed their sushi.

"Sugar Free Jazz" is by Soul Coughing, who are bit outside the main line 
of "acid jazz" (whatever that means), but a great band nonetheless, well 
worth checking out.  "Sugar Free Jazz" is on the album Ruby Vroom.

There are two compilation series, "The Acid Jazz Test" and "This is Acid 
Jazz," that have some pretty good stuff.  I haven't heard all the issues 
(there are 5 so far in "This is Acid Jazz," not sure about the other) but 
my favorite so far is Acid Jazz Test 2.  Abstrakt Workshop is great 
compilation with bit more of a trip-hop feel.  I think Abstrakt Workshop 
2 was recently released, but I haven't seen it.

Malachy was an Irish man who came over here about five years ago and 
started doing parties.  He was one of the first pople involved in both 
Whicked and the full-moon raves as well as doing the first gathering 
parties.  Then, about two years ago he waS driving back from a full-moon 
rave when the vechile that he was driving in had a very bad accident 
which left him parrallized from the neck down.  He then went back to 
Ireland to get better and I saw him here at the last come-unity party 
and, while he was still in a wheelchair, he did look to be getting a lot 
better.  In short, Malachy was one of the founding-father's of the SF 
rave scene and the scene would most probably not be as big as it today if 
it was not for this man.  And, since reconstructive surgey is so 
expensive (even in a country that has free health-care!?) people have 
been having parties from time-to-time to raise money for him.  In fact, I 
do not believe that this is the first F&F party in which the proceeds of 
it have gone to Malachy's health-care fund.

I suspect waiting for these signs is a bit like waiting for the SF Giants 
to win the world series; it just simply is not going to happen in our 
lifetime.

This may have possibly happened, but most of the benefits have been and
continue to be thrown by reputable people who have been close to  
and are still in touch with him.  The fact that Malachy still returns to
SF and shows up at many/most of these events I think testifies to this.

Looks like a raver's weekend of worthy causes.  Obviously I'm
going to be at the one for hyperreal (F&F) but if the Malachy benefit
(Unity) is not too far away I'm going to try and hit that one too.
I hope the Aids (Give It Back!) and BM (Lust for Life) benefits are also
successful.  All worthwhile causes; Freedom of expression and Caring
for folks in need.  These themes transcend politics (i.e. us vs. them)
which is how I prefer raving to be.

Yeah, Dj dan is really cool.  The best tape he ever did was a double 
called the SF project pt1 and side A featured the James Brown tribute 
which contains some of the best mixing that I've ever heard; a definate 
classic.  I believe that it is still available at Ameba (on Haight) even 
though it is about eighteen month's old now.

Imaginary Scenario:
Scene: Friends and Family, 2AM. A police car is parked nearby, and
       a Police Officer (PO) is looking at the id of one Larry Ching (Elsie).
PO: It says here that you're 41 years old. Don't you know you're too
    old to be at a rave ? Go home!
ELSIE: Oh gee Officer! That's my dad's id! Here's mine!
PO: Hey - the lamination's still warm on this! And you don't look 18!
ELSIE: Uh ... I had a long day skateboarding and doing my homework!!!
PO: Yeah,yeah .. we're arresting you for using a fake id! Get in the back
    of the cruiser!
ELSIE: shit ....

 ----

 I figured that, since I've already bought a FnF ticket for tomorrow night,
I'd subscribe back into SFRaves for the weekend to get the latest news
about FnF and this weekend. I'm glad I did - I didn't know that the
proceeds for FnF was going to be going to the Malachy fund instead of
Hyperreal ( will there be a benefit for Hyperreal in the future? ).
That keeps me from feeling guilty about not going to Unity - although
I was strongly tempted to go to both of 'em!

 And then, there is the Burning Man benefit - "Lust For Life". Is this
a benefit for the BM foundation itself, or something similar-sounding?
I called the (415) 437-5797 info number , and the word after
the phrase "...benefit for the Burning Man .." is illegible to me.
Otherwise, sounds interesting too - it's up against some big competition,
tho' .

 How to identify Elsie..er.. Larry Ching? I'm an older asian guy , probably
be wearing a button-mounted FnF smiley face, and also a small clay pendant
around my neck. Clothes - too early to tell.

 Nice to be back for the weekend -

 Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com

Possible but doubtful. I'd believe possible disorganization, leading to
some funding confusion, but that's to be expected when you have 50
promoters from different organizations doing an event together. Malachy's's
directly involved in Unity, so I'd expect things are kosher. I guess he's
the only one who could really say for sure.

Good day,

I would have to agree that the Harmony crew creates  a very special place where ever
they go.  Tom, another new recruit, was inducted into raverdom at one of their parties.
He's been hooked since.  In fact, he's going to his first F&F this weekend.  Melanie 
was kind enough to purchase a ticket for him.  I almost didn't get one myself...too busy 
cooking spaghetti at the BBQ to realize how critical the ticket situation had become.

Take care,
                     Jason

Thanks Anarch,

You saved the day....

ok, next order of business would be:

Does anyone know where I could find Lenny D. and the DarkRaver 
"toDaRhythm"?  Not that I have looked or anything - just want to know if 
y'all have heard it.  OR Omar Santana's "PhatBeats"?

thanks in advance,

Wow! I saw these guys live in a crowd of 10000 at the Big Day Out
(a one-day festival like Lollapollooza (sp?) plus a few dance acts)
in Sydney in February. They were amazing: really energetic and
pushing musical boundaries. They're not really a dance act anymore,
but thrive in uncharted territory between jungle, hip-hop and heavy
metal.

I've found that this definitely depends on what parties you choose.  Some 
are predominantly teenagers and others have an older age distribution.  
I personally enjoy a broad age distribution and not all of one age group.

Dear All;

        As far as EQ setting go, I know there are more generalized wave
patterns for different musical genres. But do you tweak you EQ, for the
differences between Trance & House per say? If, so how are they different?
Just curious?

Correction:  his special FnF crown is now painted with flourescent, 
glow-in-the-dark green paint.  I put smileys and stars and stuff all over it.

There is an interview with "Trainspotting" author Irvine Welsh in Spin.  
He gives much credit to the Scottish rave scene for inspiration.  He said 
he wanted to tell a story in his writing "just like a DJ."  
I have started reading his book from last year, with a strange title I 
can't recall now.   He gives thanks to his favorite clubs in the forward.
His new book is called "Ecstacy."  It is three stories about the drug and 
other means of reaching ecstacy.  A man on E sees a thalidomide victim and 
swears revenge on the corporation responsible.  A woman with a drug 
addict boyfriend takes E, changing her life.  For more info, do a  
Altavista search on "irvine welsh" +Ecstacy, it'll be under e-tour.
I'm going to the 9:45 showing at the Kabuki.  Hope to see some of you there!

It's time for another mike-wants-to-flesh-out-his-music-collection post!

This time, I'm looking for *mainstrean* german happy
trance/gabber/hardcore. Stuff along the lines of Members of Mayday,
Westbam, Marusha, Chill'n'Force, Dr. Robotniko, Scooter, and others. I've
got Happy Rave '95, I've got RaveBasePhase3 and RaveMachineVol.2 (the
polish bootleg double tape sets! =) and I need more... To my knowledge
there aren't any local DJs who spin this, but It's so big in Europe that
VIVA (Germnay's MTV) rolls out Gabber videos during primetime! (they're
surprisingly calm, considering the nature of the music-- very slick
computer 3D animations from Mark'Oh and Dune...)

so... can anyone help? I want dj mixtapes, CDs, non-mixed stuff, whatever.
I'm going to Poland this winter (maybe) and I'll be passing through Berlin
so if anyone knows of German DJs to look for, or CDs to buy (despite the
ridiculously high price of CDs in Germany =P ) drop me a line.


Oh yeah, there's a stack of y'all who need to find me at FnF to pick up
your t-shirts. Here's what I look like: 6'0", green SFR shirt, blue jeans
(shorts or pants, I'm not sure yet. gotta figure out what the weather's
like on saturday), butt-parted short-ish brown hair with bleached bangs,
and brown airwalks. Or you can just ask people who already have shirts
where I am... I know enough SFRavers to make it easy for someone to point
me out.

see everyone there! I can't wait...

Picked up a recently released copy of DJ DAN Live @ Simon's in Florida
from BPM (also @ Ameba) one of the best DAN tapes to date IMO.

Leslie, our beautiful rave big sista ;) you are so right about living life
in the moment . . .

For me, up until an hour ago when the project I've been working on was
finally done and I crawled home to crash, this week has been about 15 hour
workdays, where there was so much stuff to do that even as you wish it was
over you can't help living in the moment.  This sort of work pace doesn't
happen often, or I'd be dead, but it does happen to me two or three times a
year.  I don't always love my work, but it is my choice.

And because there was so much work to do before the deadline, time was
flying, and now my four-day weekend has started a few hours early (I'm
taking Monday & Tuesday off for the Further festival shows in Sacramento
and Shoreline).

Knowing that my first big fnf was this weekend, and then two days off,
sustained me really well during this hellish week.  All the postitive fun
energy i've been storing and haven't been able to express (until this
morning, when sleep deprivation & then the end of the work has made me
fairly giddy) will be pouring out of me tomorrow :)

I have a comment on this thought:

>so that you can get to an experience that you HOPE will make you happy!

The experience doesn't make you happy -- YOU make yourself happy by what
you bring to the experience and how you feel it.  Of course, some events
have the vibe more than others, and other people can feel the presence or
absence of it and it affects their experience. But it's up to us all to
bring the vibe with us wherever and whenever we can.

see you all tomorrow night!  Until then it's time to rest, get prepared,
rest, and take some vitamins!  And maybe watch a little Olympics.

peace,

Dear All;

        Simon's in G-Ville, Florida is an awesome SE Coast dedicated Techno
venue, I've personally spent many a nights at. The vibe down there is
awesome because it's a small town, everyone literally knows everyone else.
But people travel from city to city down there like a little dead thang. I
traveled around Orlando, Gainesville, Jacksonville, ..etc. But routinely met
people from Georgia, and the pan handle The E is very, VERY, VERY strong,
not for the weak of heart, and people are just plain party crazy, nitrous &
special K everywhere. 
        Gainesville is hot north central florida and home to the beautiful &
totally natural Florida parie, lots o alligators, University of Florida, An
Army Base, & 14 Prisons; including serial killer Danny Rolins. 

        Lot more Latino/Brass influence especially the closer you get to
Miami. Florida is rad, it's where this soul, bonded to the soul of Techno
Vibe. I when back there to Simon's & Florida recently to see Sasha spin,
twice, I had serious  tears of  joy when I walked into Simon's at midnight,
because it hadn't changed(no sarcasms present).

        Check out Simon's the only Nationally rated club that I know that I
can say has vibe. The South East Coast scene is all clubs.

Peace
Brian

          Well,

          I've spent some time on sound... for Trance and the really
          synthy stuff, I'd keep the mids flat, a little (4db) bump
          around 8k (hi hats), and a gradual bass rise starting at 200
          hz to about 40 hz (where it should be about +0-+8 depending
          on room, speaks and mix).  For house I would boost the
          bass some more, but my favorite thing about house tends
          to be the bass (not a big piano sample and divas fan).
          For jungle, I turn the bass down a bit, and turn up upper
          mids (so you can hear the trademark 'busy toms' sound).
          One thing I've noticed is people try to boost the bass at
          the EQ... this sucks because of the severe distortion
          present in most EQ's.  I tend to just put more power amps
          and speaks after the crossover for the subs to get that
          happy jolly house/techno/acid bass.

          For home use (i.e. no active crossovers..) remember that
          EQ's usually are not ideal, and boost signals in excess of
          the range the claim to.  When boosting bass near the volume
          threshold of your speakers/amp, remember set it up flat and
          crank it.

          Turn up the super lows until the test muzik sound yummy.

          Turn down the higer bass freq's (around 100hz) till the
          muddiness goes away.  This is the most valueable tip I have,
          and I used it a LOT... it doesn't seem to make sense (more
          bass by cutting bass) but it really does work.

          Turn the highs up a little (most home systems aren't capable
          of causticly loud highs).

          Should be good.

          Take Care,
          See you Saturday...

        How do you get your e-mail to look so nice? Is it automated, or
manual and time consuming.

Hello everybody-

 I met alot of you at the BBQ last week, but I hope to meet many more of you at 
FnF.  I really don't know what I'll be wearing, but look for the tallest person 
in the building and it will be me.  Being 6'9" does have some advantages. 
 For all those people who wrote to me during the week, I will have some mixtape 
copies, although they won't be the set from the BBQ (I'm hoping to get my own 
copy at FnF).  Hope to see you!!!

-Todd

Well, look for the shortest person, and that'll be me :) 
Being 5' (well, almost) has some advantages too...as soon as 
I think of one I'll let you know...oh yea, checking out the

heya all.. Well.. I definately want to be at F&F this weekend, but if that
means going without my girlfriend who is leaving in 3 weeks, I will probably
be at Unity instead..  If you want to help me out with a ticket.. I'll be so
very grateful!  Unity sounds like it should be a phat massive though..
Dubtribe and Freaky Chakra throwing down the live jams, and Carlos and Dan
ripping up the tables. ;)  Plus lots of other good talent.

Wherever I'll be this weekend, I'll have a black Chemical Awareness  "XTC"
shirt on that shows the structural formula of mdma.  Plus, my black backpack
w/ alien head and SFraves badge.  And brown and blue Airwalks.  I don't know
what pants I'll be wearing yet though.  I might also be wearing a polyester
shirt with brown cranes.. and a black Xtra Large racing jacket w/ white
stripes if it's cold.

Is there going to be a Sunset this weekend?  Any word on Mantra?

<HUGS> Have a safe and Vibe filled weekend!
Aaron.

HELLo!


Anyone heard of a program run by Microsoft at their web site that allows them
to search your hard drive when you access them, looking for
unregistered/cracked programs?  'Twas a rumor I heard from a friend of mine
and I just wanted to cross reference it with all you
smarter-than-I-about-computers folks.  Is it possible for anyone look at what
is on your drive when you access a site?

Scared,

hello all-

it's friday.  people weren't meant to work on fridays.  except for my
company.  i'm fixing some brain-dead program called gnats that won't install
correctly, my boss is on my ass to get it working correctly, and it's sunny
outside.

ARGH!!!!

well, i must appreciate where i am, for i choose to be here, frustrating as
it might sometimes be.  so, i shall go back to my wonderful workstation,
type some more, sweat some more, and i will like it!


love to you all-

J,

This was a rumor that started when Win95 came out.  It was a hidden 
little goodie that was supposed to check serial numbers of all MS 
Software on your drive whenever it found you on the net.

This would suck.

The last we heard of (November 94) Win95 was planning to put this in.  I 
haven't heard anything since - but MS is probably doing it and a whole 
lot more.

Then again, I work at Apple so I don't deal with this crap.

goodLuck,
Brandon Brown

I believe that there was some controversy about this a while back. It only
happens if you are using the Microsoft Network software, and as I recall,
there was such an outrage about it, MS killed the "feature" in their later
releases of the software.
So, the answer is NO, your hard drive CANNOT be accessed merely by
accessing a site or anything else on the Net for that matter.

yes, it is.  i know a company (which company it is shall remain confidential
lest i be sued majorly)  that is currently developing such a product for
them as we speak.  i'm not sure if such a program exists already, but it
would not be too difficult to engineer.
scary, isn't it?

	I don't think any of the official java classes let them do this, but if 
you're running MS Explorer, all bets are off.  On the other hand they got a lot 
of shit last time they tried this (with the W95 beta).

	Now that MS is in bed with AT&T for Internet stuff, I'm sure we can 
expect more of this in the brave new world.

hello =) everyone

Mantra is having a free outdoor event this Sunday ('cos we've been forced out
of the Clementina space for the night!!) Things will be back to normal next
week.
We haven't decided the exact location yet, but check our info line (415 331
1500 xt 888) we should have it posted by Sunday morning. 
Anna is spinning trance there along with Dutch, Surge and Theta Blip, and who
else....I'm not sure yet!
It should be a beautiful location and a sweet evening.
Love and light

Hello!  Yes, with much delight I will be at F&F (and for the record I
only bought one ticket for me :) .   As for what I'll be wearing  I
won't know until tomorrow night so who knows other than it will be
one of my rave T-shirts.  I should wear my "anti-Felix" shirt if
Brandon B. will wear his Felix shirt.  :-)  I'm 6'1", just past shoulder
length very light brown hair which may or may not be in a pony tail,
depending on how hot it is inside.

So, if you see me, please say hi - and hugz n' smiles are always available. :)

Lost @ the BBQ on Saturday:  one yellow sport bottle that had the name
of some Dr. Mark V (something) from Cupertino.  Not a monetarily valuable
item, but it was one of my only bottles that actually sealed! Useful for
raves and biking.  If anyone happened to have picked it up, lemme know.

 Comment on the availability of F&F tickets.
 As with any event that has more people wanting to go than there are
 tickets available, those not acquiring a ticket will be disappointed.
 So, it's not the end of life if that happens, right?
 I think F&F did a very fair and even-handed job of distributing the
 tickets.   I noticed some people suggesting leaving them at certain
 record stores in SF or Berkeley, but to me that's not much of a solution.
 Being in the South Bay that renders them almost as unavailable to me
 as it would to those who couldn't make it to the BBQ, for example.

For those of you going to FnF - see you there
Have a great weekend!

Peace

Wooo hold on there...this is scary stuff! I would call that trespassing,
and a violation of my civil and personal property rights. If they are
doing this.
1. Is there a way to protect yourself from this sort of invasion?
2. Something needs to be done, like a letter writing campaign to microsoft
and our legislators.

Here's another poll question for y'all: who's got a recommendation for
shoes that are comfortable for both dancing and everyday wear?  I'm looking
for brand name and style; I bought a pair of Reeboks that seemed
comfortable, but the more I wear 'em, the more they hurt the top of my left
foot on the right side, where the laces are pushing the tongue against the
foot.  Also interested in shoes with good arch support, as I have inverted
arches (you should see my footprints!).  Thanks!  - E

Ok, the facts. 

1. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator (possibly others)
make use of a data type called a 'cookie'. This data is normally simple
basic stuff used by the browser. That data can be read by the server.
Bot Netscape and MS allow you to turn off the cookie reporting function
of the browser. 

2. Any Java enabled browser is a possible security breach. There was a
loophole in the java classes that allowed an applet to affect the
computer beyond the Java virtual machine. This has been fixed, however,
java is so new that there are probably lots of undiscovered  security
holes left.

3. Win95 and WinNT make extensive use of a file called the Registry.
This is a flat file database of the machine and user settings (kind of
like a giant *.ini file). All 32-bit apps (and most 16 bit) will be
defined in the registry. There are tools that make use of the registry
for software metering and client inventory. All of them require a client
side agent to be installed to function. 

I don't much like microsoft either but this is a false rumor.

Well, I love my Doc Martins, both boots & shoes.  But they have 2 
drawbacks:  They feel pretty heavy on your feet after hours of dancing, 
and:         Not very high arch support.  
But they do last for YEARS and look good with casual wear or work wear.  
I've worn mine nearly every single day for the last 3 years and the soles 
are still as good as new.

love,
Amy

Someone made the excellent point that, after 11pm, the Bay Bridege
eastbound can experience up to 2 hour delays....

FnF is in the east bay so we suggest you cross that bridge before 11...

  I believe that Netscape maintains a "Cookie" file that can be accessed by
web pages.  This may be only on Mac, but I know there are utilities to deal
with this.  I think one is called (originally) - "Kill Cookie".  Maybe
getting this and reading the docs (even if you don't use a mac) may answer
your questions.

Yeah!  I was there and I was phat..3 and 1/2 hrs of some crazy phat beats

What's up madame mercury, liquid, adam, whom I got the pleasure of meeting
last night (Xcept 4 our lunitic) .  Sorry m mercury I didn't understand/ or
hear what you were saying when you were leaving, I guess I didn't reallize
you were leaving. One of my friends was very sick (alcohol/e) and I was
tring to see if she was going to be ok.  I definatly could of used those
sticks for the rest of DAN'S set.
   They closed off the the upstairs of the deli which brought everyone into
one room but made the dance floor very hot and crowded.  Still don't like
the deli but at least they don't have that anoying security posted next to
the sicks.  The other dj I heard, Spinner, was ok.  He seemed to be playing
all the records too slow for me/ more mellow.
     Since I have to work sat. night and I don't have any infamous F&F tix
I will probably check out UNITY.

PEACE out....

Austin

Yeah I'll be there! I'll probably be wearing my "People X-ing" Full 
Circle shirt again, and I'll have more laminates for those who didn't 
get one yet. If you see me make sure you say "Hi!"since unfortunately, 
this will be my last "Friends & Family" :(

I must retort:

If you're breaking the law in the first place, I think they have every

Howdy y'alls! (for those of you who think I have a country accent! ;)

Yes, in spite of the wise words of our RaveFriend Leslie (fish eggs & 
shrimp heads to ya mah darlin! ;), I am still giddy with excitement 
over the prospect of our impending weekend! :) 

My description:  exactly the same (as it turns out) as my description 
for Beautiful People:  Small spandex-ish shirt with silver & black 
swirly pattern all over it.  comfy old jeans (with a really dirty butt 
if you find me later in the evening! ;)  silver airwalks with day-glow 
designs painted on them, my neckload o' shit- old & new sfraves 
laminates, FnF ticket, FnF patch, neon-orange Basics ticket from April, 
and usually a pink glow-stick or two.  5'8", shoulder length brown 
hair, medium build.  This time I'll have my rave newbie friend Joanie 
in tow (some of you met her at the bbq, altho she couldn't stay long).  
Do me a favor everybody and treat her real nice! :)  (and hint: she 
looooves back- & hand-rubs! :)

Hee hee!

Hey all you raver kiddies,

You touch on an important point there. I'll get back to it.

Methinks that's not quite how the whole rave thing works. Here's a
comment by Paul Hartnoll of Orbital:
   "Whereas punk was 'Come on, let's smash the system, lets knock 'em
   down', the whole dance music thing is more like people saying 'We
   don't like this life that we've been given so we're just going to
   do our own thing anyway'. And it's actually so much more effective
   because it is actually living by example, it's like I'm not just
   going to try and smash the Tories [conservatives] down, I'm just
   going to live contrary to them." -Dream Creation 10, p11
   
While i agree with Paul that rave/dance culture is preferrable to punk
as a counter-cultural movement, i don't agree that it was actually
more effective. Until very recently, that is.

Lets have a look at history of counter-cultural movements. Kath
Williamson (i think) pointed out on Ausrave that recent
counter-cultural/musical movements have happened in roughly
ten-year cycles.

1956: Rock and Roll
Philosophy: Fuck your staid attitudes, we're having a good time,
   stay out of our way or there'll be trouble.
Limitation: "Rebel Without a Cause" syndrome. Staid attitudes
   don't make much of a potent symbol for rebellion.
   
1966: Pschedelia & Hippies
Philosophy: Your attitudes are uncool, we'll show you an alternative.
Limitation: 'Turn the other cheek' doesn't stand up to pressure
   that well. Once the authorities convinced himselves that it was
   ok to beat up hippies on mass (e.g. Reagan calling in the
   National Guard to Berkeley), they became marginalised in the
   public eye.
   
1976: Punk
Philosophy: Fuck your attitudes, fuck the system, fuck you. Punk was
   Rock and Roll with more attitude and a powerful symbol: the whole
   system.
Limitation: The whole system was too powerful. Punk was 
   ultimately futile fury.

1986: House/Rave/Dance Culture
Philosophy: Your attitude sucks, we'll do things our own way, stay
    out of our way or there might be trouble. This was an attempt
    to find the middle path between Pschedelia's weakness and
    Punk's ineffective fury. The first post-modern counter-cultural 
    movement. :)
Limitation: Without an explicit political philosphy, Rave didn't
    achieve much except it's own survival. (Though it was remarkably
    successful at this: Rave is healthier after ten years than Punk
    or the hippy thing was.)

1996: ???

I think we can see what is happening now. The music is evolving
as always, and becoming more mainstream-palatable without
losing it's integrity. A music reviewer for the Sydney Morning
Herald said that Trip-Hop and Fusion were "letting todays kids
listen to the music that their parents were listening to," which
is partially true. The Prodigy makes Jungle palatable to
Metal-Heads. (Remember that Metal's turned 21. Even Homer Simpson
was into it. :) Hop/Fusion unites Reggae and Rave. Result:
thousands of people of all types turn up to a protest party in
London.

Popular appeal lets rave develop politics (both "popular" and
"politics" comes from the Latin for "of the people"). Not the
futile "smash the system" politics of punk, but single-issue 
politics with simplicity and immediate interest. 

So we get small daylight/evening protest parties in Sydney about
police brutality (April 1995), French nuclear testing at Muroroa
Atoll (late 1995/early 1996), and logging of old-growth native
forests (eraly 1996). And unauthorised street parties in
London protesting about road building and car culture (mid 95,
mid 96) culminating in 7000 people partying on a freeway
earlier this month.

Whoah! All they're all valid points, but don't try handling them
all at once.

Remove the elitism by taking the politics to the people.
Pick single issues that effect People Like Us. And use raves
as a protest. It seems to work elsewhere.

No one has the right to invade my personal property without a search
warrant. I agree with you that if you are breaking the law...you take you
rown risks, but your logic would also allow any authority/corporation to
search your car/house/person without just cause.

Hey all those reggae gurus

I know many of you listen to BOB so I'm sure someone might know about this.
I remember around this time last year they had a reggae on the river
concert/festival around the American river.  Much it was a lot a fun.
Well, I was wondering if there was going to be one this year or was that a
one time concert/tour?

One love,
Austin


Did you know-

Bob Marley wrote many songs on the back porch of 56 Hope Road.  Many
mornings/days, as spliffs were rolled, the seeds from the herb would be
thrown onto the ground where birds would pick them up in their beaks.  This
inspired the song "Three Little Birds" (one of my favorites) from the trio
of ground doves picking up seeds.

Hi everyone,

As you all know,  a year or so ago,  I went to Australia,  and one of the
main persons I met while in Australia (A true AusRaver) Jeremy Lawrance,
is now here in the Bay Area,  apparently working down in San Jose.

It is now MY turn to show him a good time,  and to introduce him to the
SFRave scene.   Because my friend Craig Wilson is still up in Lake county,
and can't make F&F,   I'm making the extra ticket I got available for Jeremy.

So,   give him a good welcome to our scene....  As he did for me,  while
I visited Australia...  Yay!!   Friends and Family....  Just ONE MORE
day,  and already I got this big phat cheshire cat grin my my face just
thinking about F&F....

Good point.  However, if all I knew was being searched was a serial 
number would I be as pissed as if someone was going through my house or 
my anal cavity looking for drugs?  Probably not, but I think that this is 
still in violation of constitutional rights....well, hmmm...I dunno, all 
this really does is afford hackers motive (as we have already seen 
accomplished according to previous posts).

Hi all!

 Wow. I'm so tired!! Green day had many problems. The location was 
changed at the last moment and then the dance studio wouldn't let us set 
up from 6-9pm due to already booked dance classes. My ride (provided by 
the promoters in exchange for my work) got me to the studio at about 
4:30 pm on thursday so we did not have a lot of time. :(

 We started late of course but the two rooms; main dance floor with GOA 
and trance/acid flowing and INCREDIBLE black lite paintings and the 
ambient room with a phatty sound system (thanks Dutch!) which looked very 
spectral, were pretty happening. The mayan calendar glph readings went 
off well and there were a lot of incredible chance meetings. 
Unfortunately the police did swing by and shut down the party at about 
2-3 am (?). We let people who were not in any condition to drive stay and 
then started music up again about an hour later (subdued of course).

 Biggest problems were people flakking on helping which caused those of 
us dedicated to work much harder (I came up from Santa Cruz with a LOT of 
equipment and was sound engineer for the Stephan and Martin Kent drum/dig 
ritual, worked my ass off for free AND ended up sweeping, mopping and doing
other assorted lovely chores). Also the system interface between me and 
the DJ mixer wasn't optimum (Pro level audio driving consumer level 
electronics) and with the time and energy crunch it was not very feasible 
to trouble shoot the system to perfection. It worked but I was not pleased.

 The drum/dig ritual was very nice with an impromptu opening invocation by 
a visiting high priestess (very strange but evocative). One guy who 
showed up playing the D'Jhimbe (sp?) was incredible as well as the guest 
kit drummer. After that stuff (lasted about 80 minutes or so with some 
really wild dancing) I was on for the rest of the night. But due to the 
audio problems I just DJ'ed in a Very rElaxed way rather much actually 
performing (although I was playing my analog synth with the ritual folks) 

 My favorite part of the whole evening was meeting some really incredible 
people; Raven, Dagny. Beverly ( I'm sorry honey :( ), Robert and Amy 
(thanks for the shower!!), Allen, Surge, Stephen and Martin Kent (you 
guys were beautiful!!). My sympathies to Dutch for his health problems. 
The couple times I did get to dance I really loved all the swirling acid 
soundz being pumped out.


Peace ya alls

I concur on cutting the mid-high bass.  Overdriving in the 80-120 Hz range
is the single biggest sin I hear from most sound techs.

drove from sf-berkeley an hour ago

the familiar & accurate blinking blue sign on the Oakland side said next
"subject to delay" is from 1-5 am on Tuesday & Wednesday night 7/30 & 7/31,
and there was smooth sailing past the construction sight tonight.

It still wouldn't hurt to leave from sf earlier than usual for Fnf, but
don't stress about sitting in traffic for two hours . . . it shouldn't
happen.

I've got lots of pictures (many of them really funny!) that still need to
be scanned... including ones from mantra, the Light campout, harmony beach
party, syntonic, SFR bbq, etc. etc.  I'm working on this -- more should be
up by the middle of next week.  There are quite a few up already from other
events over the last couple of months for your viewing pleasure. 

Also -- the page has been revamped and is a little prettier now, even if
several of the sections are incomplete...  it's also at a new location!

Take care,

It's 2:30 and I just got home from a small house party.  Turn on the TV to
catch something that will put me to sleep after a good evening.  I catch
the news.  A bomb has gone off at the Central Plaza in Atlanta.  Many hurt,
many more scard.  This such bullshit.  A BOMB has gone off at a place where
the world has gathered to come together for many more reasons than
competition.  I'm watching CNN and seeing alot of pain, suffering,
confusion.  I am now sad.  This really puts a damper on not only my evening
but a lot of other peoples and the whole concept of an Olympic games event.
This days after one of our airplains has tragically been destroyed by a
possible bomb as well.  Why as people so selfish for thier personal goals;
trying to make an impression, get a message across, or get attention by
dangerous means.

My heart goes out to all the people in Atlanta and around the world touched
by this disasterous event.

PEACE!

Austin

	for those of you who don't know, i'm in atlanta and
	was about two blocks from the park when the explosion
	happened.  we're here working on www.nike.com.

	my good larry springer works there in the park...

	ok, larry paged me from his hotel, he's fine fine fine.
	i had been very worried about him; as coverage learned
	more about the incident, every minute the location of
	the blast was pinpointed closer to his location.

	the story is that he called me today and invited me 
	down to tour his workplace.

	he's a lighting designer, and did the lights at the att
	pavillion at centennial park (which has now been renamed
	by the media "olympic park" which is absurd).  you have
	all by now seen the tape of the bomb going off, that 
	white tower there is exactly where he works (worked),
	second level.  anyway, he called and asked me to come
	down tonight, and check out his gig.  special plug to 
	emily and the writers here at nike for giving me what i
	thought was a whole too many audio quotes.  thanx :)
	this basically made me miss the incident.

	anyway, this richard fellow, who found the bomb, was
	the guy i was supposed to find to get access to the 
	mix tower, actually.  he is the security guard for the
	tower.

	larry told me that richard found the package, and they 
	were evacuated from the mix tower.  their attitude was
	"ok, bomb scare, fine whatever".  this was their second 
	bomb scare, one was a few weeks ago.  so a couple minutes
	later, the thing went off.

	larry is experienced in stage work, including pyro, and
	did not think this was that big or loud.  of course, stage
	pyro is controlled and directed.  anyway, afterwards he 
	approached and saw a number of people on the ground, most
	"writhing" and one of them "still".  he sort of diddn't
	know why there was so much commotion. he was then shooed out	
	by security, even though some of the cops were asking for 
	the lights to be turned on.
	
	outside it's kind of nuts.  i tried to get to nike park to 
	deliver fresh camera batteries and other gear but they 
	stopped us within a block.  those damn betacams are heavy 
	as hell, i lugged it four miles all around the entire 
	georgiadome/omni/cnn plaza to try to get in, but the
	cop was rather sure we could not go in.  he did tell us
	that they have a word for "us" (i was with a film crew)
	but that he'd rather not say what it was.  i told him 
	that that does go both ways.  we caught a cab back to 
	nike hq on marietta, and here i am now.  

	as far as security goes, it's tight and it's not.  for 
	instance, there are metal detectors and bag searches at
	all events.  however, had i converted the bowerbook i 
	was carrying into a bomb, i could have blown up the men's
	gymnastics final because the security volunteers did
	not make me turn it on like they do in airports.  the
	security at centennial park does not do any searching
	or metal-screening, though they were certainly careful
	about not letting me in with my rollerblades on.  as
	usual, priorities.

	also, i came out of my apartment building this morning
	to immediately be hustled around by secret service agents.
	apparently al gore was nearby, and i even got to see him.
	<http://www.organic.com/Staff/caliban/jwz/Imagez/gore1.jpg>
	at what point can security be tight enough?  i was close
	enough to cause him harm, had i that intention as well 
	as the intention to die myself.  i kind of like the old 
	elvis guy, despite what his wife tried to do to rock 'n
	roll.

	this terrorism sucks.  i hope it's not indicative of a
	police state to come.

	anyway, i think i am going to go find some breakfast.
	this will be a night where sleep is impossible, one of thos
	two day periods that pass percieved as one, long, thick day.

If anyone wants to meet up with me at F&F (and I can't imagine why you 
would) I'm the big tall loud English guy with the never ending pipe and 
I'll be wearing my 50th aniversery LSD t-shirt.  Will probably be in the 
ambient room for most of night (because I am SO fluffy); pop by for a smoke.

Also, don't forget that, after August 1st, the Fell Street exit of 101 
will be closed for three month's (a total bummer as I live on Fell) for 
reconstruction work.  I think that other exits are going to be closed as 
well.  Check it out by ringing up SF City Hall and ask for the road and 
traffic department for more details.

hmm, ok. im sure some people out there arent going to like what i have to 
say about the bomb thing, but hey, this is probably more realistic then 
saying the CIA did it. 

basicly, we had it coming. the reasons are that a certain presendent 
decided to put the United States in everyother countrys bussiness. The 
Serbs hate us, all of the Middle East hates us (for those of you who dont 
know, we're (USA) now running Saudi Arabia), about a half-dozen 
African groups hate us, and oh, not to forget about the South American 
groups that hate us, Along with Communists in Russia.

another reason, when you put 30,000+ security guards in one spot, its 
asking for someone to test out the security and see how good it really 
is. 

now then, we can basicly assume a police state is coming. why? well 
because of Bubba from Arkansas saying things like "a cop on every corner 
in America" and other insane ideas about having more cops. are more cops 
gonna solve the problem? of course not, look at Ireland. they've got a 
bomb going off everyweek over there, and there is no constitution. the 
cops can do what they like to you. stop you. search you. detain you for
ever, etc. but still the IRA gets the bombs off.  a police state doesnt 
work. 

why would some group do this? to get total media attention. 6 months from 
now the media will still be talking about it. hell, if you can make it 
look like someone else did it, and not your group, then thats even better!

oh and btw, if the CIA did this, everyone at that concert would have been 
in little bitty pieces. ;)

To quote Richard. H.Kirk:
"The penial body is a small conical body arising from the third eye 
ventricle in the human brain.  In hte middle ages, scientists claimed 
it to be the seat of the soul: a little later they said it was the 
vestigal third eye.  Before long they'll conclude that it is all 
three.
Seeing used to an active sence.  The pineal body used to emmit it's own 
internal ray which, together with the suns light, made all of creation 
shimmer like a tapestry illuminated by light from the seat of the soul.  
Then they invented telivision and the preponderence of artificial light 
caused the penial body to atrophy, and we lost our ability to see nature 
by the light of our own internal ray.  That's why only so-called 
primative people can see the spirit world, because they still have active 
penial bodies.
Go out to the bush late at night.  If you don't have a soul you will not 
be able to see.  The moon won't help you.  You can only see by the light 
of your own internal ray.  It's the one way to find out if your pineal 
body still exists.

Remember: the mind is like a sieve, used to strain from memory the grit and 
splinters of a violent age.  The structure of the Human brain makes us 
record each and every image thAt we see, yet our recollection is the mesh 
on which those millions-upon-millions of pictures of the past are sifted 
through, for the benefit of conscious present."

As already stated, seeing used to be an active sense.

Tristan.

[ to eric & sfraves ]

 If you know that you're going to be in a place where your toes won't be
stepped on, a pair of padded sole Etonics are good ( unless you want 
something more stylish in appearance ).

 If running/walking style shoes are what you want, try doing some research
at the public library - that's how I decided to buy my Etonics. Mostly
looking through back issues of running magazines. 

 I just bought a pair of Red Wing safety leather athletic shoes with
steel toes and ankle support - I use them for outdoor events, and for
times when I feel my toes need the protection ( crowded raves and
concerts with mosh pits ) They feel good - a lot heavier than your
regular "running" style shoe, of course.

Good morning everybody,
If I may, I'd like to ask if anyone out there possibly, just maybe, 
hypothetically, theoretically, conceivably, hopefully, or perhaps even
definitely could help me in my day-long quest for (gulp) *3 F&F TIX*
(Yes, I know that request sounds phenomenally unrealistic, and perhaps
even a bit presumptuous or brazen, but let me explain).
In the true spirit of summer raving that we all know so well, two now
very-good friends of mine who had never been to a rave just a few months
ago, have fallen in love with the San Francisco scene--I've taken them to 
raves all summer, and we've bonded and had a fantastic, magical time, and
I've told them over and over how good Friends and Family is. Due to a
complicated ticket mix-up which I will not bore you with, however, they
are suddenly ticket-less, and Darin's girlfriend, who is flying in from
Washington tonight, is also empty-handed.
   I know that I am probably caught in an insurmountable obstacle--one
ticket would be Wonka-esque; three seems like an excessively ambitious
goal, but if any kind soul who has an extra or extras could email me or
ring me up, at 510.845.8481, I would be eternally grateful and would owe
you a proverbial 'one' big-time.  Also, you'll get the added kick of
seeing my mates and I in full drag tonight--I made my friends promise that
if we somehow got tix, they had to go in dramatic fashion! 
  So if you're low on karma and/or high on ticket quantity, and could
contact poor little me *sniff* *whimper* :) I would be undyingly thankful.
rubbing my rabbit's foot,
Timothy

Reggae on the River is an annual.  I've never been, but I've heard it's
awesome (actually on the way up to Tribal Future from a friend, Ray).
Unfortunately, I also I heard it sold out weeks ago . . . I think it may
even be next week?  Anyone really know . . . ?

I've just had a resurgence in my BOB listening, as I've come across some
unreleased live stuff that's amazing . . . and I had an awesome time at the
Ziggy Marley concert at the Warfield in feb., and one of my deadhead taper
friends smuggled in a DAT and got a great recording of it (tape-trading
hint)

actually, raving has also rekindled my dub interest . . . i'd like to see
an all-dub room at an underground, and love it when an occasional reggae
beat gets thrown in  . . .

Hi,

It's tonight, finally! I'm already moved!

This is the first time I've done a description. I go to alot of
parties, but I don't usually meet people cause I'm too busy
dancing. I'm Darrel. I'm be wearing the green nylon jacket sometimes,
and maybe my blue meanie tee, long brown hair, 6'2" normal dude. I'll
be easier to spot by my girlfriend, Genie, a stunning asian woman who
is very excited that she gets to wear her tight lime green
pants-suit. Also with us will be Jessica and her newbie friend
Sue. Please say hi, we're all on the shy side, but very loving people.

Can't wait to dance, cause I'm tainted by trance!

Hi All!!!

 Well I've been graced with a way in to FnF tonight and work that was 
scheduled for 7am on Sunday has been cancelled so I can go!!!!! =) =) =) =)

 I'll be wearing a F8 black bicyclists shirt with blue panels on the side 
and baggy blu jeans. I may have a few laminates on ( depends on how vulgar 
I feel ;) ). I hope everyone has a great time!!!

 Thanks to the folks who have posted about the Atlanta bomb tragedy.

I just wanted to wish many of you an evening filled with love, growth and
sharing tonight at Friends and Family.  Seeking for Love to attend this
event with full-on vibe is not an easy task, for there are some out there
who seek nothing but to ridicule and challenge the positivity of Love.

Focus, courage, and dedication are required full-on for the vibe to come as
so many hope.  Hope, in itself, is also quite powerful.  Of course, I am not
telling many of you anything new...just wanted to express myself!  :)

I know this event always makes me re-think about what the words "friends"
and "family" really and truly mean to us.  For us.  There are some out there
who call themselves "friends" but are nothing more than wolves in sheeps
clothing, as they say.  And there are some out there who claim to do what is
best for the "family" when in essence, they are seeking to destroy it
because they are terribly misguided.  But there are a growing number of us
who seek to shine our light, stand and encourage others towards finding
Truth so they too may grow and share a special and almost hidden joy.  

I just hope and pray for each of you tonight that Love will indeed shine
from your beautiful souls and from beyond...the source.  And I also wish
each of you the best on the path of courage to not accept imitations and to
stand up for that which we hold so dear.  Love.

All my best to you tonight!

Dear All;

        There is currently no active laws that protect you from this sorta
thing. Cyberspace is undefined when it comes to the law, interpretations
will have to be made, and then but to the US Supreme Court test. Make sure
the people you elect to office are computer literate, liberal, and pro
internet liberty.

Peace
Brian

ps I had another thought regarding Totally Sick, ya know most of the worlds
software is designed right here in California, aka LIBERAL LAND. Got ya, WE
will get our message across one way or another, hehe!!!!!!!!

Dear All;

        With regard to F&F tonight, I've noticed that people here in SF
don't get dressed up, or spend that much money on their party clothes. I
totally understand the quality of a scene/party is not based on what people
wear. But if the SF scene was compared to New York, LA, and/or London, we
would be the worst dressed group of ravers out there I'm so sorry to say. 

        It would be nice if people at least for this event went all out.

        I'm 6'1", 180LBS(very thin), below the mid back long brown hair, and
emerald green eyes(greener than any creature on da planet). I'll be wearing
a pair of Lip Service black vinyl plants, along with a pair of below the
knee soft black leather boots from Parachoc with reflective strips up the
back of each, either a Black, or Dark Blue Pose or Verso reflective/laser
art shirt, along with my totally reflective Verso jacket, a black Hookup's
Hat, & + accessories. I'm my own light source. Dress to impress, dress to
party. Eat your heart out LA & London. 

Peace
Brian

Nancy and I are now leaving to go shopping and find something fun to wear 
at our local thrift shops.  We will definitely be going all out for 
this.  So look for the two of us.  We plan on being in full 
regalia!!  New York-L.A. watch out!!!

look into your car with AMAZING CLARITY, AND THE STATE POLICE HAVE ACCESS TO
THEM AT MANY CONVENIENT ROADSIDE LOCATIONS. So before you light up, look
around and make sure you are not being watched. Trust me when I say that
this is correct and accurate information.

Hello. My ride to FnF fell through  =(  So i'm in search
of another ride. I live in Santa Cruz, and I have an 
extra ticket for whoever could give me a ride  =)

If you are interested in helping me, please call me
@ 408.457.7726...  It's the Cloud Factory Voicemail number...
Go ahead and leave a message (i'll be running erands and
won't be near my home phone, so this is more reliable
right now...)

Please do not email me if you can give me a ride, because
i won't have access to my account to retrieve it...

thank you very much  =)
I hope everybody has a great weekend, at which ever party
they're attending...

Pardon me, but NO ONE should be  allowed to look at what  I  choose to put on
MY hard drive.  Period.  Allowing "THEM" access to what I consider extremely
personal material is simply wrong.  Think about it.  How do I know that once
they have access, they are not looking at my love letters or private notes or
fucking nude pictures I have taken with my digital camera of my
girlfriendPhoto developing is so un secure)?  How do I KNOW they are just
looking for cracked programs (by the way, I have no illegal materials)?  And
besides, once they get the foot in the door, the will use that as a stepping
stone to censorship or to weed out "subversives".  Watch your back, friend
(please, I really mean friend :))

-JDub


PS:  I am not a hacker, so I am not able to meet that challenge.  Niether is
most of the public.

pps:  Hope you don't hate me...Though the tone of this post is harsh, please
realise I have good intentions.  I am just completely fed up with the
direction American society/gvnmnt is going these days, i.e.: unconstitutional
 search and siezure laws upheld by the supreme court,  deregulation of banks,
effective removal/circumvention of anti trust/monopoly laws for corporations,
child labor/ endentured servitude laws avoided by moving to "free trade
zones" in foreign countries, avoiding environmental laws the same way, etc.,
etc.,...AND most everyone seems to ignore these realities or just not care...
 And I believe that people are pacified using media to make sure they don't
care...  Just my .02

Hey friends, what's up?  
I'm new to this mailing list, but not this scene. I just thought it would be
really cool to meet some of you who I read about on this list.  

If any of you guys check this in time for tonight's party, look for me....

I'm 5'3", short chin-length brown hair.  I'll be wearing black Ben Davis
pants, with a black and white checkered shirt, with flowers on each of the
black/white squares.  I'll probably be up in front most of the night, since
that's where I always get most of my energy from.  I'll be with a group of
friends, and we would love to open up our circle and welcome anyone!! :-)

Hope you all have a great and wonderful time tonight, and please only bring
good vibes, positive attitudes, and of course your gorgeous smiles!!!!

Peace, :-), and happiness!

Karen

Well, like I said years ago after our "victory" against Iraq, after all
the patriotic DemoKKKracy-affirming parades and TV coverage of the
Jihad-Superbowl...  "We're not going to be out partying much once the
vanquished start blowing up airplanes and public gathering sites in the
US." Reply -- "Oh, there'll never be a terrorism problem in the US --
we're so far away from all those hotspots we've created!"

Remember -- "They" still need to claim about 499,700 more lives before
they get even, and "they" probably will. 

War begets war begets war begets war. When will we learn?

Perhaps these are just fin-du-siecle fireworks -- people are getting
edgy cuz we're trying to close the books on one of the most brutal,
unjust centuries in history, desperately trying to come up with a
bottom line that shows we've made progress in the civility and
prosperity categories.  We've been lead down the garden path, believing
we can cheat a zero-sum game. Our doghma does not have dharma nature.

Well, with all these people getting all pumped up and inspired for
Friends and Family tonight, I thought I'd add my voice for
enthusiasm and inspiration toward those of us going to Unity.
It ought to be a tremendous night... with everyone donating their
time and energy for a shared ideal and the healing of a friend.

Wherever you end up going tonight remember that the 'real' vibe is
the one you are carrying within you, and you can fucking groove with
it wherever you are.  I'm planning on nothing short of personal meltdown,
cause I think I've been too pent up and stressed lately.  I hope there
are others who are willing to join me.

So... I hope everyone has a wicked night wherever you end up.

	our apartments in the william oliver building are exactly
	one one of the five points.

	we could not leave our apartments today because they found
	another device, this one a c4 explosive, at the underground
	atlanta mall.  (underground atlanta is a lot like a version
	of fisherman's wharf except it is underground and it sucks
	more).  anyway they detonated it in some sort of bomb tank
	thing, i heard the boom from the bathtub.

	i was searched leaving our building, as well as entering 41
	marietta.  for perspective:

	41 marietta is two blocks from centennial park, which is 
	also on marietta.  these are our offices, we were in the
	basement working last night when the initial attack occured.

	the william oliver is at five points.  five points is the
	historic intersection of peachtree and marietta (there 
	must be some sort of georgian law that all streets must be
	called peachtree).  this intersection is one block from
	nike hq at 41 marietta.  one block further from centennial
	park. 

	underground atlanta is one-half blocks from the william 
	oliver building, on peachtree.	

	but, as they said, the games are going on.

I know I am going to get a bunch of replies, but the first one to my inbox 
will be the lucky one who will get two bright and shiny laminates. (we 
tried and tried to talk our friends into going, they don't know what 
they're missing:)

Please include your phone #, so I can get in touch with you to set up a 
meeting point.  Preferably someone willing to donate $10.00+ per tick to 
hyperreal.  It is a good cause.  Without it, no fnf party would have ever 
happened, right?

Cheers***

While i agree with the sentiment, the implication that the Atlanta bomb
was planted by non-US terrorists looks to be incorrect:  the bomb was
apparently very amateurish, and very similar to those trialled earlier
by local militia groups.

How's this for a proposition:

The rise of the militia is an example of old Cold War pigeons coming
home to roost: if you label half the world "commie", some people will
start to believe that half the world is against them. If you encourage
people to become insular, then their country or state becomes their
world. In the inevitable logic of paranoia, half their country seems to
be against them. And sometimes they fight back.

Good day,

Just when you thought the sense of community couldn't get much better...

I was on the phone to my friend Ron discussing his lack of an F&F ticket, about to go out
onto the list and beg for one, when HE got a call from Paul.  He had given him his # , last
weekend after the BBQ, in hopes that he might come across a ticket.  This is the same
random kindness that has drawn me to all of YOU, and had impressed Ron the afternoon
of the BBQ.  We can make a difference.  I did not feel this way about people or their actions
before I met YOU.  Thank you.

Take care,
                      Jason

P.S. Must go get ready now, see YOU all soon!

	not that i have any loyalty to nike, because i don't,
	but for all of us working here in atlanta they provided
	huge duffel bags with $2.5k (retail) in their product.
	one of the things was a pair of the brand new air-max
	running shoe.  holy shit!  like walking on pillows.
	and they look tweaky/techno, too.  people have been 
	stopping me around town and on the marta, asking where
	they come from.

	not that i would every *pay* $140 for shoes that do not
	come with motorcycle armor, wheels, or fit in ski bindings.

	actually, terrorists blow up airplanes and buildings.
	they pretty much experts at bomb making and don't
	make shitty pipe bombs with nails in them.  this thing
	diddn't even knock down that tech tower and it was 
	right there against it.  it went off in an incredibly
	crowded place yet only two people died.  definately
	c+ terrorist work. (ok, *maybe* b-)

	rumor is it might be a disgruntled vendor, which seems
	pretty likely to me.  it's really fun and exciting to 
	think it's the cia or the dole campaign, but whatever.

	i been wrong about things all weekend, but my theory
	is that this is an isolated asshole as opposed to a
	sweeping plan of terror.

	ok, off to see some handball matches.

	because hyperreal rocks:)

	cookies are not inherently bad.  some implimentations
	of cookies are really really lame, but not hyperreal's.

	they basically make your browsing experience better
	and more efficient, they way they are designed.  if 
	someone sends you cookies that only return to themselves
	and expire immediately (that day) no worries, imo.

JavaScript has a lot of security holes, as well as being non-standard.
Best to disable it until that is proven otherwise..

I would also stay away from MS programs for the same reasons.
(MSIE).. Netscape has ulterior motives, but they aren't half as
sleazy as Microsloth.

  I agree that disabling JavaScript is wise.
  Certain pages maintain copies of java applets that crash computers and such
through various security holes.
  I don't know about this.  I use Internet Explorer sometimes.  It doesn't
support frames on the current Mac version, but it is definately faster for
many things than Netscape, and I personally hate 90% of all frames.
  Isn't Netscape implementing some new security prevent people from using
unregistered copies with the official release of 3.0?

Hi all!!

 uhhhh FUCKIN' WOW!!! Holy shit was that a good party!!!

Of course I'm refering to FnF. The range of experiences and people I met 
simply can not be compared to any moment of my life. Rather than 
expose in detail my memories I would like to relate a personal experience 
that, I feel, sums up for me what that party was all about:

 At about 4am or so I noticed a slender man about 5' 8" (or so) dancing. 
He had a dark tint to his skin and he sported a pair of short red horns 
from his brow. I thought to myself, "cool, there goes satan dancing with 
the ravers. It's a really happy time here dancing with satan, the only 
thing to make it better would to be to have god dancing with us 
(including satan of course)." 
 About 2 hours later I was pulled out of my comfy position in a bean bag 
chair to look at the 2nd of two rainbows that appeared in the sky, 
visable from the parking lot behind our party (where a lot of people 
were hanging out dancing to the sound spill from indoors). And I thought 
to myself, "well, now god is dancing with us."


FnF ROCKS!!!!

...one of the best damn parties I've attended thus far. Right up there with
freedom.

hi to everyone I met/saw (welcome to the list, Karen), glad the t-shirts
were a success (there a few of you who were supposed to get shirts from me
but didn't; ed colmar, todd manley, lee fogel, mike w., + others; I looked
out for you and tried to make myself obvious, but I guess we just weren't
in the right places at the right times. I've still got your shirts. e-mail
me privately and we can arrange something...)

Ethan and crew deserve much thanks for the amount of effort that went
towards making this event so good... the decorations, the music, the free
water, the free blow-pops, those smoothies, the space... yada, yada, yada.

I could go on and on, but I'm feeling a little spun right now. <=o)

(...spun but really happy.)

see you all next weekend at ???.

lest I heard, the police received a tip-off about the bomb from an
anonymous source 20 minutes before it went off, so the park was
half-evacuated when it exploded.

seems a little fishy to me...

sounds like we're dealing with disgruntled montana nuts here, not *real*
terrorists.

I did not help with the party this time so I was just a raver
...I like it that way. I dont think I've seen a nicer chillout zone...I 
listened in on some of the kids e-piles and was thoroughly entertained. 
Even got to hear Claire giving advice (rave mom).

John Carel was my favorite last night but it was a close call since 
most of the DJs played FnF style techno/hard trance. (good)

Everything was super!

(niEl, those were real... kind of.)

It's a lot older than that!  SF Project 1 and 2 came out in 1993 I 
think... whatever year Spirit of the Tree (FTT) and Tape #2 came out...

Hi!

Let me preface this by telling you that I appreciate all the info you've sent
to the list on the subject of these bombs.  I heard on the news that they had
found another suspicious object that turned out to be just a metal bar or
something.  Didn't you say they found a C-4 bomb in an underground shopping
mall [that word, 'underground' just doesnt look right next to 'shopping mall'
;)]?  They made no mention of this at all on television.  I even listened to
the radio (KCBS) for an hour, which gave no indication either.  What are they
doing?  Why the secrecy?  Are you sure the sherrif you spoke to had correct
info?  I believe you, so don't think it's anything like that... It's them I
don't trust!

Hello! 
Not to personally attack you, but Nike has just been the subject of a probe
that showes them terribly abusing "free trade zones" in many parts of the
world by exploiting child labor.  I thought that shit was supposed have been
abolished 100 years ago!  Can you quit gracefully and work for a hippy
company instead?   I understand if you can't, I just wanted to be sure you
were aware of this fact.  I realize that Nike _must_ have alot to offer you,
but if you stop and think of _why_ they can offer it, you may feel
differently about how you view them, being a  person just like those kids
they exploit.   Unfortunately, I don't have the references to back up this
alegation, but I got the info from someone I trust.  My mom.  I'll search the
net and see what I can come up with.

Hope you can see the "why's" in life,

-JDub

-PS Nike does make superior footware, that is not in debate.  It's just that
they charge too much(as you have mentioned) and pay wages too small.

-PPS nobody's perfect, so we should all try to be nobodys

OK.

Ya touched a nerve here.  I work for a large company similar to Organic 
Online, and we also have clients that leave me disgusted, due to karmic 
implications of giving my energies to helping these corporations succeed 
in this new medium.  And I agree it is always important to ask "why".

This is a catch-22, the bete-noire of many of my friends and colleagues.
In order for this new medium to succeed, to build an environment that is 
rich fertilizer for memetic engineering (ie, populated by more than geeks 
like us), you have to do the Faustian Bargain thing.  Unless you are 
REALLY lucky and have a fat inheritance.  Yeah right.

How to get the portfolio and captial to begin a start-up web shop with 
the "hippy" consciousness you speak of?  Go to where the money is.  Learn 
from the mistakes of Ben and Jerry's.  Follow the lead of Real Goods.  
But idealism ain't nothin' but hot air without viability.  Show me a 
REAL "hippy shop" where I can be in a position to work with the Nikes, 
McDonalds, Philip Morrises of the world (and thus affect memetic change 
where it's really needed from the inside), and I'll send my resume.

This is one reason I can empathize with Bill Clinton.  I started out in 
92 working for Sen. Harkin, a "real liberal", but realized you have to "go 
moderate" to get into a position to affect change.  So the trick then 
becomes to keep your soul and to keep your priorities even as you get 
sucked into the Spectacle of the Beast called Compromise.

I don't have the answers, hell I'm still lookin' for the right questions, 
but I will defend brother Rocky because I sense he faces the same 
situation I do.   Poor and without portfolio won't get you far in this biz.

my $.02

Dude, if fnf was really good techno/hard trance, than _Lust for Life_ was
fuckin the god of trance's own muthafuckin' party... Myster-E and Mars
really ripped up the truntables, driving most people into _trance frenzy_,
and after going on alone, the infamous Mars VS. Myster-E was next...
fuckin' awesome... Although I think that everyone at fnf had a very good
time, almost nothing went wrong at _Lust for Life_, it was really one of
the best vibes and best music I've heard in a long time... Vive le
cybertrance!

I NEED ASSISTANCE!!

Last night at FnF I was pseudo-dancing with this girl and I feel I might 
have blown it because I didn't ask her name or introduce myself (very 
un-FnF)!  :P

For the record:
I was wearing blue jeans and almost an all white Solle XL T-Shirt...I 
have longish blond/Brown hair and a goatee (sp?).  I know - pretty damn 
average.

Her:
Brown Hair (I'm guessing somewhere between 5'6" and 5'8" ->but I really 
suck at guessing height).  Tight short sleeved dark blue top with what 
looked like foil designs on the front.  Phat blue jeans.  And one of 
those twisty metal things on her right arm.  I think glittery eyes as well.

We were dancing between the fan and the rear cabinets - to the left as 
you looked at Ethan's fre$h maneuvers (btw - nice set ETHAN!!!).

I'm hoping someone on the list knows her - or - she's here herself.

hoping for a little miracle..

Points well taken.  Be aware that I am of late a bit scattered  as well as
frantic because I am noticing that people are turning away from the truth
_too_much_ these days.  Try these websites as examples of how the political
climate is becoming more hostile to the people and their rights ,more
friendly toward giant corp's, and how evil those corps are:

http://www.usatoday.com/news/court/nscot000.htmsupreme
http://http.tamu.edu:8000/~rst8074/nikenews.htmlnike
http://www.usatoday.com/news/washdc/ncs2.htmterror

  Indeed, I am short on solutions, but IMHO an  "if you can't beat 'em, join
'em"  attitude feeds the fire, creates statistics that can be quoted (see, no
one feels badly about Nike, everyone still does buisness with them...), and
helps the Nikes of the world succeede--at We The People's expense.  And in
regards to viability, we are _all_ living in an un-viable society.  And that
ain't no idealism.  I believe the corps see that too much info is getting out
there, so thier system of exploitation is in jepardy.  It's just a question
of who will get more desperate first, us or them?

In a message dated 96-07-28 18:30:37 EDT, you write:

<< 
 > Not to personally attack you, but Nike has just been the subject of a
probe
 > that showes them terribly abusing "free trade zones" in many parts of the
 > world by exploiting child labor. 
 
 OK.
 
 Ya touched a nerve here.  I work for a large company similar to Organic 
 Online, and we also have clients that leave me disgusted, due to karmic 
 implications of giving my energies to helping these corporations succeed 
 in this new medium.  And I agree it is always important to ask "why".
 
 This is a catch-22, the bete-noire of many of my friends and colleagues.
 In order for this new medium to succeed, to build an environment that is 
 rich fertilizer for memetic engineering (ie, populated by more than geeks 
 like us), you have to do the Faustian Bargain thing.  Unless you are 
 REALLY lucky and have a fat inheritance.  Yeah right.
 
 How to get the portfolio and captial to begin a start-up web shop with 
 the "hippy" consciousness you speak of?  Go to where the money is.  Learn 
 from the mistakes of Ben and Jerry's.  Follow the lead of Real Goods.  
 But idealism ain't nothin' but hot air without viability.  Show me a 
 REAL "hippy shop" where I can be in a position to work with the Nikes, 
 McDonalds, Philip Morrises of the world (and thus affect memetic change 
 where it's really needed from the inside), and I'll send my resume.
 
 This is one reason I can empathize with Bill Clinton.  I started out in 
 92 working for Sen. Harkin, a "real liberal", but realized you have to "go 
 moderate" to get into a position to affect change.  So the trick then 
 becomes to keep your soul and to keep your priorities even as you get 
 sucked into the Spectacle of the Beast called Compromise.
 
 I don't have the answers, hell I'm still lookin' for the right questions, 
 but I will defend brother Rocky because I sense he faces the same 
 situation I do.   Poor and without portfolio won't get you far in this biz.

I wanted and needed an F & F. 
Thank you all from the rainbow in the morning to Crayola carrie to  FBI  
John  and of course   my two new  fav friends  Wendi and corrie. And  the 
tree too!  So special all of you . Thanks  you all  F&F  is the best.  As 
Vince said   I  had the biggest smile on  my face he had seen all week. I 
did and do  thinking about F & F.  I am so  much better  now.  
I 'll be in the desert  for the next  few days , and  so sorry  about the 
Burning Train being  cancelled .  BurningMan will be so much fun though,  
just a little tougher to get to this year.  Next  year I promise!  YOu 
can find  me  either in Spiral Camp, Vince & Wayne's  or  maybe there 
will be  a  huge  cardboard and styrofoam  Burning Train out there 
someplace.  We  will put it on the UnionPacific line   just before we 
leave    just to freak them out as a thank you for denying our  request 
for UP tracks this  year.

Though many may speak highly of F&F, there was still another great party.
Granted this was lust for life's first rave, but I think it went
tremendously well.
    Great Vibe
        Incredible Energy from crowd
    Wicked spinning by all dj's 
        Acme location which always has a cool groove to it
    Lot's of water from a faucet
        Excellent chillout room with air beds to lie on
    Good temperature control 
    
I can't say enough about the energy and the crowd. I think everyone that
couldn't go to F&F focused all thier energies toward Lust for Life.  Thank
you, Thank you for such a wonderful evening.  Hope to see everyone at
Chrysalis Next weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hello all,

still bummed I couldn't get to fnf, especially when all the positve reviews
come flowin' through my mail box

Unity was at Homebase.  It was the biggest party I've ever seen there (I
never made it to the last Gathering there so i can't compare) It was set up
with 3 systems -the dj in the middle of the floor of the main room, the
ambiant/jungle rm and an outdoors funk system thet didn't really get goin
till about 4.

My night started off bad and gradually built into a good time.  I first got
there and I found out there was a fight - more like a jumping 12 on 1 over
drugs and/or money.  I new the guy too: I never say what happened but heard
he went to the hospital in very bad shape.  Another friend of a friend OD
on what he thought was E and went to the hospital. And my friends Ann and
Keri were complaining that the guys would not stop jockin' them all night:
I got a very anti socal feeling from most girls there last night because of
this.

Positives:  DAN rocked the house.  MUSIC QUESTION: Anyone know where I can
pick up the funky track( or any tapes/cds/rekids/ i could find it on) with
the Redman sample on it: " I'm a Funk phenominon, a funk phenominon"  Phat
track!

Tony was next and then at 3.30 they did a cerimon for Malachy: Thanking him
for his support and explaining to the crowd about the cause.  They
performed a Kundalini healing dance where the crowd claped the rhythm.
This young and restles crowd was not into the cerimony much.  From were I
was people were yelling " turn the music back on." and "No more" Very
disapponted in the crowd at that point. It's all for a good cause so why
not show your support for a little exercise in self healing.

Galen got me back into the music and THEN came Dubtribe.  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ohhh man they were sick! I loved every sweaty, hot, bumpin' and funking
groovin' minute of it.  If you haven't seen Dubtribe you are missing out.
BP Natural August 1 DUBTRIBE, GALEN, JEN=D8 at Mision Rock Resort 817 China
Basin SF 415. 541.5678.  I am there. U?

My night had lifted and everything was all good.  Garth closed it out.  I
love him in the morning.  He played Michael Jackson  "dancin'.....
Yeah it was a good night but I am done with these big parties.

See you all at Full Moon maybe or chrystalis.

Dear All;

        Though I feel very sorry for everyone that went as well as Mr.
Martin; I'm not surprised.

        Friends & Family, as well as Lust for Life were both great. See you
at Sunset & Mantra; tonight.

Peace
Brian

ps Intimacy over hype is my rule of thumb. The more hype, the less intimacy.
Friends & family was the first, and only large party that I could actually
walk around and not have to wear my urban defense stuff(details classfied),
and feel totally comfortable doing so.

Hey everybody,

FnF was great, as usual.  The vibe was totally there.  I got to see people
there I hadn't seen in ages, and the new folks I met were so cool.

I love this party because it's totally open to anybody who wants to
participate.  Lots of us got there Saturday afternoon to help set up.  

I came with some stuff to build an altar, and that was hella fun.  As
always, the altar grew during the night. 

Michelle brought more stuff later on and set up the altar that was on the
floor against one wall in the ambient space.  She wrote "New Moon" in
chalk on the concrete, which I thought was really neat.

Minx, Cindy, Anna and friends also put up an altar next to the main room.
It was beautiful.  I liked how walking past it on my way to the main dance
area gave me a moment to chill and get into the right head space for
dancing.  Thank you!!

Thank you to everyone for a fabulous night.

Love,

Ann

After experiencing Friends & Family, I'll probably be glowing for dayz!

All of you just made the party R-O-C-K!! It was wonderful to see all 
those familiar smiling faces, and finally get to chat with everyone 
that I've been meaning to meet. (Tom, Amy, Johnathan, mHg, liquid, 
Brandon, and the rest)

If there is a such thing as a perfect party, This was it! Beautiful 
space, excellent music, *insane* chill room, Vibe jus' oozin' out of 
everybody in all directions, and for those of looked up as you were 
leaving...we were greeted by a beautiful rainbow that shone above the 
party in the morning! =)

Yes I'm guilty, I rave-hopped to UNITY at about 5:00am. (I wasn't the 
only one) Got in for free, just wanted to check it out. The set-up was 
sick! Got to hear the close of Dubtribe's set. Ran into a couple 
friends only to receive reports of two fights, bunk EntErtainmEnt, and 
a couple overdoses. Austin - You shoulda came back with me!!! Well, I 
didn't see very many smiling faces, so I aboutfaced after 20 minutes of 
that party and ran back to F&F.

Props to everybody who put so much time and effort into this party. 
Your *labor of love* was felt by everyone last night!

Hmmm.......Chrysalis anyone?????

Hugs, 

CT

	ok, they found a heavy object in a bag, and somehow 
	detected a mercury switch.  the picked it up with a
	robot and moved it to a detonation chamber and used
	some sort of explosive to blow it, prolly c4.

	the object was an iron, you know, for clothes.

	i was locked in my building for a number of hours.
	how annoying!  thanx for your concern though :)

	you might not like this, but it is perfectly normal in some
	parts of the world for children to work.  i dunno if nike
	has any child labor or not, i cannot remember what the press
	release said.  they did say that they pay more than the usual
	wage for their communities, and it is hard to enforce their
	labor requirements because they are dealing with contractors.
	i'll try to forward the release.  it comes down to who you 
	believe.  one thing i can say is that the people here
	where i am now are kind people and good people.  i dunno 
	if a single one of them has anything to do with contracting
	work overseas though.

	in the end, it's not up to us to tell another society what

	buy their products, of course.

days when I think life sucks...which won't be for a long time now!  Kudos
to Ethan and friends for pulling off another great party - this was my
second and I'm fully hooked!  Special thanks to SDream for giving me a
ticket and making it possible for me to go.  Nice meeting some
frequentposters to sfraves in person (Nancy, Crunchman).  Thank you all for
your spirit, your smiles, your open hearts and open minds.  The gods shone

This isn't really a matter of "us" vs. "them." I hope *EVERYBODY* had a

        I have a bunch of old computer parts which are taking up needed
space & I would like to donate any needed computer parts like cpu's, memory
chips, sound cards, fax/modem, vga video cards, power supplies, cables,
cases, floppy drives, software, harddrives, controller cards ...etc. So let
me know what you guys want, I have a lot of stuff. Note, these are donations
to hyperreal.com, and not available to the GP.

Peace
Brian

ps You must pick up

First and foremost, what an amazing party. The music & vibe was so 
wondrously intense I danced from about 10:30 PM until 5:00 AM non stop, 
***unenhanced*** 
and often just drippin' with sweat.   Many thanks to the f&f crew and to 
everyone who speaks the language of the smile...  I look forward to 
dancing with you out on the Playa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
~peace and always luv --Maureen

Lost Item:

Sorry to hear you lost your SFRaves T, hopefully it will show up.

Unfortunately a friend of mine's long black soft wool & lined coat which 
was on a black, 'flo-green hands' bean bag was missing in the AM around 
5:30. The bean bag, was located in the side area next to the visuals in the 
main room. If anyone found it lying around during cleanup, please let me 
know. Thanks... --Maureen

I know this has worked for others, so I'm putting the word out in hopes it
will help me.

Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday of next week I'll be takin' a hella huge and
hard exam.  Hopin' people can put out a spare positive vibe for me, cauz I
can use all the help I can get  :)

Then I will have my life back and I can start going out again!!  It has
been TOO long.  Hoping maybe to finally meet some of y'all after reading
all your crazy 100+ posts per day for the past three months.  Believe you
me, reading my mail from the list was a break I looked forward to every
day.

Again, thanks....

P.S. - glad everyone had such a good time at FnF.  One week too early for me :(

When's the next one?!

HELLo!
     
     
Anyone heard of a program run by Microsoft at their web site that allows them 
to search your hard drive when you access them, looking for 
unregistered/cracked programs?  'Twas a rumor I heard from a friend of mine 
and I just wanted to cross reference it with all you 
smarter-than-I-about-computers folks.  Is it possible for anyone look at what 
is on your drive when you access a site?

Hey friends,

I can't even begin to express what a weekend this was.  This has been the
first weeked since I've been back to the Bay Area (June) that I've really
partied, and I couldn't have picked a better one.

Friends and Family was absolutely the best big party that I've been to.  And
this was my first F&F, too!!  I love you guys, you were ALL smiles and there
was nothing but that family feeling there!  I couldn't believe how much the
crowd was so together.  It's been too long since I've felt such energy and
love!!!

I'm really glad that I got to meet some of you SFRAVERs out there (Mike,
etc...you know who you are!!)  I was surprised that you came up to me and
recognized me in the crowd!  That was such a cool feeling!!

And I also couldn't believe that I made it throughout the night completely
SOBER!!  It's amazing how I was able to feel the energy bounce off from
person to person all around me.  I danced my ass off, so much since I was so
naturally high.  There's nothing like it.  I just realized that we don't need
drugs to have a great time (even though it's always fun to reach that next
higher level...)

And how many of you witnessed the beautiful sunrise?  I swear, this weekend
was made for all of us.  It was great when we were driving home to have the
sun rise on the left, while a HUGE perfectly horseshoe-shaped rainbow colored
the sky to the west.

And after hours of rest and recooperation, we went to the Sunset Party to
hear some groovin' house music while watching the sun go down.  The music was
great and really good vibes were present.  The sunset was spetacular, along
with the rising moon.

All in all, I was just completely overwhelmed about how this weekend turned
out.  I've been waiting to go dancing for a while, and this was well worth
it.

Thanks,  you guys for making this weekend really special for me.  This is
what makes San Francisco the heart of it all, for me.  I'm going to miss this
so much when I move back down to LA....   :-( 

Until next time........

Karen :-)

     Anyhoo...
     
     FnF was beyond grand.  I wish I could thank everybody by name, but I 
     was beyond names and just loving the sweat, smiles, and music of a 
     party from beyond.  I'm glad everybody had a good time, and I'm glad 
     the other parties went off too.  Now if I could only find the woman 
     who gave me that back rub and kept bringing me water (you are beyond 
     angelic).
     
     Everybody was great... I have to thank John K for giving me his ticket 
     (what better way to set off the vibe), Jay (and the other guy I shared 
     my blended fruit drink with) for being such a blast to party with, the 
     FNF DJ's (scrumptious!), and all the SFRavers I saw (so glad I went to 
     the BBQ!  You have eyes and noses and everything)...

started the evening at 111 minna cause i needed to get my house music fix.
got to fnf at around 3.  the space was great, smiling happy sfravers
everywhere!  perfect setup, lotsa free water, fresh fruit in the AM.. the
best of all, groovy music to dance to... i was expecting a tranceathon
(send flames to /dev/null).  the closing set was particularly
inspiring.  props to the dj's for keeping my butt movin and props to the
fnf crew for a heckuva rave.

reggae on the river is this weekend (aug 2-4).  it is sold out as usual.

back in the days (91/92?) it was common to have a reggae/dub room.  plus
garth and jeno used to throw in dub influenced stuff all the time.

  Also, by buying Nike shoes you are supporting the practice of spending
megamillions on advertising and passing the cost along the consumer.  It's
always best to avoid companies that advertise too much, isn't it?

WOW! Awesome! Beautiful! Amazing! Stupendous!

This was my first FnF and only my second rave out here in San Francisco and it was great. 
I was still moving in my car while I drove home.  Thanks to everyone for making it so
wonderful.  Thanks to Andy for the fruit drink and other stuff, and to Rob just for
being there.  And special thanks to Eric P. for the beautiful gift you gave me.

Jeff sorry you had to leave so early you missed a beautiful ending to a great party.

Jay
PS in case your wondering, I was the one with the tan pants and the Dallas Cowboys
t-shirt who was dancing with glow-sticks most of the night.

This party cooked!  I went by myself and made friends with some 
cool people.  No one was too busy with their friends to socialize a 
little and dance around. Who made those immense backrub knobs?? 
Whose idea was it to open the roll-up doors.  The rainbow was 
really uplifting.  Also it was necessary to stand in line to hug 
Ethan on multiple occasions.  Appreciate the great loyal crew that 
makes this group so special.  Notice how so many chose to wear 
their laminate symbols.  GREAT! See everyone next time.  XO Rhoda

SUBJECT: Dancin' shoes

 I recently bought some Airwalks (the tongue of the shoe says "19oz"
 but I don't know if that's the model) that are super comfortable.
 The worked very well for Syntonic, BP, and F&F!  Arch support isn't
 too bad, and they are incredibly light.   Best of all - they were
 CHEAP!  Thanks to Mark Camp for the Ross recommendation (they were out
 of Converse one stars that I came in to buy).

 Nike.  I don't think Nike actually manufactures their own shoes they
 design and distribute them.  It would be the maunfacturing companies
 in Asia (primarily) that would be guilty of this alleged child labor
 abuse.  And, true, they are often expensive (retail), but they are
 good quality shoes.  I hit the outlet stores and clearance sales if in
 need of these shoes.

Hello everyone,


Pretty quite Monday, eh?   I guess FnF took alot out of the list... 
Hope that everybody had such a great time such as myself this weekend...

Anyhoot, I'll be residing in the south bay all week, housesitting for my
brother who's off on a trip, and am wondering what is there to do in the
Mountian View to SJ area..   I'll be hitting some book stores I've been
meaning to get to, any other ideas? Im not too keen on clubs as it is, and I
hear the SJ scene is in housey-type state of evoution (give it a few more
years)...

Hope to see everyone @ Chrysalis this Saturday, it's been awhile...


"Dance with me..."

-Adam

FnF was brilliant. Many thanks to the Crunchman for organising
a ticket for me and thanks to everyone i met for making me
feel so welcome!

Is anyone interested in a re-post of a review of Mayday X
(Dortmund, Germany), which i was at earlier this year?

Whoever said I wasn't a morning person hasn't seen me dance to gabber at 
7 a.m.  I was an instant convert!!  Dave Bayer had an amazingly wonderful 
set early in the morning.  I know some people were a bit weary of 
hard-core in the chill room, but there were some of us who adored it!!  
It was better than an early morning jog!  I think I live by the Jess 
Fogel rule of all or nothing.  The longer I rave, the more I'm attracted 
to faster music.  Slow music doesn't get my adrenalin pumping.  Slow 
music is such a let-down for my body.  So, that gabber set was just the 
injection I needed.  The handful of us dancing knew what it was all 
about!!  That was the first time I've heard gabber, and I hope I hear it 
again!!  It reminded me of early ska and the original skin-heads dancing the 
pogo.  

The gabber set was actually the first time the whole night that I went 
off.  I spent the rest of the time chilling out and soaking in the party.  
I had hopes of arriving around 10:30, but due to some last minute glitter 
preparations of my newbie friends, we didn't arrive until around 11:30!

When we arrived one of my friends said, "Wow, is it always this great?"  
It is so gratifying when you are finally able to share this feeling with 
close friends who have never felt it before!

I came with a huge group of extended friends and for the first hour there 
was all of this psuedo-coordination to do, which left me a bit 
frazzeled.  But, finally everyone discovered the exact place they wanted 
to be, and everything was fine.  I chatted with so many people and saw so 
many of your beautiful faces again.  Got a wonderful t-shirt from Michal, 
gave SDream a silly picture of the two of us, met Ran and Phelps (very 
charming people).  Got a back-breaking hug from Mattloaf (wow!:).  Hung 
out with Matt L., A-Ron, Roger (hope you got some pictures), erase, 
Branka, Eric, Erik, Reno.  Talked to Amy, Shawna, Black Adder, Reagan, Paul, 
Leslie, and the rest who I haven't forgotten.  Crowned Jon-Burger King with 
a special present.  Challenged Tony Rose while dancing to gabber to 
see who could hold out the longest!!  I think we tied!!  Helped Nancy find 
her infamous blue feather boa.  That was a BIG hit!!  Finally took 
pictures of everything.  I hope 
they come out well.  My flash seemed to be working great!  I was dressed 
entirely in pink with pink satin pants and a pink tank-top.  A friend of 
mine came up to me during the night in the dark and gave me a sticker 
that said "pink."  In the morning she realized just how appropriate that 
was!!

>From maybe 1:30-4 I disappeared into the world of anonymity and watched 
the party through the eyes of my newbie friends, gleefully remembering how 
I felt at my first rave.  The curiosity, the attraction, the beautiful 
chillroom (L-shaped and magnificently decorated), the strange music that 
seeps into your bones.  It was a special moment with special people.  I 
think I spoiled them, though, by bringing them to FnF!! :)  

I didn't actually dance very much until around 5 a.m. and then the gabber 
set came on and I was in heaven.

The morning was beautiful and warm, as was the entire night.  The rainbow 
was too perfect!!  The organic breakfast was a great end to a great 
night.  The group hug with people piling on was so special.  Seeing 
Kristi get in her full of dancing and wanting more as everyone was 
leaving!!  I don't know how she does that!!  She puts me to shame!!

Thank you to everyone involved, it was simply amazing.  Every FnF that I 
have been to has been special and unique.  I was trying not to compare 
this one to the others, worried that I'd be let down.  But, that just 
wasn't the case.  It was truly unique.

I started things off early at F&F.  This was probably the best
organized noncommercial event I've ever been to.  Great space, plenty
of room, beautiful decorations, all comforts taken care of.  I really
appreciated those big $1 cups of juice, candy, soft places to sit,
excellent visuals, street parking security and the big outdoor area.

The vibe was great, of course.  The main sound system was excellent
and everyone was going nuts there.  Not being a huge fan of trance, I
stayed mostly in the "ambient".  There was a lot of sound bleed
through from next door, but after a while I decided that I liked hearing 
some of that energy in the mix.  The ambient DJs were spinning 
pretty danceable stuff and I enjoyed adrenalin's and Tom's sets 
as the party got underway.  Monty came on and even spun us
some house, which got a happy little group of us on our feet.  I'm
looking forward to Monty's upcoming stint on the Sunset boat party.

Michael Mantra followed with stuff that was too mellow for dancing and
the main room was still pounding hard, so after 5 hours of fun it was
time to head up the street to Unity.  Tony was in full gear on a massive
4 corner system, and what he was spinning was not much softer than F&F, j
a little slower perhaps and as usual I fell under his spell.  The lazers
were great, and the space was put to good use, plenty of free water,
portopotties, etc.  There were even some colorful vending booths in the
"ambient" room and lot's of people hanging out outdoors.  I
thought the vibe was pretty good, different than F&F, with a higher
percentage of people just standing around on the dance floor (a sin
in my book).  Even though I only recognized about 2% of the poeple,
I felt welcome there.

Austin:
>Tony was next and then at 3.30 they did a cerimon for Malachy: Thanking him

>performed a Kundalini healing dance where the crowd claped the rhythm.
>This young and restles crowd was not into the cerimony much.  From were I
>was people were yelling " turn the music back on." and "No more" Very
>disapponted in the crowd at that point. It's all for a good cause so why
>not show your support for a little exercise in self healing.

My take on this is a bit different.  At first, I felt that the crowd
very much into the speeches being made, and those who weren't were at
least were polite about it.  But after the 5th "just one more thing before
we turn the music back on" people started getting  restless.  Then
Ms. Celestine Prophecy (Susan of Progress) gets up and says "I want
to try something that works really well with the kindergarden class that
I teach..."  insisting to us how "very important" it is for us to join
this energy-channeling visualization exercise....  I found her to be
extremely condescending.  There's only so much follow-the-leader
cajoling a group of ravers can be expected to embrace, and in my mind
the promoters overdid it.  How well-recieved would it have been to have
stopped the music at the *peak* of F&F and so Brian could give a 1/2 hour 
lecture on how because the Internet might someday save the world each
of us should spend more time learning about computers?

After that the dance vibe was pretty dead so I wandered and discovered
that the ambient room had some killer Jungle going on.  Yeah!
Then outside the third sound system was going off with Darkhorse doing
his funky do.   I even enjoyed the circle dancers there who were
laughing and competing in a real positive playful kind of way.
Then back to the main room where Dubtribe was kicking major ass, totally
resurrecting the vibe.  But after Dubtribe, I felt it start to dissolve
again, so it was time to return to the warm glow of F&F.  

Dave Bayer was spinning in the "ambient" room something that
I think is called gabber, or happy hardcore (help me out Crunch).  Very
fast and kind of goofy, but a lot of fun, whee!  Maybe the real problem I
have with a lot of trance is that it's so damn serious.  Near the end he
Dave switched to some nice atmospheric stuff.  In the main room, Joe Rice
was delivering a nice morning set.  I always like Joe's DJ aura of calm
intelligence, like a laid back college professor.   Because DJ's can act
as shamans who channel different kinds of energy, it's good when you
can receive it not just from the music they spin, but from their very
own souls.  When Ethan spins, I often imagine that he's on fire with
smoke and flames shooting out of his nostrils.  Tony is like a scientist
delicately poking at his instraments (though when you talk to him he's
really more like a jolly brew-enhanced Rugby player). 

Anyway, I had a great time at both parties; each offered something 
positive but different.  F&F brings together people who are already on 
the same wavelength.  Always great to shmooze with friends.  Vibewise a 
sure bet even if a bit homogeneous.  Compared to Friends and Family, 
Unity could have been called "Strangers and Acquaintances".  Hard to 
achieve lot of cohesiveness, but whatever togetherness that does happen 
at this kind of party feels very good, like a special accomplishement in 
the face adversity.

So, kudos to everyone, everywhere (no point in leaving anyone out) for
yet another fine joyous, diverse adventure in raveland.

Well, count your blessings that you can still enjoy hard fast music with a
bunch of nice and friendly people. Having seen the gabber scene in Holland
explode to 50.000 people parties, attracting bunches of speed snorting
16-year olds, neo-nazis etc. it seems to me it is very difficult to throw
gabber parties and attract a crowd that is intelligent, relaxed and friendly.
And if one hears records from a few years ago it seems that the overall
tempo of rave music is increasing over the years, which in my opinion
is due to the larger availability of stimulants in the scene. It's pretty
tough to keep up with 180 bpm for eight hours unenhanced (although it's
been done) and the gabber scene as I know it has the biggest drug intake
of all (and the most deadly overdoses). And actually I'm surprised that
gabber is played here in SF, I've always seen the scene here more directed
to trance/psychedelic/acid kind of stuff. Maybe it's a matter of definition,
the gabber I know from Holland is usually pretty aggressive, fast, very dark
and loud, with samples like: "six million ways to die, choose one", "I take
you all to fucking hell", "motherfuck" etc. The happy hardcore spin off
was sort of introduced to counter this dark element (and probably attract
more women and less speed-freaks) but is hardly taken seriously. Gabbers
go for the ultimate extreme experience.

And my weekend, ended up around 3 am at lust for life and really enjoyed the
hard trance & acid that was played there. Met a large number of Scots, Irish
and English folks. Left around 8 o'clock in the morning, being...

	Wah, FnF was the Bomb, okay it has been said many times now... 
	But really the BOMB, you get it? 

	Vibe 9+, People 9, Space 9, Gear 9, Music... ah, music... Well, most 
	of the night was really good (Ethan's set rocked), BUT I nearly died 
	in the morning when Joe Rice (I guess) went down to some slower beats. 
	Still full of energy and without the music to spend it on, I went
	roaring around for faster beats during an hour, very frustrating!
	Thankfully a genius put some GABBER in the AMBIENT room (wow, this
	guy is courageous!) and saved the end of my night.

	Hey DJs, make us move our butts! Keep the mellow stuff in da clubs!
	That's what they're made for, aren't they?
	And blast our heads with real Techno during Raves! 
	You guys are _mellow_ ...

	Understand me: I went to 100% hardcore parties before, it's

	styles and music, but it looks like my favorite level of beats is a 
	little bit faster than the SF average. What? Do I have to move to LA?

	Apart from that, I've been impressed by the number of people; woah,
	sure I knew it was 600, but that makes quite a bunch! What a big
	family we have! 
	And thus the organisation required, which didn't make any mistake, 
	everything correctly planned and thought of, space well divided, etc.
	Overall, 9+ and thumbs up to FnF!!!

I swear by Doc Martens Air Weir shoes. I particularly like the
soft-sole greasy leather style. They come in a variety of heights -- I
have one pair of mid-top boots, and one pair of loafers. They are the
most comfortable shoes that I have worn that don't look like
sneakers. Dal Jeets and Villians (both on Upper Haight) have a wide
selection of Doc's in stock. You may want to get some arch support
inserts, if you need extra support.

For a more casual look, try Nike Air Horizon hiking boots. They have
very good arch support as well, and they are very lightweight.

Finally, if you are interested, I can refer you to a Massage Therapist
friend who specializes in footbone work. She is very good in restoring
fallen arches. 

Happy Feet,
E. Nygma

ok. mike migurski forgot the directions on how to use the iron-ons. so i'm
posting this publicly. (tee hee. take that mike!) ;)   bwaaahahahah! public
humiliation! actually, several people forgot, including, i think, my
rave-MOM, leslie. ;) again.

anyone who got an iron-on from me at FnF got the "limited edition
manufacturing defect" issue, where i was tired the night i made them and
printed them all up _backwards_! (doh!)  [what do you mean backwards? it's
on your back! it's supposed to be backwards! ;)  ]

anyway, i'll be printing up more (the correct way this time) and bringing
them out to raves with me. so, if you want one just find me some time.

ok. directions re-post.
     -----
-ironing surface: smooth, hard, non-porous surface that can withstand heat.-
-fold a pillowcase in half and put it on the surface.
-put the tshirt on top of the pillowcase.
*note: the tshirt should be rinkle-free and the surface shouldn't have chips
or grooves in it for best results (obviously)
-crank the iron up as hot as it can go and let it sit for a few minutes to
heat up to maximim temperature.
-flip an edge of the transfer up (so you can get a handhold to peel it up
after you apply it.
-make 2 10 second passes with the iron over the transfer
-make 10 or so circle motions with the iron
-don't burn your shirt
-peel the transfer off while it is still hot. if it doesn't come off, heat
it up again and peel it off. don't force it!
-wash in cold water
-remove immediately after wash is done (i don't know why, it just says this
in the directions.
-dry in dryer, etc.

*note: there is a very small possiblity that the ink from my printer does
not set properly (although my initial tests have shown it does). if you are
of the extra-cautious type, first wash the shirt, by itself, in cold water
with no detergent and a cupfull of vinigar thrown in. however, the ink does
seem to work properly. i'll know more by FnF, doubtless.

It was, of course, an incredible rave!!  I spent most of the night 
sitting and chatting with friends because this time I didn't have the 
energy or coordination to dance hard, as sometimes happens. But I still 
wouldn't change a thing... 

The night went perfectly:  It was actually almost *warm* outside - a 
pleasant surprise for the Bay Area.  We were even blessed with a few 
sprinkles (I thought I was getting spittled on by the person I was 
talking to til I realized it was raindrops!;)

The highlight came in the morning.  This is what happned for those of you 
who couldn't make it or who left early.  I was sitting outside and they 
opened up the big door from the main dance floor.  Most everyone who was 
dancing inside came outside and it must have been timed perfectly, 
because Mother Nature smiled down us with a perfect bright rainbow.  It 
seriously felt like a message from Mother, and we all cheered at Her gift.

Then Joe put on "Belfast" and I looked through the door into the main 
room and noticed everyone forming the circle.  I rushed in and joined in, 
my closest friends by my side as the circle grew and grew.  Then we all 
rushed into the center and clapped and cheered and danced like crazy.  It 
was so beautiful - everyone was hugging everyone, laughing and grinning 
like mad.  One man was so moved he was crying with a huge grin on his 
face.  I immediately gave him a big hug. We were all so in tune with each 
other, on the same plane.  I am still amazed at the power of the human 
spirit. 

Then at toward the end of the song, everyone closed in on the biggest 
group hug I have ever experienced.  I swear every person was there, 
giving his and her energy - it was so powerful.  Nothing embodied the 
words "Friends and Family" more.  The song ended and we were so stunned 
and elated....cheers and cries of joy erupted and filled the room. 

My thanks to each and every person who gave to this party.  Not only to 
those putting it on, but also those who simply contributed to the good 
vibe.  Which, dang it, would mean *everybody!* Raves like this DEFINATELY 
make my Mondays easier. ;)

love,
Amy

Subject: Mayday

Hi All

I'm back very temporarily before a few weeks in NZ before another
few days in Sydney (I _might_ be here for the weekend of 6-7 July)
before finally heading off to California.

A few days after Mayday (Dortmund, Germany 30/4/96) [i.e. 4/30/96 :]
i seem to have scribbled this in my notebook :)

================================================================
Scattered Thoughts on Mayday

* Big

The main hall was like the Sydney Entertainment Centre only
bigger. The main dance floor was a the size of a mostly-dismantled
velodrome. There were maybe 15000  people dancing and hanging
around in the upper tiers of seats. [Also thousands were in two
other large rooms and outside. 26000 tickets were sold.]

* Small

The organisers looked after the little things, like having
the loos cleaned occasionally duruing the night.

* Fun

Going off in a crowd of 15000 mad rave heads.

* Not So Fun

Losing your rave buddy in a crowd of 15000 mad rave heads. :)

* Loud

My ears were sore. I was wearing earplugs. Erk.

* Quiet

Eh?

* Expensive

Ticket sales would have been well over 2M Deutschmarks, but it
was all out there in the production. Awesome!

Drinks started at 3.50. Uk.

* Cheap

Camel cigarettes handing out free samples early in the night.

* Capitalism

Camel cigarettes handing out free samples early in the night,
and selling them later on. They sponsored the jungley room, 
decorated complete with a few Camel pyramids. Get them
kiddies hooked.

The third room (house/dub/trip-hop) was sponsored by a company
pushing guarana ice-cream. Mmmmmm, rave food. :)

* Socialism

Hahaha! ROFL. Are you kidding. :)

* Hot

The whole thing.

* Cold

Huge walls of clear blocks of ice with ice creams frozen in the
middle. Kept the trippers amused all night. :)

* Friendly

Lots of smiling people.

Chatted with a guy at the ice-cream company's video games stand
for ages. The ice-cream co is sponsoring a DJ and techno act
booking service in Germany. (Whether this is a good thing is
open to debate.)

* Unfriendly

There was a sign at the entrance explaining the curfew laws
for under 18s. It looks like the cops were allowed to arrest
anyone under 18 who was there past midnight (8pm for under-14s).
They didn't seem to try it though.

* Musical

Lots of variety in main room from the start (6pm) until very late.
Some hard trance, hard acid, hard house, interesting Goa and not
very vocal mainstream techno. All really cool, with some interesting
leading-edge stuff being played to 15000 people. There was lots of
nice funky trip-hop in the third room.

* Unmusical

After about 4am, all three rooms degenerated into mindless-thudding-
to-keep-the-speeders-going.

* Energetic

The main room. It was impossible not to get caught up in the vibe.

* Tired

Me after dancing for 9 hours straight. :)

* Hi Tech

The main room had absolutely the best lights & lasers i have ever seen:
new things were happening all night. Rigs that were fixed for hours on end
suddenly started moving. There was great coordination between the lights
and lasers: the colours on the multi-coloured lasers and intelligent lights
were matched perfectly. There was excellent video as well.

* Low Tech

Zip. This rave was the antithesis of do-it-yourself. Was this a Bad
Thing? Dunno: i've had as good a time on a fraction of the cost,
but i'd go to another Mayday if i got the chance.
================================================================

Other than that, i had a really fun weekend clubbing and chilling
in London later in June.

Seeya

Not much happening here in S.J..  Except for Thursdays @ Agenda(Velvet
Shop), and Fridays @ Soul'd Out(The Usual).  S.J. is usually on the house
side of things if there is anything happening in this boring city.  But I
enjoy house.  I wouldn't want to hear to much gabber or hard core trance.
I don't think it would do well in SJ.  But hey thats my opinion.

Good day,

My adventure at Unity had a lot of different componants, but I guess
that makes sense because with all the different people, promotors, and
ideology involved, the party was bound to a bit schizophrenic.
but with a general theme of unifying all those different energies, it turned
out to be an extremely enlightening and healthy night for me.

The setup was incredible.  an awesome laser/light show, a huge sound
system, that was often too loud for its own good, but still a lot of fun.
There was also a mellower room and an outside sound system, which were
also both very nice getaways from the main room.
The beginning and whole first half of the party was really satisfying
and had me sailing a very strong force as all these people were working
together and trying to make peace with each other.  In fact, I would say
that there were moments in there stronger than any other rave I've 
ever experienced.  But these moments, as strong as they were, soon began to 
go out of balance and then the energy clashed with itself as much
as it had resonated momentarily before.  It was right about this time that
the music stopped and they made some speeches.

I agree with Lee... I had a problem with Susan.  The urgency of her request
and the implication that some of us might be living life wrong seems to
contradict another idea which is that we're all in this together,
each playing our own part in a unified world that fits together perfectly.
If some pieces are wrong, and others right, well then energies clash
and stop flowing.  And this is what I feel started happening to the party.
As soon as a leader emerged, or a right/wrong relationship, it was a
large circle dance.  So a lot of people stopped dancing... a lot of people
started leaving.  I think that if the different promotors had individual
messages they wanted to share, they should have waited until the end.
Not forcing their individual ego into the group until the group had established
its own ego.

But, as this was a first try at unifying a very diverse group of promotor/party
egos and people, we can't expect achieving the balance to be easy.
After this Dubtribe did a very nice job at bringing things back into focus,
although nowhere close to the strength earlier on in the evening.

All in all, it was really good for me.  The strength and inspiration I
got from those early moments was unlike anything I've felt in a long time.
Now I just need to work on my balance, to sustain that level of energy.

anyway... my best wishes to all of you in having a spectacular day.

OK, finally good reason to cease lurking and speak up...

I've been hearing about the FnF parties since I met Wayne in March, and
_now_ I finally see what all the fuss is about!!  That was the best party
I've EVER been to, made even more meaningful for me because I was lucky
enough to help!!!

I've never ever had the experience of walking around a party and looking at
decorations my friends and I painted. Participating in the party from setup
to teardown made an amazing party even sweeter--I am sooooo proud to be
part of such an incredible group of people!! (And you'll surely find me
helping out elsewhere, now that I know how it makes everything more
special.)

It was particularly exciting when the police came, and Wayne and I got to
pose as a newly married couple at our wedding reception (good practice for
next April!). As the two very nice policeman walked into the party, Vince
arrived on stilts, and when they asked him what he was doing here, he said
he was the best man at the wedding. I think the officer was really
surprised when Ethan led him over to talk to Wayne and I, and we told him
how happy we were to be married (absolutely the truth--we might as well be
already!), and asked him if he'd seen our best man arriving on stilts!!
The two officers walked through the party, and on their way out, said to
Ehtan "Let's get one thing straight--this isn't a wedding reception, this
is a full-on rave. We weren't born yesterday..." But they left us to party
in peace...

It was really magical in the morning when EVERYONE came in to dance
together at the end of Joe Rice's set. Joe came out from behind the
turntables to dance with the crowd, everyone spontaneously joined hands in
a circle and danced together, and then rushed to the center of the room to
surround Ethan and Greg and everyone with a giant thank-you hug.

At very the end of the party, we found Phelps Feely outside, our new friend
from Freedom who managed to find Wayne in a crowd of 4000, and just had to
spend another 1/2 hour piled up on the sofa with her and Brian Darkness
before starting to sweep up rave drek and coil extension cords.

The last wonderful surprise of the day was waking up after a _long_ nap to
find Timmy (Knucklehead) and Tom Leichardt in our kitchen, freshly returned
from Sunset. We sent them home with a quesadilla and a hug...

We are soooooooooooo lucky to live in a city with such incredible things
happening. As Tony Rotundo would say... "Appreciate this!!!"

I'm still glowing...  See y'all at Chrysalis!!

Love,
   Marcy

All of the pics so far have been taken with my digital camera, but I only 
got 20-30 pics this time, cause I kept forgetting to take them, and was 
busy running around.  I'll put those up, if anyone has pictures they can 
scan and then let me ftp (or ftp them to me) I'll prepare them so Ethan 
can put them up.  I may also have time to scan some if you can't access a 
scanner, so if you need that tell me, we'll find someone to do it.

So if you got pictures and you want to share, email me and I'll help to 
get them together, this goes for past events too!

love scott

Right on!  I was in a similar situation; thanks to the kindness of one
individual =) I was lucky enough to help set up and stay for my first F&F...
it was really amazing...and I have to say that one of my favorite parts
really was helping set up in the afternoon...I'm really shy about meeting
people and it was so great to talk to such kind, warm folks (like you Marcy
:^) )...it really started the day/night off right.  What was also sooo cool
was being in this HUGE empty space bare as a newborn baby (the space not me
;) ) and being told, "this is the AMBIENT room..." Whooohoooo! :) :) :)
Later seeing the bare room dressed alladayglow with smileys, rockets, shroom
tapestries, rudolph the naughty bear books, etc...and seeing everyone glide
in with big grins, checking out the space and each other...

So that's what happened!  I thought they were looking to be paid off :o)
I heard them insisting, "It's more than 500 people...that makes it a RAVE,
not a party..."  I was kinda worried there for a while.  So glad they were
"nice cops"!
My thanks again, to everyone who made this party possible (which would
be... everyone! %^) )
And it was really cool to meet you, Marcy, and Wayne.  Hope to see all of 
y'all again sometime soon!

hugs,

As I was enveloped into the glowing, pulsating organism.. I thought,
"tonight is the night dreams are realized."  To quote _Eat Static_, this
organism had "Psychokinetic energy..... waves of energy that excite the
mind."  The music-makers were our shamans... leading us through sound...
leading us through to the beyond.  Throughout the night, this organism
churned, writhed, loved, laughed, cried, explored, voyaged, and finally
returned to this beautiful earth.  The mother welcomed us with her most
beautiful display of color, the rainbow.

Amazingly, karma came through, and beautiful people Stephanie and Jordan who
we saw in Berkeley on Sat, provided us with tickets (big HUGE thanks!).  As
we arrived, I was completely amazed at the time and energy our Family put
into the space to make it our communal home for the night.  I simply LOVED
the altars!  The communal living room like chill area was the BEST!  It was
a great place to meet new people and was suuuuuper comfy ;)   I wish more
parties would have areas like this.

The music in the main area went off nicely.  Visuals, lasers and lighting
were well done.  I didn't dance too much in the main room (too busy
spreading VIBE), but had a few good rushes.  The music in the ambient area
was well suited to the flow of energy in the crowd..  Morning Gabber??
hehe... I saw people rushing to it, but is this necessary? =)  It sure woke
people up!

The people there were sooo filled with PLUR and VIBE!  Everybody I saw had a
huge smile... everybody I met had hugs and warmth to share.  BIG HUGE HUGS
to Stephanie, Jordan, Adam, Terry, Randy, Branka, Tony, Matt, Rebecca,
Kirsten, Amy, Rachel... EVERYBODY!!  I wish I could have met each and every
person there!  If you saw a person with a *XTC* t-shirt, and a red bike
light running around giving hugs, that was me. =)

Alright.. this post is long enough, so I'll end with this:

"How many of you people know you're alive.... how many of you people REALLY
know you're alive?!"

I fell SO DAMN good! =) =)

Floating on da VIBE,
Aaron.

I headed out on Sunday for Sunset, and had a great time...  I just love
Sunset parties.. I have been going to them for quite a while, but missed
them when I went to Boulder.  It's just a great way to spend a tired Sunday
with friends.

But, there was someone there who thought it might be funny or amusing to set
off a *large* firecraker over the beach.  Now, to me this is unacceptable
(especially in light of recent events). It scared quite a few people and if
there had been cops anywhere near, they would have shut down the party super
fast.   I seriously doubt it would have been anybody on SFRaves though.
People should save that stuff up for Burning Man, where it will be more
appreciated.

Aaron.

According to CalTrans, the ramp was damaged in the '89 quake, and will
collapse when the next big one strikes. The reason Willie is speeding
up the tear-down is to force CalTrans to come up with a permanent
solution, rather than the band-aid fix they were originally
proposing. [This was reported in the Chronicle months ago.] I don't
like Willie's tactics, given that the result is going to be a major
traffic mess, but I don't blame his attitude, either, given how long
it took them to fix the I-280 and 101 interchange. 

The media also reported that Willie wants a tunnel to replace the
viaduct. Good luck trying to tunnel underneath the Muni Metro on
Market St. The Fell St. offramp will be reopened after they finish
tearing down the Oak St. onramp, at least.

Just imagine 90,000 cars detouring over alternate routes that can
handle two-thirds that much traffic, at most.

The Chronicle reported two Sundays ago that the work wasn't starting
until the end of August. Where did you hear the 8/1 date?

Fortunately, I just moved out of my apartment on Fell St. to my
fiancee's place in the Oakland Hills -- really good timing, on my
part. :) I'll miss SF, and all the funkiness of Haight, though.

Saturday night was really special, as it was my first indoor FnF event...
and now I see what such personal dedication on the part of our wonderful
community can do.

Thanks to Sunny (who not only gave us 2 more tix, but included a care
package with a Solle Sanfrandisco t-shirt, a DJ Dan tape and life savers
too!) and Paul A (who always comes through for me!), I was able to bring
along four favorite friends.

The location was great, spacious, well laid out, supercomfortable with lots
of couches and carpet in the chill space, plenty of space in the dance
room, and a wonderful outdoor area for hangin' out under the  beautiful
night skies.  Altars everywhere, great hand-made-with-love banners and
posters, free water and fruit, couldn't ask for more.

The only part for me that was missing was that some of my favorite people
were putting on Theta across the bay, and my good intentions of making that
trip in the wee hours were nixed by my better judgment and fear of flashing
blue lights ... so I stayed at FnF in body and sent my spirit to the Acme
for a while (where I heard it was rocking!)

Then the rainbow in the morning ... and my night was complete .. Thanks
everyone for each little piece of vibe you brought to the party, it was so
cool to see so many SFRavers in one place at one time -- I mean, we even
had Vince on his stilts! --  and thanks Mike M for making such a rad
t-shirt!

Love,

Leslie

http://www.sfgate.com/wais/search/chron-pro.html

and search on central freeway

You might have to register first.

Here is what I found:

The Central Freeway was damaged by the Loma Prieta earthquake of
October 1989. The section extending up Franklin and Gough streets was
closed after the quake and torn down in 1991.

The remaining double-deck section was reinforced and kept open, while
slated for eventual demolition.

The city and the state could not agree on action until Mayor Willie
Brown took office and struck a deal with Caltrans to finally start
work. Originally, Brown wanted both decks taken down at once, but
changed his mind in negotiations with the state. The state wants the
upper deck taken down and the lower level temporarily reopened while
agreement is reached on a permanent replacement.

Some neighbors are concerned about what deal Brown and Caltrans will
make for an eventual replacement. Some favor no freeway at all, others
want it put fully or partially underground and others like a
single-deck surface roadway.

Caltrans is studying a few options sent to it by the city.

Yes! I bet they could charge people half of what they do, pay their
sweat-shop-indentured servants double, spend  of what they do on
advertising, and still cut themselves a huge cheque every quarter.  But that
would probably require cutting those exorbitant executive salaries, a key
point that will never happen. They won't just shift more of the profits down
the ladder, they wuldn't be swindleing so much money, then!  
They also charge so much that only the upper middle-upper classes (and I
generalize heavily here, there's always an exception to the rule out there),
which is comprised mostly of them and the other execs on outrageous salaries
WE pay, can afford them without paying more than their wages can _really_
support.  They keep the middle class on credit, so they are slaves to the
system, paranoid that it could all come crashing down at any moment (which it
could). They use advertising to make people want to buy all these things that
are too expensive, in the name of being an eliteist (I.e. with more material
goods or a cooler look than the next Jane), and _everyone_ (again
generalizing) sees and believes it.  This makes the lower classes, who can't
afford it _hate_ the upper classes, which causes crime. And hatred goes both
ways, because the upper and middle classes knows the have-nots are willing to
take their money/goods by force.  Of course, the upper class is hit less
often because they can afford all the insurance, alarm systems and security,
and they know it.  
So it really comes down to classism. It's the upper class using the rift
between the lower class and the middle class, which _they_ have
created/maintain, and can more readily protect themselves from, to make their
profits.  Does that seem correct?

>It's always best to avoid companies that advertise too much, isn't it?

All too true!  And most advertising is nothing short of brainwashing!  I'm
sure you all know this!  Many ads, especially on TV, have a quality that
makes you feel inferior if you don't buy their product.  They offer
unrealistic images of how cool folx that wear nikes are, and imply that you
_aren't_ if you don't wear nikes.  I think all these images on TV and in
magazines (Cosmo, Teenwhatever, etc.) add to people being divided.  It makes
those feelings of : "if you ain't the way  _we_  think you should be, then
you are wrong, and therefore inferior", jump off the TV and in to real
peoples psyches, who then apply it to everyday life.  I think this feeling is
older than TV, but that TV and commercialism since the 50's has been a
_major_ factor that has been keeping  it alive, mostly because it motivates
people to buy.  The societal impact is almost a side effect, though a major
one.  Just my $2.00 :) worth! 

Peacefully though angstfully,

I hate to drag this thread up again, but I was away all weekend.  I have
just a few things to say...

1 - Yes, Win95 reportedly scans your local drive for other MS software,
	and tries to determine whether it is legally registered.
2 - Cookie files can be used as a subliminal channel for getting this
	information back to MS.  This would be the elegant way of doing
	it.  More likely, the MS Explorer software would just connect with
	the MS site and send the info directly.
3 - Regarding Java: I wouldn't trust foreign code on my machine.  There
	are still big security holes, and more being discovered all the
	time.
4 - Having just come from DefCon, I have to say: nothing is 100% secure.

  My solution, by the way: don't run microsoft software.  Letter writing
campaings against a software company this size will get you nowhere so
long as you're paying for their products.  I personally don't use software
unless I can read the source code.  This is the only way to know for sure
whether or not rumours like the one above are true.

The space was breathtaking, otherworldly: colorful decorations throughout,

Concertlike lighting in the dance area, and convenient cubby holes :)
The music, from first beat to last, was brilliant!  I heard only one moment
of unmatched beats, but it didn't faze us dancers.  I found myself making
several trips to the dance floor, and even danced to what Matt Lanier
called the "sharp, pointy" music!  This was the first time I found the
dancing trance; maybe the combination of the right music and the right vibe
encouraged it.  I was, well, somewhere I've never been to before, and it
was exciting yet relaxing, a feeling of being remotely attached to, and
remotely aware of, my dancing body.
The dance area was hot, but not oppressive, and the free water was a
godsend (or whatever ;)).  I enjoyed pouring water for a few thirsty ravers
:)
I think I spent most of my time outside, and shared some deep and
meaningful moments with beautiful souls there.  I also shared quite a lot
with a few people on the dance floor (although I feel hesitant to bother
people while they're dancing), and in the chill area.  I think I sat with
Robert for a while, can't recall what we were watching, just remember
sitting together on the floor, feeling more like one big ball of love and
positive energy than two separate beings.  There was another guy on the
dance floor, who wore a black miniskirt (who was he?  We didn't even
exchange names), and for no known reason we locked our fingers together,
stared into each other's eyes, and I felt a powerful but soothing exchange
of warmth and energy.  I deeply cherish the metaphysical experiences I have
while at parties!
Observation: It appears to me, from all the parties I've been to (two years
this September), that males are more likely to engage in these deep,
meaningful, ultra-personal exchanges with me than females are, and I don't
think my approach to either is different.  In such an environment, I
consider myself a being of light and love, not a male, female, straight,
gay, bisexual, republican, democrat, American, Welshman, etc.  I told
someone I talked with that it's all about peace, love, unity, and respect,
and he agreed, even though he wasn't on this list :)
There was this gal, with short, curly red hair, who had dropped, and it
much harder than she expected, but was still loving it.  She was so happy,
and she'd be running around and playing like a care-free child.  It was
wonderful to watch!  I sat with her outside for a bit, making sure she was
OK, and we explored the party a little, then she reminded me that I was
free to roam as I pleased, so I did.
Mattloaf gives AMAZING hugs, people!  And he's got a beautiful heart.  Meet
this guy!
I kept saying "Everyone's here!"  That was almost true.  The picture would
have been closer to complete if we had Jess Fogler, Marty, and John
Kawamoto there, to name a few.  I was overjoyed that so many of the people
who interduced me to raving (the old "Jeremy's garage crew," now disbanded
but a strong presence in the scene; anyone ever hear of Greg Sandler?).  I
also said, to almost everyone I talked to, "Don't take this the wrong way,
but I love you."  As if there's a wrong way to take that!  I think people
appreciated it and were amused by it at the same time :)
Nancy barely spoke to me, and always seemed to be on a mission, without the
time to stop and chat.  Diana Greer spent a few moments with me, here and
there, but all too few and too brief, and she left without saying good-bye.
Those were the closest things to low points of the entire party.
Pouring out from the dance floor into the morning light with the music, and
seeing the rainbow, helped lessen that feeling of "Oh, no!  It's morning
already!"  The fruit and muffins were delicious, and so was everyone there.
The hand-holding circle at the end that became a huge mass of flesh as we
all pressed together was the first such experience for me in about a year;
I'm so glad it continues!  The last dance was uplifting, and the conclusion
was the perfect way to end a 9.9 on a 10-scale experience.  WE created and
shared something magical, something deeper than we sometimes realize, while
strengthening the ties that bind us together in heart, mind, body, and
soul.  It is so nice indeed to have the family together!
Huge thanks to everyone who worked on this party, and to everyone who
attended.  Extra special thanks to Jay Wiley for the ride, and for being
such a cool and nice person :)

Now, don't take this the wrong way... ;)

I see.  But, they do have controll because they are the ones
negotiating/paying the contract.  Those with whom they are contracting must
be of integrity, not just the cheapest, which is probably how they decide.
 And, the corporations were the ones who pressured our government to conduct
trade agreements with the countries where the contracts lie (central America)
involving free trade zones and such.  To be honest, that is another area I
must study up on.  But what I gather is that they are areas with different
laws on trade and manufacturing, basicly removing tarriffs and abolishing
labor and environmental laws which makes the areas able to produce _cheaper_
, which is always the goal of the greedy.  Besides, if they now have lower
manufacture costs (even for the wrong reasons), we should at _least_ see a
drop in prices to the consumer.  But usually all we see is a jump in _their_
profits and executive salaries.  I didn't think I would ever think this, but
it looks like a planned system to keep the status quo at best, or make the
exploitation worse, more likely.
Gee, anyone up to revolution yet?  We should do something... Any suggestions

Amen to that sister! :):)  It really was an incredible experience, being able 
to help set up during the day, this too was my first time doing that.  I've 
always been used to just attending parties, showing up 11-12 pm with BOOM! 
rave in your face, going full blast, and just jumping right into it.  This 
has always been immense fun of course.  This time it was very different to 
see the warehouse during the day and observe the slow transformation from 
empty warehouse to beautiful rave-site, and actually almost made it more 
difficult to make my own transition from running around trying to get stuff 
set up to allowing myself to go into party-goer mode, but it makes it all the 
more meaningful.  And it really was something special, and makes me proud, 
that I was able to contribute (in whatever small way) to something that went 
off that great! :)  I hope to do that again sometime.  (and did anybody get a 
chance to try the plums from the juice bar, we had fresh picked them that same 
day from the orchards! :)

And as a party itself, FnF rocked!! :)  It really was an amazing group of 
people gathered there that night.  Everybody I talked to had a *great* time.  
And the ending really just blew me away.  I was just sitting outside with 
friends staring at the beautiful clouds above listening to the music, when I 
just spontaneously decided I had to dance, so I ran inside to join the others 
in the dance area where Joe was spinning an absolutely delicious morning set 
(perfect set Joe, thanks! :).  It felt so great in spite of how tired I was at 
that point, the music just flowed thru me as perfectly as it could have. And I 
realize that as I'm dancing, everybody else is trickling thru the big opened 
roll-up door to join in the dance, and pretty soon all of us who were still 
there were dancing, and before I knew it everybody had joined hands & formed a 
big circle together, and then the circle broke apart and still dancing, 
everybody rushed to the middle of the room for one of the most intense 
enormous group hugs I've experienced! :)  Then, laughing & cheering, Ethan & 
everybody spontaneously break into a big ol' happy birthday song for Joe Rice, 
which of course seemed the perfect way to end the party.  (happy 24th you old 
fart! did reagan give you that spanking she was talking about? ;)   The space 
was just about perfect, seems like hardly anybody has an ambient room anymore 
at their parties, I really miss them!  So yeah, it had the main room, the 
ultra-comfy ambient room, and a great outdoor area which was AWESOME with the 
absolutely beautiful night.  And I am somehow absolutely astounded at the fact 
that a rainbow came out to greet us in the early morning!  Driving home later 
that morning I just couldn't get over how perfectly everything came together, 
culminating with the rainbow overhead and the enormous circle & group hug 
below.  Two full circles, above & below, (look out, spiritual symbolism! ;) 
everytime I go to a really spectacular party it reminds me of how we all 
somehow go thru these amazing journeys together, and at the end come full 
circle back home again, both literally and figuratively, all together with 
huge smiles on our faces.  What fun! :)

Boy, reading back on my post, my words really don't do much justice to the 
experience.  But it really was spectacular.  And I think I should say here, to 
all of you who went, what you all experienced at that party is the very reason 
these people throw these parties, it's why the superstar dj's ;) are out there 
sweeping & cleaning up with everybody else afterwards, it's why they only 
charge $5 a person, it's why all the proceeds benefit other people.  It's true 
that people have called me a rave-snob before, and I've always objected to 
that, but now I will openly admit that's true actually.  When I compare 
parties like the one I attended Saturday night, and see the effort that was 
put in when no profit at all is being made simply to give something beautiful 
to the scene *and* benefit other groups that deserve it, and compare it to $25 
parties with no effort or caring put in at all to any sort of comfort or 
beauty, or respect for the party-goers, where they cram 1000 people into a 
space that comfortably holds a max of 600-700 people, where half the promised 
big-name dj's don't show up (and no, I am not pointing fingers at any 
particular parties, so dont get your panties in a bunch! ;), I can't help but 
get just a *leetle* more selective about what parties I go to & what groups I 
support.  Yeah, that makes me pick some parties & choose to not attend other 
parties (or yeah, bitch when I find myself stuck at a party I probably 
shouldn't have attended), but it really does come down to quality I guess.  Of 
course I won't buy a pair of shoes I think are overexpensive pieces of shit 
(imho of course, other people may favor them), and I will buy ones I think are 
of good value and great quality.  That, and (this may earn me a flame or two, 
eh?) for me raving really does cross over into the realms of morals and ways 
to live life, and parties like saturday's are thrown by people whose ideas & 
ideals seem to jive way more with my own than a lot of other parties.  So call 
me a rave-snob!  Dammit, I'm proud to stick to my ideals! ;)

Alright, enough blithering.  Y'alls get the point! :)

Love,
Shawna

<< I agree with Lee... I had a problem with Susan.  The urgency of her
request
 and the implication that some of us might be living life wrong seems to
 contradict another idea which is that we're all in this together,
 each playing our own part in a unified world that fits together perfectly.
 If some pieces are wrong, and others right, well then energies clash
 and stop flowing.  And this is what I feel started happening to the party.
 As soon as a leader emerged, or a right/wrong relationship, it was a
 large circle dance.  So a lot of people stopped dancing... a lot of people
 started leaving.  >>

I see your point on the subject, no one likes to be wrong, no one likes a
preacher ( I sometimes falter there).  But do you deny that some people _do_
live life wrong?  The fights that broke out, which I understand were like 20
on 1 affairs, prove that this is true (unless one thinks beating people up
like that is OK...).  And to educate those who do live negatively may help.
 It shows them that there are people who really want to make this scociety
better, restoring some of the hope they have lost (IMHO why they live so
neg).  People are too hung up on the "everyone is equal" thing to realize
that whereas that is true, you can negate that fact with actions you choose,
like jumping someone and sending them to the hospital.  No one, no matter how
big an idiot, should be put in jepardy of life by others...which is what was
going on if its 20 to 1 and the victim ends up needing serious medical
attention.  Just my $.02, Thanx!

I couldn't seem to find how to do this.  I use AOL 3.0.  Can ya clue me in?

Oh yah! I always do!   I'm going to switch to a local provider in Santa Rosa,

but I've now heard som unnerving things about it.  Any others with good

Gladly accepting all info, as I have not gotten it all clear yet, and I

<<1 - Yes, Win95 reportedly scans your local drive for other MS software,

Others said they removed this feature in their latest release.  If so, how

Ok.  This cookie thing... It is written to my hard drive by any web site I
access (presumably the cache of AOL) and when I re-connect to the site, what
happens?  Thankfully I know enough to not use MSNet!

Java a foreign code?  Must be a MAC thing, right?  Code for what?  And what

DefCon... please explain...again! {Boy, you should charge me for all

     And now for an extended sermon...
     
     What moral code anywhere states that beating somebody like that is 
     cool?  I had lotsa friends that rumbled occasionally back in LA, and I 
     personally once got thumped on three to one, but I can't make sense of 
     this crap (and my doctor never did get my ribcage just right again).
     
     We've spent a lot of time talking about what raves to bring people to 
     for their first time, and hearing something like this makes me think 
     it might not be the rave that's not working out.  If you know people 
     who you think are capable of crap like this, keep them the fuck away 
     from me, because frankly, they don't make sense.  I want to live a 
     life that is MORE open, LESS afraid and more involved in the lives of 
     those around me.
     
     I honestly don't care how good the music was if somebody got 
     hopitalized at Unity.  It's not the promoters fault, I'm sure nobody 
     wanted it to happen but it SUCKS!!!  I hereby reserve the right to 
     speak my mind without being intimidated (20 of anything kicking my ass 
     would be pretty intimidating), to share my heart honestly, and to 
     enjoy life in an environment where openness is it's own reward.  I got 
     lucky and happened to be at a place where Peace, Love, Unity and 
     Respect found their proper place Saturday night...
     
     IN YOUR FACE SHAKIN YOUR ASS ON A DANCE FLOOR WHILE TRANCE IS PLAYING 
     AND EVERYBODY IS SMILING, GIFTS ARE EXCHANGING, AND LOVE ISN'T JUST A 
     WORD TO GET LAID WITH BUT A FORCE BEYOND COMPREHENSION!!!
     
     Love,
     Andy W
     
     So how do you get a crowd that appreciates a good mellow vibe and 
     won't start shit... hey, why don't they throw an invitation/referral 
     only rave... Now I understand, as fucked as it was for all the great 
     people that didn't make it.  Thank you.  If we all do our part in 
     making parties like this happen (promoting, spinning, helping out, 
     smiling, dancing, laughing, bringing altars, blessings, greeting, 
     sharing, cleaning up, storytelling, keeping it cool), eventually the 
     message/gift/vibe might get to everyone, at a time and place in their 
     lives when they're ready for it.  I guess I'm having trouble ending 
     this so sorry if I just stop here.

 and the implication that some of us might be living life wrong seems to 
 contradict another idea which is that we're all in this together,
 each playing our own part in a unified world that fits together perfectly. 
 If some pieces are wrong, and others right, well then energies clash
 and stop flowing.  And this is what I feel started happening to the party. 
 As soon as a leader emerged, or a right/wrong relationship, it was a
 large circle dance.  So a lot of people stopped dancing... a lot of people 
 started leaving.  >>
     
I see your point on the subject, no one likes to be wrong, no one likes a 
preacher ( I sometimes falter there).  But do you deny that some people _do_ 
live life wrong?  The fights that broke out, which I understand were like 20 
on 1 affairs, prove that this is true (unless one thinks beating people up 
like that is OK...).  And to educate those who do live negatively may help.
 It shows them that there are people who really want to make this scociety
better, restoring some of the hope they have lost (IMHO why they live so neg). 
 People are too hung up on the "everyone is equal" thing to realize that 
whereas that is true, you can negate that fact with actions you choose, like 
jumping someone and sending them to the hospital.  No one, no matter how big 
an idiot, should be put in jepardy of life by others...which is what was going 
on if its 20 to 1 and the victim ends up needing serious medical attention.  
Just my $.02, Thanx!

Hi all!

 Well now that I'm nearly recovered from FnF (whoosh!) I think that I 
should thank a few people who really made the night special for me;

Ethan;  Even though I feel I didn't work that hard you made the effort to 
        thank me personally for that work and you made me feel very 
        welcome. You brought a tear to my eye more than once. Thank you.

Kia;    You opened up your heart and shared your space and perspective 
        with me. You are one of the most intelligant people I have ever 
        met (IMHO) and I thank you for your warmth and honesty.

M.Clay; Thanks for your good cheer and your efforts to get me to the 
        party. You shared something of immense value that can not be 
        replicated ever.

Ela;    You will probably never read this but thank you. You choose to 
        spend time with me freely and at a time that I really needed 
        someone to be with. Your beauty and strength touched me in a way 
        I'll always cherish.

Brandon; Dude, you are such a gas to hang with (eh?)!! Thanks so much for 
         YOUR company and smiling face AND for introducing me around to 
         the SFravers!!

To all of the SFravers I met; Amy, Nancy (aha, finally we met!), Renault, 
and the others whose names I'm having difficulty recalling.

BIG THANKS TO THE FnF CREW!!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!

 (is okay to say that?) ;)

HELP NOTICE:

 I left my digital/multimeter at the party. It has my last name written 
 on the front (Cone) in large black letters. If anyone would like to 
 return it to me I would be very grateful. I use that device to make sure 
 things are working and safe for all party goers.


NEXT PARTY:

 I'll probably be going to Chrysalis and would love to hook up with 
 someone who is driving that way. I'm also open to suggestions from those 
 of you out there on other partys.


Peace, hugs, =)s, and lots of love to any who read this!!!!



Ran

Friends and Family - A review
--------------------------------

Saturday finally arrives,   and as early evening approaches I head
out to the Haight to meet a friend then head out to San Mateo for
dinner with another friend,  where Jeremy is to meet up with us
later.

Jeremy finally arrives,  so we head out for E. Bay using San Mateo
bridge after learning that Bay Bridge is a NO NO.

We finally locate the venue,   and as we arrive in the parking area,
our car was efficiently shuffled into it's spot,   and we take a short
walk to the venue.

The Venue (A warehouse) was excellent.   It had a large outside area,
lots of old cars and trailers around,  and fairly large and spacious
inside.

>From the outside,  we could barely hear the music,  but once inside,
we were greeted with a well decorated chill space,  and off to the far
wall was the smoothie bar.

The main dance area was inside yet another area,  and was arranged
very well to prevent sound from escaping.

Not sure who the DJ was,  but he was spinning some good consistent
house.

The vibe was totally amazing,  and before long,  I found myself on
the dance floor,  totally into the music and the vibe.   There were
smiles everywhere..    Plenty of soft chill space to flop down on to
stretch after long dancing periods.    Fans to keep the air circulating,
and the temperature to a reasonable level, and a really large outside
area to romp around in.

Eventually Ethan went on and played his own stuff,   mixing it with
some of his fine vinyl.  Excellent set....

Towards the end,   as I was walking around outside,   I hear this fast
beats coming from the chill area,  so I discovered that Dave Bayer
was spinning some sick hardcore.    I wouldn't call it Gabber,
because Gabber is heaps faster than what Dave was spinning,  but it
was fast enough for most....  hovering round the 160- 170 BPM range.
Towards the end of Dave's set,  he veered off into more ambient as I
made my way to hear Joe Rice finish up his set.   Towards the end,
everyone formed a huge circle then rushed into the middle
to form this huge "Hug circle"....    At the end,  everyone cheered....

Excellent party....  my face still hurts from smiling so much...

Dean, Jeremy and myself finally pull out around 8 am and head back to
San Mateo...   Dean heads South and head north for some breakfast and
to 24 hour Nautilus for a workout and a well deserved shower and hottub
before heading out to a meadow to do some meditation before Sunset.

I arrive early at Pt Molate,  find a shady spot and chill until Sunset
started.

Sunset was Phat,  and Minor Minor ripped it up with some amazing and new
techno sounding stuff.   Good job...

Oh Dr. Seuss, he's my hero he's so fine, he blows my mind!
Sorry to inconvenience any of yo're inboxes but rymes from Suess just 
make me feel funky, so i thought i'd make some o you feel FUNKY too!!~~~


 If Dr. Seuss were a Technical Writer

     Here's an easy game to play.
     Here's an easy thing to say.

     If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
     And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort.
     And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
     Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

     If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
     And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,
     And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash.
     Then your siutation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash!

     You can't say this?
     What a shame, sir!
     We'll find you
     another game, sir!

     If the label on the cable on the table at your house
     Says the network is connected to the button on the mouse,
     But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
     That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,
     And your screen is all distorted by the side affects of Gauss,
     So your icons in the windows are so wavy as a souse,
     Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
     'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!

     When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
     And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC.
     Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.
     Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!

(From Nancy)

Friends and Family...

...blew my mind.  Is it possible to still have your mind blown after two 
years of raving, of already having all the realizations about what it's 
all about?

Yes, because one revelation does not alter your reality forever.  We need 
to be reminded, we need to keep striving to return to our center, to the 
peace and love at the core, because the noise and chaos of everyday material reality pulls 
at us so tenaciously.  Maybe, back before religion was corrupted by 
institutionalization and power, that was the original intent behind a day 
set aside for worship each week - a continual recentering in love and light.

I was thinking Saturday of the experience as our church (I know that is 
not original! - many others have felt and articulated the same :).  There 
it is a house of worship where we abandon the cynicism and supposed 
apathy of our age.  We are given a haven in which we can connect to love 
without embarrassment or disbelief, but instead throw ourselves in with 
arms open wide and proclaim, "This is it!  This is what we believe!  This 
is what we're about - love and kindness and openness!"  And the 
sheltering protected space of the party is a unique space that 
immediately mirrors back to us the effect of acting wholeheartedly with 
that belief.  We are rewarded immeasurably by waves upon waves of 
positive energy returned to us.  The cosmic rule of what you give comes 
back to you, a thousand fold.

I have long felt the spirituality inherent in the best raves (to me, the 
true raves).  But often it is a personal experience, only hinted at by 
the party organizers themselves.  Friends and Family - as an 
"organization" - is explicit about the connection.  The many beautiful 
alters, the sage to mark our sacred space, the messages on the walls.  
These let us know that this is not just a party so we can have fun, 
partying and having fun is how we celebrate our beauty, our love, and the 
wonder of connection.  These are our religious ceremonies, the rituals 
that reunite us with the power of positivity and the possibilities of 
hope.

I was walking around the party overwhelmed with love for every single 
person there.  (Is it possible to fall in love with 500 people at 
once? :P)  Saturday night was the first time that I really 
felt "family."  Before I had felt great good will for all the people at 
parties like this, a definite collective connection through energy and 
music.  But at Friends and Family it finally REALLY hit me that everyone 
was there together.  And suddenly I was smiling at everyone, talking 
to people beyond those I already knew.  Because for the first time I 
realized that we were all brothers and sisters in this family of happy 
ravers, and it suddenly seemed almost rude NOT to say hi to whomever I 
was near! :)

Several newbies came, people I was pretty sure of.  I believe there 
are certain prerequisites for coming into the underground - they must 
be open and willing to give, or else it won't work for them.  It won't 
hurt the party, the people themselves just won't "get it."  They'll 
leave early and say that they don't like raving.   Because in our 
"church," there is no intermediary, no priest or rules telling you what 
your spirituality is.   There is only 
the individual's beliefs and attitude, and how that manifests their experience.    

It was more than gratifying to watch the expressions on the newbies' faces 
change from uncertainty upon entering (what is this rave thing all about?), to 
enjoyment, to awe.  I took one, an ex-Deadhead, showing him some things 
that I see.  He was quiet as he soaked it in, and then slowly turned to 
me and said with surprise, 'this is really cool!"  Aha!  Another one!

I wrote an earlier post about how we are not dependent on F&F for this 
experience (rad as their parties are).  Everyone that night oozed with 
friendliness and positivity, and (besides the incredible decoration 
and production and selflessness of the F& F crew - THANK YOU SO MUCH!!) 
THAT was what made the party so amazing.  Let's all remember to bring 
that same level of participation to all of our parties.  There's a 
Chrysalis next weekend - let's make it go OFF!!

P.S.  It would have been hard to miss me - I was quite elegantly 
turned-out in flowing thriftstore nightgown and feather boa ;).  But most of 
my conversations ended after hello, I was a little too out of my head to 
talk too much, and there's always so much to do at a party anyway!!  But 
love out to all of you and see you at the next one!

Love, Nancy

Had a wonderful time.  Danced really hard.  Slept for a short time on one of
the couches with a friend.  Danced some more.  Hung out with an old good
friend (PF;)  Got stoked by Lee Fogel with a tape of original music of his
creation.  It's really good stuff.  We listened to it driving back to
Sacramento.  Thank you Lee.....you should release that stuff.  Got to dance
to Belfast and see a rainbow.  Got to hear Ethan's mala story.   Biggest hug
I ever experienced.  I love you people.

Dear friends,

        In my review of FnF, I made some remarks that have been
misunderstood.  I didn't mean a single word to be taken as a personal
attack or complaint.  I was merely pointing out something that I found odd
in the behavior of some of my friends, or, more accurately perhaps, my
perception of odd behavior.  I am reminded that not everyone experiences a
party in the same way.  I think it was a reaction from my hyper-sensitive
to have felt snubbed or neglected.  I bear no ill will toward anyone.  In
the future, I will try to express myself in a more appropriate manner, and
try to be more precise, so as to avoid any misunderstandings.  How else
will anyone believe me when I say that I love you all?  Sorry to bother
y'all with this.

Love,

Eric

the life of a paper cup is not a good life most of the time.
the cup is thrown onto the ground into the middle of traffic.
feet sweeping by, barely noticing the poor cup sit there alone
but most dodge the cup as a subconscious gesture
if the cup is proud and strong, it stands upright for all to see
do not kick me over it seems to say
the unlucky cup, the sick cup lays on its side
but it doesnt matter in the end, sooner or later through some unfortunate
accident
through a forest of feet
and side stepping shoes
the little cup gets kicked, or crunched
after the first injury, the little cup gets even less respect.
while it is down and injured... crunch crunch until it is gone.
the life of a cup.
arent you glad people aren't cups?

What can I say?  I was a little worried that I was expecting too much 
after hearing all the stuff from you guys, but it was beyond it...  My 
first FnF, but from now on I am sure I will never miss another one :).  

The chill room was incredible...  agghhh ...  I want one in my house just 
like that :)...

Great moments
- seeing Tony's picture mooning somebody displayed on the altar- GO 
TONY!!!!  - although you were not there I am sure many people thought of 
you :)

- seeing all my friends from the list (I am not naming everybody because 
I am sure I would forget somebody and then feel bad :( and meeting few 
new people (again, not as many as I wanted - I hate when that happens)

- morning rainbow, and trying to convince some guy that we have a project - 
gathering everybody from inside and telling them about rainbow (he wasn't 
ready to do that), and before I could shut up the door opened and 
everybody came outside anyway :)))

- fruit, water, muffins :)

- happy people who put up with my silly babling (I just could not shut 
up and stop smiling all night)

- trying to convince people that Ethan's tattoos were air-brushed because 
they just looked so good :P

- etc.....

Bad moments

- hearing only 5 min on John Carol's (SP???) set - my roommate recommended 
him highly, but I was too busy to notice when he came on - does he have 
a tape out? where?

- not dancing enough

- end of the party (I wished it would just keep going)


I can just keep thinking about it and tell people who didn't make it what 
they missed.  I am sorry about driving people crazy (if you were near me 
while I was sitting in the chair outside, or if I just ran into you and 
couldn't stop talking shit you know what I mean).  I didn't mean to be 
annoying (I am sure I was, but....  I had fun and I hope if I bugged you, 
you will forgive me).  OK....  enough...time to get back to work.

I love you all and see you soon.
Hugz,
Branka

P.S. Thanks FnF crew, thanks everybody for making my weekend so special

Hi all,
thanks to Ann and Drenalin and Patrick for helping me find tix!  I had 
such a blast at the party--and so did my friends who were visiting from
back east.  Props to the F&F crew as always; John Carel's set was awesome,
and pre-dawn gabber was cool as well.... And that space was the best-
decorated one I've ever been to.  I guess I always get superlative when
writing reviews, but I mean it when I say that this was a *reeeeallllllly*
memorable party...
thank you
Timothy

of course nobody honestly believes that fighting is cool, or right...
(well, once you get deep enough into their soul, beyond their fears that
may feel a need to defend themselves)

But I think this scratches on an idea that is important to me.

It really isn't this simple.  You can't just hide or protect yourself from
'the evil people'.  The only way you will ever become free is when you are
strong enough to face that 'evil' head on and still be your ideal self.
When you can smile at the person who is grimacing at you and melt their fear
with your good intention.  When you can see yourself reflected in their
eyes and know that nothing can harm you, and then you proceed to dance and 
inspire them to dance with you.

I had the option of going to F&F or Unity and I chose Unity.  I knew that I
would've had a spectacular time at F&F because I have every time I've gone 
before.  But the reason I didn't go is because I already knew what I'd be 
getting at F&F.  as good as it is, if the struggle becomes too easy,
it can lose its beauty.  Understand that I'm not knocking anyone or F&F,
I plan on going to the next one, but sometimes in order to reach a new level
of strength you have to throw yourself into torrential waters, and find your
faith that you will survive stronger than before.  For me, the ideas
surrounding Unity encompassed such torrential energies that I couldn't
pass up the challenge.  and the fights that broke out, the whirlwind
of egos, and the sheer power of the coherent moments seem to vindicate
that these energies need balancing within me, and that when things become
aligned a powerful force will find itself.

I believe that everything you come across at a party or in normal life is 
a reflection of your own mind, and by finding your own internal peace with
the objects that confront you, you create peace in the material world.

You're right... we are entitled to exactly those rights.  But we can't depend
on luck alone.  We need to feel able to bring peace, love, unity, and respect
to wherever we want, whenever we want... or we are just being intimidated
and succombing to fear in another form.

If you know what freedom is, you are not free.  

I know that F&F is a great model of freedom, but because I know it and
expect it, it becomes its own trap, keeping me from exploring the unknown.
sure there are scary things in the unknown, but they are all ultimately
reflections of myself, and I am the one who decides the meaning and makes
the rules... so in the end I will always recognize the evil as myself and
find my freedom.

It's not always easy, but it is always beautiful.

take care, my friends.

Over a year's worth of pushing and prodding from countless friends (esp. in
UCB) has finally come to a head, so I think I'm going to try to go veg this
semester.

I know many of you are vegetarians out there, so I thought I'd throw this
out onto the list: Are there any kind of vitamins/protein supplements I
should be taking? Should I be a lot more careful about what I'm eating
since I'm not getting that protein blast every time my dad makes steak?

mmm... I'm really going to miss his steak =9

not really.  if you're going to try and go vegan (no dairy products), you
might think about taking a b12 supplement, but lots of grains are
"enriched" with b12 and other vitamins so most likely it's nothing to
worry about...

ugh, you've been brainwashed to believe the "protein myth".  don't worry
about it, it's bullshit.  just eat good quality food (organic if
possible), and try and maintain a well-rounded diet (lots of veggies,
fruits, grains...).  grab some veggie cookbooks and make your own food,
it's cheaper and better (but can be a bit frustrating at first if you're
not used to it).  also, pick up John Robbins' "diet for a new america".

talk to me 6 months from now, you won't be missing it at all.  in fact
you'll be wondering how you could ever put that in your body before...

Protein is easy. US diets are very high in protein and you can get by
on much less than most people eat. Just eat a reasonable amount of
beans, peas (or lentils or anything like that) or tofu. Tofu is a
bean-based product that's really high in protein, low in fat, and comes
in a myriad variety of forms, some of which can be cooked just like
meat. If you're eating dairy products, then you can get lots of protein
from cheese also.

The only real vitamin concern is that vegan diets can be deficient in
B12.  You can get B12 from diary products though. In any case, a cheap
multivitamin/mineral supplement won't hurt.
 
> mmm... I'm really going to miss his steak =9

Don't worry. It's amazing how much you lose appetite for meat if you
stop eating it for a while.

A friend of mine here at work is vegan (no animal products whatsoever)
and he says that you shouldn't have to worry about taking supplements
like B-12 if you're still gonna be eating dairy products. Protein 
shouldn't be a problem as long as you eat a variety of different kinds
of beans and other vegetarian/dairy sources of protein in order to get
the complete range of amino acids.

A good idea also would be to check with your doctor to see if you have
any other special requirements.

I'm also trying to convert to vegetarian...it's a better source of 
positive energy!!!!

Peace,
John

having been a vegetarian for 20 years, i totally agree with you on this one.
the only difference i have noticed when eating lots of protein in contrast
to very litlle is that it was next to impossible to gain muscle bulk,
although my muscle strength increased normally. surprise surprise. none there.

I thought maybe some of you out there might like this..



      Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.  John F.
      Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.

      Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.  John F.  Kennedy
      was elected President in 1960.

      The names Lincoln and Kennedy each contain seven letters.  Both
      were particularly concerned with civil rights.  Both their wives
      lost their children while living in the White House.

      Both Presidents were shot on a Friday.  Both were shot in the
      head.  Both were shot in the presence of their wives.  The
      Secretary of each President warned them not to go to the theater
      and to Dallas, respectively.

      Lincoln's Secretary was named Kennedy  Kennedy's Secretary was
      named Lincoln.

      Both were assassinated by Southerners.  Both were succeeded by
      Southerners.  Both successors were named Johnson.  Andrew
      Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808.  Lyndon
      Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.

      John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839.

      Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.

      Both assassins were known by their three names.  Both names
      comprise fifteen letters.  Booth ran from the theater and was
      captured in a warehouse.  Oswald ran from the warehouse and was
      captured in a theater.

      To cap it all off, Booth and Oswald were assassinated before
      their trials.

      What do you think: Mystery or a statistical co-incidence?


Pretty trippy if you ask me..

Hey! Sorry to see you go!  I for one thank meat as the founder of human
intelligence and "succsess" as a species, as has been suggested by
anthropologists (refrences elude me).  Bipedality first, (ability to carry
kids AND other things simultaneously) and then protiens (building blocks for
your bod when it's growing) cuz we could grab 'em off the Savahna and run
back to the trees.  We have become humans because we were omnivorous.  Who am
I to second guess Nature?  Also, though I understand the evil practices of
beef, poultry and other meat producers, I try not to put limitations on
myself, because then I won't risk lying to me. And besides, I like steak!
 The two main reasons vegitarianism is a good idea: health and politics.  An
alternative plan I use to address these is to:   

A: limit the ammount of meat I eat. 

This is easy cuz it's so expensive!   The general public is driven by a false
campaign in the 70's-80's known as the four basic food groups...a documented
scam perpotrated by the dairy/beef industry... that helps us believe
underneath, even though we can now see the truth, that we need meat, and more
is better.It is strong because we heard it so long(or I did, anyway).  True,
meat is not needed, but protiens are, especially for kids, and meats chosen
wisely and moderately ensures they/you get enough.  

B: only eat meats produced localy by small-timers, organic if possible. No
McDonalds, No Foster Farms, etc. 

I happen to live on a cool farm up north in Sonoma County that has sheep(not
mine).  I see how they live, and I approve.  They just hang out together and
eat all day!  Plus, I have been through all phases of their "production",
from bucking (hick for stacking) hay to shearing the wool to reaching up in
there to help a chick sheep birth a lamb when the owner was unable to get
there in time to do it (yucky, yet beautifull!).  The only thing that bothers
me is that they play with hormones.

As far as the suppliment thing goes, I turn away from them.  We are
surrounded by foods containing all the proper nutrients, so if you eat right,
you shouldn't need pills.  As well, most suppliments do not contain key
enzymes and analogous compounds that are required to make the nutrients
available to your body.  I heard  that something  like 90% of calcium in
 non-chelated calcium pills (the typical type) is eliminated in body wastes,
while from milk, like 80% is usable!(These are approximations by me)  Big
diff, eh!

I've noticed that some people suggested Tofu.  RAD food!  I'll send you a
killer recipie.  But, I'm pretty sure it contains only simple protiens (soys
are like any bean), and must be eaten with rice or the like to get the
compound protiens your body needs.  This "simple protiens only" is a problem
I have heard of for veg's, so watch out.  You are wise to look carefully at
this issue of nutrients.  

Being a carnivore, I obviously have not all the answers.  I do know some
folks that have been veggies for like 25 years, dedicated to their health,
and educated in the ways of vegiterianism.  I can fax them for some
guidelines if you like!

Good luck on your new quest, i hope you have strong will power!  It can be
done if you really mean it ! :)!

They suggest you take in more servings of meat than you really need.  I
suppose most of you know this, but maybe this'll touch someone.  Anyhow,
it's because the [beef] industry is so powerful; it has a hand over the
=46ood and Drug Administration.

     Confessions of a Carnivore
     
     Hate to be the voice of lameness, and this is going to cost me dearly, 
     but I had some personal experiences with vegetarian living...
     
     When I was 17, I decided I would quit eating meat.  I started losing 
     weight.  I maintained a well balanced diet, drank milk, took vitamin 
     and mineral supplements, and generally felt better once my system got 
     used to it.  My sister at the time was experiencing severe 
     anorexia/bulimia (she was down to 2/3 of her recommended body weight), 
     and her shrink and my parents got all over me because I was losing 
     weight too.  I had my arm twisted into it.  I still remember how gross 
     that first Chicken McNugget tasted (if you are going to eat crap, 
     avoid fried processed crap).
     
     When I was 19, I tried again.  Having been to the doctor some months 
     prior and bringing up some of my complications, I was told I was 
     mildly hypoglycemic, and that I would have to eat very responsibly to 
     maintain a vegetarian diet without losing weight.  I started keeping a 
     journal, and tried to stay within 2300-2800 calories (recommended for 
     my big dumb ass by my new doctor to maintain) and eat a well rounded 
     diet (best success I had was a home mod I did to Dr. Hass' eat to win 
     program with the words Tofu/BeanSalsaBurrito/Gluten substituting 
     Fish/Chicken).  I still lost weight.  At 155 pounds, I had to start 
     eating chicken or fish every couple dinners.
     
     I'm at 180, my target weight for healthy trancing now (5 yers later), 
     and I feel pretty swell.  I don't like red meat, and rarely eat it.  I 
     do eat white meat a couple times a week.  I still take vitamins and 
     maintain all other aspects of my lifestyle in a somewhat healthy 
     fashion.
     
     I feel empathy towards all living things, and sometimes have trouble 
     drawing the line between what is mine to consume, mine to share, and 
     mine to observe.  I have pet names for the cows (well, some of them 
     are cooler than others) I politely ask out of the way as I mountain 
     bike through Grant Ranch.  I respect vegetarians greatly, as I do 
     anyone who pursues a way of life that pursues ideals similar to mine 
     more vehemently than I do.
     
     Americans and most westerners in general eat too much meat, 
     particularly red meat.  I cut down my meat intake, and I'm healthier 
     for it.  I do not feel consistently healthy as a vegetarian, and my 
     doctor and I have attributed weight loss, headaches (blood sugar 
     related), and some stomach problems to the periods when I abstained 
     from meat altogether.  Maybe it's not for everybody.
     
     Fact:
     If I dug up a human, and looked at it's jaw, I would call it a 
     omnivore (based on the presence of choppers, rippers and mashers).
     
     Fact:
     You can be entirely healthy without eating meat.
     
     Fact:
     You can be entirely healthy and eat meat.
     
     Fact:
     I did experience a sense of being 'lighter' (less weighed down, 
     physically and morally) after about two weeks without meat.  It does 
     feel good.
     
     I feel like I can eat less 'regularly' when I eat omnivorously.  This 
     allows flexibilty like missing a meal without irritability or feeling 
     faint or headaches.
     
     As I alluded before, I'm not at odds with vegetarians, I'm just trying 
     to figure out a way for it to fit in my life.  I don't eat meat at 
     every meal, but I do eat it occasionally.  For anybody who is doing it 
     for diet reasons, phase it out of your diet gradually so you don't 
     'crave' it.
     
     Less meat is better than Joe average.  Michal, if you find it 
     difficult, don't take on the cold turkey approach of... well, I fucked 
     up so I might as well catch up on all those cheeseburgers I missed.  
     Take your time.  Listen to what your body wants.  Greens and rice and 
     beans ARE REALLY GOOD FOR YOU.  Spicy tofu kicked ass when I was veg 
     AND STILL DOES.
     
     Just trying to maintain a non commital wishy washy stance while 
     justifying my existence at the expense of other living things...
     Andy W
     
     P.S.       If anybody cares to dispute this, please do so personally.  
     I would be happy to try anything new that might help me with this with 
     an open heart and open mind.

having been a vegetarian for 20 years, i totally agree with you on this one. 
the only difference i have noticed when eating lots of protein in contrast 
to very litlle is that it was next to impossible to gain muscle bulk,
although my muscle strength increased normally. surprise surprise. none there.

Hey, all, please don't think my "suck" post was a pathetic attempt at
currying sympathy.  You all should know me better than that.  I just feel
like sh*t because part of my FnF review was grossly misinterpreted.  People
need to realize that there's usually no need to read anything into what I
say; I try to get my point across clearly.  My motives are honest and
beyond question.  And here I go again, apologizing for something that I
shouldn't have to.  I just love you all, and I care about you, and every
moment of personal exchange on any level is precious to me.
Thanks to everyone who was kind to me today, because I'm hurting, and I can
really use that positivity.
Sorry for misspelling "awful."  It's not like me to commit spelling errors ;)
I now return you to your regularly scheduled chaos.

Peace (please?),

Eric

Greetings everyone.
OK I need to apologize firstly, for the gardening club room we tried to do
at Funky Techno Tribe a few months ago. Are position in the party was
merely as hired DJ's. We used "the gardening club" name because I got to
choose the line up in that room. We try & only work with people who are
reliable!(usually). Now I must admit it wasn't FTT's fault entirely that
the room never happened. Unfortunately the company doing the sound for that
room decided to show up at 11pm with only bass cabinets(no Highs). They
were from Sacramento which would have meant it would have taken them 3
hours to go and pick up the rest of the system and get back. Wicked offered
to do the system but things didn't pan out. I was as disappointed as anyone
about the situation. But I have been doing this long enough to realize
that, shit happens. I admit they should of dropped the price a bit when
this occurred but I had no say in that. Like I said earlier we have always
tried to bring you Quality music and DJ's for a reasonable price. We are
without a space at the moment so have to rely on doing the side rooms at
larger clubs to keep the gardening club around.
        Anyway now I have got that off my chest, the reason the apology
comes now is that I wanted to make sure that we had some thing to offer to
make up to the people who went . So here we go.

wow, I didnt think of it that way!...it is pretty random...i shoulda maybe
put a little background on my post...but sometimes I like to be
mysterious!... I was at fnf with 2 friends when we decided to put a cup on
the ground in traffic and see what happened...it was alot of fun! most
people side stepped it, but they didnt really notice the cup...even when
there was a huge crowd the cup would be missed 90% of the time, that is
until once it was knocked over once...no-one noticed it anymore... I feel
sorry for the guy that stepped on it the first time...CRUNCH... we all (a
few others had joined us living the life of a cup) we all went OHHHHHH!!!!
he looked so sad! he said he was sorry and apologised profusely! of course
it was ok...we were just a little heartbroken that our cup was squashed!

i just wanted to comment on this one sentence ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ actually
chimpanzees are omnivorous too .. and THEY haven't become human :) an
interesting thing to note about chimp society however is that usually
there is NO sharing of food - everyone grabs and eats what they can. 
EXCEPT when they kill a monkey to eat.  then the meat is shared among all
the members of the group ... which leads me (IMHO) to believe that
meat-eating began as a strictly ritual practice and then we got a taste
for it.

(From Nancy)

What's smaller than a breadbasket, more expensive than a Friends and 
Family ticket, and is an absolute necessity for any self-respecting raver??

Mixtapes.  And lots of them.

Unfortunately, though, at $15 a pop, most of us cannot afford them (we 
save that kind of money for illicit chemical compounds!).

So, I was thinking about community, and collectivism, and hit upon what 
(I hope) is a great idea...

The SFRaves DJ Mixtape Collective!!

The idea is this: many of us have a few mixtapes, and would like more.  
So, if you all think this will work, I thought we could post our 
collections, and make copies and trade with each other!

I will be the first!  (But first, a caveat - my collection is quite 
small, and doesn't totally reflect my favorite music or dj's).  Smiley 
faces denote the tapes I most highly recommend.


DJ Crust   Bootleg #2		crowd-pleasing happy trance	:)
	   Dreamline		deep, heavenly, energetic trance:):)
Dutch	   Funky Void		flowing trance			:)
	   Burning Chrome	harder-edge trance, Detroit-ish 
Jeno	   Soul Creation	progressive house for the softies out there
Myster-e   The Sirius Mystery	new, haven't really listened yet


I would adore anything by Ethan, Jon Carel, and the more breakbeat stuff 
by Dan.

** Also, if it exists, Ethan's set at midnight, New Year's Eve 96 at 
Begin Again, Dan's set from Spundae Memorial Day weekend (for those of 
you who were downstairs at 1015 that night, you remember this!!!).

Hope hope for tapes from the lastest FnF!!  Especially Alex, Jon and Ethan!!

P.S.  It is an absolute crime that Saturday night at the Light Campout 
wasn't taped.  That night rocked unbelievably.


Hope our Collective brings all of us much more music!!

I think that a healthy body and mind have a lot to do with raving.  In my 
opinion, being a vegetarian can only facilitate both of these things.  
Also, doing your own part to try to cut down on some of the cruelty and 
polution in the world doesn't completely go against the grain of what 
raving has come to mean to me, either.  I am by no means a militant veg, 
but it was great for me to see a post from someone talking about becoming 
a veg and all the people on the list supporting and helping him with his 
decision.  *IMHO* it has a lot more to do with raving than some things I 
see come across this screen.

Hi everyone!

I just found out that my fall teaching gig  fell through.  So
now I'm looking for something fun and part-time to do while I'm taking a
couple of c.s. classes at Berkeley.

Fun for me equals working with/for good people, doing just about anything.
(Except phone solicitations, yuk!).  I can do the standard clerical
tasks, plus lots more.

If you know of anybody looking for part-time help in the East Bay, please
let me know!

See you,

Ann

Hi again!!

Just wanted to make a note and advise that all you take Friday off from work,
or from whatever you have to do.  

A bunch of my friends and I are going to Santa Cruz for the day to hang out
in the sunshine and thought some of you would like to join us.

Nothing special, just a fun day by the beach.

We're going to be by the lighthouse, where the drum circle used to be on
Sundays.

Come out and join us!!!!

Hope to see (and meet) you there!!!

Peace, love, happiness.........and all that good stuff

Karen

did anyone catch sfraves own capt. crunch on art bell's show (560 am,
www.artbell.com) last night? it was pretty cool, I listened from midnight
til around 1:30 and then I started to doze off. Most of the interview
focused on crunch's former life as a, um, telecommunications expert :)
People were calling in from all over the country to talk to the legendary
capt. crunch....

RIGHT ON!
Killing animals and then EATING them is really, really BAD KARMA!
I've been vegetarian for about 4 years now. It does get a little boring
around lunch time since the deli near my work's only vegitarian item is a
cheese sandwich.

You might want to take an iron and vitamin B complex supplement.
There are plenty of other vegetarian things you can eat to get your protien.

No you wont. Just think where it comes from. There was an article in Details
magazine a few months back about what goes on in the slaughterhouse that you
might want to read.

I for one would like to go on record as discouraging the formation of a
large collective of copying DJ mix tapes that are currently for sale...

My reason is that it costs to produce and distribute these tapes and
DJ's make very little money back on them as it is... it's been my
experience that a lot of them are given to friends & promoters anyway...
SO I'm saying scrounge a bit, dig deeper and support your local DJ
favorites with the extra cash....

 I feel it's fine to copy tapes that are out of production or were not
released for sale btw... like someone's dat made at a party....

 I would be more in support of the pass around and copy if some way was
implimented to make sure that some $$ support made it to the DJ's via
collections  etc. but I still suspect that the stores selling the tapes
also need every $ they can get...

 Someone can correct me if I'm off base here - but this is my immediate
impulse....

hmm.. your body actually synthesizes protein from fats and carbohydrates if
it's in defecit. the protein thing is really just a myth. i got up to a nice
six foot never eating meat, my sister is about 5'10" after the same diet.
and muscle strength/effeciency aren't really related to protien consumption
in the extent that muscle bulk is. those guys in the olypics certainly
aren't superhuge bodybuilders, but they can lift a hell of a lot. 

>back to the trees.  We have become humans because we were omnivorous.  Who
sure, maybe eating meat helped humans discover clubs and weapons (and what a
wonderful contribution they are), but the invention of agriculture is what
fueled the development of towns, and with them the arts and sciences, and
everything else that our world is built on today. if anything, meat
consumption may have contributed to the aggressive nature of humanity,
herbavores being pretty docile in general, etc..

i'd add tapes that can't be obtained around SF, and couldn't otherwise be
bought. such as my mixtapes i have from back east. i know no one will be
able to buy them here, so i feel no qualms about copying them for friends,
as it even might help the dj with name recognition should they come out to
the west coast to play a couple parties.

heh. couple little anecdotes.
 i went into the meat freezer at the safeway i work at the other day, and
there was this huge garbage can full of chopped up, bloody meat bits. pretty
disgusting, i'm glad i don't eat that stuff.  (hmm, back to the hot dog
factory? <grin>)

another safeway one: i'm bagging someone's groceries, and this packaged meat
comes through that looks like the cow was just slaughtered, because the
package was _full_ of blood and leaking all over the place. the lady asks me
to please not loose any blood, by putting it in a bag all by itself. eeyuck.
ok, vampira.

my dad is doing a landscaping job at a chicken joint. walks into the back,
and is confronted with a huge pile of warm chickens lying on the counter.
flys buzzing all around, and some guy drops one onto the really dirty floor
and just throws it into the oven. mmmmm.. yummy.

my grade 12 biology class: we're disecting various animals. i, of course,
play with the animals like they were still living, and make numerous food
cracks. oddly enough, no one can eat their lunch after the class except me.
what? bad conscience?? ;)

right situation comes up I could wait a few weeks).

I'm responsible, employed, and can pay up to $800/mo., and would prefer to
live with males (I'm male myself) in a nice neighborhood.

Email me if you know of something... :-)

Hey...I just wrote to Brian B.asking him about having a mixtape area.  Other
lists around the country do, and I suspect that this question of copywrite
and $$$money for the Dj's is the thorn which keeps this from happening.
First of all (most) of the Dj's aren't paying a royalty to the makers of the
records they are buying...So I hate this sanctimonious whimpering about
copywrite. This is the underground remember???? I have purchased has many
tapes as I have copied (about 150)  I also buy records (about 300 hundred)
and have spent I don't know how much going to parties during the last four
years....I remind you to look at the tapes you've purchased...Most say "For
Promtional Purposes Only"--What trading tapes is about is promoting this
music and promoting the dj.  I have often traded for the tape of a dj I
haven't heard...then, loved the tape, then, went out to hear that dj; Mark
Farina, Doran,and John Howard to name a few, and I'll bet the same is true
for you. It's also true the Dj doesn't buy the records solely to make a
tape.  The records are purchased, played at parties, where the Dj's real
income comes from..Anything else is gravy...not to mention that they get
significant breaks in buying records over the amateur,like myself, who is
just playing at home or for free.

  The day it becomes about copywrite and money, and Sony and BMI...the scene
is in serious trouble. The short half-life of Rock'n Roll epitomized by
Elvis, is enough said here. In the end, there is no putting the Genie, back
in the bottle.
Dj's will make tapes, people will buy some, and tape others.  TApes which
particularly move me, I buy because I want a better recording or I want the
graphics on the box. I the more music you buy, or buy records, or buy
tickets to a party ultimately ends up contributing to the music. In the
Olympic spirit, i say, "let the trading begin."

I know all my veggie friends are going to hate me for this but, I feel that if the human 
body is built for omnivorous eating why try to limit it to just herbervorous activities? 
Not many animals in the world get to get the best of both worlds of eating, so why enjoy 
it? 

Also, nobody in my house would try to support me when I wanted to try to be a 
vegetarian.

Yah, I think you're right.  But, do all mix tapes cost $15 I am new, havn't
bought one yet)?  That's a rip off!  Of us AND the DJ! If the DJ only get's a
small cut, then where do the $ go to?  Probably not the record store!  Indie.
tapes of local _bands_ don't go for that much!  And they have to pay
recording studios and stuff to get it made!  Just my .02

SO I'm saying scrounge a bit, dig deeper and support your local DJ

 I feel it's fine to copy tapes that are out of production or were not

 I would be more in support of the pass around and copy if some way was

 Someone can correct me if I'm off base here - but this is my immediate

In a message dated 96-07-30 12:37:47 EDT, you write:

<< 
 [Dang - I composed & sent this message to your old
 address, then paged down through my in-box & found
 your messages, giving your NEW address....sorry to
 clutter up your mom's mailbox....hope she doesn't mind!]
 
 R>>

A.O.K., my friend!

 <<______________________________
 
 Thanks so much for your message.  I was really
 interested in reading your comments - I often find myself
 thinking similar things in little bursts so it feels
 really good to see it all laid out at once.
 
 You said in the P.S. that you've used this discussion
 to help you define things for yourself - this makes me
 excited!  The process of setting things out in words
 is so important to me - often I think that I know how
 I feel about something, but when I decide to sit down
 & talk or write about it in detail, so much more comes
 out, especially in terms of making myself refine and
 reconsider my own definitions.....>>

Ahh! An open mind!  So hard to find/maintain!  Keep on reconsidering!  This
get's complicated, though, because you never know where you stand.  But I
guess searching is better than standing when you don't know where you stand,
or just assume you know!

<< Sometimes I get caught up in my own monologues, and
 feel like I can see into the whole system of how society's
 been set up (American society, at least, I have no
 experience with others) and what I see is really ugly,
 and it feels like a trap I can't escape from...so all
 the logic I see behind it adds up to nothing but a
 sort of twisted, hurting feeling.  This feeling seems
 to perpetuate itself, and I get sad, and wonder why
 my thoughts about these things even matter, since I cannot move
 them into action, outside myself...>>

I feel this way often myself.  But keep in contact with people like us, here
and elsewhere, and the feeling doesn' last long!  This list is breathing new
life in to my soul;  seeing all the happy people out to make a diff. really
touches you when you let it!  Especially because there are folx here who are
actually interested in working for change, not just noticing the problem.
Keep in contact on this point.  We all need your ideas about what can be
done!  Oh, and check out my x-favorite web site (now it's hyperreals culture
archives--including this list!!!!) if you want to sink in those feelings of
pointlessness...http://www.angst.org/.  I take it all 1/2 heartedly, but they
do touch something dark which most won't admit about life.
 
 <<Where is the place for idealism in this?  I try to shape
 my own life as best I can, but is this "enough" ?  And
 what would "enough" be, anyway?  [This concept itself seems
 to be a consumer/marketplace creation....]>>

Idealism IMHO should piont almost only at self.  Live your own ideal, cuz you
have the best chance of achieving that.  Being ideal about society helps, but
you can only really change yourself.  Which leads me to education.  Education
is another idealist-prone area that needs to be handled carefully.  Idealism
here turns people off, especially when they don't agree.  Position yourself
so that the uneducated know that you are willing to change your mind if they
say something that makes _you_ see the light.  This allows them to feel the
same way.  I have found that people will never change their views in front of
you(something I actively try not to do, and OFTEN fail!).  They will fight
forever on their piece of ground, even when they know you are possibly right.
 Then, if you don't push it and they leave the conversation on a posative
note, they may apply what they heard in their next interaction.  People like
to be right, don't like to be wrong.  So if you make them doubt themselves,
then they will attach to that feeling and use the info that made them feel so
to make themselves stronger in the next argument.  Or they ignore you.  

<<Sometimes I spend so much time just thinking, thinking, thinking
 and the things I think about still seem to slip through
 my hands....>>

WRITE THEM TO ME!!! I am a flake, but I'll try to respond every time if I
can!
 
<< Eeek! As I'm writing this, I find myself thinking that
 there is absolutely no way I can send it to you - I don't know you;
 this rant seems really juvenile compared to your specific
 words about specific problems; you may not care or know
 what to respond to what I'm saying; etc., etc., etc....
 
 But that is not in the spirit of the message you just
 sent - and that is not true to the feelings that made
 me respond.>>
 
  You fight laziness (not sending it would be easy) AND  you have, IMHO the
right attitude!  Fuck'em if they put you down.  That's not why you put your
ideas foreward, you do it to test the ideas.  Any idea is worth putting to
the flame test, and if they hit you hard with words, well, look hard at WHY!
You may even find yourself wrong.  If more people knew this, fewer people
would hit so hard, and more things would change.

<< I guess I just simply want to thank you for
 working through your own definitions so publicly.
 There are so many slogans out there - vampiricly
 sucking meaning out of words, feelings, ideas....
 "just do it,"  "no fear"...it makes me feel hollow,
 if I don't make the effort to determine what's
 real and what's not real, for MYSELF, one thought
 at a time....>>

Thank you, and thank "Bob" you can see the reasons for your feelings of
hollowness.  I think the general public also feels those emptinesses, but
they think the slogans and products associated with them are what will fix
them!  They _believe_ the hype!
 
 <<What you've said is true, and it's so good to see it out there.>>

Thank you soooo much!!  I have _much_ respect for you breaking your own mold
and studying yourself!  I know I have a long way to go to be the person I
can/want to be, I had a serious depression/denial phase I am just starting to
climb out of!  Getting dumped and seriously disrespected (even after I
forgave) by my former best friend/ girlfriend of YEARS showed me that slump I
was in.  The catylist for change, however has been RAVES!!!, this list being
key in my rave life (I've been too broke to go out for like the last 2
weeks...and I live 1-1.5hrs from the bay, so just getting to free parties
costs.
 
 <<Take care,
 Rhea

I will, but only if you will!!!

Encuraging/edly yours,

I had this idea before, and I am totally down for it...the only reason
that I didnt pursue it too far was because I was worried that some of our
family get by by selling mix tapes...also, 2nd and 3rd generation tapes 
might be fine for the grateful dead or phish...but I dont think that is 
quite the quality to listen to house/techno whatever on...but I havent
actually heard any dj's actually say that...so what do you guys think...

I have 2nd gen 5 tape set of goa gil
christopher lawrence (willard)
christopher lawrence summer 95
a bunch of 2-3rd generation anonymous mix tapes from florida
and a pretty sizeable cd collection that I would be happy to record in
exchange for mixtapes ( planet dog, carl cox, orb, children of the bong,
eat static, moby, chill out or die 1, 2, 3 etc... if the idea takes off
ill send a complete listing to intereested peoples!)

wicked in berkeley charges $20 for a mix tape...a FU***NG rip if you ask
me...but that store is too cool for me anyways :-)

has anyone seen the acid something or other mixtape thing that they have
in LA?...it was at organic and I thought it was the coolest thing...lots
of mixtapes for reasonable prices...why dont we build a collective where
we sell the tapes at parties for reasonable prices or something like
that?... just a thought...

Most cost around $15.  A lot of stores take the tapes on consignment, so
stores get a lot of money as well.  I don't know about big name DJ's like
Dan or Jeno.  I don't know how they get paid for tapes?  Does anybody else
know?  My friend told me that Dan gets mucho dinero every week from his mix
tape sales.  I know that hip hop tapes go for less because the records are
less expensive to buy.

What can I say -- it was a great party, a *rave*.  Music, decorations,
visuals (can't say enough for what Michael and the others were doing
with that!), lights, people, awesome.  And then a rainbow in the morning --
not even the Oregon Country Fair can top that.  

It was especially great to hear Joe spin a solid two-hour house set.
For those of us who came into this scene when it really was "house
music all night long," this was a special treat.  I hope we keep
expanding the variety without losing any of the great sounds that have
brought us here.

It was definitely worth the effort to make the trip (you don't even want
to know!) . . .

Thanks to all once again.  We do the best damn $5 parties in the known
universe . . .

Dear All;

        Just saw Trainspotting, very cool movie definitely worth seeing at a
movie theater. I recommend the AMC Kubuki 8, it' a really nice place
complete with arcade, clean modern bathrooms, parking, a snack bar & coffee
shop(pastries, express o, ...etc), nice roomy comfortable seats, cup
holders, and big screens.

        The movie is very real to life as far as the drug stuff goes, how it
portrays life in Scotland for these characters, and the brief view of the
rave scene.

        Though my recent bout with H wasn't administered via IV, though I
have done it that way many years ago. I can speak from personal experience
when I say that the drug stuff; especially the IV/Heroin stuff is so real
that it provoked an emotional reaction from me. God, I'm still kind of
reeling from it, all those needles, the visual appearance of the fake
Heroin, the things the characters say about the drug, the withdraw scene(a
little over-exaggerated/stretching the truth), the characters themselves,
...etc; are all relativity true & accurate; with the obvious exception of
the characters themselves. Though I'm sure that the author drew on people
from his real life, as they were very believable. I'm sure you or someone
you know could say, hey I knew someone like that.

        I strongly related to three of the characters; the 1st being the
main character, then Spud, and the one adult character who died. It had
ending which left me satisfied and feeling good, as well as one which was
believable. In other words you could almost see it as a true story.

        Make sure you see it whether it be in the movies or on video, though
not an Academy Award Winner, not exciting, it was an extremely interesting,
fun film with excellent characters, that reflects our times, and it's peoples.

Peace
Brian

I'm going to have to agree alittle with Mike Clay. As someone that will
soon be playing out as a DJ. Records get expensive. I often will spend
about $50-$60 on 4 maybe 5 records which sometimes there might only be 1
track on there that I like. Alot of times too DJ's will spin at a party for
free.  I'm all up for getting mixtapes out to whoever wants them, but that
should be up to the DJ who get them for free.  Some DJs might not care if
people get there mixtapes for free. That way if people like them, they will
goto an event that there spinning at and hopefully the DJ get's paid.

If there is going to be a mixtape swapping thing, maybe there should be a
list of DJs that do not care if people copy or get there mixtapes for free.
There might even be a list of certain mixed tape that DJ will give out and
some the might want to charge for. The price for an average cassette of
good music is not asking to much. Some DJ's don't even let people record
them at a party. They make there own tapes.

Just remember some DJs might only be a DJ and not have any other job and
depend on the DJ spot at parties and the sales of their mixed tapes. You
can't always assume they have another job. If you want to swap tapes then
maybe ask for Demo tapes. Those are usually the ones that get handed out
for free. You might even offer to give them a blank tape or even $5 bucks
so they can get more tapes.

My $.02 worth

Just for info there are many DJ's that spin for free, FnF DJs, Sunset DJs.
Yes some of those DJs might get slots that do pay, but not all the time. If
they play out of town then the might only charge enough for there trip and
a place to stay. So if it wasn't for the DJs then there wouldn't be mixed
tape to begin with. So why not support them.

The only problem I have with this "buzzword" is the way it ends up being 
applied in our society... it means to MOST people I'll eat a meat based
diet with a few other things thrown in... that's where the environmental 
problems (meat production) and health problems(heart disease, cancer etc)
begin....

For the record: an omnivorous diet I would support is say a Thai or Chinese
meal - lots of veggies, noodles etc. with some chicken broth and small
chunks of meat added.....

What the average Joe America means is: 2 Large Hamburgers with Fries and
a coke... lots of veggies there for balance... " ketchep's a vegatable
isn't it?" ;-)

Ok ok since it has come up.... (stepping up to soapbox)....

  Many on this list love music & software AND have no particular desire
to fuel "big business" in America (ala Nike etc.)... others note that
DJ's don't observe copyrights when they play records out and even a
"noted" visual artist has been known to show a tape or two with "NOT
FOR PUBLIC PERFORMANCE" plastered all over the box AHEM..... But if
I "shared my income" with them - they'd have to pay me ;-)


  My take on this is 1) we're all a "den of thieves" and 2) it's become so
common to steal income producing property that we do it without guilt and
usually without thinking.... BUT someday if YOU become the artist that
everyone is stealing from YOU WILL NOTICE BIGTIME... it's all a matter of
whose  income is being pilfered theirs (that's fine) or YOURs (Hey wait
a minute!).....

  Now since we've established our guilt as thieves why not act as "Robin
Hood" I always say.... that is steal from the rich BUT give to the poor..

  So whenever I steal ahem "copy" a tape, software, or video (ok ok I'm
a thief too) I ask myself am I "Robin Hood" or simply a robber baron?

In the case of software: if I pirate from Microsoft or Adobe I'm living
off the big corporation and the lost to them won't be great... some  would
say they "owe some pro bono" stuff  to society anyway... Robin Hood...
If I steal from a small  garage based say music software company that's
struggling to get by... NOT Robin Hood... I've become the robber baron...

  So if you copy one of Sony's tapes it's stealing but at least it's from
a LARGE corporation that can take the loss....  but if you copy a small
DJ's tape... YOU might even make more than they do and stealing from the
small guys is NOT in the grand tradition of the "noble thief"....

 So as I always tell my Intro Computer classes... as you copy that floppy
or tape etc... ask yourself 1)  am I stealing something of (market)value? If
tape software etc. is out of production ie not being sold anyway NO go
ahead copy away - no foul.... 2) If it is of market value: big guy or
little guy? If the owner is a really big guy... understand it is stealing
BUT ok I'm Robin Hood.... HOWEVER if the owner is a really little guy
struggling to get by ALWAYS buy from them....

 AND NO: small recording operations and stores can't always compete with
Tower on cost and make all tapes cost $8... they aren't moving enough
quantity....

 Until we get it... THAT WE MUST (as in HAVE TO!!!) SUPPORT THE LITTLE
GUYS the ONLY other way to do business in AMerica will be BIG (as in
MEGA corporation)... and you all *** know*** where that leads......

End of today's lesson

okay, just a quick little question.  This isn't really meant to be taken too seriously
but it is a possibility. :)

Some one said killing animals and eating them is bad Karma, and a lot of you seem
to feel sorry for the animals.  Now me being the meat eater that I am and having the
vegetarian girlfriend that I do, I have thought about this a little.

What about killing the poor innocent plants??  Could they not in some way that we
don't understand have feelings too.  Just because we can't communicate with them in
any way doesn't mean they do not feel pain.

just a thought.   :)

What you say IS TRUE.... but we can't hear the tiny plant screams... We
can measure them with electronic measuring equipment however...

Advanced Masters often move to the level of conciousness where they will
not eat anything that means the death of the living thing involved....
That is they will eat fruit that falls from a tree or milk from an
animal or unfertalized eggs... but they will not kill an animal or even
an ENTIRE plant to eat it.... chosing instead to eat only small parts
of plants such as fruit, seeds etc that can be taken without killing
the plant....

That is where this concept of karma and conciousness about killing eventually
leads but most of us are not there YET ;-)

Ahhh,  I begin to understand.  I still don't know that a lot of vegetarians look at 
it that way though.  I still see most of them worrying about them worrying about the
animals, but not thinking about the plants.  Maybe I'm wrong though.

Hear Hear!
 There was a great Bloom County series a few years back in which Binkley   
becomes gradually increasingly enlightened, and begins to change all his   
habits to prevent killing.  He quits meat, then he quits using any   
leather products, then he realizes that by walking around he crushes   
countless innocent insects, and soon he winds up hanging from a tree by a   
rope with a bandana over his face to avoid inhaling and killing innocent   
bacteria in the air.
 I think this issue, like so many, has no absolute answer; we all fall   
somewhere on a continuum of what's an acceptable level of sacrifice and   
inconvenience.  Everyone, to survive, exploits the environment to some   
degree.  Happily, it seems like most vegetarians view their choice as a   
personal choice, and don't condemn the carnivores of the world.  This   
makes me very happy.

I should add that I commend and support the vegetarians out there; it's   
not an easy change to make, and if you have the will, more power to you.

Good point!!  Studies show that certain plants grow differently to
different types of music. Also what about the Venus fly trap, it's a meat
eater. How does it know when something is in it's trap? It can sence it. It
knows it's there. So, they have some kind of feelings too.

Not defending either side...I was  a Veggie person for 3 years, I eat both
now..just expression an opinion and a thoought.

Yo was up?

Had to step to the bathroom, did I miss anything?  Any good parties happen
this weekend?  I figured it was a good weekend to take off because the
calandar was a little light on fun happenings.  I decided to stay home and
add to my giant ball of lint.  I should be in Guiness within a a year or
two at this rate.  Only problem is, I seem to have lost my kitten...;^)

______________________
Oops, there I go spewing sarcasm again...sorry!
______________________

Believe it or not I actually had a rockin' time and I didn't go to FnF.  I
was on a houseboat trip on Lake Shasta and it was a blast.  This is the
third year of putting together this trip and while slightly stressful
trying to keep track of 21 fucked up people, it's quite enjoyable.

In fact, Saturday night while most of you were partying at FnF, I was
creating a little sub-FnF-party on Lake Shasta with all the required
ingredients.  I threw in a live tape of Ethan (Mad, 2/12/96) and that got
everyone rocking.  I put up a green pin-spot behind everyone and they were
all tripping on their dancing shadows on the shore.  As the energy peaked I
sat down and literally focused all my energy to the FnF party.  At least
one or two people responded back.  Actually, I believe I over shot FnF,
because I started picking up weird vibes from India; I think Bill and Gaby
must have been channeling too.  ;^)

There were liberal servings of nudity, music, and general debauchery on
this trip.  And while I kind of lamented missing the party(s) here
(FnF/Theta), I knew it wouldn't get me down.  In a way, we were all kind of
partying together, even if I didn't get to stand in line to hug Ethan.  ;^)

I look forward to seeing the pictures though...

Peace!

Tony

I agree with you completely.  My girlfriend doesn't care that I eat meat.  She
jokes with me about it but that goes both ways.  Though she does feel that people that
eat meat should go out, kill the animal, prepare it themselves and then see if they
really want to eat it.  There are probably a lot of people that wouldn't want to do
that.

If this is fine with the DJ's I would be into trading tapes as well.
Unfortunately I have little to offer in the way in any DJed
mixtapes...except for one by a starting out DJ who I think is really
pretty good.  And Return To The Source (the chakra journey)but you can get
that on CD.  I thought I had some mixtapes from DB (a dj in NYC...heard of
him?  he was great when i heard him a few years ago) but they seem to have
dissappeared :^( 
I do have about 200hrs of Dead, and some Janis, My Bloody Valentine,
Spiritualized, Jane's, Mr. Bungle, Bob Marley, Phish...if any of you 
would dig some of this stuff, I'd be happy to trade for your favorites. 
Partial to trance, but open to anything.

was anyone out here at Furthur last night (an unlikely place to ask
but ya never know)?  YEEEEEEEEEHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
:^) %^) :oD

ok...last thing and then i'll shut up for a while i promise:

on the VEG topic:  I've been vegetarian all my life, and I have a LOT of
respect for those of you who started out nonveg who have switched to veg
on your own.  I think that must take a lot of clear thinking and
willpower.  Since I've been vegetarian since birth, I never understand
people who say you can't get good tasting food or nutrition if you are
vegetarian.  Of course I eat and cook lots of Indian food.  
If any of you want some good vegetarian Indian food recipes 
I can share them with you, or reccommend a great cookbook.

actually, one of the big things that changed my mind was a book I saw a few
weeks ago... I don't remember the author but it was called "dead meat" and
was a book of charcoal/pastel drawings of different aspects of the meat
industry. Very sickening. Obviously the author had a total veg agenda and
altered the reality of events to further her own ideas (I gotta keep it in
perspective), but it was still pretty intense.

Well, where do you draw the line between "knowing" something and "reacting"
to it? A moustrap springs shut when a mouse steps in, but no one in their
right mind would try to defend mousetraps from slavery and exploitation...
IMO, the venus trap just has a more complex mechanism. I also think animals
and even human operate this way to a certain extent... our brains our so
complex that we actually think we're conscious... ;)

And scientists have measured electical impulses in Venus flytraps when the hairs
inside the trap are brushed (which causes the trap to close).  A primitive
nervous system??  I don't haven't come to any conclusions on how I feel about
plants regarding their "feelings", etc., but I find the question intriguing, as
I do the question of eating meat.

PS: I won't jump into the debate, though it's a good one, involving anatomy (hey
vegans! Don't forget to mention human gastro-intesinal systems!!),
religion, philosophy, history, anthropology, etc., except to say that (most :)
meat-eating humans are not carnivores, an easy and evil-sounding word many
herbivores like to use.

Well, I enjoy a certain amount of meat in my diet, but I've found
a way around the moral issue by sticking to animals that have died
from natural or accidental causes.  Roadkill, (under 12 hours fresh)
can be very good if properly spiced.  And you can gather up all those 
flies on the windowsill for a crunchy snack. 

In the future, we will be able to genetically engineer animals to
have the innate *desire* to be eaten (ref: Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy).  Until then, all we can do is feel sorry.  Considering 
the current use of pesticides in agriculture, I don't think
most vegetarians have a very strong moral basis for their diet.

Subject: moderation in all things, even meat and veggies
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

hello all-

i shall give my humble opinion on vegetarianism.

the best lesson i learned from a wise old man (my dad) was "moderation in
all things".  this lesson, combined with my personal philosophy, causes me
to believe that there is no substance nor action that, when in the proper
proportions, is inherently bad. (insert your flame here!)

when i think about that in terms of eating, i come to the following
conclusion for me: being vegetarian, for me, is not moderate.  it says to me
that "there are some types of food that are bad in some way, regardless of
their proportion."  i cannot agree with that statement.  yes, vegetarianism
may be fine for some people, but it does not work for me.

i make my best attempt to not be excessive (difficult as that is, especially
at a good rave) and choosing to sytematically exclude one food to the
inclusion of another does not work with my personal philosophy.  i choose to
eat all types of foods and be healthy with all of them.

i think it is a little odd that humans feel they can escape the food chain.
i eat other organisms.  when i die, another organism will eat me (i refuse
to be buried in a coffin.  i will be buried at sea, where my tissue may be
recycled).
i may die tomorrow, having been eaten by some animal while i am in the
wilderness.  being part of the life cycle and the food chain, i am fine with
that.  just as humans are able to systematically kill animals to eat them,
other animals are able to kill humans and eat them.  organisms are made to
eat each other.

ok, now all you vegetarians, please don't flame me too hard, for i respect
your decision to eat exclusively non-meat products.  i just need to speak my
piece.

love to you all (may you be eaten and enjoy it!)-

Personally, I think $15 is a lot for a tape, but that seems to be the going
rate at stores. Even if the DJ wants to charge less, often the stores will
push for $15 so all the tapes cost the same...

There are other ways of distribution, however (ie the FnF website) and
speaking for myself, if someone asks me for a tape at a party and I happen
to have one on me I'll give it to them. I also don't particularly care if
anybody copies my tapes. I love to hear stories of where the copies have
travelled.

A Venus Fly trap has little thingies in his mouth or trap (whatever you
call it) that closes when it feels something in there, it then spits out
some kind of juice stuff that drains the life out of a fly and it sucks it
dry. Then takes that fly juice and consumes it into itself. The fly dies
slow and probally painful too. I've notice if you put something else like
for example a small metal object, it my close on it but it doesn't do
anything to it.  How does it know the difference.

Again, I'm not taking sides. I recently saw a bunch of Venus flytraps and
they got me thinking about alot of things about plant having feelings or
not. Take an animal or human, you cut an arm or leg off it doesn't grow
back (some reptiles do, so disregard those) and it hurts them. Well tree
get there limbs cut and if you treat it like a wound and put tar or
something on it, it won't grow back. Sometimes it will even die because it
was hurt.  Some even bleed. There really isn't a safe why to make sure your
not hurting something whether it's plant or animal. Animals do cry out when
hurt, but we may not be able to hear the plant cry out.

The thing Mike brought up about some wait until fruit falls from a tree and
what not is probally the only safe assurance that you are not hurting
anything, plant or animal.

This can be just as bad as any other topic..ie..politics, religion..etc....
people have strong beliefs and we should respect them. As far me, I like
meat and veggies. I could probally do with out hamburgers, hot dogs,
chicken and pork because there are some really great veggie subsitutes out
there,  but steak and beef ribs for me are hard to leave behind now. I have
alot of respect for those that change to veggies and stay with it.

That's it for me on this matter. For one, I really don't want to get a
flame going and for two this can go on forever. So to those veggie people
and meat people out there please respect each other, you don't have to
agree, just respect there choice.

Last evening,  I get a page from this talk show host Art Bell (KSFO-560)
who wanted to have me be his guest on his radio show.   So,  just before
I head out to my favorite campsite up on Mt Tam,  I call him back.

He asked me to go to a quiet spot and call him back,  so I head up to
Pan Toll campground and phone him from there (Actually,  he called me
back).

The interview lasted 4 hours,  and 20 million people were listening to
his program on 300 radio stations all over the USA.

He took callers who asked me questions (primarily about phone hacking)
and I was given an opportunity to give out my URL....   Also,  during the
show,  Art Bell put up a link from his pages to mine.

The show was incedible.   AOL was knocked OFF_LINE due to the amount
of traffic it caused.   Sorry about that,   all you AO Smell users.

Ha Ha Ha!!   That was really a kick....   AOL shut down due to massive
amount of people getting onto Art's web site.

Of course,  the WELL handled this massive amount of traffic,  but my
Aux site at "vcomm.net" didn't fare so well..

Anyway,  the next day,  I didn't really get that much of an increase
in mail.... Perhaps about 60 more messages a day,  but WOW,  my web site
hit count went off the scale.

For instance,  the Forbes ASAP article increased my hit count to about
1200 hits/hour... Not that bad actually,   then it settled down to about
150 -200 hits/hour.

Today,  I check my stats...

Daily Access Statistics


Today, there have been a total of 24230 accesses by 2940 unique hosts to crunch.
The total traffic generated by this page was 176957 kilobytes of information.

There have been 2423 accesses per hour, and at this rate, crunch will get
58152 accesses today.

So,  just to let you all know...

Anyway,  nuff said,  lets change the subject back to raving,  see you all
at Crysilis...

WARNING: NON RAVE RELATED!!!

I found this extremely interesting, especially the last part.  

------------

July 30th, 1996 5:29PM EDT

PARIS (Reuter) - The world's major powers closed ranks to combat terrorism 
on Tuesday, urging other nations to join forces with them but side-stepping 
a row over U.S. demands for sanctions against what Washington calls 
"terrorist states".

Foreign and security ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations 
and Russia approved a list of 25 practical measures to defeat bombers who in 
separate recent incidents have attacked the Atlanta Olympics and tourist 
sites in northeastern Spain and may have downed a TWA Boeing 747 near New 
York's Kennedy International Airport.

(snip)

The package included pledges to reinforce police cooperation and training, 
share intelligence, ease extradition and legal assistance, dry up sources of 
funding and weapons and strengthen national anti-terrorism legislation.

The ministers also vowed to prevent extremists from using the Internet 
computer network to plan attacks and spread bomb-making instructions.

(snip)

-------------

What I find interesting about this is the concept that somehow the political 
bodies of the world will attempt to monitor the traffic on the 'net in a way 
that allows them to intercept and track the sources of specific information. 
 This just smacks of a Big Brother mentality, but one that, at least to me, 
is rather ludicrous.  How do they imagine they'll be able to prevent ANYONE 
from using the 'net for ANYTHING?  With encryption in it's many forms, an 
individual could easily put together a message that simply could not be 
deciphered in any appreciable amount of time by any government agency.  
What's the point?

The 'net has warped space and time.  Now everything, all information, all 
knowledge, all people, all places, are directly in front of you, accessible 
in seconds (minutes for some folks, hours if you're on AOL or Prodigy ;)).  
Borders in the physical world do not exist here.  Any border or limitation 
in this world is easily overcome by the next wave of hardware and software.

I commend the nation's leaders for their concern, but they need to deal with 
the real world and stop putting so much energy into grappling with a thing 
far beyond their understanding and more powerful than all of them put 
together.  They should control the substances used to make bombs rather than 
the information for making them.  It's still impossible to stop the terror, 
but they will have a better chance of stemming the flow of that stream than 
they would have drying up the ocean of 'net information, or slowing the 
expansion of a universe already in the throes of it's own virtual Big Bang 
by throwing bits of legislative paper at it.

moderation in *all* things?  no disrespect to your dad or anything but I
don't see the wisdom in this.

this assumes that you view animals as food (some people don't). 

say hypothetically you managed to get through life without ever eating
meat (as some list people have stated they have).  eating animals would
probably seem pretty barbaric and unneccessary.

I don't think vegetarians are trying to escape the food chain, as you put
it, I think they are re-evaluating how they fit into it.

think about the behavioral characteristics of animals that eat other
animals (typically predators), and then the animals that live on a
plant-based diet.  draw your own conclusions...

hopefully you won't take this as a flame (it isn't intended to be), it's
just my take on things.

Somebody sent me this I thought you all might get a kick out of it...

The real name of "the" Bill Gates is William Henry Gates III.
Nowadays he is known as Bill Gates (III).  By converting the letters of his
current name to the ASCII-values and adding his (III), you get the following:

           B       66
           I       73
           L       76
           L       76
           G       71
           A       65
           T       84
           E       69
           S       83
           I        1
           I        1
           I        1
            --------------
                  666 !!!

Some might ask, "How did Bill Gates get so powerful?"
Coincidence? Or just the beginning of mankind's ultimate and total
enslavement???

Before you decide, consider the following:

M  S  -  D  O  S     6  .  3  1

77+83+45+68+79+83+32+54+46+50+49 = 666

W  I  N  D  O  W  S  9  5

87+73+78+68+79+87+83+57+53+1 = 666


Coincidence? You decide...

Meat vs. Vegies hunh?

Well if you want to see a respectful way to kill something for the
benefit of you and yours, check out _The Gods Must Be Crazy_ where a
long apology and explanation is given before the actual killing (very
enlightening and entertaining movie on alot of levels).  Keep in mind
that life and death are a cycle and killing is not necessaily BAD.

What is necessarily bad is the way we raise/slaughter/process meat
for the most part as well as the way we grow/process fruits, vegies,
etc...

What is necessarily bad are most peoples dietary habits (mine
included)--vegetarians tend to be better at this because they have gone
out and sought information on the subject rather than help maintain the
status quo but I know meat eaters who eat very healthfuly and
vegetarians who don't.

Also, how much does what our bodies have gotten used to over a lifetime
influence what our bodies can adjust to?

And just to fan the flames a little, what about enslaving and
improsoning animals?  How many people think locking up a horse so we
can have fun riding on it's back or attaching a till to an oxen is
okay?  Sure we take care of those animals, provide for them but then
don't we do the same for those in our prisons--which is supposed to be
a punishment?  How many pet owners out there?  I do have a cat that
lives with me but he's free to do as he pleases--a permanently open
door and I think he gets the better part of the deal anyway.  Of course
I did forceably relocate him a year ago, but we discussed it and he
agreed, though he bitched the whole way.

Oh yeah, rave-related?  Isn't everything?

I think there's something in DJ mixtapes that go beyond the records that are

Of course there are exceptions like peace, love etc. but in general being
moderate about most things seems like a good thing to me. But then again
pointing out all exceptions would make teaching lessons in life very
cumbersome.

But then again most of the natural world around us does (including the

I think it's a little simple to assume that only carnivores are aggressive
while herbivores are not, and that eating meat makes humans aggressive.
First of all, most carnivores in nature do not kill for fun, rarely kill
there own like we do. In fact herbivores can hurt/kill when protecting there
offspring, territory, herd etc. Ever seen an angry elephant? Wouldn't
like to be near one of those.

Well, a DJ obviously adds value, but then again, so do the
artists. I'm sure that some artists don't mind that DJs sell
mixtapes, but I'm sure that others do, and with good
reason.  Selling mixtapes and mix-CDs can be big business,
and a lot of the artists out there aren't making a hell of a
lot of money.

I think about this stuff every time I make a tape.  I try to
give away enough free copies that I'm not actually making
money on the deal, but that doesn't really resolve the moral
ambiguity.  It just means that I'm not profiting off of the
moral ambiguity.

Any other thoughts?

Hey everyone!  

I just thought of a tapes idea.  A collective of DJ's selling/trading tapes
of themselves!  This would bring the cost within reasonable ranges, while
directly supporting the ones who spend their creative energies!  Tapes are
cheap, and every DJ I have ever met has taping equiptment.  So, why deal with
distributors and stores if we can do it ourselves?!  Besides, this allows a
pool of "bootleg" tapes to be heard by all.  This would be excelent for
newbies like me to get a taste of the oldskull...something I wish I had
experienced.  There would need to be an agreement between all involved to
respect the wishes of DJ's and setting price protocols and methods, ofcourse!
Where could this be enacted?  On this site? 

Peace!

The band I'm in "RE:" will be putting out a "mix tape" of all live original
music sometime in the near future.  The best of both worlds, and no ones
toes get stepped on :)

Here's a different slant. This is simplifying things a bit, but being
vegetarian, for me, is partly a matter of ethics and partly a matter of
convenience. The easiest way for me to make sure that my eating doesn't
unduely support mistreatment of animals is not to eat animal products.
(That's the theory, anyway. The occasional bit of mayonnaise and cheese
slips through. :)

Sure i could go to the effort of locating sources for "free-range"
animal products and checking with farms that the marketing label
"free-range" actually means "treated well". But why bother when my
local supermarket has tofu and soy milk? (And Subway has Garden
Burgers. Mmmmmm. :)

Now is the ethical position that "my eating shouldn't support undue
mistreatment of animals" immoderate? It depends on your definition
of moderation.

True, but the target audiences of vinyl releases and mix tapes/cds
are not identical.  If I purchase a 12", I'm probably looking for a
tool to mix with.  But if I buy an hour long mix tape or cd, then
I'll probably be listening to it while I do other things.

Personally, I'd be delighted to find myself on a mix tape -- high
sales of such a release can only mean good things for the included
artists.

I certainly see no *loss* one might incur from being featured, but
if the mixing is bad, that's another story ;)

True. But I feel that the same people who buy mix tapes/CDs
are people who might buy legitimate compilation CDs, for
which artists get royalties (or at least I *hope* they are
getting royalties!)

My Private Response to JuhStyn from his previous mail...AndyW

I think it's Pure Acid mixtapes.  I've seen them at LA raves several times.  
They're really heavy on the black lights and usually have a host of motorized 
day glow trail machine things behind the counter.  Really cool people.  Plus 
they're helpful in picking tapes out if you're a moron (like me-self) who know 
what they're looking for but are bad at describing it (it goes ....nicla, nickla
nickla nickla and then kinda gets swallowed before the bass kicks in with this 
Bom-badadadada Boooooom....).

Almost all of their tapes come in dayglow one color sleeves.  Totally classic 
stand.  Secret Tip: Most stands like that haggle if you're poor, the salesperson
is into what you're into or buying a whole boat of crap.  It is kinda weird that
we don't have that that much here.  

It would be doubly cool if the DJ's were running their own conglomerate booth 
with their own tapes at some of the bigger shows (Juggernaut anyone?).  That 
way, all the profits would end up in the right place, with no middlebeings, and 
the savings could be passed on to you: the beat addict.

Hey, whatever.  Look, not everything on this list gets put up in
chronological order.  I had been reading the threads re:mixtapes, split from
the computer for a few hours, when I came up with the idea. I typed the
message, and started a flash session. At that time, I got your message, but
the mail was already sent!  Is this a competition?  So what if an idea gets
put up twice?  Besides, I meant something on the net, not a booth at a rave.

logistics/organization of something like this? I would definately be

From: Bradley J. Gong
You may recall last year's Darwin Award winner: The man who found out
moments before making a 300 MPH dent in an Arizona cliff that the JATO unit
he'd strapped to his car could not be turned off once it was turned on.

There's been a lot of controversy recently about whether the Darwin Awards
are real or just a great urban legend.  If they don't exist, why not?

And there are some excellent candidates among this year's rumoured
nominations:

Darwin Awards

These are nearly always granted posthumously. This citation is bestowed upon
(the remains of) that individual, who through single-minded self-sacrifice,
has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool.

[San Jose Mercury News]

An unidentified man, using a shotgun like a club to break a former
girlfriend's windshield, accidentally shot himself to death when the gun
discharged, blowing a hole in his gut.

 --------------------------------------------------------------
[Hickory Daily Record, 12-21-92]

Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in December in
Newton, N. C., when, awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone beside
his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith & Wesson .38
Special, which discharged when he drew it to his ear.

 --------------------------------------------------------------
[News of the Weird, 18 May 93, San Jose Mercury News]

A 24-year-old salesman from Hialeah, Fla., was killed near Lantana, Fla., in
March when his car smashed into a pole in the median strip of Interstate 95
in the middle of the afternoon. 

Police said that the man was traveling at 80 MPH and, judging by the sales
manual that was found open and clutched to his chest, had been busy reading.

[Unknown, 25 March 1993] A Vapid Death

A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death
of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his body but
autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system.  His diet had
consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple other things). It was
just the right combination of foods.

It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous
cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows
opened it wouldn't have been fatal but the man was shut up in his near
airtight bedroom. He was ``...a big man with a huge capacity for creating
[this deadly
gas].'' Three of the rescue workers got sick and one was hospitalized.

 --------------------------------------------------------------
[Reuters, Mississauga, Ontario]
Man slips, falls 23 stories to his death.

A man cleaning a bird feeder on his balcony of his condominium apartment in
this Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death, police said
Monday.

Stefan Macko, 55, was standing on a wheeled chair Sunday when the accident
occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer of the Peel regional police.

"It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony," Honer said.
"It's one of those freak accidents. No foul play is suspected."

 --------------------------------------------------------------
[UPI, Toronto]

Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a downtown
Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his shoulder and plunged 24
floors to his death.

A police spokesman said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the courtyard of the
Toronto Dominion Bank Tower early Friday evening as he was explaining the
strength of the building's windows to visiting law students.

Hoy previously had conducted demonstrations of window strength according to
police reports. Peter Lauwers, managing partner of the firm Holden Day
Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Hoy was ``one of the best and
brightest'' members of the 200-man association.

 --------------------------------------------------------------
[AP, Cairo, Egypt, 31 Aug 1995] CAIRO, Egypt (AP)]

Six people drowned Monday while trying to rescue a chicken that had fallen
into a well in southern Egypt.

An 18-year-old farmer was the first to descend into the 60-foot well.  He
drowned, apparently after an undercurrent in the water pulled  him down,
police said.

His sister and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one by
one to help him, but also drowned. Two elderly farmers then came to help,
but they apparently were pulled down by the same undercurrent.

The bodies of the six were later pulled out of the well in the village of
Nazlat Imara, 240 miles south of Cairo.

The chicken was also pulled out. It survived.

 --------------------------------------------------------------
[Times of London]

A thief who sneaked into a hospital was scarred for life when he tried to
get a suntan.

After evading security staff at Odstock Hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire,
and helping himself to doctors' paging devices, the thief spotted a vertical
sunbed. He walked into the unit and removed his clothes for a 45-minute tan.

However, the high-voltage UV machine at the hospital, which is renowned for
its treatment of burns victims, has a maximum dosage of ten seconds.  After
lying on the bed for almost 300 times the recommended maximum time the man
was covered in blisters.

Hours later, when the pain of the burns became unbearable, he went to
Southampton General Hospital, 20 miles away,in Hampshire. Staff became
suspicious because he was wearing a doctor's coat. After tending his wounds
they called the police.

Southampton police said: "This man broke into Odstock and decided he fancied
a quick suntan. Doctors say he is going to be scarred for life."

I'm Glad you mentioned our (humans) dentition indicates we are omnivorous.  I
was told once by a well meaning vegetarian that "Because chimps are 98%
genetically identical to us and are vegetarians, we are supposed to be
vegetarians."  While we are 98% genetically identical to chimps I had to
inform her that 1.  Chimps are omnivorous and even hunt other monkeys as a
food source.  2.  There have been documented cases of canibalism among
chimps.  3.  chimps while usually peaceful are cabable of being extremely
violent and aggressive.  As you pointed out a vegetarian lifestyle is
possible but you must be careful to get all the required nutrients.     Jeff

Herbavores are docile (and stupid too).  How much brain power does it take to
munch away at a plant all day long.  My point is that without the need to
cooperate and communicate during a hunt the evolutionary pressure for
reasoning and problem solving (not to mention language) is absent and we may
never have evolved to the point where we can even question our eating habits.

	i will be getting more.

	again, i don't work for nike per se, except as an 
	employee of a company who nike has contracted for
	a while.  this is not necessarily in their defense 
	that i post this; one should always question what
	one reads - be it in the /guardian/ or /village
	voice/ to major newspapers and press releases.

	if it is worth anything to any of you, i do know 
	some people here who actually know what's going on
	in their overseas factories.  the person i talked
	to has been to many of them.  this person is a very
	heads-up guy, and a good person.  i strongly doubt
	he would flat-out lie to me.  he told me that 
	conditions are good in those factories, and better
	than most of the rest of the factories in their
	communities.

	take it all with a critical eye, though... question
	authority and all that.

"i hate anything that ends with .exe" - patrick sean farley

LABOR DEBATE -- Yet again the seemingly  inexplicable guns of journalism 
have gone off.  This time, however, foreign service reporters  Keith B. 
Richburg and Anne Swardson offer sanity  instead of fiction. What follows 
are excerpts  from their July 28 Washington Post article,  "U.S. Industry 
Overseas: Sweatshop or Job  Source?":

"It is one of those yes-you-do, no-I-don't- debates where the truth is 
difficult to  ascertain not only in the United States but in  Serang, a 
gritty industrial center 50 miles west  of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. 
What is clear  is that Indonesia is booming and poverty is  falling, 
relative to its impoverished past, and  much of the boom has come since 
American and  other companies began investing there a decade  or so ago. 
Many of the 120,000 Indonesian  workers who produce Nike shoes, most of 
whom  come from impoverished rural backgrounds, say  factories like 
Serang's provide a chance not  only to earn but to save money and to send 
the  extra cash back to families.

"Per capita income in Indonesia has more than  tripled in the last 20 
years. The decline in  poverty has been one of the most dramatic in  
recent years; according to the World Bank, 15  percent of the population 
lived at the lowest  level of poverty early this decade, down from 29  
percent 10 years before.

"The Serang factory closes for about 10 days  each year for Muslim 
holidays and most of the  workers return to their villages to see family, 
 drop off the money they have collected and, for  some of the young women, 
to find husbands.   Traditionally some women never return from the  
holidays. At that plant, Nike officials and the  plant's Taiwanese owners 
say 94 percent of the  workers came back after the most recent break.  `If 
it were that bad, they wouldn't come back,'  said a Nike official. `They 
vote with their  feet.'"

ON OTHER FRONTS

NIKE TECHNOLOGIES AWARDED -- Nike won the  Environmental Technology Award 
for creating and  using technologies that reduce environmental  impact. 
The award was accepted by NEAT's  director, Sarah Severn, at the Sports  
International Trade Show in Chicago. The sold- out event played host to a 
large number of  retailers including Nike accounts such as  Stadium Sports 
of Sweden and Rebel Sports of  Australia. Because environmental 
responsibility  is increasingly becoming a focus for  international 
business, the organizers of the  `96 Show inaugurated the first-annual ET- 
 Environmental Tech Awards.  The ET awards are  jointly sponsored by 
Sports International,  Outdoor Retailer and The International Sports  
Plaza of Atlanta. Each year the Environmental  Technology Awards will 
recognize one large ($100  million plus revenue) and one small (under $10 
 million) company that has created or utilized  specific technology 
designed to preserve the  environment. Nike was recognized for Regrind and 
 Reuse-A-Shoe in addition to several other  proprietary technologies.

The "Good Times" virus is a memetic virus, that is, the warning message is
the virus. So, by spreading the warning, you are spreading the virus. BTW,
this is about the 15th time this has come up on SFraves in the last two

Great day,

I won't bother to post a belated review of F&F.  Many have said more eloquently than
I what transpired in that place in time.
  
This is a  :)  BIG HUG  :) to all of those who made this party possible and created the love 
that made it so special.    ;)  :)  ;)  :)  ;)  :)  ;)  :)  

I don't think words can really describe how I felt in your collective presence.  So I won't try.

Thank you !

Good day,

What a deal!  I love the Sfraves t-shirt that you were so kind to design for us.  It looks
great and is so comfy.  I wore it out to the movies last night and two people asked me 
what Sfraves was and where I got it.  There are so many creative people in this family.
I feel truly happy to have found such a special group of people.

Take care,
                    Jason

Good day,

Thanks for finding me at F&F and giving me your mixtape.  Out of my mind on the 
way home, it was a catalyst to get retrospective about the party.  It really kept the vibe
goin'.  Only one small gripe about the tape, it has a few minutes where the output
levels seem to drop quite a bit.  Not a problem most of the time, but the amp in my
van is sensitive to turning the head unit's volume most of the way up.  I was driving 
down the freeway (my hotrod 70 Ford van is real loud), hit this spot on the tape, 
turned the volume up as to here the detail above the motor, and bam...monster feedback.
Like I said, only a problem in a 300 horsepower vehicle where you sit next to the engine.
Thanks again.

Take care,
                    Jason

This would be a good "list it yourself" on a website, where people would

Apparently more than most of us have!  Instead we make our lives
complicated, stressful, filled with fear and hate when we could just
be kicking back enjoying the simple life.  Gee, we must be smart.

Interesting, but hunting can't be the only "evolutionary pressure for
reasoning and problem solving"?  What about a stereo?  Surely, Nature
intended for us to invent such a thing--hell we already had food who
needs to hunt, but you can't be expected to wait around for a good
thunderstorm to rock the house!

On the origins of man I think I prefer the idea the Nefilim from the 12th
Planet imprinted their genetic code onto homo erectus and thereby
produced homo sapien--the perfect little worker to till their land and
mine their mines.  Only why didn't they leave any stereos behind--those
bastards, just because we took back our planet!

Tim (past his bed time)

Hey, since I mentioned a stereo, does that make this rave related?

I would be willing to work with some people on setting up site space. 
I've got a RealAudio server.  we can encode the tapes and put them up,
this would allow people to listen to them on the net, assuming they had
the realaudio player.

The best thing would be to have the mix tape with a playlist so that the
original artists can be credited.

My initial feelings about selling them over the net are not real
positive right now, though.  I just don't feel real comfortable with all
the intellectul property issues involved.

If anybody is willing to help organize, I've got the web space and the
server.

best,
pauly

     JDub,
     
     That being the case, my sincerest apologies to you.  I owe you a 
     mixtape of your choice (I'm into thematic gifts).  As for the internet 
     thing, perhaps we could ask Brian/Derek to have an SF-Raves links to 
     DJ pages area... DJ's or friends of DJ's or promoters who sponsor DJ's 
     could have info or forms for money/tape transactions (there are 
     already some cool ones out there!).  That way Hyperreal wouldn't be 
     liable, and the DJ's could sell their wares most directly.  
     <<<Check out http://www.bass-station.com/FnF/Tapes.html#Ethan>>>
     
     As for the table at a rave, I'd still like to push for that.  For 
     those of you who didn't find it at the bottom of my unholy blast I'll 
     put it right....
     
     Here>
     It would be doubly cool if the DJ's were running their own 
     conglomerate booth with their own tapes at some of the bigger shows 
     (Juggernaut anyone?).  That way, all the profits would end up in the 
     right place, with no middlebeings, and the savings could be passed on 
     to you: the beat addict.
     
     Please consider the hatchet buried.

Hey, whatever.  Look, not everything on this list gets put up in 
chronological order.  I had been reading the threads re:mixtapes, split from 
the computer for a few hours, when I came up with the idea. I typed the 
message, and started a flash session. At that time, I got your message, but 
the mail was already sent!  Is this a competition?  So what if an idea gets 
put up twice?  Besides, I meant something on the net, not a booth at a rave.

Uhh Yea..  The sysop at vcomm.net really got on my case for not warning
him about a sudden increase on the number of visits my site has gotten
in the last 2 days.    MOST of my stuff is on "vcomm.net" and just my
"Home page" is on the WELL,  to avoid the steep storage charges the
well has...

I haven't contacted the WELL yet,  but I know that AOSmell was taken
down when art bell gave out his URL and mentioned that he had linked
to my site.  Now I'm getting more than 2000 hits/hour.  I guess with
some 200- 300 radio stations,  and over 20 million people listening,
It's no wonder..   Stragely,  my Email has increased by only about 30 %.
Go figure...

Question... Do the DJ's that make up these tapes have to pay royalties to
the musicians that record the vinyl the DJ's spin?

Just curious,  and would explain the high price.   If so,  how much do
they have to pay?  I'm most curious...
