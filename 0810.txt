Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

Sorta the opposite when I'm at work and people don't like being told to 
stop what they're doing so they always say "I know, you're JUST doing 
your job...."  as if they assume I'm ok with what they're doing but I'm 
required to stop them and am unable to do otherwise.

It never occurs to them that the reason I'm telling them STOP HOLDING 
THE FUCKING DOOR OPEN" is because DJ Hearing loss thinks that because 
there's only 10 peopel in teh club teh solution is to tuirn the music up 
louder, and people want to hold the door open and ask me inane retarded 
questions like "I HAVE A HANDSTAMP, SO CAN I LEAVE AND COME BACK??" with 
the music blasting and they don't want to let the door close because 
until it shuts, they're not REALLY out the door.

I know everyone on this list clubs.  Please, try to keep a few things in 
mind though, especially with us working there...

1. It's my job.  I'm at work.  While you are enjoying time off, I'm 
clocked in.  Would you enjoy people coming to your job and start 
yelling, drinking, puking, draping themselves all over you and screaming 
drunkenly stupidity or having a g-seizure?  Ya well, neither do I. 

2.  Before asking some really stupid and obvious question, just think 
about it for one moment.  If you couldn't go in & out, why would they be 
hand stamping you?  You don't get a hand stamp at the movie theater do you?

2a.  Don't walk up talking on your cell phone and ask security what time 
it is. 
2b.  When getting you ID check, put away the cell phone.  Yapping in 
somebody face to your friends is rude.  many of us clubbed for many many 
years without cellphones and always managed to hookup and hang out with 
our friends.  It IS possible.
2c.  If it's 5pm and you ask security "what time do you close" and they 
say "4 O'clock" so not ask them "In the afternoon??"
2d.  If somebody is reading a book, do not
    1. Ask them if they're reading
    2. Ask them what they are reading
    3. Point out how surprised you are that bouncers can read
    4. bother them
2e. If there is a porta-pottie outside of a club, do not bother the 
security guy, asking him if it's ok if you use it.  That's what it's 
there for.  they would far rather you use a porta-pottie without 
expressed permission than to piss on the wall next to them.
2f . Don't show the guy on back door your handstamp while you are 
leaving, they don't give a shit and they think you are really stupid for 
doing so.
2g. Don't slap the arm of security while leaving unless you have been to 
his house, ate dinner with him, and took a shit in his bathroom.
2h. Doing anything other than walking out the back door and going about 
your business, will result in security thinking that you are a waste of 
skin.

3.  Security couldn't give a rats ass who's DJing at what time.  Don't 
ask, we don't know, we don't care.  If it's not posted near the DJ booth 
then we know as much as the customer.

4.  If you don't put your shit in coat check, don't get upset when you 
can't find and awe don't care.

5. You medical Marijuana does not mean you can bring weed into the club 
and smoke out.  It's still illegal.  Even if it were 100% legalized, the 
ABC (Alcohol Beverage Control) still says that you cannot smoke weed 
where alcohol is consumed. 

6.  If you get thrown out for whatever reason, just leave.  The faster 
you leave, the sooner everyone forgets about you.  If you stand around 
for 4 hours trying to talk your way back in, you just look liek a 
pathetic retard and we will laugh about you.  After work we will talk 
mad shit about you.  When you come back you will be referred to on radio 
as "that stupid guy last week that got thrown out and pissed off the 
door guy for 6 hours."

6a. yes, all customers that are a pain in the ass have pet names.  Some 
of which I have heard and used are:  Creepy African Guy, Creepy Indian 
Guy, Creep that is never on anyones guest list, The other creepy Indian 
guy, The Disciple (great story there), The Asian Leprechaun, No Balls, 
Miss Piggy, Garrets Girlfriend...  the list goes on.

7.  While staff is here to help, we are not here to serve, nor are we at 
your beck and call.  Keep this in mind when you get told something you 
don't like.

8.  Once security has made a decision, that will be the law.  No other 
security will over rule them, right or wrong.  Argueing, negotiating, 
and offer of chump change will not alter this decision.  If you are 
going to bribe, it had better be significant ($100 is a good starting 
point to not be insultive).  Keep in mind that the one who made the call 
is the one that needs to be bribed, not their co worker.

9.  When being a jackass after having been thrown out, it's usually a 
bad idea to talk about being friends with the owner, and when somebody 
walks up and says "what's going on" shoving them onto their ass, 
especially when it was the owner that you just shoved.


(hope this was somewhat entertaining)

your job...."  as if they assume I'm ok with what they're doing but I'm 
required to stop them and am unable to do otherwise.

It never occurs to them that the reason I'm telling them STOP HOLDING 
THE FUCKING DOOR OPEN" is because DJ Hearing loss thinks that because 
there's only 10 peopel in teh club teh solution is to tuirn the music up 
louder, and people want to hold the door open and ask me inane retarded 
questions like "I HAVE A HANDSTAMP, SO CAN I LEAVE AND COME BACK??" with 
the music blasting and they don't want to let the door close because 
until it shuts, they're not REALLY out the door.

I know everyone on this list clubs.  Please, try to keep a few things in 
mind though, especially with us working there...

1. It's my job.  I'm at work.  While you are enjoying time off, I'm 
clocked in.  Would you enjoy people coming to your job and start 
yelling, drinking, puking, draping themselves all over you and screaming 
drunkenly stupidity or having a g-seizure?  Ya well, neither do I. 

2.  Before asking some really stupid and obvious question, just think 
about it for one moment.  If you couldn't go in & out, why would they be 
hand stamping you?  You don't get a hand stamp at the movie theater do you?

2a.  Don't walk up talking on your cell phone and ask security what time 
it is. 
2b.  When getting you ID check, put away the cell phone.  Yapping in 
somebody face to your friends is rude.  many of us clubbed for many many 
years without cellphones and always managed to hookup and hang out with 
our friends.  It IS possible.
2c.  If it's 5pm and you ask security "what time do you close" and they 
say "4 O'clock" so not ask them "In the afternoon??"
2d.  If somebody is reading a book, do not
    1. Ask them if they're reading
    2. Ask them what they are reading
    3. Point out how surprised you are that bouncers can read
    4. bother them
2e. If there is a porta-pottie outside of a club, do not bother the 
security guy, asking him if it's ok if you use it.  That's what it's 
there for.  they would far rather you use a porta-pottie without 
expressed permission than to piss on the wall next to them.
2f . Don't show the guy on back door your handstamp while you are 
leaving, they don't give a shit and they think you are really stupid for 
doing so.
2g. Don't slap the arm of security while leaving unless you have been to 
his house, ate dinner with him, and took a shit in his bathroom.
2h. Doing anything other than walking out the back door and going about 
your business, will result in security thinking that you are a waste of 
skin.

3.  Security couldn't give a rats ass who's DJing at what time.  Don't 
ask, we don't know, we don't care.  If it's not posted near the DJ booth 
then we know as much as the customer.

4.  If you don't put your shit in coat check, don't get upset when you 
can't find and awe don't care.

5. You medical Marijuana does not mean you can bring weed into the club 
and smoke out.  It's still illegal.  Even if it were 100% legalized, the 
ABC (Alcohol Beverage Control) still says that you cannot smoke weed 
where alcohol is consumed. 

6.  If you get thrown out for whatever reason, just leave.  The faster 
you leave, the sooner everyone forgets about you.  If you stand around 
for 4 hours trying to talk your way back in, you just look liek a 
pathetic retard and we will laugh about you.  After work we will talk 
mad shit about you.  When you come back you will be referred to on radio 
as "that stupid guy last week that got thrown out and pissed off the 
door guy for 6 hours."

6a. yes, all customers that are a pain in the ass have pet names.  Some 
of which I have heard and used are:  Creepy African Guy, Creepy Indian 
Guy, Creep that is never on anyones guest list, The other creepy Indian 
guy, The Disciple (great story there), The Asian Leprechaun, No Balls, 
Miss Piggy, Garrets Girlfriend...  the list goes on.

7.  While staff is here to help, we are not here to serve, nor are we at 
your beck and call.  Keep this in mind when you get told something you 
don't like.

8.  Once security has made a decision, that will be the law.  No other 
security will over rule them, right or wrong.  Argueing, negotiating, 
and offer of chump change will not alter this decision.  If you are 
going to bribe, it had better be significant ($100 is a good starting 
point to not be insultive).  Keep in mind that the one who made the call 
is the one that needs to be bribed, not their co worker.

9.  When being a jackass after having been thrown out, it's usually a 
bad idea to talk about being friends with the owner, and when somebody 
walks up and says "what's going on" shoving them onto their ass, 
especially when it was the owner that you just shoved.


(hope this was somewhat entertaining)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

No problem....  here to help.  ;)

My real rant of late has been....  women.  Now, there's some of you on 
this list, so please, hear me out on this rant, as it applies to 
everyone...  EQUALLY...

I have on more occasion witnessed women do things in clubs freely that 
would get a man ejected or possibly 86'd.  Women for years have played 
the "I an get anyone thrown out anytime game" and for some reason thing 
bouncers are too stupid to catch on.  Well, we know all about that 
game.  Thus, wen you complain, you'll find that typically, we take what 
you say under advisement and "keep an eye" on the suspect.  Why?  
Because honestly, there's been too much crying wolf.

Example:  Girl comes up, crying.  "There's (sob) a guy in there, he 
tried to (sob sob) get all over me.  He was grabbing my ass, trying to 
pull my top off, trying to stickhis tounge down my throat.  He wanted to 
rape me!!  throw him out!! (cry cry cry)."  We pull the guy out, she 
get's all upset at seeing him.  The guy looks completely confused.  In 
fact, the guy says to security "on my god!!!  What happened to her??  Oh 
the poor thing!  Is she ok???  Oh my god!!!"

We then tell him that she has accused him of creeping on her, attacking 
her, and grabing her in apropriately.  Guy then says "Oh my god that 
bitch!  I don't even know her!  On my god, how could she say such 
things!!!" about this time anothe rguy comes out, spots first guy "oh my 
god!  why are you here??  Your drink is getting all watery"  Hugs and 
touching between the two guys.  First guy "I don't even know that girl, 
I mean, I'm here with my boyfriend..  look at him!  Isn't he hot?  Look 
at that ass OH MY GOD (slap)!"  Smooching happens.

Now...  do I really think that this guy, with his gay friends, with his 
shirt off, shaved chest, making out with other guys in tight pants, 
bumping and grinding to  gay house music and getting all for for men, 
will suddenly spot a gal who is short, dumpy, about 50 pounds over 
weight that looks like she's 45 but her IS says 28, and decide he's 
gotta ride that hetrotrain to vagina town right here, right now.

No.  And neither do you.

That's but one example.

I often observe women who will  unasked for, decide they are going to 
drape themselves on people, start kissing on them, grab random ass,  and 
do what they want to who they want.  Acting in a way that any guy would 
get the shit kicked out of them, but they get away with it because they 
are a woman and figure any man they grab will be thrilled with the 
attention because we're all pigs.

This has to stop.  The same rules apply to everyone.  That's equality.

Urgent Letter re the $700 Billion Bank Bailout

Dear Fellow American Citizen:

The ongoing, severe economic turmoil in our nation - destined to get =20
worse if the right remedy is not enacted - was predicted in our video =20
The Money Masters as the inevitable result of our fractional reserve =20
banking system.

Our banking system, established by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, =20
works essentially like a spring.  When the Central Bank, the Federal =20
Reserve, wishes to create new money, it simply does so.  There are no =20
reserves to our money.  The Fed then spends this money, usually to buy =20
Treasury Bonds from private owners of the bonds (more recently to =20
bailout or help huge banks buyout failing banks), which the sellers =20
had purchased from the Treasury Department.  These bonds (and Treasury =20
bills, TIPS and notes) were initially sold to the public to fund =20
government deficits. In our metaphor the money created by the Fed is =20
the spring.  The spring gets stretched in the following manner.

Banks, privately-owned, are permitted to loan out 90% of this new =20
Fed-created money once it is deposited by the sellers of the bonds.  =20
That would not be a problem, except for the fact that the borrowers =20
almost always redeposit the money (or the people they pay with their =20
loan proceeds do).  Once re-deposited, the banks can lend it out =20
again.  This re-loan, redeposit, re-loan, redeposit, etc. scheme, =20
authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, allows banks each time =20
to retain just 10% of the re-deposited loan proceeds as a reserve, =20
ultimately allowing banks to lend out 9 times the original amount =20
deposited, and to charge interest on it as many times as it was =20
loaned.  So instead of an interest rate of, for example, 6%, the banks =20
may be collectively receiving a total of 54% interest per year (6% x =20
9; usually it is somewhat less due to the lack of qualified =20
borrowers).  Now you know, if have not already seen The Money Masters, =20
why banks grow and prosper much more than other businesses, that is, =20
until they have stretched the spring to the maximum.

Once the economy is flooded with the bank-created money 9 times in =20
excess of the money originally created by the Fed, an expansion that =20
increases the money supply, which reduces the purchasing power of =20
already-existing money (including wages and savings), interest rates =20
begin to drop (as there is more money to lend) and prices rise =20
(inflation).  The dollar begins to fall relative to the money of other =20
countries not in this same stage of money expansion.  Money begins to =20
flow out of US Treasury bonds (due to lower interest rates and the =20
lessening purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation).  Thus ends =20
the expansionary or "boom" part of this artificial "business cycle."  =20
To combat rising inflation and the falling dollar, the Fed begins =20
raising interest rates.

Then the spring of the economy - the money supply - having been =20
stretched to the maximum, begins its contraction, usually initiated by =20
rising interest rates reaching a point that begins to inhibit =20
borrowing and also inflation.  The economic "bust" part of the cycle =20
begins. Loans dwindle as interest rates rise and credit terms tighten. =20
  Various segments of the economy, accustomed to easy credit, begin to =20
contract due to higher interest rates; loans become harder to get.  =20
Home prices fall, businesses begin to fail, bankruptcy's increase.  =20
This "bust" part of the cycle continues, and worsens, until inflation =20
is "tamed," prices stabilize, and the dollar rises relative to other =20
currencies.  Eventually, the higher interest rates begin to attract =20
foreign money, and the Treasury then is able to borrow what it needs =20
at lower and lower interest rates.  Interest rates fall.  The =20
artificial cycle then begins anew.

This boom-bust economic cycle is totally unnecessary and is the =20
fundamental cause of the inherent instability in our economy.  It is =20
due to too-rapid increases in the money supply due to deficit spending =20
and then the multiplier effect of fractional reserve banking =20
(described above) and to lenders greedy to take advantage of such a =20
system that rewards lending with more and more interest revenue; =20
followed by a too-rapid contraction of the money supply (such as we =20
are experiencing now), necessary to combat the inflationary effects of =20
the former phase, both the direct result of the Federal Reserve Act of =20
1913.  We urgently need to reform this system that rewards greed and =20
results in ever-increasing swings from boom-to-bust - destroying =20
ordinary businesses and farms in the process.  We need to repeal or =20
fundamentally reform the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and to replace =20
it with a system that eliminates the ability of private banks to =20
"create" and multiply money as loans.

The major banks of this country - the ones the government is lending =20
your money to, and from which the Bailout Bill proposes to buy their =20
bad assets (wouldn't you too like the opportunity to sell off your bad =20
investments to the government!), are busily swallowing up the banks in =20
trouble in this latest bust - one deeper because of more rapid prior =20
monetary expansion and inflation.  As after all prior bust cycles, =20
they will emerge larger and more powerful, and fewer.  Wealth will be =20
even more concentrated under their control, which they will use in the =20
next bust to further this process, until eventually no one will own =20
anything but the ability to borrow - to go deeper into debt to banks =20
than their neighbors. Not savings, but credit scores will determine =20
the average American's ability to engage in economic activity (such as =20
buying a home or car).  No one will dare breathe a word against such =20
power, concentrated in very few hands, and our republic will end with =20
a whimper.

Our Congress struggles with ignorance of the complex, bank-created =20
system enacted in 1913.  It struggles with the money the bank PACs =20
flood into the political system to defeat their critics and elect =20
their shills. It struggles with mass media owned or controlled by the =20
banks, which seek to stir up panic in the populace, to stampede =20
Congress into bank-developed "solutions" that only make the =20
fundamental problems worse and increase their wealth.  Based on =20
history, the banks will not fail to see-saw the economy and the =20
markets to match their strategies for fooling the public, and putting =20
pressure on the Congress to do their will.  But we must resist.  We =20
must hold out for genuine reform - for repeal or fundamental reform of =20
the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.

Here is a hyperlink to one such reform proposal, the Monetary Reform =20
Act. It is not the only possible reform, but it is one developed, in =20
its essentials, over many years by numerous monetary reformers =20
including the late Nobel Laureate, Dr. Milton Friedman.  Any genuine =20
reform of our monetary system must include two basic elements: =20
fractional reserve lending (such as described above) must be =20
prohibited, and private banks must be forbidden from creating money, =20
whether as loans or otherwise.  The Monetary Reform Act does both.  It =20
also incorporates means of doing this that include paying off the huge =20
national debt, and stabilizing the economy.

We have not previously written the viewers of The Money Masters.  We =20
judged the time was not ripe.  But increasingly we are being asked - =20
urgently - what can we do, and when, to be effective. Now it is =20
clearly urgent that we flood Congress with our calls, emails and =20
letters, to oppose the proposed taxpayer-funded Bailout of the banks.  =20
Rather, we support genuine reform, that will not result in an even =20
greater concentration of economic power in fewer and fewer hands.  We =20
support the Monetary Reform Act, or any such Act that repeals or =20
reforms the Federal Reserve Act so as to prohibit fractional reserve =20
banking and money creation (as loans or otherwise) by private banks.  =20
We oppose the Bailout of the banks.  We want genuine, fundamental =20
reform, now!

Very truly yours,

Patrick  S.J. Carmack

The Two Step Plan to National Economic Reform and Recovery


1. Directs the Treasury Department to issue U.S. Notes (exactly like =20
Lincoln's Greenbacks) to pay off the National debt.

2. Increases the reserve ratio private banks are required to maintain =20
from 10% to 100%, thereby terminating their ability to create money, =20
while simultaneously absorbing the funds created to retire the =20
national debt.

These two relatively simple steps, which Congress has the power to =20
enact, would extinguish the national debt, without inflation or =20
deflation, and end the unjust practice of private banks creating money =20
as loans (i.e., fractional reserve banking). Paying off the national =20
debt would wipe out the $400+ billion annual interest payments and =20
thereby balance the budget. This Act would stabilize the economy and =20
end the boom-bust economic cycles caused by fractional reserve =20
banking.  For the full text of the Act click here to read the MONETARY =20
REFORM ACT.

The bad news is that I'm not going to be able to throw together our little jam session we were talking about on Friday due to unforeseen circumstances now out of my control. Apologies to the headz that stepped-up to help, would love to have you out in the near future- and speaking of which- we'll still be doing something on the UG tip this Winter. With a little more time to prepare, it will be dope. 

The good news is that our snappy CaliGrown lighters are back for 'Love, and they're new & improved! Get your free BIC lighter with an overpriced vinyl sticker while they're hot. Email me offlist with a mailing addy., and consider your's on the way!

peace

CG

p.s. I can't wait either, Saturday is gonna be dope! lol @ e's post though, that was pretty funny.

JOSH WINK

An American producer who simultaneously possessed European hit singles, a
major-label album contract, consistent contact with the dance mainstream,
plus the requisite underground credentials, Josh Wink appeared to lack for
nothing at the peak of his success in the mid-'90s. Part of the East
Coast/Philadelphia dance scene, Wink recorded three techno monsters out of
his bedroom studio (as Wink, Winx, and Size 9) that topped charts in Europe
during 1995 and saw him anointed as a dance poster boy, easily recognized b=
y
his ruddy good looks and flowing blond dreadlocks. Hardly the techno
kingpin, however, Wink's espousal of a vegan lifestyle and his defiantly
anti-drug ideals made him something of a unique personality in the
hedonistic world of dance music.

After being turned on by punk rock in the '70s, Josh Winkelman was inspired
by a diverse group of dance-styled artists during the 1980s -- ranging from
Depeche Mode to Kraftwerk to Run-D.M.C. -- and began working with a
Philadelphia-based mobile DJ service from the age of 13. After he met up
with a fellow DJ, King Britt, at one party, the duo began recording. One of
their first productions, 1990's "Tribal Confusion" by E-Culture, was
released on New York's Strictly Rhythm Records and became a success in
America's exploding club/rave scene, which Wink and Britt soundtracked by
DJing at events around the country. Wink had also recorded for Nervous,
another vaunted East Coast dance label, before forming Ovum Records in late
1994 with Britt.

Ovum and Wink had an international club hit right out of the box with 1995'=
s
"Liquid Summer"; the single led to Wink recording for a maze of European
labels. During 1995, he recorded "Don't Laugh" by Winx, "I'm Ready" by Size
9, and "Higher State of Consciousness" by Winks, all of which topped
European dance charts and even made several pop charts despite their debt t=
o
hard-edged acid trance. The singles were collected along with new material
for his 1996 debut album, Left Above the Clouds, and released as Winx. The
major labels came calling in 1997, and Wink decided to sign not only himsel=
f
but the entire Ovum Recordings label to a deal with Columbia. After
recording with King Britt, Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, poet Ursula
Rucker, and Philly mod punks the Interpreters, Wink released his proper
album debut, Herehear, in 1998; the mix album Profound Sounds, Vol. 1
followed the next year. He spent much of his time contributing to Ovum acts
King Britt and Jamie Myerson, but by 2003 he had released both a second

SPEEDY J

After fifteen years of techno Speedy J has come full circle. He's making
techno again. But what a wide circle it was, and how fickle the trodden
path. Over the years he has collaborated with video-artists, filmmakers and
advertisers, made the pioneering DVD Umfeld and has continuously been
pushing the boundaries of electronic & experimental dance music. "I just
constantly want to do new things," he explains. Most recently this has been
exemplified in his new label Electric Deluxe, which will issue digital
releases only.

Jochem Paap (the Rotterdam artist owes the nickname Speedy J to his DJ
skills) is unanimously considered to be one of the first techno producers t=
o
come from the Benelux. Someone who, together with people like Laurent
Garnier, Aphex Twin and his good friend Richie Hawtin, helped raise the
genre just after it had escaped the Detroit delivery room. But while techno
develops into a multi-faced monster that still dominates many dance floors
worldwide, Jochem Paap, after the albums G Spot (1993) and Ginger (1995),
turns left and heads for more exciting places. On Public Energy No. 1 (1997=
)
and A Shocking Hobby (2000) the sound wizard exchanges flowing, harmonious
techno for a much more complex sound, filled with colliding samples,
crackling rhythms and tremendously thrilling turns. This is the time when
electronic dance music becomes profound and contemporaries like Autechre,
Funkst=F6rung and Aphex Twin have their machinery perform ever more
complicated tricks. During those days Jochem Paap converts his studio into =
a
modular system, which wins him the sought-after freedom. Suddenly everythin=
g
is possible with sound. And if an idea turns out to be more unruly than
expected he simply looks for software with which to crack the code of his
ideas after all. He discusses sound like graphic designers discuss form,
speaking of "contrast" and "depth" instead of a little ruffle here or a
bass-lick there. "I am sometimes really chiselling at sound," he reports
from his futuristic studio located in one of the famous cube quarters in
Rotterdam. "In essence my work is about stylising rather than composing."
Stylising is his strong point, he feels. "I might not be a brilliant
musician but I do know very well how to fashion my ideas into a particular
form. Out of a few components I try to make something distinctive."

Although Jochem Paap enjoys chiselling at sounds alone in his cube studio
for hours on end, he is anything but an einzelg=E4nger. Such is evident in =
his
Collabs-project, through which he has been collaborating with various techn=
o
musicians since 2004. The German Chris Liebing and Paap collaborate most
fruitfully. Together they play DJ sets in clubs for hours and released the
album Metalism in 2005, a ruthless techno-bomb more powerful than the
bunkerbusters of the American army. "Working with someone else provides you
with new insights," says Paap. "Collabs offers us both the possibility to
explore corners which we wouldn't so readily visit as solo artists. Collabs
prospers on the dance floor and after extensive wandering Paap's recent sol=
o
material brings him back to the clubs. "Right now I feel very strongly abou=
t
making and releasing techno. My heart is really in dance music after all."

DRUMCELL

Founder of Droid Recordings and co-founder of Droid Behavior, Drumcell has
been one of techno's greatest allies in Southern California in recent times=
.


A graduate of the Musician's Institute and a long-time performer at parties
in Southern California, Drumcell has been influenced by music from his
earliest years. After being exposed to raves in the early 90s, He grew
addicted to the sounds of acid house, techno, in its many forms, and
industrial. It was not long before he was copping turntables to satisfy his
vinyl fetish. By the early age of 14 he was playing in various local bands,
and through out the rest of his teenage years, cut his teeth-producing hip
hop records, dub and various forms of electronic music on Los Angeles based
underground labels. By combining his Production, DJing and networking skill=
s
and focusing in on his more mature musical tastes he soon established
himself as one of the major players in LA's growing techno scene.
Associating with the members of Acid Circus to form Droid Behavior as an
event production group and record label was the next logical step to raise
awareness for techno in the city and to help expose local Artists,
established djs, and performers from around the country. Over the last 5
years Drumcell has rocked parties from big to small on a weekly basis in LA
as well as gigs all over the U.S alongside such names as Kenny Larkin, John
Tejada, Tim Xavier, Dan Bell, Ben Sims, Adam Beyer, Jeff Mills, Speedy J,
Richie Hawtin, Mathew Dear, etc. and has also released quite a few heavy
trax on labels Omniscient, Remains, Heavy Industries, and his own DROID
Recordings imprint.

Drumcell has been known to keep on the edge of technology and continuously
pushing the limits to what the future has to offer. He is always in the
process of developing homebrew software as well as cutting edge hardware
solution to bring a fresh innovative taste to his production and
performances. When performing, Drumcell can be seen blurring the lines
between a live and a DJ set by utilizing tools such as FX processors,
samplers, drum machines, and other devices to weave a thick blend of acidic
techno and aggressive but funky minimalist groove to ensure a frenzy amongs=
t
his listeners. With the state of electronic music in North America leaning
towards stripped down funk rather then progressive fluff these days, Droid
has become the center for LA techno and Drumcell remains steadfast in his
mission of putting this city on the global map.

See all of you midnight marauders on the dancefloor!

Rock It Science founder Eric Sharp will be performing at Lovefest from 1:00
to 1:30 PM on SFHousemusic's Karma Float, 2:30 to 4 PM on Flavor Group's
Solid Gold Jacuzzi Float, and at 7 PM on Supperclub's float.  After that we
are throwing a bass bin rattling, floor shaking, sweat inducing after party
at Supperclub with 2 of the hottest acts in the USA.  Advance tickets are o=
n
sale through 10 AM tomorrow.  YEAH!!!!

*Scion, Supperclub, Rock It Science, and Everyscape present:*

*Drop The Lime aka Curses and Spank Rock's Devlin & Darko!!*

Tickets/Info: http://www.going.com/spankthelime

Scion, Supperclub, Rock It Science, and Everyscape.com come together to
bring you a smoking hot afterparty for the SF Lovefest at San Francisco's
world renowned Supperclub. Come lose your mind to the sounds of the freshes=
t
artists who are breaking barriers and pushing envelopes across the globe,
playing festivals like Coachella, Rock The Bells, and Shambala:* Drop the
Lime aka Curses*, NYC's Heavy Bass Champion, plus genre bending hip
hop/electro act *Spank Rock's Devlin & Darko* along with a great supporting
lineup. Do it!!

Talent:
*
Drop The Lime aka Curses (Institubes, Trouble & Bass - NYC)
*
Set the standard; then raise the bar. Or in New York City's Luca Venezia's
case =96 totally destroy that bar on a global scale. The 25-year-old known =
as
Drop The Lime (and Curses!) is the iconoclastic club fiend of the 21st
Century. Producer, remixer and DJ, he started out at 17 and has since
dropped approximately 150 underground classics, each year breaking
boundaries of the musical zeitgeist =96 relentlessly developing concepts an=
d
sounds that leaves his many imitators wiping away tears with a white flag.
Lauded by critics (XLR8R/Dazed & Confused), premier blogs (Discobelle, Tras=
h
Menagerie, Fluo Kids), peers (UK production God Switch named Luca in his to=
p
artists of 2007) and the world's cutting edge record labels (releases on Ma=
d
Decent, Counterfeet, Shockout, Ambush, Institubes and Fools Gold), he is th=
e
undisputed, celebrated NYC Bass Heavy Champion. Drop The Lime's acclaimed
solo albums =96 2005's "This Means Forever" and 2007's "We Never Sleep" on
Tigerbeat6 saw him murdering bass and bytes =96 an evolved style,
re-appropriating breakcore, bassline house, rave, jungle and dubstep,
unforgettably touched with Luca's own original vocals. Recent remixes for
Moby, Robyn, Blaqstarr, Health Disco, Midnight Juggernauts and Infants have
fuelled the blaze. It's time to get hysterical.

*Spank Rock's Devlin and Darko (Big Dada - Baltimore)*

Best known for being members of the amazing live act Spank Rock, Devlin &
Darko have dj-ed with the likes of Beck, KRS 1 and Gnarls Barkley, as well
as finding time to start 2 successful monthly parties: Baltimore Bass
Connection in Baltimore and Fully Fitted in NYC. They also put out highly
popular mix tapes with Spank Rock producer XXXchange.

Devlin & Darko have deep crates and they know how to use them, mixing
everything from classic hip hop to Italo disco to French electro into a
dance party that's populist without being strictly pop. They're adept
mixers, inventive selectors, and genial hosts. Expect them to keep things
bouncing until the very moment the lights go on and the sound guy pulls the
plug.

*James Amato (Potty Mouth Music, Smart Bar - Chicago)*

Label boss of the wildly successful fidget house label Potty Mouth Music
joins us from Chicago to drop his signature blend of nasty dirty tracks!
*
Eric Sharp (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Sleazemore (Blasthaus, Lights Down Low)

Michael Anthony (supperclub)

Mykill (French Kiss)

Zoe Noa (supperclub - Amsterdam)

B Smiley (Supperclub)*

I don't know if any of you have had a chance to look at the economic =20
bailout bill that the House rejected by a slim margin but the Senate =20
passed their own version and is now in review for the House.  The bill =20
is 450 pages long and clearly just by scanning it shows me that the =20
bill gives sweeping new powers to the Treasury Secretary.  Other =20
things I've heard about it are it is mostly a bailout of derivatives, =20
not mortgages.  So this is going to collapse again in a few months =20
because derivatives are not worth anything, they are just paper.

How about the people, the ones that went to college for 4 years and =20
can't find a job, or people  that have been downsized, or families =20
being foreclosed on?  7 million people starved to death during the =20
Great Depression.

The people that want this bailout package to go through have a vested =20
interest in it, and are threatening there will be a crash if it =20
doesn't pass.  Well that's going to happen anyway, but don't you think =20
it's funny that the Dow dropped over 700 points the day the House did =20
not pass the bill.  This is economic terrorism being waged on the =20
people by the private bankers that control the monetary system.

I'm not trying to scare anyone or create fear.  The bankers are =20
already doing that for us.  I look at history and wonder what it might =20

continue.

Enjoy Lovefest this weekend, but also look at infrastructure of the =20

The European bankers that have had a stranglehold on our government since 1=

 had our nuts in a vice since day one.=20

This should come as NO SHOCK to ANYONE who has paid ANY attention to what's=
 been going on in our government for the last 100 years. Economic terrorism=
? You betcha - but it wouldn't have happened had our government not rolled =
over like pussies back when this shit 1st got started.

One of the reasons Kennedy got offed was because he was going to do away wi=
th the Federal Reserve and go back to a dollar that was actually backed by =
silver or gold - not just printed and pushed out with no real money behind =
it.

Every empire falls....every single one.

He does and he doesn't.  The very instantaneously efficient nature of
our economy also means that there's less of a vague period of rampant
inflation, because the cash becomes worthless instantly. :)

This means essentially, that money becomes obviously worthless in an
instant instead of where people kept trying to use it and had to spend
more and more of it to get things.

When this fiat economy goes, it'll pretty much be an instant barter
situation.  You have what you have and you either deal or coerce to
get what you need.  Or people starve very quickly and the reduction
in population makes things more sustainable fairly quickly, albeit
with some intensely widespread suffering to get there.

So yeah, he's got some points, but it won't be like he thinks, it'll
be worse...  And quite possibly it'll turn out that economics was the
weapon after nukes, and we'll have little more than sticks and stones
when this is all over.

"And quite possibly it'll turn out that economics was the
weapon after nukes"

I note that just a few weeks after Russia attacked Georgia, the Russian stock 
market lost half its value.? While we worry about the economy here, the U.S. 
Europe, Japan, and China faired better, losing much less value on a percentage 
basis.? Oil plummeted, dropping below $100 a barrel.? Getting the picture?

The question is who launched the attack?? Is the U.S. the target or the 
attacker?? Not everything is what it seems...

Here's some links if you are intereted in this theme...

He does and he doesn't.? The very instantaneously efficient nature of
our economy also means that there's less of a vague period of rampant
inflation, because the cash becomes worthless instantly. :)

This means essentially, that money becomes obviously worthless in an
instant instead of where people kept trying to use it and had to spend
more and more of it to get things.

When this fiat economy goes, it'll pretty much be an instant barter
situation.? You have what you have and you either deal or coerce to
get what you need.? Or people starve very quickly and the reduction
in population makes things more sustainable fairly quickly, albeit
with some intensely widespread suffering to get there.

So yeah, he's got some points, but it won't be like he thinks, it'll
be worse...? And quite possibly it'll turn out that economics was the
weapon after nukes, and we'll have little more than sticks and stones
when this is all over.

Cruisin down the street with my rave float
Jockin the techno, poppin the pillz .
Went to minna to get the scoop
Crackheads out there cold shooting some hoops


Cuz the ravers in the hood are always 'tard
You wave that glowstick we'll pull you hard
Knowing nothing in life but 40's and shit
Don't quote me on that, cuz it might be pouring and you might slip.

i was the one who started love parade SF as an anniversary event for the UN=

since it originally started in SF after WWII to end genocide after the nazi=
's=20
killed over 6 million jews during WWII along with many other people.=A0 ban=

for the Olympics in Beijing, China on August 8, 2008 and had posted the=20
Olympic Cruise on the Norweigian Pride of America in Hawaii.=A0 unfortunate=
ly,
Paulson pulled federal funds to funnel to Fanny Mae in Germany, which
turned out to be a front for obama and the DNC.=A0 due to problems with afr=
icans
hi-jacking just about everything i do, ban ki moon,=A0 the new UN head has =

up security for cruises
 as a favor
 to me, check:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/somalia/2069=
491/UN-approves-missions-against-Somali-pirates.html

as a result, hi-jackers that took over the cruises i started have tried to
lable me 'korean' when i am not korean to justify their hate campaigns on
me.=A0 african immigrant terrorists aka al quida are an extremely sneaky
evil lot, they were behind the 1993 WTC bombing, Black Hawk Down,
blowing up our american embassy in kenya, 9/11, spain train bombing,
london bombing, 5 years of california wildfires, they were even the ones
who had shot Tupac in Vegas!=A0 there is a world of difference between
african americans and african immigrant terrorists!=A0 for instance when
Colin Powell traveled to South, Africa for talks, the building he was in
was shot 15 times!=A0 watch 'The Last King of Scotland' starring Forest
Whitaker to understand how african war lords are
 completely ruthless.=20
1 million people have been killed in Sudan by janjaweed rebels.=A0 africans
are notorious for burning 100 christians alive in the streets for  simply
suggesting the prophet muhammed would've married a miss world
contestant.=20

after that, miss world was moved to sonia, china, where 4 miss world
contests have been held at.=A0 the four miss world contests in china was
part of the reason why china was picked for the site of the upcoming
olympics. it is also because china was where WTO 2005 was at resulting
in $500 billion in new accounts for america, $100 billion in new accounts
for africa, $100 billion in new accounts for germany (including financing
for the world cup stadiums in berlin in 2005), and $100 billion in new
accounts for england (which financed tony blair's labor party).=A0 i was
supposed to get 10% for my services from america, africa, germany,
and england, but so far
 i have received nothing!=A0 the money i was
supposed to get was supposed to go to financing for the Olympics in
China.=20

Thus the recent debate i had with  Paulson, who had been embezzeling
federal reserve funds and funneling it to US Banks, Africa, and Germany!=20
completely and utterly illegal!=A0 US federal law forbids embezzeling feder=
al
funds to foreign nations that have killed americans. both Africans and
Germans have killed americans in the past! And worse Paulson wanted to
funnel $25 billion to Fanny Mae, a Frankfurt, Germany company that wanted
to buy up american houses that couldn't afford mortgage payments to sell
the houses on the open market while the people still lived in the houses!=
=20
outrageous!=A0 Paulson and Benarke are the worst traitors ever since Condi,
who tried to kill Bush 9 times!=A0 America needs to wake up and stand up
against such blatant corruption!=A0 The money must not
 be sent to Germany,
I am not german (although i did start Love Parade SF and did promoted for
Cali Oktoberfest for three years), I am actually fourth generation  america=
n
born chinese american!=A0 the nazi propagandist are trying desperately to
character assasinate me to justify stealing the money i made for america
(i got japan and china to invest $1.4 trillion in US treasury bonds to bail
america out of a trillion dollar federal defecit in 2004) and embezzeling i=
t to
germany to finance fanny mae to take over american houses!=A0 where as i
needed the money for the rapture and the Olympics coming up in China!

germans and african immigrant terrorists aka al quida have launched hate
propaganda against me trying to potray me as a gang member or a drug
dealer when in reality i was never a gang member or a drug dealer and
actually notorious for being a jesus freak, clean freak, clean cut freak
my whole life
 who doesn't even smoke cigarettes!=A0 in fact, i got arrested
for simply reminding park staff that park policy is no smoking in the park
ever since the park  started especially in lieu of 5 years of cali wildfire=
s.
unfortunately, these are people who had set the fires in california for
FEMA insurance scams and had even tried to potray me as a red dragon
claiming i had started the fires when i don't even smoke cigarettes and
most of the fires occured over 6 hours south or 4 hours north of me!
china is the golden dragon, which symbolizes good fortune, as in how
i tunrned computer moguls into billionaires pre-Y2K and how i made
celebrities into millionaires with over 60 movies and TV shows that were
started from my internet intelligence reports.=A0 i have posted over 500 wo=
rld
solutions on-line since 1998!

the red dragon, was actually located on the royal british coat of arms for
wales when the british royal
 family used to be-head too many of their own
people over throne heiarchy disputes. most notorious being the be-heading
of lady jane grey, a teenage royal girl  who lost her head, because her aun=
t
claimed higher authority!=A0 chec/k: http://www.ladyjanegrey.org/

brits are also notorious for burning women at the stake claiming they were
witches!=A0 according to revelation, the red dragon is the one that eats it=
s=20
babies after they are born.=A0 obviously when so many people were being=20
be-headed in england as displayed in the movie 'brave heart' and burned at=
=20
the stake as in the movie about 'joan of arc' due claims of women as=20
witches, mother england had become a bit of a red dragon!

in fact, 77,300 people died during the Revolutionary War in America from=20
1775 to 1783, just so americans could be free from Mother England (who=20
seeked to keep America whipped financially and through old european family

There seems to be some confusion regarding the presales for P.U.G. Our =
flyers say, "Limited 100 pre-sales, $13 + drink ticket, $15 at the =
door".  The first batch of 100, $13 presales did sell out, but the way =
the flyers are written, one might assume the other 300+ would be held =
for sale at the door.  That's a big Oh Noooooo!  Woopsie! (The mere =
thought of selling 300+ tickets at the door gives me the willies.)  So =
yes, presales ARE still available through our website. The only =
difference is they're $15 and don't come with a drink ticket.  Sorry for =
the confusion.  =20

Where to go to grab 'em:  http://www.prohibitionparty.net

Oh and while your there, you can check out some of the new content, such =
as:

Well, apart from the immediate effect this may have on all of our well-being, I can't help but feel a little bit relieved over this prospect.  Perhaps a little humility and a real need to pull together as a nation would go a long way toward starting our nation's healing process.

Then again, I'm not excited about the devaluation of my meager assets or the shakiness of the job market, either.

labeling all bar., club, and casino owners as mafia to justify illegal

Islanders who insisted on staying died in Ike

 By MONICA RHOR, Associated Press Writer *Sat Oct 4, 1:58 PM ET*

GALVESTON, Texas - The final hours brought the awful realization to victims
of Hurricane Ike that they had waited too long. This storm wasn't like the
others, the ones that left nothing worse than a harrowing tale to tell.

George Helmond, a hardy Galveston salt, watched the water rise and told a
buddy: I was born on this island and I'll die on this island.

Gail Ettenger, a free spirit who adopted the Bolivar Peninsula as her home
15 years ago, told a friend in a last phone call: I really messed up this
time.

Within hours, the old salt and the free spirit were gone as the powerful
Category 2 hurricane wracked the Texas Gulf Coast on Sept. 13, flattening
houses, obliterating entire towns and claiming at least 33 lives.

The dead =97 as young as 4, as old as 79 =97 included lifelong Galvestonian=
s
firmly rooted on the island and transplants drawn by the quiet of coastal
living.

Seven people drowned in a storm surge that moved in earlier and with more
ferocity than expected. Nine others died in the grimy, sweaty aftermath,
when lack of power and medicine exacted its toll. Eleven people were
poisoned by carbon monoxide or killed in fires from the generators they use=
d
in their own attempts to survive.

Hundreds of people remain missing three weeks after Ike's assault on Texas.
Local and city officials are no longer keeping their own count of missing
residents, and the estimate varies wildly from one agency to another.

According to the nonprofit Laura Recovery Center, about 300 people are
missing. Of those, about 200 from Galveston. However, the number "goes up
and down by the minute" as people call in to remove or add names, cautioned
executive director Bob Walcutt.

Some vanished during the evacuation of towns in the storm's path. Many were
last heard in desperate, last-ditch calls for help.

Immediately after the hurricane, Galveston officials conducted door-to-door
searches for survivors and possible victims. But the city is no longer
taking an active role in the search, city spokeswoman Alicia Cahill said.

Instead, search teams of sheriff's deputies, volunteer firefighters and
special K-9 search and recovery units have been using airboats and
all-terrain vehicles to sift through debris fields, tangled and fetid
marshlands, and the rubble left behind by Ike.

Bodies could have been tossed anywhere in the marshes, where thickets of
trees are littered with the contents of houses. Refrigerators, office
chairs, and television sets are scattered everywhere __ in the mud, in
bushes, on treetops.

"We are definitely looking and are going to do anything we can to find them=
,
but there may not be any answers to be given," said Galveston County
emergency management spokesman Colin Rizzo. "There are definitely going to
be people from Hurricane Ike that are never found."

_____

Gail Ettenger stumbled upon her house in Gilchrist by accident. But once sh=
e
saw the site on the bay side of Bolivar Peninsula, she knew she would never
leave.

Ettenger, a native of New Jersey, instilled the house with her own energy
and style. The 58-year-old's garden bloomed with vibrant birds-of-paradise.

And Reba, an 11-year-old Great Dane hobbled by arthritis, was her baby.
Ettenger loved to treat the dog to dinners of chicken and roast beef,
recalled JoAnne Burks, Ettenger's neighbor and close friend.

Ettenger, a chemist at ExxonMobil, didn't evacuate, reasoning that her hous=
e
had weathered Hurricane Rita in 2005 without a problem. She also did not
want to leave Reba, who could no longer climb into Ettenger's Jeep.

Burks and her husband pleaded with Ettenger to change her mind. But she
insisted.

Hours before Ike made landfall, Ettenger knew she had made the wrong choice=
.
She called Burks and described the water pushing up under her feet, the
propane tanks and other household items drifting by her windows, and
wondered which would float better: her Jeep or her house.

Her voice was shaky with fear, Burks said.

Burks spent the next 10 days searching for her friend, calling local, count=
y
and state officials without success. She tried the American Red Cross, FEMA=

"I didn't want her to wind up like the victims of Katrina, who were never

Ettenger's body was found Sept. 23, tossed on a debris field in a Chambers

Amid the muck and remnants of homes, Burks found a pink leather collar. The

At 72, George Helmond had ridden out many storms and thought he could take
on Ike, too, neighbor Don Hanson said. "A lot of old Galvestonians are like
that."

Helmond had been one of the first residents of Sydnor Lane, which overlooks
a bayou on one side and a golf course on the other. A retired electrician,
Helmond was a die-hard fisherman, a dove hunter and straight-shooter
intensely proud of his Galveston roots.

Around 10 a.m., Helmond called Hanson, who had already left, to say the
water had already slipped over the road and toward his house. The street =
=97
the only way out of the neighborhood =97 was already impassable.

At 9:30 p.m., Helmond and Hanson talked for the last time. By then, the
water had pummeled through Helmond's garage, crushing the doors and
submerging his Cadillac. Hanson begged his friend to grab a life vest at hi=
s
house or to seek shelter there.

But at 2:30 a.m., for reasons no one knows, Helmond got in his pickup truck
and drove off at the height of Ike's fury.

Neighbors found Helmond's body the next day inside the truck, which had
slammed into the white golf course fence. The windshield was shattered.

Helmond's home suffered little damage. The water had reached above the
first-floor garage, but not inside the house.

"If he had stayed home and hadn't gone out, he'd be OK, but he panicked,"
said Hanson, 66. "Life goes on, but I will miss a good friend and I will
think about him."

Even as Ike bore down on Texas, Jim Devine refused to leave his
cream-colored house within sight of the bay in San Leon. Devine had moved t=
o
the fishing town after retiring and loved the tranquil way of life there,
neighbors said.

The 76-year-old Devine drowned when Ike sent water barreling through his
house, picking him off the second-story porch and dropping him a block away=
.
Days later, Devine's empty home still bore the scars of the storm =97
shattered windows, twisted wood, and his boat, the Seabar, jammed under the
front steps.

His daughter left a warning and a memorial in orange spray paint: "Jim
Devine. No Trespassing."

Port Bolivar held special meaning for 79-year-old Marian Violet Arrambide.
She met her husband there during World War II. Many years later, he built
the beach house where they could retire.

Arrambide, a retired nurse suffering the onset of dementia, lived with her
daughter, Magdalena Strickland, and nephew, Shane Williams, in that beach
house before Ike struck.

All three have been missing since the morning of Sept. 12, just as Ike bega=
n
to come ashore.

"My sister said 'I'm walking out the door in a hurry. Everything's taken
care of, I'll see you in a few hours.' That was it," said son Raul
Arrambide, describing a 6:15 a.m. phone call.

Since then, Arrambide has had little luck getting help or information.
Instead, Arrambide said, he's been passed from one agency to another.

"They send you back and forth until you're worn out," said Arrambide, his
voice showing the strain of the last weeks.

After five days with no word and no answers, Arrambide borrowed a boat to
search the area himself, but sheriff's deputies turned people away. He
finally found a local contractor who is helping search for missing
residents. That man found his relatives' vehicles, which had been washed of=
f
the road into a tree grove.

"I want to keep the hope that they are still alive, but by not hearing from
any of them, that hope is getting smaller and smaller," he said. "They
helped people all their lives. They did not deserve to go this way."

 most of america voted against the ridiculous $700 billion bail-out / scam
attempt by paulson for his rich wall street buddies - 66%voted against
bail-out according to a national poll, and now eventop economists are
confessing: the $700 billion bail-out plan will
do nothing for most americans aside ensuring that the white house
will be atleast $700 billion in the hole when either mccaine or obama
enter the white house!  and of course, it will make sure those who
really do need the money, like the iowa flood victims, the new orleans

hurricane victims, the galveston, texas flood victims, the cali wildfire

victims, and the cali trainwreck victims will get nothing!  plus, there

had been talks down south of people wanting to shoot paulson for

#postComment>

At last, there were public figures prepared to reject the political and
financial blackmail of a debased White House-Wall Street elite.

This is an unfashionable view; it runs counter to The Daily Telegraph's
editorial line. But the hard-sell of President Bush and the US Treasury
Secretary felt too much like the pressure patter of a door-to-door hawker.
Their message was crude: "Trust us. You are in a terrible place. Only we ca=
n
get you out of this mess. No need to check the details. Hurry now, or it
will be too late. Here's a pen. There's the dotted line. Just sign."

But with the President's ratings so low, few would let him leave the House
with anything more than small change. Congress asked, not unreasonably: "If
you guys know so much about banking, how come we are in such trouble?"

Having spent most of the year telling America, contrary to mounting
evidence, that the US economy was just dandy, Mr Bush's credibility is
threadbare. When making statements, he's beginning to look as if he doesn't
even believe himself. As for Mr Paulson, his long association with the
jackpot culture of Goldman Sachs is, in the eyes of many outsiders, a gilde=
d
millstone.

Predictably, the refuseniks have been pilloried as ill-informed nihilists.
They have been lambasted for failing to understand the consequences of thei=
r
actions. They are, according to the Big Bail-out Brigade, condemning the
rest of us to be buried alive in the rubble of a disintegrating banking
system.

Try a different take. Yes, the West's financial infrastructure is in severe
distress. Yes, more banks are going to crumble. Yes, there will be a
recession. But allocating $700bn (it would almost certainly turn out to be
more) to a clean-up programme for toxic assets, in effect socialising the
poison of private greed, has no merit other than to delay the inevitable. N=
o
amount of federal cash can rewind the X-rated horror video.

There is a conspiracy of bankers and politicians whose self-interest is
masquerading as sophisticated policy. They want us to believe that they hav=
e
the keys to salvation. I have not seen a scrap of evidence to confirm this.

There will, of course, be a renewed effort in Washington to push through a
package of national deliverance. Concessions will be made. The US taxpayer
will be offered improved terms. And, having made their point, having stood
up for "traditional American values", some of the naysayers in the House of
Representatives will cross over, enabling a deal to be done. Their
consciences will be salved, but the crisis will not be solved.

Meanwhile, in Britain, the ban on short-selling bank shares has done nothin=
g
to make them more attractive to investors. Having blamed hedge funds for
driving down the price of supposedly healthy businesses, officials must be
at a loss to explain why bank shares keep falling.

Halifax-Bank of Scotland dropped another 14pc yesterday to 122p. There is
now a yawning gap, about =A33bn, between the offer made by Lloyds TSB and
HBOS's stock market capitalisation. This is the share price's way of tellin=
g
us that it doesn't think the takeover is going to happen.

Both boards insist the deal will go ahead, but shareholders may have other
ideas. Which is a shame, because the creation of Lloyds-TSB-HBOS would help
perform the much-needed service of consolidating a bloated industry,
clearing out thousands of unwanted bankers, and ridding our high streets of
too many branches. It baffles me that we're closing Post Offices (2,500 out
of 14,000 to go) and yet we have a multiplicity of banks.

I recently visited Kingston-upon-Thames, where there is a blight of banks i=
n
the centre. On one street alone, there were five or six. I checked online
and discovered that in this one wealthy town there are three Barclays, two
HSBCs, plus branches of Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Cheltenham &
Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester, Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, Lloyds
TSB, Co-operative Bank, Abbey, NatWest, Household Bank, and Beneficial
Finance =96 I may have missed a couple.

This, perhaps, will surprise you, but traditional banking =96 collecting
retail deposits and making loans to ordinary customers =96 is barely
profitable. Compared with the potential gains from a day at the
currency-swap races, or a night in the derivatives casino, current accounts
are cold potatoes. That is why bonus-hungry executives, at what we used to
think of as boring banks, were so keen to spin the red-hot wheel of fortune=
.


In these troubled times, protecting customers, especially depositors, is th=
e
right thing to do. The Government should extend the guarantee it has given
to Northern Rock to all bank deposits. Beyond that, however, Britain's
over-banked economy needs a Malthusian cull.

it's true, some texans in galveston had gone without food and water and

USAF was used to pull people off roofs.  one helicopter was shot down black

the situation in galveston, texas is just as bad as katrina with similar

U.S. lawmakers on Sunday were set to sign off on a deal to create a $700
billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing banks in a bid to stem =
a
credit crisis threatening the global economy.

"They want to help the banks and not help the poor," Lula said late on
Saturday in Sao Paulo during a campaign rally ahead of Oct. 5 municipal
elections.

"Why give $700 billion to the banks and no money to the poor guys who lost
their houses," Lula asked, according to local media. He referred to the
troubled U.S. housing market.

The former factory worker, who obtained record approval ratings this month,
said the United States had the primary responsibility to fix a crisis with
global repercussions that it had caused.

"I'm not at fault if they turned their economy into a casino," Lula said in
reference to accusations that lax U.S. financial regulations worsened the
crisis.

Brazil was in a better position to withstand the crisis than it was years
ago, the former union leader said.

"I don't want to say we're at ease but ... today we depend less on the
United States for our exports," Lula said.

Brazil's economy is growing by more than 5 percent annually but is expected
to slow to around 4 percent growth next year. A few Brazilian exporters
announced last week large derivatives losses related to currency
fluctuations caused by the global financial crisis.

ABC News' Tahman Bradley and Arnab Datta Report: Former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., on Sunday described Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's
request for billions of dollars to buy debt from struggling Wall Street
financial firms as "un-American" and said the secretary should have stepped
down.

Gingrich even expressed concern with Paulson's connections to Wall Street.
The treasury secretary served as the chairman of a major global investment
banking and securities firm before joining the Bush administration.

"You have the former Chairman of Goldman Sachs asking for 700 billion
dollars, and in his initial request, asking for it in such an un-American
way that I think he should have resigned," said Gingrich. "I think Paulson
has terminally misunderstood the nature of the American system. Not just no
review, no judicial review, no congressional accountability. Give me 700
billion dollars, 700 BILLION dollars! 'I'll be glad to spend it for you.'
That's a centralization of power that is totally un-American."

Islanders who insisted on staying died in Ike

 By MONICA RHOR, Associated Press Writer *Sat Oct 4, 1:58 PM ET*

GALVESTON, Texas - The final hours brought the awful realization to victims
of Hurricane Ike that they had waited too long. This storm wasn't like the
others, the ones that left nothing worse than a harrowing tale to tell.

George Helmond, a hardy Galveston salt, watched the water rise and told a
buddy: I was born on this island and I'll die on this island.

Gail Ettenger, a free spirit who adopted the Bolivar Peninsula as her home
15 years ago, told a friend in a last phone call: I really messed up this
time.

Within hours, the old salt and the free spirit were gone as the powerful
Category 2 hurricane wracked the Texas Gulf Coast on Sept. 13, flattening
houses, obliterating entire towns and claiming at least 33 lives.

The dead =97 as young as 4, as old as 79 =97 included lifelong Galvestonian=
s
firmly rooted on the island and transplants drawn by the quiet of coastal
living.

Seven people drowned in a storm surge that moved in earlier and with more
ferocity than expected. Nine others died in the grimy, sweaty aftermath,
when lack of power and medicine exacted its toll. Eleven people were
poisoned by carbon monoxide or killed in fires from the generators they use=
d
in their own attempts to survive.

Hundreds of people remain missing three weeks after Ike's assault on Texas.
Local and city officials are no longer keeping their own count of missing
residents, and the estimate varies wildly from one agency to another.

According to the nonprofit Laura Recovery Center, about 300 people are
missing. Of those, about 200 from Galveston. However, the number "goes up
and down by the minute" as people call in to remove or add names, cautioned
executive director Bob Walcutt.

Some vanished during the evacuation of towns in the storm's path. Many were
last heard in desperate, last-ditch calls for help.

Immediately after the hurricane, Galveston officials conducted door-to-door
searches for survivors and possible victims. But the city is no longer
taking an active role in the search, city spokeswoman Alicia Cahill said.

Instead, search teams of sheriff's deputies, volunteer firefighters and
special K-9 search and recovery units have been using airboats and
all-terrain vehicles to sift through debris fields, tangled and fetid
marshlands, and the rubble left behind by Ike.

Bodies could have been tossed anywhere in the marshes, where thickets of
trees are littered with the contents of houses. Refrigerators, office
chairs, and television sets are scattered everywhere __ in the mud, in
bushes, on treetops.

"We are definitely looking and are going to do anything we can to find them=
,
but there may not be any answers to be given," said Galveston County
emergency management spokesman Colin Rizzo. "There are definitely going to
be people from Hurricane Ike that are never found."

Gail Ettenger stumbled upon her house in Gilchrist by accident. But once sh=
e
saw the site on the bay side of Bolivar Peninsula, she knew she would never
leave.

Ettenger, a native of New Jersey, instilled the house with her own energy
and style. The 58-year-old's garden bloomed with vibrant birds-of-paradise.

And Reba, an 11-year-old Great Dane hobbled by arthritis, was her baby.
Ettenger loved to treat the dog to dinners of chicken and roast beef,
recalled JoAnne Burks, Ettenger's neighbor and close friend.

Ettenger, a chemist at ExxonMobil, didn't evacuate, reasoning that her hous=
e
had weathered Hurricane Rita in 2005 without a problem. She also did not
want to leave Reba, who could no longer climb into Ettenger's Jeep.

Burks and her husband pleaded with Ettenger to change her mind. But she
insisted.

Hours before Ike made landfall, Ettenger knew she had made the wrong choice=
.
She called Burks and described the water pushing up under her feet, the
propane tanks and other household items drifting by her windows, and
wondered which would float better: her Jeep or her house.

Her voice was shaky with fear, Burks said.

Burks spent the next 10 days searching for her friend, calling local, count=
y
and state officials without success. She tried the American Red Cross, FEMA=
,
even private investigators.

"I didn't want her to wind up like the victims of Katrina, who were never
found or identified," Burks said.

Ettenger's body was found Sept. 23, tossed on a debris field in a Chambers
County marsh about 10 miles from her house.

Amid the muck and remnants of homes, Burks found a pink leather collar. The
name Reba was spelled out in rhinestones.

At 72, George Helmond had ridden out many storms and thought he could take
on Ike, too, neighbor Don Hanson said. "A lot of old Galvestonians are like
that."

Helmond had been one of the first residents of Sydnor Lane, which overlooks
a bayou on one side and a golf course on the other. A retired electrician,
Helmond was a die-hard fisherman, a dove hunter and straight-shooter
intensely proud of his Galveston roots.

Around 10 a.m., Helmond called Hanson, who had already left, to say the
water had already slipped over the road and toward his house. The street =
=97
the only way out of the neighborhood =97 was already impassable.

At 9:30 p.m., Helmond and Hanson talked for the last time. By then, the
water had pummeled through Helmond's garage, crushing the doors and
submerging his Cadillac. Hanson begged his friend to grab a life vest at hi=
s
house or to seek shelter there.

But at 2:30 a.m., for reasons no one knows, Helmond got in his pickup truck
and drove off at the height of Ike's fury.

Neighbors found Helmond's body the next day inside the truck, which had
slammed into the white golf course fence. The windshield was shattered.

Helmond's home suffered little damage. The water had reached above the
first-floor garage, but not inside the house.

"If he had stayed home and hadn't gone out, he'd be OK, but he panicked,"
said Hanson, 66. "Life goes on, but I will miss a good friend and I will
think about him."

_____

Even as Ike bore down on Texas, Jim Devine refused to leave his
cream-colored house within sight of the bay in San Leon. Devine had moved t=
o
the fishing town after retiring and loved the tranquil way of life there,
neighbors said.

The 76-year-old Devine drowned when Ike sent water barreling through his
house, picking him off the second-story porch and dropping him a block away=
.
Days later, Devine's empty home still bore the scars of the storm =97
shattered windows, twisted wood, and his boat, the Seabar, jammed under the
front steps.

His daughter left a warning and a memorial in orange spray paint: "Jim
Devine. No Trespassing."

Port Bolivar held special meaning for 79-year-old Marian Violet Arrambide.
She met her husband there during World War II. Many years later, he built
the beach house where they could retire.

Arrambide, a retired nurse suffering the onset of dementia, lived with her
daughter, Magdalena Strickland, and nephew, Shane Williams, in that beach
house before Ike struck.

All three have been missing since the morning of Sept. 12, just as Ike bega=
n
to come ashore.

"My sister said 'I'm walking out the door in a hurry. Everything's taken
care of, I'll see you in a few hours.' That was it," said son Raul
Arrambide, describing a 6:15 a.m. phone call.

Since then, Arrambide has had little luck getting help or information.
Instead, Arrambide said, he's been passed from one agency to another.

"They send you back and forth until you're worn out," said Arrambide, his
voice showing the strain of the last weeks.

After five days with no word and no answers, Arrambide borrowed a boat to
search the area himself, but sheriff's deputies turned people away. He
finally found a local contractor who is helping search for missing
residents. That man found his relatives' vehicles, which had been washed of=
f
the road into a tree grove.

"I want to keep the hope that they are still alive, but by not hearing from
any of them, that hope is getting smaller and smaller," he said. "They
helped people all their lives. They did not deserve to go this way."

#postComment>

At last, there were public figures prepared to reject the political and
financial blackmail of a debased White House-Wall Street elite.

This is an unfashionable view; it runs counter to The Daily Telegraph's
editorial line. But the hard-sell of President Bush and the US Treasury
Secretary felt too much like the pressure patter of a door-to-door hawker.
Their message was crude: "Trust us. You are in a terrible place. Only we ca=
n
get you out of this mess. No need to check the details. Hurry now, or it
will be too late. Here's a pen. There's the dotted line. Just sign."

But with the President's ratings so low, few would let him leave the House
with anything more than small change. Congress asked, not unreasonably: "If
you guys know so much about banking, how come we are in such trouble?"

Having spent most of the year telling America, contrary to mounting
evidence, that the US economy was just dandy, Mr Bush's credibility is
threadbare. When making statements, he's beginning to look as if he doesn't
even believe himself. As for Mr Paulson, his long association with the
jackpot culture of Goldman Sachs is, in the eyes of many outsiders, a gilde=
d
millstone.

Predictably, the refuseniks have been pilloried as ill-informed nihilists.
They have been lambasted for failing to understand the consequences of thei=
r
actions. They are, according to the Big Bail-out Brigade, condemning the
rest of us to be buried alive in the rubble of a disintegrating banking
system.

Try a different take. Yes, the West's financial infrastructure is in severe
distress. Yes, more banks are going to crumble. Yes, there will be a
recession. But allocating $700bn (it would almost certainly turn out to be
more) to a clean-up programme for toxic assets, in effect socialising the
poison of private greed, has no merit other than to delay the inevitable. N=
o
amount of federal cash can rewind the X-rated horror video.

There is a conspiracy of bankers and politicians whose self-interest is
masquerading as sophisticated policy. They want us to believe that they hav=
e
the keys to salvation. I have not seen a scrap of evidence to confirm this.

There will, of course, be a renewed effort in Washington to push through a
package of national deliverance. Concessions will be made. The US taxpayer
will be offered improved terms. And, having made their point, having stood
up for "traditional American values", some of the naysayers in the House of
Representatives will cross over, enabling a deal to be done. Their
consciences will be salved, but the crisis will not be solved.

Meanwhile, in Britain, the ban on short-selling bank shares has done nothin=
g
to make them more attractive to investors. Having blamed hedge funds for
driving down the price of supposedly healthy businesses, officials must be
at a loss to explain why bank shares keep falling.

Halifax-Bank of Scotland dropped another 14pc yesterday to 122p. There is
now a yawning gap, about =A33bn, between the offer made by Lloyds TSB and
HBOS's stock market capitalisation. This is the share price's way of tellin=
g
us that it doesn't think the takeover is going to happen.

Both boards insist the deal will go ahead, but shareholders may have other
ideas. Which is a shame, because the creation of Lloyds-TSB-HBOS would help
perform the much-needed service of consolidating a bloated industry,
clearing out thousands of unwanted bankers, and ridding our high streets of
too many branches. It baffles me that we're closing Post Offices (2,500 out
of 14,000 to go) and yet we have a multiplicity of banks.

I recently visited Kingston-upon-Thames, where there is a blight of banks i=
n
the centre. On one street alone, there were five or six. I checked online
and discovered that in this one wealthy town there are three Barclays, two
HSBCs, plus branches of Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Cheltenham &
Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester, Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, Lloyds
TSB, Co-operative Bank, Abbey, NatWest, Household Bank, and Beneficial
Finance =96 I may have missed a couple.

This, perhaps, will surprise you, but traditional banking =96 collecting
retail deposits and making loans to ordinary customers =96 is barely
profitable. Compared with the potential gains from a day at the
currency-swap races, or a night in the derivatives casino, current accounts
are cold potatoes. That is why bonus-hungry executives, at what we used to
think of as boring banks, were so keen to spin the red-hot wheel of fortune=
.


In these troubled times, protecting customers, especially depositors, is th=
e
right thing to do. The Government should extend the guarantee it has given
to Northern Rock to all bank deposits. Beyond that, however, Britain's
over-banked economy needs a Malthusian cull.

it's true, some texans in galveston had gone without food and water and
electricity
or phone for days until, finally i got rod parsley from columbus, ohio to
truck in tons
of free food and water for the struggling people there.  i was the one who
posted
satellite images of the hurricane before it made land fall and initially
gave the
command to deploy national guard and coast guard to get the people out of
there
and pull people off roofs there just as i was the one who did it during
katrina when
USAF was used to pull people off roofs.  one helicopter was shot down black
hawk
down style by a crazy old black man apparently high on cocaine and thinking
the
helicopter was coming to take him to jail.  some black gang members had
killed
cops to hi-jack their cars to drive into stores to loot them.  even when th=
e
army corp.
of engineers went in to fix the levees, they were shot at by dark tares.
Honore of the
Army and Thad Allen of the Coast Guard were tremendous at using ground unit=
s
to get people out of their flooded homes. celebrities like oprah winfrey,
john travolta,
sean penn, harry connick jr., and bono helped out the most afterwards.  as
did bush
sr., barbara, laura, and FEMA despite brown getting fired.  Chase gave out
$5000
debit cards.  Red Cross covered stay in hotels for victims for a year.  i
hooked up
Carnival Cruise as temporary living quarters of new orleans fire and police
dept.
who were home-less for months as well.  totally new orleans has gotten $188
billion
in federal financial assistance, but some of it went to scam artists who
claimed
they lived in new orleans and really did not.  they basically cashed their
compensation
checks and went shopping!

the situation in galveston, texas is just as bad as katrina with similar
slow response
and some very disgruntled people.  imagine how they feel about paulson
embezzeling
$700 billion for his rich wall street buddies while they had been starving
in texas!

Islanders who insisted on staying died in Ike

 By MONICA RHOR, Associated Press Writer *Sat Oct 4, 1:58 PM ET*

GALVESTON, Texas - The final hours brought the awful realization to victims
of Hurricane Ike that they had waited too long. This storm wasn't like the
others, the ones that left nothing worse than a harrowing tale to tell.

George Helmond, a hardy Galveston salt, watched the water rise and told a
buddy: I was born on this island and I'll die on this island.

Gail Ettenger, a free spirit who adopted the Bolivar Peninsula as her home
15 years ago, told a friend in a last phone call: I really messed up this
time.

Within hours, the old salt and the free spirit were gone as the powerful
Category 2 hurricane wracked the Texas Gulf Coast on Sept. 13, flattening
houses, obliterating entire towns and claiming at least 33 lives.

The dead =97 as young as 4, as old as 79 =97 included lifelong Galvestonian=
s
firmly rooted on the island and transplants drawn by the quiet of coastal
living.

Seven people drowned in a storm surge that moved in earlier and with more
ferocity than expected. Nine others died in the grimy, sweaty aftermath,
when lack of power and medicine exacted its toll. Eleven people were
poisoned by carbon monoxide or killed in fires from the generators they use=
d
in their own attempts to survive.

Hundreds of people remain missing three weeks after Ike's assault on Texas.
Local and city officials are no longer keeping their own count of missing
residents, and the estimate varies wildly from one agency to another.

According to the nonprofit Laura Recovery Center, about 300 people are
missing. Of those, about 200 from Galveston. However, the number "goes up
and down by the minute" as people call in to remove or add names, cautioned
executive director Bob Walcutt.

Some vanished during the evacuation of towns in the storm's path. Many were
last heard in desperate, last-ditch calls for help.

Immediately after the hurricane, Galveston officials conducted door-to-door
searches for survivors and possible victims. But the city is no longer
taking an active role in the search, city spokeswoman Alicia Cahill said.

Instead, search teams of sheriff's deputies, volunteer firefighters and
special K-9 search and recovery units have been using airboats and
all-terrain vehicles to sift through debris fields, tangled and fetid
marshlands, and the rubble left behind by Ike.

Bodies could have been tossed anywhere in the marshes, where thickets of
trees are littered with the contents of houses. Refrigerators, office
chairs, and television sets are scattered everywhere __ in the mud, in
bushes, on treetops.

"We are definitely looking and are going to do anything we can to find them=

but there may not be any answers to be given," said Galveston County
emergency management spokesman Colin Rizzo. "There are definitely going to
be people from Hurricane Ike that are never found."

really do need the money, like the iowa flood victims, the new orleans

hurricane victims, the galveston, texas flood victims, the cali wildfire

victims, and the cali trainwreck victims will get nothing!  plus, there

had been talks down south of people wanting to shoot paulson for

being such a blatant greedy scam artist while real americans in need

suffered!

Why propping up banks will not rescue a debauched financial system
Confession time. As 228 Representatives in Congress voted against Hank
Paulson's bail-out plan on Monday, I was cheering them on.

#postComment>

At last, there were public figures prepared to reject the political and
financial blackmail of a debased White House-Wall Street elite.

This is an unfashionable view; it runs counter to The Daily Telegraph's
editorial line. But the hard-sell of President Bush and the US Treasury
Secretary felt too much like the pressure patter of a door-to-door hawker.
Their message was crude: "Trust us. You are in a terrible place. Only we ca=
n
get you out of this mess. No need to check the details. Hurry now, or it
will be too late. Here's a pen. There's the dotted line. Just sign."

But with the President's ratings so low, few would let him leave the House
with anything more than small change. Congress asked, not unreasonably: "If
you guys know so much about banking, how come we are in such trouble?"

Having spent most of the year telling America, contrary to mounting
evidence, that the US economy was just dandy, Mr Bush's credibility is
threadbare. When making statements, he's beginning to look as if he doesn't
even believe himself. As for Mr Paulson, his long association with the
jackpot culture of Goldman Sachs is, in the eyes of many outsiders, a gilde=
d
millstone.

Predictably, the refuseniks have been pilloried as ill-informed nihilists.
They have been lambasted for failing to understand the consequences of thei=
r
actions. They are, according to the Big Bail-out Brigade, condemning the
rest of us to be buried alive in the rubble of a disintegrating banking
system.

Try a different take. Yes, the West's financial infrastructure is in severe
distress. Yes, more banks are going to crumble. Yes, there will be a
recession. But allocating $700bn (it would almost certainly turn out to be
more) to a clean-up programme for toxic assets, in effect socialising the
poison of private greed, has no merit other than to delay the inevitable. N=
o
amount of federal cash can rewind the X-rated horror video.

There is a conspiracy of bankers and politicians whose self-interest is
masquerading as sophisticated policy. They want us to believe that they hav=
e
the keys to salvation. I have not seen a scrap of evidence to confirm this.

There will, of course, be a renewed effort in Washington to push through a
package of national deliverance. Concessions will be made. The US taxpayer
will be offered improved terms. And, having made their point, having stood
up for "traditional American values", some of the naysayers in the House of
Representatives will cross over, enabling a deal to be done. Their
consciences will be salved, but the crisis will not be solved.

Meanwhile, in Britain, the ban on short-selling bank shares has done nothin=
g
to make them more attractive to investors. Having blamed hedge funds for
driving down the price of supposedly healthy businesses, officials must be
at a loss to explain why bank shares keep falling.

Halifax-Bank of Scotland dropped another 14pc yesterday to 122p. There is
now a yawning gap, about =A33bn, between the offer made by Lloyds TSB and
HBOS's stock market capitalisation. This is the share price's way of tellin=
g
us that it doesn't think the takeover is going to happen.

Both boards insist the deal will go ahead, but shareholders may have other
ideas. Which is a shame, because the creation of Lloyds-TSB-HBOS would help
perform the much-needed service of consolidating a bloated industry,
clearing out thousands of unwanted bankers, and ridding our high streets of
too many branches. It baffles me that we're closing Post Offices (2,500 out
of 14,000 to go) and yet we have a multiplicity of banks.

I recently visited Kingston-upon-Thames, where there is a blight of banks i=
n
the centre. On one street alone, there were five or six. I checked online
and discovered that in this one wealthy town there are three Barclays, two
HSBCs, plus branches of Royal Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Cheltenham &
Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester, Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, Lloyds
TSB, Co-operative Bank, Abbey, NatWest, Household Bank, and Beneficial
Finance =96 I may have missed a couple.

This, perhaps, will surprise you, but traditional banking =96 collecting
retail deposits and making loans to ordinary customers =96 is barely
profitable. Compared with the potential gains from a day at the
currency-swap races, or a night in the derivatives casino, current accounts
are cold potatoes. That is why bonus-hungry executives, at what we used to
think of as boring banks, were so keen to spin the red-hot wheel of fortune=
.


In these troubled times, protecting customers, especially depositors, is th=
e
right thing to do. The Government should extend the guarantee it has given
to Northern Rock to all bank deposits. Beyond that, however, Britain's
over-banked economy needs a Malthusian cull.

Subject: Other Countries Mock US For Giving Money to Rich in NY When Texans
Had Been Starving...
Date: Monday, September 29, 2008, 2:24 AM

it's true, some texans in galveston had gone without food and water and
electricity
or phone for days until, finally i got rod parsley from columbus, ohio to
truck in tons
of free food and water for the struggling people there.  i was the one who
posted
satellite images of the hurricane before it made land fall and initially
gave the
command to deploy national guard and coast guard to get the people out of
there
and pull people off roofs there just as i was the one who did it during
katrina when
USAF was used to pull people off roofs.  one helicopter was shot down black
hawk
down style by a crazy old black man apparently high on cocaine and thinking
the
helicopter was coming to take him to jail.  some black gang members had
killed
cops to hi-jack their cars to drive into stores to loot them.  even when th=
e
army corp.
of engineers went in to fix the levees, they were shot at by dark tares.
Honore of the
Army and Thad Allen of the Coast Guard were tremendous at using ground unit=
s
to get people out of their flooded homes. celebrities like oprah winfrey,
john travolta,
sean penn, harry connick jr., and bono helped out the most afterwards.  as
did bush
sr., barbara, laura, and FEMA despite brown getting fired.  Chase gave out
$5000
debit cards.  Red Cross covered stay in hotels for victims for a year.  i
hooked up
Carnival Cruise as temporary living quarters of new orleans fire and police
dept.
who were home-less for months as well.  totally new orleans has gotten $188
billion
in federal financial assistance, but some of it went to scam artists who
claimed
they lived in new orleans and really did not.  they basically cashed their
compensation
checks and went shopping!

the situation in galveston, texas is just as bad as katrina with similar
slow response
and some very disgruntled people.  imagine how they feel about paulson
embezzeling
$700 billion for his rich wall street buddies while they had been starving
in texas!

previously i wrote:

due to previous security problems (9 people shot in the oakland,
california area during a halloween party (black gang members
pissed about a girl who dumped a black DJ to date an asian
DJ broke into the party and shot 9 people), black NBC reporter
shot by a black gang member drive-by shooter when he was
reporting a crime in a bad part of san francisco, my getting
physically threatened by a known nazi cyber-terrorist by the
name of troutpoop in ohio when i promoted for love fest SF
last year on pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org (as a result, troutpoop
got a visit from a US military SWAT team since i am a former
military recruiter of the USAF, army, navy, and marines that
started west
 coast homeland security in 2003), love fest SF
party kid shot outside the billy graham civic auditoriom by a
black gang member
 trying to steal a car last year, death threats
on heather fung, san francisco police chief, who spearheaded
several brother busts in SF in response to black gang members
killing prostitutes over money disputes, etc.) and because i
started west coast homeland security in california in 2003, i have
decided to increase the security for love fest SF this year to include
the following...

1. heather fung, san francisco police chief, heading SFPD including
    using the mini golf cart style vehicles for crowd control and
    re-directing traffick at blocked sections of streets for the event

2. california national guard to do plain
 clothes undercover security
    during the event to help prevent any unwanted black gang member
    attacks like last year.

3. hells angels also doing undercover plain clothes security to prevent

 car jackings / bike jackings, etc. (i had previously used them to do
    security for california oktoberfest and they helped prevent tares who
    tried to steal my bike when corrupt parts of the fresno police dept.
    failed when they actually thought i was trying to steal my own bike
    at a KSEE NBC summer concert in the park event i had promoted
    for!  turned out the corrupt cop was the one who stole my honorary
    caliornia state trooper ID for security breaches!

4. san francisco 49'ers also doing some undercover plain clothes
    security.  the owner of the san francisco 49'ers is from the same
    town i was born in: youngstown, ohio.

5. q*bert to head international
 b-boys also doing some undercover
    security.  international b-boys were blessed by
 pope john paul II,
    and serve as secret service for the pope when he comes to
    america.  the ones behind  planet b-boy, the movie are korean
     b-boys who have won numerous international competitions.

6. once again, i will be in fresno, california for the after parties to
    serve as a pit stop for travelers from LA and back to LA, so they
    don't fall asleep at the wheel on the way back to LA, they can
    crash here.  just call me at: 559.940.5207 first!

due to previous security problems (9 people shot in the oakland,
california area during a halloween party (black gang members
pissed about a girl who dumped a black DJ to date an asian
DJ broke into the party and shot 9 people), black NBC reporter
shot by a black gang member drive-by shooter when he was
reporting a crime in a bad part of san francisco, my getting
physically threatened by a known nazi cyber-terrorist by the
name of troutpoop in ohio when i promoted for love fest SF
last year on pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org<http://us.mc589.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org>(as
a result, troutpoop
got a visit from a US military SWAT team since i am a former
military recruiter of the USAF, army, navy, and marines that
started west coast homeland security in 2003), love fest SF
party kid shot outside the billy graham civic auditoriom by a
black gang member trying to steal a car last year, death threats
on heather fung, san francisco police chief, who spearheaded
several brother busts in SF in response to black gang members
killing prostitutes over money disputes, etc.) and because i
started west coast homeland security in california in 2003, i have
decided to increase the security for love fest SF this year to include
the following...

1. heather fung, san francisco police chief, heading SFPD including
    using the mini golf cart style vehicles for crowd control and
    re-directing traffick at blocked sections of streets for the event

2. california national guard to do plain clothes undercover security
    during the event to help prevent any unwanted black gang member
    attacks like last year.

3. hells angels also doing undercover plain clothes security to prevent
    car jackings / bike jackings, etc. (i had previously used them to do
    security for california oktoberfest and they helped prevent tares who
    tried to steal my bike when corrupt parts of the fresno police dept.
    failed when they actually thought i was trying to steal my own bike
    at a KSEE NBC summer concert in the park event i had promoted
    for!  turned out the corrupt cop was the one who stole my honorary
    caliornia state trooper ID for security breaches!

4. san francisco 49'ers also doing some undercover plain clothes
    security.  the owner of the san francisco 49'ers is from the same
    town i was born in: youngstown, ohio.

5. q*bert to head international b-boys also doing some undercover
    security.  international b-boys were blessed by pope john paul II,

I've been doing LOTS of bartering already.  FUCK the private treasury.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: FoxNEWS taking a live poll of obama vs. mccain...  NOT

Watch the video and listen to the reporter.  He takes a show of hands for Obama 
vs. McCain at a Pennsylvania diner.

Basically the whole room raises their hand for Obama, then the camera pans to 
the FoxNEWS reporter who says "see, it's split...  which is why pennsylvania is 
a battleground state" and the whole room can be heard chuckling in the 
background.  The comment with the video points out that a woman pulls down the 
hand of her husband who raises it for mccain.

This week the US Treasury released $1.48 trillion dollars, (3x times what
we've spent in the last 5 and a half years in Iraq), of taxpayer money to
Wall Street, (there was a shadow bail-out of $630 billion dollars that got
practically no press attention
http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&tab=wn&ned=&ie=UTF-8&ncl=1252614839 ), on
top of the $850 billion dollars that everyone knows about.

All three major stock markets closed on Friday below the level they were at
the day George Bush became President in January of 2001.

http://silencedmajority.blogs.com/silenced_majority_portal/2008/10/clinton-vs-bush.html

What does this mean for you, the average taxpayer?

Annual per capita income in the United States is currently $46 thousand
dollars and there are 138 million taxpayers, so $1.48 trillion divided by
138 million people averages out to just under $11,000 dollars per person, or
just under 25% of your annual income.

$11K a year averages out to the first $40 dollars you make at work each day
going to pay for this. For those making $46K it reduces your earnings from
$185 a day to $145 a day. If you're a minimum wage worker at $6.55 an hour
that will leave you with $12 at the end of the day, which will also be
taxed.

If you add the $1.5 trillion dollars that we also owe the Chinese you can
double those figures to 50%.

This does not include the $3 trillion dollar Federal Budget or interest
payments on US debt, or the monies that need to be spent on
rent/mortgages/gas/food by the average person. Add all that up too, and what
we're going to spend in Iraq, might as well, and one rapidly begins to
approach zero percent. Zero, as in nothing.

100 years ago the citizens of Russia under the Czars endured taxation rates
of 90% before they got fed up and had enough, it will be interesting to see
in the coming few years if American citizens will be as forgiving as
compliant as they were.

One positive thing we have learned from Bush and Palin being the polarizing
political figures that they are is that we now know, that no matter what
happens, and how much they abuse their own people, and take away from them
every single last thing that they have, leaders like that will always have
the full and blind support of 1/3rd of the population, no matter how much
direct evidence of how their own lives and livelihoods are being destroyed
outright in front of them presents itself to them.

Nope, these poor, crazy, deluded, willfully ignorant people will not only
swallow as much garbage as can be mercilessly shoveled down their throats by
their leaders, they will defend these power mad people to the ends of the
earth, vociferously attacking those that are trying to help them see this,
and then come back and ask for seconds.

I see evidence of that everyday on lists like this and all over the web
these days and it would be funny, instead of being the sad, shameful pity
that it is. Not to mention outright dangerous to the other 70% of the
population. Czarist/Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany and Mao's China all came
to a very bad end and millions upon millions of people were senselessly
murdered in the process of fulfilling their leader's insane ambitions.

Is that something any Good American wants to have happen here?

Why do I suspect it would have been better to give $11k to everyone in 
the nation instead of wallstreet.  ;)

Anyone behind on a mortgage should be level with that, or take care back 
debts.  Not huge ones, but clear out some student, car, or other debt.

As for wallstreet,  Don't that have to have hard assets backing them?  
Magin call boys, turn over your gold.

It's illegal to do that doug, the raids on the liberty dollar show us  
that alternate forms of exchange are illegal if the government  
doesn't like them or think they might be too much competition.  So  
what you should do so you don't anger the government god is tabulate  
how much you have traded and call the IRS on monday to ask them to  
make some new rules so you can pay taxes on that.

instead of embezzeling billions out of the federal reserve bankrupting
america to line the pockets of the already rich, dems should consider
the legal ways to raise funds i had posted on my rapture 2008 events list...

Rapture 2008 Events List...

WWE No Mercy! 2008 - Sunday Bloody Sunday, Oct. 5th - Portland, Oregon...
for the WWE title belt...

US federal reserve to take stephanie mcmahon and the mcmahon
family on thee holy mary cruise i posted on the celebrity millenium from
hawaii to new zealand scheduled from oct. 17 to nov. 7th or the queen
mary 2 cruise from NY to London sched. oct. 11, which i just posted to
help raise funds for struggling east coast businesses.
if jeff hardy wins, since his fav move is the swan dive, USAF gets to
bomb north africa for 1993 WTC bombing and 9/11 and because some
dark tares burned his house down killing his dog.  on oct. 9  if africa
fails to make first payment owed to me by oct. 9.  he would also get
$1 million for a new house.

heavyweight title belt...
if JBL wins, he'll get a million, which he can use for the queen mary 2

if Batista wins, since he's from DC and his fav move is the batista bomb,
than there will be no bail-out for NYC, USAF has the option of bombing
africa for 1993 bombing and 9/11, batista wil win the million to do as
he deems fit.
if Jericho wins, since he goes by Y2J and I was a part of the pre Y2K intell
team that helped save the world and made people like steve jobs (apple),
steve case (AOL), bill gates (microsoft), michale dell (dell computers), and

ellison (oracle) into billionaires, than computer companies shall donate

If Rey Mysterio wins, he keeps his mask on, and the million will go to the
cali train wreck victims.

Arizona fest 2008 - in the tradition of may day (actually a celtic
festival), cali
oktoberfest (which i promoted for the past 3 years including invitations  to
the
pope and his current secret service), and the desert parties that john kelly

(moonshine LA) used to do before burningman even started, having stopped
by meteor crater when my family moved from ohio to california in 1989, i had
always wanted to do a big event there, then visions of four x four'ing with
4
massive walls of sound facing each other battle of the bands style came to
mind.  nice vision.  maybe it'll come to pass.  we'll see...

Queen Mary 2 Cruise from NY to London - Oct. 11 - Oct. 22  - instead of
using
Paulson to embezzle so much federal funds, they can legally raise funds by
doing a Cruise to be hosted by Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, and the SNL crew.
I was the one that had to feng shui the CIA into a Queen Mary Cruise from NY

to London to avoid having to bomb Iran for Condi who claimed that Iran was
developing nuclear weapons in their nuclear power plants.  the cruise was
even capped off with a Nelly Furtado concert in London last year.

Dems have the audacity, they know the more money they try to scam thefederal
government out of (it was obama using paulson in a blatant attempt

to embezzle $700 billion for rich wall streeters claiming bankrupcy), the
less

will be left for real americans in need like the galveston, texans who had
been

flooded and lost their homes!  thank god, i am helping promote for voodoo

coming up in new orleans at the end of october to help raise funds for the

hurricane victims down south again (check http://thetenthritual.com).  i am

getting trent reznor to help as well.  he went to CIM when i went to CWRU

before moving in the manson house in new orleans.  he is someone who has

been a part of the underground scene from when i first started promoting for

events on WRUW 91.1 FM CWRU college radio in cleveland, ohio (home of

the rock and roll hall of fame designed by chinese architect i. m. pei in
1993)

since 1990 as opposed to dem lawyers that were behind the anti-rave
legislation

labeling all bar., club, and casino owners as mafia to justify illegal
search and

seizures and have infiltrated our internet mailing lists only to cite bogus
claims

of  spam for promoting real events to further line their own greedy
pockets!

here is the most recent reports of what galveston, texans went through while


the sneaky greedy dems have been trying to scam the federal government out
of

$700 billion for their rich wall street buddies and to line their own greedy
pockets!...

Yea, no, I hope it was pretty obvious I was just kidding, Doug,  and  
being ridiculous like I like to be, where I am not joking though is  
how the government selectively enforces things.

Hopefully, we can start shifting the conversations on these topics,  
this is not to say there shouldn't still be music and rave  
discussions, after all this is a rave list, it might seem I forget  
that but I don't; perhaps we can shift from the paradigm that the  
elites control everything, always have, always will, to ways to use  
non-violent means to resist, even avoid the traps set up by the fat  
cat bankers.

.

I spent a great deal of my childhood and adolescence visiting relatives that
were trapped behind the Soviet Iron Curtain in East Germany and other
Communist countries under Soviet domination and at the time everybody knew
that the Soviet was going to collapse, with the US to follow roughly the
same path 20 years later.

Turns out they were right on both accounts and Orlov pretty much nails it in
his piece. he's just got a book out on the subject and he goes much more in
depth than the PowerPoint presentation here on his blog, this article is a
good place to start: http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dtxqwqr_20dc52sm

Here's his blog link:
http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2006/05/dmitry-orlov.html

One indication I've been trying to point out to people in terms of
similarities between East Germany and the US is that in the last ten years
the citizens of the US have become just as fearful of the police as their
East German counterparts used to be.

That's more of a social indicator of bad shit, than an economic one, I know,
but I find it chilling as well.

Amazing. Nine minutes and forty seconds of pure bullshit.

Watch the crowd - like is anybody dancing? If this is a rave, McCain is a

Speedy J KILLED. a few of my friends just said this is so not kontrol 
but the paradox is that it was.. why can't it be like that all the time?

here are the WWE No Mercy 2008 Results...

HHH/The Game retains WWE title belt over challenger Jeff Hardy.  London has
the option to bomb africa if africa fails to make a $10 million payment to
me
(steve t 3169, the international intelligence director) by oct. 9 for
killing 52 brits
during the london bombing, killing 90 during the 1993 WTC bombing, black
hawk down, blowing up us embassy in kenya killing 200, 9/11 killing nearly
3000 in NYC masterminded by al quida jinx (an african american), spain train

bombing, burning 20 villages in france, 5 years of cali wildfires, tricking
america
into the war on iraq (costing america $1 trillion, over 4000 US soldiers
their lives,
over 30,000 injured mostly due to IED attacks caused by german WWII bomb
shells converted to IED's by al quida aka african immigrant terrorists after
an
arms deal between condi and merkel), re-nigging on paying me $10 billion for

$100 billion in new accounts africa got at WTO 2005 in china, and also for
killing
brits, americans, miss world fans, and catholic nuns in africa...HHH/The
Game
shall get $1 million from the $10 million payment i am supposed to get from
africa.  if africa fails to make payment to me by oct. 9, than london shall
be
authorized to start bombing africa until payments are made.

women's title belt result: beth phonex beats candice michelle due to
distraction
by santino.  beth phoenx shall get $1 million of $10 million payment i am
supposed
to get from africa.  if africa fails to make first payment to me by oct. 9,
than NYC
is authorized to fire all africans working in NYC for 9/11 and due to
obvious economic
problems caused by 9/11 and dark tares!

JBL v. Batista: Batista Beat JBL.  Batista shall get $1 million of the $10
million
payment i am suppossed to get from Africa.  If Africa fails to pay me by
oct. 9th,
since Batista is from DC and Batista's finishing move was the Batista bomb,
than Bush is authorized to start bombing Africa on Oct. 10.

Y2J  v. Michaels in Ladder Match: Jericho aka Y2J won.  since I was a part
of the
pre-Y2K intelligence team that made computer moguls like: steve jobs
(apple),
steve case (AOL), bill gates (microsoft), michael dell (dell computers),
ellison
(oracle) and all other computer and software companies that profited due to
Y2K,
each one must donate $1 million to me to fund the my new WTC project: Twain
Towers (check my site http://mobog.com/rapture3169, which i designed after
Freedom Tower failed federal security codes, and because nobody in NYC
trusts silverstein anymore suspecting him of being a part of 9/11 for a huge
insurance scam), once my new WTC plans are started, this will obviously pick
up the economy in NYC.  If Michaels had won, Lorne Michaels and the SNL cru
would've got the million, but i just posted another NY cruise to the
Carribeans
on a Princess Cruise ship, which i had delegated to: maria shriver kennedy
and Anne Hatheway (who was just on SNL last night) with mary watts to pick
the DJ line-up.  plus alec baldwin and tina fey got the queen mary 2 cruise
from
NY to London to host.  and i had previously posted the holy mary cruise from

hawaii to new zealand on a celebrity cruise to be hosted by natalie portman
and keisha castle hughes.  all three cruises should raise some funds for NY,
so that Paulson wouldn't have to embezzle billions in federal funds, saving
him from getting shot by some extremely pissed off galveston, texans, who
were neglected after a terrible natural disaster until i got rod parsley
from
columbus, ohio to bring in trucks full of food and water, but by then it was

kind of late, and all paulson and the DNC wanted to do was embezzle $700
billion for his rich wall street buddies neglecting the poor people in
texas, new
orleans, and california all due to terrible disasters.

ECW title belt: Mark Henry v. Matt Hardy - Matt Hardy with an amazing win
with
a twist of fate.  Matt Hardy to get $1 million from $10 million minimum
payment
i am supposed to get from Africa.  He may choose to give it to his brother
Jeff,
who lost his house and dog due to a bad fire caused by dark tares. If Africa
fails to make payment to me by Oct. 9th, than the Hardy boys are authorised
to do as they deem fit to retrieve funds from dark tares especially for
burning
houses down!

Big Show v. Undertaker - it appeared Big Show won by knockout, but after
reviewing the video, the two announcers, and myself being the judge could
see Big Show exposing a turn buckle while the Ref was distracted by the
Undertaker that he used to bash the Undertaker's head into (the exposed
buckle should've DQ'ed Big Show if the Ref had been paying attention)
followed by a series of deadly punches that knocked out Undertaker.  but
Undertaker didn't land on his back, he landed on his belly.  and Big Show
never turned him over to pin him.  and since the rules is a win has to be by

pinfall or submission, there was no win and there was no loss.  But since
Big Show walked off without finishing, Undertaker wins by forfeit.  As a
result,
Vickie Guerrero is fired from her position due to too many fans boo'ing her
every time she steps in the ring now and her firing the Undertaker when
that was never authorised by the owners especially since Undertaker has
been a main attraction and title belt holder for 16 Wrestlemania's now.
this is also very little compensation for mexicans stealing $209 million
from the asian investor for the lady guadelupe film and mexicans responsible
for causing trainwrecks in california to rob them with the last one killing
25
and the previous injuring 100.  since mexicans used the stolen $209 million
to start MTV tres.  every band on MTV Tres owes me 10% royalties from every
cd or album sold and from ticket sales from concerts.  if they don't pay me,
they may get a visit from the Undertaker or any other WWE wrestler, who
had been honorary members of west coast homeland security since the
WWE did a show for our troops in Iraq.

Kane v. Rey Mysterio: Kane knocks out Rey Mysterio with a steel chair in mid
air and then walks off without removing his mask.  Rey Mysterio wins by DQ.

i had said $1 million would go to the california train wreck victims if Rey
wins,
but since mexicans were responsible for stealing $209 million from the asian

investor of the lady guadelupe film and were responsible for causing two
train
wrecks in california that caused 100 injuries the first time and 25 deaths
the
second time just so mexicans could rob the trains, mexico must pay the cali
trainwreck victims atleast one million to cover hospital bills by oct. 9th,
if
mexico fails to pay a million to the cali trainwreck victims by oct. 9th,
than Kane
and other WWE wrestlers are authorised to do whatever is necessary to
mexicans
to retrieve stolen money intended for me for the lady guadelupe film,
causing 100
injuries due to the first cali trainwreck, and 25 deaths due to the second
cali train
wreck.

Date: Saturday, October 4, 2008, 4:02 PM

Dems have the audacity, they know the more money they try to scam the federal
government out of (it was obama using paulson in a blatant attempt

to embezzle $700 billion for rich wall streeters claiming bankrupcy), the
less

will be left for real americans in need like the galveston, texans who had
been

flooded and lost their homes!  thank god, i am helping promote for voodoo

coming up in new orleans at the end of october to help raise funds for the

hurricane victims down south again (check http://thetenthritual.com).  i am

getting trent reznor to help as well.  he went to CIM when i went to CWRU

before moving in the manson house in new orleans.  he is someone who has

been a part of the underground scene from when i first started promoting for

events on WRUW 91.1 FM CWRU college radio in cleveland, ohio (home of

the rock and roll hall of fame designed by chinese architect i. m. pei in
1993)

since 1990 as opposed to dem lawyers that were behind the anti-rave
legislation

labeling all bar., club, and casino owners as mafia to justify illegal
search and

seizures and have infiltrated our internet mailing lists only to cite bogus
claims

of  spam for promoting real events to further line their own greedy
pockets!

here is the most recent reports of what galveston, texans went through while


the sneaky greedy dems have been trying to scam the federal government out
of

$700 billion for their rich wall street buddies and to line their own greedy
pockets!...

 he shall come, saith=0Athe LORD of hosts.=0A2 - But who may abide the day =
of his coming? and who shall stand when he=0Aappeareth? for he [is] like a =
refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:=0A3 - And he shall sit [as] a refin=
er and purifier of silver: and he shall=0Apurify the sons of Levi, and purg=
e them as gold and silver, that they may=0Aoffer unto the LORD an offering =
in righteousness.=0A4 - Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be p=
leasant unto the=0ALORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.=0A5=
 - And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness=
=0Aagainst the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false=0As=
wearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in [his] wages, the=0A=
widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his=0Arig=

 change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not=0Aconsumed.=0A7 - Even from=
 the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine=0Aordinances, and have=
 not kept [them]. Return unto me, and I will return unto=0Ayou, saith the L=
ORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?=0A8 - Will a man rob Go=
d? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we=0Arobbed thee? In tit=

e, [even] this whole=0Anation.=0A10 - Bring ye all the tithes into the stor=

saith the LORD of hosts, if I will=0Anot open you the windows of heaven, an=
d pour you out a blessing, that [there=0Ashall] not [be room] enough [to re=

r fruit before the=0Atime in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.=0A12 - And=
 all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome=0Aland, =

- Ye have said, It [is] vain to serve God: and what profit [is it] that=0Aw=
e have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the=0A=
LORD of hosts?=0A15 - And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work =
wickedness are set=0Aup; yea, [they that] tempt God are even delivered.=0A1=

him=0Afor them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.=0A17 -=
 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I=0Amake=

 his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the=0Astall.=0A=

It was amusing for the 1st 1 or 2 messages, in that "hey, look at the 
new tweaker on the list" sort of way.  Now, not so much.

I have made just _one_ post to this list, totalling 4 sentences - how does
this make me a "spam machine"?

That one post commented on the video link that was posted by shatter, and
was rave-related. If this is "spam", shouldn't all of the NRR posts be
banned, as well as those who engage in flame wars, race-baiting, posting
malicious links, and exhibiting very un-rave-culture hostility in their
posts?

I would appreciate it if you would correct this.

Thank you for helping to keep this list focused on raves and rave culture,
and for helping to keep it a friendly and respectful place that we can all
enjoy.

Sorry Felis, the angry, flamey tone of your email lumped it in with all the bizarre troll stuff that's been popping up on the list of late, and in my haste, I forgot to differentiate you from the other shit I was complaining about.  The "Spam Machine" label was unwarranted, sorry.

Having one's first post be a diatribe tends to make people think you're some established troll creating new ghost accounts to further flame with.

Thanks very much! Sorry if my post came off as a troll - absolutely the
farthest thing from my intention.

I note that shatter did not care for the video either (his remark about
maybe 12 people attending if the like were presented here), so I had not
considered that my post would be taken for trolling, since it did not seem
to be a disagreement with anyone here.

I will definitely try to be more aware of my tone in the future so that my
posts aren't misunderstood.

I posted because I had watched the video and was disturbed by the Nazi-like
elements I saw, particularly so in the "related videos" section - there
seems to be a conscious insertion of Nazi imagery. The skull logo and flags
strongly resemble some SS decorations, the "Y"-shaped logo as a backdrop in
one of the videos is very like the logo of the white-supremacist National
Vanguard - google that, and if you aren't afraid of losing your breakfast,
google "Romanian National Vanguard" - sickening stuff, but it is good to
check out to be reminded just how sick and crazy the world can be.

And there is a connection between _some_  gabba artists and white supremacy,
so it caused some concern for me. We don't want such negative things
inserting themselves into our culture.

Stuff like the Romanian site really makes me appreciate even more the
inclusive, loving, respectful, unifying culture of rave.

Thank you again, and again my apologies if my post came off as a troll. I
will be more thoughtful in the future.

Yes, because black people (the singers for RTC) have always been big 
supporters of Neo Nazi's.

Nazi's weren't the first to use skulls, nor did they invent the 
swastika.  Since you assume the use of a skull signifies neo-nazism I'm 
surprised you have brought Hot Topic up as a Hilter Youth Outfitting Center.

As for "Gabber" it's hard and it's fast.  Pointing to one genre and 
drawing connections is narrow minded, as there have been neo-nazi 
influenced on Punk, metal, and country music to name but a few.

I pointed out about 12 people showing up in the bay area because the 
only thing anyone seems to give two shits about is shitty house music 
and of late, canned $59 keyboard drum beats (what some are calling 
minimum techno, and what i would ask is "more techno less minimal you 
lazy fuck").  Trace has become a dirty word because of the zombies that 
practice DJ worship at the alter of Fail.  So, what's left?  Breaks?  I 
can dig that, but then again you get the mass drone of house heads 
bitching about "we want house....  we want house.....  we want house...  
my E is wearing off....."

Not that I'm jaded or anything.

If you like Hardcore/Gabber then that's fine, as everyone is free to 
enjoy what they will.  Godwins law was already invoked in your initial 
retort thus it was going to go unanswered, however, since you decided to 
elaborate I figured I indulge with a  rebut.

Mayor In Russia Says He Can See Sarah Palin Showering =46rom His House


(Provideniya, Russia) Governor Sarah Palin, the Republican Vice =20
Presidential nominee, has said that she can see Russia from her =20
house. Across the Bering Strait in Provideniya Bay sits the town of =20
Provideniya, Russia and its mayor Dimitri Andropov. He says that he =20
can see Palin showering from HIS house. =93And it is very nice.=94

Mayor Andropov added that his small town, like America, is transfixed =20=

with the buxom Governor. =93We have a shower watchman on duty 24/7. And =20=

when the delightful Palin turns on the water and lets down her hair, =20
the alarm sounds, telling everyone to rush to my house for a show. =20
The kids love it.=94

Leonid Andropov, the Mayor=92s brother, said that the ability to see =20
Palin shower has given him and the other men a newfound respect for =20
her. =93She=92s a very thorough cleaner, which is tough when one is =20
dealing with moose guts, wolf blood and oil=85And she doesn=92t have a =20=

mustache, which is just a big plus for us.=94

In a spontaneous Q&A at a Phoenix donut shop, Sarah Palin said that =20
she=92s okay with the Russians watching her shower. =93I=92m flattered. =
And =20
hopefully my cleanliness can inspire them to go after freedom, =20
liberty and democracy...so that they can create jobs, get more =20
freedom and liberty to help the economic job search, then hunt down =20
the terror loving terrorists and change their nation of human people =20
for the better.=94

=93All I heard from that speech was change, and change to us is bad,=94 =20=

said Mayor Andropov. =93Change means John McCain will win the election =20=

and take our water princess to shower in Washington D.C=85We don=92t =
want =20
that to happen=85Everything else Governor Palin said was over our small =20=

town heads. But that=92s okay, because we like to watch Sarah the same =20=

way she likes to watch Saturday Night Live, with the sound turned down.=94=


In other news, Bill Clinton announced his candidacy for Mayor of =20
Provideniya.

Did catch up with Osby & Holt (actually Holt found us), but couldn't
find Hil in spite of us texting each other all day. Agree with Peter
(and sorry we didn't catch up after we parked the float, it was Dean's
first parade) that the sound this year was definitely bigger, and many
of the stages did have a higher production value for sure. After
circling the whole deal three times, fatigue & a fat headache got the
best of me so we peaced out.=20

Favorite set for me was DRC @ Clubberz Cure, however there were many
close-seconds.  Hey Peter, we need to catch up soon!

peace

now I'm that guy     =20

 Headline: Love Fest Killed Muni
=20
 We couldn't get a sitter so we really only attended the parade part and
briefly went into the festival area itself.  Took Muni from West Portal
to the parade and saw at least 6 full trains packed with ravers before
we jammed ourselves into one.  When we got off at Civic Center it was
pandemonium; there were ravers and weirdos everywhere.  Muni people were
obviously overwhelmed and irritated.
=20
 We got to Market just as the parade approached.  Wow!  Many more floats
this year with bigger sound systems and higher production values on them
as well.  Heard many good tunes as the parade progressed and some, umm,
not so good.  Went over to the SF House float area for a while looking
for Chuck G but no joy,
=20
 Danced for a bit there and the boys picked up on girls.  Tyrone (age 17
mos.) was especially successful.  I thought this one girl in a lime
green dress he was flirting with was going to follow us home.  He used
this pointing move I taught him.  Hilarious.
=20
 The boys got tired after a bit and we had to depart.  Went back into
Muni and the situation was even worse.  Still more ravers coming
downtown from the West Side.  And even the outbound trains were
partially packed with ravers.  Amazing.
=20
 To my surprise there are literally thousands of young rave heads living
out here on the West Side, probably largely SF State kids.  And they
were out in force.  Wow. =20

Subject: [sfraves] Recommended Software Application from Google

This application:
http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10059735-2.html
might be of interest to some of us who get all liquored up and decide to 
post to sfraves.

"Just a quick post to mention a silly (or is it?) experiment that Google has released to the public: Mail Goggles.
This feature is designed to prevent you from sending stupid e-mails in
the small hours, when you're most likely to be inebriated and at risk
of making a complete idiot of yourself.

Don't drink and e-mail.

When enabled, Mail Goggles kicks in at the time you specify (default
is between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. on Friday and Saturday), and throws five
math problems up on the screen when you press "send." You have a
limited period of time to solve them. If you can answer the questions,
presumably you're of mind sound enough to tell off your boss, or pour
your heart out to your ex-lover.
If you can solve simple math problems even when under the
table, there's an option to ramp up the difficulty of the questions,
but sadly they remain in the arithmetic realm and don't drift into
interesting algebra or calculus.
To activate Mail Goggles, go into Gmail's settings, and turn on Mail
Goggles in the "Labs" tab. Then adjust how and when it works in the
"General" tab."

If all goes well for me I'll be making the Berlin one next year.

Both one of my writing partners and I missed this year's SF extravaganza but
she did some pics from the past the other day:

http://silencedmajority.blogs.com/silenced_majority_portal/2008/10/missed-the-sf-l.html

Hope everybody had a good time and it makes me glad that things aren't so
far gone yet that we can still pull this kind of thing off in the freest
country in the world, provided of course we confine ourselves to SF and the
Playa.

Well, never been very good at recounting experiences, but what the
hell:

Did a little Thursday night prestart at Phonic/EndUp but missed the party
at Otis.  nice party, pretty moderate sized crowd given love fest was
about to happen, though.

Missed the killswitch klusterfuck on friday, but rolled into an early start
with the dirtybird party at mezzanine.  JPhlip killed as she always seems to,
the rest of the crew did their usual too.  Can't remember last trip to mezz,
never noticed the fuzzy hanging ropes used for the vip area before, those
feel really nice, uhh, sometimes. :)

>From there checked out the abraxis party at jelly's, which wasn't doing so
well.  On leaving met some stalker/generally weird dude who kept talking to
us and trying to social hack us, not sure if he's a PI, hacker, reporter or
maybe a scientologist guy sent to fuck one of us over but definitely the
low point of the weekend.

Back to basecamp to chill for a bit, help get the kontrol livecast levels
set clean, some different assistance and off to the fest, had a surprisingly
good time, but still feel like SF LF just isn't really there yet.

I mean, come on, look how many ravers and other heads were there, and in
terms of music, you've got 1-2 techno, 1-2 dnb, 1-2 trance and most
of the only 17 total were these big commercial/mainstream crews?  Anyway,
some good sounds at the couple of em, just not enough of them.  Looks like
I need to plan on creating a float next year.

Overall it was a good time, fairly friendly nice crowd, saw drugs aplenty of
the socially friendly variety, really the only annoying folks were the
couple of Obama supporters who were intentionally causing the most delay
in the crowded foot traffic lanes (like really, how many people there are
planning to vote for someone else?), other than that good times.  Took
a break at one point to run down to SoMA for a shower and check on the
Kontrol webcast, which sounded great almost all event(went down during
Sammy D's set near the end).

Bailed for dinner, finally gave in and took an hour nap, off to kontrol,
got there in time for Speedy J, scored a little more stayawake assistance and
held it together until 7:30 or so, decided this time the fade out was
too strong for assistance so went home, slept for 4 hours this time before
heading back out, wandered, nothing of note sunday afternoon, got back
home sometime around 2am and went to sleep.

And yeah, surprisingly few listers during the weekend, guess everyone went
to different parties.  Quite the duration, good LoveFest, just hope it
keeps growing into something like the real parade in Germany. ;)

-R.

Forest and I went to the Skills party and hung out
with Terry.  It was lots of fun!  What an amazing
production!  They had 32 dual 15" subs per side in the
main room, the stack of speakers was literally like 30
feet tall, with 7 massive lasers, and awesome visual
screens.  The side rooms also had booming and clear
sound systems and awesome visuals!  Terry's visuals
were dope, as usual, and the whole room was green when
Green Velvet was playing, wicked!  Go JK on sound!

Unfortunately, there probably won't be a Berlin Love Parade next year, as
far as I know. This year the Parade was in Dortmund. Generally speaking,
Berliners seem to be totally over Love Parade; it's old news. There have
been legal issues surrounding holding Love Parade in Berlin for a couple
years now.

Subject: [sfraves] My Lovely Love Filled Lovin' YUmmy Weekend Review PT1

OK... so 'cause like my weekend was incredibally mondo hella friggin'
long, I"m gonna try to make this review as short as possible...

So my weekend actually started on Wed afternoon... i went out to the City
& went to school to meet w/ my couselors... then I went to Qool Happy Hour
for the premiere of the SF LoveFest Mini Documentary... so that was kinda
fun 'cause saw alota people who been MIA for a while :)  Qool was actually
pretty fun :)  I mean... there was like this Proggy almost Candy house
playing when the happy just started then like moved to this Proggy kinda
trance which was kinda funny 'cause i heard tracks I ain't heard in years.
 The crowd was pretty mixed with the yups & the ravers & the clubbers, but
it was a totally good vibe!  Then when the SFLF Mini doc showed, it just
made everyone happy :)

But my primary goal was to get to San Jose to Terry's pad 'cause I need to
crash there.  Like my homie from Rhode Island planned on coming out for
LoveFest & he really wanted me to pick him up.  LoL... so like instead of
telling people the whole long mondo story why i needed to get out to the
South Bay ASAP... I just told them "I need to pick up a LoveFest DJ @ SJ
Airport" which was actually 2 truths into 1 'cause he is a DJ & he was
going to LoveFest... but I needed to shortcut it...

So after a long walk, a long wait at Cal Train with a bunch of Canadians &
Portuguese women who liked singing, a really long Cal Train Commute with
this punk rock wannabe haight street couple, a Chinese man on his cell
phone, & this mondo like hella freaky lookin' like old man who kept
peaking at me inbetween the seats in front of me while his wife was
talkin' to him, I finally made it the South Bay.  Then at the station,
like Terry wasn't there yet & I ws kinda freakin' out 'cause the only pay
phone there to call him was like busted.  Luckily half an hour later,
after walking around the station & the surrounding area all confuzed and
totally mondo lost, this Latino dude by this apartment complex called
Terry for me & Luckily he & Paula just arrived & wre like on the other
side of the station.  Then as soon as i was relieved and walking through
the tunnel, two homeless dude, one with a banjo singing for me to wait for
im started chasing me.  Hello 2day... so I just hella ran until I say
their car & jumped the fuck in!

So FINALLY, after hours of endless travel and small adventure, I made it
to my goal.  Then after like a couple hours of talking w/ Terry & Paula &
watching TV, I slept.  Woke up around like 9:45ish, had a yummy Estioko
breakfast with this yummy blended coffee, watched more TV, got ready,
talked with Paula more & her Brother & his girlfriend, play endlessly with
Chewwy & Han Solo (even tried walking them, but that didn't work), then
got dropped off at the airport to meet up with Steppo!

OK.. I just wanna say right quick, Terry, Thank U sooooooooo much for
everything!!  I reeeeeeeeally  really really totally hella mondo like
appreciate everything man!  I mean... that had to of been like kinda the
shortest visit i've ever had with  you.  But like seroulsy, thank U much
Pare!  You & Paula & Brother & GF helped me soooooooooo much! YAAAAY!!

So me & Steppo are at the airport and he told me that this chica from
Davis, this newbie in the dubstep scene & in dubstep.fm, Haliegh, was on
her way to pick him up too.  So we didn't have to do the whole public
transport commute to the City.  LoL... she showed up like an hour & a half
later then lied to us that it took her only 2 hours to drive down from
Davis *rolls eyes* HELLO 2DAY, yeah right!

So we ate at In N Out 'cause it's where all the Cali Tourist Newbies gotta
eat, got to his Homie's pad in SOMA, went bar hopping in The Mission, then
ended up in Trauma at El Rincon!  Oooh Wow, Trauma was so fun.  LoL...
Young crowd & saw alota people, familiar faces, mondo good vibes!  It was
Dope!!  The music went from Jungle, to breaks/ electro house, dubstep,

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Blowin' the roof off this sucka: 15 yr. anniv. of An Epiphany
 Of Sound

All I've got to say about the subject line are 2 words; Dragn'fly and 
AndyW.  Yup, that roof doesn't have a chance!!

I'm SO excited to have these two coming down to celebrate the 15 yr. 
anniversary of An Epiphany Of Sound!!  It was only last Thur., as I was 
getting ready for the show, that I realized that this week was the 
anniversary day.  So I quickly thought who would be best to have join in 
and make the celebration proper.  And these 2 immediately came to mind.
Both because of the music they bring as well as the connections they 
have to the show.  This is going to be big!!  And oh so perfect!

So, be sure to tune in to An Epiphany Of Sound this Thursday, from 
9a-noon pacific time, for our celebration of 15 yrs. on the air with 
AndyW and Dragn'fly.  We're over the air in the bay area at 90.1FM and 
we stream to the world at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!

Peace all,
J.C.

phenomenal!...obama used paulson to try to embezzle $700B out
of the federal reserve after previously already embezzeling $25B
into germany for fanny mae, which turned out to be nothing but a
front company for DNC financing, so he could hi-jack love parade
in berlin, germany and give a speech there, used the money to
finance his DNC convention in denver, colorado, tricked mccain
into one debate as fodder for MadTV and SNL to mock mccain,
tricked mccain into another debate that was obviously biased
toward liberals again due to obama spending three times as much
money as mccain on TV with all the embezzled federal funds of
your hard earned tax money and has been literally able to get
away with embezzeling so much of your hard earned tax money
while people literally starved in galveston, texas after the floods!

obama is by far the greatest magician who has ever lived! completely,
outdoing the dark tares who were able to trick authorities to spy
on me claiming i had something to do with a coors beer ball filled
with flour that dark tares claim was supposed to be a meth lab,
tricking all the authorities there, so black gang members could rob
the other side of town during black friday right before christmas
last year!  dark tares bring a whole new meaning to look at the clean
hand, while the dark shady hands rob you blind!

but then again, if you consider the fact that blacks bragged the WTC
would be the ultmate insurance scam right before 9/11, put out a
black gangster hip hop album showing the WTC getting blown up
with a song about "5 million ways to kill a CEO" on it, rioted in the
streets of NYC against globalization right before 9/11, commited
9/11 for silverstein for a huge insurance scam, was able to get
away with it by claiming bin laden did it by using a 5 year old CNN
video that was severly mistranslated, a video of an old black man
dressed as bin laden, and sending anthrax letters (keep in mind
anthrax originally came from africa) with letters framing islams,
tricked america into the war on afghanistan, used the baltimore
sniper to start martial law and give colin powell the power to give
that BS speech in front of the UN claiming saddam attempted to
obtain yellow cake to enrich depleted uranium in niger, africa to
start the war on iraq, costing over 4000 US soldiers their lives, over
30,000 injured due to IED attacks that turned out to be german WWII
bomb shells converted to IED's after an arms deal between condi
and merkel, costing america over $1 trillion, 5 years of cali wildfires
due to black hate of mexicans, armed bank robberies, armed ATM
robberies, armed store robberies, killing women of the night for their
cash on hand, killing our soldiers after they got back from iraq,
kidnap and ransom schemes, bringing in AIDS, anthrax, e.boli,
e.coli, west nile virus, avian bird flu, and malaria, telemarketing
scams, identity scams, credit cards scams, obtaining a registered
GOP list and treating it like a registered sex offenders list, the senator
larry craig bathroom scandal, the gov. spitzer sex scandal, more
perverse and wicked rumors about every VIP spread on tabloids
than ever before, hi-jacked a national b-boy competition i planned
for vegas for a DNC convention, almost hi-jacked love fest SF to
be a free Jay-Z MTV tres concert (that was financed by $209 million
stolen from the asian investor of the lady guadelupe film that i wanted
to do mind you) if i had not posted security plans with heather fung,
SF police chief (who had been threatened by dark tares ever since
she cracked down on brothels in SF due to too many jane doe's that
were kiiled by their black gang member pimps due to money disputes)
and the california national guard doing plain clothes undercover security
due to black gang members killing 9 people at a halloween party near SF
before, shooting a black NBC reporter reporting on black crime problems
in SF, and shooting 5 US soldiers after they got back from iraq! blacks
have gotten away with all of this so far by bribing law enforcement and
FBI agents, paying off certain people to prevent jurors from getting to
court, and simply pushing gay marriage in the court systems to literally
obstruct justice to prevent the court system from doing its job of putting
away some of the worst criminals and terrorists in the history of america
responsible for 75% of all the major crimes and terrorists acts all around
the world, than it is not so surprising!

with so much money made from illegal drug trafficking, organized crime,
blackmail and extorsion, and embezzlement, no wonder the dark tares
had so much to spend on obama biased TV programming!...

  Obama Outspending McCain Nearly 3 to 1 on Television
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., waves as he
arrives for a technical walk through before a scheduled townhall-style
presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn., Tuesday, Oct.
7, 2008. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)

*Barack Obama* is outspending *John McCain* at nearly a three-to-one clip on
television time in the final weeks of the presidential election, according
to ad buy information obtained by The Fix, a financial edge that is almost
certainly contributing to the momentum for the Illinois senator in key
battleground states.

>From Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, Obama spent more than $20 million on television ads
in 17 states including more than $3 million in Pennsylvania and more than $2
million each in Florida, Michigan and Ohio. McCain in that same time frame
spent just $7.2 million in 15 states. Even when the Republican National
Committee's independent expenditure spending in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin is factored in (a total of $5.3
million), Obama still outspent the combined GOP forces by roughly $8 million
in the last week alone. (See full distribution after the
jump<http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/10/obamas_spending_edge.html#chart>.)


The spending edge enjoyed by Obama has been used almost exclusively to
hammer McCain as both a clone of the current president and someone who is
out of touch on key domestic issues -- most notably the economy. The
assertion of Obama's spending edge has coincided with the collapse of the
financial industry and a refocusing by voters on the economy to turn the
election from a toss up to one in which the Democratic candidate has moved
into a discernible lead.

While the struggles of McCain and his party over the Wall Street bailout
bill that passed Congress last week after much *sturm und drang* have been
well documented, the practical political impact of Obama's decision to
forego public financing for the general election and McCain's choice to
accept the $84 million in public funds has not been as fully explored.

Obama's fundraising machine has continued to churn in recent months -- bringing
in $67.5 million in August
alone<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/us/politics/15donors.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>and
ending that month with more than $77 million on hand. (Reports for
September are not due at the Federal Election Commission until Oct. 20.)

Obama's ad spending strategy has been based on the idea of stretching McCain
to the limit in a series of non-traditional battlegrounds (Indiana, North
Carolina, Colorado, Virginia), knowing that such an approach would force the
cash-poorer Republican's hand at some point.

That decision paid off last week when McCain pulled down his television ads
in Michigan<http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/10/mccain_moves_out_of_michigan_w.html>,
a move due in large part to the prohibitive cost of continuing to run
commercials in the Wolverine State. A look at advertising in the last week
in Michigan showed Obama dropping nearly $2.2 million as compared to
$642,000 for McCain and just over $1 million by the RNC -- a difference of
nearly $600,000 in favor of the Illinois senator.

A detailed look at campaign spending on ads over the last week shows clearly
how Obama is using his financial edge over McCain. In 13 of the 15 states
where both candidates were on television, Obama outspent McCain -- in some
states, drastically.

In Florida, where recent
polling<http://www.pollster.com/polls/fl/08-fl-pres-ge-mvo.php>suggests
an Obama surge, the Illinois senator disbursed more than $2.8
million for television ads in the last week while McCain spent $623,000 -- a
massive $2.17 million spending gap.

In North Carolina, Obama dropped approximately $1.5 million on television
commercials last week while McCain spent only $137,000. Such a wide spending
disparity explains why a series of polls has shown Obama trending upward in
the Tarheel State of late.

Even in Pennsylvania, the state where McCain is now focusing much of his
time and energy in the final month of the campaign, Obama's spending
advantage is massive. Obama disbursed a little more than $3 million in the
Keystone State last month as compared to $1.2 million in ad spending by
McCain and another $807,000 by the RNC. It adds up to a million-dollar edge
for Obama on television -- meaning that he outspending Republican by roughly
33 percent in Pennsylvania.

In Virginia, a state that has gone Republican in every presidential election
since 1964, Obama's pronounced spending advantage is also being felt. Obama
spent $1.6 million on ads in the Commonwealth last week while the combined
forces of McCain and the RNC spent $909,000 -- giving Obama a $700,000
spending lead.

Only in Minnesota and Iowa did McCain have a spending edge on television
over Obama in the last week.

In Minnesota, the McCain spent $377,000 on television, far more than the
$196,000 Obama spent during the same period. Republicans saw a significant
uptick in their numbers in Minnesota following the national party convention
in August although most recent
surveys<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/mn/minnesota_mccain_vs_obama-550.html>show
Obama reclaiming a statistically significant lead. History is also
against McCain in the state as no Republican presidential nominee has
carried Minnesota since 1972.

In Iowa, McCain spent $297,000 on television as compared to $224,000 for
Obama. That's rough parity in a state where polling shows Obama with a
comfortable lead. McCain has spent considerable time, attention and money in
Iowa, however, a strategy that has baffled many within the Obama campaign.
Iowa went for then Vice President *Al Gore* in 2000 by 4,000 votes in 2000
but *George W. Bush* carried it by 10,000 votes four years later.

Spending by the RNC's independent expenditure arm has kept McCain within
shouting distance of Obama in several crucial states including Ohio and
Wisconsin.

In Ohio, Obama spent $2.86 million on television last week while the
combination of McCain ($1.1 million) and the RNC ($1.66 million) gave
Democrats just a $100,000 edge. The same was true in Wisconsin where Obama
disbursed $1.24 million, compared to $1.03 million for McCain and the RNC.

Is Obama's spending edge conclusive when it comes to determining the outcome
on Nov. 4? No. External events can -- and always seem to -- intrude on even
the best laid of political plans and strategies. But, Obama's fundraising
prowess has provided him a major leg up in the final month of the campaign
that, when combined with the detrimental effects the focus on the economy
has had on McCain, make it an uphill climb to victory for the Arizona
senator.

phenomenal!...obama used paulson to try to embezzle $700B out
of the federal reserve after previously already embezzeling $25B
into germany for fanny mae, which turned out to be nothing but a
front company for DNC financing, so he could hi-jack love parade
in berlin, germany and give a speech there, used the money to
finance his DNC convention in denver, colorado, tricked mccain
into one debate as fodder for MadTV and SNL to mock mccain,
tricked mccain into another debate that was obviously biased
toward liberals again due to obama spending three times as much
money as mccain on TV with all the embezzled federal funds of
your hard earned tax money and has been literally able to get
away with embezzeling so much of your hard earned tax money
while people literally starved in galveston, texas after the floods!

obama is by far the greatest magician who has ever lived! completely,
outdoing the dark tares who were able to trick authorities to spy
on me claiming i had something to do with a coors beer ball filled
with flour that dark tares claim was supposed to be a meth lab,
tricking all the authorities there, so black gang members could rob
the other side of town during black friday right before christmas
last year!  dark tares bring a whole new meaning to look at the clean
hand, while the dark shady hands rob you blind!

but then again, if you consider the fact that blacks bragged the WTC
would be the ultmate insurance scam right before 9/11, put out a
black gangster hip hop album showing the WTC getting blown up
with a song about "5 million ways to kill a CEO" on it, rioted in the
streets of NYC against globalization right before 9/11, commited
9/11 for silverstein for a huge insurance scam, was able to get
away with it by claiming bin laden did it by using a 5 year old CNN
video that was severly mistranslated, a video of an old black man
dressed as bin laden, and sending anthrax letters (keep in mind
anthrax originally came from africa) with letters framing islams,
tricked america into the war on afghanistan, used the baltimore
sniper to start martial law and give colin powell the power to give
that BS speech in front of the UN claiming saddam attempted to
obtain yellow cake to enrich depleted uranium in niger, africa to
start the war on iraq, costing over 4000 US soldiers their lives, over
30,000 injured due to IED attacks that turned out to be german WWII
bomb shells converted to IED's after an arms deal between condi
and merkel, costing america over $1 trillion, 5 years of cali wildfires
due to black hate of mexicans, armed bank robberies, armed ATM
robberies, armed store robberies, killing women of the night for their
cash on hand, killing our soldiers after they got back from iraq,
kidnap and ransom schemes, bringing in AIDS, anthrax, e.boli,
e.coli, west nile virus, avian bird flu, and malaria, telemarketing
scams, identity scams, credit cards scams, obtaining a registered
GOP list and treating it like a registered sex offenders list, the senator
larry craig bathroom scandal, the gov. spitzer sex scandal, more
perverse and wicked rumors about every VIP spread on tabloids
than ever before, hi-jacked a national b-boy competition i planned
for vegas for a DNC convention, almost hi-jacked love fest SF to
be a free Jay-Z MTV tres concert (that was financed by $209 million
stolen from the asian investor of the lady guadelupe film that i wanted
to do mind you) if i had not posted security plans with heather fung,
SF police chief (who had been threatened by dark tares ever since
she cracked down on brothels in SF due to too many jane doe's that
were kiiled by their black gang member pimps due to money disputes)
and the california national guard doing plain clothes undercover security
due to black gang members killing 9 people at a halloween party near SF
before, shooting a black NBC reporter reporting on black crime problems
in SF, and shooting 5 US soldiers after they got back from iraq! blacks
have gotten away with all of this so far by bribing law enforcement and
FBI agents, paying off certain people to prevent jurors from getting to
court, and simply pushing gay marriage in the court systems to literally
obstruct justice to prevent the court system from doing its job of putting
away some of the worst criminals and terrorists in the history of america
responsible for 75% of all the major crimes and terrorists acts all around
the world, than it is not so surprising!

with so much money made from illegal drug trafficking, organized crime,
blackmail and extorsion, and embezzlement, no wonder the dark tares
had so much to spend on obama biased TV programming!...

  Obama Outspending McCain Nearly 3 to 1 on Television

presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn., Tuesday, Oct.
7, 2008. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)

*Barack Obama* is outspending *John McCain* at nearly a three-to-one clip on
television time in the final weeks of the presidential election, according
to ad buy information obtained by The Fix, a financial edge that is almost
certainly contributing to the momentum for the Illinois senator in key
battleground states.

>From Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, Obama spent more than $20 million on television ads
in 17 states including more than $3 million in Pennsylvania and more than $2
million each in Florida, Michigan and Ohio. McCain in that same time frame
spent just $7.2 million in 15 states. Even when the Republican National
Committee's independent expenditure spending in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin is factored in (a total of $5.3
million), Obama still outspent the combined GOP forces by roughly $8 million
in the last week alone. (See full distribution after the
jump<http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/10/obamas_spending_edge.html#chart>.)


The spending edge enjoyed by Obama has been used almost exclusively to
hammer McCain as both a clone of the current president and someone who is
out of touch on key domestic issues -- most notably the economy. The
assertion of Obama's spending edge has coincided with the collapse of the
financial industry and a refocusing by voters on the economy to turn the
election from a toss up to one in which the Democratic candidate has moved
into a discernible lead.

While the struggles of McCain and his party over the Wall Street bailout
bill that passed Congress last week after much *sturm und drang* have been
well documented, the practical political impact of Obama's decision to
forego public financing for the general election and McCain's choice to
accept the $84 million in public funds has not been as fully explored.

Obama's fundraising machine has continued to churn in recent months -- bringing
in $67.5 million in August
alone<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/us/politics/15donors.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>and
ending that month with more than $77 million on hand. (Reports for
September are not due at the Federal Election Commission until Oct. 20.)

Obama's ad spending strategy has been based on the idea of stretching McCain
to the limit in a series of non-traditional battlegrounds (Indiana, North
Carolina, Colorado, Virginia), knowing that such an approach would force the
cash-poorer Republican's hand at some point.

That decision paid off last week when McCain pulled down his television ads
in Michigan<http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/10/mccain_moves_out_of_michigan_w.html>,
a move due in large part to the prohibitive cost of continuing to run
commercials in the Wolverine State. A look at advertising in the last week
in Michigan showed Obama dropping nearly $2.2 million as compared to
$642,000 for McCain and just over $1 million by the RNC -- a difference of
nearly $600,000 in favor of the Illinois senator.

A detailed look at campaign spending on ads over the last week shows clearly
how Obama is using his financial edge over McCain. In 13 of the 15 states
where both candidates were on television, Obama outspent McCain -- in some
states, drastically.

In Florida, where recent
polling<http://www.pollster.com/polls/fl/08-fl-pres-ge-mvo.php>suggests
an Obama surge, the Illinois senator disbursed more than $2.8
million for television ads in the last week while McCain spent $623,000 -- a
massive $2.17 million spending gap.

In North Carolina, Obama dropped approximately $1.5 million on television
commercials last week while McCain spent only $137,000. Such a wide spending
disparity explains why a series of polls has shown Obama trending upward in
the Tarheel State of late.

Even in Pennsylvania, the state where McCain is now focusing much of his
time and energy in the final month of the campaign, Obama's spending
advantage is massive. Obama disbursed a little more than $3 million in the
Keystone State last month as compared to $1.2 million in ad spending by
McCain and another $807,000 by the RNC. It adds up to a million-dollar edge
for Obama on television -- meaning that he outspending Republican by roughly
33 percent in Pennsylvania.

In Virginia, a state that has gone Republican in every presidential election
since 1964, Obama's pronounced spending advantage is also being felt. Obama
spent $1.6 million on ads in the Commonwealth last week while the combined
forces of McCain and the RNC spent $909,000 -- giving Obama a $700,000
spending lead.

Only in Minnesota and Iowa did McCain have a spending edge on television
over Obama in the last week.

In Minnesota, the McCain spent $377,000 on television, far more than the
$196,000 Obama spent during the same period. Republicans saw a significant
uptick in their numbers in Minnesota following the national party convention
in August although most recent
surveys<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/mn/minnesota_mccain_vs_obama-550.html>show
Obama reclaiming a statistically significant lead. History is also
against McCain in the state as no Republican presidential nominee has
carried Minnesota since 1972.

In Iowa, McCain spent $297,000 on television as compared to $224,000 for
Obama. That's rough parity in a state where polling shows Obama with a
comfortable lead. McCain has spent considerable time, attention and money in
Iowa, however, a strategy that has baffled many within the Obama campaign.
Iowa went for then Vice President *Al Gore* in 2000 by 4,000 votes in 2000
but *George W. Bush* carried it by 10,000 votes four years later.

Spending by the RNC's independent expenditure arm has kept McCain within
shouting distance of Obama in several crucial states including Ohio and
Wisconsin.

In Ohio, Obama spent $2.86 million on television last week while the
combination of McCain ($1.1 million) and the RNC ($1.66 million) gave
Democrats just a $100,000 edge. The same was true in Wisconsin where Obama
disbursed $1.24 million, compared to $1.03 million for McCain and the RNC.

Is Obama's spending edge conclusive when it comes to determining the outcome
on Nov. 4? No. External events can -- and always seem to -- intrude on even
the best laid of political plans and strategies. But, Obama's fundraising
prowess has provided him a major leg up in the final month of the campaign
that, when combined with the detrimental effects the focus on the economy
has had on McCain, make it an uphill climb to victory for the Arizona
senator.

because biden was behind the anti-rave legislation that treats all bar
and club owners as mafia to justify illegal search and seizures after
illegal drug plants by black gang members resulting in the shutting
down of numerous bar, clubs, and so many underground events,
seizing of property to be sold on e-bay and other auction sites,
and because dark tares only come to events to traffick ilegal drugs
(sometimes cut with rat poison, which resulted in the death of 8
party kids at a big event in philadelphia), were responsible for so
many jumping and mugging of patrons, car jackings, holding promotors
up at gun point to rob them, following DJ's home to steal their records,
spreading some of the most perverse and wicked rumors to the
media if blackmail and extorsion fees are not paid, tried to fine real
promotors $11,000 fines for simply promoting for real events on-line,
please, please, do not forward VIP club events i promoted for in NYC,
Vegas, SF, and LA to dark tares,  DNC, and Obama supporters who
have been literally ruining our scene and so many people truley involved
with the scene since day one like myself!

Yes, I understand now. I looked it up - "shatter - to break into pieces, to
ruin, to damage seriously, to disable, to destroy".

OK, I will now repeat 100 times "I will not feed the trolls, I will not feed
the trolls, I will not feed..."

Nazi's weren't the first to use skulls, nor did they invent the swastika.
Since you assume the use of a skull signifies neo-nazism I'm surprised you
have brought Hot Topic up as a Hilter Youth Outfitting Center.

As for "Gabber" it's hard and it's fast.  Pointing to one genre and drawing
connections is narrow minded, as there have been neo-nazi influenced on
Punk, metal, and country music to name but a few.

I pointed out about 12 people showing up in the bay area because the only
thing anyone seems to give two shits about is shitty house music and of
late, canned $59 keyboard drum beats (what some are calling minimum techno,
and what i would ask is "more techno less minimal you lazy fuck").  Trace
has become a dirty word because of the zombies that practice DJ worship at
the alter of Fail.  So, what's left?  Breaks?  I can dig that, but then
again you get the mass drone of house heads bitching about "we want
house....  we want house.....  we want house...  my E is wearing off....."

Not that I'm jaded or anything.

If you like Hardcore/Gabber then that's fine, as everyone is free to enjoy
what they will.  Godwins law was already invoked in your initial retort thus
it was going to go unanswered, however, since you decided to elaborate I
figured I indulge with a  rebut.

Click your heels three times and maybe you'll end up back in Kansas

If you needed a dictionary to define "Shatter" then that would qualify 
as FAIL unless english isn't your primary language, then you're forgiven.

Subject: [sfraves] My Lovely Love Filled Lovin' YUmmy Weekend Review PT2

So friday, there were hella things to do that night, places to go, but i
just wanted to chill since i had to get up around like 6AM & be in the
staging area by 8AM... so I hella caught up on alota sleep lost & rested &
stuff...

Saturday came, got to the City, enjoyed a walk w/ this girl from Pismo
beach, who was a LF Virgin, to 2nd street, then got to Minna & hung out
with the Solid Gold Dancers!  LF Float headquarters wasn't even open yet &
i was sooooooooooooo buttfuckin' tired still... so I just hung out w/ the
Solid Gold Dancers & these 2 Skills Float Candy P Tot Dancers...

By like 10AM, most all the floats were there & we put the finishing
touches on the BADNB float, which wasn't really much 'cause it was just a
big ass bed w/ speakers & minimal, if any, decorations... then as soon as
the procession starts, i was told by the head float dude, Canadub, that I
was the head wheel monitor/ float monitor person & i hella freaked out...
like every year, I'm just a wheel monitor for the BADNB float 'cause I
like walking along the float & having a low impact kinda workout dealie &
just being responsible for my area. But I just figured I'd do it.... & I
did!!!

OK... Heeeeeeeeeeeeeello 2Daaay... Float Monitor is so not a Groovy job...
not only was i responsible for keeping the front clear of retards who like
walking in front of moving vehicles, but I had to pace the driver on when
to move & stop while yelling to the top of my lungs "MOVE MOVE MOVE MOVE,
WILL YOU FUCKIN MOVE YOU IDIOT, DON"T CROSS, GET BACK THERE, MOVE MOVE
MOVE MOVE"... yeah.. it wasn't so fun, or easy... 'cause apparently
drunkardly or etardedly crossing in front of a big ass truck 2 feet away
from it is really smart!

So after like what... the hour & a 1/2 - 2 hour procession, the parking
confussion with the floats in our section, then just my own like walkin'
the float crazy walking decompression... it was kinda nice to finally
chill & just take in the madness :)  Like the festival started packing in
fast!!  It was kinda estimated that between 3:30-4PM, Civic Center was
already at 100,200!  By the time it was over, it was at 100,500.

But as soon as I got my bearings back (well... as much as I have anyway),
I had to find my camera crew 'cause we're finishing up the SFLF
documentary & extending it so we can have a full length & can make DVDs &
stuff!  So for the next 2 hours, we went around Civic interviewing
sooooooooooo many people & as exausting as it was, it was still kinda fun
& I actually got to enjoy alota floats I wasn't gonna go to.

Overall, it was fun!  LF this year was pretty Dope!  I mean... it was
reeeeeeeeally Groovy seein' Familia everywhere & all the dancers I brock
out on the floor with!  I will be biased & say that the BADNB float did
have a hugest crowd like we do every year with all the junglists for a
day!!  But the dance floors all around Civic were goin' on too.  It was a
really good day!!  YAAAAY!!!

So after I was at our lil BADNB afterparty at Anu.  LoL... yeah... I had a
rEally good timE thErE 'cause well... all I gotta say is when in Rome man
:P  But yeah... the DJs killed it, the bar was packed more than i've ever
seen it. Afterwards I ended up walkin' around SOMA & meeting alota LF
people.  Then I ended up crossing 7th street & someone like hella yelled
my name, Holy Shit, it was my Homegirl Marcine... I was tempted to tell
her to drop me off @ the dubstep afterparty, but she offered a ride home
instead & I sooo couldn't not pass that up! Lol... Hello 2day... so
yeah... but 4AM, i was home just like, yeah... totally good day & night!!!

Welcome!!
Bummed that Andy didn't make it down, but Dragn'fly is, well, 
Dragn'fly!!!  Couldn't have celebrated any better!

(Hope my scatterbrained set, complete with a repeat track, was good 
enough. :) )

If you don't listen to these, or hip hop, you're listening to shit.

Subject: MUSIC speech used without permission!


Just want to alert you:

It was brought to my attention today by one of my good people abroad =
that the label "Be Chosen" had released a vinyl EP with three songs =
containing my entire Music Speech from SUBX01! I license to people, =
labels and projects where I see fit but to use my shit (not even =
sampling it but the whole thing just over their track) without even =
asking me was & is jacked-up (way wrong).

This is just to let everyone know that I NEVER gave them permission to =
use my vocals, have never even heard of the label and was never =
approached by anyone from Be Chosen.

Needless to say I am not very happy about this and action is being =
taken. Any help you can give me by spreading the word about this label =
and what they did would be very helpful! They don't know me or how I =
conduct business....

KeepDeep,
Bone

On October 25th, 2008 Revival NYC invites you to an epic night of Drum and
Bass...


Featuring...



*THE PLANET OF THE DRUMS!*





*Dieselboy*


The jungle scene has always been centered in Britain, leaving Americans to
watch from afar, import the records, and spin occasionally (though rarely
very well). Damian Higgins reversed the trends a little bit with his
nation-trotting gigs and frequent mix albums released as Dieselboy. Born in
Pennsylvania, Higgins began DJing during the early '90s and organized house
parties in and around Philadelphia. By 1993, the sound of jungle had begun
pumping up America as well as Britain, and Dieselboy made the switch to
drum'n'bass. He DJed at jungle events all around America and helmed
1996's Suburban
Base jump-up compilation Drum & Bass Selection USA. Another Sub Base mix
album, 97 Octane, followed in 1997. Dieselboy's next two albums (A Soldier's
Story, System Upgrade) appeared on Moonshine, the premier American mix
label. In mid-1999, Higgins began his production career with a single
("Atlantic
State") for the respected British concern Technical Itch Recordings, and
another single, "Descent," followed later that year for Palm Pictures.
Dieselboy's 2000 release, The 6ixth Session, combined a mix disc with a full
one of productions.



*Dara*


Besides the Liquid Sky community, DJ Dara is probably New York's leading
exponent of drum'n'bass. He has led several club nights around the city and
began recording for Sm:)e Communications with his first album, Rinsimus
Maximus, released in July 1997. The following year, he returned with the mix
album Full Circle:Drum && Bass DJ Mix, while both Renegade Continuum and
Halfway Home appeared in 1999. His New York City based jungle record
store, Breakbeat
Science, established itself as an important contribution to the American
growth of drum n' bass and it's younger talent. DJ Dara continued his
prolific output in early 2000 with From Here to There. He returned a year
later on Moonshine with Future Perfect.



*AK1200*


When Orlando native AK 1200 started his career in electronic music in the
late '80s, almost no one in the country had ever heard of it. Nevertheless,
the artist managed to carve out an extremely successful career in the realm
of underground electronic music while simultaneously introducing countless
people to the up-and-coming genre. At this point, he boasts one of the most
illustrious careers of anyone in the business. He is not only a DJ, but also
a producer, promoter, remixer, magazine publisher, and record store owner,
not to mention a pioneer of breakbeat, jungle, and drum'n'bass.


..
*MC MESSINIAN*


Born in Los Angeles, California, J-Messinian (nee James Fiorella) bounced
around the country nomad-like, eventually ending up in Philadelphia in the
late 90's. As a child growing up, James developed a love for MC'ing:
head-nodding to HipHop in oversized headphones and engaging in freestyle
'ciphers' with other "staircase artists". His formative musical roots ranged
from Soul, to Hip Hop, to Latin percussion and Dancehall, to his mother
Helena's emotional piano and guitar sessions. In the early nineties, James
began frequenting parties, from b-boy summits to raves with breaks and tribal
house. As his journey into the underground progressed, he eventually fell in
love with the raw snares and basslines of Drum and Bass music. Click Here

because biden was behind the anti-rave legislation that treats all bar
and club owners as mafia to justify illegal search and seizures after
illegal drug plants by black gang members resulting in the shutting
down of numerous bar, clubs, and so many underground events,
seizing of property to be sold on e-bay and other auction sites,
and because dark tares only come to events to traffick ilegal drugs
(sometimes cut with rat poison, which resulted in the death of 8
party kids at a big event in philadelphia), were responsible for so
many jumping and mugging of patrons, car jackings, holding promotors
up at gun point to rob them, following DJ's home to steal their records,
spreading some of the most perverse and wicked rumors to the
media if blackmail and extorsion fees are not paid, tried to fine real
promotors $11,000 fines for simply promoting for real events on-line,
please, please, do not forward VIP club events i promoted for in NYC,
Vegas, SF, and LA to dark tares,  DNC, and Obama supporters who
have been literally ruining our scene and so many people truley involved
with the scene since day one like myself!

since mexicans heisted $209 million from the asian investor for the lady
guadelupe film and invested it in MTV tres, making me the primary owner
of MTV tres, MTV tres shall assist with Arizona-fest that had been delegated
to DJ John Kelly and DJ Sandra Collins due to Obama distracting John
McCain with multi-billion dollar federal embezzlement attempts with Paulson
and biased debates meant to embarrass McCain when they are mocked on
TV comedy skits.

Arizona-fest had been scheduled for this weekend: Oct. 11 at meteor crater,
one hour east of tulsa, arizona.  it is a free event meant to combine the
celtic
festival of may day, oktoberfest, with a desert destination like Burningman
in nevada.  dj john kelly and sandra collins are both experienced in desert
events in the SW already, but since this event is in october, particiants
should
bring warm clothing for a cold desert night.  or plan to stay in a hotel in
tulsa,
arizona. Mccain had given a speech in California offering a $300,000 reward
for inventors of a longer lasting battery.  as a result, there has been a
real estate
boom in the southwest deserts in preparation for new solar panel
manufacturing
plants. GM, due to budget problems was about to lay off some employees.
just as i had formerly feng shui'ed 7000 merck workers into the energy drink

industry (thus Red Bull BC one b-boy tournaments), i had posted my solution
to feng shui the laid off GM workers into the solar panel manufacturing
plant
industry that will be starting in the SW.  formerly, stanford university had
won
the robot car SUV contest, they shall be involved in engineering electric
vehicles
that will be charged from generators that are powered by solar panels
manufactured in the SW desert.  this solution shall effectively diminish the
energy
problem out west, which resulted in the California energy crisis.

I am also authorising USAF, Air National Guard, Army National Guard, and
US Marines to assist with the event by setting up tents, mess halls with
food and water, and to assist with transportation to equipment.  obviously,
our servicemen deserve some R & R for all their work in afghanistan and
Iraq and during times of natural disaster!  USAF may even advertise flying
some people out from USAF bases in C-140's.

since Cindi McCain's family was involved in the beer industry, she and her
daughter may assist in acquiring drink stands for the event as well as
setting
up a register to vote stand. i also recommend getting arizona iced tea as a
sponsor with red bull bc one, and subway since there's a subway at meteor
crater.  since i was a part of the pre Y2K intelligence team in 1998 that
made
computer moguls into billionaires, i am authorising computer companies
like apple, microsoft, dell, yahoo, oracle, and others to be sponsors for
the
event.  obviously, all those involved in the last three oktoberfests i had
promoted
for are invited including: all german americans, hells angels, lemoore
naval air base, skin industry, cali BMX'ers and dirt bikers, etc.

since ty pennington had built the pestawas (pestawa was the name of a
US soldier, who lost her life in Iraq, she was friends with private jessica
lyncha in iraq) new home in arizona before on home make-over, i want them
to combine with the US military and some native american indians to
construct
the stage for the event.  this is significant because of the native american
indian four corners prophecy.  they may also get some assistance from
porter goss, former US army intelligence and former CIA director (before
hayden) from florida, who got his job because of me when i recruited steve
wynn and turnberry to assist with development plans in florida after the
hurricanes.

things are kind of last minute and kind of rushed but for further questions
concerning the event, contact john mccain, who i had originally delegated
this event to help him promote for his republican presidential campaign run.

most sincerely,

Subject: McCain May Delay Debate In Lieu of Emebezzlement Problem in NYC...
Date: Tuesday, October 7, 2008, 10:44 AM

Obviously, since Obama has used Paulson to embezzle billions out
of the federal reserve into companies that have turned out to be fronts
for Obama DNC campaign financing, it is in McCain's best interest
to delay the debate with Obama only meant to distract him and the
RNC from noticing the enormous amounts of federal funds Obama
had planned to heist out of the federal reserve with Paulson.  Obama
plans to leave the White House atleast $700 billion dollars in the hole
if McCain gets in to the White House!

It would be in McCain's best interest to delay the debate with Obama
since previous debates have only been used as fodder for both SNL
and MadTV to mock McCain.  However, atleast SNL loves Sarah
Palin, due to her close resemblance to Tina Fey.

McCain may choose to delegate Arizona-fest to DJ John Kelly and
DJ Sandra Collins, both of which have experience doing desert parties
in the area before.  This would of course pick up his P. R. in the SW.
but of course, if they fail, the RNC falters.

But one thing is for sure, if McCain doesn't stop Benarke and Paulson
from embezzeling so much federal funds, there will be nothing left to
finance any administration if he gets into the White House!

Mind the gap! The world's biggest cruise ship squeezes out of dock and sets
sail

By Eddie Wrenn
Last updated at 7:44 AM on 29th September 2008

It might be time for the phrase: 'We're gonna need a bigger boat' to enter
retirement.

For this mighty vessel, the largest ever passenger ship, dwarfs all that
stands next to it, making the thousands of spectators which came to see it's
launch look little more than ants as they waved the graceful ship out of the
port.

The 315m-long ship is so wide it barely squeezed out of the Papenberg
watergates, but ably helped by two tug-boats it escaped on it's to the North
sea, where it will head to Denmark.
People watch the cruiser 'Celebrity Solstice' dragged through the watergate
of the Meyer Dockyard in Papenburg

She is one of five Solstice ships launching between now and 2012, and can
carry nearly 3,000 passengers.

And, after thousands of years, landlubbers might be able to escape their
phobia of the sea... This cruiser is the first one to boast an authentic
grass lawn on its top deck.
Celebrity Solstice is the most widely heralded ship to enter the cruise
industry this year

The ship is 'virtually complete' - 98 per cent, to be exact - and is on
track for it's November debut, when it will begin life as a U.S. cruise
ship.

I was the one that had to feng shui the CIA into a Queen Mary Cruise from NY

developing nuclear weapons in their nuclear power plants.  the cruise was

i was the one who started love parade SF as an anniversary event for the UN
since it originally started in SF after WWII to end genocide after the
nazi's
killed over 6 million jews during WWII along with many other people.  ban ki
moon, from south korea is the new UN head.  i am not korean.  i am fourth
generation american born chinese american, which is why i had promoted
for the Olympics in Beijing, China on August 8, 2008 and had posted the
Olympic Cruise on the Norweigian Pride of America in Hawaii.  unfortunately,
Paulson pulled federal funds to funnel to Fanny Mae in Germany, which
turned out to be a front for obama and the DNC.  due to problems with
africans
hi-jacking just about everything i do, ban ki moon,  the new UN head has
picked
up security for cruises as a favor to me, check:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/somalia/2069491/UN-approves-missions-against-Somali-pirates.html

as a result, hi-jackers that took over the cruises i started have tried to
lable me 'korean' when i am not korean to justify their hate campaigns on
me.  african immigrant terrorists aka al quida are an extremely sneaky
evil lot, they were behind the 1993 WTC bombing, Black Hawk Down,
blowing up our american embassy in kenya, 9/11, spain train bombing,
london bombing, 5 years of california wildfires, they were even the ones
who had shot Tupac in Vegas!  there is a world of difference between
african americans and african immigrant terrorists!  for instance when
Colin Powell traveled to South, Africa for talks, the building he was in
was shot 15 times!  watch 'The Last King of Scotland' starring Forest
Whitaker to understand how african war lords are completely ruthless.
1 million people have been killed in Sudan by janjaweed rebels.  africans
are notorious for burning 100 christians alive in the streets for simply
suggesting the prophet muhammed would've married a miss world
contestant.

after that, miss world was moved to sonia, china, where 4 miss world
contests have been held at.  the four miss world contests in china was
part of the reason why china was picked for the site of the upcoming
olympics. it is also because china was where WTO 2005 was at resulting
in $500 billion in new accounts for america, $100 billion in new accounts
for africa, $100 billion in new accounts for germany (including financing
for the world cup stadiums in berlin in 2005), and $100 billion in new
accounts for england (which financed tony blair's labor party).  i was
supposed to get 10% for my services from america, africa, germany,
and england, but so far i have received nothing!  the money i was
supposed to get was supposed to go to financing for the Olympics in
China.

Thus the recent debate i had with Paulson, who had been embezzeling
federal reserve funds and funneling it to US Banks, Africa, and Germany!
completely and utterly illegal!  US federal law forbids embezzeling federal
funds to foreign nations that have killed americans. both Africans and
Germans have killed americans in the past! And worse Paulson wanted to
funnel $25 billion to Fanny Mae, a Frankfurt, Germany company that wanted
to buy up american houses that couldn't afford mortgage payments to sell
the houses on the open market while the people still lived in the houses!
outrageous!  Paulson and Benarke are the worst traitors ever since Condi,
who tried to kill Bush 9 times!  America needs to wake up and stand up
against such blatant corruption!  The money must not be sent to Germany,
I am not german (although i did start Love Parade SF and did promoted for
Cali Oktoberfest for three years), I am actually fourth generation american
born chinese american!  the nazi propagandist are trying desperately to
character assasinate me to justify stealing the money i made for america
(i got japan and china to invest $1.4 trillion in US treasury bonds to bail
america out of a trillion dollar federal defecit in 2004) and embezzeling it
to
germany to finance fanny mae to take over american houses!  where as i
needed the money for the rapture and the Olympics coming up in China!

germans and african immigrant terrorists aka al quida have launched hate
propaganda against me trying to potray me as a gang member or a drug
dealer when in reality i was never a gang member or a drug dealer and
actually notorious for being a jesus freak, clean freak, clean cut freak
my whole life who doesn't even smoke cigarettes!  in fact, i got arrested
for simply reminding park staff that park policy is no smoking in the park
ever since the park started especially in lieu of 5 years of cali wildfires.
unfortunately, these are people who had set the fires in california for
FEMA insurance scams and had even tried to potray me as a red dragon
claiming i had started the fires when i don't even smoke cigarettes and
most of the fires occured over 6 hours south or 4 hours north of me!
china is the golden dragon, which symbolizes good fortune, as in how
i tunrned computer moguls into billionaires pre-Y2K and how i made
celebrities into millionaires with over 60 movies and TV shows that were
started from my internet intelligence reports.  i have posted over 500 world
solutions on-line since 1998!

the red dragon, was actually located on the royal british coat of arms for
wales when the british royal family used to be-head too many of their own
people over throne heiarchy disputes. most notorious being the be-heading
of lady jane grey, a teenage royal girl who lost her head, because her aunt
claimed higher authority!  chec/k: http://www.ladyjanegrey.org/

brits are also notorious for burning women at the stake claiming they were
witches!  according to revelation, the red dragon is the one that eats its
babies after they are born.  obviously when so many people were being
be-headed in england as displayed in the movie 'brave heart' and burned at
the stake as in the movie about 'joan of arc' due claims of women as
witches, mother england had become a bit of a red dragon!

in fact, 77,300 people died during the Revolutionary War in America from
1775 to 1783, just so americans could be free from Mother England (who
seeked to keep America whipped financially and through old european family
obligations). Germany was responsible for 15 million deaths and 66 million
injuries during WWI from 1914 to 1918. Germany was responsible for 62
million deaths during WWII from 1939 to 1945. 2.3 million people were killed
during the War in Korea due to American hate of communism in Korea.  1.9
million people were killed during the War in Vietnam due to american hate of
communism in Vietnam. 25,400 people were killed during the Gulf War from
1990 - 1991 due to Bush Sr. greed for oil in Iraq.  155,000 people have died
due to the current War in Iraq due to Bush Jr.'s hate of Saddam and for the
oil
there.

the white horse of conquering as prophesized in Revelation for the first
sign
of the apocalypse has been responsible for the most amount of genocide
through out history.  obviously things had to be changed quite a bit ever
since
then! thank god, i had feng shui'ed so many brits and germans into the
rapture!

since mexicans heisted $209 million from the asian investor for the lady
guadelupe film and invested it in MTV tres, making me the primary owner
of MTV tres, MTV tres shall assist with Arizona-fest that had been delegated
to DJ John Kelly and DJ Sandra Collins due to Obama distracting John
McCain with multi-billion dollar federal embezzlement attempts with Paulson
and biased debates meant to embarrass McCain when they are mocked on
TV comedy skits.

Arizona-fest had been scheduled for this weekend: Oct. 11 at meteor crater,
one hour east of tulsa, arizona.  it is a free event meant to combine the
celtic
festival of may day, oktoberfest, with a desert destination like Burningman
in nevada.  dj john kelly and sandra collins are both experienced in desert
events in the SW already, but since this event is in october, particiants
should
bring warm clothing for a cold desert night.  or plan to stay in a hotel in
tulsa,
arizona. Mccain had given a speech in California offering a $300,000 reward
for inventors of a longer lasting battery.  as a result, there has been a
real estate
boom in the southwest deserts in preparation for new solar panel
manufacturing
plants. GM, due to budget problems was about to lay off some employees.
just as i had formerly feng shui'ed 7000 merck workers into the energy drink

industry (thus Red Bull BC one b-boy tournaments), i had posted my solution
to feng shui the laid off GM workers into the solar panel manufacturing
plant
industry that will be starting in the SW.  formerly, stanford university had
won
the robot car SUV contest, they shall be involved in engineering electric
vehicles
that will be charged from generators that are powered by solar panels
manufactured in the SW desert.  this solution shall effectively diminish the
energy
problem out west, which resulted in the California energy crisis.

I am also authorising USAF, Air National Guard, Army National Guard, and
US Marines to assist with the event by setting up tents, mess halls with
food and water, and to assist with transportation to equipment.  obviously,
our servicemen deserve some R & R for all their work in afghanistan and
Iraq and during times of natural disaster!  USAF may even advertise flying
some people out from USAF bases in C-140's.

since Cindi McCain's family was involved in the beer industry, she and her
daughter may assist in acquiring drink stands for the event as well as
setting
up a register to vote stand. i also recommend getting arizona iced tea as a
sponsor with red bull bc one, and subway since there's a subway at meteor
crater.  since i was a part of the pre Y2K intelligence team in 1998 that
made
computer moguls into billionaires, i am authorising computer companies
like apple, microsoft, dell, yahoo, oracle, and others to be sponsors for
the
event.  obviously, all those involved in the last three oktoberfests i had
promoted
for are invited including: all german americans, hells angels, lemoore
naval air base, skin industry, cali BMX'ers and dirt bikers, etc.

since ty pennington had built the pestawas (pestawa was the name of a
US soldier, who lost her life in Iraq, she was friends with private jessica
lyncha in iraq) new home in arizona before on home make-over, i want them
to combine with the US military and some native american indians to
construct
the stage for the event.  this is significant because of the native american
indian four corners prophecy.  they may also get some assistance from
porter goss, former US army intelligence and former CIA director (before
hayden) from florida, who got his job because of me when i recruited steve
wynn and turnberry to assist with development plans in florida after the
hurricanes.

things are kind of last minute and kind of rushed but for further questions
concerning the event, contact john mccain, who i had originally delegated
this event to help him promote for his republican presidential campaign run.

Subject: McCain May Delay Debate In Lieu of Emebezzlement Problem in NYC...
Date: Tuesday, October 7, 2008, 10:44 AM

Obviously, since Obama has used Paulson to embezzle billions out
of the federal reserve into companies that have turned out to be fronts
for Obama DNC campaign financing, it is in McCain's best interest
to delay the debate with Obama only meant to distract him and the
RNC from noticing the enormous amounts of federal funds Obama
had planned to heist out of the federal reserve with Paulson.  Obama
plans to leave the White House atleast $700 billion dollars in the hole
if McCain gets in to the White House!

It would be in McCain's best interest to delay the debate with Obama
since previous debates have only been used as fodder for both SNL
and MadTV to mock McCain.  However, atleast SNL loves Sarah
Palin, due to her close resemblance to Tina Fey.

McCain may choose to delegate Arizona-fest to DJ John Kelly and
DJ Sandra Collins, both of which have experience doing desert parties
in the area before.  This would of course pick up his P. R. in the SW.
but of course, if they fail, the RNC falters.

But one thing is for sure, if McCain doesn't stop Benarke and Paulson
from embezzeling so much federal funds, there will be nothing left to
finance any administration if he gets into the White House!

i did want to clarify that arizona-fest has nothing to do with 'burningman'.
apparently some burningman participants were put under federal
investigation for arsons behind the california wildfires as well as
burning a 'bush' effigy during one of the 'burningman'.  this is also why,
recently feds investigated 'flamers' who objected to a playboy halloween
event i posted on the ne-raves list.  a cult of women mens magazine
burners apparently started the last california wildfire burning large piles
of mens magazine in the california forest. one woman, was federally
investigated, after she confessed to it on the dr. phil show...

thousands of NBC viewers were shocked when the woman on the dr. phil show
confessed to going through her husbands property while he was at work as a
police officer, found men's magazine many of which were just men's
automobile
magazines, but had scantily clad women in them, that she claimed was
pornography,
that she claimed was a form of adultery, so she gathered them up, threw them
all
in a pile, put lighter fluid on it, and set them all on fire in the backyard
in front of
neighbors, who also witnessed her act of arson and violence...

from http://www.drphil.com/shows/
 A Husband's Shocking Confessions <http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/980>
Should you stay in a marriage with your husband if you find out a secret
that disgusts you? Michelle thought she had the perfect marriage until
recently, when she discovered her husband of four years, Wade, was a sex
addict and compulsive liar. He admits to cheating on her while she was
pregnant but says since then he's been faithful. Michelle made Wade take an
online polygraph test that he failed. Why is Michelle convinced Wade is
having an affair, and what proof does she say she has? Wade says there's a
simple explanation and wants to take another lie detector test to prove his
innocence. When Dr. Phil reveals the results of the second polygraph, will
Michelle's fears be confirmed or put to rest? Concerned for the well-being
of their two sets of twins, will Michelle decide to divorce Wade or hold on
to the hope that their marriage can be healed?

a cult of vindictive female arsonists had been under federal investigation
ever
since it was discovered that the monte carlo fire in vegas was started by
latina
"women of the night" workers who targeted some of obama's lobbyist when he
was in vegas for a DNC convention.  they had stayed in the penthouse floors
of the monte carlo when obama was in vegas.  they had called to have the
latina
escorts visit them in their rooms.  they were given knock out pills,  they
were
robbed, and their entire room was set on fire (most likely in hopes of
covering
up any evidence of their sexcapade). escorts were also used to target NY
governor spitzer for the now infamous spitzer sex scandal as well.

there is an annual event in the nevada desert called 'burning man'. last
year,
there was a report that there was an effigy that was labled 'bush' that was
set on fire.  there was no fire problem, because it is in the desert, but of
course, US secret service were highly alarmed by the act.  it may have been
a biblical reference to the burning bush in old testament. during G8 when
it was hosted by angela merkel in berlin, germany, some dark tares had made
a bush dummy that they hung on a rope and set on fire.  obviously, US secret
service were very alarmed by that incident as well.

with burning man coming up in nevada this year on aug. 25 to sept. 1, check:
http://www.burningman.com/ (my old ohio friend holly promotes for it. she
actually kind of reminds me of princess diana born again, check her site:
http://www.myspace.com/8plus), it is likely that these cults of female
liberal
arsonists may have gotten together and started some men's magazine bonfires
in the woods that may have inadvertantly caused the recent bad cali
wildfire.
the first bad cali wildfire of 2007 was started by a negligent camper in the
south lake tahoe area that forgot to put out a campfire. it is likely that
if these
cults of female arsonists had burned large piles of men's magazines in the
woods, they may have started the recent bad cali wildfire.

according to british arthurian legend after king arthur had driven the moors
back to africa (who had invaded europe, killed peasant workers, abducted
and raped women, stole horses, and burned down villages), excalibur was
thrown in a lake and the lady of the lake caught it and pulled it down into
the
lake. i was the one who personally invited prince harry to excalibur in
vegas
so he could be pulled from front line duty in the war in iraq.  could his
mother,
princess diana be the new lady of the lake? is it any strange coincidence
that
my old friend holly from ohio looks like princess diana born again?
according
to genesis, after adam & eve were kicked out of the garden of eden for
disobeying god, all was kept out of the garden of eden by cherubims with a
burning sword. was the burning sword excalibur? was the burning bush in
old testament a reference to the tree of knowledge and the burning sword in
the garden of eden from genesis?

regardless, homeland security will have to question some of these more
malicious liberal women who have an aggressive arsonist nature toward
scantily clad women in men's magazines.

phenomenal!...obama used paulson to try to embezzle $700B out
of the federal reserve after previously already embezzeling $25B
into germany for fanny mae, which turned out to be nothing but a
front company for DNC financing, so he could hi-jack love parade
in berlin, germany and give a speech there, used the money to
finance his DNC convention in denver, colorado, tricked mccain
into one debate as fodder for MadTV and SNL to mock mccain,
tricked mccain into another debate that was obviously biased
toward liberals again due to obama spending three times as much
money as mccain on TV with all the embezzled federal funds of
your hard earned tax money and has been literally able to get
away with embezzeling so much of your hard earned tax money
while people literally starved in galveston, texas after the floods!

obama is by far the greatest magician who has ever lived! completely,
outdoing the dark tares who were able to trick authorities to spy
on me claiming i had something to do with a coors beer ball filled
with flour that dark tares claim was supposed to be a meth lab,
tricking all the authorities there, so black gang members could rob
the other side of town during black friday right before christmas
last year!  dark tares bring a whole new meaning to look at the clean
hand, while the dark shady hands rob you blind!

but then again, if you consider the fact that blacks bragged the WTC
would be the ultmate insurance scam right before 9/11, put out a
black gangster hip hop album showing the WTC getting blown up
with a song about "5 million ways to kill a CEO" on it, rioted in the
streets of NYC against globalization right before 9/11, commited
9/11 for silverstein for a huge insurance scam, was able to get
away with it by claiming bin laden did it by using a 5 year old CNN
video that was severly mistranslated, a video of an old black man
dressed as bin laden, and sending anthrax letters (keep in mind
anthrax originally came from africa) with letters framing islams,
tricked america into the war on afghanistan, used the baltimore
sniper to start martial law and give colin powell the power to give
that BS speech in front of the UN claiming saddam attempted to
obtain yellow cake to enrich depleted uranium in niger, africa to
start the war on iraq, costing over 4000 US soldiers their lives, over
30,000 injured due to IED attacks that turned out to be german WWII
bomb shells converted to IED's after an arms deal between condi
and merkel, costing america over $1 trillion, 5 years of cali wildfires
due to black hate of mexicans, armed bank robberies, armed ATM
robberies, armed store robberies, killing women of the night for their
cash on hand, killing our soldiers after they got back from iraq,
kidnap and ransom schemes, bringing in AIDS, anthrax, e.boli,
e.coli, west nile virus, avian bird flu, and malaria, telemarketing
scams, identity scams, credit cards scams, obtaining a registered
GOP list and treating it like a registered sex offenders list, the senator
larry craig bathroom scandal, the gov. spitzer sex scandal, more
perverse and wicked rumors about every VIP spread on tabloids
than ever before, hi-jacked a national b-boy competition i planned
for vegas for a DNC convention, almost hi-jacked love fest SF to
be a free Jay-Z MTV tres concert (that was financed by $209 million
stolen from the asian investor of the lady guadelupe film that i wanted
to do mind you) if i had not posted security plans with heather fung,
SF police chief (who had been threatened by dark tares ever since
she cracked down on brothels in SF due to too many jane doe's that
were kiiled by their black gang member pimps due to money disputes)
and the california national guard doing plain clothes undercover security
due to black gang members killing 9 people at a halloween party near SF
before, shooting a black NBC reporter reporting on black crime problems
in SF, and shooting 5 US soldiers after they got back from iraq! blacks
have gotten away with all of this so far by bribing law enforcement and
FBI agents, paying off certain people to prevent jurors from getting to
court, and simply pushing gay marriage in the court systems to literally
obstruct justice to prevent the court system from doing its job of putting
away some of the worst criminals and terrorists in the history of america
responsible for 75% of all the major crimes and terrorists acts all around
the world, than it is not so surprising!

with so much money made from illegal drug trafficking, organized crime,
blackmail and extorsion, and embezzlement, no wonder the dark tares
had so much to spend on obama biased TV programming!...

since Batista beat JBL  at No Mercy 2008 and since he is from DC, than as
the primary owner of the US federal government with $1.4 trillion from
japanese and chinese investors in US treasury bonds, i have to make the
federal executive decision to veto the $700 billion bailout request.

since paulson had already illegally embezzled $25 billion into germany for
fanny mae, that has turned out to be a front for DNC financing (since the
money was used so obama could give a speech in berlin, germany,
hi-jacking love parade there, and obama used the money to finance his
DNC convention in denver, colorado), i must make the federal executive
decision to fire paulson for being a traitor to the GOP.

i just checked my telhio account back in ohio.  no funds were direct
deposited
from africa.  today is the ultimatum deadline.  since HHH / the Game won at
no mercy 2008, and his finisher move is the pedigree, london, england won
the authority to bomb africa first for 52 killed during london bombing after
tony
blair announced he wanted to cut niger, africa's $50 billion oil deal in
half due
to too many terrorists coming from africa.  america also had a big problem
with niger, africa, because it is where the bogus intell that saddam
attempted
to obtain yellow cake to enrich depleted uranium to justify starting the war
on
iraq came from.  that african lie cost america $1 trillion, over 4000 US
soldiers
their lives, and over 30,000 injured (most due to IED attacks traced to
africa
buying german WWII bomb shells converted to IED's by african immigrant
terrorists).  in fact, the dark tares under condi actually did dirty bomb
drills in
southern, california last year resulting in the bad 2007 southern cali fire
last
year causing $1.7 billion property damage, 1700 burnt down homes, and 14
deaths.  these are the same dark tares aka former black gang members, who
now work as condi's private state dept. security team that were responsible
for an assasination attempt on president bush with a rocket launcher
targeting
a plane flying out of the LAX they thought bush was on after his return trip
from
china after G8 in london.  LAPD found the dark tares not only with rocket
launchers, but also a bomb intended to bomb the NY subway system as a
copy cat of the london bombing.  they were folk nation gang members just
like al quida jinx (http://myspace.com.djmcjinx) was, who actually bragged
the WTC would be the ultimate insurance scam right before 9/11 (west
coast black gang member band 'the coupe' actually advertised blowing up
the WTC on their black gangster hip hop album featuring the song: "5 million
ways to kill a CEO"). the dark tares were able to get away with genocide of
nearly 3000 people in NYC on 9/11 by framing bin laden with a 5 year old
CNN video of bin laden that was severely mistranslated, a video of an
old black man dressed as bin laden, sending anthrax letters framing arabs,
and planting stolen saudi passports at ground zero.  this of course resulted

in the unnecessary war on afghanistan that cost america $90 billion, 5000
afghans their lives, and a series of US military deaths mostly caused by
friendly fire like pat tilman (who was accidentally killed by a black
soldier
on his unit due to jealousy) and the US army soldies who were killed by
US army sargent akbar (a black US army sargent who decided to toss grenades
in his own troops tents due to black hate of whites).  as a result, england
has
the authority to bomb niger, africa from the international intelligence
director,
the primary owner of the US federal government with $1.4 trillion from
japanese and chinese investors in US treasury bonds.

i will check my telhio account in 24 hours again.  if the funds are lacking
again
on oct. 10. 1:30pm, than hayden, current CIA director, is authorised to use
USAF
stealth fighter jets to bunker buster bomb morocco, africa for 9/11
(zacharias
moussaui, the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker, was from morocco, north africa).

i will check my telhio account 24 hours after that.  if funds are lacking
again,
on oct. 11, 1:30pm, than another US naval battle ship shall be deployed to
the
horn of africa to launch tomahawk cruise missiles or CIA predator drones at
the
hide-outs of the somalian pirates responsible for attacking cruise ships
with
rocket launchers at the horn of africa and recent hi-jacking of cargo ships
off the
horn of africa.

i will check my telhio account 24 hours after that.  if funds are lacking
still, on
oct. 12, 1:30pm, than CIA director hayden shall be authorised to use USAF
stealth fighter jets to bunker buster bomb the south african bank involved
in
distributing funds of americans, asians, europeans, and canadians killed in
africa to rob them.

world leaders green light attacking africa, if africa fails to pay me money due
to me by oct. 9th...

america - president bush has been the main proponent behind the
war on terror since 9/11 when almost 3000 died in NYC due to hi-jacked
planes.  only terrorist caught and confesed to being a part of 9/11 was
zacharias moussaui, who was from morocco, north africa.  africans
were also responsible for previous terrorism: 1993 WTC bombing
commited by yussef ramsey, from egypt, north africa, black hawk down,
which occured in somalia, africa, blowing up our american embassy in
kenya which killed 200, niger, africa tricking america into the war on iraq
with bogus intell that saddam attempted to obtain yellow cake to enrich
depleted uranium to start war on iraq that has cost america $1 trillion
and over 4000 US soldiers their lives, and over 30,000 injured mostly
due to IED attacks traced to german WWII bomb shells sold to african
terrorists that were converted to IED's, 100 christians burned alive in
the streets for simply suggesting the prophet muhammed would marry
a miss world contestant, 5 years of cali wildfires caused by black hate
of mexicans, bringing in deadly diseases such as: aids, anthrax, e.boli,
e. coli, west nile virus, avian bird flu, and malaria, armed bank robberies,
armed ATM robberies, armed store robberies, shooting women of the
night for their cash on hand, shooting our soldiers after they got back
from iraq, kidnap and ransom schemes, 9 assasination attempts upon
president bush.  bottomline, green light to bomb africa from president
bush.

london, england - tony blair headed G8 in london, threatened to cut
niger, africa's $50 billion dollar oil deal in half due to so many
terrorists
coming from africa.  dark tares kill 52 during london bombing.  plus,
somalian, africans attacked cruise ships with brits on board in attempts
to hi-jack them.  green light from england.

spain - current head of the EU is spain. moroccans, from north africa killed
200 during spain train bombing.  al quida suspected behind terrorists
attacks
again during elections.  green light from spain.

france - 20 villages burned in france by africans.  dark tares jumped french
torch runners during olympic torch running through paris, france. green
light from france.

italy - africans most synonymous with labeling italians as mafia to justify
robbery and attacks.  several terrorists attacks in italy suspected to have
been commited by al quida aka african immigrant terrorists.  several
catholic
nuns killed in africa after pope gave speech condemning islamic violence.
several pope visits to america delayed due to africans accusing catholic
bishops of child molestation to extort catholic churches as well as africans
responsible for 5 years of cali wildfires due to black hate of mexicans
when i had invited the pope to oktoberfest in california before. green light
from italy.

japan - africans still try to lable me 'yoshi' to this day despite the fact
that
there is no yoshi on any most wanted list and japan is the single largest
investor of the US federal government with t. bonds, where FBI pay check
money comes from.  during G8 in japan, this past summer, dark tares
used my name for a security breach to test fire a missile in silicon valley
that dark tares claimed was iranian to push a missile defense system to
europe to restart the cold war against russia.  this of course threatened
every world leader at G8 when it was in japan.  i saved everyone by inviting
everyone to the venetian macau to avoid additional security issues caused
by the sneaky dark tares.  green light from japan.

china - i had initiated the WTO in china in 2005 after posting my new WTC
plans Twain Towers (http://mobog.com/rapture3169).  africa got $100 billion
in new accounts at WTO 2005 in china.  africa was supposed to pay me
10% or $10 billion for my services, which was supposed to help finance
olympics in china, africa never paid me anything.  in addition, africa
killed
some workers after completing new hospitals, new roads, and new cell
phone towers in africa.  africa also killed some execs who tried to collect
the money owed to me.  in addition, dark tares sold arms to georgia, former
soviet republic, causing terrorism problem in russia during the olympics
in china!   green light from china.

russia - i just explained for dark tares sold arms to georgia instigating
the
current conflict in russia.  and i had reiterated on how condi sold a
missile
defense system to europe to restart a cold war with russia.  dark tares
most responsible for the hate campaign against russia when i picked
tatu to help promote for love fest SF this year and had even tried to
hi-jack
it just as they had hi-jacked love parade in berlin so obama could give a
speech there!  somalian pirates had hi-jacked cargo ships from the ukraine.
green light from russia.

korea - condi's dark tares staged the virginia tech shooting to frame a
korean
actor as a blackmail and extorsion scheme targeting ban ki moon, current
head of the UN from south korea.  dark tares most synonymous with current
anti-korean hate propaganda in america.  green light from korea.

opec members - most agree with economic problems today, eliminating
niger, africa where oil profits had been used by african war lords to
finance
african rebels that had commited genocides in africa, would only guarantee
more business for other opec members.  in addition, niger, africa tricked
america
into war on iraq to eliminate competition.  plus, china no longer wants oil
from
niger, africa since africans had been killing asian execs who had gone to
africa
in attempts to collect money.  china is going for artic drilling again,
which will
also reduce gas from $4/gallon to $2/gallon once the oil pipeline is
completed.
dark tares were also most responsible for framing saudi's for 9/11 and
causing
unncessary arab deaths.  green light from opec.

the jews - black gang members most associated with jumping and mugging
jewish businessmen in NYC, condi's dark tares  sold $20 billion in arms,
increasing in the death of jews in the middle-east.    condi visiting
khadafi in
lebanon, north africa, notorious for killing jews, kidnapping marines, and
kidnapping american journalists for ransom schemes.  green light from jews.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] My Lovely Love Filled Lovin' YUmmy Weekend Review PT2

Haha... good to see Osby and a couple of the other SFRaves peeps I  
hadn't seen in years at LF.  The thing gets bigger every year, it  
seems.  They really need to do what Pride does and expand into a few  
more blocks to give everyone some room.  Other than that, and not  
being able to find anyone I was actually LOOKING for, good times.

And once again, I've carried on my love parade/fest tradition of  
wearing myself out so much over the weekend that my immune system took  
its own little vacation and now I'm sick as hell.  Why is it?  Just  
about every other major party weekend of the year... new years, Pride,  
memorial day, halloween, valentines, and so on and so on... I can  
usually get out of the deal reasonably healthy.  But love fest always  
kicks my ass.


cya,
john

just let me know which WWE pro wrestler you would like to have
beat your face into the pavement.

since, i don't think a US military SWAT team visit would work out
for you very well, since real bullets can be used now that you
had physically threatened me.

motherfucker, i am IN the US military, and i'm friends with most of the
people you're pissing off here. (btw, we don't have SWAT teams, that's the
police.)

if you want to end up on the DHS's watch list, keep this shit up. since 2
people have been kind enough to post your full name to this list, all it
takes is me walking down the street and talking to my buddies in S2/intel.

otherwise, STFU and GTFO.

Because you'e actually involved with WWE and any of those guys wuld risk
their careers to do a vendetta for you. Oh wait, you mean I *can't* have a
US Military Swat team come get me now? Or CAN I?

---

WWE (when they did a show for our troops in Iraq), 
WWE Divas (i'm actually the one that hooked up many
of their photo-shoots and videos), Gladiators (the
orig. protectors of the coliseum, but also a remake
of an old show, i was the start of many TV shows), 
Hells Angels (did security for last three cali 
oktoberfest, the founder frank was in the US army), 
Texas Minutemen (shotguns and pick-up trucks, love
dealing with 'darl tare' and mexican problems,
Hollywood movie celebrities (i started over 60 movies
because i am a ZBT alumni, many of the major movie
productions studios were founded by ZBT alumni), 
MTV rock stars (i own MTV tres, but was around since
when MTV first started in the 80's, helped start 120
minutes) are all honorary members of west coast 
homeland security, which i started in 2003.

i was a part of the pre Y2K intell team, i got china
the olympics, which involved over 100 nations, i am
considered one of the most well connected people
on earth.

and yes, i am the primary owner of the state government
of california ($8 billion in US treasury bonds to bail
California out of an $8 billion state defecit caused
by the California energy crisis and the Grey Davis
administration) and the primary owner of the US federal
government (with $1.4 trillion in US treasury bonds).
the US military is literally paid to protect me.

Kinda sucks to have to call for it, but maybe it's time for moderation 
of new subscribers.  Kickban the troll and implement subscription 
moderation (with a required explanation of why you care to subscribe) 
and our mental boy may just vanish.

By the way...his phone number has been posted too,  so, my suggestion is -
everyone call ol' Steve and let him know in person that he's a
douchebag....

all calls are traced and federally monitored

ended back in mexico.  some how they lost their

I'd just like to point out that today is World Mental Health Day.

http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/10/content_10176583.htm

Coincidence?  I don't think so...

health day!

Subject: [sfraves] trolls and filters

Dear sfraves,

If your mail program supports rules or filters, and it probably does, I'd like to suggest setting one up to eliminate Mr. Tsang's rants from your inbox.  I've used this method before and it worked like a charm for me.  

Flush your inbox of this nonsense with a simple rule or two.  

Peace,

Peter

odd, i started west coast homeland security out here in 2003
since i am a former military recruiter of the USAF, army, navy,

did you not see the security post i posted concerning love fest SF,

california national guard doing plain clothes security?!  or are you

as of now, you are on the real DHS watch list, as well as the FBI
(i had been involved in
 federal government work since 1994 when
louie freeh was the FBI director), CIA (like i said, i got the last

motherfucker, i am IN the US military, and i'm friends with most of the
people you're pissing off here. (btw, we don't have SWAT teams, that's
the police.)

if you want to end up on the DHS's watch list, keep this shit up. since
2 people have been kind enough to post your full name to this list, all
it takes is me walking down the street and talking to my buddies in
S2/intel.

otherwise, STFU and GTFO.

That's right you skinny little shit, I'm a raging homo, and I have a huge h=

I want to make you my little twink bitch.=20

Better
call out Homeland Security, cuz the "owner of the Federal Govt." and
the guy who "started Homeland Security" on the west coast is about to
get cornholed by an angry WOP.

oh you were the one that dropped off all that corn!
thanks!

ironically, i was born in youngstown, ohio where the debartolo's
are from, who own the SF 49'ers, pittsburgh penguins, and malls
all over america.=A0=20

the SF 49'ers are honorary part of west coast homeland security
as well.

perhaps, they could pay you a visit!

i don't need any more corn!

You will both keep going back and forth until all of our mailboxes are

Subject: Re: [sfraves] arizona-fest...

making an IRC bot to mimic him?

There used to be one idiot on IRC years back who used to come on and 
give me loads of shit and grief.  However, he was a braindead asshat so 
I wrote a n IRC bot to answer him.  Took me about 45 minutes to come up 
with assorted replied to all his comments and attacks.

So, I went on vacation for two weeks and changed to bit to my default 
nick.  It kept him occupied and he never realized a made a bot to answer 
him.  Took other people about 1.5 weeks to figure out it wasn't me.  
Can't remember which bot base but the parsing could have unlimited 
responses to keywords, so I had a good data base of generic crap you'd 
normally say on IRC.

shut up
idiot
lol
dude
sup
whatever
go away
*#%*@&%#

why don't you google instead of asking me

etc etc.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Trolls

i labeled my message filter 'paranoid schizo filter'. as for what drugs 
our wwe fan is on.. i'm waging my bet towards a heavy dose of Azid, 
crystal meth and too much pot. that's just the right combo.. plus there 
could be some instability there to begin with... -possiblity of 
psychosis handed down from a genetic source.

so what's up for raves..? i heard about he hook shop changing over to 
the name pulse in berkeley. it seems like a good time. `;) also anybody 
going to drumcode at mighty on the 16th? i was looking to trade a joel 
mull record and an adam beyer record for the chance to go.. i'm so 
skint/ broke/ devoid of money. 10 dollar presales for the time being. `;)

anyone who actually responds to this fucking retard is more
retarded than him.

when he pops up with a new email address, just block it.  easy
peasy.

i blocked this motherfucker so i don't have to read his stupid
posts.  why can't you guys do the same?  now i don't have to
read his lame emails, but i have to read your even more
retarded responses to his emails.

just ignore the fucker.  by responding to the list, you are
contributing to the problem.  if you have a problem with him,
then just email him ONLY.

sound good?

thanks.

lol, i had been the only one who had posted any real events on here
including how love fest was concieved from day one, the security
that was put in place to prevent obama, who wanted to hi-jack it
for a free jay-z concert and another DNC convention just as he
had hi-jacked love parade in berlin to give a speech there and
he hi-jacked a national b-boy competition in vegas i was behind
for a DNC convention there!

followed by an onslaught of flamers/fakes/posers talking mad shit
desperately nit picking anything even resorting to outright perverse
and wicked rumors and lies to stroke their pathetic egos.

bottomline...
republicans = real ones
democrats = talk mad shit til the cows come home, often falsely
accusing people of their greatest sins from experience!

most important question...
why are liberals / dems on a rave list when everyone knows that
biden was behind anti-rave legislation treating all real promotors,
clubs, and bars as mafia to justify illegal search and seizure by
black gang members dressed as cops to steal property to sell
on e-bay?

keep in mind dems are the same ones who want to lable e-mail
promotions of real events as spam for $11,000 fines!  they even
want to fine families who can't afford health insurance $11,000 fines!
obviously, if they can not afford health insurance, they can not
afford an $11,000 fine!

but when you consider dems were the ones who wanted $700 billion
for their rich wall street buddies while people in galveston, texas
starved after the floods, it's not so surprising after all!

Sean did a horrible job of proposing this question to you guys, so I'm going
to put this out there for him again. Is there anyone who would be willing to
trade a couple records for a ticket to the Adam Beyer and Joel Mull party on
the 16th?  Can someone help this gentle, unemployed, techno-loving freak get
to the party? I know he's got good stuff to trade. Email Sean:
seanocean@defsf.com

you're a lieing sack of shit!

i said: do you understand the first amendment right of freedom of speech?

and you said: uhhhh...duurrr...

so i asked a simpler question: are you an american?

and you said: uhhhh...yeah, unless i want to travel.

so i said: do you want to stay american?

and you said nothing.

so i hung up.

you didn't say anything to my last question, because you knew if you
gave me a wrong answer, i have the people that can deport you within
24 hours.

i was born in america, you dumb ass.  i am 4th generation american.
my great grand parents were around when asians built the transcontinental
railroad.  my grand father who just passed away in SF was around when
asians built the chinese theatre.  chinatown is the oldest part of SF since
the 1800's.  my father is reagan era republican.

the list is not yours.  it was started by brian behlendorf.  i was around
when he started it. i was around when he first talked with laura on
ne-raves.
they would flame each other back and forth.  brian from sfraves. and
laura from ne-raves.  they met.  they hit it off.  they got married.

stop being an idiot, everyone knows i'm most likely 100 times smarter
than you.  i went to an ivy league university in ohio.  my peers went to
stanford, cornell, harvard, brown, MIT, etc.  all ivy leagu'ers. i was in
the skull and bones of jewish fraternities.  the alumni list reads like a
who's who's list of owners.  check...
http://bama.ua.edu/~*zbt*/*famous*_*alumni*_of_*zbt*.htm

i was a part of federal government work in 1994 when louie freeh was
the FBI director.  i was a part of the pre Y2K intelligence team for the
state of ohio in 1998.  i got the last 3 CIA directors their jobs: tenant,
goss, and hayden.  i created the NID position just so negroponte
could give my intell reports to bush during his morning briefs.

i made a mission in 2004 to get $1.4 trillion from japanese and chinese
investors in US t.bonds to bail america out of a trillion dollar federal
defecit caused by lieing sack o shit liberals like yourself!  just as liein=
g
sack o shit liberals caused the feezing of the west coast ports due
to dark tares falsely accusing asians of opium to steal imported goods
costing america $125 billion loss of business,  since union port workers
couldn't work, teamsters truck drivers couldnt work, and stores like
wal-mart couldnt get their inventory any more.  i really am the primary
owner of the US federal government!

$8 billion in US T.bonds was used to bail california out of an $8 billion
state defecit caused by the grey davis administration, thanks to me.
i am the primary owner of the state gov. of california!

i really did post the new WTC plans, check: http://mobog.com/rapture3169
that kicked off WTO 2005 in china that got america $500 billion in new
accounts, and africa, germany, and england $100 billion in new accounts!

i have promoted for over 5000 events from NY to LA since 1984!

i have started over 60 movies and TV shows since 1998!

who the hell are you, nobody i know has ever heard of no damn osby!

by the way, you are definitly the gayest guy i have ever talked to ever
on the phone!   don't call back.  i also hung up, because i couldn't
stand your gay as hell voice!

most sincerely,
steve t 3169

 of An Epiphany Of Sound


If pewp talk bothers you, don't read this.

J.C., you know I wanted to be there, but the thought of crapping my pants 
on either bicycle or public transit was stronger than my love of playing 
on your show.

DYSENTERY > ANY HUMAN BOND

Ok, it wasn't quite dysentery, but I logged some serious time wishing my 
toilet had handles on the side... I was concerned my thrust to weight 
ratio was akin to that of a F-15.  I lost enough weight to make Jenny 
Craig guffaw in disbelief.  I went through so much tp, there is a bald 
patch in the forest with my name on it.  My neighbors left me a note on my 
door asking me to stop practicing my trumpet after 10pm.  The kids in my 
building all look at me weird now.

They call me "the Herald".

On the upside, I went ahead and finally got through "Post Office" by 
Charles Bukowski.  What an awesome son of a bitch.

Understandable dewd!!

Shit is going around for sure.  Only a couple of weeks ago I was coming 
off 8 days of fever.  Shitting one's pants is NOT a recommended choice. 
:)

We'll have to plan another week for you to come down and fuck shit up!
Maybe in November when I'm back in town?

  *NEW YORK =96* Early this morning on the streets of New York City,
WWE<http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/smackdownmoving/blockpartykickoff#>S=
uperstars
Jeff
Hardy <http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/jeffhardy/>, Curt
Hawkins<http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/curthawkins/>and Zack
Ryder <http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/zackryder/> were on hand for
the "My9 SmackDown <http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/> Block Party,"
helping to launch
SmackDown<http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/smackdownmoving/blockpartykick=
off#>on
MyNetwork TV, tonight at 8/7 CT.

WWE fans Jagger & Alfred Nastro came out early to be part of the event, wit=
h
7-year-old Jagger waiting in line beginning at 4:30 a.m. "I came to see Jef=
f
Hardy," is all Jagger could get out through his excitement, but his father
made it clear that this trip was tradition. "This is great to share with my
son; I shared a lot of wrestling with my father years ago, during the days
of Andre the Giant
<http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/andrethegiant/>and Mil
Mascaras, and to have Jagger here with me is fun for both of us."

While young Jagger had trouble with his words this morning, Joey Rotella wa=
s
crowned the Hot 97 trivia champion at 6:45 a.m.

"It was really cool to be up there in front of everyone =96 I never thought
all the sports-entertainment knowledge I had would win me anything, but thi=
s
morning it did," Rotella explained.

For native New Yorkers Curt Hawkins & Zack Ryder, being back in the Big
Apple at a WWE event as Superstars was a welcome change, one that has
brought them both full circle.

"This is awesome for both of us to be here," said Hawkins. "To have been at
WWE events as fans just a couple of years ago, and now to be up here as WWE
Superstars<http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/smackdownmoving/blockpartykic=
koff#>is
just mind-blowing." As for the crowd reaction the duo received when
they
hit the stage early in the morning, Hawkins shook his head and laughed.
"That's what I would like to call a mixed reaction, but it's New York, and
home or not, New Yorkers are the hardest fans to please."

Ryder echoed his tag team partner's sentiments. "This is just what it is al=
l
about, the fans. Love us or hate us, cheer us or boo us, we have been on th=
e
other side of these crowds many times, and for us to come back after making
it, no matter the reaction, is just great."

The experience was a bit different for No. 1 contender Jeff Hardy, who the
crowd began chanting for at 5:30 a.m.

"It's always cool to be in New York, it's kind of a different world to me
being from North Carolina. But especially on a day like this, when we are
celebrating such a huge event for SmackDown, it's just the place to be."
Hardy continued, "I know this move to MyNetwork TV is going to be huge, and
I am glad to be a part of it, as I have been all week with promotional
tours."

That schedule hasn't lessened Hardy's focus, as he is just two days away
from challenging WWE Champion Triple
H<http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/tripleh/>for the gold.

"It's really hard to think about what is going on at No Mercy, but I'm
ready. I will get back to North Carolina tonight, but my mind is definitely
right =96 mentally and physically, I'm good to go."

Hardy, Hawkins & Ryder did more than just appear on *Good Day New York*,
they also judged the "My9 Biggest SmackDown Fan Contest," which saw nine
participants strut their stuff on stage =96 and also gave the contestants o=
ne
minute with a live microphone in their hands.

Matthew Saxon Rivera came dressed as his favorite SmackDown Superstar =96 M=
ontel
Vontavious Porter <http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/mvp/>. Though he
didn't win, Rivera and his friend Gino Cabrera, who dressed as
Carlito<http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/carlito/>,
put on quite a show for the WWE Universe =96 including the three Superstar
judges. Cabrera spent his minute on the microphone challenging the
Superstardom of Hawkins & Ryder =96 who took exception and disqualified
Cabrera. As for being part of the contest and being in front of their fello=
w
fans, Cabrera spoke for he and Rivera, but could only utter two words:
"That's cool." (He assured no pun intended.)

But Hardy, Hawkins and Ryder did choose a winner of the My9 Biggest
SmackDown Fan Contest =96 Jose Vasquez and his son, Jose Vasquez Jr., who
walked away with tickets to the 2008 Survivor Series in Boston. The
father-son duo charmed the judges with their talk of family, and Vasquez Jr=
.
made sure to get the crowd behind him when he exclaimed that Hardy would
walk out of No Mercy the new WWE Champion.

"To be here in Manhattan with all of these WWE fans, and to be part of the
whole experience today has been nothing short of incredible," Vasquez said.
"I grew up watching WWE, and my son has started getting into it over the
past few years, and we both just think it is great family
entertainment<http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/smackdownmoving/blockparty=
kickoff#>
."

The wide-eyed, 10-year-old Vasquez Jr. only wished one thing after learning
of the Biggest Fan victory: "I hope the seats are good for Survivor Series.=
"

The most touching moment of the morning came when Jeff Hardy was approached
by 20-year-old Linda Torres of Manhattan =96 a lifelong Hardy fanatic.
Accompanied by her friends, Nathan Storm, Dan Szymanowicz and Jeff
Rivadenerya, the wheelchair-bound Torres came to tears when she finally met
Hardy. After calming her emotions, Torres expressed her love for The Hardys=
,
and Jeff made sure she didn't go away empty-handed, signing her Hardys
poster and sealing the meeting with a kiss on the cheek.

As Hardy prepares to help SmackDown kick-off tonight at 8/7 CT on its new
home of MyNetwork TV as part of the All Star Eight-Man Tag Team Match, he,
Hawkins & Ryder made sure that every fan went home satisfied, all before
breakfast was over.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: who the hell is osby? super homo from hell?!

That's some really good fiction there, but i know what i heard & I know
what I said, yeah, you can ask anyone on the list & they'll tell you how
sharp my memory is & I remember exactly what happened... so whatev dude...
if that's how you wanna imagine the conversation went.. then fine... let
those voices in your head tell you more fiction dude...lol

Yeah... that was nice resume you typed up there in your last email, but
like if you're that smart, if you went to some preppy ivy league school &
have the intelligence to know what's proper to post on this list, or even
what accronym to put in the sub heading before posting anything on SFR,
then why you doing lame shit & posting nonsense on a "rave/edm email
list"?  Or when you post events on the list, you don't sub them correstly
either.  If you're so old skool fuckin' SFR, then apparently you're not
doing such a good job proving it!

One last thing, am I suppose to care that you were here, there,
anyfuckin'where when the list started?  I'm suppose to care that you know
Brian & Lara?  Does that give you cred?  Does that make you fuckin
"1337"??  Are  you special for all those things?  Are you smarter because
you know Brian, Lara, you were there when the list started, & you went to
some preppy ivy league college?  Obviously not 'cause you have too much
free time, you like goin' to the hyperreal site & subbing to all the lists
& posting irrelevant NRR topics all day long, passing the 5 posts per day
rule, & while in the process, making yourself look like a fuckin' huge
fucki'n mondo ass :)
-- 
Take Care <3
Peace=->Jus' Me =-> ObY {8O)

PS... marta hatchet .. please stop sending me offlist emails saying I was
"PWNED", 'cause sending me 1 word email, geek talk phrases/words like that
makes you look more stupid for not knowing how the fuck to spell or
thinking you're CooL or "1337"... so yeah.. STFU & Fuck You!!! :)  Am i
accepting defeat in the stupidest flame war in history ever to be on the
internet... hell fuckin' naw... so don't try callin' it until the fat lady
sings!!  Oh.. I wasn't reffering for you to start singing... ooops!

PSS... TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF... /me collect old ladies & toofs in my bag ;) 
Miss you Baby! {{{HUGZ}}}

PSSS... Sorry SFR, Sticky, Peter, everyone... last one from me.. Hello
2day.. but you know I just had to respond to the village idiot before he
gets filtered! ;)

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: (?)  New machine prints sheets of light

>>>  http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/10/10/sheets.of.light.oleds.ap/index.html

 

 

>>> NISKAYUNA, New York (AP) -- On a bank of the Mohawk River, a windowless
industrial building of corrugated steel hides something that could make
floor lamps, bedside lamps, wall sconces and nearly every other household
lamp obsolete.

 

It's a machine that prints lights.

The size of a semitrailer, it coats an 8-inch wide plastic film with
chemicals, then seals them with a layer of metal foil. Apply electric
current to the resulting sheet, and it lights up with a blue-white glow.

You could tack that sheet to a wall, wrap it around a pillar or even take a
translucent version and tape it to your windows. Unlike practically every
other source of lighting, you wouldn't need a lamp or conventional fixture
for these sheets, though you would need to plug them into an outlet.

The sheets owe their luminance to compounds known as organic light-emitting
diodes, or OLEDs. While there are plenty of problems to be worked out with
the technology, it's not the dream of a wild-eyed startup.

OLEDs are beginning to be used in TVs and cell-phone displays, and big names
like Siemens and Philips are throwing their weight behind the technology to
make it a lighting source as well. The OLED printer was made by General
Electric Co. on its sprawling research campus here in upstate New York. It's
not far from where a GE physicist figured out a practical way to use
tungsten metal as the filament in a regular light bulb. That's still used
today, nearly a century later.

The invention of the incandescent bulb created the pattern for home
lighting: Our light sources are small and bright. Maybe there are a few in
the center of the ceiling, and a few in the corners of the room. Because
they're too bright to look at, they need to be reflected and diffused with
lamp shades and frosted glass.

OLEDs could overturn all that, with broad, diffuse light sources bathing
rooms in a gentle glow. Photographers go to great lengths to diffuse the
illumination they use when shooting portraits, because they know we look our
best in soft light.

The big glowing sheets could also make light sources out of everyday things.
GE imagines putting OLEDs on the inside of window blinds -- pull them down,
light them up, and you have light streaming from the window, even at night.
You could even make OLED wallpaper, since the material is flexible.

"We have a lot of ideas for what we can do with it," said German lighting
designer Ingo Maurer.

He and his firm have already created the first commercially available OLED
lamp, and is selling it in a limited edition of 25. He expects to deliver
the first two this month, at an undisclosed but presumably collector-level
price. 

The lamp is more of a curiosity than a practical product: the light is dim,
and gradually grows dimmer, losing half its brightness after 2,000 hours.
Its OLED panels are only a few inches wide, and made of glass rather than
plastic. They protrude from a central stem like the leaves of a fern.

The panels in Maurer's lamp are made by Osram Opto Semiconductors, a
subsidiary of German industrial conglomerate Siemens AG, which is also the
parent of Osram Sylvania, a competitor to GE in the general lighting market.

Osram Opto made them with an expensive, slow process known as vacuum
deposition that has dominated OLED development so far. One virtue of this
method is that it can be combined with the technologies that produce LCD
displays to make full-color OLED TVs. Sony Corp. sells an 11-inch model for
$2,500.

OLED TVs have to become much cheaper (and larger) to become mass-market
products, and OLED lights have to be cheaper still. That's the issue GE is
tackling with its printer, which dispenses with vacuum deposition in favor
of a process that's not much more complicated than the printing of a
newspaper.

"We're trying to be as low-tech as possible," said Anil Duggal, head of GE's
OLED research team.

In the next step, GE plans to build a larger machine that can print panels
several feet wide. Its output could be sold commercially as early as 2010,
Duggal said, but he acknowledged that's a "very aggressive" goal.

Since the production runs will be small by then, the prices won't be
accessible to the average consumer. But the luminous OLEDs could show up in
niche, luxury settings, like casinos or fancy restaurants, where the thin
and flexible lights could allow the creation of striking architectural or
artistic effects.

Looking ahead a few more years, printing could reduce the cost of OLEDs to
little more than the cost of the stuff it's printed on, said Janice Mahon,
vice president of technology commercialization at Universal Display Corp. in
Ewing, New Jersey. The company is a leader in OLED research, and develops
some of the organic compounds, which are akin to the dyes used to color
clothes. If printed on metal foil, the cost of an OLED light could be less
than a dollar per square foot, Mahon said.

This sets OLEDs apart from another promising technology that has been hailed
as the future of lighting. Inorganic LEDs, the pinhead-sized lights that
adorn electronic gadgets, are beginning to show up in commercial lighting,
where their extreme longevity compared to bulbs makes up for their high
production cost. Since they're made with semiconductor manufacturing
techniques, a cluster of LEDs that produces as much light as a standard bulb
costs more than $100.

LEDs and OLEDs both hold the potential for big energy savings over standard
incandescent bulbs. Matching fluorescents is tougher. Universal Display this
year created OLEDs that exceeded the energy efficiency of fluorescents, but
combining that feature with longevity and mass production will be a
challenge.

"It's not going to be competitive with fluorescents in 2010," Duggal said.

As point light sources, LEDs are likely to coexist with the big, diffuse
OLEDs, said analyst Lawrence Gasman at Nanomarkets LLC, a research firm in
Glen Allen, Virginia. "Together, they make for a nice lighting future,"
Gasman said.

He projects that OLED lighting sales could reach $5.9 billion by 2015.

Bob Sagebiel, technical marketing manager for lighting at distributor Arrow
Electronics Inc., is less optimistic. Because OLEDs are so different from
current lighting technology, they could have a hard time being accepted by
the market, he believes. An OLED panel won't fit in any of the 20 billion
light-bulb sockets worldwide, he noted. Commercial buildings will probably
need rewiring to take advantage of big panels that don't fit into existing
fixtures for fluorescent tubes.

Also, for GE and Osram to reach customers with their panels, they'll need to
go through makers of light fixtures, and "that's an industry that is
tremendously conservative," Sagebiel said.

On the manufacturing side, there are still challenges to overcome for the
technology, particularly in making OLEDs long-lasting in addition to being
power-efficient. They're gradually worn out by use. Exposure to atmospheric
oxygen, which can seep through plastic, destroys them quickly.

But OLED technology is, at least, in much better shape to take on the
lighting market than an older technology that also produces thin and
printable light sources. Electroluminescent lights, which glow in Indiglo
watches and car dashboards, have been made for decades. Despite early hopes,
they've never become competitive when it comes to brightness or energy
efficiency.

"In the 1950s, people were talking about electroluminescence the way we talk
about OLEDs today," Duggal said. "It's humbling."

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: (?) New machine prints sheets of light

>>>  http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/10/10/sheets.of.light.oleds.ap/index.html

 

 

>>> NISKAYUNA, New York (AP) -- On a bank of the Mohawk River, a windowless
industrial building of corrugated steel hides something that could make
floor lamps, bedside lamps, wall sconces and nearly every other household
lamp obsolete.

 

It's a machine that prints lights.

The size of a semitrailer, it coats an 8-inch wide plastic film with
chemicals, then seals them with a layer of metal foil. Apply electric
current to the resulting sheet, and it lights up with a blue-white glow.

You could tack that sheet to a wall, wrap it around a pillar or even take a
translucent version and tape it to your windows. Unlike practically every
other source of lighting, you wouldn't need a lamp or conventional fixture
for these sheets, though you would need to plug them into an outlet.

The sheets owe their luminance to compounds known as organic light-emitting
diodes, or OLEDs. While there are plenty of problems to be worked out with
the technology, it's not the dream of a wild-eyed startup.

OLEDs are beginning to be used in TVs and cell-phone displays, and big names
like Siemens and Philips are throwing their weight behind the technology to
make it a lighting source as well. The OLED printer was made by General
Electric Co. on its sprawling research campus here in upstate New York. It's
not far from where a GE physicist figured out a practical way to use
tungsten metal as the filament in a regular light bulb. That's still used
today, nearly a century later.

The invention of the incandescent bulb created the pattern for home
lighting: Our light sources are small and bright. Maybe there are a few in
the center of the ceiling, and a few in the corners of the room. Because
they're too bright to look at, they need to be reflected and diffused with
lamp shades and frosted glass.

OLEDs could overturn all that, with broad, diffuse light sources bathing
rooms in a gentle glow. Photographers go to great lengths to diffuse the
illumination they use when shooting portraits, because they know we look our
best in soft light.

The big glowing sheets could also make light sources out of everyday things.
GE imagines putting OLEDs on the inside of window blinds -- pull them down,
light them up, and you have light streaming from the window, even at night.
You could even make OLED wallpaper, since the material is flexible.

"We have a lot of ideas for what we can do with it," said German lighting
designer Ingo Maurer.

He and his firm have already created the first commercially available OLED
lamp, and is selling it in a limited edition of 25. He expects to deliver
the first two this month, at an undisclosed but presumably collector-level
price. 

The lamp is more of a curiosity than a practical product: the light is dim,
and gradually grows dimmer, losing half its brightness after 2,000 hours.
Its OLED panels are only a few inches wide, and made of glass rather than
plastic. They protrude from a central stem like the leaves of a fern.

The panels in Maurer's lamp are made by Osram Opto Semiconductors, a
subsidiary of German industrial conglomerate Siemens AG, which is also the
parent of Osram Sylvania, a competitor to GE in the general lighting market.

Osram Opto made them with an expensive, slow process known as vacuum
deposition that has dominated OLED development so far. One virtue of this
method is that it can be combined with the technologies that produce LCD
displays to make full-color OLED TVs. Sony Corp. sells an 11-inch model for
$2,500.

OLED TVs have to become much cheaper (and larger) to become mass-market
products, and OLED lights have to be cheaper still. That's the issue GE is
tackling with its printer, which dispenses with vacuum deposition in favor
of a process that's not much more complicated than the printing of a
newspaper.

"We're trying to be as low-tech as possible," said Anil Duggal, head of GE's
OLED research team.

In the next step, GE plans to build a larger machine that can print panels
several feet wide. Its output could be sold commercially as early as 2010,
Duggal said, but he acknowledged that's a "very aggressive" goal.

Since the production runs will be small by then, the prices won't be
accessible to the average consumer. But the luminous OLEDs could show up in
niche, luxury settings, like casinos or fancy restaurants, where the thin
and flexible lights could allow the creation of striking architectural or
artistic effects.

Looking ahead a few more years, printing could reduce the cost of OLEDs to
little more than the cost of the stuff it's printed on, said Janice Mahon,
vice president of technology commercialization at Universal Display Corp. in
Ewing, New Jersey. The company is a leader in OLED research, and develops
some of the organic compounds, which are akin to the dyes used to color
clothes. If printed on metal foil, the cost of an OLED light could be less
than a dollar per square foot, Mahon said.

This sets OLEDs apart from another promising technology that has been hailed
as the future of lighting. Inorganic LEDs, the pinhead-sized lights that
adorn electronic gadgets, are beginning to show up in commercial lighting,
where their extreme longevity compared to bulbs makes up for their high
production cost. Since they're made with semiconductor manufacturing

perhaps combining arizona-fest with a big meeting for economic / business
as berlusconi had suggested would be the best idea.  similar to WTO 2005
in china that i had kicked off or G8 that just happened in japan, but with
actual CEO's instead of world leaders that aren't even familiar with all the

CEO's, i would suggest having the big business meeting at sedona hilton
golf course in sedona, arizona, check: http://www.hiltonsedona.com/

here are some links for flagstaff, arizona...

http://www.flagstaff.com/category.php/swmc/flagstafflodging

previously i had posted as part of my WWE solution: if jericho won since i
was a part of the pre Y2K intell team in 1998 that made computer moguls
into billionaires, computer companies like microsoft, apple, dell, AOL,
yahoo,
google, etc. would donate a million dollars each into struggling NYC
companies
or my new WTC plans Twain Towers (http://mobog.com/rapture3169) as
opposed to the outrageous $700 billion embezzlement plan by paulson
and obama.  companies may also decide on investing in the solar panel
manufacturing plants that are going to be built in the SW desert to employ
laid off GM workers.

so all interested, fly into flagstaff, arizona airport on saturday.  stay
at the
hilton sedona.  business execs play some golf on the championship golf
course
there and discuss business deals over golf bets.  let the wife/kids book a
rental
SUV to go to meteor crater (45 miles east of flagstaff) for DJ john kelly,
sandra
collins, and MTV Tres bands.  even if it's a no show for some acts, it's
still a
phenomenal main tourist attraction.  there are spots for RV's there, check:
http://www.meteorcrater.com/rvpark/rvpark.htm

i will most likely, not show, since i had delegated this event to: john
mccain,
cindy mccain, dj john kelly, sandra collins, MTV tres, etc. but if you need

you kick off love fest SF for them from its conception and they treat you

  Berlusconi, former prime minister of italy, multi-media tycoon, generally
regarded as one of the most successful italians who had ever lived as
far as wealth goes (and someone who i had personally invited to the
Venetian Macau super casino when security issues arose during G8
in Japan), not only condemns multi-billion dollar bail-outs, but suggests
shutting down the market entirely to discuss new rules, brentonwoods
style....

Berlusconi Says Leaders May Close World's Markets (Update1)
By Steve Scherer
Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Silvio%0ABerlusconi&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>said
political leaders are discussing the idea of closing the world's
financial markets while they ``rewrite the rules of international finance.''

``The idea of suspending the markets for the time it takes to rewrite the
rules is being discussed,'' Berlusconi said today after a Cabinet meeting in
Naples, Italy. A solution to the financial crisis ``can't just be for one
country, or even just for Europe, but global.''
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much 8.1 percent in early trading
and pared most of those losses after Berlusconi's remarks. The Dow was down
0.5 percent to 8540.52 at 10:10 in New York.
Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers are meeting in
Washington today, and will stay in town for the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank meetings this weekend. European Union leaders may gather in
Paris on Oct. 12, three days before a scheduled summit in Brussels,
Berlusconi said today, while Group of Eight leaders may hold a meeting on
the crisis ``in coming days,'' he said.
Berlusconi didn't give any details about what kind of rules leaders were
looking to change, except to say that leaders are ``talking about a new Bretton
Woods<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Bretton+Woods&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>.''

The Bretton Woods Agreements were adopted to rebuild the international
economic system after World War II in a hotel in Bretton Woods, New
Hampshire. The aim of the agreements was to establish a monetary management
system, initially by pegging currencies to gold. The IMF was set up later to
help manage the international financial system.

here is what must be done...

first, no bail-outs....bail-outs solve nothing except put government further
in
the hole and further bankrupts america!

second, de-criminalisation...

legalise illegal drugs except for the ones that had been proven to kill
people,
legalise prostitution, shorten jail terms, deportation instead of death
penalty,

third, repeal superolous things...
auto insurance no longer mandatory.
drivers license no longer madatory.
but still need a legal ID for age check to keep under 21 out of bars.
unless it is a teen juice bar, than it can be 18 and over.
repeal spam laws, $11,000 fine is outrageous!

fourth, create more jobs

fifth, USAF bombings on africa will stop as soon as africa compensates me.
africa totally owes me $10 billion, they haven't even made a partial
payment yet.

  since mexicans heisted $209 million from the asian investor for the lady
guadelupe film and invested it in MTV tres, making me the primary owner
of MTV tres, MTV tres shall assist with Arizona-fest that had been delegated
to DJ John Kelly and DJ Sandra Collins due to Obama distracting John
McCain with multi-billion dollar federal embezzlement attempts with Paulson
and biased debates meant to embarrass McCain when they are mocked on
TV comedy skits.

Arizona-fest had been scheduled for this weekend: Oct. 11 at meteor crater,
half hour east of flagstaff, arizona.  it is a free event meant to combine
the celtic
festival of may day, oktoberfest, with a desert destination like Burningman
in nevada.  dj john kelly and sandra collins are both experienced in desert
events in the SW already, but since this event is in october, particiants
should
bring warm clothing for a cold desert night.  or plan to stay in a hotel in
tulsa,
arizona. Mccain had given a speech in California offering a $300,000 reward
for inventors of a longer lasting battery.  as a result, there has been a
real estate
boom in the southwest deserts in preparation for new solar panel
manufacturing
plants. GM, due to budget problems was about to lay off some employees.
just as i had formerly feng shui'ed 7000 merck workers into the energy drink

industry (thus Red Bull BC one b-boy tournaments), i had posted my solution
to feng shui the laid off GM workers into the solar panel manufacturing
plant
industry that will be starting in the SW.  formerly, stanford university had
won
the robot car SUV contest, they shall be involved in engineering electric
vehicles
that will be charged from generators that are powered by solar panels
manufactured in the SW desert.  this solution shall effectively diminish the
energy
problem out west, which resulted in the California energy crisis.

I am also authorising USAF, Air National Guard, Army National Guard, and
US Marines to assist with the event by setting up tents, mess halls with
food and water, and to assist with transportation to equipment.  obviously,
our servicemen deserve some R & R for all their work in afghanistan and
Iraq and during times of natural disaster!  USAF may even advertise flying
some people out from USAF bases in C-140's.

since Cindi McCain's family was involved in the beer industry, she and her
daughter may assist in acquiring drink stands for the event as well as
setting
up a register to vote stand. i also recommend getting arizona iced tea as a
sponsor with red bull bc one, and subway since there's a subway at meteor
crater.  since i was a part of the pre Y2K intelligence team in 1998 that
made
computer moguls into billionaires, i am authorising computer companies
like apple, microsoft, dell, yahoo, oracle, and others to be sponsors for
the
event.  obviously, all those involved in the last three oktoberfests i had
promoted
for are invited including: all german americans, hells angels, lemoore
naval air base, skin industry, cali BMX'ers and dirt bikers, etc.

since ty pennington had built the pestawas (pestawa was the name of a
US soldier, who lost her life in Iraq, she was friends with private jessica
lyncha in iraq) new home in arizona before on home make-over, i want them
to combine with the US military and some native american indians to
construct
the stage for the event.  this is significant because of the native american
indian four corners prophecy.  they may also get some assistance from
porter goss, former US army intelligence and former CIA director (before
hayden) from florida, who got his job because of me when i recruited steve
wynn and turnberry to assist with development plans in florida after the
hurricanes.

things are kind of last minute and kind of rushed but for further questions
concerning the event, contact john mccain, who i had originally delegated
this event to help him promote for his republican presidential campaign run.

Subject: McCain May Delay Debate In Lieu of Emebezzlement Problem in NYC...
Date: Tuesday, October 7, 2008, 10:44 AM

Obviously, since Obama has used Paulson to embezzle billions out
of the federal reserve into companies that have turned out to be fronts
for Obama DNC campaign financing, it is in McCain's best interest
to delay the debate with Obama only meant to distract him and the
RNC from noticing the enormous amounts of federal funds Obama
had planned to heist out of the federal reserve with Paulson.  Obama
plans to leave the White House atleast $700 billion dollars in the hole
if McCain gets in to the White House!

It would be in McCain's best interest to delay the debate with Obama
since previous debates have only been used as fodder for both SNL
and MadTV to mock McCain.  However, atleast SNL loves Sarah
Palin, due to her close resemblance to Tina Fey.

McCain may choose to delegate Arizona-fest to DJ John Kelly and
DJ Sandra Collins, both of which have experience doing desert parties
in the area before.  This would of course pick up his P. R. in the SW.
but of course, if they fail, the RNC falters.

But one thing is for sure, if McCain doesn't stop Benarke and Paulson
from embezzeling so much federal funds, there will be nothing left to
finance any administration if he gets into the White House!

Subject: [sfraves] Notice: Sorry guys and moderation

Hi everyone,

Sorry for taking my eye of the list for a few days, while steve 
tsang (aka holyconnect, promointell, rapture t, steve t, 
anything with 3169 in it) decided to pay us another visit.

We've been through this before, I'll be implementing anti-troll 
measures till he finds some other people to bother.

Subscriptions are now moderated until further notice, and I'll 
be turning on/off other security measures as needed.

Sorry for the inconvenience, and have a good weekend folks :-)

oontz. oontz.

Subject: [sfraves] any jobs?

We've all been there. We've all felt the pinch of unemployment.

I have really felt the need for employment lately.. if you know of any 
openings at your job or have any line on any sort of work that is 
available. Please let me know. I can travel to pretty much any part of 
the Oakland/ Emeryville/ Berkeley part of the east bay and SF downtown.

i'm open for any job including data entry, answering phones, retail.. 
shoveling manure, anything would be ok.

sean.

We've all been there. We've all felt the pinch of unemployment.?

I have really felt the need for employment lately.. if you know of any 
openings at your job or have any line on any sort of work that is 
available. Please let me know. I can travel to pretty much any part of 
the Oakland/ Emeryville/ Berkeley part of the east bay and SF downtown.?

i'm open for any job including data entry, answering phones, retail.. 
shoveling manure, anything would be ok.?

yeah those 42 meth labs in Sarah Palin's home town of Wassila in Alsaka are
no environmental threat but the pot growers, they're a real menace to
America.

that's good to know.

I'd have to say, based on the article, you're absolutely correct 
environmentally.  Methlabs are in an existing building, and I don't 
think they are clear cutting areas to make a harvest field.  The methlab 
downside of course are the used chems going into the sewer system, or 
septic tank, which may or may not be a problem.  Of course exploding 
meth labs can cause harm to humans, but I don't consider that an impact, 
more like nature scores one.  Then you have beautiful California public 
lands getting trashed vs Cletus and his snowbound mobile home.

Umm, the only reason that this is a problem is because the government
created these conditions by making a freely growing plant illegal.

Pointing the finger at growers is like blaming rape victims for getting
unconsensually fucked.

So why don't they just grow it in Mexico then?

Also, they don't HAVE to grow it.  They choose to.  Your analogy doesn't

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Know your grower....

Well the whole problem originates in the crazy prohibition of a plant.  If it was legal to grow weed, it would be grown on existing farm land (and in backyards, basements, etc.)  instead of secretly in the national forests.  Also, with proper labeling, consumers would be able to buy organic products if they chose to do so.

Prohibition and the insane war on drugs are the problem.  Legalize growing and the entire black market would evaporate overnight as would the illegal growing in national forests.  Continuing with prohibition damages public lands and enriches these dangerous criminal gangs.  Its a bad deal all around.

Well the chemicals involved in meth production are highly toxic and hard to clean up.  Once a building is used as a meth lab its no longer habitable and needs to be decontaminated.  But true enough it doesn't generally involve damage to forests...

environmentally.  Methlabs are in an existing building, and I don't 
think they are clear cutting areas to make a harvest field.  The methlab 
downside of course are the used chems going into the sewer system, or 
septic tank, which may or may not be a problem.  Of course exploding 
meth labs can cause harm to humans, but I don't consider that an impact, 
more like nature scores one.  Then you have beautiful California public 
lands getting trashed vs Cletus and his snowbound mobile home.

I have, it would be pretty fantastic to always have another "this one time,
I pulled . . . out of this mans ass" story at the ready. I'd be down for
that.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Know your grower....

See, I don't disagree with legalizing weed.  It's far less damaging than 
the legal drugs, and less addictive.  Thus, it's a threat to those 
industries.

Don't blame the Gov't alone in this.  The Tobacco industry and the booze 
market have a lot to lose of weed were openly legal to produce.  They 
have a big stake in keeping it illegal, as do all the mafia growing 
rings.  However, both of those pale in the power of who really made it 
illegal:  Hurst Publishing.  Why?  He owned the woodmills for the 
papers. Hemp paper was a threat to his business so, he started running 
slur campaigns in his papers that got the public terrified, demanding 
action by the Gov't, and they got it.  Hurst got to make billions on his 
toxic wood pulp plants, and the harmless hemp industry was wiped out.

Don't talk about the plight of the poor migrant weed grower on public 
lands.  They are cartel and you know it.  Amatures would be happy with a 
little Roundup, and they certainly wouldn't be buying enough PVC pipe to 
divert water ways.  So, these same guy trashing our land want to keep it 
illegal as well.

The first step though is to decriminalize it. 

So who do we ultimately blame?  That's right - The voters.

Voters influenced by the media, who were controlled by big business, who 
have the politicians in their pockets.

Nothing has changed in 80 years.

Who ever is behind it, there can be no doubt that it takes some serious political muscle to prevent the state's number one cash crop from being taxed.

At around $14 billion annually*, its clear that the state is leaving at least several billion on the table here.  And that's not counting the cost savings from now unnecessary eradication efforts, wasted law enforcement spending, and unneeded incarcerations of people involved with growing and consuming marijuana.  

When the state is looking at a budget deficit of $14.5 billion this year, I have a simple question.  How can we as California taxpayers afford to keep marijuana illegal?  Its simply a fiscal decision.  We can no longer afford prohibition regardles sof how one might feel about it, especially during the current economic crisis.

Now legalization won't solve the state's budget problems, but it could make a large impact contributing perhaps $2-3 billion annually (my estimate) to the state coffers.  

Write your representatives etc.

Peter

*Compare to the value of the state's almond crop which is just over $2 billion annually.

Actually, it's not even tobacco and booze that are the major movers and shakers for keeping weed illegal. 

Dow, DuPont, and a number of other petro-chemical companies were the ones that 1st made it happen with the help of William Randolph Hearts's newspapers way the fuck back when, and they are still throwing SCADS of cash to insure it stays that way now. 

'Cuz hemp and/or weed are ten million times more versatile when it comes to developing new industrial cleaning agents, fuels, fibers, and a zillion other products that would kill sales at those companies once cheaper/easier to manaufacture hemp/marijuana comes into the picture.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Know your grower....

Marijuana accounts for over 25% of the state's agricultural production on a revenue basis and yet remains entirely untaxed.  See http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/

This does not account for other economic activity related to growing.  If that developed similarly to other agricultural products, it might be another $30 billion in related economic activity which would also be taxed.  And none of this includes a tax at retail similar to alcohol or tobacco products.  Tobacco taxes in California amount to somewhat over $1 and its not unreasonable to estimate something similar for marijuana.

Finally, over time, one could look to the wine industry as a model of the future development of marijuana farming in California.  The wine industry is valued at $51.8 billion to  the state's economy, and has an economic impact of $125.3 billion on the U.S. economy.  See http://www.wineinstitute.org/company/pressroom/12072006

In summary, legalizing marijuana could produce a over $4 billion of directly related tax revenue to the state and related economic activity might be 2-3x this amount.  This one act alon could bring the state near a balanced budget.  And none of this includes reductions in law enforcement and related costs.  Longer term, the industry might be worth several times this amount to the state's economy similar to the wine industry.  

If you pay taxes in California, this money is coming directly out of your pocket.  It does not matter if you aren't a weed smoker, you are paying to keep weed illegal.  And Marijuana prohibition is costing state taxpayers plenty, as you can see its literally billions of dollars.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Know your grower....

who ever heard of using pesticides on a what is essentially.. a weed? 
you'd think the weed could develop a stronger strain by living out in 
the wilderness. why can't it be like the old days when the us forestry 
service would just take their fire trucks out on the fire roads, open up 
their water ballasts and spray fields of that shit. from what i know 
about US forestry service is that most of their rangers come as 
graduates from humbolt state (my cousin is a ranger). i think the 
rangers couldn't give a crap about weed on public land but when it fux 
with the water and kills innocent animals then its personal.

do you honestly think anything would get done in the united states of 
america if suddenly the number one drug in america, caffeine, was 
suddenly replaced by marijuana? i've seen the legalize it videos about 
people in amsterdam saying silly things like " idon't 
think"pause,"..that marijuana, um, has effected me at all" lol

i haven't got anything against pot.. i just don't think the country 
would have any aspirations to become a competent nation about managing 
its finances effectively. you think we have a hard time with our 
national budget now? all i know is that i can't do math worth shit while 
stoned. what about the president who carries that briefcase that just 
happens to be able to start a thermo nuclear war at any moment he feels 
like it.. what if while siting on his bean bag blowing a bong rip off of 
his 4 foot bong, the vice president should just happen to come stumbling 
in and sit on 'the button'? ('whoops my bad') what about the nation's 
fortune 500 compnies? the stocks and economy could take a nose dive. 
well unless you would could count on buying stock on krispy kreme donuts 
then you might be ok. `;)

maybe if the nation had no real aspirations or so much responsibility, i 
would say yeah, why not legalise it? but judging from the fukt state of 
affairs that the US is in right now now's not the time to kick back and 
smoke one with your buddies. it's time to get to work and try to remedy 
what is going on right now.. i feel like the US has done too much to 
become reliant on other countries. the US needs to become self reliant 
and focus on what needs to happen at home, as well as put systems in 
place so that the economy is stable and self supporting. then we can 
party `;).

for right now i feel what the govt is doing right now by turning 
somewhat of a blind eye to it works. what is it.. a misdeameanor in most 
of the states right now for possession? marijuana offenses are not 
considered felonies on job applications. in case you haven't noticed pot 
is almost legal already. it's the mere fact that this is the wrong point 
in american history for legalization that keeps it illegal. the govt 
knows everybody smokes pot i just think the they don't want the sitch to 
get out of hand.

Hmm, I don't agree with most of this, nor have you provided any support for the most baseless arguments about the effects of marijuana on motivation and judgement.  

Even if you don't support legalization, the question you should be asking yourself is how much are you personally paying to keep marijuana illegal.  The answer might surprise you; it is around $200 annually for very California taxpayer by my estimate.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Know your grower....

all i know is that the govt isn't stupid and there are reasons why it is 
illegal to date. maybe if you looked at it from their point of view it 
would be easy to see why they are doing what they are doing. my retort 
was largely a tongue and cheek reply to this debate..how can anybody 
interested in pot take this shit too seriously? anybody militant about 
pot rights raise your hand..

i would have to say everyone's different about their pot usage too. i 
have a friend who actually uses it as an ADD cure. pretty effective in 
my book and way better for you than dexedrine. but i also know that 
there are also alot of people that cannot handle it and i'm sure this 
has been taken into consideration. i just don't think legalization 
should be tossed out there all willy nilly. i voted for the use of 
medical marijuana back when it was a state initiative. i'm for the 
legalization of marijuana but i'm also for regulation of its use. call 
me a stickler for the rules.

i also think that the govt doesn't care about pot dealers. i think the 
reason why this article surfaced is cause violent, environmentally 
destructive criminals are making money off of a largely peaceful 
industry that the govt easily turns a blind eye to. when this industry 
turns into a problem, shit gets handled. as it is now, pot is already 
growing in basements and backyards, sometimes whole apartments in 
oakland.. the mere fact that the govt calls it illegal, limits the 
number of factors that contribute to pot being a nuisance.

if you want a list of nuisances that pot has contributed to, i'll give a 
few examples of what i have seen growing up as a kid in marin:

my friend going completely paranoid schizo and collecting guns
10 year olds smoking pot before they are intellectually mature
people losing their jobs cause they just didn't give a shit.
people completely misunderstanding each other
people owing me money who are psychologically addicted to pot blowing it 
on more pot.
too much pot causing an emotional imbalance when sober leading to cranky 
feelings and irritability.
an irrational sense of what is true.
love of unicorns, peuter wizards with crystal balls, and D&D ( lol )

i'm not going to argue that pot is entirely bad there are lots of 
reasons why it is good. i'll even go out on a limb and say i actually 
enjoy the effects but i feel instant deregulation could lead to some 
serious societal problems.

that's my opinion and i'm standing by it. prove me wrong if you like.

Funny thing about freedom. It's about being allowed to do something, even
when some other people are against it.
If everyone agrees, then the concept of freedom doesn't even enter into it.
Following me so far? :)
Now, for one, I have a low tolerance for pot. And it probably DOES make you
stoopid-ish if you use too much.
But fuck all that shit. The idea of Freedom is paramount here. Drinking and
driving = danger to innocent people. This is a good prohibition.
Smoking pot? No danger to others. Studies show that pot doesn't even screw
up your driving (unless you are some moron who rolls while driving). Not a
good prohibition. Anyway, that simple dividing line is where our freedoms
should be.
Even if it means people can do stupid things.  Reagan's first step in
destroying the gov't (bearing fruit as we speak!) was to create the 'drug
war' goblins. (and then abortion, gays, etc)  There is a lot of political
power (that is to say, $$$) riding on these prohibitions, and on the ability
of some to divide and conquer us by creating false hot button issues. They
will make you into a moron/political puppet if you listen to them. Don't let
it happen to you.

Hey dude, you are dissing my pewter wizard collection?!  Now you must die!  

Seriously though, I am not saying there's no issues with excessive or inappropriate marijuana consumption, I am saying taxation and regulation will produce less harm than the existing prohibition.   Regulation is pretty much required to enable taxation I think.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Know your grower....

i was watching last week's daily show online... bill moyers was on one
night. He talked about how a civilized, european-style society was
trying to be born in the US, but a bunch of rednecks are holding us
back. Its really too bad we have to even have these conversations;
that personal liberties aren't just a given.

have you looked into genentech, like i suggested?

www.gene.com

if you find a job you like, let me know.  it's possible i know
the hiring manager and can get you an interview faster than if
you go thru the website.  plus i'll split the hiring bonus with
you.  :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] any jobs?

looking into all options is a good idea. genentech and cal are good 
suggestions. anything to avoid drowning amid the other candidates on 
craigslist. i have found job postings on sites outside of craigslist 
that never make it to craigslist. i've been finding out that it's good 
idea to check all major employment sites. craigslist job posts are often 
crazy individuals with sole proprietorships they are more likely to hire 
you than any of the major companies looking for help. all the major 
companies out there are posting on craigslist in the hope that on the 
off chance a newbe to the job market has a  ton of talent right out of 
the box. or if they aren't looking for a green college grad they are 
looking to hook an uber qualified applicant that has an RSS feed who is 
bored while surfing on his desktop at his/her present job. but i feel 
like most major companies want you to go to them and take the initiative.

seems to me there are better options outside craigslist, including temp 
agencies, second rate style craigslist sites, news paper websites. i've 
even found listings for jobs just by typing in google search for my 
chosen field. often i'm actually qualified for the positions they describe.

whether all this works or not is still to be proven. but i have found 
alot better odds outside craigslist and urge other job applicants to do 
the same. i'd prefer not to drown amid all the crap resumes that make 
mine seem just as crappy... if my resume sucks i'd rather not have 
company. `;)

 (Added a "NRR" in front.)

Er... those are some good ideas, but speaking from someone who has signed up with SEVEN temp/staffing agencies in the past four months with only one short term (i.e. less than a week) gig snagged from those.... yeah, shit's just tough all around.

And thanks again, Michael. I've been checking periodically. I will check again tomorrow and let you know. :)

looking into all options is a good idea. genentech and cal are good 
suggestions. anything to avoid drowning amid the other candidates on 
craigslist. i have found job postings on sites outside of craigslist 
that never make it to craigslist. i've been finding out that it's good 
idea to check all major employment sites. craigslist job posts are often 
crazy individuals with sole proprietorships they are more likely to hire 
you than any of the major companies looking for help. all the major 
companies out there are posting on craigslist in the hope that on the 
off chance a newbe to the job market has a  ton of talent right out of 
the box. or if they aren't looking for a green college grad they are 
looking to hook an uber qualified applicant that has an RSS feed who is 
bored while surfing on his desktop at his/her present job. but i feel 
like most major companies want you to go to them and take the initiative.?
?

seems to me there are better options outside craigslist, including temp 
agencies, second rate style craigslist sites, news paper websites. i've 
even found listings for jobs just by typing in google search for my 
chosen field. often i'm actually qualified for the positions they describe.?
?

whether all this works or not is still to be proven. but i have found 
alot better odds outside craigslist and urge other job applicants to do 
the same. i'd prefer not to drown amid all the crap resumes that make 
mine seem just as crappy... if my resume sucks i'd rather not have 
company. `;)?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Know your grower....

I think the point that people miss that that pot doesn't need to be 
LEGALIZED.

It needs to be decriminalized.  Nobody goes to jail for huffing 
Whippits.  Why?  It's not Illegal.  It's not LEGAL, it's just nota  
crime.  To have some legal requires legislation and such.  Big pain in 
the ass.  It also validates something when it's legalized.

Now, legalizing for Medicinal use, that's a smart move, however for 
everyone else, decriminalize it.

Decriminalize now, Tax later.

While subscription moderation is still on... anyone recognize 
these email addresses? They're requesting to be subscribed:

yoseline de leon <homegirl231@yahoo.com>

In any case, I'll be opening up the list soon enough, just

Gov. Blunt Statement on Obama Campaign's Abusive Use of Missouri Law
Enforcement


JEFFERSON CITY - Gov. Matt Blunt today issued the following statement
on news reports that have exposed plans by U.S. Senator Barack Obama
to use Missouri law enforcement to threaten and intimidate his critics.

St. Louis County Circuit Attorney Bob McCulloch, St. Louis City
Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer,
and Obama and the leader of his Missouri campaign Senator Claire
McCaskill have attached the stench of police state tactics to the
Obama-Biden campaign.

What Senator Obama and his helpers are doing is scandalous beyond
words, the party that claims to be the party of Thomas Jefferson is
abusing the justice system and offices of public trust to silence
political criticism with threats of prosecution and criminal punishment.

This abuse of the law for intimidation insults the most sacred
principles and ideals of Jefferson. I can think of nothing more
offensive to Jefferson?s thinking than using the power of the state to
deprive Americans of their civil rights.=A0 The only conceivable purpose
of Messrs. McCulloch, Obama and the others is to frighten people away
from expressing themselves, to chill free and open debate, to suppress
support and donations to conservative organizations targeted by this
anti-civil rights, to strangle criticism of Mr. Obama, to suppress ads
about his support of higher taxes, and to choke out criticism on
television, radio, the Internet, blogs, e-mail and daily conversation
about the election.

Barack Obama needs to grow up. Leftist blogs and others in the press
constantly say false things about me and my family.=A0 Usually, we
ignore false and scurrilous accusations because the purveyors have no
credibility.=A0 When necessary, we refute them. Enlisting Missouri law
enforcement to intimidate people and kill free debate is reminiscent
of the Sedition Acts - not a free society.

No, I think someone actually got arrested and held for 36 hours in  
Missouri and the Obama campaign confirmed by telephone they were in  
fact getting law enforcement involved in cases where they thought  
someone was spreading lies about Obama.  The person arrested simply  
asked two women manning an Obama campaign desk about Obama's ties to  
Zbignew Brezinski, and was arrested right after he left the desk.  
it's really disheartening to see facism bubbling from the bottom up  
rather than the top-down model we currently have with George Bush.  i  
am certainly not voting for Obama, I think situations like this show  
me how dangerous he can be, and even more dangerous, some of his  
blind, automaton Obamabot followers who will simply parrot anything  
the campaign tells them to do.

I'm sorry, Marco, I should have realized you wouldn't take 5 minutes  
out of your day to actually look into this, all of 3 minutes to get a  
snapshot, so let me take 10 minutes out of my day to show you how to  
do research.

1.  Open your browser.

2.  Go to Google, type in "obama arrested 36 hours" or something like  
that.

3.  Since you might not see it since I had to go to page 4 of the  
search, here is the link showing the News 4 piece the local media did:

And where are the facts on this? 

No facts, nothing to believe. 

And even if that IS the case...is it worse than the Bush/Diebold crap? Or anything AT ALL the republinazi's have done in the last umpteen years? 

In the grand scheme of thing, all's fair in love and war - and an election race may as well be war. Neither side is w/o BS tactics. 

And anyone who votes for McCain (IMHO) is voting against gay marriage, and in my book needs to be shot in the fucking head. why? My niece is gay and a ton of my friends are gay, and anyone who denies my family or friends basic human rights are evil fuckbags. 

Period. 

and let's not even get into all the other republican BS. 

Not to say Dem's are some shiny, happy example of true democracy - but, this time around they are a damn sight better choice.

So, because he wants people to get stopped when they are spreading lies and misinformation, that's a bad thing? Because he'd rather the shit be based upon real issues, and not just smear campaign nonsense, that's bad?

Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight. 

And while the news clip itself was from a decent source, the site you it was on is a streaming pile of trash. Just a little "fyi".

If someone commits slander or libel, you sue them in civil court.   
The First Amendment is there to protect unpopular speech.  You don't  
just go around arresting people because you don't like what they  
say.  That is facism. There is a lot more to this story than what is  
on the surface and the Huffington Post and Word Net Daily articles  
are both just he-said she-said without doing more research.

Is it not true that Obama's campaign was run by Zbignew Brezinski,  
the same man who brought you Al Qaeda and Jimmy Carter?  Are you  
saying this is not important information and it should be dismissed  
as "smear campaign nonsense"?

All right I'm done talking due to let someone else make their point  
and time constraints.  But I will say two things, I was never saying  
vote for McCain, though I have to wonder about that, and watch out  
for the left cover.  The country is being run by the crooks at the  
Federal Reserve anyway, under an Obama administration they are just  
going to mask it under saving the polar bears, etc.  The "choices"  
presented to the people to run the country and have the keys to the  
nuclear football are a joke.

Thanks, Ben.  I was in a bit of a rush at work (just got home,
actually) and wanted to get the word out.

One thing I've sent out to some e-mail lists has been
paraphrased from what Alex said on the FnF list:

"
"The No on 8" Campaign is being outspent 2-1 right now and only
30,000 people have donated to the cause.

There are easily over 1,000,000 LGBT's in California and unless
everyone starts stepping up and donating, equal marriage will
lose on Nov. 4th. Polling shows that amongst those who've seen
commercials both pro and against Prop 8, the amendment loses!
That's great news, which is all the more reason to get as much
$$ into the No on 8 Campaign as soon as possible.
"

Another friend sent me this link - it really speaks to me as to
why we can't let this proposition pass.

Please, if you cannot attend our event, consider helping out or
donating directly to the cause.  Visit noonprop8.com to help.

Thanks!
Michael

This gets even crazier.  As I mentioned to Forest when she called me to
LMK that she was doing this, I'd also already emailed the NoOn8 campaign,
letting them know that this month's Faktion (also on 10/24) will be
donating any of OUR proceeds to NoOn8.  So, not only are there 2 parties
for it on the same night, Forest is spinning at both. :)  It's an
important cause, folks, reaching well beyond this rhetoric about gays,
right to the point: the California Supreme Court correctly pointed out
that it's a violation of equal protection to deny any 2 people the right
any other 2 people have, plain and simple.  This amendment, if it passes,
means that ANY amendment about racism, sexism, ageism, etc, are all OK.

Actual BSP coming towards the end of this week...

-R.

In reading all these posts...

Gay Marriage:  I couldn't really care less.  The entire concept of 
marriage is one of religion.  Good time to bring up separation of church 
and state.  The state can form or dissolve legally binding contract 
between entities.  However, they've choses to put the word marriage on 
that contract.  So, its' simple.  Anyone can be married by whatever 
religion wants to perform the religious ceremony.  However, that 
ceremony is separate from two people who want to entire a legally 
binding contract as acknowledged by the state.

See?  It's simple.  The right wingers can continue to say no gay 
marriage, but they have to honor contracts because they are a legally 
binding agreement.  Atheists can further separate from religion.  Gays 
can continue to drive great cars, have amazing clothes, the best looking 
pads, and get invited to all the best parties.


Election:  Let's talk about money.  Here's two facts about Obama that 
turns my gizzard and really makes me NOT like the guy.  There's others, 
but here's two big points that are the preface to how his gov't would 
run if elected:

1.  Channeling $800,000 into ACORN which has on many occasions tried to 
register fictitious people to vote.  On top of that these "get out and 
VOTE!" org are driven by a single party and are only concerned with 
registering people for thier party.  I know of two other parties that 
did the same thing:  The Communist and the National Socialists.

2.  Within months of being elected senator, who was then Associate Dean 
of Student Services at the University of Chicago, was promoted to Vice 
President for Community and External Affairs at University of Chicago 
Hospitals and received a 160% pay increase by the UofC hospitals.  
Employer received $1,000,000.00 federal earmark, requested by husband, 
after her promotion.

Now, those alone annoy me.  They reek of dirty underhanded politics at 
the tax payers expense, padding personal pockets the whole time.  There 
are other readily available fact that don't involve crazy conspiracies.  
He talked about "Change" then grabs a 40 year incumbent old Washington 
politician as a running mate.  The saddest fact of all is that Palin is 
more qualified to run for president than Obama.

Right, the only actually sane way to settle this is to remove "marriage"
as a term from the government entirely.  Adding more rifuckulousness to
the existing law is NOT the way to do it.  Prop 8, if passed, absolutely
does respect establishment of religions that only allow straight marriage,
while prohibiting the free exercise of ones that allow same-sex marriage.

The real battle is to move every "marriage" license to a "domestic
partnership" or whatever license.


As to the POTUS election, well yeah, I'm seeing the usual blind fervor on
each side again.  Good thing I'm in CA and my vote there won't matter since
the Dem loyalists will support the guy no matter what he says.

I've heard her.  She also gave her acceptance speech without a 
teleprompter.  Balls.

Point is, she has more experience governing people.  Community 
organizing and being a  Jr Senator isn't presidential material.  All 
people can say is "He's Black" and "he's not Bush".  hell, her resume is 
FAR better than Obama's senatorial voting record:  He voted "Present" 
over 100 times on issues.  Now that's a man that stands making a difference.

I coudln't care less how somebody talks.  Talk is cheap.  I value actions.

Well, aside from what Shatter posted up about Obama, the crooked =20
kinds of things that all of these politicians being served up to us =20
as our only choices, which is a total joke in itself, let's look at =20
the facts:

There is a news report out from News 4 that states pretty plainly =20
that government officials, police and prosecutors, are joining the =20
Obama "Truth Squad".  If someone is out saying lies about Barack =20
Obama, why does he need criminal prosecutors to help him quell that?

Perhaps looking at another piece of the puzzle may not answer that =20
exact question, but we can see how the Obama campaign reacts when =20
*they* are under scrutiny of the legal system.  There is currently a =20
lawsuit out by Phil Berg, Attorney and lifelong Democrat, challenging =20=

Barack Obama's qualification to run for President of the United =20
States.    The Obama campaign response?  A motion to the court to =20
dismiss the case.  No facts or documentation, just a request to =20
dismiss.  factchecks.org apparently has a copy of the so-called =20
"real" birth certificate, and factchecks.org is an Annenberg =20
Foundation website, which Obama used to serve on the board of.

http://clipsyndicate.com/publish/video/718415?wpid=3D0

http://www.obamacrimes.com

Webster Griffin Tarpley is an expert on the finance oligarchs, and =20
his books, Obama The Postmodern Coup, and Barack H. Obama, The =20
Unauthorized Biography, are worth looking into.  Remember, this is =20
the same guy who tried to warn us about George H.W. Bush, so this is =20
not a Republican/Democrat - false left/right paradigm thinker.  I =20
would call Jerome Corsi a lot more of a right-wing person, Tarpley is =20=

more of an advocate of adjusting social security to real inflation =20
and New Deal programs to fix the economy.  By the way, I've been =20
meaning to write about this, but just haven't had the time - both =20
Tarpley and Richard C. Cook have good solutions to the current =20
economic crisis, or shall we say, fleecing of America.

One of the things Tarpley says about Obama is, that, if your country =20
is in turmoil, and you have the choice between a crooked bourgeois, =20
no matter how corrupt he is, and facism, you'd better choose the =20
corrupt bourgeois, and if you are not sure, just ask the 1922 =20
Italians or the 1933 Germans what they should have done.  They both =20
thought they were in facism, they soon realized that was not the =20
case.  So look into this, please, don't just poo-poo everything in =20
the name of "change".  What "change"?

Make no mistake, no matter who occupies the White House on 1-21-09, =20
Bernanke, Paulson, and Kash-karry will still be around threatening =20
martial law and printing more money.  So this idea that Obama or =20
Sarah Palin  is going to save the country is not realistic.  Both =20
campaigns have the Brezinski family involved.  Brezinski wants war =20
with Russia.  They are owned and controlled by the same people =20
ultimately.  People like Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul were excluded =20
from the process by every underhanded means they had at their =20
disposal.  Isn't it interesting how everyone so quickly forgot about =20
the vote fraud in New Hampshire in the primaries, with "Butch and =20
Hoppy" running unsealed ballot boxes on high-speed chases throughout =20
New Hampshire?  This system is a joke!  So if you're going to vote, =20
keep that in mind and consider joining the movement to monitor the =20
polling stations on election day for election fraud.  Folks, things =20
are not going to get better until enough people stand up and say no =20
to this crap.  They are literally counting on you to just stay home, =20
watch tv, and be complacent.  It's time for that to end.

I mean seriously, like which other presidential candidate in the last =20=

232 years ever got asked for a birth certificate?

The asshattery on display in this election is pretty laughable.

Political commentary isn't news.  It's best left to the experts:  The 
Daily Show.

Snarky opinion veiled as something legitimate.  Couldn't watch more than 
2 minutes.  I don't listen to Rush either.  Same reasons.

How many other presidential candidates did anyone have any doubt about?

I'm not completely sold on this "truth Squad" thing.  Oh I'm sure it's 
happening, but I highly doubt it's sanctioned by the Obama Campaign.  
People cannot control the actions of the fanatics that follow them after 
all.

Funny, a long time back, I used to work  tech support and we used to 
have a 40 calls a day quota, a quota system much like Acorn. When around 
4:30pm rolled around and i'd have something like 30 or so calls for the 
whole day, you know what I did? I MADE UP the remaining 10 names and 
phone numbers so no one would catch on that I was actually slacking off. 
Why did I do this? Because the job sucked. This is exactly what 
happened. It's not like some fictitious people named 'Mickey Mouse' are 
actually showing up to vote. Of course, if you're good, like I was,  you 
use much more subtler names.

You know who some of these Acorn people are? They're much like the 
people at the tables you see standing outside on a cold night in front 
of Safeway. Must get pretty old standing in the cold for 7 - 8 bucks an 
hour. Tempting to make up a few names here or there on slow days to make 
a quota... Doesn't seem very creative to me...

As for your other point,  McCain gave a headliner talk to ACORN in march 
2006 commending their efforts, whereas Obama worked with them upwards of 
13 years ago. Additionally, Acorn cannot register voters as they only 
SUBMIT voter applications.

Which was meant to say that I'm likely to upset a large portion of 
people with my views. :)

We've been down this path before here and I don't really want to get into a thrash about it.

But this time it matters.  

We're going to be asked to vote in a few short weeks.  I don't love our choices like many of the people on this list.  And I have kids and I worry about their futures.

Think about.  This year you have a choice between the radical muslim un-American terrorist and a proven American maverick war hero.  Your choice should be clear right?.

Let's call this exactly what it is: lies.  

Obama isn't an American?  He's palling around with terrorists?  He's forming brown shirt "truth squads"?  

Come on people these things are outright lies and not worth repeating.  The same people that are shouting "terrorist" at Palin's rallies are the ones that believe this crap.  Just watch the videos.  And check out what talk shows hosts and ultra-right wingnuts are promoting this garbage.

The fact is that the Republican's have led this country to the brink of ruin just as many of us knew they would.  And now we have the chance to kick them in the nuts.  Do it!

Don't let their lies about phony forensic evaluations of a birth certificate image or even sillier lies about "truth squads" convince you to stay home.  And that's what they are hoping for here.  

Don't let them win.

Peter

I won't be voting for either Obama or McCain. Honestly, I can't vote for 
someone who treats me like a criminal for taking a couple tokes after work.

Doug, I think that's a good description.  I see McCain and Obama  
being about the same, you've just got the usual left cover/right  
cover garbage going on.  Cynthia McKenney was brave in Congress  
asking the truth about 9/11, but I don't really see her handling the  
office of President with enough balance, foresight and would probably  
get run over by her advisors.  Who knows.  That guy from the  
Constitution party is toting the platform that is similar to Ron  
Paul's, but when you look at their stances, they just want to control  
people's lives way too much, I get off the bus with the Christian  
Conservative/Evangelical ideology when they start quoting Bible  
scriptures saying that homosexuality is condemned by God.  Says who?   
Who else is running?  Ralph Nader?  Maybe Nader, but anyway, I'm  
disconnected from this ridiculous idea that we all have to put our  
votes behind someone that will win.

And Peter is a good example to me of someone who has some good  
information, like the carrier battle group link, but for the most  
part, is still locked in the model of collectivism, that you can't be  
a liberal and agree with someone who is conservative on a few  
issues.  That's running the mind on a very narrow bandwidth, and the  
politicians and robber barons are going to continue getting away with  
the same crap over and over again until enough people open their  
minds to a higher frequency range encompassing more and more views as  
being possibly parallel.

So now specifically about Obama, we've already covered the side  
issues, the birth certficate, the truth squads.  What else?  I'm  
hoping one of the Obamabots who have been following the debates, I  
don't waste my time with them, personally, what is Obama promising  
that he is going to do?  If the birth certficate and the truth squads  
don't matter, what does?

Anyone?

--

We have this world financial crisis.  We have the death agony of the
dollar as the world reserve currency.  We have the banking panic going
on, we have Countrywide, then we had Northern Rock, then we had Bear
Sterns, now we have IndyMac, we basically have banking failures every
week, we've got hyperinflation, which you see in fuel, but also in
food, and many other areas, so you're heading towards an extreme
economic breakdown crisis, the end of the post-1945 era as (George
Soros) himself says.

So when Soros says this is what it is, what does he really want?
They've got to increase the looting pressure on the US population to
allow the bailout of JP Morgan Chase, the Soros interests, Goldman
Sachs, and so forth, how do you do that though?

Bush and Cheney would come out and say, we're going to tax you for the
War on Terror, and that would lead to an explosion in their face.
Obama will come and say, "we're going to save the polar bears, we're
going to save the planet, we're going to save the ice caps, we're
going to have a carbon tax, cap and trade, on carbon, we're going to
have a green tax, we're going to have a third world solidarity tax,
the only problem with this is, *all* the money goes to Rockefeller,
Soros, and Goldman Sachs.

PALINTOLOGISTS confirm humans walked the earth dinosaurs!


ACORN has had these problems in the past, but let's not forget the dozens
upon dozens of well documented campaigns of voting suppression that almost
always seems lead right back to right wing zealots.

Also, I had to seriously balk when I saw you say Palin is ready to be
president.  She would be a great president in a theocracy, like say, Iran!
The lady wants creationism taught in our schools and thinks dinosaurs and
humans walked the earth together 6000 years ago...    The people Obama has
surrounded himself with, and how he's ran his campaign should be a good
indicator or how he'd run the country.  You even have notable conservatives
coming out of the woodwork praising Obama's insight into domestic and
international politics, and his uncanny ability to recognize the benefit to
his presidency and the country to putting people in positions who are highly
qualified.  Neither of these candidates are perfect, and both definitely
have stains on their record.  Even in these grave economic times I'm voting
on two things, and two things only:

1.   Energy Policy
2.   Foreign Policy

A McCain-Palin ticket will clearly continue the dirty energy policy of
Bush-Cheney, er should I say ArBUSTo-Halliburton.   Biden was right when he
said there was no such thing as clean coal.  By moving towards clean,
renewable, and domestic energy sources, we free ourselves up from so many of
our domestic and international problems we see today.  Nobel Laureate
economist Joseph Stiglitz has warned of the economic catastrophe that may
loom if climate change and polar ice melting continues at its current pace.
Based on energy policy alone, anyone who cares about posterity should see
the consequences of voting for the party that loves yelling "Drill, baby
drill!"  Yes, drilling will solve all of our problems since we have less
than 5% of the world's oil reserves, yet use 20+% of the world's oil supply
on a daily basis.  Pushing a policy that is reliant on oil, will never move
us towards clean-renewable energy at the pace we need to, and it will
ultimately continue our reliance on oil from foreign lands if we don't begin
developing clean fuel technologies on a  massive scale today.

Foreign policy, and energy policy are so intricately linked while we remain
hooked on oil.  The neoconservative agenda has proved itself to be a
failure, that is unless your Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, or David Pearl,
you probably believe we have not used our military in its full and able
capacity and are wondering why Syria and Iran are still standing today...
We need a president who will engage the world, who recognizes that military
campaigns should be part of a larger strategy, not a tactical tit-for-tat
battle that eventually becomes a never ending war.   McCain has shrouded
himself as the foreign policy guru, but when he doesn't know the difference
between shi'ia and sunni muslims, I really gotta wonder does this guy have a
clue of the politics and culture of the middle east?  McCain makes comments
only an ignoramus would make like making a joke out of "bomb bomb Iran."
Even the feeble minded Bush was able to recognize of the consequences of
even a short stunted military campaign against Iran, and when he met with
the Israeli PM earlier this year and was asked for American's military
support should Israel engage with Iran, Bush told Israel that such support
was not there (only to the dismay of Cheney, I'm sure!).

Again, we need a leader who will engage the world, and one who understands
the advantages a globalized world economy that is interconnected by open
markets, one that is utimately more stable than a fledgling hyper-power
running on a quarter tank going full throttle ahead into the blackness of
the night.

Oh yah, for those of you who's major voting point is the economy, an
interesting study was done at the Economist; "The Economist's poll of
economists."   Overwhelmingly, from the economists interviewed, the vast
majority "believe Mr Obama has the superior economic plan, a firmer grasp of
economics and will appoint better economic advisers."

country and the Democrats haven't done anything.  See, that's  
collectivism right there.  And the collectivists use cognitive  
dissonance in their arguments.  Well I'll just say that something is  
true and that makes it so.  Why not instead go through why Obama will  
be such a great President instead of acting like Judy Garland with  
the glass slippers thinking that if you just click them enough  
everything will be all right and suddenly, magically, the election  
system is not a fraud and anyone that says anything negative about  
Obama must be lying.  That's cognitive dissonance.  Throw it away!

You *worry* about your kids?  If you did a good job of parenting  
them, you shouldn't have to worry.  Worry is a negative emotion.   
negative=fear=not the power of love.  You must not have attended the  
same raves I did in the 90's or talked to the same people.  That was  
Rave 101 back in 1993.  We really thought the world was going to  
change because of the rave scene.  And then what happened?  People  
like Joe Biden came along with the Rave Act.  Thanks Joe!  I forgot  
about that.

I wouldn't go so fast about calling John McCain a "maverick war  
hero".  There are plenty of allegations that he was treated with  
special care in exchange for talking when he was a POW.  He was also  
the son of an Admiral.  He also is old and has had skin cancer.  He  
also has a hot temper.  He's also got a Brezinski in his campaign.   
Brezinski wants war with Russia.

And what about Al Gore and his youth brigade, and how is this  
connected to programs like TIPS where they offer rewards to rat  
people out, so now you have grandmothers calling the police on their  
grandson to turn them in for marijuana in exchange for a few hundred  
dollars?  I have to ask that grandmother if that family relationship  
was really worth any amount of paper currency.

I'm sorry, this is total collectivist nonsense.  This is not a damn  
football game, and if that is all politics is, then no wonder so many  
people are tuning out of the television election paradigm.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

Once again, Peter is just glossing over the bad and painting a  
picture that everything is just rosy with the economy but forgot to  
mention dollar devaluation, the largest defense budget in history  
ever passed, and the derivatives bailout, the largest bank robbery in  
history, that this Democratic controlled Congress just passed.   
That's for starters.  See how this works?  Everything's so rosy.   
Give me a break.  Peter is a complete crackpot and quite obviously, a  
sore loser in a debate.

I really have no idea if he is a bad parent or not, but judging from  
his one-sided, narrow-minded viewpoints, and how vocal he is at  
calling other people evil heretics, I'd be embarrassed to be seen  
with him anywhere in public.  What a shame, Marco, that you didn't  
seem to grasp what I had to say in that statement worry is connected  
to fear, but I'll add a caveat to that, and that is it's not good to  
worry 'too much', lest you get caught up in a downward spiral of  
fear.  You're the one that chooses how to react, with fear or not.  I  
have no idea how you'll react.  To my detriment perhaps, I don't  
really care.  But some of my friends have thanked me for putting the  
information out for them to dissect and make their own decisions.

So anyway, now back to the issues here, here is a recap:

Obama Truth Squad Issue - Covered
Obama Foundation Connections - Covered
Obama Citizenship Lawsuit - Covered
Peter accusing Deepfog of lying about Obama Truth Squad, Foundation  
(Annenberg, Soros, etc.) Connections, Citizenship lawsuit and  
generally "spreading fear" - Covered, and beginning to run out of gas.

The Main Issues:

Obama's Stance on Marijuana Decriminilization - Covered

So anything, besides marijuana decriminilization that Obama touts he  
will do?

How about the troops in Iraq?
How about nationalizing the Federal Reserve?
How about gun control?  I already got a phone call from a friend who  
says Obama wants to grab more guns.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  10/24/08 - NO on Prop 8 fundraiser party (FnF/Ambient Mafia)

This one will be a pretty easy one to vote no on.  The bill is one  
paragraph I think.  Why should sovereign citizens, who are above the  
government, not the other way around as the television set and the  
skinnerian outcome-based education system has indoctrinated a  
majority of Americans to believe, give up their rights and have the  
government tell people whether they can or cannot be married?  I'm  
sorry, it should be the other way around.  That's private information  
between two people, and the government shouldn't be involved at all,  
lest it come up in a civil court case.

How about a ballot initiative that is an amendment to the state  
constitution requiring the state marriage license program to be  
voluntary-based?

They have more than that though...  their political, economical 
assessment are pretty damn well researched.  They're very clear when 
presenting fact, and giving opinion.

Here's my think with the birth cert...

It's REALLY easy to get a copy. 

Where were you born?
What are your parents names?
$28 later...

Here's your cert. Wouldn't take much for Obama to go get a new one, say 
"here you go!" and be done with it.  Hell, send and aid to go do it.  
whatever.

I'm forever amazed at people that apply for a job, we the people hire 
them for the job, and the spend all their time on teh job looking for 
another job with more pay, not doing the job they were hired to do.

Thats' because there is no lack people people saying "Don't vote, your 
vote doesn't count".

I've had people tell me "if you don't vote for Obama you're wasting a 
vote because he's going to win."  I couldn't stop laughing.

I know people that refuse to vote because they don't think they count.  
What crap.

The irony with every presidential election I live through, I find the 
founding fathers were so right on the money, in regards to chosinga  
president.  It was as true in 1789 as is is today:  The people are to 
stupid to properly choose a leader.

Good thing we don't rely solely on resumes in this country!  How bout some
interviews, and let's do a reference check as well!  But then again, it
seems that Palin is unwilling to enter into any "hardball" sit down
interviews w/ the press.  Is she really that scared of CNN?  Hell, I bet a
BBC or Guardian/Observer reporter would do a much better job than 90% of our
journalists.  Let's throw the British a bone on this one!

I'll say this, she knows how to give a good speech and rev up her base.  But
beyond that, I think she's a truly empty coat.  She has shown the weakest
grasp of basic concepts that even a minimally qualified VP should have.
However, I think she's going to be back in 4 or 8 years, and she'll be much
more polished that time around, but she's going to need figure out how to
appeal to independents, and centrist republicans and democrats alike if
she's ever going to step onto the national stage as VP or Pres.  Many
conservative intellectuals have already publicly stated similar opinions.
>From what I've seen on national and local news, it's the right wing nutsos
(largely comprised of christian evangelicals) who are the die-hard
Palinites.

What you're talking about is not concerted voter oppression.  If you counted
what you're saying as voter oppression, it'd essentially be in the tens of
millions, with both sides being equally guilty I'm sure.  In recent decades,
most cases of voter suppression (in an organized sense) have lead back to
the Republican Party.  Mind you, as the article points out, it was the
dixiecrats of the Republican party who campaigned on large scale voter
suppression following the civil war, and one would have to say they were
quite successful at it.

Greg Palast is really the expert on vote fraud *and* vote  
suppression.  He's written quite a few books on this subject, and  
Armed Madhouse clearly lays out exactly how the election of both 2000  
and 2004 were stolen through a combination of vote fraud and vote  
oppression, i.e., rolling mass amounts of people off the voter rolls,  
not having enough machines, there were some instances of people  
showing up at the polls and being told they had already voted, then  
when they objected, they were told to come back later, and magically  
they could vote.

But these voting machines are still in like 40% of the country.  And  
even if your district doesn't have electronic machines, they still  
normally have those electronic scanning machines, those can be thrown  
too, though not as easily as the computerized systems, which can be  
hacked using wifi technology.  If we were a really smart body of  
people, we would get in small groups and start monitoring the polls.   
Remember, this same system of fraud gave us George Bush, we need to  
reclaim fair elections in this country if there is any hope of real  
change for the betterment of humanity, which I believe the finance  
oligarchs know is coming, and are scared to death of it.

I heard she bombed a couple of debates.

I think the notion of having McCain/Palin will be having a tired old  
man, who will be a lame duck that starts quacking soon after  
inauguration, in fact, I think I can even hear him quacking right  
now.  But seriously, the finance oligarchs have done a very crafty  
job for creating the ultimate cognitive dissonance puzzle scenario.   
In order to vote for "the winning team", if you're a true cookie- 
cutter liberal or conservative, you have to choose to ignore things  
that go against the unrealistic rigidness of those two ideologies.   
Obama is alleged to be a facist, but McCain is often accused of not  
being a true conservative.

I see this whole ideology of having to vote for one or the other is  
what needs to change before we see any progress.  I think it also  
makes it easier for them to throw elections.  It's just massive.  All  
over the roads and in the yuppies yards everywhere are these signs,  
most of them Obamabot signs, but also quite a few McCain signs.   
Actually I saw one Ralph Nader sign.  I might just throw my vote for  
him, I don't know if I agree with all of his policies, but I do think  
I heard that he supports 9/11 truth, which both Obama and McCain  
basically ignore.  We must have 9/11 truth come out completely.  The  
rest of the world talks freely about it in their press, but the  
stupid Americans still cling on to this fantasy that 19 hijackers  
with box cutters.  So we must have 9/11 truth, we must have fair  
elections.

We'll try to talk about the 17th Amendment tomorrow and how it  
screwed up the checks and balances in the government.

Very good points, the Democrats use left cover to tax you to get =20
their money, the Republicans use the money changing tool to tax you =20
via inflation.  Same difference either way.  Why support either of them?

Nationalize the Federal Reserve, arrest Hanky Panky Paulson, Bubbles =20
Greenspan, and the little devil Ben Bernanke and his sidekick =20
Kashkarry, who looks like he is right out of that movie The Mummy.  =20
We'll go a long way toward economic sanity in this country.

Yes, there definitely is this forgotten issue of whether McCain is =20
even qualified.  And what was with McCain and this stupid move of =20
voting for this bailout bill?  I mean, what did he have to lose?  =20
They had more than enough votes to pass it.  Basically they are just =20
throwing it in the American people's faces, they don't care what we =20
think, they're just going to do whatever the hell they want.  And if =20
you don't like it, we'll throw the elections, and if you don't like =20
that, the SWAT teams will come over and pay you a visit.  And just =20
wait until they crash the economy, just like what is going on in =20
Iceland, and now the supermarkets are going to run out of food.  The =20
people can't get in their bank accounts, and the currency has been =20
devalued.

Tomorrow, we will try to locate the IMF/World Bank documents that lay =20=

out the cookie cutter plan they use to blow out whole economies, have =20=

their finance oligarch friends buy up all the infrastructure, and =20
leave a police state behind and the citizens holding the bag of debt =20
when they ran off with all the goodies.  It's happening in Iceland =20
right now, and it's going to happen in America.  The only way to slow =20=

this down is to make sure as many people as possible are aware of the =20=

allegations the private banking institutions are responsible for =20
these things and preferrably having them look into it.  Icelanders =20
are now stocking up.  This is not a joke.  This is really happening.

Soon we will talk about how derivatives are illegal and need to be =20
deleted from any type of FDIC insurance, which is not what is =20
happening right now.  The opposite is happening.  The top 5 banking =20
institutions hold most of the derivatives and are getting most of the =20=

bailout money.  They are going to use that money to pay off their =20
debts and then buy up everything else that is left before they =20
implode the economy and destroy the value of the dollar.  Doom.  =20
Gloom.  Live it, deal with it, and stock your cupboards a little =20
fuller before you go out to that rave this weekend.

FYI:

I just got an email from ProAudioStar that they have the
VCI-300[1] in stock.  I've just placed my order and Ron, 
the owner, said he has about 10 left.  I had previously
pre-ordered it from Sweetwater, but my rep says they
won't be getting them in until at least Nov 25.

um, no. Ravi is a friend that lurks on sfraves and that is
excited about this product. He thought others on sfraves
might be interested too. He got what he feels like a good
deal on this and decided to let people know about it.

For a second I thought it might be spam, but the post looked 
pretty relevant.

Nice piece of gear, although right now I'm more interested in 
getting one of these any day now:

Great time to buy anything in this bad economy in my opinion, should  
be a buyer's market, talk 'em down Terry

My old buddy Jack bought his Dodge truck and said, I like this one  
with the deluxe package.  I like this (base model) price.

Obama and McCain deliberately stay away from any mention of abolishing  
the IRS and the privately owned, unconstitutional Federal Reserve  
Banking System. What both of these political animals are doing is  
shameful and sadly, too many Americans who have little or no  
understanding of the markets and fiat currency are buying it out of  
desperation.

THE ENIGMA OF THE =E2=80=98PHAESTOS DISC=E2=80=99

It was on July 3, 1908 =E2=80=94 exactly one hundred years ago =E2=80=94 tha=
t an =20
Italian archaeologist, excavating a Minoan site in southern Crete =20
called Phaestos, discovered in its ruins a clay disc bearing unknown =20
symbols on both sides.

The discovered object, a disc about 4.5 inches in diameter, has since =20
come to be known as The Phaestos Disc; and for a century now has =20
baffled all who tried to unravel its mystery:  For there has been =20
found no other object like it, no writing as its pictographs, no =20
inkling regarding its language, or to what people it owes its =20
existence. Yet there it is, for anyone interested to see, in Crete=E2=80=99s=
 =20
Iraklion Museum.

On one of my Earth Chronicles Expeditions tours, we went to Crete.  A =20
must see are the ruins of Knossos, the Minoan capital excavated by Sir =20
Arthur Evans. We also went to the Museum to see the disc; and I told =20
the guide: I want to visit Phaestos.  No one goes there, she said; =20
there is nothing there to see, she said =E2=80=94 just ruins of some =20
buildings.  But I insisted: There=E2=80=99s something on the disc that =20
intrigues me!

We intended to spend a quick one hour there; we ended up being there =20
the whole day. It was a day of thrilling discoveries.  These were not =20
just =E2=80=9Csome buildings.=E2=80=9D  We found merchants=E2=80=99 stalls, =
each identified =20
with stone blocks inscribed with product symbols.  We found evidence =20
that the place was a copper processing facility, that it had a =20
connecting slideway to the seashore below.  This was a commercial and =20
industrial center, next to sea lanes!

What was it about the disc that made me want to come here? Our guide =20
asked.  Contrary to accepted wisdom that the disc=E2=80=99s pictographs are =
=20
unique, I said, I have seen some of them before: Ships and men with a =20
plumed headdress - in Egypt and in Mayan Chichen Itza in Mexico!

You can read more about my guess that they were the mysterious =E2=80=9CPeop=
le =20
of the Sea=E2=80=9D and might have reached the Mediterranean from the =20
Americas, in my book The Earth Chronicles Expeditions.  It=E2=80=99s an =20

My bad!

I get spam that's in the same format a lot.  Reads a bit like "Order in 
the next 10 minutes and we'll SLASH the price in half!"

I was stoked about this until I saw the pricetag=2C lol.

I wish I had a $1K to just toss away on gear right now=2C and I have been s=
eriously considering one of these units (or something similar).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

Umm, yea, I kind of stayed away from Zecharia Sitchin for a long =20
time, the first time I heard about him was 10 years ago when I had a =20
job in Berkeley, and this guy that worked there was talking about it, =20=

and I thought he was strange, so I kind of glossed over it.  So, see, =20=

I am susceptible to influences just like anyone else is.

Now we fast forward to a month or two ago when I heard Jordan Maxwell =20=

being interviewed, found some of the things about esoteric symbols =20
placed in plain day for everyone to see, like the fasci bundle of =20
sticks that is on the stage of the Congress, that is apparently a =20
Roman symbol standing for facism.  And of course, the dollar bill, =20
etc.  Jordan has spent 45 years doing this kind of research, and his =20
wife left him because of it.  Shame on her.

Anyway, I watched another video he was in giving a talk, just type in =20=

Jordan Maxwell and there are hundreds of videos with him, where he =20
talks about how they are digging up things like utensils not from the =20=

bed of the seafloor, but from *underground* when they are drilling =20
for oil.  Is this true?  I think it's interesting if it is.

Then he also referenced that there is something coming toward Earth =20
that is already visible in the Southern Hemisphere.  Some kind of red =20=

spot.  The only thing about this, though, is if you watch the video, =20
there is basically one youtube account out there putting this stuff =20
up, with supposed pictures from the telescope in Antarctica.  That =20
video explains the trajectory of the orbit of Planet X, which some =20
say is a brown dwarf, a long elliptical orbit at perhaps a 30 degree =20
angle from our ecliptic plane.  So if all this stuff is true, we will =20=

all be able to see this big red spot starting next year, and guess =20
when they say this big red spot will happen to be here?

You guessed it.  December 21, 2012.  Laugh at it, love it, or leave =20
it.  Who cares.  The other thing I don't care so much for with these =20
videos is they start spewing out all this nonsense that the =20
government knows Planet X is coming and they've already selected all =20
the people that are going to be taken underground until the crisis =20
passes, and somehow this is a good thing that the government is doing =20=

it all in secret to prevent panic.  How the hell does this guy know =20
all this stuff?

Anyway, maybe we should have a QOD 2012 countdown.

Actually Sitchin's books are fairly compelling considering how out of left =
field his theories are. But sometimes he just gets too spacey with things.=
=20

As per Jordan Maxwell...I dunno=2C he comes off as a crackpot to me. I have=
 never heard of such items being dug out from under the seabed.=20

If you can spare a few hours (or less) to help with the local phone bank where 
they're calling on folks in support of voting No on Prop. 8m they're located on 
Markey right near 16th/Noe (top floor of the old Tower Records.)  Would be nice 
to get the news out to folks outside this bubble that is S.F.

Subject: [sfraves] anybody have metropolis by jeff mills?

If you have a copy of Jeff Mills' Metropolis, on vinyl, CD, or MP3 
please e-mail me. I think it would be fun do a screening with my 
projector to Fritz Lang's Metropolis while playing Millsy's Metropolis, 
here at the Bliss Factory loft.

A big plus would be if you had a copy of Three Ages feat. Buster Keaton 
and Jeff Mills' 3 ages.  or likewise the Time Machine, that would a be a 
killer matinee. `;)
e-mail me back if you and we'll set a date to invite friends, share some 
beer & snax.

respect,
sean.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  10/24/08 - NO on Prop 8 fundraiser party (FnF/Ambient Mafia)

Hey Everyone,

As you know, we're doing a "No on 8" Fundraiser with the
Friends and Family crew this Friday.

We've got a great lineup, and the party's for a good cause. 
There are easily over 1,000,000 LGBT's in California and unless
everyone starts stepping up and donating, equal marriage will
lose on Nov. 4th. Polling shows that amongst those who've seen
commercials both pro and against Prop 8, the amendment loses!
That's great news, which is all the more reason to get as much
$$ into the No on 8 Campaign as soon as possible.

Please come out and support!

Here's Michael Savage promoting something.  What is he promoting =20
besides the Iraq War?  Let's flesh this out together.

--

And eventually you're gonna find that we need more of the humiliation =20
tactics, not less. ... I don't know what its gonna take for you to =20
finally welcome what the troops are doing, what the interrogators were =20
doing until you finally recognize the enemy, the true face of the =20
enemy and what its gonna take to break this death grip that they seem =20
to have on the minds of the Democrats.

These people live only for their honor, and so the only thing you can =20
withhold from them is their honor. There is the answer as to why you =20
see these graphic pictures. These are not a few individuals who made =20
this up. That's crap. That's crap in my opinion. This came from the =20
top. And how high up it goes I don't know but frankly I commend them =20
for it. It's wise intelligence techniques, to break the enemy where =20
he's vulnerable, not try to get him where he's strong.

And I think there should be no mercy shown to these sub-humans. I =20
believe that a thousand of them should be killed tomorrow. I think a =20
thousand of them held in the Iraqi prison should be given 24 hour -- a =20
trial and executed. I think they need to be shown that we are not =20
going to roll over to them. It won't happen. It won't happen because =20
of the CBS Communists. It won't happen because of the CNN traitors. I =20
won't happen because of the MSNBC empty heads. And we the people are =20
the ones who are going to suffer today.

Not looking for a flame war, but I would like to know if someone could
give me some more info about this proposition. Sounds good on the
surface, is there any reason I should NOT vote for it?=20

Feel free to reply on or offlist.

It looks pretty straightforward but the test is to read the text of  
the bill to see if there are any hidden agendas promoting things like  
the Animal ID Act which is really geared to shut down the family farm  
or creating another state agency to enforce these new rules.  That  
doesn't sound like it's the case here on the surface, rather it seems  
like it would make things like free range eggs mandatory by law.   
Morally, probably a good thing.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: [political] Prop 2

Hmm, I' started here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_2

FWIW I already buy all cage free eggs and won't eat veal. 

One thing to consider might be the negative economic effects, which opponents suggest might cost the state over 3000 jobs.  While that seems to me to be somewhat overstated, it certainly would cost money to implement this law and that would either be passed on to the consumer (highly likely) and/or result in some egg production moving out of the state to locations where the law doesn't apply.  Voting for higher food prices seems like a bad idea to me right now, but I haven't voted yet.

If you are looking for an opposing viewpoint from an animal rights advocate read this: http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/?p=165

Michael Alan Weiner is promoting what he's always promoting: His 
merchandise & advertising empire. From your excerpt though, it would 
seem like he's promoting genocide.

Funniest thing I find about him is that he lambastes San Francisco for 
destroying America and regularly refers to San Francisco as San 
Fran-Freako, yet he himself lives in the SF bay area and broadcasts from 
San Francisco!

Anyone who's listened to his show might find Salon's article on him 
interesting:

The Republican Party is the best thing that ever happened to the Democrats.

Numbers don't lie, the Dems have the majority of Governorships, State
Legislatures, Congress and The US Senate, and have for the last 2 years now,
except for the Presidency, and all those positions are expected to increase
by a significant margin in all those above categories.

Sarah Palin injected $150+ million into Obama's campaign just by being her
simple, down-home sexy self, and as a result of this fools comments her
Democratic opponent *for her Congressional seat, * *Elwyn Tinklenberg *of
Minnesota took just one weekend to raise just under a $1 million bucks for
his campaign, when it took him over a full year to raise his first million.

Al Franken for Senator in that State has been a long-shot from day one, but
he just moved up dramatically in the last month on the IEM:

http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/markets/data_MNSen08.html
http://iemweb.biz.uiowa.edu/graphs/graph_MNSen08_WTA.cfm

This is largely because Franken's opponent, the current incumbent has been
running smear/character assasination ads and the voters there are just fed
up with that approach.

That sound you're hearing over the incessant backfiring of the Republican
campaigns nationwide is the sound of ropes and pulleys moving at a rapid
rate of speed as these assholes are getting lifted by their own petards, all
across the fruited plain, and from sea to motherfucking shining sea.

Couldn't happen to a better class of people, and I mean that in the nicest
way.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Daily show last night / Palin

She's pandering to the Christian conservative arm of the liberty  
movement, so it's my bet she'll sort of dance around talking about  
globilization, etc.  Nancy Pelosi and anyone who voted for that  
banker bailout bill needs to be thrown out of office.  A lot of these  
people are in a very tough position, look at how they all covered up  
for Bush with Pelosi declaring impeachment to be off the table.  I  
doubt Sarah Palin had anything to say that was that specific with  
names, and I doubt Barkey Obama or Joe Biden are either.

In fact, from what I see, because I'm starting to get a little better  
than a thumbnail sketch of the elaborate game being played here in  
the public arena, is, just a minute

things are not going to get any better, in fact I do believe they  
will get quite a bit worse, until the people that control the money  
system are sent to prison for the crimes they are committing against  
the entire world.  So no matter which one of these clowns you vote  
for, know that, and pray for a divided government, i.e., if you vote  
McCain, hope for a Democratic Congress, if you vote Obama, hope for a  
Republican Congress.  This way, you can at least put the brakes on  
some of the rampant tyranny like extending the Patriot Act, etc.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Wed)

Here is something else you'll probably never hear Barkey or McCain =20
talk about.  Dr. Rima Laibow and her husband, retired Major General =20
Stubblebine are flying all over the world and educating people about =20
the dangers of Codex Alimantarius.

It's a conspiracy, they are trying to kill 80-90% of the world's =20
population, and they will achieve this goal if this is allowed to be =20
implemented.

--

Let me assure you that absolutely nothing that I'm going to tell you
is exaggerated, is interpolated, or is imagined.  Everything I'm going
to tell you is documented.

He who controls food controls the world.  Well, they said in 1962 that
we are going to work toward total global implementation of Codex
Alemantarius on December 31, 2009.  They were sort of guidelines.

Now Codex Alemantarius commission is administered by the WHO, the
World Health Organization, and the FAO, the Food and Agricultural
Organization, they fund Codex and they run it at the request of the
UN.  So they're Mommy and Daddy to Codex Alemantarius.

In 1994, Codex, with no notice in this country whatsoever, declared
nutrients, put on your intellectual seat belts, declared nutrients to
be toxins.

They're poisons.

Under Codex, every dairy cow on the planet *must* be treated with
Monsanto's recombinant bovine growth hormone.  Furthermore, under
Codex, every animal on the planet used for food *must* be treated with
subclinical antibiotics, and *must* be treated with agonist growth
hormones.

If you do the numbers with the FAO projections, the epidemioligical
projections, *they* estimate, not I, that *just* the vitamin and
mineral guideline alone, when it goes into global implementation on
December 31, 2009, will result in *3 billion* that's *b*, *bad*,
*big*, deaths, one billion through simple starvation.

Those people are not particularly economically successful from the
view of the corporations.

But the next 2 billion, they will die from the preventable diseases of
undernutrition.

Who will live?  Probably those who are wealthy enough to have their
own pushers of clean food and nutrients.

So we need your help, because the United States leadership is
literally what is going to save the population of the planet.

I can't stand sitting back and lurking anymore.
deepSMOG, you are intellectually void. You ramble in re-processed,
combination talking points. You believe any conspiracy theory, formulated as
they are by psychological salesmen, to pander to the C- crowd. A group of
the public who believes they are the A+ crowd, as they are too stupid to
understand that they are actually quite ignorant.. Your words are
meaningless, attempting to impress, and without logic.  You appear to be a
semi-uneducated military brat who grew up in a catholic household, having
closeted himself away, so as to avoid defaming his parents and thus shutting
off the flow of support.
Your kindergarten theory (in a previous rant)  is a perfect example of  you
perverse, wanna-be hippy, self-righteous blather. Pitch perfect with the
logic associated with the crazies who entertain on the soapbox in the square
at UCB.

To clarify: Nothing happens in a two party system where the executive branch
is in contrary motion to the legislative. It is so naive to believe that the
checks and balance system engineered 200+ years ago is rational in todays
climate. It is a righteous idea, but not working at the moment for many
reasons. If only they would amend Robert's Rules, to adjust for, and to
dismantle, the silent veto via a filibuster. Then, the checks and balances
you naively believe in would prove true. As of now, they are as broken as
earmarks, and the complete lack of Politics in politics.

What we do need is a vibrant young set of idealist politicians practicing a
craft lost to the slack-jawed, dim-witted people voting for us in Congress
and the Senate. Politics is an art born with communication and fine tuned by
"The Game of Houses" in the Roman Era, or the "Art of Courtly Love" in the
age of adventure. We need SMART, well-intentioned leaders, acting in the
common good, without reciprocity or self-interest to lead us into the
future. We need a reset, a fundamental change, an era of single-minded
coming together for the common good, while separating idealism from
fanaticism. We need to be better, cheer the elite, the smart, the warrior,
and the worker. We must end this sickening era where commoners have come to
power, and destroyed our civilization. Their ideas have proven ill-fated ans
narrow-minded. They need to be heard by others, not speaking for many.

Don't wish for a friend or Joe anybody to rule and make rules. Pray for
genius, ingenuity, tact, and skill as an orator. Hope that soon, common
people will again look to the Elitists for a remarkable new era, and stop
wishing for a man/woman they would like to chill with or fuck as the leader
of the free world.

We are an international joke. The Europeans seek elite leadership, and feel
pride when their leaders speak. They have a right to look down their noses
at us, as they are at this time better than we.

We are all patriots by birth. Nothing you say or do can change that. Rage
against the machine and you are as patriotic as a warrior, for in your rage
you expose our reason d'etre, and thus display your patriotism not by words,
but by the rights you evoke.

SO deepSMOG, you are no elitist. You are certainly not someone I would like
to have supper with. You were never "an old school SF DJ" as you often
claim. You are smog. You are smug. You are beatle beneath an off balance
boulder. SQUISH.

Hey Peter,

We'll be keeping a master list at the door.  There should have been a note 
on your paypal receipt asking for you to print it & bring it with you to the 
event.  Did that show up for you on your receipt?  Let me know if it didn't 
and I'll see if I can't fix that.
We also be contacting everyone who's purchased tickets via email personally 
reminding them to do this and for other info updates like what type of info 
to give your guests if you bought more than one tickets.

I wish we could have done actual ticket.  I love 'em as souveniers if 
anything. Maybe next time...

Did that clear things up for ya?

Hey Dragn'fly,

Are Prohibition pre-sales tickets going to be mailed or just a list at the 
door?

Thanks!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] deepSMOG and the void. I cannot lurk anymore.

When did I say I was an old school SF DJ?

What is that?

Osby?

You know, I don't even know who you are, but it sounds like you've  
got some "nifty" little ideas on how things should run ...  
unfortunately I don't see any desire on your part to do anything  
about it except support politics in hopes that the masses will elect  
altruistic leaders and just sit around and wait for them to solve all  
the problems in the world created by the evil Zionists.  If it's such  
a great solution, why don't you run for public office?  Oh, yes, we  
need smarter leaders, that's it.  Just sit around and complain about  
everything until then, is that it?

You can go ahead and not include me in your little fantasy that  
everyone is a 'patriot'.  I'm not a patriot, I just want to live my  
life, own a small business, and hang out with cool people.  The  
common criminals running the Executive and infecting large parts of  
the Legislative and Judicial branches are point blank getting in the  
way of that.  And I just got a phone call from someone on my private  
list today saying he has looked into this stuff and is finding a lot  
of it to be true.  But if the information I am doing you the favor of  
passing on to you to analyze and spin your own opinion on is too much  
for you to handle, I suggest putting my email address in your spam  
filter so you don't see it.  I'm sure more than a few have mine in  
there, and there are a few people on SFraves I have in my spam list,  
so I never see their posts or get their private nonsensical insults.

You should now know who you are, person who sends me private  
nonsensical insults.

It's an insult to the sewage, but I support it.

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] 24 October (this friday!) Heroic Robot! Lil Roj! Forest Green! Snoek! No On 8!


Friday, 24 October 2008

RAY presents: 

F A K T I O N : san francisco's fastest growing techno cult!

Friday, 26 September 2008:
LIL ROJ: SubSensory [ Portland ]
FOREST GREEN: CuteFang|FnF|Faktion|SisterSF|DEF [ SF ]
SNOEK: Sick!|GoodBadGuy [ SF ]
live webcast via Radio Integrated!
visuals by HEROIC ROBOT!

LIL ROJ: Originally from the Big Easy, Lil Roj has been touring the US for a
decade now, making dance floors bump in big clubs and underground warehouse
alike.  Currently living in Portland, Roj is a superlative example of how
West Coast Techno challenges the bigger known regions with quality over
quantity.

FOREST GREEN: Standard bearer for techno in San Francisco through even its
most silent days, Forest remains one of the busiest DJs in this city by the
bay, yet always manages to make each set a fresh and unique experience.
Recently returning to focus on production, she's still known for her ability
to select and mix tracks that get every audience dancing.

SNOEK: Having played in locales as diverse as the Netherlands and the Middle
East, Snoek, aka That Fucking Guy/Meekrob heads up his own parties yet remains
humble and works tirelessly to further the local techno scene any way he can.



OK folks, with the election looming, we've found ourselves with a bit of a
decision to make.  We're certainly not trying to tell anyone else how to
feel politically.  We do, however, see a rather significant issue.  When
the state supreme court made its decision on gay marriage, it made the rather
clear statement that did so based on equal enforcement of the law, a basic
tenet of the state constitution.  If proposition 8 is allowed to pass, it
actually sets the rather dangerous precedent of saying a simple vote can
overturn basic constitutional rights simply because there is some tradition
in support of discriminating, whether it be on race, sex, age or anything
else.  This is something we cannot simply ignore, proceeds after expenses
from this month's Faktion, will go to support the No On Proposition 8
campaign.  What expenses?  Well, we're not just bringing out a bunch of free
local DJs for your money, we're flying LIL ROJ in from Portland!  Roj has
been playing in various locales in the US for a decade, but this will be his
first SF appearance.  We've also got local representation with Faktion
resident FOREST GREEN, who'll be playing 2 NoOn8 parties in one night
(Another party is happening in the east bay if you can't make it to SF),
and Sick! mastermind SNOEK coming in.  HEROIC ROBOT returns again with their
uniquely innovative visual style all night!



4th Fridays @ Anu

Anu-Bar 
43 Sixth St., San Francisco, CA
10 PM to 2 AM 21+

Subject: [sfraves] RSVP: Sunday 10-26 Fritz Lang vs. Jeff Mills  "Metropolis"

Since everyone's BSPing like mad for what's shaping up to be a nice 
weekend for techno.. Pulse on Thurs, Faktion on Fri.. I thought I would 
add to the mix and invite some people over this Sunday (10-26) for a 
video projector screening of the silent film epic:

*Metropolis*
directed by Fritz Lang 1927
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NarN046dDOQ

with the soundtrack thankfully removed and replaced by none other than

Jeff Mills ambient soundtrack: "Metropolis"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDh5h8QWL8c

Screening starts at 10pm this Sunday at the Bliss Factory Studio loft 
and will be followed by music and random debauchery.

If you would like to participate in the screening. Please contact me for 
directly for directions. Please be prepared to bring your own lawn 
chairs and enough byob and snacks to share.


respect,
Sean

More blabber.
You are just an insignificant, fat little troll, who spreads his meaningless
blabber via a QOTD to a music and culture list. You have more time to spend
than any 40 year old virgin should have on his hands. In the RAVE Scene, you
were never relevant. Even less so now. You are idea-less. So un-creative
that you miss the mocking of the term patriot, even when it is spelled out
so soundly in metaphor.

Your drivel about being a significant old school SF DJ is actually well
documented on SFR. Most recently in the era of your failed attempts at
writing critical reviews, which you posted to your own website, pretending
to have published them.

The most irritating and offensive part of your spittle, is the simple fact
that you seem to believe you are a philosopher. The fatal flaw, you create a
claim, find a ludicrous miscreant ranter to site as source, and thus reverse
engineer a supposed thought. Rather, you ought to immerse yourself in facts,
drink in the editorial, think about the psychology of mass manipulation, and
then derive a statement that has value and merit. Still, as shallow as your
thoughts are, when you find yourself coming to the same conclusions as the
"spin room," spare us your rant. Start over. When one day you come to
understand the fabric of population control ( government), when you start to
see the threads in the weave, and can understand what else unravels by
pulling a single thread from the weave,  only then will you understand the
irritation created by your prolific attempts at "being all smart and stuff."

Whoa dude - I mean, there's no love lost between me and the
fog-man, but where the hell is this coming from?

This is a pretty brutal attack that basically came out of
nowhere, save the fact that you don't agree with or like his
posts.

If you don't like his e-mails, just filter them to the trash.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] deepSMOG and the void. I cannot lurk anymore.

is it still Mercury Retrograde???  Why is it that 2008's had soooooooooo
many tough talking, big word speaking people who just spread this mondo
yucky hate... what's wrong with you people???

I Love Deepfog & as long as I've known him & been on this list, I've
always enjoyed his company & enjoy his QOTD diddies (esp when he used to
quote Geri Dahl... lolololmao... Hello 2day)

Whoever you are, I'm guessin' you either have a personal thing against
deep & you're like tryin' to be hardcore typing words like behind a
computer soundin' like mondo tough guy (or girl) & probably hiding behind
a fake name as well so you can talk shit which just makes you like further
in a hole 'cause you gotta front... OR... you're some newbie who went
through archieves & needed a target & thought Deep was a good one 'cause
he's always had his thing on here 'cause you to be like mondo jealous
'cause you don't have your thing!

Seriously, Deep's beeen part of the SFR community probably longer than you
been on the list & I know he's contributed alot to this scene as a DJ, a
promoter, & a source of good energy for every event!  I don't see why you
gotta bag on someone 'cause of his nrr thing on here!  OH, & yeah... all
his quotes aren't pollitcal either, so don't even go there man... so
hardcore lamesauce to the max!!

BTW, posting things online like articles, reviews, etc. are actually
considered published works 'cause they can e referenced in bibliographies.
 So things he did write on his own site is actually work cited material.

Also Deep's never pretended to be anyone he isn't.  He doesn't need a fake
name to post on here "Brett"!

Wow, Michael and Osby are two of my favorite people on the list.  However, =
as one of the people that Deepfog has targeted with his little "QOD" trolls=
 over the years, I'll say that I strongly disagree with them here.=0A=0AI t=

many of you know I have personally objected to many of Deepfog's previous r=

ep posting racist (yes many of the people he quotes are racists and white n=
ationalists) and other similar paranoid garbage here he shouldn't be surpri=
sed if people get irritated about it.  In fact, just my opinion, I think th=
is *why* deepfog posts this stuff .  He wants to irritate people to get att=
ention.  That's pretty normal for a five year old that doesn't know any bet=

serious emotional difficulties.  =0A=0ATherefore I, and I imagine a number =

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: first/last word on Palin

OK, this should be the last word on Sarah Palin, and in a way it's the
first.  This is her hometown, where she's from.

You probably heard of her saying a day or two ago that the SMALL towns are
the PRO-American parts of the country, where the REAL Americans live.  Jon
Stewart's show decided they should find out what she meant, and where better
than Wasilla!

http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/daily-show-understanding-real-america

OK, so the footage of lunkheads and hypocritical christians are more
entertainment than news.  You can find them anywhere.  But then they
interview Dianne Keller, the current Mayor of Wasilla, by definition a
representative of the city, with obvious understanding of what it means to
be mayor there.  Get this:

* She says that being mayor there "absolutely" prepares one to be vice
president.  When asked, "how".  She's all moose in the headlights.

* The interviewer tries to help by suggesting some parallel between running
the fire department and some part of the US executive.  She says she doesn't
run the fire department.

* Then he tries a parallel with the schools.  She says she has nothing to do
with the schools.

* So what does she do?  On Mondays there's a staff meeting.  Thursday she
signs all the checks...

Oh yeah, they also DO interview a member of the Independence Party, who lets
it all hang out vis-a-vis being anti-American.

Sarah Palin's main elected experience (4 years vs 2 as governor) is running
a backwater with malls and churches, that doesn't even have a fire
department.  Her husband was until recently a member of the Independence
Party, which is BY DEFINITION anti-American.  After she became mayor, the
local police (which she DID control) started charging rape victims for their
"rape kits" (for gathering evidence).  She opposes all sex education except
the "abstinence only" sort, and look what that's done to Alaska's teen
pregnancy rate and her own family.  Just yesterday, she answered the
question of a third grader, "What does the vice president do" and answered
that he/she is IN CHARGE of the Senate.  Unbelievable but true!
     http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/21/palin-vp-senate/

How can ANYONE vote for a ticket with this person on it!

The Daily Show thing is funny.   I also think this makes a nice counterpoint to Howard Stern's Harlem thing.

Plenty of stupidity to go around.

Not really. :)  (I feel the movie Idiocracy is a documentary on the 
future for example.)

I just wish a lot more of us in the world would turn off our T.V.s and 
go outside.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] deepSMOG and the void. I cannot lurk anymore.

I was just about to write this reply when I saw yours further down the
thread. The messages Deepfog sends to this list are sprinkled with a
crunchy collection of hate, fear, and insanity. When I skim that crap
(I can't help it, I sometimes even read my viagra spam) I occasionally
get caught by what I think is a salient point... only to realize its a
bunch of twisted-up spin doctor shit, piggy backing twenty pounds of
completely unrelated madnesses on the bent back of a valid
observation.

Homeboy is obviously out of line with his vitriol, but it seems like
the guy is genuinely pissed off after years of reading this stuff. I
get only a little annoyed, but that's because I assumed nobody but my
dumb ass is reading this shit. God forbid DF actually find an audience
for his propaganda.

  As many of you know I have personally objected to many of Deepfog's previ=

15% of the people are hopelessly stupid and uneducated.  They can't be saved.

Similarly 15% of the people are much smarter and knowledgeable than the rest.  They really do  know what's best.

The problem is that no one thinks they are in the first group and everyone thinks they are in the second.

So this is at the craneway which is an absolutely huge venue...   I'm
assuming you guys are pardoning it off so it won't feel so empty?  I'm
looking forward to checking this venue out.  I've stayed away from the
craneway, and have been waiting for a party that is geared towards a more
mature audience.   :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] deepSMOG and the void. I cannot lurk anymore.

Oh I wouldn't say there is no one that can stop me from posting to  
the list.  For one, we do have a moderator, and the list has been  
shut down before as well as people booted, though I think not too  
many people.

I'm working on an upgrade to my site right now which will thankfully  
take some of these posts away from the list, and where they belong,  
on my website, away from the underhanded snit, Peter the (Obamabot)  
Pin Popper, Bill Haagen-Daas, well I guess we know what he does for a  
living, and the "rational" hatter.  Oh.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha,  
hahahahahaha a-a-a.  I get it.  That's so original.  I hope you're  
not out trying to get a date with a name like that.  Oh come on  
everyone.  Laugh with me.  Ha. ha-ha.  Like this.  No, start over.

Ha.

Ha-ha.

ha-ha-ha.

a-a-a (you know, like in the end of Galaga).

from having hurt feelings!

All the men are drooling nerds. Doesn't that seem strange?

And of course in true punk fashion you know I won't actually post one of th=

Perfect Government by NOFX

Even if it's easy to be free

What's your definition of freedom?

And who the fuck are you=2C anyway?

Who the fuck are they?

Who the fuck am I to say?

What the fuck is really going on?

How did the cat get so fat?

Why does the family die?

Do you care why?

Cause there hasn't been a sign

Of anything gettin' better in the ghetto

People's fed up

But when they get up....

You point your fuckin' finger

You racist=2C you bigot

But that's not the problem

Now is it?

It's all about the money

Political power is takin'

Protecting the rich=2C denying the poor

Yeah=2C they love to watch the war from the White House

And I wonder...

How can they sleep at night?

How can they sleep at night?

How did the cat get so fat?

How did the cat get so fat?

How did the cat get so fat?

How did the cat get so fat?

I remember when this place was an abandoned dump!  I'm curious how they're

Superior, even if Ian McKaye is a gigantic faggot:

Seeing Red, Minor Threat:

You see me and you laugh out loud
You taunt me from safe inside your crowd
My looks, they must threaten you
To make you act the way you do

RED, I'M SEEING RED

You see me and you think I'm a jerk
First impressions without a word
You can't believe your eyes at first
But now you know you've seen the worst

RED, I'M SEEING RED

The guy is just an irritating loser with a condescending, wanna-be
philosopher style. Were he to write his own quotes of the day, which he is
too diminished to do, as FAS and a triplicate 21st DNA strand rack his
brain, I would probably be just as annoyed, but less offended. He simply
grabs what he thinks make him look smart, and copies and pastes.
Furthermore, I know of him from his days of hanging out with a school
teacher who has/had a penchant for young boys, which disgusts me as much as
deepSMOG himself. He's just a chump that cannot stop trying to be important
in a place that he, unbeknownst to him, is still un-important, nearly 15 yrs
down the road. You'd think even a 'tard would "get it" after so long. From
his past relationships, which I think he honors, the scary thing about him
is that he was groomed to take on the roll of his elder, and people like
that, I fear being around my 3 boys.

Your post is a tedious, homogenised, chameleon-esque scribble which 
amounts to nothing more than the demented cacophonous racket of a 
drugged lunatic banging loudly on kitchen pots and pans. Try learning 
elementary grammar before attempting to inflict your next literary 
abomination on this message board.

You read like a gimpzoid teenager splashing spit onto the monitor. Dont 
you ever have a point beyond giving your fingers some exercise by 
dancing them randomly over the keyboard? If ignorance were a disability, 
you'd get the full pension. Oh well, at least you only charge what your 
free advice is worth. As Abba Eban so aptly said: "His ignorance is 
encyclopedic."

What possessed you to think that you were capable of being entertaining 
or interesting to read? Why don't you close your mouth before someone 
sticks an apple in it? Maybe you wouldn't read like such a pathetic 
loser if you didn't eat all those paint chips and lead pencils when you 
were a kid; if the chief excitement in your meaningless life wasn't 
spotting people who are fatter than you are, or if your face wasn't so 
ugly that visitors to the Ugly Palace pay money NOT to see you. No, come 
to think of it, you would.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] deepSMOG and the void. I cannot lurk anymore.

lol. fight fight fight (cheering jeering crowd of onlookers). hey brett 
the reason why the post reply function automatically replies to sender 
is cause you won't have to air dirty laundry.

if you don't like deepfog's post's create your filter for him. although 
i do think that deepfog should reformat his subject lines with a capital 
NRR so that my filters would catch it rather than changing it around a 
bit every so often. that way i have my inbox folder with just NRRs. when 
i see there might be an interesting post in the NRR folder i might take 
a look at it. but its rare that i do.

blah blah blah can we get on the discussion of raves already? or is that 
not so important?

As many of you know I have personally objected to many of Deepfog's previous racist postings and fear mongering on this list.  IMO if Deepfog wants to keep posting racist (yes many of the people he quotes are racists and white nationalists) and other similar paranoid garbage here he shouldn't be surprised if people get irritated about it.  In fact, just my opinion, I think this *why* deepfog posts this stuff .  He wants to irritate people to get attention.  That's pretty normal for a five year old that doesn't know any better, but when an adult does it on "teh Internets" its called trolling and it is both annoying and offensive; in some cases it can be an indication of serious emotional difficulties.

I prefer verbal diarrhea.
Except I meant it. The intent was to copy the quazi-philosopher posts of
deepSMOG.

But that generator is pretty cool.

PS. I know about filters. I just hate my decision to switch to gmail and the
threaded, labels, crap it uses instead of folders, etc.

Subject: [sfraves] EXTRA EXTRA!!!! (saturday night take two)

--0-1067167763-1225062162=:70366
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

so it's saturday night and these really great acts are in town to play
and you're super excited so you get to the venue early and....

it's
the most retarded place you've ever been! there's no room and too many
hoochie mamas security won't let you in cause you got a baseball cap on
or god forbid you're wearing shorts...

you can't sit anywhere cause all the tables are reserved for bottle service.

there's lame ass go-go non dancers on the bar trying to figure out how to bump and grind to idm.

and to top it off, you can't actually hear the music cause the sound sucks!

complete waste of time thank you very much....

fortunately, everyone agrees with you and they all decide to do it over again. the right way. 

yup,
kids, the rumors are true. monday night at fat city pitch black will
perform at fat city. pascal has agreed to come in and tune the sound
system, and you know he does it proper. can it get any better than
that? of course it can!

IT'S FREE!!!!!!!

MONDAY OCT. 27
FAT CITY
11th @ Folsom

9-10 Little John
10-11:30 Pitch Black
11:30- ? Mimosa

i WILL see you on the dance floor! peace love and beats- pufuchu

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

Today's (nrr) Quote of the Day is brought to you by the Armchair  
Survivalist.  Don't go to that rave without having at least a 3  
million year supply of bacon at home!

http://dehydrated-food.net/bacon.html

How long would a case of this stuff last anyway?

I hear they are working on canned Jack in the Box chili fries to keep  
the likes of Chuck happy.

I wish everyone were like William Shatner.  We'd have better raves,
better music, and better pills.

OK, OK.

Watch.

Wallet.

Gun!

Right foot!

Left foot!

Hey, thank god for guns, 'ey Jerry?

Subject: [sfraves] WR: my birthday weekend :n)

So Friday, i reeeeeeeeeally wanted to go to the No On 8 shindig & well.. i
heard there was like alota performances & a speaker from the no on 8
office... but I mean..i didn't wanna like over do anything that would make
me hella tired on Saturday...

So like on Saturday, I did manage to get up early, LoL.. by evening time,
after this yummy ride on the N Judah with the guy who color coordinates
his clothes & this Nice old lady & the Hippy Geek who gave up his seat to
the old lady... and the mean girl who wouldn't shut the fuck up &
complained about eeeeeeeeeverything & her friend who stood in front of her
ignoring her... anywaze, yeah... i spent the eary part of the eveningin
Upper Haight @ this book store 'cause there was a reading & discussion
with the author of the book "Stuff White People Like", ummm, Christain
Lander I think his name is...

Good fuckin' shit, he is soooo inspirational & hella funny!!!  Also.. his
book, the book discussion, & just the whole dealie at the bookstore. I
mean... it totally just validates me telling a white person to stop acting
white >:)  LoL.. jokingly of course :) LoL! But yeah, it got kinda
annoying afterwards when i was in line to get his signing thingie (& I had
to use the flyer 'cause I couldn't buy a book), like all everyone wwho was
around me had like their normal conversations, but would add "that's
something that white people like too"... LoL, yeah

So I bussed it down Lower Haight & went to UGSF & Wow.. it was soo much
fun!!  Like I mean... it wasn't packed house like I was hoping 'cause
hella people who said they were gonna be there weren't... but I mean..
it's all good :)  I mean.. I just hope that they're all alright and stuff
:)

But yeah.. it was a Raga Jungle night... the only DJ that didn't spin Raga
was Eskae & he dropped like alot ummm... like dubby kinda stuff, some
liquid, & alota atmo!  I tried dancing as much as possible.. but like with
raga, it's kinda hard.. but it was still fun :)  Yeah man.. & the energy
of the crowd that night was Awesome!!!  I mean

I didn't get too wasted, like i got really buzzed at 1 point & that was
it!!  BUt yeah.. so many yummy people showed & it was a fuckin' Groovy ass
time!!!  To people on the list who made it, Thank U Millions 4 sharing
that Groovy fuckin' night with me!!!  Oh My Goodness.. even Chazz Fuckin'
Gold showed up & gave me a yummy present.

Oooh... yeah.. afterwards I kinda ended up at Ray & Nico's pad & like
chilled there for a long while playing with my wallet chain, chillin' with
Ray, watching the whole 1st season of Futurama, & chatting with Homies in
the chat rooms... I got to hang out with Nico for like 1/2 hour, then got
home at some point on Sunday.. Hello 2day!!

Yeah... it was a good yummy Birthday!!!  Thanks again everyone for the
Groovy wishes & calls & stuff!!

I'm not sure if I entirely agree with this point of view but what the  
heck, it's certainly one to think about and/or discuss, though not  
necessarily here.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - Tonal: Grinch Green - Saturday 12/13/08!

Rock It Science & Prismatic present:

Tonal: Grinch Green

Saturday, December 13th

---

Every dancer down in Tonal-ville
Liked undergrounds a lot...
But the Grinch, who lived just north of Tonal-ville
Did NOT!  

The Grinch hated undergrounds!
The whole underground season!
Now, please don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

It could be his head
Wasn't screwed on just right.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes
Were too tight.

But I think that the most likely
Reason of all
May have been that his heart
Was two sizes too small.

He hated the NOISE!
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!

The dancers, young and old, 
Would get down to the beat.
Pop, slide and groove to the BEAT!
BEAT! BEAT! BEAT!

They would dance to Tonal DJs
In fresh venues for the season
Which was something the Grinch
Couldn't stand for no reason! 

But one day the Grinch 
Snuck into Tonal through the back door
And felt the bass of dance music
Rising up through the floor

"That's a noise," grinned the Grinch
"That I simply MUST hear!"
So he paused.
And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.

And he did hear a sound
Consuming the place.
A beat resonating
All over the space. 

But the sound wasn't sad!
Why, this sound sounded merry!
It couldn't be so!
But it WAS merry! VERY! 

He stared down at Tonal-ville!
The Grinch popped his eyes!
Then he shook!
What he saw was a shocking surprise! 

Every dancer down in Tonal-ville
The tall and the small
Was getting down in unison!
The love of music was filling them all! 

And what happened then...?
Well...in Tonal-ville they say
That the Grinch
Got down to house music that day! 

---

Full lineup to be announced soon!

Rock It Science & Prismatic present:

Tonal: Grinch Green

Saturday, December 13th

---

Every dancer down in Tonal-ville
Liked undergrounds a lot...
But the Grinch, who lived just north of Tonal-ville
Did NOT!  

The Grinch hated undergrounds!
The whole underground season!
Now, please don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

It could be his head
Wasn't screwed on just right.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes
Were too tight.

But I think that the most likely
Reason of all
May have been that his heart
Was two sizes too small.

He hated the NOISE!
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!

The dancers, young and old, 
Would get down to the beat.
Pop, slide and groove to the BEAT!
BEAT! BEAT! BEAT!

They would dance to Tonal DJs
In fresh venues for the season
Which was something the Grinch
Couldn't stand for no reason! 

But one day the Grinch 
Snuck into Tonal through the back door
And felt the bass of dance music
Rising up through the floor

"That's a noise," grinned the Grinch
"That I simply MUST hear!"
So he paused.
And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.

And he did hear a sound
Consuming the place.
A beat resonating
All over the space. 

But the sound wasn't sad!
Why, this sound sounded merry!
It couldn't be so!
But it WAS merry! VERY! 

He stared down at Tonal-ville!
The Grinch popped his eyes!
Then he shook!
What he saw was a shocking surprise! 

Every dancer down in Tonal-ville
The tall and the small
Was getting down in unison!
The love of music was filling them all! 

And what happened then...?
Well...in Tonal-ville they say
That the Grinch
Got down to house music that day! 

---

Full lineup to be announced soon!

I am Grey Mist, Deepfog's arch enemy.

Say nothing!  For we must act with stealth and precision if we are to  
get rid of this menace known as Deepfog.  Think of all the people he  
has told to f-off in the rave scene over the years.  Who does he think  
he is?  House music?  No one listens to that garbage anymore!  Once we  
arrange a convenient 'accident' for Deepfog and he is out of the way,  
I will throw out all his records and buy what I want .. speed garage!

And the perfect opportunity may be coming this week when he goes down  
to the park to see the butterflies.  He will never see me coming!  So  
hope for the best.

Ok - so maybbe Tool aren't exactly punk=2C but their 1st album certainly ha=
s that vibe and energy=2C and it was produced by one of the former members =
of Minor Threat=2C so...deal.

"Jerk Off" by TOOL

Someone told me once
that there's a right and wrong=2C
and that punishment
would come to those
who dare to cross the line.
   =20
But it must not be true

     for jerk-offs like you.

     Maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole.

     but I'm tired of waiting.

     Maybe it's just bullshit and I should play GOD=2C

     and shoot you myself.

     Because I'm tired of waiting.
   =20
Consequences dictate

     our course of action

     and it doesn't matter what's right.

     It's only wrong if you get caught.

     If consequences dictate

     my course of action

     I should play GOD

     and shoot you myself.

     I'm very tired of waiting.
   =20
I should

     kick you=2C

     beat you=2C

     fuck you=2C

     and then shoot - you - in - your - fucking head!!!

   =20

Whatever man, Tool is a great band. Also, the first time I was ever in a
mosh pit was at a Tool show. It was during my candy raving days, too, so I
was all decked out in giant pants, a visor and candy. Good fuckin times.

Saw this cat at the DEMF this year and he rocked the
shit out of the place. Everywhere he goes he leaves the
place sweaty and makes tons of new converts. Check
out the mixes below and then imagine it pumped up
even further for a raging dancefloor.

Great modern techno. Highly recommended.

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from Barcelona, Spain:

PACO OSUNA  - 3 hour DJ set

(plus 8 . zenit . mindshake . m_nus . ovum)

In the last several years, Paco Osuna has made a
steady ascent from "Paco who?" to one of the most
in-demand headliners on the international scene.
Starting his DJ career in the mid 90's, his mastery
behind 3 decks and unconventional sense of groove
soon landed him a  residency at Ibiza's famed
Amnesia club, where he continued to hone his craft
alongside Sven Vath and other elite DJs. His
famously intense sets, which fuse the best of
techno and house in a dramatic ride of tension-
building and release, have won him prime slots at
most major international clubs and music festivals
including Sonar, Love Parade, WMC, and the DEMF,
to name just a few. If you're a fan of peak hour
"hard minimal" a la Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola,
and Adam Beyer, Paco's 3 hour SF debut is
something you definitely don't want to miss!


with [KONTROL] residents:

CRAIG KUNA  (platform . esdjco)

ALLAND BYALLO  (nightlight . auralism . leibe*detail)

NIKOLA BAYTALA  (s.w.a.t. . robsoul . junior boys own)

PACO OSUNA (aka Osuna, Smoke Paper Inc.)

Paco Osuna Perez was born in Barcelona in 1974, and his passion for music
started out when he was very young. At the tender age of 14 he was part of =
a
regular crowd at Studio 54, where the most charismatic DJ, Raul Orellana,
was spinning Acid House, marking Paco in the way of understanding DJing. In
'94 Paco moved to Valencia where he had his first contact with the decks as
a hobby. In '95 Paco made his first DJ set as a professional at the ACTV
club, where he gained a year residency. After that, he started playing in
many different clubs including Heaven and Universal.

In the meanwhile he worked in a record shop, where he got access to a
recording studio in which he produced three singles for the label Lucas
Records. In '99 he got a residency at Amnesia in Ibiza. There he had the
brilliant opportunity to be lined up with the biggest DJs and could learn
the different styles, looking to build his own. Amnesia was also the place
where Paco got in touch with the person who most influenced his future as
much personally as professionally, Sven V=E4th, who soon discovered Paco to=
 be
very talented and introduced him in his Cocoon Booking agency. Paco was the
first Spanish DJ to play for this prestigious agency.

In 2001 Paco decided to migrate away from House music, moving closer to
Techno. From then on his career has gotten better and better, leading him t=
o
the best clubs and festivals in the world. Being at home in both House and
Techno, as well as in the fusion between them, Paco Osuna understands his
sets as an "in-crescendo"-journey causing variations of tension that drive
the dancefloor crazy. The combination of this factor and his unquestionable
technical skills has led to Paco being considered one of the most solid
promises of the international scene.

Subject: [sfraves] Ghost Ship???

Anyone know what's up with "Ghost Ship"?

I just got an email about this party.  It's supposedly the night after  
halloween; which is good, because I'm taking my CCNA class every  
saturday morning for the rest of this semester, so going out on the  
31st itself is out this time around.  It's also supposedly within  
walking distance of my house... a rarity, but a plus.  And I've no  
inclination to cart myself out to richmond (ugh) for Skills this time  
around (Last time I went to a party out thataways, the locals broke  
into better than half the cars, and a couple of people I know got  
mugged.).  So I'm considering it.

But the guy who emailed me isn't always the most up to speed on  
upcoming parties; I don't see a BSP in my SFRaves folder; nor do I see  
mention of it on Bayraves.  I've never heard of the crew before and  
aside from Aaron Jae and Bam, the advertised DJ lineup is mostly  
unfamiliar too... but hey... I can WALK there and home!

So I figured I'd ask here first in case it was the sort of party that  
shouldn't be known about on bayraves.  (But being in an airplane  
hangar would seem to indicate it's at least a mini-massive and right  
up BR's alley.)  Anyone know anything useful?

Good?  Bad?  So-so?
Go?  Stay away?  Take a chance?
Ask on Bayraves?

Thanks!


cya,
john

the crew is solid.  i will possibly be there as it's my
birthday weekend - the only reason i will miss it is if i am
too drunk to stand up, due to the 666 party beforehand.  which
is a definite possibility.

but it will be a fun time for sure.

Whatever - it's his opinion!  He does wear a cool hat, tho.

IMHO, I think producing is way more difficult than DJing, and

I agree with that too - however - when you make your income (or at least a =
decent portion of it) off of DJ's=2C and you turn around and say they all s=

"Promises" by Fugazi

Words

Words and expressions

All these confessions

Of where we stand

How I see you

And you see me

Dedications of symmetry

Together we will be

forever.

Promises are shit

We speak the way we breathe

Present air will have to do

Rearrange and see it through

Stupid fucking words

They tangle us in our desires

Free me from this give and take

Free me from this great debate

There were no truer words than when spoken

Let that stand as it should

There was nothing left when broken

We grab anything when we fall

Promises are shit

We speak the way we breathe

Present air will have to do

Rearrange and see us through

Stupid fucking words

They tangle us in our desires

Free me from this give and take

Free me from this great debate

You will do what you do

I will do what I do

We will do what we do

Rearrange and see it through

Go where you think you want to go

Do everything you were sent here for

Fire at will if you hear that call

Touch your hand to the wall at night

Promises.

Words.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TOTALLY RR! Check this shit out...

he's saying what i've been feeling about djing actually. djing is kind 
of pointless when you can get several thousand bucks a night touring as 
a live performer. i think djing served its merit when it was harder to 
carry your ELO style keyboard setup on the plane with you, but now that 
laptops serve as the main function for playing live.. (hell even i 
phones let you play live) and dj's play on laptops.. what's the 
difference? djs should contribute and make their own and be original. 
i've always found that djing's greatest trick was to be able to make 
music with two different tracks, to create an original sound. but 
essentially you have a greater power to do that on your own now at this 
point in history.

i will concede that djing is alot like curation and performing a set of 
tracks is like giving a gallery walk through; also deadmaus is wrong to 
have dissed every one on beatport from where he got his fame, but i do 
say he's got a valid point.

hypothetically, the problem i see with the change over to a purely a 
producer based genre, is the sheer amount of crap that will immediately 
fill the international market. beatport is a good example of this. but 
the solution to it would be to deal more with local artists and develop 
the local sound. from there the cream will rise to the top and those 
producers will travel as representatives of the SF electronic music 
sound. more peopleand djs will just collect tracks for their multi 
terabyte hard drives and more people will be fans of just the music 
rather than the awkward social climbing that goes along with DJing. only 
the truly talentled people will be allowed to survive as performers in 
the electronic music world. the rest will go onto free sites like what 
deviant art has become for artists.. just trying to get noticed. paying 
for music is already becoming obsolete.

short synopsus of how we got here loose chronological order:

    * how to dj books and videos flooded the market.
    * young kids realise its easy to be just like their trance hero.
      turntables outsell guitars (though food for thought here it takes
      2 turntable to become a tiesto dj, one guitar to become eddie van
      halen). the mystique of DJing is rendered obsolete.
    * digital music becomes cheap and easy to get making people wonder
      is it worth it to get a whitelabel.
    * laptop producing becomes a big thing
    * wiht the advent of a truly powerful pioneer cd player john digweed
      declares he will only play on cds
    * richie hawtin throws the djing world into complete confusion with
      final scratch
    * other companies rush to follow suit causing more confusion as well
      as a 15-20 minutes looking at a dj's dumpy ass setting up serato
      final scratch etc.
    * ableton live blurs the line between performing live and djing
    * richie hawtin again tries to justify the way he thinks about djing
      by pushing traktor which is essentially remixing and making music
      on the fly
    * deadmaus declares djing dead.
    * sean said told you so 2 years ago. i'm probably not the only one.

mike pickering was right way back when  he said you don't need bands to 
play live to make people dance.. but when the dj has become the band, 
then what? no dj.

deadmaus' hat is off the hook though. nice use of taplights as eyes.


respect.
sean.

the streets are paved in Hershey's chocolate and the houses are also =20

In other news, there have been a lot of those weather modification =20

the strangest weather I've ever seen, it was a thin layer of these =20
strange clouds, and above that was your typical criss-cross pattern =20
from all the planes that spew out something, I don't know what it is =20
exactly, but I've heard it's a mixture of barium salts and heavy metals.

The lady from California Sky Watch, I think that's .org but not sure, =20
you can search it, lives probably near Redding area and has uncovered =20
in her research that private companies are allowed to use planes to =20

When all is said and done, I like to go out and dance.Now, the question is,
who will be entertaining and make me happy?
The technology is not important. New, or same old, shit, not really
important.
Fun is important.

(And that mousehead IS a great thing, please don't beer the art. What's this
about calling someone an asshole by being a bigger asshole, anyway? Violence
is a low place to live ones' life from.)

Rilly, who cares? If you're going to see music that you love you should jus=
t
love the music and not try and pontificate about which particular format is
best.

Music is music is music is music, shouldn't matter how it's played long as
it's bass heavy, bangin, and it makes you move your ass.

Seen?

 SPACE COWBOYS are??????

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TOTALLY RR! Check this shit out...

i agree that the music is the most important.. but point being, the way 
it is presented will be changing drastically in the next couple of 
years, and it would be best to advance your local scene artistically by 
being an originator in your own scene, rather than an ambassador of 
electronic music for another scene. that's my point.

if i'd only said that sooner. `;)

i'm really really looking forward to all the fun parties going down this
weekend! usually i'd pick one or two but there are just too many so i'm
gonna go where the wind blows me - space cowboys sounds awesome but travel
logistics are tough to predict, and then there is the gathering, and
kontrol. i'm tryin' to sort out how to move on friday, possibly go out
dancin' that night, then muster up the energy for some brass tax shenanigan=
s
on saturday morning and also make it out for a killer saturday night. but,
i'll be there with bacon on!!!

rave on,

yes i know, it's everyone's
favorite holiday of the year. candy (yummy yummy candy) and costumes
and thwompy bass and you'd think that i'd be so excited about this
weekend i could hardly contain myself but there's this tunnel and the
light at the end of it is flickering and not so bright...

oh i
don't know what to do! i mean, i know what i'm doing this weekend and
i'm sure most of you have decided too... that's not the problem... i
just can't focus on what's directly ahead of me my mind keeps fast
forwarding to tuesday,=A0 quite possibly the most important day of any of
our lives so let me get this out of the way before i highlight a couple
of the many many events going on this weekend...

GO VOTE!!! if
you haven't already, and i know many of you have. yes i know many of
you don't believe it makes much difference if there's a democrat or a
republican in the white house but the symbolic importance of this
election trumps any concerns we might have about the realistic
possibility of change in government. swallow whatever third party
loving government needs to be destroyed what are they ever going to do
in DC that realistically helps the world ideology you subscribe to and GO V=
OTE!!!!

(and then come to mighty tuesday night for End Of an Error and dance and dr=
ink and hold your breath...)=20

okay, i feel a little better, having gotten that out of the way.=20

so if you still have energy after the brass tax 6:66 renegade there are
a couple good parties saturday night... and then a moment of rest
before the entire nation awaits with baited breath the sure sign that
this country is headed in the right direction... i thought weekends
that started on wednesday were bad but you know none of us are doing
anything until we know the outcome of the election!!! 


SATURDAY NOV 1st


many of us were disappointed when the symbiosis crew didn't come
through with their amazing campout this year, but they are quickly
making up for it with a series of amazing events! tonight they take
over the beautiful kelly's mission rock...

DAY OF THE DEAD
Kelly's Mission Rock

and
what epic weekend would be complete without a blowout from the space
cowboys? there's too much info so i'm just gonna give you the basics...
all your favorite sf ug djs, a bunch of art cars, there's a biodiesel
shuttle and god knows how long it will go for... 

GHOST SHIP

ok
so now that we got the weekend out of the way... it's time to look
towards the future. if you haven't already, tuesday november 4th you
should go vote. i know many
have noticed that i'm a little distracted today... it's because all i
can think about is tuesday. and it's not just because i'm hosting an
awesome election night party at mighty and hope that you all come drink
and dance with me as we await the election results... it's because for
the first time in a long time politics is front and center in my mind,
supplanting that part of me that loves only throbbing bass and beats. i
know, amazing, possibly apocalyptic, for sure mind blowing, but true.
so GO VOTE ALREADY!!! and then come to mighty. at least we can celebrate



we'll
be broadcasting election coverage all night, the bus will be chillin
outside with the Ambient Mafia and some old and new favorites throwin
down ill beats inside! 

MIGHTY
119 Utah @ 15th

peace love and beats- pufuchu

I really have no idea how I somehow totally missed knowing about  
them.  I mean... I know I don't get out nearly so much as I used to...  
nor am I as clued in to UGs and renegades as I used to be.  But  
somehow I never actually noticed this crew.

Which really IS pretty ridiculous if they're in the habit of throwing  
aircraft-hanger-sized mini-massives and I've STILL cruised through  
without noticing them,  I really have no excuse for that one.

And just who DO you have to schmooze with to get to throw a rave in  
those hangers anyway?  I've heard from other promoters, in the past,  
who wanted to do so, but said it's well-nigh impossible.


cya,
john

when it comes to bay area parties i'm a newbie so ug = cracktory (fuckin miss that place!) the best being when we got the mog inside there after love parade a couple years ago and burning man being the epitome of all that is good in sf? (minus the feather hats and leather and attitude and yeah..) but the unimog was one of the first beauties of its kind that i did meet, now i know disorient and the purgatory cruiser and the neuroweapon and the nexxus mobile and then the unimog has martha and the nexxus mobile has the frito lay truck and oh how do i LOVE my mobile sound systems!!! but i can see how you wouldn't really associate the cowboys with ugs and definitely not raves as i imagine they were born from the barren dust...

but it seems that it's a distinct possibility that those spots on the island might open up to more events.. though i must say the younger crowd has ruined more that one spot for us geriatrics...

so bigger and better yes please!!! (rave at NASA anyone? helped with both so far) but please with respect and love and remember to clean up after yourselves (mexicans will do it for cheap. no i'm serious.)

but most importantly... quiet in and quiet out and control your parking areas and seruously?? RAVE ON!!!!

We'll be at the Otherworld Halloween party tonight. 

And where will you be?

Otherworld for me too!  Sadly, I will not be in costume. :(

Going to be interesting, got some short term work on the election machines,
need to go take a drug test today before the party so I can work on election
day... what are THEY on to schedule the test before halloween for work
after? :)  Anyway, if I make it, Kontrol tomorrow night, and likely
sleep on sunday for having a gasp of work.

last year I made a geisha costume and wore that to work, no budget this year
and that costume fell apart(plus it's in Hayward and I'm in SF).  There are
some pics around somewhere of the HR guy slapping my ass. :)

I might try my clothes on backwards but my jeans may not fit that way and a
T shirt backwards just looks... like I was half alseep when I dressed. :P

Come on over and we'll dress you up.  In SF out in the Sunset.

I have a few past years costumes including a pirate outfit, skeleton wizard and full gorilla suit.

Let me know...

last year I made a geisha costume and wore that to work, no budget this year
and that costume fell apart(plus it's in Hayward and I'm in SF).  There are
some pics around somewhere of the HR guy slapping my ass. :)

I might try my clothes on backwards but my jeans may not fit that way and a
T shirt backwards just looks... like I was half alseep when I dressed. :P

We're going to see if we can bring the flamewars from sfraves

Hey y'all.

Just want to take a second to really give a heartfelt recommendation about
this Paco Osuna character. For those of you who follow new techno closely,
there's no doubt you've either seen or heard about Paco by now. For the res=
t
of you who this may be a somewhat new name to, let me tell you, this guy is
pretty amazing. I first saw him in person at this years DEMF, where he
played a prime slot in the Beatport tent alongside his M-nus cohorts
including Richie Hawtin, Magda, Heartthrob and Konrad Black.

HO. LEE. CRAP. He looked like the Ice Man up there, but I'll be damned if h=
e
didn't have the place going absolutely apeshit! In addition to his amazing
technical abilities, Paco's got a real talent for manipulating the energy
and tension in the room in a way that just makes the dancefloor explode int=
o
a bunch of jumping, screaming, techno-loving freaks.
Sounds kinda like us, huh? :)

Anyway, there seems to be a lot going on tomorrow night, but I assure you
that making it down to the Endup will be considered a wise move on your par=
t
come Sunday morning. If you don't make it, at least prepare yourself for al=
l
those "OMG, Paco Osuna was soooo sick! I can't believe you missed it!"
conversations down the road.
;)

Hope to see lots of friendly faces and dancing machines tomorrow. It's
definitely gonna be another one of those "I was there" nights.

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from Barcelona, Spain:

PACO OSUNA  - 3 hour DJ set

(plus 8 . zenit . mindshake . m_nus . ovum)

In the last several years, Paco Osuna has made a
steady ascent from "Paco who?" to one of the most
in-demand headliners on the international scene.
Starting his DJ career in the mid 90's, his mastery
behind 3 decks and unconventional sense of groove
soon landed him a  residency at Ibiza's famed
Amnesia club, where he continued to hone his craft
alongside Sven Vath and other elite DJs. His
famously intense sets, which fuse the best of
techno and house in a dramatic ride of tension-
building and release, have won him prime slots at
most major international clubs and music festivals
including Sonar, Love Parade, WMC, and the DEMF,
to name just a few. If you're a fan of peak hour
"hard minimal" a la Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola,
and Adam Beyer, Paco's 3 hour SF debut is
something you definitely don't want to miss!


with [KONTROL] residents:

CRAIG KUNA  (platform . esdjco)

ALLAND BYALLO  (nightlight . auralism . leibe*detail)

NIKOLA BAYTALA  (s.w.a.t. . robsoul . junior boys own)

PACO OSUNA (aka Osuna, Smoke Paper Inc.)

Paco Osuna Perez was born in Barcelona in 1974, and his passion for music
started out when he was very young. At the tender age of 14 he was part of =
a
regular crowd at Studio 54, where the most charismatic DJ, Raul Orellana,
was spinning Acid House, marking Paco in the way of understanding DJing.

In '94 Paco moved to Valencia where he had his first contact with the decks
as a hobby. In '95 Paco made his first DJ set as a professional at the ACTV
club, where he gained a year residency. After that, he started playing in
many different clubs including Heaven and Universal.

In the meanwhile he worked in a record shop, where he got access to a
recording studio in which he produced three singles for the label Lucas
Records. In '99 he got a residency at Amnesia in Ibiza. There he had the
brilliant opportunity to be lined up with the biggest DJs and could learn
the different styles, looking to build his own. Amnesia was also the place
where Paco got in touch with the person who most influenced his future as
much personally as professionally, Sven V=E4th, who soon discovered Paco to=
 be
very talented and introduced him in his Cocoon Booking agency. Paco was the
first Spanish DJ to play for this prestigious agency.

In 2001 Paco decided to migrate away from House music, moving closer to
Techno. From then on his career has gotten better and better, leading him t=
o
the best clubs and festivals in the world. Being at home in both House and
Techno, as well as in the fusion between them, Paco Osuna understands his
sets as an "in-crescendo"-journey causing variations of tension that drive
the dancefloor crazy. The combination of this factor and his unquestionable
technical skills has led to Paco being considered one of the most solid
promises of the international scene.
