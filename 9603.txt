... some of us in 1991 dragged a sound system to the parking lot of a
'Dead' show, with Garth, Jeno and myself playing at the Shoreline
Amphitheatre.  We did it sensing a kinship with the lifestyle, beliefs and
philosophical trips of the nomadic 'heads'.  We felt the same somehow, only
the music 'seemed' different.  Those without tickets eventually wandered
towards the group of people who caravaned with us that lovely spring
morning.  They gathered slowly,  Curious about the generator, the speakers,
a van with two turntables and some guy playing records, they watched
approvingly.  Noticing  the smiling faces, and the freestyle abandon of the
dancers, they too joined the swelling circle of people that gathered in
that part of the lot, granted to us by the establishment themselves after
seeing the number of ticket-less people who now didn't mind not having a
ticket, as long as they can continue to have a good time.  I remember  two
travellers who couldn't get in to the show asked, "what kind of music is
this?".  "It sounds kind of like disco, but trippy, hypnotic".  I'm certain
they were familiar with the swirling, percussive, psychedelic elements of
the music, not just that some of us were dressed in the same loose-fitting,
comfortable clothing, that some of us braid our hair, that we seemed to
enjoy the same universal tenets and leisurely recreations (cloud #420) or
any of the stereo- typical trademarks that "deadheads" or "hippies" are
supposed to have... no waaay maaan... we are diverse.  Just seems
different, really all the same. Know what I mean?  I remember when I played
again, looking up and seeing the same two who thought the music to be
disco, now themselves dancing in abandon, along with several hundred
others, happy, dancing on top of vans and cars. The moment was so NOW it
remains timelessly clear.  There was a vision then, it exists even now,
especially with Jerry's passing.  No longer an unbroken string of
generations to enjoy the festive atmosphere that accompanied traveling with
the 'dead'.  A lifestyle that seems to fulfill a nomadic need by even our
generation.  The need to travel and "see how the other half lives", making
more local our perception of this global village.  Think global, act local,
right?  Know global more local and we'll all care more about this world as
a whole.  The first "Full Moon" party at Baker Beach that fog-cold winter
evening in 1991, and what it became, is testament to the almost genetic
need to be free, to explore and congregate, to be outdoors, beyond the
confines of a wall-lined club or room.  Beyond the restrictions,
expectations and local leases on our lives.  The spirited feeling of "the
sounds in the air", swirling, "will make you move and move"... and change
your life, forever.  In England, circa 1987, Raves (for lack of a better
word) as we know, started with names like "Sunrise" and "Energy", growing
larger and moving outdoors, drawing the attention of "crusties" and
"travellers", who were accustomed to the great outdoors of the festival
circuit and accustomed to ancient beliefs, modern simplicities, and a
slight aversion to soap, they began mixing in with these technomadic,
body-jacking, week-end long enthusiasts of this strange, repetitive,
bass-blistering, percussion-driven sound that they were calling "acid
house". The cry was:
Birth
School
Acid House
Death
and a generation was born.  Countless lives were changed, for the better.
Ethics and beliefs were revived from the ashes of the sixties.  Tuned in,
and turning on there computers and most definately not dropping out.  The
same possibility exists for America.  All those that enjoy this music seem
to enjoy it as much, if not more freely, in the great outdoors.  I see the
future of ravers and deadheads, as being the same.  Festivals like the
"Country Fair" in Oregon on Ken Kesey's land every year in July, is the
sort of festive atmosphere a lot of different people can enjoy.  Truly a
Tribal Gathering.  Autonomous Zones that are not only temporary, but
transient as well.
As I sit here, solid plans are being made for large outdoor festivals,
sponsored by people who understand, and feel the collective potential in
this new breed.  NO SELL OUT.  A paradigm shift of tremendous magnitude is
to occur, and we should play a major part in it.  Maybe we can't save the
world by ourselves, but we can certainly save ourselves.  The music and the
experience is a pathway to a comfort zone of understanding.  One of many
paths... one that we enjoy.

Thinking good thoughts and making moments count...

I thought I de-lurk and introduce myself to all you wonderful souls on this
subject, as it's near and dear to my heart and my recent introduction into
raving.

My intro to the Dead was in college, but when I landed in Berkeley
afterwards 7 years ago I didn't quite appreciate what I would get myself
into.  When I first combined mushrooms with a show and met the "group mind"
on 12/31/89 a gradual journey begun that led me to more shows (the majority
not psychedelic, just filled w/cannibliss; my only pre-rave e experience
was at a show) and the awareness of different possibilities of
consciousness and living.

Cutting to the chase, despite my ripeness for the rave experience,
including musical aspects, and Ethan's Oakland Coliseum parking lot
blowouts, i was never exposed until the Dec. '95 Chrysalis.  I really had
no idea what I was getting into, just that my friend Carin thought I'd like
it.  Needless to say, I was blown away, by the energy in the people, the
music, the lighting, the vibe.

The Dec. 9 Chrysalis was "coincidentally" the day after the Dead officially
called it quits, which was pretty much inevitable after Jerry's death in
August.  But there had been rumors of new band members and maybe a summer
tour just before the announcement, so it was a little surprise it happened
when it did.
I recognized the parallel universes between the scenes immediately.  As one
door closes, another opens. Serendipity was a hallmark of my Deadhead
existence, and it's obviously there for me with raves as well.  (BTW, loved
Dave SCruton's list of similarities between deadheads and ravers;
unfortunately, they also both share police harrassment, public
misconceptions, long bathroom lines, getting each other sick, lack of
venues -- but it's worth these hassles).

The rave scene is one manifestation of what Deadheads often liked to say --
take the show with you wherever you go, and understand that you were part
of the show too.  Hopefully, the fact that rave music and the scene
couldn't be as ultimately dependent on one person as the Dead scene was
will keep raves evolving permanently.

Peace,

leftjab (Jonathan)

See ya all on Saturday. . .

Thought I would add some personal views to the topics at hand. I too was
involved in the dead scene and am presently involved in the party thang and
unfortunately perplexed by our materialistic society. Both scenes pulled in
what I consider the possitive (spiritual) forces of our culture. Caring,
sharing, trusting, loving, laughing and dancing are the human desires that
created the force in both scenes. These desires got the ball rolln in both
scenes. The dead (or wicked or the gathering or FnF......) worked hard to
create a forum to share their desires. The forum was the dead show or the
party. People became attracted to these possitive forces and the scene grew
and grew and grew.....

Some people have different desires. Both scenes have also attracted what I
consider negative (material) forces of our culture.  Greed, wealth,
intolerance, hatred, anger and oppression are human desires that have evolved
 in both scenes.

The universe is ruled by opposite forces. Magnets have two poles. We cannot
have happy people without having angry people to measure them by. Wealth can
only be assessed by examining poverty..............

Both scenes have blossomed, out of what I consider possitive forces. These
forces are what attracted me. I evolved out of the dead scene when the band's
desires changed from what I considered possitive. The desire had changed from
having a good time to keeping the economic ball rolling. The negative forces
ironically overtook the scene? They were not enjoying what they were doing
and it showed in their stage performance. I will continue to support the
scenes that blossom out of my possitive desires. The party scene is still
blossoming. The present party scene has alot to learn from the dead scene. It
took the dead over 30 years to grow! I hope to be on the beach dancing under
the full moon for many years to come!! PEACE!!!  CID

I've been a Deadhead and a raver for a long time.  My interest in the
Dead started in the mid-1970s but I didn't go to many shows until 1984.
It has been a major formative experience, so many stories!  After 1990
things started sliding pretty severely in the scene, and after 1992
Jerry Garcia just seemed to lose interest somewhat and the shows, while
still enjoyable, lost the magical edge for me anyway.  But I'm not about
to cast any major judgements on it; my biggest impression from the time
right after Garcia's death last August was how the old-timers like me
were just marginal in the scene by that point.  The band gave immense
enjoyment and some wisdom to many people -- that's tribute enough.

In the meantime, in the early 1990s I came out of my long musical
hibernation and returned to my roots in soul and funk when I dived into
the house/techno/rave scene.  I expect to be immersed in the electronic
dance music/future jazz milieu for at least as long as I was actively
involved in the Dead scene!

One of my most memorable nights, and it was perhaps a crossover of sorts
for me, was when I went to see the Dead play Cal Expo in Sacramento one
night in May 1992.  Right after the show I caught a ride back to SF and
went to my first event at 177 Townsend, a place which is little known
in our current scene but played a pivotal role in the development of the
SF rave community.  Had a great time at both events that night!

Where did I leave off?  Oh yeah . . .

Sunday was a work day . . . Monday too, I got up early and went down to
Santa Clara where I checked out an upcoming network installation job.
What a hoot, Portland raver does network consulting in Silicon Valley :)

Finally, back Monday evening for MAD at the Bahia on Market St.  I had
really been looking forward to this, as it was basically my public debut
playing techno (which I've been spinning somewhat all along, and more
intently for the last six months).  MAD has turned into a very nice
event, not too crowded this night but plenty of people and a relaxed
atmosphere.  Also, the musical range seems a bit wider than before,
based on what I heard Joe Rice and Jon Santos playing, which is a very
good sign.  I liked my set pretty well, it was a bit sloppy at the
start but I began with Claude Young's excellent junglistic reworking
of Jacob's Optical Stairway and then played the classic gospel-influenced
Detroit house track, "The Question," one of Terrence Parker's best efforts,
in honor of Ken Collier, the unheralded mentor of the Detroit underground
music scene.  Ken was a house DJ who ran clubs and did radio shows for
years in Detroit until he passed away last week.  Those of us who had
the honor of meeting him and hearing him play grasped some of the real
roots of this scene, those like Ken who helped set the stage for the
really good parts, the great music and PLUR.  He encouraged the many
new DJs and recording artists in Detroit over the last two decades and
I can't say enough for how that kind of support, as low key as it  may
be, is crucial to the development of a real musical scene.  

>From there I went on to play a bunch more housey techno, even managed
to slip in a Jeff Mills track while nobody was looking (!) and closed
up with the grand old Havana "Skyhat", a great house/techno crossover
track from the ancient days of 1993.  I have to say I started slow
and sloppy and never really hit the groove, but it was a blast and I
want to thank the MAD crew -- Joe Rice, Ethan, Jon, Dave, the Gateway
crew and anyone else I'm neglecting -- for inviting me to play.  It
made my month!

Now I'm back in Portland and getting ready to participate in a bunch of
small parties here at home.  I'm optimistic that if we go back to the
roots here for a while we can emerge with a new direction for this
crazy and wonderful thing, just as has happened in SF and elsewhere . . .

peace

As Malcolm X said, "The price of freedom?  The price of freedom is death."
People will reveal their true colors as Buke (rhymes with Duke) gets closer
to being nominated.  I hope he dredges up as many fears as possible, and
allow all of the scum who have HIS ideas rise to the top.  As Farrakhan
said, "We're long overdue for a showdown anyway!", and I agree.

People in this country are complacent, and rather racist overall.  Everyone
is in their seperate camps anyway, which would make it seem as though the
supremacist ideals Buke aspouses would cause great damage.  I tend to think
it will unite a wide group of people from all corners.

Yes, it will be the start of a bloody, and deadly revolution second only to
our civil war, and I welcome it.  Face it, there is NO ROOM for racist
ideas in a multi-cultural society.  Spout that first amendment nonsense all
one wishes, there just isn't room for those ideas in our society, period.
So i'm down for the fight against the right.  Since many of them aren't
down to sit down and talk, then neither am I.  They want to get guns and
supress my people further (via racist laws, racist policies, racist
institutions), then let's go ahead and get it on!

Once this rubbish rises to the top, maybe then it will be the best
opportunity this country has had to deal with it by suqashing it, like the
infectious virus it is.

There is really only one question.  Whose side will you be on.

As for sitting at a table and discussing someones supremacy over me,
untenable.  We can deal at the table as equals only, anything else should
and would not be considered.

I think Buke is the best thing to happen to this country since white bread.
I am GLAD he's winning, I am glad he has chosen the issues that he has,
and I am glad he's bringing it to the front of the debate.  Maybe then, we
have the best opportunity to RID this place of the vermin he attracts, and
rid this nation of the ideas he aspouses.

Let all of those silly fools vote for him.  If he wins it will be due not
only to those supremacist factions, but due to complacency and lost hope of
the millions of disenfranchised here.  Sad, but true.  One can only hope,
as GeoffW said, that this will serve to mobilize people.  Cuz' if it
doesn't happen via the ballot, then it is time for the bullet.  This will
be rather ugly.

As we progress into the 21st century, I am losing hope that we, as a
people, have the guts to face our past, deal with that history and move on.
Americans have a tendecny to want to move on before correcting problems.
Thus, the rise of a Buke, or Farrakhan are predictable under such
circumstances.  As Malcolm said, the chickens are coming home to roost.

I don't think America is really ready for her next revolution that will pit
those Bukeites against people of color and women.  I don't think the people
who vote for Buke understand that they will NEVER roll back the clock so
that we have "Driving Miss Daisy" as he standard for black white relations,
or into the lilly white future as portryed by the book and movie "A
Handmaids Tale".  I also don't think America can continue to lock up 50% of
the African population here without something giving way.  I for one am
growing increasingly impatient with a minority (those who run this
country), telling the majority (those of us who don't run this country),
what to do, how to act, and who will be punished according to standards
that do not equally apply (funny how everyone jumps on Affirmative Action,
but are silent when it comes to the racist drug laws, racist immigration
laws, and institutions both public and private that discriminate agaisnt
people of color and women). A note: Affirmative Action when applied, does
work.  Looking at the prison population, which is now 51% African, we know
that recruitment efforts ARE working, in fact they have reversed the trend
of a majority white prison population, to one that is much more
representative of the REAL problem, Africans. ;)  I also know that women
should/might be feeling especially fearful.  They (Repubs, Bukeites)
basically want to make sure that women assume thier natural station as
vessels and baby making sex machines for the future society (I have often
wondered why the abortion debate involves men at all.  Couldn't have
anything to do with falling birth rates, low sperm counts and the like now
could it?).  I think sisters (i.e Women) will rise to the challenge as
well.

I volunteer to be the first to throw the molotav cocktail at any repressive
MF who dares try to jail me, or put me in the back of the bus.  In other
words: IT'S ON!

Negotiation?  A non-option.  Live free or die.  First stop, city hall.

(BTW: Please do not make the mistake of thinking that because you're in the
bay area we're free.  Quite the contrary, this will be the FIRST place to
be under lockdown when the TIME comes.  Freedom costs plenty!).

This country needs an enema,

This is correct.  Witness the LP "Having a Rave-up with the Yardbirds" (by
The Yardbirds, of course), which came out in the '60s.

There is many of us old farts in this scene.  I'm 36, but very rarely ever

Hi everyone,

Is there a Wicked this Saturday night? I didn't see it mentioned in the
calendar. If there is, who is the special guest?

Keep smiling,

Back in The Day (tm), that is _exactly_ what Spun sounded like: slow,
trippy, breakbeat house with a healthy dose of that old-school Detroit
flavor. I avidly collect mixtapes of his from that period. He's the first
DJ I ever heard spin Underground Resistance's "Final Frontier" (one of
the finest techno tracks ever recorded). I used to eagerly anticipate his
rare visits to Portland, because at that point I thought that he had the
most unique and well-defined sound of any of the West Coast DJs (except
maybe Doc).

I don't know what happened to him. I'll leave it at that. ;)

While we're talking about mixed CDs, I have to heartily recommend the
N-Fusion Volume 2 CD, with chunks mixed by Monty and Markem. It's a few
years old, but it's _packed_ with classic tunes and just exudes that
smokey, left-coast flavor. Monty, of course, is the same Monty that spun
at this last weekend's Friends'n'Family, and is a champ of a guy, as well
as a mighty DJ. He claims that this CD is hard to find, but I happen to
know where a few secret caches of it exist. :) So keep your eyes open.

Also, on a more commercial note, for awhile the Doc Martin mix CD
(_Urbmix: Flammable Liquid_) was pretty much nailed into my CD
player. Primo house, trance, and smooth techno put together by one of the
few true masters of the mixing arts (I can't _stand_ house anymore, but
I'll walk miles out of my way to hear Doc spin). And while we're talking
about SoCal DJs, I've heard tell that Taylor's _United DJs of America_
disc isn't too bad.

They = Those who make the racist/sexist/xxxist laws in this country.  And 
those who enforce them.  Those who aspouse racist/sexist/xxxist views, 
and act on them.  Those who embrace the ideals of hatred instead of 
peace.  They are my enemy.

my people are African-Americans AND ANYONE ELSE who sees through the 
facade of the joke bka Amerikkka bka big biz, bka money money money, bka 
tyrannical non-recylable manifest destiny rampant free-market capitalism.

My target is quite clear.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  I could give a damn what color you 
are.  It is obvious what color you have to be to join Buke, Duke, Wilson 
& their bunch.  I don't pass the test.  Those who join in that camp are 
the problem.  I want ALL of them to come to the surface, and let's have 
it out.  Get it above ground Mr. Buke, so our target becomes really clear.

A race war?  Those on the other side will see it that way.  I of course, 
see it as a war of liberation against opressors.  It just so happens that 
in this instance (like ALL others in the history of this kkkountry), they 
are white males.  That does not mean that white males could not join the 
opressed and overthrow these opressors.  The real issue becomes, who side 
will you (or I) be on.

I am convinced that there is really only one course that people will have 
to take to ensure their liberty, and that is armed revolt & rebellion 
against what is going on now.  Politicians will turn this thing racial 
(it ain't that hard), to make white men  act on their historical fear.  I 
think it will work, it always does (remeber Willie Horton, code words 
like welfare mother, inner city crime, rough areas, gangstah etc.).  I 
also think there will be some who won't buy into it, but I am well aware 
that they might be in the minority.

What will it take to get people to get along.  Equality & Freedom.  How 
is this state to be obtained?  through great sacrifice, including the 
giving of ones life.  I'm down for it...I believe that strongly!

My son will NOT live the life of his great great grandfathers.  And fuck 
Miss Daisy ;)

I think I've answered your question my brother.

Yes, they cvertainly are being replaced, with fresh new younger faces, 
and fresh code words, all masking a really stinky, old, moldy idea of 
supremacy.  I mean, c'mon the whole idea of Young Republicans counters 
what you have just said.  These ideas are always gaining ground in the 
most unlikely of places.

I DO think change will happen, I just think that negotiating change in 
such a corrput system as this is moot.  It will either come by ballot or 
bullet (Malcolm X).

Hmmm.. I think you hit it on the head Todd!  This is a GREAT idea.  Just

        So, then, HOW did MDMA cause liver necrosis? and jaundice? Does it
ever say anything remotely close to an explanation about the the cause and
effect relationship between the chemical and the physical damage it does?
These articles are interesting but i don't see much of a connection being
drawn; other than the tenuous connection implied by the writing style. If
MDMA does cause liver necrosis, brain damage, bad breath or anything, i DO
want to know, but this doesn't really prove much IMHO. Like, for all we
know, these guys could all have been alcoholics, or have been suffering
from numerous other 'unstated' or 'unknown' problems and the only
connection they all have is that all were 'ravers' and used MDMA. The most
i can come up with is that MDMA catalyzed the deaths of people who may have
already been killing themselves with other lifestyle choices, or other
physical ailments. Man, i WISH someone would do some serious research about
this!!!!
        I would rather have serious 'unbiased' scientific research that
clearly makes apparent the dangers, rather than have some journalist take
pathological studies and filter them down to us with their own
socio-political biases. Then again, that's the mass-media for ya!

        So, going by an intertextual analysis of this, we have 500,000
users per week, and seven deaths with varying factors surrounding the
deaths found in the last three years. Hmmm.

        So, again, it says it's NOT heatstroke that caused these deaths,
and it MAY be toxic contaminants (though one of these three reports says
that there were no contaminants found) so, all that being ruled out; HOW
did MDMA cause the necrosis?

        EXACTLY! So, did it? It's not really answered in any sort of cause
and effect sort of way. Is there any background information provided on the
deceased and the lives that they lead previous to their misfortune?

        So, NOW it's saying that the damage to the organs was "consistent
with overheating" (hyperthermia) wheras the other two articles said that
hyperthermia and toxic 'other' chemicals were NOT the cause. ?
        Like i said, i'm more than willing to have someone tell me that
MDMA causes irrevesible damage to the human body, but i'm definitely not
going to listen to a journalist.  I wish that people could get past their
own political agendas for a bit so that we could all get to the bottom of
this and prevent any other deaths and/or reduce the fear for those who
choose to use.
        peace,

                brad

if there are any chem types on the list who can fill me in better on the
cause and effect relationship b/n MDMA and necrosis based upon their
understanding of the techie part of the study (not these articles) i'd
appreciate hearing from you! :)

There's also
	(1) some old david bowie song i cant remember that uses rave
	    in the appropriate context.
	(2) a Steel Pulse song called "ravers" that goes something
	    like "sounds called ravers, got you craving for more..."

There's this 10 part series on "Rock and Roll" that was broadcast on
PBS (actually a BBC + that boston public tv station) which covered 
popular music from buddy holly to r&b, funk, blues, rock, heavy metal,
acid rock, punk, and even house, techno and ambient... i remember some
of the early shows on the psychedelic revolution in the late 60's
mentioning "rave ups" as well. All night parties in the UK (machester i
think) where everybody would drop acid and listen to the yard birds,
pink floyd, beatles, etc. This is all vague recollection, so please
pardon any inaccuracies. (i have them videotaped -- i'll have to give
them a look again sometime).

Yeah, that's a bit closer to the original lyrics that MJ lifted from
Manu Dibango's "Electric Africa" which, incidentally is available on
the 3CD Celluloid Compilation called "trilogy" on the CD called "New
Africa 2". Song was written by Manu Dibango, produced by Bill Lasswell,
with Herbie Hancock, Aiyb Dieng, and a variety of other star musicians
performing. (I played this track at Burning Man in the ambient RV
circle one afternoon; With lots of fuckups I was having problems with
some weird ass CD-mixer that I'd never used before). 

"memories on the dance floor strech back a long way when it comes to classics, 
and this will be welcomed with arms akimbo" is what Music Week says about
this track (whatever that means -- just copied from the liner notes).

Excellent reactions to the media propaganda!  I, too, would like some hard
facts.  Unfortunately, it's illegal to scientifically test the stuff, just
as it is for other controlled substances.  Every time a physician appeals
for permission to test or to use a controlled substance for medical
purposes, treatment of ailments, etc., someone up the chain nixes it.
(Sigh).  So, for now, we'll have to be careful, use a little common sense,
and try to take care of each other...

Actually just Fusion Vol.2. If you're really lucky, maybe you can find a
copy of Fusion Vol.1, with Monty and Andre Lucero.

Not to be a trainspotter but the original song is called "Soul Makossa" by Manu Dibango and it is the mothership!!  The track on the Celluloid compilation is a cover Manu Dibango did later in the 80's.

i'm NOT a doctor, but when i read the post about E and liver damage, it
  occurred to me that the liver, being a filter, is really vulnerable
    to ANY manmade substance, be it tylenol (which can destroy yer liver
      in sufficient amounts) or E, or whatever.  
in the 'no duh' category, look at alcohol, a NATURAL substance; it too can
  cause dead areas in the liver, that's what cyrrhosis is...
keep yer filters clean, peeple

I heard Spun spin at a full moon rave in Half Moon Bay in Summer 1992.  I 
know what old skool Spun sound you are talking about.

Solid Grooves in San Jose has a pretty extensive CD collection, though I
didn't notice if they carry DJ mix CDs in particular. They do carry a quite
a few DJ cassettes. A good Detroit techno vinyl section, and the staff are
really helpful and cool. They're located at 368 S. Bascom.

take care!

I can tell you from personal experience....(36 years of it), that your only
an old fart if you feel like one..........I love to have the knowledge and
experience 36 years have given me....and I wasn't the same person even 2-3
years ago, I have come to appreciate my world (both my worlds....I'm a
gemini.....) 
 
At the age of 25 I was so lost, at the age of 30, I was still searching,
and finally as I moved into my mid 30's I began to see and feel and hear,
(coincidently, I might add that's about the time I moved to S.F.) 
 
My experiences in the rave culture have helped to nurture me through to
another way of life, and to set myself free ....... 
 
I thank all of you who have helped to support the clubs and raves, the
culture and each other. I feel there is so much more to give.....that I
feel like a teenager all over again....young and vibrant, and so full of
hope. 
 
Last nite I took a new friend and her 60 year old mother to the top, to
introduce them to my world, to show them a slice of s.f. nitelife, before
we went she asked me what the age limit was and I said that at 36 I am
towards the older segment, so she was feeling that it might not be her cup
of tea.........but as the nite progressed, I played from reggaae dub to
trip hop to hip hop to house, and then Garth took over from there.....say
no more.......when I spoke to her after my set, she was totally into the
music so much that she was explaining to me, how the songs bridged (mixed)
together so well and how the music went up and down emotionally and had all
these creshendo spots that every one would scream etc.....I was stoked that
she understood the music, and the vibe.....it turns out she was formerly
married to a black jazz pianist, and at 2 am when the top closed she wanted
to know where the black funky ass music is......she had more fun than any
human is allowed, and she was right at home, and the was accepted by the
crowd too, she was talking to all kinds of people, totally cool, But she
brought with her the right frame of mind, an open to anything attitude, she
brought the vibe.......It was fun to watch her interact so smoothly with
everyone..... 
 
So I ask you.......is there an age limit to our
culture..........hardly....its all in the mind 
and I can tell you that if I'm still walking around when I'm 60 years old,
I'll still be playing my music........say no more

The cabin is officially ours.  All three stories of it.  w/added bonus of
indoor sauna.  (Tribal sweat-drumming chamber)  I've been swamped lately, and
have had lots of response so I haven't been able to finalize the list of
who's in, so just hold in there.  But if i've told you you're definitely in,
please send your checks of ASAP. I bargained down an $900/wknd cabin to $650,
so it will be $25 a person, I'd prefer the whole amount, but if you can only
send half now, thats fine.

I've always had trouble with this too... Shawna and I were talking about it
the other day, and the only thing I can come up with is that there really
isn't a clear-cut difference between styles. Maybe between jungle and
ambient and trance or something, but other than that it's more the "feel"
of the music rather than any specific formula. Maybe I'm wrong, please
someone set me straight because pigeonholes suck when you can't even define
them properly.

Methinks house is characterized by a really simple 120bpm "boom-chik" kinda
beat... pretty sparse, some horn samples... popular at frat parties because
the sorority girls seem to enjoy it... :)

This was a really great series... the last installment covered rap and
techno: "beat" driven music in general... They had an interview with Alex
Paterson (orb) sitting in this throne surrounded by swirling smoke and
stuff... didn't get too far into the "scene" but then again they set aside
like 15 minutes for it.

	I like it anyway. :-) Though I prefer it to be 170-180bpm or more. But I
am not into the overly "musical" or ambient stuff, or stuff where the beat drops
out or gets hidden "behind" other tracks, or things like samples/mixes with
"Real Music". I like it to have no more than like 4 or 5 discernable layers and
to be fairly repetitive. Maybe I'm ill? ;-)

Well, I didn't say I didn't *like* it... It just seems really simple when
compared to, say, acid trance, _anything_ by the Orb, or *especially*
Jungle-- one of my favorites!

I prefer dancing to music that changes a lot, because the way I dance I get
weary just bumping around to the same beat for prolonged periods of time...
I like sets that alternate between crazy fast parts and more melllow
parts... e.g. almost anythingplayed out at MAD (phred your set rocked last
monday!)

see you at Chrysalis?

shawna, 
 
It generally has to do with the tempo of the beats and the patterns of the
beats..... 
 
to some degree the tempos are something like this 
 
60 bpm-90+ (beats per minute)    reggae & reggae dub 
 
80bpm-110ish                                   rap/funky beats 
 
100-119bpm                                        hiphop/funk/ 
 
120-130ish                                            house 
 
128+ -140ish                                        trance 
 
130ish on up                                        techno 
 
120-180 ish                                               jungle(double
time reggae) 
 
I may have missed a few areas but roughly speaking these are the tempo
changes 
 
Now the basic house beat is a 4/4 beat that is it just goes boom boom boom
boom, repeat 
 
wheras a funky break beat has more of a boom boom chack, bdoom bdoom chack,
repeat 
 
It's hard to describe, I could show you on my turntables, Its basically
small differences, that in time you pick up on.......good luck    moonpup  
 say no more

	Exactly, which is why I don't like that kindof stuff. Don't get me
wrong, I go places where it's played (especially in the SanFran scene I have
not been able to find anywhere that plays music as fast as I would like). For
me, if the beat pauses or does "hip hops" more than a few times during the 5 or 6
minutes of the song I start to lose interest. I have some really fast hard stuff
that is very acid-based, but it doesn't sacrifice the amphetamine-level beat.
The problem I have with the Orb stuff I have heard is that it is too "ethereal"
or "spacy". Have you heard any Cellblock X, Bioreactor, or Latex Empire?

> I prefer dancing to music that changes a lot, because the way I dance I get

	Actually, I have no idea how to dance, I just groove on the music.

	I keep intending to go to MAD, since it sounds the closest to what I want.
But basically I just make up my own compilation cassettes so I can listen to
all fast stuff when I am on my own.

> the crate.  Well let's hope the snow stays cold and the hot tub warm!

The snow will most likely be excellent.  I just spent the last two 
weekends in Tahoe.  They got lots of snow and I don't forsee anything 
happening to it all in the next two weeks.  So, have lots and lots of 
fun.  If you need any tips on rentals or ski resorts you can email me.  
I'm from there and know of lots of cool places.  :)  

Best wishes,

Tim,

I'm sorry that you've decided to sign off from the Sfraves list.  Just so you
know, I actually don't delete messages until after I've read them.  So, not
everyone is deleting your messages!  The only thing that I delete without
reading is the SFRaves calendar.  I live in Santa Barbara now and it makes me
miss SF to read the calendar.  Anyway, if you think that this list is a waste
of your time, it probably is.  However, I encourage you to stay on the list
because there are some people on this list who are really trying to elevate the
vibe to a higher level.  This is good for all of us!  Also, there are some
pretty goofy posts sometimes that make you smile Admit it, I know you smiled
when people were posting all those Schoolhouse Rock lyrics from when we were
young! ;)

Anyway, if you decide to split, I wish you sweetness and light.  Sadly, I won't
be running into you at any parties anytime soon :(

warmly,

--

Uh oh, here goes.  What is house music?  "A new form of music that gives
complete freedom of expression."  Actually, house is anchored firmly in
the four-to-the-bar kick drum and deep, loud bass that underlies much of
dance music generally.  Like any musical style, it's kind of hard to
describe exactly.  In addition, the term "house" covers a very wide
range now from near-ambient to post-disco club sounds to very minimal
"Chicago track" styles to very fast 
"nu-energy" to what-have-you.  So it's very dangerous to generalize,
but I think house is pretty well defined by its underpinnings, the use
of drums and bass in a propulsive, steady beat typically between 115
and 135 beats per minute (although the new "high energy" styles go up
as high as 160).  House has many influences, but disco, soul, gospel,
funk and jazz, especially Latin jazz, all can be found in the house
genre, either as rhythmic or melodic foundations or as direct samples.
As far as samples, actually, hip hop has also been a big source although
the rhythmic structures are somewhat different.  

It's really hard to generalize about house, and there are very wide
overlaps with other genres like techno.  It has the breadth of jazz
in its many variants but is almost entirely designed to be dance music,
where jazz branched out and became mostly listening music.


But most of all, house is a feeling, just like the blues.

An abbreviated version of the actual paper published in the Journal of
Clinical Pathology was passed on here by someone.  For anyone who missed it
or found it impenetrable, the authors' claims were much more cautious than
is suggested in these articles.  They said basically: here we have some
people whose deaths were connected with MDMA use--can we identify any
pattern of abnormal pathology in them?  The answer is yes--liver damage,
etc.--but the authors make quite clear that they  have no evidence for any
biochemical relationship between MDMA and these pathologies.  They point
out that their findings are consistent with other pathology patterns
observed in non-MDMA situations, notably with the tissue damage found in
heatstroke or hyperthermia victims, which of course is the same old news
that's been around for years: trippers dancing madly in stifling overheated
environments can find themselves overheated as well.  They note that not
all of the subjects died in hyperthermia, but leave open the possibility of
damage due to previous non-fatal hyperthermic episodes.

This is a reasonable synopsis, but it takes on a different sense in the
context of the JCP paper rather than in a  popular press scare article.

I myself doubt that a majority of American voters would support Buchanan.
But remember, he doesn't need a majority...15% is enough, if only 30% vote.
And that doesn't seem unlikely at all.

You do hear it, and (IMHO) it's not even too bad, but it's incredibly
limited...they might have three or four house tunes playing, but that's
*all* you'll hear in any given week or two.  And naturally even the coolest
house track gets monotonous when it's played again and again, totally
straight.  KMEL is a bit better, especially on weekend nights, and they
also play (mostly on the same schedule) cool hip-hop that's more fun than
the typical Top 40 stuff.

KOME ("modern rock"), interestingly, has never played any sort of
house/techno tune that I've heard, yet uses them incessantly as backdrops
for DJ announcements, station IDs, and so on.  Obviously they appreciate
something in the style, but don't think it's worth playing as "real" music.

does anyone know the penalty (fine etc.. ) for driving with a suspended

I just got a ticket for "running a red lite" and my bike was impounded. 
 
I wonder if anyone else has dealt with this and knows how long the licence
is suspended further, and what the fine and other penalties are ? 
 
I have to appear in early april........moonpup (very bummed)

Hi, everyone !!!


Hello, my name is Matt.  I moved to Berkeley from San Diego about two months
ago. Berkeley is rad, but I don't know many people here yet.  Shouts out to
Mike: thanx for showing me how to subscribe to SFRaves.

I would like to say hi to everyone here at SFRaves.  It's nice to see that
that are other people with similar views and tastes in music, especially
when almost everyone around you is into Green Day and TLC.  

Anyway, about me.  I've been raving avidly for the past two-n-half years.
Before my rave days I was heavily into electro-industrial (Lassigue
Bendthaus,FLA,etc.). I still enjoy the genre, especially Lassigue Bendthaus.
The man behind the group is Victor Sol, also of the Atom Heart/Datacide
fame. OK, enough about the past.                       

San Diego has a nice scene that's constantly improving, especially in the
trippy/happy/acid trance area. Recently, the Evolution Tribe opened their
first store, which is called The Elevator. Two excellent DJs work there,
David X and Electric Sheep.  If anyone ever gets a chance to go to one of
their parties in San Diego, definitely go. Besides being amazing DJs,
they're also very friendly and down to earth kinda guys. Mention me for a
discount( just kiddin').

Now back to Berkeley.  If anyone wants to respond, please do. Any mail is
appreciated.


Sincerely, 

Matthew Marat

BY YOUR COMMAND:

        First, what's going on tonight, Thursday 2/29/96.....oh my it's a
leap year.

        Second, looking for last weeks calendar and this weeks if it's out
yet, so could some kind soul please send it to me.

        Third, I've been down for over a week sleeping with my new system
which at this point is about 85% stable and going up(yes, I'm cohabiting for
all you tech heads in Win 95, with unsupported hardware, & without even a
warning). However, and to my dismay my ISP provider went  down as well, and
the unthinkable happened. They lost a weeks worth of mail, argh!!!!!! So if
you sent me something from Friday 2/23/96, until today, I haven't gotten it
& won't unless you resend.

        Fourth, I'm looking at my Alameda County Sample Ballot for the Green
party, and yes I see Ralph Nader is their parties Candidate for President of
the United States. WE have a chance to place a good honest person in office,
please don't pass this one by. If anyone would like to discuss this with me,
please e-mail me privately, thanks.

        Finally, with my new system I picked up Delrina's CommSuite for
WIN95, by Symantec. It's an integrated Web Browser, Fax Software,
Communications Packages with Full Internet Functionality(eg Mail, IRC, FTP,
Gopher ...etc), all in one package. It seems to work seamlessly, however the
Web Browsers appearance leaves something to be desired compared to Netscape,
which has wonderful appeal visually but lacks functionality. But for intro
price of $100 that I paid for  it at CompUSA it's worth it. You will pay at
least that to register all the other products that are out there and get
something less.

Sin

Doors of Perception

I hope this email to sfraves via aol, arrives in a readible format.  Note,
the 'ion.help' aol address is not my personal email address, which of course
is 'mh2o@well.com', however I wanted to get this post out today and this was
the only method to do so at the moment.  

Hello everyone.  My name is Maureen Garrett or Mau, some friends call me
Mobos, a schroom medicine name I was given at the '95 Burning Man.  I am
certain that many of you have seen me around, although the number of parties
I was able to experience in '95 diminished from '94 and that year from Jan.
'93.  Back in '93 there was a period where I was fairly active on sfraves as
well.

Several months ago, I re-subscribed mostly because I felt the loss of one on
one connectedness to the group mind and because like you, the House Movement
affects my very soul on a molecular level.. More on that perhaps at another
time.   

I have sat silent as a 'lurker' (so I am told we are called, those who simply
read and do not contribute) for the past few months.  (Speaking of lurker, it
really is a derogatory word you know, even in jest.)  So instead, call me a
'listener'.  For that is exactly what I have been doing these past few
months, listening to all of you speak.  

Now that the company I work for is between projects, I hope to utilize some
free time to express myself here.  Of course what I write, except for events
that are factual and hopefully expressed in an objective manner, all comments
are my opinion, my take on things, sometimes humble....If anything I say
pisses you off, before you 'flame on',  look in the mirror, for we are all
mirrors for each other.  The intent of this writing and sharing is multi
purpose, One is to remember, and One is to open a discussion of how we can
contribute to the prevention of the dystopian fascist society which is
approaching at lightspeed and makes any dark futuristic speculative SF novel,
see John Brunner, Philip K. Dick, etc., look like a picnic.  In essence, I
seek to focus my lens on the bigger picture and how that will impact us all
in the House, remembering ultimately that Mother Earth is the House and the
sky above, the atmosphere, is our roof.

There has been much discussion on sfraves of how we can get along as
individuals in the House.  Everyone here already knows intrinsically how to
do this.  I have been very moved by the ease in which many of you apologize
to each other for flames and by your conversations and quest for knowledge
and love for each other. 

I think the beginning act for each individual is 'to pay attention' to what
is going on around you.  Let there be no flaming wars amongst us, but heart
felt passionate discussions should there be any at all as a result of this
post.  Hear in you mind the ending Apollo sample/mix from Banco de Gaia's
"Last Train to Lhasa".  Jump gate initiated, here goes:

The following questions were asked some time ago and my heart could not bear
the silence any longer.  And while I have taken them out of a greater
context, they remain part of the greater picture.  It matters not who asked
them.  They are:  "Who are all the other people we are so scared of?"  "Who's
the big bad wolf?" "Why do we need bouncers at raves?"

"Why?" the 'Wacko Factor' for one.   E.g. you are standing near the produce
section of Safeway deciding whether to purchase romaine or spinach, and
someone pulls out a knife.  The common belief is that "it can't happen to me"
--yet  reality has often taught us.....

Those who forget the past, are doomed to repeat it....

REMEMBER

I believe it was in the late spring of 1993 when Gabe Caesara of Berkeley was
shot and killed at a party in Watsonville.  He was in his late teens, a
promising musician, and beloved son of Phillip and Linda, good friends to
myself and many others involved in a local underground shamanic community.
 (Why underground?  To avoid persecution from other religious communities.
 Freedom of Religion or Spiritual Practice...yah, right)

The party was being held in an old metal siding warehouse.  A young gentle
woman throwing the party was at the door when the  extremely drunk men
approached the first time.  My understanding from a conversation with her is
that she told them they could not come in because they were drunk and it
would ruin the vibe, (something to that effect).  They went away and came
back.  This time they returned with baseball bats and proceeded to demand
entrance again, and ended up pounding on the thin metal walls.  They went
away and came back once more, this time with a 22 caliber gun and fired 2-3
shots minimum through the metal.  One bullet entered the brain of Gabe (who
was peaking in a most ecstatic manner at the time, according to his brother
who was dancing with him) and died shortly thereafter in a hospital.  

The question I am certain which has haunted people for some time is
"Could this have been prevented had 'physically strong men & women' aka
Spiritual Warriors been guarding the front door?"  Or perhaps if this were to
ever happen again, and all rational attempts (backed by powerful Ki) to make
the drunken people 'go away and sober up' have failed, certainly before the
bullets are fired might the party be stopped and the police be called?  No
life is worth the chance of harm or death for any number of people getting to
continue to party, unless we are willing to dance and die for our
freedom--and may all the names of god or spirit prevent this from ever being
necessary......

I see Gabe's mother Linda a minimum of once a month for body work, and I
believe that both her and Phillip would be saddened to know that their son's
meaningless death had already been forgotten so it seems, by the people and
movement he loved so dearly .  That it also seems, no lesson was learned.
 Quote the Raven, "Nevermore."

Note:  For some time after Gabe's death, Martin O'Brian would hang a memorial
black light painting for Gabe at his parties.  And lastly, I realize that
recent discussion on sfraves indicate that there is a need for documenting
the history of the beloved House Movement. 
 
Stories such as these need to be included in that history.

MESSAGE
So when I hear thoughts written regarding whether or not we need security at
parties I can only exclaim, "Wake up people" or "Wake the fuck up people!"
which ever you choose..    The answer is "Yes", we need security at even the
most private and underground of parties for a variety of reasons, consider a
different view, a different approach to security:  

A TEACHING
**Consider security in a different light, and may they consider themselves in
a different light.**  Consider that the people who guard the perimeter of our
space are actually in fact guarding our ceremonial space, and that most
parties are ceremonies,  (sans many alchemical elements which could up the
energy level and potential for even deeper transformational work, IMHO).
  Often the unspoken overall intent of many parties is simply "dancing
esctatic as a group of individuals, to open or empty our minds so that new
things can enter."  Sometimes it happens collectively, nearly everyone comes
out with the same 'hit' on things.  

The security people serve an important purpose and they are doing a big 'give
away' to those of us who dance.  Thank them in some fashion before the party
ends.  Be appreciative of all the people who work at parties for that matter,
every time you dance-- consciously remember them.  And take turns at parties
giving away your night so that someone else can dance....  

REVOLUTION
Gabe might not have died had there been no need to 'hide what we were doing',
to be 'underground'.  I believe we all would prefer safe environments in
which to dance our dreams awake -- not fire trap, polluted, ill watered,
unventilated warehouses in very questionable areas of town.  True story.
 Hunter's Point, Cool World.  The very first rave I ever went to was around
January 4 of 1993 and those of us in line while a large gun was pointed at us
were ordered to "Drop Mother Fuckers, Drop!"  Many people were cowering
around me and I, as a Macumazon (Swahili-he who sleeps with one eye open, see
H.Rider Haggard, ) watched.  It was an undercover cop busting someone.  

I imagine there are those who 'like' the underground illegal feel to things,
sort of a rebellious response to the parental-like rules and laws of our
local, state, and federal governments.  I understand this, however we no
longer have the luxury of time (perhaps decades?) to grow up and growing up
in this sense means that not all rules and laws are bad, nor are all older
people miscellaneous versions of your parents, nor are they the enemy.  I
know y'all know this, however in our scene, the majority do not.  Many elders
(in most tribal cultures this means anyone older than you, especially alot
older than you or me) can speak from the portal of wisdom.   The battle is to
make what is illegal, legal...and we can do it if we focus our lens as a
collective...

I do not deny that there is a feeling of power in infiltrating the defense
grids of the local park rangers and sheriffs.  For myself, the greatest
feeling of an outdoor illegal party is that in the moment we are symbolically
dancing as free human beings, dancing with our ancestors thousands of years
ago, before the (anti*)-Christian hammer fell and drove us out of balance,
big time.   *Anti, for most do not love everyone as Christ allegedly did,
therefore they are not Christlike, big IMHO there.  When we go outside it is
always wonderful.  Imagine 'that' being always legal and hassle free,to dance
at night under the stars, virtually anywhere we choose?  Imagine a world
whereby we respect natures laws as well as an agreed upon set human laws? 

Yes, many of us who dance in this powerful light and state of being at
parties do indeed have an intense love in our hearts for everything and
everyone.  Yes the heartfelt smiles we beem at each other and strangers
affects their circles and so on and on.  Many of you have spoken in a manner
indicating that you believe this is enough...However, consider as we party
all night long, the United States Government, the NWO (obviously in this
context, a simplified statement pointing to a complex entity) continues to
swing towards a Fascist State throughout our trance night, and that manifesto
is being implemented without our consent as we hip hop along, as we
groove-out on the dancefloor...If you have not yet registered to vote, do so
and choose the lessor of two evils.  There is so much work to do, of course a
realistic goal is to put someone into the White House we believe in....For
now, vote for the lessor of two evils, don't throw your vote away to a
candidate who has absolutely no chance of winning.  Clinton has turned out to
be a sorry assed MF, but god help us if Dole or Buchannan is elected...  

THE HOUSE MOVEMENT
Definition, what it isn't.  It isn't just us.  It is everyone, every group of
people on a path which strives to dance in both  worlds, and the places
between.  I believe that all peoples around the world who have forgotten how
to dance would  rave (to any music) on any beach, desert, field, meadow or
mountain if really given the chance....

THERE AND BACK AGAIN
Think of life as a spiral dance.  What goes around does come around, above or
below the spiral (among other planes).  With the following, please see
meaning as opposed to any incorrect dates etc.   From 1966 on, when Flower
Power began coursing through the veins of open-minded people accross America,
(many of which were college students), the United States government did
everything in their power to kill the movement, by illegalizing mind
expanding drugs*(*they 'knew'), by killing our heros, satanising our music,
by using tear gas and bullets, and by providing the beginnings of a huge
media supplement to living instead of actually engaging one's life, which
Harlen Ellison referrs to as 'the Glass Teat' etc.  

Thirty years later, the dreams of the 60's have morphed and grown into The
House Movement.  We are back again for another chance, on a higher level on
that spiral.  It is no different today as we are still under attack, but the
war is much more insidious than before.  The enemy has had thirty years to
dig even deeper trenches--trenches of the mind, to condition the masses, to
alienate people from each other, from their neighbors, from themselves, to
instill hatred and bigotry in the hearts of millions of people, to 'allow'
the production of the truely destructive drugs and focus efforts to banish
the natural ones, the teacher plants given to us by this lifeform we have
named Earth, who many call Mother Earth..  Remember the first rule of war, is
to "Divide and conquer your enemies".  So what does this mean to the House
Movement?  

What do the above revolutionary ideals mean to those of us who believe that
the drumbeat we so love, is an ancient nuturing heartbeat connecting us to
all life, past present and future?  It matters not whether it be live or
techno, analog or digital, tribal drumming, goa or trance, house, industrial,
celtic, native american, music from every culture on earth, etc..  It means
that a great force is trying to dissuade us, to coerce us into accepting
their drum, which really isn't an instrument of peace but more like some
twisted pacemaker--a device for automatons.  It is a controlling device which
makes us work at unnatural speeds beyond human ability; it sends killing
stress to our biological hearts; it offers no reward for our toil.   

It is an artificial heart comprised of controlled pulses of electric
information, neither written or guided by the Bill of Rights, but by those
who seek to control your mind and body...obviously the massive fundamentalist
movement in America and others..  And the fluid of this heart is a mass of
unnatural chemicals and additives in food, in effect, artificial blood.  We
have become a nation eating damn near unpronouncable contents in the food
amassed with our methods of pharmaceutical pill popping at the slightest
nasal weeze.. I doubt we will ever evolve into creatures of light on this
path.  And on and on...

Admittedly the above is a dark picture, know that I could write pages and
pages praising the light of the House Movement, however I deeply believe that
if we ignore the dark spaces between, the places difficult look at, we risk
loosing it all.  (I apologize for using dark as a negative, for I love the
darkness of the forest, the blackness of the heavens, etc.).  In all
actuality, the forces who say they are the light are really the dark, and
those who dance in the House are the light..
hmmm, tonight I dance for House freedom and how to make it reality...that and
more.

We have much work to do my friends if you want to see your children dancing
in the House.  Where do we begin?  And ask the question, "Why are they afraid
of us?"  And remember, witches were burned at the stake for less....

At this time I wish to thank many people who have shared so much with me
since I began dancing in the House.  They are Jim, M, Bonnie, Martin, Kevin,
Jerry, Fred, all the folks who put on Unity I & II and those who danced for
Mal, the FMR Wicked Crew (especially the massive 'Clan of the Cave Bear'
party at Bonnie Dune during the summer of '94 and the NMR folks past, present
& future, the F8 Crew for bringing my favorite music to the Bay Area en
masse, (there was a time when I would go to parties just because one DJ spun
fast trance) and everyone who contributes the sound systems, everyone whoever
worked a party, or contributed amazing art and altars, the man with ceramic
peace necklaces in countless languages, everyone who projected the love and
happiness in their hearts through their smiles on a myriad of dance floors,
everyone who brings us 'clean' teacher medicines, and especially everyone who
creates the music we so dearly love and the DJ's who spin it.  I would also
like to thank Mr. Darkness for months of inspirational words which further
acted as a catalyst and got me off my listening ass...and I thank all those I
have forgotten.................

This morning when the clock turned 2:11 AM I entered my "Secret to Life, the
Universe and Everything" birthday and will be attending F8's event tonight,
March 1.  Come up and introduce yourself, I will be wearing a big black belt
with bullets and chains, (the best use of bullets I have ever seen), plus
other clothes ;-).  I will look for those laminates and various postings of
what y'all are wearing tonight as roadmaps.  Peace, love &  ...

NTM love for all of the members of the scene.  I'm 45, try to hit most of
the phat parties here in DC, and those in SF when I can get there.  Except
for the occasional remark - wow, man, you're older than my father -- it's
totally kewl.  Welcome and enjoy!

 I would strongly suggest that if the planning for this party is a GO ,
then don't schedule it opposite a competing outdoor rave. I found a 
nice little dell in a park near San Carlos and Redwood City , that I 
scheduled an SFRaves party for . What I didn't know was that a great
outdoor rave was scheduled for the same date in Marin - nobody showed
up at the park party!

 The spot is still there , of course - I'd suggest it again as a place
for a party when the weather improves. I can provide directions and a
description of the place.

Dear All,
                We just wanted to thank everybody who came out to hear
Derrick May and Stacey Pullen play last night. It was great to see the
people of San Francisco going crazy to some of Detroits best.

        Also, many thanks to all those that logged on for the Hotwired
Feedback broadcast, it will be archived at Hotwired so if you missed it
last night you can go back at check it out at your leisure.

        http://www.hotwired.com/feedback

        Apologies to those that were hoping to recieve the live broadcast
from the event, but it was rendered impossible by a last minute change of
venue and lack of a suitable connection. The entire nights music was
recorded and will be broadcast art a later date by KFJC. We'll keep you
updated at...

        http://www.manmade.com/transmat.html

        Once again, thanks to everyone for making it such a great night from

        natural music
        transmat records
        space children

The real audio on hotwired was from 6-9 there were people logged on from
all over the world, can't understand why you had a problem.
        As for the MBONE we had a load of problems, the main one being a
power cut, at the site of our server, thats why you couldn't get our
address. As well as problem getting pac bells help from to short  a notice
due to the venue change. Sorry but we did everything humanly possible to
get it
out from the party, but the odds were against us.
        DH
p.s The site is back up try http://www.manmade.com/transmat.html for shockwave

V-site.net (host of manmade.com) suffered a power failure followed by

 For you insecure , paranoid folks , he did make a mistake - it is
TODAY , Mar. 2nd , not tomorrow , Mar. 3rd. That is - right now!
 
 The phone message also said that there will be another Chrysalis 
sometime later in the last two weeks of March.

	I still haven't gotten official news that Autechre is *not* playing 
SF.  Please, give it to me, harsh-reality-style so that I can quit 
praying and get on with my life!  Please?

	Yeesh.  I can't believe this, Tom Waits and Autechre, my two 
*most favorite* artists in the world, and I lose the chance to see both 
by this much.... 
	[holding thumb and forefinger really close]

	All that plus the double bummer of the F8 bust and 
Chrysalis fooferah this weekend.  I think I'll go and drown my sorrows in a 
pint of Ben&Jerry's.

Like many,I am sorry the F-8 party was busted* on Friday night.  A thought 
crossed my mind and I don't know if y'all checked this out before 
acquiring that space or not.... *busted for noise

Now that many old warehouses are being converted into 'Live in    
artist work spaces' odds are that people will be living around many older 
warehouses. A good thing to do would be to knock on a few doors or ring a 
few buzzers in the vicinity of the site to make this determination. 
 
If this venue research fact didn't cross your mind, perhaps it will help 
next time, if it did, sorry for any redundancy.  --Maureen

If one were to examine history, the CITIZENS of this country are to be
feared.  WHY do you think all of the anti-gun legislation has been passed
over the last 20 or so years?  To keep the citizenry under control.

I do not fear the citizens having guns, I do fear the govt. having them
though.  And if there is any civil unrest, it will, as always, be portrayed
as a group of rebels against a good govt.  This time (as always) the lines
will be drawn by the govt. along social boundaries (race, sexual
orientation, etc.).

Humans are best at merciless violence.

But I'll tell you this much, it is better to die on your feet than live on
your knees.  If it's time to fight and die, then let's go.  If you think
that after 450 years that this govt. is anywhere closer to solving the
massive socila problems they've created, then all I could accurately say is
that you're misguided.

American's, especially this generation, don't really understand the
sacrifice necessary to maintain and keep a democracy.  We do not
participate in it (look at the voter turnout of 18 - 3o year olds,
abyssmal), we haven't died for it (the wars of late , as most others, have
been blatanly over resources), and we're generally very skeptical.  Usually
skpeticism can enhance a democracy, ours has proven to be our greatest
undoing.  Skepticism here leads to a sense of never being able to change
things.  I mean there are hell of 18-30 year olds.  Now yes, we all do not
share the same political beleifs, but to have the PREVIOUS generation make
our laws is ridiculous.  What the fuck does Bob Dole, or any of the current
crop know about PEOPLE.  Yeah, they know about 1 kinds of person whose
profile is white, heterosexual, and male.  All others need not ask (do you
think any of these polticians even saw a person of color or lesbian until
recently?).  So since we're so disenfranshised by the system, we have
decided to excerisize that other option and not vote.  This has led to the
right gaining the forefront of policy, and others being driven farther away
from the process (just what they want, besides they can narrow their
message even further.  why court YOU if YOU don't vote?).  this is
dangerous, this will cause major strife.  The system requires the
lubrication of participation in order to work, what we have now is NOT a
democracy.

So to change it we will either:
1 - Have to vote en masse as no other time.  90+% turnout at the polls of
18-30 years olds.
2 - The bullet.  A system that ius unrepresentative of the people is a
tyranny.  Tyranny must be overthown by any means necessary.  Violence is
usally the most expedient (people who are in  the priviledged calls will
NOT come to any table to negotiate what they will lose in an Equalist
society.  They gotta to be brought in fighting if #1 does not take place).

So all this talk of miltias and the govt.?  Who cares?  You'll be on one
side or another.  Who knows, militias may join other anti-govt. groups for
the same goal of freeing the country from the tyrants.  Stranger things
happen during wars, where common goals criss cross.

I of course hope that we can come to a peacful resoltuion, but with the
propaganda machine in full blast, and even so called 'enlightened' people
buying into it, my hopes are not high.

NOTE:  There has been a concerted effort to paint Affirmative Action as
racist,  welfare mothers as black & lazy, gays being a threat to national
security, wpem taken out of the abortion debate, the poor as the root of
all societies ills, and children as things that need to be controlled.   So
far they've done a really good bamboozle job on the amerikkkan public.
They've also done a good job of pitting us against each other.  I hate
seeing so much humanity act like suckers.  This country needs an enema.

Peace & hope,
John

Well, there were more than enough things to choose from this weekend...

The Transmat tour stopped in at Prometheus Unbound and was without a doubt
the pick for friday night. SF debut of Detroit masters Derrick May and
Stacey Pullen was not something to pass up.  I thought Wayne summed it up
well, these guys were definitely "professional", and it was great to see
them in action.  It made my month. 

The free chrysalis party at the Berkeley Marina was pretty fun. It was a
really beautiful day, nice views of the bay and the city while listening
to some killer tunes spun by Joe and Monty (and Alex later on I think but 
we missed him...). 

I think everyone should make a point of heading over to MAD monday night
to catch another Detoit legend, Juan Atkins (call in sick if you have to). 
It promises to be one of their best nights yet... 

Andy

ps I recently picked up a really great book, "What Kind of House Party is
This?" by Jonathan Fleming. This is a must-read for anyone interested in
learing about the history of the global house culture. It's published in
the U.K. so there's a little more of a british slant, it mainly focuses on
DJ and different parties, lots and lots of pictures. The one drawback is
that they don't spent much time talking about the artists that create the
music, but that's a whole book in itself.  $30@soundworks (clinton

Good point, but I think in this song, Roger Waters (?) was specifically
talking about Syd Barrett (the whole Wish You Were Here album being a
tribute to Syd). Syd was  an original Pink Floyd member
(lyricist/vocalist) that took too much LSD and eventually went insane
to the point where he could no longer function as a contributing member
of Pink Floyd. That's too bad, because IMHO, PF went downhill in a big
way after Syd left -- like I really needed to hear their whining,
pompous psychodrama in albums like "The Wall".

Anyways in SOYCD, I think PF meant "raver" as in "raving lunatic".

I have a couple of Syd Barett solo CD's -- excellent ranting in that
special nonsensical way that UK folk possess -- jabbering on about
absolutely nothing in a way that sounds most fascinating and silly.
Check out "Baby Lemonade" or "Effervescing Elephant" sometimes... great
songs!

Actually, there's a big diff between what they "know" (plenty) and what
they espouse publically. Hypocricy.

The last time they "knew about PEOPLE" was when they were buggering
their 16 year old congressional pages, while holding McCarthy-style
witch hunts against those more open with their sexuality. I think what
you actually see in the older generations is a lot of closeted
"aberrant" (their words) behavior combined with judeo-christian guilt
against their nonexistant sins. Then they persecute other people doing
their exact same thing to hide/reduce their own shame in the eyes of
"god". Christianity and hypocricy go hand-in-hand and gland-in-gland...
and it's been that way since the beginning (hypocricy==religion
in general).

This same kind of behavior is now continuing under the guise of the
christian right and the christian coalition, as well as a variety of
priests that are giving penis-shaped absolution unto the orifii of 
preadolescent boys and girls, while spouting hypocricy about premarital
sex, homosexual sex, abortion, etc.

In the past, this happened plenty as well. Hoover, as FBI director was
infamous for using information about people's private lives as
political ammunition. He used it against closeted homosexuals in the
government and military, but he also used it against heterosexuals not
espousing monogamous christian "family values". (e.g. Hoover had JFK in
his pocket because of threats of exposing JFK's and RFK's womanizing).
Meanwhile Hoover himself, a closeted homosexual, found himself in the
position of protecting the Mafia from FBI investigation because the mob
had pictures of him and his mate performing oral sex in a
mafia-controlled vegas penthouse suite. Why do you think the mafia got
so big during hoover's 50 year tenure in government? And How did hoover
manage to stay in office for that long? 

Hypocricy, family values, and right wing lies continue into the present
as well. Just yesterday, a major florida christian coalition government
stooge (a strong proponent of family values) was arrested and charged
with receiving a $22.00 blow job in a shopping mall parking lot... He
had a wife and 6 children -- fine family values.

What we're really seeing is a case of the emporors new clothes. People
are sexual animals and will do all sorts of crazy shit. Hiding our
animal nature under a veneer of christian propriety engenders the
hypocricy and hatemongering that we see nowadays -- the actions
continue to be the same while we use words and lies to cover up the
truths we can't control. Children and adults are taught to be closeted
and two faced and lieing so that they can keep their imaginary god
happy. And we can watch the daily playing out of our sick  hypocritical
society on the TV news, or in our own personal lives.

I don't think so.. You can oppose, YES!!!!, but not give them the right to have their own space...then it's NO!!! for me

I feel bad because groups like "rec.music.white-power" exist, but I believe the net should be a place for freedom and expression. I support Cuba on the planes incident, for example. I feel for Cuba's situation. I should be free to express it as one should be free to express what they think. ALSO, I HAVE A RIGHT TO WRITE TO USENET AND VOTE NO FOR THIS RACIAL_BASED GROUP!!! But i think this should not be taken as a purely rascist-anti-rascist issue. IMHO, The jewish people, who I think promoted this thread in many many other lists too, are not less bigoted than the nazi dudes. A black-power group wouldn't also offend me, it's just people who have things in common discussing their ideals. The problem is the propaganda...but this is another issue ;)

I know that they are my enemies, i am latin. But I am their enemy too. Don't think that there aren't rascists in teh rave scene..I MET MANY RACISTS-XENOPHOBIC PEOPLE ON RAVES! but I tend to believe that if they don't have their space too, we won't be living in a democratic country... Guess what will come next... ban rave newsgroups?? drugs newsgroups??/

sorry about that, but I think that they have the right to have their specific group in which they can discuss the music they like, and not bother groups where people who does not share their thoughts are.

just my opinion..

Tragic.   My roomate is a dedicated Food Not Bombs ,member, and he didn't
even know about this for sure.  I see him spend his entire sunday every week
cookin up grub for those in need.  I would fully be into helping these guys
out with their flyers, and do what ever I can.  Too bad I didn't catch wind
of this one earlier.  If anyone knows those involved, please forward this to
them.  I think it's important that we make an effort to support these kind of
events.

Just wanted to first say I've decided to stay on here thanks to a post from
Matt L. that got me thinking...thanks Matt. I will be doing must of my e-mail
from ...knucklehead@email.org...though, but I can still get mail via this
address.
 
Second, I've mentioned this BBQ several times but no one replied, maybe 2, so
know that everyone seems interested. I have a BBQ Pit that is the length of
my truck bed. My dad and I have a little catering company we do one the side
and use this BBQ pit for parties, contest. Which we have won a few 1st, 2nd
and 3rd place ribbon for our homemade BBQ sauce. Anyway it is there for
people to use, just let me know if you would like to use it, and the only
thing I ask is some to help load it in and off a truck. It only takes 2
people. And of course clean the ashes out. I hate driving down the freeway
with ashes flying about. Anyway I know Trolup was the one who brought this up
again, but I'd like to help in anyway. I can get with a few people and we can
start planning this NOW. for maybe end of this month or April. If anyone is
willing to get together with me we can start planning. Find a place, DJ's,
Food, drink, Big BBQ if needed. You can reach me at this email address or at
my other one.

Greetings!

	Thank you for posting this info Wayne, I am really looking 
forward to Burning Man '96!  After missing last year's event, I resolved 
that this time I will go.  The clincher was seeing the video footage of 
all those happy ravers rolling in the mud... (flashback to my Sesame 
Street post a few days ago -- imagine those imges from Burning Man 
interspersed with the kids running across the fields & such to Sesame 
Street at the beginning of the show!)  8)-
	A couple brief thoughts & questions...
	I understand that an event like this involves some expense to put 
together, and am willing to help support that.  However the manner in 
which this financial support is being solicited lacks imagination, in my 
opinion.  I fully agree with the originator of the message below that 
visitors should not come as "spectators to a show," but as participants 
in an outpouring of energy.  The invitation to volunteer and contribute 
artistically is definitely welcome.
	However I also feel that writing a check in exchange for 
registration and a t-shirt, and mailing it off to an address, with no 
specific names, faces, or expenses to connect you to the experience, goes 
directly counter to what those involved with Burning Man presumeably hope 
to create.  This type of support is more identified with mainstream 
shows, concerts, charity efforts, etc.  We can do better!
	Those who have extremely busy schedules may find it easier to 
simply send a check, but I for one would like my expression of support (I 
would avoid the word "registration" like the plague -- it smacks of 
commercial events) to take a more interactive form.  
	Whoever is reading this who is an active organizer of the event, 
give me a call -- my number is (415) 626-3036.  Tell me what materials 
are needed, and I'll donate some time and creative effort to producing 
something, or go out and buy something myself if need be, in the range of 
$25.  
	In short, please let me have a more direct role in this, so that when I 
go to Nevada later this year, I will feel like a participant outpouring 
energy, and not a spectator who has paid to be entertained.

Peace, Love, and Grooviness,
				<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. -  A couple off-the-wall ideas...
	Could this be the "year of the woman"?  A Burning Woman, with 
long hair and breasts?  Or a Burning Couple, perhaps?  On fire with love, 
even?  8)
	Imagine if someone flew over the site in a small plane during the 
festivities throwing out flowers, or something...  maybe a banner?  Or 
has this already been done?  Just a thought.

Whats follows is another advance release from the Spring 96 "Building Burning
Man" newsletter. '96 Registration form included at end'o'file; get a $10
discount if you send it in before June 1st!

*************************************************

SURVIVAL

Visitors to the playa should not come as spectators to a show. Instead, they
will encounter an interactive experience; a spontaneous outpouring of energy
that is created by our community itself. Burning Man is a phenomenon which
springs from your immediate involvement. We are not funded by grants or
product endorsements. We depend upon direct contributions. Hundreds of people
are now engaged in creating this year's event. Here is how you can help:

CONTRIBUTE
Send in your registration fee today!  By purchasing your ticket now for $25
you can save $10. Beginning in June tickets to the event will cost $35. Buy a
t-shirt or a video. If you can, make an extra contribution (see the check box
on order form). Many new projects- Mudhenge, the Inferno, a new public
transit project, and an elaborated Man-are being readied for 1996. None of
this will happen without your early support. If you are among those people
who already know they are coming to Burning Man, help us now.

VOLUNTEER
There is only one way to become a member of the Project.  You must do
something. Burning Man is a society of activists. Later this year we will
solicit volunteers to help us run the infrastructure of our camp. We are now
recruiting experienced builders, people to do data entry and distribute
flyers, help with clerical tasks, and individuals who can assist with
transport of materials to Nevada throughout the year. If you have any skill
or resource which you think might help us in our preparations, please call
our Hotline.

ARTISTS
In addition to the "Inferno," Burning Man is planning many new art
initiatives in 1996.  Our burning pageant in the desert on Sunday, September
1, will feature large-scale portable effigies that can be raised overhead.
 Puppeteers, model makers, stilt walkers, fire performers, etc.-please
contact us.  We also need folks to assist us in casting a large number of
plaster brains (yes, brains ) that will be featured at our premier show on
March 23 at the Minna Street Gallery in San Francisco.

MUDHENGE
In 1995 our camp was inundated by a rainstorm and mudpeople sprang from the
playa (you know who you are). In 1996 we will construct a temple and public
shower in which to house these rites. We invite all persons of mud to
worship, wallow, and bathe between the legs of "Water Woman" (Showers are
restricted to initiates. You must first get down in the mud). If you would
like to help construct and tend the temple, or wish to organize and schedule
an event here (i.e. mud wrestling, a mud procession, etc.) please contact our
Hotline.

PUBLIC TRANSIT
The playa of the Black Rock Desert is a fundamentally safe environment.
 Apart from the very real, dire, and life-threatening hazard of becoming lost
[please read the Survival Guide that is mailed to all registered
participants] the playa is as flat and as forgiving as the mattress of a
playpen. The greatest hazard that we face is self-created. Nearly every one
of the few serious accidents and injuries that we have witnessed during
Burning Man has involved automobiles. This year we encourage everyone to
bring bicycles. They are perfectly adapted to the hard-packed surface of the
playa.  We plan also to organize a pool of specially marked bicycles for
public use. If you can help us with this effort please call our Hotline.

FILM FEST
We are now accepting entries for the 2nd Annual Burning Man Film and Video
Festival. The deadline for submissions is July 4th. Please contact Coffee
Achievers at 415.826-3277. Ask for Hernan.

SETTLEMENT
This year, the city of Black Rock will sport a newly renovated downtown area
and a number of exurban hubs, or "meta-theme camps." If you want to create
your own city within a city, call the Hotline.

*************************************************

What flavor?  How about SFRaver Crunch?  (Neopolitan Ice Cream with those
little crunchy things in it.)  Or San Frandisco Swirl? (Chocolate and Vanilla
swirled with rainbow sprinkles.)

Dear Q.S.T.R.,

	Right on, man!  We dig!  8)  I love hearing stuff like this from 
the more experienced generation... we need a melding of the minds in 
order to take the best of the past with us into the future and avoid

	I hope you will come to parties, check out the scene, try Ecstasy 
if you haven't yet... and educate the kids you meet about your own 
experiences, if you feel they are worth sharing.
	When you're 14-30 it's not hard to be into raves, but I think it 
takes a truly exceptional older person to appreciate them -- someone who 
retains enough of their childlike wonder and passion & enthusiasm for living.

the "Shine on you raver, you seer of visions" made me smile.

this lyrick was written by Roger Waters, a co-founder of Pink Floyd,
  about the original founder of the band, Syd Barrett.
syd was about 20 years ahead of his time musically; in fact, most of
  the things he did were so far ahead that he was considered crazy;
    and in a self-fulfilling-prophesy type of thing, he DID go crazy,
      and was booted from the band in the early 70's....

anyway, i believe Syd to be still alive; he was last spotted (to the
  best of my knowledge) somewhere in london at an all-night party back
   in the mid-80's, at that time he was shaved bald...

Syd's GOTTA love the rave scene; finally the music has caught up with
  his mind; 
so, has anyone heard of his whereabouts?

Excellent show.  First time I stayed out until 7 am in a very long time.  
First time I saw bassbin tweakers in a very long time.  First time I 
ever saw a man working in his office (in the same space) during a party. 
Jon Williams played a fine set, Jonah blew me away, Derek has always 
known how to work the crowd, but Stacey Pullen stole the show.  His 
masterful skills combined with an obscure selection of very diverse 
experimental techno tracks revealed his experience and knowledge of the 
music.  If you didn't stick around after 5, you missed out.

Tonight, Juan Atkins (METROPLEX, MODEL 500) will make his first SF 
appearance at MAD (1600 Market st @ Franklin).  It will be $3 all night 
long.  The lineup for tonight will be 10:00 Jon Santos, 11:20 Juan 
Atkins, and 12:40 Joe Rice.

We recommend that you show up early if you don't like waiting in line :)

Criticism of the above:  This is making the assumption that all dj's are 
men.  They are not.  

me, wondering why the male presence in the music is stronger than the 
female presence, but not wanting to divide dj's into male and female.

Anyone care to comment about this?

Syd currently lives in a mental institution in England.  He recently
(couple years ago) released a CD, with the help of David Gilmour and Roger
Waters (!), called "The Madcap Laughs."  I HAD to buy it, and it is great!
Very silly and fun, with just a touch of sadness (my reaction to the whole
thing).  Y'all should check it out.

Someone sent me email about an (free) appearance at the Virgin Megastore
in the evening of the 15th.  It's supposed to involve some music but
I don't know if it will be a real performance.  The details I have are
on the web page - http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/sf/gencal.cgi.

It would seem possible that they're playing somewhere for real that night.

Well, the statement is also assuming that the dj is heterosexual as well, 
which not all dj's are.  But I found the list pretty amusing, none the

Hey all,

seeing as how this wonderful song "shine on you crazy diamond" is being 
discussed I was wondering if it was played outside at the FnF party in 
August?  I have this lousy memory and can't remember if I heard it or 
just wish I heard it since I think it would make a great ambient song.

What does everybody think?  Would you dig chilling out in the ambient 
room and hear "shine on" come slowly blending into the music?  It might 
catch you by surprise and you won't even realize what song it is for a 
while.  Though I know some people would pick it up right away.  Anyway 
I'm just now starting to learn about mixing and it seems to me like a 
great song to throw into an ambient set.

love chris

not neccessarily...

but I think you're reading way too much into that comment, especially
since the person that wrote it (charlie edwards) is probably one of the

I agree this tends to be the case, but if it bothers you why not go out 
and do something about it?

and speaking of dividing dj's into male and female, I just read about an
upcoming all female event in LA on socal-raves:

Does anybody have suggestions on good headphones for Dj's in the 60-100 
dollar price range?  Is it something to take seriously or does any high 
priced set work fine?  Thanks in advance.

Hey all,

The other day I was hanging with a friend who has an old Roland analog 
keyboard.  It was amazing what we could do with it.  We were just 
playing around and were able to take different notes and create all 
sorts of crazy trippy acid sounds.  The keyboard was $1400 new and the 
name was something like Juno 60 or 90.  I can't quite remember.  I am 
very interested in getting something like this but he said they don't 
make them anymore.  Everything is digital.

My questions are what capabilities do each offer/not offer, what do you 
recommend (analog or digital) and how hard and how expensive would it 
be to get an old high quality analog keyboard.

Any reply greatly appreciated.

Thanks!! 

chris

Hello again,

A couple of years ago I picked up Rising High records "Trance 
Injection" cd.  Dics 1 is a little bit techno-e for my tastes but Disc 
2 is great.  It has some excellent ambient-trance stuff on it.

My question is can I find any of the music from disc 2 on Record?  I'm 
particularly interested in Syzygy's "Discovery", NLSofE "voices of the 
rain forest", and Dreamfish "school of fish".  That whole disc on 
record would be even better.

Thanks in advance for any advice or info.

Well...this arguement just went thru the dj newsgroup...a lot of dj's seem 
to like the Sony MDR-V600...I think they are around $100 american.
I have a pair myself..best headphones Ive ever owned.
Nice sound...excellent bass...and the ear part actually wraps right over
your whole ear. In fact I even saw inside the ear piece..and the speaker
is even directed towards your inner ear..for better sound..as opposed to
straight at the side of your head.
The highest price ones dont always mean quality/sound/volume either.
Just go and try out a bunch.

Yes, do it!  The only time I ever spun, I mixed "Echoes" from the Pink
Floyd album "Meddle," and it sounded good to the listeners as well as to me
:)  I recall hearing a Doobie Brothers tune being mixed at my first party,
which was Jeremiah's party last September (anyone remember the E-tickets?).
It would be soooooo cool if more of this mixing of "familiar" music was
done, as long as it didn't get too cheesy...

I was not name-calling and that is exactly the way I *don't* want my comment 
to be construed.  I do not want a reactionary view taken to my 
request, so I will clarify before that happens:)  I don't want to get into 
feminist politics here!! :)  Rather, 
I've just noticed the high proportion of male dj's to female ones in the 
scene.  I was wondering why?  Also, the "comment" by charlie edwards
was poking fun of a stereotype.  It was good-natured and I enjoyed it.  
But, in each stereotype, lies a grain of truth (otherwise they wouldn't 
exist) and I was just commenting on this grain of truth.

It doesn't necessarily bother me.  And, I feel I do "do something about 
it" by supporting the dj's I enjoy, be them male or female.  I, 
personally, have no interest in becoming a dj.  But, I also have no idea 
how one becomes a dj, either.  I guess it takes personal interest.  I was 
just wondering why more men would be interested in it than women.
I was wondering why this phenomenon exists, and wanted to know if others 
had input into it.  I wasn't complaining, but rather was wondering if 
anyone wanted to partake in some "interactive" discussion by providing me 
with some personal thoughts and experiences.  That's it.  In general I 
have found the rave scene very open to breaking gender/racial/sexual 
orientation boundaries, and I appreciate that.   But, it is not perfect 
(as nothing is) and still has a few flaws in this area.

Thank you so much for this.  I appreciate this information, which is 
exactly the kind of stuff I had hoped people would provide! :)

I will now shut up.

.... not necessarily - two women could definitely refer to one another as
"spouse" - therefore being neither straight nor men (and two of my favorite
dj's, Tracy and Polywog are women)

(and by the way, any spouse who would destroy your turntables, regardless of
their feelings about your djing, deserves a second thought, don't you think?)

I liked the list too, always nice to have a chuckle in the morning --

         Reply to:   RE>Analog keyboard questions

>The keyboard was $1400 new and the name was something like Juno 60 or 90.

It was probably a Juno 60.  A really cool synth.  One thing to remember about
synthesizers is their value greatly depreciates with time.  Unless it is a
really sought after synth, like the 303.  You can pick up a Juno 60 for around
$300.  Other old analog synths I would recomend are:

Sequential Circuts Max
Oberhiem Matrix 6 (or Matrix 1000)
Anything by Roland - Juno 6 or 60 or Juno 106, Jupiter 6 or 8, JX8P


All can be had for around $300-400 except the Jupiter stuff which is quite a
bit more.  

I'm not sure where you live, but in San Jose there is a really cool store
called The Starving Musician.  They specialized in used gear and almost always
have a great selection of analog gear.

On the digital end, get a sampler.  I'm an E-mu Systems nut, so I'd recomend
the E-64 or EIV.  They're kinda expensive (E-64 $3995 retail, EIV $5995
retail) but well worth the money.  As far as synths, The E-mu Morpheus is the
coolest thing ever made for techno and ambient.  The filters are simply the
most amazing thing I've ever heard.  The factory prestets found in the
Morpheus do not do it justice.  When you get in and start creating your own
sounds is when you'll be blown away. 

Anyways, let me know if you have any more questions.  I love talkin about this
stuff!!!

Hey all,

The other day I was hanging with a friend who has an old Roland analog 
keyboard.  It was amazing what we could do with it.  We were just 
playing around and were able to take different notes and create all 
sorts of crazy trippy acid sounds.  The keyboard was $1400 new and the 
name was something like Juno 60 or 90.  I can't quite remember.  I am 
very interested in getting something like this but he said they don't 
make them anymore.  Everything is digital.

My questions are what capabilities do each offer/not offer, what do you 
recommend (analog or digital) and how hard and how expensive would it 
be to get an old high quality analog keyboard.

Any reply greatly appreciated.

Thanks!! 

chris

wow, 

i totally mean this in a good way, but, did you really not know
about the old analog keyboards? i'm really,really sorry if this
offends anybody. i suppose not everyone is a tech head but i just thought
a lot of ppl knew about what makes the music we listen to. i'm really 
glad you experienced such a fine piece of equipment and i hope
you get good responses about what it is/does.

my point is: i've been socialized by the rave scene and my friends
that only old skoolers who know everything are in the scene. that's
terrible! i'm a prejudiced raver!@#$


are you sure you all still want me to visit san fran with my preconceived
notions? just kidding. i'm still coming to see you all.

and to the person who posted and i just insulted....do you live
in san fran and if so, can i meet you so you can properly kick my ass?

yeah, 

i'd like to see a discussion on the limited gender diversity
in the djing profession at least as far as raves are concerned.

it appears pretty equal as far as ravers are concerned by why is the
talent so leaned towards males?  

is it considered too difficult or mentally restraining for females?
(whoa, super flamebait here!)

are turntables just an extension of the penis?

has anyone ever seen dj jackie christie from new york?
(doesn;t really pertain, i just think she's gorgeous and a good dj)



thanks again, see you all in two wks.

Amy, 
 
when I try to write any thing, I always go back over it to see how it
reads, and I would have changed the word wife to the word spouse to infer
either/or and to not risk insulting women like yourself (along with about
1/2 the rest of the readers in the world). Perhaps even the words "your
better half " could work as it doesn't infer sexual preference
either..........I guess it's all in the way the writer thinks as they put
the words to paper (or e-mail etc...) 
 
now I just caught myself writing "he" in the statement above (instead of
"the writer")..........I wonder if that was my male upbringing or the fact
that subconsiously, I believed the writer to be a male due to their use of
the word "wife"......interesting !!!

        Well #1 thing I have to mention was Stacey Pullen:AMAZING!!! best
Dj I ever saw! 2nd Derrick May ...was a pleasure to hear they both just
blew my head outta the water-Juan Adkins :gonna check it out tonite..see
what's up? I've heard a couple of derricks records but was never really
into them.But his and stacey's styles were definatley seemless....
        At first i thought the party was kinda vibeless,Jonah Sharp was
cool (as always)and I caught the end of Jon Williams set which was
cool..everything seemed to pick up tho when Derrick  May came on..The
dancefloor was definatley were the real vibe was..only one complaint and
that was the sound but nothing is perfect(well ALMOST nothing)..Anyways all
in all Great Party!!
        Does anybody know when Sunsets are gonna start again?Someone said
the end o March...Also I need another mixer..Anybody sellin a decent one?
        It's greAT to see alll o thease outta town DJs comin in but it
seems like the vibe is slippin anyone else feel that way?or am I just
gettin burnt out?

Well that's all for now...

I would like to add my $.02 worth and say that I am offering anyone who is
really serious about learning some dj skills and technics a chance to come
and watch and participate in trainspotting school. 
 
Now with all due respect to the masculine bunch.....I would like to
especially invite any Femanine types who feel that the male presence is too
dominant in the music/club/rave  scene etc....to do something about
it..........thats not to say however that I am only offering this to women
and not men, so ..........I would rather invite men and women (but hope
more women are interested) to help to balance out so we are coincide-ery
with the ying and the yang......and the balance of nature is equal..... 
 
In addition I have been toying with the idea of DJing in drag....so will
that help for now?.............moonpup   say no more

I would imagine that most of the stuff on the comp are available seperately.
If they didn't give catalog/label information for each artist, you can also
check out the Ambient and Techno archives at Hyperreal 
http://www.hyperreal.com for more info. I do happen to know that Dreamfish is
available on CD and LP in a reissue from Fax, but the vinyl is much harder to
find. I recently paid $25 for a somewhat messed up promo version, but it is
quite worth it to have a 12" sized version of the Dreamfish. Super cool!!

Maybe everyone should just use "she" and "her" when speaking/writing
generically, because genetically speaking, we all begin as afemale egg and
a male or female sperm, and there's been LOTS of discussion about every
person's female aspects...just some thoughts...and one more: I believe that
if a person is offended by something, that person is too uptight :)

Yes!!!!!!

Those parties were sooooo much fun!  Did you go to the one a couple of years
ago that was up in that office building?  That was a REALLY FUN PARTY!  I would
drive across the country to go to an E Ticket.  (Even though the last one was
crowded and really hot!)  That family vibe made it really cozy.  I passed out
Sesame Street necklaces at the last one.  Ring any bells?

BTW, Does Jeremiah have email?  I'd love to stay in touch with him.

warmly,

purchased mine for $99.95, but I've seen them advertised for $89.95 (I 
payan extra ten dollars for buying mine in Santa Cruz and not SJ).  I'm 
pretty sure they sell them at most chain electronic stores (Good Guy's, 
Circut City, etc)  The model up from these cost 129.95 and have smaller 
ear pieces but about the same sound range.  I say go for the Sony 
MRD-V600's, the bass will really blow you away.

It seems in our society today trust is a hard thing to earn and a good
friendship can't be built with out it.  I see "raving" as a way to met and
have a good time with a lot of people who have more of a potential of being
my friend than anyone I might meet in on the street (this all depends on
the party of course).

Very true. I find it hard to juggle a lot of friends that I know some-what
well than I do having a few good friends I trust and know well.

I have many friends I see at every party I go to and every once in a while
I will go out to breakfast with them the next day or even a non-rave event
with them. However they are not my best friends and most don't even live
near me (me being in Ebay - Pleasanton) so it is hard to keep up a good
freindship.  I also think that even at parties people still are reluctant
to take the first step and invite a potential good friend out to do
something non-rave related.
    At Plant Rock I met up with a few girls I had known for 6 months at
just now we exchanged phone numbers to go continue our friendship outside
of raving.  Relationships work in mysterious ways and they only happen
unless you want them to.

I personal have never met you or many other people on this list strictly
because I don't know what you look like not because I didn't want to.  All
of us on this list have similar interests in that we all like music,
dancing, and to gather on the weekends to party together.  In that you are
all similar to me and are my friends.

Check out the new OVT web page at http://www.mcs.net/~ovt/

OVT Visualz is a company specializing in atmospheric enhancement at raves
and live concerts.  We have been around for about 3 years now projecting
our art at over 60 raves so far in Chicago and the rest of the U.S.   We
typically utilize 2 or 3 video projectors and about 4-10 16mm projectors
(for film loops) per show to put the audience into a new virtual
biomechanical space, complete with rotating screens and hour upon hour of
fresh visuals.  We have also provided projections for such bands as
Ministry, My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, Legendary Pink Dots, EMF, Die
Warzau and Mercury Rev-to name a few.  We are now releasing a video
entitled Probe, a first in a series of mind bending videos for your viewing
pleasure.  Check out our web page at http://www.mcs.net/~ovt/

Probe is a video designed to stimulate the mind.  This program acts as a
seratonin releasing agent increasing mental awareness and feelings of
euphoria during and after viewing.  Some have even called Probe a new high
tech psychoactive drug.

Probe was produced using the latest neural implant technology.  As the test
subject listened to hardcore techno music (by Chicago's DJ EFEX) his mind
began producing images which were picked up by the neural receptor
implanted in his brain.  The high resolution images were subsequently
recorded on videotape after the brain waves were processed into a video
signal.

Probe has been seen around the country at various rave parties and mental
health clinics.  All who have seen Probe agree that is has affected them in
a positive way.  To see more about OVT Visualz and the Probe video, check
out the web site at http://www.mcs.net/~ovt/

I just wanted to introduce myself to the list.  My name is Voltaire, and

were all about (please pardon the underlying neophyte theme of this post, I
just wanted to check this list out).  I've heard they're fun, even kinda
spiritual, so I'm hoping I'll get some time to check one out soon.  Are
there any DJs or parties I should keep an eye out for in particular?  Welp,

Planet Rock Review
--------------------

Well,  this weekend,  I'm FINALLY getting back into the Rave of 
things...    IE:   Getting out more often...

Friday,  the Frequency-8 thing got busted,  but WOW what a really 
cool warehouse.  It's too bad that an asshole complained about the 
noise that brought the police to shut it down in the middle of Ethan's 
set.

So,  to make up for it,  I also went out to Planet Rock,  thanks to the 
promoters generosity who got me on the guest list,  and WOW,  what 
a rave it was.

It was at the Home base location,  a huge warehouse behind the 
Home Base Home improvement center,  probably one of the best 
venues in the bay area.   It appears that more and more parties 
might be held there in the future,  as long as people will respect the 
venue and not "Tag" it.

   Saturday, March 2nd - _Planet Rock Strikes Back_
   Trance, Terry Mullen, Nigel Richards, Hipp-E, Karizma, Jim Hopkins,
   Graeme, Surge, Das, Abstract, Cesar, Radley.
   E.B.E. Visuals.
   415.267.3916 510.433.7216

This time,  no hardcore was on the bill,  but early on,  I was told a 
Gabber set was going to happen in the main room,  but after 
repeated visits,  I don't think that happened.

The main room was mostly house,  but I spent more time in the 
smaller room,  groovin to some awesome trance from some DJ's I 
haven't heard before.   The music was OK,   but the DJ sometimes let 
the beats stop for brief periods that gave me opportunities to go to 
the main room.   In the main room,   really funky house was spinning 
my brains around my head.   I had already pulled an allnighter on 
Friday evening,  and didn't sleep at all on Saturday,  and stayed 
awake all night Saturday as well.   Ahhh!!  Such a wonderful feeling 
to be able to pull two all-nighters in a row.

Shortly after 6 AM,  the smaller room shut down,  but the big room 
was still going strong.   By that time,  the fact that I had not eaten 
dinner the night before,  started to take its toll on me,  but I 
managed to pull through to the end,  and headed out for a bite to eat 
and headed back home on BART.  Good advice,  if you plan on pulling 
two allnighters in a row,   eat a good meal the 2nd night...

The venue was KILLER,  the visuals were also really good.

Overall score (1-10 scale):

Venue = 9  (No other venue has ever scored this high)
Visuals = 8 (Excellent video/ lasers)
Music = 7 (Not as varied as last Planet rock)
Sound = 8 (Kinda loud,  but clean sound)
Vibe = 8 (High percentage of SFRavers)

So,  really high scores on this one....  So,  if you call the info line 
from 
future parties and learn it's behind Home base,   you will know that 
the venue is LARGE (But entrance cost would be $20 - due to the 
high cost of the venue).

Subject: Lack of Female DJ's
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hi, everybody!  I have been "eavesdropping" on this list for a while, and
have been very excited to find a forum to discuss experiences and issues of
the scene.  Now that I have e-mail, I can finally participate!

I have also noticed and pondered the disproportion of male to female
d.j.'s, and would like to add some thoughts to the discussion.  I think the
lack of parity stems from a complex sociological phenomenon, which carries
into the (otherwise radiantly equitable!) rave scene.

Note: I am talking very generally here!

Women, to simplify things greatly, are socialized to be passive.  We are
not as actively encouraged as males to be ambitious, succeed, or to go out
on a limb.  We receive very different messages from society about our
abilities and appropriate aspirations.  Effects of this socialization are
obvious, from women's goals for themselves, reticence to assert themselves,
and common beliefs about women's capabilties.

Internalization of these messages makes them appear natural, and leads us
to questions on this list like, "is it that women don't like the music?",
rather than looking at the underlying phenomena.  *Why* wouldn't a woman
who loved the music and the scene pursue dj'ing when a raver just like her
(but male) *would* be willing to try?

Not only does female socialization make the jump from enjoyer of music
(passive) to technician of music (active) difficult, but any woman who does
step forward is then put in the position of representing her entire gender!
Hence the term, "girl dj."  That creates the famous double-bind for women
of having to excel, not just attempt - otherwise her effort is written-off
as a mark against her gender, proof that a "girl" couldn't do it.

Sexism may also possibly manifest itself with promoters (subconsciously?)
not wanting to book female dj's (for fear that the name will not be as big
a draw).  You will also find less women as party organizers, circle dance
competitors (leaving aside that debate for now), and contributers on this
list!

I hope this doesn't sound like I'm accusing anyone of overt sexism, or
excusing women from pursuing greater goals.  I simply believe that the
disparity between male and female dj's is not natural (i.e. men are more
musicallytalented, etc.), but must be caused by some sociological process.

Any thoughts on this?  I'm a little wary now of sending this post, because
I've seen how opinions expressed cause misunderstandings sometimes, and can
lead to excessive overanalyzing.  I send this in the spirit of sharing our
hopes and concerns about everything in our scene, to make it better and
more meaningful for all.

Part of the problem, from what I've observed, seems to me to be the 
attitudes of some people towards female dj's, in some cases.  I was at 
a party once where there was a female dj doin her thing (& doing just 
fine, of course), when I overheard a guy next to me say something along 
the lines of "Boy, if women can't mix, they shouldn't even fucking 
bother trying".  I can see where, if I were a female dj, I would find 
this a rather daunting attitude to have to combat, an attitude from 
what I've seen is entirely absent in regards to male djs.  Even in the 
rave scene, this attitude can be found.  Obviously this is not the 
normal case, I know plenty of guys who really would like to see more 
female djs, but I could still see where knowing that this attitude 
existed could make things just that more difficult to deal with.  I 
myself would like to hear more female dj's, I heard a pretty killer one 
at Packa-Bowl, altho I can't remember her name now.  Anyway, just my 
observations on that aspect.

Does anyone know where to get any Barry Weaver tapes. I know that these
things are hard to get since he doesn't come out with tapes that often and
he doesn't like to record his sets.  Any info will be appreciated!

I've been going to raves and helping put them on (the New Moon, Friends 
and Family) for about three years now, and I've often been bugged by the 
lack of female involvement in the production and artistic aspects of the 
scene.

Lots of women go to raves, of course, but often women get put off from 
getting deeper into the scene by what I call the Smurf syndrome.

Smurfs, as you know, are adorable little blue creatures that live 
together in a little Smurf village.  There are lots of Smurfs, but they 
are all male except for Smurfette.  Sometimes when I'm at a party, I'll 
look around and notice that I'm one of maybe two or three women present 
in a crowd of guys.  That's the Smurfette syndrome.

Don't get me wrong- I love my raver brothers- but I always like it better 
when there's also lots of women around, too.

I got into throwing parties when a couple of female friends- Mona Love 
and Heather- showed me that women can accomplish a lot even when their 
men friends don't take them very seriously.

But the men I truly respect..and there are a lot 
of them!..don't have this attitude at all and have made a serious effort 
to include women as much as possible.  Many times men have said to me:  
there must be at least one woman dj at every party!

For a party to go off you need male and female energy working together.  
I've been lucky enough to get to know some really strong women in the 
scene, and they are a big inspiration to me.  They make me feel proud of 
being female and they give me the strength to face down a lot of the 
sexist crap I encounter in my day-to-day life.  

For a community to flourish it needs lots of different people to 
contribute their own personal vibe.  Raves need just as many strong 
females as males so that we can keep this wonderful thing going as long 
as possible!

Here's a list of all the females I know of that play records:

DRC, Clair, Tracy, Pollywog, Kelli, Laura, Bonny    

Can anybody add more names to this list?

Much respect,

Ann

On the topic of women ravers:

I'm really glad that Nancy brought this up, because she expressed a lot 
of the things I've been thinking about but hadn't thought of a way to say 
exactly.  I liked the points she made about how women are socialized to 
be passive and how they are expected not to do much except dance and enjoy.

But I guess you've all noticed that as time passes, there
there have been more and more women getting involved in the
production aspect of parties. Since we are on the topic of socializtion,
it seems like a good idea to raise the point that one aspect of female
socialization islearning how to create pleasant environments for people. 
The whole concept of House is a big deal in the rave scene.  And women 
get taught from girlhood how to "make house," that is, how to 
make a beautiful place for people to congregate.

Although music is key, I feel that the most creative part of throwing
raves is creating the House out of whatever space you've got.  After
three years of helping throw  parties, I've found that the music is good when
the House is good, and the music will suck when the venue is not good.
I've heard the same dj's play awesome sets when they were in a good
environment and then play uninspired sets when the environment was a drag.

Women are discovering that they can express themselves by creating the
House.  But I would like to see more women dj's, because I'm afraid that
the rave scene is lamely transposing the traditional male/female roles into
our own unique subculture.

One thing I worry about a lot is that we are repeating the same old
pattern that I've read about in _Women of the Left Bank_ by Shari
Benstock.  One part of this book describes how women-run publishing 
companies bent over backwards to publish men's writing and received
very little credit or money for their efforts. They did it anyway because
they believed in the art they were bringing to life by helping it
get to print. They knew good art when they saw it and put up with a lot 
of misogynist crap from the men they were supporting. 

I worry that most of the producers of techno/house/ambient/trip hop music 
are MEN.  Their music  will be recognized as visionary, which it
is, and will be remembered with respect fifty years from now, but I worry 
that the mileu that the women have had a lot to do with creating and which 
has made this music possible will end up as an amusing historical footnote.  
And that their contribution will be seen as an accessory to the really 
important stuff- the music- that is a male-dominated field at the moment.

Record producers by and large start out as djs. If women don't start
spinning records in larger numbers, then most of the music will be made
by men.  A situation that I would like to see get balanced out by more
women getting into spinning records.

Thanks for bringing all this up, Nancy.  I hope to see you out some time 
soon!

-Ann

I think BPM often has Barry's tapes.  I see Barry pretty often and I'll

I definitely did not mean to leave Alex out in my posting last week
about MAD.  As I told him last Monday, if it hadn't been for finding
a couple of Detroit house tracks at Gaia Mantra, I wouldn't have
gotten motivated for going on two trips to Detroit and moving my
musical attention in that direction in such a strong way, ending up
with my set at MAD last Monday.  So this is definitely a pubilc
thank-you to Alex not only for that but for his continued positive
presence in Da Scene :)

Did you know:

1. A full moon is considered lucky on Monday, Moon Day
2. Only one month has ever elapsed without a full moon, February 1866, an
event that will not repeat itself for 2.5 million years
3. Ancient Greeks thought marriages consummated during a full moon would
be prosperous and happy
4. In England, a distinction was once made between lunacy and
insanity;the former happened only during a full moon, while the latter
was permanent
5. Many Navajos believe that a woman is more likely to give birth during
a full moon because of its pull on the amniotic fluid
6. Doctors who note increased bleeding in patients tonight may well
attribute it to the moon, a correlation confirmed by some studies

Well now you do!!!

Happiest of Full Moons *

Thank you so much to Nancy and Ann for providing some thought provoking 
discussion about the lack of female dj's.  I've felt everything that both 
of them said, but could not have put it so eloquently.  Andy sent me a 
URL for a levi web page that is about female dj's inlcuding Charlotte, 
DRC, and Emma.  It is a neat page and gives a lot of support to these 
dj's while letting them tell what it has been like getting where they 
are.  If anyone would like to check it out, the URL is below:

http://www.levi.com/fly-zone/vol1/iss2/index

Women often have to overcome much more of a mountain in order to do many 
things that are typically male dominated because of a lack of a support 
network.  You can call this the "old boys' network" if you want.  Men in 
this network support their own.  Often, I don't necessarily think it is 
malicious, but rather they support ppl who are just like them.  For 
example, in the interview I read about Charlotte she said while growing 
up in the dance scene in Chicago, there were many ppl who aspired to be 
dj's, mostly men.  If a younger brother had an older brother who was a 
dj, and the younger brother wanted to be a dj, the older brother and all 
of his friends took him under their wing.  With girls this didn't happen 
because girls were just supposed to be "girls."  Therefore, many times 
women don't really have an "initiation" into the scene where they receive 
a lot of support and a network to go along with it.

I think that our scene is a step ahead of much of the rest of society.  I 
have seldom felt like an "object" when I go to parties, something that I 
appreciate more than anything.  I have met very wonderful, open-minded 
ppl that truly care about equality and individuality and have felt like 
an active, validated participant in the whole process.  However, like Ann 
said, she is worried that there is a segment of our scene that is 
beginning to represent the rest of society.  I agree, but am glad that a 
discussion like this has occured so that we may be able to remedy the 
part that each individual person has control over, themselves.  I am 
referring to the knowledge that we can each do our part and learn, and 
help others.  I thank ppl like moonpup who took an active part with his 
offer of helping others learn how to dj.  This is what I mean by helping 
others.

Thank you for letting me say what I felt :)

kirsten

P.S  A big welcome to nancy.  i've known her for quite awhile now.  she 
is very enthusiastic about the scene and i love talking to her about it.  
i know she's wanted to be a part of this list for ahwile, so i am glad 
she finally made it.  a big virtual *hug*, nancy!!

If you were to look within the corporate structure just fifty years ago,
you would find hardly even one female in the executive branch of that
structure. Likewise, you would not see a male secretary or receptionist.
Just eighty years ago, a female sole-breadwinner (married) was extremely
atypical, and a male homemaker was absolutely uneard of.

However, over time, and with a good amount of resistance (as Nancy noted
earlier), society has reexamined those roles defined as being 'male' or
'female'.

I see dj'ing as no different from the rest of all of these predefined
roles. The beginning of any endeavor whose role is defined as the
'opposite' sex can be very trying for either side. Partially because when
one is entering a new 'era' they often have no role models from which to
emulate. And partially out of the fear that their masculinity of femininity
would be questioned, and, as Shawna mentioned, that the gender difference
within that role can be resisted by others.

One example is Star Trek Voyager. Here you have a woman in a position of
authority. In a role that has been traditionally defined as 'male', this
woman had to find a way to play that role, and still keep her femininity
intact. Thus, she had to have the strength and courage to become a role
model for Women of Authority. In today's society, she is a pioneer,
venturing into uncharted territory, and paving the way for other women...
and I suppose even becoming a 'catalyst' for eradicating those definitions
for the roles traditionally defined as 'male' or 'female'.

And so the same can be said for the female dj's on the scene today...

They deserve the applause.... for their courage into venturing into
'uncharted' territory, paving the way for other inspiring female dj's.

But it's not just that. I think Nancy was very correct about the specific
motivations of men and women having an affect on the numbers...

Generally, men place a large stake of their self-esteem on their business
prowess, their ability to win bread, and their career. They have intense
motivation for something that will lead to physical sexual gratification.

Generally, women place a large stake of their self-esteem, and identify
themselves through their relationships with people. They have intense
motivation for something that will lead to love and connection.

This being the case, dj'ing would not be worth the effort for the general
population of females, even if their desire was fairly good strength.
Although they may be receiving the satisfaction of: loving what they do,
creating an excellent vibe, connecting with the people on the dance floor,
love of the music, etc., their underlying motivations (as females in
general) can go unsatisfied. The cost of the equipment, the time to
practice and keep up on the technology and music, etc. would not produce
enough return for their investment for most women.

Men on the other hand not only receive the satisfaction from the process,
their deep underlying motivations (as men in general) become satisfied as
well. This being the case, the chances of an adequate return for their
investment is greatly increased.

So long as the disparity of 'male' and 'female' roles can be observed in
the rest of society, thiat same disparity will also be a mere 'fact of
life' within the entire guild of dj's.

Men and women not only have different motivations, they are 'wired'
differently in their brains. The mental and emotional sides of their brains
work together, wheras in men, the two sides are split, and very often men
have a much more difficult time trying to identify their feelings. They
usually have the capacity to work on only one aspect at a time... analyze,
or emotionalize. Women generally have the ability to do both at once.

My point is that if men and women want to work toward an 'equal role'
society, they not only have to overcome sociological and psychological
bounds, but biological bounds as well. This I do not forsee happening in a
long time to come... but it is nice to observe people with the courage to
try and break those bounds.

Peace.

Not to trivialize any of this discussion, or to deny that there are unique
features to the situation of women in the rave scene, but I think the
principal reasons for the lack of female DJs are exactly the same as for
the lack of female blues guitarists, or lawyers, or bricklayers.  Namely
the long history of socialization, cultural conditioning, blah blah,
restricting women to not necessarily passive but *private* (ie
domestic--familial and social) roles.  This is why women are historically
and currently underrepresented in all but an exceptional handful of
professions--most professional undertakings are necessarily public
enterprises in non-domestic environments.

Regular use will drain your adrenal glands (coffee does this, too). 
Regular abuse may mess with your central nervous system, and make you a 
little jittery.  Be moderate and infrequent (e.g. weekends) in your usage, 
and perhaps complement your intake with adrenal replenishing foods and 
supplements (e.g. tyrosine).  Rest assured, the adrenals are constantly 
getting replenished, but it may take a while for your body to catch up, 
time during which you may feel somewhat lethargic. Speak with a doctor or 
health food store personnel for further advice.  Because I don't personally 
use MIni Thins, I wouldn't know how excessive 6 of them are in the 
course of one evening.  -Rok.  

ps. If you have any known heart condition, you should stay away from 
stimulants in general.

I have some mixed feelings about the discussions on women dj's (and please
understand I've fought for feminist issues all of my life) -- but it seems to
me, we're not really evolved until it totally doesn't matter if you're male,
female, straight, gay, transexual, black, white, martian - the music is what
matters.  

Of course, if there are situations or preconceived notions that keep people from
spinning who want to, we need to fix that... so if you're a promoter or dj, and
you think you're excluding people based on habits, old ideas, whatever, try to
change that...  like moonpup offering to share his knowledge, which I hope some
interested people take him up on...

But when I hear about an "all-woman" line-up, I have to cringe a little -- not
that there aren't amazing women who spin, but because separation doesn't feel
like the answer -- and reverse discrimination is still discrimination based on
factors other than what's really central, which for us is the music.

Now, if an all-woman lineup was just how it turned out to be, that would be
different .... 

The perfect party? The dj's are half men, half women, mixed races and sexual
preferences -- and you **never even notice it**, because the music rocks!
That's the party I want to go to!

maybe the whole idea that there are many people out there wondering "why

females away from the whole thing.  Who wants to be a beginner and have

        Good observation :) Coincidentally, there are two parties coming up
on the East Coast with All-female DJ lineups ("BITCH'N" and "Feminine
Melody,).
        There ARE a lot of female DJs out there (often i don't think of
them as female though, just djs!)..here's a few of my faves:
        Stroboscopic (New York), Heather Heart (Brooklyn), Miss DJAX (Holland)

        and those are only the ones that play REAL HARD :) there's also a
couple high-rankin' junglists like DJ Rap, Kemistry and Storm and others.
There is a list around, somewhere, of Female Djs and you'd be suprised at
how many there are, and the fact that they play all styles of music and
cannot simply be classified as a 'female dj' by musical taste.
        There is also (last i heard) a WIR (Women In Raves) listserv going
on, i could get the info on it if anyone is interested (i can't get on it
because i am chromosonally challenged :).
        Peace,

Howdy do everyone!

I just heard a really cool rumor through the grapevine.  Sunsets are 
coming soon.  This rumor comes from someone not connected with Pacific 
so please realize that this could be completely false.  Anyway possibly 
near the end of March we may see the return of our favorite weekly.  

I hope so! 

love chris

Dear Tim,

	I don't know if you're reading this, but I can assure you your 
feelings of not being heard are misplaced.  Ninety-plus percent of the 
posts I read and appreciate I never respond to -- I don't have time, and 
it would simply add to the total volume and increase the number of those 
who *do* simply delete most messages unread.
	Imagine yourself as a journalist whose articles are printed in 
the newspaper.  If no one writes letters to the editor mentioning your 
stuff do you assume it's not being read?
	A wise person once said that in relationships it is of great 
importance to ask for what you need.  That applies to SFRAVES as well, in 
my opinion.  If you want feedback and attention, just ask for it, and you 
shall in all likelihood receive!  (I base this on the fact that any 
number of people have asked for good cheer to be sent to themselves or a 
friend who was feeling down and then posted later to thank everyone for 
the tremendous response.)
	So if you feel you have something to contribute to our discussion 
Tim, chances are others feel the same way and will miss your contribution.

Much love,
			<<< Starchild >>>

Subject: Lack of Female DJ's
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


The lack of  female DJ's is probably caused by a very simple factor- our
very sexist sociey.  Now, many will argue that the rave scene is immune to
the ills of the mainstream society, but this is far from being true.  Next
time you go to rave, look around ya. Therefore, we have to change the way
we treat our children.  It has to start early, probably in kindergarten
when boys are encouraged to be more aggressive and physical , whereas girls
rarely receive the same kind of attention.  If we start them young, maybe
then and only then girls and boys will be on the same par.

Later,

Matt

I am extremely glad that this topic got started.  I just read the two 
messages from Leslie and Anarch.  Lack of female dj's is, of course, caused 
by the same reasons that cause a lack of womens' presence in all walks of 
life.  This would be the patriarchial society that we live in.  I think, 
however, that through discussion and information we can remedy it.  Like 
Leslie, i wish we could go to parties and not have to even think about 
gender/race/sexual orientation etc. etc.  In large part I think the rave 
scene is special in that way; it welcomes ppl from all backgrounds.  
However, it still has its problems and in order to overcome them we must 
admit they exist.  That's why I am enthralled that this discussion has 
taken place.

I would like to add one more task that women face in becoming a dj.  I 
would call this simple networking, but you could call it the "old boys' 
network" if you really wanted to.  If a boy is interested in becoming a 
dj and he has an older brother who is already one or has older friends, 
they will immediately take the kid under their wing.  Girls don't always 
have this support network and encouragement (I feel) and therefore the 
process becomes more daunting.  Andy provided me with a really cool URL 
that focuses on women dj's including DRC, Emma, and Charlotte.  If anyone 
is interested here it is.  It has interviews by the women and some of 
their experiences dj'ing.  There is a difference between their 
experiences and mens', so if you're interested I'd check it out.

maybe there's something about djing that appeals more to guys... in the
same way most rock bands are made up of guys... Maybe getting up and
entertaining a crowd of people is more of a "guy" thing... I'll bet there's
an evolutionary explanation... :)

It is a pill that you can buy at 7/11 or circle K or AM/PM or what ever.
It's like speed.  They come in little packages of about 8 for a couple
dollars or so.  It makes you all tingly and gives you energy.  You can feel
the hair on your head through your scalp when you're on um.  They suck as
far as I am concerned.  They raise your heart rate way up as well so I think
they are kind of dangerous.  Some of you may remember the amusing (not so
much at the time) story I posted a few months ago regarding these little
jems.  Be careful.

Ephedrine, aka adrenaline.  They are potent little buggers that 
are legally sold over the counter to help asthma patients.  Of 
course, somebody figured that others might want it and started 
"marketing" them over the counter, at gas stations, in bright 
purple, peppy, packages... in small quantities.

If you saw that last post on the survey of ecstacy contents 
bought in the uk, a lot of them had ephedrine in them.

I think PC has gone too far when you can't trust yourself to write
something coherent and you can't trust others not to assume that you're a
chauvinist male pig.

"why do words like 'love' and actions of affection
 get taken as a threat or promise of devotion
 instead of just accepted for the beauty that they have ?
 when you tell someone that you love them
 they act like you're taking away all their freedom
 but it's giving, it's not taking away.

 love and friendship don't restrict and bind
 those chains are only in your mind
 it doesn't have to be that way.

 people act like it's something to be ashamed of
 to lock away or hide behind closed doors
 this kind of secrecy only breeds social scheming,
 gossip, lies, and misunderstanding
 it doesn't seem that appealing to me.

 why do words like 'love' and actions of affection
 get taken as a threat or promise of devotion
 instead of just accepted for the beauty that they have ?
 why bleed all the meaning out of emotions
 with all kinds of weird connotations ?
 words will fuck us up enough by themselves."

 - Aaron "ravers make me want to vomit" Cometbus

I've come to accept the fact that my conversationall ablities are pretty 
much shot whenever I go out nowadays. On a good night I may be able to 
point & grunt (("Sloth...Chunk....friends!..")) beyond that I'm pretty 
much your typical acid casuality, which suits me just fine.

I think there are too many conditional relationships as it is in this 
world. Relationships like, "We're only gonna be friends so long as you 
keep giving me oral sex and you don't get fat." or "We're only gonna be 
friends so long as we have plesant conversations and agree with one 
another." or "We're only gonna be friends so long as we go to school 
together and see each other on a regular basis."

I've been working on my unconditional relationships lately. Relationships 
where I don't feel like I'm obligated to entertain my friends or even 
make that much sense. We check up on each other, make sure we're alive, 
dub tapes for each other, keep each other high. It's casual like that.

An unconditional relationship doesn't mean I'm gonna give you a hug 
tonight and expect you to treat me like your New Best Friend tomorrow. An 
unconditional relationship mean that if somebody means something to you, 
if they inspire you or make you feel special, then tell them, or show 
them, or give them a tape or a name  or whatever you think is appropriate...
...and then go on with your life.

It used to be that a guy could carry a torch or admire a girl from afar 
and that was considered sweet. Now you're a dick. Now everybody's a fucking 
stalker, everybody that is except for Sting because he's *English* and 
they can do no wrong. Even so, i try not to let the British bring me down.

"go where you think you want to go
 do everything you were sent here for
 fire at will if you here that call
 touch your hand to the wall at night"

Be honest in your intentions and actions, have faith in yourself and 
trust your instincts. Life does pay off.

I really liked that Chrysalis flyer.

Hi kids....
I have a few questions...since this is a forum for ravers...and partiers
and such...is it also the forum to discuss such things that sooooooooo
many involve in their individual experiences?
I thought I saw a string for quite a while..slamming some innocent person
(of course) for discussing it...but Im gonna try anyway.

Has anyone here had liquid-herbal Extasy? (sp)
Some friends say a friend has concocted some..and it is exxxxxxxxtremely
good. Ive tried that herbal stuff..got kinda tingly...nice buzz in tandem
with the real thing..but anyway...I only heard of liquid stuff today.

Ok..so...if I wasnt allowed to discuss this here..please dont flame
me...just say so. Dont be rude...I am not saying we all do this or
that...and Im labelling ravers as drugusers...Ive been playing music at
parties since 90..so I DO know my shit.
You could mail me personally if you want...I want to know about this
stuff, thats all. Dont start a huuuuuuuuuge thread goin off about
discussing this here...blah.blah.blah

Thanx in advance...c ya soon :)

Watch out, son!  Herbal e can be very hazardous to your health.  The San
Jose Mercury News had an article about people who had problems with some of
their internal organs after taking the stuff.  Wait a minute; come to think
of it, those UK articles were saying the same thing about the people who
died recently, didn't they?  Oh, well...maybe it's all propaganda.  My
feeling is, go for the real deal or don't go at all.

According to a magazine I remember reading (name of which I forgot) If you
don't have asthma, don't take mini-thin due to that you can very well
develope asthma, if you take them for a long period of time. About herbal E
I got some just to see what it was all about. Well for 2 days after taking
them (I read the label and took suggested dose) every once in a while when I
took a sh%t there was blood in it. That scared the hell out of me. So the
article in the paper have some truth to them about missing up your internal
organs. It didn't happen because I took too much, I followed the directions
on the label. So please take these little tibits of advice and stay away from
them. I'm not saying this could happen to everyone who takes either one of
those things, but just be careful. Just because you read the directions and
follow them to the letter, doesn't mean you can't experince problems or
harmfull side effects.

Hey all,
     
seeing as how this wonderful song "shine on you crazy diamond" is being 
discussed I was wondering if it was played outside at the FnF party in 
August?  I have this lousy memory and can't remember if I heard it or 
just wish I heard it since I think it would make a great ambient song.
     
What does everybody think?  Would you dig chilling out in the ambient 
room and hear "shine on" come slowly blending into the music?  It might 
catch you by surprise and you won't even realize what song it is for a 
while.  Though I know some people would pick it up right away.  Anyway 
I'm just now starting to learn about mixing and it seems to me like a 
great song to throw into an ambient set.

     As ads tout herbal pills promising euphoria, FDA probes reports of bad
     reactions, deaths
     
     BYLINE: By Dolores Kong, Globe Staff
     
     BODY:
         Herbal Ecstacy, X Tablets, Cloud 9.
     
        These sinful-sounding dietary supplements - promising to give 
     "natural
     euphoric pleasures," to "electrify your senses" or to make you 
     "X-perience a
     higher level" - have been creating a buzz in the Boston area.
     
        Young adults at raves, the late-night dances set to a heavy 
     electronic
     rhythm, and even middle-school students are hearing about the 
     supplements, which
     are sold primarily by mail order. They are being marketed as 
     alternatives to the
     illegal designer drug known as Ecstasy, but those who tried both say 
     there is no
     comparison.
     
        Boston-area nutrition stores, smoke shops and condom boutiques have 
     fielded
     scores of requests, particularly for the aggressively marketed version 
     called
     Herbal Ecstacy.  
     
        But the supplements have also attracted the attention of the US 
     Food and Drug
     Administration, because of reported deaths, heart attacks, strokes and 
     other
     reactions among users of all kinds of pills containing the Chinese 
     herb known as
     Ma huang.
     
        The FDA's food advisory committee will meet Feb. 28 to consider 
     possible
     labelling requirements, dosage limits and consumer warnings for the 
     supplements.
     
        "We have well over 300 reported adverse reactions" with at least 12 
     deaths
     linked to certain Ma huang-containing supplements, particularly one 
     weight-loss
     and energy pill whose formula has since been changed, said Brad Stone, 
     FDA
     spokesman. "We do have concerns about Ma huang."
        But Stone added that the FDA has no authority over claims made by 
     makers of
     some of the "natural alternatives" to the illegal Ecstasy. "If you say 
     something
     will make you feel euphoric, that's not the type of classic drug claim 
     that we
     can regulate," he said. Only if a product claims to cure cancer, for 
     instance,
     can the FDA require evidence of safety and effectiveness.
        For thousands of years, some cultures have used plants and herbs 
     believed to
     have healing properties or to alter consciousness. Ma huang is one of 
     the oldest
     herbs used in Chinese medicine, according to literature provided by 
     the Herb
     Research Foundation in Boulder, Colo., and has been used to treat 
     asthma,
     clear blocked sinuses and increase alertness and perception. Side 
     effects, such
     as driving up blood pressure, have also been long known.
        Ma huang naturally contains an amphetamine-like stimulant called 
     ephedrine.
     Lab-made ephedrine can also be found in over-the-counter medications 
     and diet
     pills. To prevent the diversion of ephedrine for the illegal 
     manufacture of
     methamphetamine, the US Drug Enforcement Administration last year 
     began
     requiring products with even small amounts of synthetic ephedrine to 
     register
     with the agency, but the requirement does not extend to Ma huang 
     products.
        Concerned by marketing that focuses on providing a "natural high" 
     and by the
     reports of adverse reactions, some dietary-supplement makers and New 
     Agers have
     distanced themselves from products like Herbal Ecstacy, although they 
     staved off
     attempts last year to ban Ma huang, also known as ephedra.
      The National Nutritional Foods Association, an industry liaison to 
     the FDA
     advisory committee, favors labelling regulations that would stop 
     "fringe
     suppliers of Ma huang products who unabashedly merchandise 
     high-potency products
     as if they were 'safe, all-natural alternatives' to hallucinogenic 
     drugs,"
     according to a recent association newsletter.
        An ad hoc committee of herbalists and dietary-supplement 
     representatives
     submitted scientific testimony to the FDA last year in support of the 
     safety of
     Ma huang, but does not object to stricter labelling requirements, said 
     William
     Appler, a member of the committee and an industry consultant. Appler 
     also said
     some reports of adverse reactions to Ma huang are unsubstantiated.
        The negative reports don't appear to affect sales. Manufacturers of 
     Ecstasy
     alternatives say millions of packets have sold worldwide, at prices 
     ranging from
     $ 19.85 for a packet of 20 X Tablets to $ 32.99 for a packet of 10 
     Herbal
     Ecstacy pills. Psychedelic and suggestive ads for the products have 
     appeared on
     TV, as well as in the Boston Phoenix, and in music and herbal 
     magazines and the
     drug-oriented journal High Times.
        Spokesmen said they have gotten few, if any, reports of adverse 
     reactions
     from consumers who used their products properly.
        Many of the complaints to the FDA have involved a weight loss and 
     energy
     pill, called Nature's Nutrition Formula One, which also contained kola 
     nut. The
     FDA said the combination of ephedrine and the caffeine in the kola nut 
     can cause
     heart attacks and other life-threatening problems, and a year ago 
     warned
     consumers against buying the product. The firm that makes Formula One 
     has since
     removed the kola nut.
        Some adverse reactions to Herbal Ecstacy have also been reported, 
     notably
     during a Lollapalooza concert in Austin, Tex., last summer. Herbal 
     Ecstacy
     contains not only Tibetian Ephedra sinica, a form of Ma huang, but 
     also a
     caffeine-containing herb, according to a product label. (Some similar 
     products,
     such as Cloud 9, do not contain caffeine, although they list 
     ingredients in
     addition to Ma huang.)
        "People were having palpitations and some fainting from this pill 
     they were
     selling down at a booth, and it was Herbal Ecstacy," said Gary Coody, 
     a
     pharmacist with the Texas Health Department's division of drugs and 
     medical
     devices. "It was consistent with the effects of ephedrine - 
     palpitations,
     headache, shortness of breath - and there were numerous people 
     experiencing
     that. Of course, there was no way to tell what people combined it 
     with."
        Coody said Texas health officials tested a recommended dosage of 
     the product
     - five to 10 of the blue pills, which bear a raised "e" on one side 
     and
     butterfly on the other - and found the ephedrine content to be between 
     50 and
     100 grams, or up to four times the ephedrine contained in a 
     recommended dose of
     an over-the-counter asthma medication.
        Robert Kessler, executive vice president for Global World Media 
     Corporation,
     which says it has sold more than 10 million packets of Herbal Ecstacy, 
     disputes
     Coody's contention.
        "We found no evidence that this happened," said Kessler. He said a 
     Global
     employee who was on the Lollapalooza tour immediately went to the 
     medical tents
     after hearing reports of people being treated for adverse reactions to 
     the pills
     and found no problem.
        "Obviously, it's something we'd be very concerned about," Kessler 
     said. "At
     concerts in general, there's a lot of illegal drug use that goes on. I 
     would
     imagine it's not impossible that people could be using illegal drugs 
     and if they
     got caught or were running into a problem, it's easier for them to 
     point to us,
     and not to the marijuana, the beer or the LSD they might have taken."
        Kessler said his company takes no responsibility for people who 
     fail to
     follow product instructions. But asked last week about the conflicting
     information that came with one sample of the product, he could not 
     give the
     correct recommended dosage. The label on the 10-pack of pills cautions 
     against
     taking more than one tablet in 72 hours, but an accompanying brochure 
     recommends
     a dose of three to five tablets, and no more than 10 pills in 24 
     hours. Kessler
     attributed the conflicting information to the firm's attempts to 
     respond to
     recent FDA concerns by changing the labelling.
        In the meanwhile, some substance abuse counsellors worry that 
     adolescents may
     confuse the legally available products with the illegal Ecstasy.
        "It's hard to tell if they're taking the illegal or the herbal. . . 
     . The
     kids really don't know what they're taking," said Matt Green, who with 
     his
     mother Joan runs Sameem Associates Inc., an outpatient addictions 
     treatment
     clinic in Newton.
        Someone who thinks he is taking the herbal product but is instead 
     using the
     illegal Ecstasy could overdose, Green said.
        Before Ecstasy, or MDMA as it is chemically known, was banned, some
     psychiatrists used the lab-made drug to induce euphoria, to get 
     patients in
     touch with their feelings and diminish defensiveness.
        Makers of some Ecstasy alternatives say they tell their 
     distributors not to
     sell to anyone under 18; the maker of X Tablets includes a minimum age 
     in its
     ads.
        But minors as young as 11 or 12 have gone to the General Nutrition 
     Center at
     the Arsenal Mall in Watertown in recent weeks looking for Herbal 
     Ecstacy - and
     were disappointed to discover the store did not carry it, said manager 
     Gennaro
     Coscia. "They were asking for it, thinking it was a legal form of 
     Ecstasy,"
     Coscia said.
        Adolescents seeking a "legal" high may be disappointed, anyway, to 
     discover
     there is no comparison between the illegal Ecstasy and the "legal" 
     version,
     according to some people who have tried both or know of people who 
     have.
        Neither Tim Ryan, a DJ at Axis in Boston, nor Camper English, a 
     24-year-old
     Boston resident who is into the rave scene, has tried the herbal 
     alternatives,
     but say friends who have used both experienced little effect from the 
     herbal
     products.
        Catherine, a 21-year-old Northeastern University junior who did not 
     want to
     give her last name, reported the same thing. She said she used the 
     illegal
     Ecstasy once, at a rave a year ago. "It's a real drug, it's 
     mind-altering. It
     puts you in a state of mind of, like, total happiness, a kind of 
     euphoric
     feeling, really lovey," she said.
        A week ago, she and a friend bought Herbal Ecstacy at a smoke shop, 
     to help
     them stay up late after they had already smoked marijuana and drunk 
     cappucino.
     "It's not a drug, it's herbal. It makes you alert and really 
     talkative," she
     said. "They're two totally separate things."

     HEADLINE: sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: drugs a guide to their uses and 
     abuses
     BYLINE: Compiled Pascal Wyse and Colette Harris
     BODY:
         alkyl nitrites poppers, rush, locker room science: a group of 
     chemicals
     including amyl nitrite, butyl nitrite and isobutyl nitrite.  Reduce 
     blood
     pressure by enlarging the blood vessels. Medical use: amyl nitrite is 
     an
     antidote to cyanide poisoning.
         outlaw status: amyl nitrite is a pharmacy medicine. Other forms 
     are
     currently unrestricted and available in a sex shop near you.
         price: from pounds 5.
         form: clear, yellow, volatile and inflammable liquids which smell 
     sweet when
     fresh and like "dirty socks" when stale. Sniffed from small bottles.  
         highs: a "rushing" sensation, enhanced sexual pleasure, 
     light-headedness and
     giggling.
         lows: headaches, vomiting and dermatitis. Excessive use may result 
     in a lack
     of oxygen in the blood, known as methaemoglobinemia - symptoms include 
     vomiting,
     cyanosis (blueness on the skin and lips), shock and unconsciousness. 
     Acute
     attacks of this condition have caused deaths but this is rare and 
     usually seen
     in those who have swallowed the drug rather than inhaled it. The drug 
     passes
     rapidly through the body so there appear to be no long-term effects. 
     Tolerance
     develops in two or three weeks of continued use.
         history: discovered in 1857, amyl nitrite was originally used to 
     treat
     angina. It became popular with gay men in the 1960s because it relaxes 
     the
     muscles, making anal sex easier.
         alcoholic drinks booze, jar, shot in the arm, get pissed, get 
     hammered, get
     bladdered "If he tried to go to answer the telephone, the yoke, the 
     mercury, the
     poisoned mass, would shift and roll and rupture the sac, and his 
     brains would
     fall out. . .the beast would come popping to the surface on its own 
     and show its
     filthy snout." Description of a hangover in The Bonfire of the 
     Vanities, Tom
     Wolfe
         science: active ingredients: ethyl alcohol or ethanol (beers, 
     wines,
     spirits, liqueurs); methyl alcohol (methylated spirit, meths). No 
     medical use.
         outlaw status: can be bought by adults of 18 and over, drunk at 
     home by
     children of five and over, licence needed for selling.
        price: anything from 50p (supermarket lager).
         highs: loss of inhibitions, increased sexual appetite 
     (unfortunately
     combined with decreased sexual performance). Relaxes and animates. 
     Some research
     indicates that moderate use can be good for you.
         lows: after the equivalent of four pints of beer, drinkers become 
     more
     uncoordinated and emotional reactions are exaggerated. Increased 
     intake can lead
     to double vision, loss of balance, unconsciousness. Methylated spirit 
     is very
     poisonous and frequently causes blindness, coma and death from 
     acidosis. Worst
     forms of physical damage include dietary deficiencies, liver and 
     stomach
     disorders and brain damage. Dependency (alcoholism) can occur.
         history: part of everyday life in Britain for centuries. In 1495 
     an Act was
     passed giving magistrates the power to close troublesome alehouses, 
     seen as
     places where political discontent was stirred up. In the First World 
     War
     restricted opening hours were designed to prevent inefficiency in the 
     war
     effort.

     dash. . ." Lou
     Reed, Walk on the Wild Side
         science: a group of drugs including amphetamine sulphate and 
     dexamphetamine
     (Dexedrine). Medical use: treatment of narcolepsy (a pathological 
     tendency to
     fall asleep) and hyperactivity in children.
         outlaw status: prescription-only medicine, which means it is 
     illegal to
     supply them under any circumstance except in a pharmacy, by a 
     pharmacist, in
     accordance with a doctor's prescription. Controlled drugs in Class B 
     but if
     prepared for injection, Class A penalties apply.
         price: amphetamine sulphate is commonly available on the black 
     market at
     around pounds 10-15 per gram. A typical pounds 5 "wrap" of 400-500mg 
     powder
     contains 25mg amphetamine.
         form: white powder. Sniffed, swallowed or injected.
         highs: with moderate doses people feel more alert, energetic, 
     confident and
     cheerful.
         lows: high doses, especially if frequently repeated over a few 
     days, can
     produce delirium, panic, hallucination and feelings of persecution 
     (amphetamine
     psychosis) which gradually disappear as the drug passes through the 
     body. A
     single dose lasts about three or four hours but it can take the body a 
     couple of
     days to recover from even a small dose. Psychological dependence can 
     arise from
     the mood-elevating effects of synthetic stimulants.  These drugs 
     merely postpone
     feelings of fatigue and hunger, denying the body's needs which will 
     reappear
     strongly after a "run". Tolerance develops so users increase the dose 
     many times
     over. Toxic effects including delusions; hallucinations and paranoia 
     can develop
     as a result. These symptoms will go away but persist for a time after 
     drug
     taking has stopped, and sometimes develop into a psychotic state from 
     which it
     takes a few months to recover.  Heavy prolonged use leaves the user at 
     risk from
     disease due to a lowered resistance from lack of nourishment. There is 
     also a
     risk of damaging blood vessels and of heart failure as stimulants 
     raise blood
     pressure.
         history: amphetamines and stimulants were exploited to increase 
     performance
     of troops in the Second World War and the Vietnam War, then widely 
     prescribed to
     treat depression and to suppress appetite in the 1950s and 1960s. 
     Amphetamines
     were a vogue with mods in the 1960s which led to them being classified 
     under the
     misuse of drugs legislation in 1964.
         anabolic steroids nadrolone, Stanozlol, Dianabol, Durabolin,

     "Have you ever wanted to walk into a club and be worshipped by the 
     masses and
     take your pick of sexual partners? Then join us, for this is the 
     reality for me
     and some of our friends. Join us." Quoted in Anabolic Steroid Use in 
     Great
     Britain, Korkia and Stimson
         science: derived from the hormone testosterone. Medical use: used 
     in the
     treatment of anaemia, thrombosis and to aid the recovery of weakened 
     muscles.
         outlaw status: prescription-only medicine. Class C under the 
     Misuse of Drugs
     Act.
         price: pounds 20 per 100 tablets.
         form: swallowed as pills or injected. A black market operates in 
     gyms,
     health clubs etc.
         highs: athletes and trainers believe that steroids increase 
     athletic
     performance, some researchers feel there is insufficient evidence of 
     their
     direct involvement on the increase of muscle strength.
         lows: the available evidence shows an increased risk of liver and 
     kidney
     malfunctions, hypertension, decreased fertility in men (and rare cases 
     of breast
     development), increased sex drive and enlargement of the clitoris in 
     women (a
     "high" for some, but one which goes hand-in-hand with facial and body 
     hair, a
     deepening of the voice and reduction of breast size).  There is still
     controversy over claims that steroids increase aggression, with some 
     doctors
     claiming it is a placebo effect. There have been some reports of 
     temporary
     confusion, depression, paranoia and sleep disorders which stop if 
     steroid use is
     discontinued.
         history: German soldiers reputedly used steroids in the Second 
     World War to
     increase aggression, the type of behaviour now termed "roid rage" in 
     the US.

     use: as a treatment for severe insomnia.
         outlaw status: prescription-only medicines. All "misuseable"

     are Class B drugs. Unauthorised production, supply or possession are 
     offences,
     as is providing premises for supply or production.
         price: variable.
         form: swallowed as tablets, ampoules, solutions or capsules, 
     occasionally
     with alcohol; sometimes prepared for injection.
         highs: feeling relaxed, sociable and good-humoured.
         lows: unpredictable emotional reactions and mental confusion. 
     Overdose
     causes death by respiratory failure. Alcohol and barbiturates can be a 
     lethal
     cocktail. Risk of gangrene if injected. Withdrawal can cause seizures, 
     low blood
     pressure, delirium and hallucinations. Heavy users are prone to 
     bronchitis and
     pneumonia.
         history: manufactured in the UK since 1903 as sedatives and 
     sleeping pills.
     Stolen medical supplies have been widely misused ever since.
         benzodiazepines tranx, tems, jellies, eggs "I now think of this 
     time of my
     life as the period when I had been chemically lobotomised" Peter 
     Ritson, author
     of Alive and Kicking
         science: a group of minor tranquillisers including diazepam 
     (Valium),
     chlordiazepoxide (Librium), lorazepam (Ativan), oxazepam (Serenid), 
     nitrazepam
     (Mogadon), flurazepam (Dalmane), triasolam (Halcion) and temazepam 
     (Normison).
     Medical use: relieves anxiety, induces peaceful sleep.
         outlaw status: prescription-only Medicines Controlled drugs, Class 
     C under
     the Misuse of Drugs Act but (except temazepam) legal to possess 
     without
     prescription.
         price: between 50p and pounds 2 on the black market.
         form: swallowed as pills or capsules, often shades of green, 
     yellow or blue
     in colour, or prepared for injection.
         highs: relieves anxiety; induces calmness, relaxation and mild 
     euphoria.
     Some use benzodiazepines to offset the effects of Ecstacy and 
     amphetamines.
         lows: in high doses can induce sleep, sometimes lasting into the 
     following
     day. It is harder to fatally overdose on Benzodiazepines than 
     barbiturates, but
     if mixed with alcohol the likelihood of a fatal overdose increases.  
     Tolerance
     develops quickly with constant use. After two weeks, they may become 
     ineffective
     as sleeping pills; after four months, ineffectual against anxiety. 
     Dependence is
     probably mainly psychological and is more likely in those with a 
     history of
     dependence. Generally mild symptoms of withdrawal after low-dosage 
     use. Sudden
     withdrawal leads to two to three weeks of symptoms which can include 
     insomnia,
     anxiety, perceptual hypersensitivity, tremors, irritability, nausea 
     and
     vomiting. After high doses, there is a chance of mental confusion and 
     a smaller
     chance of life-threatening convulsions. If the gel contained in some 
     capsules is
     injected, it will solidify in the veins, causing gangrene and 
     abscesses.
         history: first introduced in the 1960s, benzodiazepines came to 
     replace
     barbiturates as sedatives and sleeping pills.

     autobiography
     Head On
         science: active ingredient: cannabis sativa - contains 
     tetrahydrocannabinol.
     Medical use: since last September, patients can now be prescribed 
     Dronabinol, a
     major active constituent of cannabis to alleviate symptoms of nausea 
     associated
     with chemotherapy. The debate rages over whether it should be used to 
     treat
     other medical conditions, notably multiple sclerosis (MS).
         outlaw status: controlled drugs with herbal cannabis and resin 
     Class B but
     cannabis oil in a twilight zone between Class A and Class B; not 
     available for
     medical use - except some synthetic forms; illegal to allow premises 
     to be used
     for smoking cannabis.
         price: around pounds 15 for one eighth of an ounce, pounds 30 for 
     a quarter.
     Herbal cannabis, pounds 100 per ounce (resin costs slightly more).
         form: smoked by itself or with tobacco, or eaten.
         highs: relaxation, enhanced sensory awareness, desire for snacks, 
     less
     easily bored.
         lows: continuous use can affect short-term memory and induce 
     paranoia.  Can
     cause high pulse and dry mouth. Desire for more snacks.
         history: First recorded human use in a Chinese compendium of 
     medicines,
     dated by some at 2737BC. In the 1850s, the French writers Baudelaire, 
     Gautier
     and Dumas were members of "Le Club des Haschischins", recording 
     effects of
     smoking cannabis.
         cocaine / crack

         "Driving that train, high on cocaine, Casey Jones you'd better 
     watch your
     speed" Grateful Dead, Casey Jones
         "Inside the plastic bags the rocks were alive. . . they were 
     living heads. .
     .  no bodies. . . just heads, perfect miniature Mount Rushmores of 
     living crack.
     They were all the same person. . . some were cryin'. . . some were 
     laughin', but
     they were all screamin' my name" from Iced by Ray Shell.
         science: cocaine hydrochloride is derived from the leaves of the 
     Andean coca
     shrub. Medical use: effective as a local anaesthetic but rarely 
     prescribed.
         outlaw status: prescription-only medicines; Class A drugs.
         price: powder: pounds 40 to pounds 70 per gram; crack: pounds 10 
     to pounds
     25 per rock.
         form: white powder, sniffed and occasionally injected; or small 
     white
     nuggets (crack), which are burnt and inhaled.
         highs: feeling of omnipotence and well being, decreased hunger and 
     a feeling
     of exhilaration.
         lows: large doses or a spree of repeated doses can lead to extreme
     agitation, anxiety, paranoia and perhaps hallucination. As with 
     amphetamines,
     the effects generally resolve themselves as the drug passes through 
     the body.
     Excessive doses can lead to respiratory or heart failure death but 
     this is rare.
     Cocaine is likely to be adulterated with substances, causing harm if 
     injected.
     No tolerance develops but there can be a psychological dependence. 
     With frequent
     use increasingly unpleasant symptoms including nausea, insomnia and
     hyperexcitability can occur, eventually leading to a state of mind 
     similar to
     paranoid psychosis. These symptoms usually clear up once use is 
     discontinued.
     Repeated sniffing damages the nose; repeated smoking causes 
     respiratory
     problems; injecting carries the usual risks: abscesses, HIV (if 
     needles are
     shared) etc. The effect of crack is more intense; tolerance is more 
     likely to
     develop.
         history: coca leaves were chewed by the Incas hundreds of years 
     ago.
     Introduced in to Europe and America in the 19th century, cocaine was 
     marketed as
     an effective remedy for hay fever, allergies and sinusitis because it 
     shrank the
     nasal membranes. In the 1880s Coca Cola, which originally contained 
     cocaine, was
     marketed as a temperance drink and brain tonic.  Freud's 1884 essay 
     "Uber Coca"
     advocated its use as a stimulant, local anaesthetic, and treatment for 
     syphilis,
     hysteria and asthma. He also thought it was an aphrodisiac. Although 
     it
     sometimes produces spontaneous orgasm in the user with the first rush, 
     long-term
     effects include impotence in men and a difficulty in achieving orgasm 
     for women.

         science: active ingredient: MDMA, a member of the MDA family. 
     Classed as an
     hallucinogenic amphetamine - a group of drugs combining the effects of
     amphetamine and LSD. Medical use: none.
         outlaw status: Class A controlled drugs. Anyone wanting to use it 
     for
     research has to apply for a licence from the Home Office.
         price: pounds 8-15 per tablet.
         form: swallowed as tablets or capsules.
         highs: euphoric rush, feelings of calmness and serenity. Users 
     experience a
     greater feeling of connection and empathy towards others, heightened 
     perception
     and occasionally hallucinations.
         lows: nausea, dry mouth and rise in blood pressure on taking. 
     Afterwards
     there may be feelings of fatigue and depression. High doses over a 
     long period
     of time can produce anxiety, panic, confusion, insomnia and possibly 
     psychosis -
     all of which stop once the drug is stopped. Around 50 deaths have been 
     directly
     associated with the drug since 1988. Most of those who have died have 
     exhibited
     symptoms connected to heatstroke. It is thought that the cumulative 
     effects of
     MDMA (which as a stimulant makes it possible to dance for long periods 
     of time
     without feeling exhausted) and dancing in hot, sweaty night-clubs have 
     caused
     this. Clubs have been exploiting this by charging for water, but some 
     local
     authorities have put a stop to this. Paradoxically, a few deaths 
     (about 3) have
     been attributed to drinking excessive amounts of water while taking 
     the drug.
     There is some evidence to suggest that ecstacy triggers the body's 
     release of
     anti-diuretic hormones, which limit the effectiveness of the kidneys 
     at
     processing fluids.  An excess of fluid in the body dilutes the blood 
     and swells
     the brain, crushing it against the skull. Water is not antidote to 
     ecstacy, it
     is an antidote to dancing. Given the widespread use of E, however, it 
     is still
     unclear as to why certain individuals have died, even if the actual 
     cause is
     known. Some people have responded to the stimulant aspect of the drug 
     with very
     high blood pressure causing heart attack or brain haemorrhage.  The 
     current
     advice for users of ecstacy is: if dancing, drink one pint of water 
     per hour;
     take regular rests from dancing; eat some salty foods and drink fruit 
     juice for
     minerals. Drinking water will not counteract the ill effects of 
     ecstacy.
         history: MDMA was first synthesised in 1912 but no medical or 
     commercial
     uses were found for it until American marital therapists discovered 
     its
     potential for encouraging feelings of empathy between clients and 
     diffusing
     hostility. Once it leaked into the general population it was banned in 
     the USA
     in 1985, though is apparently still used by some Swiss 
     psychotherapists.  Became
     very popular among ravers in the Eighties.
         ghb gbh, liquid e, liquid x science: proper name: 
     gammahydroxybutyrate or
     sodium oxybate. Medical use: an anaesthetic acting more as a sedative 
     than a
     pain-killer.
         outlaw status: not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, so 
     possession
     not an offence. Classified as a medicine so unauthorised manufacture 
     and
     distribution could be an offence under the Medicines Act, but the drug 
     can be
     legally imported for personal use only.
         price: pounds 5 for a capful, pounds 10-15 for a bottle.
         form: colourless, odourless liquid with a slightly salty taste.
         highs: some users have likened the effect to ecstasy. Like 
     alcohol, small
     doses will break down social inhibitions and increase sex drive.
         lows: large doses have led to nausea, vomiting, disorientation, 
     convulsions
     and respiratory collapse. Recovery, however, has been rapid.
         history: developed in the USA as a premedication to promote sleep 
     before
     surgery.
         ketamine special k science: anaesthetic with analgesic and 
     psychedelic
     properties. Medical uses: an animal tranquilliser.
         outlaw status: not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act so 
     possession is
     not a criminal offence. It is a prescription-only medicine, so 
     unauthorised
     supply is illegal.
         price: pounds 6 to pounds 25 for a "wrap" of powder.
         form: appears as a liquid in its pharmaceutical state, but can be 
     found as a
     powder, pills or preparation for smoking.
         highs: key experience is one of disassociation; users say they 
     take on a
     different point of view, outside of the body and self. Can include
     hallucinations, synaesthesia ("seeing" sounds and "hearing" colours), 
     euphoria,
     confusion and the out-of-body floating experiences, which seem 
     specific to
     ketamine.  Popular in dance communities that have embraced ecstasy.
         lows: because it's an anaesthetic, eating or drinking before 
     taking it can
     cause vomiting. Temporary paralysis has been reported but is rare.  
     Because it's
     an anaesthetic with painkilling properties, people under its influence 
     might not
     realise if they injure themselves.
         history: used in emergency surgery in the Vietnam War because it 
     causes
     muscle rigidity: the patient cannot move.

     deal is too time-consuming" Western drug user.
         science: proper name: catha edulis, a green leafy plant found 
     throughout
     eastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Active ingredients: 
     cathinone and
     cathine. Medical uses: see History, below.
         outlaw status: the plant itself is not controlled under the Misuse 
     of Drugs
     Act , but the active ingredients, cathinone and cathine, are Class C 
     drugs.
     Cathinone may not be lawfuly possessed, supplied etc without licence 
     for
     research, though cathine may be prescribed.
         price: variable.
         form: fresh plant leaves (the active ingredients deteriorate two 
     days after
     harvest) which are chewed.
         highs: mild euphoria and talkativeness, similar to a moderate dose 
     of
     amphetamine.
         lows: inflammation of the mouth and oral cavity. Prolonged use 
     brings risk
     of cancer, depression, anxiety and possibly psychosis.
         history: Alexander the Great used it to treat his soldiers for an 
     unknown
     "epidemic disease". In the Harar region of Ethiopia it is widely 
     believed to
     effect 501 cures, the number of which equals the numerical value of 
     its Arabic
     name: ga-a-t (400+100+1). Has been used by the Muslim cultures of 
     Somalia and
     Yemen for centuries. In modern times, it is so important a commodity 
     that its
     daily export to Aden lay behind the founding of Ethiopian Airlines.
         lsd tabs, acid, trips, om, strawberry, other names relating to the 
     designs
     of the tabs"Turn on, tune in and drop out" Timothy Leary
         science: proper name: lysergic acid diethylamide and lysergide. 
     Medical
     uses: none.
         outlaw status: controlled drugs; LSD not available for medical 
     use.
         price: pounds 1.50 to pounds 3 per tab (UK average).
         form: LSD itself is a white powder, but the tiny amounts needed 
     for a trip
     are usually mixed with other substances and made into tablets. In 
     solution it
     can be absorbed on paper, gelatin sheets or sugar cubes.
         highs: fascinating auditory and visual hallucinations.
         lows: the bad trip is about the only danger, but as the LSD 
     experience is
     more open to the user's intentions and the suggestions of others, 
     friendly
     reassurance can be an effective antidote. Suicides or deaths due to 
     LSD- induced
     beliefs or perceptions are rare, though much publicised. There has 
     only been one
     case of fatal overdose reported in relevant literature and this might 
     have been
     due to a combination of circumstances. There are no known physical 
     dangers
     associated with long-term LSD use. There is no reliable evidence that 
     LSD causes
     brain damage or harms future children.  Prolonged and serious adverse 
     reactions
     are rare, but generally occur among individuals with latent or 
     existing mental
     illness after repeated use. A substantial minority of LSD users report
     occasional flashbacks which can lead to disorientation, distress and 
     anxiety but
     are rarely dangerous. There is no physical dependence. Tolerance 
     develops so
     fast that after three or four days of repeated use the user has to 
     stop for a
     while or no effect occurs. LSD users can become psychologically 
     dependent.  It
     is sometimes said that taking vitamin C along with LSD stops any bad 
     side
     effects. There's no evidence to support this theory but vitamin C 
     could help the
     body get rid of the drug more quickly by acting as a diuretic.
         history: first produced in 1938, its discoverer underwent the 
     first LSD trip
     in 1943. In the 1950s and 1960s it was put to use in psychotherapy to 
     assist in
     recovering repressed thoughts and there was military interest in it as 
     a way of
     disabling enemy forces. Among fringe and hippie groups it was seen as 
     a way of
     opening the mind to transcendental experiences.  It was determined 
     Class A under
     the 1973 Misuse of Drugs Act.
         magic mushrooms mushiesscience: proper name: psilocybe 
     semilanceata.  Active
     ingredient: psilobycin and psilocin (Liberty Cap), amanita muscaria 
     (Fly
     Agaric). Medical uses: none.
         outlaw status: Liberty Cap may be controlled drug if prepared for 
     use,
     otherwise unrestricted. The drugs they contain are usually Class A, so 
     even
     crushing the mushrooms can be regarded by some courts as an intention 
     to use the
     drug.
         price: free if you can find them.
         form: swallowed raw, cooked, or brewed into a drink often after 
     drying.
     Liberty Caps grow wild in many parts of the UK in autumn.
         highs: euphoria and hilarity, hallucinations, lots of giggling.
         lows: at high doses visual distortions progress to vivid
     pseudohallucinations of colour and movement, often accompanied by 
     nausea,
     vomiting and stomach pains. Greatest danger lies in the possibility of 
     picking
     poisonous mushrooms by mistake. Eating varieties such as Amanita 
     Phalloides or
     Amanita Virosa can lead to death from only very small amounts. It 
     would take
     huge amounts of magic mushrooms to cause death. No serious 
     long-lasting effects
     have so far been reported, though no study as yet exists.
         history: the Aztecs, the shamans of North-east Asia and Siberia 
     and a host
     of other ancient tribes used hallucinogenic plants as a means of 
     gaining access
     to the spirit world, and divining the future. The upsurge of 
     popularity in the
     UK during the 1970s was probably something to do with people wanting 
     an
     "organic" alternative to LSD.
         opiates junk, skag, H, smack, dike (for dipipanone)"They can get 
     it out of
     your body, but they can't get it out of your mind" Charlie Parker, 
     jazz
     musician, 1946
         "Thou hast the keys of paradise, oh just, subtle and mighty 
     opium!" Thomas
     De Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium Eater
         science: group of drugs derived from the opium poppy including 
     heroin,
     morphine, dipipanone, pethidine and dextropropoxyphene. Methadone is a 
     synthetic
     opiate. Medical use: pain relief, cough suppression and as anti- 
     diarrhoea
     agent. Synthetic opiates, such as methadone, are used to treat opiate
     dependence.
         outlaw status: prescription-only medicines. All are controlled 
     under the
     Misuse of Drugs Act, although dilutions of codeine, morphine or opium 
     appear in
     some over-the-counter drugs such as Phensedyl, Kaodene, Gee's Linctus, 
     J Collis
     Browne's mixture and kaolin & morphine.
         price: heroin, pounds 50 to pounds 90 per gram.
        form: opiate powders are swallowed or dissolved in water and 
     injected.
     Opium itself is the dried "milk" of the opium poppy, which contains 
     morphine and
     codeine and is eaten or smoked. Heroin, as fluffy white powder, is 
     quite easily
     distilled from morphine.
         highs: euphoria, depression of the nervous system, feeling of 
     warmth,
     detachment from pain and anxiety.
         lows: high doses lead to sedation and drowsiness. Excessive doses 
     produce
     stupor and coma. Death from respiratory failure is possible but far 
     more likely
     if other drugs have been used at the same time, there has been a loss 
     of
     tolerance, or the drug is unexpectedly potent. There can be fatal 
     reactions to
     injected impurities. Tolerance develops to opiates in a way that 
     requires the
     user to up the dose and / or change the method of taking them in order 
     to get
     the same rush. There comes a point when the sensation can't be 
     maintained and
     the drug has to be taken just to get a feeling of normality. 
     Intravenous
     injection maximises the effects so as money runs short and cravings 
     increase,
     people tend to move on from smoking heroin to injecting it. Fatal 
     overdose can
     happen when opiate users take their usual dose after a break, during 
     which
     tolerance has faded. Physical effects of long-term opiate use include
     respiratory complaints, constipation and irregular menstrual periods, 
     with
     chronic sedation occurring at higher doses. Because opiates in 
     themselves are

         history: Opium became popular in England in the 18th century, when 
     it
     appeared in many patent medicines, notably "Dover's Powders". After 
     the First
     World War, Britain implemented an international agreement prohibiting 
     the
     non-medical use of opium and opiates but never denied they could be 
     prescribed
     to anyone who couldn't cope without the drug. By 1968 only a few 
     specialist
     clinics were authorised to dispense heroin.

         science: active ingredients: toluene (glue), acetone (glue), 
     butane (lighter
     fuel), fluorocarbons (aerosols), trichloroethylene (cleaning fluid),
     trichloroethane (cleaning fluid). Medical uses: none.
         outlaw status: illegal to sell knowingly for inhalation. In 
     Scotland,
     misusers may be taken into care.
         price: from pounds 1.30.
         form: gases, fluids, glues usually with strong smells. Inhaled as 
     vapours or
     gases through nose / mouth.
         highs: hallucinations, euphoria and laughter.
         lows: breathing and heart rate are depressed so repeated or deep 
     inhalation
     can result in disorientation, loss of control and unconsciousness; but 
     recovery
     is usually quick, with no lasting damage. Drowsiness and a "hangover" 
     often
     occur. Death can happen due to accidents or injury because of 
     "drunkenness", and
     there are risks of choking on vomit if user becomes unconscious. Some 
     products
     sensitise the heart to the effects of exertion or excitement and can 
     cause heart
     failure. Gases squirted through the mouth can result in suffocation, 
     as can
     sniffing glue from a plastic bag placed over the head (but this is due 
     to the
     plastic bag cutting off air supply). Heavy solvent misuse can result 
     in
     moderate, lasting brain function damage, especially affecting control 
     of
     movement. Chronic misuse of aerosols and cleaning fluid has led to 
     lasting
     kidney and liver damage, and sniffing leaded petrol can lead to lead 
     poisoning.
     However lasting damage attributable to solvent misuse seems very rare.
         history: chloroform and ether parties were held in the 1800s when

     relief by
     smokers. Something to do with your hands.

     disease, blood
     clots, heart attacks, lung infections, strokes, bronchitis, lung 
     cancer, cancer
     of the mouth and throat, and ulcers. Risk of irreversible lung damage 
     increases
     the more cigarettes someone smokes over a long period of time. If no
     irreversible effects have occurred and a smoker stops smoking, the 
     lungs begin
     to clear themselves and the person can regain normal health.  Smokers 
     who stop
     can experience restlessness, irritability and cravings.
         history: became popular in England during the 16th and 17th 
     centuries.  But
     fears of lung damage and the effects of passive smoking caused King 
     James I
     himself to write "Counterblaste Against Tobacco" in 1604. However, by 
     1625, the
     tax revenue encouraged even the king to accept its widespread use.

HEADLINE: SORTED OR DISTORTED?
The media has demonised Ecstasy and turned Leah Betts into a sacrificial victim,
but does such emotive coverage alienate users of the drug? Alix Sharkey argues
that the real issues are being blurred
BYLINE: Alix Sharkey
    IN THESE unstable times, there is a comforting reliability about the British
media's reaction to Ecstasy. The latest wave of fear and loathing began in
October last year, when 17-year-old Daniel Ashton died after taking a tablet in
a Blackpool nightclub. A week later, two young men went on trial in
Buckinghamshire, accused of supplying the drug in September 1994 to a
sixth-former who had subsequently died (they were acquitted). These events
provided the tabloids, then struggling to milk the Fred West case for more
salacious details, with an excuse to run their usual glut of dated horror
stories.
    Their predictability was epitomised by the now-defunct Today, which devoted
a week of front pages to The Evils of Ecstasy, complete with double-page centre
spreads under lurid headlines like: 'Clare was in a coma, her body bloated and
bleeding.  What had happened to our lovely daughter?' (The answer, which Today
omitted, was that Clare Leighton had died of an extremely rare allergic reaction
to the drug - in 1989.) The clamour grew. Ecstasy was our worst nightmare, a
child-killing drug, available on every street corner.  
    Within a month, this grotesque carnival seemed to generate its own
sacrificial victim. Leah Betts, an Essex schoolgirl, fell into a coma after
taking one tablet on her 18th birthday, and never recovered.  Betts's death
generated an avalanche of emotive but essentially uninformative copy. But few,
if any, questioned the cultural assumptions implicit in the reporting of this
event. Nobody asked whether the death would have received such widespread
attention had it not involved a pretty, white, teenage girl. By contrast, the
death of 18-year-old Andreas Bouzis two weeks ago at a rave in south London went
almost unnoticed.
    Leah Betts's death was undoubtedly a shocking and tragic event, made all the
more disturbing by the fact that her policeman father had been in the Drug Squad
and her stepmother, a nurse, had worked in drugs counselling. More than
anything, it illustrated our lack of a cohesive, flexible social policy towards
drugs. There exists a largely manufactured consensus that drugs are 'evil',
those who sell them are 'monsters', those who take them are 'victims'. When
drugs cannot be considered outside this simplistic rhetorical context,
meaningful debate is impossible.
    Even factual TV programmes now take their editorial lead from such
reporting.  During the past month, the BBC documentary slot Public Eye has been
calling independent TV production companies, asking if they can make a
two-parter on the dangers of Ecstasy. Panorama also started research this month
on an Ecstasy programme, but decided to shelve it 'until the waters are a little
less muddy', according to one producer. And next Monday, Granada TV will
broadcast a World In Action special called Sorted.
    Producer Sarah Mainwaring-White says her film 'follows Leah Betts's parents
on a journey, where they make interesting discoveries about Ecstasy'. She says
the Bettses wanted to make more information about the drug available. But it
seems that while the focus will be on the drug's dangers, the programme will not
address the specific cause of Leah's death.
    This has been the subject of conjecture since a report in the Times on
November 22, stating that death was due not to the effects of Ecstasy, but to
water intoxication. Autopsy results will not be made public until the inquest on
January 31, two days after the programme is broadcast. However, if the Times
report were unfounded, or there were evidence to the contrary, one might have
expected the Bettses to want such information made public immediately.
    So how dangerous is MDMA (short for Methylene-dioxy-methyl-amphetamine, the
pharmaceutical term for Ecstasy)? Dr Karl Jansen, an eminent psychiatrist and
neuro-pharmacologist, was interviewed by the Bettses for Sorted. He feels the
risks associated with Ecstasy consumption, while not to be ignored, have been
greatly overstated in recent media coverage.
    The risk of death from MDMA, Dr Jansen says, can be computed by taking the
number of deaths due to the drug, divided by the number of times it is consumed.
Official figures up to 1994, plus deaths reported in the media during 1995, give
a total of 60 deaths since 1987. Even the most conservative estimates put
consumption at a million doses per week, a level that has probably remained
steady since 1992. Dr Jansen thus evaluates the risk of death at one in 6.8
million.
    A clinical pharmacologist would not consider such a statistic to imply that
MDMA is a particularly dangerous drug, Dr Jansen says, since in the US alone,
deaths from internal bleeding due to the consumption of aspirin in ordinary
doses average around 750 per year. 'Amphetamine or speed, about which there has
been very little in the media recently, kills at least eight times more young
persons per year than MDMA, in the same rave party context.' Dr Jansen points
out that the probability of death while on a Swiss skiing holiday is 'at least
five times higher than the probability of dying following the consumption of
MDMA'.
furore of the past few months, there has been
no mention in the media that the leading cause of death in the UK among persons
aged 14 to 24 is car accidents involving the consumption of alcohol. Nor that 70
per cent of all drug-related deaths are due to smoking, 25 per cent are due to
alcohol, 3 per cent are due to heroin and related compounds, and only a very
tiny fraction of the remainder are related in any way to the use of MDMA. Dr
Jansen concludes that 'the scientific truth . . . is that the overwhelming
majority of MDMA doses consumed is unlikely to have adverse, life-threatening
effects'.
    The genesis of the World In Action programme illustrates current trends in
media coverage. Following Leah's death, her parents, Paul and Janet Betts, were
interviewed by Richard and Judy on This Morning, Granada TV's news digest and
chat show.  At about the same time, Paul Delaney, director of advertising firm
Knight Leach Delaney, was approached by a media consultant offering free
billboard space for a campaign of his choice. There was no doubt in his mind
about the subject he would choose.  'I'm not in the business of drugs education,
but I have kids of that age, and I think they and their peers should know that
taking Ecstasy is dangerous.' The poster featured the by now familiar picture of
a smiling Leah, on a black background, with the word 'Sorted' in large white
caps underneath. Below this was the legend 'Just one Ecstasy tablet killed Leah
Betts'.
    Following their appearance on This Morning, the Bettses were approached by
programme executives and asked if they would like to make an educational video
for schools. They agreed, and the result was Sorted - Leah Betts: Just An
Ordinary Kid. The 16-minute video, which was filmed, edited and packaged in only
10 days, features interviews with her parents, siblings and Leah's best friend -
with whom she purchased the Ecstasy - and goes on to re -enact her last day. It
includes home video footage of Leah at a birthday party, footage of her funeral
service and interviews with the police and the doctors who treated her. The film
ends with 'a roll-call of other youngsters who have died after taking Ecstasy'.
    Granada, along with the Bettses, decided to try to get the video into every
secondary school in the UK before the Christmas holidays - and the party season.
This prompted an unprecedented reaction. 'We mailed out 8,000 copies to
schools,' says Granada journalist Joanna Hartley, 'including a letter from the
Bettses, a letter from Richard and Judy, and a questionnaire.  We've had
something like 15,000 replies.'
    Granada estimates that up to 500,000 secondary schoolchildren have seen the
video. Following requests from police, parents and youth organisations, the
video was made available to the public via mail order. It has since sold a
further 3,500 copies, making nearly 12,000 copies in circulation. But does it
address the relative dangers of Ecstasy and other drugs, or contain educational
material? 'No,' Hartley says, 'it's just Leah's story.'
    The Sorted title was chosen to tie in with Knight Leach Delaney's billboard
campaign: KLD gladly gave permission and contributed free artwork for the
video's cover. Paul Delaney dismisses the suggestion that, instead of
highlighting the dangers of Ecstasy, he might have directed his campaign at
government inaction. 'Nothing's going to make this government do anything about
it, or the Labour Party for that matter. It's a vote loser, so they won't even
discuss it.'
    Delaney seems to be right in this respect, and his efforts, along with those
of the Granada team and the Bettses, to counter the perceived Ecstasy menace are
clearly motivated by genuine concern for the safety of young people. Sorted is a
heart-felt response to the public's general feeling of helplessness and outrage
at the Government's reluctance to address the Ecstasy issue, much less develop a
cohesive policy.
    There are signs of progress - the Home Office has invited leading academics
to Queen Anne's Gate on February 5 'to consider the dangers of taking Ecstasy,
evaluate its toxicity and discuss harm-reducing measures'. But the deeply
unpopular and unpalatable truth appears to be this: Ecstasy is not nearly as
dangerous as the public has been led to believe. Despite years of hype and
hysteria, young people know this, and that is why they continue to take it and
why attempts to intimidate them are ultimately misguided.
    The underlying message of the Sorted campaign is a version of the 1980s
'Just Say No' campaign, now widely discredited among drugs counsellors. As Mike
Linnel, of Manchester's drug information charity Lifeline, puts it: 'The 'Just
Say No' line is about as effective as spitting in the wind. The hypocrisy is
obvious and breeds contempt among the young.'
    There is undoubtedly a serious problem concerning Ecstasy and young people
in this country. But the question is not one of individual risk, but the
effectiveness, or otherwise, of continuing to define the problem solely in terms
of criminality and, by extension, morality. It is a matter of whether we address
drugs education by shutting down our children's minds, or opening our own. If
our elected representatives are failing us - and all sides seem to agree on this
point at least - surely we should concentrate on shaming the politicians, rather
than frightening our kids. It's time we picked on someone our own size.

HEADLINE: E OR NOT E: WHAT'S REALLY IN THOSE TABLETS?
The media has demonised Ecstasy and turned Leah Betts into a sacrificial victim,
but does such emotive coverage alienate users of the drug? Alix Sharkey
demonstrates that Ecstasy has in any case now been replaced by potentially more
dangerouscompounds
BYLINE: Alix Sharkey
    THE IRONY about the media obsession with the dangers of Ecstasy is that
hardly anyone is actually taking the real thing. When Ecstasy first started to
be sold in raves, buyers were almost certain to get pure MDMA, or Ecstasy as it
became known in the early 1980s. But as the sample shows, the chances of finding
pure MDMA on sale in British clubs are now virtually nil. Of the 14 tablets
purchased in clubs around Britain at the end of last year and analysed for the
Guardian, only five contained any MDMA at all, and none had enough for a
psychoactive dose (around 120-130 mg).  Most contained a chemical 'cousin',
MDEA, which is easier and cheaper to synthesise. MDMA and MDEA are both
classified by law as 'Ecstasy compounds', and as such are Class A drugs, as is
their 'parent', MDA. This is also sometimes sold as 'Ecstasy'.  
    Although MDEA is just as effective in creating an initial euphoric 'rush',
it lacks the 'warmth' of MDMA and does not generate the feelings of 'empathy'
associated with Ecstasy. Most disturbing of all were the two tablets that
contained Ketamine, a tranquilliser and anaesthetic which can produce horrific
hallucinations, loss of feeling and movement in the limbs, and even coma. As the
table shows, there is no way of telling such a tablet from one containing MDEA.
Birmingham police this month seized contaminated E tablets 'said to contain
tranquillisers and stimulants'. Almost certainly, these contained the same mix
of ketamine (tranquilliser), ephedrine and procaine (both stimulants).

HEADLINE: Hair analysis in the diagnosis of toxic hepatitis after drug abuse
with 'ecstacy.' Dtsch Med Wochenschr 1995;120:1165-1168; Abstract
BYLINE: Skopp, G.
    History and clinical findings: A young man, aged 18 years, was admitted to
the hospital for suspected hepatitis, having developed increasing jaundice
without any pain. His urine was light brown in colour and the stools often
liquid and pale.   Every 14 days for the last 4 months he had been taking 2
tablets of "ecstacy" (methylenedioxymetamfetamine MDMA ). Physical examination
was unremarkable and the patient was in good general condition.
    Tests: The activities of GOT, GPT and alkaline phosphatase were raised (to
903, 744 and 270 U/l, respectively) as was the bilirubin concentration (16.8
mg/dl). Tests were negative for leptospira and the viruses of mumps, HI,
variceDa zoster, picorna, cytomegaly, coxsackie and hepatitis A, B and C.
Ultrasound revealed hepatomegaly, with a normal echo pattern. Hair analysis
demonstrated, in two different hair segments (0-2 cm and 2 4 cm, respectively)
both MDMA (6.4 and 4.3 mu g/g hair) and its metabolite MDA (0.7 and 5.0 mu g/g
hair).
    Treatment and course: No specific treatment was required. After intake of
the drug had been stopped the transferase activities and bilirubin concentration
became essentially normal.
    Conclusion: Hair analysis can be valuable in confirming "ecstacy" abuse,
especially when it is denied, and thus contribute to clarifying the cause of
toxic hepatitis.

HEADLINE: FOCUS - THE DRUG CULTURE: The other side of the tablet: an 'effective'
medical tool Rachel Sylvester considers claims that the drug is 'penicillin for
the soul'
BYLINE: By RACHEL SYLVESTER
   ECSTASY is not just a recreational drug. Rick Doblin, of the American
Multi-disciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies, believes it could be "a
very effective medical tool". American researchers are pioneering MDMA as a
possible treatment for cancer patients - the drug cannot cure them of the
sickness but it can at least alleviate the symptoms. Doctors believe Ecstasy
could be a better painkiller than morphine, because it leaves users in charge of
all their faculties. There are suggestions that Ecstasy may also emerge as a
possible treatment for depression, and even Alzheimer's disease: new research
has found that it has exactly the opposite effect to the disease on the brain.
The US Food and Drug Administration has given a licence to Dr Charles Grob, of
the Harbor-UCLA Medical Centre in California, to administer Ecstasy to humans in
order to find out exactly how safe it is. Ecstasy's supporters claim that the
drug is a useful tool in psychotherapy. When it was first circulated, therapists
described it as "penicillin for the soul". "It helps people who have buried
emotions which are difficult to deal with," said Mr Doblin. "They become more
able to express their feelings." There are reported to be therapists in 
America,Denmark and Germany who risk their licences by using the drug in 
sessions.

hi kids, just waking up and boy are my hands beat up, and my shoulders are
sore, but boy was it worth it........killer party till 9am this
morning............great location under a freeway overpass, and Dj. Galen
was the SHIT !!!!........every once in a blue moon...... a DJ blows me away
with a magnificent set of mind fuck music.......truly impressive.......this
kid has major talent...........thank you thank you thank you.......and I  
just wanted to thank the gateway people (too long to list)......for
inviting me.......I had a great time sloshing around in the muddy DJ
booth...........a good time was had by all, (all that came that
is)........a tad bit windy, and a might nippy, but that location should go
off in the summer.....when it's much drier..............moonpup.....say no
more 
 
of course pushing the truck out of the mud wasn't a lot of
fun......especially after dragging those Bass bins and amp-rack through
hill and dale.........but it goes to show you that positive mental
telepathy can go along way.....(with a little muscle thrown
in)...................but it's all in the spirit of Full Moon......... 
 
P.s. -I heard a rumor that wicked also did a full moon last nite......does
anyone know ...is that true......and if so, how was it...........??????

I got my brother, Brad ( of Mother EArth Sound System,formerly of Sf, 
currently spins LA) a nice pair of Audio Technicas-they were about 
75.00.  They have a good support joint where it plugs in, so the wires 
don't get exposed, and the sound is good, too.On Mon, 4 Mar 1996, Chris

        How fun to finally be on the list!  I think I've gotten the bug,
though - I've been running to the campus computer lab every couple of hours
today (between work and classes) to check for any new messages...kinda like
when I was a newborn raver and had to go to =every= single party!  Maybe in
time I'll learn how to use my delete key, just as I choose parties now
based on line-ups and promoters...

        Thanks to everyone who took the time to personally welcome me.
I've been frustrated by an inability to have meaningful conversations with
new people at parties, all the while knowing that *a lot* of them are there
for the exact same reasons I am: connectedness, transcendence, dance,
unity, and love.  I see this list as the connections and the conversations
I've been wanting to have with all the happy, but anonymous, bodies around
me.  (It's at least half my fault because I rarely stray far from a booming
speaker, while dancing wildly in my own world!)

        Through dialogue and sharing our thoughts and dreams, we can build
on our underground community, make it stronger, more cohesive, and more
visionary.  I'm suddenly obsessed with the idea of getting all Bay Area
ravers on-line, so that we can articulate our values, build a stronger
sense of togetherness, and make the rave experience an even more meaningful
one, for more people.  (But maybe 100 messages a day is enough!)

        I'm looking forward to many more interesting conversations with all
of you...

Subject: Invisible Raves
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I just finished rereading Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, which I think
is a brilliant book by a genius author. Near the end there's a section that
reminded me of something:



A sibyl, questioned about Marozia's fate, said: " I see two cities: one of
the rat, one of the swallow."

This was the interpretation of the oracle: today Marozia is a city where
all run though leaden passages like packs of rats who tear from one
another's teeth the leftovers which fall from the teeth of the most
voracious ones; but a new century is about to begin in which all the
inhabitants of Marozia will fly like swallows in the summer sky, calling
one another as in a game, showing off, their wings still, as they swoop,
clearing the air of mosquitos and gnats.

"It is time for the century of the rat to end and the century of the
swallow to begin," the more determined said. In fact, already beneath the
grim and petty rattish dominion, you could sense, among the less obvious
people, a pondering, the preparation of a swallowlike flight, heading for
the transparent air with a deft flick of the tail, then tracing with their
wing's blade the curve of an opening horizon.

I have come back to Marozia after many years: for some time the sibyl's
prophecy is considered to have come true; the old century is dead and
buried, the new is at its climax. The city has curely changed, and perhaps
for the better. But the wings I have seen moving about are those of
suspicious umbrellas under which heavy eyelids are lowered; there are
people who believe they are flying, but it is already an achievement if
they can get off the ground flapping their batlike overcoats.

It also happens that, if you move along Marozia's compact walls, when you
least expect it, you see a crack open and a different city appear. Then, an
instant later, it has already vanished. Perhaps everything lies in knowing
what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order and rhythm;
or else someone's gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone
to do something for the sheer pleasure of doing it, and for his pleasure to
become the pleasure of others; at that moment, all spaces change, all
heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline,
transparent as a dragonfly. But everything must happen as if by chance,
without attaching too much importance to it, without insisting that you are
performing a decisive operation, remembering clearly that any moment the
old Marozia will return and solder its ceiling of stone, cobwebs, and mold
over all heads.

Was the oracle mistaken? Not necessarily. I interpret it in this way:
Marozia consists of two cities, the rat's and the swallow's; both change
with time, but their relationship does not change; the second is the one
about to free itself from the first.

Last month I went to Bahia Cabana on Wednesday night for an event
called Body Electro. The flyer says it's 1st Wednesday of every
month. That would be March 6th. Anybody know if it will happen and who
will be playing. It's supposed to be "live electronic beat music".

Last month it was awesome with Liquid Acrobat, Terbo Ted, a special
guest from England who was very good ( I wish I could remember his
name ), and others. I hope it's happening again!

I'd *love* to bring my generator to power a soundsystem...  

And if we plan on going into the darkness hours, I could even bring my

Any chance of a vegan BBQ expert???  =)

First, I like to mention that we don't want to have it on a Sunday because
Sunsets will be starting in late March, I think it was the 24th if I read
write. But the location is good. We can also have it at a beach. Like I
mentioned before I have a huge BBQ, long as a bed of a truck, that can be
used at a beach. But I think Larry mentioned something about a good location
that would be centrally located for alot of people. You also have to think
about music. Do we want Amplified music or a boom box. I think having a boom
box would result in alot of people wanting to play there tapes and CD's
first and that can cause a battle on who plays what. We would need a
selected person to handle the boom box. That might not happen, but it's a
thought. Having amplified music at a park is a concern due to not being able
to have it at some parks. This is why I'm kinda pushing for a beach. We can
have volleyball, and all kind of beach sports, we can have amplified music
and we have a BBQ Grill that mobile big enough to BBQ anything end
everything at the same time so wee all eat as a family. Since having a
catering company on the side that gears toward BBQ, I can BBQ just about
anything from meats to veggies. So this can be all done on ONE BBQ. I
suggest we have it on April 20th..it's a Saturday. I also would like to
suggest that anyone interested in helping out with this BBQ/Party should all
get together. I say all people that wants to help, met somewhere like Fresh
Choice at the Stanford Shopping Center on March 20th around 8pm or if anyone
else has a better location, please let me know.

Do you have any idea how I can get a copy of this?  Although I grew up in Palo 
Alto, I think it may be difficult to make it to your  soiree as I now live in 
Manhattan.  Any info you could provide would be killer

Dear Tim,

Yay!! Thanks for volunteering your barbecue equipment!

I agree that beach would be the best place for the party.  What about 
doing a daytime party at Bonny Doon?  It could be a beach clean-up party, 
perhaps, so that the Santa Cruz folks will be okay with it.

I remember there was a Bonny Doon clean-up party a while ago.  Does 
anybody who was involved in organizing it have any tips on how to go 
about getting permission to use that space?

Panther Beach might also be an option.  I guess the drawbacks are that 
it's not really centrally located.

Maybe it would be a good idea to start looking around for sound equipment 
that someone might be willing to volunteer.  Also, I think it would be a 
good idea to ask for donations from people to cover costs of the sound 
equipment as it would be nice to give that person a bit of cash to pay 
for cleaning and maintenance, since outdoor parties tend to be a bit hard 
on sound equipment.  Also it might be necessary to rent a generator- for 
a big one, I think it's usually about $50 or so for the day.  I usually 
go to Big4Rents for that.

Hi guys....
My head is hanging...I am sorry for all I have confused..
The party with Derrick and Stacey not playing in a club...*grin* on
Saturday the 9th..is in beautiful Victoria, British Columbia- Canada.

I hope I didnt set anyone off...my sincerest apologies...Im just a little
excited about this show..and for some reason forgot to put that l'il bit
of info in there...

Well...if you ARE coming make sure you let me know...anyone coming from
out of town gets advance ticket price ($10) at the door, instead of the
'at the door' price ($15).
But you MUST let me know first...there will be no discussing this at the
door.

Thanx in advance...hope to see you there :)

	Do we really want to train girls to be more like boys?  Or should
	we train boys to be more like girls?  I find women in general to 
	be much more CIVIL ( civilized ) than men.  I think a society 
	that is more "woman-like" is preferable to one that is more
	"man-like".  In the history of the world (HOTW), societies as
	they became more "civilized" became less male-oriented and became
	more woman-oriented (or gender neutral).....

	Just a thot....

FYI, I just recently bought (at Fry's in Palo Alto) one of those FM
transmitter thingies you use to get your car CD player to play over
your FM radio. (i used to have a better sounding cassette adapter
but it fried my cassette deck so now i have to use this FM kludge).

Anyways, these devices cost about $20.00 each and I'd imagine that if
you strung a few together with 1/8" stereo extension cables you could
broadcast a signal off the DJ's mixer and allow nearby boomboxes to
pick it up. (Hopefully this would allow us to circumvent any amplified
sound limitations in a park). They run off of 2 AA batteries.

I'd be willing to lend mine to the cause. the fidelity is so-so...

Of course, if someone has one of those radio free berkeley micropower
transmitters, it would probably sound better and work over longer distances.

It sounds like the BBQ idea is shaping up --  some thoughts....

- what if we actually put our BBQ party as part of a Sunset party - i.e. set up
nearby with food etc. and exposed some new people to SFR?  (maybe if not this
time, next time) -- then we don't need to worry about music, and we can add to
the event (unless the Sunset people thought this might be complicating their
lives?)  -- we can be like the "Ravers Auxiliary" of a party

- ditto on the vegan bbq request

- it seems we need one person who'll volunteer to be the coordinator, who people
can reply to who want to help out, who'll keep a checklist, coordinate a
meeting, etc  (sorry, not me, though I can help)

- I'll go wherever needed for planning, but live in Berkeley, so SF would be
easier than peninsula -- but can offer rides in a very comfy car to those who
need 'em

let's make it happen!

I say we need to celebrate our identity as male or female while supporting
each other's identity and individuality.  A "separate but equal" attitude
will help people feel more like human beings first, and male or female
second, and will (hopefully) promote cooperation as opposed to competition.
I'm not aggressive or motivated by the typical male drive to succeed,
because to me, success = happiness, not social standing or material things.
I'll go a step further and say that I feel it's outrageously unfair that
women undergo so much hardship simply because of biology, and (biologically
speaking) males have such an easy life...

We'll definitely need to be sensitive to the needs of people with special
dietary concerns.  I'm basically an omnivore, but I don't eat scrapings
from the slaughterhouse floor (more commonly known as hot dogs), or stuff
that's got more than 1/3 calories from fat (with few exceptions).
I'm up for a meeting, if it's in a location that's not too far from south bay.

been.....

 and then...

>more woman-oriented (or gender neutral)....

here's a story (sorry if it's longwinded)....

When my daughter was born almost 18 years ago, I was determined to dress her
gender-neutrally, treat her gender-neutrally, not inflict any sexual stereotypes
on her.  Imagine my agony when I found myself at Toy R Us at Christmas five
years later buying...  A PLAY KITCHEN!...  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTED!!!!
and she WOULD ONLY WEAR DRESSES!!!!  

Over the years I began to observe and realize that there truly ARE differences
between little boys and little girls (now remember, I only mean for the most
part, that these generalities don't always apply to specific individuals, that's
where we get into trouble...) -- and that's just the reality of it.  Boys and
girls are different, men and women are different -- 

Once I let go of the programming I had received in the 70s that we're all the
same, I saw with a fresh eye that the problem isn't in recognizing the general
differences... the problem is in taking it a step further and making assumptions
that the differences mean that certain people won't be good at certain things --
in setting up expectations about who can do what and why.  

We need the yin and the yang in our society, and we need to develop both sides
in ourselves as well.

So, are men different from women?  Amen, thank you lord, yes they are,
hallelujah!  Are they better, more deserving of power, respect, whatever?  No
way.  Do I want my daughter to be "more like a man"?  Nope, I want her to be
more like an independent, caring, thoughtful, considerate, courageous human
being!  And an awesome woman to boot (which she is, hope you all get to meet
her!) 

This is NOT a lecture in any way - the people on this group are some of the most
enlightened and introspective I've come in contact with, and share some awesome
insights with us all - and that awareness should come out in how we treat each
other  - it's just a perspective from someone who's been travelling on our road
a little longer than some ... 

leslie  : )   (see you all at ComeUnity tonight I hope, look for my big black
hat, silver bracelets and shoulder tattoos)

For all concerned, as I mentioned, I do have a catering company on the side
that specializes in BBQ so there will be more then meat there. I can make
great(IMO) Veggie burgers as well as Stir fried Veggie on a BBQ. So there
will be BBQ food to hopefully pls all. Also I have a portable sink that has
two basins in it for washing and rinsing so we can wash the containers, and
anything else that needs to be washed, that way we don't have dirty dishes
in peoples cars.

Well said.  On the flip-side, men have it much more difficult emotionally 
speaking.  They are not allowed to express feelings in the way women are 
allowed to, risking not seeming "manly."  I always feel bad about this 
for men because I know men who want to break these binds so much and 
aren't allowed to.  And I feel sorry for men who have to live up to the 
impossible image of what society depicts as being a man.  To relate this 
back to raves, as i find myself straying, I've found a lot of men at raves 
who do break this mold.

>From PR NEWSWIRE:

MATTEL ANNOUNCES the latest in their new line of Barbie products, the
"Hacker Barbie." These new dolls will be released next
month. The aim of these dolls is to negate the stereotype that women are
numerophobic, computer-illiterate, and academically challenged.

This new line of Barbie dolls comes equipped with Barbie's very own
X-terminal and UNIX documentation as well as ORA's "In a Nutshell"
series. The Barbie clothing includes a dirty button-up shirt and a pair
of well-worn jeans. Accessories include a Casio all-purpose watch, and
glasses with lenses thick enough to set ants on fire. (Pocket protectors
and HP calculators optional.)

The new Barbie has the incredible ability to stare at the screen without
blinking her eyes and to go without eating or drinking for 16 hours
straight. Her vocabulary mainly consists of technical terms such as
"What's your Internet address?", "I like TCP/IP!", "Bummer! Your kernel
must have gotten trashed," "Can't you grep that file?", and "DEC's Alpha
AXP is awesome!"

"We are very excited about this product," said Ken Olsen, Marketing
Executive, "and we hope that the Hacker Barbie will offset the damage
incurred by the mathophobic Barbie." (A year ago, Mattel released Barbie
dolls that say, "Math is hard," with a condescending companion
Ken.) The Hacker Barbie's Ken is an incompetent management consultant who
frequently asks Barbie for help.

The leading feminists are equally excited about this new line of Barbie
dolls. Naomi Falodji says, "I believe that these new dolls will finally
terminate the notion that womyn are inherently inferior when it comes to
mathematics and the sciences. However, I feel that Ken's
hierarchical superiority would simply reinforce the patriarchy and
oppress the masses." Mattel made no comment.

Parents, however, are worried that they will fall behind the children
technologically when the Hacker Barbie comes out. "My daughter Jenny
plays with the prototype Hacker Barbie for two days," says Mrs. Mary
Carlson of rural Oxford, Mississippi, "and now she pays my credit card
bill online. Got no idea how she does it, but she surely does it. I just
don't wanna be looked upon as some dumb mama." Mattel will be
offering free training courses for those who purchase the Hacker Barbie.

The future Hacker Barbie will include several variations to deal with the
complex aspects of Barbie. "Hacker Barbie Goes to Jail" will teach
computer ethics to youngsters, while "BARBIE RITES L1KE BIFF!!!" will
serve as an introduction to expository writing.

month. That would be March 6th. Anybody know if it will happen and who
will be playing. It's supposed to be "live electronic beat music".

Last month it was awesome with Liquid Acrobat, Terbo Ted, a special

Subject: Random Hug Controversy
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Hey Ravechicks!

How do you feel about random raveboys hugging you at parties?  Of course
one of the most special aspects of the scene is the open acceptance of
everyone and family atmosphere found at the best parties.  However, I can't
help but notice that my new nameless friends have often passed ten other
males on their beeline over to embrace me, a young woman.  Normally I find
physical touching from men without my prior consent to be rather intrusive,
but in these instances I am usually too *ecstatic* to view it from my
"real world" pespective, and instead happily return the hug.  (Although
many times I've been approached by men who I am not attracted to who
immediately enfold me in their arms, without even the benefit of an
introduction).

What do you think?  Are random hugs from guys a manifestation of universal
love, or an exploitation of women on e?

In my e-galitarian moments, I love the thought of hugs being the new form
of introduction.  Why does one need words first, an establishment of a
"relationship," or something in common, before we can show affection?  If
affection came *first*, in the rave scene, and later outside of it, our
world would be transformed!

If these anonymous "hello hugs" *were* common practice among everyone in
the scene, female-to-male, female-to-female, male-to-male, that would be an
amazingly beautiful thing.  But as it stands now, is it just a rave
"pick-up line?"   Or is female defensiveness a vestige of destructive,
outside-world attitudes?

  I find hugs random... there are some people I always hug and it's about
equal between male and female... there are others I sometimes hug  and
still others I never hug.... but I almost never hug anyone without an
introduction and an indication on their part that they want to take part
in an equal experience.

   Speaking as one male if I'm really sexually attracted to a woman I
personally tend to be more shy and LESS likely to hug her than if I look
at the person as just a good friend... thus I never look at hugging as
a sex substitute or a way to say "feel the territory"  but then I'm not
a young male with a "grab all I can get attitude" so you'll never see
me pass up a line of men to get to a woman to hug... 

  On thinking about it - it's really too bad that at least several women
have experienced hugs as a "meat market" thing ( at least once in awhile )
where I've never been aware of hugs in that light... which as far as I'm
concerned is as it should be....

I'm curious, how many people on this list are from the South Bay?  San Jose, 
Santa Clara, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Campbell, etc.? 
 Why isn't there more of a rave scene in the South Bay?  Or is it just more 
underground than in SF?  Maybe it's more u.g. because permits and spaces are 
too difficult to get?

Okay, if the site for an SFR party hasn't been determined, here's a
possibly unrealistic, yet hopefully possible idea: what about
Tilden Park in the Berkeley Hills?  There are several wide-open grassy
areas there, it's absolutely beautiful, there's Lake Anza, plenty
of sweeping views, parking, and it's pretty empty (no houses very close
by, so probably no noise complaints).  
If anyone else who puts on outdoor parties sees this, they should
check it out as a possible site.  Everytime my friends and I go 
wandering around the trails up there, we always go, "God, this would be
*such* a great place for a rave!"

Sorry to waste bandwith with this problem, but is *everyone* getting 
screwy email posts or is it just me?  My email takes 4ever to go through

Myself, I welcome hugs from all; male or female alike as long as they are 
quick "hello" hugs.  I do find it intrusive if they are lingering hugs.

Unfortunately, I do think some people take advantage of the "scene" & hug 
people longer than they should because they think they can get away with 
it!  Because "e" is a part of the "scene", I think some people try to get 
their thrills or "cop a feel", thinking the other person will be too open 
in their altered state!  Too bad there are people like that out there!!

Overall...I say "hug-away" but make it a quick "hello hug"!!

There are a lot of South Bay ravers!  I grew up in Santa Clara, and have
lived in Sunnyvale, Campbell, and now San Jose.  The Crew are South Bay
inhabitants (my "core group" of party-going friends), too.
My understanding is that there's too much gangsta element in the South Bay,
and that discourages people from throwing parties :(  But Harmony goes off
quite frequently in this area, so the South Bay gets at least SOME
activity...

I feel the same way.  And, though they usually don't mention it, I hope
that males enjoy my Erichugs as much as females, because those who allow me
to give the full-on Erichug always respond positively.

(now, how does the ASCII hug go again?)

well, i generally think hugs are pretty nice and innocent adn friendly at 
raves, and is the guy is particularly touchy or icky, o' drag, its just a 
random bad seed.  I like hugging everyone even just as an introduction, 
but we must be sensitive to others preceptions.  unfortuantly we do have 
to be cuatious, but lets not be defensive.  

HUGZ HUGZ HUGZ :)   Jamie

Here's my perspective, based on experience and personal preference:

Introductions are better, then the hugs can follow once the names are known.

Universal love, of course!  (What about exploitation of men on e?  Not that
I feel that way, just making a point :) )

It's not a pick-up line with anyone I know, because we don't go to parties
to pick up on people, but to make new friends and spread love and joy.
Defensiveness, whether male or female, is indeed a vestige of destructive,
outside-world attitudes, if by that you mean the outside-the-rave-community
outside world.

Speak up, guys!

I have a biamped sound system-- Community csx-52s for top cabinets 
(3-ways with 15 inch woofer), ashley x-over, incredible BGW amp and crown 
macrotech amp. Would need some sub-cabinets and a monitor system if a DJ 
was spinning

        yeah, i think this is a very accurate perception of how men are
conditioned. I know for myself that it was 'bad' to cry when i was growing
up, and that when you faced difficult situations you couldn't allow
yourself to crawl into bed with your blankie and suck your thumb and...oh
ok, sorry, i'm getting off topic.
        There is something to be said, however, about a 'female' that can
accurately understand the male conditioning, right? I was just mentioning
to a friend today how much art school drove me insane because, in the never
ending post-structuralist-whatever quest to break down barriers of gender,
more barriers were set up. I was told i 'couldn't' understand what it was
like to be anything but a (semi) straight white young english speaking
male. Couldn't is a nasty word, i think, and since i've graduated i've
found that i can actually relate better to females than to males a lot of
times. Go figure!
        But, yeah, i don't want to place TOO much importance on this but
there is a little thing out there that i've seen men do (at raves or at
home) that has allowed them to tap into their emotional selves a lot
better, and break down those self and socially-imposed walls that hold
emotion back, and laugh and cry and tell people that they love them and
sweat a lot and, well, i for one think that this is a good thing. I think
we're all androgynous souls in gendered bodies and sometimes one can get a
reminder of it, even if it's 'only a chemical' and/or 'only a dance party.'
:)

        peace,
                brad

        You hit the nail on the head, IMHO. Yin and Yang. WHat i've figure
out is that the difference between _this_ kind of duality, and the kind of
Cartesian duality that is so prevelant in western society (as most of our
ideas and beliefs are traced back through the enlightenment to rome and
greece, etc) is that with Cartesian dualisms there is an implicit "better"
and "worse" attributed to things, a heirarchy. Culture is better than
nature, male is better than female, intellect and rationality is better
than emotion and irrationality. And so on ad infinitum. Thing is, you need
to understand the one to understand the other, and the one defines the
other (of course, i'm now using the dialectic of 'one' and 'other' in order
to try to get the idea that these dialectics suck! but such is language).
        I found much beauty and androgyny and confusion and chaos (those
last two are 'good' things, IMHO) and shifting within the rave scene as far
as gender and gender roles but we can always evolve so much further! :)
        peace,
                brad

ps-->now, of course, i just posited a duality (western vs. eastern) and
said that the eastern was better, so i am still falling into that old trap!
;) I suppose valuing the characteristics of both is what i'm gettin' at :)

I live in Sunnyvale too ("The Model City"). I can see you from my
window, Marisa. Hiiiiiiiiiii :)

Was that a Harmony about a month or so ago that was somewhere over by
Almaden Expressway (87)? Anybody go to that? I went up to SF that
night. I guess I just find it difficult to believe that I'd enjoy a
party that went off down here.

I'd just as well drive up to SF. I love SF, wish I could get a job
there. In the "Model City", everyone's to bed right after prime time,
right Marisa, right Eric? You can still sneak out at 1am and drive up
to SF like I do :)

I guess there is a fundamental difference in sex-drive between men and
women (on e or not). This colours the whole hugging experience somewhat.
The problem is that many people who joined the rave-scene while it was
already going on for a while might have gotten an introduction like:
"And you know what, everbody can just hug everybody and it's OK". Although
this is as far as I'm concerned true most of the time, in some cases
I've seen men taking advantage of that concept, or actually getting into
raving because of the lowered social and especially sexual inhibitions.

Here I feel you speak for yourself and the relatively small number of people
on this list. These are people concerned with keeping the spirit of raving
alive. There is a whole bunch of people out there who don't really understand.
Personally I save the full-body hug for friends, male or female. In the case
when I meet people for the first time, I usually first spend some time with
them talking, dancing, whatever. If there is a connection, the hugs usually
comes anyway and also in this case I do not differntiate between males or
females (being a straight guy). With complete strangers I usually limit myself
to a friendly pet on the shoulder or arm (after due time).

I just wanted to thank all of the people that responded to my question 
about mixes on CD.  I went to solid grooves, but they didn't have many, 
if any mixes on CD.  So I ended up  buying a few more tapes to add to 
my collection. The Simon mix from the Unity rave (1-3-96, 12-2 PM) really 
kicks. I also got this really funky mix by this guy, Hardkiss I 
can't remember his first name, but his slow groooooven beats and perfect 
mixes are unlike anything that I've heard before. After I bought the 
tapes I went to Tower records where I saw a few mixes by Tribal records 
and a series called DJ's take control.  When I get more money I'll go 
ckeck some of them out.  Talk to you all later.

 I'm a guy and I hug a lot of people, male or female.  For me, hugging is 
my way of showing affection for my fellow raver as well as the human 
race.  Where else in the world is there a place with people that open 
with feelings and emotions.  Raves are places to make friends, and hugging
is a great way of meeting somebody.  Plus hugges feel soooooooo good!

I think folks need to focus on the R in PLUR. Practice your sensitivity 
and try to sense if the other person is wanting/needing a hug. Then ask!! 
Asking is esiential if you do not know the person and you wish to respect 
them as a human being (not as a pet that you can grab anytime you want).
Some people are freaked out by personal contact and may have problems 
respecting YOU if you just grab them. I think anyone who touchs anyone in 
an unwelcome matter is gross and immature!! On the plus side if one is 
approached and touched in an unwelcome manner one can then learn to gain 
strength and experience in a distasteful situation which may be of help 
in the future.

I hope this year, rave camp will be a motor home of RVs. The two Organic 
brought up last year had such an odd feel to them out there. I don't 
know. There is somthing about going out to the playa, where you can 
experience something and not sit in an air conditioned portable piece of 
the city. Then again, maybe those experiences aren't for everyone or 
maybe people just don't want to experience them because mechinized 
comfort has engrained itself so well in our culture.

 As for where I've lived in the South Bay - Mountain View first , then San
Jose , and now Sunnyvale.

 As for a South Bay scene - I'll have to say that I've been really poor
about searching one out. There used to be the occasional thing at a place
called One Step Beyond , but that place closed. Some other things I
heard of got busted. There was a bar near the train tracks that had
something on Sundays - but ???? Velvet Shop is still on Thursdays , but
I haven't checked it out in a long time , not because of anything
negative I've heard.

 I don't think it's fair to include Santa Cruz and Monterey in the 
"South Bay" catagory. Seems those folks have more sites to choose from. 

 Maybe it's really underground , and I'm completely unaware of some wild
alien plant of a South Bay scene happening right in my town or down the
street.  

 On the other hand , maybe getting out of the South Bay is one appeal of
going to out-of-town raves!  :-) 

 I know some of the folks at Solid Grooves check out SFRaves - what do
you folks say ?

I was actually thinking the same thing myself, back when FnF held their 
daytime thing.  I had wondered if it was possible that it could be held 
there.  And i do think it would be cool!  There's a lotta areas with 
picnic tables & such, I'm sure there's a perfect spot somewhere in 
there with picnic tables & lotsa grassy areas to play in without being 
near too many other people.  Does anybody know if this is a feasible 
spot?

An idea I had while reading the hugs thread-

wouldn't it be great if we knew every one's name before we walked up to
him/her to talk to them ~telepathical maybe~
  It is very hard to get any info while wild, crazy, fantastic music is
echoing through your head.  Try getting a name from some one by a speaker
is virtually imposible...I once thought a guy named Jack was offering me
crack..

maybe just paint your name on your forehead... we can skip the intro and go
straight to the hug...:-D

This may be old hat, but I'd like to know if there are any dance tracks 
out there that sample Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song".  I think the intro 
drums and eerie wails would sound incredible with the right techno edge.
If I were making such a track I think I might call it "The Immigrants 
Arrive At The Promised Land."   8)

Actually, the original author of this post was using general language to 
refer to a rather amusing (in retrospect, at least)  personal experience he 
had, and as far as I know, had no intention of excluding anyone or 
assuming anything about anyone else.  

He's a very open-minded guy, trust me :)

   CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (AP) -- The satellite that broke free from space
shuttle Columbia will be visible next week to people looking skyward in 
cities across the country.
   The satellite and its dangling 12-mile cord will be visible to the naked
eye just before sunrise as it travels through the sky, from the West Coast 
to the East.
   "It should be an absolutely awesome sight because the 20 kilometers of
tether, assuming that it's all strung out, will be definitely visible," 
astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman said Tuesday from space shuttle Columbia.
   "It will be the only time for most people that they'll ever be able to
see something in Earth orbit that's other than a point of light. They'll 
actually see a line moving through the sky," he said.
   Here is a list, provided by NASA, of some major cities over which the
satellite will fly. The satellite is traveling in an elliptical orbit, 
between 200 and 250 miles above Earth.
   Times shown are local. The duration of each sighting will be from one to
three minutes.

	Yep, the place does get quiet fairly early on, but I like that. Means if
I'm not up to staying up late (and on non-rave nights I try to be in bed by 10:30)
that I don't get disturbed... And SanFran is just a cool place, besides... :-)

I'm getting a few replies on locations. Right now I'm putting them on a list
and it will be part of the meeting on the 13th. So if I don't reply to you
about your suggestions, don't worry, I have taken note of them. Also I would
like to get as many people to come to the meeting as possible. This meeting
will involve meeting new people for one, talking about locations, If we
should keep the date of April 20th, DJ's, Sound systems, Food, Drinks, who
can bring what, what to ask people to bring, and whatever else comes to mind
at the meeting. So if you plan to attend and havn't e-mailed me yet please
do so, that way I can get an ruff count on how many people will show up. If
you would like to help with the planning but can't make it to the meeting
please let me know. If it's because of a ride needed, we might be able to
work out a ride for you. If it's because you have other plans that day, let
me know and I can email you all the info that was gathered at the meeting. I
will also want to have one or two more meetings to get last minute details
and for people that want to help that couldn't make the 1st one. If you
would like to call me, my number is 408-738-4443. Thanks

David (from sfraves) treated us to a great get together to view
the rave drama "loved up" last night.

"Loved Up" was written by a raver for the BBC.  It was the first
movie or TV show I have ever seen to have a plot based around a
somewhat accurate depiction of the rave scene.  The plot revolved
around young women who comes from a troubled home (single, alcoholic
mother) and brushes with the scene.

It only takes about 5 minutes into the show before they are doing
thier first hit of e together.  This scene flashed through various
phases of their trip, with extremely realistic accuracy.  I wouldn't
be suprised if they were actually doing e for the scene.  "do you
feel it yet... it takes about 35 minutes", "My jaw is a little sore,
let me get you some gum", "Let's drink some water... we don't want
to get dried out", "I gotta move".  and the next day "It does not
matter what else happens in my life, I have had the best evening ever"

One of the things I like about the movie was the characters.  They were
not punk kids.  Instead, they were responible, young adults trying to
make it through life and have some fun along the way.  The main guy 
was in is early 20's, lived in a nice artistic loft, and owned or managed
a toy store (with a good supply of coosh balls).  The girl was kind
of stuck in a service job.

The main girl (sorry, I forgot all the character's names) sees various
aspects of the ecstasy scene, both good and bad.  She has good experiences
having fun with her new raver friends... One scene they find a mis-handled
bag of mail... and hand deliver letter containing good news... and discard
bills.  They end up at many clubs that actually look like raves!  But, she
sees some dark sides of the scene also.  They get stopped by the police
and have their car searched (they get out of it).  She gets involved with
an unscrupulus e dealer.  He tells her there are 3 pills he sells... the 
pure stuff for his friends and the people he sees on a regular basis...
the "spiked" ones that give a rush then sort of fizzle out... and then
the "dummies" for when he knows he will never see the people again.  This
dealer gets the girl involved in selling and she sees the a dark side
of the drug culture.  While on a deal she gets roughed up by a rival
dealer... and the dealer she is involved with tries to rape her at a party.
Yeah, not fun stuff at all.  The dealer gives a little final speech, saying
something to the effect of "this whole society is on the verge of total
collapse... you will have to be tough and know how to survive... you weak
people better be wearing helmets."  

On another level, the show deals with a common aspect of e- how it can
create relationships based on the e experience.  The "good" guy parties
with the girl for a while, but they really don't have a relationship beyond
the e scene.  He makes it clear what the relationship is about... but it
is still painful for the girl.  She moves out of her troubled home
and sort of emotionally neglects her little sister... who (with a drunk
for a mom) has no one else to look up to.  But, the girl tries really
hard to stay in the scene with her new boyfriend, and take care of her
sister (and take care of her mom also).

If you have not guessed by now, this show was a melodrama about the rave
scene.  It got a little cheezy, but it was still amazing to watch a show
that I felt accurately described a lot of the e scene.  Of course, I didn't
like the dealer trying to rape the girl... but remember that this is a 
BCC show... they can't be all rosey about the rave scene.  Oh, and speaking
of the BCC, this show had _detailed_ sex scenes that would barely slip into
an "R" movie stateside... those crazy brits.

Anyway, "loved up" was an interesting movie that was obviously written by 
someone who had a good idea about what the rave scene is all about.  All I 
can say is that from watching that movie, the whole e scene in England must be
pretty darn mainstream.  A very stark contrast to how raves get into the
media here.

Hey gang,

     Lets see... if you are looking for something to do in the south bay area,
it is true that we can't have all nighters do to lack of an after hours permit
for SJ.  But, There is something to do a few nights of the week.  

Tuesdays:     Deep Space at Greg's Ballroom
This is spuns gig and it has featured Djs  like Markie, Doc, Jeno, Rick
Preston, and next week Ernie.

Thursdays:   The Velvet Shop at the 4th St. bowl
This party is in a cool little lounge area and has featured Garth, Jeno, Rick
Preston, Harry Who?, and various other local Djs

Fridays:       
This Friday a party called Smashing  it will be held at the Usual (F/X)
Every Friday after that Souled Out which is Rick and Julius' party it features
them and local Djs

Sundays:     Quench at the Usual
This is SJs newest party and has been doing quite well.  It's resident Djs are
Rick Preston and Ryan Tapia.  They feature big name Djs and locals every week.
 In fact... This Sunday I will be playing with Mark Farina, so please come on
down and check it out.  I think it will be worth your while.

If this doesn't do it for you, go down to Solid Grooves on Bascom, they have
many fliers and always know what is going on in the South Bay.


Peace for now...
                     Tamotsu

 As for where I've lived in the South Bay - Mountain View first , then San
Jose , and now Sunnyvale.

 As for a South Bay scene - I'll have to say that I've been really poor
about searching one out. There used to be the occasional thing at a place
called One Step Beyond , but that place closed. Some other things I
heard of got busted. There was a bar near the train tracks that had
something on Sundays - but ???? Velvet Shop is still on Thursdays , but
I haven't checked it out in a long time , not because of anything
negative I've heard.

 I don't think it's fair to include Santa Cruz and Monterey in the 
"South Bay" catagory. Seems those folks have more sites to choose from. 

 Maybe it's really underground , and I'm completely unaware of some wild
alien plant of a South Bay scene happening right in my town or down the
street.  

 On the other hand , maybe getting out of the South Bay is one appeal of
going to out-of-town raves!  :-) 

 I know some of the folks at Solid Grooves check out SFRaves - what do
you folks say ?

I was actually thinking the same thing myself, back when FnF held their 
daytime thing.  I had wondered if it was possible that it could be held 
there.  And i do think it would be cool!  There's a lotta areas with 
picnic tables & such, I'm sure there's a perfect spot somewhere in 
there with picnic tables & lotsa grassy areas to play in without being 
near too many other people.  Does anybody know if this is a feasible 
spot?

Love,
Shawna

well, i generally think hugs are pretty nice and innocent adn friendly at 
raves, and is the guy is particularly touchy or icky, o' drag, its just a 
random bad seed.  I like hugging everyone even just as an introduction, 
but we must be sensitive to others preceptions.  unfortuantly we do have 
to be cuatious, but lets not be defensive.

Every fuckup has a silver lining... thanks NASA...

   CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (AP) -- The satellite that broke free from space
shuttle Columbia will be visible next week to people looking skyward in 
cities across the country.
   The satellite and its dangling 12-mile cord will be visible to the naked
eye just before sunrise as it travels through the sky, from the West Coast 
to the East.
   "It should be an absolutely awesome sight because the 20 kilometers of
tether, assuming that it's all strung out, will be definitely visible," 
astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman said Tuesday from space shuttle Columbia.
   "It will be the only time for most people that they'll ever be able to
see something in Earth orbit that's other than a point of light. They'll 
actually see a line moving through the sky," he said.
   Here is a list, provided by NASA, of some major cities over which the
satellite will fly. The satellite is traveling in an elliptical orbit, 
between 200 and 250 miles above Earth.
   Times shown are local. The duration of each sighting will be from one to
three minutes.

I have a biamped sound system-- Community csx-52s for top cabinets 
(3-ways with 15 inch woofer), ashley x-over, incredible BGW amp and crown 
macrotech amp. Would need some sub-cabinets and a monitor system if a DJ 
was spinning

Thanks to everyone for responding to my keyboard, headphone, record, 
and floyd question.  You have all been a huge help in answering my 
questions.  I have my work cut out for me in locating a keyboard as 
well as those rising high records.  As for headphones it sounds like 
Sony is the popular choice.  Thanks again!

love chris

I hope this year, rave camp will be a motor home of RVs. The two Organic 
brought up last year had such an odd feel to them out there. I don't 
know. There is somthing about going out to the playa, where you can 
experience something and not sit in an air conditioned portable piece of 
the city. Then again, maybe those experiences aren't for everyone or 
maybe people just don't want to experience them because mechinized 
comfort has engrained itself so well in our culture.

I live in Sunnyvale too ("The Model City"). I can see you from my
window, Marisa. Hiiiiiiiiiii :)

Was that a Harmony about a month or so ago that was somewhere over by
Almaden Expressway (87)? Anybody go to that? I went up to SF that
night. I guess I just find it difficult to believe that I'd enjoy a
party that went off down here.

I'd just as well drive up to SF. I love SF, wish I could get a job
there. In the "Model City", everyone's to bed right after prime time,
right Marisa, right Eric? You can still sneak out at 1am and drive up
to SF like I do :)

I don't know if I am getting psychic or if I am having flashbacks or 
what, but it seems like I keep getting random postings to this group two 
or even three times...  Sometimes I even get a reply to a post as much as 
a whole day before I get the original post...
Should I go seek professional help, or are these the strange EMAILings 
that others have been speaking of?

I finally ended up going to Come-Unity for a couple of hours.  I am so 
glad I did.  It felt so good to dance and feel the abundant energy in the 
air.  It was a really wonderful party.  The crowd was great, different 
than your usual rave, but great none-the-less.  I had to leave around 
2:30, so I imagine it got even better at that point. Sorry I had to miss 
that.  I loved all of the ppl dancing on the stage behind the dj.  They 
were so happy and gave it such a tribal feeling.  

One sad thing happened, although not related to the party.  On my way out 
two men were harrassing a homeless man.  The homeless man was the 
rastafari-type guy who had incense in his hair and very colorful 
clothes.  My friend and I walked by as the two men got out of their car.  
The homeless man asked them for a penny.  They mocked him and said they 
"didn't have a fucking penny."  But "they did have 25 pennies" and then 
proceeded to throw a quarter at the man.  The whole incident was so 
shocking.  I couldn't believe how angry the men were.  Feeling very sad
at how they had treated a fellow human being who was less fortunate than 
themselves, and treating this like it was a crime, made me react instantly.
I ran back to the man and gave him a dollar and told him that not all 
human beings are so cruel.  I know a dollar isn't anything, but all human 
beings deserve dignity and respect, and I hoped that he could at least 
acknowledge that some of us respect others in such a way.  I know I 
didn't solve any of the world's problems, but I am so glad I did

I still don't comprehend the anger of the two men.  It is so bizarre and 
foreign to me.  Especially coming out of the joy of Come-Unity to be 
thrust once again abruptly into reality.  Anyway,  I am rambling...

	This happens to me as well, I see the response several days ahead of

I don't really think so.

I have a friend who is a big PF fan. In my case, ecept from some of Sid's solo works and "let's make love in London" the Floyd does not say a word to me.

I remember him telling me that Syd lives with his mom, who has to take care of him until today. They live mostly from $$$ from his songs and albums. He kinda freaked out, really, and he hardly does anything else except watching TV.

There were various attempts to treat him, but, for some reason, he seems too distant to come back to real life. I don't think he would have probably been a raver now, or even into the rave scene, but I am quite sure some of his ideas are present on some of the world's Rave scenes.

I usually wear a bright green butterfly on a darker green ribbon, and on
one side it has my name (so I'll remember who I am :) ).  If anyone can't
catch my name for the noise, I show the name side.

You said:
Here I feel you speak for yourself and the relatively small number of people
on this list. These are people concerned with keeping the spirit of raving
alive. There is a whole bunch of people out there who don't really understand.
Personally I save the full-body hug for friends, male or female. In the case
when I meet people for the first time, I usually first spend some time with
them talking, dancing, whatever. If there is a connection, the hugs usually
comes anyway and also in this case I do not differntiate between males or
females (being a straight guy). With complete strangers I usually limit myself
to a friendly pet on the shoulder or arm (after due time).

I say:
Very good points!  I never want to scare anyone, and my hugs are NEVER
meant to carray any kind of sexual connotation.  I just think it's a better
expression of acceptance and friendliness than a handshake, but I'm still
careful not to force it.

Wow!  What you went through totally sucks!!!  It's 100% wrong for someone
to "reach out and touch" the way you described.  I've seen gals being taken

doesn't look like the gal objects, maybe she's in no condition to do
anything about it.  I would rush to the defense of someone who was being
bothered (without fighting, of course), because that's not in the spirit of
what we're trying to promote, is it?
When I meet you, (all of you) I'll ask you name, and how ya doin', give my
name, and if the mood strikes me, I'll either extend my arms in a hugging
gesture or ask if you'd like a hug, and whether or not you agree, I'll
respond with RESPECT.  Believe it!

Oh!  That would be soooooo coooooool!!!  Led Zeppelin is my all-time
favorite band, and I'd get off like nobody's business if I heard ANY Zep at
a party (didn't know other ravers liked it)!  I can totally hear that intro
used as a build-up, looped so it can go over and over as the beats pummel
us, and that wail...I hope someone picks up on the idea and runs with it :)

Thanx,

hey, i'm trying to get a sample of thee-o online, it's at
  
http://hyperreal.com/~scruton/bio.html

BUT, everyone who tries it says it's corrupted!

the weird thing is, MY pc at home and my workstation are BOTH
  playing the sample just fine.

it's a WAV file, and it's at 16kHz stereo.

is there anything wrong with the sample rate or the fact that
  there are two channels maybe?

(is there a sample guru in the house!!!)

I haven't heard any Zep remakes within the scene yet.  I'm totally
interested, though!  The song is called "Babe, I'm gonna leave you" and
appears in it's original form on Led Zeppelin I.  It's an excellent example
of what they were into: light and shade, dynamics of soft, sweet sounds and
powerful thunder, and influences from the blues.
If you can stomach this, Great White covered the song on an MTV Unplugged,
and for a cover it sounded wonderful!
So, you gonna mix the mighty Zep?  Go for it, and keep me posted!

:)

hi all,

i think a nice gesture is to ask... if you feel the energy is right 
and the person is accepting to that.  you can't assume that everyone's 
boundaries are the same as yours.  when you respect another's boundaries 
out of love and concern for them, it can make you feel just as good as 
giving them an actual hug.  IMHO, it's not the form (the hug)  but the 
energy (feeling warm and fuzzy).

brenda :)

Hey, y'all!

        My friend Kirsten, who works at City E (City Espresso), asked if I
new anything about djs Jeno, Mark Farina, and Barry Weaver, 'cause she's
interested in going to Evolution.  I couldn't really recall what they
sounded like.  Can someone please tell me what their styles are (what to
expect)?  Very much thank you!

 i agree...but, recently i went to a party in portland, one love,
where i met these two young women.  they had never been to a rave before
and were experiencing an intense level of consciousness that they had
never felt before.  i let them play with my teddy bear for a while and
talked with them...after about a half our they weren't experiencing
things so intensely and i was able to hold their hands  and they loved
the feeling of contact.  then i asked them if they wanted to hug (I know
that this feels wonderful, but they had never experienced any of this
before) and they loved it.  i journeyed with them until they got to a
level of comfort respected their need to take everything in slower than
i.  it was a beautiful experience.

One of my favorite (and early) moments with raving was at a party (maybe it was
a Wicked?) at the Trocadero,and Thomas closed with a Led Zeppelin song - hardly
mixed at all, just full-on-listen-to-this and it was awesome (what party was
that, Allen @ Ameba? that first time I met you?)

I LOVE hearing powerful non-rave music played at the volume with the bass that
we are so used to, it makes you really stop and listen in a whole new way!

Thomas played Jimi Hendrix (it was Thomas I think) at Wicked last week in the
same way ....

...I always like to hear the unexpected! ....


Leslie  : )

p.s.  and on the hug track ... some people are natural born huggers, and others
(myself included) have to work to remember how important it is -- frankly, I
love when people hug me if they're doing it freely and without hidden agendas
(up-front agendas can be ok) after all, doesn't it mean they like me? -- last
night I got goosed at ComeUnity, yep, seriously, and it was sort of fun!  (He
had an impish look on his face) -- but on the other end of the scalre, I was
practically accosted by someone else whose hugs weren't welcome (and thanks to
Allen for his safe-arm-hugs which protected me from that!)

Hi there. I've only posted a few times before, but now it's time to
get serious. =)

Are there any people on this list from the Santa Rosa area? I live just
outside SR, and without a car it's kinda hard to get to all the events
down in SF. I would really love to go, and if anyone wants to take me
some time, I'll be more than happy to pay for gas.

Also, if you ever meet me at an event, don't worry, I won't hug you. I'm
way too shy to do something like that...unless YOU hug me of course... ;)

dj e

p.s. hey, if you live in the SR area, and you can get KSUN (91.5fm), make
sure you check out the techno show every Friday night 9pm-Midnight. =)

I'm actually kinda surprised at the number of people who are kinda 
"stand-offish" (just cause I can't think of a better word right now!) 
about immediate hugs, I totally end up operating on a different level 
entirely when it comes to hugs at raves.  It's purely instinctual for 
me, and it has always appeared to be the case with the person I'm 
hugging also.  Some people I just give regular hugs to, and then 
sometimes there are people whom when I meet them we practically 
immediately fall into each others arms for the full body-hug 
experience, and it's never discussed before-hand, there just seems to 
be a connection like that with some people & not with others.  And when 
that happens, it's that way for both of us, we both instinctively know 
(somehow!) that it's ok for us to do this.  I never even stopped to 
think about it, until reading this thread.  Sometimes this happens with 
people I've wanted to meet for a while, & then sometimes it will just 
suddenly randomly happen to someone I've never met or heard of but just 
happened to run into at a rave, male & female both.  And in these 
people I have never encountered any sort of hidden sexual agenda "bad 
vibe" from them, it appears that it never crossed either of our minds.  
For me, that's just so completely not what it's about, & it appears to 
be that way for the person I'm with when that happens.  But I've never 
thought about it till now, it's all been completely instinctual.  
Interesting!  I've always just sorta known that with some people it's 
cool, & some people it's not as cool until you know them better, to the 
best of my knowledge that hasn't failed me so far (knock on wood!).  
But then of course, I am myself female and it's probably a hell of a 
lot easier for women to randomly run around hugging people of all ilks 
than for men to do so, as has been previously mentioned, the ol' famous 
double standard!

Hugzzz galore! (four hundred something, to be exact, one for each 
person on the list!)

Love,
Shawna

Firstly, thanks to everyone who came out to my place to see "Loved
Up,"  I had a great time sharing that!  Troy, good synopsis.
Jon has courteously provided a space for presenting "Loved Up" on the
Stanford campus Saturday night at 7:30.  It's in a campus lounge, so
there should be plenty of room.  E-mail me for directions.  I hope to
see lots of people there too.

Actually this used to happen more at parties. In the toon town days at
Townsend both bathrooms became co-ed pretty quickly, though there were
always lines in the women's room.  it generally became a question of 
choice, the "men's room" had fewer lines but was messy, the "women's room"
had long lines but was cleaner :)

More scummy guys come to parties now who ar more apt to take advantage
of a situation like this so I think you see less of it.

I had a buddy who was very Exstatic try to use the ladies restroom at a 
come unity (?) show at Richmand (?) (the place right next to the police 
station :(  :)   ) and the security that night were being real jerks. 
They were trying to through my buddy out and lots of us (ladies included) 
were trying to talk the nazis out of it. Unfortunatly my pal had to leave :(

duh, what's the difference between the phono and line inputs on a mixing 
board?  are they calibrated to handle levels differently?  could I plug a 
CD player into the phono line if I have to?

Phono lines are at a different line level (and may be calibrated with a 
different 'zero' level) And have an eq filter to adjust for eqing done 
(when the lp is cut) on lps so that phat bass lines or cymbal crashes do 
not cause the needle to go into orbit. The inverse of this eqing is 
applied with the phono input in order to restore the 'orignal' sound.
Not a good idea to put CD line in phono and vica versa.

I am pretty sure that's it.  If I run one of my turntables straight 
into the cd in on my receiver, the level is extremely low no matter how 
high I crank it.  But if I run it to the phono in on the receiver, it 
sounds fine.

> could I plug a CD player into the phono line if I have to?

Probably, but given what I noticed above, I would be extremely careful
when you first play something through.  Apparently, cd line level is
*way* higher than phono line level. 

Let me know how it goes...

sometimes at raves, i do go around and hug random strangers, men and 
women, and ive always believed in being the last to let go in a hug.
ive always thought of that to be  a sign of affection saying, "i care 
about this experience, and about you (the hugged), on whatever level" and 
ive made quite a few friends that stared out with a good hug at random.

sometimes those weak hugs that are quick just seem to leave me with this 
"whatever, empty" feeling, cuz im used to a lot of energy passing in a 
good hug. reading all these posts i realize ya all see it so differently!
which isnt good or bad, and im glad to be aware of it.

i tend to be non sexual, but really affectionate, when in a good mood or 
in that 'other' state o consciousness. i pretty much leave it up to 
instinc at that point, 
hope i dont offend anyone...
tha mad hugger,
tom

Hi gang

In looking at the email headers from an original message and a duplicate,
it appears that someone's machine at a company that starts with an X was
bouncing email back to the list after a few hours of delay.  Looks like
it's stopped for now.  :)  Duplicate messages may be seen for the next
24 hours or so, until the offending machine gets caught up.  Just please
stand by...

Most of you I don't know, and there's good reason.  I moved to the Santa
Cruz area last July for a job from the Cincinnati area.  I haven't had a
whole lot of time to do the rave thing, but I've been to a handful of
parties.  So if you see me at a party, please do say hi, as I only know
a handful of you.  :)

Claims to fame: Um, started the mw-raves list, got "drafted" to help out
with hyperreal.com early on after it started, ran vrave for a bit,
bought some cds here and there, etc etc.

I am glad to be living in Santa Cruz, though.  I've got a nice job, a
decent place to live (but it's expensive), I saw snow once (when I went home
for the holidaze to Ohio), $25 electric bills (just wish the power was more
constant, rather than blinky), etc etc.  I do miss home, family, and my
friends, though.

The weirdest thing was being that that FnF back in October in Oakland.  It
felt like a rave from home, where I'd know maybe 10-20 people and recognize
a bunch of faces.  But out here, I only knew a handful.  Felt like a
Twiglight Zone.  :)

Just for the record!  I love hugging!

And I don't let the few hugs that have felt "weird" wreck all hugs!

The vast majority of the people that I have met through this list have been (in
my opinion) fairly enlightened, caring people.  Enlightened people who think
and feel empathy are not the selfish types who give "weird" feeling hugs!  I've
taken part in "random hugs" that were WONDERFUL!  One can tell the difference
between the "warm, fuzzy" hugs and the "hot and claustrophobic" hugs.

My favorite hugs are the ones that start out with two or three people, but wind
up with many more.  I especially like the ones where everyone hums, and you can
hear the changes in pitch and tone when new people join in.  I'm not explaining
that very well, but do you know what I mean?

warm, fuzzy hugs to y'all

  I just wanted to add that although I think one should ask before giving 
hugs to strangers (unless one is VERY sure that the reciever wouldn't 
mind) I am totally thrilled by getting hugs from strangers-- assuming of 
course that they are relativly clean :)  Of course the more E the les 
clean they have to be =)

On the "whatever, empty" feeling note, at Planet Rock I got the same 
thing.  While I was surrounded by a group of really happy people, they 
weren't necessarily friendly.  So I was already tripping, literally, on 
that idea and wondering why i wasn't really connecting with anyone 
(mainly because I was just content and not particuarly outgoing-just 
enjoying the surrounding energy), anywhoo, this fellow comes up and give 
one of those weak hugz and says isn't this the best vibe here?  Since I 
was already thinking of that and his hug didn't live up to his words I 
just said "yeah, i guess".  I hope he did not take it in a negative way, 
but it just seemed a bit hypocrytical...well, I still love hugs, I just 
want to feel 'em, ya know?

Sean;

At first I was appalled by your posting,  (it was a really stereotypical =

viewpoint,) but instead I chose to view it as an opportunity to =

enlighten you to another perspective that is out there, and perhaps even =

turn you on to some scientific research findings that will be =

interesting to you.  =


Coping the anonymous feel,(done either to a man or to a woman,) is not =

about affection, it is about power and objectifying the person you=92re =

"feeling up".   Men are socially conditioned to view this as a =

compliment, while most women these days are aware that it is invasive.  =

I believe that men who receive such invasive treatment have the same =

feelings as women have about it, but don=92t want to risk appearing =

"unmanly,"  and instead project the facade that they enjoy it.
 =

Current research has found that both men and women are equally excited =

sexually by visual stimulus.  But, the women participating in the study =

reported their level of sexual excitement to be very low, even though =

the monitoring equipment proved that they were having the same intensity =

of arousal as the men in the study, and, that it took both men and women =

about the same length of time to become aroused even though the men in =

the study remarked early on that they were feeling aroused, and the =

women reported their excitement level as being less, and later.  (I can =

supply the article about this study if you want to have it.)

So why does there seem to be a marked difference in real life?  Perhaps =

again it is our social conditioning to gender roles.  Men have always =

been encouraged by our culture to act on visual stimulus, while women =

have been conditioned by their families and their community to deny =

their very real, sexual responses.  =


As for the bathroom thing, when you have to go you have to go.  =

Expediency is the real issue here. Because of the feeling of community =

and PLUR that happens at raves, its obvious that both men and women =

generally feel okay about sharing accommodations.  I have seen men in =

the women=92s=92 bathrooms at raves, but usually if you=92re a guy, and you=
 =

don=92t need to sit down on a toilet seat to do your business, going to =

the men=92s room will guarantee a shorter, faster line. =


Lets face it, gender differences between men and women are very real.  =

Part of being CONCIOUS in the 90=92s requires that we acknowledge that men =

and women are humans, influenced by our own particular biologies, but =

also more strongly influenced by our societal gender roles, overt and =

unspoken.  =


I would also like to add here that I think the rave community has done a =

good job of bringing the new consciousness into our everyday life.    =

Ravers question their world, and bring fresh perspectives to old =

viewpoints.

Huh?  Bilogically speaking?  er, may I point out that females live longer
in this society.  Men are prone to plenty of stess and dietary related
diseases that shorten our life span.

As a matter of fact the boundaries are sociological, not biological.  We
use biology (and not well at all), to help support the male dominated
position.

As another matter of fact, we have already tried seperate but equal, and it
doesn't work and is unconstitutional.

I do heartily agreee with your first sentence though.

As for the rest of that stuff, it is not completely biological, but
sociological 'tweaking' of biology, and supported by social mores, laws,
and pre-defined accepted behavior for each sex.

This world need an enema...

"I am suprised at how little change there has been in human evolution.  Oh,
there have been technological advances, but how little man himself has
changed."
(Khan in Space Seed (TOS)).

And oh how right that fictional character from the 60's was.

Peace,
John

Yes, right on, thanks!  The sociological stuff doesn't affect me any more,
because I've spent years deprogramming and reprogramming myself to be more
of the kind of human being (as opposed to "man") that I want to be.  It's
not easy to remember that my thoughts and feelings about people are
probably not the majority opinion (too bad!).
I was raised in a family that tried to promote PLUR, but still had our
problems and maybe hypocritical attitudes.  The striving to achieve family
harmony was worth the effort, because after the family unit(y) had
disintegrated, each of us found the special one-to-one relationship that we
wished we'd had all along.  As kids, our parents always impressed on us the
importance of treating each other fairly and equally as fellow kids, not as
boy vs. girl, etc.  I think I took it to heart and used it as part of my
foundation much more than my sisters did.  My older sister is very
closed-minded and unaccepting of people who are different from her.  My
younger sister despises nearly all human beings (with very, very few
exceptions - that's a self-preservation mechanism/reaction for her...),
often overgeneralizing during conversations when she summarizes by saying
"People suck."  She and I love each other deeply, though, so I feel
fortunate, and hope that some of me has rubbed off on her as far as
reserving a portion of one's heart for those exceptional people one
encounters.
Someone mentioned "genderless spirits" and I agree with this.  That's what
my faith teaches: that the spiritual community transcends sexes.
I better close for now before going off on a tangent.

Peace to my sisters and brothers!

Khan Noonian Singh, from the Star Trek original series episode "Space Seed"
and from my favorite Star Trek movie "Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan", was
a product of the 21st century.  He said in the series episode "On Earth,
200 years ago, I was a prince..."  The original Star Trek series takes
place in the 23rd century.

At my first rave, Basics, both bathrooms had both sexes in it, but more 
ppl were "hanging out" in the womens' bathroom, probably because it was 
cleaner.  I have ceased to see this again at any rave I have attend since 
in the past year or so, which is such a shame.  Personally, I think 
different sex bathrooms is gender segregation and continues to lend to 
misconceptions about both sexes.  I spent most of college 
in co-ops with co-ed bathrooms.  No one particularly cared about nudity, 
bathroom functions, etc.  With mature ppl who realize a body is nothing 
more than a body, regardless of gender, and doesn't always have to be 
sexualized, shared bathrooms are no big deal.  No one worried about it.  
It's very humbling to share bathrooms with members of both sexes, and 
quite a learning experience in acceptance of people in a non-sexual 
manner.  Hey, I would love to see the bathrooms of raves completely 
gender-free.  It was actually a factor that lead to a wonderful 
first-rave experience for me.  I loved the openness and trust.

Unfortunately, not everyone would be safe in a unisex restroom.  Sooner or
later some creep will try to take advantage of the situation and ruin it,
and ruin someone.  Personally, I think I'd be too embarrassed to share a
restroom, even though in most other areas I'm a very sharing person.  Maybe
it's baggage from my upbringing, or an attitude that was forced upon me by
"society," and I don't like the idea that I have these flaws, but hey, it's
an opportunity for growth, isn't it?

Fair enough. I received an email from a person (male) regarding this very
same matter. And again, you have to look at the overall intention behind
the act itself. This particular female playing this particular game at this
particular time, while her actions could most certainly be taken as an
intrusion, this was by no means her intent. She was trying to get the rest
of us to laugh. And by that, she succeeded. All of the men, while a bit
shocked, showed no signs of intrustion... Her intent was fun and humor. In
fact, all three of the men wanted her phone number.

Take this person (male) who previously emailed me.... He explained to me
that he was blatantly 'felt up' by a passing female. In this case, I would
most definitely say that he had every right to feel intruded... and he
did.... and he most certainly did express his reservations about it (to me
at least). It was obvious that her intent was to 'objectify' her victim,
and thus provoked the 'appropriate' response.

I never said that women weren't excited by visual stimulus. I said that
"women don't 'get off' on seeing male flesh the way that men are turned on
when they see female flesh." Please not the words 'in the same way' and
'flesh'. Studies have also shown that women are able to emotionally detach
themselves from the actual 'picture' stimulus of a sexual partner.
Regarding visual stimulus, men's primary focus is the 'picture'. Women
focus more on the meaning behind what they see. They watch body language,
and body motion. So if you doubt this, then ask yourself which you would
rather watch... a still photograph of a gorgeous male model, or a 'motion'
segement of an average looking guy displaying intensely confident, sensual
body movements. One perfect example is the success of male exotic strip
clubs... it's not the flesh... it's the movement of the flesh.

When trekking through a locker room of the opposite sex (now it would be
'rude' to just stare) I imagined that these people would take occasinal
glances, you know, to not be obvious that they're staring. Visual
'pictures' could be taken in very quickly and easily for the men, arousal
would come easy (no pun intended). However, for women, they would not have
so much time in which to guage the body movements of the men that they were
peeping in at. I never said that it wouldn't happen.... it's just much less
likely with given the scenario.

You're probably right that social conditioning has something to do with it.
However, according to neurological science, the right and left side of the
brain of the male become more specialized (separated) than that of the
female. (IN GENERAL). This makes for a visual/spatial side and a
logical/verbal side. These separations have been shown to be the 'culprit'
of mens' tendency to be sexually stimulated by what they see. Studies have
also shown (and I'm sure you've seen this one) that males think of sex 3 to
4 times more than that of a female. Some sex therapists suggest that this
is because men, who are visually/sexually  stimulated, are constantly
'bombarded' with stimulus througout a single day. Of course, as you said,
much of this can be socially conditioned as well.

Thank you for your insights. I've learned something from you.

I think this sounds like Behind the Post Office on Haight, they have

Yeah, basically phono level is much weaker than line level, so the phono inputs have a preamp which boosts the level to match line level.  That's why if you plug a line level input into the phono input you may hear distortion in the signal.

Phono lines are at a different line level (and may be calibrated with a 
different 'zero' level) And have an eq filter to adjust for eqing done 
(when the lp is cut) on lps so that phat bass lines or cymbal crashes do 
not cause the needle to go into orbit. The inverse of this eqing is 
applied with the phono input in order to restore the 'orignal' sound.
Not a good idea to put CD line in phono and vica versa.

I was quite correct in pointing out the gfictional character Khan was 
from the 60's.  I was, of course referring the to series, not the 
fictional events.  I am also aware that Khan was a product of genetic 
engineering.  Created by scientists during the eugenics wars.

Space Seed aired in the mid 60's.  That was the day of his birth, 
television wise.

I am of course, correct.  But this trivia has made me fatgiued again, 
with your permission people, I will retire to my quarters.

Peace, Trek, & Fun,
John

I've felt like one at times! :) Some of you have been nearly overwhelmed 
at my intoductions to our fellow sfravers. It's so much fun, though 
seeing everyone hit it off ("Oh, so *YOU'RE* so & so!  I love your 
posts!" etc.)    

briefly out of a weird lurking mode...

love,
Amy

Hello friends,

Midwest dude, clinton, here again,

well, my countdown to San Francisco continues. I will be there in 
one week!  Thank you all who replied to my first msg. From just
watching the list, i knew you were wonderful ppl but the personal
responses were even friendlier.

i still don't have a set schedule for my trip march 16-23 except
for a Free Radio Berkeley show on early Friday morning march 22nd,
which i hope i'm still invited to!  but i will be bringing my 
hardcore records down so if anyone is having a party they would
like the midwest hardcore sound at, let me know!

i'm also a devoted runner so if anybody wants to get together
for a workout during the week, that'd be super cool!

soon as i get a schedule somewhat made up, i'll post a physical
description.....i really want to meet some of you.


thanks again,
clinton mead

I probably should have posted this earlier, but the whole cindYtalk fiasco
for the West Coast got resolved, and they're playing tonight:

there will be a show in SF this friday, March 8th.
it will be hosted by the "A Winter Gone By" folks at the Maritime Hall
in SF (450 Harrison Street near 1st). Last weekend the evening was called
"Labyrinth." It should be 18 and up.

Hi everyone,

I have a question.  Recently I was reading the spirit of raving archives and
I've noticed a lot of old archives talking about how much the scene has
changed since 91/92.  Has anyone out there been in the scene that long and can
you tell me what you think the differences are.  Since I'm very new to the
scene I have nothing to compare it to except the Dead scene which is something
altogether different.  Is the energy that much more negative now?  Has time
corrupted it?  I'd love to hear what your perspective is.

Actually, something similar to this was tried at the E-Ticket last year.  I
made necklaces with cardboard Sesame Street dominos on them.  The idea was you
walk around to who ever is wearing one and you see which two characters they
have on thier domino and if the characters on theirs match the characters on
your domino necklace.  Anyway, they worked as conversation pieces, rather than
name tags but I met quite a few new people that night.  It was fun.  On the
back of each domino there is a star and I wrote, "If you breathe and persist,
anything is possible. Love the Vibe Tribe"

Have a wonderful weekend everyone.  Think good thoughts!

warmly,

Sean,

First, I=92m sorry that I sent you two of these things, I=92m just getting =

the hang of posting a reply.

Secondly, you are absolutely correct when you stated that there is a =

definite difference in brain development between man and women.  And =

there are _many_ other genuine differences indeed.  We need to ask for =

ourselves what these biological differences mean in the manifestation of =

mental and physical ability for man and for women.  In the few parenting =

magazines I read, there is a very vocal backlash happening from men who =

are the primary caregivers for their children.  They are completely =

questioning the old tenet that women are "born nurturers, and men have =

to learn nurturing skills."  I think we will soon see new research =

questioning the old schools of thought.

I=92m not sorry to say that you are so very wrong about women not being =

quickly aroused by male flesh.  Sean, it doesn=92t need to move or shake. =

 And I have never witnessed a guy coming spontaneously when presented =

with arousing visual stimulus.  We=92re all human and we all have to pass =

through the same stages of sexual arousal before orgasm.  The length of =

time for both men and women in those stages is generally the same., =

Johnson & Johnson, (not Masters & Johnson,) were the research team that =

came up with the study results that erroneously concluded that _it takes =

men two minutes to come and women 14 minutes to come in similar research =

situations_.   We need to look and the year this study was done, (the =

1970=92s,) and the current social mores of the study participants at that =

time, as variables affecting this study.   Johnson & Johnson did a great =

job of broadening our then current views on sexuality, but so much work =

has been done since then.  =


It is impossible to tell what women or men feel about visual stimulus =

and their emotional detachment/ engagement at the time.  Yes, our =

biology=92s are different, but those differences do not translate enough =

for your broad generalizations.  The only way to know for sure is to =

query the person specifically.  We are all individuals, with our own =

unique pasts, and our perspectives of our environment.  This brings me =

to my final point.  (Amen.)  Women and men are all human, which means =

there is no certain way to predict their behavior along gender lines.  =

All men and women should be treated on an individual basis.

Do yourself a favor and quit trying to figure women out.  It takes all =

of the fun out of interactions with people if you can always predict =

what they are going to do or say next.  I myself run through the full =

spectrum of personality types.  Sometimes I=92m aggressive and sometimes I =

love being coy, it depends on my mood, my company, my frame of =

reference, the amount of E flowing through my body, and many other =

variables, too numerous to list here.  I hope I never become =

Sean, I=92ve had a good time with this series of letters. And, I do not =

expect you to change your viewpoints just because of my responses, or =

the responses of others.  You had your eyes opened to my perspective.  I =

have faith that a little of what I=92ve said may influence your =

experiences with women and men in the future.  I think you are a great =

each other at a rave some day.   I would like that.  But I might not hug =

you depending on my mood...

PLU & Respect

In those years everything was new, Jeno had long hair :) And George Bush
was still president, in society at large, there was an overwhelming 
athmosphere to conform to "family values" which seemed to exclude anyone 
who was trasgendered or anyone who took drugs or dared to be open about 
their sexuality.  The parties at that time were mostly underground and outlawed.
People didn't push by you when you were tr/dancing.  They consisted of
young, old, gay straight, black, white, yellow, people in ties, people in
Dr. Suess outfits.  Some of the venues that people found to hold parties
were simply marvelous, like the Scandia way up on Hwy 101 and the after
party along the russian river, (I had my first trance experience at this
party dancing my ass off in a Scandia batting pratice pit, with Earnie
Munson opening my brain like
a can opener :) It was a distinct challenge to the zeitgeist to dance with
abandon under a renegade moon.  Many bonds were formed then, many a life
saved and love lost.  It seemed like there was a never ending supply of good
E and 
good people to share it with. We called it "The Family" instead of "The
Scene".  

It was small, wonderous and beautiful.

It sounds to me like this is what we're all trying to
re-create/promote/carry on, even those like me who are relative newcomers.
With the possible exception of E, because of lack of quality control, never
knowing what it's cut with, etc.
OK, so that's how it may have been back in the dayz.  What about now?  What
are people's perceptions of the current situation by comparison?  How 'bout
we don't compare it to anything, and just love it for what we make it?

Deeply thoughtful,

Dear Ann,

My computer tells me that on Tue, 5 Mar 1996, you shared (in part):

	DJs Susan and Charlotte from Your Sister's House come to mind.  I 
haven't talked to Susan in a while, but I know Charlotte's around, 
because I just discovered a couple weeks ago that she works where I do!  
	She wouldn't be working there if she didn't need money, so if 
anyone would like to have her at a party, email me back and I'll connect 
you. I'm not a music expert, but I would say Charlotte's style is 
techno-trance.  But take this with a large grain of salt.

Much love,

	Even though I understand it, it often frustrates me how much need 
people seem to feel to relate to the accomplishments of others they 
perceive as being like themselves, whether it be others of the same race, 
or gender, or sexual preference, or what have you.
	Diversity is a wonderful thing and should be encouraged, but in 
the end it does not really matter so much who does a good thing, as that 
the thing gets done.  Hopefully in our desire to see more female DJs, we 
will not lose sight of this and let it divide our unity.

PLURally yours,

Dear Friends & Family,

	April 22nd is Earth Day, there will probably be lots of events 
happening the previous weekend, but if we plan it this far off, ours 
could probably go off then as well, and I can't think of a more 
appropriate time of year to hold an outdoor daytime party.
	If we're considering a weekday, I'll vote for April 23rd since 
it's my birthday!  8)

	Probably not even one, is my guess -- considering how many BBS's 
and lists are out there, many much more centered around talk of illegal 
actions than ours.  Reading a book like Bruce Sterling's "The Hacker 
Crackdown" reveals how thin electronic law enforcement's resources are spread.  
Fortunately, I might add. 
	The sad truth is that our own paranoia in this regard probably 
does much more to further the aims of Big Brother (by causing us to 
exercise self-censorship) than any number of actual monitors of this list 
would.

This message is being posted to a couple of the larger mailing lists on 
hyperreal to which I am subscribed - if you are a list admin and want to 
post it to your list, then feel free, but there's no need to start a 
whole lot of discussion about it in public - please send any comments to me.

Many of you have probably noted problems on hyperreal recently - the 
memory upgrade helped address some of the serious server performance 
problems, but in particular did not help bandwidth at all, and also did 
not help a problem with majordomo and mailing list delivery, with blank 
messages, multiple messages, missing messages, etc.  To compound 
problems, I was out of town for most of this week, and did not get to see 
most of the problems while they were happening.  So, here is a synopsis 
of the current state of things, and how they are being addressed.

Bandwidth

Right now as most of you know, Hyperreal shares two T1s to Sprintlink 
with: Organic, HotWired, Wired, Suck, BiancaTroll, bigbook.com, apache.org, 
and a bunch of other sites.  Up until this last week the bandwidth 
picture wasn't pretty, but it was "alright" - at peaks during the day the 
link to sprintlink would be 75% loaded, and many times Sprintlink 
themselves would be flaky if not hosed.  But it was manageable.  Within 
the last week, though, two things have happened: www.levi.com, run by 
Organic, made it to Netscape's "what's cool!" page, and with its massive 
server-pushes, screamed to the tune of gigabytes per day over the 
connection.  Secondly, bigbook.com, an Organic-related company, launched 
with a lot of press a yellow-pages service which has also been drawing a 
large number of hits.  So, the T1's to the building are now maxed - for a 
while earlier today each T1 was delivering 1.49 mbits/sec, with the 
theoretical max of a T1 at 1.54 megabits/sec.  Ugly!  

The solution: Organic is getting its two T1's in about two weeks.  This 
has been in the planning stages for several months, which is the average 
time frame for getting new bandwidth.  We are also getting two more T1's 
later to a different provider, allowing us some redundancy.  This will 
happen soon, but not immediately.  In the short term, the impact from 
Levi's is being turned down, but there will still be some significant lag 
to the system, so I recommend that people avoid even trying to read mail 
or do any other type of interactive communication with hyperreal.  
Cruising the web site is alright, but trying to write an email in pine is 
just impossible.  I know, I was trying to do that from the IETF meeting.  :)
If the situation remains in the critical section, I may take action such 
as turning off the mail daemon on hyperreal in the middle of the day, or 
turning off immediate delivery for mailing lists, and then turning it on 
at night for later delivery.  These are drastic, but temporary measures.
Hell, I'm pushing for a T3.  :)


Mailing list problems

Most of hyperreal's work load is based around the number of mail
deliveries it does on a given day.  On a slow day hyperreal delivers 20K
messages.  On a busy day it delivers well over 100K.  This punishes the
operating system at a pretty deep level - and the problem I've seen is
that sendmail can't pass the message off to the program to do what it
needs to do, generating an error message of "Cannot fork()".  It has been
difficult to track down the exact reason why it can't fork, and while I
think I have finally nailed it down today (CHILD_MAX in the BSDI kernel
config, I think the "daemon" user is exceeding it, for the techies out
there) I'm still not sure.  I will be upgrading to 2.1 this weekend, and
finding more swap space, but this is an ongoing battle I thought I had
solved when I bought more memory two weeks ago. 

Anyways, if you sent mail to hyperreal more than 12 hours ago and it has 
not shown up on the list yet (and mail usually gets delivered pretty 
quickly for you) then consider submitting it again, it may be lost.  
Hopefully this kernel config has fixed it, but we'll find out next week, 
since we usually don't hit this problem during the weekend.


That's it.

	Brian

I don't think the scene has changed in a negative way at all, despite what
a lot of people say.  It has evolved, I have to say that. Many people come,
many people go, and sometimes it happens so fast that it's hard to figure
out what's going on sometimes.  But the vibe's still there, I havent seen
it dissapear at all.  I went to my first party (Mr. Floppies) back in '90,
and since then, yes, things have changed, but for the better.  I think this
is the only scene where the music changes and evolves so fast that our
minds are always getting something new. Over the last 5 years, I met so
many people, and changed my own life so much, so much more than I would
have if I never went to these parties and met these people.
 Sometimes you can get lost in it all, and get confused because everything
is going so fast, and some people drop out.  Others come into the scene
because they are lost, and the scene helps them find their way, and they
move on.  Others get so liberated by the scene that they become a vital
part of it (Like the DJ's, the musicians, promoters, etc).  I cant get
enough of it, so I started cutting records of my own (New Central Fire
records coming soon!!!).
  As far as comparing, I dont think you can compare this scene to anything.
There is way too much to compare.

peace-  Courtney

That hits it right on man. Sometimes when I hear people talk about how
"good things were then and how things now suck" I just gotta laugh. I mean,
are those people still paying attention??? The music (what really keeps me
going) has just got more and more amazing. The VIBE can still manifest
itself in all it's glory when things click (and they do click: last
ComeUnity anyone?) Things are definitely evolving which also means
changing.
It seems to me that the people who end up "burning out" on the parties are
into it for reasons other than the music. The music will never let you
down.

Feel it.

I got into the scene on January 1, 1993, so I just missed rave's infancy. 
I gotta say, I'm not exactly a newcomer, but I have been around long 
enough to notice some change, although not as much as those who have been 
involved in the scene a longer time. My general attitude about 
comparisons with then and now is summed up in Eric's last sentance 
above.  I don't compare it to anything and just love it for what I make 
of it.  With that attitude, raves stay fresh, alive, new and continuously 
BEAUTIFUL. 

love,
Amy

On this lovely topic....

I have no problems sharing bathrooms with men, but here's the catch ---- MEN PEE
ON THE SEAT!!  Why is this?  If guys (and some women, I must say) could pay a
little more attention to hitting the mark, this would surely work -- I mean, at
lots of parties, there are only single restrooms, and we all use 'em -

And the modesty issue should be minimal really, there's not much to see when
guys are using a urinal -- 

I used to go to lots of gay clubs, and there ALL the bathrooms are men's rooms,
no matter what's on the door - but no one ever minded a woman waiting in line
with them....

once I was at a party at the Mission Rock, which was totally unprepared for the
crowd and the women's room bathrooms backed up - I said I was going to use the
men's room and the other woman in line said wistfully "I wish I could do that,
but my boyfriend would kill me!"  -- which I thought rather odd, since frankly a
dirty men's room is pretty much the last place one would go to cruise, don't you
think?  It was, as it turns out, even funkier than the women's room and the
gangster boys were rather taken aback at my presence, but hey, when you gotta
go, you gotta go!

Anyway ...  we surely are straying into interesting territory here, aren't we?

The Food not Bombs Rave will be happening tonight in east bay.  There are
only 200 tickets and I believe the New Moon Voicemail has the info.  It
should be a amazing night.  There will also be a Free Outdoor Party by
Afterglow in the Berkeley Marina as an after party to the Benefit.  It will
start at 10:00am.
I don't know the New Moon # but I'm sure someone on this list has it
around.  Have a great weekend.

Probably because women have the nasty habit of leaving the seat down. ;-)

I'd say go to a party by yourself or with some friends who are open-minded.
That way y'all can look out for each other (as most of the rest of us
will, anyway).  Go in with NO expectations, but with high hopes of making
new friends, hearing some dynamite dance music, and having FUN!!!  Stay as
long as you like (I like to stay till the end, then go outside and greet
the day as the sun kisses us good-morning and we say "see ya next time").

Dear SteveO,

	Ugh, is this ickiness catching?  8)  It can't be widespread, 
since I can't remember seeing anyone at a rave who I would describe as 
icky (let alone yucky), at least at the beginning of a party.
	By the end of the night however, particularly when spaces are hot 
and crowded and the beat is good ((On the first night, the DJ made the 
beat, and heard that it was good)) ravers often become icky.
	As far as yucky, that can be blamed on the thoughtless souls who 
throw their chewing gum on the floor to be picked up by other less 
fortunate soles.

Dear Diana (& Friends & Family),

My computer tells me that on Fri, 8 Mar 1996, you shared (in part):

I am tempted to turn this sentence around so that it reads:

=09"Women are socially conditioned to view this as invasive, while=20
=09 most men these days are aware that it is a compliment."

=09Just because it isn't affectionate in an emotional sense doesn't=20
mean a lusty grope isn't a compliment.  I don't think many people are=20
going to feel up someone they don't find attractive.
=09Now before the flames start, let me say clearly that I'm not suggesting=
=20
anyone should cop random feels.  Since some people don't like it, it's best=
=20
to refrain unless you have good reason to believe it would be welcome.
=09What I do wish to communicate is that those of us who enjoy being felt=
=20
up from time to time do not have a less valid point of view than those who=
=20
do not, whether we be female or male.

=09In my case it's not a facade -- I generally *do* enjoy it, as=20
long as it's done in a friendly manner.  I'm also bisexual, and not=20
terribly concerned about being perceived as "unmanly."  If that were a=20
concern, I definitely wouldn't wear some of the stuff I wear to raves.  8)

This observation seems more even-handed and matches my own perceptions.

Well said Diana!  I hope you and others don't find my perspective *too*=20
"fresh".  8)

Depends on where you have it, in the case of

        The People of the United States of America
                        vs.
                Geoffrey A. White


I was charged with Operating a P.A. system on National Park property
without a permit.

                                and
Operating a gas powered generator on National Park property with out a
permit.  

Both citations were $50. We did a small renagade at North Beach
Point Reyes. It wasn't very big but Ethan, Unknown and John Lee played.
We started at about 3 a.m. and had about 20 people, by 7 we had had enough fun
watching a beautiful sunrise and decided to pack it in.  While we were
carrying the equipment off of the beach, a ranger shows up. He's pissed that
he missed the party :) and started giving us a lot of shit.  But since we
were done and told him that, we figured there wasn't much he could do, well, he
threatened to call his "boss" who would most likely want to impound the 
equipment, (I doubted that this would actually happen but since it wasn't my
equipment at risk, (but it was my party) I deemed it best to take the rap
so he wrote the tickets to me,  I told him I would see him in court.

So the court date comes and it is right before "Burning Man" and I was suppose
to leave on that day, but I deamed that it was important to push back just a
little.  So I went to court to plead my case.  I told the magistrate (she
decides whether a full court hearing is necessary) that we had set up the
equipment in the early morning, that we had come out there to be able to
play music and not disturb anybody.  When daylight came we cleaned up. and
by 8 am any joggers or surfers or old folks strolling would never have know
that we were there.  The ranger had taken photos of the generator and
large PA system (both packed in the truck) as evidence of our wrongdoing.
He did admit that we were co-operative, the beach was clean and there was no
sign of alcohol or drug use [:)-ed]
I told her that we had deployed the system but, technicaly, the ranger
did not observe a crime taking place and did not know, until we told
him that we had been there all night.
I told here that we didn't think we needed permits to do such a thing but that
if it is a simple problem of filling out the paperwork that we would be glad to
do so in the future as we wanted to comply with the law on this matter but
felt it our right to peaceably assemble on public lands for purposes of
celebration of spirit.  She looked at the Ranger, he frowned and said that
our stereo was way to large and that people strolling or fishing didn't
want to be bothered by this noise and that if I applied for permits, he would
refuse them, I said "then I will apply to your supervisor", "He will refuse
them as well", I said "On what grounds"  He said that he didn't need any
grounds. I said "With all due respect officer, I think it's your job to
enforce the law, not your own social engineering agenda" at this point he
became noticeably pissed off (red in the face:).  The Magistrate steps in and
makes a "compromise", she drops the PA charge and lowers the fine for the
generator to $25, which I agreed to, (I suppose I could have refused and 
asked for a trial but I felt that at least the Magistrate saw a bit of the
Light, I knew it, I could see it in her eyes during my interaction with the
Ranger), I know in her position, this being the Police State that it is, the
courts won't go against a cop unless you have a really good lawyer and/or a
really bad cop. O.J. prooved this. 
My public defender, who saw me briefly before the
"trial" said to me afterwards, "Not bad for an amature, I didn't expect you
to get that far :)". So that's the story I have to tell about National
Seashores and the Law, but please bear in mind that people have had parties
on that beach on south beach and other beaches north of, south of, and in, San
Francisco.  That's what makes these parties special, you never know what might
happen, but then, people have been know to go to extremes just to hear some
House Music :)

Origin report
-------------

Well,  I just got back from Origin,  and because it was the only thing
in town,  decided to check it out....   Sure wish I had a phone number
to just ONE SFRaver,  because I would have called and said "Don't
bother,  stay home this weekend".

Anyways,  to keep it simple,   the greedy venue nazis had stasi police
in the restrooms,  not allowing anyone to fill up their water bottles,
and at one point,  they closed down the stairway between the main
room and the upstairs restrooms,  making it literally impossible to
get upstairs to use the "Loo".    For a while,  they opened up the door
to the outside and brought the temperature down to a reasonable level,
and they even let some people go outside to cool off,  but later on,  they
had the place buttoned down tighter than Ft Knox.    Yukk!!!   Temperatures
must have been 120 degrees and 100% humidity...

At about 5 am,   the music started to really slow down into some
funkey hip hop toons,  but at this point,  dancing was almost
impossible,  the heat was stifling,  and I proposed to my friend that
we leave early.    Everyone agreed...  By that time,  many other people
were getting the idea and left as well....

Freq-8 where were you...  we could have used an outdoor party....

Anyway,  I hope that other may have enjoyed Origin better than I
did,  and I should have tried to contact some other SFRavers to warn
them not to bother to show up.

I really can't blame the promoters for this one,  I'm sure they didn't
know about the water situation,  but later on,  things got so crowded
that the goons finally gave up and let us fill our water bottles,   but
by that time,  just getting to the loo to fill our bottles resulted in
a hot steambath,  and 45 minutes at least to get up there.

Kudos to one of the gals who promoted the gig,  that helped me out
and bought me some water....  It saved my life,  literally.

Anyway,  the $20 price for such a small crowded venue is really too
much.   Of course,  they probably knew it was the only thing going on
in town.

Anyway,  we should set up a "Bad rave Alert system" where we all
should know the phone number to at least ONE SFRaver so we can
call in and report "Don't bother to come",  and have that person
post it so others don't get sucked into going.

I have talked about this problem so much that it has become an excersize in
tedium for me.  In short this scene is male dominated.  Females are
relegated, often enough, as accesories to a party, or participating as
paying patrons.  There is very real, and active discrimination of females
here in SF (I cannot account for any other scene/locale).

Ask any female DJ's/Promoters (os/ns) if they have felt the pinch so to speak.

I would also like to point out that the need you cite is also very real.
But since, I assume, you are not part of any underrepresneted group, you
would have a very difficult time understanding this view.  I would suggest
some serious time, in a country, where you are outnumbered 10, 20, 1000:1!
(Africa for instance).  I am sure that after some time, it will be very
pleasing to see someone who looks like you and shares a common culture.

I have been to plenty, and I do mean plenty of parties.  It always suprises
me to see Af. Am's go out of our way to introduce ourselves to each other.
Kind of a relief to know that someone, just like you, likes the stuff you
enjoy.  Someone, who in all likelihood had the same experience growing up,
is there with you in the same spirit in the same space.  I can say it
feels, more restful, and you can finally relax and get down, once you see
the brown.

It is difficult to describe, you just gotta walk a few miles in my shoes I
guess (I know gay/lesbian brothers and sisters must feel the same when they
go to a primarily het event, or female DJ's must feel the same when they
see one of their own at the dex).

As for it really doesn't matter...I dunno, I guess there are plenty of
female DJ's and females in general who would disagree (one of the reasons
YSH got started was due to lack of recognition, opps for females in the
scene).

The last part of your statement is quite Machiavellian, and I quote
"Diversity is a wonderful thing and should be encouraged, but in the end it
does not really matter so much who does a good thing, as that the thing
gets done."  I of course do not agree.  The ends do not justify the means,
message, or messenger.  Respect of others is a necessity, and regard for
others feelings is , IMO the only way we as a society can become more
human.

I now step down from the soapbox.  We Pisceans have a certain need to
pontificate at times.  And I *DO* love to pontificate...in fact let me
share some of my other views with you and others so that you too can get
hip to the game...(sarcasm off!).

Peace,
John

contrary to popular disinformation services, i am alive and well
and spinning still . . .

what i'm spinning is an increasingly eccentric amalgamation of all types 
of music into one gooey mess . . .

i'm also trying to spin a web of cooperation into a series of outdoor
events that would be self-supporting and occur every other Friday evening
through the summer season

i've spent the winter months scouting out new locations and truly believe
that we could have an incredible outdoor season 

most of you are probably somewhat aware that i am no longer associated 
with the Frequency 8 party

what i would like to be part of creating is a cooperative effort to create
very low cost events that would showcase NEW djs mixed in with old reliables

my thought is that parties would go from 11 to 7 and that a lot of people
would be involved in organizing, schlepping, maintaining a vibe and cleaning
up afterwards

ultimately this consortium of like minded hipsters would make the sacred
pilgrimage to Burning Man and set up our very own mega camp

if you are interested in this venture (no previous experience necessary)
please e-mail me privately (surfpunk@well.com)

interested djs should send demo tapes to P.O. Box 313, Stinson Beach, Ca. 
94970

I hope we can have an initial planning meeting on the 17th or 18th of this
month with an initial OUTING to be held on the vernal equinox!

Thanx for your attention and looking forward to the unfolding season in 
the sun (or light of the moon and stars)

Jim Cyr

Starchild,

If you still feel that it is such a compliment to be groped and that 
others should possibly feel that way, perhaps there should be a posting 
outside the door of the next rave proclaiming:

 "You will be groped by people you don't know inside, be cool, and 
accept it as a compliment, PLUR!"

I think it would be more honest to just have a private groping party.  
Anyone?

D.

Yeah, I agree here.  It seems to me that one of the biggest messages inherent
to the Burning Man festival was that, even though many saw it as an escape 
from society, it still *was* a society.  And that meant that you had to 
learn the meaning of community pretty quickly if you were going to make it:
the golden rule becomes more pertinent when you're out in the broiling 
desert, as opposed to being surrounded by mechanized comfort, which I 
think might kind of buffer the community message.

     I would love to hear, on this list, people's personal stories of their
rave experiences.  The mental and physical journey, personal and collective
transcendence, the realizations and joy...  What is for you the highest
moment, the meaning?

      Harmony was, for me, such an ecstatic experience, that I'd like to
share it with all of you (it still influences me despite being three weeks
gone).   I don't make it to parties every week-end (it is too time-, money-
and energy-consuming!), so when I go it's a special occasion.  This year
I've been at Begin Again (pure happiness!), All in the Family (busted at
4:20am ;> !), and Harmony.

        I went to Harmony with a new friend, someone who I had just met and
only spoken with a few times, but who definitely exudes great vibe!  He was
an enthusiastic raver back in the day, but had not been to a party in a
year...  Originally, a group of us were going, but everyone flaked, which
left just me and my new,  not-well-known friend.  As the rave experience is
an intense one, I was apprehensive to share it with someone I hadn't hung
out with before.

        We left the East Bay late, and wouldn't be getting to the mappoint
til at least midnight, for a party that was sure to sell out.  I called F-8
and tickets were almost gone!  I pleaded with them to set tickets aside
(I've been wanting to go to a Harmony *forever*!).  Taking pity on me, they
agreed to despite that it would probably mean their waiting a while for
=only= me, and getting to their own party later.  Symbiotic rave experience
#1 of the night!  Thank you, F-8!

        We arrived at Acme.  Despite the great controversy surrounding that
particular location, every party I have ever been to there has been
AMAZING!  Acme reserves a special place in my heart, despite my wish for a
bigger, better-ventilated, safer locale.

        We went straight to the top floor.  Hard trance, yes!  With my
favorite d.j. Ethan spinning, and many familiar faces smiling, and hands
clapping, and congos drumming, and vibe building, my friend and I whirled
and stamped around for a timeless while...  We then went in search of our
mutual friend, let's call her "E", and retired to the chill room, to
discover each other.  We found many things in common - our upbringings,
beliefs, values, humor - and started a friendship that remains strong now,
in sobriety.

        I have found that deep connections I make on ecstasy remain true
once we return to "reality."  Sharing the ecstasy experience with someone,
hours and hours of sharing, talking, and dancing, is a bonding experience
that allows for an instant friendship, cutting through the slow process of
conventional acquaintance.   Ecstasy is often accused of producing a
mindless, unauthentic closeness.  I have found, though,  that my
E-established friendships are not indiscriminate.  People I meet and hug
[:)] with pure love, without having to know them first, do not become my
new best friends.  But those with whom I embark on a night-long adventure,
in which we truly learn about each other, have become *real friends*
through a shared intense experience.  Maybe it's a chemical that lowers the
inhibitions that keep us from other people.  Maybe it's a chemical that
simply causes "unnatural" happiness, making us blissfully smile at
strangers.  If so, so what?  The experience is real, regardless of the
source.  The realizations that come may not be possible in our daily
mindset, our closed frames of reference.  Application of the realizations
to our "real" lives is the bridge from the illusionary nature of a drug
trip to the material reality of our lives.

        My friend and I parted to do some solitary explorations.  I floated
through the party, buoyed by a strong communal vibe, like threads
connecting us all.  I previously had excused the widespread use of ecstasy
at parties, thinking that each trip was an individual thing, incidental to
the fact of the party, which was more about the music.  I suddenly realized
that the purpose of a party *could* be a huge, collective, E trip!  500
people all in the exact same, loving place - and how powerful that was!
Moving away from remnants of judgemental attitudes, the feeling that
rampant drug use somehow invalidated the "purity" of the party, I came to
see that a large gathering of people to jointly experience transcendent
love is an extremely potent, and valid, thing!  In fact, mass ritualized
intake of hallucinagens have been part of spiritual ceremonies for
millenia...  In that, raving is merely this moment's manifestation of
ancient knowledge, sheathed in technology for this 21st century
generation....

        During my journey, I caught sight of a video playing on the main
floor.  Flashing before my eyes were images I had never seen before,
pictures of suffering in the Third World.  The images were so unbelievable
(people living on top of dumps in Africa, scrounging for scraps of food;
starvation; prostitution; ill people ravaged, with absolutely no medical
treatment; and more...) that at first I had trouble comprehending them.  I
had *known*, abstractly, that conditions of life were very harsh in parts
of the world.  But I had never really seen it!  These pictures are not
shown on our televisions.  I had always had the vague sense that countries,
despite their poverty, somehow provided for people, that there was some
sort of safety net.  Here was proof that human beings are existing on this
planet in wretched conditions - living in Third World countries that have
few, if any, resources, and whose lives consist of simply trying to
subsist.  I saw very clearly how *rich* our country and the West is - the
vastness, plenty, the obscenity of our affluence.  Westernization and
industrialization have meant wealth for the few, while consigning countries
that can't compete (harboring 80% of the world's population) to absolute
poverty.  I think these images are purposely kept from us, because it would
cause people to question the economic and hierarchical system that keeps
the West secure, and keeps our standard of living going, to the severe
detriment
of most of the world's people.

        I was in a very open and emotional state, and each image struck me
to my core.  I have many times walked past homeless and begging people,
thinking, "don't bother me!"  Thanks,  I think, to ecstasy, I was able to
*feel* each person's situation, in all of its pain and implications.  I
have always been progressive and concerned with social justice,  but this
video made me aware of just how blind, sheltered, and privileged I am, how
much I really have as a "starving student."  I wanted to thank the people
of Harmony for having the consciousness to show this video.  At first it
greatly distrubed me (and caused me to worry about anyone on acid who might
see those pictures!), but I am now utterly grateful for having been exposed
to this, because I have a new, real awareness of the global situation.  I
am graduating this semester and am now considering doing aidwork in a Third
World country for a while.

        I am a Political Science major and had previously been active for
international women's rights, but had withdrawn out of frustration and
resignation.  This video made me see that what is important is being a
witness, standing up and saying that "I see this and it is wrong!", rather
than expecting an immediate change.  I am now empowered to return to my
concern for global human rights that I had previously thought hopeless -
something I had thought was forever lost to me.

        After spending about an hour alone meditating on all of the above,
I once again ventured into the party.  I met a teen-age boy who confided in
me his fears that he is becoming addicted to speed.  We talked a while
about drug addiction, his hopes for himself, the deadend of drug abuse.   I
told him that the loving and open person he is now would be lost to the
paranoia of speed, and impressed on him how expanding and exciting higher
education is.  He found me at the end of the night and heartfully thanked
me, telling me he has renewed inspiration to fight it.  I also met a girl
who had dropped out of school, and encouraged her to return.  At 26, I felt
like a rave "big-sister," but these connections were not sermons, but given
and received very positively as loving knowledge.

        Finally I went back in a "trance" upstairs and danced for hours,
ending at 7 with a group of about 50 of us getting into a great circle, all
holding hands and cheering.  On the way out I was allowed to take, as a
souvenir, a fantastic decoration - a lovely violet fur silhouette of a
teddy bear, with adorable cotton ball tail.  I am sewing it onto my
ravepants, so keep an eye out! ;)!  We left the building, blinking in the
newborn sunlight, to be sent on our way by several happy crayons, running
about the parking lot and waving, "bye-bye! bye-bye!"  Although my car had
held only two on the way there, we crossed the Bridge back to Berkeley
packed with six of us - our family had expanded.

        I laid in bed all the next day, recovering.  Still in a beautifully
open state-of-mind, I spent the whole afternoon on the phone,
re-establishing deep contact with two friends who I had thought were going
their own way...

        Thank you very much to the Harmony crew, who had put in so much
time, love and effort.  I have *never* seen Acme look so beautiful, with so
many hand-painted signs and decorations, and so many inspirational
sayings...  This party was, for me, what it's all about.  See you all next
week at Chrysalis!


Love, Nancy

Hey all you womyn out there.  The WIR list is a really cool list, though 
kinda quiet, we could use some more female voices.  If anyone is 
interested mail me for the details, i.e. how to sub and stuff.  

Cheers***

Firstly I would like to say thanks to all the people who responded so 
warmly to my "Old Fart" posting; you made me feel so welcome, I guess 
I was a little overwhelmed.

I would just like to give adequete fair warning to all: I dance like 
a total SPAZ.

You have been warned.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

I have to agree with Crunchy on this.  It was *really* stifling, and the 
venue just wasn't that big.  I spent the first half of the night dancing -- 
the music was really good, visuals were ok, lighting was pretty standard -- 
and the second half sitting.  What saved it for me was the incredibly good 
vibe I got from the other people.  I met so many folks!!!  It was great!  
And I went through a whole roll of film.  I'm going to go and drop off the 
film in a few minutes, and I can hardly wait to see how it all comes out.  I 
also went through quite a bit of lotion 8).  

Still, vibe comes with the people.  The part I was paying for, the venue, 
was really not worth $20.

I left about 6:30, just before the whole thing shut down.  It was light and 
grey out, quiet, misting rain.  Very peaceful.  A nice drive home, say hello 
to the hamstas, who were busy cleaning up after a long and excellent hamsta 
rave, slip between cooooold sheets, Cowboy Junkies on the stereo to sing me 
to sleep...

	If the party was specifically for groping, wouldn't that defeat the
purpose of the grope?

        I hope you got some percocets or something. Oh my those are scary
how chilled you can get with those. I got 5 (yes, five and no, i'm not a
neanderthal...i think) wisdom teeth removed and the percocet along with a
lot of Future Sound of London made it a more pleasurable experience. Watch
out those, there is addiction potential (to percocet, FSOL is ok to be
addicted to :).

        Maybe it should be "All-Grope party...or maybe not" to leave the
element of suprise in there (a key factor!). Or maybe disguise it as a
"tupperware/ambient/grope" party so you get a more mixed crowd. :)

Yeah, I really want to go to this - I'm going through rave withdrawls, 
my last party being Harmony.  Are tickets presale, or do we just have to 
get there early?  Also, a limited # of people like that means a pretty 
small space, which means that 800 folks might PACK the venue, and I am 
sick, sick SICK of hot, humid places.  That is the main reason I have 
been taking a small break from raving lately - I just can't handle the 
overcrowdedness.  So if anybody has any info on Basics, please let me 
know! :)

Amy

Dear Friends & Family,

My computer tells me that on 8 Mar 1996, Michele asked:

> I have a question.  Recently I was reading the spirit of raving archives and

	I'd say the scene has changed somewhat.  My first rave/E 
trip/techno experience was New Years Eve, the end of 1991.  I'd been 
reading/hearing about raves since around the summer of '91, and from what 
I heard I knew immediately that it was something I wanted to be involved 
with.  I didn't have that much idea what it was like though; for me, the 
main attraction was the new technology -- many of the early parties 
featured virtual reality machines, which at that time were very new and 
most people had not seen or tried.  In fact, most people hadn't HEARD of 
VR.  
	When I went to that first New Year's Eve Toon Town, VR was among 
the chief reasons.  Ironically, my friend talked me into taking this new 
"Exstasy" drug, and I had such a blast I forgot all about virtual 
reality.  :)  
	Anyway, this is straying pretty far from Michelle's question.  
What I miss most about that time ('91-'92) is the sense of creating 
something new and untried. 
	The original scene was a fusion of high-tech cyber-nerd types and 
club kids, and I think it has shifted much more in the direction of club 
kids, where the focus is now primarily on music and dance rather than 
creating a weird environment with high-tech novelties.
	Back when I first started going to parties, the experience was 
new for most of us, and thus more exciting.  Sometimes it is difficult to 
sustain the same sense of excitement and wonder proper for a really good 
vibe.  This means that it is essential to the vitality of the scene that 
we continually bring new people into it, people with fresh energy and a 
fresh perspective.    
	I still enjoy going to parties, but I think they have become "formula" 
to some extent.  This doesn't have to be.  Promoters could be more 
experimental -- not just booking different DJs, but changing the whole 
atmosphere of the party/event.
	Parties with foam, underwear parties, the Internet invasion of 
England that Megatripolis put on, CyberForum (panel discussion with 
promoters, DJs, etc.), the party called Mile High a couple years back 
that took place at the top of the St. Francis Hotel, the Basics bus trip 
to Seattle, the boat parties on the bay, the "spiritual mass" at Grace 
Cathedral, the creation of SFRaves and the full moon parties are a few 
examples of some of the creative things that have been done.  All of 
these things happened or began some time ago, you will note, which is an 
indication that the scene right now is not as fresh and vibrant as it 
could be.  Still great fun though, which is what's most important.  I'd 
just like to see it get even better.
	
	Anyway, those are just a few thoughts on "then and now".

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

Read & head, my brother!  PLUR means everything!  First, as I've learned
from those who know:

Peace
Love
Unity
Respect

These are as vital to life as air & water, as strong as earth and as
energetic as fire!  It means living by the Golden Rule, embracing
diversity, dropping knowledge when we feel it will help a brother or a
sister.  It means embracing everyone as a family, and for me fuels my
joy-radiating furnace, which is perpetually set on full blast.

That's some of what PLUR means to me.

Hi!

	I keep seeing a lot of msgs relating to people dropping E, but I haven't
seen anything that seemed to refer to acid. Would I be committing some kind of
bay-area social faux pas by tripping on acid and not E? From everything I
have heard about E it really sounds like a drug I wouldn't be interested in
and for me tripping complements raving nicely...

Amy,

        I don't know why, but people keep asking me about Evolution.  It's
on the sfraves calendar.  Anyway, my friend Kirsten hipped me to it first,
wanting to know about the djs' styles.  I got the 411 and passed it to her.
        Evolution will be this Friday night, 3/15/96, the Ides of March!
DJs will be Jeno, DJ Dan, Mark Farina, Barry Weaver, Rob Vaughan, Karizma,
DLX.  Info lines are:
800.204.3986 415.437.5503 408.345.2399 510.464.4677 916.484.4006
        I stongly urge everyone to attend.  Feedback is that the djs will
be awesome, and it's been two weekends without parties for me, so I'm
sooooo ready!

I've got BIG hugz & smiles reserved for everyone!

Once again...this news group is about RAVING!  It's not a forum for drugs,
drugs discussion, or drug use. Drugs and raving are two seperate thing and
should be treated as such, ESPECIALLY in open forums such as this
newsgroup.  I don't mean to shout Marisa, but please understand that there
are newsgroups and times and places for everything, including frank
discussions about drugs, but this newsgroup wasn't set up for that.

That's my peace...

What we need is someone we can call from the party in question who
can take down the info and post it to SFRaves before other people
trek out there.   I would do it but I don't hve a car,  and always
have to leave several hour earlier.

Marisa, 

I do not think that a Grope Party would defeat the purpose at all.  Just 
because you attend a groping party, it won't gaurantee that others will 
want to grope you.  However, I believe that the number of women at the 
party would twice exceed the number of men at the party.  Boo Hoo  
Perhaps we should have a counter at the door?

Still figuring this out

Diana

Hey, I had five wisdom teeth too! I thought I was the choosen one. I
had the one extra pulled and it obviously has some kind of weird
inscriptions on it. I believe it's my orders from the aliens, but I
already know what they are anyway, so I don't really need to decifer
it. You didn't just toss away your orders, did you??? :)

If you've been to raves in the SF area, then I'm surprised if you haven't seen
acid all over the place. I frequently have people come up to me ask if I have
any, because I have a thick beard so people think I'm a hippy...

I guess that's the round-about way of saying that psychedelic use of all kinds
are relevent and prevalent at raves.

Have fun!

	Except if you read my message you would see I was writing because I
didn't want to do something unacceptable at a rave. Seems pretty much on-topic

 are you the gatekeeper of the forum?  Did you start this forum, do you own it? 
Are those the rules as stated by you? If so, then by all means lay down the 
rules as to what is to not be discussed.  But if not, let people write about 
what ever they feel raving is about.  
Raving *does* have a lot to do with drug use for many people. raving has a lot 
to do with music for many people. raving has a lot to do with lasers and lights 
for many people.  raving has a lot to do with friends and people for many 
people. Raving has a lot to do with spirtuality for many people.  Raving has a 
lot to do with getting fucked-up on mind/body altering illegal/legal substances 
for many people.  Just cause peoples posts about raves isn't what YOU think 
Raving is/should be doesn't mean it isn't.  Personally i want to hear about 
everything including peoples experiences both good/bad or indifferent regarding 
the music/djs/spaces/heat/crowds/drugs/friends/whatever!  The posts are both 
entertaining and educational.  If you dont like a post, i remind you there is 
the "DELETE" key on most keyboards these days.
-enjoy the difference and dont take it so seriously, jc

Once again...this news group is about RAVING!  It's not a forum for drugs, 
drugs discussion, or drug use. Drugs and raving are two seperate thing and 
should be treated as such, ESPECIALLY in open forums such as this 
newsgroup.  I don't mean to shout Marisa, but please understand that there 
are newsgroups and times and places for everything, including frank 
discussions about drugs, but this newsgroup wasn't set up for that.
     
That's my peace...
     
Tony

Word up, Jeffrey!  'Course, he DID say that it was his peace, but maybe he
should have phrased his post to more clearly indicate that.  I
dunno...let's not have a war, let's just share opinions, thereby
understanding each other more.  Please?  Maybe?  Just a thought...

Vath, DJ Pierre and Kieoke!  Its about time we have a good weekly on Fridays.

Sorry I didn't post this sooner but anyway Come-Unity was a great time last
week.  I spent a good amount
of time in the ambient room listening to Jasons magical set.  The energy in
the ambient room was comfortable and cozy.  I really enjoyed trancing out
to the small drumming circle down there.  Upstairs I caught most of Jenos
set.  I hadn't heard him in awhile and I lost  myself in some heavy webby
bass waves.  Astral Matrix twisted my mind for awhile - thank you.  I only
caught the first while of Simon and  enjoyed what I heard of his set but
too many vocal tracks and a lack of energy sent me back downstairs to
chill.  I was delighted to see so many friends and to have an opportunity
to interact with them on a simple level.  Thank you all for a great night.
I hadn't been to Come-unity in awhile because of the rising meatmarket vibe
but with that many great people, everything was enjoyable!  Hope this
review finds and leaves you in good spirits!  Thank You.    -Claire

And my computer tells me that on Sun. Mar 10, you responded; my comments 
are interspersed with your response below:

Underrepresented groups I am a part of (I'm interpreting 
"underrepresented" here as meaning at less than ideal representation):

-libertarians (more of us would mean less repression)
-ravers (no argument here, right?)
-agnostics (I see this as a healthy questioning of authority)
-people who appreciate hugs (naturally we could use more of these folk!)
-users of illicit drugs (everybody should at least try once, IMO)
-roller bladers (better if we did this instead of drove)
-non-macho guys (any representation of macho is too great, IMO)
-vegetarians (less suffering animals)
-people with full use of their limbs (wish everyone had this blessing)
-people who have somewhere to live (tragically underrepresented in S.F.)

Obviously I could go on here ad infinitum.  Equally obviously this is not 
what you meant by "underrepresented" John, but I don't necessarily agree 
with the premise of yours, which is that there is some ideal number of 
women (or any other group) that should be present in the scene.  
	If women who want to be DJs or promoters are unable to do so 
because of anti-female discrimination, this is wrong.  But I think to 
suggest that an equity of numbers means the problem is solved is wrong.  
	Imagine a situation down the road where there are an equal number 
of male and female DJs and promoters.  Problem solved?  Not necessarily.  
The story behind the numbers could be as follows:
	Some male promoters and DJs continue to discriminate against 
women.  Knowing this, a greater number of other promoters and DJs begin 
to discriminate in favor of women, against men, resulting in an 
equalizing of the numbers.  Discrimination is rampant; the men and women 
who were discriminated against because they (not knowing better) went to 
the wrong people, get discouraged and give up on the scene.  Women DJs 
and promoters who were booked or helped by men in the scene have the 
lingering doubt as to whether it was because of what they had to offer, 
or because they were female.  Result:  Virtually no one is happy, yet by 
the numbers, everything looks fine.

> I would suggest
> some serious time, in a country, where you are outnumbered 10, 20, 1000:1!

In many of the views that I hold, which I consider to be more important and 
more personal to me than my skin color, I would guess that I *am* 
outnumbered on the order of 1000 to 1, without ever leaving the country.

John, I don't agree that culture is based on skin tone.  I feel that I 
share more of a common culture with local ravers of all colors than with 
a group of Kansas farmers who might share my ethnicity.  As far as 
looking "like me," skin color isn't everything.  Ask Diana Greer.  ;)

For the record, I loved Your Sister's House parties, and went on a

Machiavellian?  I really don't see how that label applies to what I said.
I don't feel the ends justify the means either.  The means I'm talking 
about are not anything that requires justification.  We're talking good 
deeds, whether it be creating enjoyable music or pulling someone from in 
front of a bus.  If I see a man pulling a woman from in front of a bus, 
I'm not going to say to him, "Excuse me, could you step aside and let a 
woman do that?  Not enough women are getting the chance to rescue people 
from accidents involving buses."  Again, the important thing is that the 
good gets done, not who does it, IMHO.
	As always, I enjoy conversing with you John.  You force me to 
examine my ideas and present them articulately, and you are a strong 
advocate for you point of view.

Much love,

Subject: Clarification about drug talk.
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Discretion is a funny thing, huh?  Especially as new technologies are
allowing us all to be reporters, authors, type-show hosts, and discussion
voyers.  That is, email is changing the way we communicate, because never
in our past have we had the opportunity to send little messages to 400+
people with the swift push of a button.  Not unless we were journalists, or
maybe steet-corner preachers.

I embrace fully the guidelines set forth in connection to this newsgroup.
In my review of the guidelines Brain put out, I found no specific reference
to the discussion of drugs.  This leaves it up to the individual to use
discretion when posting to SFR.

The topic of blatent drug talk has come up before and it seems that the
issue of whether or not it should be allowed (maybe that's to strong, how
about, excepted?) may never be resolved.  And that's why I recommend people
use discretion when they post.  You see, while we are all gatekeepsers of
our little forum, and while we all have the privlege to join in, the topics
discussed in the newsgroup reflect on every member of the newsgroup.  (Even
you, Mr./Mrs. Voyeur!  ;^)  As a proud member of SFR, and the SF rave
community, I am fully aware of the use of substances and their affects on
the individual and the whole at our parties.  I am not preaching for or
against drugs, I'm just saying that if someone has a question about drugs,
a message might read:  "I have a particular question about substances
(drugs, if you will) at raves in SF and I was wondering if someone might
offer me some advice.  Please email me privately for further discussion."
Of course, if the topic winds up being about a toxic substance being found
in a batch of local drugs, that might be an appropriate time to alert
people on SFR.

Now, I didn't mean to jump on Marisa for her post, in fact I mentioned that
I didn't mean to flame, I was just offering a reminder.  I'll even answer
her question:  There are very few faux pas one can make in the Bay area
rave community.  People here seem to embrace the old creeds, "Do unto
others, as you would want them to do unto you." and "Live and let live."
(but not "Live and let die.") and "I'm not gonna pass judgement on what you
do, as long as you don't pass judgement on what I do." and it's an
arragement that seems to work fine.  In short, no, you would not be
creating a faux pas.  Just ask the bearded guy next to you at the next
party.  ;^)

I love this reply:  "If you've been to raves in the SF area, then I'm
surprised if you haven't seen acid all over the place."  (Sorry Doug.)

Sadly, not long ago, a kid died after taking e at a local party.  His
father posted to SFRaves telling us the details surrounding the tragic
death of his son.  I was moved, as were a lot of people on SFR, I'm sure.
I couldn't help but feel that his curiosity surrounding his son's death
might pique him enough to subscribe to SFRaves and see just what kind of
people rave in the Bay area.  My premonition was suprisingly founded when,
about a month or so after his post, the father answered a question someone
asked on SFR.  I thought to myself, "Hmmm...there may be people on this
list that are very interested in who we are and what we do as a community."
I think of the father every time I post to SFR.  That's where I'm coming
from when I write that blatent drug discussions should be taken onto a more
personal sub-list.  I'm not saying we should curb our discussion because
someone outside the community might be watching, I'm just saying that we
should shut the blinds when we break out the scale.

Does any of that make any sense to you?  I'm not a flame thrower.  I'm not
an instigator.  I'm just a person who trys to communicate clearly,
concisely, and am concerned about how we are perceived as a whole.  There
are so many beautiful thing we have to offer, so many beautiful people, and
so much to shout about.  And then there are elements that only need a nod
of the head.

Cool? :^)

Tony

P.S.  Please, I beseech you, email me privately for further discussion.
This thread does not need to go on further in a public way.

P.P.S.  Discretion is not paranoia.  ;^)

Amen.  While I'd hate to see this forum degrade into one big drug bazaar, I 
do appreciate intelligent, educational, clinical discussion of the 
substances that are in use, the dangers and effects.  Not that I'm 
personally gonna run out and try anything new, but I enjoy the discourse.

Good point that is why many people who post or read the messages 
on those newsgroups are using anonymous or made up names. It is pretty
easy for someone to post with a handle.

there are alternatives like anonymous email accounts if you simply 
want to participate in or start discussions like these and don't have the 
need of being identified.

explore your options...

My two pesos is that I don't care if the entire multiverse reads my posts.
Most times I know when to post publicly and when to post privately; if
someone misunderstands something I say, it's not my problem, but I'm ready
and willing to clarify it using the most appropriate method to the topic of
discussion.  If you want to say something, but aren't sure if it's
"acceptable", be cryptic.  It will be understood.  Works for me!

Thanx,

I have to say, being a diehard househead, I've been going to Mecca on Fridays at
1015 every few weeks lately -- with Jeno, Markie, et. al spinning, I always go
with high hopes that good music will overcome a crowd that's not really my cup
of tea..  and once or twice I wasn't disappointed ....  but. ....

Last Friday, I was ready to throw in the towel ... just too alcohol-oriented,
bridge and tunnel, date-night for my tastes...  and way too cruisy....

BUT... the lineup and special guests for Nikita sounds SO GOOD...  so I just
wanna say, LET"S TRY TO SHOW UP THERE!  If we dancing raving fools can fill the
room, we can shift the vibe and help make it the place to go on Friday nights
(of course, unless there's a good underground thing goin' on...

So I'll give it a try ... if you all will too!  Look for flyers that let us in
free before 11 and we can start the place rockin' for nothin'!

That's true, I believe you can mail sameer@c2.org.  He offers anonymous 
email accounts (and remailers, too, I think).

	I guess I should have pointed that out in my post!  My main point
	more precisely is that if you are going to post using your real

	Real ravers don't worry how they're going to "seem" to people.
And for goodness' sake, please don't put substances in your body in 
order to please other people, or in order to fit in.  Do what you want to do,
and nobody is going to mind if your evening's preferred mental refreshment 
is different from theirs.

        Hey there, here's something me and a friend did to hand out at
parties a while ago. Hope y'all like it :)
========================================

"We are all connected"
____________________________
and do you know what connects us all?  On the net it's called
PLUR.  No, it's not a dishwasher detergent, it's an acronym that
stands for Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.  These are big words
and may be difficult to define but here are some ideas:

        Peace: The calmness you find with those around you, and
also inside of yourself.  It's tough, we often have to work at it
but when you're at peace with others, with ourselves and with
our planet only good can come of it.

        Love: The caring you feel for friends, for strangers, for
those in need and also for caring you show for yourself.  It's
symbiotic, it's about sharing whatever energy you put into
something will be returned to you!

        Unity: This means we all share a lot of common things,
regardless of our age, gender, race, orientation, whatevah! We
are all human beings, we all need other people, & we're all in this
for the happiness experienced being around others.  Though we
may have differences, we all arise from the same source.

        Respect: This may mean respect for others, their ideas,
their music, & their lives.  It's also respect for one's self; one's
body and the needs that it has (food, sleep).  Educating yourself
on the substances you ingest shows love and respect for your
body; passing on the knowledge to others shows respect and love
for your fellow person.

My first ambient performance was at the 2nd Mister Roger's neighborhood 
at the SC Civic. Immediately to my left there was a couple into heavy 
grope mode while I was performing. I felt so high that those two could 
feel comfortable enough in the room I had designed and was playing in. It 
really lifted me up and inspired me. Thanks =)

Being a complete baseball fan, I'm off on my annual trek to baseball spring
training in Scottsdale on Weds morning thru the weekend....

Does anyone have any suggestions of places in Tempe, Scottsdale (yeah, right,
not likely) or Phoenix (not too far a drive from Scottsdale though) where I can
get a house music fix?

My experiences in the past have been WAY awful, but it seems like there must be
some sort of low-key places that draw a relaxed raver-type crowd --where a woman
can dance alone without hassle -- and preferably places that are clubs or bars

early for baseball!)

Any private responses and suggestions are gratefully received! 

Thanks for helping keep me sane while I travel to the land of cowboys and

I'd like to add something to this: Respect for other people's property.  
This means not stealing, tagging, ripping, smudging, bending, folding, 
spindling, etc., anything that's not yours.  Leave it the way you found it.

Hi, everybody.  Yesterday I posted an entry called "Harmonious Experience,"
which detailed my experiences and revelations at the last Harmony.  But I
forgot to save it!  I would very much like it back, as it is like a journal
entry, a recording of a wondrous experience.

Please mail it to me if you haven't deleted yet.  Much appreciated!  N.

Dear friends,

Never say or do anything that you will regret later. Be proud of 
yourself.  Have faith in yourself, and always sign your real name.  
After all, isn't acceptance of ourself and others the ultimate goal of 
life?

I am glad that you see things in more than a linear fashion.  I wish
society as a whole would do this.  Fact is, the majority do not.  We draw
conclusions by what we see.  Many of the traits you describe can only be
found out by conversation, surely something we should do more of.  But you
cannot tell any of the things above by mere sight alone, and THAT is what I
meant.  We as a society, base much on what we see.  And in THIS society the
two things most apparent are race and sex, and not in that order.  YOU may
choose to operate outside of this, and that is good, but society has quite
a way to catch up to your way of looking at things.  Which I *DO* think is
enlightened.

Discrimination is rampant everywhere and takes many forms.  I dare not tryo
to micromanage the problem, I would rather deal with the most obvious, and
go from there.  So yes, race and sex are most prominent, and thus my
argument holds from my view.

Did I say equity in numbers?  All I rebutted against was your lack of
understanding as to why people want to see one of their own at a party or
on the dex.  I never mentioned numbers at all.  The rest of your argument
is based on that assertion, so let us move on.

By the numbers?  Well I can tell you the numbers are lower than previous
years.  Happiness, hard to guage on a party by party basis.  The world has
kept turning, and being in a place like SF makes my world view however
utopic, very skewed. Especially considering the reality of others.

Exactly, you would guess, that is far from knowing.  Try being a real
outsider, where the rules are foreign, the ways are foreign, and the tongue
is foreign to your present reality.  I hate to harp on color, but it IS the
most obvious in this society.  Just a suggestion to understand my view.
You see, I have always lived in a foreign world, I have just learned
adaptation, as any African in America would, as any woman would in a male
dominated world, as any blind person would in a world built for the
sighted.

Color matters little to me.  Ask my wife and son.  However, I do understand
that I exist in something much larger and greater than the rave community.
I exist in the world, not in a relatively small camp.  I am a citizen of
the society in which rave thrives, as well as existing in the rave world,
as well as existing in the Eurocentric world. And in these other spheres we
are defined not only by how we look, but how we act, who we associate with,
and how much money we have.  It is the capability of duality that allows me
to not only understand how you see the world, but how others may see it
differently.  I cannot divorce myself from that by creating a set of rules
for myself and rules for others.  I need some consistency, and try to
change the world in any way that I can.  Usually by talking to people who
are , in many ways other than race, far different than I am.  This is a
good thing IMO.  And just because you have found that perfect place for
yourself, that allows you to see the truth, does not negate other peoples
truths, their emotions, and most importantly their experiences, that exist
outside of your rules or views of the world.  How can we as a people get to
any understanding unless both sides are willing to see each other's
perspective, and have some empathy for them (remeber, walk in my shoes...).

I guess being born into a duality is quite different than creating a
duality of living.

Good is a relative term.  Your good is someone else's evil.  Would I pull
Hitler out from an oncoming bus.  No, I would not.  And yes, I would keep
my eyes open to make sure fate was dealt.  Not good or bad, some things
just is sometimes.

So, it would be fine for David Duke to champion Civil Rights by day while
at night bruning crosses on people's lawns?  See, relativisim has it's
extremes too.  And it does matter who does the good deed, and often it is
just important as to why one does good deeds.

Peace out my man.  It is always a pleasure talking with you as well.  Good
points all around, and you have shaken my paradigm a bit and opened my eyes
to the diversity that exists on many levels.  I love good banter and
debate.

THis is a ways off still, but I and others from Santa Cruz are planning a 
free outdoor party on campus at this beautiful ampitheater type thing, 
surrounded by mountains and redwood... tenatively planned for May 25 
(sat).  I'll update closer to the real thang, but would any of you be 
down for the travel for such a thing?  It would go from about noon to 
sundown, and there will be about three DJs.

Starchild,

By no means was I toying with you!  As I said before, you are a 
beautiful human being, both physically and mentally.  Last Wed. night 
when we ate and talked after the film, I was thrilled with your spirit 
and the incredible amounts of _positive energy_ that emanate from you! 
Remember when I told you that the scene needs more people like you, 
because that is how change of any kind comes about.  The light in your 
eyes when you discus how the future can be is so inspiring!  

I was being little bit facetious with the groping offer a because on 
Wed. night you held the hand of another woman, and I could not ever come 
between two people.

Peace, Love, Unity & Respect

Diana Greer

hi...

playing devil's advocate, does accepting yourself mean announcing 
everything about yourself to the whole world...even to those whose sole 
purpose is to seek out people who are like you and jail them or hurt 
them?  if there are such things you want to reveal about yourself is this 
correct forum?

maybe it is...if you feel the need to do it maybe you should.  i just 
think people should think a little longer about stuff they feel 
compeled to send before they press the send button (or ctrl-x in pine, 
unix forever!) including myself!  like i said, i'm just playing devil's 
advocate.

Brenda,

Of course we all need to use discretion when revealing/ not revealing 
ourselves.  _Especially_ if there is the potential that damage could 
occur from an announcement.  Geez, Brenda, lighten up!  I don't 
think anyone would feel that it is appropriate to divulge every 
last part of their life to a newsgroup, even a newsgroup as accepting as 
hyperreal.  

Diana, (I really don't care who knows my last name) Greer

Hi folks!

  I just finished writing an essay (about 13 pages double spaced) 
concerning Raves as modern day rites of passage. If there is any intrest 
I would be happy to post it but I don't think sfraves is quite the right 
spot. Would folks like to read it and where do I post it? I could announce 
on sfraves that it is posted somewhere.

Thanks! =)

mostly has a speedy effect for a few hours tingly arms - people I know who
take them a few hours after packing a bowl to rise up out of that drowsy

the effect wears off =3D very tired.

	Kind of funny things...hugs.  It's really nice to be able to hug
people instead of just a hand shake or a nod of the head, but like any-
thing, hugs can be missunderstood.  I have no problem with hugging males
or females (I'm told I give pretty good ones too!) and I'm usually re-
warded with an equally warm hug.  But I have to admit, I think I've
recieved more confused or dirty looks from hugging another male than from
hugging a female.  The way I see it, hugs are hugs...just like a hand shake,
but with your whole body!  =)  If you should feel violated by a hug, it 
would prolly be best to avoid that person in the future, or tell him or her
to tone down their hugs a bit.....
man.....I gotta stop babbling......anyway...a hug is a terrible thing to waste,
and generally a wonderful thng to recieve.

 I agree with that. You need to watch out for numero uno before anybody

Hi!

 Someone replied to my posting below saying I could post at his website. 
I accidently deleated the mail :( Could this person remail me please? I 
think his name is David.

Hi folks!

  I just finished writing an essay (about 13 pages double spaced) 
concerning Raves as modern day rites of passage. If there is any intrest 
I would be happy to post it but I don't think sfraves is quite the right 
spot. Would folks like to read it and where do I post it? I could announce 
on sfraves that it is posted somewhere.

Thanks! =)

hello all-  i've been lurking the past month, in contrast to my normal
participation- i have been rather busy, and i haven't had time to respond to
many threads that i would like to respond to.

just one comment - KEEP THESE WONDERFUL FLAME WARS GOING!  I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'D DO WITHOUT THAT NEGATIVE ENERGY IN MY LIFE!!!!! (at last count, 2
strands of rather negative message posting.  not that disagreement is bad, i
revel in it.  i also revel in a certain civility and positive regard for
each other while disagreeing.)

if i'm overreacting, i'm sorry =) . but i've been using my delete key far
more than i'm normally comfortable with, i.e. deleting entire threads that
drain my life energy.

i love you all, but sometimes we, as a group, think that if we have PLUR on
our side, we can do no wrong (sounds familiar, doesn't it?)

peace, love, and more fucking love-

i figure it is about time i post something. i have been following the list 
now for quite some time but havent gotten around to posting. i just got 
home from MAD and, as usual, had insane amounts of fun. the music was a 
spectacle of sound for my ears. i met many sweet and friendly people. 
were any of you there?

the only problem with MAD is that it ends way to early.

by the way- the person writting this right now is not joshua. i am sarah. 
me and josh, who is my brother and roommate, both follow the list from this 
account.
hope the rest of you danced as hard as i did tonight and had as much fun.

luv sarah

Just a reminder for all of you that want to help out or just show up at the
meeting, it's March 13th Weds at 8pm at the Denny's off of Hwy 101 and the
Woodside west exit...please come with ideas, suggestions, and of course
smiling faces. I want this Picnic Party to be a good one for everyone here,
so the more people that can help the more fun everyone can have. So just to
give me an idea of who would like to help and come to the meeting pls let me
know. For those who can help but for some reason can't make it to the
meeting, let me know as well. Also for those of you that are coming to the
meeting that can offer rides for those that want to come but don't have a
way to get there, pls do. I have 2 spaces and if your not too tall 3 spaces
in my truck if you live in the Sunnyvale , San Jose area. It's has an
extended cab with 2 seats. If you don't plan to attend the meeting but can
donate equipment, want to bring food or what ever, just email me with the
details and I'll make a list. Also I will be holding another meeting
probally in the last week in March or first week in April then maybe one a
day or 2 before the event to gather last minute details.
So let's make this a good one.
 
Tim (knucklehead)

Totally!  My ultimate goal is to reach a heavenly place when I pass from
this life, and to do what I can to help as many others do the same as
possible.  'Course, many things play key parts in achieving this, and among
them I'd include Diana's above thought.

Peace,

Hey, I tried sending this before but it never showed up on the list (I think?) so 
here goes again.....


Hi, and what a miserable monday it is (rain 'n all). So to remove some of this 
miserableness here's a quick joke...

Once apon a time there was this raver wondering through the woods when suddenly he 
heard this tiny voice. He looked down 
and there before him was a slimy green frog. The frog said "If you kiss me, I'll 
turn into a beautiful princess and kiss 
you!". The raver shrugged then picked up the frog and put it in his pocket and 
wondered off. Soon after the frog 
interruped, "If you kiss me, not only will I turn into a beautiful princess, I will 
have sex with you!". The raver 
paused and continued on. Again the frog spoke, "If you kiss me, I will have sex 
with you for a whole year!". Again no 
interest. "I'll be your sex slave for life, you can do anything you want!!!". The 
raver kept on going. The frog finally 
preturbed asked, "Why won't you kiss me and change me into a person?". The raver 
stoped, "But I see beautiful people 
everyday; a talking FROG, now that's something special..." :]

Better drum samples are a must! I reversed the sample and it sounded 
killer (also added some more echo for that acidy trancy feel).

Good luck in your endevours...

        It has occurred to me that, in my rudeness, I never bothered to

if that bothered anyone, I apologize.  My question to y'all is: should I
send out a post to introduce myself?  If so, what is appropriate for an
introduction?  Far be it from me to intentionally commit a breach of

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Food Not Bombs (FNB) sponsored a small party last Saturday.  It rocked!

The space was fairly limited, and there was a sizable number of FNBers
there, so I guess word was kept pretty local to those close to FNB.  In any
event there was great music and a really nice, sort of mixed crowd, what
with ravers and FNBers all mixing into a big ol' melting pot on the dance
floor.

The location was a cool hidden studio space in Oakland.  Walked through a
gate and entered into a very cool, lush atrium.  Sliding scale tickets
($5-$10) at the door.  Through the atrium and into a greeting room with low
ceilings, sort of a nice lounge area with black lights and sofas.  Past
that and into the main room which opened up wide with high ceilings. The
walls were painted in this totally rad high-gloss black, orange and green
pattern that looked excellent in black light.  The dance area was about the
size of Komotion maybe (?).  Juice bar off the dance floor (excellent juice
bar, BTW and only $1!), through some thick drapes to an ambient area
replete with wonderful shrine.  One other chill area above that (up this
trippy stair case off the dance floor that had an indoor balcony off it,
making one feel like they were in New Orleans or a Spanish villa), that was
someone's bedroom and had mattresses all over it.  A puppy-pile magnet.
:^)

I believe it was Heather (of Heather, Todd and Sarah), who brought the two
groups together, and it seemed as if everyone hit if off.  The night
started with a great drum circle that served as a nice warm up.  Ethan
mixed in really well with the drums and then let a record fly and proceeed
to mix a great seamless set.  He was followed by Minor Minor who always
seems to be having so much fun back there it's hard not to smile when you
watch him mix.  Another great set.

Through it all the drums kept up.  They couldn't push the volume too much,
so it was interesting having the drums at an almost equal volume with the
music.  Most of the time that was great, but admittedly there were a couple
times, when the music was building, that the drums drowned it out.  It's
all good though, you know, and people kept right on dancing, and the
drummers kept right on drumming.

BIOJeff spun after Minor Minor and lit the crowd on fire with some really
nice mixing of old and new tunes.  Following Jeff was (I might get this
wrong) Michael Paul?  And after him Jimmy Hawkin.  I first heard Jim at a
New Moon party at Goat Rock and was so psyched to hear him spin again.
Excellent set.  Following Jim, Gabber Dave came on at about 7am.  You gotta
love gabber as a come down for the legs.  I mean, I'm sure everywhere else
in the world people work up to gabber and then slow it down, but somehow
Dave manages to hit the decks early in the morning, and thus we dance hard
at the end.  He spun a cool, short set to end it all.

All the while the ambient area had Claire, and Joe Rice spinning, plus some
others I'm not sure of.

All in all a great little party.  Lots of happy FNBers who seemed happy to
have their space invaded by freaks.  Thanks all, organizers, DJs, system
controllers, drummers, and revelers under the black lights.

:^)
Out!

Tony

P.S.  This party was special for a lot of us, for it was our last
opportunity to say good bye to Bill and Gaby who are heading to India for a
year.  Those that know them know how important a role they have played in
our community in the past years.  I think I speak for us all when I wish
them god speed and a safe journey.  Fare-thee-well, my friends,
fare-thee-well...

	I think one of the most important points here is that going to 
jail is not what will happen to anyone who posts about drugs. What will 
happen, is you will be flagged down with supposed evidence, arrested 
(which produces an arrest number which goes on your TRW which is checked 
by prespective employers and landlords before hiring you or giving you a 
place to live), and then given a chance to bargain - you give us some 
names, you go free... This happened to a friend of a friend, so, 
is it paranoid to not blab around a public archived forum, or just 
watching your ass? I don't think it becomes a matter of what can be 
proved, it becomes of a matter of who you are suspected of knowing.

It's important to remember that you can go to jail at any time, with or
without reason.  A police officer can come up with some "suspicion," and
lock you up for up to 48 hours, then either book you or release you.
They're not that eager to blemish someone's personal files, though.  I've
had lots of encounters with The Man, and I still have excellent credit and
no trouble getting work or housing.  Nevertheless, a little paranoia is a
very healthy thing!

If you can't be good, be careful...

Howdy doo everyone!

I heard rumor that Chrysalis might happen this Saturday, the 16th.  I 
hope this is true because I have the night off and will be in the city. 
I have a job interview that morning at Mt Tamalpais state park, so wish 
me luck!  Chrysalis that night would make for the perfect day.

Dave,

I have never said, nor will I ever say anything in this newsgroup that 
will cause me to be flagged down with supposed evidence, arrested, and 
taken to jail.

Sincerely,

Diana Greer

If anyone needs a ride to the SFR Ski Trip from the South Bay or East Bay, let
me know.  I have room for 3 in my car, possible 4. I'm planning on leaving
Friday night around 6pm or so.  Maybe earlier if I can skip out of work before
then.

For those of you who have been heading out to camping parties, spring is 
nearly here and those parties will be starting up again. So as I was 
looking round the Dune page, I found this little page which will help 
ease the tread we make on the earth as we build mini-communities on the 
weekends. For those of you who haven't been to a camping party, they can 
be quite enlightening...

<H1>Leave No Trace</H1>

<H2>Questions and Answers</H2>

<img src="Images/TornLine.GIF" WIDTH="100%"><P>


<H4>What is LNT's mission?</H4>
The mission of the Leave No Trace program is to create a nationally recognized educational system that promotes land stewardship, minimum-impact skills, and wilderness ethics.<P>

<H4>What is the need?</H4>
America's recreation lands, from state parks to vast wilderness areas, are being used and enjoyed by more and more people.  Their non-motorized use, be it hiking, camping, river-running, hunting, or other outdoor activities, leaves an individual and cumulative mark on the land.  Until now, educational efforts have lacked a common direction.  Leave No Trace will be that recognizable educational thread.<P>

<H4>What does it take to be involved?</H4>
First, it takes an interest in improving minimum-impact education on a personal and national level.  Are you interested in Leaving No Trace of your recreational visit to America's public lands?
Beyond that critical first step, the extent of your involvement with the national LNT program depends on your particular situation.  Become a LNT Member by filling out an application and educating yourself with free LNT materials.  If you are part of an organization that has a mission or structure that allows for displaying the LNT message and training others, or contributing financially, become a LNT Partner.  If your company or organization has a strong interest in providing energy, enthusiasm, resources and direction to the program, consider becoming part of the LNT Leadership Group.<P>
 
<H4>Why get involved?</H4>
Recall the character of the nation's backcountry when the 1964 Wilderness Act was signed and think about the plethora of fire-rings, trampled vegetation, unburied feces, and litter visible in popular areas today.  Now stretch your view into the future.  What regulatory and environmental changes will 30 more years of use bring to America's recreation lands?  The public's individual and cumulative marks on the land become more numerous with each season and so the restrictions and regulations placed on wildland recreation also increase.<P>

Regulations dictate behavior.  Education builds on ethics and personal experience to promote appropriate action.<P>

<H4>Why is the LNT program effective in educating the public how to recreate more responsibly?</H4>
Leave No Trace is first and foremost an educational program based on proven instructional models and scientifically researched principles.  We are marketing this substantive message to the nation.
Additionally, the four levels of LNT structure (federal Steering Committee, Leadership Group, LNT Partners, and Members) encourage diverse participation which utilizes an individual's or organization's particular strength while tying LNT together under a common and recognizable umbrella.  This built-in diversity will spread the message into the hearts and minds of the recreating public.<P>

<H4>What are the benefits of LNT involvement?</H4>
Besides participation in a positive educational program which works in concert with federal land management agencies and other industry-leading organizations, LNT Partners and Leadership Group members also receive approved use of the LNT logo, materials, and message, as well as public referral as a LNT source.<P>
  
Financial contributions will be magnified and matched by the synergy of partners in the nationally- recognized LNT marketing program.
Individuals, companies and organizations involved with the national Leave No Trace program have the knowledge and satisfaction that their contributions of energy and resources are helping to improve the level of minimum-impact education available to America's non-motorized recreationists.<P>

<H4>How is LNT information dispersed now?</H4>
Today, there are LNT pamphlets, posters, brochures, training curricula, and videos that fit the basic needs of our current target audiences (federal agencies, user groups).  But to become a truly national program, in which Leave No Trace ethics and techniques are a part of all recreationists' outdoor experience, much more needs to be done.  There is a great need for print media attention, outdoor product and retailer involvement, more regional curricula and an expanded training and materials catalog.  LNT needs television and video exposure.  Classroom teachers regularly request LNT curricula and non-English versions of LNT for school-age folks.  
The more we succeed, the more diverse our needs become.<P>

<H4>Is there a political agenda associated with the LNT program?</H4>
No.  Leave No Trace seeks only to educate non-motorized recreationists on how and why to minimize their impacts while enjoying public lands.<P>

<H4>Is LNT just a slogan?</H4>
Leave No Trace is already much more than a slogan and the program has immense potential.  Quality educational materials exist and are being distributed.  Hands-on field training is in progress through the Masters of LNT program.  Federal, educational, and outdoor industry partners are collaborating on the LNT program.  The public is hungry for LNT's message and the educational model works (as evidenced by the 30,000+ educational contacts LNT Masters made and the approximately 5,000 information requests received in 1993).<P>

<H4>How is success measured?</H4>
The ultimate goal of Leave No Trace is improvement in the condition of America's diverse recreation lands and thereby preserve the wilderness experience.  However, accurately measuring objective and subjective national conditions with the tools and resources available to today's recreation ecologists is essentially impossible.<P>

The best measurement of Leave No Trace is by national visibility and quantified industry, government, and public participation:  How many educational materials are distributed?  How many individual Scouts or Scout Troops are involved?  How many state and federal land management offices display LNT information?  How much outdoor industry packaging carries a LNT message?  Numbers and trends such as these will give us a reasonable measurement of the success of the program.<P>

Intuitively, we all know that the LNT message is important and that its concepts make sense.  Together we have the ability to educate the nation and reverse current trends of recreation-caused resource degradation.  America's recreation lands and waters are finite, and human pressure seems boundless...  We must do everything we can now to teach ourselves and others to Leave No Trace.<P>

<H4>Who are the federal partners?</H4>
Four federal agencies are partners in the Leave No Trace program. Representatives from each agency serve as the LNT steering committee.

Hey all

Just got back from Seattle, boy they have a pretty marked lack of 
parties from what I could find, could only find about 1 or so, some 
enormous $20 affair that I ended up not trying out.  But the big bummer 
is, I was digging through the Seattle Weekly paper looking for stuff to 
do on Saturday March 9th, and what do I see but "Derrick May & Stacey 
Pullen in Seattle FRIDAY MARCH 8th!!"  Had to pull a big Homer "DOH!" 
with that one!  After hearing all the hoopla about 'em, that woulda 
been awesome to go see it up in Seattle unexpectedly.  Feh.  Oh well, 
missed it by just an evening.  

And what was that mention I saw of a Chrysalis this upcoming weekend, 
Sat March 16th?  Is this really so?  The last time I checked the 
voicemail said it would be the last or second to last saturday of the 
month.  Does anybody know if this has changed?  God I wanna go to a 
good party, haven't really been to one since the last Harmony, will 
probably be a couple of weeks before I get to another.

Love,
Shawna

	sorry i didn't get your post in time, shawna.  there isn't always
something worthwhile or even looking worthwhile always happening up here 
in the northwest as far as trying to find out what's happening if you're 
not from the area.  did that make sense?  but, there are some beautiful 
people here starting  creating open and sharing communities from potluck 
dinners to spiritual dance gatherings.

but, do you see why i come down to SF?  oh yeah, for sushi...yeah right!

well now that I've lost my job and I won't be leaving for London till the
end of April, I was wondering if anyone was interested in hiring me as a DJ
(either triphop, uptempo ambient or basic funky breakbeat trippy acid house
shit).........I need the work and I am most reasonable.......(I mostly
don't charge at all) but I'm in the pinch till I leave..........thank-you
and salutations.......moonpup   415-337-6666

I also remember Claire posting about an afterparty that was supposedly

wondering if anyone did go.  Did it get rained out?  What happened?

As far as I know, laudanum is a depressant that was widely used in 
Victrian days and earlier to help calm you down and get to sleep.  In 
high enough doses it's a poison, like other similar substances.  it's 
mentioned in Interview with the Vampire too.  Also i think it was used as 
a sedative for people during operations way back when before they 
discoverd sodium pentothal ....

yup, I believe it was commonly used with a liquor such as rum or 
cognac.

I am not familiar with what you're trying to do, but nonetheless, I doubt
Denny's would be the best spot for me.  Last time I checked, they didn't
serve colored folk ;).

(I know the lawsuits, at least most of them, have been settled.  I still
would never set foot in any of those establishments again.  Ever.)

Peace, luck & best wishes (seriously) w/ the plans,
John

Dear Geoff,

My friend in Cincinnati is very new to the rave scene, and would like 
some recommendations of music to buy that would give him an idea of the 
broad spectrum of rave music styles.  The names of Cincinnati stores to 
buy them in would be appreciated also.  I know that this is a tall 
request, but hey, the rave community just grew by one today, and the 
industry will thrive thanks to his interest, and his disposable income 
that will now flow this way!  (Capitalism helps many good causes grow.)

Peace,

Diana

just got back from Deep Space at Gregg's Bar in downtown San Jose.  I 
think it was Ernie Munson and Spun? The small place has become even 
smaller than what I remember because they built a stage in one corner now 
which takes up hella room.  Didn't get sorta full until 11:30 and then 
started to pick up.  This tuesday event has lots of potential if you 
ignore the mirrored ball.

Got a flyer for a wednesday weekly called

_float_
wednesday at Scalawags
14 South 2nd st. (Next to toons?)
Julius Papp, Harry Who?, Rick Preston
Spinning the platters that matter
free b4 10, $3 after
21+ i.d.

I'm gonna check it out.

Dear Ran,

Sure it's long, but no one is being forced to read it, and I'm sure I'm 
not the only one who would take pleasure in doing so.

Dear Friends & Family,

	Enough already... I'm willing to be the SFRaves canary.  I am 
publicly stating here, on the record, that I have taken Exstasy, LSD, 
mushrooms, pot, GHB, and speed, and with the exception of speed I expect 
to be taking these drugs again, for the simple reason that in my opinion 
the experience is worth it.
	There; it's said.  If I get arrested for exercising my freedom of 
speech, then we will know that it is not safe to speak freely of such 
matters on SFRaves.  If not, well, then I hope some of you will feel 
safer than you do now.  :)
	Just in case we are not now being monitored and in danger of 
being arrested, but may become so in the future, I will post this 
message periodically as the issue of self-censorship comes up.
	Obviously I am not expecting to get arrested for this, but if by some 
fluke I do, I hope those of you who care about freedom of speech (most 
all of you, I would hope), will take appropriate actions.

Yours in liberty,
				<<< Starchild >>>

There might be a chance that I might be in Tahoe this weekend.  Could 
someone give me the info on the party there.  I know its kinda late, and 
would make my own sleeping arrangements as its probably pretty crowded 
already.  I'm willing to donate $ and happy love vibes to the party if I 
get up there and can find out the where and whens.
Thanks for any info,

:)

I think that it might be a better idea to post it on SF Raves WWW page.
Lots of precious bandwidth being taken up by a 13 page letter going out to
everybody.

For the record - many people misunderstand "freedom of speech"  while
it allows you to TALK about drug consumption, government overthrow,
racism etc.  it does NOT protect actions ( which are NOT speech )....

So you can talk about drug consumption in an abstract way all you want -
even William F. Buckley does that....  but a direct admission of drug
use and/or specific activity are definitely NOT protected by the speech
amendment... of course another specifies that you can't testify against 
yourself but by then the harm could be done....

  For the newbies on sfraves who haven't had it explained - it's been 
gone over several times before.... when on a public forum such as this
only say what you'd be willing to say in public ( how about the Mayor's
or police chief's office? ) and keep things abstract....

  SO it's fine to discuss the effects of E, LSD etc on the scene, or share
information about their effects on people... etc.  but it's prudent to
avoid specifics about consumption such as who , what, when and where.
Thus, No one ever said there can be NO drug discussions on sfraves - only
that specific details should not be aired publicly.... information NOT
disclosure....

If that makes sense....

Mike

	Actually, you are only protected against being _forced_ to testify
against yourself. Sending a public message to a forum like this isn't forced,
and so there wouldn't be any problem in using it as evidence against you.

	Only thing is, what if what people say here _is_ what they would say
in public? Not everyone hides their chemical use...

> If that makes sense....
	Yep, it did.

hi folks,

sf-raves is a great place to meet groovy people.  i personally love getting 
together with folks i've met here for food or whatever or go to 
pack-a-bowl or something low key like that.  it's a good way to have 
nice conversations and exchange information.  

peace,

bren :)

I agree.  In fact, please do *not* post it to the list, but instead 
coordinate with dhchung@hyperreal.com to have it posted on the SFRaves 
web pages.

I want to thank everyone who took the time to send me lots of uplifting
messages yesterday.  I went home tired, happy and feeling very accomplished. 
If anyone ever needs big smiles, hugs, or eskimo kisses to cheer up a
stressful day just let me know.  It gives me as much joy to give them as it
does to get them.

Thanks a mil

I love when people post intros.  It's neat to get an idea about the 
person.  Who cares how you introduce yourself.  Say anything you want.  
There shouldn't be any rules that should limit your self expression!! :)  
Maybe in the spirit of the list, you can add something about how raving 
has affected you or anything like that!  I first came on this list when 
ppl were doing bios (now found on the sfraves homepage) and it was very 
wonderful to get an idea about who everyone was.  For me, it provided a 
sense of community, but that's just me!!

happiness,
kc

Subject: NEW INFO SFR PARTY MEETING
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Here's the deal, out of 6 or 7 people that said they would come to the
meeting only 2 so far has said the will be there, and the others can't make
it due to something came up or whatever, which is fine. I was hoping alot
more would want to show, and help with the planning of this picnic but I
also understand it is on a weekday and people are still working, live to far
away, or doesn't have a way of getting there. So, if you want to come to the
meeting pls let me know by at least 2:30 today. For those of you that
already emailed me saying you will be there don't worry about emailing me.
If by 2:30pm I don't get any other people to show I will reschedule this
meeting for either the end of this month or the first week in April. If this
is the case, I will take it upon myself to make most of the arrangements. As
far as location, food, and whatever it takes to get this Picnic Party to
happen. I don't really want to be the only one, because this is for everyone
here and would like input from others, but I will do it myself if I have to.
My other option is, to just forget this meeting all together and have the
first meeting be the first week in April. All the people that want to help
out just email me what you want to help with, food, drink, DJing, supplies,
equipment, offering rides, set-up, clean-up, and anything else you can think
of. I will make a list and put you on it for that. And then at the meeting
in the first week of April we will go over the list to make sure everyone
that said they would do something, will still be able to do it. We will see
if there is anything we missed and have someone cover it. The only major
concern is the sound system right now. This is what I plan on doing for this
Picnic Party. I'm going to bring my BBQ If needed, it is plenty big enough
to cook most everyones food together(same length as my truck bed) I'm going
to try to bring some ribs, hamburgers, hots dogs, and some stuff to make
veggie burgers and possibly some bbq veggies as well. I will bring some
potatoe salad and maybe some baked beans. I'm going to bring a portable sink
that has two basins in it to wash and rinse the dishes and what not. I will
also try and bring 1 or 2 other long tables to place things on, but not 100%
positive on that one, just 85% sure. Now of course I will NOT bring all this
food to feed hundreds of people. I'll try to bring as much as I can.
Possibly enough for 20-40 people, I'm not sure yet. This is what I need help
on. If we can get about 10-20 people to bring some kind of food for about 10
or more people as well as drinks then I think this will turn out pretty
good, it doesn't have to be anything fancy, something like some type of
salad, veggie stuff, meat stuff to BBQ, whatever, If you are willing to do
this, please let me know. Like I said before, I'll put it all on a list and
we can go over it when we have our meeting the first week in April. So let
me know what you all think. Let me this happen together and have a great
time doing it. Thanks.

I'll wait a little longer before deciding about the meeting. So far 3 people
besides myself, extending it until 4:00pm for now. Pls let me know if you
can make it. Thanks for the replies I've gotten so far. I'll put your names
on my list, both for showing up to the meeting and for what your offering to
bring or help with.

I can't make it to the meeting but I am more than willing to help to 
make this happen.  I could bring some kind of veggie dish.  Today's 
abundance of sunshine is definitely inspiring me to want to picnic with 
the rest of you people.  I'm sure that there is a high number of us that 
could use the fresh air and good food ;)

moonshine has a _lot_ of good stuff... specifically:

*Psychotrance 1 (hardtrance, mixed)
*Concept in Dance 1 & 2 (goa)
*Drum&Bass collections (good jungle: esp. #3: the mixed-by-djHype version)
*United States of Ambience (1, 2, 3)

I've heard a lot of complaints that this label is too "commercial" or
whatever, but I've gotten some of my best comp CDs through them. Oh yeah,

*Rising High Trance Injection
*Artificial Intelligence 1 & 2

and some non-compilation good stuff:

*ORB - live 93
*Aphex Twin - classics
*Shamen - Axis Mutatis
*the Prodigy - music for the jilted generation
*FSOL - lifeforms

I have never been to Cincinnati, so I can't recommend any stores.

Well I'm going to postpone the meeting for now. This only means we will not
be meeting today. I'm still looking for people to help out. So if you want to
help, send my email telling me what you want to help with or if you can bring
anything. I'll be making a list from the responses I get as well as what I'll
be providing and reschedule the meeting for the first week in April and bring
the list to the meeting to update it. I'll be looking and checking out
different places to have it in the next week or so. If anyone has ideas or
suggestions with anything pls let me know. I already have a few people that
are willing to help with bringing things. My concern right now are Sound
system and what people can bring or donate to this event. So once again, if
you want to help, let me know with what you want to help with and I'll make a
list from that and talk about it at the meeting in the first week of April.
Sorry for being so repetative, but we have to get this info together if we
want to make this happen. Planning everything early give us that much more of
an advantage of having a great time and not have to worry about last minute
details as much. Thanks for putting up with all these post and let get all
this planning done and over with, so we can have the best BBQ & BEATS PICNIC
PARTY ever.

Hey everyone...
	I just wanted to send a complete post out thanking everyone who 
helped with our data base on where dj's are from...you'll be happy to 
know that from a list of over 600 dj's we didn't have cities for the list 
was down to 159...
Unfortunately we have managed to make the list again over 500 dj's that 
we again need cities for.
As I have stated in the past our database is currently in the work 
process and hopefully, the first batch will be ready to be pressed into CD
Rom at the conclusion of the summer.
The database will include such information as different parties, 
locations, dates, prices, dj's spun, lighting, sound and optics 
companies, production companies, telephone numbers and any e-mail 
addresses we may have...
if there are any further questions feel free to contact myself or Matt...
at "ravedata@partnercomm.com"
Once again...Thanks sos much for all your help...
Ravers are definitely THE BEST!!!
Love-
Nicole

CD-ROM?  For some reason I was under the impression that this information
would be made free for ravers to check out on the WWW.  Instead, we are
going to have to buy the infomation we provided for free?  I don't know
if I would have spent 30 minutes filling in all the cities for DJ's
I knew... for someone else's business venture.  All I have to say
is that it better be one hell of a cd-rom.  And I don't think putting
at least the DJ Database on the web would be such a bad idea... I could
provide the megs...

Please don't "group reply" to this unless you feel it is absolutely 
necessary.  I would be happy to discuss this with anyone through
private e-mail.

Hey gang does anybody have a room in the Northern part of S.F. for a fellow 
SFRAVER.  Christopher, a friend and fellow SFRAVER needs to find a place by the 
end of the month.  The Richmond, Laurel Heights, whatever...Since he works in 
Marin and recently sold out and bought a Marin car he needs a shorter commute and 
safer place to park (he's currently parking in the tenderloin=3 break ins YTD!)
  
Anyway I work with the guy, he designs club clothing and by my estimation gets 
along with anybody. Thanks for your all your help and consideration.

I think it is similar to the old commonsense dictum "Never say 
anything over the phone that you wouldn't say if there was a police 
officer standing next to you."  

I mean, free speech is one thing, and the First Amendment certainly 
does protect your right to broadcast where you hide your stash, but
people who put marijuana-leaf stickers on their car bumpers might
as well have a neon sign that says "Pull Me Over!"  

Discretion, as they say, is the better part of valor.

Love,
QSTR

Subject: Heartfelt Plea for an Open Forum
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


I'm disturbed by this trend toward self-censorship on our list.  If you
feel it's prudent to guard your privacy, use a pseudonym, or refer to
things obliquely.   But this thread raises a couple of issues for me:

1) "Raving and drugs have nothing to do with each other"
        In my last post "Harmonious Experience" I explored how, for me, a
fundamental part of the rave experience is collective mind alteration -
specifically, a group ecstasy experience.  The beautiful open and loving
mindset, the releasing of fucked-up mental baggage, is *INTEGRAL* to
creating the positivity of our subculture.  Raving and ecstasy are married,
happily.  No, they are not one, but they are complementary, for me.  I
don't want anyone else defining "raving" for *me*, and I would very much
like the right to share my definition to hear if others feel the same way.

2) Self- and group-censorship
        I am very upset at the counseling of many to avoid drugtalk on this
list (insert big unhappy face here).  I logged on here less than a week ago
in high hopes of finding a network of enlightened, beautiful people so that
we could openly share all of our thoughts and experiences on *every* aspect
of the scene.  I found the people, and now you're saying we have to limit
ourselves to "safe" topics!  Why not go to some random AOL chatroom if we
cannot discuss what we have in common as SFRavers?
        There is no-one monitoring this list.  Governmental bureaucracy is
completely overburdened and slow - the expenditure in time, money and
organization to have thousands of observors for the thousands of websites
on a system that they can't even figure out how to regulate (thank
God)....It's completely unfeasible.
        Yes, we may be researched in the future.  Hence, protect yourself
with anonymous accounts if you do indeed plan to run for President (in
which case, what are you doing raving?  There are many witnesses then to
*actual* activity!!  Many people have seen you having too good of a time!).


In the meantime, this is a heartfelt plea to PLEASE let this remain an open
forum for all of us to talk of any rave-related issue/experience.

P.S.  I thought we were creating alternative community.  WHY then are we
replicating the paranoia, closed-mindedness, and distance from each other
of the worst of mainstream culture??



Love is the Answer
Whatever the Question

That's pretty funny, but this very morning, I saw a car whose license

These concerns about discussing illegal activity have nothing to do with
First Amendment rights.  An admission of criminal activity is not criminal
speech, but it may, without touching in any way on First Amendment issues,
be used as evidence in a legal proceeding.  It's just a fact like a
photograph, witness testimony, or a fingerprint.

That said, I think concerns about open discussion here are overblown.  The
associations between Internet mail messages and real-world individuals are
so tenuous (forgery is trivial, accounts may be used by multiple people,
transport errors may produce inaccurate attributions, intentional or
accidental misuse of accounts by unauthorized persons is common, etc.) that
any lawyer smart enough to make it to the courthouse on time would croak a
case based on them in about five minutes.  Messages under your name may
still, of course, affect your reputation in the eyes of the reading public.

Hi there,

If any of you have been over to my loft and liked it, I just wanted to let
you know that the one directly across the hall is coming available soon...

For those of you that were at my house party last month, this is the unit
that had the people hiding inside calling the police on us :-) AND NOW
THEY'RE LEAVING!!!

So, if any of you out there that want to live down this way (Tennessee @
20th Street) drop me a note for more info.

Also, my friend Rusty (a fellow SF Raves lurker who also lives in the
building) and I have a T-1 to the Internet that you could get wired into
and other raver/geek niceties 'round here like computers, DATs, video
stuff, etc...

Speak to me, baby!

Dear all,

I very much enjoyed Nancy's post describing her experience with 
you-know-what at Harmony.  Her eager prose refreshed an otherwise dull 
day in the life of this stressed-out graduate student.

I love to read about people's experiences with one of the most miraculous 
pharmaceutical inventions- ecstacy.  

If Nancy has the guts to tell all about her experiences, then more power 
to her.  I enjoyed reading her post and feel it was one of the most vivid 
accounts of an E trip that I've read in a long time.

It brought to mind the thought that people who have never tried the drug, 
or for various reasons never will, often read with great interest what 
other people say about their experiences with ecstacy.  Personal accounts 
such as Nancy's are often the only way that people can find out about the 
state of mind this drug creates.  

I only wish the law of the land would loosen up a bit so that upstanding 
citizens such as ourselves wouldn't have to sneak around like bandits in 
order to listen to music we love- outdoors and all night!!! and indulge 
in one of the sweetest pleasures our technology has created.

Best wishes,

Ann

Nancy: 
>         There is no-one monitoring this list. 

Around a year or so ago, there was an article in a local (but fairly
major) newspaper about this list, about the things discussed here, and 
about some of the people who post here.  Full names were used, without 
permission.  A journalist from the gaurdian has made his presence known 
here, as well as the father of a raver who died from ecstasy-related 
complications.  During a recent rave bust, a cop was overheard
bragging about recieving the sfraves calender.

With freedom should come responsibility.  Would you argue in favor of
posting the locations of all underground parties (e.g. FMRs) here?
Party organizers tend to not favor this, and the community here has
respected that.

Because we do not exist in isolation from the worst of mainstream
culture.  But I don't think we need to be too paranoid, because there 
hasn't been a lot of useful information about illegal activities posted
here.  And let's face it, raves are probably viewed as more a nuisance
than a major crime problem.  How much do the cops really care about a
bunch of (mostly) white kids making a lot of noise and getting stoned?
But still, flies are attracted to shit, so I think it is irresponsible
to post stuff like "I went to the "Love Xcretion" party and scored
some killer e."

Nancy's words ring so true, people!  Any of us should be able to speak our
minds and offer our perspectives without being mistaken as representatives
of the whole group.  Are we supporting a diverse community (emphasis on the
last five letters: UNITY) of individuals, or are we a collective of clones?

Free your mind...

PLUR,

hi everybody,

i have found this discussion to be very informative and interesting.  as
usual, the people on this list have shared their thoughts and feelings on 
a subject that affects our scene in a intelligent and though provoking way.

i honor all of your feelings on the subject.  lee, i liked this last post 
from you.  nancy, i loved your harmonious post and i'm happy i had a 
chance to read it.  i have mixed feelings about the whole issue.  it does 
remind me, tho, of a concept of "we are all connected."  and i think, if 
we all got to know each other in a more personal way we would be more 
aware of the fact that what may affect one of us affects us as a whole.

having said that, be true to yourself and stay on your path whatever that 
may be.

yours in peaceful anarchy,

bren

>I'm disturbed by this trend toward self-censorship on our list.  If you
>feel it's prudent to guard your privacy, use a pseudonym, or refer to

This thread began when someone asked if they would "be making a faux pas by
taking acid at a rave."  She said that she had seen a lot of messages about
people dropping E at parties, but not acid.  So, of course, someone posted
"If you've been to raves in the SF area, then I'm surprised if you haven't
seen acid all over the place."

People, here's my plee:  USE FUCKING DISCRETION!  That's not saying, don't
talk about drugs, or the wonderful experiences we have with them.  As
Anthrax said, I too thought Nancy's post was very nice, poetic.  I have no
problem with that.  My stance is when we make enormously blatent comments
about the amount, size, quantity, proliferation, or inevitability of drugs
at parties.  And you know why!?

Because it is my dream as well, to one day have the law of the land
loosened up a bit "so that upstanding citizens such as ourselves wouldn't
have to sneak around like bandits in order to listen to music we love-
outdoors and all night!!!"

In making a case for ourselves, our archives may come into play.  Every
post MAY be a testament of our society.  Every person's words may be poured
over by our own children.  *OUR* children.  Show them the power of a good
thing, but let's try to avoid what the freaks did in the late 60s, and that
was come out touting the wonderful powers of acid, only to be eaten alive
by the media.  [Please, don't pick that bit apart, I don't want to be
responsible for that thread.  :^)]

I don't know if anyone knows how our email can be used, or searched in the
future; we know it can be searched pretty efficiently already.  I do know
that every email you send will inverably get stored on multiple servers and
that will get backed up on tapes, and those tapes will probably never go
away barring fire and brimstone.

I want to furthur [sic] our acceptance into the mainstream as much as you.
And I also want this group to be an open forum, free of censorship and
regulation, but I will continue to make an effort to let you guys know when
we are shooting our feet.  And without those, we can't dance.  :^)

Think about the impact of your posts on the group as a whole.  I just got
this as I was typing:  "Nancy's words ring so true, people!  Any of us
should be able to speak our minds and offer our perspectives without being
mistaken as representatives of the whole group..."  But you can't.  Don't
you see.  You can't!  Do you think that people (i.e., journalists, cops,
parents) who view this email will be able to pick you out as one who
doesn't necessarily represent the group?!  No!  They can't and if they ever
tried to make a case as us being a bunch of neo-hippies, who do drugs and
have nothing to offer society, then they won't want to.

Vision is an extremely valuable quality.  Vision, along with discretion is
not paranoia; it is making intelligent decisions about what you say and do,
and when you say and do them.

If I were to offer advice to the youth today, I'd say: Have vision and use
discretion.  And I'm saying the same thing to everyone on this list.
Envision raves as a part of mainstream society (if that's what we want),
and use discretion when discussion what might be percieved as negative
aspects of our community.

I promise you I will be part of the vanguard in our fight to garner the
respect we deserve as a positive force in society.  I will shout above all
in my attempts to be heard that we have so much to offer.  Together we will
take the music to the people, or at least to their children!  ;^)

Peace!

Tony

OK, so people are sounding like they think that they're right and everyone
else is wrong.  If we can at least agree that there's something right in
all the posts in this thread, we'll be able to piece together a stance that
we can all take comfortably.  So, what I get out of all this is: as long as
we're selective in the way we say something, we can talk about whatever we
want.
Are we to presume that we all own this list, and all call the shots?  Not
me!  If we can't reach a consensus, then it's time to appeal to the owners
of this list for a judgment call, IMHO.

Make love (in every way), not war :-)

He was reported to have said only that they received "a list" of parties
going on--from whom or in what form was not mentioned.  Some speculated
that the list might be the calendar, or based on it.

I don't know. I would suspect it's not a performance at all, but who knows.
This information was from their US manager's office, via Tamara @ Urb.

My computer tells me that on Wed, 13 Mar 1996, Michael shared:

	On the other hand, the statement could serve as my credentials, 
as in, "I was willing to stand up for freedom to trip when there was a 
possible price to be paid for doing so."
	I'm thinking of Vaclav Havel, President of Czechoslovakia and 
former jailed dissident under the communist regime before the wall came down.
	If I do get to be President, do you think the War Room in the 
White House would make a good ambient room?   8)

Sorry for the delay - there seem to be some network problems tonight.
If you read this in time, tonight's party is a good cause with a great
lineup - it's a benefit for our brother "A" Abbas Rezaei who has been 
fighting cancer for one year without medical insurance. It's his wish 
that all the profits from this party go to Cancer Research at UCSF.

Two questions:

        1. Mos Eisley Spaceport, Tuesdays, Club Boomerang.  This doesn't exist
           anymore, does it?  A friend of mine and I wanted to check it out
           this last Tuesday, and we didn't even go in.  The music that was
           coming out was anything but "house and cyber-trance".  It was a
           a live 80's rock band, and not very good rock at that.  So what's
           the scoop?

        2. What was the date that the last "Organic" was thrown?  It was at
           the "Home Base" in Oakland sometime last month.

I'm not part of this crew but do know dj Wizard.  I can honestly say 
these guys/gals are seriously trying to bring some good things to 
Sacramento. Diversity will be like a club due to its location but is 
more like a mini-rave that should be bi-monthly.

Anyone going let me know so we can hook up!

Well, hopefully those of you who go on the cabin trip have a wonderful 
time! We all can be there in the vibe though (warm emanations to all of 
you). I have to work but will go to Basics on Saturday. I will have my 
laminate fully exposed so if you see a 6'3' black haired tranced being on 
the dancefloor come up and say hi. FINALS ARE NEXT WEEK for me. So this 
will be a most welcome break from studying. Have fun everyone!!

I've recently concluded that its not just me.  Spring is here!.  Gleefull
hormones flyin around like pollen amongst the trees and peoples here in
downtown Sacramento.  All the girls and boys seem a bit more more plushious
and lovely today.  REJOICE PEOPLE, leave your chaos behind, toss these social
restrictions on intimacy out the window and explore!

It sounds Dilbert related, which would make sense, cause of course 
Dilbert & wedgies go hand in hand!

A zerbert is when you press your mouth on a person's stomach then blow 
real hard till you get them in hysterics!

Nusrat performed at the Zellerbach auditorium in Berkeley a few months =
ago. He did two shows... I went for both.. :) around 3 hours each... =
fantastic, magical, mystical and spell-binding.  I've loved his work =
ever since I heard him on Peter Gabriel's 'Passion - Music from The Last =
Temptation of Christ' (one of my all time favourite albums)... If you do =
want to get into his word, get the album 'Mustt Mustt'' (sp?) its more =
accessible than his tradtional stuff.... And is a good introduction to =
his magical voice...

Happy Friday, all!  I am soooooooo ready for Evolution.  My last party was
three weekends ago, so the time has come.  Hope to see as many of you
extraordinarily wonderful people there as possible :)  Say hello to the guy
with the long ponytail with the colorful terry haribands, and of course the
SHROOMARAMA t-shirt!
Our awesome sister Teegan (sp?) is down from Oregon, and plans to attend.
That, for me, is reason enough to go; the last time I saw her was at the
Harmony 2-year anniversary.

BIG hugz & smiles to all (uh-oh, that hugging thing again!)

Something fascinating has occurred to me regarding the rave scene, and I

I'm quite certain that, for the most part, not a single hour of the day
goes by without sexual thoughts crossing my mind.  So it's perplexing to me
that, when I'm at a party, and there are wall-to-wall beautiful, friendly,
sexy people, not a single sexual thought crosses my mind!  Can anyone
relate?  Any thoughts on why this might be?

Celebrating my strangeness,

it was applicable to what's goin' on here...err there..err whatever! :)

        It's just the normal tantric re-alignment of genital energy into
raw full-on total-body consciousness expansion. Err..well, i dunno, that's

Cool observations.  Thanks!  And, as I told someone else, I want everyone
to know that I'm glad this happens!  I think it frees me up to more fully
experience what's going on, rather than being "hung up" on one thing in
particular :)

Be joyous!

Yeah, I totally know what you mean.  The days are getting longer.  The 
extra light does wonders on my body and mind.  I thought spring would 
never come.  Isn't the world wonderful this way, ever-changing?  I feel 
great, and thought I'd extend it to all of you!!!  (now, if i could get 
out of this dang lab more!!!)

wishing spring happiness to all,

I haven't had any sexual thoughts since July!  Except for the last few 
weeks that I have been seeing someone new, so it is quite a nice change 
of pace for me. Higher states of consciousness don't really involve 
feelings of sexuality.  It involves the higher chakras such as the heart 
and mind (I'm sure Diane T. could elaborate better about this.) That is 
when you notice the beauty in all people in nonsexual way.  But the 
sexual part is nice, too, in the appropriate environment! ;)

love,
Amy

I can totally relate.  I am at my most asexual at raves, which is very 
funny.  For me it is the state of being I get to when I listen to the 
music and dance my heart out.  It is a sense of sharing with others.  
Sexuality can often be selfish (don't flame me for that:) in an instant 
gratification type of way.  At raves, I frequently find myself very 
sensual or sense oriented.  I enjoy being with people and sharing whether 
it be a hug or a kiss, whether it be a man or a woman.  Fixating on sex or 
sexual relations often creates weird tensions.  Instead I concentrate on 
individuals and personalities and the music and emotions and thoughts and 
on and on.  As I've said millions of times, the lack of sexual tension is 
very freeing for all involved, and is one of the reasons I was attracted 
to raves myself.  Frequently we are unknowingly forced to objectify people 
when we see them in a sexual way.  When we free ourselves from that, we 
allow the objectification to disappear and we can see the person as just 
a fellow human being.  

Please, don't get me wrong, sex ain't a bad thing :)  But, I 
find that sexual objectification is quite negative.  Sex is a very 
natural thing.  I don't understand why we have such hang-ups about it.  A 
lot is social conditioning and religious conditioning, we being a 
nation with a protestant history and all.  My friend, who is also on this 
list, always chides me about how I judge a party.  If I don't get hit on 
(by this I mean sexual objectification) then I think the vibe was great.  
When I start to get hit on in a negative manner, it somewhat distracts 
from the vibe for me.  I feel the ones who have objectified me and 
invaded my space (and I speak from only MY point of view), are not 
letting themselves go of societal and personal pressures.  They don't 
contribute to the vibe in a positive way.  (this is all gender neutral as 
it goes both ways between men and women or even members of the same sex)

I also want to add that being physically attracted to another human being 
is a wonderful thing and can be very complimentary, but only when it is 
heart-felt.  Objectifying them for your own selfish sexual reasons is  
very negative, and something that personally bothers me.   
Human beings can be attractive for a number of reasons, and not only 
because society says you should look one way. I find the most attractive 
people in the world are those that are confident and love themselves.  
You can tell these people when you see them, but they are few and far 
between in my experience.  I wouldn't necessarily consider myself that, 
but at times I think I do achieve it.  But, that is probably one of the 
lessons life has to teach me.  

Raving has treated me so wonderful.  I've shared so much with many 
people, and a lot has been because I opened myself up to people of both 
genders in a non-sexual way.  It allowed me to truly see what a 
friendship could be about.   I am reminded about the half naked woman at 
the sunset boat party.  It was wonderful that she felt free enough in 
that environment to do as she pleased.  I didn't see anyone reacting at 
all.  Both my SO and I commented on how lovely she was and what she must 
be feeling.  It challenged the assumptions I had made about everyday life 
and the feelings about sex I had grown up with.  I was taught that the 
body is something to hide, at least certain parts, because they are "dirty"!  
Just imagine if someone had done the same thing at a bar or other public 
event.  S/he would have been thrown out and been an object of many 
peoples' attention.

Those are my feelings on the topic.  I hope I have been clear enough and 
not offended anyone because that was not my intention!!! :)

luv n sex,
kc

Someone just brought their 2 year old into work.  He had his toy truck with 
him. Short little man with a flat top hair cut, cool jeans and denim jacket, 
and tiny little high-tops.  Quite the stylin' chap.  Big brown curious eyes. 
 Well of course everyone stops what they're doing and comes out of their 
cubicles to see.

At first he was glued to mamma's leg, but then as people asked him the 
standard questions, "How old are you?", "Is that a truck?", "Do you have a 
401k plan yet?", he began to brighten up.  And it's kind of surprising how 
many people, stark, cool, professional people, have toys somewhere in their 
cubes.  There were Elmo dolls, Koosh balls, squishy tension relieving toys.  
The IT director even had crayons... <?>... hm....  Anyway, I'm not sure who 
had more fun, the kid or the people whose workday he'd interrupted.

Then it was time to leave.  Everyone took their toys back to their cubicles, 
tucking them back into a corner of the desk, or up on a shelf next to some 
manuals, or into some drawer.  And everyone went back to work.

But it felt different.  It was a good morning.

	i doubt this is always true.  i think it's pretty damned rude

	i agree, but i want to say that i do not think this is a
	problem that the girls have.  if a bathroom is established
	as gender specific, it should be respected.  plumbing emergencies
	aside, of course.

	i would be real careful with your generalizations.  there is an
	amazing variety of sexualaties out there.  what you say may be
	true for many, but don't be so blanketing in your statements.

	i know wommin who have sexual appetites and attitudes that you
	would probably associate with men.  quite a few, in fact.  i
	know men that have attitudes you would see as being very female.
	girls get insanely horny, just like boys.  many fantasize about
	faceless strangers, or in objectifying manners - read nancy
	friday's person by person research on male and female sexual
	fantasies, i think you will be suprised (and it has the caveat
	of being rather good, true erotica).

	again, watch your generalizations, even though they are somewhat
	based on your perceptions of gender-reality... well whatever.
	wommin are the ones who are most objectified in our society,
	therefore your locker room theories hold some water - but i
	think you are reinforcing the undersides of the very objectification
	by making these distinctions... make sense?  smash it *all*,
	not just the oppression.

	one thing i have adopted is that i *always* put *both* seats down
	(if there are two available - seat and lid).  this has two uses:
	1: someone who is going to pee standing up who has to lift the
	lid will probably lift the seat at the same time
	2: people who complain about the seat not being left down for them
	(many of whom also complain that it is not clean and tidy) will have
	to lift the lid anyway.  it's kind of vengeful, but in the end
	it sort of smooths out balances.  that way *everyone* has to
	move the damn thing.

	and there's not much to see when a girl is on the can.  hey, i
	think i am a total stranger to you.  mind if i hang out in your
	bathroom next time you pee?  *inside* the stall.  nice comfy stall.

	and, if on the off chance you really *don't* care about that (lots
	of people don't) then i should remind you that regardless of how
	silly it is, people who want a little privacy to do their number
	are entitled to it.

> Anyway ...  we surely are straying into interesting territory here, aren't
we?

	oh yeah.  we certainly are.  gender politics is such a fun topic.

	one of my favorite mix tapes is called "ick pit".  it is
	a live recording of a chill set i spun at a party in santa

	same gropefest everyone has been talking about.

	why the name ick pit?  because someone walks in, not knowing

Hello Rocky...

Thank you for your response. Your post, I felt, was unthreatening as far as
igniting an ego battle and showed no signs of a condescending attitude. I,
therefore, feel open to respond.

To begin, I'd just like to say that whatever rebuttles you may have had...
you're probably correct about each and every one of them. What I offered
WERE, in fact, generalizations, and I realized that when I made the post in
the first place. With any generalization, you will always be able to find
exceptions... but that's why they're generalizations. And, if you read
closesly, you will find that I've made no comments concerning these issues
stating absolution whatsoever... had I done that... THEN the statements I
made would have been incorrect because I knew that the exceptions existed
when I made the post.

Should you refer either to this post, or any post I've written in the past,
you will see that I have always taken great care to provide extreme
clarity. And, as far as THIS particular subject is concerned, you will find
that I have been extremely careful about what I define as 'general'(gray)
and as 'absolute' (black and white).

The psychological references that I made came from three females.... the
first, Dr. Barbara DeAngelis, the second, author Brenda Venus, and the
third, believe it or not, actress Sharon Stone. I would hope that the
generalizations that I've stated DO hold some water, because I respect and
admire these women a great deal.

I offered this information hoping that it would make someone smile. It
looks like I really DO have a lot to learn about human nature because I've
failed miserably. And believe, me, I say that with a smile....

Again...

Thanks for your tact.

Peace.

Sean

So, not to belabor the point, but a funny thing got relayed to me last night....

You see, I work at a very cool, small software company in Berkeley called
Xinet.  To make matters better, I work with a friend, who also raves, named
Rhea.  (You may have seen posts from her.)  Anyway, I guess Rhea came into
work one day and Doug, a cool guy, but not a raver, had on a huge
shit-eatin'-grin.  Doug greeted Rhea enthusiastically, and Rhea, a little
betwixed asked what was up.  Apparently, Doug had done a search on Xinet
using AltaVista.  (URL:  http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query)
What came back were, amongst other things, posts Rhea and I had made to
SFRaves.  He had fun reading them all.  No damage done, but...

Your boss, your future boss, your mom, dad, aunts, uncles, friends, lovers,
strangers, et al, can search for things that you write on the net, and get
them very easily.

I say this only as an example of how insecure the electronic environment
really is.

That's it!

Tony

Well, we're on our way.  But I wanted to say a couple things.  -A- Big
apology to anyone who wanted to come but could not because of space
restrictions.  I did everything I could short of hawking my computer to get a
big enough place for us.  Once again, I'm sorry.  -B.- We'll miss those of
you who can't make it but have tried.  and -C-.  I've already started plans
to get a place called the Ponderosa House (5,000 sq ft. -sleeps 50,12 ft
video screen,pool,etc.) maybe sometime in May.  Keep yer peepers posted. 
Ta Ta for now,
Steveo
P.S. Right phukin on, how many groups of this size, who've never met before,
can cooperate enough to get things like this together, in this amount of
time, with no profit motives, and be totally jazzed about sleeping with with
total strangers under the roof of one crowded house?  Yeeeeaah : )

Yup, I have toys too. I have several Animaniac toys that I 
collected from McDonald's happy meals and a Keroppi doll. I 
even have Keroppi stationary. I had my Power Rangers arranged 
on top of my computer, but I finally took them home and they 
have become bath toys.

Toys rule!

Best of luck in your quest for the Presidency.  BTW, there is no War Room in
the White House; it's at the Pentagon.  I'm certain that all the computer

Hello,

I have been appointed as somewhat of a Northern Califonia Dune Represenative.

I am here to answer all your questions about the upcoming Dune event in
a vast Southern Califonia desert next weekend, Saterday, March 24th.

I was lucky enough to attend the first Dune that occured last fall.  Words
don't do this event justice.  You will not be disappointed.  This event
is fully permitted, and the utmost care is being taken so that this
event will not harm the natural lands we will be using.

The promoters are wonderful people who are well-known and well-respected
"socal-raves@ucsd.edu" peopole.  The event is free if you haul out 1 bag
of trash.  Otherwise, it is five dollars.

Please check out the Dune homepage.  Even if you don't plan on going,
the page is still very interesting.

http://home.earthlink.net/~sarahtonen/

Burning man?  Full Moon Rave?  Moontribe?  I honestly beleive
Dune is better than them all.

If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me.

Dune... the spice flows.... again.

Hi!

I'm going to be in the Boston / conneticut area tomorrow night and I
was wondering if anyone who lives in the NE could recommend something
to do that evening.  (I'll check mail tomorrow afternoon sometime.)

Even a copy of the NE raves calender would be great!

Thanks in advance!

Hey SFRAVers
I'm taking the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) tomorrow in 
Berkeley at 8am.  So if you are in the post-party insomnia thing, please 
try to work up some positive vibes for me :)
Around noon you'll probably find me in Primal getting some new rekkids... ;)
I'll be the one that looks like he hasn't gotten enough sleep

E.

MDMA is an empathogin.  "Empathogins seem to encourage physical contact, 
yet make that contact less specifically sexual. The need to achieve 
orgasm is decresed, but the pleasurable feelings associated with body 
contact are increased....Another common theme found in accounts of MDMA 
and sexuality stress that it demands authenticity in love-making unlike 
cocaine, alcohol,and Quaaludes which have a reputation as seduction 
drugs..."

Reprinted here without permission from the authors,J. Buffman,Pharm.D., 
and C. Moser, Ph.D.,in their paper "MDMA and Human Sexual Function,"
pub. 1985 Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, and in _Ectasy: The MDMA Story_ 
by Bruce Eisner.

Hope this little bit helps explain your situation.

        I had an experience similar to this at new years at the cybertrance
party, i was just sitting there in the sand with this person i'd met and
she was saying 'whoa' and looking off to my right and this woman had just
jumped out of the hot tub and was smiling and dancing and i actually almost
blushed :o
        Then i though, wait, what's there to blush about? She's happy,
noone is ogling her like in a circus, she's just at the state that we were
all in before (metaphorically) eve took that bite from the apple. (ps, i
think that myth is bs and is used too often in a sexist way but it's just a
metaphor here). Just like when we were all born, completely nekkid and
happy! Nothing wrong with that :) It was at that point that i remembered
what is so cool about this scene; people can be human and the social
conventions that create abberant sexual behaviours can (hopefully) be left
at the door.
        peace,
                brad

OBrandomtechno: does anyone know of a cure for goa? i seem to be addicted.
:) Methadone perhaps? A cold shower?

Hi!
  This is Ran from Dionysus Dreams. I've made a few postings and thought 
that maybe I could introduce myself.

  I first attended a rave called Mr. Floopy's Fractal Funhouse as part of 
the sound crew (we had a eight channel sound system on the main floor). I 
really did not "get it" that night, although the 'enhancements' handed 
out by Ollie Wisdom and crew made the event a tripsters delight ;) .
  My next one was Craig Larson's Lighthouse Two, Halloween night at 
Jose's Cantina in Santa Cruz, where I did the sound design for that event 
(I was NOT responsible for the band that played however). I got it that 
night; the warm internal glow coincided with watching a beautiful dancer 
moving in just the best way possible-- I had to dance and before I knew 
it I had entered an ecstatic dance trance modality of conciousness =) =) !
  Well I was hooked!! My next step was to go to some more shows (Shamen 
at the Warfield being a key event!!). Eventually I realised that I had 
the desire to be an ambient designer/performer. I started at the 2nd Mr. 
Rogers Neighborhood (at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium) and just Knew 
that this was perfect for me. Not only do I play ambience, I also mixed 
in a lot of live material (processed voice, percussion, unusual 
instruments) and usually set up slide projectors, lighting effects and 
sculptures. Essientially my focus is as a multi-media, interactive artist 
with the desired goal of assisting group transcendence. I think I've even 
come close :).

  My educational prusuits are aligned with the purposes that I bring to 
the ambient room. Hence the notice on the essay I promised a few days 
back. I should have that posted really soon-- I'll let ya all know when.


Ran
                                  (Peace)
                                     /
                                 =*=/
                                  ~

PS-- by the way, I've been told that Ran is the Japanese word for chaos
PPS-- Dionysus is the god of (among other things) ecstasy and agony

        Just took another look at this and thought i'd mention that
'abberant' to me is not based on any 'objective' model of what is sexually
normal or not. I suppose i shoulda said "IMHO". I think being socially
deviant in some areas is more 'normal' than anything, but i was referring
more to the social method of reification of women (as in billboards and
advertisements that use women as 'things' and not as 'people') and the
subsequent ways that we all view and treat each other. I was meaning that
those kind of mindsets would be left at the door, but it's tough to explain
all that with these &&%&*# little words we use :(
        Hope i've clarified something somewhere! Does anyone really care?
Did i take too many poststructuralist linguistics courses? i think so!
        peace,
                brad

Well, I didn't have a lot of fun at this one. I showed up kind of late
(1 am) and there was still a line. It took me about 20 mintues to get
in. At the door three beefy security guards were patting down everyone.

When I got in, I noticed the good lights and some other psychedelic
decorations. But not too many people were smiling, and quite a few
were obviously drunk. They were serving alchohol and this seemed
to have an effect on the vibe.

I got down to the dance floor and starting having some fun. The group
around the turntables seemed more ravalicious. One woman gave me a
smiley faced sticker, which I put on my cheek. Most of the people
around me seemed faintly amused by this, especially the big tough
guys. After about an hour, one of the guys who had been dancing near
me decided to grab his stuff, that he had placed in the corner near
mine. It turned out to be covered in this brown goo, some combination
of beer and who knows what else. As he brushed past me and some other
people nearby, we all got smeared with the vile smelling stuff. Ugh.
I picked up my jacket and it had some of the same gunk on it. I went
to the bathroom to clean up. 

Afterwards I sat down and watched for awhile and realized that no one
around me was smiling or friendly. It was 3AM and I was getting tired,
so I decided to go.


On the plus side, the music was great. The lighting was fun, but a
little too bright for my taste. And the venue was not overcrowded
or too hot. But the vibe was missing, at least for me. None of
my friends were therere, and this probably had something to do
with it. Eric, I looked for you but didn't seee you. Did you 
make it? Waht did you think?

Peace and Love,
Jim

Thanks to all those of you who sent me supportive notes and thoughts in 
my day of stress :)  I'm sure your vibes really helped me.  I was only 
able to visit primal for a few minutes, but I was there long enough to 
pick up a fistful of flyers and two records, so I am happy.  :)
Thanks again and happy vibes to all!  Good luck on finals to those who 
are having them!

Ok, sit back and get ready to be jealous as I relate to you the events of 
the weekend...

Friday.  This day started good, got *really* bad, and by the time I was due 
to leave to begin my evening festivities, I was in a seriously ^&*( mood.  
First stop: Nikita with Doc Martin.

DAMN!  What else can I say?  1015 had that funky camouflage netting across 
the ceiling and a blue/green laser that made the lighting even better than 
usual.  Too damn much smoke IMHO, but that was the only down side.  Finally 
met Doc Martin -- a *very* cool guy.  Doc started spinning around 12:30 and 
the boy was all the way ON.  Saw many friends from other raves -- wassup 
Keith, Patricia, Erin (and many others).  Danced my ass off, (pretty much) 
forgot all about the negativity from earlier in the day.  I just can't tell 
you how bad I needed that...  

Left about 3am for....TAHOE!

Saturday morning.  Rolled in around 7:30am.  SteveO and the gang are all out 
cold.  Must have been good :)  We threw down on the floor and started to try 
to get a few winks, but just then everyone started getting up... oh well.  
Walked around and met so many FANTASTIC people!  Unfortunately, my energy 
was spent so I and my crew took one of the then-vacant rooms and crashed for 
a couple of hours.

Saturday afternoon.  Everyone had left to go snowboarding.  I've never 
snowboarded or skied, but I decided to try my luck with a sled.  YEEHAW!  
Got completely out of control once and scared the living daylights outta 
myself, but whatta gas!  Took some great pictures.  About the time I was 
winded and done with sledding, Matt Lanier and Becca showed up.  We kicked 
back on a huge boulder, snow all around us, ski slopes behind us, and a 
spectacular view of Lake Tahoe below us, and talked and laughed like we were 
old friends.  It was great.

Saturday night.  The sun sank slowly across the water from us, providing 
some breath-taking photo opportunities.  Then the festivities began.  We had 
a communal dinner in the middle of the living room floor with ambient 
playing in the background.  Lot's a veggies, huomos, guacamoli (sp?), and 
some serious pasta provided by Matt and SteveO.  WOW!  After dinner, the 
toys came out.  It was so great to play like a bunch of little kids.  

Then the live performance began, courtesy of Eric and Rick Riffle.  Folks, 
the best musical advice I can give you is, Get The Tape!  Oh man, everyone 
was just enthralled.  I could have listened to and watched these guys all 
night.  Absolutely beautiful ambient sounds.

Then Moonpup came on with such a weird and fantastic mix of different tunes. 
 I really think the theme from "2001: A Space Odyssey" was the perfect way 
to start off his set!  ;)  That boy had me jumping all over the place!  And 
what a GREAT guy to party with!  Down to earth and intelligent, but what a 
big kid!  People, I can't tell you how sorry I am that he's going to the 
UK...  <sniffle>...

Somehow along the way I became...DA DA DAAAAA!  Camera Man!  I was snapping 
shots left and right -- a set of which will go to SteveO and will hopefully 
be posted to Hyperreal (?) -- and folks started handing me their cameras and 
asking me to take pictures!  I wore my poor shutter finger out, but there 
are going to be some great shots going around!

Later I became...DA DA DAAAAAA!  Lotion Man!  Yes, disguised as 
mild-mannered SDream, when the call for lubrication goes out, I 
become...Lotion Man!  We had a chill room thang going on downstairs with 
lots of hand/back/foot rubs.  Becca was the queen for the night, getting 
both feet, both hands, and her back rubbed all at once!  Daaaaaaang.....

Then there was the hot tub.  Soooo relaxing, but that's not the part that 
will stick in my mind forever.  At some point, Matt started humming, just a 
single monotone note.  Soon the rest of us picked it up (Becca: "What's that 
noise?").  But then Trish began to sing to it, there in the darkness lit 
only by candles, the stars over the lake behind her through the glass door.  
High, lilting, notes without words, crystal clear and beautiful.  We were 
all amazed at what happened during those few moments.  And when the wonder 
was too much, we clapped and marveled at her voice.  Wow.

Then it was back upstairs for more dancing!  Then back for more backrubs!  
More people DJ'ed, each one twisting the darkness of the night into the 
light of love!  Dancing!  Hugs! Rubs!  Dancing! Hugs! Rubs!  

Geez, it just doesn't get any better than this...

Beyond that, the evening was a blur.  Saw Alex, KC, Will, Mark, dang, so 
many people I can't recall all the names...

And people, it was beautiful.

Sunday morning.  Ouch.  Could someone ask that the sun be turned down just a 
tad?  Geez.  Time to clean up.  That went fairly smoothly, although somehow 
there were a couple spots of body paint in the carpet... oops...  Most of  
it was all over the Twister game pad.  And as we moved the furniture back, 
we kept finding the Day-Glo super balls we'd been throwing at each other the 
night before.  We kept joking about, wouldn't it be nice if we got snowed 
in?  Oh darn!  That would just be awful, wouldn't it?  Stuck here partying 
for a couple more nights?  <big phat grins!>  Once we were done getting 
everything out of the hosue, we got a dozen shots of the whole group and 
then loudly and roundly applauded SteveO for an absolutely unforgettable 
weekend!  That man gets my Raver of the Month award!  It just couldn't have 
been any better.  That was, bar none, the best event I've ever been to.

Then it was off to the Wildflower Cafe for breakfast.  No one wanted to part 
company just yet.  We sat, ate, joked a little, smiled a lot, and zoned out 
quite a bit.  Zero energy, just happy warm glows.  If you're ever there, 
they make very good Swedish pancakes with strawberries.  Num, num...

And then it was time to go.  This sucked.  Nuff said.

4 hours later and we're back home.  This also sucketh mightily, although the 
hamstas were happy to see me.  They'd been raving while I was gone, but one 
of their turntables broke and they had to make do with one t-table and a 
tiny little CD player.  What's more, DJ Log Cat didn't play -- he's on tour 
in Singapore.  I fixed the damage, and they're already planning an ambient 
session for tonight.  Now to finish the laundry...

But wait!  There's MORE!  Or there will be, this coming Sunday at Sunset... 
hehe...

Can anyone recommend a place that repairs or estimates for 1200's (Technics)? 
Preferably in Berkeley or the East Bay.  I know of JK Sound in the city.

Thursday - last midterm.  Party week-end!!

Thursday: 1015, for Tribute to a Friend.  Did anyone else go to this??
Incredible line-up: about 10 awesome dj's, and Astral Matrix, Freaky Chakra
and DubTribe live.  Wow.

BUT this amazing event was indeed held in a CLUB.  I arrived bedecked in
sparkles and bearing special gifts for the ravers I was sure to find.  I
searched and searched for a day-glo outfit, ponytails, glitter, anything,
but instead found only shirts-and-ties and dresses-and-heels.  Oh no, the
bridge-and-tunnel crowd!!  Not a whistle, not a handclap to be had.
ATMOSPHERE is what makes the party.  I danced in the main room with my
friends to Jeno's set, getting a little happier.  The sound and lights
there kick ass - better than any warehouse.  The injustice...

Later on the drunken suburbanites found their way home.  I entered the
second room to find DubTribe playing live, and this went off!  I danced in
front of the percussionists in total joy as Sunshine rapped his theme...you
know, "There's so much love in this world!!"  It seemed half the people
there knew the anthem, and we chanted along, arms in the air, cheering.
This was the highlight of the evening for me!

Then a bizarre thing happened.  I got really sick (which never happens) and
left the oppressiveness of the club to go lie in the gutter.  There I met
many people who stopped to take care of me.  In a haze I heard one of them
ask me where my friends were, telling me the club had closed 20 minutes
before!!  A new friend who had sat with me all night led me to the EndUp,
home of the tweakers, where we stayed until we bummed a ride to Berkeley.
In retrospect I see it was really dangerous to lie on a street in the
middle of the night in San Francisco, completely incapacitated, but so many
people took care of me!  Getting me water, looking for my friends, sitting
with me...  There are good people out there.

Friday: Big party at my big student-housing co-op.  A DJ from "In da
Mix!"/KMEL spinning very mainstream house.  Helicopter lights, fog machine,
dancing on top of tables.  Fun, but not deep.

Saturday: private warehouse/loft party.  60 people, dj's (Mars closing out
the night), orange slices.  This one was cool because I actually got to
*talk* to people as we kicked back in bedrooms.  A house party rave!  Nice,
except for some reason everyone was floored and couldn't get up for the rad
deep trance.  I pathetically bobbed my head, wishing for energy.

Sunday: e-mail raving.
Monday: see you all at Mad! :)

I heard Basics went off.  It's been sooooo long (a month!) since I
experienced the full-on, all-night, total rave.  Any suggestions for this
week-end??  Any thoughts about Aborigine?  When is Chrysalis??!  And I want
to meet all of you!

BTW, I apologize for the length of my posts.  I hope no-one is pissed.  I
just can't stop myself!

Love to everyone!! Nancy

I think it may be that you are closing in on what some people call 
inner peace.  At the level of complete peace all desires are removed.  
Lust in all its forms vanishes.   I think you may be becoming more 
balanced with yourself and removing certain feelings that only get in 
the way of your true happiness.  It sort of an Eastern way of thinking.

love chris

WOW !!! 
 
I'm just waking up (6am monday), and I can't get rid of some of the tunes
dancing around in my head.......and I can't forget the incredible time had
by all at this wonderful and positive event. 
 
I arrived on Fri nite about 10pm or so, and we (melissa & chrishna) were
some of the first to arrive, so we picked out a bedroom and made camp....I
set the sound system up and was pleased that every one had brought there
stuff (speakers, amps , etc.....)           slowly until late in the early
morning others arrived and we all began to jaccuzzi together.....Fri nite
was a mellow affair with everyone wanting to save there energy levels for
the next LONG day ahead........ 
 
A lot of people were going snow boarding in the am so most of us went to
bed. 
Rick riffle and I played music with each other and talked music and shared
some quality time together, we turned each other on to music that the other
had, and enjoyed trainspotting all night long. (it's a beautiful thing to
share musical Knowledge with another DJ, it needs to happen MORE
OFTEN.....I'm sick of DJ's who hide there labels or protect there music,
like it belongs to them only, as far as I'm concerned the music belongs to
all of us. I buy music to share with others and if a DJ wants to know what
track I'm playing, I am honored that he likes my choice and am glad to
relay that info to them). 
 
While my first reaction was that there may have been an inordinate amount
of guys verses gals, it became apparent to me (through-out the weekend)
that ALL the men had massive amounts of female energy, and all the women
had an equal amount of masculine energy, and the result was a party full of
PEOPLE who were in touch with their masculine and femanine sides. It was
truly inspiring. 
 
As we all woke up Sat morning, the Snow people went boarding and the
remainder of us went for a very long walk.......we had a brilliant time
talking and getting to know each other..........we eventualy found a
dicusting little restaurant and had some discusting food, (we were too
tired to find another spot). we eventualy headed back UP the hill and with
the exception of Becca (tribal power woman) we pooped out half way up the
hill..........Becca showed up with a car to take us all home again.........

 
Some of us went shopping for food while some of us cleaned out the murky
depths of the jaccuzzi........we refilled it and re heated
it..............we mostly crashed out and woke around 6pm.........All the
snowboarders were back and we began to make the communal dinner.........an
excellent job by all.......pasta a plenty.........fried goobies, and hot
fresh garlic bread.......plus more........ 
 
we then cleaned up and began to play coosh ball wars, we were like a bunch
of kids....... 
lots of fun........meanwhile we were treated to an excellent ambient (LIVE)
set by Rick and Eric.  There was a gathering of people getting into the
Jaccuzzi and we relaxed for a while. 
 
We went back upstairs and I began to play my first set (if you don't count
Fri nite) 
I  began with the  2001 space oddessy theme, and had an incredible
response, and the rest of my set was rocking (if I don't mind saying so
myself). It's parties like this that bring out the best in me and I feel so
relaxed, that even my mistakes sound good....... 
 
I was followed by a wonderful suprise in DJ Jason D (from Santa Cruz) he
was incredible.......his music was inspiring and very mature.......great
great set...........beautifully mixed and fresh........ 
 
At this time there was a E-athon going on in one of the bedrooms and I
joined in, it was a wonderful touchy feely session with lots of sensualness
(and no sexuality I might add).......we all decided the jaccuzzi was in
order....so off we went to flood the jaccuzzi floor.........we all ran
outside and flirted with the idea of making naked snow angels, but we were
all too chicken, (not to mention too cold)...... 
 
Some of the snow boarders went to bed while others stayed up as Jason D and
I began to mix back and forth........I eventually played again getting into
deep acid tones..... 
 
unfortunately one of us got sick and spent the next couple of hours in the
bathroom, but she had many visits from friends, and was taken care of with
love and respect..... 
 
Mark played some excellent ambient and  beats,  and so did Steve.......I
played again  
tripping out the crowd with my trip hop acid phsycodelic shit.......groovy
man......... 
It felt good to sub-concsiouly get inside the heads of those crashed out on
the floor.... 
 
I eventualy quit at about 6am or so.........no one left to party with boo
hoo hoo...(*bunch of lightweights).........so I began to take my only
pictures...........of every one crashed out.........it was fun to sneak
around getting scrunched up sleepy heads on film........ 
 
...........we all woke up around 8:30 am and helped to clean up the mess we
had made 
 
and by 10 am we were all on our way either snow boarding or coming
home........ 
 
I would like to add that there were 100% responsible people there and we
left the house in great condition.......smokers smoked outside, and we
never had a complaint from anyone......... 
 
This was truly one of the greatest events I have ever been involved with,
and cudos goes out to SteveO for a magnificent job of organizing. 
 
a good time was had by all......and I especially enjoyed all the new
friends I made (and in particular one special new friend).......... 
 
.........It's events like this that make me sad that I'm going away in May
to the U.K. 
I will miss you all, but if all goes well I'll be back for Burning Man in
Sept, with all my new records I get in europe.....can't wait.........I love
you all and thank you.....

WOW !!! 
 
I'm just waking up (6am monday), and I can't get rid of some of the tunes
dancing around in my head.......and I can't forget the incredible time had
by all at this wonderful and positive event. 
 
I arrived on Fri nite about 10pm or so, and we (melissa & chrishna) were
some of the first to arrive, so we picked out a bedroom and made camp....I
set the sound system up and was pleased that every one had brought there
stuff (speakers, amps , etc.....)           slowly until late in the early
morning others arrived and we all began to jaccuzzi together.....Fri nite
was a mellow affair with everyone wanting to save there energy levels for
the next LONG day ahead........ 
 
A lot of people were going snow boarding in the am so most of us went to
bed. 
Rick riffle and I played music with each other and talked music and shared
some quality time together, we turned each other on to music that the other
had, and enjoyed trainspotting all night long. (it's a beautiful thing to
share musical Knowledge with another DJ, it needs to happen MORE
OFTEN.....I'm sick of DJ's who hide there labels or protect there music,
like it belongs to them only, as far as I'm concerned the music belongs to
all of us. I buy music to share with others and if a DJ wants to know what
track I'm playing, I am honored that he likes my choice and am glad to
relay that info to them). 
 
While my first reaction was that there may have been an inordinate amount
of guys verses gals, it became apparent to me (through-out the weekend)
that ALL the men had massive amounts of female energy, and all the women
had an equal amount of masculine energy, and the result was a party full of
PEOPLE who were in touch with their masculine and femanine sides. It was
truly inspiring. 
 
As we all woke up Sat morning, the Snow people went boarding and the
remainder of us went for a very long walk.......we had a brilliant time
talking and getting to know each other..........we eventualy found a
dicusting little restaurant and had some discusting food, (we were too
tired to find another spot). we eventualy headed back UP the hill and with
the exception of Becca (tribal power woman) we pooped out half way up the
hill..........Becca showed up with a car to take us all home again.........

 
Some of us went shopping for food while some of us cleaned out the murky
depths of the jaccuzzi........we refilled it and re heated
it..............we mostly crashed out and woke around 6pm.........All the
snowboarders were back and we began to make the communal dinner.........an
excellent job by all.......pasta a plenty.........fried goobies, and hot
fresh garlic bread.......plus more........ 
 
we then cleaned up and began to play coosh ball wars, we were like a bunch
of kids....... 
lots of fun........meanwhile we were treated to an excellent ambient (LIVE)
set by Rick and Eric.  There was a gathering of people getting into the
Jaccuzzi and we relaxed for a while. 
 
We went back upstairs and I began to play my first set (if you don't count
Fri nite) 
I  began with the  2001 space oddessy theme, and had an incredible
response, and the rest of my set was rocking (if I don't mind saying so
myself). It's parties like this that bring out the best in me and I feel so
relaxed, that even my mistakes sound good....... 
 
I was followed by a wonderful suprise in DJ Jason D (from Santa Cruz) he
was incredible.......his music was inspiring and very mature.......great
great set...........beautifully mixed and fresh........ 
 
At this time there was a E-athon going on in one of the bedrooms and I
joined in, it was a wonderful touchy feely session with lots of sensualness
(and no sexuality I might add).......we all decided the jaccuzzi was in
order....so off we went to flood the jaccuzzi floor.........we all ran
outside and flirted with the idea of making naked snow angels, but we were
all too chicken, (not to mention too cold)...... 
 
Some of the snow boarders went to bed while others stayed up as Jason D and
I began to mix back and forth........I eventually played again getting into
deep acid tones..... 
 
unfortunately one of us got sick and spent the next couple of hours in the
bathroom, but she had many visits from friends, and was taken care of with
love and respect..... 
 
Mark played some excellent ambient and  beats,  and so did Steve.......I
played again  
tripping out the crowd with my trip hop acid phsycodelic shit.......groovy
man......... 
It felt good to sub-concsiouly get inside the heads of those crashed out on
the floor.... 
 
I eventualy quit at about 6am or so.........no one left to party with boo
hoo hoo...(*bunch of lightweights).........so I began to take my only
pictures...........of every one crashed out.........it was fun to sneak
around getting scrunched up sleepy heads on film........ 
 
...........we all woke up around 8:30 am and helped to clean up the mess we
had made 
 
and by 10 am we were all on our way either snow boarding or coming
home........ 
 
I would like to add that there were 100% responsible people there and we
left the house in great condition.......smokers smoked outside, and we
never had a complaint from anyone......... 
 
This was truly one of the greatest events I have ever been involved with,
and cudos goes out to SteveO for a magnificent job of organizing. 
 
a good time was had by all......and I especially enjoyed all the new
friends I made (and in particular one special new friend).......... 
 
.........It's events like this that make me sad that I'm going away in May
to the U.K. 
I will miss you all, but if all goes well I'll be back for Burning Man in
Sept, with all my new records I get in europe.....can't wait.........I love
you all and thank you..... 
 
                                    moonpup    415-337-MOON (6666) 
 
P.S. -Rick pointed out that not once did he go to the bathroom and find pee
on the seat 
well done boys. lots and lots and lots of respect..........

This is actually a message i posted to nw-raves, but even though it has 
not much to do with the sf community i had such a blast i wanted to share 
it with you guys ........ :)

========================= 
Well!  i'm sure some of you will be amazed to hear that i did NOT attend 
the Dose party as planned.  Things transpired against us in getting 
there, and you know what? 

 I HAD MORE FUN NOT GOING THAN I WOULD HAVE HAD IF I'D BEEN THERE!!!!!

Myself and two friends went to a fundraiser which was being put on by 
Wondertree, an alternative elementary school in Vancouver.  We had  no 
real idea of what to expect ....

Picture if you will:  you're getting far up there on some nice e (if you 
do e) and walk into a warehouse filled with insane Alice in Wonderland 
drawings with small children in fairy costumes running around playing 
with bubbles and sparkles while amazingly good trip hop rumbles through 
the UV-lit atmosphere.  As the evening progressed the music got better 
and better, we got higher and higher, and the crowd got stranger and 
stranger.  There was a seventeen-year-old boy who was on NOTHING, walking 
around wearing nothing but a fur loincloth, his glasses, and some 
fluorescent poster paint.....

Tippy A Go Go played live and they were UNBELIEVEABLE.  get their cds if 
you can, they are to be treasured!

After they left, DJ Shine (aka Jesse) came on and was laying down some 
SWEEEET house.  By this time there were abut one hundred fifty people, 
from 15 to 57 years of age, most of whom were candyflipping.  Keep in 
mind that this was a FUNDRAISER FOR A SCHOOL!!!!!

we and around three hundred insanely happy vibing people went strong until 
5 am and it's now 5:30 pm and i have not been to bed yet.  i simply had to
share my unbelievable story of the evening that nearly just didn't happen!!!

very tired
k


p.s. i should stress that the people who organized the fundraiser 
(Wondertree) had NO IDEA what was going to happen and were definitely NOT
responsible for any substances that showed up.  By the time they realized 
what was going on, things were sailing merrily along, and rather than 
send a bunch of squirrely people out into the streets of Vancouver at 
4am, they decided to let things happen and only escort out the more 
obvious troublemakers.....

        First of all, let me say that James Ausman completely hit the mark.
I got to Evolution around 10:30pm, and saw a guy and gal with whom I had
breakfast at Denny's after Vision, so I thought, "Cool, I know some people
here already."  Good sign?  Not really.  First thing in the door, a
security guy took my water from me :(  I got in and immediately noticed the
bar (boooo!).  Someone asked if I knew anyone looking for E.  I checked the
place out.  Too small and too bright for my taste.  In the bathroom,
someone asked if I was looking for E.  Someone in the crowd asked if I knew
where he could find any A (!).  As if I'd know.
        There were a few dancers out on the floor, and as the crowd grew,
the floor filled up.  Mostly seemed like more hardcore and/or
old-schoolers.  There was a bit of a gangsta vibe.  I wasn't inspired to
dance.  The dj (either DLX or Karizma) spun mostly heavy bass beats, fast,
with little else added.  Not exciting to me.  I met up with Jonathan, and
we hung together for a while.  We waited for the vibe but it didn't happen.
A few in the crowd made eye contact, and one gal even smiled, but there
was just too much of a clubby atmosphere, too many good-time drunkards.  We
decided that things weren't going to improve, and didn't bother indulging
in anything Exciting, so we bailed around 1am or 1:30am (not sure which,
Jonathan?).
        It was the first time since Tribal Funk at Santa Cruz that I
attended a party I didn't enjoy.  Lesson learned.  I wish I could have
heard the rest of the djs, since the lineup was impressive, but I couldn't
endure the scene (or lack thereof).  I would have gone to Basics the next
night, but I didn't call the vm till 10:20pm, and knew that tix would be
gone by the time I found the map point.
        Now I'm hoping the time will fly until the next party I go to, so I
can find that happy, silly, childlike, tripped-out vibe I crave...

I'm feeling much better now!

Best party I've ever been to.  Very sorry to all those who could not make
it.  Very happy for all those who did.  The small crowd vibe really made it
family oriented.  Everyone was really nice and very respectful.  Marcus, the
39 year old snowboarder/raver....you inspire me.  We snowboarded with this
guy all day Saturday on practically no sleep....partied hard all night with
even less sleep...and the man goes snowboarding again on Sunday.  By Sunday,
my 25 year old body had no more energy left to give.  I was inpressed.  

Had a great time meeting Moonpup.  We spun ambient and slow beat stuff till
about 4:00am on Friday and that was really fun.  I got some of my first real
experience trying to beat match with a cd mixer.  Fun stuff.  Not too
terribly difficult, just different from records.  He's a great guy, sorry to
know he's leaving so soon.

Moonpup....please enlighten me as to what "trainspotting" means.

Snowboarded all day Saturday with a tribe of people.  This was the first
tribe riding I've done in years, and there were more of us this time than
I've ever rode with.  Thanks to all.  One of the best days of the year so
far....as far as snowboarding goes.

Came back that evening and began to prepare my portion of dinner for the
family.  I made vegetable pakora (east indian stuff).  And to my delight, it
all got eaten.  I was suprised cuz I made tones of the stuff.....or they
hated it and through it out the window....I guess I can never be sure.  All
of the food was wonderful...and all that extra spagetti was sooooo great
Sunday morning.  

I didn't really get to participate in the communal dinner eating portion cuz
my friend Eric and I were setting up the equipment for our live set.  Just
about the time were were ready to go, everyone had finished eating and
cleaned thier plate ......such responsible ravers.  We played a totally
unrehersed set for about 1.5 hrs and had a blast.  It was really fun and we
got a good response from the family.  

Moonpup went on after me and I headed for the spa to soak.  Somewhere
between the spa and the end of moonpups set I lost my mind...and probably
won't find all the piecies for years to come......or was it that I found my
mind....it's all relative....

Jason D played and an incredible set although I wasn't much up for dancing
at that point.  

Then Moonpup played again and eventually asked me if I wanted to play again,
but I declined because there were others that wanted to play....nor was I
really in the right state of mind to perform well.....ya know....so tired
from no sleep,  snowboarding, and the live performance ;)  

Marcus came on I think, then Steve from Bolinas.

Steve is super cool and we really bonded.  Thanks Steve.

I eventually passed out to the ambient tunes of moonpup again, who guided my
dreams.  Slept for an hour or so then got up in a total daze and began
cleaning and restoring order to the dismantled three story cabin.  The
cleaning ritual really brought me back to reality, and by 10:00 or so
everything was done.  

We found a full pint of coffee icecream in the freezer about 9:55 and dove
for the spoons to eat as much as possible.  I ended up with the leftovers
cuz I brought an ice chest.  I ate about half of it when i got home.

Stopped off at Donner lake to chill out by the water with my good friend
Eric.  I touched the water that at some time may have been snow I slipped
across on my board.  What a concept.

Thank you SteveO for generating the idea and taking the initiative to make
this experience happen for us.  It will not be soon forgoten.  

Thank you Moonpup for bringing your turntables, cd mixer and dj mixer.

Thank you Mark Camp for bringing the monitors and monitor amp. (also for the
tape you gave me of your live stuff)

Thank you Eric Degregario (my buddy from Sac, and musical companion) for
deciding at the last minute to attend the event and donating your speakers
and amp.  Without your attendance, the sound just wouldn't have been the same.  

Thanks Steve from Boninas for bringing your speakers although we had no
speaker wire to hook them up.

Thank you Multiverse for fixing it so all of the cabins surrounding ours
were empty all weekend and for never getting a noise complaint.

Thank you all that attended for all of your love and friendship.

This event will live on for quite some time.

Love,

Rick

Uuuummm...does everyone have to wear ponytails and glitter to fit in with 
this crowd?  If so, guess I just better stay home!  What about jeans, Doc 
Martins and a groovy shirt, is that not hip enough?

Glad you had a good time anyway...after all the regular weirdos went 
home.  I can say I'm a tad offended (but I surely wouldn't wear heels 
to one of these).

Wear a skirt, Marty.  That would be ultra-hip!  Hahaha, just kidding :)
If we must wear clothes, we should all wear whatever is comfortable and
that we like,
not something we think will dazzle others.

Wearing jeans and boots (!),

hello all-

i, matthew david peter kyle lanier, do pronounce myself to be a different
person that i was when i drove up to tahoe on friday.  here's how:

1)never, in my right mind, would i get naked with someone other than a
significant other.  i found, this weekend, much to my delight, that that is
not true any more.  i love hot-tubs and the feeling of having nothing
between me and other people, as clothes tend to do.

2)never, in my right mind, would i have spent a weekend with people i didn't
know well yet.  that's not true anymore.  nuff said.

3)never would i do so many things that i know i can now do...thanks to the
love i felt up at tahoe this weekend.

thanks all!  love to all!  i love you all!!!

Hmmm...Maybe you did do it wrong.  I mean, come on, searching under Brad
might be a LITTLE vague.  Sorry to invade your privacy, but I did a pretty
simple search under:  ecto@citenet and while I'm working and don't have
time to read all the posts or dig too deep, here's a post you made to
NE-Raves about the Celestine Prophecy.  Do you remember it?

Hey there y'all!

Just thought i'd mention that i've come across the Celestine
Prophecy (it's a book, some may even call it new age *yikes!* definitely
worth reading though) Home Page. (Now isnt' that amazing grammatical
structure for a University Grad? haha)
It's at :
http://koa.ifa.hawaii.edu/user/shaw/celes/celestine.html

i know that there are a few people on this list that are down with
J.R. ;) and for those who haven't read the book, take a look at these
pages, the concepts, IMHO, are very rave related. I think the HoloDynamic
Unity thing that is part of this site is especially cool.
later ravers,
brad

Hello everyone! Just finished my final for the day and came to give my 
review of Basics. I have to heartily agree with Jondabomb and the other 
Austin, all the Basics were covered. At first with only 800 tickets I 
thought it might endup in a little crowded sweatbox, but this was definately not the case. 
Very good ventalation overall, easy to find location, and just a nice 
space. They should use this one more often if they can. 
I went with Crunchman and we got there at about 11. Very short line and 
we got right in. There was still plenty of open space then but it soon 
filled up more (never too crowded). People were moving all night with a 
nice vibe pouring out. Music covered the whole spectrum and 
it was all top notch. I danced til 5 then had to take frequent rests but 
it was wonderful even from a sitting position. It ended a little after 7 
with several funky records and fresh fruit, then I had to head home. I 
met Tom, Cami (sp), and Knucklehead, glad to have met you. 

Last week when I got the Basics tickets I also picked up a couple CD's at 
F-8.  Platypus Records vol. 2 and Distance to Goa 3.  If you like 
goa/psychedelic trance at all you will want to look for these. Platypus 
is a non mixed comp. and starts with Robert Miles 'Children' which is 
completely beautiful music, then plows right into the trance that will 
eat away large chunks of your brain. The tracks by Union Jack and 
Salamander alone make this worth buying. Completely wonderful, with weird 
sound effects and many lovely levels of sound. Distance to Goa is a Dou 
ble CD (one nonmixed the other mixed by DJ Xavier from Amsterdam). Both 
are full on psychodelic trips with mental music from start to finish. Man 
with No Name, Infinity Project, Technossomy, and Hallucinogen all are 
represented with excellent music.

  Austin                             
  Tinsau                    

            S.F. Born and Raved!

Y'know, just a little observation:  It seems to me that, on holidays with 
some amount of drinking attached to them, ravers have the worst time finding 
a party with a good vibe.  Even events that have been good in the past will 
suddenly have a certain percentage of folks that have a non-rave agenda and 
an unfriendly vibe.  I went to Nikita Friday night, and even though I found 
a lot of friendly faces, most likely drawn by Doc Martin's attendance, there 
was definitely a large suit contingent.  Fortunately the clubby set didn't 
affect the good time I was having... much...

Anyway, my point is, holidays like St. Paddy's or New Years or July 4th or 
[fill in any holiday associated with drinking too much] seem to draw out a 
crowd that is less into feeling good and being friendly, and more into the 
meat market thang, drinking until they puke, brawling, and feeling hungover 
the next day.  The vibe is zero to negative.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION:  I guess my move will be to look for small gatherings 
with a known raver element on national holidays.  And stay overnight -- and 
off the drunk-infested freeways.  The Tahoe trip that went off this weekend 
is a PERFECT example of this.  Just a safer way to go, y'know?

Peas,

S

You know, I didn't realize until my friend picked up the Body & Soul single
that HIA did some remixes on it.  I was pretty excited because Higher
Intelligence Agency has got to be the best ambient band on the planet.  By
the way, has anyone heard their new album yet?  If so, what's it like
compared to Colourform?

Oh, and I will definitely be at L&R at the Troc, probably with my laminate
on.  I'm about 5'9", beard, long brown hair that's shaved on the back &
sides.  Anyone else going to that show?

Dear F&F,

	I haven't had a chance to post or even read mail in a few days, 
but I just wanted to reassure you all that it's not because I'm in jail.  8)
	Actually I had a very full, intense, and interesting weekend 
taking a 45-hour intensive workshop called the Landmark Forum.
It's kind of like an EST course, I'm told, although I've never been 
exposed to EST and don't know anything about it.  There was no talk of G
od or religion or anything like that, but some of it gets pretty heavy as 
far as forcing you to reexamine your life and way of thinking, so if you 
aren't prepared to do this, I wouldn't recommend it.
	Anyway, my final evening is on Tuesday (tomorrow) from 7pm to 
1045pm.  We are allowed to bring family, friends, guests, anyone who would 
like to learn more about the program.
	Although I didn't agree with all aspects of the Forum, it did give me a 
whole lot of new insights into life, relationships, etc., and I think it 
was worth the rather pricey (for me) $290.  Some of the other people I 
took it with (there were about 90 enrollees all together) had a much more 
profound change take place for them, on the level of what some of us have 
gotten out of raves.
	I could talk a lot more about it, but I don't want to waste space 
here.  The Tuesday evening session is free -- if any of you are curious, 
I invite you to give me a call and I'll bring you as a guest. 
	The location is the corner of 5th & Howard, South of Market in S.F.

Peace, Luv & Grooviness,
				<<< Starchild >>>

Phone: (415) 270-7887 [page/voicemail] or (415) 626-3036 [home].

P.S. - I'm not getting any kind of incentive for signing people up for 
this or anything, it's just found it an interesting experience that 
others might like to sample.

        OK, here it is.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is
Eric Paul Peterson.  I was born 11/8/95, in the L.A. area.  I've lived in
the South Bay since I was four, grew up and went to schools in Santa Clara,
graduated from Santa Clara High, and went to West Valley College for a
while.  I attend Saint Andrew's Episcopal Church, where I perform as part
of an acoustic guitar/bass/mandolin army on the first Sunday of each month
(playing music during the communion).  A very cool Protestant Christian
family of faith.
        I'm a mild sports fan, I'm not associated with any political party,
and I'm a very selective omnivore.  My main interests in music are:
progressive, artistic, or bluesy rock; some metal; some "alternative";
reggae; classical and such.  I play guitar, bass, mandolin, and
keyboard/piano.  I'm fluent in French, and know some German, Japanese,
Mandarin Chinese, Welsh, Spanish (learned on the streets like a proper
Californian), some Italian and Russian words, an eastern Indian greeting,
and can count to ten in Dutch (yeah, that'll come in handy!).
        Every summer, I am the archery director at a camp for
underprivileged children.  during the other 51 weeks of the year, I work as
a contractor for the high-tech companies, doing database mantenance,
accounting support, or customer service, wherever there's a need for my
skills on the Mac.  I play bass guitar, and sing backing vocals (and lead
on the one song I wrote) in my band, Sydney Page, a Bay Area band that's
been together since 1991, in various incarnations.  I also enjoy hiking the
hills, visiting the beach (and our Mother, the ocean), and spending time
with my friends and family, which are ever-growing, and which I consider to
be one and the same, since the unity of my immediate family dissolved
several years ago.  Last, and far from least, I immensely enjoy raves!
        My first rave was in September '94.  It was an E-ticket party,
hosted by Jeremiah.  I was introduced to the scene by my friend Jason.  He
asked me "Do you like to party?"  Yes.  "Do you like techno?"  I'm not
sure.  He then convinced me to go to the party.  I discovered that
wonderful white happiness there, and was overwhelmed (Crescent Moons)!  The
whole experience blew my mind: the intensity of the music, the crowd
response, those oh-so-tricky moves, and especially the people, who are
(almost) all so friendly and ready with smiles, handshakes, and the
ever-controversial hugs!  I was completely drawn in, and have since been to
such wonderful parties as Basics (not the last one), Organic, Friends and
Family, Harmony, Beautiful People, Tribal Funk (the one at the Cow Palace),
Begin Again ('95 kick-off), and others.  I don't get out to nearly enough
parties, but it feels much better when I've gone without for a few weeks.
Now I gotta figure out ways to incorporate the friends I make through
raving into the rest of my world.  I'd like that very much, as I love every
person, want to be the best kind of friend to all that I can be, and I just
plain dig all you beautiful people!
        Oh, yeah, I'm 5'10" tall, weigh 140 lbs., and have long, curly,
light brown hair and hazel eyes.  I'm usually clean-shaven, but now I'm
experimenting with a silly little goatee :)
        That's me in a nutshell.  Any questions?

Peaceloveunityrespect to all!

I would like to respond because I am that "other person" who made a statement
a little too blatant for some people. I agree that there are many people in
various forms of law enforcement reading this list. They have been reading
everything on the Internet for years now. They have also been listening to so
called "undergound" info lines for Raves and attending Raves for years now.
Nothing that is put on this list could ever be a news to them because they
have been seeing it firsthand and making their own judgements about illegal
activity. In the same way, people have been searching the net for years, ala
Kibo, and have been able to find out about people's posts for years. So, I
fully support the previous posts reminding us of the above, and to remind us
of alternatives if you don't want something you post to be attributed to you
if you worry about employers, police, family, pissed-off parents, etc. 

So, what we have are really two issues:
A. I don't want people to find out about my posts.
B. We don't want to tip the authorities off to what goes on in this list.

The first one we have taken care of: use an anonymous remailer.

The second point is a bit more thorny. How do we have an open forum of
discussion where we present the truth, and at the same time not let the
"wrong" group know what is going on. 

First, I would like to point out that there is very little talk of illegal
activities on this list. Raves are not inherently illegal, and not everyone
breaks the law when they go to one. So, I would doubt that there has been much
that would incriminate anyone from their postings on this list. I bet that
many of the "authorites" who read this list give up soon afterwords because
there is very little that they can get out of it. How long can a cop stand
virtual hugs?

When it comes to discussions about drugs, it becomes very much like
homosexuality. It is one of the biggest lifestyles that people still need to
be "in the closet" and not even talk about things that would make us appear to
look like a drug user, or that you even associate with them. So, like gays, it
is a personal decision about when to "come out" or how much you want to even
associate yourself with drug users. I won't attack anyone personally for their
own choices in this matter. But, this kind of self-censorship further
marginalizes people who have a legitemate right to speak the truth, in
addition to creating hysteria and misinformation.

On the other hand, I've made the decision not to be intimidated about who I
associate myself with. I have seen drug use; it exists; we cannot change that
fact. What will change other people's opinions is showing that there are real,
normal people that do drugs and have positive experiences. Showing how
fundamentally wrong the conventional ideas about drug use are will do more to
make the situation better than trying to crawl under a rock when someone
shines a light on us.

That doesn't mean that you should go ahead and describe drug transactions, or
your plans to rob a bank. I don't think anyone is stupid enough to do that;
that is the kind of discretion people should use. But to not talk about a
particular subject is pretty insidious, since you are now doing the job of the
police for them. They don't even need to lift a hand, and they have censored
you.

With that said, perhaps I will take back some of my previous assessment of
drug use. When I said acid was everywhere, that must be taken contextually.
When compared with someone wondering whether it is done at all, yes, it is
fairly prevalent. But, what relative percentages to the total attendance at
raves? That would probably be pretty small. Anyways, I will try to temper my
statements a bit more in the future.

But, I hope people use discretion about what they admit or who they name, not
what they see and know to be truth.

Hey all!  My name is Rob(aka DJ Arkay) and I am hoping to put the
collective mind of the group to work to help me out with a problem.

Reason is that I have been put in charge of organizing a fund-raiser for a
local AIDS hospice.  Flexible about the date, but shooting for some time in
early June.  I'm estimating about 600-700 people.   I would prefer a place
that's already set up with sound and equiptment (and permits!). Think that
the loft space at DV8 would be ideal.  Does anyone know how to get in touch
with management there?

Also, if people have any other suggestions for their favorite medium size
party spots, would love to hear them.  Our preference is a place that is
"split-up" i.e. NOT the King Street garage.  Want a space where people can
chill too!

Looking forward to hearing from y'all.

peace...

	I agree, I would never wear those things, at a rave or otherwise.
I am much more into wearing leather, latex, or spandex personally.

	Well I would wear heels, but that's because I am not there to dance,
only to enjoy the company, music, etc. - nothing that requires me to be
hopping around a lot. Besides, my tendons are too short to wear flat shoes
or go barefoot for any amount of time...

No, of course not!  The scene is about ACCEPTANCE.  But that was the only
foolproof method for me to find the ravers in a sea of club-goers.  --

For the people that are interested, I was using altavista looking up some
record label and found a place that describes and give examples of the
following type of music...High Energy, House, Acid House, Disco House, Tribal
House, Progressive House, Techno/Techno House, Acid Jazz, Trance, Breakbeat,
Energy Alternative, and Ambient......The url is
 
www.access.digex.net/~krister/dict.html
 
I'm not for sure were they got there info from, but most of it seems to be
about right. IMO.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Anyone can and should wear whatever they are most comfortable in.
Acceptance, comfort, and freedom are some of the values of the scene that,
IMO, make us cherish it so much.  Why else would we spend hours daily on a
discussion list unless we reveled in how raving makes each one of us feel??
Exclusion and conformity have never in my mind been associated with
raving.

That said, I happen to LOVE the look!  I'm absolutely delighted when I see
someone with bright colors on, sparkles, blinky lights, stuffed animals and
a big smile.  What that means to me is that that person LOVES the scene.
They have embraced it wholeheartedly.  They have cared enough to become
another dazzling spectacle in the night's continual trip of swirling color.
And their cheerful return to babydom (pigtails, pacifiers, and primary
colors) means they understand one of the deepest aspects of rave and e: a
return to the innocent lovingness of childhood, before society twists us.
To be like a child, in the moment constantly, open, excited, pure heart.

They are like costumes for the ritual.   I do not venture out in full
regalia, but I know that the act of applying glitter to my face has become
ritualized for me - I  am immediately in anticipation, and feel naked
without it on.  I want to shine in the night, happiness sparkling on my
face.  My hair in braids keeps it out of my face.  My shiny lights become
toys.  My sneakers let me dance all night.

Rave is not homogenous.  There are trendy ravers, teenagers, technophiles,
rockers, Deadheads, and many others.  They are each individual and all
united in the communal experience.  Clothing is exterior, let's not have it
separate us.

Like I said in my earlier post, at 1015 I simply needed an easy signifier
(where were the laminates? :> ).  At school I'll sport my huge plastic
blinky ring, and strangers will nod and give me knowing smiles - we know
what it means.  Rave adornments sometimes allow us to identify and connect
with each other - isn't that what it's about?

Much Love,
   Nancy

Is the "Crunchman" of SFR fame the very same Captain Crunch of every party
I've ever been to (the huge and the obscure)?

BTW, Captain has his own webpage, detailing his rave trips (in both senses)
across the globe.  I haven't read it yet, but seems interesting.  Can't

Has anyone ever seen Father Time at a rave?  He was at Begin Again to kick
off 1995, and his outfit was elaborate and fun!  You could tell it took
effort for him to deck himself out like that, and the results were
spectacular.  His name was William, and he was into metaphysics (I think
his business is related to that).  I haven't seen him since, but I've seen
plenty of other colorful characters (just about everyone I see :)).  If we
gotta wear clothes, let's have fun with 'em!

Though the way I try to identify and connect with other ravers is through their
vibe (are they smiling? dancing? happy to be there? comfortable with the music?)
I have strong opinions on clothing as an avenue to personality expression....
 
As someone who loves to herself through clothing, HATS, jewelry, HATS, body
adornment (tattoos, pierces) and HATS - I always love to see people dress to
express themselves through their clothing when they go out -- (and note, that's
EXpress, not IMpress -- I personally don't care if other people like what I'm
wearing, I care about if I like it and it makes ME feel good)

And isn't raving (and life in general) about being who we are and being willing
to express it openly?

It doesn't matter what you or I wear..  it may be tie-die and jeans, and it may
be glam-rock-club-kid silver lame with 20" custom-made platform shoes -- but it
hopefully expresses which part of you you're feeling like that night!  It gives
people a first clue of who you are (along with a big smile, of course, without
which we're never really dressed).

I was in Phoenix this weekend and went to a big party in a cool old hotel
(Derrick May and Stacey Pullen rocked that house) and was SOOO happy to see so
many of the Phoenix kids (very young scene there, maybe they like to move here
when they're old enough) all dressed up!  Two beautiful sisters in shiny wigs
and silver fake eyelashes, wearing the biggest most glorious smiles...   Lots of
glitter and painted faces, lots of personality being expressed...   One amazing
pair of huge furry yellow pants (I want them!)...   and a huge purple feather
wig...

If you're someone who feels that what you're wearing isn't part of who you are,
I encourage you to try dressing up a little -- maybe just a different kind of
hat, or a pair of pants a little bigger, brighter, funkier than you usually wear
-- some sparkles on your eyes -- whatever it is, when you put it on, you should
feel a little like "this is too cool (or too weird, or too sexy, whatever), I
can't get away with this" -- then when you go out in it, some little part of who
you really are might get expressed.  Go for it!  Dressing up is fun!  See you
out there!

I think that everyone should go back to the days of wearing crazy hats.  
I like hats.  I have a bunch of them and hardly get to wear them enough.  
Another fun thing to wear is Lazer Tag.  It also provides for a fun game 
if you get bored at all.  That is until the batteries die.  But the 
sensor thing on your chest is really cool looking...  Next time you see a 
guy wearing the lazer tag thing, ask him if he's me... :D

Woohoo!  Wotta humdinger!  Originally approached the idea of attending 
this party with a little trepidation, sorta unsure how it would go off, 
or if it would go off at all.  Sorta far to start off with (ok, ok, you 
SoBayers & sac people, I know I'm whining! :), didn't like the idea of 
driving to Hayward from Concord.  Wasn't sure of the dj line up, didn't 
know many of them.  Didn't expect to see anybody I knew there except 
maybe Wayne (& you all know how hard he can be to track down at a party! 
:P), cause the other people I expected to show sounded like they weren't 
going to after all.  But I thought a few days in advance that I would 
give it a try anyway.  During the day of the party, it seemed that things 
just couldn't go wrong!  Had travelled to Seattle & San Diego to visit 
friends & family (as many of you know), had just gotten in at something 
like 1:30 am early Saturday morning, so was relaxed & happy seeing people 
I loved & having the week off from work, so this helped set the mood for 
the day anyway.  Then I realize my friend from out of town is in town 
this weekend for his birthday, and I also realize that my bestest of 
friends Sam (some of you have met him! :) should also be in town cause 
the friend who is having a birthday is Sam's brother!  So I call their 
family's house to see if Sam is indeed in town, and sure enough he is.  
Then while talking to him, he puts me on hold for a sec, then comes back 
to tell me the whole family has invited me to go with them to this phat & 
phancy restaurant (excellent food & company!) for the big birthday dinner 
for Howard (Sam's brother), on them!  So we all end up going to this 
restaurant together, the family & several old friends.  So I'm sitting 
with numerous friends that I have known & loved for over a decade (Sam's 
family totally treats me like a family member) at a big table where we 
have a huge view of the Bay, San Francisco, the G.G. bridge, & the hills 
where we watch the sun make a spectacular departure while eating.  
Afterwards we go home & have cake & coffee & presents, & afterwards I 
hang out with Sam & my friend Joanie (whom I've known since 3rd grade!) & 
we just sit & talk & hang out, definite good quality time.  After a day 
like this, I just couldn't hold back a feeling of complete happiness and 
I just knew that going to basix would be the right thing to do, cause my 
whole day's vibe was so right on, and I couldn't lose!  Right, right, 
right!!  :D

So I get there, and in spite of my original fears of not seeing one 
person I knew, almost as soon as I walked in there I found a big ol' 
love-puddle of many of my friends (along with several people I had not 
yet but would soon incorporate into my group of friends!)  I hear "There 
you are! I was wondering when you were going to show!"  I run into 
another friend and he just gives me a nifty partee favor out of the blue. 
The music is rocking!  Everybody is so friendly!  And it was held, of all 
places, in the conference-type room of a bowling alley (what is it about 
bowling & raving?)  It never got too crowded, it never got too hot (& 
when it did get hot, the doorways were all open for you to get fresh 
air), the dance floor was never too packed, there was a chill area to sit 
in where you could hear the music plus there was a quiet little chill 
area in the far back where you couldn't hear the music if that's what you 
wanted, and it was just all there for me.  Part of what made it a little 
different from my usual rave is that for some reason, my whole group of 
friends I was with pretty much stuck together as a group for the duration 
of the rave, rather than how it is normally for me where we all wander 
around & occasionally run into each other as the party progresses.  Even 
when some of the people would go off & dance, they would come back to the 
group & the group retained its cohesiveness.  It was an awesome family 
group ExpEriEncE!  

I also just discovered something at Basics, or not so much discovered it 
as finally found a way to put into words what I've been experiencing.  I 
must admit I nowadays find myself doing things I would never have thought 
in my (foolish) past that I would do (much like how Matt Lanier described 
in his review of the Tahoe trip)  This doesn't necessarily refer to 
"sexual" things, simply things requiring a much more free state of mind 
than I once upon a time had.  When I found myself doing all those things 
that once upon a time I thought I wouldn't do, what I discovered was that 
it felt completely like coming home!  What I mean by that is that I feel 
like how we interact with people at a rave is how we were born, this 
behavior is completely natural in us, and it's almost instinctive to do 
it.  However, after we're born, society/parents/rules/etc are forced into 
our heads, we're taught how we "should act" because that's what society 
expects from us, and if we do these things anyway (sexual or whatever 
other type of "non-norm according to society" behavior, like I said, 
behavior that requires more freedom of thought & acceptance), society as 
a whole looks down on us & thinks we're "weird" or "deviant" or whatever 
word society uses to describe the way most people don't behave cause they 
think they're not supposed to.  After years & years of this conditioning, 
we easily fall prey to that way of thought, we're stuck with these 
bizarre ideas & thoughts of how we're *supposed* to act, and natural 
behavior like you see at raves is completely out of the question for many 
people.  But!!  Once you do realize that it's all good (with continued 
respect for others of course), you find yourself doing all these things 
as naturally as breathing, and I for one actually feel lighter & more 
buoyant (you C.P. people may know about that!) as the load of years of 
conditioning is lifted off of me (I may have described this feeling 
before), and I feel like I must have felt when I was born & the world was 
new!  Hence the feeling of coming home, of coming full circle back to 
where I should have been all along, & my family is there to share it with 
me!  God I feel like I've changed so much in six months!  Very nice to be 
experiencing it, & nice to be experiencing it with all of you!  :)

Ok, ok, I'm done rambling & blithering now!

Mad tonight:

Mars
Ethan
Jon Santos

@ Bahia Cabana 1600 Market @ Franklin, 18+ w/ID $3, $2 < 11pm. Makes you move.

yet more bsp:

I dropped some tapes by Housewares and Ameba. This one's called Insight and
it's techno and electro - pretty close to what I play at Mad. So if you
like what you hear there...

Ethan's got a kickin' tape live @ Mad that you should bug him for. Maybe
we'll do a limited edition live @ Mad 4-tape boxed set with trading cards,
stickers, and bits of grass from our yards. =)

You can wear whatever the hell you feel like!  That's one thing I like about 
raves, you can dress as normally & boring as you want, or go all out & get 
dressed up in funky costumes & hats & stuff.  For me, I like to be both 
comfortable and also find some interesting way to entertain other people with 
the clothes I wear, not because I'm trying to impress them, but just because 
I enjoy doings that please other people & giving them something fun & nifty 
to look at is fun for me! (like shirts that do nifty things in the 
black-lite, etc) :)

i COMPLETELY agree with your statements about clothing at raves - you 
should wear whatever you feel best in and no one else should judge you 
because of it.  For myself, I only wear full "regalia" to something i 
KNOW is going to be a wild evening, and i feel i'd like to have my outer 
appearance suit my inside mood of crazy happy bouncy fun.

I also love to check out other people's attire, as some of the things i 
see completely delight me (except the GODDAMN WHISTLES - boy sometimes 
I'd like to just ram em down their wearer's throats!) and I like to get 
tripped out on watching some of these incredibly creative folk obviously 
having as much fun as me.

Clothes don't make the person!

	[ On Fridays Nikkita & the holiday drunk-set ]

	While its true that an alcohol drenched crowd seldom does much
	for a party - I thought that Fridays 1015 was a welcome 	
	exception. Yes, the crowd was mixed, as many people in suits
	as there were 'Raver' types - but for me, the overall vibe
	was nothing short of excellent (if not quite incredible).

	Its not the suits themself, or even the alcohol, its the 
	attitude that seems to be prevelant when a party has a 
	(un)healthy mix of these ingredients. At Nikkita, even if 
	these things were present, the attitude wasn't.

	Why not ? Who knows. I'd put it down to some serious music, 	
	and a core of great people having what looked like a really 
	good time. From my side, I was in a seriously good mood, so
	that no doubt helped.
	
	Good party - I'd go again.

	All the best,
	Gary

Does anyone know who was responsible for those main room lights?  They were

6s in Xs boys and girls! I hope ya'll had as good a time as I.  Moonpup,
Sdream and Melissa reviewed it well, so I'm just going to say thank y'all for
making it happen.  May we remember to let the truth and beauty of these kind
of memories shape our reality.

I'm not much good with names, or even sometimes faces, but for some reason
I've got a remarkably clear picture (with name) of each beautiful person I
met this weekend.  Even more enlightening, are the clarified pictures of
faces I assumed I knew.  Conversation has this remarkable ability to expose
common ground that is all too applicable to ones current issues (Rick- You're
appreciated.. big time!)

Moonpup- I hesitiate to let you know how much we're going to miss you, for
fear of you questioning you're decision to travel, but I'm doing it anyway.
 End of may is a ways away though, eh?
Trisha- You are heaven sent, your talent and beauty amazes me, and my only
regret for the weekend was not being able to chant with you more.  To be
continued?

Yikes, I better stop for now or I'll be up all night praising you folks!

Keep yer peepers posted for the next event.  Rumor has it there's this quaint
mountain retreat home overlooking some lush valley in Yosemite, and I hear
it's awful nice there in the spring time! ; )

Love & More Love,
Steveo

hello all-

this message is for a fellow sfraver (me) who is currently in a tremendous
amount of pain.  i'm assuming a huge amount of trust in you, but that's what
i've come to expect and live for.

tonight, i was told by a person whom i care for very much, that the world is
a better place when i'm not around.  not that she needed space, not that she
didn't think we should see each other, that the world is a better place
without me.  i cannot think of a single more hurtful thing to say to another
human.  i feel my life energy has been permenantly damaged, and that i have
been hurt beyond repair by this person with whom i was planning to spend the
rest of my life.  i no longer feel complete, and i'm not so sure that any
amount of raving can fix that.

because of this, i am taking some time off from my current life.  i'm most
likely taking a leave of absence from school for a semester, and i'm trying
to distance myself from the (many) things, places, and occurences that
remind me of this hurtful person.  i'm looking for work to support myself
through this leave.  i do not have the mental or physical energy to
contribute as much to this wonderful sfraves family as i have in the past.
thus, for the next comple months, i may ask for more energy, support, and
love than i am capable of giving back.  i hope everyone understands that i
have tried to give as much as i can to the wonderful individuals in this
community.  because of that, i'm asking for as much support and love as you
are capable of giving to help me through this darkness and pain.

i think you all for being part of raving, the activity that has changed my
life.  i hope i can change my life again, and i love you for whatever
support you can offer.

peace, love, and much pain-

That can be understood Marisa

But I am really in favour of a more relaxed outfit if I am going to a rave. I'd hope if i was able to go with my pajamas, but I normally wear baggy (and very worn out)jeans, a shirt ( which doesn't really need to be so trendy..just a T-shirt) and sneakers. maybe a cap or so to change things a lil' bit.. 

I use this outfit mostly beacuse it's confortable to wear. When i go out raving, I tend to, sometimes, attempt to rest on the ambient room, maybe chill out sitting on the floor..I don't know. It's just that I can't see myself doing such things in the same outfit I would use to go clubbing in some trendy place.

I totally agree, and have to say I just don't understand the whole whistle thing
--- they're TOO LOUD, they HURT YOUR EARS and the ears of everyone around you,
and almost without exception, the people I see blowing them are so wound up,
tweaked out, whatever, they've lost any sense of what's actually going on with
the music....    I say, I you must stick something in your mouth to compulsively
blow on when you're out dancing, put a SOCK IN IT....  and listen to the beat --
that's what we're there for....

Hats off to the SPUNDAE people in their effort to establish a quality weekly 
event in NIKITA.  Last Friday I wasn't even thinking about "The Suits" (does 
anyone wear suits to 1015?)  It was strange, I left the main room for a while 
and when I came back the place was electric-on-fire, obviously Doc had come 
onto the scene and proceeded to deliver the beats in climatic waves.  It was a 
real pleasure to look out and see pretty much the whole room getting off!  
Actually, I found it more positive than my trip to Evolution later that same 
evening. I can't wait for DJ Dimitry (Dee-Lite) this Friday, my B-Day! I'm only 
worried that the room is too small to get enough space to get a groove on. 
Things were pretty tight last Friday, and things have never been the same 
"basswize" since they reconfigured the soundsystem a while back due to noise 
complaints from the new development next door. But it is comforting to have a 
quality weekly to fall back on.

It's always interesting to tune in to sfraves the following week and find out 
that so many of you were at say a place like 1015.  There were three of us from 
Solle Clothes in attendance and we're all on sfraves (I had a new Solle 
"SanFrandisco!"-T)  Anyway, if you see us in the future please say hello. We're 
all three laminately challenged(P.C.) but members of the tribe none the less.

See Ya Out!

Matthew,

        My heart hurts when I read the words you posted.  We don't give
love and we don't take love; we circulate and recycle love, so it's always
abundant, always shared.  Stay close to the people who truly care about
you, and you'll find what you need to refresh and regenerate yourself.  You
are a vital part of this family, as are we all, and though I've never met
you personally, we connect on a certain level.  Don't dwell on the ignorant
and hurtful words of someone who obviously doesn't get it.  Let us lift you
up, fill you with light and love, and share our open hearts with you as you
do with us.

PLUR, with big hugz & smiles,

- E

I don't know, Leslie...the whistle-blowing is a lot like the clapping.  Are
you opposed to clapping to the music?  Those who know what's up will blow
their whistles as a complement to the music, to add a little something
extra to the vibe, and try not to deafen anyone.  Maybe some people get
carried away, but as long as they're having fun and not dissing anyone,
it's all good, IMHO.
BTW, I'll never bring a whistle to a rave :)

When I went to my first party, I thought I'd be scorned and ridiculed
because of how I was dressed.  I wore a Rush concert tee-shirt (from
Presto) with the sleeves cut off, black 501s and black harness boots.  My
hair was down some of the time, if not all.  I was the epitome of a
dirt-head rocker, but no one gave so much as a sideways glance at me!  I
was impressed, and quickly understood by the fact that everyone was wearing
something completely different, that anything's appropriate ravewear!  And,
every time I think I've seen it all, someone in a completely new and
different outfit catches my eye.  It's fun.  I don't think I own anything
that I could wear to a rave that's not funkier than my everyday wear, but
I'm inspired to go through my stuff and find something interesting,
comfortable, and fun (I do love my SHROOMARAMA shirt, and everyone gets off
on it, but I don't want to wear the same thing all the time).

Clothing...what a concept!

Is anyone going down to DUNE next weekend.   I'm still trying to find
someone driving down who has extra room in their car.    I actually have
a car,   I just need someone who has a drivers license to drive it.

Does anyone want to go to DUNE and not have a car but has a license?
Please get in touch with me ASAP.

What kind of a hatred, evil, and cruelness is boiling in this person? It
is understandable that at times in ones relationship, things may not be
as expected, but I cannot see that anyone in the right mind would have
the 'guts' to say such a thing.

Matt, from your letter it is obvious that you are a kind-hearted and caring
person. Eventhough your energy is dented at the moment, it will be restored,
and think your plan to take a break is probably appropriate. Been there,
done that, and must say that I am more alive than ever. Hang in there.

It seems that this person you cared for very much, had a lot of negative
energy in her life, and for some reason released it all on you. It may
have nothing to do with you at all, but it was probably some kind of
'release valve'.

Eventhough I do not contribute as much as most of the people, I am sure that
you can count on all in order to support you in this and bring you lots of
love and energy.

Hang in there bro... I'm sure that your energy will be restored with time,
and that you will rise high above the people that bring negativity to this
world....

Peace, and Love.

woooo woooo did I push some buttons responding on the whistle issue?

Eric P. asks if I mind people clapping ... c'mon Eric, I'll put a whistle-blower
(loud, constant and with no breakbeat, so we can get the true effect) on one
side of you in a crowded room, and a hand-clapper (dancing, of course, and
hearing the music) ... and you tell me which one you want to be next to ..
I'll be movin' on the side of the hand-clapper real quick, let me tell you!

And Kenji asks if I'd rather have cat calls --again, no comparison on volume and
annoyance -- so, yes, if I had to choose, maybe I would rather have any sound
generated by a human voice...  

Next time you see me out, come dance with me, I'll scream and whoop it up with
the best of 'em -- but I promise never to do something that hurts your ears or
intrudes on your appreciation of the music .... unless of course  you don't like
how I dance, in which case you may have to close your eyes..   ; )

a new can of worms might be my feelings on some live drumming....  what can be
worse that being in the middle of the sound of a dj who's creating an
unpredictable, artful and evocative breaking beat -- and an enthusiastic, but
not quite tuned-in conga drummer (often not the one who brought the drum in) who
thinks that the live drum should set the pace -- and then the battle begins....
hmmmmm...  live drumming, when it's good, it's very VERY good, and when it's
bad, we feel like we're on two different planets....  

over and out on this one!   Leslie  : )

She was probably on the rag or PMSing ... (ooh, those nasty things men
aren't supposed to say ... phttthhpppttthht!) ... It's best to assume
that about 1/2 the actions of any male or female are actually lame and
irrational hormone-driven crap that is ultimately inexplicable --
perhaps the thoughts and actions of that person felt like a solution to
the problems of humanity *AT* *THAT* *MOMENT*, and the next day, it was
just a hoot and a knee-slapper. Whaddya expect from a bunch of crazy
monkeys anyways? The Design specified that we were only supposed to try
and reproduce more ... and now we've got all this excess neural,
sexual, and hormonal energy, which most of the time, in some of the
people, spells trouble. 

That's why I suggest everybody get a lobotomy. Let's start over and make
the world a saner place. Visualize World Electroshock!

Kenji,

I think dog whistles would be really much better than cat calls.  I 
mean, have you ever really met a cat that likes a loud party?

Thought I'd jump in,

Matt,

I dont know how anyone can say this to such a wonderfull person.  I dont know
what kind of relationship you have with this person, but she certainly does
not know what she is talking about.  After briefly meeting you this past
weekend, I know that the world is a much better place with you here.  Your
happiness and quest to make everyone else around you smile this past weekend
will live in my heart for ever.  You have changed the way I view my
surroundings.  When you are feeling a little down, just remember all the new
friends you met this weekend, and how much we all love and care for you.

One of my favorite raving quotes came from a good friend of mine.  We were
getting ready to leave a 4th of July Gathering party a few years back, and
trying to gather up our gang so we could head home.  Everyone was accounted
for but one, our friend Courntey was no where to be found.  As we were looking
for him, a friend said "What an night, we lost one friend but made a hundred."
 We eventually found our lost friend, but I will remember this quote forever. 
Remember this as your pain heals.  Remember all the truley wonderfull
friendships that were made this weekend.  Friendships that will last a
lifetime.  Friendships that, in time, will replace the emptiness you feel now.

-M

hello all-

this message is for a fellow sfraver (me) who is currently in a tremendous
amount of pain.  i'm assuming a huge amount of trust in you, but that's what
i've come to expect and live for.

tonight, i was told by a person whom i care for very much, that the world is
a better place when i'm not around.  not that she needed space, not that she
didn't think we should see each other, that the world is a better place
without me.  i cannot think of a single more hurtful thing to say to another
human.  i feel my life energy has been permenantly damaged, and that i have
been hurt beyond repair by this person with whom i was planning to spend the
rest of my life.  i no longer feel complete, and i'm not so sure that any
amount of raving can fix that.

because of this, i am taking some time off from my current life.  i'm most
likely taking a leave of absence from school for a semester, and i'm trying
to distance myself from the (many) things, places, and occurences that
remind me of this hurtful person.  i'm looking for work to support myself
through this leave.  i do not have the mental or physical energy to
contribute as much to this wonderful sfraves family as i have in the past.
thus, for the next comple months, i may ask for more energy, support, and
love than i am capable of giving back.  i hope everyone understands that i
have tried to give as much as i can to the wonderful individuals in this
community.  because of that, i'm asking for as much support and love as you
are capable of giving to help me through this darkness and pain.

i think you all for being part of raving, the activity that has changed my
life.  i hope i can change my life again, and i love you for whatever
support you can offer.

peace, love, and much pain-

I'm still trying to comprehend this weekend.  I'm able to type because my
fingers are the only muscles in my body that do not hurt.

Snowboarding on Saturday was a blast!  Only my second time on the slopes and I
think I got the hang of it.  I'm actually able to turn both ways and not fall
every 10 feet.  I cant wait to go again.

Hitting the hot tub Saturday night after a long day of boarding turned my body
into mush.  My muscles decided to go into full shut down mode so most of the
evening was spent relaxing on the couch listening to some of the most
incredible music i've heard in a long time.  Rick and Eric, you guys are
awesome!!  Your set of truley beautifull ambient sounds soothed my aching
bones.  We definatly need to hook up soon.  Moonpup, I hate to see you leave
and can only hope that I get to see you spin as many times as possible before
you're off to the UK.  Matthew, Your constant smiles and quest to hug everyone
as much as possible was truly inspiring. Jason, You used your little crate of
records like a box of magic.  Your set was brillant.  A special thanks to you
and to Robert for the company on the drive up and back home on Sunday.  What a
beutifull drive it was around the lake and thru the hills to Kirkwood.  We
couldnt have picked a better weekend to visit one of the most beutifull areas
in the world.  Kirkwood on Sunday was great.  I ran into my good friend and x
roommate from Santa Cruz, Mary, who was up for the day.  Our two other x
roommates from SC, Chad and Jeff, work and Timber Creek resturant at Kirkwood,
so it was a short, but nice reunion.  We arrived at Kirkwood much too late to
purchase a lift ticket.  30 bucks for 2 hours of boarding just didnt seem
worth it.  Mary was nice enough to lend my her lift ticked becasue she was
taking a break.  I only had enough energy for one run.  My muscles were in
soooooo much pain!!  Jason borrowed a lift ticket as well and went up for a
few runs.  

There are so many more people I'd like to thank for a wonderfull weekend, but
as usual, names have slipped out of my head for the time being.  There were so
many to remember, and I'm sure I'll be seeing all of you soon (Sunset next
weekend!!).  My quietness got the best of me this weekend, so I unfortunatly  
didnt get a chance to really chat with everyone there.  Everyone added to a
woderfull experience that will stay with me as one of the best raving
experiences I have ever had.    I'd especially like to thank SteveO for
putting all this together and for finding the best cabin in Tahoe. 

Thank you all, Love to all.

-Mark

Uh, I realize this is probably a light-hearted joke, but I still can not 
let it pass without expressing disapproval.  This is one of the ways men 
love to dismiss women, and rationalize why they should be able to do 
this.  So, although it is being used in a joking way, I don't find it 
funny.  I know Neils comment is just asking for a reply like mine, so 
I'll leave you with the thought of how this comment does not help 
*bridge* the gender divide.

My best regards to Matt to whom I'm sending my support.

just consider me another bitchy woman (heavy sarcasm laces my voice)

Hmmmm...Except when Dave Bayer does his whistle thing.  Man, I thought it 
was part of the the music, he was so good.  Not too loud, beats were VERY 
interesting, and it added ALOT to tthe music.  Keep blowing your whistle, 
Dave, some of us REALLy enjoy it! :)

Niels,

Your idea about lobotomies is fantastic!!  You ARE a genuis!!!
I propose that because your idea is so great, that YOU be the first 
SFRAVER to head the line as we a queue up behind you for our lobotomies!
It will be a position of great honor, Niels.

psssst  SFravers; we'll all break for lunch right after Niels get his 
lobotomy, and maybe party too hard, (in celebration of his GOOD idea,) 
that maybe all of us hormoned-out monkeys will be too stupid to line up 
for our own lobotomies....

Niels,
I really hope your ass is feeling these flames, buddy!

Matt,
Broken, shattered and crushed hearts are sometimes the price we pay for 
love.  You are better off without a person who can say cruel things like 
that to you, (unless you were into that, no judgement here.) 

Love this group!

Diana Greer

okay this is my first post to sfraves, but i'm form the midwest so you
know.  and all i gotta say is damn, this would have never happened out
here.  a thread just went through mw-raves a coupla months or so ago about
stuff like this.  the fashion here, *especially* in chicago, is cliquey as
hell and definitely outta hand.  if someone came to a party in chicago
dressed like this they would without a doubt be made to feel outta place.
it seems to "fit in" out here you gotta have the latest styles, huge phat
grinds and q's, big polos and sweaters...i dunno.  i can't really decide.
on the one hand i think anyone that comes out to party should be able to
wear whatever the hell they want to without feeling out of place, but i
also love being at a party and looking around and seeing all these cute lil
kidz in their phat pantz and huge sweaters and bleached hair and facial
piercings etc etc.  there's also the point someone made that they felt like
they came to parties to escape the normal world and they don't wanna see
those kinds of clothes around them, and how if they, say, went to the
opera, they wouldn't wear their phat gear, they'd dress appropriately for
that situation.  i dunno...  i guess y'all are just more open-minded when
it comes to style out there than the midwest kidz are.  oh well.  just
wanted to kinda introduce myself and hopefully shed some light on what the
style thing is like elsewhere...

love, luck, and lollipops,

	For what, 3 years now, I have had people coming up to and 
pulling my whistle out of my mouth when I wasn't even playing it. I had 
someone at a Wicked come up to me and tell me I didn't get something or 
other cuz there was a flourscent orange thing in my mouth. Funny thing 
is, no one has ever pulled it when I have been blowing it. Some of 
this behavior is founded on the fact that some people do not play rhythms 
that go with the music and because of that it does grate on people's 
nerves. But if someone plays a whistle, a drum, a pair of sticks, a dige, 
or what have you with a little something, and that little something makes 
it fit, I will definitely be right where I was standing dancing hard with 
a big grin on my face cuz right about then, the energy levels are going 
to really high and that's what I like...

Diana, come to think of it, you are right... I've seen many a dog at loud 
events, but cats seem to hide.  I guess dog whistles are the prefered 
choice.  But now the question is, in what situation would a cat call?  And 
who would a cat call anyway?

When I was in college (Antioch in Ohio) we used to have nude dance parties
all the time..Actually, they were a lot like saunas.. we would seal off
the (co-ed!) showers with plastic and duct tape, aim the hot jets at the
wall..and usually, bring in a keg..and lots of other refreshments...  :)
!!!!! These parties were trly a blast... Still legendary among those who 
were there... High density fun  :)
  We would usually have a DJ next door in one of the common rooms..
It was great.. There's nothing like a beer shampoo while listening to 
your favorite tunes.... Sort of like the soap thing, which I don't think 
has made it here.. (it's popular in Ibiza, especially)
Basically, the dance floor is waterproofed, and foam is pumped down over 
the dancers..Raving nude (or in swim gear) would be great.. if only it 
wasn't for the sexual harassment issue.. (which is significant..)
What can I say, Filters can be devised..

On a similar (soapy) theme..
I understand that a new "foam" based lubricant which also completely 
kills the HIV virus is in final beta testing... If this makes it through 
the FDA tests.. it may change the party scene forever.

hello all-

first thing, i'm alive, regardless how doubtfull that was last night.  the
messages of support and love i have received today have been overwhelming.
it reaffirms why i'm in this scene (family is a better place to put it) in
the first place.  i'm feeling closer to my old self, and hope to be my
smiling, hugging, boppin' self soon.  i wouldn't have jumped back so fast
without all your support.  consider all youselves hugged RIGHT NOW!!!

second thing-  whistles, clothes, it's all good.  this recent thread about
the whistles makes me wonder- do we have the right to tell someone not to do
something at a rave?  when i entered this scene, i was amazed by the
diversity of color, thought, and action.  i love the whistles and the energy
they provide.  yes, as a musician, their common lack of rhythm annoys me,
but who am i to buy into the mindset that says the dj is the only person
allowed to set the rhythm and the rhythms of others don't matter?

my advice - if the whistle annoys you - realize that that's another person
blowing it.  that person is capable of love, pain, joy, creativity, and all
the other emotions you are capable of.  don't take it out of their mouth,
don't glare at them, don't curse them for being tweeked out, appreciate
their rhythm and their contribution to life.  some people have a trained
sense of rhythm, other's don't.  both are good, and both are needed for a
good community.

i love you all.

peace, love, and plastic baby whistles-

fist off, here's a cross-thread flame bait idea... If someone is playing 
thie rwhistle and it's bugging you, don't get angry, just go up and hug 
them until the stop :D  They will either be so overwhelmed by your love 
that they'll stop whistling or they will be so offended at your groping 
that they'll stop.... 

On a more serious note, many of you might have heard about the disco 
disaster in the Philippines.  They say 105 people were killed after a fire 
broke out in the booth of this disco and there was only one door to exit 
through.  I think that we should send our vibes out to those folks as 
well because they were trying to have a good time, vibin' down there to 
whatever grooves that DJ was spinnin and the next moment it was hell and 
chaos.  And think of the poor DJ!  Something kind of mythical though 
about going up in flames with your wax....  But seriously, it really 
isn't a funny issue and I think we should take a couple fo moments to 
think about the people who lose their lives trying to keep a vibe going.
Peace!

I respect your taste and there have been (rare) occasions where I've
actually enjoyed little skilled conga playing along with the DJ.  
But many of us really prefer to trance out to the otherwordly
sounds and machine-driven beats that take us beyond the limits
of human performance.  Vocals, drum breaks, acoustic instruments
are fine as long as they are sampled, chopped, pitch-shifted and 
looped.  

So much of the music we rave to, from acid house to trance
is crafted to guide us toward a transcendental experience.
For me, the self-indulgent performer (for whom the music just
ain't enough) does little more than work to de-evolve us back 
into the protoplasm and goo from which we sprang.  This is great
for our inner child/infant that craves to wallow in its own spew, 
but it's mostly a primordial drag for the psychonaut seeking 
to soar amongst the cosmos.

Looking forward to 2morrow's "Light".  
I'm not as pretentious when I'm dancing, so pls come and say hi.  d:)

It's up to 150 now, and the description of the venue doesn't sound too far
off from some of the places I've been to here in SF. One exit, permitted
for only 35 people (no doubt due to the one exit) with a crowd of over 400
people. Something to keep in mind. My thoughts go out to the families and
spirits of those who perished.

Oh, the DJ was ok - he was interviewed in the paper.

Just wanted to let everyone know that I'm glad the sun is staying out
longer.  I get so damn depressed during the winter when it starts getting
dark at 4:30.  I guess this means more outdoor events (sunsets!!!) and such.
For some reason, I always feel happier in the afternoon in Spring and Summer
- kinda that happy, lazy (and dare I say pretty damn near stoney) feeling.
I've always wondered why.

Happy spring to y'all,

Mr. Jake

Please wear them Noah!!  I miss hats, too.  The only way to make the scene
what we want (as stimulating as possible!) is to do it ourselves!  I
realized this recently as I wandered around a rave wishing for more smiles,
more toys, more characters.  One of the lessons of raving, for me, is that
we cannot search  outside of ourselves for what we want.  WE make it happen
- and that means bring out the hats!

I hope to meet you at the next party.  I'll look for the guy wearing the
3-foot-tall Dr. Seuss hat! ;) .

I'm not sure here, are you being sarcastic, caustic, or joking?

Regardless,this makes me wonder if you've ever fully participated in a drum 
circle as fully as you would participate in a rave.  I suppose that if you 
are more into transcendance through technology, then a "self-indulgent 
performer" may distract, but personally, I've had much more uplifting and 
transcendant experiences while wacking away at congas (especially in drum 
circles) than any dj set that I've ever heard.:)  If you're not into the 
"primordial de-evolved indulgence of our inner child/infant protoplasm" 
thing, that's fine, but to belittle it the way you seem to be doing it is a 
little like making fun of your mother because she likes to reminisce about 
your childhood. ;)

no offense intended!

Hello fellow sfravers,
  A friend of mine, Allen Cohen, is working on an interesting new project.
He asked me to forward this to the list.
-Chris

Forwarded message:

The SF Oracle was the leading underground psychedelic newspaper
published in the Haight Ashbury in ths 60s. It innovated content and
graphic revolutions in print media, and was a guide and chronicler
of the ideas and and ideals of the 60s. Allen Cohen, one of its founders
and editors, wants to put a new Oracle for the 21st century on the WEB.
We are putting together a team of multimedia and WEB innovators to make
this a reality. We are looking for web wizards and witches who
would like to play a major role in creating a consciousness
expanding and socially significant force on the WEB. We also need
financial angels, sponsers and marketers to establish a financial base
for this launching. Please if you are interested send e-mail to
oracleweb@lists.best.com. Thank you

Hi!
 The ability to trance out is essientially what SOME of us are seeking. 
However the trance state of mind can be achieved on ones own under any 
enviromental situation. I certainly try to help create spaces that allow 
for the trance state but it is up to the individual to go there (leading 
a horse to water and making it (or not) drink). This ability to trance 
demonstrates the power the individual has over their internal state. 
Yogi's have been teaching this for a looong time. I feel that many of us 
are creating new territories in order to teach one another this vibe. 
Ideally then we can take this vibe to other situations that need it =)
Also ideally we should be able to invoke this state within ourselves 
under most (if not all ;) ) conditions.
 I suggest focusing on the vibe rather than the disstractions if at all 
possible (sometimes impossible it seems) and perhaps you can reach the 
disstraction with your vibe. Also keep in mind that the disstraction 
(bells, whistles, foghorns) may be helping to drive someone to their own 
trance state. If nothing else I find that putting my fingers in my ears 
and kinda grinning and grimicing at the oft times TOO LOUD whistle blower
will work miracles.
PS I seriously appreciate all ya's input  :)
                                  (peace)

	And for others, the group experience where we are all pulled to 
the same state is focal point. Here, those who seek to trance out into 
their own separate worlds only drain the party of the vital life giving 
energy which we seek to cultivate until it explodes outward, carrying us 
with. What would a party be without the yells and screams of the 
crowd (do these ruin the music as well)? That building of energy in 
the dance room, the building of the tribal, primitive intensity; this is  
the reason I got involved in parties. It is why I like the faster, harder 
music that is so hard to find in this city. It is also the topic I happen 
to take the most shit on from people who have never experienced it which 
is how I percieve the comment about how whistling is great for the inner 
child that "craves to wallow in its own spew".
	I still do not understand why whistling come not possibly mimick a
drum machine. I have been involved with music (both computer controlled
and performed by organic means... Basicly both people
breathing/pounding/strumming out music but I don't know how to phrase this
without someone misinturrepting what I mean) since I was about 10 years
old. Over this time, I have been a part of small groups, solo projects,
and 100+ person bands. I have seen groups that are as tight as a computer,
and I know how it feels to be playing along with a drum machine because I
cannot tell that I am necessarily playing (and as soon as I think about
it, it stops and I fumble, and the line that what rolling off my tongue
dies). So why do I whistle if I cannot tell I am doing it? Well, first,
the cycle of breathing, and tongue movements and basicly everything that
goes into playing a whistle I do with or without... It's just what
happens. So the whistle fits naturally in there and gives that slight back
pressure to my breath which feels so nice. In addition to at feeling, it
usually makes people hoot and holler and jump around which sends that
energy up just another notch that I was talking about before. Which is
"right"? Can both of our interpretations exist at the same party? 
Probably, because I don't keep whistling if it doesn't feel right...

WHOOOAAAA, there, tiger.  I think this is being just a tad bit reductionist.
I respect your opinion on the matter, but I think that's taking it a little
too far.  If someone enjoys dressing up at a rave and you don't like how
they look, should they then not dress that way (this isn't hypothetical, I
know people who look down on people who dress certain ways at raves)?  I
don't think sight is any more intrusive than sound.  One might say, "well,
it's easier to shut your eyes than your ears.  But lets face it, most raves
are big places and if you don't like what you hear around you, given the
volume of the music it isn't too difficult to move thirty feet away (or even
just a few towards the speaker) and be out of range of that person's
whistle-blowing or conga-playing or what have you.

Just my 2.5, 
Jake

Speaking of hats, I need a new one (yes, I'm a hat addict).  I have my
standard everyday snap cap that I wear everywhere, but I'd like something a
little flashier for raves and such.  Anyone know any good places in SF to
get relatively inexpensive hats?

Hello All,

I recieved this letter from someone I work with. She recived it from??? (It
had a bunch of CC's and forwords added to it.) I don't know a donor that
would help. Because of my nephew going through Leukemia and Chimo right now
I know that the feelings this person is going through must be intence. I
wish only to help by sending this letter to everyone I know, and I hope
that you send it on too.

Friends,

My twelve year old sister has Leukemia and needs a bone marrow
>transplant to survive, but has no blood-related siblings. Her name is
Karen, and she is 1/2 Korean and 1/2 North American (European
descendants). Finding out whether or not one is an appropriate donor
requires only a blood test. All expenses for the donor will of course be
paid. If you are or know anyone who is of like origin, please email me
as soon as possible at <mdoyle@cosmix.com>. I would also appreciate your
sharing this message with the people you know. Karen's doctors are
searching through the registered donor list, and haven't had much luck.
>Our best bet is to find someone who is not yet registered as a donor. I
welcome any suggestions you have, and appreciate your concern.

Thank you,
Mike


She  ^`..'^

Wow, I'm really surprised at the prevailing attitudes towards whistles on
this list.  I had been sadly wondering why whistles had been
disappearing...I guess the vibe of severe peer disapproval (check
yourselves!) has something to do with it.

Hey everyone, for *this* vibe-crazy raver, whistles are the ultimate!
There is an incredible moment when the energy builds so high that even our
fevered dancing can't contain it... a sudden whistle at the moment of
greatest energy brings our expression higher.  I *always* follow the sound
to go dance with the whistler, encouraging them with smiles to continue to
build on the vibe.

Whistles are part of the dancers' contribution to the music.  It is about
COLLECTIVE experience - not *just* the dj, *just* the records spinning, but
what we ALL bring to it.  For the same reason drumming and handclapping
make me ecstatic.  We all become part of the creation.  With cheers and
claps and whistles and stamping feet we offer all of our energy to build an
even greater experience.

BTW, come find me at a party:  I'm the one with glittery face, dancing in
front of the drums (or speaker), clapping like a maniac! :)

Yes.  To add, I like it when people _voice_ their enthusiasm on the 
dancefloor, but within certain bounds.  A hoot or a "yeah" is fine with 
me because they express emotion, simply, almost involuntarily.  What I 
prefer not to hear is anything articulate.  I'm not too into people chanting 
"pump, pump, pump it up" or the dj's name, or whatever.  A side note:  
pre-articulate sounds can also _mean_, either explicitly or implicitly.  
Take "eweh-eweh," which I associate with drunken revelry in the 
disco/funk/vocal-house vein.  Nothing inherently wrong with this -- just that 
it adds to certain contexts (e.g. 70's night), while detracting from others 
(e.g. trance-floor).  

Rok, 
who won't be chanting "whomp there it is" 
to announce the arrival of the next momentous breakdown,
and whose opinions are subject to change.

Just some notes on Basics...

As always, I had a wonderful time here.  It might just be
my sentimentality, but I get such a feeling of family and
togetherness at martin's parties.  It was a nice thing to feel again
because I haven't felt it that strong for several months now.

Technical Details:
The venue was really comfortable... It's good to know that there are 
still new nice places waiting to be discovered out there.
The sound was powerful and crisp... maybe a little loud, but it could
have also been an acoustical phenomenon with the space.
It was neat to see the party build up.  To see three people start
dancing and then just watch it build up until there are hundreds
of people thick in a vibe.
The music was overall very good.  Seemed to start a bit shaky and get better,
never wowed me, but stayed solid through the night.

Philosophical Details:
All or Nothing.
My life seems to be taking on a rather extreme transformation
lately.  It seems to do this every year about this time, my birthday,
but especially in these last three years... each one gets more and
more intense and powerful.  Somedays I feel like I'm still in the womb,
waiting to be born.  I don't want to go into all the details here,
but I do want to share my sense that we have nothing to worry about.
We are getting closer and closer to pure free will and true freedom.
The future has every one of us in mind and is always looking out for us.
Infinity is a realm much greater than any of us ever give credit.

So, my heart to all of you and wishes of the warmth of spring.

-john.

Everybody, forget partying on the week-ends.  Monday is the night!!

Went to MAD last night for the second time.  First time was a month ago
(Ethan, Astral Matrix live - heaven), but never could get my ass in gear to
make it there again (well, work in the morning and midterms had something
to do with it).

MAD is the shit!!  (Articulate vocabulary is a good thing, but sometimes
slang just says it all :> ).

THIS is a special party.  All ravers, all there just to get inside the
music.  What's especially beautiful to me is the sobriety.  A random beer
here or there (the bar noticeably neglected for a "club"), but folks is
just there because they love the music, they love to dance, and they love
each other.

I got there just after Ethan had finished (huge unhappy face).  Mars took
the wheel to deliver us all into haaardcore land.  Everybody moving with
the relentless beats.  Others sprawled out, talking, cuddling, drinking
water.  Many Berkeley folks in the house.  Jon Santos closed it out with
fast deep chemical-sounding techno.

We were drenched with sweat on the dancefloor, flying high off that natural
drug, endorphins.  So fun!!  The only downside was that a dance circle
emerged on the teeny-tiny dance floor.  About six huge guys flinging
themselves around and taking up as much space as possible.  Yes, they were
good dancers (hmmph!  I've seen better, though), but DAMN!  Whatever
happened to RESPECT for others?!

I obstinately decided to "claim my space."  My usual naive response to
injustice is to confront the perpetrator, expecting shame and contriteness
once they realize their transgression.  I kept my dancing spot, even as it
progressively became the middle of the circle, and others who had been
dancing around me were pushed into huddled masses along the walls.  Instead
of having my space respected, I was pummeled in the side by a huge muscled
arm and a flying foot came down hard on my bare ankle, taking skin off.  I
was effectively bullied into submission, and abandoned my space to dance
off of the floor.

I actually like circle dancing in the middle of a huge arena.  That's where
the best dancers are, and they tear it up!!  But MAD is a small, gentle,
little place, that people come to TO DANCE.  :(

Aside from that, an incredible evening!  Several times I looked around the
crowd, wondering if any anonymous emailers danced around me.  I'm going
back next week --  hopefully meet up with some of you!!

Til next time, N.

OK, here's an idea:
have a guy standing there at the entrance of the party by the door guy-
and everytime he sees a person w/ an instrument, he takes them aside and has
them show their stuff.
        If he/she is in time, let them on through!
        If not - confiscate the instrument til the person leaves.

i dunno bout all that.  call me "repressed" or whaddevah, but i just like
the way ppl look in really dope gear, mebbe slightly revealing like all the
half shirts that show off cute lil tummies, etc, than i do the way they
look in the buff.  just a personal opinion.  IMHO, most ppl don't have
really beautiful bodies and they look cuter in clothes...besides i think
it's a lot of fun to be basically swimming in excess fabric while you
dance, and i like a baseball cap to play with while dancing too...

does this happen for real in sf???  people chant shit like "pump, pump,
pump it up"??? oh man....yikes.  *cringe*  hmph.  i do *love* it when ppl
scream spontaneously tho, and it seems to spread around to a lot of other
peeps who scream as well.  especially at those dingy-ass dirty grungy
warehouse detroit-style parties.  yum.

far as the whistle thing goes, i don't hear whistles that often so they
don't bother me that much.  if they are done in a manner which compliments
the musik, i'm all for it.  :)  there's this guy tc in detroit that has a
really weird whistle, it sounds all tweaked like if roland made a tb303
that hung around your neck ;)  anyway....we had to wait in 20 degrees for
an hour and a half to get in to jak-olantern in october and he was near the
front of the line and started blowing his whistle, in the manner he always
does which i can't explain except by emulating it wif my mouf.  the whole
line started cheering and jumping.  that was pretty bomb IMO.  well i've
rambled enough....

love, luck, and lollipops,

hello all-

i, the resident rebellious catholic of the list, must take issue with a
statement of michael's-

>IMHO, most ppl don't have
>really beautiful bodies and they look cuter in clothes...besides i think
>it's a lot of fun to be basically swimming in excess fabric while you
>dance, and i like a baseball cap to play with while dancing too...

i believe that every person has a beautiful body.  one of the best things
about this weekend at tahoe was the wide range of shapes, sizes, colors, and
textures of the bodies that i saw while in the hottub.  there were people
whom mainstream society would consider beautiful, people who would be
considered average, and people who would be considered large.  and you know
what i found out?  THEY WERE ALL  BEAUTIFUL, BECAUSE THEY WERE HUMAN AND
WERE SHARING THEIR ENERGY WITHOUT THE BARRIER OF CLOTHING IN THE WAY!  i
don't choose to buy into the notion that some people are beautiful and some
people are not.  i believe that that notion has been drilled into our
collective heads far too many times by far too many advertisements.
everyone is beautiful when they're naked.

michael, if you choose to keep your clothes on, more power to ya'.  i get a
little offended when some people who choose to reveal their bodies, their
flesh, their physical selves are considered more or less beautiful than others.

peace, love, and nakedness-

matt l.

hello all-

i seem to be in a responding mood tonight, so here goes another one on this
thread discussion the merits of a dj-centered or a people centered rave
experience.  i need to respond to lee's statement-

>So much of the music we rave to, from acid house to trance
>is crafted to guide us toward a transcendental experience.
>For me, the self-indulgent performer (for whom the music just
>ain't enough) does little more than work to de-evolve us back 
>into the protoplasm and goo from which we sprang.  This is great
>for our inner child/infant that craves to wallow in its own spew, 
>but it's mostly a primordial drag for the psychonaut seeking 
>to soar amongst the cosmos.


lee, i believe we've gotten into this conversation before in response to a
proposed drumming circle that i suggested about 6 months ago.  different
people rave different ways.  when i go to a party, i'm not being guided
toward a transcendental experience.  i'm there to exist and to enjoy myself.
drumming helps me do that.  whistles help some other people do that.
dancing naked (cf other thread) helps some others do that.  this scene, for
me, exists to help as many people be happy with their lives as possible.  if
my drumming offends you, come to me and tell me, and i'll gladly go to
another location where i won't bother you.  i hope that other people will do
that, also.  just like you prefer a certain experience to help you get to
where you want to be, so do other people, and we need to respect how they
wan't to get there, however different it might be from our own way.

dance on-

peace, love, and respect-

assorted thoughts:

about whistles: I vote for their continued presence in our scene, but 
  would advise people to practice their timing at home to a mix tape
  before tooting away at top volume at a party. Basically, if you can 
  whistle, go for it; if you can't, practice some more.  One time I 
  was at an outdoor party, wearing a whistle round my neck, and some
  random guy asked me if he could borrow it for a bit.  Sure, I said,
  and I handed it to him, and he proceeded to tweet-tweet-tweet away
  --actually, more like TWEEEEET TWWETtweet TWWEEEEET...tweeeeeet, 
  tweeet, tweet.  TWEEET TWEEET TWEEEEEEEEET, etc.  Not even close to
  complementing the DJ's music. I felt kind of bad, because he was
  obviously having fun, but everyone around him had these pained expressions
  on their faces, so I had to ask for it back.  Then on the other hand,
  there are people out there like Dave Bayer and Alex M. who can 
  really whistle.  So, I guess I'd just tell everyone to practice.  That
  sounds kind of dorky and unspontaneous I suppose, but at least it won't
  result in that many people getting annoyed.

As for drum circles, I love them. I wish every rave had three rooms,
listed here in personal order of priority: dance room w/ DJ's, ambient room,
and drum room with percussion, sticks, whistles, bells, chimes, etc.
How cool would that be?!

hope to see you all at Light on Thursday!

best,
Timothy

Subject: HELP!! (non-rave technical www question)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I just got on earthlink network about 3 weeks ago and I was just wondering
if anyone out there could help me with a few problems (not only does
earthlink have an average 1.5 hour hold time for tech support, but they are
total jerks.)  
        I cant get sounds or movies to play on the web. I understand that
they are compressed files, but how do I decompress them? Aw, geez- How do I
play 'em? I have both a mac (7200/90) at my studio and a PC (386/33) at
home, both are running Netscape navigator and neither are working right.
The tech guy at earthlink said I need PK-ZIP (for PC), but he wouldn't tell
me what to do with it other than to (I paraphrase) shove it somewhere. And I
havent even had the time to wait on hold for 1.5 - 2 hrs to get support for
the mac.
        If someone can help me, I would be deeply in debt.
Thanks - Courtney.
PS- earthlink couldn't even spell my name right.
Oh, I know this is a rave forum, so let me let you know that my mac is
primarily used for sequencing house music!!!!
As far as the current discussion on nudity, clothes were forced upon us for
2 reasons: tempurature and conservative society. Moonpup can DJ naked
whenever he wants.

you know the last new years eve all the clocks in the world were adjusted
by 1 second. 
 
and I have a theory that if you missed it, you and your offspring (and
their offspring.....and so on and so on.....) would be doomed to be off by
a half a beat forever (or until the next time we adjust the world clocks by
1 second -i think thats about every 300 years or so)

I've been on alt.rave for as long as I have been on sfraves, and for the 
past month there have been these two assholes from my own school, of all 
places, that post nothing but filth and ignorant garbage.  I am really 
glad that ravers in general do not stereotype people, for I would not 
want to be put in the same category as these two ("Oh, so you are a 
sac state person.  So then did YOU get laid at your last rave?")
I am just **REALLY** glad they don't know about this mailing list, and so 
what if that is discrimination. I don't want such trash here on sfraves.

love,
Amy

"The Spiral Dance" by Starhawk.
"This is the time of spring's return: the joyful time, the seed time, when
life bursts forth from the earth and the chains of winter are broken.
Light and dark are equal; it is a time of balance, when all the elements
within us must be brought into a new harmony."  Have a beautiful day, see
you all soon!

Excellent point, Nancy!  If people just want to watch a performance, they
should go to a concert.  That's what I do.  Going to a "show" and going to
a rave are very different, in my experience, in that at a rave, there's
much more interaction, whereas at a concert, about the only audience
participation is their noise-making to show appreciation.

[ to sfraves list ]

 It's been a great week for me musically so far. I went to see 
Love and Rockets in Palo Alto on Sunday ( great show! ) , and 
saw Patti Smith last night at the Warfield ( another great 
show! ). So I'm feeling very positive about the celebration
of Spring at the Berkeley Marina this afternoon/evening. I've
arrange my work week just so that I could attend this one!

 I will be wearing my sun/moon tshirt , and I will be bringing
bananas and peppermint candy. Recent posts have mentioned 
bringing drums , so maybe I'll bring my claves and conga bells
too. I just hope folks are patient with me , as I'm not an 
expert percussionist! 

 I promise not to bring a whistle.

Jake wanted to know where to find hats.....

I find all my best hats in thrift stores and vintage stores, Jake.... and at the
flea market....  though sometimes I do admit to paying retail for some phat
creation....  try that store on 15th and Valencia that has the pink "thrift
store" sign with furniture downstairs and clothes upstairs...

but then again, i wear women's vintage hats primarily, so shopping might be
easier -- though often men's hats too -- I have a cool black bowler that I
haven't even worn yet though I've had it for months...

Any hat is great if, when I put it on, my eyes get wide and I think to myself
"is this a little MUCH?"  -- then I know it's gonna be fun to wear!

Let's make Sunday's Sunset Hat Day!! I'll put on my wedding cake hat for the
occasion -- actually Sunday's my friend Jim's birthday, so I think it will be my
birthday cake hat that day!

See you all there!  Leslie   #] ; )

There are many ways to share the infinite frequencies of energy that
exist within us.  Just because we may not resonate with someone who's
doing it differently doesn't mean that it isn't happening.  Alas,
it is my own shortcoming that I cannot fully empathize with the joy 
of a whistler, just as I am unable to completely savor the unbridled
enthusiasm of a dancer who repeatedly smashes my face with hir elbows.
Fortunately, coexistence is not a problem because I can usually
find a space that caters to the kind of energy exchange that seems
more harmonious to me.

Sorry to chop that up so much, but I think I know what you're getting at.
As someone who's been making music most of his life, I agree that there
are few feelings that can compare with the live creation of music,
*especially* jamming along with drum machines, sequencers, etc.  The
programmed backdrop becomes a foundation you can synergize with by
bringing to it a part of life, a part of the Now within you, through an 
act of creation that forms a larger Whole that would otherwise not exist. 
You become lost in it as the sense of self dissolves into a greater force
signified by the dissolution of the boundary between you and the Universe
Beyond.

But as wonderful as this is *experientially*, when I record it and
respond to it as a listener it very often sounds like crap, and I 
wouldn't expect anyone else hearing it to be able to share my bliss 
of making it.  Now if we were all jamming together, like in the shared
experience of a drum circle, that's something else.

Ultimately, all of us coming together to do what feels right is what
makes the party, and it would never make me feel right to tell you
what to do or not do.  I can only tell you how I feel.  The most 
disturbing thing for me about whistles comes from something you mentioned
in a previous post; about people who actually yank the whistle out of 
your mouth.  Violence at raves is something that thankfully very rarely
happens and is probably never justifiable.  That someone whistling
could provoke people into acts of physical aggression at a rave bothers
me more than the shrill screeching of the whistle itself.

In a strangely perverse way, I find myself now curious to hear a small
sampling of what your whistling sounds like.

Take Care,
Lee

        Awwww i like gettin' nasty ;) Don't worry though, i'm 6' and 135
lbs and have no ass whatsoever, just legs attatched to my back. Y'see, with
our social conditioning about beauty the 'happy medium' appears in like 5%

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  What's being referred to in this
thread is physical beauty, which is entirely subjective.  So naturally,
everyone will have a different perspective on it.  Inner beauty is another
thing entirely, and applies to many more people than physical beauty does.
Remember, dear friends, that the way you look has nothing to do with the
kind of person you are, though unfortunately some people are made to feel
superior or inferior in some way because of appearance.  I have a big nose,
big ears, crooked teeth, and inverted arches, and am too thin due to
undernourishment, but I focus my attention more on my inner self than on my
outer self, and my inner self shines so brightly that other people usually
focus their attention on it, rather than how I look, too!

Peace to all you beautiful people!

     Hey, Hey ...How's everybody in SF!
     
     I'd like to extend my hand from all the way across the country, 
     Washington D.C.
     
     My name is Erik and I've just joined your list in an effort to get to 
     know about all I want to know about whatever before I move out there 
     in May.  And so far, the more I read the more I get excited!
     
     I already notice a great vibe...a different vibe than D.C.  I can't 
     say much this soon.  But already I sense a strong community and a bit 
     more of a mature attitude than that of the dcraves list.  To me, it's 
     all about the music!  ...not the party --That's secondary.
     
     I know that's simple.  But a lot of people seem to miss that one over 
     here. 
     
     I like the vibe and the perspective that I'm receiving over the wire, 
     so far.  And whatever that is, I already feel drawn to it.
     
                        And soon I'll be joinin' it!
     
     One small problem, though....
     I still don't have a place to stay.  So if anyone knows anyone w/in a 
     50 mile radius of the bay area who is looking for a roommate...
     let me know.  'Cause starting May...
     
                No Job + No Abode = No stay in D.C.
     
     Just in case, I'm taking a trip to REI to buy me a tent! 
     
     Thank You ALL!

Remember, Yoda said, "Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter."

What is beautiful and what isn't beautiful....one of the greatest 
prejudices on Earth.  Modern day conventional image definitions of 
beauty (especially with regards to women) ultimately are meant for one thing 
only, to control people by making 98% of the human race 
who do not look like today's conventional image of beauty, feel ugly 
about themselves, oh that and to sell products.

My favorite fairy tale as a young girl and to this day is
'Beauty & the Beast', I always fell in love with the beast, but then I am 
not from this planet...I would do well aboard DS9, Voyager, the 
Enterprise, or B5....

Hey Sarah, dancing is indeed a cure for cramps, as is any form of 
upright strenuous exercise, i.e. I studied the martial arts for seven 
years and that always worked, but sometimes it was a bitch to just get 
my ass on those days to the dojo...  reference the above 'upright' I 
believe this works best when the entire body is pumpin'  --Mau

okay, let me straighten something out here.  i hardly think that one's
physical beauty has anything to do with whether they are a beautiful person
or not.  someone can be beautiful on the physical tip and be an asshole, by
the same token someone can be a beautiful *person*, but i still don't want
to see 'em nekkid.

i think everyone is beautiful in their own way.
i just don't want their bare ass waggin' in front of me at a party.

my 2 cents...

love, luck, and lollipops,

i think the best thing to realize about any sort of noisemaker is if it's
done reasonably, it can add to teh vibe.  if not, it may detract.  but as
someone pointed out, you can always move...

drum circles, i think, are best left to themselves.  maybe in the ambient
room or at a multiple day outdoor event far away from the main sound
system, etc.  out of time drumming can be annoying...and with the acoustics
of warehouses, etc, and the delay, it's nigh impossible to drum
accurately...but i guess if you can, you can.  kewl.

btw i'm envious of all y'all already having outdoor parties (i *love*
outdoor parties!!!)...it took me a half an hour to get my car started and
the snow cleared off of it this morning...first day of spring indeed
*grumble*

love, luck, and lollipops,

I speak for myself ofcourse, but I have not liked it when I've been dj'ing
ambient at a party, and a drum circle is started in the ambient space.  Alot
of ambient has rhythm, but not necessarily drums...and the drummers I've
encountered, don't try to follow the rhythm of the music....If they did, I
might be into it since I drum myself.

And on that "drums with electronic music" note....when I put live drums in
my electronic music, I often run them through delay that is matched up with
the timing of the music, and it sounds really good to me.

I'm really glad to know that you all percieve inner beauty as much much 
more important than physical beauty....Cause I shore do feel UUUUUUUGLY 
after a hard night of sweating and dancing.  All my make-up melts off, my 
hair is a mop, my skin is ashen and blotchy (if I have indulged) and my 
clothes are grungy. BLECK!! I used to trip off it real bad, when I was 
more self conscious.  Now I just avoid mirrors in the morning. :)

love,
Amy

Subject: "The L.P. Tri-Tone Samba Whistle"
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Here's a compromise: 
At musical instrument stores everywhere -
In the percussion and/or accessories dept. there is a whistle called the
"tri-tone samba whistle" by Latin Percussion.
It's fairly cheap (about 10-12 bucks), its pretty, and it plays three tones
(and they are all in tune!). I'm giving out this vital info for all of you
who have to whistle at raves (I understand), but this whistle sure beats the
hell out of a coach's whistle, which is meant solely to give a signal. The
samba whistle is an actual musical instrument.  I draw a picture of this
whistle but my ASCII art sucks (but the whistle looks sort of like a brass
cross).  I used to be a whistle blower myself until I went to this rave
called Sharon a long time ago and there were so many whistles that you truly
couldn't even hear the DJ...
(my friends are going to kill me for leaving this message...)

Spinnin' in the buff causes, you know, less restriction on the blood vessels
and cappilarries, and, you know, allows that chi to move more, well, FREELY,
and, well, causes more creativity, yeah!.

I'm very sorry that happened, and I'm sorry I didn't notice it.

If anyone ever has any sort of problem at Mad, please let me, Ethan, Alex,
or Jon know about it and we'll take care of it ASAP. If you don't know any
of us, it's a good bet that one of us will be at the door, so just let that
person know what's up and we'll take care of the situation. We're commited
to making the club as enjoyable as possible for all.

 Get across the bay and get on HW 80 North. Take the University exit,
and take the right hand road that goes under University. You will have
to drive in a big right hand turn ( a couple of blocks ) , with the
goal of getting onto University going west towards the bay. 

 Once on University west , drive over HW 80 towards the bay. At the end of
the road , turn right and drive to the corner and around it . Find
parking where you can. Walk towards the beats ( not the beatniks ).

        Well, sounds like you're pretty beautiful :) I would say that
often, the way you look (as in active perception) _does_ make you who you
are. Akk, that's so wannabe zen i don't even know if i can figure out what
i just said. :/
        here's to lookin' good,
                brad

I've left the attached message off to save bandwidth...this is in regards to 
the vote for/against allowing an white-power newsgroup on board....I was just 
curious what the general opinion of our supposedly *enlightened* group is on 
this matter, considering that acceptance and free speech seem to be preached 
here on a regular basis, with respect to raves....does this apply to Nazis 
too?  
 
Myself, I believe, to paraphrase Chomsky, supporting free speech means giving 
a voice to the opinion you despise........

Christina,

Calm down!  They have First Amendmant rights just like us.  Anyone who 
doesn't like what they have to say can keep out of their newsgroup.  The 
Neo-Natzie folks are already on the Web.  If they are given thier own 
newsgroup then none of us will have to wade through their postings in 
the other groups!

Its a great idea for those creeps to have their OWN group!

There was actually a rave I went to in LA where there was a room with some
congas, a guitar, a bass, and some other percussion things.  Their owners
were using them for most of the time, but for about the last 1/4 of the
party they just let anyone use them.  Pretty cool idea, IMHO.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>TRIBAL FUTURE<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

 Hey everybody, it's time to formally let the cat out of the bag (or the 
ravers out of the city)and announce our plans for another Mendocino
Mountian Jam on the 1st of June.  We will have pre-sale tickets on sale 
at Ameba by April 1, we will be working together with Greenpeace on this 
one as the first of a series of "GreenHouse" parties. 
  Folks who came up last October will remember what an awesome spot we 
have , it's sure to be in rare form this June. The full moon falls right 
on Saturday night, the organic gardens will be in bloom , people 
percolating in the wood fired hot tubs....... 
  So start planning your campout now, people who want to be early birds 
can show up for camping as early as Friday ,May 31. This party will kick 
well into Sunday night . We'll be posting line up and extra goodies 
shortly. If anyone has questions or wants to be involved e-mail Mark at 
Ameba or call us at 750-9368. 

                        THANKS Y'ALL ...HAPPY CAMPING !!!!!!!

I hope that fat ass comment was a joke, and if not, you need to get a clue.
I've seen Moonpup DJ in the buff and I was only 
inspired to dance harder.

I might be making the big leap to the crowed, smog infested land down south
soon.  I know there is an LA Rave mailing list, but I do not know how to find
it. Can someone help me out??

Thanxs!!

I *still* go to raves looking like a dirt-head rocker (cause I am one).  I
don't think it's made any difference, but I can't be sure--nothing to
compare with.  Maybe next time I'll try to borrow my sister's blue-spangled
vinyl top and see what people say...

Wow, you're right!  I was hasty in my reaction to that voting thing.
Everyone has the freedom to say or express anything.  It's only when
something is acted on in a way that infringes on someone's rights that the
line is crossed.   Well, I don't think I can change my vote :(

Say what you will,

	But it's still basically about raving and having fun, hopefully. :)

check out the hyperreal (http://www.hyperreal.com) list of regional
sights... it's called SoCalRaves and it's right there next to SFRaves on
the page.

This is simply a chain-letter variation. DAMN there are a lot of 
chain-mail crap going around lately. No disrespect, but think for one 
minute about what you are posting before you spread this garbage. From a 
technological standpoint and from a manpower perspective the below is not 
feasible. Also a good clue is when you get a message saying 'pass this on 
to XXX number of people.'

Question?

Where is DJ BUCK?  A friend told me that he's returned from England and will be 
spinning now and then.  From what I understand he did a Spundae a few weeks back 
but other than that I have yet to see any dates that mention his name.  Please  
make a mental note and post something here if anybody gets wind of any future 
dates. Oh yeah, I asked a certain female DJ at a local record store, who will 
remain nameless, about his whereabouts and her reply was "I'm sick of everybody 
asking me!"  Well SORRY! 

You see for all of you who may ask, what it was like back in the day?  Well for 
me it was DJ BUCK who took me to the other side for the first time ('90).  And 
you know what they say about your first.  

Oh yeah and to keep it relevant like.. yes, there were lots of whistles & no, I 
don't think anybody was naked.

Thanks

s post.  But did I hear someone dissing whistles?
 Christ, what next? "Those floppy hats are just too damn tall, I can't see
the D.J., they're blocking peoples view of my buffont hair-do."  O.K., O.K.,
I wont bring my whistle, if you bring two more goodies to contribute to the
energy of the party. 
PARTICIPATION not SPECTATION.
 Get off the wall, get your ass on the dance floor and make some phukin

I assumed this mail was just someone trying to get somebody else
mailbombed and perhaps into trouble with his sys. admins.

At camping stores everywhere:
In the survival dept. there is a whistle without a ball. They are 
survival whistles with multiple pitches. 
They arefairly cheap (about 4-5 bucks), its flourscent orange and so you can be
spotted from far away when you fall off a ledge while eating lunch without 
being tied in (silly rock climber, you should know better than to fall 
and have your brains go spat on the ground cuz you didn't stay tied in) 
or I guess so you can find it if you drop it at a party...

  Hmmm....  this seems to be another nonsensical chain email
  designed to inflate the ego the originator (not Uncle Noah or his
  dad we presume), especially since the alleged phone tapping is
  blatantly illegal and, mostly likely, quite expensive to execute
  on such a grand scale as proposed.

well, I'm sorry to have posted that phone thing.  Didn't mean to get so

Weird day on the internet....

Yesterday, when I saw moonpup's post about spinning in his b.d. suit, I replied
(to the whole group).....

     Hey moonpup, I thought you promised to spin for us in drag.  That's
what I wanna see..  will you do it before you go to Europe?  

the header on the message was "Re: Nudity and ?????"

then this morning I come to work, sign on and .... here's a message from ... the
BIGGEST and most important client at my company right now, not known for a sense
of humor.... and it says (dum da dum dum) ...  "interesting message, Leslie, but
I have no idea what it means!)

Yikes, who needs the feds to monitor us when we can create indiscrete havoc all
on our own just by hitting the wrong address on our address list?    I swear to
be more cautious in the future!

Anyway, I promise you'll never see me out dancing naked with a whistle in my
mouth!  On my way to Berkeley to catch the last of the light!  Happy spring!

Leslie  : )

Absolutely. Give them a form to speak, so we can all see what they are 
about. Let them proclaim their ignorant, racist, genocidial views to the 
whole world so we can know them for what they truly are. The only way to 
deal with hate is to look it straight in the face.

Only a lover can get a zinger like that to penetrate; only someone we 
love can make us consider whether such an absurd statement might even 
be true.

That person may have much sway and influence over you, but it is safe 
to say this person does not have the authority on this planet to 
judge such a thing.  We, the jury, find you, the defendant, not 
guilty.

	to all....

	would anyone like to recommend some software for putting music 
	together?  sources would most likely be off of CD samplers and 
	maybe an occaisionally midi component and maybe dat when i can afford 
	one.. although i am just beginning, i wouldn't want anything 
	lame. i've heard that cakewalk pro studio is a good go..  
	the system i currently have: p5/100 w/32Mb ram. the sound card 
	is a miro connect34 wave which is hooked up to my stereo system 
	for real bass. any advice for better inputs instead a puny "in" and 
	"out"? i haven't got an a/v hdd yet, but this is in the works...
	
	thanks in advance!


	cheers,

Hi, everyone!  Went to the joyous, beautiful, happy, munchy Light today!!
And what can I say but SPRING IS HERE, Sunsets are starting up again, and
the feeling was in the air today at the Marina.  We've come full circle
again, it's time to emerge from the darkness of winter and celebrate
together out in the light of the coming spring and summer...

The feeling for me today was "begin again", and total joy.  Grassy hills of
the Marina dotted with many colorful beings, speaker stacks booming, the
sky turning its shades of pink and purple, the bay deepening into electric
blues...  Dogs cavorting, ravers hugging, baby toddling, people lining the
ridge at the top of the hill looked like they were dancing in the sky.
Many familiar faces made me realize how many friends I have made since the
quiet (for me) Sunsets of last year.   More faces were unfamiliar, but as I
looked out over probably 200 people, all there for the same reason as I
was, I felt the connection.

Thank you Gateway!  And see all of you Sunday! -- Nancy

I just gotta say, there is nothing like wearing your favorite clothes. Be it
a Rush T shirt, a Black Sabbath T-shirt, or a blue-spangled vinyl top or a
brown vinyl jacket designed for the $2.99 buffet.

Do a nice, long leg stretch before and after you dance.  Sit on the floor
with your legs out in front of you, flat on the floor and grab your toes.
Hold for about 20 seconds. Ahhhh.....

if you haven't gotten your phone list yet, please send me a message asking

sorry for anyone who's been without a number of a new friend for a few days

This my first message to this group.  I have to agree with Cortney that 
the best way to get them would be to simply log on and see what they are 
doing.  A group of teenagers did that with an aryan bbs and tricked them 
into giving them information such as people they were targeting,etc.  The 
only problem is what we do to them could be done to us.

Subject: Okay, I feel a little goofy
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hi everybody,

It's me, volt, again.  I must first say that I haven't really been to a rave
thingie before, and I don't know if tonite counts (I was at Light at the
marina).  But anyways, I was just wondering, was that a typical gathering?
I had a good time, despite the fact I could scarcely get my friend to come
and dance as well, but I enjoyed sinking into the crowd and just losing
myself somewhere in front of a speaker and buried deep under a relentlessly
pulsating beat.

So anywayz, the reason I feel kinda goofy is that when I was there dancing,
I kinda stayed in my own little thing, kinda not turning around and shying
away from eye contact, and although I know it's probably quite silly to feel
so inhibited among such a spirited and spiritual crowd, I couldn't bring

little getting used to???  I hope that's it, cuz I do want to try it out

Stretch...stretching is the only way to get rid of the toxins which build 
up in the muscles after a strenuous work out...no matter how enjoyable!
P.S. MAD is just sounding better and better...

Just got back a little while ago and can only say paraphrasing someone on 
this list "Berkeley behind us, SF in front of us, the stars above us, and 
peace all around us!!!"  The sunset was beautiful as was everything else 
about this afternoon and evening. BTW, I got an impromptu hug from two 
lovely girls and it really made the day that much nicer :)

I felt a little isolated yesterday as well.  I found light to be a great 
way to start the spring.  It seemed that most of the people were more 
into hanging out than dancing until it started getting dark.  When its 
dark, I start to feel a little more isolated because i can't see anyone 
that well.  I did feel the vibe better when it was dark last night, 
probably because people were dancing closer or at least it seemed  that 
way, and maybe because I liked john howard's set the best.
I know its easier to open up to those around me, when i been dancing with 
them for a few hours.  There are other parties that are more dance 
focussed imo.  Those parties are easier for me to feel less inhibited on 
the dance floor.
Thank you all for that nice start of spring yesterday.  Yesterday felt 
like I was beginning to open up to a great season of outdoor parties as I 
felt the spring vibe blooming.  By sunset sunday I'll be more in full bloom.

:)

Something Special.

I think that anyone who is trying out something new will be rather timid 
about it.  You don't really know what to anticipate and you probably 
don't know very many people (one of the good things about this list - 
meeting new friends!). Once you get more comfortable with the scene,  you 
will loosen up, so no worries. 

Good parties for the weekend?  Well, personally, if Chrysalis isn't 
happening, then I will be attending Something Special.  And of course, 
Sunset on Sunday.  Since there are so many new people on the list now, I 
will post a personal description tomarrow so you all can look for me @ 
Sunset.:)

love,
Amy

I want to thank everyone at Gateweay for putting on such a beautiful afternoon
for us yesterday!  

We got there at twilight, climbed right to the top of the hill where we could
see 360 degrees of twinkling lights around me, stars overhead, Venus shining
upon us, the crescent moon, and the most beautiful music I've heard in a long
time.. it was so perfect for the moment, I'll never forget it.  I actually saw
two shooting stars (hope I get my wishes!)

People were dancing everywhere, from the beautiful altar with candles and
flowers to the tops of the hills, total happiness!

Am I correct that it was Jon Howard spinning around sunset?  And then Galen?
Can someone post the lineup for me?

Thank you all for an amazing beginning of spring!

Leslie  : )

Hey, Goofy-feeling one!

        You should seriously consider going to Sunset!  It will be my first
one, but I've been to many other raves.  As far as typical goes, the common
denominators are usually:
Darkened indoor venues
Black lights and fluorescent painted tapestries
Cool lights, maybe some lasers
Hella phatt-to-the-max beats
Happy, smiling, loving, hugging, clapping, whistling, shouting ravers

You can go up to just about anyone, introduce yourself, share a handshake
and/or hug, and embrace this wonderful family, as they embrace you, into
each other's hearts.
        Did I get this right, people?  That's been my experience, anyway!

spectacular, outstanding Spring Equinox event, which caused everyone there
to fully blossom into beautiful rainbow roses and flutter on radiant
butterfly wings :):):)  Like Cernnunos the stag-god, who symbolizes among
other things rebirth and renewal, we were all made new and refreshed.
        I can't wait for Sunset.  It'll be my first ever!  Show me what
it's all about, dear friends :)

I totally agree with you Eric!!  I hadn't been to a party in awhile and
have been dying to hear some crazy cool sets.  I don't tend to worry about
whether or not I'm going to make new friends, I go with how I'm feeling
whether its dancing in my own space or seeing someone I'd like to introduce
myself to and doing so.  Its about feeling comfortable with yourself!  One
thing though its hard to boogy when its dark and you can't see the
chugholes so I understand about not making eye contact!  See you at Sunset!

What the original poster proposed was not monitoring.
 
What if some self-righteous ass decided that ravers were just a bunch of 
drug-using and dealing miscreants who had no respect for property 
rights(tresspass) and decided they would come on to S.F. Raves, that den 
of inequity, and "screw them all up?" 

There is a little document called the Constitution that seemingly means less 
and less as time goes on. Study it. 

Going onto someone elses newsgroup with the intent of "screwing them up" 
makes you little better than they are. 

Also you will find that the Internet as a whole is not very tolerant of 
censorship of materials posted in their appropriate place, and many 
owners and operators of Internet-connected system, myself included, would 
not hesitate to boot you for this kind of childish crap.

don't forget that there are LOTS of people who consider ravers
  to be as destructive to society as ANY racists.....

this mailing list's freedom of speech could ergo be in jeopardy for
  the exact same misguided reasons as those which would condemn the
    far-right-wingers.....

Cruz) uses cakewalk and says it's the shit. I know he carves some pretty 
phat bbeats with it!! =) I do want something as good at least.

Thanx in advance.

This is my first post to the list. Looking forward to becoming friends with
all you groovy people!

I've just moved to the Bay Area and am looking for a first rave to go to
this Saturday. Can someone give me details re Chrysalis (if it's happening)
or Something Special (if it's not)? Is anyone going to Dune?

Thanks,

Tony

Attention bass junkies!

        In my constant quest to be hip, down, or whatever, I'd like to know
what slang is common, what it means, and where it comes from.
        I suppose saying something is "the bomb" is a good thing, like
saying it's "phat."  I'm interested in all such terms, not just so I can
use them and sound hip, but so I'll understand everyone else :)

Thanks!

	Why would anyone feel the need to make such a promise? And never 
is a LONG time... A single experience can dissolve the fear/prejudices of 
the human body. So what exactly is wrong with running around naked?

Hi,
The funding for this was voted down in Congress a couple of months ago. It
was supposed to be a random tap on 1 out of every 100 calls, not 1 in 10,
the 1 in 10 was a misprint in the AP newsservice.

Argument, discussion, and disagreement, etc are not unconstitutional.
Preventing any group from assembling and discussing their views is.
That's why I'm not voting on the white-power rock newsgroup.
Furthermore, since this group is open to everybody, "screwing them up"
could be as simple as having a majority of nay-sayers step in and
trample all over their shoddy thinking, false logic, and lies. This is
different than having to listen to Joeseph Goebbels over a megaphone
(because we all have equally loud megaphones) or having a dangerous
non-interactive web site that spreads lies (which I've posted about in
the past, with requests to e-mail-bomb and hack their site).

Note however, that "hate words" and "incitement to riot" are illegal,
though scant case history in these areas exists to make the application
of the law clear. If the white power groups are using these forms of
communications, then perhaps it might be worthwhile to press charges on
those grounds. <<Sound of can of worms opening>>...

I'm personally waiting for those fucks to go on-line, so I can flame
them (not with "hate words" or "incitement to riot") but rather with
idiot-baiting argument and discourse. Since they have guns and are
psychotically stupid, one would be wise to do it via an anonymous
remailer...

Also note that the arguments that "white power" is not a subcategory of
"alt.rock" (or whatever) are false, since there's plenty of
"white-power" oriented metal, hardcore, oi, and "punk rock" (RIP).
Please note that a lot of this white power oriented music has strong
appeal to the god-squad -- I posit we'll see a strong fascist/christian
movement appear during the next recession, lead by folks like Pat
Buchanan and his neo-nazi/christian buddies like David Duke, Tom
Metzger, etc. (Tom Metzger, incidentally, is one of the leading
organizers and promoters of "white power" music --  even Hitler knew
the power of mass spectacle, music, and rhythm to hypnotize and
brainwash the minds of "followers" (that is, people too stupid and too
unalalytical to think for themselves)).

I personally want to hear what everybody has to say. If it annoys me
I'll change the channel or not read the newsgroup.

PS: More conspiratorially, it is possible that this whole call for
votes thing is simply a case study perpetrated by the FBI -- to see how
powerful and far-reaching the internet can be in terms of getting
people to rally for (or against) a morally, ethically, and racially
divisive cause. Then they'll apply the internet clampdown as
appropriate in preparation for the times when they're called to enforce
fascism....

Hi all,

	After sending a few messages to the list, I realized I hadn't
introduced myself to the group... not wanting to break any traditional
rules of this 'oh so cool group' :) ... here I go. 

	I am Michael Albers, and was born on March 13 1971, in
Amsterdam (the Netherlands), I moved to the US (california) 6 years ago.
Why you ask? Well, I felt I had to escape the pattern
I was falling into there, so thought I'd go ahead and attend school here,
and now... before it hit me, I'm graduating from San Jose State (finally!).

	Before I moved to the US, I went to some raves in Amsterdam, 
but weren't that great. I am absolutely thrilled and very
fascinated with the 'phat' parties I've been to here, I love every minute
of it... the music.. the people.. the peace.. the love.. ... too groovy
for words.

	Well, won't make this too long, but at least wanted to introduce
myself... next time your at a party, look for a tall 6'4", Brown haired,
blue eyed Dutch dude going completely bonkers on the tunes.. :)

	Keep the peace and love flowing ... I love this group! :)

Peace and hugz,

Michael

Reminds me of a Scorpions lyric:
Oh, no - don't make no promises
Oh, no - your body can't keep

I think it's a good idea to avoid making a promise whenever possible.
That's because if I make a promise, I'll do whatever I can to fulfill it.
A promise should be the same as giving your highest word on something, and
since we can't predict enough of the future, it's iffy to make the kind of
promise Leslie made (no disrespect to you, Leslie!).

Ever the rocker - I promise!

  Niels:

  I really hope that neither you, nor anyone else from SFRaves, goes into
that list with the idea of badgering them or treating them like loathsome
insects. They are human beings too, and have come to their positions
through some experience in their lives that drove them to adopt the
position they have. 
  Practically speaking, I hope that you don't do this because of the old 
adage:
     "Don't ever get into a pissing match with a skunk."   :<)

  On a higher level, why not adopt a rave attitude: accept who they are 
(not what they believe in) and dance with them. Show them your good 
moves, and the reasons why harmony feels better than dissonance. I 
guarantee that if you dump all over them, you'll only harden them in 
their racism. Be kind, try to find a wedge of agreement -- 
African-American contributions to American music = a good start, and work 
from there.
  All this assumes that you would like to help them out, and not just 
scream at them, or bait them and treat them with disrespect.
  Just my thoughts.

Light was a beautiful gathering, so much diversity and love.  Being 
outdoors and in the daylight for your first dance party 
can be a little distracting.  At indoor parties the enclosed dance floor 
is more conducive to making that spiritual connection with the 
people around you.  Lasers, projection screens, candles, ambient rooms, 
are nice additions to the experience.  
I tottaly understand what you said about being unable to connect with 
the vibe.   Feeling awkward on the dance floor pretty much describes the 
majority of my experiences at raves. (I tend to wobble and move too 
fast)  It's especially hard when your friends are rooted and you have to 
venture  out on your own.  The best thing to do IMHO is dance, dance hard 
and dance often. and don't forget to smile.  Everyone  gets into the 
groove sooner or later.


Love harmony and positivity

I have no problem with this. Absolutely, 100%. When someone says "let's go 
screw with them" however, I generally do not take this is as "let's go 
engage in debate."

The entire Usenet is based on categorization and sub-categorization, so 
this argument doesn't float. There is a lot of metal, hard-core, and punk 
that is *not* white-power oriented, so lumping them all together does 
everyone a disservice.

No, the request for votes is a tradition for additions to Usenet. The 
only reason this one got so much press was because of the controversial 
nature of the subject matter. I wonder where everyone was when they were 
taking votes on alt.binaries.pedophilia.....

Living in the Netherlands (Utrecht) myself I was kinda curious what 
makes the SF-vibe that different from the one in Amsterdam/the Nether-
lands. Could you elaborate on that? I'm sure ravers in San Francisco 
want to hear what makes them special too.  


By the way, seeing everyone introducing themselves,... 
...
My name is Bart Meijerink (27-12-72). At the moment I study Urban
Planning in Amsterdam and live in Utrecht. I dj now for about six years  
(I'm not famous or anything though). At the moment I'm organising parties 
(200-300 pp) in Utrecht at a place called Ekko, as well as dj-ing there. 
I became interested in housemusic in '88/'89 when I heard tunes like 'Voodoo 
Ray' by a Guy called Gerald and 'Bounce your body to the box' by Kevin 
Saunderson. I'm mostly into Detroit-techno (especially by Robert Hood/
Jeff Mills) and acid, but I also like some of the harder stuff as well as 
the more cluboriented music (people over here call it 'mellow', dunno why) 
as well as some jungle. I also make music myself (on my own as well as with 
friends).
Around the time I got my internetaccount I read about this list 
somewhere and became interested. I'm on the list for about 3 months now, but 
have rarely posted anyting. Due to the lack of time I don't read all e-mails, 
but I enjoy the ones that I do read.
Oh yeah, I'm heading for Prague in a few weeks together with bands 'the 
Human Beings (dv8)', 'Acid Junkies (djax-up)' and 'Human in Paradize (music man)' 
(betcha have never heard of them). That will be fun.

I hope I'll get a chance to visit SF in the future to taste some of that 
sfrave flavour.

Bye!
(by the way, did you know 'gabber' is a Dutch word?)

The reason the kids went on-line with the group to begin with is the 
aryan group was compiling an dress list of gay mn and lesbian in their 
rea which they could bash. The boys simply asked for tht information by 
logging on so as to warn the people.  I am not against the group being on 
the internet; that is their right.  I am also worried tht if we rely on a 
government agency to monitor the internet, we ll will lose our rights to 
free speech in this medium. Ravers are feared by the government as any 
other non-mainstream group.  It is up to us to make sure we know what is 
going on for hell, let's face it, groups such as the one we are talking 
about 
aare dangerous.  I stopped going to a lot of punk shows in new york 
because of violence caused by skinheads. Luckily I found raving. . 

Anyway, I hope to see people at Sunset and making a show that we all are 
not members of any the groups we have been discussing

Hey,

I am aactually glad you felt goofy, for the experiance should be one 
that challenges the blocks in your consciousness that have built up.  
Don't worry, you will get used to it!! And continue to go becuse from 
here you only have experiances and friendships to gain!!

Hell, as long as everyone is introducing themselves, guess I will, too:

My name is Tony Mizukami. I'm new to the Bay Area, having just moved here
from Japan, where I've been living for the past 3+ years. I'm originally
from Atlanta. There is no real rave scene in either place (as far as I
could tell!), but I've felt strangely attracted to it ever since first
hearing about it several years ago. I've been lurking on sfraves for a few
days now, and from what I've seen everyone seems to be really groovy. I'm
looking forward to meeting you all.

BTW, I'm not Japanese (I took the name "Mizukami" from my wife), so if you
were to look for me, oh, I don't know, say at Something Special and/or
Sunset, then I'd be a 5'8", 28 y.o. caucasian male, blue eyes, short brown
hair, glasses, looking lost 'cuz I don't know anybody yet! I'm a bit of a
shy one, so please come up and introduce yourself.

See 'ya then,

-Tony  (^_^)

Here's another one that I just got the info for.  Again, the number that
used to be on the calendar is not very good for passing info because I
only check that number for messages once or twice a week.  It's also hard
to transcribe info from voice messages.

Subject: Hate and the White-Power newsgroup
X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 1.4>
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I've seen quite a bit going around lately about this white-power newsgroup.  
Here's my take on it:

1. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech.  I'm not telling anyone 
anything they haven't heard before with that statement.  My contribution to 
this old line is: the First Amendment is a nice beginning.  One thing that I 
don't think should be protected is Hate.  Period.  And to that end I think 
that someone, somewhere, should draft a new amendment to the constitution 
that qualifies the freedoms under the First Amendment to not include, 
specifically, Hate.

2. Given the current status of the Constitution and it's Amendments, I think 
they absolutely should have a forum in which to express themselves.  This 
will make it easier to identify them and add their names to my Anti-Hate 
page.  This is something John S. Lee and I chatted briefly about a couple of 
weeks ago.  I'm going to donate the disk space and web domain for a page 
dedicated solely to exposing people who indulge in Hate propoganda and/or 
are members of Hate-oriented or supporting organizations and political 
groups.  This white-power forum will save me a lot of time and trouble 
finding individuals that fall into that category and getting quotes from 
them.  I'll simply monitor their forum, along with other forums, pull quotes 
from their own writings, and post them along with their identities if 
possible, their e-mail addresses at the least.  I intend to hold them up, 
sans the white hoods, for all the world to see.  I hope to keep this 
coverage objective, allowing others to formulate their own opinions.

Also, as part of this Anti-Hate page, I want to begin some kind of 
discussion on a legal definition of what constitutes Hate so that this may 
be available to interested legislators.  And I want to recognize and support 
all Anti-Hate organizations, carrying web links, phone numbers, addresses, 
etc., for those groups.

I think the major difference between this and mail-bombing/hacking their 
news forum is, I'd be darned proud if they put an alert against me on their 
page.  I doubt they'll feel the same if I do that to them.  They'd have to 
be a little more creative -- and illegal -- than simply fight fire with fire 
to strike back at me.

One last thing: I highly respect the views of the people on this list.  I 
would invite any input on how the Anti-Hate page should look and what it 
should include.  I hope to have a first draft of it up and available some 
time over the weekend.  It will be overly simple at first, I'm sure, but 
with everyone's help, it will grow.

Subject: Obtaining the groove! (GARTH VISION)

Fellow groovers...

    I am in need of a flavor...

          The deliverer of which shall go down in history,

                        and receive the everlasting posi-vibe...
My story... 

There was this tape...not just any tape... but a special tape. You know, 
one of those tapes that you can let autoreverse over and over and over 
and it sounds better each time.  Well, this tape belonged to a very good 
friend of mine and I *borrowed* it from his car one night >;)   I 
grooved to it for quite some time, embracing the high energy and awesome 
saxophone licks. A few months later I was on my way to a halloween party 
in the Santa Cruz mountains and brought the tape with me to listen to in 
the car we were going up in.  Well, when we got there, I forgot to get 
the tape from the girl driving (not a direct friend of mine) and when I 
tried retrieve my grooves, I found out that she had moved to 
NEW MEXICO!!! No address, no phone, no nothing.  

I have tried to locate this tape since then and nobody has it. It is 
fairly old (probably '93/'94ish) and was part of the VISION set of 
tapes. (I think there were 5 or so DJ's that had tapes made from that 
party but I'm not sure...)

It is called "DJ GARTH: VISION"

Anyway, If anyone has a copy of this tape, I will gladly pay 20$ for a 
copy of it. Or, just some info on how to get it would be greatly 
appreciated.

                        Thank you all for caring....
May you all find that missing track/tape/CD you've been searching for 
and gave up on...

        Jah!

Although I disagree with neo-nazis, this (the net) is a 
public forum. Free speech is more important than rabid opinions.

Basically, nobody forces anyone to forward _any_ newsgroup anyway...
Thank God, it's a free country. Gives the feds an easy way to keep tabs 
on them too..

I don't think most net people like neo-nazis.. so their 
newsgroup will probably be unpopular.. But it has a right to exist.
That makes me a little sick too, but I have to say it.

Some people probably have strong feelings about ravers.. Would you want them 
to have the power to remove alt.rave from the net?

The net.cops already are out of control..

Just my opinion.

	I wonder if hate is illegalized, if it will follow the road of 
our parties and move a bit more underground where the stock pile of 
weapons and random murder increases?
	Making something illegal does not squash it (look at us, legal or 
illegal party, is that a consideration when you choose which you are 
going to?) and more importantly, it never addresses the root of the 
problem, which happens to be fear (at least in my opinion). How can you 
make fear illegal? You cannot sit down with someone and say,"you will not 
fear me taking your jobs away or the purity of your race because I am not 
going to take YOUR jobs away, and I am not making your race impure". I 
don't what else they preach, but by passing a law, you are not going to 
address these issues and before you can get rid of hate, you have to 
address them. Otherwise, you are going to push them into the shadows to 
mull over and over how they are being "repressed" and when they do act, 
it will be from the stand point of a corner or caged animal trying to 
free itself (in a much more hostile way).
	So how you go about addressing these issues? I don't know yet...

For those who thought that Pack-a-bowl was a strange concept...there's
an interesting article in this week's Newsweek about something called
"Cosmic Bowling" (I think).  It describes techno, fog, uv-lights, and
glow in the dark bowling balls and pins.  Apparently hundreds of
bowling alleys across the country are changing over to this new
format.  Although the r-word was never used, there was the
unmistakable influence...

Well, you're wrong. Like it or not, for better, and sometimes for worse, 
much of what this country was founded on was hate. Hatred of religious 
persecution, hatred of a monarchy, and hatred of the dearth of rights 
possesed by the colonists(which admittedly makes the treatment of the 
native peoples and minorities all the more puzzling,) all helped lead to 
the founding of this country.  

Hate, like unconditional love, can be healthy. It can also be one of the 
most destructive forces in the universe. It is all a matter of 
application, direction and motive. Have you ever in your life seen an 
injustice, and been so incensed that you were moved to speak out, or 
take action to help correct the injustice? 

You cannot simply legislate hate away. It is the equivalant of sticking 
your head in your nether regions.

While I totally support this, and am sure I will visit your site, by 
your own words you demonstrate that you are *not* objective. You, like the 
groups and individuals you hope to expose, have an agenda.

The first thing I would propose is that you not call yourself an 
Anti-Hate group. From your words, you aren't. You don't plan on "loving" 
these hate groups away, do you?

Here are a few suggestions for inclusions(apologies for possible spelling

Dear lee,

Good Question, I guess it depends on how you define a raver.  Once, 
because I had not gone to many raves, i would not identify myself as a 
raver because I did not feel i could claim the label legitimately. My 
 boyfriend, however, stated he felt that was a stupid choice becausw he 
felt what values you held defined whether you were a raver or not: a 
raver he argued understands the importance of consciousness, diversity, 
and holds mother earth in the ultimate respect (his point being how could 
you otherwise achieve transcendence outside dancing if you do not 
appreciate what you are seeing)!  Whether a neo-nazi could be a raver or 
not depends on whether you wish to make a value judgement on what rave 
is.  My impulse would be that they're not, just partiers, if they happen 
to attend the events because they don't hold the value of respect for a 
value of rave that I deem essential : the value of 
diversity at the parties and the variety of experiances that comes out of 
a melee of cool and different people sharing the music.  But as long as 
they did not hurt people or caused trouble I guess it would not be in the 
spirit to bar them from attending an event.  I don't know......What are your 
thoughts?

Dont be anonymous, just ask for a valid reason for why they do what they
do. I bet they cant come up with a decent answer, and it'll just make them
look worse and weaker.

Why, I remember back in the 70's some people said "get down" and some

I use to go to to a place in Livermore(E.Bay) near my home town that had

for the lanes, of course, and they had colored pins (no glow-in-the-dark
stuff though).  A great time was had by all - boogie n' bowlin' the night
away...till some dumb-ass wanna-be gangbangers shot someone, out in front
one night(over a bowling match and a girl).  They closed it down shortly

Was there a great amount of love felt for King George and the British? 
Don't think so. 'Righteous indignation' and  'hate' can both be used to 
adequately describe what was going on.

*Your* compassion, *your* moral integrity. My moral integrity allows me 
to hate things that are wrong. Something being wrong does not make it 
inheriently evil. You are correct, reconciling these ideas is difficult.

don't bank on it.

i honestly don't see why the government would fear us.  someone said this
awhile ago, and i think they pretty much hit the nail on the head:  most
ravers care about how good the party was on saturday, how fucked up they
got on saturday, who was at the party on saturday....and where are they
going this saturday?  who is gonna be there?  how frucked up are we gonna
get?  etc etc, and that's pretty much it.

i don't really see how any of us could inspire fear into anyone, especially
the u.s. government.

Y'know, a *lot* of people are turned off by all "the PLUR".  The real
strength and magic of raving is not PLUR, it's what happens when we 
allow the MUSIC to take us to a higher place.  PLUR separated from
a tangible source can start to feel contrived, especially amongst
diverse people who don't really have that much in common.  It's our
love and connection with certain kinds of music that unites us and gives
us the means to harmonize our minds and bodies with each other.  I 
sometimes feel that people who are into the rave scene mainly for the 
PLUR actually weaken it in the long run if they don't participate in 
activity that truly creates it - namely, dancing your ass with
everyone around you.

Does anyone out there know of a good, RELIABLE internet service provider
that has local access in San Jose?  I've been on earthlink and the just
plain suck, they got too big for their own good.  If any of you have been
following my problem, (re: customer service being jerks and all) well, now
when I call, the line just disconnects on me when I am on hold!!! Not to
mention the fact that their main menu no longer offers a tech support option
even though they brag that they are open 24hrs (its there, they just dont
want you to know about it). They also dont respond to my e-mail, etc... (but
they are probably reading this right now) 
I'm looking for just standard stuff: e-mail, www, and ability to create my
own web site, and a nice price is nice... 
Thanks to all that can help...I wanna stop asking annoying questions like
these and start enjoying the net!!! :(

I wouldn't say that hate was the motivation for the above.  I'd say it was
a feeling of persecution, or righteous indignation.

Compassion dictates that we love our enemies.  Moral integrity demands that
we hate only that which is evil.  It's difficult to reconcile these ideas.

Sounds like there is no "answer," except to leave "them" alone as long as
they leave "us" alone.  Adopt a vigilant, defensive posture, but provoke
nothing.

That's my two francs.

> Good Question, I guess it depends on how you define a raver.

Yep, and to open an even bigger can of worms, it depends on how
people define themselves.  I.e. I may call myself a "raver", but
that is not ever *just* what I am.

I hold the view that if someone is at a rave, and is having a
transcendental experience (i.e. leaving behind ego, connecting with
the group vibe, etc.) then they are raving.

I'd like to think that there is a universally seductive appeal to
the experience of the values you have described, and that if a Neo-Nazi
went to a rave just to party and started having a good time...

To argue with a Neo-Nazi is a waste of time.  At best, you win,
make them feel stupid and make them hate you more.  On the other
hand, tell them that you respect their feelings as something real and
genuine.  But show them something better; love that rivals the
comradary of their fellow hate-mongers, adrenaline rushes more
intense than an act of violence, a light show more dazzling than
a burning cross...

Perhaps a Neo-Nazi, like any of us, will not be able to shed all
their shit just because they rave.  But if they become ravers on
the dance floor it would be the first step towards loosening the grip
ignorance holds over them.  I think this is possible.

Hey everyone!
	Here is the updated list I mentioned last week. There are a few 
duplicate names that were on the list last time, but these were the 
ones we still could not find. Again, any help will be greatly 
appreciated. Thank you so much. See everyone at Eclipse in April! (all 
three of us will be there!)
=)

Even though I am new to the list, I have been on the fringes of rave for a
few years, thanks to my son (and friend).  Here's my story - the short form:

My name is Paul Keen - been doing music for decades, mostly big band, shows,
movies and stuff like that.  I guess I am proof that rave has no age limits
either way - I'm nearly 50 - so you can add creaking bones to the list of
noisemakers.

After following everyone's action from the list for the last week or so, you
all have reminded me that rave is not a music form, but a state of mind.
 Maybe in this election year the only important question to ask the
candidates is "do you rave?"  After all, it's awfully hard to dance out there
with a nuke in your pocket.

If there is any question about rave's legitimacy, I found out about the
website from the "Official Netscape Navigator 2.0 Book" in Chapter 11 - "Our
Favorite Net Resources."  Does this mean you are all mainstream now?
(Shudder).

Please help me with a perplexing problem - I have not heard from DJ
CHRISTOPHE for over a year.  I pray he hasn't gone to the big party in the
sky - but maybe is seeing the world - this time without the help of the Navy.
 If anyone has any info, please give me a shout.  It will calm my nerves a
whole bunch.

You've been a lot of fun to follow.  Hope you don't mind if I stick around a
little while.

I guess you dont pay much attention to this list-ya we all have different
reasons for going out, but there are still many of us who are somewhat
politically aware!!
*Any* government(corporation) fears *any* group of people who are
organized(even if only on weekends) and regulary disregard"laws" they see
as hippocritical and wastefull, Any government also hates any group that
even try's to be multiracial, pluralistic and outside commercialy allowed
constraints,b/c  as always change comes from *outside* the mainstream,
otherwise it would'nt be change!! and those in power be definition*hate*
change!  
We ARE feared, but maybee not for long i.e. Ive been seeing some fliers
lately(space children) that are blatent addvertisments for record labels
and even Virgin,a HUGE  multinational corporation, thats NOT a rave but a
10 hr. commercial!!-fuck that! But thats a whole diff. topic

first off, i did *not* say *all* ravers.  just a shockingly large amount,
which at many times includes me, so i'm hardly in a position to judge
*any*one.

>*Any* government(corporation) fears *any* group of people who are

the u.s. government is above their own laws.  the u.s. government can
basically do what it wants.  thus, it would take a *lot* to inspire fear
into them.  even if they had adequate reason to fear, who knows if they
would?  when you see yourself as the most powerful organization in the
world, you tend to get a bit arrogant.  at least, i would imagine....

hate, perhaps.  keep in mind that HATE and FEAR do not always go hand in hand.

Well, Me and the man like Jerecho made the drive from Davis up to the 
north end of Sac to check out a new party to the area, Diversity.
The virtual flyer said trance and jungle, and being a junglist myself, I 
had to go check it out. Jungle in Sacramento? I thought I was the only one...
After a somewhat roundabout drive we finally got to the Boardwalk, which 
as far as I know is one of Sac's long running rock band -type bars. As we 
got out of the car we were greeted by lots of bass coming through the wall.
Cover was $5, a little steep for my taste, but considering the people who 
were running it was worth the investment to help out our scene. I was 
greeted at the door by  Flash and Mia, two long-time Sac scenesters. I 
also met DJ Wizrd, one of the promoters and he was really friendly. Also 
me Chris, fellow SFRaver, another great guy, sorry I didn't get a chanve 
to chat with him more.
On the decks was Dj Adrian. Later on I found out that it was the frist 
time he had played breakbeats out to a crowd, but I never would have 
known. This kid was smooth. When we got there we was playing sme wacked 
out breakbeat, around 140 bpm but with heavy basslines, almost jungle-y. 
A few records later I started to recognize some old drum 'n bass tunes 
from '93 but they sounded really slow. We were trying to figure what 
exactly he was playing, if this kid was on some new breakbeat style, 
slower than jungle but with the same production style, when Adrian 
dropped "Let it Roll" by DJ Crystl. I know the song well,and we finally 
figured out that he was pitching all his his jungle records down to the 
older hardcore tempos. But as his set progressed it sped up. He played s 
variety of jungle, mostly older Moving Shadow-type tracks (Lord of the Null 
Lines) to some more recent releases (Lemon D, Solo & Aura). It was  great 
to hear some jungle up here. The samll crowd didn't seem to totally get 
it though, but after a bit more exposure and some more people, it should 
get jumping like the Top on Saturdays.
After Adrian Flash came on. He played one jungle song to pay homage to 
the junglists and then switched to more of a house/trance type set. I had 
to leave midway because I'm still in finals week, but Flash was doing a 
good job while I was there.
The crowd was sadly rather sparse, but for a  first night in Sac I would 
have been amazed if it was packed. With a bit more promotion and some 
more word-of-mouth it could grow to decent proportions. Even if things do 
not end up succesful at that venue, the promoters should find some 
success in the future. Their goals seem to be motivated only be love for 
the music and their growing scene. I saw not one bit of attitude from any 
of them and they actually seemed happy to chat about things.
They said they plan to try to throw another in two weeks. If you live in 
or near Sac I highly recommend going. Sac has a small scene, very young, 
but it can definately grow. There are a lot of enthusiastic people ready 
to make things happen. Lets do it!

	Whether or not they fear the average "raver" is one thing, but a 
culture which tends to head toward the break of free of capitalistic 
normals (before I am sorely corrected on this, I will have to limit my 
statement - While some people are moving away from the capitalist based 
culture, most of us are moving away from a culture from which the govt 
can draw its funds) is something they mostly will attempt to stomp out 
whether it is from fear or from greed or in "defense" of good America. If 
our govt cannot pull money off of people gathering, why should they let 
us gather (Oh, forget about that silly constitution thing, this is now 
damnit)? And there is really no reason that we shouldn't pay the 
gathering tax you know, it is public land after all - just thnk of the 
money the govt could make if they sold all the corner parks to the 
highest bidder... Anyway, my sarcastic point is that they will attempt to 
stop any subcultures which try to break the economic bonds we are held in

I'm getting really excited about the weekend.  Harmony was the last party 
I attended well over a month ago, and even there I never got to dance 
much (remember my bitch session?!?).
So I am all set too go to Something Special.  Joe Rice and Ethan are the 
only dj's in the line up that I have heard before, so I am excited about 
earing the others.

Okay, I think I have my attire figured out for the weekend so that those 
of you who are new to the list can keep a look out for me and say hello!

I'm 5'6" with long brown hair and bangs & brown eyes.  Saturday night 
I'll be wearing a sleeveless white funky shirt with lime green trim & 
jeans.  @ Sunset I'll have on a sleeveless blue sorta 
striped button up shirt & jeans.  Both times I'll have on my sfraves and 
nw-raves laminates. :):)

Looking forward to meeting those whom I haven't yet and seeing all those 
I do know. ;)

love,
Amy

Feel free to copy and/or retransmit....

>From San Francisco...

Take the 5 South all the way past Bakersfield.  When you get to the town of
Gorman (fill your tank in Gorman cause there aren't many places for petrol
until Victorville), you will exit and travel EAST on HWY 138.  After about
5 miles you will veer right and head south-east on HWY N2 (that's right...
N-2).

After about 50 miles on N-2 you will pass thru the town of Palmdale where
N-2 magically becomes HWY 138 again.

Continue east on 138 for 36 miles when 138 magically becomes HWY 18 (to
Victorville).  Stay on HWY 18 for 23 miles when you will hit I-15.

Take I-15 SOUTH (Toward L.A.) for 3 (three) miles and exit BEAR VALLEY RD.
and drive due east for 13 miles where you will hit HWY 18 again (It's magic
I tell you... or we're "folding space").  Continue east on HWY18 for
another 11 miles where you will hit HWY 247.  DO NOT GO RIGHT TO THE 18
SOUTH...

You will go straight thru the highway 247 Junction and continue heading
east on 247.  You will drive approximately 13 miles further east when you
will need to slow down and look to your left (north) for the upaved
BESSEMER MINE ROAD.  There will be a sign reading -JOHNSON VALLEY O.H.V.
AREA- where you turn in to the left.

SET YOUR ODOMETER...Drive north on Bessemer (any car can make this unpaved
road) for 5.5 miles and look to your left (West) where you will see a LARGE
naural rock amphitheater.  Drive toward the rocks and PLEASE PARK ON THE
NORTH EAST SIDE OF THE ROCKS... BEHIND THE ROCKS.


Quick Notes-

-The DUNE crew will start loading in the sound and lights at about 4pm on
Saturday (if you beat us there then go exploring the desert for a while BUT
SAVE SOME ENERGY).

-Dinner music will start at around 9pm.

-Lots of folks are coming out and having cook-out dinner there at the site.

-The closest semblance of civilization is in Lucern Valley about 20-30
minutes west of the site.

-Park Rangers will be there to "observe" this thing called "desert raving"
and will empty any Nitrous tanks they see... so PLEASE don't even bring
nitrous.






FYI-HERE'S THE INFO THAT ALL THE LAers ARE GETTING TODAY.

DUNE will begin precisely at 11pm..
        11-1am  Kc
        1-3     Lee

        9-noon  Wildcard Guest sets
        Admission is $5 per person with half of the money going to the
Bureau of Land Management federal fund.  By entering the area, you  agree
that you enter at your own risk and that you will act responsibly.
        Please read everything carefully and remember to bring the
following for you and new friends:

blankets, lawn chairs, water, candy, hugs, flags, sunscreen, sunglasses,
tents, sleeping bags, good vibes, kites, drums, fruit, smiles, change of
clothes, etc.
 -Water and candy will be available at our concession booth-

        Please caravan and carpool BUT PLEASE DON'T draw attention to
yourself in any of the little towns that you drive thru on the way to the
site... it will only make law enforcement officials upset.  Along these
same lines, National Park Rangers -the law in the desert- will be coming to
witness our peaceful gathering... DO NOT bring anything as obvious as
Nitrous to this event... they WILL enforce the law.
        The drive is 1.5 to 2 hours from LA so grab some friends and
mixtapes and fill your fuel tank.   Any car can make the roads.

Well, in Holland especially the large gabber raves are usually attended by
working class kids and soccer hooligans who would fit the description of
being skinheads quite well and many of them do not think too friendly
about the coloured people living in their country. They're right-wing,
not very clever and into hardcore 250 bpm gabber, raving all night and
taking whatever dope they can get their hands on.

I guess that answers your question.

That would be me I guess, thinking it was a strange (not bad!) idea.
Actually, I went there yesterday night with a friend of mine and had
a great time. Although I guess it didn't really fit my definition of
a rave, the music kicked ass, the people were nice and enjoying themselves
and we had a lot of fun trying to get the bowling ball to go in the right
direction. Perhaps glow-in-the-dark balls would be handy in that resepct.
So, I eat my words and will spread the word in Europe.

Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of the tape that you're looking for.  But,
you brought to mind a beloved tape that I am missing . . . Jeno's Bang the
Drum.  Perhaps someone on this list could tell me where I can find another one?
 Perhaps Ameba does mail order?  Let me know, please.  I really miss that tape
alot!!!!

Speaking of tapes and distribution, why don't we put together a web site for
DJ's where they can sell their tapes?  Perhaps Ameba or a similar store would
like this capability added to their existing site?  That way, people all over
can get ahold of those missing tapes.  Also, DJs would be able to get their
mixes out to a wider audience and thereby increase thier popularity.  This way
a dj could easily go to another state and still draw a major crowd.  Perhaps we
should do a web site for DJs?  I can implement this if anyone is interested.
 Lemme know.  Any ideas are most appreciated.

warmly

Kinda hard to pronounce "PLURQ", tho! (PLURK? PLUR-QUE?)  I would like to
see "PLUR" or whatever widen beyond the maillist to become a motto of the
entire scene...found on fliers, banners at parties, etc.

True values underlie the scene but sometimes I think just the people on
this beautiful list know that...at your average major party I only hear
about who's spinning or how fucked-up some-one is...:(

Well, as far as drug terms go, the following was forgotten:

tweaker	  someone on speed 

And we can't forget all of the ones refering to the event itself:

renegade, space, event, party, etc. etc.

And what about:

chill, as in cool, i think!

I have a friend that did a linguistic study of drug culture; where the 
words came from, how they had invaded minstream vernacular, and what they 
meant.  It was very interesting, and this slang thing reminded me of that!

Ameba has on their web page a complete list of all their mixtapes 
(www.ameba.com) plus a description of the music & price. 

The Friends & Family homepage (I forget that address) has a page where 
the F&F dj's list their mixtapes, description & price.  You can order it 
directly from the web. (I think).

Hope this helps a little. :)

I just read Amy's post and thought it would be a good idea to introduce myself!

I'm Carol Saldana originally from Sacramento and just moved last month to
the Bay Area and became very lucky and got a great job with an internet
publishing co. in Sausalito.  I've been raving since early 92' and have
done everything from the big 'Sharon' and 'WhoopieBall' parties to the
lovely 'Friends and Family' 'Gathering' and 'Sunset' parties.  Its been
interesting going on about 5 years of this great past time and like
everyone else, I'm looking forward to another great spring/summer of
terrific parties and gatherings.

I've had my highs and lows over the past few years and throughout my
struggles I always found that I had solidarity in raving.  I can remember
when I went through stages of thinking I was to old for 'it' any more (I'm
27 will be 28 this June) but I'd somehow I meet someone new and would
instantly remember how special raving truly is.  I met that special someone
back at Burning Man last year and we met up again at a 'Friends and Family'
party last October.  We've been together ever since!

Well, I'm looking forward to Somethin Special on Sat.  I'll most likely be
wearing my psychadelic long vestdress and my "Friends and Family" laminates
with my hair up in a high ponytail.  If you recognize me say hi!

Love to all
and have a great weekend!!!


P.S. Glad I subscribed!

Not a skirt kinda chic Eric.  Nice idea.... although late in the morn I 
always find myself sprawled out on a blanket.  It's also so dirty at the

I'm sorry to hear you both take that stand.  I would like to refer to BA's 
statement about sticking your head ... tell ya what, how about we change 
that to "in the sand"?  Anyway, by leaving them alone, you risk doing 
nothing, and this is a problem where doing nothing has proved completely

Let me make one statement that should address most of your arguments, and 
then I'll try to do a point-by-point.  John Lee's a little better at this 
than I am, but bear with me.

You can't illegalize Hate any more than you can illegalize Fear, and I guess 
I assumed I wouldn't have to make that specific point.  What you can 
illegalize is institutionalized Hate.  Right now we only have laws against 
discrimination, but you can spout any hate-related propoganda you wish.  I 
would like to direct something against that propoganda and the people and 
organizations that propagate it.  And I'd love to go into detail about how 
such a law would be worded, but that's partly why I'm creating this Web 
page, so that the People can decide for themselves what they would prefer to 
see in the way of legislation.

>	I wonder if hate is illegalized, if it will follow the road of 
>our parties and move a bit more underground where the stock pile of 
>weapons and random murder increases?
>	Making something illegal does not squash it (look at us, legal or 
>illegal party, is that a consideration when you choose which you are 
>going to?)

Y'know, folks like to draw some kind of connection between the freedom to 
print Hate-based propaganda and the existance of the rave culture.  I myself 
see no connection whatsoever.  Stockpiling of weapons and random murder are 
already illegal, and one might say underground, activities.  Raves 
themselves are not illegal and I have a hard time believing they ever will 
be.  Some of the activities that go on there may be illegal, but that's a 
separate issue.

> and more importantly, it never addresses the root of the 
>problem, which happens to be fear (at least in my opinion)

In my opinion it's ignorance, but your point is well taken.  What it does 
address is the effects of ignorance and fear.  There's no law that says that 
people have to be sane -- hell, I think we're all crazy up to a point -- but 
crazy people shoot up malls and office buildings all the time.  It's the 
murder and mayhem that's illegal.

>Otherwise, you are going to push them into the shadows to 
>mull over and over how they are being "repressed" and when they do act, 
>it will be from the stand point of a corner or caged animal trying to 
>free itself (in a much more hostile way).

How does one break a given cycle?  I won't go into a lot of text here on 
that, since we're all aware of negative cycles and how they're broken.  In 
this case, I'm looking to break a cycle of Hate.  Ignorance and (baseless) 
fear are jobs for the educational system.  What I dream of doing is having 
people stop using lies to teach others to hate and fear people around them 
simply because they are different.

I don't see how.  Reread my statement, then reread yours.  You didn't 
address anything I said there.  This country was not founded on Hate.  Hate 
may have been present during it's growth, but it was not founded on it and 
you will find no basis for your argument in the Constitution or any other 
founding documents.

That's not Hate, it's injustice and anger at injustice.  

>Hate, like unconditional love, can be healthy. 

No it cannot.  By definition, hate is a negative emotion.  Well-directed 
anger may be what you're referring to, but I'm referring to Hate in it's 
purest and most evil form, hate for hate's sake only with no other basis.

>Have you ever in your life seen an

Of course, many times, and I was never motivated by hate in doing so, I was 
motivated to do what was right.

>your head in your nether regions. 

(heavy sarcasm on)
Well, that statement certainly aided this argument.
(sarcasm off)
I am not so ignorant that I think Hate can be legislated away.  I am not so 
stupid, either, to think it's effects cannot be legislated against and 
severely curbed.

You're correct.  I do have an agenda, and that's exposure of their agenda.  
On the other hand, I'll make no statements regarding the quotes I post 
there.  I'll let the reader make his or her own decision on whether the 
statement warrants a response.

Well, I see your point but I'm lukewarm on any other name.  No, I'm not 
going to go over and give each and every person mentioned on the list a big 
hug and a sloppy smooch, but I will hold them up to public exposure.  When 
their private lives suddenly become their public lives, they may reconsider 
how strongly they feel about taking the stands they do.  I'm sure Buchanan 
has had plenty of reason in the past couple of months to regret statements 
he's made regarding race, sex, and religion during his life.  No, this page 
would be 100% against Hate crime and organizations.

On the other hand, if anyone has a better suggestion, please, feel free...

Thank you!  I was beginning to wonder if you'd offer anything positive in 
this post at all :)  Yes, you have a good point, and I guess I should have 
included this in my original post.  I don't want to limit this new page to 
any one specific group.  I'd like to think that the people that contribute 
to this new page will help in exposing ALL Hate-motivated groups.

Black Adder, I'm sure you have much more to say, but if we're going to 
discuss politics ad nauseam, let's not post this thread to the whole list, 
ok?  I'm interested in what you have to say, I'm just not sure everyone 
wants to watch us spar over political definitions and minutae.  I hope I've 
shown the general direction I'd like to go with this, and I hope you'll be a 
part of the effort to shape it.

Re: Raver Dictionaire

"Hella" is a specific Northern California slang term that is completely 
NON-EXISTENT and unheard of in Southern Cal. and other parts.  IMO this 
should not be included; teknically not a 'raver' word. Before living here, I 
had never heard of this term.  It is close to "totally" however.

>From San Francisco...

Take the 5 South all the way past Bakersfield.  When you get to the town of
Gorman (fill your tank in Gorman cause there aren't many places for petrol
until Victorville), you will exit and travel EAST on HWY 138.  After about
5 miles you will veer right and head south-east on HWY N2 (that's right...
N-2).

After about 50 miles on N-2 you will pass thru the town of Palmdale where
N-2 magically becomes HWY 138 again.

Continue east on 138 for 36 miles when 138 magically becomes HWY 18 (to
Victorville).  Stay on HWY 18 for 23 miles when you will hit I-15.

Take I-15 SOUTH (Toward L.A.) for 3 (three) miles and exit BEAR VALLEY RD.
and drive due east for 13 miles where you will hit HWY 18 again (It's magic
I tell you... or we're "folding space").  Continue east on HWY18 for
another 11 miles where you will hit HWY 247.  DO NOT GO RIGHT TO THE 18
SOUTH...

You will go straight thru the highway 247 Junction and continue heading
east on 247.  You will drive approximately 13 miles further east when you
will need to slow down and look to your left (north) for the upaved
BESSEMER MINE ROAD.  There will be a sign reading -JOHNSON VALLEY O.H.V.
AREA- where you turn in to the left.

SET YOUR ODOMETER...Drive north on Bessemer (any car can make this unpaved

naural rock amphitheater.  Drive toward the rocks and PLEASE PARK ON THE
NORTH EAST SIDE OF THE ROCKS... BEHIND THE ROCKS.


Quick Notes-

-The DUNE crew will start loading in the sound and lights at about 4pm on
Saturday (if you beat us there then go exploring the desert for a while BUT
SAVE SOME ENERGY).

-Dinner music will start at around 9pm.

-Lots of folks are coming out and having cook-out dinner there at the site.

-The closest semblance of civilization is in Lucern Valley about 20-30
minutes west of the site.

-Park Rangers will be there to "observe" this thing called "desert raving"
and will empty any Nitrous tanks they see... so PLEASE don't even bring
nitrous.






FYI-HERE'S THE INFO THAT ALL THE LAers ARE GETTING TOMORROW.

DUNE will begin precisely at 11pm..

Everybody!   Where are you all going to be this week-end?!  I want to go to
Something Special but my only rave friends remaining in  Berkeley (everyone
else took off for spring break) are set on Aborigine...

I guess that leaves Sunset!!  Unlike Amy, I don't know what I'm going to be
wearing (now that's an organized woman!! ;> ).  I'm 5'5", have long dark
hair.  I possess no laminate :( .  Look for Addidas jacket or zip-up
sweatshirt... damn, I've just described half the people there!!  I'll have
pink barrettes that say "Nancy" (unless they fall out, which they like to
do!).  I will bring fruit and maybe freshly-baked cookies (ummm!) and
incense.

I want to meet all of you!!  I hope the sun does not set on this week-end
without a few of us having met...

Have fun whatever you do!  Post where you're going to go!!

Happy Friday, Love, Nancy

Right on.  Congressmen are more afraid of the NRA pulling their funding than 
a bunch of kids getting peaceful and happy, as evidenced by the House 
passing the repeal of the assault weapon ban.

gurping?  around here it's called flaking or clucking (yes, like a chicken).
Flake can also be a noun, but not cluck... :)

Nothing should be done to these people unless they do something illegal. 
They can talk about whatever the hell they want. That is their right 
under the Constitution. I do not support their views, and I would be one 
of the first to speak against their opinions, but they have the right to air 
their views, just as I have the right to say they are full of shit. 

But I have do not support their opinions, nor do I have any interest in what 
they have to say, unless confronted with it. This is not tantamount to 
sticking my head in the sand. I watch, I attempt to keep informed on the 
issues, and most importantly I am willing to protect myself and others 
against those that would deny me my rights(which seem to be shrinking 
daily.)  

And what has been ineffective are all the attempts to legislate hate away.
It doesn't work. I saw Pat Buchanan with a huge number of supporters 
early in the run-offs, and I thought "Damn, are there still that many 
racists in the U.S.?" Of course the numbers speak for themselves. These 
are largely blue-collar workers, who wouldn't voice their race opinions 
in public, but you can see it in their votes. 

Rather than trying to shut these people up, we need to *UNDERSTAND* them. 
I see people on S.F. Raves talking about how everyone should try to 
understand each other. I agree. Try to *UNDERSTAND* what has brought them 
to their views. Expose them...great, what does that get you. You get 
brownie points for exposing a hated hate-group, and if you're lucky, 
maybe you will get their medium of discussion shut down. BUT WHAT GOOD 
DOES THAT DO ANYONE ULTIMATELY???? Do the people that have these views 
simply go away and fade into nothingness? 

Taking a symptomatic approach to these issues is why worthless fucks 
like Buchanan receive the support they do. You are doing nothing to 
change the core issues, the reasons for the hate, but rather just 
pushing it underground.

_____________________


 Ron D. Core received a last-minute fax on March 15th, from the promoters of=
 the
       Rotterdam, Holland Megarave gig that was scheduled for March 16th,
1996. The fax from
       Rige Entertainment BV, addressed to Lenny Dee, Ron D. Core, Don
Demon, Reign and
       Mickey B, who were also booked, stated that the Mayor of the City of
Rotterdam feared
       that the rave may attract "a major group of 'Fascists'", and
subsequently revoked Rige's
       permission for the highly anticipated rave.

       Apparently some raves in that country and much of Europe, especially
raves of a more
       hardcore/gabber nature, attract a large number of "fascists", more
commonly known here
       in the U.S. as skinheads. Rige said that they are attempting to sue
the City of Rotterdam
       for retracting their permission for the rave. Rige Entertainment has
also informed Ron D.
       Core that they are also attempting to restage another "megarave" in
the next cumming
       months. Even with this seemingly bad news, Ron D. Core is still
enthusiastic about
       playing his first European gig in the city where much of the music
he plays (gabber)
       originates, and is looking forward to hearing from Rige
Entertainment on his next booking
       date. Stay tuned here for late breaking news and for your curiousity

Yeah, when I went there were only a handfull of ravers there -- not a large

I'll have to disagree here...I now live in Southern California & I hear "hella" 
a lot, esp. around the Ravers I know.   Maybe it's because so many SoCal Ravers 
go to SF to party & they picked up the word!!

Well, there's always the "Why don't we round 'em all up and execute 'em"
idea, but I'm sure that's not the answer.
I totally agree with your point about trying to understand them.  That
would give people a better idea of how to respond to the situation, if and
when a situation occurs.

Nicely done!

Before I leave work, just adding to the list for who/what to look for at Sunset!
I'm planning to wear my big vintage 60's pillbox white and pink hat with big
fake flowers on it -- if you miss this, you ain't lookin' -- and for you shy
people, don't worry, I'm REALLY nice and will introduce you to some other REALLY
nice people....

It's my friend Jim's 26th birthday, so come on over and say h.b. to him please!
Toys and games may be available for all, who knows, maybe even a big cake!

And if you're interested in being part of putting on the SFR BBQ and BEATS
picnic, let me know, several of us volunteer organizers are gonna be there, and
we'd love to know who all is interested!  

Have a wonderful weekend....     Leslie  : )

oh, and thanks to those who reminded me NEVER to say NEVER ... even if it is to
the possibly least likely activity you'd find me engaged in, namely dancing
naked with a whistle in my mouth!...   those who know me are fully aware that I
know WAY better than that -- so many things I said I'd "never" do are totally
part of my life now... and I appreciate being reminded when I slip back into old
habits!!

    Yippie!!!  It's the weekend!!!! :^)
SDreams....I'm definately going to Nikita tonight!  I've only been
to 1015 once, but I had a BLAST!  Saturday, I'm thinking Dune might 
be a pretty religious experience, and of course, Sunset on Sunday...
Who else is going to Nikita tonight?  Have a great time this 
weekend!!

Well,

	I am planning to go to 'Something Special', however I 
am also curious to see 'Aborigine' (Cool line-up)..maybe I'll
do both. :)

	Anyway, check out a tall 6'4" dude, with half-long
brown hair, a AMSTERDAM BULLDOG t-shirt, and my
black/white Airwalks... (and A small Dutch Accent). :)

	Hope to meet y'all.

Everybody!   Where are you all going to be this week-end?!  I want to go to
Something Special but my only rave friends remaining in  Berkeley (everyone
else took off for spring break) are set on Aborigine...

I guess that leaves Sunset!!  Unlike Amy, I don't know what I'm going to be
wearing (now that's an organized woman!! ;> ).  I'm 5'5", have long dark
hair.  I possess no laminate :( .  Look for Addidas jacket or zip-up
sweatshirt... damn, I've just described half the people there!!  I'll have
pink barrettes that say "Nancy" (unless they fall out, which they like to
do!).  I will bring fruit and maybe freshly-baked cookies (ummm!) and
incense.

I want to meet all of you!!  I hope the sun does not set on this week-end
without a few of us having met...

Have fun whatever you do!  Post where you're going to go!!

Happy Friday, Love, Nancy

Hey Bart,

	Coolness! Another Dutch dude on SFraves, any more???!

	When I used to go to the raves in Amsterdam, I was still
a 'rookie'... and even then the scene was a little different I'm sure... (as you can tell haven't been to a Rave overseas in a while!)

	I guess I appreciate the finer things in live now I'm older.. 
:) Also, the people at the raves here are peacefull.... loving... caring
... amazin' and a cozy crowd.  My experiences in Amsterdam were
not as positive 6 years ago.

	C-ya later, Hope this explains it.  (Guess I'll have to go
to a rave next time i'm back in Amsterdam).

Michael

Subject: 	RE: Hi, I'm Michael. 

Living in the Netherlands (Utrecht) myself I was kinda curious what 
makes the SF-vibe that different from the one in Amsterdam/the Nether-
lands. Could you elaborate on that? I'm sure ravers in San Francisco 
want to hear what makes them special too.  


By the way, seeing everyone introducing themselves,... 
...
My name is Bart Meijerink (27-12-72). At the moment I study Urban
Planning in Amsterdam and live in Utrecht. I dj now for about six years  
(I'm not famous or anything though). At the moment I'm organising parties 
(200-300 pp) in Utrecht at a place called Ekko, as well as dj-ing there. 
I became interested in housemusic in '88/'89 when I heard tunes like 'Voodoo 
Ray' by a Guy called Gerald and 'Bounce your body to the box' by Kevin 
Saunderson. I'm mostly into Detroit-techno (especially by Robert Hood/
Jeff Mills) and acid, but I also like some of the harder stuff as well as 
the more cluboriented music (people over here call it 'mellow', dunno why) 
as well as some jungle. I also make music myself (on my own as well as with 
friends).
Around the time I got my internetaccount I read about this list 
somewhere and became interested. I'm on the list for about 3 months now, but 
have rarely posted anyting. Due to the lack of time I don't read all e-mails, 
but I enjoy the ones that I do read.
Oh yeah, I'm heading for Prague in a few weeks together with bands 'the 
Human Beings (dv8)', 'Acid Junkies (djax-up)' and 'Human in Paradize (music man)' 
(betcha have never heard of them). That will be fun.

I hope I'll get a chance to visit SF in the future to taste some of that 
sfrave flavour.

Bye!
(by the way, did you know 'gabber' is a Dutch word?)

Someone was asking about trainspotting, it refers to people in Britain
whose hobby(life?) is writing down numbers of passing trains...  So, a
raver who is more concerned with finding out  the names of the songs
that are being played rather than enjoying the music is called a
trainspotter.

I always disliked the word sketchy, I have found it to be vague and
overused.  I love "hella", use it myself to mystify people in my own
(non-teenage) age group.  Its use seems to cross all youth cultural
lines that I have seen in this area.

Good point.  Many ravers it seems are turned off by all the PLUR..and 
certainly many are not interested in the opening and closing ceremonies 
at some parties.  Last Wednesday during Light, the opening circle 
contained roughly an equal number of people to two other groups of folks 
sitting higher up on the hill....The common ground is the music, the 
dance and the trance it induces...when we are all dancing our asses off, 
the differences dissolve and the walls come down...some permanently, some 
a wee bit, and a wee bit more next time....

As to the loaded question, could a Neo-Nazi also be a raver?  Good chance..
The music we listen to is 'high' energy music, it is often intense, 
deep, penetrating, magical and beautiful. Based on footage I have seen 
via 60minutes and other documentaries, it seems that 
Neo-Nazi's could be into fast pulsing hard trance techno music, as 
as opposed to Mozart. However,they would most likely be moshing to most of 
it...

Remember to experience the visitor from the depths of space...
a new comet.  Follow Ursa Major's (the Big Dipper) handle to the red 
giant type K2 p star 'Arcturus'.  Now visualize Arcturus as the center of a 
clock... then look out from the center between what would be 7 & 8 o'clock.
That's where the comet it tonight.  You can actually see it's tail..ah my 
kingdom for pitch black skies!  Lucky folks out at DUNE...  :) Note:  It 
is a fairly big bright fuzzy dot in the sky...very different from 
everything else in the sky...  

If you are having trouble spotting it, I can point it out for you 
tomorrow night at the Burning Man party, and sunday at Sunset...  

Let there always be light from the stars.....

    If anyone is interested in pooling to Dune? We obtained a 34' motor home
with all the amens. I can say that it will come in handy for the return
voyage. We basically havetaken care of everything as far as the basic
nessesities required to sustain life and all we really ask is that you toss
acouple of coins in the well fer the petrol.
    It turns into a really neat experience when we get strangers together
like this because I have many solid lifelong friendships that we forged in
in Weinabego.

It was great to hear from so many of you wishing me a warm welcome and
helping me find Christophe.   Now, if anyone sees him, tell him he has a very
close friend who would like to hear from him, see him, hug him, hang out (by
the way, that goes for all of you too - you've been great).

Thanks to you, taz for your insight.  We all have our ups and downs, but it
is the power of love and acceptance that ravers are known for that can help
each of us through the valleys (I bet Matt knows that more than ever now).
 Each of us has something unique to offer to the chemistry of the group.  The
world is always better when we're around, becuase it is different.  We all
get pretty bored if everything is always the same.  This may be why so many
of you are finding it more difficult to define a raver than you thought you
would.  We all have common characteristics, but we still are entitled to our
individual identities.  Hence, the variety of dress, from full tux to
Moonpup's georgeous cheeks, and the variety of ways we all like to express
ourselves (some of you think finger cymbals are bad - wait til I show up with
my tuba).

On age - Maureen talked about the 30's and 40's set lying about their age.
 Those over 12 lie about being under 12 (price break).  Those under 21 lie
about being over 21.  By the time you get to 50, there is not much more you
can lie about, and before long you want everyone to know how many years you
cheated the grim reaper.  When's the last time you asked a "senior" to a
party?

Don't let the hate groups get you in a knot.  The one thing we hate about
hate is that it brings out the hate in us.  As some of you have correctly
identified, hate breeds out of fear.  What you don't fear, you don't need to
hate (now pity is another thing).  Just as you have been enlightened, your
mission is to enlighten others.  You can conquer hate - you just have to do
it one Neo-Nazi at a time.

I'm not in your midst, but I'm not far away in Fresno (from the Armenian word
for "furnace").  I look forward to getting up to meet some of you soon.  I'll
be the real tall one who looks like Paul Bunyan (but without the beard - I
could never get used to all that facial itching) and kind of "old".

peace

Hello all....
I'm gearing up to relocate to the beautiful SF area (from Portland, Maine)
and am trying to find roomates/flatmates/friends who are immersed in 
house culture to an appreciable degree (e.g. listening to  dance oriented 
music more than anything else).  I'm a good friend of Maine promoter Kris 
Clark if that helps establish my credibilty with anyone at all  ; )
Ideally, I'd like to hook up with intelligent, open-minded and amusing 
people with a positive outlook and who possibly are involved with the scene 
as djs, promoters, or enthusiastic music loving dance fanatics.  I will be 
leaving Maine by April 1st and will be out in your region by the end of 
April. I'm really only bringing the necessities of life: computer, 
turntables, record, clothes, savings, auto. 
If anyone has any leads, I'd be glad to hear about them...

Galen just called and I guess I'm going to open up Sunset tomorrow with some 
ambient, so come down early! =)

Sounds like it may be at a new location in the East Bay and it'll be starting 
around noon.

"moshing", "slamming" or whatever does indeed take place, and the kidz fuck

I thought I'd share something I saw at a rave that I thought was pretty funny...

I ran into some friends from Berkeley at Harmony (last month).  Two of them
left kind of early (around 3) because they were pretty tired.  A couple of
hours later I'm on the dancefloor, and I spot some anonymous dancing feet
clad in huge white furry bunny slippers!  I run over to compliment the
wearer on their most excellent rave footwear...and who is it but the
friends who had left earlier!

Turns out they had gone all the way back to Berkeley, got ready for bed,
laid in bed and realized the beat was still in their feet and they couldn't
sleep, and they decided to come BACK to the party.  But it occurred to them
that there was really no reason to change...and they returned to Harmony in
their pj's and bunny slippers, and started dancing away!!

I love it that we're part of a scene where you can just come on down in a
nightgown and curlers if you want, and probably all that will happen is
that someone will think your bunnyslippers are the coolest!  Where else
could this happen?!  :P  Love, Nancy

Subject: Newbie Dilemma
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Tonight I may be introducing some "newbies" to the scene.   Some people who
live in my co-op have come up to me and said that they want to go to a rave
and also try ecstasy (I'm known in the house as the "ravechick," a bit of a
curiousity).  This position always makes me feel a little ambivalent.

On the one hand, I think the scene is so positive and the music so
transcendent and the experience so fun that I want to expose everyone to
it!  But when I'm accompanying a newbie I also feel compelled to kind of
direct their experience, to explain the music, to point out all the little
things that add meaning to the night.  I feel a responsibility to interpret
the experience FOR them, and I'm so worried about _their_ time that I stop
being able to totally enjoy myself.  I want others to see what I see,
because I know it's easy to only see the fucked-up kids, the ticket price,
the drugs, to hear only banality in the music.

I love the _possibility_ of the scene, the pure alternative community that
we on SFR envision.  And I feel that exposing others to that can only make
the scene stronger, IF they experience it on the deep level that many of us
do.

But I also worry that bringing people into the scene who may NOT see it
that way will actually weaken or destroy our vibe.

So, that leaves me with the dilemma of tonight.  Do I bring these four
newbies to Something Special (in my estimation, a low-budget rave but full
of vibe and delicious trance)?  Or to the full-on commercial Aborigine,
with its visuals and crowds and mainstream feel?

Are there TWO scenes - the mainstream and the underground?  Which to bring
a newbie to?  Is it irresponsible to randomly bring people into the scene?
Or should we ALWAYS strive to be inclusive and never exclusive?!

With too many philosophical questions
for just a partying Saturday night,
Nancy

Looking forward to meeting some of you wonderful folks!!

Everyone else is saying what they are wearing why not me. I'll be wearing a
white T-shirt with a smiley face that has piercing where it's ears, eyebrows,
should be as well as it's tongue sticking out with it pierced. I might wear a
Jester hat, but I'm not sure. I have really short, about 5'10 and have a
gotee. I'll be wearing my SFR laminate so come up and say HI, I don't bite
unless you want me to. If your interested in helping out with the SFR BBQ &
BEATS PICNIC PARTY come up and let me or Leslie know. I can't wait for
Sunday! Sunsets are the best. If you havn't been to one, it's a 
MUST, there GREAT! Hope to see all you there!

Hi there,

I just read (was it Nancy's?) post about taking newbies to a rave and
whether you should take them to one of the big commercial jobbies like
Aborigine or to the kind like Something Special, and I was about to sign
off, when the thought entered my mind: y'know volt, you're a newbie too.

So speaking from the newbie perspective, (Something Special will be my first
"real" one, if I go), I think you should take them to whichever one is
representative of what raving means to _you_.  They already know you're in
the scene, so you should show them _why_ you're in it, what draws you to it,
and in what ways it differs from the "banal", drug-ridden, insidious event
typically portrayed in the media (forgive me if you don't strike me as a
person who considers raving in the same light as the media).

Anyways, that's what I think.  Hope that helps...

Of my four years of raving, the only time I have ever heard a raver
speak of PLUR has been on the net.  For me, the concepts are so basic and
fundemental between the Family that it is a blasphemy to "quantitize" this
into a formular like P.L.U.R.

You don't need PLUR when you look into another raver's eyes at 6 am as the
sun is coming up on the beach and you've been dancing in the dark with
them all night, the experience speaks for itself in a language that words
will never approximate.

So did anybody else check out New Dawn Friday night? I didn't spot any 
SFR laminates, but then I wasn't there very long, had a final exam this 
morning... :(  :(  :(
Here's a synopsis for those who missed it:

It was held at the Acme warehouse. It seemed to be just about the right 
size for the crowd. Minimalist lighting, two multi-spot-type lights 
(moonbursts? Is that the trade name) and a long glowing fiber-optic cable 
(my own contribution). Some posters and other decorations. Very basic, 
not that its a bad thing at all, very underground feel.
Now, the sound : There's a jungle track called "Rivers of Bass". It has a 
good amount of bass to it. There's another called "Beyond Bass". This 
pretty much sums up the sound. The B.A.S.S crew splurged on bass bins and 
they got all the bass they ever would have needed, plus more. I'm 
surprised bricks weren't vibrating out the walls. I'd almost call it 
overkill, but they do call it DRUM & BASS, don't they? The flyer said 
"slammin bass" and they delivered.
First DJ up was Noel, he rocked a smooth set. Most of the people in were 
the early crowd and many looked a little confused, maybe not used to drum 
& bass tempos (or maybe stunned by all that bass). After Noel came on 
Stareyes, who decided to take no prisoners. Starting of with older dark 
hardcore she got the crowd moving, switching up the beats. Her set 
progressed to more of 'jump up" style (sort of a hard, 'gangsta' style, 
lots of ruffness), and the crowd reacted. After Stareyes was Evan, but I 
had leave to get some sleep...
The first 75 people in got free mix tapes and there were free oranges and 
water. Cost was 8$.
All in all it was an excellent effort for SF's unified jungle crew. This 
evidently was SF's first all-jungle allnighter (though the SFR historians 
might be able to correct me) and showed lots of promise for the state of 
jungle on the left coast.

new dawn went off on fri. night. all dj's rocked the acme w/an insane sound
sys., especialy dj stareyes. that little girl can slam! in the middle of her
jungle set she mixed in some happy hardcore gabber and the dancers just went
nuts. for those of you who missed it, you missed it! only a couple of hundred
people showed up which was nice cuz its not that fun when you have no space
to get funky. plus free mix tapes. i've heard of free acid at the door, but
this was much better. there was also no fucking drug dealers screming out for
sales. when you need drugs that bad at a party, it must not be that good to
begin with. jungle music's so crazy you don't even need that stuff.

this music is the new underground, for real. for those who say "i can't dance
to that jungle music. i like house". well, it just takes some time to
understand it. when house and trance are being played on the radio and mtv,
don't you think it's time to get into something more deviant to the
mainstrem? that's the only way new music will progress, is if you constantly
are searching for something new. change is a beatiful thing, so don't get
stuck in a rut. 

check out any of the B.AS.S crews gigs. btw, there's a new sound sys. at
bahia so check out energi on weds. nightes.

big up all junglists! check it, check it, aawwwww yah!!

Can anyone provide me with something more enlightening (location, times,

I just called and got the full info... they had to change locations this 
morning, perhaps setting the new message caused some temporary problems.

I was in San Francisco and I had the best time of my 
entire life and i want to move there because i love the
people and everything's hella cool and the weather's nice....


hi all,  i apologize to ppl i said i was going to contact and
didn't. one week is pretty short if you think about it.

thanks to JC for lettin' me do the show at Stanford.
Czefir, sorry i kept missing you.

I loved my spring break trip to SF so much i really do want
to move there. i am in wisconsin right now and it is so depressing.
no one smiles. the weather sucks on a daily basis. the parties
are lame.
need i say more?!

i went to MAD at the Bahia and had a great time.
then i went to the party at the Berkeley Marina on Wednesday
and almost had an orgasm it was so exciting. i have never danced under
the stars like that. it's changed the way i feel about life!


well, i'll write more later.

i love you all.

The majic with the sunset parties is still there.  The vibe was 
incredible, lots of smilie faces and great music.  A beautiful feel of 
many friendly high energy dancers.  But what was up with that drummer.  
For those of you that weren't there, this guy had a complete drum set in 
the middle of the dance floor.  I had to get right next to the speakers 
to be able to hear the music over his drumming, which wasn't always 
keepin with the beat that well.  
Other than that the day was GREAT!  I was the guy wearing the red striped 
sweat shirt, with blue sleeves.
Angela and I had a fabulous time.  Thank you all for contributing to the 
experience.

Hello all...was thinking about the upcoming outdoor parties and wondered if
there has ever been a rave on ANGEL ISLAND here in beautiful SF bay?  Seems
great, unbestable with a permit, no locals, and crowd control as the last
boat over is 5pm or so and the first one off is 7 am or so, and what views!!
 
Or has anyone ever considered a train party?  You can rent out cars on Amtrak
trains, a round-trip rave to LA or Portland or Tahoe, diffeent DDJ in every
car, limited/controled crowd, unbustable, new fascinating scenery!  Just make
sure there is extra stable tunrtables!

Also along the lines of permit/bustable parties.....i understand some groups
in LA get permits for parties by getting a movie permit, not a party permit.
 They just have a few video camera with no tape and maybe some lights every
now and then to be safe.  They "film" the "party scene" part of the movies
that night the permit is issued!  Movie permits allow you to have lights,
sound, lots people etc....anyone ever go that route here in the city?  Just a
very creative way to make the rules work for you, instead of breaking them
and getting a party busted.

any thoughts????
peace

Well, that sounded really stupid.  What I meant to say is I'm looking forward
to meeting each of you.  I know that won't be all at the same time in the
same place - so I'll look forward to meeting some of you with each visit.
 Please don't flame me too bad.

Subject: Virtual Rave

Hi all,

We are currently beta testing a LIVE RealAudio dance music site, playing 
mainly house and progressive trance.  Our resident DJs Alex & Dan have played 
a LIVE set on Fridays over the last couple of weeks.  

To listen you will need a 28.8 connection and the latest RealAudio 2.0 
software, which is available free from our Web Site.

We have another live event planned for next Friday at 10.00pm GMT, although 
you can listen to music from previous events and our archive at any time.

We are also looking at creating a chat room that will be open at the same 
time as the live events.  So people from all over the world can listen to the 
same music at the same time and meet other like-minded clubbers.

Hopefully, this all adds up to being a 'large' night in, we are also 
discussing the possibility of broadcasting audio from some of the UK's top 
clubs.

And best of all, it's completely free !!  Point your browser at 
www.griffin.co.uk/music.htm, and join in the party.

Any suggestions, comments are very welcome.

Adrian.

What do you mean by "pause"?  You probably don't mean an automatic reply
to each message you receive ("Steve is on vacation until...").  You can 
unsub by sending majordomo@hyperreal.com the message "uns*bscribe" 
(replacing the * with a 'u') and then reading the list archives on 
hyperreal when you return, or you can just not do anything and catch up 
on hundreds of messages when you return.

For some reason my original post got hexed, so I'll say it again :

Even though it seemed like both DRC & Markie got lost and weren't able to 
find it, and I wouldn't go so far as to label it one of the single 
greatest experiences of my life, but friday night had a lot of class.

DMC just scored themselves aces in my book.

What an incredible weekend!! 
Went to Something Special on Saturday night; it was held in a smallish 
warehouse in an alleyway.  It was nice to be in a new location.  Not all 
that many people showed up, but there were enough people to have an 
**INCREDIBLE** vibe going on! :)  For the first time since the Gathering 
Anniversary party in December, I have been able to actually dance 
comfortably because it was not too hot and stuffy! :):) When we first 
arrived, the music was kinda weird and I couldn't really get into it and 
not many people were dancing.  But I remember when Joe Rice took hold of 
the decks, he brought the place together.  Great set, Joe!  But the dj's 
that REALLY stand out in my mind that night were LeLe and Tom.  These 
guys tore the place up!!  The crowd was **SO** into the music!  I also 
got to meet sfraver Nancy - you are SO nice, I'm looking forward to 
getting to know you! :):)

Then Sunset on Sunday was also great.  My new boyfriend, Demian and I 
took Porche, his boxer, to the party.  Demian had never been to Sunset 
before - he thought everyone just slept on Sunday.  Boy was he surprised 
at the immense numbers of people who still needed to dance and whoop it 
up! :) Gosh, everybody and their grandma was there.  I got to see old 
friends who I haven't in months and new people like Leslie and SDream and 
Moonpup.  I'm glad we all got pictures of each other.  I couldn't walk 2 
feet without bumping into someone I knew - I was almost kind of sad that 
I couldn't sit down and *really* talk too each person.  I want to get to 
know all of you, but in circumstances like this, it is gonna take awile!
There are certainly more people than just me that think that this is 
going to be a summer we shall never forget.  This weekend will resonate 
with me all this coming week. :):):)

love,
Amy

I'm a virgin. I don't know how to fuck. As a result, I also a pretty 
lousy hug. Even as far back as High School my friends would be giving me 
shit for being a lousy hug and I'd be all "Fuck you man. You got someone 
to practice on. I don't have that." I'm not a very physically 
affectionate person. But I'm learning.

Mike,

        Your friends here on the list will be more than happy to help
educate you in the joys of hugging!  As far as knowing or not knowing how,
you just basically go with what feels good.  It's best to hug as many
people as possible, compare the experiences, and keep what you like best.
You can kinda judge how to hug someone by the way they hug (how intense,
when to break, whether or not to move your hands around some, etc.).  When
we meet, I'll show you what I mean :)

Peace & hugz,

- E

The next 3 nights will be the best nights to view it! It's when it will be
the closest to us.
I was "surfin' the net" and found something really cool-
Check out this web site: skypub.com/comets/hyaku3.html
It has all the info you need on the comet, including a GIF map of where the
comet will be over the next few days and a WAV file on how to pronounce the
name (!)

DJ Hardware sent me (and KDVS) copies of Trip Hop Acid Phunk 2 and Acid 
Warefare and they are really good!  THAP2 has some really cool mixes of 
nice tunes, including some fun tribal drum beats and AW has some great 
acid tracks on it... Just thought I'd show some support! :)

Hey, all!  It's the post-hound here, with reflections of my first Sunset.
I must make a point to get to these outdoor gigs earlier; arrived just
before 4pm, and I thought the thing was too short, but that's just because
there were so many people I was looking forward to seeing, many for the
first time!
Sure were a lot of dogs this time out...
It was HUGE!  Biggest outdoor party I've seen.  Everyone was so friendly
and in great spirits.  It felt wonderful to wander though the crowd and
have people see me & say "Are you Eric?"  Maybe the SHROOMARAMA shirt will
become something of an institution...
I didn't see any of the "crew," but I haven't talked with them much lately,
so I need to find out what parties they'll be attending and introduce them
to all you wonderful friends :)
The vibe was strong, especially among the dancers; I paid attention to
whether or not I could pick up on it through my enhanced bliss, and
definitely found it, though at times I slipped inside my own thang.
Couldn't get my feet to move enough, but I know why, and will adjust
accordingly ;)
I was honored to meet Diana, Nancy, Leslie, Tony, two guys from Ireland, a
big, beautiful, friendly guy named Mostafa, and Aaron (a charming,
delightful, fascinating lady!), and everyone else I met for the first time.
I was happy to see my friends Rachel, Carin, Jonathan, Troy, Nicole, and
again everyone else I've met before (Purple Tiger, Phoenix, and others).
I liked the drummer when he was on the beat, and spent some time situated
where I could hear him and the music together.  I kept being drawn closer
to the drums, as I'm a bass player.  It was a joy to have that little boy
fooling around on the kit!
I danced longer than usual this time, and the whole event went by so fast!
At the end, I was dancing close to this tall, blond, bearded guy, very
bouncy and full of glee.  We didn't introduce ourselves, but had fun just
dancing and being.
I was very honored to give Carin a ride home to the dazemaze that is SF,
and to catch a brief glimpse into her beautiful, spirit-filled home.
Driving home was challenging, but I made it in time to get plenty of sleep
so I could function at work.  Now, if I could just concentrate on
work...but I feel so good...

Thanks to everyone for the incredible first Sunset of the year, and first
Sunset for Eric P.!  See y'all again soon!

Peace,

- E

Mike, 

I am also not very good at hugging.  Perhaps we can practice together at 
the next rave?

I have been in CA for ten years, and I have learned to hug people I 
really know easily, but the kind that happen at raves, I feel very 
awkward about.  

However, I don't think most ravers think it is too bad of a flaw!

   Mike and all other (types of) virgins, 
   
   Many of us were once virgins and I like to think I'm still a virgin of 
   many things to come in life.  The beauty in our innocence is being able 
   to discover and try different ways of feeling comfortable with whatever 
   we're exploring.  In our journey, we must first allay our fears within 
   ourselves in order to have the confidence to choose when and where you 
   want to try something new.  Sometimes we learn by happenstance but there 
   are always opportunities waiting for us to discover. 
   
   So try to (er...) embrace your hugging journey until you find what's 
   best for you.  And as I think someone previously mentioned, there are 
   all types of hugs (from the "that's nice" insincere hug to the "even 
   exchange energetic hug" [where you both feel energized, happier and 
   lighter] to the full-on "I wanna get physical" hug).  You'll definitely 
   find plenty of opportunities for hugs in this scene and I hope no one 
   tells you it's lousy.
   
   Warm embraces and some more schlocky thoughts,
   Diane

I'm a virgin. I don't know how to fuck. As a result, I also a pretty 
lousy hug. Even as far back as High School my friends would be giving me 
shit for being a lousy hug and I'd be all "Fuck you man. You got someone 
to practice on. I don't have that." I'm not a very physically 
affectionate person. But I'm learning.

Subject: Something Very Special!!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

What a beautiful week-end!!!

I did decide to take the newbies to the real underground.  Instead of four,
only two new people wanted to come (the other two were all, "I don't want
to do ecstasy and I hate that annoying music."  Well, I'm glad then that
they didn't come!!  Raving is the collective vibe - everybody has to
contribute with their positive energy and their love.  GOOD ATTITUDE is the
only prerequisite!).

I wasn't going to pay $20 for some big faceless rave, so I took a chance on
Something Special.  I say a "chance" because I didn't know Tom and his crew
or their philosophy, whether this would be the true experience or just a
low-budget dance party.  I also hadn't heard of anyone else going and I
wasn't sure of the crowd.

We arrived with our five dollars and can of food in hand.  Newbies liked
the secret mappoint and surreptitious creep down the alleyway to enter
secret door.  When we entered the party I became apprehensive.  Maybe 50
people there, tiny place, one laser, and bad music.  Oh no!  I decided to
give the party a chance to develop into something...special.  And did it
ever!!! =) !

Within an hour the place had filled to about 150 beautiful, happy people.
The main lights were turned off, the laser was going off, and the music
turned into incredible deep booming trance.  Tom and LeLe ripped up their
sets...the energy was just pouring out of the music, and Tom was jumping up
and down behind the decks, making the crowd respond.  Darwin Chamber played
an incredible live set, creating the music, the feeling, right there.
Newbies crawled into the bassbin and stayed there for half the night,
gasping "this music!!".

Looking around, I knew what this crew was about.  Beautiful posters
decorated the space, reminding us of higher consciousness and universal
love.  A banner waved over the dancefloor with the Sanskrit symbol for
harmony - everything in the universe vibrating at the same frequency.  I
realized that _that_ is the power of this music, why it is _so_ spirtual,
so transcendental.  It creates a frequency that we all tune into, creating
harmony and symbiosis between us all, rising us to that unified level.
Whew!

The underground people there knew what it was all about.  There were many
smiles, much friendliness, many hugs.  Near the end we formed a giant
circle on the dancefloor, everyone in the place holding hands.  A huge
group hug formed.  At the height of the vibe the crew passed out messages,
telling us that the scene is about unity and love and happiness, and asking
that everyone return to that mentality to create "something special."  :)

I met a few SFRavers there!!  Amy and Shawna and Tony and Volt, yea!  This
was Volt's first party, what did you think?!  My newbies were too
overwhelmed.  One, unfortunately, had overdosed, and could only sit in a
corner.  The other was overcome with vibe - she didn't dance, but stood on
the outskirts of the dancefloor with raised arms.  She explained to me that
she was sending out energy to all the dancers. :)

The morning came too soon.   Mattresses were taken off the skylights,
flooding the room with sunlight, and everybody cheered for the light.  We
drove home in exhausted silence, dj Dutch's trance filling the car.

Thank you Tom and LeLe and James and everyone else who put on this
BEAUTIFUL party!!  This is what the scene should be about and what we all
should work for.  I thank them for going out on a limb and creating the
most special party they could...

Love, Nancy

I've had some trouble with this situation too... the desire to share
everything I've experienced versus their need to find their own experience.  
I've come to the conclusion that the best thing I can do is show them
my initial enthusiasm by taking them to the party and being open about my
own experiences, and then letting them go... It's hard not to try to push,
but once I finally find myself first, enjoying my own dancing and made my
peace with my own interpretation of the night, I find that they will come
back to me and tell me what a good time they're having.  It's like the saying,
If you love something set it free, and when it comes back to you, it's yours.
Well, just trust them to find the things they need to to understand what's
going on.  And just be yourself to show them your interpretation, and let
them choose for themself.

So, that means worry about yourself first.  Go to the party you think
you'll have the most fun at, be it a small party with a solid vibe or a big 
party with huge speakers and lights galore.  There are the bad elements
everywhere, and once you stop having a problem with them, your friends
will see your example and not have a problem with them either.

> But I also worry that bringing people into the scene who may NOT see it

It really doesn't matter if they see it or not, as long as you see it.
And it's impossible to know how someone will intrepret it all, so it's
usually best to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Everybody has the
potential to see everything, and if you let them, they will almost always
surprise you.  Our vibe is much more than our vibe... it is a fundamental
undercurrent of everything, including everyone and everything, and it
is our own judgmental nature that creates all the negative things we run
across.  Know yourself first, and everyone else will follow.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend,

-john.

I have to agree that I was a little annoyed by the drummer, but had a great time
anyway.  And it certainly was crowded!!!  I kind of hope that it doesn't stay
as crowded...

I was the guy in the "El Gallo" Rooster t-shirt. ???

Mine is hosed and I'd like to purchase another one.  Can anyone give me 
some leads on places around Berkeley/SF or mailorder houses?  I do not 
own a car, so something accessible via BART/bus would be nice.

thanks,

What a wonderful whirlwind of a weekend!

Something Special Saturday, Sunset Sunday (my 1st) . . .

Hyakutake hovering . . .

A weekend when faces and smiles became more familiar
When familiar smiles became friends
And friends grew closer . . .

Thanks to all of you (now too numerous to mention) for leading me down the
rabbit hole!

Wotta party!!

I had a great time at this party!  I really liked the space they had it 
in (I understand they were originally gonna have it at the same place 
that busted F-8 party was held, and I liked this one much better!), it 
had a nice comfy feel to it & I liked it immediately upon walking in 
the door.  The chill area was somewhat small, but it never got 
overcrowded, & the main area was nice too.  It never got too not to 
deal with, & it never got too crowded to deal with.  The music was kind 
of strange when I first got there (an emergency replacement for the 
currently laid-up Ethan. :(:(  but then Joe Rice hopped onboard & 
played a nifty set (like your stuff, joe, never heard it before!).  I 
had brought my new friend (never been to a rave, never tried anything 
before!), she had a good time too.  I didn't originally expect to see 
many people I knew there, but of course ended up running into all kinds 
of familiar faces, plus some new ones (hi michael albers, nancy, etc!)  
This was such a sweet party, maybe only 150 people or so, the vibe was 
totally there, the music was totally there, it all came together 
beautifully!  And I must make special mention to our own sfraver dj 
Tom!  He ripped the party up with his killer goa trance set, AWESOME!!  
(& of course I consider it a bonus he played several of my favorite 
songs!)  He did an immensely excellent job of really bringing the 
energy in the room into focus, I could practically feel the flow of 
energy between dj & audience, he did those great music builds that get 
everybody screaming at the top of their lungs & stomping away!  He was 
obviously having a great time & so was the crowd.  Everyone who loves 
good goa should definitely keep an eye out for dj tom, he's one to look 
for!  Tom, I hope you guys do more parties, this was awesome!

Love,
Shawna

Amazing Sunset!  I was overwhelmed by this one...at least double any
turn-out from last year.  Our scene is regenerating, my friends.  Many new
people have come in and are making it stronger and more loving - their
optimism contributing to a return to the purity of early raving.  How
comforting that we do not need old-style ravers to show us the
light...newbies are arriving with positivity and grooving on the highest
vibe...

I had a premonition as I felt Sunset's strong energy...the scene has COME
BACK, in a major way.  I think this summer is going to be another Summer of
Love - a time when all the ravers will dedicate themselves to the most
beautiful group experience they can create.  I see many more presents and
group hugs and friendliness in our future!  Let's make this as incredible
as it can be!

Point Molate was gorgeous - I watched the changing colors of the sky and
the water, the lights of the endless bridge.  The music captivated
everyone, hundreds of people dancing as freely as they wanted :) .  At
first I was distressed at a "gangsta" element, looking hard and drinking
beers.  But then I noticed what they were doing - intensely dancing,
grinning, and hugging each other.  Ahh, rave is a mentality, not what you
look like.

Met some more SFRavers!  What's up Eric and Todd?  Your first Sunset, what
did you think?  In the last week I've met about ten of you (at Light, Lee
and Peter and Angela).  I'm very glad to humanize this list - the last two
weeks having conversations with a computer screen has been rather surreal.

One other happy note: yesterday I learned to appreciate Progressive House.
A bummer for me at Sunsets last year was the music.  I never could stand
vocals and piano riffs and saxophone.  Give me hard trance!! (still my
favorite).  But suddenly yesterday I got it - the beat keeps coming on and
on.  The beat sustained me, gave me energy, and the pianos and the softness
brought me on smooth trips - perfect for a Sunday afternoon in a park.  The
vocals verbalized our highest feelings..."I feel love," "set my spirit
free."  Almost like mantras for the meditative state induced by this
amazing music.

Sunset was the perfect culmination to an intense experience.  I hadn't
slept in 36 hours - I'd spent 8 hours the night before in a frenzy to
energetic trance.  Too tweaked out to sleep, Sunday got progressively
stranger as exhaustion and afterglow intensified.  I was moving to an
internal beat all day, and then I got to Sunset, to dance out all that was
in my system.  I needed the beat, but softer, slower, easing me down.
Progressive House did the trick.  I went to Sunset with a new friend :) who
I had met the night before - a newbie raver of five months, who feels his
life has been changed.  We soaked in a hot tub for nearly three hours late
at night, ahhh... I don't even remember falling asleep, it was so deep.
Today I feel totally refreshed, rejuevanation after 24 hours of total
intensity, being truly alive.  Whew!

Highlights: people dancing with torches in front of the drummer.  People
dancing on top of the slide set.  The sunset.  Group circle, holding hands.
People yelling, "THANK YOU!!" at the end of the night.  The smiles on
everyone's faces.

Going to MAD tonight - see some of you there??

Sunset was huge... probably a little too big.

Galen's soundsystem was really straining to push all those people.  Usually
at a Sunset the central focus of the party is the music... but the system
just was not loud enough to provide that focus.  As a result, the key element
of a Sunset, the music, was not quite happening.  Then there was the drummer
who would often times completely drown out the already struggling beat.  I
don't have a problem with druming to music... but usually people use hand
drums that are not as loud.  I think the drummer should have respected
the music more and moved away from the sound system, and played softer.
At one point he actually moved closer, until he was dead center of the
dance area...  And he could not really keep a decent beat with the music.

The area seemed pretty trashed, mostly by empty alchol containers.  I
think these people need to be reminded of what the "R" in PLUR means.

And while I am being grouchy, let me just say that, IMHO, the music was
not up to par.  It seems to be that the music was too whispy and new-age.  
It did not have enough solid beats to dig my body into.  But maybe this
is a personal problem I am having with SF music in general right now.
Again, its just my humble opinion. 

I couldn't help but feel like this was not a Sunset, but instead an ordinary
outdoor party... It was great seeing a ton of friends, but without good
music and dancing, the Sunset magic is just not there for me. 

I still had fun at Sunset... but I think I had a lot more fun at 2 previous
outdoor Gateway parties and the outdoor F&F party.

If memory serves me well (not likely ;-)) this could be "Voices" by
K.C. Flight? This already a pretty old record, starting with sort-of
African drums and the chanting of "Voices inside my head, echo things
that you said", sounds familiar?

Personally (my $0.02) I'm not too crazy about recycling older non-rave
songs for this purpose, many of the resulting records are pretty cheezy
(like all the Oh Fortuna crap). In my opinion, each new techno record
should be an entirely new experience, showing you new sights and ideas.
Unfortunately there's so much more music produced today compared to a few
years ago this is only rarely the case. I like samples (looped and distorted)
that contribute to the trance induced by the record, not because they
remind "the raver" of something he/she's heard before.

I wont even begin to go off about how delicious sunset was, besides, I think
all of S.F. was there. (It's gonna be one phat season kiddies!)  Who was
playing this evening, if you know what there times were, that would be even
better.  Question 2, Are sunset parties recorded?  Question 3: Where can I
get tapes of todays groove guides, even if this particular session wont be
for sale?

I am reminded of my first rave.  I went with a very good friend, some 
other newbies, and a few old-timers.  I never went expecting anything 
from anyone.  I was curious, what was it all about that some of my good 
friends were so into?  I had an absolutely amazing time, was overwhelmed, 
was learning all about what was going on, was put off by some of the lesser 
elements.  But, I really enjoyed myself AND I came back.  We were all 
newbies at one time, right?  Some ppl will like it and some won't.  I am 
not as *in* to it as some others, but I still love it for all that it can 
offer me, and I try and give back what I can.  It took me awhile to *get* 
the music, but when I experienced my catharsis, there was 
no looking back.  I LOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEE it.  But to experience it, I had to 
take that first step and just go with someone else who had gone before.  
My only regret is to not have found it sooner!

> Sunset was huge... probably a little too big.

I agree, Troy. I don't expect these events to last long. Not at that
size. Not with that many cars. Not with that much trash. I left a
little after the sun went down, wish I could have stayed late to clean
up, but there were still too many people there. I've got to remember
to bring trash bags next time too.

I thought there was some interesting break-beat stuff in there
somewhere, but that was the best of it. There seemed to be alot of
samba type beats. I'm full-on "tainted by trace" myself, Goa trance
does me so good. I thought that the Chocolate Factory studio put out
Goa like PRANA and Tsuyoshi Suzuki? I guess they do all kinds. I still
danced for four hours straight though. There's something about dancing
outdoors on a beautiful day that just makes me
.......feel......so........real............

I hope these sunsets continue without busts.

Friends,

Well, this was really an amazing Sunset for me. I have always felt the
sort of spiraling outward love vibe, but this time I completely fell
into it. It was better than any drug induced high I have ever been on!

It _was_ huge, and the outskirts, where people were drinking and you couldn't
really hear the music, seemed more like a barbeque or something than a Sunset.

But it was really happening on the dance floor.

What I think is happening is that a lot of diverse people are being drawn
to our community right now and are checking it out. This is both a 
wonderful thing and a scary thing. I think there is real potential for
a mass movement that could transform society. But it could just be
another "flavor of the month" for MTV. Alot of you have been around
for the last time raver visibility/popularity spiked and I am curious
what you think. I was aware of it, since I have always had lots of raver
friends, but didn't go much myself. I went to a Warfield rave in 1992(?),
and was (unsurprisingly) turned off by it. It took Sunsets last summer
for me to get it.

Most of the people on the outskirts seems to be having a good time
and were smiling, goofy, friendly, etc. But definitely making a mess!

Let's all bring a garbage bag and clean up afterwards. I often do, but
had to leave early this time. Does anyone know how much of a mess we
left behind?

Peace,
Jim

Can anyone tell me about this party?  I have a friend who is coming down 
from Seattle and is dying to see Jeno (my friend used to rave about 3-4 
years ago).  I thought I'd see if anyone here has any input about this 
party.  Thanks in advance.

Yes, virtually none, as quite a few people *did* bring garbage bags and 
put them to good use when the music stopped. The site cleaned up nicely. Oh

I took nothing but memories and left nothing but footprints, Jim :)  I
would have stayed to clean up, too, but Carin needed a ride, and me being
the knight that I am, I told her that it would be my pleasure.  I think she
was blown away that I would drive her to SF, then drive home to SJ, but
it's no thang when it's for a friend, right?
I'll bring bags in the future.  Better remember some gloves, too (does
anyone REALLY know what that gray, wet, mudlike stuff is that accumulates
on the floor at indoor parties?  My friends call it "rave crud"...)

Peace,

I have to agree, even though I do consider myself a feminist and find this
comment a tad offensive.  I have found that every time it gets near "that
time" I do say a lot of thing I do not mean and become an overall bitch.  I'm
sure this is not true for most women, we all PMS in our own ways, but it's
just been my experience I am not very nice to be around a couple days a
month, and break up with my boyfriend, only to get back together two days
later.  Sigh...it's tough being a woman.

While enjoying a beautiful but chilly day at Great America this weekend
(Saturday) I noticed a most interesting member of the human race while
standing in line for the Ring of Fire IMAX movie (pretty cool movie).  He had
bleached blond hair, sideburns,a goatee, and several tatoos, wearing a
Thrasher T-shirt and black pants.  Looked to be about     5' 9".  If anyone
knows this guy could you contact me privately as I would like to reach him.
 I am sending this message to sfraves because, I know this is just an
apearance judgement based on himself and his friends, he looked like a raver.
 Also, I am not desperate I just found him intriguing and never got the

I still wouldn't consider "hella" a raver word, "hella"'s been around 
at least since 1982/83, where I first encountered it in 8th grade (also 
known as "helluv").  Just about *everybody* I know uses it.

Sunset meant the world to me, for I had a friend there and my sister was
visiting from Buffalo (she's 18).  They were both blown away by it all (we
also went to Something Special).

I thought the numbers were fine, thought I guess parking is an issue.  That
and the fact that I love to see lots and lots of people.  The music was
good, diferent, but good, and I was happy that it kept going and going
after the sun went down.

As for the little drummer dude, that bothered me, because every time he got
off beat it sounded like a train wreck.  It can throw one off and that's no
fun.  I heard at one point a small kid was banging the drums and that was
when I felt like saying something.

I brought 10 large trash bags, and I recommend others do the same next
time.  I tied a couple to the trees and stuff to make them more noticable.
I think one of the most importnat things we can do is start picking up
trash *before* it gets dark.  Also, when you start picking up trash, people
tend to feel guilty about their area and generally pick their trash up.  I
feel very strongly about making sure we leave the place as best we can.
I'd even go so far as to suggest a little trash force (trash task force?)
that meets behind the DJ booth maybe just after sunset with bags in hand
and do a general sweep of the place.  Not crawling in between dancers or
anything, but getting piles of trash together and picking up the major
stuff.  It would at least make the final clean-up go faster.

Anyway, thanks to Pacific, the DJs and all you people for making it a most
memorable day.  :^)

Peace!

Tony

Well it looks like I can send out, got my test message on my other account,
but I'm not getting anything back. Guess I got knocked off the list on the

   Yeah, like most others at Sunset, I had a great time groovin' w/others 
   to the beats.  I especially liked the "hot summertime 'jazzy' sounds" 
   Joeski mixed.  He'd get me all warm and squishy with my dancing and then 
   switch us to harder grinding beats, definitely a passionate man with his 
   music.  Those NY boys ain't bad 'cause I heard them the night before at 
   Organic and they had us moving all around.
   
   Speaking of Organic, it was a pretty good space w/a nice mix of people.  
   Not too old, young, hip, clubby, etc.  Surprising for me at least!  I 
   guess I'm just a bit staid right now.  I was wondering if anyone went to 
   Aborigine.  We didn't know the map point changed and so we ended up at 
   Organic.  I'd appreciate a review if anyone went.
   
   W/r/t Lito, the drummer, he's actually a very accomplished musician 
   who's played at some clubs along with the dj's and other conga players 
   (e.g., 1015, End Up, DV8, etc.).  He was definitely outta synch in 
   comparison to hearing him in the past and though I didn't speak with him 
   afterwards, I'm sure he was frustrated too.
   
   It was good to see so many people (and sfravers) come out of the 
   woodwork for Sunset.  Perhaps this'll be part of our rites for Spring.
   
   See ya on the dance floor!
   
   Diane

The first was great!!...

I got there a little late, in time to hear all the NYC djs but I missed
pacific's crew.  As we rolled over the hill I was amazed at how many people
had showed up for this sunset..WOW.  Our family is growing in a major way
and it in't at all bad.  I met many, many people - old and new friends - I
know what you mean Amy S.  I am sorry though I didn't see or meet any new
sfravers though.  :)  I spent a lot of time up front dancing and keeping
warm.  There was sooo much energy eminating from the people dancing.
Amazing.  I was in the circle Nancy and it was great when every one voiced
their enjoyment prior to dancing individually.  I didn't go to chocolate
factory and going to sunset I didn't know what to expect from three NYC djs
but their style is similar to the sf flavour.  I even heard many popular
tracks, many I've heard Jeno spin.  I wish I had brought my camera...untill
the next.  "Thank you sunset"

I noticed this too.   A bunch a guys squized their way to the front(In
front of me).  I over heard one say:"Damn no bitch'es anywhere.  Dis iz
bunk! Let's go."
Another said:"No way man.  This DJ's phat.  He's from philli or NY or someth=
in'"
They stayed.  They danced. they yelled.  They then smiled.  They
jumped/huged/and got all involved in the music.

  I thought:  This is what sunset/raving is about: The music, the love,
friendship, and your community.  I smiled when the first guy said:"Yeah
this is cool."

sunset was sunset. :)

 i think it was a very fun and vibey party.  the crowd was very into 
the music that the chocolate factory dj's spun, and i think the dj's
were really into delivering the best they could offer.  They were all
hyped up. :)

  defiately after 6 months i was ready for sunset, and it delived 
as usual all i expect.

peace,

Maybe The Police took it from an older song ... but Voices Inside My Head is 
from Zenyatta Mondatta which was released in the VERY early 80's.  :) 
i've been a Police fan for as long as i've known they existed - in fact 
they were my first concert! - but still, you could be right in that the 
ORIGINAL original was an older song.

Most of the time i agree with this sentiment, but it's nice to hear 
something you REALLY love mixed in with other stuff you really love.  
When they played Comfortably Numb at Freedom (july 1/95)in the chill tent 
i was absolutely delighted.  But sometimes it works and sometimes it 
doesn't ...

You're absolutely right here, however, when I said "pretty old record"
I meant on the "rave time scale" (tm). So K.C. Flight (?) probably sampled
it from The Police. And by coincedence, they were one of the first bands
I enjoyed as a teenager, I never realized that this sample was one of
theirs.

I do appreciate it when a good record comes along, but then mostly I prefer
the original (like Comfortably Numb) over a techno version. It takes a lot
of talent, I feel, to make something better out of something which was
already good. Many of the chill-out DJ's I've witnessed usually only play
what is "officially" considered ambient etc. We could use a bit more
creativity in that respect.

Everybody puts their fingers on it, that's how it gets all encrusted under your 
fingernails! ;)  I've actually been wondering about that mysterious substance, 
I'd look at my hands and *know* I didn't just drag my fingernails along the 
ground like it looked.  Bleh!  I think they should pass out wash clothes & 
fingernail scrubbers at raves! :)  I wouldnt call it "dirt" tho, this stuff 
consists of way more things than just dirt!  Lord knows what tho...

My favorite place is Leo's pro-audio on Van Ness in SF.  The prices aren't
always the lowest, but Keith, who works there, is a DJ and also super-nice.
And sometimes they WILL cut deals, based on what other people are selling
around town.

Really interested in finding out whether people like to drop all their
hard-earned green stuff.

I went out this evening, thinking it might be hard to find in the sky.
I had a route planned in my car to find a good viewing spot, but then
decided to take it on foot.  I got about 2 minutes from my apartment
on foot, found the big dipper, and saw the fuzz ball who's tail almost
touched the ladel of the upside down big dipper with the naked eye.
It's very very cool.  Everyone go out and see it, because it'll be
a while before this comet comes around again, and it'll be quite some
time for something this spectacular.  Go see it now while the tail is
still clear.  Go go!

If I could take out the light in my parking lot, I would have a perfect
view from my bedroom window.  What I wouldn't do for a bb-gun.  :)


Cosmically,

Andrew

Wish I'da gone like I originally planned to.

Okay, finally hit my first rave on Saturday night (or should I say, Sunday
morning) with Something Special, and I must say, I was not disappointed. (I
don't really count the Berkeley Marina thingie even though I was there and I
liked it.)  

It was trippy for me at first, cuz the location entrance was in some small
alleyway and I'd never been to one so I didn't know what to expect.  Walking
in around 1:00am, I saw the neato laser lights, the air a touch smokey, and
loud music thumping away.  Not as many people as I thought there might be,
but still enough to make the scene happening.  I wandered about the crowd
and dance floor first to acquaint myself with the environment.  After about
5 minutes of that I kinda said "f*ck it" and jumped in the middle of the
crowd, dancing at first inhibitedly and sort of stationary, but after about
a minute of that I downshifted to whirling dervish mode and it was off to
the races from there!  I pretty much danced until my out-of-shape body
begged my spirit for a respite from the frenzied movement.

The first SFRaver I met there was Nancy (truly a pleasure to make your
acquaintance!) and after that I must have met at least another half dozen or
so people (who's names my deteriorating short term memory can no longer
produce, except for Pauly -- great meeting you too!) that are on the list
but told me they were sorta lurkers more than posters, and another half
dozen who aren't on the list but are in the scene.  They were all equally nice!

What I found most inspiring was that everybody was very kind, just there to
smile and dance and share in a very synergistic experience where a spiritual
energy just sort of flows through everybody around.  I thought I'd be tired
being up that late, especially dancing, but I wasn't.  What I did feel was
the sense of community and solidarity from the people in the crowd,
transcending limitations set both by differences in outward appearance and
disparity of individual beliefs in favor of the release of the mind and
spirit through dance and entrancing lights and sound (I particularly enjoyed
LeLe's set, and the others rocked as well!).  Basically what I discovered is
the spirituality and benevolence that seems to be lacking in the world as we
move like raindrops down a window in a storm through our daily routines.
And I'm happy to have found it here.

So anyways, I'd like to thank the people who put on Something Special, cuz
it was very much that for me, and a fitting introduction to the scene.  To
those of you I met, I'm really glad I did (meet you)!  And to those of you I
have yet to meet, I very much look forward to our meeting in the future --
yeah, that means you lurkers too!  Lotsa love to all!

Rejuvenated and reborn,

volt

that seems to be a recurring theme in raving: VIBE.  I like that.  That

Well, as far as drug terms go, the following was forgotten:

And we can't forget all of the ones refering to the event itself:

renegade, space, event, party, etc. etc.

Now, the above term, I must say, I've only heard in use with the word
"hella", e.g. "I haven't done that in hella days..."  My ex-girlfriend used
to say it as well and it was kinda funky when I first heard it, but I got
used to it.

The Ancients believed that comets were harbingers of doom or disaster, a comet 
appeared in 1066 at the time of the Norman Conquest (It was Hailey's Comet),
maybe this is how the belief started that, with the appearence of a comet, 
"A King will fall".  Modern day astrologers see Comets as introducing immediate
chaotic forces of change, to most people this spells trouble but it needn't be
interpreted that way. To say the least though, in the next few months, we will 
all be living in "interesting times".

I had a good premonition about the "Rebirth of the Goddess" party, A friend knew
the woman who organized the party and I knew the space that it was being
thrown in from doing the door of a party there a couple of years ago.  I had
a friend
with me who had been to his first Party New Years eve (Acme).  I had the feeling
that this would be the kind of party that would really do the trick (for him :)
And indeed it was a fine party, definitely one of the best parties that I have
been to and the best small party of the year for me.  The space was interesting
in that you went UP a long flight of stairs into a large hall way area, as you 
went down a narrow hall there was a bathroom and a larg opening onto a "roof"
where smoking was allowed.  Smoking was not allowed anywhere else in the Party
and It made so much difference. There were turntables and candles and
decorations set up in the first room, behind that, there was a empty
carpeted room with dim lights that one could chill out or streach or quietly
chat in. Then, beyond that, stairs that went Down...
Down to the other half of the party, to the Nether World. At the bottom was
a spinning mirror ball and the entrance was always guarded by an interesting
faeire of somesort (there were many of the fair folke about that night:). The
first room was a chill-out dub room with big ass couches, and some blazing video
wallpaper supplied by Dimension 7.  Go through that and turn a corner and your
in the main dance room which PolyWog followed by Tracy completely Rocked!
With out the smoke and the pushing newbies I slid into trance so easily, though
i was afraid that I had forgot how, (it's been a long time for me), but Tracy,
as always, never let's me down, In fact, I I can't ever think of a time that
I've ever heard Tracy play a bad set.  After Tracy spun, there was a
performance by a group of fairy women which was really fine, polywog
provided the DJ back up
and one of the women did some ad-lib house vocals which were really kool.
The folks who put on the party obviously put a lot of planning into it, the
sound isolation between the rooms and the outside was really good.  This made
it easy to wonder from room to room and move into a different context each time.

I must say that there were indeed some amazing goddesses in the house that
night, Some of the women I had seen out at parties but didn't recognize them
because they were literally ... transformed.  The party reminded me of the
Your Sister's House of old but the energy was stepped up an Octave, perhapse
it was
the Comet up in the sky. If you went out to the roof area you could clearly
see it, as the big Fuzz Ball in the sky, those that couldn't see it could
definitely feel it's influence that night.  I'm told by many of my female
friends that their periods have been thrown off by this hairy star, let's
see what doom awaits us this spring.

Sunset was the amazing party that I knew it would be, Galen thank you and
crew so much for keeping the Faith and the Party alive.  Thanks for working
with the local authorities so that they see that it's nothing wrong with what
we do.  Thanks for letting those NYC DJs from the Chocolate Factory rock
SF on a Ney York Stylee, and thanks for showing my newbie friend his first
real Rave :) Yeah and thaks to Kevin,Jerry and Hector of Organic for bringing
those guys out here.

Just wanted to send this to all of you, I am starting a chain hug!!!! 
:) 
pass it on!

HUUUUUUUUuuuuuug!

----------------------------------------------
Hugging is healthy.  It helps the body's immune system, it keeps you 
healthier, it cures depression, it reduces stress, it induces sleep, 
it's 
invigorating, it's rejuvenating, it has no unpleasant side effects, and 

hugging is nothing less than a miracle drug.

Hugging is all natural.  It is organic, naturally sweet, no pesticides, 
no 
preservatives, no artificial ingredients and 100 percent wholesome.

Hugging is practically perfect.  There are no movable parts, no 
batteries 
to wear out, no periodic check-ups, low energy consumption, high energy 

yield, inflation proof, nonfattening, no monthly payments, no insurance 

requirements, theft-proof, nontaxable, nonpolluting and, of course, 
fully 
returnable.

Megan,

        You have as much sympathy from me as a male is capable of.  Because
we can't experience what women go through, we'll never be 100% sensitive to
the situation, but we can do our humble best (those of us who care, that
is).  I hope everyone finds ways to help each other through all of life's
difficulties, including biological ones.  That's part of the concern for
others that motivates me.

Live and be well!

[ to sfraves list ]

 Can someone here on SFRaves pass a hint from me to whoever made the
voicemail greeting for VELVET SHOP in San Jose ? I just tried calling
the info number [ (408) 235-1556 ] , and it sounds like either someone
is getting cute with a pitch shifter , or the voicemail greeting is
stuck in fast forward. It's hard to tell from the cute chipmunk voice
what the hell the address is.

 By the way - does anyone know where Velvet Shop will be this Thursday?
I haven't been to it in ages ! I'm going this Thursday ( if I can find
it ).

The original of Voices Inside My Head was absolutely a Police original.
The Police started around 1977, and nothing they released on record during
their career as a band was ever a cover.  They were masters at blending
elements of ska, reggae, punk and rock, were one of my favorite bands and
immensely popular when I was in high school, and were (& are) very talented
musicians.

Here endeth the lesson :)

for no other reason than I didn't feel like leaving and the cold didn't 
bother me very much, I left Sun & Warren to crash in the Honda Civic 
while I made the rounds with a trash bag and no flashlight. Ended up 
staying till around 10 (?) when the park ranger kicked me out and even at 
that point I kept stumbling across random ash tray squats. We need either 
a vacuum cleaner or fewer smokers.

Ended up scoring 30 cents, 1 pipe (no pot but an OK amount of resin), and 
1 razor blade (ouch!).

This is more in regards to Eric's post of a week or so ago regarding 
raves and sex drive. Sex is one of the few "acceptable" ways for men
in our society to give and recieve affection, especially with other
adults. This is not true in our little world. So it is not really 
surprising that finding your need for affection met, your sexual 
"need" is not as strong. I find the same thing happening to me, to a
certain extent.

Hugs,
Jim

Velvet Shop is at 4th St Bowl in Downtown SJ.  Somewhere on 4th st, I'm not
sure of the cross street.

 Can someone here on SFRaves pass a hint from me to whoever made the
voicemail greeting for VELVET SHOP in San Jose ? I just tried calling
the info number [ (408) 235-1556 ] , and it sounds like either someone
is getting cute with a pitch shifter , or the voicemail greeting is
stuck in fast forward. It's hard to tell from the cute chipmunk voice
what the hell the address is.

 By the way - does anyone know where Velvet Shop will be this Thursday?
I haven't been to it in ages ! I'm going this Thursday ( if I can find
it ).

okay, you forgot florida's "blowin up" and some east coast kidz say
"trippin on e".  i didn't realize this sort of slang was regional till like
a year ago...and then once in toronto when i mentioned something about
"rolls" to someone they sed "rolls?  what the fuck are rolls?"...another
drug related term is one i wish ppl didn't have to apply to parties around
here but have to too much, and that's "in a hole"...yikes, let me say it's
impossible for a vibe to exist at a party when half the kidz there are k'd
outta their heads.  lesee...what about "zooted"?

Ok, it's getting to be about that time that I've GOT to get out of the 
Concord area!!

So, for anybody who's interested, this is what I'm looking for:

I am looking to move out of my current apartment and move into a house 
somewhere in the Berkeley/North Oakland area.  I will probably begin 
looking for places in May with the intention of doing the actual move 
in June.  I'm not in any situation where I'm required to move, so this 
time around I'm really going to take the time to find the perfect place 
& a nifty roommate to share the place with.  Last time I was in a 
desperte situation to find a roommate and ended up with a religious 
Catholic fresh out of rural Minnesota for the first time in his life!  
A nice guy of course, but is not someone who is "on my level" if you 
know what I mean.  So this time I will search for & find a roomie more 
on that level with me! :)  Hence my posting to sfraves about this, a 
raving roommate would be much more to my liking!  Anyway, to begin 
with, what I'm looking for is one roommate who can afford about the 
same as I can ($600-$650 a month) so we can get a fat house!  I am 
definitely looking for a house this time, not an apartment, preferably 
with a bathtub & fireplace! :) (don't know how feasible this is, but 
something cool might just pop up, I have the time to look!)  As far as 
the roommate is concerned, male or female, gay or straight, whatever, 
is fine.  I work a normal 8-5 monday thru friday job, so I guess I'd 
want somebody who's more quiet on the weekdays (someone who probably 
works similar hours as me I suppose & thus doesn't rage loudly into the 
weekday nights ;), but does whatever on the weekends!  I have a very 
sweet cat (has not yet once made a mistake in any other area other than 
her catbox, & always uses her scratching posts!).  I have an apartment 
full of furniture, so someone with less than a complete set of 
furniture is just fine.  I would probably (due to my cat) prefer 
someone who didn't have a dog, but another cat would be fine.  Also, of 
course, would like an area that's safe for us to live in & safe for my 
cat to go outside & play. 

If anybody is interested, please email me privately & we'll talk about 
it!  I think that's about it, if I can think of anything I left out, 
I'll post it as a P.S. 

thanks!

Love,
Shawna

For no other reason than I didn't feel like leaving & the cold didn't 
bother me very much, I let Sun & Warren crash in the Chevy Nova and made 
the rounds with my trash bag and no flashlight till the park ranger guy 
kicked me out at around 10 (?). Even at that time there were still many 
clumps of cigarette butts and ash tray camps throughout the area. Next 
time we need either a vacuum cleaner or fewer smokers.

Ended up scoring 30 cents, 1 pipe (no pot, some resin), and a razor blade 
(ouch !).

zooted means you're having a lot of fun with the aid of mad chemicals.  (i
hate to say "fucked up" because i think that is a term more applicable to
sobriety).  there's another one, "mad", tho it's more east-coastal.  mad, a
lot, many.  example from a wu-tang track:  "niggaz i know, be runnin'
around wit mad fukkin cash!!".  "mad cash" could also be worded "tall
bank".  hip hop terms are used a lot too.  personally i use "dope" a lot
and sometimes "fresh" or "live".

Besides being a place in India, the DJ Goa Gil is an older, dreadlocked, 
fantastic master of hard trance. He's been spinning for about twenty 
years, but didn't really get accepted into the SF scene until about last 
year or so, when trance got more popular. He used to go on tour a lot, 
but recently he's been around more. He is completely amazing - sort of 
the grandaddy of trance, and the two times I've seen him were two of the 
best parties I've ever been to. He does stuff with DATs, not just records 
and travels to India and all over putting on epic parties. I know that 
some friends of mine were planning to go to India for a party; I don't 
know if that already happened. Anyway, that exhausts my limited 
knowledge, which I hope is accurate. You could try to see him sometime.

Yeah, whenever I wear pants that drag on the floor, like bell-bottoms, 
man there is always this grey ring of dirt.  I think some comes from the 
porta-potties---YUK---and I am always scared to touch it.  I always find 
myself in the porta-potty trying to hold up the bottom of my pants so 
they don't get dirty.  It's pretty close to impossible, what with trying 
to pull down your pants to go to the bathroom, squat over the gross 
sludge, and relieve yourself.  AAAhhh, it's those times when I long for 
male anatomy.  tee hee hee  :) :)

With the couple of opinions about the music at last week's sunset, I just
must reitterate (sp?) my view here.  THAT WAS- WHAT IT IS!  I can't get
enough of that shit!  To me that defines the S.F. sound.  You felt it lacked
the beat, mabye it was the underpowered system, I don't know, but Man,

Subject: A growing family 
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I was kickin' back at a friends house last saturday and the Grind on MTV's
spring break came on (we were bored).  They weren't playin' the normal club
beats but rather some great house tunes I hear alot now and last year at
raves.  A few trible tracks, "disco's revenge"(only name I remember), and
some other housey beat.  At first I thought "Hey, I love these songs." but
then I realized, it's really started - House is getting very mainstream.  I
was in Tower yesterday and noticed their Ambient/Tecno section had doubled
since the last time I had been in there (a few months) and there were
several new club/dj/rave magazines on the shelves (I had never noticed
before).
   My Point: I love music, especially new music that isn't main stream.  I
got into house/techno in 93 because it was new, impresive, mind opening and
I love to dance - not because it's popular.  Growth is not all bad as long
as our family doen't progress in the wrong direction.  Sunset was huge for
me too but it seemed almost everyone knew the meaning of Peace, Love, Unity
and Respect (you can't expect everyone to help clean up some have to
go/some are too fu*ked to help - I did my part.).  There seems to be a new
influx of newbies to the sence.  IMHO I think we should all make sure we
help each other out and show the newbies the true path of what rave is all
about.  Many people are going to come into our family this year. Keeping
the vibe strong and true is the only way to keep the everyone happy and to
ensure a great year.  Keep the underground, on the down under.  On a post I
read titled "new dawn"(I don't remember who wrote it), the author mentioned
that they noticed this growth too and were moving their tastes to jungle
beats to escape the popularity of house.  I've notice my tastes move to
more break beats and goa/trance but as long as the vibe is still there I
will continue to enjoy all forms of music in our family.

I agree that the sound system was a crucial element; not nearly enough low
end.  Sometimes it's good to feel the music not bouncing off you, but
moving THROUGH you!  That's how it was when I saw Pantera (I know, I know)
at the San Jose Event Center, when they played with Sepultura (and I just
KNOW y'all wish you were there - hehe!).  The sound really does something
to your body when it feels like that.  Maybe not goo all the time, though.
>From what I understand, SF is house-dominant; if so, SteveO's comments
epitomize the SF flava...
As for the mainstream...let 'em come, I say, and check it out.  Maybe some
will begin to understand, even embrace, what it means to us.  Then they'll
BE us!  Maybe that's long-range thinking...?

Unity,

Hello All,


It's me...Marty from Fresno.  I just wanted to write, say hi, and say 
that I had an excellent time at my first Sunset.  

Thank you Todd (SDream) for wearing the balloon so I could find you.  It 
was great to finally meet some people from the list...Kaysee, Leslie, 
Moonpup, Wille, Becca, Joe, Dave, the pretty blonde girl sitting on the 
ice chest (didn't get your name), and I'm sure others I'm forgetting.  
Forgive me :)

Anyway,  I'm on Spring Break next week and I'll definitely be around on 
the weekend coming up.  Anyone planning on going to the party on Sat 
afternoon in Golden Gate Park?

Hugz and more HUGZ...
Marty

interesting thing i learned in a looooonnnnngggg discussion of goa trance
that went on on mw-raves a few months ago (november actually i think, you
can learn A LOT from it [i sure did] so check the archives if you are
interested), the music was never actually meant to be mixed & beatmatched,
etc, it was always played track to track off of DAT in india because vinyl
would warp in the the intense heat of goa...

I went there several weeks ago. Not very many people, good music and videos
of the Star Wars movies. Not much happening when I was there but nice to
have a drink and talk with a friend. According to a recent posting to this
list the Mos Eisley Spaceport is supposedly no longer continued although
this was never confirmed as far as I know...

If you haven't had a chance to, i would strongly suggest checking out 
"The Rhythmatist" by Stewart Cope and "I Advance Masked" by Andy Summers 
and Robert Fripp.  I saw Andy Summers in concert several years ago with 
Tangerine Dream and it was verrrrry nice.

Also - the VERY FIRST Police single, if you can find it, is an absolute 
hoot - it's from way before they released Roxanne ... :) Eric, i hope 
you've heard it :)

I know this is nonrave, but since I got most of the comet mails
from this list[ and have found myself looking upwards all along
the drive home, lately], I am posting the following poem by 
Robert Frost (a native born San Franciscan whose birthday is today!):


ON LOOKING UP BY CHANCE AT THE
CONSTELLATIONS 

You'll wait a long, long time for anything much
To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud
And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves.
The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch,
Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud.
The planets seem to interfere in their curves
But nothing ever happens, no harm is done.
We may as well go patiently on with our life,
And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun
For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane.
It is true the longest drought will end in rain,
The longest peace in China will end in strife.
Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake
In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break
On his particular time and personal sight.
That calm seems certainly safe to last to-night.



Sorry if this mail pissed anyone off!
I found all the above chasing down CNN links

Hey, when you sweat, rub your eyes, pick your nose, whatever - then you
stick your hands in your pockets, on a wall, whatever, dry dust sticks to
the sticky moistness of your fingernail crevice, and, VOILA!!! It's a lot
more organic than dirt. Just FYI: thats how colds & flus get around. You
shake someone elses hand, then they get some of that virus-infested gunk and
the little guys start having another party. Welcome to the world of organic
life!!! Wet-naps would be nice at those warehouse parties....

	Hello everyone!
	Jana and I are living in a beautiful 3 bedroom house in Montclair 
(Berkeley/Oakland hills).  Two people have moved out, and we might have 
to as well, because we can't afford to stay here by ourselves (We really 
don't want to leave!).  We have two bedrooms available to share with 
individuals that  groove with us.
	The house is surrounded with trees, and good energy, but isn't 
close to public transportation.  We have a garage, washer/dryer, 
dishwasher, fireplace, deck, and 2 bathrooms.  A five minute walk will 
get you to beautiful forest preserves, that extend for miles.  Music can 
be played at all hours, however we're not looking to become a party 
house...    Rent is $1350.00  divided by 3 it's $450.00...  Divided by 
four it's $338.00,  plus utilities 
	Our personal interests are in music (trance/acid, tribal jams: 
drums, diges, etc.), organizing free events,  spirituality, and 
creativity.  We are vegetarian, loving, open-minded, honest creatures 
that enjoy evolving, and sharing.
	If you are interested, or have questions, please contact me at 
this address (SFR mail mostly), or my other one (mostly 
personal/business):  lmnt@immersivearts.org

	::one big hug to all of ya::

	e

ok, ive been reading all the "i wish sunset had trance" posts and came up 
with an idea - which begins with a question:

how many people here would support a free party in the marina focusing on 
trance?

Once again revealing my archaic history, I must relate that I saw the
Police on their first American tour (early 1979 I think) at the Atlantis
(later the 930) in DC.  They were driving around the country in a
station wagon or something.  I met up with Stewart Copeland's brother
Miles later that summer when I went to England, he was the publisher of
Time Out at that time.  Anyway, the Police didn't sound like anyone else
then and I liked the reggae-pop stuff.  They rocked the little 930 club
*hard*.  I'm still a big fan of much of their stuff, and think that
Ghost in the Machine is one of the 20 or 30 best albums I have.

Where I would draw the line is Sting's evident misogyny, which is always
peeking around the edges of his tunes but showed up most noticeably in
"Every Breath You Take," which no matter how you decide to interpret it
is pretty straightforwardly a banal ballad about stalking.

"Hungry for You," "Demolition Man" and the rest though -- they are great.
I played "Secret Journey" to start my set at the New Moon in Forestville
a year ago, and that turned out to be quite a premonition for a rather
cinematically gripping party . . .

Subject: All you comet-heads...
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

If y'all got time to read a good book or 2 or 3: 
Check these out

THE HAMMER OF GOD - by Arthur C Clarke (yes, the man who changed all of our
lives-he invented the communications satellite, ya know...)
Its a novel where everything mentioned about the past is fact and everything
mentioned about the future is intelligent prediction...Its about an asteroid
that got broken off its path and is pulled toward Earth.  It gives a great
history about past comet confrontations as wells as future political
insights (Like all the countries in the world having to get together to
figure this thing out) - I could not put the book down til I was done
reading, the main topic of the novel was how to deflect this massive chunk
of rock heading our way.

COMET - Carl Sagan & Ann Druyan 
This book is out of print but you can still find it in bargain sections and
Used book shops. It gives a complete history of comet study and tells you
everything you would want to know about comets. The 1st chapter is great -
he gives you a ride on a comet through its entire journey.  I think the most
interesting thing I learned from this book is about the hundreds of MILLIONS
of comets in our solar system (most of them are dormant, just waiting to be
pushed just a teeny bit to be pulled in by the sun's gravity).

LUCIFERS HAMMER - Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle 
A really great novel - what would happen to Earth and us after a comet would
hit us. It's really frightening, but really cool too, cause it gets into how
geologically things would be different (like the San Juaquin Valley becoming
the San Juaquin Sea), as well as social things, like how our society would
change, after as well as before, when it was discovered that the comet was
going to hit. Author Larry Niven's a wacky guy- he likes to get everyone
drunk at Sci-Fi converntions with his Irish Coffe stand.

---------------------------------------COMET
TRIVIA------------------------------------ 

Jupiter is our natural comet deflector. If it wasn't there, a
species-destroying comet or asteroid would hit us every 100,000 years,
instead of every 100,000,000 years (whew!).

In 1908 a comet hit Tunguska, Siberia and flattened 2000 square kilometers
of forest.
If it was delayed by 2 hours, Moscow would have been flattened.

One of NASA's prime projects is comet deflection. In 2126 the comet
Swift-Tuttle will make an approach that will be a little too close-
fragments of the comet would cause 100 Tunguska-equivalent explosions in ONE
DAY. But thats a long way off. I think our next-of-kin will have something
figured out by then. :}

there's plenty of chill jangool, perfect for (from what i understand of it,
realize i've never been to one but have heard plenty about it) sunset.

best song IMHO for any type of sunday day party:  jamiriquoi's (sp?) "space
cowboy" classic club david morales mix  mmmmmmm yummy and it makes da
ravahs smile...

love, luck, and lollipops,

I would most definitively support it with all of my heart (etc...)!!! We

> how many people here would support a free party in the marina focusing on 
> trance?

I love trance with all of my being - it has got to be my favorte music of 
all time.  But on a Sunday afternoon while 
still bleary-eyed and spacey, something a little slower and groovier is 
on my menu.  I'd personally be very torn.  I want to support all trance 
based parties, since I love it so much, but it may not be my first music 
of choice during that time of day.  Ever have certain kinds of music for 
certain moods, etc?   

love,
Amy

I just have to go on record saying I liked the music that was played at Sunset.

There were maybe a few too many people, but it was so amazing last year,
that I'm sure people talked about it all winter long.  So now, spring come
around again and everyone wants a piece.  Very understandable IMHO.

The sound system was adequate IMO.  I danced pretty far away from the
speakers and could feel the music coming through the ground up into my feet.
It was good enough for me.

The drum kit needed to go.  The guy had a few moments, but....I wish they
were the only moments.

Sometimes I get tired of people dissin House-I mean I love musical
variety,trance and the harder stuff is nice ,but my heart is with house and
last Sunset confirmed this for me again-house,the sunshine,shoulders
swayin, heads bouncing up&down under the tree branches,lights of the bridge
reflecting on the water...ya the sound system was kinda small ,as it has
been at every sunset I've been to, but this is probably a legal thing with
the rangers ect.

The 4 on the floor is great feel good grove but by the end of the night 
it didn't move me anymore.  We could have used some acid or trance 
thrown in there.  Goa would have been great because it is so smoothe.  
And you don't really have to speed it way up.  One of the great things 
I noticed about Goa records is they sound fantastic at just about any 
speed!

Austin said....  Jeno has a really cool mix
	of this song on his SOUL CREATION mixed tape, allong with a few
other songs played at sunset are featured on the tape.


I happen to LOVE Jeno...   he's the most consisently funky and dancable dj to me
-- and I have several of his tapes, but SOUL CREATION is my favorite -- and I
loved hearing the mixes at Sunset that echoed his mixes on that tape -- 

I also loved when whoever was spinning mixed in N'ssei N'ssei (totally off
spelling) which is northern African middle-eastern music  - I loved the music at
Sunset, found it to be actually ... musical ... rather than just constant hard
beats (a time and place for everything of course) .... 

See you all at Organic in the park Saturday!

I'm sure a little more bass could be coaxed out of the systems without it
being a problem.  At least I hope so, being a bass fiend!  As long as it
doesn't turn our brains to mush...

As I recall, I don't think I ever dissed house.  I said something
about not having beats I can dig my body into.  Goa trance, hard
trance and techno are perfect examples of this, when the beat is
too fast, I can't grove down into the beat.  Music needs to move my
body... and HOUSE (with it's million house derivatives) is definately the 
best music for this.

What I don't like is "bouncy" music where all I can do is jerk my body
to around.  I have a whole theory they was well-discussed on socal-raves
about how larger people (I'm 6-2) like slower tempo music... just becuase
we have more body mass to move around on each beat.  Smaller people can
move their body faster, and therefore may like faster music.  Remember, this
is just my silly theory, but I think there is some substance to it.

Reflecting back on Sunset, I think it was the more the size of the system,
and not the quality of the music, that kept me from getting into a deep
dancin' groove.

-troy... considerably less grouchy today.

OK, three days late but here's my two cents....

I liked that Sunset was so crowded, because for the most part I liked the crowd,
and it was nice to meet so many new people ....

I also loved the music, but wish it could have been louder -- oh well, how picky
we get, don't we! Having a free outdoor party like this in March, when other
parts of the US are sitting in snow or soaking in rain... we are truly the
fortunate ones!!

Interesting feedback on the drum kit guy ... I've already voiced my thoughts on
how drummers usually distract from djs --- I wonder how the djs felt about this
guy, and what it would take for a PLUR-oriented crowd to ask someone to move ...
There were some people with tamblas (tablas?) drumming for a while near where I
was sitting and I loved that....

and I loved meeting Amy, Rick, Marty, Knucklehead, Eric, Mike -- and seeing
other sfr buds (Todd, Moonpup, Mike, etc.) = )   

I'm hearing more people worried that the music we love is becoming more
mainstream -- like that's bad or something -- I think the potential problem is
not that more people are loving the music -- don't we think it's *so good* that
everyone would benefit from it?  Let's not be selfish with the music, and let's
not think that just because something becomes popular, it becomes less
interesting.  If it's good, it's good.  Period.

The potential problem is too many people at events -- so if this trend for the
huge Sunset crowd continues, maybe it is time to change the Pacific #, go a
little more underground on certain parties -- because what makes a party special
is the music PLUS the vibe, and having the right people in the right quanties
creates the vibe.....

My 2 cents of time is up....    See ya!    Leslie  : )

The only time I tried to go, just a few weeks ago, it didn't exist.  
Michelle and I went to check it out and didn't even go in.  We could tell 
from the live amateur rock band sound that it definitely *wasn't* part of 
the rave scene.  Pass.  If it exists at all, maybe we just caught the one 
night it was preempted by some special event.

Is it all gonna go mainstream,big time, above ground or totally
comercial??-look at the UK if you want to see a bleak future; totally
coporate, label sponsorships,dress codes,rock star DJ's, 45,000 people at
$30 "raves", ect- look at Dream, Mix Mag or any dance rag from the UK and
you'll see what I mean(or go there).  Today I saw a full page add by
Moonshine in the Gaurdian-whats that tell ya..it's gettin big here too? but
maybe not..

I dont have a problem with new people, it does'nt matter weather your first
party was Get Wicked in '91 or the last Sunset, whether you like acid house
or jungle, we were all newbies once.   Ya that sunset was huge and to go
mainstream would mean the end of something great, but it's not so much how
many people are stating to go to raves, but the motivations of these people
and most important; the motivations of the people who promote the parties
we go to, make the music we love- if that starts to be done ONLY for $$(and
thats what coporations are for, (dont try to tell me anything different!) 
than it's over.  
Some things I see tell me this might be comming...."raves" thrown by record
labels (just look at all those logos on the fliers), cd givaways at the
door(should'nt  you just want to go rather than be enticed be some stupid
marketing tactic!!), same goes with fliers that promise everything under
the fucking sun ,"special treats", dancing women, world brotherhood, peace,
sorry but these are mainsteam tactics , they are regressive and cheap! 
Sure, this has been going on for a long time, but one thing is different
and that is BIG companies are getting intrested (Levis,Virgin, ect)  How
would you like to see a flier with a McDonalds, Levis, MTV and Virgin logo
on it?-I've  this in Germany.  .  It's easy to prevent this-with your
wallet, dont go to parties that use these tactics, some might say;"come on
be realistic" well  whose realism?, what exactly does it mean to be
realistic-to give up on any ideals you have?  How' bout the focus be the
MUSIC and the vibe, everything else should come naturally.
Be on the lookout!!

A bi-weekly called Seismic is going on Thursday night in the city.  I
picked up a flier at MAD - resident dj's are Dan and DRC, with special
guests.  Only $5, and it tells us to bring candy and smiles :) :) .  Sounds
like a good one!  I might be heading out to it (but that would make 5
nights dancing in one week, a bit much, even for spring break!).

SFRaves Calendar lists the phone number.

Also I hear Roots at 1015 on Wednesdays is cool, Jeno, Garth, and tribal
drumming in the basement :) .

Yes, that tape is amazingly similar to the sets played at Sunset.  I have
that tape but never liked it (too soft for a trance-head like me), but
after Sunset we put it on in my car.  We were so entranced by the time
"Voices" came on, that we sat in the parked car in silence with our eyes
closed for an entire _hour_ grooving to the entire tape!

Trippin' to the music,

Since I wrote the critical post of the Sunset party, I will assume the
"you" moonpup is referring to is me.

Please don't think I don't have ultimate respect for the Pacific crew, just
becuase I wrote a critical review of their party.
  
> where were you when the mess was needed to be cleaned up ?...ask yourself ?

Well, "killer" is a subjective term... but I was involved with 3 outdoor
ODP (Open Deck Parties) with other socal-raves members while in Los Angeles...
I think these parties were killer.  I could give you names of sfravers
who were there to get their opinion, if you want.  I always try to do
whatever I can to help out at a free party.

Well, we have seen this sort of arguement over and over and over again
on rave mailing lists... the fine line between giving the scene Unconditional
Positive Support and giving honest reviews of parties.  Are you saying
that if I don't have anything good to say I should not say it all?  What
I see in our scene now is friendly competition to see who can throw the 
best free parties... it is is pushing our scene forward in an incredible
way.  I simply gave an honest review of what I thought of the party, and
I repeatedly stated that the opinions were mine.  If you think the party
was stellar, then great!  express those opinions.  But if we were never
critical of parties, I doubt you would see them improve much.

Word up, moonpup!  Since I'm still new to these different styles of music,
my feeling is "it's all good."  It's not good only when it's mixed poorly,
and that's not really the music, but the dj ("What do you say to the DJ?").
Even then, though, we all should have compassion for all djs; they're
doing what they love for us, because we love it, too!

Musically,

Can any SFRavers recommend any good ska bands who play regularly in the
San Francisco Bay area? I haven't gone to hear a local band in a
long time - the last ska band I've seen live is Bad Manners .

When we were at the Desert Move in & outside of Vegas last year some famous 
German DJ was spinning the hardest techno and tranciest nightmare in the middle 
of a Sunday afternoon (1:00 pm).  It was 100 degrees out, the sun was straight 
up, and pretty much everybody had been up for the whole weekend. There were about 
500 people standing around watching 10 Germans just go for it (in full black 
attire) in front of the stacks. Some of the same Germans who had earlier asked 
us, "how come ravers in the US don't do COKE?!!!" I'll never forget the look on 
my friends faces as we all preyed for for something a little easier on our souls. 
I mean it just wasn't an approporiate setting. 

 I like hard stuff too.
 There's a time and place for everything.
 Please, I've already been to hell once.

courtney,

there are so many different flavors of jungle and goa. to pass these styles
off as being too hectic for a sunday afternoon shows me you may not have had
much exposure to the various subgenres of jungle and trance. dj flux (who is
trying to get an opening spot at sunset) spins some of the best ambient
jungle i've heard. check him out at bahia on wed. nights. his vibe is quite
appropriate for the sunset atmosphere. if the beats are too fast for you,
then follow the basslines at halftime. talk about groovin'!!! house is cool
to groove to, but it just gets too boring the way the dj's at sunset spin.
they need to cut that shit up more, use some sampling/looping, and also some
processing effects, instead of just beatmixing from one track into the other.
that style is just too basic and unimaginative. 

ciao 4 now,

I hope that many, if not all, people who put on the parties in these parts,
as well as those who are thinking of getting into throwing parties in the
future, will take all reviews as building blocks fore creating parties that
everyone will enjoy.  More up-front info on what types of music will be
spun and basic aspects of the space would do wonders for helping people
decide which parties they should go to to get the most enjoyment out of
their experience.  Yes?

Thoughtfully,

Hell yeah!  I saw a killer ska band called Missing Link at a party
recently.  They are a 10 piece band, including sax, a horn section,
rappers, and a kick-ass **DJ** mixing tracks and scratching along with the
live instruments!  They play this Saturday night at Ashkenaz in Berkeley.

I'm afraid I have to agree.

First, though, much props to the Pacific crew for all the effort they put
out to throw the most awesome weekly outdoor party ever!  I think we can
all do our part to lessen some of their burden and make Sunsets even more
outrageous...like bringing trash bags, flashlights, teams to pick up
garbage, recycling boxes, etc.  I hate to think of all of them picking up
after us ingrates after all they have done!!

But I would also love to see Sunset expand from a dance party to a great
big Sunday rave picnic/bbq/gathering kind of thing.  I know someone on this
list has a giant BBQ - it would be cool to see it at Sunset.  Someone could
sell hamburgers and veggiedogs and tofuthingies for cheap.  Others could
bring salads and fruit and cookies and we could all EAT together like a
family.  Sharing food does establish a primal bond, much like dancing.

Now, the MUSIC.  Yes, this is Pacific's party and usually THEY are the dj's
and it is their right to play the music they (and many other Sunset
devotees) love.  But PERSONALLY, I do get bored with the straightforward
house.  There's no edge, no trippiness.  Maybe they could mix up the flava
a bit - ambient to begin, house for late afternoon, some deeper trancey
energetic grooves for later on, smooth it out again at the end?

The best raves bring you on a musical journey.  I find several hours of the
exact same type of music (of anything!) to be tiresome.  Variety!  Sunset
is great, but with all of our input on every aspect it could get even
better.  Anyone know if any Pacific crewmembers are on this list?

Cooperatively,
     Nancy

beautiful location to do it in!

Hey, that solves the dilemma, huh?  Slowed-down tripped-out trance for our
recuperating Saturdays or Sundays...

The SFSound has predominated for too long.  I know I've passed on many
parties when I get a flier promising "Jeno, Tony, Dan, Galen..."  I really
don't feel the same crowd response when this music plays (with the one
exception of the last Sunset!).  I search, often in vain, for mention of
Ethan or Dutch or DRC.  Goa and trance need the exposure!!

Eagerly awaiting trance-in-a-park,

Depends on the motivation of the promoters.  I bet the ones who throw free
events - the ones who give out of love - care about people's experience!
Yes, hopefully we can give and take criticism in the spirit it is meant -
to take us even higher, not to tear any of us down.

Once people have put in some time in the scene they know what dj spins what
kind of music...so they make their party choices based on that.  Also, you
can tell from the flier where the party will be.  For instance, an
underground, tiny flier = warehouse in the city, $5-10.  A 4-color,
fold-out, 15 dj's, bigtime lasers = some arena out in the 'burbs, or a
legal location in the city, $15-20.

Also if you see a lot of verbiage about unity and togetherness and dawning
of a new age...you can bet it will cost at least $20 to get in.  Hmmm,
experiencing love and community just gets more and more expensive, doesn't
it?  Beware of opportunists exploiting our ideals to fatten their own
pockets!!

I'm also very wary when the voicemail doesn't list price...every time I've
encountered this it's been $20.  :( .

Every day I'm getting closer to only supporting the true underground.  The
last Gathering - $25, several thousand people, beefy security guards -
turned me off so badly.  How do you guys feel about the massive "raves"?

Wondering,
   Nancy

I believe I've been to Sunsets that have done this very thing.  Many of last
years Sunsets started out with ambient, then slow beat stuff, to house, to
some crazy stuff at the end.

That is, if my memory serves me right.   .....Can anyone else testify to this.

I hope everyone read Mark's post - we do have to be vigilant about our
scene being co-opted!  There may not be any way to hold back the corporate
kidnapping of raving.  How far off are we now anyway with  major promoters
who promise "love" and "peace" in return for your $25?  The fact is is that
some parts of the scene have been exploited by individuals to make a
profit.  Corporate America has been remarkably shortsighted in dismissing
techno, still, as a fad and too risky an investment.  Pretty soon they'll
realize that the music is just expanding.  The crowds at Sunset testify to
techno/house and rave's increasing popularity.

So, "raving" (in the mainstream sense) will no longer be our little (big)
secret anymore.  But what we CAN hold onto is the values of the
UNDERGROUND.  We need to reiterate and promote these ideals in connection
with the smaller events for people coming in.  Otherwise, if people attend
undergrounds thinking they're just smaller Cool Worlds, they will not know
to leave their baggage at the door and enter with open heart, open mind,
open arms and a big smile!

Is there a way we can maintain the purity of these parties, so that they
endure despite the arrival of newbies?  Can we structure the experience in
such a way that it will stand on its own, aside from the people?  By that I
mean an experience that is love and unity, and if someone comes in with
negativity they will not corrupt the vibe, but recognize it is not for them
and go elsewhere...?

I'm remembering the drunk guys at Sunset looking for "bitches," but finding
instead an ecstatic groove.  Now, these guys probably are not suddenly
enlightened feminists, but on Sunday they had to check those attitudes at
the dancefloor :) .

What can each of us do individually to strengthen that special vibe?  For
my part, I'm trying to remember to smile more, look in people's eyes more,
say hello first, bring presents, hug first, join a hand-holding circle,
start a group hug!  I'm also being very selective in which events I support
with my time, energy, and money.

This was at the end of the beautiful message thrust into my hand at
Something Special --
"Ravers Unite and keep our scene alive!!"

Amen.
Love, Nancy

Hi, everybody!  I don't have access to e-mail until Saturday, so I will
definitely be going through major withdrawls ;) !

I was hoping you all would post what you're doing this week-end, so I can
get them on Saturday, and have some input on what to do and who to see that
night!

I'm actually thinking of Lucky Charms (temporarily disregard my anti-big
rave tirade of earlier post), because a few people REALLY want to go.  But
if Chrysalis happens, I'M THERE!!  Might be at Seismic Thursday night.
Also Organic in the Park Saturday.

No advance wardrobe planning - but look for Cookie Monster on a backpack,
and either lavendar or bright green beanie, perched on top of 5'5"
dark-haired ravechick.

Lots of love,
Nancy

Yeah, I played ambient and dub/hedfunk to open this Sunset and Solar picked 
things up with some jazzy mellow house after that.

The only problems I have with the huge events are: the price (over $20 is
too much for ANY party, IMHO), and the guys with flashlights who shine
light in your eyes and say "You're pretty messed up, aren't you?" and
laugh.  You wonder if they're narcs, security, gangstas, or what...also, I
find the smaller parties to have a more unifying, family feel among the
crowd, and the djs at smaller parties strike me as caring more about how
the crowd receives what they're doing.  I stand by a statement I made a
while back: if you want to shell out the big bucks to watch a performance,
go see a concert.  I'll bet no one can find as strong and deep and
wonderful a vibe at any show as at the right party; it's so nice that what
one gets out of a party is not directly proportional to the $$ they put in.

Party on!

>styleeeeee!!!! big up all junglists!

let's clear something up right now.  i'm ALL FOR underground parties.
doesn't mean you can't play somethin cuz it's on a major label.  or because
it's hella old.  jesus, newcleous' "jam on it" came out in 83 and it still
blows up parties.  i say if it makes da kidz happy, play it.  that's why
the dj's that try to impress other dj's before they try to make ppl dance
are never quite as good IMO.

but as a junglist i can see how you'd have the "fresh is best" attitude
towards da choons.  oh well.

love, luck, and lollipops,

For those that mentioned food and music at Sunset. I am, along with other,
planning the SFR BBQ & BEATS PICNIC PARTY. Some of the details are as
follows.
 
Saturday May 4th, at a location not yet determined, there will be plenty of
BBQ both meat and veggie, and many side dishes. It will be around Noon to
about 8-9pm. I'll have my 6 foot long BBQ there for everyone to use. There
will also be (if all goes well) 5 or 6 DJ's. There will be rib, chicken,
burger, hot dogs, veggie burgers, salads and other great picnic food. With
help from people that showed interest in helping out, we should have
different dishes of food. It won't be enough to feed 100's of people so it is
encourage that if you want to lend a hand to bring alittle food with you.
There will be alot of room on the BBQ to reheat food. I'll even bring my
coleman stove. So if your interested, drop me a line. If everyone chips in,
this can be a great Picnic and Party.

I'd like to add, that if anyone that is planning on throwing a party picnic
type event and would like to use my BBQ feel free to let me know. It's about
5-6 foot long and about 3-4 foot wide. I've used it at many BBQ cookoffs and
is great.

It is at :

I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know how bad it is personally, but I heard
it is really bad.

I have a currious mind.  I'm going.

An amazing set, I might add.  We arrived early, so we could hear Joe's 
set and were glad we did.  Just bummed more people did not get to enjoy 
it.  Joe you are the king at spinning ambient/dubby stuff.

CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is great... it is crucial to growth.
Unfortunately too many ppl do not know how to criticize without 
hurting others (themselves too!)

Troy, I didn't thoroughly read your initial post so I can't make fair 
comment on that one. Your response  to Moonpup seems a little 
too defensive, aggressive but you bring up a good point about the 
importance of honest criticism.

Moonpup, I think your post is constructive, positive, good.

I wonder what others on the list think about criticism.
(maybe I take art training into too many aspects of life)

X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 1.4>

Sorry, this is non rave, but the people on here are pretty cool and I'd feel 
more comfortable having some of the folks here adopt one of my hamsters than 
most people.

Yup, nature has performed it's little miracle again (dang it) and I'm now 
the proud uncle of yet another brood of baby hamsters.  Geez I wish I could 
tell these little suckers apart...  Anyway, so far I see 4 babies, but the 
night is young...  These are Russian Dwarf hamsters, about half the size of 
your average Teddy Bear hamsters.  Short hair, brown and grey with a black 
stripe down their back.  Some are albino, which I'm told is quite rare.  
Amazingly cute, very friendly, lot's of energy.

And they love to rave.  Really!

Anyway, I've got far too many of these little guys to care for.  If I take 
them to the pet store, I'm afraid they'll end up as fodder for the reptiles. 
 Please help me find them a home!  They're free!  Just take them off my 
hands!  You can have a baby, once they're weaned, or an adult.  At *this* 
point, I know which ones are males and which are females.  Take two and I'll 
give you a little Habitrail-type house to take them home in.

HELP!

Damm!!!  That is bad.  I have never seen anything that distasteful in my
life.  Definetley white trash.  Photo #12 with the feet on the ottoman and
"All In The Family" on the T.V. screen?  These people are sick.  Some might
think I am for looking it up or posting this though, I guess I have some what
of a sick sense to me then.  That one guy needs to loose the socks or least
put on the biker boots.  Come on, guy.  I don't find humor in this, just a
slight curriousness and maybe a little chuckle here and there, but that is
it. Otherwise I think it is totally sick and like I said, VERY distasteful.

(sorry moonpup, I had to reuse the title - it works with my point)

OK   Sunset is on suday the day after all the "great" parties.
It's a day you go out to pt. Molate or the marina and kick it w/ friends,
listen to MELLOW ambient and house and relax away the rest of the weekend.
Pacific has put on this "free extra day of partying for all ya'll".  If
someone  doesn't like the style - they shouldn't go.  Go check out the End
Up or Spundae if you want to grove to something harder on Sunday.  I have
always had a great time at sunset and I always will because - the vibe is
good, my friends are there, my 2nd family is there (all of you) and good
music is playing (it's also free).

Another thing to add - the last three dj's were from NY, not SF.  So this
shouldn't reflect on the type of party sunset is when JUST SF dj's are
playing.  I have heard some fasted, groovier, slower, and harder types of
music at various sunsets.   Go to a few sunday parties and then make
judgements and "changes" about the party.

This post is not directed at anyone in paticular but rather as a general
statment of my opinions and observations about sunset parties.

I think snoppy said it best:  "Happiness is sunsets"

I have seen Blue Beat Stompers who opened for No Doubt at the Berkeley 
Square.  The stompers were a very good, peppy ska band and had about 7 
members including horns etc. all lined up at the front of the stage in 
this wall'o'sound.  No Doubt followed and what a show!  throbbing energy 
and just a mash of happy people goin' off to discofunk/ska and it was 
just about as vibey as any old rave except more body contact involved.

Todd,

One time I had a hamster.  His name was Mr. Bill, (named after the then 
very famous clay character on Sat. Night Live.)  Mr. Bill was a 
second-hand hamster from a school friend.  He had an interesting life. 
One time he fell in the fishbowl and went swimming.  He didn't like 
swimming and I had to fish him out.  Then another time he was strolling 
around the house in his clear plastic ball.  He powered right through 
the barracade in front of the stairs, and went bouncing and rolling 
down.  Then in the summer of '80, we had a tornado.  Our house, our 
street, our side of town was distroyed.  He was lost.  I felt very bad. 
Two weeks after the tornado, a bulldozer and very big pick-up trucks 
were clearing the rubble from our property.  A worker looked down, and 
there was Mr. Bill, walking through the rubble!  We scooped him up and 
put him in a new cage.  He never talkied about those 2 weeks on his 
own in the rubble, but he seemed very happy to be back in domesticity.  
He thrived and had a happy little life.  About a year later, he stuffed 
his cheeks too full, and got trapped in the doorway of his little red 
and yellow sleeping house.  He died the way he wanted to, with his mouth 
full of food.

WOW is all i have to say :)  Angelika and Tracy and I all went driving to 
Lions Bay to do a little viewing.  Out away from the city ... the sky was 
unbelieveable.  I always forget how heartbreakingly beautiful the stars 
are.  The comet's tail was faint but stretched allllll the way over to 
the Big Dipper .... and through binocs it looked even better.  We ended 
up just plain ol stargazing with a chart and everything trying to see 
what we could see.  Too bad Andromeda had already set, i wanted another 
peek at M31 :)

The Planetarium in Vancouver has telescopes set up for anyone who wants 
to have a look before it's gone forever ... for people our age, anyways :)

Then i went to MaRS and had a kickin time bouncing around to Prettyboy's 
set, ut left when Donald came on.  This is the first time i've ever seen 
him (i can hear the gasps!) and i don't know if it was just me or what 
but i didn't find him all that enthralling .... oh well :) at least i got 
to experience him for a while, which was the whole point :)

gotta run now - up too late - i'm gonna PAY for this at work tomorrow!!

       Time for another mountain jam, this time around we're calling it 
the "Big Mountain Boogie".  Dust off your camp gear and set your sights 
on Willits in the heart of Mendocino County. Our main crew will be 

      TONY         CARLOS         JOSH         JOHN HOWARD

          TRACY     GALEN       SOLAR      ALEX WINDSOR

   Odd hours ambience and other far out beats to be provided by

           ALLEN      ANDREW     NATHAN     DJ CRACK    

  
  That should be more music than can fit on anyones plate but if you're 
still hungry save room for free pancakes and fruit on Sunday morning at 
the outdoor kitchen. If thats not enough you can always hike to the top 
of the mountain and check out the springs and the meadow up there. 
  We'll make sure there's plenty of wood to heat the hot tubs so be 
ready for a good soak or you can always take a dip in the swimming hole 
at the nearby Eel River. 
  The music will be continuous from noon on Saturday until midnight or 
later on Sunday night. Folks with tickets who want to show up early are 
welcome to start camping Friday afternoon and and everyone is free to 
stay until Monday morning.

  The gardens are sure to be in full bloom 
           we'll be dancing under the silvery moon,
              can't wait it'll be here soon!!!!!!!!

Well, I've found that only massive rave I support now a days **IS** The 
Gathering.  Despite the size, Martin's raves have always delivered a 
tremendously good vibe.  He's never failed in the more than 3 years I 
have been attending his events.  But, like you Nancy, I am now supporting 
more than ever the smaller underground parties.  Just my personal 
preferance and it is kinder to my wallet. :)

Just for my quick 2 cents:  I hope raves never never NEVER NEVER 
***NEVER*** become mainstream!!!!!!!!!  
NNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't see how they would ever become mainstream, as they're drugfests
much more than any concert (and I use concert here as an example of a
mainstream event).  It just wouldn't be condoned by major corporations,
IMO.

Keep it real!

Hey all,

The last Diversity turned out real good.  Marc did a better job 
describing it than I could so I'll leave it at that.  Unfortunately the 
bar and door didn't make enough money to compete with rock shows so for 
now it won't be happening again on Thursdays.  The good news is 
wednsdays are ok.  The next one is being planned for Wednsday April 
24th.  This is to allow time for better promotion.  Hopefully every 
raver in Sacramento will be able to turn out and show the Boardwalk 
what it means to Rock the house!!!!

I guess you just mean in our country.  Raves are very mainstream
elsewhere.

> I don't see how they would ever become mainstream, as they're drugfests

Easy: make them into cool places to just hangout.  Start serving/selling
food & drink, supply BBQ facilities.  Also invite musicians/drummers for
some freeform jamalongs.  Focus on fashions and rave accessories so
people will know what their supposed to wear.  Make sure the DJs play
the oldies, especially remixes of 80's hits.  Better yet, have DJs that
take requests so everyone is happy.  Promote sport activities like 
hackysak so all the non-dancers have stuff to do.  Encourage costumes, 
and mimes, you have to have mimes.  Alchohol and drugs are ok cause
that's cool, except that the smell of all that cooked meat will keep most 
of the real drug users away anyway, which is probably just as well.

In Europe, raves are sponsored by major corporations.

Thanks for opening my eyes!  Man, commercialized raves sound like a scary
thing.  This strengthens the argument to keep supporting the underground
scene, to keep it authentic.  When I get to Europe, I'll check out their
idea of the rave scene; I wonder if there's an underground thang over there
like we have over here (?).

Peace,

In this case, I would have to disagree with that.  I think that major 
corporations will condone anything that'll make 'em a big quick buck, so 
they will go ahead & promote the hell out of massive rave events like they 
do concerts (can you picture it? "Bill Graham Presents and Budweiser bring 
you 'Friends & Family' live via satellite from the Shoreline Amphitheater!" 
Bleh!), they just won't promote the drug aspect of it.  However, I'm sure 
they'll sell $4 cups of bud light! :P  But really, I seriously don't think 
that drugs will keep those Big Bad Boys of the Almighty Dollar from doing 
wahtever they can to capitalize on our events, should it come to that.

RE: "BSP" and "BP" , Nancy asked -
> 
> I feel like a newbie - what do these mean??
> 
 "BSP" is a short three character charm used to ward off any posting
purity demons on SFRaves. The letters stand for Blatent Self Promotion.
Using this in the Subject: line of the post is supposed to warn
readers that the poster has a commercial and/or ego involvement in
the topic of the posting - for example, a DJ posting about a rave
that the DJ is going to be spinning at.

 "BP" is a varient on "BSP" , meaning a post about an event that the
poster does not have a commercial stake in , but still feels strongly
about in some way.

Hey all,

  Since I have been on the list for almost 8 months now without anything
close to an introduction about myself, I suppose it is about time.  

  My name is Megan, I am 17 years old, attend San Ramon Valley High School in
Danville, (will be attending SFSU come August).  I'm 5'7", 113.8 lbs., red
hair, green eyes, blaah,blaah,blaah.  My raving experience is limited (only
2) but I consider myself a raver in philosophy, mainly PLUR, I try very hard
not to judge people based on appearance but I will be the first to admit if
someone attractive catches my eye I only wonder if the person is nice, kind,
loving, etc., afterwards (I'm just a little shallow).  I will help anyone in
need if I can help in any way.  Am very considerate and sensitive to the
feeling of other. 

  I have lived in various locations in the Bay Area my entire life but only
recently began to appreciate what SF and outlying areas have to offer.  I
love roller coasters, music of all kinds, driving, magazines with glossy
pictures, beautiful people of all shapes and size, and sushi.  I will try
(almost) anything once and try to have a good time doing it.  I am very shy
but am prone to go wild under the right circumstances...atmosphere... people
around me.

There is my intro.  
   Hope to see everyone soon.
            Megan
                 Czefir

Okay, forget Lucky Charms -- Chrysalis is on!!  Hmm, 350 tickets - I guess
that means Acme, right?  That's okay with me, I've always had oodles of fun
in the Gallery.

Let's populate the party with SFR'ers!  I actually have an outfit planned -
I dare you NOT to find me in bright orange bell bottoms and a raveshirt
that says "I Take Candy from Strangers!"  ;) . And of course, my faithful
companion will be toted along, baby Cookie Monster.

Very much looking forward to Chrysalis!  This will be my first (somehow
always missed them before :( .
Have a good weekend everybody...I'm enjoying the last of the quiet days in
Berkeley.  The hordes are soon returning from their spring breaks spent
sunning on exotic beaches... Well, some of us have had quite a lot of fun
right here! ;) .

What was that "party" at the Oakland Kaiser Auditorium awhile back?

Seemed to me that was some attempt at mainstreaming "rave culture", 
but I didn't go and didn't talk to anyone that went, so I don't 
really know.

Does anybody else out there know about it?

Ok, I've read all the complaints (and the good stuff too)....
GIVE THESE GUYS A BREAK!  IT'S ONLY THE FIRST ONE.
I'm sure as the summer rolls on that the parties will explode and be up 
to everyone's liking :)       Let's have patience my friends.

Dune,  in the desert with the comet
By Crunchman - A review

Well,   I finally hooked up with a ride to Dune,  thanx to Dean who I
met at Basics the week before.

Dean arrived on Friday evening after waking up in early evening.
Dean has this nighttime job,  sleeps during the day,  so after he
arrives,  I start packing my camping gear in preparation for heading
out into the desert.    The distance was exactly 450 miles from my
driveway to where the car was parked at the gig.

We left at exactly 2 am on Saturday morning,  and got back exactly
at 2 am on Monday morning.

We drove through the night,  down I-5, one of the loneliest hi ways
on earth it seems,  taking in the most incredible views of the comet
from the central valley.   We arrived around noon on Saturday,
using the directions we got from KC,  one of the promoters.

When we arrived,  nothing was there,  which gave us thoughts that
perhaps it wasn't going to be going off,  so Dean who drove the entire
distance got some sleep while I explored the rocks and watched the
dirt bikers scrambling around,  and a few people shooting off 20
gauge shotguns for target practice.   Eventually,  a ranger from the
bureau of land management showed up and approached our car,
asking if everything was OK.   Dean was chilling in the car,  and I was
talking to the ranger who I learned was Barry.   Barry indicated
there was going to be a race,  and asked if I know the promoters,
which I said I didn't.  Barry indicated that KC had all the permits
arranged for the party,  and asked me what A rave was.   I told him
it was a spiritual dance celebration being somewhat evasive about
the other aspects of raving.   Eventually Barry took off in his pickup
and left us to chill.

An hour or so later, Barry shows up and informs us the rave was on
the other side of the rocks,  so I head over there to see the people
with the generator,  but the sound system and KC hadn't arrived yet.

I did meet a few of the other promoters,  and noticed them with
Barry,  probably informing them where the bikers race route was set
so people wouldn't get hurt by climbing over the bike route during
the race.

As the sun was setting,  the sound crew was busy at work,  setting
up the JBL Shredder sound system,  lights,  and other stuff.   We go
off to fix dinner in anticipation for raving our asses off...

At about 10 pm,  the sound started,  but there was perhaps about 40
people there,  and few people dancing.   But cars were streaming in
as we watch them out over the desert,  and the rave was filling up.

KC started out with house music,  and eventually about 500 people
showed up by about midnight.   It was very cold and windy,  but we
didn't much care because the energy of the music and dancing really
kept us all warm.

By about 1 am,  there were at least 1000 people present,  as the
party WENT OFF big time.   The comet in the sky,  along with the
visuals provided us with some great "eye candy" as well as other
candies.

I met a lot of SoCal ravers,  and was surprised to see a lot of them
knew me from visiting SF.   But despite a few people knowing me,  a
lot more didn't know me,  and being a stranger was kinda
interesting,  as it reminded me of Australia when I first arrived.
Seeing all these new faces was really great.   The vibe was excellent,
and surprising to me,  based on other people's impressions of the LA
scene.

The music was excellent...  a little slower trance than I'm used to but
when Thee-o went on at 7 am,   things really went wild as the BPM's
were suddenly increased to about 145-150,   I WENT OFF big time,
but by about that time,  a lot of people stopped dancing and were
chilling by the side.  I went completely ballistic,  getting down to
some serious dancing to some amazing Goa trance.

By that time,  the sun had warmed things up a lot,  and I shed all my
warm clothes.    I must have danced Thee-o's entire set.
INCREDIBLE...   After Thee-o,  things slowed down a bit,  so I took an
opportunity to go out in the desert and trip around.

The music kept going until about noon....   Some young girl had
apparently passed out,  as the medics arrived to take her to the
hospital.   A chopper came in and lifted her out...   Hope she's going to
be OK.  Other than that incident,  things went very well.   I didn't
even notice the dirt bike race...

We hung around and helped clean up the place,  and finally left
around 2 pm or so and headed north.

Dean had managed to get some sleep and made it almost halfway
back before deciding to rest.   We stopped at a Pickle park (Rest
area) for about 6 hours of sleep and took off again about 11:30 pm
for the remainder of the trip to arrive home at 2 am.

Subject: Something Special message + (long)
Cc: aditya@mh1.well.com
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Nancy has commented at least twice on the xeroxed message handed out near
the end of Something Special last Sat., and I just found it again.  It's
appropos given the threads on the scene's growing pains, so I wanted to
share it (i hope the something special folk don't mind).  with my comments
it will be a slightly long post.

the original was all in capital typewritten letters, with a few words in
bold; i'm putting it in upper & lowercase with bold words in  ALL CAPS:


Why are you at this event?  The rave scene is NOT just about techno.  This
scene is NOT just about drugs.  This scene is NOT just about fashion.  It
is something special about UNITY and HAPPINESS.  It is about being yourself
and being loved for it.  It should be a harbor from our society.  But our
scene right now is disintegrating!  Old style ravers- remember when
everybody hugged all the time- not just to say hello and goodbye?  Remember
when people just said hi for no reason except to be your friend?  Remember
how good that felt?  Why don't we do it anymore?  Newcomers- you are wanted
and you should know that this scene is about openness.  We all share a
bond- the desire to groove to a good beat all night long- and no man is an
island.  Everyone needs friends and the outside world is tough enough.  We
don't need fronts and attitudes in our scene.  Open your hearts and let the
good feelings flow.  Look around you, pick a person, ask them their name,
and make a friend.  Eliminate boundaries.  Open your hearts and minds.
RAVERS UNITE AND KEEP OUR SCENE ALIVE!!!
                                *  unknown source


[  there were some fun drawings around the border of the text, including
Bert & Ernie -- maybe that's why Nancy remembers it ;) -- and on top there
was a small peace sign with a small p under it, a heart with an l under it,
and then 3 arrows going around in a circle with an r under it -- so maybe r
also means . . . recycle!  ;)   ]

lotsa food for thought. . .in my brief raving history (almost 4 mos. now),
I've been really lucky to have been exposed to many of the best aspects of
the scene, and not many of the worst.  But the vibe's different when
external forces are present, be they bodysearchers on the way in,
non-ravers without a clue at the fringes of public outdoor parties, police,
or some of the internal security folks like those I've seen at the
Gathering or that lame Evolution thing a coupla weeks ago.

Yet no matter whether we're watched or not, we have to be responsible to
ourselves, each other, and Mother Earth, and if we do a good job of that,
the outside world shouldn't be much of a problem -- creative, subtle people
find ways of doing what they want to do.

Regarding the size of the scene, like water it will find its own level.
Some new people will get it and bring in positive, new energy; some won't
and will leave.  Some old school folk will slow down or move on, and some
will continue to shine.  There will undoubtedly be some more mainstream
techno music in this country that gets popular, but that shouldn't affect
the increasingly diverse and oft-brilliant SF music scene, nor the
underground rave scene (which may have to go a little more underground to
survive, but will if needed I'm sure).

I say we need to encourage all the small-scale events we can, and the
people who have been in the scene awhile who might be motivated to put
things on themselves, in new spaces, to keep things fresh and safe.  But
then we can take the positive energy to the larger, more public events,
indoor and outdoor, when we're there, so the whole scene can continue to
move forward.

Hi everybody,

sounds like Chrysalis is flavor du jour for me -- a lot of people seemed to
point out Sunset and that one in particular to me, so I'm taking you guys'
word for it!  I'll be the short guy in the jersey with a big white 69 on the
back, so if you happen to see a #69 twirling around in a spastic frenzy with
neither direction nor control, come up and say hi!  And tell me if I'm too
twirly or kicky!  Hope to meet more of you on Saturday!  (Out of curiosity,
any volleyball players out there besides lil' ol' me?  Just wondering.)

Lotsa luv,

volt
#69

I saw Selecter and the Mud Sharks at Slim's when they were around last
November or so, and they couldna been better.  E-GADS did they ROCK! (or
kick, or whatever it is that makes your boat float, i.e. the show was more
fun than attaching jumper cables to your nipples and jumpstarting your head,
which I suppose is better than trying to kickstart it.)  And as long as
we're rattling off ska, Ska Fla's are pretty keen too.  (There's really not
enough ska in the world... *sigh*)  As for where these groups are local to,
I haven't the foggiest...

    As long as the emphasis is on "well behaved" ...and "under control"
 there are some cats around and the owners have a dog or two themeselves
but theres a small pasture with a dog proof fence where they can hang 
out. Ideally you might decide its less headache to party without him 
but if he's an essential party pal , then why not.

Subject: music of all sorts....
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

..........for those that know me or my musical history, I have played many
styles of house music, including deep, techno, tribal, breakbeat, and acid,
and have played hybrids like ambient etc......I've dabbled in trance, and
i'm dabbling in jungle, but I truly have grown to love the funky, and acid
elements, thus these days I play triphop, and more uptempo acid breakbeat
styles........I almost dont even look for "house-4 to the floor", unless
there is a special beat syncipation, killer tribal beat, or a clever vocal
sample or a fat bassline or an acid element etc........I look for the
unusual and bizzare.....the original and the sampled........... 
 
I have listened to classic rock, new wave, jazz, classical, motown, funk,
etc.....and I guess the basic point I'm trying to make is that I can't
expect to listen to the same music over and over and over again..........I
love house and I love the lifestyle house has opened up to me, but I can't
listen to house all day every day and all night every night....... 
 
just as I feel there is a time and place for house, there is not a time and
place for house. 
 
I enjoy to listen on the long drive to a gig in say santa cruz, to an
uptempo mix tape, to help get me in the mood for the night
ahead..........but on the way home I like to listen to a more mello down
tempo style that helps calm and relax me............thus said....... 
 
I feel that a DJ and it's audience needs to understand where they are
playing, at what time they are playing, and thusly pick a style of music
that is appropriate for that time and place..........now if a dj has
limited resources (she/he only plays gabber for example) 
then it's the promoters job to sort out when that DJ should play. 
 
now I know that if I attempted to play triphop in the main room at a major
event at 1:30 am, that I am not playing  the optimum music for that time
and place, and If I play gabber at 1:30 in the afternoon on a sunday in the
park, I am not feeling or working the mood that surrounds me. (with all due
repect to gabber dj's) 
 
I have heard far to many a DJ play their Sat nite hardest set during a
daytime event, as if it was an audition or something.........I like to be
set into the mood by the DJ, but I hope that she/he can understand that
outdoor elements require less hardcore elements & beats (trance, jungle
etc...) and more subtlety and finese.......and even a DJ's creativity can
create a vibe that beats any old thumpin record ever could, and people will
really appreciate your ability to sway them with sustenance and flavor,
rather than beat them over the head with hardcore thrills. 
 
I feel that it is the contrasts of the music that makes the music so
powerful. thats why we play hard at nite and chill out in the day
(generally speaking). certainly times have changed to show me that you can
rave on a wed afternoon, its not neccesarily about sat nites anymore, so
sometimes trance during the day is good.....but I strongly feel that  we
need to be more open to the styles we hear at daytime events...........I
have some records that I only play at outdoor events, and I have records I
would never play outdoors (too hard).........it's a matter of
choice...........I will probably be flamed for having an opinion, but I
felt I needed to follow up and explain a little deeper my last post
regarding my position on playing trance music during the day.....it was not
meant as a personal flame to anyones right to play or listen to trance (at
any time)

Moonpup basically said it all here....
I had mentioned in a previous post about hearing trance during the day 
and said that there is a certain time and setting for each style of 
music.  

So we are now wondering, what kind of music is really good for 
daytime outdoors.

Listen to Galen's mixtape "Continuum".  

This is my all time favorite tape EVER and it has outdoors written all 
over it.  The music is SO uplifting with some tribal elements and it's 
mellow sounding, but the beats are still strong.  To me that is the 
perfect recipe for a daytime outdoor rave. :)

love,                   ps: I might not go to Chrysalis (saving myself 
Amy                         for the Gathering) so I'll see you all at
                            Organic in the Park and Sunset! :)

On your words of caution to me regarding commenting on my state of mind
while driving: Big Thanks!  My challenging drive was primarily due to
fatigue; I NEVER, repeat NEVER drive when I'm not capable of driving safely
and resposibly.  My father was killed by a drunk driver in a head-on
collision four days before my eighth birthday, and that memory inspires me
to avoid putting myself or others at risk.  It means a great deal to me.

I love you all!

True.  Of course, the manufacturers are risking years of jail time...
underground party organizers don't have anywhere near that amount
of risk.

Allissa asked...
	What was that "party" at the Oakland Kaiser Auditorium awhile
back?

	Seemed to me that was some attempt at mainstreaming "rave
culture", but I didn't go and didn't talk to anyone that went, so 	I don't
really know.

	Does anybody else out there know about it? 


Sad to say, I went to it -- Cool World --  I went specifically because I wanted
to see what a commercial massive was like, from the organizational end (how did
they handle lines, crowd control, food, water, etc.) -- and I knew that the
Wicked crew was spinning in an outside tent, so that no matter what, I could
count on being outdoors and hearing music I knew I would like....

It sucked.  There were carnival rides, people selling schlocky stuff, and most
horrifying to me, people doing tattooing and piercing in dusty, dirty open tents
(those who know me know I take these things very seriously, both in a spiritual
way and in a health-safety way) -- seeing a beautiful young girl having a flash
butterfly tattooed on her belly by a greasy looking stranger while 8 gangsta
boys leered at her caused me grief beyond belief...

It sucked.  The crowd was WAY young, looked like they'd been dropped off by
their mommy who would pick them up at 7 in the morning, thinking they were safe
there somehow -- bad drugs everywhere and paramedics running through
periodically --

Did I say it sucked?  Inside the building was a total nightmare, people with
bullhorns keeping people from stopping on the steps or in the halls, where the
lights were on bright - and such weird energy inside, I didn't stay more than a
minute...  At least they had enough bathrooms though...

This was where I had my worst whistle experience ever, with a tweaked out
whistle=man who was relentless, louder than I ever though possible, and I swear
who followed me around, I could not get away from it!

Were there ravers there?  I saw a number of people I know, but I doubt any of us
would ever go again.  Worst of all, my car was blocks away, so I had wait until
morning to walk back to it ... looooooonnnnggg night.

This party in no way was like the Gathering or other massive events... it was a
middle-American-kids night out because of the promotion of the event...  Moral
of the story?  Don't go to Cool World, no matter who's spinning - for me, my
good time is 50% music and 50% people/vibe --

SUBJECT: (non-Rave) Seeking Roommie(s)

  I sent this out yesterday morning but haven't seen it appear yet, so...
  here it is again (sorry if anyone gets a duplication).

                     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Hello All!

 Tis the time to seek a new place to live and some roommates as well.
 I'm looking to move into a new place some time in May.
 I don't have a place in particular that I'm going to move in to
 but would like to find a place with one or more cool folks (or
 if anyone has space currently...).

 Location...I currently work in Sunnyvale and would have a preference
 to find a place in that area (or Los Altos/Mt.View/Palo Alto...etc.),
 but could consider other options.

 Without going into long detail, suffice to say for now I'm a responsible
 roommate who's fun (so I like to think anyway...:), respecting, and likes
 to rave, of course.  Some of you have met me (hopefully that's a good
 thing  :) ) so I'm not totally unfamiliar to some.

 If anyone is interested or knows someone who is, please email me
 at tbobsc@tevm2.nsc.com or call (408) 735-9699, and we can discuss.

 Thanks!!

P.S., I am willing to consider various options (location, time fram, etc.)
      just lemme know!  Taking the time to find a good too

speaking of which... 4Mb/8/16 memory at $57/115/242 ? talk to
sales@cqk.com 
commercialisation is what makes the world go around.
it is its excesses (evils) that we use to epitomize the meaning. 
i'm just glad people buy stuff so i can live properly and healthy 
(in *my* job anyway, otherwise i wouldn't have a job). 
that is my US$1.32 worth.

Moonpup,

        Anyone who flames you for your opinions needs to remember the word
RESPECT!  You have valid points to make, and elaborating the way you do
helps others to understand where you're coming from.  You didn't say
"Here's the last word; if you don't agree, piss off!" so I for one am glad
you posted.
        Due to my lack of familiarity with the music, at this point I don't
think it would make any difference to me what style of music is played at
any time, in any environment.  However, you talked about the concept of
maintaining a mood or atmosphere, and that makes sense to me.  When my band
puts together a set list for a gig (like tonight's free party in Sunnyvale
- BSP!), we like to group songs by mood, too, so we can deliver some
energetic songs, then mellow and stretch out with some slower stuff, and
finish with a bang.  So, I back you up, since we are both musical artists.

Thanks!

Love,

- E

.........once upon a time a coolworld promoter called me to play at their
event and as I needed work, I responded, they told me that because this was
a Donation event and that the procedes would go to charity would I be
willing to play for 1/2 price, SURE I said unknowingly.......and trounced
off to work what I thought was a cool big party....... 
.........first of all my turntables got knocked over by some doped up
asshole, right in the middle of my set (just like garth at burning man), he
was screaming "its all over shut it down now", and I'm like yeah whatever
man, meanwhile trying to find a security guard or a promoter to get rid
this asshole  or confirm it truly was over............ 
 
.........secondly when I arrived....there idea of donation was to bring a
can of food, they had no intention of paying out any money and they were
charging $25.00 each (approx 4.000 people).......so I pulled them aside and
said it was bullshit to mis-lead me into 1/2/ price scenerio......and that
normally I would never change what I had agreed to ($$$ wise), but that I
wanted an additional $100.00 due to there mis-leading statements of
charity....   well they begrugingly gave me my $200.00 total plus the extra
$100.00   I asked for and I told them there lucky I dont ask for the full
$400.00 i originally had quoted.........any way I learned my
lesson.......no more gigantic gigs, or bullshit promoters......(i managed
to never work on such a grand scale again, but unfortunately.........too
many crap promoters ripping me off that I retired from DJ-ing.) 
 
fotunately I have come back and I am happy with the level of the promoters
I deal with now........honest, caring, and about a vibe.....I have been
payed $275.00 (TOTAL) this year for over 15 gigs.............(of course I
lost my job so now I need $$$ to play sometimes)....... 
 
I go to tribal gathering in the U.K. may 4th.....30,000 people last
year......wow, I'm a little overwhelmed.......I 'll keep in touch with SFR
and try to let you know how it was......

yes but my friends......that is why the dealer sells e    to make massive
profits........I have never seen a e dealer pay out any $$$ to DJ's or
whatever (unless it's one of these promoter/dealer types) who only throw
raves to profit on the e and the nitrous balloons etc..... 
 
I have a guy call me from time to time wanting to know where I will be dj
ing just so he can ask the promoter if he can bring the hippy crack.....YUK
!!!!!    WRONG !!!!! 
 
the risk of jail time is minimal to the $$$ signs the e dealer see's    
they just don't wanna get a real job........so no sympathy for the poor e
dealer, I can't get a break on a hit of e to save my life.........."sorry
I'm broke, I cant afford to lower the price etc...." is what I hear all to
often, I try to exchange DJ tapes for e's with the selling line...."this
tape will last you a lot longer than that e will last me" 
 
don't get me wrong.......I like to do the occaisional e, but I don't
support the notion that these people face years of jail time, so feel sorry
for them, so pay overpriced amounts.  you get out what you put in to
life.........you deal, you risk, if you win and never get caught, I'll bet
you have a 4 wheel drive vehicle........if you lose and get
caught.......don't expect me to dole out $25.00  to help support a rave
that is to help with your lawyer costs.........         
 
I pay thousands of $$$ a year to bring you the musical
experience........and get very litte back (financially speaking).......but
the vibe I get from people who enjoy my talents is
immeasurable................                        moonpup 
 
I know we need the e.......so I'm not blasting e dealers, just the notion
we should overpay and be happy because of all that
risk.........bullshit....... 
 
some e dealers are so subtle....there vibe is right.......but most   
..........well you know the story...........

for all those who think goa is too fast for a suday in the marina, don't
forget a track at 150 bpm can also be spun at 120.5 at 33 rpm +8%, which is
what i'm guessing people are looking for. the tunes still sound trippy as
hell especially having the tones strecthed out over a longer period of time.
try mixing some of this with house music and you'll get a real treat.

Yes if you can get Platypus Vol. II get it because this is the essence of 
excellent goa music. Man With No Name's Moment of Truth cd is another 
awesome cd as is the Double cd Distance to Goa 3 (one mixed and one 
unmixed). I agree Union Jack extremely good at what they are doing. I 
got all three at F-8.

I went to Seismic last night with a friend. It was at the Acme, but with 
around 100 people there wasn't an overcrowding or overheating problem. 
They had the upstairs level set up with visuals on both ends of the 
building,DJ Dan started just after 10 and went til midnight when DRC came 
on. After that DJ Kimo, then Surge (Josh was going to close out the 
evening but we left before that so I don't know if he did). Excellent 
music all night (quite a variety mixed in), free candy passed out every once 
in a while plus oranges :)Good vibe all around. This is a wonderful 
example of the thrivingunderground we have. I'll be watching out for this 
one in the future!

I am!  The first Nikita was PHAT!  The second one...it was good, but 
crowded.  Dimitry took a little while to really warm up.  I'd be happy if 
tonight's Nikita fell somewhere in between.

I'll be in black baggies, my ever-present green fimo medallion, and a new 
black t-shirt that has an Exxon-looking logo that says "Exxtc".  And my 
camera, of course!  The one thing I will NOT be bringing is....my goattee!  
Those of you that know me, look for a someone that could be my younger, 
clean-cut brother -- I've got kind of a baby face without that facial hair...

big ole grins,

S

Hey everyone!
      After much deliberation between my friends and I, we have decided to
attend Organic in GG Park.  Look for a (almost) nipple lenght red haired
girl(with brown roots showing), pale, pale skin, green eyes (if you get that
close) and I may be wearing purple lipstick.  I am planning on wearing jeans
and a green "Pooch and Bobo" T-shirt, although this may change depending on
weather.  The only real distinguishing feature may be my camera that I am
planning on bringing, it's a big black Minolta XE-7 with a blue and black
neck strap.

     I hope to meet some other sfravers there, I will look out for you guys!

More often than not, venues contract with TicketMaster.  So, no matter who
has a show at a certain place, if tickets are sold, TicketMaster is the
dealer.  That's why for certain places that have regular events, you always
have to go to a certain place to get tickets!

It's all because of contracts and the general business model.  Think about
it a bit before you hit the D key.  If a ticket agency says to a venue that
they'll be the agency for all their events, pay them $50k an event if they
can tack on $3, most venues would do that.

TicketMaster may do one-offs, but I'd think they'd be more interested in
the bigger, more frequent productions than a one time only gig.

Just my $.02.

Hey all!

Now for the obligatory description (FIND me sdream!):

5'8", shoulder length brown hair, old baggy blue jeans, black converse 
hightops, and the shirt: I'm sure you who read this'll probably 
remember this one!  Front: black & white picture of a dog mounting a 
pig with the caption "Race mixing is cool- just do it!"  The back has a 
tripped-out neon-orange drawing of a weird dragon-y indescribable thing 
on it that I've painted in (like a coloring book) with other neon 
colors.  I should be very recognizable tomorrow night!  However, if the 
heat gets too bad, I'll just be wearing a grey tank top.  The last 
thing, if I can track one down tomorrow, will be a feather boa!  And of 
course my bag of trip toys.

See y'alls tomorrow!
:):)

Love,
Shawna

Good luck on those days of the week.  I think there is a club at 
America Live on sunday nights.  Don't expect much from it.  It may be 
kinda fun with a few Sam Adams and an open mind.  But I've never been 
so I don't really have room to talk.

DRIVE!  You are just going to have to drive, Alan, to get anywhere decent.
Come out for Sunset on Sunday, like I suggested to you on Thursday. It is 
WELL worth the hour and a half trip - believe me.  Call the info line at 
415.985.7109...I can introduce you to lots of people, and it will be fun!

See you all this weekend!

Ya, a friend of mine couldn't get tix for Begin Again and was dragged by
"friends" to Cruel World New Year's Eve.  He was appalled.  Tough-looking
guys glaring at people, looking for trouble, scantily-clad female go-go
dancers on the stage, mainstream house music, drunken hordes, negative
vibe.  He left at 2AM (not only unheard of for a "rave," but this was NEW
YEAR'S EVE!).

All we have to do is look at Cruel World to see what the commercialization
of rave looks like!

Nancy


P.S.  The gangstas strutting around the party looking for fights reminds me
of the one time I saw that at a rave - at Vision, I think, out in the
boonies, Pittsburgh.  A group of tank-topped teen-age boys travelling in a
pack, sticking out their chests and glaring at other guys.  But what was
hilarious was that they couldn't get anyone to respond!  Imagine trying to
start a fight with a bunch of idealistic, blissed out ravers on e?!  Ain't
gonna happen :) .

Why is everyone dissing Acme so hard?  Okay, it's a deathtrap - but the
three parties I've been to there have been about the best of my life
(Friends and Family, Harmony, and Begin Again)!  I only have incredible
memories of old Acme Tool!

Finding new, bigger, safer space will be cause for great joy - but let's
bid Acme good-bye with the thanks and respect it deserves for being the
site of so many wonderful experiences...

yes and also there is the english term 'naff' meaning shitty or lame, 
like "...what a naff party that was..."

'sorted' or 'get sorted' are also english terms 'sorted' like "are you

Hmm...last 10 days: Light, Something Special, Sunset, MAD, Nikita and
tonight, Chrysalis.  Not a bad week!  But I may have gotten my fill of
raving for a while (what? Blasphemy! ;P ).

I'm not at Golden Gate Park right now at the free (and seemingly fucking
rad) Organic - I'm sitting in a computer lab in Berkeley because I can
barely move after last night.

Last night: Nikita at 1015 Folsom

I decided to check out the realm of Clubland.  Rave dj's, rave laser
company...can't be all bad, right?  The usual clubmix of clubkids and
suburbanites were there...the drinkers and the dancers.  I got my butt
pinched :( - definitely not a rave (without PLUR, there's no respect!).
But on the whole it was more fun than the average club experience - lotsa
folks were there to seriously get down, not to pick up on somebody.  There
were even a few glowsticks making their appearance.  No whistles or
handclaps or many spontaneous smiles, though.  Several instances of
anonymous guys suddenly dancing up against me when all I was trying to do
was enjoy my own experience of the music :( .  I'm starting to hate that
wherever I go, I invariably think, "I have more fun at a rave!"

 The lasers by Dimension 7 were GOING OFF in the main room - so many it
hurt my eyes to look at them!  I befriended the laserguy and got to play
with the lasers - hitting buttons to the beat, making lights jump, over
several hundred people - that was fun!  The fog machine was going full
blast all night, the stacks and stacks of speakers were booming.  The
second room featured hideous 80's music.  Downstairs was a "VIP" Room
(_definitely_ not a rave!) with some ambient music and folks who were too
cool to dance to it.

Simon and Henrik spun decent sets (it's hard to please me with house,
though).  Then "Superstar DJ" Keoki came on.  Now I've heard a lot about
his notorious reputation (his "attitude"), but also that he's the best.  He
spun crowd-pleasing deep house, with a few suspenseful crescendos, but I
swear with my limited dj'ing knowledge that he made a number of mistakes!
Some records rather awkwardly switched into the next, some samples came in
abruptly and a little off-beat, and the whole set was pretty generic!   He
did have about 15 minutes at the end that got the crowd hyped, but then it
happened!  Imagine one of the biggest clubs in San Francisco, packed with
hundreds of people, at the height of the dancefloor Friday night, with a
"superstar dj" especially flown in.  Someone hit the needle!!  Cardinal Sin
#1!  There was the longest, most horrifying SSCCCCRRRAAAATTCCHHHHH and then
dead silence.  I was at the decks watching Keoki spin, and here is when I
saw the famed attitude.  He went totally rigid, standing straight up, and
glared at the perpetrator with bulging eyes for loooonnng silent moments,
bad vibe just pouring out of him ("how dare you knock the deck of the
famous Keoki?") and then FINALLY put another record on.  I don't like to
judge people on one act, but the feeling of his response was _really_ ugly
(although I know hitting the needle is a BIIIGG NOO-NOO!  No interrupting
the vibe!).

Jeno ended the night on the decks.  He was truly masterful, seamless, but
unfortunately, I just can't stand the music!  I stopped dancing and watched
him spin, admiring the artistry, hating the tunes....(Progressive House...a
single beat for as long as five minutes, a simple layer for about as long,
and then back to a single beat...uuuhhhhhhhh....)

Some SFRavers were doin their thing on the dancefloor...what's up Leslie
and Todd!  I met some cool people and had a really good time - I think I'm
less anti-club now, but my heart still lies with the strongest unified
vibe, here in the underground :) :).

Missed Seismic Thursday night - this one sounds like a true underground
party worth supporting.  Going to try to make it in 2 weeks!

End of Report - See you all tonight at...you know where ;D.

Love, Vibe, and Stickers,
Nancy

I want to preface this by saying I had one of the best party experiences 
of my life at Acme(F&F).  

I think that you will find that the reason people have little respect for 
Acme, is that I got the distinct impression that the  "owners" of Acme had 
little respect for the people going to the parties. We were just a source of 
revenue. My understanding from speaking to a couple of promoters, is that 
Acme just wanted more and more money, and weren't willing to make 
any efforts to increase the safety of the place.   

Yeah, Acme was fun, but I wouldn't want to die there.....

This is true.  I went to Seismic on Thursday at the Acme.  The owners
didn't allow the promoters to use the facilities down stares (only up
stairs).  When 4.30 am rolled around the owner came out an told Surge to
shut down the music.  I did't see the confrontation, but from what I
understand he said he wanted all the "ravers to go home" (for some reason -
I didn't hear).  They cut Surge's set short and I guess Josh never got to
spin.  We were all booted from the building. The party really ended on a
bad note =3D Surge spoke about how the owner was such an asshole, had no
respect for ravers and [the owner] didn't really care if he had promised
the building till 7 or not but just wanted everyone to go.  Everyone was
talking about "boycotting the Acme", spreading the "word" about the owner,
and telling promoters to not book any more parties at the Acme.

I personally hadn't been to the Acme since Chrystalis (or was Harmony the
last?) and I don't like to go to parties at the Acme unless they are thrown
buy people who I enjoy and like.  Reasons: It gets very hot, it gets very
crowded, it smells, it's a deathtrap and I am just not comfortable there.
True I've had great times there but if I had a preference I would never go b=
ack.

Re:Seismic

Got there when DRC was spinning some great break beat.  I hadn't heard her
in a while.  I liked some of the goa/trance she played but she spun some
abstract beat I couldnt get into.  Kimo was great and I missed most of
Surge's set cuze I went outside for awile and to Lift(DV8).  Came back to
hear the final songs and words (above) and left unsatisfied.  This was the
only party I went to this weekend because or work.  Austin T. I didn't get
to met you.  I don't know if you remember but I was the white guy-brown
hair- with a white adidas shirt w/ black stripes down the sleeves and blue
jenes.  There was a guy there with the same exact shirt and same colored
jenes too, (not my brother) but he did insist that he saw me the night
before in Safeway buying a case of whipped creme (I got a laugh out-a-this
but this wasn't me) I am happy to see some people had a good time - I
personally saw too many people tweeken and doin' crank for my taste. ( I
have a personal hatred for this useless substance).

Subject: Underground Responsibility
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Last night I again brought a newbie into the underground.  I wanted to
share the experience with my best friend from high school (with whom I had
made many drug-induced and spiritual explorations, at the time).  She and I
have had limited contact for the past five years, but my overflowing heart
unthinkingly wished to show EVERYONE the beauty of this scene, and I
invited her without, as I found, _really_ knowing her anymore.

I had explained what I find in the underground - the community, the sacred
ritual, the group vibe which to me proves spirituality, the energy link
between us all, one consciousness, the full acceptance.  She told me I
sounded like a Hare Krishna (I have noticed that my non-rave friends are
distinctly uncomfortable with that kind of talk.  I realize now that they
cannot understand because they haven't experienced it, and so they dismiss
this "mumbo jumbo" as something negative, either naivete on my part (one
non-raver friend warned me against being "hurt" by the scene), or bizarre
cultish group behavior.  :( .

On the ride into the city she began to spew negativity.  Saying she hated
the world, people were lame, and everyone was posers!  My heart sank - I
knew that in that mindframe she would not be able to connect with the magic
that we create.  I asked her to release her negativity and enter with an
open mind, just freely allowing the experience to show her whatever it
would.  She said my attitude was condescending and self-righteous.  (It is
amazing to me that our mindset so totally determines our interpretation of
the world, creating our own reality.  In my positivity and joy she saw a
superiority complex!  What sort of beliefs must she have to twist what
others have told me is "beautiful energy" into something that negative and
destructive?)

We got to the beautiful dance studio where Chrysalis was held.  She gave
the party about an hour, closed, not dancing, not speaking to people.  She
then announced she was calling a cab to take her away (at 2AM!) because all
the scene was was artificial connection, posers pretending to "love" each
other, the music was awful, grating, and the scene was not only just about
being trendy but also intensely boring.  I let her go with that, both
physically and mentally.  I don't recall her being this way when we were
very close friends.  I know I have grown more positive (a direct outgrowth
of rave revelations), but she has become mired in her world of anger and
negativity.  It makes me sad because it is not necessary, it is her choice
to live life that way.  I let her go because I no longer wish to pollute my
consciousness with those sorts of influences.  I need to surround myself
with people who are on the same wavelength, about opening up to greater and
greater love and generating something special for _all_ of us (not just
ravers!).  Since I have been raving I have become a more joyous person, and
I am convinced that affects all I come into contact with :).  Maybe that is
the only way to share the underground with the outside world - spread the
love.  Once they have that, they will have the mindset to appreciate and
thrive in the actual rave experience.

I realized last night that belonging to the underground is a
responsibility.  I need to be _very_ careful about who I bring into that
sacred environment!  The person _must_ have the right attitude, or they
will not only not see the transcendence but will also be adding bad vibes,
taking away from our collective possibility.  In the past I have wanted to
share this with _everyone_!  But now I feel like I cannot introduce people,
unless I see a very special quality in them.  I am feeling more and more at
home with the people already there - they are the ones who know, who
understand, who are feeling exactly what I'm feeling.

I met a new friend last week.  He came with a mutual friend with us to
Something Special.  His very first party was Halloween's Friends and Family
- so his introduction was right into the underground and for him it was
like coming home.  He and I connected on such a deep level, are on such on
the same wavelength in regards to spirituality, our mission in life, what
we experience in the rave ritual, that we were instant friends.   When we
first met, he glowed when he spoke of raving, and it was like we absolutely
knew each other, understood each other.  We've known each other now a
"week" but it feels completely timeless.  He stayed with me last night
after she left, and after the party we sat in my car and talked for 3 1/2
hours, and the whole time it was just like, "yes yes yes," - complete
understanding.  I no longer want to bring people into the scene, because
they have not been led there themselves.  I feel the bond with people who
have discovered the exact same things independent of my "guidance," and
have returned again and again, just like me.  The smiles we exchange on the
dance floor at 6 in the morning have greater meaning for me now.  Everyone
who is there at that time is a brother or sister of the spirit, I feel that
now.  One Family.

All last year I only went to big parties, but I sensed a kernel of
something true, and I kept seeking until I found it.  I think now if a
newbie wants to try "raving" I might suggest a commercial one, unless I am
sure of them.  The underground as a collective experiment requires a
certain energy level from individuals, a positive contribution on behalf of
each person there.  For it to work it requires us to give of our selves to
the collective whole, and for that we are rewarded with doubled and tripled
love returned.  But it needs people to be at a certain level of
consciousness.

Brothers and sisters of the underground, I love you all!!  :D Nancy

Just got on this list two weeks ago, and yes, I've been an overenthusiastic
posting-hound :).  But I've thought of this list as a conversation between
the twenty or so people who post - an intimate discussion.  With realizing
there are 400 people, and random people I've never heard of recognizing me
at parties from SFR desciptions, I suddenly saw that this "private"
conversation is more like 20 people on a stage with microphones, with 400
people in the audience.

So, I would like to know who is out there in the audience!  I was wondering
if you could do us all the favor of a quick post saying your name and hi,
just so we know who is out there, listening and thinking.  I love you all!

I whole heartedly disagree.  Not that I don't share your displeasure with
these elements and desire clean negative-free parties, but because I feel
that the joy we experience while raving stems from the trancendance of
negative attitudes, of freeing ourselves from the judgements and confinement
of social constrictions and narrow minded perspectives.  These bad vibes that we
are trying to keep out of the party will never go away, until we accept
them and conquer them.  This doesn't mean forcing them to see our 
enlightened way, but allowing ourselves to see theirs.  When we can, we
begin to notice that our ways are actually very similar, if not the same,
and thats when we can move together into the future.  

Belonging to the underground is a responsability, but only to ourselves.
To always fight the desires to judge and not accept other people and
different modes of being.  There just isn't really any way to to grow 
until you make peace with every single thing out there, and accept it for
what it is, a reflection of yourself.  

You don't have to love everyone or bring everyone to your parties, but
you do have to accept them for who they are and welcome their presence
in your life.  That's where all of beauty comes from... that interplay.

So... don't be afraid of a little negativity, or even a lot, as long as
you remember what you're about nothing can destroy what you believe in.
Invite every single person in the world to a rave, dance and respect
the people who dance with you as much as the people who laugh at you...
That's when you'll really know that you're alive.

It's not the leading, it's the pushing.  Everyone is led by something,
and it's all right if it's you, but nobody likes being judged.

no... it just needs consciousness to realize no bounds, no levels,
no separation... just freedom.  That only requires you.
Let the energy find itself, rather than seeking it out.

Regards, and good luck in your adventures.

Hi everyone!!  This is my first time posting on sfraves, but I am a 
"lurker", enjoying reading many intelligent, humorous, insightfu, 
messages.  I have been following sfraves for about a month and I think 
it captures the essence of the scene.  We use computers (tecnology) to 
better communicate and connect with each other, in a place where physical 
appearance truly doesn't matter.  I guess I never posted too much because 
of fear :), but it's time I stopped being a lurker and introduced myself.

My name is Tara and I'm a freshmen at UC Santa Cruz.  I am studying 
general ed and I have never loved learning so much.    I am originally 
from southern California where I first started raving about a year and a 
half ago.  For me raves have meant many different things:  a way to let 
my stress out, create love, meet incredible people, dance, hear some 
insane music, and explore myself.  I truly believe I am a more 
understanding and aware person as a result of my experiences.  I really 
like the San Francisco scene: lots of smiles, good dj's, a great city.

Anyways, I'm 18, short, and I have short bleached hair, so if you ever 
see me please say hi.  Reading sfraves makes me think about the impact 
raving has had on each individual and society.  So many people are being 
exposed to techno/house and seeing the complexity and possibilities.  I 
believe each person has their own personal idea about what raving means 
to them.  To me, we are a bunch of people coming together to dance all 
night and share sacred parts of ourselves. 

   I have no car so I don't get to go to parties often, so if anyone in 
the Santa Cruz area ever has room for another person, please email me.    
I love you all and appreciate your wisdom.  Hopefully I will have 
the guts to post more often.    

share your sunshine,

Tara

boy, what a cliche!
but it's true.


Nancy, i'm sorry you had such a bad experience with bringing your
old friend into the scene. i brought some newbies to a party in 
Madison Wisconsin this wknd and it went pretty ok.
two of them were so baked, they just sat on the floor for three hours. ugh!
we ended up leaving at 3:00am cuz of those two. oh wells.

i guess i didn't really like this party either cuz it was the first
time i saw ppl openly doing lines on the floor. i hate drug shit.

this midwest scene is really bringin' me down.
but on a lighter note, i have a cool story. this is kind of long so
bear with me:

in the airport at SFO, i got bumped off my flight from Minneapolis.
so waiting around, i saw this woman in the same gate area that looked
nice so i asked if she was going to mpls. also. she said yeah, she
had missed her earlier flight so now she was on standby for the next one
to Mpls. So we went and got lunch together.
she asked if i did anything cool whilst in SF. i said i went to some raves
and then to Yo' Mama's cafe in Oakland. She said oh, i hang out there
all the time! i said, this will be weird but, do you know this guy
(anybody else here know Mosha?). and she said, ohmigod! i totally know
him! i see him at YO Mamas all the time!


so with 3 million ppl in the bay area, i met two that know each other, in 
completely separate places at different times! i love san fran.

have a great week everyone!

I realize that you had the best intentions in mind, but from her
perspective your attitude was indeed condescending and self-righteous. To
her you were saying "your opinions and values are merely delusions of
negativity. Just assume my disposition and everything will be much better."
Mindsets rarely form by themselves. Ask a negative person what experiences
have led them to think the world's so fucked. It may be that a few bad
experiences have been blown out of proportion, or it may be that a lifetime
of abuse has tainted their outlook. Either way, simply hearing a few
second-hand counterexamples might give them something to think about.
Whenever I hear someone rant about the laziness of the homeless, I tell
them about the homeless guy who gave me a quarter for the phone when I was
locked out of a building.

I wouldn't worry about it too much, actually. Whenever I encounter someone
with a weird/bad vibe at a party, I just flash em a big smile and keep
dancing. I think the most important thing is to prepare someone for the
type of music they're going to hear. No amount of vibe or community can win
someone over if they absolutely hate the music. After all, I've watched
line dancing on the Nashville Network - they all seem really happy,
together, enjoying some sort of vibe, and definitely enjoying the beer. But
if I had to listen to six hours of "new country," you'd find me curled up
in a ball in a corner, wheezing.

>Brothers and sisters of the underground, I love you all!!  :D Nancy

take care!

"Deadend Job", the first Police single (1976 I think) is a *great* song.
