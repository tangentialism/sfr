Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey guys..

Back about 10-12 years ago, I owned a company called DIVE Labs that develop=
ed virtual reality technology for simulations, entertainment, and business =
applications.  During a trade show in NYC, I met a former stripper who call=
ed herself Skye London.  She was intereseted in developing "full body conta=
ct" virtual reality sex simulations for a club she had recently opened in N=
ew York.  So I went over to the club to check it out.  Essentially it was w=
hat Chester has described here.  Everyone was naked or almost so.  The prob=
lem was that other than the dancers (one of whom was Skye's 18-19 year old =
daughter) there wasn't anyone in the place that you wanted to see naked.

I was concerned about liability issues with full body contact interfaces in=
 public places, so I declined to build that aspect.  But I did present a bi=
d for stereoscopic video projection and production equipment.  I think she =
had expected me to want to do this for free after seeing the club, or maybe=
 after having sex with her and her daughter, because I never heard from her=
 again after that.

Anyway, the point is that an "all naked party" is in the realm of be carefu=
l what you wish for becasue you might actually get it.  And what you'll get=
 is a bunch of fat old men in leather speedos.

Peace,

Peter

Did the SFRP thingie use SWAT sound??  Because that sound sucked ass.
Feedback city.  Bad turntable RCA's.  Really bad.  No bueno..

CJ 

Mini-Rant:  When are sound guys going to realize that putting turntables
[yet alone FOUR] on a STAGE is generally a VERY bad idea.  How many times do
they need to hear the fucking things feedback before they get the whole
concept?  I mean, christ!  If I had a dollar for each time I've played on a
stage with TONS of feedback...well...i'd have atleast $15-20.  Point being
-->  DON'T set up turntables on a stage if you haven't properly sound tested
or adjusted for FEEDBACK!  Ok.  Got that off my chest.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: LOVE INFUSION - Lovefest Afterparty - 4 rooms of
sound

speaking of partying, this is one party that i'm really really excited
about.

1)  it's our afterparty for Lovefest (yes, formely known as Love
Parade SF) and the party last year that Evil Breaks was a part of was
a fucking blast!

2)  we are working with 3 other crews that i have a huge amount of
respect for:  Opel, Tantra and the Ambient Mafia.  these are some
class act crews and very talented folks.  Opel and Tantra have thrown
some AMAZING events over the last few years.  the combination of all 4
crews is going to be fantastic.

3)  the lineup is HUGE!!!  Rennie Pilgrim, Hyper, General
Midi....these are gigantic names not just in the breaks world but in
the cross-genre global dance music world.  this really is one of the
biggest breaks lineups in SF for the entire year, no joke.

4)  we have SWAT sound and Viberation visuals in our room.  you know what's
up.

5)  it's at SOMARTS bitchez!!!!

limited $20 presales are online at groovetickets:

you should get some food in your stomach before you make your morning
post on SFR.  low blood sugar can make the old man cranky!

on a related note, we were debating whether or not to setup the djs on
the stage but we decided to keep the stage because 1) we had nowhere
to put the stage and 2) without the stage we wouldn't have been able
to make the neato stack of computer monitors.

Yeah, I like some trance, and Tiesto has good tracklists, but I don't like
him because he seems so full of himself and his style/look is ugly. I
remember when I saw him at 1015 a few years ago he spent the whole time
talking to his groupies in the back during his set.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: LOVE INFUSION - Lovefest Afterparty - 4 rooms of sound

Oh, I did have breakfast this morning.  No amount of Odwalla and fresh fruit
can take away my memory of poor sound, unfortunately.  Though the computer
monitor mound was a pretty sick idea, I'm not sure that I would have
sacrificed the quality of the hi-fi for it.  Nothing is worse than having to
pull back the EQ's and lines during a break because the system is feeding
back so badly.  It's supposed to be all about the music right??

Huuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey guys..

Another community list I was on on had this very problem of too much
politically-infused discussion amidst the topics at hand - so they
created a separate politics list for those community members who just
couldn't stop on the subject, hence sheltering other members from
banter that might be un-interesting to them.

However, the sphere of what encompassed political discussion became so
wide that I couldn't even post a link to an environmental commentary,
so I got fed up and left the list altogether.

Anyway, maybe a group of you who like talking politics could consider
this in some form or fashion.

Ok, would those be my $200 black leather italian shoes or my puma clydes?

But that sounds like a good plan.

Lovefest is coming and I am excited.  I need a fricking babysitter for the after parties tho!

September 8th, Mighty will be turned out into a booty bass banquet,
featuring the accelerated funk of DJ ASSAULT, with ghetto-tech
support by the best electro and booty bass DJs to make you percolate.

SF has been bringing back the booty of yore. No, not booty as in the
bootleg mash-up party, but the original booty bass, ghetto tech, juke
house, 808, 909, sweaty crowds, dirty synths, nasty lyrics and lots
of bounce. July saw FUNK's first round with San Francisco as well as
DJ GODFATHER's descent from Detroit. It seems that the bay area, now
quite good at getting hyphy and going dumb, wants to shake dat ass, too.

DJ FUNK had the crowd at BLOW-UP ripping clothes off, screaming and
wanting more. He's back and ready to face Mighty's soundsystem. His
high speed ghetto house selections spin at pitches unheard, his
pornographic tracks violate your romantic house anthems, and his
electricity will seep through your pores. Expect jams like "Booty
Bounce," "Perk-U-Lated," "Pop that Pussy," and more.

DJ ASSAULT, "The Street Narrator" straight from Detroit has packed
international dancefloors, striking audiences with his classic hit,
"Ass n Titties." He's been making the most popular and infectious
booty-bass tracks ever produced. His hooks and brilliant transitions
make arousal inevitable. Expect tracks like "I See Booty," "Fuck You
Hoe," "Big Booty Bitch," and more.

Even if its chilly out, this night will be hot, and your ass will be
on fire. Sure, it's offensive, but damn it's fun.

Um...pornographic trax? Jacked up adolescents looking to hump de hump?
That ass n tities stuff is a really cheap trick. The goo in the middle
of that sandwhich is 100% pure cheese.

Detroit and Chicago should be embarassed.

Subject: [sfraves] mixer needed

hi kids,

i dropped off my Rane at Pro Audio Repair last week and was told it  
would be ready in 7-10 business days.  well, it's not ready, and i  
need to record a mix.  really, i need a new demo, and soon.

does anyone in the east bay have a decent mixer i can borrow for  
tonight & tomorrow to do some recording?  this is driving me crazy -  
i have new CD decks, a ton of new music, and NO MIXER.

hellllp meeeeeeeee....!

Ravers seize 10 million house

31.08.06 


Revellers are flocking to this house in north London.

Squatters have seized a 10 million home to host drug-fuelled raves, it has emerged.

Furious residents of the exclusive Primrose Hill area of North London say their lives have been made a nightmare since the eight bedroom house was taken over two months ago. 

The occupants charge hundreds of ravers 5 each to attend all-night parties which shatter the peace of the area that is home to celebrities including David Walliams, Gwen Stefani, Sadie Frost and Jamie Oliver.

The front of the house is littered with beer cans, broken glass and used needles, while inside the carpets have been ripped up and the walls covered in graffiti.

But despite scores of complaints, police say they are powerless to act until the owner of the property gets a court order to evict the revellers. 

The squatters boast that the only thing the police have done is to politely ask them to keep the noise down.

The takeover comes amid a resurgence in illegal rave parties, fuelled by confusion over the Government's reclassification of drugs and pocket money prices for substances.

Kitty Massey, whose home backs on to the garden of the occupied house, said the scale of the raves was 'unimaginable'.

'Hundreds of screaming teenagers are turning up in droves and heavy metal and rock music has been blasting out day and night.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

Subject: [sfraves] If you're not going to raves, WTF are you doing then?

I only make it to raves or parties every couple months, I end up going
to more shows or bars/clubs for techno acts. Going back to school and
working full-time takes a lot out of me, not to mention the drive from
the northbay.

Is this list now purely for only rave-related topics? It seems to me
it would be narrow-minded to ignore any of the great talent that is
pouring through SF right now just because it isn't in a warehouse
w/bad ventiliation.

Is everyone else just lurking or are they  living vicariously through
those of us who go out? Whats your excuse? DELURK and ANSWER! :)

Revellers are flocking to this house in north London.

Squatters have seized a =C2=A310 million home to host drug-fuelled raves, i=
t has emerged.

Furious residents of the exclusive Primrose Hill area of North London say t=
heir lives have been made a nightmare since the eight bedroom house was tak=

The occupants charge hundreds of ravers =C2=A35 each to attend all-night pa=
rties which shatter the peace of the area that is home to celebrities inclu=
ding David Walliams, Gwen Stefani, Sadie Frost and Jamie Oliver.

The front of the house is littered with beer cans, broken glass and used ne=
edles, while inside the carpets have been ripped up and the walls covered i=
n graffiti.

But despite scores of complaints, police say they are powerless to act unti=
l the owner of the property gets a court order to evict the revellers.=20

The squatters boast that the only thing the police have done is to politely=
 ask them to keep the noise down.

The takeover comes amid a resurgence in illegal rave parties, fuelled by co=
nfusion over the Government's reclassification of drugs and pocket money pr=
ices for substances.

Kitty Massey, whose home backs on to the garden of the occupied house, said=
 the scale of the raves was 'unimaginable'.

'Hundreds of screaming teenagers are turning up in droves and heavy metal a=

Since the birth of my son (who will be turning 1 in a couple of weeks), i'd
have to demote myself and live vicariously through others.

I wish it could be otherwise, but babies are expensive, and i tend to spend
what little money i do get on strippers and beer.  My nights and weekends
are shot because that's when momma has to work and go to school.

So all of you remember when you're drinking your 40 to pour a little out for
your downed homie!!!

Sounds more like punks than ravers. "Ravers" probably sells more copy
though.

It's the vicarious life for me too.  I've been on the verge of going
to some evilbreaks things in the past few months, but something always
came up.  Both my wife and I working rather consuming jobs has made it
hard.  One of these days, we'll get out.

Subject: [sfraves] Deep Min Tek + Microhouse @ Club Six on Fri. Sept 8

Deep Mix @ Club Six (in the Dark Room)
With ::solekandi:. and special guest from Microphono's Minneaplis
James Patrick (3 + hour DJ set)

Friday, September 8
9 PM - 4 AM
Club Six's Dark Room (Right next to Club Six. Look for the Deep Mix signs)

60 6th St.(btw Market + Mission)
San Francisco, CA.
10 PM to 4 AM
$5 to $10

www.babd.org

Headlining Deep Mix @ Club Six Friday, September 8 is
Minneapolis-based techno figurehead, producer and DJ James Patrick,
who is at the forefront of the new minimal, micro-house and tech-house
movement in the US.

His passion for pushing dance music's often worn envelope has turned
MNPLS, MN. Into the new American headquarters for electronic dance
music's third wave.

Come see, feel and hear why: www.microphono.com/jamespatrick

Bay Area Beatdr_p's favorite JP set:
www.secrettechno.com/jamespatrick ( in the folder titled "geologic").

"JP spearheaded a DIY movement that's giving Minneapolis quite the ego
boost. No longer is it the sulking middle child next to Chicago and
Detroit. The attention is coming from the Twin Cities' version of
microhouse, the most unlikely sound--or perhaps the most cyclically
logical--to derive from over-the-top rave culture's entrails."
(Source: The Minneapolis/St Paul City Pages "Microhouse goes Macro at
the Dinkytowner," June 15, 2005)

More information at: www.babd.org and solekandi.com
============================================================
Details:

We're going till 4:00 a.m. in Club Six's Dark Room with Minneapolis's
James Patrick, whom many of us agree is one of the best underground
Techno Djs in the US today.

A 5-hour mix we heard online a few months back sent Yanni and I on a
wild goose chase for JP and since then, we've been inspired by his
work. It's raw, deep, emotive, spellbinding and innovative...crossing
from house to tech to experimental. In short, he sure to join the
ranks of other favorites like Bruno Pronsato and John Tejada, leading
the 3rd wave for techno on our own shores.

Look for JP's upcoming releases on New York's www.microcosm-music.com
and Philly's www.unfoundsoundrecords.com that are sure to reshape any
preconceived notions of techno.

Very serious prescription drug interactions nearly killed me about a year ago.  Did damage my muscles and every major organ but my kidneys.  So I've been trying to heal myself.  For the first time since grade school I don't go dancing every weekend :'(  I do still spin and dance in front of the tables, and I'm doing some production.  Who knows what the future may bring...

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

Subject: [sfraves] BT: This Binary Universe CD/DVD Review

Well it is a mini review seeing how I have not gotten through the whole 
thing. But man BT is a music master. The CD is more Film Score style so it 
is not dance music what so ever. More ambient downtempo-ish. Good shit the 
First two movies on the series are a bit freaky and acidic (sp) Trippy 
visual display. The 3 I like alot are 1.618 Nice cinematic style vid and 
track. The anhtkythera mecanism because it has people in the vid very good 
work. And last but not least is Good morning Kaia a tribute to his daughter 
freakin awesome sound and video work on that one, my favorite by far out of 
them all.

BT keeps suprising me with each new record release a musician among 
musicians!!!

If you have the means I say pick it up, but keep in mind it is not a dance 
album, but more a collection of songs and short movie clips.

Oh man.  I am sad to hear this Apollo.  FWIW, your postings have always and continue to mean a lot to me and others on this list. 

I remember NYE a couple of years back I was at Arc in NYC.  Sander Kleinenberg was spinning.  My wife and I met this couple, Danny and I forget the girls name.  Danny was in a wheelchair and was paralyzed from the waist down.  He was wheeling that chair all over the place and popping wheelies. He had a huge smile on his face.  In fact I think he was the happiest guy in the place. His spirit was unbroken and I saw that anything was possible that night.  I know  I'll never ever forget him.

I hope you will get back to on the dance floor somehow or other.  I want to be there when it happens.

Regards,

Peter

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Thanks for the review Macadio, I think I'm going to have to buy this right
away since it sounds like something in my style.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] has SFR lost relevance?

This is what I've seen happen over time.

First, we had BBS's.  They ruled.
Then came the net, now we're all connected if you were in college.  ;)
Then came the web.  The masses discovered Email.
Lists were where it's at.  All content delivered to your desktop.
Then came forums.  Every site now had it's own BBS.  Lots and lots of 
accounts to create (we're still in this inane cycle)
Now you have what I refer to as BBS 4.0:  Tribe, MySpace, Free Ass, 
Tagworld, Friendster, etc.  Of these, Tribe & MySpace are the most 
useful, Tribe being moreso because of the BBS capabilities there are 
part of the basic structure.

Will things migrate back to lists?  Who knows.  Consumers constantly 
flip flop between the Mega Stores and boutiwue specialty shops.  Think 
of Sears, Wards, JC Penny in the 60-70's, the rise of the Mall Shop in 
the 80's ad 90's and now the flop back to mega stores- eg Costco, 
Walmart, Target, etc.

Trends change, things evolve and advance.  Nothing stays stagnant or it 
dies.

I'm waiting for everything to go 100% mobile tied into the various 
things.  Simple submission, filters for what you care about, Auto date 
book, text sms, tied into desktop as well.  Things auto updateing via 
WiFi or cell so that when you decide you want to go do something, and 
based on what your filter criteria are, you can get on your mobile 
device a list of club, event, underground, etc etc.

Stuff like RSS is leading toward this in a big way, I'm just waiting for 
some crazy uber geek to take all these unrelated emerging techs to 
intergrate into the next system.

However, I think lists will slowly wither, especially when you could 
easily migrate to something like tribe, set up a private tribe, talk as 
we do here about whatever, all nicely threaded, platform independent.  
Get everything here plus anything else you are into on a personal 
level.  With Tribe you can also subscribe to a tribe via RSS so you 
could watch your groups while using your fave email program at work or 
what have you.

ok...  now I'm just geek rambling.  ;)

However, the lsit could do with a bit of promotion, and if there was more content only available through the list, i.e. like a really useful activity calendar, then people would come here to get that content.  In the absence of that its just digestive rumblings from the peanut gallery and the much welcomed BSPs and party reviews.

Why?

Are you afraid of discussion?

I happen to agree with Steve.


Let's say we're at war with Germany (again).  Germany is populated by 
mostly white people.  The war is not racist based on the population 
that opposes us.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tiesto live sets

Well at least one set of Pumas there.  I'm all about the clydes bc my feet are sort of wide.  I started wearing them back in junior high when I was a skater. 

That was a looong time ago. Back when funk was new...many of the people on this list were not born yet.

I'm stoked there is a DJ shoe website tho.

Peace,

Peter

So far, you've contributed Jack and Shit to the discussion.

Maybe you should try just throwing insults.

Well.. so like my Wife & I... we just had our 8th birth 2 weeks ago &
well.. we had triplets this time around... Barnaby, Babsy, & Bobsy... it's
hard finding a babysitter for all our 11 kids... Thankfully Joven Riley
Darcus is 13 now (his bday just passed like recenlty) & he kinda gets it &
helps out more now... but like B-girl twinz Ellen Lisa Rose & Maria Daisy,
Von Ryan, the b-boy twins Derrick & Donald, Joee Gee, Brenda Sunshine, &
Carlo David... well.. their all still young & they all Love each other...
each time i've posted on craigslist that we got a mondo babysitting job
for like 3 babysitters on the same night... people get scared as soon as
the walk in & like leave right away... Thankfully we havve alota relatives
who would step up & Baby sit... luckily also that i work from home & can
keep an eye on them during the day... but I also have a night job @ a Bar
where i also bartend like kinda part time... well.. i kinda own the bar...

But I like being on this list 'cause it's refreshing to see things
happening inthe Bay area & I get to keep tabs on a few of my favorite DJs
& what they been doing... I've also been on this list long enough that I
have made jumungo friends on here who i Love w/ all my heart!!!

yeah... crazy.. but still fun! :)

I use tribe, MySpace, hi5 and the like but I do so with the knowledge that I'm creating an information feast for marketers and other cultural powers as well as truly Dark Forces.  :-)  But then your "friends" often upload much more than EDM or BSPs.....

Yes, I agree! Osby makes SFR 10000x better. If I had to choose two parties,
one with my favorite type of music and one with so-so music and Osby, I
would go to the Osby attended event.  Good memories with that guy and most
of the rest of you here.

You should go to the party with the good music,=20
since Osby will be there too, later in the night, when it's going off.  :)

I will get my ramble in too.. ;P

Something right along this lines is one of my main contracts add to this 
the GIS aspect; just about done with a 1st beta release of an optimized 
vector rendering engine that includes the avatar concept that runs in 
browsers and as its own standalone desktop browser application; eventually 
mobile phones; I'd like to do something for the Sidekick3 1st.. Anyway, 
welcome to the vector based geospatial web.. To hit desktop 1st then mobile 
soon after.. ;) Woo.. Finally became a code mercenary (contractor) recently 
and back to running EGR Software; getting back to SF soon too and the fuck 
out of Fremont.. Interesting thing is that my other contract is with the 
company I previously worked for 6 months ago and that is for a mobile 
testing / automation system with real devices; like having Timbuktu / VNC 
for mobile devices over the internet; more of an enterprise solution for 
testing/monitoring on the developer side of things...

 > However, I think lists will slowly wither, especially when you could 
easily migrate to something like tribe

Since Tribe supports FOAF (lots of other social networks do as well Live 
Journal, etc.) or at least a limited subset it might be possible to carry 
on your social network on with you when further migration occurs, etc.

 > With Tribe you can also subscribe to a tribe via RSS

It's all about GeoRSS and a somewhat related (geo microformat), but broader 
tech called Microformats these days... ;)

Best,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Terrorists "drive taxi cabs in the daytime and kill at night"

Am I afraid of discussion? No. What I'm afraid of, is having another week 
filled wiht angry fucking ravers, bitchign at each other over politics.

You two have your opinions - and everyone else has theirs.

Opinions are like assholes - everyones got 'em, and they ALL STINK.

So let's stick to music and drugs...at least most of us can agree that at 
least on a basic level, we all like 'em ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Metrosexual Alert!!!!!

Heh.  That's on my Birthday if I recall correctly.  If you guys do wear skirts, please please DO wear underwear.  

Actually since its mentioned, the proper way to do this not to wear skirts, but women's lingerie.  At least that was the way ot was done back at UCSC's Step on My Face parties.  Somewhere out there is a picture of me when I was much younger qand thinner wearing a pink teddy.  Thank god this was before the Web and MySpace.

(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_College for alittle more information on Step On My Face)

Thanks,

Peter

P.S.  The Wikipedia article on Porter College omits that fact that the croquet matches were generally played under the influence of certain chemicals with a three letter acronym. I may have to edit that.

I got dragged to Tiesto at Rain here in Las Vegas....
and he sucks... Music for dj's is not meant to be
played for 7 minutes a track with 3 "above the clouds"
break-downs... It's meant to be mixed, orchestrated
and bound into a new composition... HE DID NOT DO ANY
MIXING that was more than 20 seconds...

WEAK AS FUCK. 9 records an hour is not DJ'ing... its
JUKE BOXING!

break-downs... It's meant to be mixed, orchestrated
and bound into a new composition... HE DID NOT DO ANY
MIXING that was more than 20 seconds...

WEAK AS FUCK. 9 records an hour is not DJ'ing... its
JUKE BOXING!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tiesto sux...

This will be the only case I will ever defend Tiesto. For me, it's
about track selection. I don't care about how long and intricate the
mixes are. I've had some of my favorite tracks messed up by too much
interweaving, as a matter of fact. 20-45 seconds is plenty time to get
your point across and transition smoothly.

Yessss, but to clarify...I caught Assault live about 8 years ago and
loved the beats, but the whole "nipples and clits" anthem turned me

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tiesto sux...

wow. twice now posters have not thoroughly read what i wrote. there's
no way in hell you could claim i like tiesto. what i said was that, in
his defense, i don't think the success is in the mix. it's in the
track selection. i don't claim to enjoy tiesto at all, but i don't
think anybody whose mixes last 20 seconds should be lambasted.

This will be the only case I will ever defend Tiesto. For me, it's
about track selection. I don't care about how long and intricate the
mixes are. I've had some of my favorite tracks messed up by too much
interweaving, as a matter of fact. 20-45 seconds is plenty time to get
your point across and transition smoothly.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tiesto sux...

We can't ever setermine Tiesto's degree of suck-itude until we know what sort of shoes he wears.  The shoes are critical in a DJ, more important than either track selection or mixing ability.

Peace,

Peter

This will be the only case I will ever defend Tiesto. For me, it's
about track selection. I don't care about how long and intricate the
mixes are. I've had some of my favorite tracks messed up by too much
interweaving, as a matter of fact. 20-45 seconds is plenty time to get
your point across and transition smoothly.

Crack and H, the two drugs I promised myself I would never do because I
probably would love it too much. Sometimes it is better to just not try
things, that way you never know what you are missing. I always wonder what I
would be like if I never took that first drop back at 880 Barnveled back in
2000 (Some Brainchild event). God what a great night. No regrets. But
seriously, what would I be like now? A closed minded
antidisestablismentarianist jerk?

How the hell does he do that??? He was at TELIC when I stumbled into a free
party one windy night. Then he was in sacramento in the snow with crazed
australian tweakers. At the psytrance outdoor behind some horse stables.
You're all "Man, this party is crackin!!!1" And Osby's like right over your
shoulder, some kind of weird situationally invoked spirit, "Hello2day!!11 it

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: for Marc(o)

Personally I like to do as much research and asking around as possible
before trying any substance.

I found some to be fun and/or mind expanding with what I consider to be as
harmful as drinking or eating too much: bud, rolls, shrooms, lsd (very
occasionally)

On the other hand, I have had people tell me to just stay away from what
they considered to be the really bad shit: coke, H, crank, meth

I have still never tried those baddies to this day. No close minded jerk
here...

Perhaps all parties should begin with an Osby Invocation Ceremony.

"It is our Will to invoke the egregore of Osby, so that by his spirit we experience the power of Music and Dance and obtain his Word Of Power!"

Adapted from:  http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Labyrinth/6603/invoke.html

Peace,

Peter

How the hell does he do that??? He was at TELIC when I stumbled into a free
party one windy night. Then he was in sacramento in the snow with crazed
australian tweakers. At the psytrance outdoor behind some horse stables.
You're all "Man, this party is crackin!!!1" And Osby's like right over your
shoulder, some kind of weird situationally invoked spirit, "Hello2day!!11 it
sure is!"

          ecstasy has made my girlfriend look butt ugly in the dark :(    
                                                      
---------------------------------
                    hey guys, long time roller first time poster  i have rolled for a long time and have never had a bad experience off ecstasy. its a fantastic drug and has changed my life for the better. unfortunatly the same does not go for my girlfriend, she always spews (even if only one pill and sometimes half) and always feels sick at some stage regardless of how the rest of us have been hit.
 
 im assuming her body doesent agree with the drug or she is alot more sensitive to the chemicals but i dont let her do it very often becaues of that. but now comes the scary part, the other night we were rolling together at my house, we were havin a great time and one of my mates rang up to say he was coming around. we went out the front in the dark and sat on the road. i looked over at her and my heart stopped, I ACTUALLY SCREAMED LIKE A GIRL! i thought i was sitting next to a totally different person! her face was completly changed! in real life she is a model - she is extremly attractive! but fuck me dead she dead set looked like a cross between michael jackson, and one of them apes off planet of the apes. but her eyes were really dark and her lips were really dark and the rest of her skin was white as anything. HER HAIR EVEN LOOKED LIKE DUDES HAIR!! (but that could be cos it was tied back) either way i was scared, no matter how long or close or far away i looked at her
 she still looked the same - THIS WAS NO HALUCINATION! i took her to the light, as soon as she entered the light she was normal - same beutiful girl. i took her back to the dark, APEGIRL AFTER PLASTIC SURGERY WAS BACK! 
 
 i feel terrible i think i have hurt her with my reaction, i have to admit it would have been priceless to see though. what im here to ask thouhg is what could have possibly caused something like this!! i really just have no explanation at all, i cant imagine that being a halucination, theres no way it was! i've been trippin for 4 years and never seen anything like this! can someone please enlighten me? im confused as anything!

Shit that usually happens all the time with me, at around pill 3 or 4.  Thi=
s
one time some friends and i went to this warehouse party in the mission
somewhere (super small scale party, mellow but cool).  Anyway, we had these
pills called LifeSavers.  Big ass lookin pills, they had something else in
them because i've never hallucinated so badly off of just one pill.  At one
point during the party some thugs decided they wanted to try and bust in on
the party but the door guys held them off, so they decided to get some
fireworks and toss them in the mail slot.  They were going off all over and
they people throwing the party had the music shut off temporarily so we
could call the cops and get them removed from the area.  I remember at one
point i was sitting on the stairs talking to some people at the party and
they guy i was talking to started to morph right in front of me.  His face
turned inside out and flipped end over end and then turned normal again.
This happened a couple of times and then he asked me why i was laughing, so
i had to try and explain it to him.

That was all off the first pill, and i think that weekend we ended up doing
a 3 day/party binge and we got up to pill 9 by that Sunday.  Oh man, those
were the good ol days when i had braincells and cash to burn.

If you really wanna see your girlfriend get real ugly real quick, try
popping 25 pills of dramamine.  Talk about scary!!!!

Hmm. I'd be speculating, however, that rarely stops me from typing.

Sometimes this particular substance lets you see into someone's heart rathe=
r than just noticing their outward appearance.

In the light her outward appearance was too strong for this effect to be no=
ticed, "in real life she is a model - she is extremly attractive! ", but in=
 the dark he could see what was underneath.

In other words, he probably just noticed that his girlfriend is a shallow b=
itch and his brain interpreted that realization as an "ugly" outward appear=
ance.

Just a theory of course since I don't know any of the people in question.

Peace,

Peter

Sounds like someone put an RC in those pills. I once, a long time ago had A
LOT (1g) of 5-meo-mipt, which was active around the 5 mg range, well, I
accidentally took ~30mg cause my scale was off and I didn't know it (doesn'=
t
take much to make a scale go off in those ranges). I was sitting on the
couch and my friend was watching fox news, the Bill O'reilly show. That guy
turned into a devil, something I always felt about him. Seriously, horns
grew out of his head, his teeth turned to fangs, eyes blood red, and his
face grey hair like a caveman. The experience was so crazy that I quickly
got up to go to the bathroom. Blood was everywhere and when I pee'ed it was
all red (not really of course). Then I made the worst mistake, I stared at
myself in the mirror. My face went pale and wrinkles grew out, my facial an=
d
scalp hair grew long, then grey and then fell out, my eyes lost all life an=
d
then melted away to black holes where they once were. Then my skin started
flaking off and bugs covered over everything. All that was left was a skull=
.
I literally saw myself physically live the rest of my life. Then I closed m=
y
eyes, which was brighter then when they were open, and when I finally opene=
d
them everything was back to normal. Later that night I almost (thank god)
ended up in the ER due to my pulse rate going sky high and freaking out.
Moral of the story: clean your scale often and make sure it is balanced
properly.

The experience was so crazy that I later gave all my RCs to friends and
never again touched them.

Whoops.  

I actually own that CD so I should have known better.  Thanks for the correction.

PVD, Tiesto, etc.  I still don't know what kind of shoes to buy.

BTW what sort of shoes does Chris Carter wear?  This is vital need to know information.

Peace,

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Tiesto sux... and a new form of interactive rave (copyright Eric Spire september 5, 2006)

Wow, poor soul. So what you are syaing is you love
listening to juke boxes that have an appearance you
appreciate, and jump around in a way that pleases you.
YAY.

I propose a new for of trance DJ just like the
broadway show "Avenue Q." It will be crowd
interactive. We can program a laptop to play the
tracks with 20 second overlaps, and people can put
their requests in before they get looped on E. Then,
as they are just coming on, a puppet acting as a bingo
master will pull the winning track selections from a
bingo wheel. Each tracklist will get its own puppet.
Then, as your tracklist comes on, you can lay on the
floor glowing in your self absorbed lustfullness, and
jump up when each breakdown comes, approximately every
2.5 minutes. Your puppet will also become very excited
at this moment, and propably pound a record into the
air for effect. After the break, the puppet will look
around for something to make him/her look busy for a
couple of more minutes, while you again laydown on the
floor. Repeat.

And of course, the puppets will all have special
shoes.

We will call the raves Muppet Y2K6.

Now I am going to vomit.

Eric

BT -  This Binary Universe.

Watch it on a high end DVD 5.1 system and prepare for an amazing experience.
Beats 2 channels and even the best winamp plugins (trust me I've tried them
all).

The music is all electronic ambient, amazingly very organic, with acoustic
guitar loops that sometimes are chopped into just a milliseconds length.
Then out of nowhere comes the ephemeral pads bringing euphoria and
reflection in the best of ways.

Steve,

Regrets are pointless.   No regrets.

But do you think you could have achieved that any other way? You can change your perspective through sex, mediation, car racing, world travel, joining the peace corp., dancing, art, etc.  There are many possiblities.

It seems to me that drugs are a pretty dangerous path especially for certain people.  Other people seem to be able to dabble without wrecking their lives.  The problem is you don't know which one you are until its too late.

I'm certainly not a prude about it or anything, I grew up in Berkeley in the seventies, but I've also been close with people that have serious problems because of both legal and illegal drugs.

So I am wondering now, from where you are, do you think that you can you grow your perspective and explore new possibilities without drugs?  What is your path?

Just some late night thoughts, feel free to ignore if I'm in too deep.

Peace,

Peter

Crack and H, the two drugs I promised myself I would never do because I probably would love it too much. Sometimes it is better to just not try things, that way you never know what you are missing. I always wonder what I would be like if I never took that first drop back at 880 Barnveled back in 2000 (Some Brainchild event). God what a great night. No regrets. But seriously, what would I be like now? A closed minded antidisestablismentarianist jerk?

Note, I do not condone the use of crack cocaine.  It is bad shit.  Do not use this stuff people.

But the site is funny and I dig the art.

You left out the biofeedback loop to measure audience physiological repsonse to the tracks:  http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1563

Oh and I guess also to the pizza, hookers, drugs, gambling, and evil demented puppets.

Over his secret prisons speach?  I don't follow.  Maybe I haven't taken the right drugs tho...

The thing that's so harmful and dangerous about this situation is that we may very well have something to be concerned about with regard to terrorism, but now after all the lies and misdirection from our own government who knows?  Its a hall of mirrors and you can't tell what to believe.  

Tell us the truth.

Peace,

Peter

Despite my earlier kvetchings about Assault's booty-porn lyrics...I'm
actually really psyched to see so much nightlife diversity from ghetto
tech to minimal. May every gig GO OFF this weekend big time!

...and I'll be at Club Six's Dark Room with James Patrick for some
serious DRUG MUSIC! HAHA.

(Apparantly, the new term for minimal techno is "Tesh" cause
well...the more accurate minimal tech-house is too long and what's
labeled as "minimal techno" doesn't really sound that 'minimal.')

A second stage has been added this year featuring an array of cutting edge local artists. Sunday September 10th at 1pm, Yoga Sangha of San Francisco will be hosting the Power to the Peaceful, "Be Peace Now Yoga Jam: A day of Yoga, Music and Activism", with Yoga teachers Shiva Rea, Nickie Doane and Eddie Modestini, Katchie Ananda, Acro-Yoga with Jason Nemer and Jenny Sauer-Klein, guest speakers Matthew and Terces Engelhart (Cafe Gratitude), Robi Damelin and Nadwa Sarandah and acoustic musical performances by Michael Franti, Jai Uttal others. 

PTTP Festival has been graced with inspirational performances by Michael Franti and Spearhead, KRS-One, String Cheese Incident, Saul Williams, Keller Williams, Blackalicious, Alice Walker, Ram Dass, Talib Kweli, Amy Goodman, The Coup, Digital Underground, Woody Harrelson, Lyrics Born, Anti-Flag, Jello Biafra and Angela Davis and many others.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Who's at Get Freaky?

And Bukem is this weekend? Joe Nice is playing that night too at Temple, so 
I'll most likely wind up there at some point, even though a PROPER Endup 
night is being planned...hehe.

Jennifer, next time you have sex with your significant

seconds is plenty of time to get your point across.

The peoplz that run Temple are cockfuckers.. only interested in your money 
or your honeys.. they could care less about scene, vibe, or you.  Please 
don't support Temple untill they actually make a contribution to something 
other then themselves.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] This week.

They booked my boy Joe Nice, therefore they contribute to the scene, in 
that,  like Joe Nice, he is my pal, and I shall go see him.

It's in my opinion that 99% of promoters only care about your money...cuz 
hey, they don't wanna throw events to be poor!

I don't care how "down for the scene" they are in heart - they all still 
want to AT LEAST break even, if not, make profit. And honestly, who can 
blame them? It's called CAPITALISM BITCH!

HAHA! Me too!

Kinda like my old girlfriend test...back in the day, I'd play Barry White on 
a 1st date. If the chicky thought I was serious (like, playing ol' Barry to 
wet her panties up), and she caught 'tude - she got kicked to the curb. The 
ones that laughed got a 2nd date.

People with no sense of humour suck my asshole after a particularly spicy 
Indian dinner.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Minimal Tech/House mixes - suggestions?

Stuff on Kompakt Records is tight, so is Palette recordings, Viewlexx, 
Spectral, U-Freqs, Perlon and a buncha other labels I'm forgetting.

Some artists:

John Tejada
Arian Leviste
Isolee' (which is actually a bit more IDM)
L'usine (also a bit more IDM, but similar)
Justin Maxwell
Reinhard Voigt
Akufen
Carl Craig
Casey Hogan
Joel Mull

That oughtta get you started....

Woot!

Ok, I know I've had a lot of drama posts here lately, but I promise this
isn't one. I'm in a good mood, just want to hear what others do about these
type of thoughts.

I turned 30 a few months back, it seems a lot of time has passed. I have
lots of memories, good and bad that haunt me. They really really haunt me,
especially the good ones. I think back at when my child was a todler, or
times with friends and it's sad to have seen those times go. It's almost as
if it is over. For a long time I could just ignore memories and live in the
present and future, but lately it seems all I can do is drown myself in
these thoughts.

I'm only 24, and for the most part I forget about all
those years that came before. But then I'll get in a
mood for thinking back, just sit in a nice comfortable
chair (or couch) and bring myself back.

For me it always seems I get this kind of churning,
but refreshing feeling in my gut, thinking about just
how technicolor things are when you were just a little
kid. I like my life now, but it would just be so much
fun to be that little 5 year old again, for just a
couple minutes. I can't even imagine what it's like
for ACTUAL old people (you know, you folks 30 and over
...)

Hmmm...Deep thoughts....
   
  Well, Im 28, on my way to 30 in a year and a half. (Gee, Im so excited.)
I also go through the same type of shit on a daily basis, and I guess the way I deal with it, is just remembering that 10 years from now, I can either:
   
  1)Dwell on it all over and over again, with the same result occuring each time
  or
  2)Realize that if I stay in that frame of mind, Ill be doing the same thing 10 years from now and feeling even worse, because then Id be even older, with less time remaining in my life to create new memories.
   
  Sometimes, its a great release to spin, play an instrument (not the skin flute!) or even just write your thoughts down...
   
  My 2-
   
  P.S.-- I was on this list like 6-7 years ago, moved to AZ where the "scene" was so retarded I stopped going to parties.
  Anyway, I just recently moved backto the south bay, and im interested in seeing what its like out here these days.
  Wheres all the dope househeads at?!?!?!
   
  I used to hella dig jeno, garth, erik brown, spun, etc
  My tastes are mostly deep house, downtempo, funk, disco, etc..
   
  Can anyone give me some recommendations on local djs, the vibe of parties these days, etc??
   
  Thanks for reading,
   
  Its great to back!

We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

They are over - it's the past!


Your memories are what you have left over to remember and cherish 
these events that have passed.  Surely you've lost a grandparent by 
now?  But do you cry every day for their loss, or remember the happy 
times you had together?

I guess I'm confused by what you mean by "haunt."  Remembering good 
times isn't bad..

I have much respect for Erik.  Yes, he is still spinning (house of course) and is one of the Yerba Bueno Discos artists:


SOUTH HAMPTON 
 
Erik Brown, also known as South Hampton, began his music career as a singer and drummer in a high school rock band. However, with the explosion of the Bay Area rave scene, it was only natural that he move away from his rock roots into DJ work. He quickly became a fixture in the Bay Area party scene, producing and spinning records at the Temple, Magic, and Bodyrock events. 

Erik quickly developed a well-deserved reputation as one of the North Bays most notorious party monsters. He produced the best events, played the best music, and partied harder than any one else in the scene. Unfortunately, the party was brought to an untimely end with the death of San Francisco's underground rave scene, paired with an accident which left Erik paralyzed from the waist down. After a year or two of soul-searching and recovery, Erik threw himself back into the arms of the house music he loved, becoming serious about music production and even opening a very ahead-of-its-time record and clothing store in his native Santa Rosa. 

For 2004 and early 2005, Erik left his old persona behind, changing his name to South Hampton. He joined forces with Yerba Buena Discos, putting his funky stamp on both the music and the artistic style of the label. It was a natural fit - disco plus funk. However, after producing some great tracks, Erik has left us to launch his own label, Box Ready Records. 

As for his contributions to the underground house music scene, an unusually reflective Erik comments on his continued success, "You can continue enjoying your dreams in the wake of adversity."

We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

Yeah then we'd just end up with shitty local DJs playing bad music =
poorly
for free at most events.  But we'd be TOTALLY underground.  You can be =
"in

not.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

I'm going to be 45 next week.  

But I see the world with fresh eyes everyday.  It helps that I have a 1.5 and 3 year old running around to remind me that the smallest most trival thing can be amazing.

There are two parts to being old.  One part is in your body.  Stuff wears out.  You creak and crack.  You can exercise, eat right, etc.  but in the end there isn't much you can do about this part.

The other part is in your mind.  Most of the people I know that are my age act old.  They think old.  They become old, because of their thinking not their bodies.  This part you can do something about.  You don't ever need to be old in your mind.

Get a pail and shovel, head to the beach, and build a sand castle. Roll down a grassy hill.  Get some fingerpaints. 

Don't be a grown up!

Peace,

Peter

I'm only 24, and for the most part I forget about all
those years that came before. But then I'll get in a
mood for thinking back, just sit in a nice comfortable
chair (or couch) and bring myself back.

For me it always seems I get this kind of churning,
but refreshing feeling in my gut, thinking about just
how technicolor things are when you were just a little
kid. I like my life now, but it would just be so much
fun to be that little 5 year old again, for just a
couple minutes. I can't even imagine what it's like
for ACTUAL old people (you know, you folks 30 and over
...)

Life became VERY interesting for me at 30.  Hasn't stopped yet.  20's were 
downright boring on compairison.

How about for the music, for the people, for friends, for family, for 
burningman, for noteriety, for popularity, for pussy, for community, for 
publicity, for a record deal..

How about for all the other reasons other than sucking money out of the 
people you know.  I hear ya that clubs should be profitable.. but when they 
are only in it to maake money.. they will loose in the end.  Just sayin'

Yeah then we'd just end up with shitty local DJs playing bad music poorly
for free at most events.  But we'd be TOTALLY underground.  You can be "in
it" for many reasons but money is always a factor in that like it or not.

Well this will actually be my first time... so I'm really excited... ^_^

Also I missed the Love Parade in Berlin by 1 day... so am happy about this
coming up.

I have a specific question also... what about all ages events... that's why
I ask about under ground events in particular. What about the kids?!?!? ;)

Just be happy that you had the good times.  Be happy that you survived

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

Amen!!! I love my 30's!!!

Bear in mind that in MY 20's, I toured the southwest, midwest and parts of 
the east coast wtih a metal/punk band, and worked at just about every type 
of job you can imagine.

My point? My 20's were fucking AWESOME! But my 30's have eclipsed my 20's 
thus far in terms of sheer quality of life/friendships/fun, etc.

No matter what is done, somebody is going to have to foot a=20
bill.  Somewhere, at some point.  Typically the more free the event=20
(Burningman, Love Parade) the more it actually costs you.  Everything from=
=20
rent, power, permits, etc etc on up to insurance and porta-potties,=20
somebody has to foot the bill.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re: Well well love parade is coming...

I have attended the previous two SF Love Parades, the first one was fun and
last year's was much sweeter (better route, planning, food, etc). I am
definitely looking forward to this one.

Usually I tire out before any of the after parties, but this year I have a
few friends spinning at Evil Breaks @ SOMArts (Red Stickman and Calamity
Jane) and then (and yes I know everyone from the bay area hates him) but I
do love Oakenfold and its pretty sweet he will be here this year. I
hopefully will hear him in the parade so I dont have to pay the $40 at the
after party to go see him.

On a personal note, I have been on a bud-break for a while now and will not
toke again until this lovefest. Should be fun...and of course some sex after
the long day of partying.

So dangrsmind, that covers music, drugs and sex...feel better about this
post? heh

Well this will actually be my first time... so I'm really excited... ^_^

Also I missed the Love Parade in Berlin by 1 day... so am happy about this
coming up.

I have a specific question also... what about all ages events... that's why
I ask about under ground events in particular. What about the kids?!?!? ;)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

I will be turning 30 myself in January and yes, those mid-20 memories are
truly missed. I treasure those memories, use them to help me grow and
realize the world around me.

I cannot let regret set in, it will just ruin them for me. To me those
memories should always give me happiness and not pain and sorrow. Yes you
cannot relive those happy times but if you could, they would not be as
valued as they are to you now.

There are more happy memories to come Steve. Just keep that chin up and
consider yourself fortunate you had such wonderful times to begin
with...most people dont/cant/wont.

30 was a few years back for me. Memories are still unfolding..... I can't 
party like I use to back in my mid to late 20's, but the partying I do now, is 
much more fulfilling..... Age means nothing.....

Holy shit! Temple is the old DV8 club. Loved that place to death 94-95 
when they were doing Wickeds and Spundaes there.

Too bad I'm booked for Stargasm this weekend, would really like to see the 
DV8 space again.

The "times" have not left you Steve.  In Buddhist-Hindu-Taoist and other traditions, now reinforced by modern physics, time is not linear but cyclical, repeating in a loop like a Mbius strip and always returning to the source.  The concept of linear time in the West is rather recent and arose with the use of mechanical watches and other devices.  Consensus reality is not "truth," merely a convenient construct -- an ilusion.  I think there is no past, present or future:)  Your "memories" are as "real" as the cubical you inhabit right now.  Not to worry.

Prolly be a good idea, then, to buy the yearly $200.00 "Bliss Pass" and save on clubbing essentials like bottle service and expedited drink service.  The Temple opens this Saturday with Jeno and Galen in the "Catacombs."

Ain't the old DV8, Peter, so don't expect that original psychedelic vibe:)  Keith Haring Room is gone, of course, and the interior is much more upscale -- renovated extensively.  Not for the Pete Avila-type crowd.  But wait, that crowd is well over 30 now so maybe.  Lotta bottles instead of wee pills.

My two favorite clubs in the late 80's were the DV8 and 1015.  I can always revisit in my memories.  Dance all nite long in the fog.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

Everybody told me that turning 30 was gonna be major insane oh no suxxor shit.  I heard that from many many people.  I had personally been going through serious age issues since 25- I got started early, so it didn't hit me like the proverbial ton of bricks initially.

Since then I've been going through serious old-raver-and-music-days withdrawl off and on.  Some serious rose-colored glasses shit.  My 20s were all about getting nothing done and dating girls who mistreated me, interspersed with some pretty amazing moments.  My late 20s and early 30s have been a fricking awesome breeze in comparison, if you look with an unjaundiced eye at it.

I think my 30s are going to continue to only get better.  The rave scene I loved is dead, or perhaps what lived inside of me in those days is dead, but my spirit lives on and has fun in new avenues now.  I'm living with an amazing girl and making the best music I've ever made.  I think it's gonna be alright.

I think I'm more put upon by the state of our country than I ever was by age worries.  Now THAT's some life-sucking shit.

Keep on keepin' on and most of all know you can always lose yourself in music when you feel down.

I will be turning 30 myself in January and yes, those mid-20 memories are
truly missed. I treasure those memories, use them to help me grow and
realize the world around me.

I cannot let regret set in, it will just ruin them for me. To me those
memories should always give me happiness and not pain and sorrow. Yes you
cannot relive those happy times but if you could, they would not be as
valued as they are to you now.

There are more happy memories to come Steve. Just keep that chin up and
consider yourself fortunate you had such wonderful times to begin
with...most people dont/cant/wont.

Hmm... so only like 7 years for me to go and I'll have
peace eh? LOL my 20's so far are pretty turbulent. You
thirty-somethings seem like everything is kinda sorted
for you by now. Good to know that this chaos isn't
going to last forever hehe :D

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

I was identifying with a client today that was 50+ with two grown 
children, talking about how turbulent her life has been.  She's a 
little stressed, but mostly happy now that she's found a good job 
with benefits. It doesn't sound like there's any rest in our futures; 
we both agreed we'd probably work until we die.

I'll be thirty in just two years, but I too have been thinking about 
it since I was 25, so I wouldn't be crushed by it all at once.  I've 
been setting goals for personal growth over long periods of time.  I 
think it's only going to get better, and while I cherish the memories 
I have, I don't wish to live in the past.

I think the only time when I was truly happy, was when I was a little 
kid, and every need was taken care of.  Ignorance is bliss, but it's 
possible to be happy w/o being blissful.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

i think each decade brings with it new experiences and we're lucky  
only to hold on to some of the memories of the good times of our  
younger years; for me, some of those people are dead, or we've moved  
on and lost contact.  i try not to focus on the bad things that have  
happened; i believe they're a good reference point for lessons  
learned, but too much attracts more bad things.

i remember someone i once looked up to at 40 mentioned his life was  
half over.  and though i learned a lot from that person, i want  
more.  i'm planning to live to 150.  that's fine, call me crazy, the  
typical reactions i get are either you're crazy or i don't want to  
live that long.  it would be my strong hope that some of the people i  
know or have known in the past and today would be there too.

anyway, the reason i'm bringing this up is that goal gives me  
something to live for, and the curiosity of what is to come is  
exciting to me.  it can be exciting to any of you, too, that allow  
it, and i think you might find if you allow that to flow into your  
being, you might find it can put a very fresh outlook on those past  
memories you were, oh so lucky to experience, even the bad things.

and aren't we lucky to even remember them?  according to science, we  
cast of millions of dead cells every day and grow new ones.   
physically, we're a whole new person every, how long?  i don't think  
you need to have a goal to live a really long life to be happy, but i  
do think curiosity is a cornerstone to keeping the mind and body  
vibrant and healthy.

You have to be careful about thinking your life is "half over" I think.

I am reminded of an incident I heard about where the Buddhist teacher Pema Chodron was saying goodbye to some students after a teaching.  One of the students said "See you next time!" to which Pema responded "Unless we die!"

Today might be your last day.  You might think you life is half over and it might really be 99% over.  You might never get that new mixer you are saving up for.  You might never see your wife ro girlfriend or child again.

Or perhaps there will be some medical miracle and your life will really be only 10% over.  You just don't know.   

Live each day like its your last.  Live each day like its your first.  Easy to say and hard to do.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

In college I read Suzuki's Zen Mind, Beginer's Mind as well as Tarthang Tulku's Gesture of Balance.  I can recommend both of these books without hesitation and I think they are both highly accesible. Also find a copy of Zen Flesh,Zen Bones, which is one of my favorite books of all time.  I mentioned Pema Chodron, and I think you might find her books The Places that Scare You: A Guide to Fearlessness in Difficult Times and Comfortable with Uncertainty: 108 Teachings on Cultivating Fearlessness and Compassion useful.  Her writing style is direct, simple, and almost touching I think.  Chodron was a student of the infamous Chogyam Trungpa, and many of his books are fantastic.  I especially like The Lion's Roar: An Introduction to Tantra, Crazy Wisdom, and Training the Mind and Cultivating Loving Kindness but his books The Myth of Freedom and the Way of Meditation and Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism are also important.  Interestingly I haven't found any of the Dalai Lama's
 books to be that compelling, but I know a lot of other people like them.  I'd be delighted to share any of the books in my library with you.

Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching is a must read also.  Maybe some else can recommend a specific translation.

Depending on what appeals to you there are lots of other books out there.  FWIW I am a practicing Tibetan Buddhist, but this style doesn't appeal to a lot of people.  Most people I know prefer the sedate minimalist approach of Zen, as compared to the more "psychedelic" Tibetan schools.  Check out the Tibetan Mahamudra and Dzogchen teachings in particular.

I've practiced in the highly controversial New Kadampa Tradition which is headed by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.  I find Geshe-la's books to be accessible and practical, if often a bit dry and boring.  I'd recommend the new version of the Meditation Handbook as well as Clear Light of Bliss.  You should know however that NKT is at odds with the traditional Buddhist schools and Tibetan government as headed by the Dalai Lama.  In fact the Dalai Lama has banned one of the primary NKT practices, which FWIW, I don't practice either.  This gets a bit obscure to say the least, I can provide links if you are interested.

One thing I think is important as a westerner is addressing the entire reincarnation thing.  To put it bluntly I've found it hard/mpossible to buy into the traditional teachings on reincarnation or the Tibetan system of reincarnate teachers and lamas.  I've found the Dzogchen teachings to be much more in line with a modern scientific thinking here.  A good resource online for Tibetan Buddhism in general is the Berzin Archives: http://www.berzinarchives.com/

Finally, I've recently gotten interested in Shaivism which predates Buddhist and Hindu tantric practices.  I read some books by Daniel Odier which were nice, and I can recommed his book on the "sacred tremor" or Spandakarika in particular.  I've been reading Osho's (aka Rajaneesh) Book of Secrets which is a commentary on the Hindu VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA which is also included as an appendix in Zen Flesh, Zen Bones.  Osho has fallen into disrepute because of the actions of his followers up in Oregon, but I've found this book to be trully amazing and insightful.  And its available online in totality for free: http://www.oshoworld.com/tantra_medi/index.asp

I'm actually looking for a new Sangha (spiritual community) so if you are ever interested, I'd be willing to go with you to any meditaton center or class.  I know it was a bit weird for me at first and I went alone.  The worst part was the music, which in NKT isn't traditional Tibetan music which I would have prefered, but rather sort of bad folk music versions of TIbetan chants. Anyway we are lucky in San Francisco to have a great wealth of choices in this area.

Peace,

Peter

First of all, thank you to everyone that replied to my initial post. 
   
  With your help, along with the help of TicketAssassin, my case was dismissed and they're even sending me my $185.00 back. I probably would have just taken it in the backside if you guys hadn't of told me to take the fuckers on.
   
  Anyways, thanks again.
   
  Sincerely,
   
  Chuck (vs. The Man)

Hey chuck, I remember this issue being brought up on the list.  Can you
expand what your ticket was for and what you did to beat it?

thanks!

Ben,
   
  How's it going man? Ticket was for speeding Northbound on 280. When the CHP officer pulled me over, he said I was "paced by an aircraft doing 90 mph," although he had not witnessed this act himself. The irony is that I had my cruise control set around 70 to safely keep up with the flow of traffic.
   
  I was advised by SFR members to submit a plea of not guilty by mail along with my "bail" ($185.00). Also, a couple SFR heads recommended TicketAssassin which offers shareware & templates to people like me that need help in these jams. It cost $25 bucks for the membership, however it's money well spent IMHO.
   
  The court mailed me some documents pertaining to a "Trial by Written Declaration," in which I could submit a statement & evidence. Using a template from Ticket Assassin as the backbone of my written testimony, I managed to deliver a compelling case which was dismissed yesterday (yup, it took them a full month to review my testimony, even though the "trial" date was Aug. 8th). Found all this out over the phone today when I called them to check the status of my case. I guess it takes them six (6) weeks to mail my money back, but that still beats another kick in the nuts. 
   
  Best,
   
  Chuck

The one thing about Ticket Assasin that they never mentioned anywhere, that 
pissed me off royally, was the whole "send in the full amount if the ticket" 
part.

I have 2 ( WAY overdue) tickets, cuz when I sent in my "fight it through the 
mail" forms, I never mailed in checks.

I'm pretty sure my license is suspended and I have at least 1 warrant out in 
my name now. YAY.

Oh well - what's another $600 in fines to pay back anyway?

*sigh*

Sounds like you have a valid gripe to me. 
   
  Perhaps they've updated the site since you last used it? The instructions I read on their site said to pay the amount in full & wait for the refund. 
   
  Sorry to hear you didn't have as good of luck.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Chuck fought the law, AND WON! was Chuck vs. The Man- need ad

Shit happens. The reason I never sent a check was 'cuz I didn't wanna bounce 
a check to the State, hehe.

Prolly better I deal with it in payments or in cash and just take the stupid 
tickets.

Blah.

The fucked up thing was - I hadn't had a ticket in over 3 years. I got 
pulled over TWICE on Memorial Day weekend (go figure - end of the month and 
a big holiday - they weren't pulling me over for BS reasons now were they).

I hate cops. If any are reading this list - I hope you all wreck your 
cruisers.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

 >be here now

i am probably the only one that can't stand this phrase but it's  
because the only time i ever hear it is when some guy is trying to  
get in my pants and he's like fending off my anticipation of future  
regret.

but about past memories.
have you ever gone back to visit a house you lived in, far back in  
your past? Say when you were 6.
in your mind you remember the tree in the backyard being gigantic.   
the corner lot with the thick trees was a forest.  and then when you  
go back it looks so different, so much smaller.  the tree isn't  
really that big and your forest was really just some scrub brush.   
even the loompia at the local filipino restaurant doesn't taste the  
same as your young childhood memories remember the sweet plum sauce  
just was more sweeter like liquid candy.  and you were so sure of  
things and spoke with conviction on how you felt, unvarnished.

it would be nice to feel that way again.

i don't know how other people manage to renew themselves, or feel  
that liberation that comes with innocence.  sometimes people buy  
stuff, toys for grown ups, hoping that it will satisfy.  others have  
children of their own so they can experience that newness again.  i  
mean i see what you're saying.

  people talk about the movie "groove" and i wonder is it really like  
that? (why am i here)  and if i have a good time at one place, like  
one good night, can it ever be repeated?  the euphoria is so intense  
there's a fear that no, it won't happen again and i will be  
disappointed.  and it's this fear of disappointment that separates  
this from children, who lack that cynicism and doubt.

i've been painting a lot lately, and they are childhood memories.   
impressions.  just the colors, and movement are the focus.  i  
remember so well the tastes, the smells, the magenta flowers, the  
blue green Gulf, blinding white sand, a calf sized tattoo of the  
Battle of Coral Sea and Doolittle's Raid, horn rimmed glasses, cigar  
smoke, aquamarine shag carpet, fire ants, inch worms, riding horses  
through a flooded field like the mt dew commercial, scorpions,  
mesquite trees, granite rock jettis

what are some of your memories?

When I saw them at the DNA earlier in the year I thought they were 
lip-synching about 95% of the time.  Anyone else at that show?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 30 years and a question

LOL   That has to be one of the oldest lines around, since its from Ram Dass' book with the same title which originally was published in 1971.

(Note to Steve Osteen, this is also a pretty cool little book)

OK, being an old married dude I feel I can ask the question that all the younger single guys are afraid to ask:

    Does that line work? 

Just kidding really; since I'm also the parent of a teenager I am used to asking embrassing questions without the slightest hesitation.  

Nice post BTW.

Peace,

Peter

 >be here now

i am probably the only one that can't stand this phrase but it's  
because the only time i ever hear it is when some guy is trying to  
get in my pants and he's like fending off my anticipation of future  
regret.

but about past memories.
have you ever gone back to visit a house you lived in, far back in  
your past? Say when you were 6.
in your mind you remember the tree in the backyard being gigantic.   
the corner lot with the thick trees was a forest.  and then when you  
go back it looks so different, so much smaller.  the tree isn't  
really that big and your forest was really just some scrub brush.   
even the loompia at the local filipino restaurant doesn't taste the  
same as your young childhood memories remember the sweet plum sauce  
just was more sweeter like liquid candy.  and you were so sure of  
things and spoke with conviction on how you felt, unvarnished.

it would be nice to feel that way again.

i don't know how other people manage to renew themselves, or feel  
that liberation that comes with innocence.  sometimes people buy  
stuff, toys for grown ups, hoping that it will satisfy.  others have  
children of their own so they can experience that newness again.  i  
mean i see what you're saying.

  people talk about the movie "groove" and i wonder is it really like  
that? (why am i here)  and if i have a good time at one place, like  
one good night, can it ever be repeated?  the euphoria is so intense  
there's a fear that no, it won't happen again and i will be  
disappointed.  and it's this fear of disappointment that separates  
this from children, who lack that cynicism and doubt.

i've been painting a lot lately, and they are childhood memories.   
impressions.  just the colors, and movement are the focus.  i  
remember so well the tastes, the smells, the magenta flowers, the  
blue green Gulf, blinding white sand, a calf sized tattoo of the  
Battle of Coral Sea and Doolittle's Raid, horn rimmed glasses, cigar  
smoke, aquamarine shag carpet, fire ants, inch worms, riding horses  
through a flooded field like the mt dew commercial, scorpions,  
mesquite trees, granite rock jettis

what are some of your memories?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Incredible light-emitting shirts

Those are amazing. Philips put together a book called Visions of the Future (http://www.design.philips.com/about/design/section-13482/index.html) back in 1995, and many of the ideas put forward there are coming into being today.

I'm generally pretty skeptical of consumer electronics company's visions for our future, but at least Philip's vision recognizes the place of human emotion and feeling, as well as celebrating innovative industrial design.

Peace,

i have now gotten a good night's sleep and am drinking a nice cup of coffee.

perhaps my words were a bit harsh, but i still feel extremely
dissappointed with last night's music and crowd.

of course, that's just my personal opinion.  there were plenty of
people that seemed to be having a good time.

reminder that i have a lot of love and respect for all of this.  just
not so much last night.

i have now gotten a good night's sleep and am drinking a nice cup of coffee.

perhaps my words were a bit harsh, but i still feel extremely
dissappointed with last night's music and crowd.

of course, that's just my personal opinion.  there were plenty of
people that seemed to be having a good time.

reminder that i have a lot of love and respect for all of this.  just
not so much last night.

I wasn't there but I'm guessing that it follows a certain pattern that
Get Freaky parties have gone for a while.  I may be speaking out of my
ass but I've talked to lots of friends that just won't go to their
parties cause their got tired of it.  The sound doesn't change much,
Lorin and Bassnectar always play, the talent isn't normally as
talented as they should be and there isn't much room made for anyone
new.

This party seem to show a much more diverse array of music than I've
seen them do in a while.  I was hoping that they might be changing
things but it sounds like it hasn't.

And a big segment burner crowd in the bay seems to have a habit with
the Get Freaky parties.  Old habits die hard.  They have been going
for so long now, how can they tell if it's bad.  Not to mention the
bar is not set that high on the playa so this may translate to putting
up with bad djs in the club.

My two cents.  Take it or leave it.

  Fair


Ya, it was bad.

I mean, last time I saw then good was at the Troc in like, '96 or so.  Down 
hill ever since.  Saw them at DNA open for KMFDM, also stinky.  Only thing 
I saw worse was Sheep on Drugs.  That was so bad they didn't bother to plug 
any of their gear in.  They were faking the whole show.

HOWEVER!!!

Genetortuers last thursday was pretty damn good!  Great sound, good stage 
set up, and Gen has an amazing voice live.

Trying to get the word out on behalf of faultline, templeSF... Almost 
made the trek to the city for this show, don't want anyone else to not 
see this!
"
*POSTPONED -- the LTJ Bukem & MC Conrad show has been pushed back to 
October 5th.* All other details remain the same. Apparently Temple had 
permit problems with the fire department.. it must be an enormous 
logistical undertaking to open a new nightclub, especially on their 
scale, so here's wishing them all the best getting that sorted out.

* Presale holders* -- as of 8:15pm Saturday, Still Doin' It has been 
told that your credit card will be refunded automatically on Monday. 
We'll continue to post updates on www.stilldoinit.com 
<http://www.stilldoinit.com/> as we receive notifications from Temple. 
Also watch www.templesf.com <http://www.templesf.com/> and their phone 
line, 415-978-9953 for further updates. Your business is much 
appreciated and we hope everyone will take the opportunity to purchase 
presales again for the postponed show as they become available. **

*ALSO -- JOE NICE will be playing tonight*, 1:00AM at the Abstract Rude 
show at 111 Minna Gallery. Peep www.111minnagallery.com 
<http://www.111minnagallery.com/> for deets or go straight to the flyer

OMG, I was having an amazing time at Opulent Temple (I belive it was. 
Whatever was at 2:00 & Esplanade) for sunrise, and then the DJ who 
followed SUCKED.  Pure and simple.  BUSTED the 1st mix (with a "what the 
fuck is going on" sort of look and nod to the previous DJ.  Then he 
BUSTED the 2nd mix.  Then I LEFT! :)  Shitty DJs suck. ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: get freaky?

ceratinly at the beginning of the night the music was
lacking, and i totally mised atomic hooligan's set...
though if he played after bassnectar, well, i have
problems with the energy in a room after bassnectar
plays. i really enjoyed glitch mob but that was
probably because i had a burst of energy, really
really really wanted to dance and that's where a
couple people i hadn't danced with in a while were
dancing.  i for one, had a lot of fun. but that's what
you guys pay me for, right?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: get freaky?

generally when bassnectar plays he draws a huge crowd
to the dancefloor. it's hot , sweaty, debaucherous....
quite a lovely dancefloor really, cept i can't get
into his music. soon as he's done playing the
dancefloor, and often the party itself, clear. in my
time here in sf promoting i've come across the
attitude many times that if basssnectar isn't playing,
it isn't worth going to. regardless of who else is on
the bill, if he's on it the focus is on him. i respect
the fact that he has such a devoted following, more
power to him. but frankly, i hate their attitude and
am always diappointed to see bassnectar on a line-up
and hope he never plays a party that i invest any
energy into, as i feel it would be wasted.

I highly recommend these Tom Moulton Mixes on Six Million Steps for all those old school disco heads:
 
<http://www.sixmillionsteps.com/mixes.htm>http://www.sixmillionsteps.com/mixes.htm
 
His remix of Patti Jo's "Make me believe in you" is quite moving. Some rare 12 inches plus interview with the Legend himself.  Also, mixes by friends Bill Brewster and Greg Wilson as well as hours and hours of downloadable mixes from the UK.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: get freaky?

Guess I'm not the only person who gets bored of seeing the people who throw 
parties play their own parties very single time.

I'm too used to DC...most crews rarely have more than one or two of their 
own DJ's on a lineup of a party they throw. It's normally used as a vehicle 
for gig swapping with other crews - I bring in your DJ's at my event, and 
vice versa.

Must be a foreign idea in these parts.

Hey there,

It's the official pre-playa t'rowdown, everyone! This one's gonna be hot hot
HOT, with Aaron Jae and Donna Matrix joining myself and Marc(O) on the
decks. The energy is insanely high around our bay and our community right
now, with less than a week until the big one gets underway. We're all busy
getting everything together, yes, but you KNOW you need to get out and see
everyone, hear some choice, premium, grade-A beats, burn off some of that
steam, shake your ass and embrace the energy. Milk it, y'all! It's the
official playa-vibe Crooked!

I'm going to Boston in the end of October. Can anyone recommend some cool shit to do? We'll be in New York for a (Wednesday) night as well. Looking for some good house music (wish I was going to Chicago). Any advice? Much appreciated.
   
  Thanks,
   
  Chuck

aired on radio stations such as Radio1, Kiss, Ministry, Groovetech and
stations across Europe and the US.

steady stream of releases on a number UK based breaks labels including
TCR, Botchit + Scarper, Forged, En:Vision, Secret Agent, Track,and his
own Record Records amongst others, earning him a reputation as a
master of well-crafted left-of-centre dancefloor tunes.

His remix work includes tracks for Forged, Botchit, Cup of Chi,
En:Vision, Passenger,and most recently as Roxiller on Sober,
Functional and Broke Records.

 I have too much WVO oil here, more than what I need. It is very high quality, though it is partially hydrogenated and solid. Please come and take it away. Give me a call at 707-342-3804.

In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...Blastoff! 

Mark your calendars (Saturday, October 14th from 10 PM to 5 AM) for the underground party of the fall in San Francisco. A fantastic space, great people, a dancefloor that will not stop, an incredible soundsystem, and sounds that will transform you into a supercharged mass of kinetic energy all night long! 

We have Chicago House Legend Roy Davis Jr of Large Records and Ubiquity Records, local sensation JT Donaldson of Om Records and Gallery Music, Homero Espinosa, Eric Sharp, and Ryan D. housing it up in the Soul Stompers room. Breaking it down in the Bass Invaders room will be Space Cowboys' dancefloor demolitionist Mancub along with Lachlan, Native Intelligence, and Mycho Cocoa. 

Call 415-412-0406 the night of for details. You'll be glad you did. :) 

See you on the dancefloor! 

The Rock It Science Crew

from what i understand, hydrogenated oil is a bitch to work with,  
since it tends to trap and hold moisture.

Biography: ALEX SMOKE

Alex Smoke is unique talent to emerge from the Glasgow music scene.
This young producer is pushing the boundaries of electronic music with
his innovative fusion of deep European minimalism with emotional
strings and intellegent electro rhythms. Alex has a classical music
background which reveals itself in the quality of his arrangements. In
the past two years the music world has witnessed his rapid ascent
through the ranks of the techno elite. Since the 2005 release of his
brilliant debut LP on Soma, 'Incommunicado' he has been booked to play
the clubs and festivals of the UK, Europe and beyond. His coveted
releases on Berlin label Vakant have cemented his club credentials and
found their way into boxes and laptops of innovative DJs everywhere.
Not content with a slew of killer twelves, Alex Smoke remixes have
constantly been in demand, recently renovating Mylo, Alex Under and
Vector Lovers. 2006 has shaped up to be another monumental one for
Alex Smoke with the release of his second LP, 'Paradolia' and
subsequent UK, European, and US live tours.

Biography: JUSTIN MARTIN

Justin Martin is one of the few house DJs that successfully bridges
the gap between being commercially successful and staying true to the
underground. His sound has been described as both melodic and tough,
with releases ranging from the dynamic "Cicada" on dirtybird to the
slamming "Magnificent" remix for Iz and Diz on OM records.  Justin
first gained international acclaim for his single, "The Sad Piano," on
Ben Watt's Buzzin'fly label. The single made its way into many A-List
DJ crates as well as receiving many accolades from critics. Over time,
Justin developed a more edgy sound in his hometown of San Francisco.
He helped develop the local dirtybird label with his good friend,
Claude VonStroke, releasing several amazing singles and remixes.
Justin considers himself lucky to be making music and is always a
humble, but rocking presence on the dance floor. Stay tuned for some
amazing collaborations with his brother Christian coming soon on
dirtybird as well as a mix compilation on the Om Winter Sessions
Series.

That is good, I'll have to go search for more tracks. Have you checked out
BT - This Binary Universe? Insanely good. Maybe Mikel and you can come over
some time soon and watch it in 5.1 with me. When are you free?

Subject: [sfraves] Recent re-transplant

Hey all,

Just wanted to drop a note, say hello, and introduce myself. I'm in  
the process of moving back to California and into San Fran  
specifically. I'm from the general area but have never lived in the  
city before and I have been living out of the state and/or country  
for the last 5 years or so. Currently stuck in the mountains a couple  
hours away until I find a job in the city but I'll be making frequent  
trips down there for that purpose. Was down last weekend looking for  
something to do and realized the limitations imposed by my lack of  
contacts (friends) in the city. Was quite active in the scene in S.  
Cali back in the late 90's (SoCalRaves, Stormriders, ROAM, etc.) and  
am always interested in knowing what's going on with the EDM scene in  
my area.

Any information on good websites listing events and such would be  
greatly appreciated. Ravelinks seemed pretty sparse this last weekend  
or was there really that little going on?

Also, if anyone knows of job opportunities for a technical project  
manager, please let me know. Resume: http://resumes.hotjobs.com/ 
singinius/exptechpm

Ciao!

Nate

Plenty of tech jobs in the South Bay if you are willing to live that far
from the city. Just look at Craigslist.

Which mountains? I lived up in the Santa Cruz mountains for six years.  I miss it from time to time.  Like today.

Welcome to the city!  Anoter vote for Craigslist.  There actually are quite a few PM jobs right now, I was just looking last night.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] Recent re-transplant

Hey all,

Just wanted to drop a note, say hello, and introduce myself. I'm in  
the process of moving back to California and into San Fran  
specifically. I'm from the general area but have never lived in the  
city before and I have been living out of the state and/or country  
for the last 5 years or so. Currently stuck in the mountains a couple  
hours away until I find a job in the city but I'll be making frequent  
trips down there for that purpose. Was down last weekend looking for  
something to do and realized the limitations imposed by my lack of  
contacts (friends) in the city. Was quite active in the scene in S.  
Cali back in the late 90's (SoCalRaves, Stormriders, ROAM, etc.) and  
am always interested in knowing what's going on with the EDM scene in  
my area.

Any information on good websites listing events and such would be  
greatly appreciated. Ravelinks seemed pretty sparse this last weekend  
or was there really that little going on?

Also, if anyone knows of job opportunities for a technical project  
manager, please let me know. Resume: http://resumes.hotjobs.com/ 
singinius/exptechpm

Ciao!

Nate

Heh, the Santa Cruz ones would be a fair amount closer. I'm in the  
foothills of the sierras, about 2500 foot level. Nice place to visit,  
but no way in hell I could live here, talk about technological black  
hole... I have no idea how i survived high school up here.

Thanks for the recommendations for craigslist, I am looking there.  
However, I also know the statistics say I am much better off spending  
most of my time networking and using my contacts as opposed to  
endlessly browsing the job listings. Have to cover all the bases... :)

Regards,
Nathan

To respond to your question regarding websites that list events,
etc.... here are a few to get you going:

(these list mostly CLUB events, by the way, and most are 21+. To find
"real" raves I'd suggest Bayraves.com or staying tuned to this list.)


SFStation
http://sfstation.com/clubs/

Nitevibe
http://www.nitevibe.com/

Flavorpill
http://beta.sf.flavorpill.net/

Nitewise
http://www.nitewise.com/

SF Techno group on Upcoming.org
http://upcoming.org/group/780/


Can anyone think of any more you'd normally consult to find stuff
that's going on?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Recent re-transplant

I'd say for "rave" events, better than BayRaves (which is practically all 
candE kiddiEs), try:

tribe.net

MySpace

groundscore.net/board (breaks & drumNbass - but there's some other stuff 
posted from time to time too)

There are a TON of groups on MySpace & Tribe.net that cater specifically to 
the Bay Area and non-club events, as well as club stuff...

do a search forr my email addy: dj_marco138@hotmail.com on MySpace and send 
me an add request

or on Tribe, search under this address (electrofunk138@hotmail.com) for me.

I'll impart what info I can on ya....

HAHA, well just goes to show you can't believe everything you read!

www.myspace.com/singinius is me on myspace. Anna is/was my girlfriend/=20=

ex-girlfriend, she has been living in Paris for the past two years. =20
That is somewhat of a complicated situation much better explained in =20
person, over drinks. I opened a myspace account for her back when i =20
opened mine but she never used it so i deleted the photos from it and =20=

just left it there in case she wanted it. I think you'll see it =20
listed in my friends list.

Pics of her are here, www.flickr.com/photos/singinius/sets/ in the =20
set titled Anna.

So, the explanation does not match with your first hypothesis, so =20
therefore I guess it falls into your "i don't know" category. And =20
trust me, the reality is much more interesting than some lame guy =20
trolling for photos of girls. :)

I had meant to post my myspace link in my first post but completely =20
forgot. Anything anyone wants to search about me will be found by =20
searching either singinius, the name I have used online for the past =20
12 years or so, or just my name Nathan DuCray, nothing to hide. :) =20
And honestly, the myspace profile is a pretty accurate summary, but I =20=

am certainly better in person, I have never been good at defining =20
myself online in little text boxes.

Adriana, you get an A for effort, but an F for your hypothesis. :P =20
However, you are right, I am bored, so you are more than welcome to =20
send me pics! >:)

Ciao,
Nate

http://www.myspace.com/singinius
http://singinius.deviantart.com/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/singinius/
http://singinius.livejournal.com/
etc, etc, etc...



No problem in calling me out, i have nothing to hide.

www.myspace.com/singinius is me on myspace. Anna is/was my girlfriend/ex-girlfriend, she has been living in Paris for the past two years. That is somewhat of a complicated situation much better explained in person, over drinks. I opened a myspace account for her back when i opened mine but she never used it so i deleted the photos from it and just left it there in case she wanted it. I think you'll see it listed in my friends list.
 
Pics of her are here, www.flickr.com/photos/singinius/sets/ in the set titled Anna.


So, the explanation does not match with your first hypothesis, so therefore I guess it falls into your "i don't know" category. And trust me, the reality is much more interesting than some lame guy trolling for photos of girls. :)


I had meant to post my myspace link in my first post but completely forgot. Anything anyone wants to search about me will be found by searching either singinius, the name I have used online for the past 12 years or so, or just my name Nathan DuCray, nothing to hide. :) And honestly, the myspace profile is a pretty accurate summary, but I am certainly better in person, I have never been good at defining myself online in little text boxes.


Adriana, you get an A for effort, but an F for your hypothesis. :P However, you are right, I am bored, so you are more than welcome to send me pics! >:)


Ciao,
Nate

I appreciate all the info!

Wasn't there a group up here called Stargaze or something like this?  
Are they still around? I have some friends in LA who went to some of  
their events.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Top 3 BM 2006 DJ's

Gotta love puttin out a subject like that.. Obvious IMHO - although I am a 
professional :)

There were three good DJ's at BM this year I thought that stood above the 
rest by a long way..

No really.. it's true!

1. DJ Adnan
2. Justin Martin
3. eDit (and the Glitch Mod Crew - okay so that 3 more)

Thursday night at around 9:30 & Esplanade (Gravity Point Camp) was this 
incredible enclave.. more like drippy funky ass, hard hitting cave of techno 
indulgence that left the dust on your skin turned to mud from the sweaty 
intoxicating beats that pulled me back in three times, only to leave for an 
under construction dome next door to hear more while getting laid on base 
bins.. damn I love BM.

These guys ripped the f&% out of the playa leaving nothing but groundscore.. 
now why are they on a house label when they hit it like that?? Dark freaky 
funky glitch and techno fused into an amalgamation of hard hitting breaks, 
sometimes with a jazzy riff, or trip-hop, or tribal changeup that left you 
breathless and gasping for air.  I was dancing on air at one point.. the 
beats lifting me ever higher until I was just on my tippie toes.. faining 
minimal gestures in the lightness of being the beats evoked.  Maybe it was 
the K.. I dunno.. but it was hot hot hot.. and I want me sa-mo!!!

Searching for more parties with these kids from SF where they shed their 
housy label and straight rip up the set with their OTHER records :)  Anyone 
got the word?

That is good, I'll have to go search for more tracks. Have you checked out
BT - This Binary Universe? Insanely good. Maybe Mikel and you can come over
some time soon and watch it in 5.1 with me. When are you free?

The Gravity Point peeps were very cool. Some are from SF, others from San
Diego & Portland. I'll pass the word along to the ones I know. :)

And yes, Adnan is right at the top. Didn't catch Justin or eDit, but yes, in
full agreement that they rock.

play.  Why even come.. money grubbing bastards.. oh ya I forgot.. it's only

play.  Why even come.. money grubbing bastards.. oh ya I forgot.. it's only
about the $$$.. doh!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF LoveFest 2006 - DJ Line Up

Speaking of Spundae...

I was driving home from Marin the other day and saw a Lexus SUV with the plate LUVEDM or something close to that.

There was a "gold" plate frame that said something about Spundae.  I didn't get a good look at the driver but the passenger was a very attractive blonde woman.

Not sure why this is important, but there you have it.

Peace,

Peter

Careful now, you're opening up a can of worms! :) One I have no  
problem discussing, of course, but this whole general topic (the  
women in my life) is much more easily explained/discussed/debated in  
person. It is a subject close to my heart and therefore I like to do  
it the proper justice it deserves. I am sure once I start meeting  
folks around here that this will all come out in conversation anyways.

Oh, yeah, i am singinius on AIM, yahoo, ICQ and MSN as well... See ya!

Statistically, I've found more housing and jobs through Craigslist 
than anywhere else.

Agreed!

I have worked for both Peter and Lisa Marie over the years and they are both 
amazing people.  I actually used to work out of their house in Novato for a 
time. When they lived with Skippy from UV99.

I love the Spundae cats and have never once felt that I didn't get my 
money's worth at one of their shows.

Unfortuanatly I won't be attending Afterparty because I will be at Symbiosis 
Gathering but I have a feeling I might make it to the Spundae / Skills party 
for New Years!

Such as your reply... Parties COST MONEY PEOPLE. DJ's, the ones you all cry 
about seeing, CHARGE REAL MONEY, not PLUR play money. And I guarantee 
electrofunk138@hotmail.com doesn't know Peter or Skills....

Fuck I'm getting sick of this list already, and its only been a couple 
months...

Anyone who thinks that Skills and Spundae are not
doing parties for the money is retarded. And a step
further, Skills is doing it for the money and to see
their names on the flyers.

This does not mean that the people you know are bad
people. It just means that they do it for the money.
PERIOD.

There's a big difference from doing something to make money and being in it "only" for the money.

I go to work to earn money.  If they didn't pay me I wouldn't show up.  But to say I'm "only" in it for the money wouldn't be right either.  I'm in it to pay the rent, feed my kids, have medicla insurance, buy records, etc.

On the other hand, there's a certain feeling that's obviously present when promoters primary interests are their wallets.  And then there are the extreme greed cases where advertised headliners are never booked, DJs and sound people aren't paid, and so forth.  I've certainly heard stories about this sort of behavior from some promoters but not Spundae or Skills.  I've actually witnessed it happen at one event.  (No I won't name names, but it was a large party in Miami.)

Which isn't the same thing as saying I love either crew's parties.  I've never been to a Skills party so I have no opinion, but I've been to some good and some bad Spundae events.

FWIW

Regards,

Peter

Dude, you are getting tense;  I thought that's what I just said.  

I've never heard of Spundae burning anyone.  I don' have any idea what goes on inside the prometer's head.  The event I was mentioning in Miami wasn't a Spundae event.

And like I said I've been to some good Spundae parties and some bad ones.  Its hard to say whether to blame the bad ones on the promoters, the club owner, or simply just the crowd that this combination happened to attract.  Sometimes good people throw bad parties. Sometimes bad people show up at good parties.  Etc.

Peace,

Peter

Wow, did your pink biker crank just hit you. Sorry to
make you stop doing the Nordic Track while on the jock
of your LA party friends long enough to post some
hater-ade here on the hippy list...

Who cares who they book, yes they get paid, yes they
should get paid, yes they do it for the money.

Yeahhhhhhh, we solved world hunger.

I don't mind paying for a good event, but please don't call it "free", that's just lame and bogus.   Also, last year after I gladly paid my "donation" for my wife and myself, and after the gate person grumbled at me not paying for my two kids in their strollers,  I'm 99% sure she just pocketed the $20. That is, I actually saw her put it into her pocket. This did not make me happy, but I dceide not to have a big hassle over it.

But I'll be there again this year and I hope nothing like that will happen again.  If it does, I'll have to think twice about future Lovefest events.

Peace,

Peter

Funny, just two seconds ago,

I just got an email from the LOVEFEST mailing list. In particular, I 
love this doublespeak:

".... though the main gate will be at Fulton in the UN plaza.  Please be 
prepared to make a $10 donation.  Support from the community for this 
massive free party is essential to the survival of the event! "

Love the spin!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF LoveFest 2006 - DJ Line Up

I think everyone missed my point.. almost none of the spundae or skills DJs 
that are headlining will ever play for free at the LoveFest parade.  They 
bring them in only to capitalize on the captive audience that didn't get 
enough of what was put on the event flyer.  They are in the lineup.. but 
they won't be at the event.  You will only get top see THEM if you pay!  
Now.. why??  Why can't THEY put down a freakin half hour or hour long set 
since we already paid them to come to the city and play a few hours later.. 
or at least some of them play. Why?

Busy schedules  afuckingside, I will whip out my ass for a "figurative" 
public spanking and eat all my criticism of the $ grubbing scene if 
Aphrodite spins one freakin track in public, or if Donald Glaude.. who I 
don't even like anymore since I saw him in a santa suit for a Christmas 
rave.. dunno.. just killed it.. spins on a float.  I bet Christopher 
Lawrence only plays for money.. and oh yes.. Oakenfold.. you will only see 
him in time for his set.. but he gets privilege as superstar DJ - not!

This whole thing started for me last year when that cocksuck Paul Van Dyke 
decided not to play because the event was asking for $5 donations.. so he 
didn't play the event.. but he sure as hell collected his cash and played 
the afterparty.  The AFTERPARTY is ruining the event by supplicating the 
talent to a pay for service model using the event as it's free ride.

It just bugs me.. my $.02

LoveFest does rule and should be supported no matter what the afterparty is 
about.. they have nothing in common.

There's a big difference from doing something to make money and being in it 
"only" for the money.

I go to work to earn money.  If they didn't pay me I wouldn't show up.  But 
to say I'm "only" in it for the money wouldn't be right either.  I'm in it 
to pay the rent, feed my kids, have medicla insurance, buy records, etc.

On the other hand, there's a certain feeling that's obviously present when 
promoters primary interests are their wallets.  And then there are the 
extreme greed cases where advertised headliners are never booked, DJs and 
sound people aren't paid, and so forth.  I've certainly heard stories about 
this sort of behavior from some promoters but not Spundae or Skills.  I've 
actually witnessed it happen at one event.  (No I won't name names, but it 
was a large party in Miami.)

Which isn't the same thing as saying I love either crew's parties.  I've 
never been to a Skills party so I have no opinion, but I've been to some 
good and some bad Spundae events.

FWIW

Peter

Or in short....

The event (love fest) is simply a way to promote the
Money-Making afterparty. Disguise your good deeds as
donations, charge a butt-load for the afterparty.

To me its the worst kind of fakeness... the wanna-be
hippy turned capitalist. Hey brother....

Ranger... you a smart cookie.

Back in 2001 when I was at WMC we stayed at this cheap place by the beach called the Barbazon.  Pretty good deal, but not at all swanky. Its right across from the beach and the rooms have little kitchenettes.  Anyway, I was actually speaking at the conference that day (I was the least hung over person on the panel) and when I returned to the hotel Glaude was spinning in the lobby.  There were like 3 people there including me.  And it was free.  FWIW.

But I agree the expensive after party thing isn't where I'm at these days.  Not only because its sort of silly and lame, but also because I just spent $1500 on repairing my fricking car today.  Free/cheap is the way for me!

Peace,

Peter

I think everyone missed my point.. almost none of the spundae or skills DJs 
that are headlining will ever play for free at the LoveFest parade.  They 
bring them in only to capitalize on the captive audience that didn't get 
enough of what was put on the event flyer.  They are in the lineup.. but 
they won't be at the event.  You will only get top see THEM if you pay!  
Now.. why??  Why can't THEY put down a freakin half hour or hour long set 
since we already paid them to come to the city and play a few hours later.. 
or at least some of them play. Why?

Busy schedules  afuckingside, I will whip out my ass for a "figurative" 
public spanking and eat all my criticism of the $ grubbing scene if 
Aphrodite spins one freakin track in public, or if Donald Glaude.. who I 
don't even like anymore since I saw him in a santa suit for a Christmas 
rave.. dunno.. just killed it.. spins on a float.  I bet Christopher 
Lawrence only plays for money.. and oh yes.. Oakenfold.. you will only see 
him in time for his set.. but he gets privilege as superstar DJ - not!

This whole thing started for me last year when that cocksuck Paul Van Dyke 
decided not to play because the event was asking for $5 donations.. so he 
didn't play the event.. but he sure as hell collected his cash and played 
the afterparty.  The AFTERPARTY is ruining the event by supplicating the 
talent to a pay for service model using the event as it's free ride.

It just bugs me.. my $.02

LoveFest does rule and should be supported no matter what the afterparty is 
about.. they have nothing in common.

There's a big difference from doing something to make money and being in it 
"only" for the money.

I go to work to earn money.  If they didn't pay me I wouldn't show up.  But 
to say I'm "only" in it for the money wouldn't be right either.  I'm in it 
to pay the rent, feed my kids, have medicla insurance, buy records, etc.

On the other hand, there's a certain feeling that's obviously present when 
promoters primary interests are their wallets.  And then there are the 
extreme greed cases where advertised headliners are never booked, DJs and 
sound people aren't paid, and so forth.  I've certainly heard stories about 
this sort of behavior from some promoters but not Spundae or Skills.  I've 
actually witnessed it happen at one event.  (No I won't name names, but it 
was a large party in Miami.)

Which isn't the same thing as saying I love either crew's parties.  I've 
never been to a Skills party so I have no opinion, but I've been to some 
good and some bad Spundae events.

FWIW

Regards,

Peter

Funny, just two seconds ago,

I just got an email from the LOVEFEST mailing list. In particular, I 
love this doublespeak:

".... though the main gate will be at Fulton in the UN plaza.  Please be 
prepared to make a $10 donation.  Support from the community for this 
massive free party is essential to the survival of the event! "

Love the spin!

#1 and #2 are infinitely debatable- but as you mature you realize  
that even the most commercialized presence around is in fact in it  
for the better reasons-
Otherwise they wouldn't have had the heart to take things to where  
they're at.

Respect to all the good DJs of the world, defined solely by me.

man, those were a lot of emails.

1)  ranger:  pvd didn't spin at THE afterparty.  he only spun at 1015
which was the PAM DJs afterparty.  PAM being a artist management group
that also was schedule to have a float in the parade that was supposed
to have PVD along with the other PAM DJs play.  that didn't happen, we
all heard about the drama, etc.

2)  the parade and the afterparty are two different events.  the
official afterparty is Spundae and Skills.  the parade is not.  there
are many people organizing the parade that are not in any way
affiliated with the official afterparty.  for example, both John Wood
of Somarts and Syd Gris of Opel are on the parade committee.  both are
also involved with the Love Infusion afterparty (with Tantra, Evil
Breaks and the Ambient Mafia) which is also in no way affiliated with
the official afterparty.

3)  on the page referenced in the original message:
http://www2.sflovefest.org/dj_line_up.php
it clearly says below that "Note: Not all artists appearing in
parade."  so there you have it.

4)  i think the donation wording thing is wack too.  but you pay to go
to Pride, pay to go to Castro on Halloween and pay for gas and parking
to go to Sunset at Lake Novato.  what else is new here?  hey, my crew
is paying $1500 for our float entry, a couple hundred to rent our
float, several hundred to decorate it and hours and hours of man
power.  shit, i wish i only had to pay $10 to come out and enjoy the
day!

and with that, i hope to see a bunch of you out there.  i'll be the DJ
about 30 feet in the air.  don't believe me?  come on out and see.

At first I read that last bit as "I'll be the DJ with his feet in the air!"

LOL

Thanks for the clarifications Bam.  I'm still a bit grumpy about the gate people pocketing the money though.  I don't mind supporting the event, I do mind supporting thieves.  

Hopefully someone can pass that on to the parade organizers.

Peter

P.S. I'm planning to go to the Somarts party and/or maybe some of the other underground afterparties myself.  I didn't see anyting that excited me enough to pay the big bucks to go to the Skills/Spundae event.  Yes I am that jaded.

P.P.S. What's the full roster of after parties? We need to have that list posted here.  Remembering making sfraves relevant...

Subject: [sfraves] Christian DJ's? aka Glowsticks for God

Hey kids!

Not sure who is still out there, but I am alive. It's Smurf for those 
from the old days. Anyway, I'm tired as all get out, living the cowgirl 
life ain't easy. Ha! Didn't see that comin, did ya? So I'll get right to 
the point. I have this crazy idea to throw a party for the teens at my 
church. So what I'm looking for are some west coast DJ's. Don't really 
need to play "christian" music but can't have negative beats either. Any 
positive, uplifting, and spiritual music would be appreciated. We're in 
Central Oregon, Prineville to be exact. Of course would could pay travel 
expenses, but donated time would be appreciated. Anyone knowing of 
Oregon DJs with their eys on the Lord would be better. I'm just trying 
to throw some ideas together. For all I know the church may be willing 
to throw some real money at this but I need to know what we can do.

Peas!

Time to whip out the gospel house collections guys!

FWIW I'm a practicing Buddhist DJ, does that count?

And what exactly constitutes a "negative beat" in your definition? 

 This should draw some fun comments from the peanut gallery.

Peace,

Hi Smurf :-)  There's lots of good gospel house out there.  The kind that gets folks to throw their hands in the air.

Much love,

Book Paul Johnson wooo!  Or any other South Side Chicago DJ lol.  Gospel
house wooo!  Seriously I bet if you search Myspace you can find some more
local people that play it.  Most of the lyrics are about God, Jesus, the
spirit, preacher man, etc.

Not exactly but if you're down to help create a positive, fun evening 
for some good kids then you're welcome to be a part of the project.

My main concern is avoiding vocal samples that are sexual, violent, etc. 
Other than that, if you have terror core that falls in that category 
than right on! Come one, come all, bring us your tech-step, your goa, 
your NRG.

Eh, not too worried about the comments of reactionary types. I was 
around this list long enough back in the day to know what I'm getting 
into. Just figured there had to be some DJs out there who shared my 
faith and might be interested in helping, and like a salmon coming back 
to a river to spawn I thought I'd start here.

Damn man I don't know what you are talking about. I mean yea PVD and his 
whole float broke off but they weren't even playing at the Skills / Spundae 
party last year. That was 1015's Show.

I actually saw some great acts on their (skills / spundae) float including 
but not limited to CARL COX.  I know for a fact that guy charges big bucks 
and he fucking threw it down at the parade. Who esle played on their float 
last year I think Bad Boy Bill, and some other big djs (sorry i was trashed 
so my memory is spotty at best), but I can't forget Carl Cox's set.  It was 
just what I needed Big Funky Techno. Amazing!

At first I read that last bit as "I'll be the DJ with his feet in the air!"

LOL

Thanks for the clarifications Bam.  I'm still a bit grumpy about the gate 
people pocketing the money though.  I don't mind supporting the event, I do 
mind supporting thieves.

Hopefully someone can pass that on to the parade organizers.

Peter

P.S. I'm planning to go to the Somarts party and/or maybe some of the other 
underground afterparties myself.  I didn't see anyting that excited me 
enough to pay the big bucks to go to the Skills/Spundae event.  Yes I am 
that jaded.

P.P.S. What's the full roster of after parties? We need to have that list 
posted here.  Remembering making sfraves relevant...

Subject: [sfraves] regarding lovefest

man, those were a lot of emails.

1)  ranger:  pvd didn't spin at THE afterparty.  he only spun at 1015
which was the PAM DJs afterparty.  PAM being a artist management group
that also was schedule to have a float in the parade that was supposed
to have PVD along with the other PAM DJs play.  that didn't happen, we
all heard about the drama, etc.

2)  the parade and the afterparty are two different events.  the
official afterparty is Spundae and Skills.  the parade is not.  there
are many people organizing the parade that are not in any way
affiliated with the official afterparty.  for example, both John Wood
of Somarts and Syd Gris of Opel are on the parade committee.  both are
also involved with the Love Infusion afterparty (with Tantra, Evil
Breaks and the Ambient Mafia) which is also in no way affiliated with
the official afterparty.

3)  on the page referenced in the original message:
http://www2.sflovefest.org/dj_line_up.php
it clearly says below that "Note: Not all artists appearing in
parade."  so there you have it.

4)  i think the donation wording thing is wack too.  but you pay to go
to Pride, pay to go to Castro on Halloween and pay for gas and parking
to go to Sunset at Lake Novato.  what else is new here?  hey, my crew
is paying $1500 for our float entry, a couple hundred to rent our
float, several hundred to decorate it and hours and hours of man
power.  shit, i wish i only had to pay $10 to come out and enjoy the
day!

and with that, i hope to see a bunch of you out there.  i'll be the DJ
about 30 feet in the air.  don't believe me?  come on out and see.

Thats' fucked up.

See, I was one of the guys in black shirts on security detail.  I was on 
Gate 7, 8, 9 doing the money drops.  We had guys on the gates as well.  We 
wern't there just for the crowd, we were watching everything.  However with 
our crew of 150 and over 100,000 attendee's all day, we couldn't see 
everything.

My advice to everyone when you go to something like Love Parade...  if you 
see some staffer who's suppose dto be doing gate collection pocket money, 
let the security guys know.  If one blows you off, tell another.  They're 
not all perfect, but 9/10th of the guys are serious about what they do and 
it will be dealt with.  You may not see it, but it will happen.  If we have 
a heads up then we can catch the person doing it and then take them to the 
promoter and let them ask why they are pocketing money at the gate.

That really pisses me off.

Also, from the security side, all day and all night we only had one arrest 
we had to deal with.  Quite a few medical issues though, mainly from people 
going all day in the sun and forgeting to properly hydrate 
themselves.  Rememeber, BEER is not water!  Drink your water, lots of it.

The Glass is half empty I see...

How about a Half Full approch..

You throw and all day party in which people can choose to support or not 
support, and enjoy either way.  You go all day and into the night.

Then!

You throw a high price event at night for the dumbasses that will actually 
pay it, and in return, cover the costs for the free daytime event all your 
friends got to have a blast at.

Don't know if this was the case...  but it's what I would do, and have 
done, and will do.  You do something that pulls in money, and you do it for 
money, so that you can have the capital to pay for fun events for your 
friends and such and not worry about going bankrupt.  Anything really wrong 
with that?

I mean, isn't that what all the Burning Man "fund raisers" and compression 
parties are all about anyway?

Own it.  I also have many other tracks that are about enlightenment "God" and so forth.  But I also have some about sex and drugs.  Does that make me bad?

"Good kids" generally do't go to raves ya know?  I guess this means they don't do drugs (fine) and they don't have sex, or rather they don't admit to having sex.  I'm skeptical, but OK, I'm open minded.  You realize that Buddhists don't believe in a personal God right?  We're practically Satanists.  Or so I was told by the Jehovah's witnesses that came to my house a few weeks back.  Buddhists do pray sort of, but not to "God".

Actually for the record, I'm a tantric Buddhist which means that I believe in using delusion, attachment, and other so called "negative" energies as tools of enlightenment.  That includes sexual energy, anger, violence, or whatever there is.   We work with what we've got and bring it onto the path.

See I thought you were talking about beats that were 180 degrees out of phase thereby destructively cancelling out the regular "positive beats".  ;)

I don't see sex as a negative thing at all.  I think its interesting that you lump sexual lyrics in with violent lyrics.  See my comments about tantra above.  Last time I checked Christians did actually have sex, or else there wouldn't be too many of them around.  My wife's friend who is a practicing Catholic has seven kids.  I don't think the stork brought them, do you?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SF LoveFest 2006 - DJ Line Up

For the record, the person that pocketed the money was a woman.  But I certainly wouldn't recongize her.  It all happened in 30 seconds and the only reason I even caught her was that I turned around to give her an evil glare bc of the attitude she gave us over not paying for the kids.  There were a lot of people streaming into the civic center at the time and it would have been difficult/impossible to reverse and go against the flow with two strollers.

Also, I don't think you should have to pay for kids.  Is there some policy about that?  Parade organizers?  Staffers?  Maybe she was just pissed bc she got to pocket less cash.

I'll be there with my daughter aged 11, and my two smallest sons aged 1.5 and 3.5.  The kids don't last too long in the sun with loud music so if I have to pay for all of them, I'll probably just not go to that part of the event.  Or I'll have to take them home and come back.  That's annoying at least.

Thanks,

Peter

Thats' fucked up.

See, I was one of the guys in black shirts on security detail.  I was on 
Gate 7, 8, 9 doing the money drops.  We had guys on the gates as well.  We 
wern't there just for the crowd, we were watching everything.  However with 
our crew of 150 and over 100,000 attendee's all day, we couldn't see 
everything.

My advice to everyone when you go to something like Love Parade...  if you 
see some staffer who's suppose dto be doing gate collection pocket money, 
let the security guys know.  If one blows you off, tell another.  They're 
not all perfect, but 9/10th of the guys are serious about what they do and 
it will be dealt with.  You may not see it, but it will happen.  If we have 
a heads up then we can catch the person doing it and then take them to the 
promoter and let them ask why they are pocketing money at the gate.

That really pisses me off.

Also, from the security side, all day and all night we only had one arrest 
we had to deal with.  Quite a few medical issues though, mainly from people 
going all day in the sun and forgeting to properly hydrate 
themselves.  Rememeber, BEER is not water!  Drink your water, lots of it.

The peopel who worked the gate were stationed at the gates most of the day.

Donation is just that, a DONATION.  It is neither required nor demanded, 
however it can be begged.  ;)

Not sure if I'll be there in official or recreational capacity.  I'm DJing 
a Folsom Eve party Saturday night.

Thats is going to be a CRAZY weekend...  Love Fest on Sat and Folsom Street

Ferry Corsten was sick as hell on that float.. and you are right.. Spundae 
and Grieves deserve mad respect for their contribitions to the event.  Damn 
Corsten rocked the set and Cox is one of my personal favorites, so yes.. I 
was way stoked they were out in front headlining.

It was the whole PVD thing that set me back.. I know it was the 1015 party 
and not skills.. but don't make me dig up the skills flyer for that party.. 
hardly any of the headliners were playing out front.  I know they aren't 
related.. I am over it.. I think the point is clear.  Don't presume just 
because one rides the tails of the other that they owe anything, or that it 
should be free.

Hey I love paying for my music.. I do.. I do it all the time.. ya ya.. I do 
it all the time.. yes i do.. ;)

I will be on the Opel Float this year.. Syd Gris is one man who always 
brings it to the people.. and I will be riding that parade for as long as 
possible.. see ya at the Opod!

Damn man I don't know what you are talking about. I mean yea PVD and his 
whole float broke off but they weren't even playing at the Skills / Spundae 
party last year. That was 1015's Show.

I actually saw some great acts on their (skills / spundae) float including 
but not limited to CARL COX.  I know for a fact that guy charges big bucks 
and he fucking threw it down at the parade. Who esle played on their float 
last year I think Bad Boy Bill, and some other big djs (sorry i was trashed 
so my memory is spotty at best), but I can't forget Carl Cox's set.  It was 
just what I needed Big Funky Techno. Amazing!

Never said it did, just said I was trying to stay away from the for this 
particular event. There's similar stuff in my crate too.

According to the media they do. That's all the good kids turned lying 
drug addicts by evil "rave parties," according to Diane Sawyer. Excuse 
the sarcasm the media drives me nuts but I said party, wasn't calling it 
a rave. And why can't good kids have a safe and positive night with 
their friends?

Everyone stumbles in their walk with the Lord. The important part is to 
get back up. Not perfect just forgiven. We try to encourage our youth to 
wait until marriage but no one is going to love them any less if they 
don't.

My Magic, Witchcraft and Religion anthropology class was a while back 
but yes I'm fairly familiar with Buddhist beliefs and ideals. I would 
never call you a satanist, nor do I go door to door pushing my faith. If 
you're curious I'll speak to you about my faith (understanding is key) 
and yes I've ministered to friends and need, but door to door faith 
ain't my style.

Problem is that all I wanted was some referals and you want to turn this 
into some religious debate and I'm really not interested. If you want 
some "christians" to argue with I'm sure there are plenty outside your 
local abortion clinic, just look for their signs and listening for their 
yelling.

Not much different than my faith. Suffering isn't such a bad thing, to 
experience pain is to know what Jesus went through. I pray when things 
are good and when they're bad. It's all a part of life.

No that would be bad.

I wasn't lumping anything, I was making a list of that which I did not 
want at the event. And you're right, we do have sex but only through a 
hole in the sheet.

Yep, to fish.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Christian DJ's? aka Glowsticks for God

The person known to most folks as Jesus Christ would never judge ANYONE 
based on what they listened to, danced to, what drugs they ate, or any other 
superficial factor. He would base his judgements upon the character of their 
soul.

To deny people these things, or deny letting them decide for themseleves 
whether or not they want that sort of content in their lives (or music), is, 
well...not very Jesus like.

WWJD? He'd laugh at the vast majority of Christians making decisions "in his 
name".

PLUR!

On my mission to avoid depression I have gotten into RC cars since I'm
currently taking a break from music until my album is released. I got a hi
end electric and damn this thing is insane. ~45 mph, goes so fast that the
only place big enough to drive it is on my street. My apartment complex
backyard is paved and about 50 sq yards in size, but even that isn't really
big enough. I never knew how fast these things had gotten. Also, building it
was harder then putting a turbo on my prelude. You really have to study this
stuff in order to do it right.

The car is a Tamiya Evolution 5. Fun shit.

funny you should ask - i just bought some stuff to make an indoor RC  
blimp to fly around the office.  i'm not so much into the cars,  
though when i get a bus, i'd like to rig it so that it's remotely- 
driveable.

wouldn't that be some shit - a 40-foot long RC bus on the playa...  :-)

I don't watch TV very much.  and  certainly don't pay much attention to what they have to say about raves.  We're in agrement here I think.

The difference in our points of view is that I don't believe that having sex outside of marriage is "stumbling" at all.  I'd argue that it can be great, magical, and yes even enlightening.  FWIW I'm married.

As I said above, I am actually curious about how you combine Christian faith with raving.  I see exactly how to combine it with my beliefs.  I'mcurious what you think about this recent posting on Boing Boing: http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/12/seattles_hipster_chu.html  

As far as the door-to-door types, not everyone that doesn't agree with you is <EVIL>  I think Jesus might have actually pointed that out. Remember the two thieves?  Sometimes I wonder if many of the people that call themselves Christian have actually even read this book.

>Problem is that all I wanted was some referals and you want to turn this 
>into some religious debate and I'm really not interested. If you want 

No. I want to undertand what you are trying to accomplish and what you are thinking here.  I would never argue against anyone else's faith even if I don't agree with all aspects of it.  That's actually one of the Buddha's teachings FWIW.  But I would argue against small mindedness, stupidity, and bigotry which I see from many professed Christians including the ladies that knocked on my door two weeks ago.

See I didn't say "suffering", I said energy.  Last time I had sex there wasn't any suffering involved.  

Although the Folsom Street Fair is coming up, so who can say.  Sometimes a little pain is GOOD.

Hmm, I'll have to try this hole in the sheet idea.  Kinky!

You mean the Vesica Pisces?  Anyhow, fish sex is still sex in my book. Just wetter.

Subject: [sfraves] What'd I miss?

Hello,

I just got back at 4 this morning from an excellent vacation to Santa
Fe, western Colorado, and Moab.  Those places are simply
awe-inspiring.  Canyonlands Nat'l Park in particular was incredible;
the place is so big that human perspective can't quite make sense of
it, like looking into a lithograph by M.C. Escher, except that it's
real, and right in front of you.  And the stillness of the desert is
incomparable to anything else.

So, anything good going on this Thursday or Friday night?  Where's
Osby gonna be?

Philip

heheheh Christian House.  I remember back in 98 or so, my buddy picked up a
CD called in the House of God.  Thinking it was just some collection of
House tracks.  It was Christian house.  Some of the beats were fucking sick,
but there would be this gospel, god like singing on top of it.  It was
hillarios as shit, specially driving up to Seattle for a party when he first
got it, and we were doing lines of meth on the way up and he's all hey i got
this new CD lets listen to it......Oh My God....that shit was hialrious.


So remember kids, the northwest is only good for Meth and when you thing
yours in the House of God you're really in God's house and even God needs a
little more cowbell once in a while.

Another FWIW comment... I know Donald a little and he's a pretty damn  
cool guy. I would not be surprised to see him on a float, but then

obligated to play for free.

Thank you so much Adriana we had a great time.  Some great tracks last nigh=
t, tho it was Syd Gris that dropped my favorites of the night. =20

It was good to meet some new people and visit some old friends...those big =
ass speakers.  I love them.

The last time I saw those speakers was at one of the last few parties at To=
wnsend before it closed.  We were there with a friend and his wife (then fi=
ancee) and it was his first time at a party (ahem)=20

Anyway, about an hour into it he turns to my wife and says "did the music j=
ust get a whole lot better?"

Heh.  Yeah it did.

Tonight I'm keeping it low key and we are going to the night tour at the SF=
 Zoo.  If you've never done this, its pretty fun.  The kids run around in t=
he zoo in the dark with flashlights looking for animals.  The animals of co=
urse know better and are mostly asleep and/or hiding from said kids with fl=
ashlights.  But its kind of fun to run around in the zoo in the dark and th=
e kids feel like they are getting away with something.  Recommended for sfr=
avers with kids!

I'm getting pretty psyched for next weekend.  Stillsome work to do on costu=
mes and "props"  however.  But now I need to rest.  You know us old folks h=
ave to save our energy and take lots of naps...

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sunset on sunday?

We're probably going to be over in the Haight picking up last minute costume stuff and might swing by...but we've got a pretty full weekend so I'm not sure we'll make it.

The bandshell is kind of weird place for a party actually...has anyone done this before?  I would like to have a party over in the Tea Garden with people dancing on those cool bridges...

Anyway, its going to be pretty warm in the city this weekend I understand, so should be a great day for a park party.

Peter

Biography: ALEX SMOKE

Alex Smoke is unique talent to emerge from the Glasgow music scene. This
young producer is pushing the boundaries of electronic music with his
innovative fusion of deep European minimalism with emotional strings and
intellegent electro rhythms. Alex has a classical music background which
reveals itself in the quality of his arrangements. In the past two years the
music world has witnessed his rapid ascent through the ranks of the techno
elite. Since the 2005 release of his brilliant debut LP on Soma,
'Incommunicado' he has been booked to play the clubs and festivals of the
UK, Europe and beyond. His coveted releases on Berlin label Vakant have
cemented his club credentials and found their way into boxes and laptops of
innovative DJs everywhere. Not content with a slew of killer twelves, Alex
Smoke remixes have constantly been in demand, recently renovating Mylo, Alex
Under and Vector Lovers. 2006 has shaped up to be another monumental one for
Alex Smoke with the release of his second LP, 'Paradolia' and subsequent UK,
European, and US live tours.

Biography: JUSTIN MARTIN

Justin Martin is one of the few house DJs that successfully bridges the gap
between being commercially successful and staying true to the underground.
His sound has been described as both melodic and tough, with releases
ranging from the dynamic "Cicada" on dirtybird to the slamming "Magnificent"
remix for Iz and Diz on OM records.  Justin first gained international
acclaim for his single, "The Sad Piano," on Ben Watt's Buzzin'fly label. The
single made its way into many A-List DJ crates as well as receiving many
accolades from critics. Over time, Justin developed a more edgy sound in his
hometown of San Francisco. He helped develop the local dirtybird label with
his good friend, Claude VonStroke, releasing several amazing singles and
remixes. Justin considers himself lucky to be making music and is always a
humble, but rocking presence on the dance floor. Stay tuned for some amazing
collaborations with his brother Christian coming soon on dirtybird as well
as a mix compilation on the Om Winter Sessions Series.

Sucka...I was trying to help. I don't have time to do all the work FOR 
people, lol.

FYI - all I did was google "golden gate park map" to get that. There are a 
ton of other maps...so, I'm sure one has info.

Subject: [sfraves] old school track ID

Diva house track, starts with the words "hit me"  then (duh) a female vocalist sings "this is the real thing" "you can give me pain, you can give what you want, you can give me sun, you can give me rain" etc.  while backing singers sing "This is the real thing bitch" periodically.

This one is pretty old I believe...

Thanks!

Peter

I know a few of you listen to jam bands and some of you probably play
in one - any recommendations for good sites to post music events?

For those of you into psychadelic rock, check out chrisbramble.com ,
he just released a new album "Laugh At The Wind". Click 'The Muse' for
song downloads.

And speaking of Love Infusion...

I just read that SomArts founder Jack Davis recently had a heart attack...if you don't know about Jack read about him here:  http://laughingsquid.com/2006/09/16/best-wishes-jack-davis/

Sending some good vibes his way for a speedy and full recovery.

I am disappointed.  You are supposed to wait until your fiancee is asleep, =
then have sex with the San Jose girls, then toss them out on the street bef=
ore the fiancee wakes up.

Then go to work and smile knowingly at the drunk tweakers.

Wasn't this in a movie?  I am sure it was.

Regards,

Peter

RENT Out Tonight Lyrics
MIMI
What's The Time?
Well It's Gotta Be Close To Midnight
My Body's Talking Me
It Says, 'Time For Danger'
It Says 'I Wanna Commit A Crime
Wanna Be The Cause Of A Fight
Wanna Put On My Tight Skirt And Flirt
With A Stranger'

I've Had A Knack From Way Back
Breaking The Rules Once I Learn The
Games
Get Up - Life's Too Quick

I Know Someplace Sick
Where This Chick'll Dance In The Flames

We Don't Need Any Money
I Always Get In For Free
You Can Get In Too
If You Get In With Me

Let's Go Ouuuuuut Tonight
I Have To Go Ouuuuuut Tonight
You Wanna Play?
Let's Run Away
We Won't Be Back
Before It's new years day
Take Me Ouuuuuut Tonight (Meow)

When I Get A Wink From The Doorman
Do You Know How Lucky You'll Be?
That You're On Line With The Feline Of
Avenue B

Let's Go Ouuuuuut Tonight
I Have To Go Ouuuuut Tonight
You Wanna Prowl
Be My Night Owl?
Well Take My Hand We're Gonna Hooooowl
Ouuuuut Tonight

In The Evening I've Got To Roam
Can't Sleep In The City Of Neon And Chrome
Feels Too Damn Much Like Home
When The Spanish Babies Crrrrrry

So Let's Find A Bar
So Dark We Forget Who We Arrrrre
And All The Scars From The
Nevers And Maybes Diiiiiie

Let's Go Ouuuuut Tonight
Have To Go Na na Out Tonight
You're Sweet
Wanna Hit The Street?
Wanna Wail At The Moon Like A Cat In
Heat?
Just Take Me Ooouuut Tonight

Please Take Me Ouuuut Tonight
Don't Forsake Me - Ouuuuut Tonight
I'll Let You Make Me - Ouuuuuut Tonight
Tonight - Tonight - Tonight



-- 
Take Care <3
Peace=->Jus' Me =-> ObY {8O)

My girl just picked that up Saturday whilst we were rekkid shopping. It's 
kinda hot. Not enough of the original vox (IMHO), but it's a funky banger.

FYI - I nabeed a mess of vinyl Saturday - house & breaks...and will nab more 
this week. It's so on!

Thanks Bam.  I was just about to post something snarky about how Marc(o)'s repsonse wasn't really a helpful track ID...

Still waiting on a tow truck.  Have I mentioned how much I hate cars today?

I hate cars.   Bleh.

shell area any day.

Actually, that track is a white label...it doesn't have any info about TCR 
anywhere on it. Most Mr.Potatohead tracks are white labels...

They have a copy left at Tweekin' I'm pretty sure.

Better? Sheesh.

Much better ;)

And it sounds like someone needs to pack a bong load Mr. Grouchy...

Anyway, I can't buy anything, especially not records, until I get a report on the latest car expense.  This is the 3rd time in a week it has been in the shop.  I've already spent nearly $1500 on it.  So much for the savings I managed to squeak out this summer. Bleh.

The good news is that I already paid for my Love Infusion tickets so I'm not tempted to blow that off to save money.  Now I just have to finish my costume since I couldn't get in the mood yesterday after the latest car implosion.  My wife's costume looks pretty hot already but I still have some work to do.

Regardless, I will see y'all in the streets and on the dance floor Satuday!

Peter

Actually, that track is a white label...it doesn't have any info about TCR 
anywhere on it. Most Mr.Potatohead tracks are white labels...

They have a copy left at Tweekin' I'm pretty sure.

Better? Sheesh.

Stopped by for a short while.  Weather was perfect, and there were a good amount of people there.  However, I have to say, I'd prefer going to a day party at one of the many lucious meadows in golden gate park over the band shell area any day.

Has there been a BSP for that event here?  I don't recall seeing it.

But maybe I was hungover when it was posted.

OK,  I just checked out a picture of his head and in defense of a fellow bald guy he's got a fairly symmetric and aerodynamic head.  Not obviously lumpy or misshapen.  But I'll have to get a closer look on Saturday.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR Vidoe Games?

Been disappointed with some of the latest PC games out, I am a huge fan of
space sim games (like the older Wing Commander, X-Wing, Freespace)...but I
did find Freelancer to be fun.

Console wise I have been loading up the old Zelda games for fun (Zelda1, 2,
Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time). Guess I am getting pysch'd for the new
Zelda on the soon to be released Wii!  I want to go Wiiiii!!!!

General Midi isn't bad, and I actually dig the shit out of Carbon Community, 
but I'm not a fan of Rennie's djing, and Hyper - well - he CAN be really 
good, but damned if he ain't the Tiesto of breaks with his little "I dress

I dunno - the locals on that lineup far outweight the headliners talentwise 
IMHO. Not that that's a bad thing - but it's the headliners causing a $20

$20 seemed cheap compared to the $50 presale for the "official" after party.  FWIW I hadn't seen the BSP for the party at Mighty until today or maybe I jsut spaced it.  Anyway,beides hating on the headliners I think we can all agree that $20 is at the upper limit of what makes sense for a party.  FOr $50 I expect a t-shirt and blow job.

Didn't care for the mixes all that much compared to lets say the lights out 
series.. It is that whole Steve Angelo quirky Electro house kick.. And not 
much of the good stuff if you ask me.

Subject: [sfraves] Weekend Plans and Whatnot


So, if you know me, you might know that I am both incredibly picky, and 
open to many different genres and 'scene' thingies.

I haven't given much thought to my weekend, but I understand all hell is 
breaking loose.  So what to do?  Anything slightly/entirely off radar I 
should know about?

It's my birthday wednesday, plus I have what should be some excellent 
company going into the weekend.  So what to do?

Mooo!

So, if you know me, you might know that I am both incredibly picky, and 
open to many different genres and 'scene' thingies.

I haven't given much thought to my weekend, but I understand all hell is 
breaking loose.  So what to do?  Anything slightly/entirely off radar I 
should know about?

It's my birthday wednesday, plus I have what should be some excellent 
company going into the weekend.  So what to do?

Mooo!

you could check out Crooked on your birthday (breaks):

http://sanfrancisco.tribe.net/event/467c84b7-3be0-4793-ad02-b00c054222df

i don't know if that qualifies as slightly "off the radar" or not, but if someone can recommend the skillz party then i guess it doesn't really matter :)

love,

ADAM GOLDSTONE // REST IN PEACE

<http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto72b7EP2ceaehn6P/>Adam Goldstone passed away from heart failure, stemming from a congenital heart defect, on August 29, 2006. He was 37 years young. 

The bitterness of his loss is tempered by the fact that Adam passed preparing to do what he loved -- play music and build community -- at the <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto73b7EP2ceaehn6P/>Burning Man festival, which he fell in love with in 2005 when he first went.

Adam's mission was love, and his method was music. Make and play music, spread love, stay true to yourself...<http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto75b7EP2ceaehn6P/>remember Adam!!!  

For a (nearly) complete Adam Goldstone discography, click <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto91b7EP2ceaehn6P/>HERE. If you would like to join the family in honoring and remembering Adam, we set up a <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto72b7EP2ceaehn6P/>Myspace page in his memory. To read comments from his NYC and clubland homies, check <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto92b7EP2ceaehn6P/>this and <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto93b7EP2ceaehn6P/>this out...beyond NYC, he got love <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto94b7EP2ceaehn6P/>all over the world, cuz he went there and played music. He also was a dope <file:// http://westendrecords.com/artists/larry_bio.php3>writer.

To hear an incredible live mix from the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (c. 2003), click <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abto95b7EP2ceaehn6P/>HERE. There's another mix <http://www.wps1.org/include/shows/wps1_DJ_sessions.html>here. 

There will be a memorial party for Adam on November 14, 2006 at <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abtpbwb7EP2ceaehn6P/>Cielo in NYC, featuring Adam's favorite DJs, as well as his huge extended family and community. Please join us if you can... 
His family appreciates all the support and love we have gotten from everyone -- way too many to name, but we remember and thank each of you. If you would like to make a donation in Adam's memory, we suggest <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abtpbCb7EP2ceaehn6P/>Loisaida, Inc, which works on behalf of Adam's beloved Lower East Side/Alphabet City neighbors, or the <http://djsake1.c.topica.com/maafaK2abtpbFb7EP2ceaehn6P/>ACLU.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Only a few hours left matey!

There are still some important things to be done before the day is out...

1. Drink rum.
2. Bury yer treasure.
3. Drink a large tankard of some mysterious ill smelling swill.
4. Make someone walk the plank.
5. Drink rum.
6. Teach yer parrot swear words.
7. Practice throat cutting.
8. Drink rum.
9. Search for yer treasure.
10. Vomit into a tankard.

POWERDOWN     Inspired by Jan Lundberg
http://www.culturechange.org 215-243-3144

If the U.S. continues with its current policies, the next decades  will be 
marked by war, economic collapse, and environmental  catastrophe. Resource 
depletion and population pressures are about to  catch up with us, and no 
one is prepared. The political elites,  especially in the U.S., are 
incapable of dealing with the situation  and have in mind a punishing game 
of Last One Standing. The  alternative is Powerdown, a strategy that 
will require tremendous  effort and economic sacrifice in order to reduce 
per-capita resource  usage in wealthy countries, develop alternative energy 
sources,  distribute resources more equitably, and reduce the human 
population  humanely but systematically over time. While civil society  
organizations push for a mild version of this, the vast majority of  the 
worlds people are in the dark, not understanding the challenges  ahead, nor 
the options realistically available. This film speaks  frankly to these 
dilemmas. Avoiding cynicism and despair, it begins  with an overview of the 
likely impacts of oil and natural gas  depletion and then outlines four 
options for industrial societies  during the next decades: Last One 
Standing: the path of competition  for remaining resources; Powerdown: the 
path of cooperation,  conservation and sharing; Waiting for a Magic Elixir: 
wishful  thinking, false hopes, and denial; Building Lifeboats: the path of  
community solidarity and preservation. Timely, accessible and  eloquent, 
POWERDOWN is crucial information for our times. This is a  film presentation 
by Richard Heinberg of his own recent book by the  same name.

THIS Wednesday "FOOD JUSTICE" free showing
9/20 come catch this 20 min. food flick wednite 8pm, it's fresh and  locally 
grown ;-)

A film showing of "FOOD JUSTICE: A Growing Movement" will occur at
Station 40 (3030b 16th Street) free of charge on wednesday evening
(the 20th of September, 2006), most likely starting at 8pm *do
remember that the movie is only 20 minutes, so come too late and you
WILL miss it, although there'll probably be another good one playing
afterwards*.
Please attend if you would like to see Alemany Farm in action, and its
volunteers smile, and even speak, on camera.

-----
Here's a blurb-y type thing about the movie:

"Martina Brimmer and Zora Tucker set out to tell the story of unequal
access to food in our urban minority communities as a symptom of
environmental racism and classism.

The extraordinary vision of various organizations in west oakland and
san francisco brings to light the spirit of the food justice movement.

Striving to cultivate justice in their neighborhoods and nourish their
communities, groups such as Oakland Based Urban Gardens, People's
Grocery, Mandela's Market and the volunteers of the Alemany Farm are
confronting social, agricultural and environmental issues that affect
us all.

FOOD JUSTICE: A GROWING MOVEMENT was conceptualized in a cafe in
Prescott, Arizona by two strangers, Zora Tucker and Martina Brimmer.
The project was formally Martina's Senior Project, but instantly
became a mutual adventure as Zora quit her job to accompany Martina.
Neither of them had so much as made home-videos, much less attempted
to document an issue which called for articulate exposure.
The two felt that the issues of urban food security and their
relationship to systemic oppression, environmental racism, health
issues and the failure of our conventional food system needed to reach
the public, with primary distribution within the communities that bear
the consequences of social inequity. It was also their intention as
activists to portray the world which they are striving to create, and
so Martina and Zora focused upon several of many Bay Area grassroots
projects that they feel are the food justice movement."

Talk about sex at One Taste  Wednesday, September 20   8:00 PM
Imagine this: A room full of turned on people with their full  attention on 
you. They raise their hands, the facilliator calls on  them, and they get to 
ask you a question on any topic on any level of  intensity.

"What is your favorite sexual position?"
"What turns you on?"
"What makes you the most jealous?"

You've got three options - (a) Tell the truth, (b) Lie, or (c) refuse  to 
answer. Just like life. What would you do?

Come experience this and more at the InSight Institute's weekly IN  Group. 
At these groups, we play structured communication games aimed  at you having 
more intimacy and fun in your life. Can you imagine a  life full of 
pleasure? Come and find out how. Singles, couples,  friends, communities, 
and more invited.

When: Thursday nights: 7:45pm to 10:30pm
Cost: $10 sliding scale
Contact: 415.503.1100 - http://www.InSightInstitute.net
Where: Hosted by One Taste Urban Retreat Center 1074 Folsom at 7th  Street

technically, Strategik is involved in the float but are not involved
(as a crew) with the Love Infusion afterparty.

the afterparty is Opel, Evil Breaks, Tantra and the Ambient Mafia.

two Strategik DJs will be playing in the Evil Breaks room, though.

BLA BLA BLA!

Give 'em some credit since they are playing...I'd say they're involved.

But of course I like to credit all parties involved in throwing an event - 
from the talent to the actual promoters. But that's just me...

Subject: [sfraves] Newsweek: Poor but Sexy

This story from Newsweek strikes a chord as we get ready to celebrate our l=
ittle local version of the Love  Parade....

Peter



Berlin's coolest new club, Kubik, hides behind an unmarked gate across from=
 a crumbling house full of squatters in a derelict downtown lot on the rive=
r Spree. It's built entirely from refashioned industrial containers emanati=
ng a translucent green light. If they seem to be almost alive, it's no acci=
dent; thanks to an edgy software interface, they pulsate to DJ Bobby Fr=C3=
=B6hlich's smooth post-techno beats. Amid the occasional sweet scent of can=
nabis, crowds of twentysomethings party until dawn. Sic transit Gloria Mund=
i . This weekend the cubes will be taken down and, poof, Kubik will be no m=
ore.

 =20
    Quirky, creative and outrageously cheap--the cover charge is but a sing=
le euro, and beers cost =E2=82=AC2--Kubik is a perfect metaphor for the new=
 Berlin. Remember all that post-unification speculation that the city, as a=
 rising Germany's new capital, would metamorphose from a gritty outpost of =
the cold war into yet another homogenized, prosperous Eurotropolis? Forget =
it. The post-unity boom has fizzled--and most Berliners are perfectly happy=
 about it.

=20
    Once again, their city is both Germany's undisputed lifestyle capital--=
and worst economic laggard. Judging by the bustling caf=C3=A9s, thriving ar=
t galleries and ubiquitous club scene (think Kubik, squared), you'd never k=
now that Berlin suffers from nearly 20 percent unemployment. Per capita inc=
ome is the lowest of any major German city. The economy has shrunk by 10 pe=
rcent over the last decade, and the city's public debt, amounting to some =
=E2=82=AC80 billion, is more than that of Peru, Ecuador and Guatemala combi=
ned. Kubik is a symbol of all this, too. After all, the lot on which it sta=
nds, free of charge, has been on the market for nearly 15 years--prime down=
town riverside real estate that can't find takers at one fifth what it woul=
d cost in London.

=20
    All this would be a cause of outrage in most world cities. Yet Berliner=
s are at ease. Most were tickled when Klaus Wowereit, their popular partygo=
ing mayor, dubbed the town "poor but sexy" late last year. A Social Democra=
t governing in coalition with the communists, the openly gay 52-year-old is=
 a shoo-in to win Berlin's Sept. 17 election. His opponent, a sober-suited =
conservative, gets zero traction. Why? Because Wowi, as he's called, has ma=
naged to finesse the mess. Though nearly bankrupt, the city has kept budget=
 cutbacks small enough to avoid angering voters. That's important, given th=
at a whopping 41 percent of Berliners live off government subsidies--pensio=
ns, welfare, unemployment--and that the city's 200,000 civil servants make =
up one of the municipality's biggest voting blocs. And so what if that Kafk=
aesque bureaucracy is infamous for harassing entrepreneurs and stifling dev=
elopment? In this, Berlin reflects Germany's broader electoral and economic=
 conundrum:
 how to reform when a growing majority of voters directly benefit from the =
old yet unsustainable order?

=20
    As most Berliners see it, Wowereit has done well merely by keeping thin=
gs from getting worse. And in time, it may well be that Berlin's poor-but-s=
exy cachet turns out to be an advantage. Tourist numbers are up 22 percent =
this year--driven, officials say, mainly by young Europeans coming to play =
in the city's ever-cool club scene. The dearth of other economic activity, =
and the accompanying lack of free-spending business travelers, means hotels=
 are dirt cheap. A room in a four- or five-star hotel (the only category fo=
r which comparative numbers are available) costs an average of =E2=82=AC127=
, versus =E2=82=AC277 in London and =E2=82=AC294 in Milan. As a result, Ber=
lin has outpaced Barcelona and Rome as a tourist destination and is now sec=
ond in Europe only to Paris and London. The city's raffish edge, in fact, i=
s part of its drawing power--not unlike Berlin in its Weimar heyday. Recent=
ly the official tourist board added an "adults only" section to its Web sit=
e, promoting, among other
 venues, the legendary Kit Kat, a techno club where "guests act out their s=
exual fantasies."

=20
    Unsurprisingly, creative industries like music, fashion and design are =
thriving in the new Berlin. They profit not only from low operating costs a=
nd cheap rents but also from a steady influx of artists and counterculture =
types arriving from elsewhere. Fashion designer Carolin Sinemus, whose Sisi=
 Wasabi brand turns out traditional German Trachten with a 21st-century twi=
st, says she knows of no other city where start-up costs are so ridiculousl=
y low. She's part of a burgeoning industry of more than 800 small, independ=
ent fashion labels, most of them only a few years old.

=20
    They've been joined, since 1998, by more than 300 new film and TV produ=
ction start-ups and an equal number of new music labels, according to Tanja=
 M=C3=BChlhans of Berlin's Economics Ministry. Tim Renner, CEO of record la=
bel Motor Music, says, "Berlin is like New York in the early 1980s--bankrup=
t but incredibly creative. Since it costs nothing, you can afford to make f=
ewer compromises and be more radical." That would include Super700, a band =
of three Albanian sisters his label has produced. Berlin's newest poster ch=
ild of sexy chic is Graft, an interior-design team that has raked in awards=
 for the futuristic organic shapes that grace the new Fix restaurant at the=
 Bellagio in Las Vegas, as well as Berlin's ultrastylish Hotel Q, recently =
voted the world's best designed hotel by Travel & Leisure magazine.
=20
=20
    The experimental has, of course, always been a hallmark of Berlin. Back=
 in '89--as a half-forgotten outpost of the cold war, surviving on subsidie=
s handed out to citizens and companies merely for staying--it was an oasis =
where artists, nonconformists and revolutionaries could rub elbows, secure =
in their tatterdemalion chic. Today, Berlin feels a bit the same way, this =
time removed from much of the rat race of globalization. Sure, the city has=
 huge, unsolved problems--from dysfunctional schools to hundreds of thousan=
ds of missing jobs. And now, as then, Berlin is hopelessly dependent on pay=
ments from Germany's richer regions, lavish flows that create very little i=
ncentive for Wowereit's government to cut costs or promote business growth =
and boost tax revenues. But as long as their city stays cheap, cool and liv=
able, most Berliners (and of course their visitors) don't seem to mind.=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Massive Attack + Shadow Ticket Available

Agent Smith,

I didn't know you lived over there...

I was just poking around in Moe's books yesterday.  Next time I'm in the neighborhood I'll ping you and you can buy me a beer or something. ;)

Sadly I can't afford the tickets tho.  

Also, FWIW, for those on the list that have expressed an interest in Buddhism, there is a wonderful boxed hardback copy of Zen Flesh, Zen Bones for $10 at Moe's.  I was very tempted to buy it myself because it was so wonderful, really a work of art, but since I already have a copy I left it there for YOU.  

This book needs a good home.

Peace,

Peter

the afterparty is Opel, Evil Breaks, Tantra and the Ambient Mafia.

two Strategik DJs will be playing in the Evil Breaks room, though.

Well, I've only been on here 3 years now, and I'm kind of a black sheep, so 
I'm not too surprised ;)

But FYI - my bday is St.Pattie's Day (March 17th), be prepared for an all 
out banger of a one off this upcoming year ;)

the afterparty is Opel, Evil Breaks, Tantra and the Ambient Mafia.

two Strategik DJs will be playing in the Evil Breaks room, though.

awesome idea.  there are lots of unused intermodal shipping =20

all we need is a patch of dirt, and we could set up an instant club. :-)

Yes thats correct.  I have also been told that he has the loudest car in the 
world.  Tipper is the man and can't wait to hear his new music that 
supposudly will be played for the first time at this show!

QUOTE:

"Tippermusic proudly presents Tipper's new downtempo album 'The Seamless 
Unspeakable Something' with a special twilight performance. This is the 
global debut, and outdoors as the sun sets over northern California is how 
it should be presented and heard. Tipper always feels home in these parts, 
and this is his way of thanking the Bay Area 'extended family' that has been 
such a strong support over time; with an extra special selection intended to 
sonically reward those in attendance."

END QUOTE:

I can't fucking wait!

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Yes thats correct.  I have also been told that he has the loudest car in the 
world.  Tipper is the man and can't wait to hear his new music that 
supposudly will be played for the first time at this show!

Subject: [sfraves] shooting in the sunset

Someone was shot 1 block from my house last night near Sunset and Ocean Streets.

This follows the shooting of a 19 year old at a party two nights ago in Ingleside.

Be careful out there people.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] shooting in the sunset

It seems things are heating up here in San Francisco...

I'm not exactly sure what happened here in the Sunset yet, and the police aren't saying.  It appears to be an attempted robbery, and the guy that was being robbed took a swing at the robber who then shot him in the shoulder.  There's blood on a lampost and the sidewalk and I saw an ambulance take the guy away.  I'm pretty sure he was alive.  The police were right there and chased the shooter up my street. I saw that part too.  

Police combed the neighbor for a couple of hours in the dark looking for the weapon but didn't find it.  Not sure if they caught the shooter or not.

With all the parties this weekend and the parade people should be extra careful. Last year there was a very high police presence at the festival grounds, kind of over the top IMO, and I know at least one person that's not going this year bc of that.  But we should all be extra careful around the afterparties and look out for each other.  Sometimes these sorts of events attract people with bad intentions in addition to the usual happy sparkley people.  Keep alert if you are party hopping in the SOMA area especially.

Peace,

Peter

Wow.  Score.  Wish he was dropping some of his wicked, intensely produced up
tempo breaks though.  Dave's production is *tight* as shit!  Haven't heard
his down tempo stuff...but I'm sure its ill.  I guess it was a good thing I
scrolled to the bottom of the BSP to see his name.  Hell, if I were you
guys, I'd be pumping up his appearance just a touch more.  He IS the best
performer on the line-up you know.

Once a cape wearing, sword wielding geek - always a cape wearing, sword

No fanboy, "people" (i.e.e ME) are fond of making fun of geeky RPG games 
that take up peoples lives.


I make fun of my older brother every day for being sucked into Everquest and 
City of Heroes too. But HE doesn't feel the need to cry about it.

But this thread is about Andy W's fuckin' Birthday, so lets get back to the 
regularly scheduled program already in progress, mmkay?

LOL @ fanboy!!!  Hahaha.  Sorry Nico.  I agree with ol' man Marco here.
There's something about 30+ year olds sitting in a dark room for days upon
days at a time, only breaking for potty time, playing fantasy video games
that makes me want to poke fun.  Exactly the very reason why I don't allow
my son to play video games.  Go play catch or something...

Just a guess here, but does it stand for Massive Multiplayer Online?

BTW I can't stand WOW and Everquest. Not because it sucks, but because I've
seen too many friends get addicted to it and wind up wasting away on it.
Sorta like how people these days are Myspace addicts. I had a friend in
college that ended up dropping out because he would just sit in front of the
computer all day and night long. No showers, no studys, no class, just
warcrack. Guess that's what happens to spoiled kids that have their parents
pay their way through college.

Maybe they need to listen to breathe by Pink Floyd.

Anyway, Happy Birthday!

Good Dad!

I've been trying to teach my oldest Alex (almost 15!) to program and its been an uphill battle. I should have started him earlier.  Now with my younger two, we are off to the right start.  I'm teaching Bennett (3 1/2) about probability theory, and I just bought him some giant dice.  He likes to roll them and add up the dots.  Next: no limit hold-em.  Papa needs a new pair of Pumas!

Anyway, Alex is  more interested in the narrative/storytelling aspects of gaming.  He's recently been using some off the shelf tools to build his own Warcraft-like game and just joined the creative writing club at school so I'm encouraging that angle.  

Peace,

Peter

Seems like they finally got their promotions together for this one,  most
people seem to know about this party this time around!  Just wondering why
Tony isn't playing the main room...???   Little John plays some sick stuff,
but c'mon now!

This is almost assuredly an exercise in futility, but I'm trying to
find the name of the "hot" dubstep/grime track right now.  There
aren't any words, and its got a wobbly bassline.  Knowing this
describes all tracks in the genre, I'm not expect much, but I figured
I'd try.

Maybe Chris Jackson can finally recover some of his well deserved scrilla.

No joke, he once called me flipping out from a drive thru on his cell 
phone, as Live105 was using one of his tracks without permission in the 
background of a public service announcement.

You see, Chris Jackson puts his pants on one leg at a time, just like 
everybody else.  Except when he does, he makes really good records that go 
unnoticed in his own home town but are cherished collectors items 
elsewhere and licensed all over the place.  How the fuck did the hoover 
thieves and trance drones get so much credit here for doing nothing while 
we let a whole homegrown subgenre go by?

Someday, perhaps history will realize it forgot to mention a wicked 
community of productivity, creativity and progress we'll call the South 
Bay techno & house scene bound by of love of progress in music, 
ridiculously irie doja and Newcastle.  Or, nothing will change and we'll 
just know we were badass.

Either way... wouldn't change our reasons for having done it in the first 
place, just a shame.

Well, as a former Live365 employee, let me first apologize for whomever was=
 lame enough to use Chris' track without permission.  I'd be curious to kno=
w when that happened.  =0A=0AI was the CTO at the founding of the company a=
nd was there from 1998-2001.  If someone is using your track in an advertis=
ement without paying you, you can and should sue them.  I managed IP and li=
censing at another former employer (MetaTools) and IMO there is no excuse f=
or using unlicensed musical or visual works in an advertisement.  No excuse=
.  Humorously MetaTools (then MetaCreations) was sued by the lead singer of=
 the Cramps for using his image in a advertisement after I left. FWIW.=0A=
=0AI also can tell you that Live365 spent a lot of money implementing the a=
ccounting system to provide SoundExchange with the data they required to en=
able payment to artists like Chris, so I sincerely hope he does get some "s=
crilla" out of it.  Their claims that they "can't find" any of these artist=
s or labels are ridiculous.  Maybe they can't spell "Google"...=0A=0AFWIW I=
 never listen to Live365, the service has significantly diverged from my or=

Subject: RE: [sfraves] a note to the producers

That would be Live105 [KITS]..105.3 FM...not Live365.  I actually had to let
Live105 know that I would be contacting my attorney if they didn't pull the
ad...which if I recall correctly was a Sony Playstation2 spot....I nearly
crashed my car!  Apparently they got a copy of my mix album from somewhere.
They actually had the nerve to say that they would trade me the song used on
the spot for "airplay" on that horrible underground music show they air on
the weekend.  I think Mars and Mystre were involved with the show.  Needless
to say...I passed!  LOL!

A life long buddy of mine used to work at Live365...Steve Musgrave.  Did you
know him Peter??  He's a programmer, so I would imagine if you were the CTO
he might have worked for you.

Well, as a former Live365 employee, let me first apologize for whomever was
lame enough to use Chris' track without permission.  I'd be curious to know
when that happened.  

I was the CTO at the founding of the company and was there from 1998-2001.
If someone is using your track in an advertisement without paying you, you
can and should sue them.  I managed IP and licensing at another former
employer (MetaTools) and IMO there is no excuse for using unlicensed musical
or visual works in an advertisement.  No excuse.  Humorously MetaTools (then
MetaCreations) was sued by the lead singer of the Cramps for using his image
in a advertisement after I left. FWIW.

I also can tell you that Live365 spent a lot of money implementing the
accounting system to provide SoundExchange with the data they required to
enable payment to artists like Chris, so I sincerely hope he does get some
"scrilla" out of it.  Their claims that they "can't find" any of these
artists or labels are ridiculous.  Maybe they can't spell "Google"...

FWIW I never listen to Live365, the service has significantly diverged from
my original goals and objectives for it, and furthermore has completely
failed to evolve with the times.  I have some stories to tell about all of
that, but it will require a lot of alcohol to get me talking.

Peace,

Peter

A similar thing happened to me Chris, although less severe, I found out by a
fan contacting me that my mix (tussinspace#1) was played on some Korean
terrestrial radio station. They never contacted me or gave credit or
anything. Not that I would want money, but recognition would have been nice.
A lot of the songs in that mix were edits or mixes done by me and it also
included one of my tracks. I couldn't figure out the station name because it
was all in Korean. Oh well. Your situation is a lot worse, if my song was
used for a commercial I would go ape shit and contact an attorney.

Seriously, if anyone has any success or failure in contacting SoundExchange=
 please let me know.  If you look at the list of labels and artists, you'll=
 see that some of them are pretty well known.  Even some of the small indie=
 labels are easily located with a quick search on Google.  If your name is =
on there and you don't contact SoundExchange quickly they may refuse paymen=
t.  The press is hopefully going to report on the this, because the entire =
thing is o obviously a scam to keep this money.  So if you or someone you k=
now heard anything or doesn't hear anything from SoundExchange, I'd like to=
 forward it on to some people I know in the music press.  Remember though, =
you have to register with SE to get the money.=0A=0APeter=0A=0A----- Origin=

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

i was going to restart the quote of the day on september 11, the five  
year anniversary.  i just didn't feel up to it that day, but these  
thoughts have been burning a hole in my mind and they must be heard  
in this forum, here and now.  so here goes.

i'm surprised of the lack of discussion of 9/11 on the list when the  
evidence is overwhelmingly mounting that it was an inside job by  
criminal elements in our own government.  now maybe i missed a  
thread.  or maybe you're just discussing this amongst yourselves.  i  
really hope so.  no, but honestly.  don't be afraid to have a  
discussion about it right here.  last i heard this was an open  
forum.  and we shouldn't be afraid to express our opinions about this  
subject.  in fact, i think we have to.

i didn't want to believe 9/11 being an inside job could be true at  
first, but if it is true, if more people don't start speaking up  
about it and burning a copy of one of the many DVD's out there on the  
internet and giving them to friends, i fear we could be headed for  
world war 3, all started by more staged terror attacks.

anyway, those are my 2 cents, unsolicited, yes, but i think it's  
important more people start talking about this instead of just trying  
to forget about it and hope it will all just go away.  sorry, didn't  
mean to ruin the mood from the lovefest threads.

have a nice day.  fog out

Love isn't a sham.  But commerical exploitation of love is.  More freaks an=

ole civic center area is pretty intense and I wonder about the wisdom of ha=
ving an open festival there.  My daughter who was at her third Lovefest/Lov=

etc.  but was having a very hard time with seeing all the cracked out peopl=
e and junkies.  She is super sensitive to these sorts of things, almost emp=
athic really, and it bummed her out.  It was even worse when we left and wa=
lked back down Market Street.=0A=0AFirst off: naked dudes.  How many fricki=
n old naked dudes where there?  My daughter said wisely, "I think that they=
 are trying to show that we are all just naked underneath our clothes."  Ri=
ght, but some people look better with clothes ON. ;)=0A=0AWe paraded with/b=
ehind/around the Tantra float.  Although I don't usually dig psy-trance all=
 that much, the beats are driving and good for parading.  Lots of happy fre=
aks and party people in the parade and on the sidelines. Saw  Marc(o) and C=
harlotte  watching the parade, and my wife's friend from the east coast Mar=

"The Khaki Family"  OK, so there's this family walking quckly east on Marke=

visting the city on a rare sunny and warm Saturday.  So they are clearly in=
 fear of ther lives as they march past the junkies, crack heads, and so for=
th on Market Street.  The parents are holding their kids close to protect t=

San Francisco, only to find the streets filled with pounding beats, drug cr=

my family walking behind them and smiled.  Aha!  A break in the ranks!   Th=
ese people are gong to have trouble with that one.  A good reminder not to =
teach your children to fear things you don't understand.  Easier said than =

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon) 9/11 

9/11 - I have never said anything on the topic but since you put it out 
there..

How to build a new social democracy

America has overextended itself, attempting to democratize the world in the 
name of raising our own standard of living through market expansion and 
imperialism.  I believe we got what was coming to us and that message was 
clear.  Butt out of regions that don't want your demoralizing ways.. 
however fundamental or extremist those moral or ethical views of life are.

I believe we should pull out of the east, divert all war monies to 
alternative energy development, release oil from out strategic national 
development policy, and promote fair market exchange, and fair labor 
practices around the world.  I think we should cut imports and enact tariffs 
on all non-hybrid or alternative fuel vehicles.

Repeal all patriot act legislation.  Repeal all wiretapping legislation.  
Decommission the Homeland Security Administration.  Remove the provisions 
for executive powers act in non-war faring times.  Uphold Geneva conventions 
in all military prisons and tribunals.  On a side note: leave the CIA budget 
and powers intact - don't ask me why.. but I think we still need some teeth 
and information to manage our new isolationism.

Perhaps if our prerogatives for global social responsibility were as 
sensitive to the needs of the world as our European allies, we wouldnt be 
the *direct* targets of terrorism.  Do you think our standard of living, our 
education, and our retirement packages are better than anyone in France or 
Italy, or Germany, or Spain?  I would hasten to say that although I am a 
patriotic American in many respects, I struggle with out global intentions 
and feel military insurgence is not the way to manage our economic needs.  
Oil is not worth ripping apart the social fabric of the world.  It is IMHO 
the terror the breeds all the injustice we see and easy target for us to 
deal with by removing it from the lexicon of social development.

i was going to restart the quote of the day on september 11, the five  year 
anniversary.  i just didn't feel up to it that day, but these  thoughts have 
been burning a hole in my mind and they must be heard  in this forum, here 
and now.  so here goes.

i'm surprised of the lack of discussion of 9/11 on the list when the  
evidence is overwhelmingly mounting that it was an inside job by  criminal 
elements in our own government.  now maybe i missed a  thread.  or maybe 
you're just discussing this amongst yourselves.  i  really hope so.  no, but 
honestly.  don't be afraid to have a  discussion about it right here.  last 
i heard this was an open  forum.  and we shouldn't be afraid to express our 
opinions about this  subject.  in fact, i think we have to.

i didn't want to believe 9/11 being an inside job could be true at  first, 
but if it is true, if more people don't start speaking up  about it and 
burning a copy of one of the many DVD's out there on the  internet and 
giving them to friends, i fear we could be headed for  world war 3, all 
started by more staged terror attacks.

anyway, those are my 2 cents, unsolicited, yes, but i think it's  important 
more people start talking about this instead of just trying  to forget about 
it and hope it will all just go away.  sorry, didn't  mean to ruin the mood 
from the lovefest threads.

have a nice day.  fog out

--

We live in complete illegality.  As soon as somebody starts focusing  on 
some group or other for being 'illegal', i have to remind you that  this 
whole system is one continuous creeping coup; one insurrection  against law 
and constitution from beginning to end.

great post. i agree on many counts. so you're the dude with the flamingo, huh? i totally saw you at the party but we never met. you looked very festive :)

this party definitely had a vibe that i haven't been able to find lately. 4 areas of kickass music and a ton of smiling faces... i met a lot of people (including bam from this list) and they were all super cool. after all was said and done, i was feeling pretty damn good about the state of parties here. it was especially inspiring to see 4 different crews come together so well. i referred to this event as "the voltron of afterparties" on another board, and i'm happy to see it lived up to my lofty expectations.

thanks for the kind words about the ambient mafia space. my opinion is admittedly very biased, but i believe it was a great addition to the party as well. i thought i was the queen of weird tracks in that area, but the whistling sailor tune was not mine so i may have to give up my throne ;)

i was front and center for carbon community and i thought that was some great music. i was a little bummed that the drummer wasn't there as well, but that's just because i like excuses to see my friends. great set though - perfect combination of hard and melodic. the visuals at that time were also stellar.

i think the dj who played after hyper in the opel room was melyss (of Sister) and i agree that she was bangin' it out in there! i caught part of hyper and was really into the funky records he was playing, but i also though melyss kinda showed him up on a technical level.

one of my favorite things about this party was that i had room to dance. there were a lot of people there for sure, but it wasn't sardine-style in the rooms. if i wanted to dance big, i could... and at certain points, i did. it was awesome.

thanks to everyone who made this one possible! this year was the most fun i've had at any of the love parade/fest soirees.

love,
mo

Some highlights:

The tall thin girl that was dancing in the evil breaks room!  Wow!  She was one of the best dancers I've ever seen.

The visuals in the Evil Breaks room were consistently amazing.

Flamingo shadow games...

Adrianna and Keith were like toasty marshmallows.  Good to see you guys tho!

Hugs from Osby...the second best hug of the night!  The other one was from my wife ;)

Mary Ellen was a sweetie...

The guy that told us about visiting the rabbit hole at Oxford where Alice actually fell in.

The nice couple we were dancing with in the Opel room!  

The conversation in the bathroom waiting for a stall about parenting with the guy that had recently gotten married.  Dude don't worry, you are thinking about all the right things.

The lesbians that kept wanting to stroke my, err, flamingo...

I had two random encounters with Agent Smith.  But he was on a secret mission apparently.

My wife's idea for the "flamingo bong" which spawned several other fabulous flamingo fashion and technology ideas.

We went over to the Opel room for Rennie Pilgrem's set...ok well it was like weird. Too slow or something, so we went back to Evil Breaks for more flamingo love and rocking beats.  And per Marc(o) he does have a large head, but it was fairly symmetric as far as I could tell.

We cruised over to the Opel room again for Hyper's set which was good, but the female DJ that came on after him was even better...she rocked it. Not sure who she was tho...

Then we had to leave.  It seemed like the party was getting shut down as we walked out the front door...

Apologies if I left you out.  Brain cells not working too good today.

Only negative: goonish security dudes giving me the evil eye.  Big ups to the one security guy that asked me if I got tired of carrying my flamingo.  However dumb question!  It was a fluffy light up flamingo!

In sum, my faith in the SF party scene is rejuvenated and re-energized.  Thanks to Evil Breaks, Opel, Tantra, and Ambient Mafia, Viberation, and anyone else I've forgotten.  See y'all next time.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Love Infusion -- Party Review

Yeah, those were some nice clouds, I have to admit!

I would have to say overall it was a pretty great day. Just need to  
get to know more people, being the outsider is somewhat lame. At  
least my fav. dancing buddy Crystal showed up and we got to throw  
down for a few minutes. Unfortunately her weekend began to catch up  
with her shortly thereafter and she ended up tossing her lunch. :(

I took a ton of pics but most of them are just like most people's  
pics of the day will be. I may post a few if any of them seem to be  
at all worthwhile.

one of my burning man campmates is really involved in the hawaiian scene out there, and it's my understanding that it's a lot of psy. the main parties i know of out there are the Hawaii Electronic Music Festival (HEMF) which i think is in Hilo and normally in january? if memory serves, the website is www.bigislandlove.com

there is a crew out there that throws other parties as well, their name is ka pilina, but i can't remember the name of the last party offhand. check out their website too, which should be www.kapilina.org

you can look up a lot of the hawaiian events on tribe as well, i think all of those kids are fairly active on that site. 

love,
mo

Subject: RE: [sfraves] More Lovefest and Love Infusion (and other after party) pixs

Not that I don't wanna see pix of Love Fest, but does anyone have pix of the 
Folsom Street Faire?

I heard it was positively off the chain this year...lesbians 69ing in the 
streets (literally), sex parties in windows above the street, etc.

Of course I was recovering from a LONG day of hedonism Saturday, so I 
couldn't drag myself out...

if folsom street fair is your thing, that's cool, but personally i don't even bother. if you've seen 300 leather daddies in skimpy ballsack pouches, you've seen 'em all. i find it interesting for about half an hour and then i start to feel like i'm stuck in some weird time looped dungeon-world. i skipped it altogether this year. was it really that different? if so, i may have to rethink my strategy for 2007.

As it happens, my roommate got a shot of your rockstar status:

He had my camera all day but sadly, we didn't see each other til late
afternoon so there's no incriminating pics of me til later.

Oh and your set was really good, btw.

>From Jeno: 

Keep on Reachin'.. 

Join me this week folks for a special pre-Come Unity Anniversary show, which likely means I'll be digging out a few oldies and goldies for y'all. Wow, it's been 15 years already, who would have imagined we'd make it this far..!

And to compliment this week's celebration I'll have special guest dj Carlos on the show. In case you're not familiar with him - he helped define the rave scene here in the Bay Area in the mid-nineties with his natural hi-energy and boundless enthusiasm. After a hiatus of several years he has risen like the phoenix from the ashes and returned to his passion - djing. He is currently spinning again around the Bay Area, including his own monthly event "Pangea" at The Oasis in Oakland..

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] happy belated to PHillip!!!!

thanks everyone!

We just got back from Chicago & Wisconsin last night, so most of the  
day yesterday was spent on planes and in airports.

The real celebration was the entire week we were away, which also  
covered our 4th anniversary on Friday. It was a great trip - we  
packed so much into that trip, it feels like we were gone a month.

to just like well... it was just a magazine show that aired on cable &
that was SF Local Cable....

But like now, :code will be spliting up into 2 shows:  :code TV & :code TV
News.. (seriously.. don't ask me what the difference is, that's Bruce's
idea & like i'm still tryin' to figure out where the "news" part comes
in....  Hello 2Day.. LoL.. But yeah.. we just wrapped our "pilot" episode
of :code TV News & here it is :)

this is a preview of the pilot episode
http://www.veoh.com/videoDetails.html?v=e1230764BQgmMNZ

in order to view the whole episode, you will need to download a veho
player...

But yeah... not to give away why these two go hand in hand, SMC & :code,
but after you watch the pilot... you'll see :)  LoL.. I actually will be
out and about during SMC gon' to some of them workshops :)  LoL

Osby this i great!  You have found your calling I think.  That video clip e=

=0AAt the highest level SMC is an attempt to bring a world class dance musi=
c event similar to Miami's Winter Music Conference to SF.  Without some sor=
t of focal event lie this,many of these DJs would never even make it to SF =
at all.  FWIW I spoke at both the 2000 and 2001 WMCs on the future of elect=
ronic music and the Internet and I had an amazing time in Miami.=0A=0AAnywa=
y, with 20-20 hindsight, I now have some mixed feelings about WMC, and ther=
efore SMC too, because of the overwhelming influence of corporate sponsors =
and sponsorship dollars on these events.  =0A=0AFull disclosure: I was righ=
t in there as CTO of Live365.com trying to leverage our brand into WMC.  We=
 gave away a bunch of t-shirts and other crap, got banners etc. at the Ultr=
a Festival, sponsored a boat party with Essential Records and so forth.  It=
 was cool to do WMC on "other people's money"  but I now have some serious =
doubts about the impacts of commercialism and corporations on the dance mus=
ic scene.  =0A=0ADr. Motte's critiques of the 2006 Love Parade in Berlin se=
em relevant here.  That event has essentially been taken over by the corpor=
ate sponsors, who are primarily producers of alcoholic beverages as I under=
stand it.  (http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/07/15/arts/music/15para.html?pa=
gewanted=3Dall and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Parade#Future_of_Love_=
Parade)  For the first time this year all of the floats in the parade were =
identical, just with different music and logos glued on the sides.=0A=0AI'm=
 concerned that SMC wll suck the vibe out of our little Lovefest and replac=
e it with a homogeous, logo plastered, frat party.  After this past weekend=
's glimmer of hope, I'd really hate to see that happen.  It seems that we'r=
e just emerging from the post dot.bomb, post 9/11, post over hyped "electro=
nica" binge that left the rave scene badly damaged.  Anyone else know what =
I mean?  AM I talking shit here?=0A=0AI don't want to get into the tired ol=
d beef that you can't be in it for the love if you are also in it to make m=
oney.  Hell I'd quit my job in instant if I thought I could support my fami=
ly somehow from the music scene.   But I'm talking about something more, th=
e subtle or not so subtle infiltration of every aspect of our lives by corp=
orations and brands.  Its the vibe killer.=0A=0AI solicit comments from the=

his issue one one of its panels. =0A=0ARegards,=0A=0APeter=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A--=

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Summer Music Conference & the new :code tv

I think SMC can be summed up a little easier....

It's like WMC - only not in shitty ass Miami with all the shitty ass Miami 
people. And less the uber-expense.

And less cheese trance/prog.

Can we say "better"?

No, because it also looks like there's going to be about 5-10% of the =
amount
of premier DJs and industry folk in town for SMC.  WMC has about 5 =
parties a
night that for my favorite little sub genre of music completely blow me =
away
and make me want to die to get to them, for about 5 days straight.  And =
I
bump into ALL the industry heads every year, everywhere.  Not to mention
being able to walk to almost every venue.  This is what SMC is aspiring =
to
be it seems and I'm all for it, but it's not close to there yet in it's
first year.  Should still be a great weekend though.

All  I know is - it's not in weak ass South Beach with a buncha weak ass 
"see and be seens". Of course the 1st year is gonna be small in comparison - 
it takes SUPPORT to make something like this go off.

Now let's see how many SF "industry" heads actually support their local 
scene enough to make this thing as big if not bigger than WMC.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Summer Music Conference & the new :code tv

Yea...I dunno -I know major label producers that think it's a waste of time 
if you aren't shopping your tracks, etc.

If I want good parties with headliners, I'll stay here in the city and wait 
- they all come around here anyway.

If I want warm weather, I'll go to Mexico - at least there I can get wrecked 
on 'scripts and avoid the South Beach douchebag crowd.

I am anti- Florida in almost every capacity - so maybe that's why WMC holds 
absolutely NADA for me.

I am however, totally psyched about SMC.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Summer Music Conference & the new :code tv

Yeah the whole point is that for that week we take over South Beach, =
I've
never been turned away at the door for dress or appearance, and I've =
never
been to parties with thicker vibes than the best at WMC.  When you're in =
a
packed spot, with one of the best DJs in the world playing, and every =
single
person in there knows and appreciates how well they're playing, that =
vibe
just bounces right back to the DJ and you get some of the most amazing =
sets
and dj/crowd vibes feeding off each other, it can be unbelievable.  =
Never
experienced anything like it anywhere else.

And I don't think SMC will ever get as big as WMC, we simply don't have =
the
venues available to us, especially in such close proximity.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Summer Music Conference & the new :code tv

I dunno - call me spoiled, I have experienced what you mentioned MANY times 
at Buzz in DC. And a shitload of times at spots like the OW as well. But to 
each their own - you like shi-shi house events, I like dirty techno & 
breaks. Apples & Oranges.

And I think the reason (if any) that SMC won't fare as well as WMC 
is...well...I'm gonna curb my urge to slam folks right now, cuz I've had a 
crappy day and it'll sound much meaner than I want to. Suffice it to say - 
"SF scenester primadonnas" about sums it up.....

And no - before you get all offended, that wasn't meant towards you - and 
NO, I will not clarify.

--

If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue
of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the
banks...will deprive the people of all property until their children
wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered... The
issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the
people, to whom it properly belongs.


- President, Thomas Jefferson

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Summer Music Conference & the new :code tv

No, you haven't.  Straight up.  It is a completely different vibe when =
you
are in a room with 100-200 people, and every single one of them is a =
serious
dj/producer/record label owner that has been in the industry for years =
upon
years and deems it worthy to spend a lot of time and money to make it =
out to
Miami, and every single one of them is going nuts like they're fanboys =
again
to DJ after DJ that rank in the best of the world.  It is a completely
different level of appreciation and crowd reaction specifically because =
of
the crowd involved.  Not to devalue your experiences, it is just a =
different
thing altogether.

Again, I have been to a number of events over my 10+ years on listening =
to
and playing this music, and seen a number of thick ass vibes at parties, =
and
I'm not saying every year or party at WMC is like that by a long shot, =
but
when the stars align, nothing comes close to touching the pinnacle of a =
few
of the best parties I've been to at WMC.

And bite me and die for the chi chi comment, you're soooo much more ug =
than
me man, dirty is cool.  :p  I like good underground funky ass house =
music,
and I'll go to whatever venue has it on a given night, club underground =
or
other.

well, i understand where you're coming from.  like i said previously, =20=

here's a common definition of the word conspiracy:

conspiracy |k=C9=99n=CB=88spir=C9=99s=C4=93| |k=C9=99n=CB=8Csp=C9=AAr=C9=99=
si| |k=C9=99n=CB=8Csp=C9=AAr=C9=99si|
noun ( pl. -cies)
a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful : a =20
conspiracy to destroy the government. See note at plot .
=E2=80=A2 the action of plotting or conspiring : they were cleared of =20=

conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

this not only applies to the unofficial theories, but also the =20
official story that 9/11 was a conspiracy carried out by 19 hijackers =20=

carrying box cutters, of which half have been found to actually be =20
still alive as admitted by mainstream media outlets.  so you're =20
right, conspiracy theories are hard to prove, but the official story =20
is getting harder and harder to believe by each passing day.

> secrecy" and neither major political party is planning to end that =20
> rule.  The cult of secrecy actually rules both parties.  See also =20
> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner

yes, there's definitely a tag team going on between the major =20
political parties, the mainstream media, and the largest =20
corporations.  so if you don't like george bush, maybe they could =20
point you to hillary clinton, who will undoubtedly say she can fight =20
the war on terror better, or maybe we could turn back to al gore and =20
his malthusian apocalyptic theories on global warming, which isn't =20
much discussed on mainstream media, but is thought by some scientists =20=

to be caused more than anything else by the sun, and may reach its =20
peak in about 7 years.

anyway ...

also see the bohemian grove, located right in northern california in =20
the town of monte rio, california, where the world elite businessmen =20
and politicians meet to witness dark satanic rituals, the bilderberg =20
group, where the top elites meet to decide world policy, and the =20
council on foreign relations, where the policies are disseminated to =20
its elite members.  one of those policies is the intent to establish =20
a world government.  anyone been watching CNN reporting on plans =20
currently underway to establish a north american union?  congress has =20=

taken no action for or against this but apparently it's already =20
happening.

ok, so this is enough from me for today.  i could go on but i'll just =20=

put little bits of opinion mixed with quotes in the quote of the day =20
when i feel up to it, and hopefully the willing will still read them.

be safe out there at your parties.  i'll try to join you sometime =20

Involved [Sasha's Unicef charity organization] has a few Summer Music  
Conference all access passes & various tickets up for auction on  
eBay. No one-- except me, apparently-- has placed a bid & the passes  
are WAY below cost, and ending in a few hours. I dealt with the  
organization's coordinator Sherri several times last year, she's a  
really nice lady & it's a great organization, so I'm just hoping to  
generate some interest in the items here & save her the trouble of  
underselling/relisting them...

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Summer Music Conference & the new :code tv

It's our all techno and dirrrrtttyyyy breaks party, next Friday.  The =
vibe
will be better than anything you've ever experienced, because I'll be =
there.
Barney will too.

No seriously it's next Friday and we have all our resident musicians =
coming
in at once, should be pretty crazy and I can't believe we've made it two
years.  Seems like yesterday Anu was just a hallway bar and George and I
were learning what a "flyer" is, thanks to everyone on the list who has
supported!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Summer Music Conference & the new :code tv

All jokes aside - Folded is a FUN time. I love Anu, I love you chi-chi house 
fuckers (ok, maybe not ALL jokes aside), and I love the beats there...

Happy freakin' anniversary (albeit a tad early)...It's  99.9% I'll be there, 
barring act of god.

Subject: [sfraves] Fwd: Native Instruments at Digiworld San Francisco

I thought the software geeks might want to check this out next

In celebration of the release of the Digital D&A music label and the culmination of the First Annual Summer Music Conference in San Francisco, we gather to showcase the continuing digital revolution in electronic dance music. Featuring such labels as TEKELEC (UK) Fevah US, Vibrance Recordings, and our new baby, Digital D&A. In association with Beatport, and with support from Spundae, Fevah, and Vibrance, D&A Music proudly brings you... 
 
DIGITAL AGE 
Thursday, September 28th, 2006 
 
Main Room (Tech Trance): 
 
Ali Wilson (TEKELEC, Quality Trax, UK) 
Ali Wilson has consistently risen in the UK dance scene, although he had his humble beginnings in Hard Dance with releases on such labels as Flashpoint, Freezing Point, Quality Trax, 5AM, and many others; he has now switched lanes and now runs and promotes his own label, TEKELEC. Tekelec sees constant pushes from Carl Cox, Marvo V, and Sander Van Doorn among others. While he does showcase the pioneering of the tech trance scene as a whole, also come to watch this greatly talented DJ display the works! 
 
With D&A Residents: 
Durty (D&A Music, Nocturnalism, Evolution, djDurty.com) 
Viticus (D&A Music, Quality trax) 
Dekota (D&A Music) 
 
Side Room: 
 
Alain Octavo (Spundae, alainoctavo.com) 
Alain Octavo is a master of his craft, and he is as diverse as it gets. Which explains why he is the go-to opener for all of Spundae's A-List headliners. 
 
Andrew Innes (Beatport, Fevah US) 
Andrew is the most interesting of DJs. Now in Chicago, he originally hails from New Zealand, and has done everything from catch wild animals in the America southwest to fishing in Antarctica for Padagonian Tooth Fish. He also is one half of the "Fevah Bros." and founder of Fevah US, and the huge download giant, Beatport.com. He will most likely drop an illegal amount of funky electro house on this parade! 
 
Carlos Alfonzo (Vibrance Recordings, House Nation, BR) 
DJ PM (Evolution, Ear Wacks)

So, I ended up at Temple last night, on First & Howard, I believe.  I had
not been there before - is this a new venue?  Anybody know about this place?

(I felt under-dressed in my denim)

Thanks,
Jessie

Ah, I was not there when it was DV8...

The set up is really open on the main floor, high ceilings...very white &
clean...there are booths/banquettes set up in the back and on the
side...they were playing house in this area...they have a decent size bar,
but $30 minimum on credit cards.  I only drank beer, and I didn't pay for
it, so no clue on pricing for that.  They had dancers on an upper level that
you could see through a shade (silhouettes) - very sexy...

The lower level is much darker, lower ceilings, very 'temple' feeling...they
have stone columns & I don't know if you remember the James Bond game from
Nintendo64...but there is a basement/temple level from that game which
totally reminded of the space I was in last night.  Lots of space for
dancing.  Behind the DJ booth there were a plethora of black leather couches
- quite comfortable,and the music was just as loud there as it was in front
of the booth.

Off to the side of the main room downstairs, there is a small chill room,
with brighter, cleaner lighting (reminiscent of upstairs decor) - large bar,
lots of seating...but quiet music which I could barely hear over the din.

The sound in the large rooms was actually quite good.  Now, keep in mind, I
was pretty drunk when I arrived, but it was rich, with a good balance of
treble & bass.  It sounded better than Mighty does a lot of the time.

A plus for me was bathrooms are on both floors...

Security was a non-issue...just checked IDs and directed you inside.

I did feel under-dressed though in my jeans & sweater...it was a sexy
outfit, but not dressy at all.  A lot of the girls were in skirts &
non-denim items...good looking crowd though, and less obnoxious than the
crowds I experience at Ruby Skye.

I preferred the lighting & atmosphere in the lower level - they had this
cool green LASER light going on by the DJ booth down there. It just a had a
much darker, dirtier feel...

Speaking of good sound...I have had a rack of bad sound experiences at 
Mighty in the past, but man, at Love Fest that shit was going off!

I like the venue, so it really enhanced trhe vibe for me...

Good sound = way better than decor.

I enjoyed the music in the lower level more than on the main level.  It was
just your standard house up there, hard to go wrong, but nothing
mind-blowing.  Downstairs I heard some electro...I really do love
electro...it got me moving a bit.  Embarassing though, I have no idea who
was spinning.  (I was entertaining a broker for dinner and consumed a bit
too much alcohol prior to heading over...complete accident ending up there)

I personally think the sound at Ruby Skye is better...but the atmosphere at
Temple is a bit cooler...Sound is the most important part of the equation.
I love to dance, and if it sounds like crap, it's hard to want to dance.
The only reason I compared it to Mighty is because that is a place I
frequent and I have had some nights where the sound is amazing there (this
past weekend) and nights where it has been AWFUL (think thanksgiving last
year - during lee coombs set - the sound went out - WTF).

I may head out there again to check ShyFX this weekend though...

that was a great description of the place for those of us who haven't been yet. thank you! it sounds like this venue has places to sit and hang out (couches, chill area, etc.) which i really like. i think that's one major thing that ruby skye is missing. it seems like all of the places to sit are roped off every time i go there. i'd be willing to brave that crowd more often if there were couches to retreat to once in a while.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Temple

Dunno to be honest - normally, or rather, some of the time - the sound has 
been either tinny and lacking in mids, or farty, and totally lacking in 
proper mids and highs - what us muscian folk call "muddy" sound.

This past weekedn it was clear as a bell, loud, but very warm and 
responsive. Like a good system once it's been warmed up and the subs are 
nice and flexed out.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr legal advice

I'm sure a couple of heads out there know about this
type of stuff.

I have an ex, who unfortunately, for no reason, is
withholding some of my belongings from me and will not
return them to me or let me retrieve them from him. I
wouldn't care but some of those things are some very
valuable records to me and I'd like to get them back.

It might seem silly and petty but I was wonder if I
could do anything to get my stuff back legally. Maybe
sue him for it? Problem is I have no receipts etc. to
prove the value of my belongings. Any help will be
greatly appreciated. Graci.

Can you email him and get him to say in writing you can't have the stuff back? That would give you the ammo you need to escalate the situation legally me thinks. 
   
  Good luck,

The DV8 was the home of one of the first "rave" parties  -- Pete Avila's Osmosis. I still have little liquid filled tubes advertising the event. 

Last event I attended there was, I believe, "Release the Queen."  Sex room and all:)  In fact, there used to be rooms with a view where one was encouraged to have public sex.

No bottle service in those days.  No VIP memberships.  Dress was creative costuming made from thrift stores.

Keith Haring did a room there, that was fortunately removed and preserved when the club closed.

Yes, the police escort idea is a GREAT ONE!

But.... If the situation is bad enough that he won't
give back your stuff, and knowing your ideas about
life via your sig file, I would watch what you do....

If not, you may find your ex outing you on all kinds
of things you would rather have kept private...

Just know that when things go from bad to worse, even
the secrets you assumed were secrets to the grave have
a way of coming back to bite you in the ass.

I'll second the recommendation for the police. They can actually be  
quite helpful in situations like this, but its kinda a dice role.  
They could be helpful or they could be not. if you go over there with  
an officer and your ex says the stuff is not yours its highly likely  
that the officer will be able to tell that he is lying and will be  
interested in helping you resolve the situation without taking it any  
further. (i.e. courts, etc.)

No ex-bf. We weren't cohabitating and he was keeping
my stuff while I was looking for a place to live.
Things basically ended badly and I have since tried to
get my belongings back with no luck. Its been almost a
year now since I've asked for it back. He's not
claiming they are his. He's just being a a jerk
basically. I think the police officer thing would be a
good way. Thanks!

Sounds good to me. People need to have more class. I find public displays of
affection (something more then a hug) disgusting.

a couple of years ago when my exhubby was cheating on me, the woman who left her records with him while they were having the affair then decided to get them back when the affair was over it took awhile like almost 8 months, because him being the punkass that he was didnt want to give them back...she showed up at his work with a police officer, since she didnt have our address, she eventually got the records back from him...hope this helps..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Green Velvet musta known we were coming

He dropped that +8 track, it was pretty fun.  He dropped ... a lot of good 
solid techno, call it what you want.  It was an amazing surprise when all I 
came into it was expecting to pay $20 for good house.

I don't get it, he knocked the chewing gum out of the mouths of kids with 
discretion.  And you left half way through?  :(

Chris, that track where he calls out kids in the back for being all high, 
wasn't as hard as the one he did that same voice over to last night.  Was 
pretty sick.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr legal advice

I know I was a bit sarcastic in my llast response...
and this is more a course of action response ...

1) contact the guy and tell him you would like to get
your stuff. Ask him a closed end question like ... "I
have time monday or tuesday evening to come get my
records, which night is better for you?"

2) Wait for respoonse. If negative, tell him, " This
has gotten a bit ridiculous.The only recourse I have
to retrieve my stuff is to ask for a police escort to
aid me in the process. They do this daily, and without
question to help take the tension out of domestic
situations. I think it would suck for both of us to
have to get the police involved, so can we just meet
at  Starbucks and you can give me my records back. Or
better yet, our mutaul friend X can come by and save
us both the hassle of seeing eachother."

3) If this does not work, let him kow that the only
recourse you now have is the police action.
Furthermore, since you do not know where he now lives,
you would have to come to his work in order to
confront him. And although you think that is a
terrible idea, because it would embarress him and make
him look like a criminal to his co-workers, it is the
only chopice he is giving you.

Hope that helps.
