i wuz in fresno for the past 6 daze, not a lot of net access, so here's
  my belated thoughts on fnf5

serious ass-kicking all around, it was GREAT to finally see the sfraves
  crew in person; i really regret not being able to meet you all.

particularly liked the wall-painting, some REALLY nice comic book art
  was done on one of the walls (where everyone was sortof sitting on
    the ground during the ambient sets)

wish i'd known about the bloody van!!!

hats off to wbl, there performance was better than the CD i have; and
  i hope there's another being stamped as i type this....
    (i think that's _their_ performance)

don't know when i'll have another chance to come up, maybe this spring
  if i get some free time; meanwhile, if anyone's coming down for
    millenium, give me a holler!

Subject: secret NYE party BUSTED
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

The Other New Years eve ball was a blast until shut down.
The dance floors, lighting, and everything were excellent.
The WBL run ambient space had crisp quadraphonic sound and fine
performances from everyone. Our WBL multi-user sequencer worked 
for the first time it was used! The warehouse was PACKED.

About 4:30am or so police came in and told us to shut down. The party
was FULL and everything was going fine.

It doesn't bother me to get shut down- this happens sometimes.

The problem did arise when people refused to leave and started yelling
at the cops. The cops just wanted everyone out of the warehouse and were
gonna take off. They did arrest a few of the party promoters though but
they were cited and released.

The people kept shouting and arguing with the police and got them angry
enough that several people were arrested. A friend of ours was taking
pictures and wa also hauled in.

The police were really fascinated by the mac that was plugged into the
Net- looking for any evidence that it was used to advertise the party.

The whole problem was that, though the party was legally permitted and
insured, they were not supposed to charge admission at the door yet
they wound up doing so. This was probably the thing that started the plice
to shut it down and the angry mob type behavior finished it off.

I didn't feel up to driving all the way to SF (from Watsonville) so I 
decided to head to the Cloud Factory party in Monterey.  I got in about 
10:30 and at that point some local industrial act was on.  This wasn't at 
all what I'd been expecting and the 10 or so people on the dancefloor 
were kicking around a couple full size blow-up dolls and a mannakin's 
head.  At this point I was getting a real negative feeling from the whole 
affair and almost headed back to a private party in Santa Cruz.

Luckily I stuck it out until the DJs came on at around 11:20; they had 
about four guys rotating around five turntables and ended up with a 
pretty cool effect.  The light show was good as well.  I was kind of 
disapointed that more people weren't dancing; a lot of them just sort of 
sat there.  There probably weren't more than 60 people on the dancefloor 
at a time.  The promoters were totally cool.  Cheap admission, no security, 
and free oranges for everyone.

I also ran into a bunch of people I hadn't seen since high school which 
was also totally cool.  Well, back to LA soon...

I'm sorry to hear that you didn't have an excellent time at the cloud
factory, nick.  But I've got to say that it was a spectacular New Year's for
me.  Granted, the industrial stuff wasn't my style but after the music
started flowing there wasn't any stopping it.  Yes, there were yer
hunter/gatherer  types but pleez, it's Monterey!  Our vibes tend to be a bit
different from sf or Santa Cruz vibes.  And if you stayed around long enough,
you could see that that core  group of people danced until the last song.
 Didn't you see Milton in his blaze of glory, or should I say Carmen Miranda
get up?  I'm not the most knowledgeable person about music but I can say that
I loved it.  
     You have to understand too that a lot of those people there have never
been to raves before and do feel self conscious about dancing don't really
know what to do.  I was completely overwhelmed at my first rave and just
wanted to get a feel for things.  And when I finally felt at ease, it changed
my life.  My friend Jodi who is really into punk  never saw what an actual
vibe was like until she had a run in with Milton and several other very
awesome people.  She said she finally understood why I go to raves and love
to dance so much.  So once again I'm sorry to hear that you didn't feel the
energy I did, I hope that you will continue to support the cloud factory
because its people like you who know what a rave IS, that we need to spread
the love.  If you saw a dude in an "I'm a pepper" t-shirt that was me... ...
.. .any others sfravers who where there care to comment (bryce, deaks, elmo)?
 
peace to ya'all and milton I hope someone found the e-bee!

Holy Shit, what a night. For some reason I had a very stupid fantasy that
wicked would go off. I got there around 7pm & had to uncomfortably hide
from those under 21 killers for a couple hours. The production was quit
cool, but other than that meaningless detail it SUCKED SHIT. I'v never
seen so many suits & ties at party in my life, no vibe, no dancing, no
good music, nutin'. At about 3 I got news that begin again was pretty
close. So I just ran there by myself. What a change of moods, being totaly
bummed about not having the spectacular n.y. I had hoped for, to instantly
turning around 180 degrees to have the time of my life. Great music, great
underground space, wonderfull people & a *great* vibe, this was definatly one
of my all time parties. Solar ripped it up, yellin & screaming along with
everybody else, this guy is one of my new found fav's. Galon brought me
into complete ectasy with the all time SF "papua new guanea" and
"midnight". It's funny how these guys with less experience & records then
the wicked(etc..) boys blow them away musicaly, as they still have gutts
to play what they realy like. Another thing I found amusing was that it
was a pretty young croud & had much more energy & maturaty then the 21+
wicked, lacking the "I know so & so" attitude that lots of older parties
are plagued with. Underground at it's FINEST. HAPPY NEW YEARS :)

Hmmm... Perhaps I gave the wrong impression.  I really did have a good 
time and wouldn't hesitate to go to another one.  It was just a little 
different from what I'm used to.

The night started out kinda strange.  My wife had to work and I started out
with a friend who has never been to a rave before.  I really wanted her to
experience a good vibe and I have to admit I felt a little pressure to find
a cool party.  We started out by going to the "Warehouse Session" at around
11:30.  There was a gang o' cops out front and within minutes they were
closing the place down.  Someone out front said "I can't believe they would
do this without a permit."  Lucky we didn't pay to go in.

Then it was off to "The Other New Year's Ball."  This production had a nice
feel.  I had heard thet Weird Blinking Lights did good work and I was
impressed (although I kinda expected lasers or some lights that actually
blinked and there weren't any).  There were two dance floors.  One played
trippy disco and fab 70's stuff.  Someone had gone to alot of trouble to
make that mix because the tunes were almost all recognizable from days gone
by but they had a really strange effect in 1994-5.  The other dance floor
was a large airplane-hanger like room with lots of psychadelic lights and
rear screen projections but no lasers or BLINKING LIGHTS.  There were two
chill rooms.  One was bright and colorful and way too crowded.  The other
had straw all over the floors and videos that someone described as
psychahomoerotic.  We were hanging out in that room yakking and thinking we
were watching the time when we decided that it was getting close to two and
it was time to pick up Bobbie.  We walked back toward the coat check and
asked someone what time it was and he said "two-ten."

OH MY GOD!!!  She's gonna kill me!  I positively freaked.  I had been late
before and I had promised not to be late again.  It's worse when I'm out
partying and she's working too.  I asked my friend what to do and she said
to just run to the car and go get her and don't forget to come back.  I
raced into the rain, jumped into the car and screeched through the streets
of SF at 2:15 which was surreal given the contrast between my panic and
everyone else pouring out of the bars and staggering into the street.  It's
a wonder I didn't skid out and have an accident.  All I could do was hope
Bobbie hadn't taken a cab back to the east bay and that she wouldn't be too
mad.  One thing was for sure, she would be in no mood to go out after work
as we had planned!

To my complete surprise, she was standing on the curb with a friend
smiling.  Smiling!  Oh happy day!  She said that she had gotten off work
early and had spent the last hour at her friend's house and that she hadn't
been standing in the rain waiting for me all alone (talk about lucky
breaks!)  The really lucky part was that she had heard about a party at 340
Bryant.

We went back to "The Other New Years" and grabbed our friend and went to
340 Bryant.  I got a good feeling as soon as we found the location, at the
very end of Bryant practically under the Bay Bridge.  Water was cascading
off of the lower deck into the street and it was positively gothic!  The
location was superb.  This space was all partitioned and there were several
rooms.  One medium sized dance floor played raging techno and had lasers
(hooray, I love lasers).  Another had cushions and a bunch of toys in the
middle which we played with.  Another alternated between ambient  and dance
music.  The crowd was great and we met several people and saw some friends.
Hi Allen and holo at netcom!  Wasn't that a great party?  Happy New Year
everyone!

it turns out that the story i heard from police about why they shut down
the Other New Years Ball was false.

they did not shut it down for door admission. they shut it down because they
fucked up and everything at that party was in order so far as we can tell.

New Years Rave report
=====================

Well,   I started my NY partying kinda early,  and also was sorta fragmented
over the last few days.     Letrs atart off with Tribal Funk on Wed.

Tribal Funk report
==================

This Wed,   I get word that Tribal Funk is happening.   We call the info
line and learn that it starts EARLY.    I mean "super early".    We also
learn that if we arrive before 7:30,  we get in for $5,  so Radion and
a few Local Mill Valley kids all head into SF to a new (As yet unknown)
venue which turned out to be a band practive studio.   More on the venue
later.

We arrive just at 7:30,  was able to talk the person taking our money
to let us in for $5.    When we arrived,  there was about 150 people,
and Carlos was spinning.    They had a very nice chill area set up in
several rooms,   and the main dance area,    somewhat small,  with a
stage area where the DJ sits.

Carlos let loose some incredable music,   skillfully mixing in some
Double Dutch Bus and went right into Funkey Town...  WOW!!   incredable.
He also went insane scratching up a storm,  using the siren sounds,
speeding up and slowing it down,   causing some intense psychodelic 
audio imput that twisted my mind, body and soul.

Dj Utopia followed Carlos,   mixing in some good house variaty,  along
with some really trancey stuff.    Jeno finally got on,  and ripped the
place up BIG TIME.   WOW!! everyone was hooting and shouting to Jeno's
set.   It was totally insane!!!

The goon factor,  I'm sorry to say,  really spoiled the very good vibe,  
and it shut down early (2am) as usual,  due to our fascist laws about 
partying after 2 am.    The place was so filled with smoke that I had 
to take a double dose of anti-tobacco medication, which sorta spoiled 
my high.    Even Radion complained that he couldn't dance anymore because 
of the cigerette smoke,  and he isn't allergic like I am.     

Naturally,  security had the place closed tighter than a sealed box,
not letting in ANY fresh air until the front door ocassionally opened
as people were coming and leaving.    There were NO ins-and-outs allowed
of course.     I would say it was worse than 174 King St or the old
16th and Harrison Hayes Theator.

I say to all of you who plan on attending future parties there,  to please
let the venue managers know about the following concerns both for safety
and for comfort.

They need ...    a) Better ventilation or to ban smoking in the dance area
                 b) A few floor fans to circulate the air.
                 c) better and more reasonable security.

Other than the fucked venue,   I enjoyed myself,   but my throat and eyes
still ache to the point where I couldn't see the computer screen very easily
to do my work.

Most of Thursday and Friday,  thanx in part to the overdose of smoke,  it
has triggered my alergies to the point where my head was so congested that
I didn't think I would really enjoy INFINITY,  mostly in part because it
was held at same venue as Tribal Funk,  so I stayed in to recover and
try to get my congestion down to reaonable tolerances.   I wanted to be 
in top shape for New Years partying.   I spent a longer than normal time
for exercises, Yoga, Pagua and Thai chi..     WOW!!  I did 3 hours of it on
Thursday and it actually helped my congestion immensly,  on Friday,  I
recovered enough to visit the health club to learn they just installed
my favorite exercise machine (A Versa-Climber).   So,  after spending
1 extra hour in the health club,   I finally felt pretty good again
by Friday evening.   It's amazing what exercises can do for congestion.

On saturday afternoon,   I continued physically preparing myself for the
big NY Eves party,  pondering my choices for the evening.    These were...

Cool World - The Mega,  highly commercialized,  5 arena extravanganza
  that was surly guarenteed to be a total ZOO.   I had Comp tickets
  at Will call waiting for me,  but even getting in for free,  wasn't
  incentive enough to deal with the hassles of getting there,  and I
  didn't really want to drive,   because I wanted to get totally hosed
  that evening,  and driving wasn't on my activity list.
  
Wicked - I think the wet rainey weather was ONE of the reasons why I
  eliminated this choice,   but the DV8 (55 natoma) venue vibe can
  sometimes subtract from a good vibe.   ANd (of course the promoters
  greed)  $25 admission...  C'm on you guys,  GET REAL!!  I've heard
  frokm unconfirmed sources that on one side,   they were charging
  $35,  and $25 on the other side.    Sheesh!!  talk about inconsistancy.
  
The other New Years Ball - This one was one of the ones I had planned
  on visiting,   and even showed up before the party started to check out
  the venue.   WOW!!  It was really set up nicely.   So I planned to check
  it out sometime later.
  
Begain Again - Finally won out as the first party to attend.   Mostly in
  part,  because Dan Mapes (the venue owner) was a friend of mime,   and 
  they were going to have an internet connection to connect to the 
  International Cafe and man other spots all over the world.
  
Begin Again
-----------

It was strange...   Info line says to go to Mission Rock..  So we get there
and find nothing.    We meet other confused dedicated ravers and finally
meet up with someone who says this was a map point.

I had called for Dan Mapes earlier in the day,  and got word that it was
to be held at the Cyberlab 7 offices.   Later on that day,  one of the
people working there said the venue was changed to Mission Rock area.
I thought that it was because they were anticipating a larger crowd and
moved to a bigger space.   I also learned that people were then sent to 
yet another map point located at Komotion.

When I talked to the map point person,  I told him I was on the guest list
so he wispered in my ear....   340 Bryant,  and we were off.

We get there about a half hour early,  about 8 pm,  as they were setting up.
Thanks go to Frank and Craig and Denise for driving me around,   and romping 
from map point to map point.    Just about then,  the rain started....

Things started a tad late,   but soon the music was to start,  and after
the sound system finally got tuned up,  things were starting.    Naturally,
I was one of the first persons out on the dance floor,  warming up for
an intense amount of dancing,  schmoozing and plain pure partying.

Solar literally ripped it up with his acid trancey sounds,  soon there
was harly enough room to dance,   but I found a reaonably dry spot to 
dance in.   WOW!! the energy was totally insane,  almost like Friends
and Family.    The SFRave quotent was pretty high,   and it went on
all evening without any problems from the police.   Although it was hot
and humid on the dance floor,   I was able to find adequate places
to cool down.

Soon,  after 2 am,   people were coming in who had been to Cool World
and confirmed that it was more of a zoo than I had even imagined.   Huge
long lines in the rain,  and I even got word that the police shut down
a portion of the rave.     No confirmation on that,  though.

At about 3 am,  things at Begin Again were going so well that I didn't 
want to leave in the pouring rain and head over to The Other New Years
ball,  even though it was within walking distance.  I was having too
much fun at Cyberlab 7.    By the way,  the internet connection to
International Cafe never went off.

Finally at about 5 am,  the rain stopped,  and just as I was about to check 
out the "Ball",   I met someone who just came from there, and said that
it got shut down by the police.  Wicked ended at 4:30 (Fairly early).

So,  I was content,  fat dumb and happy to stay at Begin Again until the
very end,  happy as "pig in shit" dancing around like a lunetic.

At about 8 am,  the music in the main room stopped,   but the chill and
ambient was till going strong and the DJ was actually playing some good
dancable music.    There were a few die hards left dancing,  but then
when the dj put on some insanely fast Jungle,   I went totally beserk.
WOW!!  What a way to end a rave...   Firing it up to the very end....
Finally,  at about 9:15,   we leave,  as things were shutting down.

After that,  we ate a big breakfast at the Pork shop Cafe on 5th st,
and meet these dudes from LA.    I then went off with them,  introducing
then to our superb vibe,  and eventually make it over to another party
in the Haight.    We stayed there throughout the afternoon,  dancing to
acid Jazz (Welcome change),  then tried to make it over to Spundae...

When we got there,  things were pretty dead...  We head back to Haight
party at which time the DJ from London who had just brought back some
of the most hidious,  twisted jungle stuff I've herd yet....  and
continued dancing like a mad man...   Although no effort was made in
beat matching,   it offered me some breaks from dancing to schmooze and
do some yoga at the party.    Finally,  at about 1:30 am on Sunday,
my partying finally came to an end.    WOW!!  this morning I wake up,
feeling really loose,   not sore,  dispite the 12 hours of solid
dancing at Begin Again,  where the most time I spent OFF the dance
floor was about 20 minutes.   Even at 1:30 am on Sunday,  I was thinking
of trying to find some place open to do more dancing....   :-)

GREAT PARTY!!  Sorry for all those that missed it,  and had to deal 
with piggies and other hassles at the other parties.

Cheers - have a Great New Year...

Listen people, I don't want to bring anybody down here, but this is serious. 
You know what's gonna happen to those police officers for this wrongful
arrest?  Zippo.  Do you know what it cost us as a community?  A lot of
people paid to get in, a lot of money was spent setting it up, a few people
suffered a lot of grief.  None of this money will be returned to its
rightful owners.  Supposedly, this is the price we pay freedom.  Umm...what?
This doesn't make sense.

I'm not a government major, but I thought our system was based on checks and
balances.  Who keeps the police in check?  It's not like one of us can pull
them over for going 85 down a highway.  Who is making sure they're doing
their job.  Don't get me wrong, there a lot of honest, good-hearted, people
who dedicate their lives to protecting the public from those who will take
advantage of us.  But who protects us from the police who take advantage of
their authority?  When you're wrongfully arrested, you go to jail, have to
post your own bail, and have to pay for legal costs: this is money out of
your own pocket that you'll never see again, even if you're innocent.  This
just doesn't seem right.

I'm sorry if I'm bitching, but as a community, we're starting to gain some
strength here.  Let's remember to focus this energy in a positive direction
whenever possible.  Our government needs an overhaul of revolutionary
proportions.  This is not a matter of republican vs. democrat ideology. 
This country has changed a lot in 200+ years, unfortuneately, government has
not.  We can't expect change to come overnight, but we can start demanding
some answers.  Shouting at the police is only going to make them carry a
bigger stick.  Just do something when you can, and when you can't remember
what's important about life and being here on this planet right now.

Some people will pay for the rest of their lives for one mistake.  Police
have been given the right to not have to pay for their mistakes in most
instances.  Keep up the positive energy and I know something good will
happen soon.  Happy New Year to everyone!  Sorry for the darkness, but I'm
only doing it cause I don't want to see anyone else get hurt.  God, I *hate*
politics but I hate injustice more.  Take care.

vibrating at the speed of love

I've never been enamored by the whole New Year's Eve thing; i.e. allowing
some arbitrary date on a Roman Calender to tell me when it's time to party
hard.  And since most human automatons seem to like being told when it's
OK to feel good, most parties on New Year's Eve tend be, uh, New Year's Eve 
parties.  Anyway, I knew that if any party had a chance to be magical
on its own, it would the totally unhyped Pacific production.  Being aware
of the incredible DJ lineup, Janie & I were looking forward to enjoying a
straightforward basic underground warehouse event.

Well, this party was anything but "basic".  It was a rather incredible
setup.  We got there around 8pm to help with some of the sound 
equipment.  The space, Cyberlab7's big video production warehouse, was 
something from an urban technoshaman's vision.  A small army (including
many SFRavers) where still putting video equipment and a multitude of
imaginative decorations in place.  There were a bunch of interactive 
alters everywhere, computers, banners, hanging tubes, candles... too
much stuff to describe here.  The Cyberlab7 folks went nuts with the
opportunity to show off their video production talents.  There were a lot
of screens with some fantastic computer-manipulated projections and 
two very nice lazer setups.  The main chill area was huge, with mattresses
chairs and a dance area.  When we got there, Polliwog was already spinning
some nice dancey ethno-funk-hiphop stuff.  People were dancing there all
night in addition to the main dance room which never got too crowded, but
was almost always full and going off.

The vibe was pretty good for New Year's, much better than I had hoped for.  
Lot's of friendly exchanges, free hugs and candy offerings.  Sure, there
was a percentage of non-ravers who were just there to be out with their 
friends but it still felt like a rave to me.  Ceril started things off with
some trance.  Tracy really got things hopping at around 10:30.  Markie
Markie and then John Williams followed with some really nice sets, after 
which we took time out to recharge our batteries. 

The end of the party seemed especially moving: as Galen finished
up you could just sense the overwhelming emotion he and the rest of the
Pacific people were feeling.  This was a pinnacle for them, the cap to
a great year.  Mostly they just seemed so grateful for all the love and
good luck that seems to have come their way.  Needless to say that they
deserve every single bit of it.  And thanks also to Cyberlab7 who exposed
tons of expensive hardware to a party atmosphere for a celebration of
technology fun.

begin again was a very cloak and dagger affair, requiring stops at no less
than 2 map points to get tickets and location of the party.  several people
said they liked that part, even someone who didn't have a car but who got
a ride with some others who demonstrated true raver vibe...

since we were helping with the ambient room, though, we got to the party kindof
early to set up.  the spot was a warehouse in basically the heart of soma, i
guess, which was one reason for the extreme caution utilized by the promoters.
there were no lines outside and the doorguy was very nice but firm, making
sure nobody was hanging around outside to attract official attention.  and
there were ALOT of cop cars circulating that night.  BIG SIGH of relieve that
it didn't get busted!

eenyway, it was basically a three room setup, with one room in the middle filled
with computers, one room with the main systems and dance floor, and then the
ambient/chill space, which was carpeted.  we brought lots of doodads, toys,
paint, cushioning, a carpet, a fouton, etc. in hopes of achieving the afore-
mentioned "chill-so-deep-it-sucks-you-in-and-you-can't-get-out..." feeling.
one nice "trick" is to put a fouton on a frame and then cover the whole thing
with an enormous carpet, creating a mound effect.  also, there were lots of
video projectors and a largist middle room with a sand pit where people were
filling up with little clay figurines freshly molded from a bag of wet clay.

the neatest thing about this party, however, was the absolutely incredible
vibe...everyone was smiling and happy and completely INTO it.  i guess it's just
that people were feeling very proud to be part of this underground scene that
really DOES do better parties, have better music, and generally more CONTENT
than those big commercial parties.  (with some notable exceptiosn, of course!)

i'm really glad i got to be with the raving peoples newyears eve and celebrate
a chance to begin again.

seeya,

ann/thrax

This was a very special New Year's for me , my first one in SF.

This party was even more than I expected and I expected alot. To begin it 
might be appropriate to briefly discuss the genesis of this party since I 
was there from when we started to plan it until we began again. 

The actual planning and execution of the party took about 7 weeks which 
was not too much time but just enough to let everything fall in place.
The dynamics of how this party came to be is very special and is what 
made the actual party "magical".

I had been going to the Sunset parties since they started late last 
spring but I didn't get to know the Pacific guys (Galen,Solar,Cyril,Jason 
& Lorien) until the middle of September. We quickly became friends and 
started hanging out together. 

I met Dan Mapes at a party in the middle of October at the old Cyberlab 
studios. I had been referred to Dan from a friend at Matthew Fox's, 
Institute in Culture & Creation Spirituality where Dan was teaching a 
class on technology & ritual. The night after the first party I saw Dan & 
his wife Claudia at the Ambient Jungle party in GG Park and we talked for 
awhile and realized that we were both into throwing parties for similar 
reasons, community & ecstasy (not the drug per se).
 Somewhere around the time of the rave mass 
in late October I approached Dan about doing a party and he suggested we 
do a big New Year's party. This was a great idea and I suggested that 
Pacific come on board to help produce the event since they have been 
responsible for helping cultivate the deep underground SF vibe. I ran the 
idea by the Pacific guys , it was a match and we started working on details.

A diverse group of people who did not previosly know eachother came 
together to produce an amazingly powerful event. Initially we considered 
doing a completely above ground event with big money at the Fashion 
Center but decided against that after Dan and Claudia met with the police 
and they told them that we'd have to turn the lights on at 2AM and kick out 
everyone under 21. With that option eliminated we moved to plan B which 
we were more comfortable with which was to do an underground event. Of 
course we were worried about the police and that is why we had a double 
map point.

The two primary reasons why this party was such a success was because the 
producers are committed to a set of values that see raves and 
celebrations as more than just entertainment but as events that build 
community and foster healing and because the community that attended the 
event were co-producers of it.

I am proud that I was able to help bring forth such a beautiful party and 
am even more thankful for the deeply meaningful experiences of 
teamwork,cooperation and love that I shared with my co-producers. I will 
never forget making the last stop at the business office right at 
midnight with Galen and when he later in the morning said to me "that was a 
good bonding experience Ronan". Or when Cyril hugged me and said "peace 
brother". Or at the end of the party when Solar was leaving and I looked 
deep in his eyes and said "I love you". Dan, Claudia, Zoe and everyone 
else, what can I say? Thanx.

May we have many more such events. We can heal our communities and world 
through celebration and genuine love.

All the Best for '95,
Ronan

My TV happened to be on the USA (cable) channel when i turned it on
last night.... As the scan-lines bloomed forth from dormancy (like
cancerous buds of disinformation) a zoom-in on some cheezy rave flyers
on the wall emerged. For some reason, this caught my eye (ouch!) and I 
watched... (duped again!).

Turns out TV is yet again trying to induce a negative response to
raves, this time via some stupid "world premiere USA channel movie".
All I can say is that when it comes time for more stimulus/response of
this sort, Pavlov-Doggie-Dog ain't gonna roll over or play fetch...

The EXecutive Summary:

	* Evil, violent Irish guy in a leather jacket is running raves
	  in a club.
	* Apparently said Irish guy is the ringleader of a drug-dealing
	  group o thugs that both sell drugs and run raves.
	* Evil irish guy kills people and eventually gets apprehended.
	* Evil irish guy is framing the protagonist, a do-gooder law
	  professor doing a little "research" on his comely-blond
	  neighbor. Professor catches evil irish guy committing murder 
	  on video tape.
	* Framed professor escapes from police clutches to prove
	  he didn't do it; climactic denouement happens during a rave.
	* THe movie basically used raves as the "seedy underbelly" of the
	  story, attempting to lend atmosphere to an otherwise silly murder
	  mystery. Analysed any other way, the whole rave thing was a 
	  big "loose end" in the story.
	* The rave looked like a rave, except that a greater percentage
	  of the audience was showing more skin than you normally see
	  at raves.
	* There was a chill room, where drugs were being sold. X, Speed, etc.

1 dead corpse in dumpster, 1 strangulation,  1 fall-to-death-through-
club-slylights, 333 breasts, voyeur divorcee law-professor fu, 1
cliff-hanger from skylight of club,  head-butt-to-the-nose fu, motor
scooter chase, car chase,  Body-Double rip-off factor 57%. Niels-Bob
says don't check it out.

(PS: Sorry, I couldn't take any pictures of this and put it on the web
like I did with the 90210 "rave" page I advertiszed a while back ... I
happened to be doing major surgery on the Web Authoring application I'm
writing (wwweasel) and it just wasn't up for running right then...)

party #1

Lawyers and Scientists.  Lacking a tux I was severely underdressed.
Hot gossip on which local judges are sleeping with their law students. 

party #2

Small house party in the city.  Meeting point for large group of
friends who want to go dancing.  Dick Clark has still got the magic.
Visiting Londoners were confused by lighted ball.


party #3 (Wicked)

Took me almost an hour to cross town and get totally lost near
55 Natoma.  Arriving around 1:30 our large party reconvened in a
happy, indecisive, unfocused manner.  

Superstar Rave Sweethearts Ali and Tracy 
gave me the official word - " it's Bunk !! "

We began walking toward Begin Again.  I was a bit concerned about
bypassing the map point but Wicked looked absolutely hopeless.
I was definitely on the sober side of things and feeling
somewhat responsible to get us *somewhere* before 
anyone noticed that we weren't there yet.


party #4 (Pacific)

New Year's Eve Raver Angel smiled upon our joyous group 
and convinced the doorman to let us in without tickets - this
was close to 3 (we weren't moving too fast ...)  

After what felt like eons of running around I was actually
skeptical anything was happening at the party because it was
it was Sooo Quiet at the door.  Raver girl with lollipop
reassured me that there was dancing and music upstairs.

Turns out we found what had to be the best party in town. 

It was fantastic.  Tons of happy people.  Funky chill
dancing.  Harder techno trance room.  Computer lounge room.
Underwater sauna playdough room.  Rave market hallway.  
Free water and ice.  Donations for cups and fruit.

costumes/fashion - that made my knees weak (butterflys)
Satin Satin Satin, girls - skirts and suits with colors
The oversized Cartoon Eyelashes and pale eyes are also a 
personal fave.  Think Audrey Hepburn multiplied by a hundred ...
Mmmm, I am a jelly roll just thinking about it - Gorgeous!!

music - the funky chill room was really great although I was in
the mood for the louder room.  The techno trance end of things isn't
my favorite.  It is so aggressive (football bores me) anyway, this
didn't stop me from really getting into it.  I dug this one song
that had all these Loud Crashing sounds.  I woulda guessed it
was Ethan ... but I usually have no idea who spins when.

sweat - was all over the floor.  my friend, Erica, bit it in a most
comical manner - she just got swept away by the music and her legs
flew out from under her ... spectacular!

I set an early benchmark for unraverly behavior in 95
by cutting in front of 20 high people to use a porta-potty
(where is the fucking mayonaise)
Happy New Years to everyone
and apologies to those confused people 
trying to use the bathroom ...

Love ya,
Dave

Finding nostalgia a rather stale state of mind, I normally don't like to 
dwell on the past, but what the hell, 94 was a good year so I'll indulge
in the memories one last time... 
 
*  *  *
 
My Favorite Parties:
 
For a variety of reasons, I didn't go out as much in 94, especially in 
the 2nd half.  Janie and I also tended to shy away from the hot crowded 
indoor parties that lots of people love, so my list will have some glaring
ommisions to many of you.   
 
Jan 1 - Boogie Buffet - 1015 Folsom - This New Year's day party was the 
final climax of the 1993 Boogie Buffet weekly Sunday parties that had 
fueled a rather unique acid jazz/house scene over the previous year.  
Everybody was still nuts from the nite before, and things only got crazier.
Seems like ancient history now.
 
Feb 5  - The Gathering - Richmond Civic Auditorium - Not especially
spectacular - just a big, good, happy party with sound quality that
was amazing for such a big venue.  Tony, Jon Williams, Spun, & Josh
delivered great fresh-sounding sets for the occasion, along with a
separate sound system in the front, and a great chill room.
 
March 26 - Full Moon Rave - The final Bonny Doon FMR was the biggest, and
it took a while to settle down. Things were a little messy with a crowd
of about 3,000.  But from about 8:30am to 1:30pm, amazing sets by Markie &
Jeno took things to a higher plane for a totally tribal, tanscendental
experience by the ocean.  I will always remember Bonnie Doon Beach as the
most spiritual of rave sites that I have ever experienced.
 
May 28 - In The Light - Golden Gate Park - As the main organizer and
"promoter" of this party, this was a very fulfilling experience for me.  
Thanks to contributions from many SFRavers the party was a great success 
and the realization of a personal vision.   Bryce, Laura, and Markie 
DJed to a sun-drenched crowd that was kinda like F&F meets Wicked in public. 
 
July 2nd - Freedom - Livermore Race Track -  Sometimes I think that 
nothing beats a large happy outdoor no-hassle big sound party.  I will
always remember the finale with the 300 who remained, holding hands in 
a giant circle under the rising sun.  It was a goofy and sincerely special 
moment that we will never forget.
 
May thru October - Sunset - Berkely Marina - This party is what made the
year truly wonderful for us.  From the initial intimate 50 person get 
togethers, to the later semi-massives, we managed to go to almost all
of them.  5 months, almost every weekend -  Much Thanx to Galen & Pacific;
Sunset provided the vibe-glue in 94 that helped keep the scene on track.
 
December 31 - Begin Again - Cyberlab 7 - It was great to be a part of such
a well produced communal PLUR-meets-technology party - it felt like a
year's worth of good karma was watching over this one.
 
*  *  *
 
Favorite DJs of 1994 - I only considered DJs that I heard spin at least 3 
times during the year.  In no particular order, the DJs whose
spinning consistantly managed to take me into the highest orbit were:
Jeno, Markie, Tracy, Galen.
 
Favorite New DJ of 1994 - An Easy pick - Tracy.  Looking forward to hearing 
a lot more of her.  Runner-up: Solar.
 
*  *  *
 
1994 Chutzpah Achievement Award:
 
A confession: Weeks ago, I went early to Pacific's renegade "Down to Earth"
party and saw the police van arrive and a nearby security guard scowling
at the carloads of ravers who had started to show up.  Certain bust, I
thought, and home I went.  Oh yee of little faith!  As we now know, some 
smooth talking and palm greasing by the Pacific crew salvaged the evening,
and I ended up missing what was reported to be a great party.  Thinking 
back to the two Sunsets in the Presidio and their successful handling of 
the Berkeley Marina site, I should have realized that these guys had enough 
magic in their blood to make "Down to Earth" go off.  Then they top things 
by teaming with Cyberlab 7 for an undergound all ages party that went 
totally off while New Year's Eve parties throughout the city were getting 
shut down.  
 
In general, I really don't think Pacific had their shit together in '94
*that* much more than many of the other renegade sound systems around here.
But they seem to be plugged into some kind of positive karma, and they are
not afraid to keep putting it to the test.  In this scene, being in tune
to the forces around us and having the guts to follow one's intuition 
in the face of possible failure is what it takes to make great things 
happen.
 
*  *  *
 
Some General Observations:
 
While some people have dropped out, there's also been a large influx 
of new blood into the scene, and this fresh enthusiasm has really vitalized
things.  Less DJ worship, more vibe participation.  People are getting
back into sharing and smiling. We're starting to see a greater variety 
of DJs and a little more musical variety as well.  There are a lot of
renegade sound systems doing it out of love.  And we still have a handful 
of savy promoters who can consistantly throw larger quality parties as well.

Over the year, we've seen how it is possible for small grassroots promoters
with a community focus can build a following by throwing a series of
small undergrounds with little or no hype, and over the course of a year
rise up in the scene to become a powerful and positive force.  The most
obvious examples are Friends & Family, Tribal Funk, and Pacific.  Contrast
this with the failure of the Zippies (Megatripolis) who came into town 
with a loud splash, only to collapse under the weight of their own
pretensiousness.  Which was a shame, really, because I do think they had
some good ideas and a fresh zaniness to them.  Ideas and Hype, though, are 
no substitute for Heart.
 
We seem to finally be getting more environmentally aware.  And there's 
been *some* success working with local authorities, but plenty of nasty 
busts as well.  The few cases of violence against ravers were
very minor compared to the number of parties that went off without 
incident.  The same with chemicals..  People are still doing them of
course, but the number of accidents or freakouts remain astonishingly 
small -  as far as I can tell, anyway.  People seem to be looking out for 
and taking care of each other as raves continue to provide a supportive and 
safe setting for people to experience altered states of consciousness.
 
SFRaves also seems to be revitalized lately.  The occasional spat has not
detracted from the new enthusiasm and sense of fun here.  A lot of us are
going out and posting about our experiences.  This exchange of information
continues to help build our community.  And we're even getting to meet
each other and participate in some wonderfully successful events like
Friends & Family, New Moon, & Begin Again.
 
Hyperreal, our host computer, has been getting noticed in the World Wide 
Web universe.  I encourage everyone to try to get WWW access and explore
what hyperreal (and other sites) have to offer.  Our SFRaves vibe has 
gone global in a major way.
 
Janie & I want to thank to everyone for sharing and spreading positive 
energy in 94.  No longer a fad, it is clear that the rave/house culture is 
here to stay.  We look forward to being a part of it with you in 1995. :)

 Supposedly, this is the price we pay freedom.  Umm...what?
This doesn't make sense.
-------------

Don't get me wrong, there are lots of good things here in SF, but
as far as freedom and the police go, you're not free....  People
always get mad and don't want to talk about politics, but there it
is again, right in your face.  Sooner or later, if you want to change
things, you have to get up and do something.  Even doing something is
no guarantee, either, but it beats doing nothing with a bat...

There's a pretty big story on the bust in today's Chronicle on page
one of the "Bay Area" section called: Complaint Over Police Raid on
Aids Benefit.  30 people are filing charges with the Office of Citizen
Complaints in conjunction with the raid.  There's also a news 
conference planned at City Hall this week, and organizers plan to 
sue the city and lodge a protest befor the Police Commission and 
the Board of Supervisors.

CDC Soundsystem is currently putting together an event entitled AREA 51.
AREA 51, as you know, is a top secret base 125 miles north of Las Vegas,
NV. It is believed that several alien spacecraft are being held there.
In an effort to create the oddest and best event possible, we are now
searching for current data regarding UFO's and AREA 51. If anyone has
such information and would like to contribute to a truely interstellar
event please call 415-615-8559(cdc VM) with a detailed message.

We are also experimenting with the idea of live seminars about the 
formentioned subject. If you happen to know of someone with profes-
sional speaking skills and a solid knowledge of the facts, please 
direct them to us(CDC Sound System) at 415-615-8559. Leave us a way
to contact you to discuss potential payment of your services.

The party will be on Saturday, January 14th, 1995. The deadline for
reply is Thursday, January 12th.

Thank You for a  bit  of your precious time.

Good!   We should try and gather as many people as possible so we can
file a class action lawsuit against the police dept for this harrassment.

This might be our luckey break.

I snapped a bunch of GIF images of crop circles from some lamo TV show
on crop circles with a hilariously stupid sound-track...

The pix are on the web...
	http://buchu.eit.com:8888/dcs/documents/creative/crop-circle.html

This Area 51 stuff seems like a similar hoax, the secrecy behind
military "black ops" are a perfect breeding ground for conspiracies.
If anything I get a little annoyed at this because there are real and
important "conspiracies" that people should be paying more attention to
but are wasting their energies chasing this sci-fi stuff, e.g the
entombed experimental liquid sodium nuclear reactor (dormant since '68)
in Tenessee that nearly blew up last november (a single article on it
buried in the middle of the NYT mentioning they didn't know how they
were going to prevent this reactor from blowing in the future, that it
was too "hot" for  humans to be near, and that they were scrambling to
build custom robots to attempt to mediate the runaway nuclear
reaction... not a word on this in the papers ever since). (2) global
warming happening at an alarming rate, with recent findings showing
ocean levels rising much faster than expected and the behring glacier
sliding towards the ocean at an alarming rate because it is gliding on
a pillow of water....

But nobody in the news ever mentions this might be a problem -- don't
want to spoil an economic recovery with news that we'll face an
ecological armageddon unless we realize that striving for a strong,
energy-based economy is tantamount to ecological murder.

Nope. You shouldn't be thinking about stuff like this. Better to be
blissed out on extacy engaging in sci-fi fantasies about the
governments secret deals with aliens. 

But hey, I'll be happy to dance and shmooze at "Area 51" but don't
expect me to take all this UFO stuff w/o some humor and doubt. Hopefully,
the promoters won't go over the top on seriousness and just make this
event "fun" and "educational" ... I'm a proud owner of
"Eat Static's" 'Abduction' CD but I think it's just good music, and
interesting chill-room conversation, but that's about it...

--------------------------

Tell it like it is, brother.  It's way too scary to contemplate reality
so... uh... oh, well uh... what was that?

This thing with the police offers a chance to "get real" and find out
exactly what happens when you "come down".  Better to find out now, eh?

Yes, me too.  I'd be much more impressed if we all put our heads together

Today's Examiner reports that the Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control
suspended the liquor licenses of DV8 and The Oasis a the request of the
SFPD who claimed violence in SOMA was causing them to deploy a
disproportionate amount of officers to the area.

DV8 at least will reopen w/o alochol on Thur.

Ironically, the SFPD admit that problems have decreased in the past 6 months.

_____

I'm fairly ignorant of licensing laws here in SF, but would the lack of
alcohol sales permit them to allow 18 and up, or possibly all ages during
the term of the suspension? Or is it more than just alcohol availability
that determines age restrictions?

wowzers, what a new year as opposed to last year.  

last year, i was one of many that ended up at the dv8 hall of messiness 
and got home to find out i was feeling so crappy all night because i got 
a 103 fever that night.  

this year, the fever came a few days early.  but i thought i wouldn't be 
able to go out if i was too sick.  by new years eve i was borderline, 
held up by ecinacea, goldenseal, ganmaoling tablets, and curing pill.  
when the clock struck midnight i was spinning a private party at Ken's 
house (non-sfr).  I believe I spun till around 1:15 am.  Then I started 
to feel a little sick again, so i juiced up once again.  Then around 3:15 
I took my "e", remembering back to a time when I was sicker and had taken 
it and it got rid of the chills.  So I stayed up all night and danced and 
played some more records in the early morning and fell asleep. The next 
morning all of my cold symptoms were completely GONE!

I just found it rather amusing because I was sick so instead of resting I 
stayed up all night and somehow cured my cold.  I am beginning to suspect 
that ecstacy has some medicinal qualities.  

Has anyone else had this type of experience?

The first time I took e I had a cold, the very next day, my cold was gone.
In fact, this new years eve I was suffering from the sniffles too, and I
took e, the next day I was fine again. Personally, I doubt that e has cold
curing abilities, however, it is well known that sweating is a good way of
getting rid of colds (as long as one doesn't sweat in cold weather),
therefore, e allows a person to sweat much (especially when in a warm
environment such as at a crowded party) and get rid much of the cold.

Sincerely,

How bout this theory? MDMA is an amphetamine derevative. Now amphetamines 
have a tendancy to kill bugs(the biological kind.) So I find this result 
quite reasonable. However on the down side, amphetamines and *SIGH* even 
e will weaken the immune system over the long term.
I must admit though the idea of running to the drug store to get some E 
for that nasty cold is much more appealing than Sudafed.... :)

I went out New Year's with a stomach virus and a slight fever.  Took my E
and had shakes and chills till about 3:30 then felt fine.  Woke up the next
day feeling super.  I think the positive mental state that E puts you in has
more to do with helping your body heal itself than perhaps any ingredient in
E.  People having been using dance as a way to cure a fever for thousands of
years as well.

Subject: Begin Again from the Heart and Soul of a Newbie

Dear Sfraves HI and Happy Happy;

	Well my end of the year went with an unusual twist of fate. I had
a ticket to go to cool world; but i blew it off and went to begin again
instead. Why throw away $26; becuase it was worth it from my perspective
at least. I had $700 on me; these things happen sometimes; didn't know a
sole and the fuzz was out in force; i'm an x-easterner, not use to covert
traffic operations; pretty scarey; anyhow. Getting back to begin again no
pun intented; but I thought it was a great party. The sand mondala in the
old computer room was really cool; the computer room was really cool in
itself; were else can you go and be surrounded my sooo much grounding and
the alter was outta site; i felt a little linguring catholic remorse; 
like i should offer up a pray or something; it was quite inspiring. 
Personnal note lose all catholic guilt for 1995. So here I find myself at
this wonderful intimate party with a bunch of people I don't know; 
rolling my brains out; and I felt perfectly at home. Of course the
music was great; I do not know west coast dj enough to comment whether a
particular dj had a good or bad night; so I won't. I guess for me the 
most cosmic part was when I walked outside the building at about 8am to go 
and type this document for yous; Was that I realized it was New Year Day, 
1995 and that I had finally arrived here in san francisco. It was at that 
moment that this very different and strange place became home to me. 
Happy New Year Everyone it feels good to be home :)!!!!!!! Opps also my 
thanks to whomever put that wonderfull party together.

						Peace & Love
						brianv@liberty.com
						aka Brian Darkness

PS My other New Years Resolutions:

	1. To continue to fight all forms of opression were I find it.
	2. To find more time to hug the people I love; like; and even 
		more important; the people I don't. 
	3. Jettsion all excess emotional bagage and leave it were it 
		belongs it the past.
	4. To continue to increase my overall awareness about whats 
		really going on out there.

See ya on the bit stream!!!!!

Dear All;

	In my last transmission I forgot to tell you all what happened 
after I left Begin Again. Well I made my usual stop at the Happy Dougnut 
Place at the corner of 3rd and king. I was greeted there my a womyn who 
had to have the biggest smile I have ever seen. Bigger than the smileng 
sun from the Grateful Dead. She even jokingly ammitted to it eing placed 
there by cosmetic surgury; damm I wish I knew how to spell better; 
engineer are supposed to know and I use to be one.; anyhow. As i was 
leaveing she said have a good day "friend" to here this from a stranger 
in this day was the sweetest way to start off the new year. I feel good 
things will come to me in 1995; if thats any sign. Hopes that good things 
will come to you all!!!! A little less pain and sorrroe and a lot more 
love, understanding and tolerence.

yowza!  Thanks again to the avid readers (and writers!) of sfraves, for the
   recommendation on Begin Again, which just totally kicked:
 - amazing, phat tunes - _all_ the dj's I heard were just on.
 - how many rooms? something like 7-10, well connected... nice space.
   gorgeous decorations...
 - friendly food/drink bar, some munchies in the am... plenty o water...
 - very, very nice light show and video setup.  hats off!
 - amazing vibe.  Little paranoia baloney- lotsa do-your-own-thing...
   especially in the chill room... (although the chill room didn't have the
   tunes like some other parties have had :-(... but it _was_ in a machine
   room, which made up for it... very tempted to lift up one of the tiles...
   For the record, it was "only" 84 degrees in there, even though it felt
   much worse.

I only saw crunch there - sorry I missed the rest of you guys!  arrived at
   midnight, stayed til 6am... friend from out of town (newbie raver)
   totally flew with it.  Just "stunned for three rounds" on the whole
   scene.

peace and choice,
adam

Whatever it is, I think it is really interesting.  I know for a fact that 
the other herbal medicines, ganmaoling tablets, eccinacea, golden seal, 
and the chinese curing pill definitely helped me get better, too.  Also, 
staying warm.  And not drinking any alcohol.

Very true. As all of my friends had already bought (expensive) tickets to
your typical massive, I got dragged into doing the same, and missing what I
had told them was going to be a great party at Begin Again (I'm even sadder
now that I've read today's posts).

The line to get in was probably half a mile long, a dozen people wide, and
moving at snail pace. Fortunately I found old friends at the very front, and
probably saved us an hour. Another friend of mine was at the front when they
told everyone to get in single file around 11:30??. People started yelling
and rushed the security, after which they closed the doors. Great way to
generate a good vibe!  :(

I was able to salvage a pitiful night when I headed out of the shit music
room (they started playing that eeny-wheeny penis song, entertaining, but
hardly belonging at a good rave) and into the techno room. The music here
was actually really decent, and had a rather good vibe, until they ran into
technical problems. 

I missed Amy Starkey, who I met at the Gathering (wazup Amy! BTW Amy, I ran
into that girl who was REALLY happy last time, and her boyfriend
too. Needless to say, her eyes weren't as wide this time.)

Overall the party was ok, but definitely not $20 ok. That is by far the 1st
and LAST Cool World I will ever hit. I'll speak my mind a bit louder next
time and stick with the underground and (from what I hear) positive.


Luv ya SF

Since there are rather large monetary damages involved (loss of
investment, loss of potential income, loss of reputation, time,
etc.), the promoters could likely find a lawyer who would take the
case on spec.  A class-action suit against the police filed by
everyone who attended and got kicked out (filed by the same lawyer)
would also be possible.

If the party was truly 100% legal than the police dept. deserves to
get smacked around.  Indeed, the only way to prevent further abuses of
the sort is to bite them back -- otherwise they will continue to shut
down parties based on doubtful evidence, because they know there is no
consequence to them for doing so.

If I were the promoter and I was sure I had my house in order, I would 
get a few consultations from various law firms to see what I could do.

Well count me as a strong advocate of echinacea for boosting the immune 
system. I try to go natural whenever possible, except of course for the 
occasional forays into the realms of decadance and ecstacy...... :)

Hello.

I'm sending this to you because you are involved with a rave

subscribe.  Is it rave-net?
I'm sending you a little info and perhaps you have some 
ideas...
Thanks for your help.

The following is a copy of a letter to the editor of several 
local
papers regarding a brutal illegal police raid on an AIDS 
benefit 
party.  We understand that police cracked down on several 
parties
and raves New Years Eve, and we need your support in 
documenting
police brutality, hate crimes, and other abuses -- particularly
at the Visual Aid benefit held at 938 Harrison on New Years 
Eve.
Please call 415-267-6142 if you have any related information 
and tell anyone you know who attended it is critical to 
document
this immediately.


===============================================================

We were at a New Years Eve benefit for Visual Aid, a nonprofit
organization which gives art supplies to artists with AIDS, 
when
police suddenly shut down the event without explanation.  We 
had
just commented on what a wonderful event the night turned out 
to be
-- a celebration of diversity, community, and hope for 1995 in 
a
safe, alcohol-free environment -- when police stormed the 
building.

The organizers immediately turned off the music and announced 
that
the party was over.  After arresting the organizers, the police
moved in, pushing and shoving the crowd towards the door 
without
allowing people time to retrieve their belongings, causing a
panicked rush to the coat room and forcing HIV positive 
individuals
out into the rain.

We saw no resistance from any of the attendees, but we did 
witness
the police using unnecessary force in clear disregard of the 
law
and of our safety.  We saw a man asking an officer for his 
badge
number thrown to the floor onto his face.  A woman 
photographing
this incident was tackled by a group of officers, thrown 
against a
wall, and arrested.  Hundreds of people witnessed officers 
laughing
and jeering, making statements such as "I've never seen so many
freaks in my life" and "Let's clear these faggots out of here."

We are appalled and outraged by the conduct of the San 
Francisco
Police Department.  We do not believe the citizens of San 
Francisco
support wasting tax money on harassing private benefits.  The 
gay
community, for one, will not stand by while our people are
brutalized.

 COMPLAINT OVER POLICE RAID ON AIDS BENEFIT
by J.L. Pimsleur

     A group of 30 gay men and women said last night that they are 
filling charges with the Office of Citizen Complaints in connection with 
what they termed a "violent and totally unjustified" raid by San 
Francisco police on a private New Year's Eve party.

     Raymond Liberti, one of the organizers of the party, said that 
shortly after 4 a.m. Sunday, at least 40 police officers, wearing 
windbreakers that obsured their badges, "agressively invaded" a private, 
invitation-only benefit for an AIDS support group attended by about 500 
people.

     According to Liberti, no fees were charged to enter the party and no 
alcoholic beverages were served.  Donations for the fundraiser wer 
voluntary, he said.

     The police version the incident differed sharply from that of the 
party organizers.  Eleven people were arrested on a variety of charges, 
including narcotics possession, drunk and disorderly conduct, and 
resisting arrest, according to police.

     A police source said last night that Alcoholic Bererage Control Board 
agents were present at the event and that the raid took place because the 
ABC agents "had resaon to believe" alcohol was being served at te event, 
fees were bing charged and no permit had been granted for such a party.  
The source declined to elaborate on further police action at the event.

     The benefit, held in a warehouse at 938 Harrison Street, was a 
fund-raiser for Visual Aid, a nonprofit organization that helps artists 
with AIDS.

     Liberti said police burst in and ordered the party closed.

     "Within moements--and without offical public orders to 
disperse--many individuals were brutally hearded into police vans, while 
being subjected to a barrage of anti-homosexual remarks," Liberti said.

     He also said officers injured about a dozen people by punching, 
choking and using police batons on party-goers.  Liberti also said police 
confiscasted a cash register containing $600, the proceeds from the juice 
and soda sales, as well as thousands of dollars worth of stereo 
equiptment and personal property--without issuing any receipts.

     Oraganizers said the only reason the police knew of the event at al 
was because the group "followed all the correct procedures,": informed 
authoriites of the time and place of the event and asked if the party 
needed a permit.

     According to Liberti, the organizers were told they did not need a 
permit if they did not serve liquor and did not charge a door fee to get in.
     
     He and other events organizers said that in addition to filing the 
OCC complaint, the group intentds to voce its protest in a news 
conference at City Hall this week.  Group members also plan to sue the 
city and lodge a protest before the Police Commision and the Board of 
Supervisors.

     According to party oraganizers, the event wouldn up losing money, 
after factoring in the $10,000 it cost to bail out the 11 people who were 
arrested.

Viva Lost Wages! ( ie Las Vegas )

 My wife and I will be going to Las Vegas this weekend , starting 
Thursday afternoon. This is a combination of attending the Consumer
Electronics Show , my 40th birthday , and celebrating our first
wedding anniversary! ( We got married at the drive-up window of a
wedding chapel on Jan. 7th , 1994 ).

 Is there anyone here on SFRaves who can recommend any raves/clubs
in Las Vegas or the vicinity? Also , any good record stores?

Thanks! ( And good luck with the club hearings & legal actions )

Greetings, ravers!

As some of you know, Komotion (the location for the past 3 Friends and
Family parties, and scene of many other fine, community based music and
art events) is in the process of negotiations with various authorities
and organizations in an effort to continue doing the fine work they do
in their current space.

As many of you who attended the last event may have noticed (and this 
happened at the one before it, too), a *lot* of graffiti and general
thrashing are now on the walls.  Also, many of the events that are held
in the space cause wear and tear and cosmetic damage to the building's
interior and exterior.

Given upcoming visits by various members of various bureaucracies, and
in an effort to keep the place neat and clean, a series of work parties
are scheduled during this month at Komotion.  WE REALLY NEED YOU TO COME
DOWN AND HELP US MAINTAIN THE SPACE! 

On Saturday, January 7, and Saturday, January 14th, Komotion will be open
from 10AM to 4PM to clean up, paint, tidy up, and generally improve the
space. Also, on Sunday, January 22nd, there will be a clean up
party (the time is a little more vague).  Paint, cleaning supplies,
music, and friends will all be there to help restore the building to its
original luster.

Please, if *any* of you have *any* time during those days to help clean
up Komotion, and help us maintain this valuable community space that
has been such a gracious host to the SFRaves community, stop by and lend
your efforts.  Komotion is an entirely volunteer supported arts collective
that has been supporting the underground community in the Bay Area for
almost ten years.  They have opened their doors and hearts to support us
over the past year, and really need our help and support.  No scheduling
or contact on your part are needed, and any efforts on your part will
be appreciated. You will also be able to meet the other members of
Komotion, and other members of SFRaves.

Thank you for your support in the past...help us keep Komotion available
to us, and the rest of the underground community, for a long time to come.

Komotion is located at 2779 16th Street, at Folsom, in San Francisco.

Down here, about a year ago, there was an all ages 
(read mostly high school age attendees) 
club in a pretty bad part of town.  
While the club was going on the crime rate in the area dropped immensely
because of the amount of security that the club had in the area
around the club and the police had thanked them for this.
When the club stopped, parents and grandparents called up asking
that they open up again so that they're children and grandchildren
would have something to do besides roam the street.

Problem is that the club stopped becuase someone said they were serving
alcohol to minors. (There was no alcohol in the club when the
police came in to shut it down and there never had been any alcohol
being served behind a bar or anythign)

I don't really know what the point of this story is...
on the one hand, i think it's to say that even as a group of people
that likes to party all nite doing whatever else,
we can show that there can be a benefit in this by keepign kids
off the street and what not...

But on teh other hand, its when we do that that people seem 
to get even more upset and start lying and getting more abusive
of their power.

Big stories in both the Chron and Ex today.  Looks like this was a long-
planned crackdown on SOMA.  Interestingly, one of the Chron stories notes
that a SOMA *clubowner* tipped off the gendarmes to the Visual Aids event.
So we're back to that kind of backstabbing, it seems.  

All this makes Begin Again even more miraculous.  Nice going, y'all,
wish I'd been there instead of the Portland equivalent of "Cool World
Northwest."

Hmm... Interesting theory... However, even if MDMA can kill bugs, it
shouldn't be able to kill the cold virus. After all, virii can't be
destroyed through drugs... Unless I have forgotten my biology lessons...

On a similar note I caught a leader for "Hard Copy" or one of those
Docu-Trash shows. . .

They had a film clip from some nightclub complete with flashing lights
and dancing kids. . .  Voice-over says "This all night dance party is
a favorite of teenagers in Berlin. . .  Could Your Neighborhood be Next?
Are Your Children Safe?  Tune in . . ."

Oooh.  Scary.

Wowie Zowie!!!!!!! There's a yuletide expletive you probably didn't hear
during the holidays.  But, I need a BIG BRAND NEW Happy New Year adjective to
tell you about how much fun I had at...BEGIN AGAIN------

Now, I am particular to the Digital Media boyz.

  They're in part,  responsible for getting this once rapidly aging person's
butt a' gyratin' on the dance floor like a demented whirlin' dervish... (I
know some of you shield your eyes and turn away in horror and flee scrreaming
into the night!!!!) The very thought of over-forty flesh giggling about,
trying keep time to the thumpin' BPM's is enough to disturb any sensible
person.


We made some bigtime fun at BEGIN AGAIN. If you were there, you helped to
create it--a big THANK YOU to everyone!!! I'm finally gettin exactly what
Ethan means when he says, "We couldn't have done it without you!!!!" You knew
the moment you got there, "DIS MUS BE DA PLACZ"..........

 ...... cool, well-lit, separate environments you could drift in and out of
easily banks of.computers , walls alive and pulsating..with color and
motion....people lying all along the walls..a warm tremoulous humm of talking
and laughter-friendly faces looking up at you- AND

  --Friendly Guys at the Door.!!!!  Who were those guys? (When was the last
time someone at the door said "Hi!!!Welcome...have a great time"  I am sorry
I didn't acknowlege and tip those guys.( We should reward the good guys and
shun some of the underworld security trolls.....)  You could move easily from
environment to environment -through an oozing sea of schmooooozy smiley
faces.

 People were definately happy. We were all winning game show contests who
selected "the cool party behind curtain number 4...instead of the buckett of
shit behind door number 1)..............and no lovely parting gift to take
the stink away.....

 Lotz of Sfravers there. I walked in right into a big hug from Geoff W.-- Big
Howdies and hugs from all the other SFravERS who were

there........LeeJanieGregCINDYGregAnnTOddTODDDaveMarkTraciCrUnchAlleNethanM...
......
and all the you I'm talking to who waz there!!!!!!! My only regret is that
the raveFearless compadre Lane-O, the frabulous beaker boy Grad Vunderkid
from the uc Davis wing of the rave party...choose (.........drumroll
please............)

Curtain Number 3......and was not there "to assist me withal" in the
beheading of Father Time.

Where was Senior Brian--the huggy bear from the Sac attack squad?

It is my fondest wish that Ya'll "flamed mightily where ever your torch cast
its glowing beacon of light."........ (I mean,.... I hope you had a real good
time where ever you were)

I met Dan Mapes (Digital Media) two years ago when they worked out of these
funky collection of barns in Santa Cruz/Soquel. (..compare to the 340 Bryant
digs!!!!!!) 

My friend Forest, the slightly balding, jolly Scootish looking guy in the
polka-dot vest-the Walter "Grand Pappy" Brennen of Ravin'-invited me to see
their hippy dippy looking garage "offices".    Kinda dumpy lookin' sheds and
hovels,  peopled with computer dweeds in tye-dye.... .Hoping they could do
some consulting,  or training for my work on an Amiga-2000 video editing
station, as I began work on a video yearbook at the re-structured high school
where I work. Little did I know they had more to show me than 3-D modeling,
 graphic pix-mixing for psychedelic video effects. The obvious similarity
between certain video effects and various states of altered consciousness,
should have been my first "red flag," that I would soon be "tip-toeing
through the tulips" of my mind again. 

After they had boot me, bedazzled me, fantazmagorized me, and made computer
graphic linguini of my eyeballs--they invited me to attend a "party" where 
they would be doing a computer generated light and laser show -while a "Dj
will play records....... ("you mean like one of those MTV guys I hate"--I
asked ever so delicately and intelligently) .........But,... I
digress.........indulge me coz........

I like reading other personal vignettes which reveal how we were each
ensnared or kidnapped (at first, no doubt, unwillingly)--by friends intent on
dragging us down into the vice-ridden vinyl netherworlds.........

So. BEGIN AGAIN was one of my all-time best parties that I attended in my
short year and 9 months of revelling and raving. As an AIDS benefit, as a
Company committed to its community-as a Mixed-Age crowd--Every heart and Hand
there seemed to be pumpin'  in sinc, warm and open.   AND   (.........why was
everyone's hand sooooooo sweaty?)

 Great friends, Great dancers, Great costumes... and "music to make the
heavens open up and weep angelic tears........(I wish I had said that...) To
Pacific..and all Mad Music Minions (Dj's)--& crew--We give you the coveted,
."Kicked it"  award for outstanding Butt Thumpin music all night......(You
(deejays) danced the whole enchilada out of this dripping Amigo)

Thanks to all for making LAST year a Happy New Year--Let's have BEGIN AGAIN
and
F&FV set the standard for all parties in the upcoming year. My New Year's
resolution is to "Accept No Substitutues."---

" This is the real thing, the real thing..the real thing..the real
thing.......vocal sample ad infinitum...........................a jingle-bell
techno-Christmas Carol for the future.....or maybe I'll keep muttering 'Wowie
Zowie Wowie Zowie" to myself, everytime I think about that BEGIN AGAIN.

                                                             Joyfully Yours

Yes, however since amphetamines and MDMA have a dehydrating effect, I am 
sure they would do wonders for the sinuses and general congestion.

Does anybody know if the ambient jungle cruise has sold-out yet?  Is there
a way to buy tickets online? Better yet, what might be going on *after* the
cruise?;)  Any SF weekend happenings/suggestions will be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks-a-bunch,  Michael

RIBERA PLANS INQUIRY INTO PARTY RAID

Thaai Walker
     San Francisco Police Chief Anthony  Ribera said yesterday that his 
department will conduct an investigation into a New Year's party raid that 
critics have labeled a gay-bashing incident.

     The department's internal affairs unit will look into allegations 
that officers used excessive force and anti-gay epithets while closing 
down the party at 4 a.m. Sunday in the South of Market area, Ribera said.

     "If those allegations are found to be true, the department will take 
appropriate action," the chief said in a news conference.  "We will not 
tolerate that type of activity."

     Organizers of the event and party-goers, who say they plan to file a 
complaint with the Office of Citizen Complaints, claim that police 
punched people in the face, used choke holds, covered or refused to show 
badges, unlawfully searched and seized property, and made false arrests 
and unlawful detentions--in addition to subjecting several party-goers to 
ani-gay slurs.

     About 600 people attended the party, which organizers described as 
an invitation-only benefit for Visual Aid, a support group for artists 
living with AIDS.

    Eleven people, including some party organizers, were arrested in the 
raid and booked on charges that included narcotics possession, drunk and 
disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.
     
     The raid was "the biggest human rights outrage against queers and 
people with AIDS since the Castro Street Sweep in 1989," said gay rights 
activist Gerard Koshovich, who did not attend the party but was contacted 
by the organizers after the raid.

     In the 1989 sweep, officers were accused of using excessive force 
and hurling anti-gay slurs in a violent confrontation that grew out of a 
demonstration in the Castro district.  More than three dozen allegations 
of police misconduct were filed with the Office of Citizen Complaints, 
the city's police watchdog agency.  Several other people sued the 
department and the city because of the fracas.

     Yesterday, supervisors Angela Alioto, Terence Hallinan and Carole 
Migden called for a board hearing on the Sunday morning raid.

     "I am shocked by the many reports I have received from people who 
attended this event," Hallinan said. "I question why it was necessary for 
dozens of police officers to storm this private event."

     Police denied party-goers' claims that the gay community was 
targeted in the raid and said officers were simply closing down an 
unlawful party.

     "What concerns me is a perception that this was a police vs. gays 
issue--at this time, I don't believe it was," Ribera said.

     Southern Police Station Captain Michael Yalon, who headed the raid, 
said: "In closing this club we had no idea that this was a gay event.  
The closure of this illegal nightclub was not any different from any 
others we did that night or have done any other weekend."

     According to Yalon, about 40 police officers and state Alcohol and 
Beverage Control agents raided the party in a warehouse at 938 Harrison 
Street because the event  was held without proper police permits.  Yalon 
said organizers did not have alcohol, dancing or entertainment permits 
and did not have permission to hold an event that continued after 2 a.m.

     Police said they were told of the party Friday by fire department 
officials who learned of it through a South of Market nightclub owner.

     Yalon said Officer Dan O'Shea, who is in charge of issuing permitts to 
nightclubs, contacted the party organizers and told them they could not 
hold the party without the proper permits.

     But organizers contend O'Shea told them it would be all right to hold 
the party as long as liquor was not served and no entry fee was 
charged.  They said they abided by the rules.

     According to the police report, officers who raided the warehouse 
found "numerous bottles of beer and champagne," but did not confiscate 
the bottles.  The report also stated that offices observed "numerous acts 
of oral copulation," and sodomy talking place inside the warehouse.

-----------------------

And we all know how the shit hit the fan over that Castro street sweep,
right?  Correct, we *DO* know what happened; the people of San Francisco,
in a vain decision to spite Agnos, decided to elect the man apparently
responsible (along with his brother, so the story goes) for the Castro
street sweep as *MAYOR*.  So it's a big surprise that the police department
is acting up again, correct?  WRONG!!!!  Perhaps these facts need to be
made more popularly known...

lat,

I find this thread quite interesting. I had a somewhat similar 
experience. I had some blisters and I bit my tongue a little due to some 
medicinal side effects but I had had such an amazing experience when I 
woke up after some sleep my tongue was fine.

My friend Morgan calls a good rave or celeberation "Public Health". The 
benefical psychological effects of a good party definitely help the body. 
The mind and body are connceted! Though we in the West tend to forget this.

I hope these kind of insights can help us build ecstatic and healing

I'll send this today, hoping to keep the flames in the old year :)


We are looking for a person with expertise in (preferably more than) one of
the following fields: Windows, Unix, Mac, GUI, WWW and other Internet protocols
(did I covered almost everything in the SW world ? :) to help me to complete a
product related to the Internet (sorry, I cannot be more specific now).

It can be a part-time job, with the possibility to become full-time.

What do we offer:

* A nice office in the heart of the Silicon Valley :( :( :(
* A techno/rave-friendly ambient: 30% of the company (: me :) is rave-addicted,
	but with your help we'll be 50% :)
* Hopefully soon a fast Internet connection, to download tons of junk :( tired
	to browse the net at 14Kb ):
* The possibility to become rich and famous (: at least a bit richer and
	more known :)
* Some money, too :)

PLEEZE, PLEEZE, HELP ME, otherwise next year I will have no time
to go out and party :( :( :(

If U are interested, give me a call to one of the following number or send me
e-mail at raffs@netcom.com.


In the mean time I wish U ALL a 

	Very Happy Raving New Year full of Peace, Love and Great Parties.

-- Raffaele

I can confirm what exactly happened.  The Cow Palace really 
screwed over Cool World on Saturday, and they were highly 
understaffed.  People were getting angry about being out in the 
rain, so, to avoid any further troubles, Cool World opened the 
doors and let in close to 3,000 people for free to make up for 
the problem.  It wasn't a riot, but would have been if everyone 
hadn't gotten in.

Hello!

Okay, this sounds too cool to pass up...I'm pretty happy up here in
Seattle, but something >very< fun could lure me down to the bay. 

I'm a Mac/DOS/Un*x/X guy. I manage all of Seattle University's academic
and research computing facilities 'n' stuff. I'm in a hurry right now, but
please feel free to give me a call! I'll get my resume to you somehow
(it's on a PC's hard drive about 10 miles from here!)

BTW, I'm about a 50/50 split between technoid and deadhead, with a dash of
hippy flip thrown in for seasoning...

I haven't read all of my mail so I might have missed something anyone has
sent me, but I seem to have some stuff anyway.  Move! earns its name by
moving to Il Pirata this week (don't know if that's permanent), and a small
crowd (a large gathering?) grooved to some good sets from Spun and Garth.
Last night Come/Unity was packed, and seemed to achieve critical mass for
a small nuclear explosion :).  Friday, 1015 Folsom might be a good destination
again (if you can handle the usual Friday yuppies), or Hotbox as an 
unpretentious underground.  Saturday brings Mixmaster Morris to the San
Francisco Bay, check it out if you're an ambient musique fan...

someone shoudl tell him that when officers use terms like

Now... if they managed to see sexual activity going on
and didnt figure out that it was a gay event... well... ummm...
what? a lot of drag queens who looked more like transvestites???

i dunno.. i just love it when the newspapers lay out quotes
that are contradictory.. of course its not necesarily what
the cops said, but hey.. :)

Actually i think the most important thing is that they 
"found numerous bottles" but didn't confiscate them...

It sounds a LOT like the Grave Rave bust where the only
alcohol found was in a mailbox outside the warehouse...

all this and newt's inauguration.. looks to be such a fun year

I have had many reports on the COOL WORLD debacle/rave and I have always 
tried to stay supportive of cool world (except for the cheezy flyers 
which I have always hated). I was given two tickets and decided to visit 
cool world since I give out so much advice at ameba as to which rave to 
go to. I went paid my six bucks parking at 11:20 pm and found a line far 
bigger than anything I had ever seen except maybe the gay parade. It was 
raining. They were raising and lowering a board as groups of fifty 
scuried to get searched. The line looked like a few hours wait. I could 
not get in because I did not have a line pass. Thanx for the tickets ,I 
gave them away.

Many people at cool world who arrived before 10pm got in and some had a 
pretty good time. One person described how they went inside the ticketing 
area to buy tickets and the gates closed and they were trapped. the 
security told them that they were rioting outside and they would have to 
wait.
All those people in line had tickets. Cops making arrests and asking 
people to stop flashing colors.

Some have said cool world got nervous as sales of tickets were smalla 
couple days before the event so they let go of a large amount of security 
personel. ticket sales on the last day went up and replacements could not 
be found. Perhaps one could argue cow palace bad/cool world good . I have 
heard the cool world takes pride in providing all ages large raves.

I think tthe cool world flyers promis sex to adolescent males and are 
targeting them in the same way that Rambo movies target adolescent males.
I think they gamble more than they should with the well being of the 
hords they attract.

I remember taking a class on comedy and we talked at great length about
the power of laughter and humour.  Remember the terms, "He is in ill-
humour," etc?  Or someone can feel "Out of humour"...of course,
in the old days the humours referred to the liquids in the body, blood,
water, sweat (and some others, but you get the idea -- i think these 
are the right ones)--if you got out of humour, you had an imbalance in
your system, and they tried to bleed it out of you. 
It has been shown that people feel better after a good laugh--good humour--
which involves good, positive energy, like the kind you discover at a
truly good party.  You body takes in this energy, this humour, and cleanses
itself with it.  It's truly cool.  My teacher worked with criticaly ill
AIDS patients, using humour therapy to get them through their last days,
"before they got invited to the other side."

So I believe any healing people are getting is the mixture of the e letting
you free your humours and the vibe of a really good party...

just my $.02..

have a good weekend!

m

(and keep in good humour!)

EVERYTHING I said negative about cool world could apply to many of the 
big raves i attended in the "good old days"

I think this is one of the reasons many of the more level headed 
dissmissed raving as a pain in the ass fad.

everytime a promoter comps me the people at the door laugh in my face.
MY NEW YEARS PLEDGE IS TO BECOME totally biased AND TELL IT AS I SEE IT
every time someone calls or walks into ameba looking for rave action.
NO MORE SECOND CHANCES!!!!!

(ACTUALLY IVE HELPED PUT ON MORE THAN ONE shitty rave :)

I heard he security guards ditched their posts as he crowd became more
irate and started to scuffle. (This from a friend nearly suffocated by the
onslaught of gate crashers)

Any truth to the rumour of thousands being turned away and refunds having
to be issued?

He is referring to the Grateful Dead.

How is this connected to raves?  (besides the fact that a certain number of
ravers
like them)...

There used to be (about 30 years ago), these all-night underground dance parties
called the Acid Tests.  The Grateful Dead got their start playing for these.
They're still playing....

Excuse me for getting cranky and stuck in gender issues, but i still 
wanna know why house/dance/ambient etc. djs are almost all men!!??

This is part of why i dropped out of your scene with its 
egalitarian/utopian aims (or hollow pretensions?).
Someone please tell me i'm wrong, that there's plenty of female or 
transgender djs out there...or that Your Sister's House is still active.

Are the dancers and partyersapprox half women- if not, why aren't they on 
the decks?  The finest djs just happen to be men, is that it? (Or is the 
whole electro culture thing mostly appealing to men? If so then i'll shut 
up and things might make sense.)
I haven't been out since March, so i'm out of it- please tell me if i'm 
way off!!  

Claiming to be healers (and many of you) Gaia-centric, or amorphous 
androgynous and ecstatic and the whole wonderful, loopy story, i still 
think you're controlled, or at least lead, by men.
Am i wrong to point fingers- dj opportunities have been wide open for 
women, they just haven't come forward?..i'm getting redundant now, but i 
just wonder what the real reasons are, if they're determinable, and if 
anything is wrong or not.   ??????????
I have waited, for years and years, for things to change and they haven't
(and if this is old news on the list, forgive me, i've never subscribed 
regularly)

I do not understand how the cow palace could have 
screwed over cool world ?? doesn't the promoter 
hire the security ?? you are correct they were 
very understaffed.  being new years there should have been 
alot more security searching people to let them in 
quicker.  also the guys in the yellow jackets "event staff"
were very, very and I repeat very unfriendly, they were 
shoving people yelling at them and slamming the doors on 
them.  the reason people stormed the doors is there were 
only two doors opened.  no direction as towhat was happening.
over 3,000 people in line past 12:00.  happy new year spent standing in 
the rain.  

another thing I think cool world bowed down to greed and 
the mighty buck $$$$$$$.  what happened to the doors opening 
at 9:00 pm ???
cool worl did not let 3,000 people in for free everyone in 
line were ticket holders and at an outrageous $30.00 (greed-greed)
what fantastic thing did cool world have that warranteed 
a $30. admission.  please don't try to pass off that klf was there
we already read about that, it was only the back up singer wanda dee.
cool world capitalized on the evening.

but they were not the only one.   I am happy to see that dv8 lost
their license for 3 weeks.  maybe they will lose all the money the
unrightfully charged on new years.  $35.00 to stand in line for 3 hours
only to make it inside another cattle-like holding area.  which was better 
than making it inside to the death trap.  several friends of mine made
it inside.  once inside could not even get a drink, hot, smokey no 
ventilation people were crammed together miserable and angery.
the staff there were also very rude.

I think both promotors lost sight of what these parties were to 
be about.  bringing in the new year with family and friends 
getting together with fellow ravers and having a great time.
I agree they should make money at this,  it does take time and alot 
of effort to pull together.  but they should not only see the $$$$
to the point were people lives are endangered, the fun is taken out
of it.  those ticket prices are too outrageous.  

it seems to me that friends and family is the way to go... 
I still have not been to one but that is my new years resolution
to avoid commercialized money hungry raves and only go to those 
that truly care about everyone having a great time and not taking 
away hard earned money.
  
well, now that that is off my chest.... on with another year 
its all behind me now.  move forward, shifting gears, putting 
on a happy face and attitude on life.

grins and smiles......

I'd have to agree that there aren't that many female DJs out there, but I
think (correct me if I'm wrong, I'm a commuter SFRaver and LARaver) that
there were two new female DJs this year, Tracy and someone else (sorry I
forgot your name!).

But yeah, it does seem like most DJs are men. Don't want to get too
political or sociological here, but I think that's just generally
representative of your typical gender power structure. It does kinda suck,
but I think we should be positive here and completely support all the womyn
DJs out there, and all aspiring ones too. Things *are* changing (slowly).

But hey! We also have one of the best scenes anywhere, and a lot of that can
be contributed to the kick-ass DJs that give their time and energy to our
parties. A lot of them are male, some are female, but I think we can all
agree that without them, we wouldn't be much. 

Positive Vibe Always

Jason

about cool world and DV8:
--------------------------
I think both promotors lost sight of what these parties were to
be about.
--------------------------

I think that a number of promoters have had similar vision problems,
perhaps it's that "vision thing" George Bush referred to long ago...

I also think that there is an outside influence in the form of police,
club and bar owners and possibly even parents that are going to extremes
to attempt to control this scene.  The fact that the clubs seem to be the
only places exempt from harassment speaks volumes.  Once again it seems
that we need to make some changes at city hall... anyone else have this
feeling?

Although it looks like it is going to be pretty stormy tomorrow
evening, the ambient jungle cruise is still on (9:15-2:30AM)... I just
bought my ticket today and it looks like there's a small stack of tix
still remaining as of 4PM Fryday afternoon -- I'd estimate between
30-50 tickets (out of 200) left...

I hope they have enough "indoors" space at this party...

Well, I've noticed that if the music is more on the techno
side of things then there are usually more guys dancing - often younger
guys.  I see greater diversity when the music is house, hiphop, or acid
jazz.  So maybe that is part of what you are talking about ...

Brian- thanks for posting my message! Please disregard the more bitter 
later post, if it went through. I didn't realize there would be weirdness 
with mercur/my address.

Thanks for the responses, but if i sounded bitter, well, uh, i still am!
Boys with toys, hmmm...yes at least big happy ones in this scene.

I guess the more i look for egalitarianism- not yet even in this 
generation-  the more disenchanted i get...but the dance scene isn't the 
only one, i suppose i should get involved in others that are more 
egalitarian in control if it makes me so mental.
House/disco has been way removed from its roots, oh well, okay boys, hope 
you suceed in your diversity/unity cultural ecstasy thing...or more 
appropriately, thanks for what you've done already!

Now I know that I'm replying to this all a little bit to late, but I
thought I might put in my $.02 here about Tribal Funk's Wed. party "last
year in December" (yow-ee that sounds long ago!).

I too attended the party, and while the space was fairly stuffy, damn smoky
<cough, cough>, and the temperature did get up in the low 80's, I have to
admit I undenyably had a wonderful, awesome time that night!

It was amazing to walk into a room, either the ambient room or the main
dance floor, to suddenly be surrounded from all sides, everywhere I look,
wall to wall friends, friends, and more friends.  These were people ranging
from those I had only "seen around" at parties, to those that I had met and
gotten to know a little better on several occassions before, to those whom
I have been building relationships with from all the way back to my early
days of raving, which would be about 10 months now!

It felt as though I knew almost every person there.  There were a few faces
that I didn't recognize from anywhere, but to make up for it I saw a few
people I didn't expect to ever see again, including someone that I used to
go to Junior High School with many years ago.  The last time I remember
having spoken with him was in 8th grade -- and here I meet him for the
first time in years.  It turns out he has been going to rave parties for
about 2 years now, so it was a real trip to exchange stories right there,
comfortable as a clam on that couch I was, dazing off into those very
brilliantly set up Intelli-beam lights (pun intended) on one end of the
room.  Absolutely amazing shit.


Now the music... I was only on the dance floor about half of the night, but
when I was there, the music was nothing short of pretty darn good.

Notably (only in my brain), I noticed that Carlos FINALLY changed his set a
little bit.  And it was truly a real treat to hear a very cabably-mixed,
dancable, upbeat trance set by visiting DJ Trance (LA).

I think Carlos is a good DJ with strong mixing skills and the ability to
choose songs that he feels will "pump up" the crowd.  His energy is just
awesome -- its so cool to see that little guy up there dancing at the
turntables, throwing out a few vocal "Ehy!  Ehy!  Ehy!" hoots in good time
to the music.  While Carlos is a pretty darn good DJ, I feel that the last
several months have not been his best as far as being original in his
choice of songs to play.  It just seems that my experience has been that I
end up telling myself "these songs are from the same set Carlos ALWAYS
plays from".

However, last Wednesday, unless it was just my tweaked perception, I
thought Carlos went <Ka-BOOM> and took off into a wonderful new set full of
cool new songs that still fit his style, and brilliant new mixes I don't
think I had ever heard before.  Furthermore, when it comes to scratching,
Carlos usually seems to favor the more "<wik wikky-wikky, wik-wik wik-wik
wikky>" type scratching performance.  Almost "rappy scratching", if you
know what I mean.  While this kind of scratching takes a lot of skill and
good rhythm, I think it got a little old for my tastes after hearing it a
lot from Carlos time and time again.  At Wed's Tribal Funk, again, Carlos
went <Ka-BOOM>, this time scratching bass kicks as an additional baseline
in such a manner that follows the song a little better, and also a bit less
of a crowd spectacle.

DJ Trance from Los Angeles was in town, originally to play at a friend's
small invitation-only party.  When the space fell through after the party
had already been planned, party planner got together with Tribal Funk and
<poof>, we have a party with DJ Trance, cool lighting, and a lot of other
great DJ's!

Zzzso!  DJ Trance also played a really killer set.  His style ranges from
what seems to be really electronic trace, to upbeat "happy" trace, to
breakbeat trance.  Everything I heard was especially well mixed, and he
thoughtfully mixed in a song containing a mellow "cool down" segments
without a bass or kick.

After the party, I ran into DJ Trance and had a chance to meet him and
communicate how much I enjoyed his set.  He was very modest, and really
appreciative of my compliments.  He did not seem to have any of the
attitude that would lead on that he thought or knew he was good.  Instead,
he just shook my hand and asked me if I'd like a copy of his tape.  He dug
through his pocket and found his last copy -- boy did I get lucky!  I must
tell you this tape is a REAL TREAT.  An added bonus- it was free!  (If
anyone is interested, there is a phone number in LA on the tape that you
can call if you are interested in finding a copy -- email me if you'd like
it.)

Hollywood Dog was zappin' his big lasers all over the main room, and it
seemed SO much more personal than the last time I remember seeing his good
work at the Tribal Funk anniversary massive at the Cow Palace.

The security guys were definately a little on the goonier side, but they
weren't so bad to me.  One look at my friend  Roland the Lion  and one of
the door guys broke out in laughter.  The next instant he kidnapped Roland
(sort of with my permission, but definately with my blessings) to show the
Lion's cute big brown eyes to one of Mr. Security's female squeezes, just
inside the door.  After Roland returned, still as happy as ever, the other
security dude waved me in, not even bothering to search me or the rest of
my large bag of florescent slinkies, squishy toys, beeping buddies, or
other psychedelic toy/insanities.  I guess they got the clue that I'm not
particularly interested in carrying weapons with me!

While they security guys were reportedly not allowing any ins-n-outs, for
those like Cap'n Crunch who NEED to get out of that stuffy, smoky
environment to get some fresh air, they were making special exceptions for
people who did a little talking.  At least this controls the numbers that
can be seen standing around the door outside, visible from the street.  I
think fans are a definate need at this location if it be planned again.

Does anyone know how the Infinity party last Friday went, and if it did (as
rumor has it) take place at the same location?  Did anyone go to this or
was everyone too tired?   :)

Just my $.02.

P.S.  The energy on the dancefloor was pretty excellent from MY
perceptatory standpoint.  But I have to admit I was probably dancing less
than half of the party's duration -- too many friends to catch up with!!

Take it easy

Yeah, parts of the hunter-gatherer in all of us show up in every social 
setting I guess.... I'd submit its presence is much lower at raves than 
other types of parties.

I think the problem is reffering to a dj as a *girl dj* instead of just
another dj. Unfortunatly I think in most situations dj's get hired for the
wrong reason (who they know/are) and alot of the time girl dj's (dont) get
hired because of their gender instead of their skill which is all that
should matter in *any* case.

Jai Uttal's psyche-Delhi light show

By Cary Darling

Orange County Register

THROWING a rave is hardly news these days, especially in the Bay Area, where
the rave culture has found a
suitably psychedelic home. But for San Francisco's Jai Uttal, rave means
something other than just the
whirlwind rush of techno music and the quench of smart drinks.

The rest is on...

THC will be Saturday not tonight as listed on the calendar.  Any word on how
the last one went?  "Masjestic" sounds pretty good too, but nothing massive
this weekend.

Dear Josh;

they are women. And if you what to be really pc it should be spelled 
womyn or womin. Just tring to add to the enlitenment no offense ment not

Dear Michel;

	I have no better advice than be good to the body; that takes you 
were you want to go everyday; and allows you to experience life in all 
its different forms. Drugs in general mixed together can have anywhere 
from eurphoric to deadly results ie acid and x or valium and alcohol 
respectively. The best and first ? is and should be for all of us is it 
worth the risk. I'm a firm believer than in referenec to the big picture 
we are only here for and instant; and than life should not be lived in 
fear of dying. For me experience is everything; its why we were put here; 
but only you can make that discision for yourself. Good luck; have a 
great time; but try and minize the total number of substances that you 
have in you body and any given time. Also; at first do things in small 
qualites and see how it feels; there always time to do more and more. 
This is what herion addicts call chipping; its a way to see how good the 
dope is without overdozing and possibly dying. Because from my personal 
experience if something bad happeneds to you; the doctors in the 
hospital; in their high and mitely way will not have any symathy for you. 
To them you are just and evil drug user who deserves what he or she gets; 
and i speak from experience. Its sad; but they just don't get it. Good 
luck. Just one more thing; I remember a friend of mine who in a matter of 
hours ate 10 waffers; smoked a whole bunch of kide bug; took a lot of 
special k thats catamean and dropped a bunch of lsd and wondered why he 
didn't feel very good???? You decide. To the best of my knowledge he did 
recover fully after a few days of not being able to walk correctly; see 
and do other things. But he sure was scared to death; like please let me 
off the train know. something to think about?

I called the number last night, but they said it was canceled, and that they
wouldn't be having any other parties for some time due to the weather. But
that was last night. Has anyone else called recently?

Though certain aspects of raves are certainly liberatory and challenging 
to the status quo it is unrealistic to believe that it is some ideal 
peace and love scenario. The rave scene is inextricably embedded within 
the wider cultural milieu and thus is deeply affected by the negative 
aspects of partriarchy and gender politics.

I would guuess that there are more male dj's than female dj's but there 
are plenty of good woman dj's around. The Begin Again new years party had 
4 woman dj's play. Pollywog,Charlotte,Tracey & Bonnie. The organizers did 
feel it important to have a percentage of female dj's.

Many aspects of our postmodern landscape are in desperate need of a 
rebalancing of gender engergies. Hopefully the rave scene can help break 
down some barriers to communication and foster healing & transformation.

peace,
ronan

Now Thomas, I know you are new the list as of late, but you'll be happy to
know we have a lot of wonderful, truly talented women DJ's in our little
scene here.  Your Sister's House is still around (Hi MAUI!!!!! and Susan
and All!), and can even be reached at "ysh@netcom.com" if I remember
correctly.

On the other hand, we do NOT have enough of these wonderful women -- we can
always use more!  You are right; the scene is flooded by a majority of men,
but we could theorize for weeks in threads on just the contributing factors
to why and how this is true.  The reasons are not easily itemized or easily
singled out as one being more significant than other.  Like I said, we
could dedicate a thread alone to the reasons.

I'm just happy that we have the excellent talent and energy that the Bay
Area's women DJ's have to offer, and if you'll notice in Lee Fogel's recent
post regarding his opinion of Tracy (see above), he'll agree that Tracy is
one such example of an excellent female DJ that can TRULY schred it up!

A really nice job at Pacific's Begin Again New Year's party, Tracy.

REEEEEEALLY good stuff!  And that hair!  Wowww-ee, all those little braids
are soo cool!  And I don't think I've ever given a more satisfying hug to a
DJ after a truly incredible set than I did give to Tracy after her set just
before midnight New Year's Eve!  Yowsers!  Recalling all that positive
energy makes me SOOOPER-giddy again!

Hope everyone had, OVERALL, a totally UNREAL (that's a positive thing) 1994!

Love,
Todd

If anyone needs a copy of that article, I successfully retrieved it a

I don't know who is crazier: the people who charge those outrageous 
prices, or the people who PAY those outrageous prices.  If people don't 
go to the events that are priced so highly, parties wouldn't cost so 
much.  The reason promoters charge so much money is that they know some 
people will pay theitheir price.  The most I will EVER pay for a rave is 
$20.  With that money, I certainly expect a laser show or something - 
like the Gathering last month.....worth every dollar!

I couldn't have said that better myself!

Alright alright-

        I can't get this song out of my head. Who does the song "the Witch Dr."

It's probably old news but I'm just out of it. Please, any input would be
great.

Thanks in advance

The THC party is supposed to happen tonight - there message
the other day was confusing after seeing the email notice.
Free and in the city.

There is an afterhours hiphop party at the Troc tonight
that might be fun  - prepare to be slinky ...

Speaking of the Troc, where is the 'old Troc'? - cuz there is
supposed to be a Saturday afternoon (I think) "afterparty"
today (Jan 7) - Did this also happen last Sunday or am 
I confusing different places??  Fill me in!

I went to zendada last night.  J Howard and Taj were
both really good and the upstairs was goin late also.  Lotsa 
people there - very clubby - very house - I had a blast.

That's gonna be a weird weekend...  There's a Billboard Dance conference 
or some such that's gonna have tons of mucus industry slime hanging out.  
There's at least three big parties Friday, including one advertising 
Gabber?!?!?!?  (415-337-4236) Guess where I'll be...  It might be a pretty 
good weekend, if there are music people who believe in the scene and not 
fast buck artists looking for the next big thing. Probably both. A better 
time for checking out new sounds than for getting into the vibe, perhaps...

Can any insiders share some perspective on the upcoming showbiz onslaught?

well, i'm nont  sure what yoou consider mucus industry slime (i'm trying to
figure out if i am included in that category), but it sounds to me like a lot
of the small dance labels will be represented here - there's no new music
seminar this year as far as i've heard so thiss may end up being the cool
place this year for dance music - but then again, it IS biillboard so it
won't exactly be aimed away from commerciality...

i really don't know, but i'm going to check it out.

Chronicle JAN. 8 SUNDAY MORNING

A small craft designed for touring the San Francisco Bay region capable 
of carrying up to 250 passengers is still missing according to Coast 
Guard officials. The S.S. Pomme Fritz was chartered by a local group for 
a floating dance party concert. The luckless vessel launched during a 
lull in last nights storm at about 8pm pacific standard time. Gail force 
winds soon buffetted the craft at 50+ m.p.h.. An S.O.S. was received at 
10:34 pm last night but was muffelled by whale like chirpings and deep 
drones caused by unknown sources. It has been speculated that the Captain 
of the vessel had been under the influence of a popular drug used at 
dance party concerts called "ecstacy" and may have grounded the ship in 
S.F. bay's infamous "Potato Patch", a raised bit of the oceans bottom 
near the mouth of the bay. Supporting this speculation is the report from 
the coast of the north bay where a jacket made of holographic foil was 
found intact miraculously, a tribute to the unknown manufacturers durable 
yet fashionable dance party concert attire.

I wouldn't worry Jason, the reference to holographic clothing suggests

Looking for something fun and interesting to do before a night of raving on
Saturday, January 14th?  How about a few rounds of laser tag in a black lit
maze with techno music playing in the background?

Q-ZAR is a game of laser tag played wearing a florescent vest and wielding a
gun. A group of up to 20 people are divided into two teams and are lead into
a maze.  The objective is to tag the players of the opposing team with the
laser beam emited from the gun while avoiding being tagged by their guns.
When a player is tagged with a laser beam, sie is temporarily disarmed and
loses one defense unit. After loosing four units, the player needs to return
to an energizer near hir home base to get more.  Points are awarded for each
opposing player hit and substracted for each defense unit lost.  Points are
also awarded when the home base sensor is tagged (no easy task). The game
play is surprisingly easy, safe, and nonconfrontational.  Targeting is easy
because you get visual feedback from the laser and the gun talks to your
constantly to give you help. There are referees that enforce rules against
running, climbing, physical contact and bad attitude.  As for music, the
maze features an excellent sound system and they will play any CD with
non-explicit lyrics.  They've had no problem with playing my trance and
hardcore CDs and there are no rules against dancing.

Cost: 7$ a game, or $15 for 3 games and 3 sodas.  Typically 3 games will
      fill the entire night up.

When: Saturday, Janurary 14th, 6pm to 10pm

Where: Q-ZAR is located in Ronert Park, Sonoma County, CA, an hour drive
       from SF.  Specifically, take the 101 north to Ronert Park Expressway
       exit, make a left (east) to Commerce Blvd and turn right.  Go to the
       next signal which is Hunter Drive.  Go past Hunter Drive and the next
       driveway on the right is Q-ZAR.  The address is 6591 Commerce Blvd.
       Q-Zar's voice mail number is (707)588-8100.

       People are welcome to gather at my house just off the 101 in San
       Rafael, Marin County prior to my leaving for Q-Zar at 5pm.  Just
       drop me an email (ptiger@crl.com) and I'll give you directions.

I think its the perfect complement for Area 51 alien visitors.  I hope to
see you all there.

Love,

Purple Tiger

According to M8 magazine, it is 400 to 700 BPM... I think that may be a bit
of an exaggeration.  I don't know, I haven't heard any yet, but I think 180
to 200 may be close.  It comes from the Netherlands, especially Rotterdam.
Gabber translates roughly as "homey."  I hope to make it there this year to
check it out (yeah, I'm going just to check out the music scene ;-))

Gabber is Dutch hardcore speed techno. I would guess that it averages 
around 160-170+ -I've never actually clocked the stuff that I have, but I 
can assure you it is fast. Just think fast breakbeat without the break 
and syncopation. Just a *really* hard 4/4 bass drum with your choice of 
samples. Imagine "Dominator" played a twice the speed.
 It seems to be usually associated with football hooligans and 
carries a "hardcore" flavor: a lot of the titles sound somewhat violent, 
for example "Tear You Apart", The Falcon; "Fuck the Children", The 
Babysitter, and "Powerful Impact", Evil Maniax. Speed is evidently the 
drug of choice for the Dutch fans. The music pigeonholers have now found 
a new sub-directory of gabber (or gabba as some say) called "hakke" (from 
the Dutch "to chop", I believe) that is faster (200bpm) and harder (?).
 Generally I'd say it's not the most interesting stuff but it is good for 
keeping you awake and moving while writing term papers late at night ;).
Fun in small doses.

looks like the same ol' shit to me....
see y'all underground....
-------------

I went to megatripolis last (actually no, that was the first 1) when
it was at the trocadero... I have something like a minimum of a 6 month
wait to return to a place at which I was harassed even slightly by anyone
even vaguely resembling security... suffice it to say it happened at the
trocadero and 6 months ain't up yet... regular club venues must work
especially hard to get my dollars because I'm quite experienced with the
usual fair at these joints... I go to raves to be my self and not worry
about bullshit, but I was unable to feel like that at the trocadero so
I'll just wait for the underground to come around again... I'm not that
into track shows anyway, and there's little to this music to be performed
live if it's all on DAT anyway which it usually is (appropriate respect to
those who actually *perform* parts/all of the music live, but in all fairness
this is a rarity).

Would someone send me the e-mail addresses for the various rave mailing

list but don't have the actual address. I'm also expecting a request from
the east coast so I thought it might be prudent to have a list of lists.
I'll put it in alphabetical order or something and send it to Derek for 
possible inclusion on the calendar so the info gets out there.
Privite e-mail is fine.

Don't know if she's the Ellen you mean, but a friend of mine, Ellen 
Ferrato, is out there spinning from time to time...I've got a couple of 
her tapes, and she's quite good. Mostly progressive house, trance, a 
little techno...not much exposure yet, but that will likely change, I think.

Happy new year one and all.

A while back I posted a Web site for buying mix tapes, but it hasn't been 
in service for a while.  Here is the same organization, except 
now using a mailing list.  It's mostly East Coast stuff, I can't 
vouch for their reliability.

For all the same reasons that so few women are doing many other things,
like riding motorcycles or skateboarding or being doctors. If I were fond of
viewing women as helpless little girls, then I would say it's all because
of men victimizing women, and not letting women become DJs or motorcyclists
or
whatever. The question then is, why do women (as adult human beings fully
capable of making their own decisions) chose not to become DJs or
motorcyclists or whatever. Partly it's economic, it's expensive to get
started as a DJ. SL1200s ain't cheap nor are all those records that must be
bought every week to stay current, and as we are all aware women get paid
a lot less then men. So women are less likely to spend the money it takes to
become a DJ. Interestingly economics is not a factor in motorcycling because
bikes are far cheaper to use than cars. So I suppose money is not a very
big issue.The big issue is internalized oppression. Internalized oppression
is built up within the oppressed person over years of exposer to sexist
beliefs (from mother, father,TV, teachers, pretty much every one).
Internalized oppression is not an intellectual thing. Many women who are
intellectually strong feminists, find internalized oppression holding them
back just the same. Internalized oppression is a hideous disease that must
be smashed if there are to be any real gains in the fight against sexism.

Your Sister's House, now there are some people I really respect. Instead of
sitting around pointing fingers at men and a male dominated scene. They
took ACTION and put on their own party. And a damn fine one at that. By
providing a place for women DJs to spin, Your Sister's House have sent a
strong message to women in the scene, that is OK for women to be DJs. In so
doing they have struck a blow to the oppression (both internal and
external) that binds us all. Right on YSH!

>snip<

>Am i wrong to point fingers

Yes. You would do better to take action. IE encourage women who show an
interest in DJing, buy tapes by female Djs, make a point of going to raves
where female DJs will be spinning, ask promoters to hire your favorite
female DJ etc.

>dj opportunities have been wide open for women,

Not wide open but by no means closed.

For the most part yes.

Yes things are indeed very wrong.

It seems to me that you think the laser tag game is some how violent.
Its not even particularly aggressive.  It's hard to be aggressize
in the game when you are listening to happy trance music and your
chest harness gives off pleasant vibrations when your are tagged by
an opponent.  Its hardly symbolic of murder.

Of course, it should be noted that explicit lyrics do not cause
violence.  I think that the explicit lyrics are not allowed because
children play the game as well (though not many at night.)

I beg to differ; even if the game isn't painful, the metaphor is quite
strongly placed.  The fact is you're hunting your cohorts with a gun.
There is literally noone who isn't inundated with our macro-culture
who doesn't associate guns with danger, violence and death.  While I
wouldn't say this game is terrible (have a look at some of the more
gruesome video games, comparatively, laser tag is benign), but you are
playing a game whose metaphor is war.  If you're worried about violent
lyrics, I would think you might be concerned with a game whose object
is to shoot other players, you are now "acting" out a basically violent
scenario.  I'm not really concerned with people like sfraves types playing
this type of game, but I'd be damned if I'd let my kid (if/when I ever
have one) play something like this.  The message definitely gets through
and it's no less influential than violent TV or music lyrics.

 Although, I am VERY concerned about violence and its propagation in our
 culture something in this last sentence stuck me VERY HARD ( or else I
 wouldn't be responding )

 Consider this:

 I'd be damned if I'd let my kid  "go out to these all night raves where
 there's all types of drugs and loud music destroying their ears and who
 knows what other types of bad influences".

 ( Justification for police harassment of these illegal parties if I've
   ever seen it )

 Or just fill in the blanks...

 I'd be damned if I'd let "    ".


 I don't want this to become a flame war since I am not really "flaming"
 but I'm hopefully pointing out the major problem with controlling
 violence ( or children ) - Balancing our personal visions of the perfect
 world with our control ( or attempted control ) of other people based
 on those visions.  A good lesson in this struggle can be had by watching
 the actions of the "christian right" - now there's a group that makes
 it obvious that they know exactly what everyone should and shouldn't do.

 Although, I am VERY concerned about violence and its propagation in our
 culture something in this last sentence stuck me VERY HARD ( or else I
 wouldn't be responding )

 Consider this:

 I'd be damned if I'd let my kid  "go out to these all night raves where
 there's all types of drugs and loud music destroying their ears and who
 knows what other types of bad influences".
--------------------------------------------------------
I hear what you're saying, however I wouldn't begin to try to tell anyone
other than MY child (certainly not YOUR child) what they can and can't do.
Beyond that, I'm particularly disgusted with these ex-hippie parents who
can't remember their own summer of love when they all dropped and saw God
and refuse to allow their children to undergo the same evolution they
themselves (supposedly) learned so much from.  Talk about hypocrisy....

However, I don't have any problems laying ground rules for my own offspring
should they ever materialize.  In fact, it's my responsibility to do so,
IMHO.  And in a role in which I am tasked with deciding what influences are
appropriate, etc., for quite young people, I feel no remorse in prohibiting
violence, whether metaphoric or real.

 ( Justification for police harassment of these illegal parties if I've
   ever seen it )
------------------------------------------------
The police have definitely been acting on the wishes of misguided parents
and, again, I take your point.  However, I don't see prohibiting violence
and violent toys/games from my own children as interfering with the choices
and development of others, quite the opposite.  The problem you are referring
to comes, IMHO, from people attempting to exercise influence over people they
have no reason/right to exercise influence over.  I also understand and agree
with the concept that children are small people, but real people and that they
should be treated with as much respect as adults.  This still doesn't negate
a parental desire to control to some extent, the ideas a child comes in contact
with, particularly at a very young and impressionable age.  There are many
out there trying to influence other peoples children (television comes to
mind immediately) which is, again IMHO, extremely uncool.  Again,
it boils down to alot of common sense and realizing where the appropriate
limits lie.

So, will I let my kids play violent games, watch Barney, buy toy guns?  No,
I will spend my time turning my children on to things I think are cool,
healthy and productive.  I realize they may reject my values, which is
likely to be hard to deal with but is also something that is inevitable
in some sense.  I will also strongly discourage things that I feel are
harmful, destructive, immoral, etc.  Games/play that is centered around
violence definitely fits the description for me, so I have no problems
prohibiting toy guns, laser tag, and other related stuff.  At some point,
if my kids end up being really into that stuff, I'll have to acknowledge
their autonomy, but I will choose to surround them with things I feel to
be constructive in the beginning.  At which point you allow your children
to diverge from your own values is a fairly personal issue and I'm not even
going to bother to make that public, it's not public business.  It is an
important bit of timing though, nonetheless...

I agree that movies, TV, newspapers, and other mass media saturate us
with violence.

I also note that this saturation coincides with growing anti-violent
crime hysteria: medieval punishment for even the most trivial offense.

As less is permitted, more is desired.

===

Violence is an instinctive response to frustration.  Remember that we are
a few thousand years of human trying to control millions of years of beast.

Calling instinct "evil" doesn't solve our problem.  The beast doesn't care.

===

Denying the beast's existence doesn't solve our problem.  As less is
permitted, more is desired.

===

It may be, then, that we must make peace with our desires.  If they
cannot be contained, they can at least serve our needs.

===

Like fire, anger is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.  Like
fire, anger can be used carefully as a barrier against complete
devastation.

Like fire, the longer anger is denied the more fiercely it burns.

===

It may be, then, that that which we call "inhuman" is precisely that
which makes us human.  And it may be, then, that there is a place for
violence in pursuit of joy.  And it may be that the battle is being
fought here, today, as the lawyers, politicians, businessmen,
gangsters, Party members, judges, juries, executioners, policemen,
informers, enforcers, functionaries, button-pushers, and solid
citizens struggle to make our status even more solidly quo.  And it
may be that a quick red moment of tooth and claw is far better than a
slow grinding death amidst the cogs of our modern death-culture
machine, turning the crank that coins wealth for gray people in gray
suits.

===

And it may be that our high fine moments of agape are also a
manifestation of the beast, and that both our joy and our violence are
condemned for the same reason -- because they force others to remember
what they have tried so hard to forget, working for trinkets with which
to decorate the bars of their soul-cage.

 I took the liberty of using some of text from your post [actually, I
had *exactly* the same thoughts and just noticed that you said exactly
the same thing...;-)] and created this document while frobbing away
with our (completely bitchin') html authoring tool, (forgive me my terms,
I was reared in the 70's...), and thought that the juxtaposition of these
*words of wisdom* and a few, well, *inspirational* pictures was just
kind of yeah, wow... anyway, feel free to check it out... it amused the
hell out of me, but hey, I've probably got a warped perspective...

Thankyou Cindy Seaofsin-    FABULOUS!!

Well i stand corrected sorta, good! Most of them from the Bay Area
(i've heard or heard of most of them, but i admit how cluless i've been)
Get it....
I guess they're just not in the established first wave of djs or 
whatever, for whatever reason, but i'm happy to know there's (hopefully) 
an ample amount of women djs out there, as numerous as the boys 
someday...or else i don't think i wanna be involved (cuz i do believe 
this should be a "peace and love", utopian etc. type situation- call me 
unrealistic, but i don't think it's too much to ask from a new paradigms 
scenario...).

I dunno. I kinda prefer those little massager thingies that people
wander around with at raves. Hits the spot. Pounds the nail right
through the saviours hand... yes it does.

I guess you could pretend you were phiring love phasers. But like my

"sex is ok, but i prefer the real thing". :-)

Here's an update on the response to the Visual Aid benefit raid:

Attendees and supporters of the benefit are meeting at 938 Harrison this Wednesday, Jan 11, at 4:30 pm to march to the Police Commissioners Meeting at 850 Bryant, there to demand some answers.

A civil lawsuit against the SFPD is being prepared by the law firm of Steele, Clarence, and Buckley -- the same firm that successfully handled the October Sweep of 1989, when police illegally declared martial law in the Castro during an Act Up demo.

The Office of Citizen Complaints (OCC) is conducting an investigation.

The SFPD is conducting their own investigation.  If approached by SFPD on this, you have the right to remain silent.

The Board of Supervisors has been very helpful in pointing out how indiscriminate illegal police activites cost the City money in the form of lawsuits such as these, and how more citizen oversight of the SFPD is needed.

For more information call 415-267-6142.

Agreed.

I went out to see Orbital on Thanksgiving even though I had been houseridden
with the flu for the past 9 days, figgering that I might as well have a good
time instead of nursing my sickness.  The only things that went in my system 
that evening was water, .5 a tab, and the Jolly Ranchers that I didn't give
away, and yet I felt great.

After I had gone home, I sat around in my room a bit, and then the symptoms
came back.  I figgered I might as well see the doctor about it.  At 9 that
Sunday morning, having had no sleep in 23 hours, I went down to CIGNA, got my
medication, and had my sickness cleared in no time  :)

peas,
paul

On this months jungle cruise, I ran into an ambient music friend from
college who has become quite popular, prolific, and artistic in the
"space" music arena. He's been doing this kind of stuff since at least
'84, well before "ambient" was named. His material is available on
"Hearts of Space". Note that the uninitiated might just confuse some of
this kind of product as "new age music"; such a name would probably
underestimate the musical/artistic value of his music.

--------------------

PS: w/r/t the recent (Mixmaster Morris) cruise, i was wondering if
anybody has an idea of "whose" jungle he was playing. Was it his own
production? I certainly recognized a  number of "his" songs, but I
noticed he played other artists too (e.g. Portishead and that "I see i
know" Exist Dance label song)... I liked MM's kind of "jungle" much
more than the other "jungle" I've heard at wicked parties.

Note that "jungle" goes in quotes till I figure out what the heck
people are talking about.

        No Kidding-
                my $.02 - when they came here on the 4th of July I ended up
becoming the live sex show with some guy I met there (we went out for the
obligatory 3 weeks following the event). I don't normally do stuff like
that (I think). oh well

>And don't forget to wear old clothes.

        Unless you want a new purple and black outfit.

i was stoked on going to area 51 this weekend and then i saw the fold out
flyers and now i've become a bit apprehensive, knowing that its THAT big.  i
just wanted some reassurance that this won't be a big hunter/gatherer
convention that i'll be attending.  if not reassurance,  at least can someone
tell me what to expect so that when i see what i've gotten myself into, i
don't beat my head against the wall for going to a $20 party?  ---->brian

Hmmmmmmm, couldn't you just guess that I would be the one to reply to 
your question??  Ok,  Yeah $20 is hella bucks to shell out for a rave 
(esp. since you also have to buy canned food!) but I kinda guess that 
there is a time and place for everything.  I normally dislike really 
large parties and prefer smaller ones but its always good to see  a 
really huge massive every once in a while.  Plus, it's thrown by cdc 
whose parties I've enjoyed in the past.  Add to that one of the freshest 
lineups I've seen in a while (cdc djs and wicked djs) and dj josh winx 
from philly and you know it can't be that bad.  Plus really big parties 
have the tendency to attract people who you don't get to see too often.  
Of course, some of these people you don't want to see( all the gangstas 
and shit) but it's kinda a rare chance to meet new people.  Lotsa people 
sit at home and only go out when there's a huge event.  Of course, I 
heard that it might be at richmond ...YUK!!!! but oh well. It still is 
worth going!

Probably depends on the nature of the extraterrestrials that know
about it.

Giamma ponders:
> Does anybody have an vague idea on where this event is going to be ?

2nd hand info tells me: Richmond Civic Auditorium.

Can anyone tell us a little about "jungle"? (BPM? general description? etc)
I've seen a couple others asking the same question, but have yet to see 
any responses--other than the enthusiastic welcomes to have this event.

Despite the rain and my lack of enthusiasm for a $25 5 hour event (wow,
paying more than minimum wage to be enertained!) I ended up going on the
Ambient Jungle cruise on Sat. - which turned out to be a worthwhile
adventure. The boat pitched and rolled the whole night, and it's a wonder
the turnables didn't skip more than they did. There were two levels, with
C3, Jonah, and Thomas on the bottom and Morris playing the whole evening up
top. I spent most of the evening on the floor up top. (Although the
wave-enforced swaying was kinda fun, too) Morris played a fairly eclectic
set, throwing ambient, ambient dub, trance, and jungle into the stream with
impressive continuity. I was impressed with his segues between styles and
songs, often done without beatmatching, the usual method.

The jungle he played was the first I've been able to appreciate. A little
slow for jungle (150 maybe) and well constructed, with original drum
programming and sweeping electronic sounds. Like if Speedy J or Black Dog
took a turn at it. Very different from the recycled sped up ragga/breakbeat
tracks I've heard elsewhere.

I made it downstairs for some of Jonah's live set, which was stunning, and
for some of the C3 set, which was perfect for checking out the bay as we
cruised round and round. Much more chill than Morris.

All in all, a nice ride.

Joe

(ps - I hear Morris is to play at Detour tomorrow)

Very different from the recycled sped up ragga/breakbeat
tracks I've heard elsewhere.
-------------

Is this what "jungle" is?  I heard something somewhere that had lead
me to believe it was more funk oriented, but 150 BPM is quite a bit
faster than what I would call funk... anyone?

 From my limited exposure to jungle this summer in the UK, it struck me as 
 hardcore rave (not hardcore techno), drum and bass/happy hardcore mix 
 with a kickin ragga mc........pretty cool. As for the San Francisco rave 
 scene I was a little dissapointed that there were no mc's to liven up the 
 crowd/create a group feelin.

Very different from the recycled sped up ragga/breakbeat
tracks I've heard elsewhere.

Is this what "jungle" is?  I heard something somewhere that had lead
me to believe it was more funk oriented, but 150 BPM is quite a bit
faster than what I would call funk... anyone?

Two effects of MDMA come to mind that might help fight a cold:

A very positive mental state. A positive mental outlook does affect
several chemical balances in the body, and actually does help you heal
faster. [I don't have a reference handy... heard the details by a
physician on NPR]

Hyperthermia. Just for fun, bring a thermometer to a rave (the thin
type you press against the forehead is great) and see how hot you get
when you dance. It's not much different than having a fever, and the
effect on virii should be much the same.

If you really want to see infinity, try cutting a slit one of the 
mirrors.  Not only can you see infinity, but you see yourself included in 
it.  It's kind of a cool experience....

I found this also works if you cut a slit through one's head. But it
leaves an unsightly gaping hole where one's ego once was. Even worse,
club security goons will look right past your superego and attempt to
confiscate your id.

That's why it's always important to carry a fake id when experiencing
loss of ego/superego.

Why point a lasertag gun at someone and shoot them?

Because it's fun, and it's consentual. Because it's exercise. Because
it's speed-chess, trying to stay "alive" and achieve a goal while
others strive for an opposing one. Because you like to feel your heart
pound, your blood roar. Because when the day's over, everyone goes
home with a smile. Because someone's better than you, and you want to
see if you can become as skilled. Because you have to work at it.

Or even because you like playing with the dark side. The energy is
there; release it harmlessly. Play DOOM. Chop wood. Spar at the dojo.
Grit your teeth when doing something absolute. Play fast deep dark
techno until your brain screams. Tease it. Understand it. Acknowledge
it. Release it harmlessly.

There is no crime between two consenting adults. Whether the gun is
simulated or real. Whether there is pain or not. No matter what one
thinks is "represented". The error is in judgement. No victim and
there is no crime, no right, and no wrong. The real victims are those
you judge and try to "correct".

Hi, kid-E's!

What does the amazing ability of MDMA to cure the common cold have to do
with bay area raves? Not much, probably, but now there's a new mailing list
where you can sing the praises of your favorite illegal substance.  Here's
the details:

>For anyone interested an experimental  mailing list has been set up for 
>discussing mdma (X,E,Ecstasy). Please invite anyone you feel might be 
>benificial to such an enviroment.
>
>To subscribe, send mail to listpimp@underground.net with the message:

>
>
>underground.net  claims no responsibility for the content of this 
>mailing list.
>Thank You.
>
>Fess.

P.S.  Cure the common cold? Cough, hack, sneeze....  Yeah, right...

Subject: What is....Jungle?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Seems to be a bit of confusion, I will attempt to clarify...  Jungle music
is generally reggae and dub influenced breakbeat, that is, drum breaks are
sped up and throbbing dub-style bass is played over it.  Vocals are similar
to ragga(UK/Jamaican rap) and may candidly reflect the troubles of urban life.

I hate musical hairsplitting, but here goes...
Now the music you may have heard on the 5-hour cruise (I don't know I wasn't
there) was (drum roll please) "Ambient Jungle," which features less vocals,
lush ambient-style melodies, and spacious dub production and effects.  Much
less agressive then "regular" jungle, and thus frowned upon by many
steadfast Junglists.  You may also be able to hear "ambient" or
"intelligent" jungle at the Gardening Club.  This style is most likely to
catch on in SF.

As for MC's, they had one at the Jungle event I attended in Toronto, and I
found him to be lame and annoying.  Also, it caused most people to be turned
toward the stage instead of facing each other, and created a
perfomer/audience effect.  That's not what I go to raves for.

Jungle is advertised for an event Jan 20...415-337-4236.

Just wondering, but is Area 51 going to be all ages?  I have this feeling
Josh Wink is going to be awesome (he was at Futur anyway) and I have that
awful disability of being under 21.

I honestly think that is one of the big advantages we have. MC's and live
acts generaly don't go to well down here, they kind of go against that
faceless moral, plus IMHO it takes away from the group feeling having one
guy obviously "above" everybody else & I'd rather just be able to listen
to the music dry (I don't even like those cool tribal drummers, unless
it's not to loud) Jus my opinion on the subject :)

Sounds like the new buzz word of the month. Breakbeats at 45 with lots of
bass sure don't interest me. I know I probably haven't heard the real
stuff, but I kinda doubt there are many people that play it.

Does Milton in a dress count as an alien?  Speaking of which, where is
the big lug?  I haven't seen a mail from him is ages.  Has anyone seen
him lately, is he just lurking?

If the rumors about the Richmond site are true, then the rave should
be 18+.  It should be noted that Q-Zar is all ages and makes a good
warmup for UFO's.

	I saw Milton at Come-Unity. He said that his brother has his 
computer. I'm sure he'll be back online soon. I thought Milton was an 
alien, from Neptune or something. :)

Jungle is sort of a combination offshoot of the hardcore/breakbeat and
dancehall/ragga scenes in the UK.  A typical jungle track runs around
150 bpm and has a half-speed bass line and distinctive flurries of drum
beats, not a constant rhythm as with breaks.  There are a lot of vocal
samples, some just chatted over the track and some from other records.
The bass often has a drawn out swooshing sound, as opposed to a more
hardcore/techno-like pulse or thud.  

Jungle tracks are really distinctive and they're easy to spot once you've
heard them.  Many of the freshest tracks are on one-off or very limited
edition "dub plates" (a tradition that goes back to the Jamaican sound
systems of the late 1950s).  Popular ones sometimes get picked up and
reissued by regular labels, and labels also put out the more popular
styles directly.  Moving Shadow is one of the best and biggest jungle-
oriented labels but there are many others.

Jungle has a lot of sub-variants already, even though it really only
began as a noticeable style about two years ago.  It is massively
popular in London but less so elsewhere in England.  There are quite
a few pockets of junglism around the US, I gather it has a following
in places like Houston, Pittsburgh and the upper Midwest.  

The jungle scene in the UK seems to be splitting into factions to some
degree, with one branch more or less the equivalent of G rap here and
associated with a lot of aggro lyrics.  But jungle ranges across the
emotional map; I have a very nice jazzy release by DJ Pulse called 
"So Fine," for example.  

I don't see it as traditional dance music, it's basically too fast for
that, but you can kind of shake to it pretty well and the more interesting
sound effects give it more flavor, for me anyway, than most varieties
of hardcore techno and breaks.  

The jungle scene definitely perceives itself as being new and completely
different from rave, house, hardcore/ardkore, what have you.  I don't
think it has much prospect for commercial success in the US, and that's
probably fine.  But it's definitely worth checking out the music!

Rrrrrrrrrrrrollll the bass!!

Hey, I saw mikebee mc at a rave(Wink spun that night, too, no less) and 
it was pretty damn cool.  I prefer just listening to the music, 
generally, but if done well, an MC can really get you going :)

   Well it is difficult to pass judgement on the subject as I quite honestly 
have never even heard of any mcees on the scene. But, the part of being 
at a rave that I most enjoy is sharing the experience with others. The 
empathy for everyone (almost everyone :o), and the group feelin that 
soars as the music changes an the MC brings the crowd to an incredible 
high is what I miss. I have only been going to raves in the SF area since 
I moved here from the UK three years ago and it has changed dramatically 
since then, but there is still something missing, for me.

   However, at the smaller more underground raves (most usually the best), I 
can see your point that an MC would definately distract from the general 
vibe and become the center of attraction - not desirable on e. But some 
of the bigger raves, like the gathering (big yet not too commercial to 
attract gansta/HS/hip-hop folks), An MC or two would go down great, IMHO ;)

I agree!  (I also understand that people don't want to always hear ego
pumping...).  Does anyone have a tape of mikebee rapping?  I'd personally
love to check it out.  Also, mikebee, are you hear?  Got any gigs coming
up?

I don't know of any jungle samples, but there are some acid breaks tunes 
up there.  If interested, look in /music/labels/orbitrecords/sound/ for 
the files Electrostatic and Attempt.  There are some .au and .wav 
snippets and a full length, stereo version of each (MPEG of course).

If you listen to them, mail me with your comments :)

If anyone is interested in coming together and putting on a jungle event, 
I would love to coordinate efforts. I am a recent transplant from the 
east coast and I spin jungle.

I think that there is plenty of interest to put on a sweet party, and I 
would love to meet some more SFravers. Let me know.

Greetings!

Just a brief reminder that Komotion (2779 16th St. at Folsom in SF) will
be open again this Saturday from 10AM till 4PM to clean and spruce up.
Thanks to those of you who came last weekend and got so much done.  There
are a few more areas that need some repainting (Krylon spray paint is *so*
hard to paint over!), and other general cleanup chores.

Komotion is an all volunteer arts collective that has hosted the last two
friends and family's (which so many of us enjoyed), and have acted as hosts
to the Bay Area underground for nearly 10 years.  They're awfully nice folks
who need our help to ensure their success in working with lots of upcoming
inspections to get the space dramatically improved for everyone's benefit.

Come on down if you have some time, and lend a hand to this worthy cause!
Thanks!

Dear Ptiger;

       Please do the world and sfraves a favor; give qzar a break. I'm
sure its really cool. But your presistence makes me question its
its appropreiatness on a mailing thats for sfraves. also, it makes me
dought whether its really any good. if i want to hear about qzar; i'll
listen to howard stern. I hate computer advertising; it has no place
here.

                                               Peace & Love

Look 2 1/2 years ago some people were calling 2 Bad Mice & Suburban Bass stuff
jungle, most people would have thought it to be techno although it was
miles away from the original detroit sound and just as far away from what
you are now calling jungle. So anytime someone comes at me with the new
buzzword-genre I aint buyin it, they are for the masses to let someone
else decide what their supposed to like now. From what I've heard at *SF*
record stores & parties it doesn't sound like anything special, I know
there's probably some stuff that would sound good in the chill room
but I have yet to hear any dj's play anything but cheesy crap.

I tried connecting w/ him last week on a visit to Berkeley--even tried 
hunting him down on campus. Nobody knows where Milton has gone. I believe 
his father is in town;  maybe they're out doing the road trip thing.

From: "Bryce Ryan" <brycer@ultima.org>

Greetings!

Just a brief reminder that Komotion (2779 16th St. at Folsom in SF) will
be open again this Saturday from 10AM till 4PM to clean and spruce up.
Thanks to those of you who came last weekend and got so much done.  There
are a few more areas that need some repainting (Krylon spray paint is *so*
hard to paint over!), and other general cleanup chores.

Komotion is an all volunteer arts collective that has hosted the last two
friends and family's (which so many of us enjoyed), and have acted as hosts
to the Bay Area underground for nearly 10 years.  They're awfully nice folks
who need our help to ensure their success in working with lots of upcoming
inspections to get the space dramatically improved for everyone's benefit.

Come on down if you have some time, and lend a hand to this worthy cause!
Thanks!

Dear Sfraves;

       I hate people in general that think they are better than other
people; or by virute of what they do for a living. MC's are not the
music; but tend to think that people come to see them rather than the
music. I for one could stand not to hear someone standing up there
talking about how bad they are; and over the music that I paid good
money to here. If I want to hear someone say how bad they are; I'll
listentoNewt.Itendtolump politians, MC's and Newt all in the same
catogorety; noise polution. By the way everyone knows that I'm the
badest anyway; just kidding :). We are all in this together; and no one
is better or worst than you or I. Love knows no gender; race; religion;
I wouldn't have such a problem if they were up there promoting the scene
or world harmony ..etc. But they promote themselves at the expense of
others; my soul has a problem with this. As John Lenon said we are all
stars; we all shine just as bright as everyone else. So I will proablly
say away from an MC driven event. The scene is about music not
indivuals.

                                       Peace & Love

oh my goodness, what have we here... Brian, don't you think that you're
generalizing just a little bit?  I mean, really, though.  I know this is
true of snoop, but there ARE other emcees, don't you know?

Why what if I said the same thing about ravers?  Besides, how could
YOU be the baddest?  I'M the baddest, damnit!  (smiley explicitly
mentioned, just in case...)

Dear Jack;

       I thought my generalizing would get me into troyuuble. Your also
right that I should take things on a case by case basis. My comments
come from a general perception about MC's. But I(speaking for myself
only) come for the music. MC's obviously take away from this for me.
THey shift the emphasis from the music on to them. I would gladlly
listen to a recommedation on your part of someone who this didn't apply
and was still an MC.

                                       Peace & Love

Dear Whomever;

       To the person who's address has gone into the electronic winds of
time; asking me to appoloize to ptiger. As a human being I make lots of
mistakes; if ptiger was sincerely looking for someone to go with him to
qzar then I sincerely appoloize. It sounded like advertising to me; and
if its qzar or bay lunch; i still don't think it belongs on an open
forum for sfraves. Also, don't get me wrong I would not want anyone to
feel that I was repressing their right to free speech; for I was not.
The problem with free speech is that everyone has the right and if your
going to say something you need either to be prepared to back it up with
an effective argument or appoloize for it. But with ptiger clarified
intention in mind; I would be interested in going to qzar before the
event. I have fond paint ball memories; even though the
army clotyhes were a little much.

                                       Peace & Love
                                       brianv@liberty.com

Hi, my finals end on the 19th, and the best thing that I could think of 
to get the hell away from school after them is a rave, but I have the 
severe handicapp (worse than quadraplegia) of being under 21.  Does 
anyone know of any raves for those of us losers who were born to late on 
the 19th? I'm going away after the 19th, so I'll still have all my stress 
bottled up in me if I don't get to one on that day.  Please e-mail if you 
find one, there are none I could find on the calandar. Thanks!

Don't bother with Q-Zar.  If you've ever been paintballing, you'll hate 
it.  It's kind of fun, sure, but it's really x-pensive (compared to 
paintballing) and it's not half of the adrenilane rush.... of course 
playing Q-Zar on some mind enhanser might be an interesting x-perience 
that I have never tried....

I don't know what qualifies exactly as an MC, but here's my expereince.  
Down for the summer in L.A., they had a party called One Roof.  They had 
Frankie Bones come and play some hardcore.  And between some of his 
music, he'd stop the music and just talk for a little bit, while he cued 
up for the next.. or after skylab 2000 was done, he said a few more things.

He was being a real cheeseball when he said "I've been all over the 
country, and I've been to a lot of parties, but you guys rock"  (Or 
something cheesy to that effect.)  Cute.. but stupid.

Hi Brian,

I know you mean well but I mentioned it all of twice.  I'm not making
a dime from Q-Zar and I really only want to setup a group activity for
the purpose of adding to the community.  Q-Zar has black lights,
day-glo, techno music, and lasers making it extremely relevant to ravers.
I think its a real kick in the pants and I think a lot of others would
enjoy it too.  The last thing I expected was to get flamed.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

Hi All!

Derek reports: 
> I don't have anything for Friday, so you have to choose from the weeklies;

Coincidentally, I'll be at Q-Zar on FRIDAY too.  When I made the
announcement about saturday I had NO IDEA that my cyberpunk friends
would be going on Friday the 13th.  So, if none of the weeklies
interest you, and Ronert Park is not too far away, I would love to
meet you.  Call my pager/voicemail @ 406-2109 if you want to hook up.

Ciao,

ps This is the last time I'll use the Q-word.  Thanks for your patience

There is very little real jungle from the current UK scene (or elsewhere)
in the SF stores now.  Primal has a few, Ameba had a few until they were
all bought (!), there might be a little at BPM or Star but I haven't been
there in a bit.  

The Moonshine jungle comp is OK but on the whole the tracks are kinda not
that great.

meet you.  Call my pager/voicemail @ 406-2109 if you want to hook up.

Ciao,

IN FEBRUARY 94 art forum called jungle the end-all of dance music and I 
then posted to the list a question...What is Jungle?

Brian B and Laura brought in some tapes I think they were glad to be rid 
of with the name jungle on them: they had MC's and it seemed like 
Universe style hardcore.

A couple Irish DJ's, paul and dara, played jungle for me for the first time.

Someone gave me a name of a distributer who did internet jungle 
orders(some one from this list:] ) and I sold mostly the spacey ambient 
stuff.

In the S.F. Area there is 
Deaks,Dave,Alex(little),Noah,Gamall,Phish,Jonah,Charlie,Markie,Thomas,Dan
and I am sure many more who play jungle (no girls?) so far Jonah is my 
FAvorite.

Jungle keeps getting better at a fast pace and I have no tapes which 
reflect the current state of junglisms in sf

Today I heard a jungle tape by DJ RAP (a girl)which was ripping and 
tearing(these are jungle terms!)

I hear they are smoking crack to jungle at the Ministry of Sound in London
this is a reflection of the brutal ragga style of jungle which is not the 
kind we are digging here. We like sophisticated drum programing, 
hauntingly beautiful melodies and not much else.

Soundworks tends to get a few new jungle tracks each week. Of the stuff
I've seen in stores I've only been impressed by 10%.

I've seen it tried in SF, I've seen it fail...

Just not with the SF vibe, I guess. Don't think I'd like it, though
I'd be willing to attend and be open minded about it.

I *love* it when DJs really get into what they're doing and share
their fun with the crowd. That's what made Deaks' mind-exploding set
at the last F&F so much fun for me; not only was it a killer set (one
of the best I've ever heard), he was obviously having *fun* and shared
that with the crowd. Wheee!

I went to tuscon and tried to go dancing
Seems like there is about one big club space used
midweek - Hotel Congress

I caught Disco Night which I heard the next day
is also Gang Night (let's just call this a southwest
perspective) - I was a little uneasy with all the
preppy jock types (Hey watch me lift my girlfriend
in the air, I am sooo Strong ...) until I found the 
"gangsters" to hang with (anyone else ever have 
this mixed crowd = safety feeling?)  

Also heard dj h-bomb play acid jazz.  His music
selection was very good although there were a few
train-wreck mixes. Nice group of people.

Find stores club dada and tuff inc for party
finding assistance - they were very helpful!!
Looks like they have nice parties almost
every weekend and the town had more 
going on midweek than I expected.

Dear Ptiger;

       First if this message is a repeat; i appolloize; i'm having one
of those bad mail days. I quess either by virtue of internet
duplication; i saw a lot more than two mentions of QZAR with your name
on them. And again I appolloize for my overzealous protectiveness of the
computerized aspect of the scene. The ineternet as we know will change
>from a point and click demand/request for information ie ad's to a force
feed; unless we let people who would take advangetage of this media know
this is not want we what; and will not tolerate it. I had no idea from
your requests that you were looking for company. Everyone in the world
is worth meeting; and I would love to do Qzar; having moved here not to
long ago. Thou I admitt to having no idea were ronger park is; I would
sincerely entertian going there tonight to hang out. Drop me a line.
Again thanks and sorry.

                       Peace & Love

Yes whisltes definiately suk the big wazoo; they rip though your mind
destoring the peace and harmony created by the mood. Leaving that

Do to the beauty of elm filters, when my disk went to 100% last nite
all my mail started getting written to /dev/null more or less
so aside from missing out on anything from these mailing lists 
im writing to, i also missed out on any personal messages,

SOooo... if you sent me anythign yesterday evening or this morning
you should probably try to resend it.  :) 

just trying to think of something to actually make this post
relevant to all the lists...
ummm.. oh yeah.

Everyone even remotely close to the southern california area
should come to UCI tonite to check out Sandra Collins,
Josh and Daniel spinning with Skylab2000, Dimension 23 and Paxwo 
performing live.. from 7pm to midnite at the UCI campus
email me for directions if you want them

(yeah.. sure.. just mention techno and obviously it deserves
to be mailed to some 500+ people throughout the world)

Is anyone from Marin going to be going to Area 51 tommorrow.    
Naturally,  the rain has got be stranded,  and there is not 
even a slight hope of any relief at least until LATE next week.

I really would lkike a ride from any kind soul who might be
coming through Mill Valley to the QZar pre-rave thingie.
Although I'll have NO MONEY to play Qzar,   I suppose I
can just hang loose.    

I was supposed to help set up in the Chill area,  and people
were expecting me early,   now it don't even look like I can
even get there at all.

I wonder what kind of effect I could obtain if someone somehow safely
managed to produce a slit in my head.

If pulling off such a task allows me to see Infinity with myself included
in it, does this mean that therefore I will be able to see into myself?

That's kinda Deeep.

Deep into infinity, that is.  No pun intended.

OK -->  Friends and Fellow Milton Buddies!  Here's the scooop on what has
been up with Milton lately:

Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond control, Milton has lost his
account with school at UC Bezerkely.  This means he is officially in a
temporary state of net-weaning, which we hope will turn right back around
again just as soon as he gets another account operational somewhere.  As
soon as he gets a new account working, you'll see him here on the net.  He
got his computer back from his brother, but he still lacks the internet
account he had before.


Some of you were wondering if Milton in a dress would be appropriate
door-discount material for Area 51...  Well I have some exciting news --
over the last week or so, Milton has been working on a full blown alien
costume that he plans to show off this Saturday at Area 51.

Without his access to the Internet (and all of you, his friends), Milton
has been kind of bummed out lately.  Keep an eye out for him at "Area 51",
and be sure to say hello, grin a REALLY big smile his way, and in general
spread some good, positive vibe for him this Saturday night!


Lotsa hugs, and see you all
down in  Area 51  Saturday!

I don't know. I tried using my craftsman reversible powerdrill, you
know, like right around where one's third eye would be. And you know,
it was going surprisingly well, a pretty clean gouge. ... And
allahthesundden, it kinda stuck. So like I was in a fetal position,
trying to pull the drill out by standing on my elbows... which really
kinda smarts if you think about it... but then I remembered that it was
a reversible drill!

Oh Joy!

This QZAR thing has given me an idea.

How about early evening weekend gatherings for people to share
comraderie with their fellow ravers.  These warm ups could be
anything from gathering at someones house, meeting for coffee
or dinner, or any other folksy kind of thing.  I'd love to get
suggestions for what could be done and I'll provide a voice mail
box that people could call to find out what's up for that night.

Wadday y'all think?

And MmMorris was absoultely awsome shifting all styles of techno seemlessly
making me want to dance one instant and meditate the next.   It was the
best $5 I ever spent.  Of course, the best $3 I ever spent was F&F and the
best $10 I ever spent would have to be YSH at Megatripolis.

Subject: Area 51 Frequently Asked Questions

AREA 51 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Answered by Psychospy, 10/23/94

WHAT IS AREA 51?

"Area 51" is a block of government land about 95 miles north of 
Las Vegas.  It is surrounded by the Nevada Test Site and the 
Nellis Air Force Range.  The name "Area 51" supposedly came from a 
designation appearing on an old map of the Nevada Test Site.  
Inside Area 51 is a large Air Force base, near the shore of Groom 
Dry Lake, that the government does not publicly acknowledge.  The 
airspace around the base is off-limits even to most military 
pilots and is referred to on aviation frequencies as "Dreamland."

WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE GROOM LAKE BASE?

The base at Groom Lake has traditionally been America's testing 
ground for the latest generation of secret aircraft.  The U-2, A-
12, SR-71 and F-117A were flight tested here long before being 
made public.  Since the government won't acknowledge anything 
about the base, it's hard to be know what is going on there now.  
Common rumors suggest two possible new aircraft, an ultra-high 
speed spy plane known as "Aurora" and a smaller version of the B-2 
which purportedly might replace the F-117A.  Most projects at 
Groom are probably more mundane, though, and of interest only to 
hard-core military buffs.

WHAT'S WITH THE UFOS?

This area has long been rich in UFO lore.  Whatever you can 
imagine--captured aliens, underground bases, alien-government 
collusion--it's all been claimed at Groom Lake.  One of the more 
restrained and interesting stories is the claim by a Las Vegan, 
Bob Lazar, that he worked with extraterrestrial flying saucers at 
an installation at Papoose Lake, south of Groom Lake, in an area 
he calls "S-4."  He says he helped "reverse engineer" one of the 
craft, but that he saw no aliens himself.  There seems to be no 
way to confirm or directly refute this claim.

Since Lazar first made his claims in a locally televised 
interview, many tourists have been coming to the public lands 
closest to the base to try to catch glimpses of alien craft in 
flight.  Many believe that they have seen UFOs here, but there are 
so many UFO-like natural and military phenomena on display here 
that its hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Many people 
have lived in this area all their lives and never seen a UFO.  It 
is important to note that there is a difference between the claim 
that the government has alien spacecraft in its possession and the 
claim that you can come here to see flying saucers in flight.  In 
general, the second claim is less credible.

WHERE DO WATCHERS GO?

About 130 miles from Las Vegas, at Mile Marker LN 29.5 on remote 
Nevada Highway 375, is a lone mailbox used by a local rancher.  
Since this "Black Mailbox" is the only landmark on this stretch of 
the highway, this is where the true believers come.  Many visitors 
claim to have seen flying saucer here, although the rancher 
himself claims to have seen none.

Much closer to Area 51, there are two hills on public land--White 
Sides and Freedom Ridge--that a visitor can legally climb to view 
the secret Air Force base.  Freedom Ridge is more popular because 
it is closer to the base (13 miles) and a less strenuous hike.  
The viewpoint can be reached by a four-wheel drive or by a 50 
minute hike from a good dirt road.

The Air Force has applied to seize the two viewpoints, but the 
process is going slowly.  The land remains open as of Oct. 94, and 
will probably remain so through at least Jan. 95.  If the land is 
eventually seized, other viewpoints will remain, but farther back 
and harder to get to.

WHAT ARE THE "CAMMO DUDES"?

That's the nickname for the anonymous private security force that 
patrols the military border.  They wear camouflage fatigues 
without insignia and drive white Jeep Cherokees with government 
plates.  They keep close watch on any visitors that come within a 
few miles of the border, but they are under orders to avoid 
contact.

WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF VISITING THIS AREA?

The greatest danger is wandering across the unfenced military 
border, which would result in your immediate arrest and a fine of 
up to $600.  Wherever a road crosses the border, it is marked by 
clear "Restricted Area" signs which should not be crossed.  In the 
desert, the border is marked by orange posts every 50 yards.  It 
is unwise to hike near the border at night because the posts 
become invisible.

Another major danger, when driving, is getting stuck on an remote, 
unmaintained dirt road that your vehicle cannot handle.

RESOURCES

"The Area 51 Viewer's Guide," a 110-page, self-published book by 
Glenn Campbell, offers general information, a reference list, maps 
and practical advice for visitors.  It is advisable to obtain this 
guide before you come so that you can be adequately prepared.  The 
cost is $15 plus $3.50 Priority Mail postage (US), ordered from:  
Secrecy Oversight Council, HCR Box 38, Rachel, NV 89001.  A 
catalog of other publications is available upon request.

sound system and zendada
one is $5 the other is $10
this distinction is only made
at the cashiers window

early - 12:30 or so the music was
not interesting upstairs and the first
zendada dj was mediocre

later - still sounded boring upstairs
same thing downstairs, dance anyway

later - Doc Martin is on ...
I jam upstairs and he blows me away

sick rude thumping Incredible

then Mixmaster Morris train-wrecks his way onto
the turntables with some slow (sounding, house bpm)
spacey trance sorta stuff.  soon he cranks up the speed.
it is fast, but not frantic, trance (i guess ...)
he successfully drives away half the dance floor

  I've heard some really good MC'ing before in England.  It was at this 
HUGE jungle party which looked, felt and sort of sounded like an old 
school SLAMMIN rave!  It blew me away and the MC's kept the crowd pumping 
with chants like "I don't wanna come down fast, I want my E buzz to 
last!"  It works best with Jungle though (imho) so until we get some 
really slammin jungle parties (like they should be done) we probably 
won't see many MC's.

  We're actually thinking of having some friends MC at one of our 
upcoming Cloud Factory parties.  Just for the fun of it of course :>

afternoon/night to go to a rave(don't know which one yet) and I could

Does anyone know for sure what the age limit is for Area 51?  The info
line never says (the 510 number says absolutely nothing) and I'd hate
to waste the trip only to be disappointed.

If anyone knows definitively, please mail the list with it--I can't be

Mitsuma
-------

Hello Mitsuma.

You may wonder how I came to be.

I once believed that no soul ever left this earth, and instead returned
again and again in an endless enjoyment and celebration of life.

Even as I believed this I had no idea of how old my soul really was.

One day I discovered I was the oldest soul there ever was, the first soul to
walk this earth.  

I discovered this as I lay in my bed and my soul reached the limits of
its memory, and lost track of where it was supposed to be.  

It slid upwards through time for some countless number of millennia until
it came to rest in a grassy field on the shores of the San Francisco bay.

There were thousands of people waiting for me there and I knew that they
loved me as much as they loved themselves and as much as they loved each
other.  

As I gloried in their love, my friend Mitsuma came forward and said,

"As the second oldest soul on this earth it is my pleasure to give you the
 gift you gave me so long ago."

Mitsuma kissed me then and when he did he passed to me a virus, a thought,
a belief that evolved me.  It was not like a torturous struggle for survival,
it was like the feeling of relief you feel when reach your bed after a long
day.  I lost every shell I still had after all these lives, and I knew and
felt all things and emotions.  

I returned to the present then and now I am here before you Mitsuma.

And now I ask you, before I kiss you, do you want to evolve?

sounds like our friend brian is a bit put off by the more 
common "mc"
which is usually some kid with a feel for iambic pentameter, a 
bad attitude,
and access to a dime store DAT studio.

no offense brian(you don't seem to mind the heat anyway)...

our friend john(Techno Grand-dad) sent us a couple of tapes 
from 
the london jungle scene.
they're interesting...150-170BPM(no shit, way too fast, even if 
on speed)

they are polluted with the screaming rants of mc's

BUT

the mc's raps are VERY group ego inspiring, very un-pretentious
very go go go, unlike the typical american urban disaster 
dreck.

i guess the reason i don't get off on it is that i dont think 
one mc can 
have such a good feel for the emotional state of the crowd

i guess it's like perfume...just stinks to some people
give me fresh air please

I got there around 10.  Good visuals in the main area.  Wandered around 
and entered the smaller, foyer-type room in front of the arena where 
someone was actually spinning jungle.  Being from Houston, I've certainly 
heard my share, and this dj knew his stuff.  Very melodic, danceable, 
fluid jungle.  I'm a bit biased about dancehall, ragga style stuff--which 
is to say I hate it.  But no screaming rastafarian here, just controlled 
female vocals (*sigh*) and swooshy sounds.  Later, this foyer was filled 
with some of the juiciest house I've heard in a long time :)

The place really started to get full around midnight, Josh Wink came on 
around 2 and spun a really cool set.

Cool things: you could bring in water and food and stuff.  They didn't 
check ID.  Very little attitude was sported.  Cops were hospitable.

Not so cool things: the sound system seemed mudded up--as though they 
picked the wrong bass frequencies to boost, and it wasn't as crisp as it 
could have been.  Cost $20 to attend.  I guess this should be expected, 
since the location and the building were *great*, and there was plenty of 
security.  In the east, it seems that if you don't pay the cops enough 
"security tax" they shut you down even if you're legal.  Oh well...

Really cool things: met/saw more sfravers at one time than I ever have: 
John Shiple, Brian Behlendorf, Laura La Gassa, Cindy Kawakami, Mike 
Wertheim, Susan Kameny, and Philip...argh, forgot the last name.

I was walking my dog along the Point Richmond shoreline this afternoon.  On
my left side was the bay; on my right side was a fence.  On the other side
of the fence, there were rows of grey houses surrounded by green lawns.  I
came upon two girls who were standing on the other side of the fence, ages
about five and eight.  They were screaming at me:  "Let us in, let us in!"
I was suddenly perplexed by this strange request.  "But you are in," I
said,"I am outside."  They said, "No, we want in!"  I examined the gate
separating us.  It locked from both sides.  "Look," I said, pointing behind
me towards the bay, where clouds were hovering over the Golden Gate and
seagulls were soaring seemingly without care, "there's the bay.  The whole
world is out here, on this side of the fence."  They stood their ground.
"Well if you're outside," asked the older child, "how did you get outside?"
I had no answer for her.  Now I am full of doubt.

   Over the past year I've read a lot of messages about fast music vs 
slow music and house vs techno and MC's vs No MC's etc. etc.  and I've 
found it very surprising that very little is said about the energy levels 
at parties and the energy interaction between the DJ and the crowd.  Sure 
you can say "There was LOTS of energy there last night.."  But where 
exactly did the energy come from and what did it do.

   I'll start off with an example from Area 51.  Through the first 5 
hours, the music kept a steady "THUMPIN" pace which had the majority of 
the people in the big room dancing hard!  But by 3am I was beginning to 
tire and decided to chill in the bleachers and watch the crowd. Before 
Josh Winx went on the music was around 140bpm and was starting to wear 
people out.  I could see the crowd slowly wandering away from the 
dancefloor to find some place to relax.  Winx then got on and immediatley 
slowed things down.  The crowd slowly began to build up the group energy 
almost from scratch.  Winx was a prime example of a dj feeling the energy 
of the crowd, connecting himself to it, and then bringing the energy 
HIGHER through the music.  He brought the music down to the energy level 
of the crowd and then took everyone for an amazing ride.
  
   As I sat in my chair the music slowly began to pull 
me in and pump me with energy.  But it wasn't JUST the music.  It was the 
fact that the DJ was able to bring everyone to a common energy level and 
then bring them higher.  It was the crowds energy that was pulling me in 
to dance and it was the DJ who brought everyone to that level.

   It's this manipulation of energy that is more important then any 
tricks you can do as a DJ.  What I love about the SF scene is that so 
many people are open to share and accept the energy of their friends, 
fellow ravers and the DJ.  Some people feel the DJ should be in the 
background, just playing music for the people.  However, I think the DJ 
should be at a spot where he/she can connect with each and every person 
on the dancefloor.  Not necessarily on top of a high podium, but perhaps 
just 1 or two feet above the dance floor so they can see beyond just the 
front row of dancers.

   Well, that's all I've got to say about energy right now.  Just 
remember before making comments about music being too fast or too slow 
that it really doesnt make a difference when it's "in the mix..." :)

   Oh and I had an incredible time at Area 51.  Great music in both 
rooms, tons of smiles, WAY cool security (Christophe had my friend open 
his backpac at the entrance and my friend had over 100 blowpops inside.  
Christophe looked in and said"Oh! You're in dude! Get in there!") and I 
had the feeling that everyone there was a friend :) ... Btw, I was the 
guy wearing that big white puffy afro looking hat all night.

   Peace out and rave on and on and on and on and ... oo 

-Ernie "DJ Deaks"

The Aliens have landed in Richmond
             By
         Cap,n Crunch
         


I have but one thing to say,   "The Aliens have landed!!!" in 
"Area 51" a super Mega rave.    If you were transported into 
the middle of the main arena of Area 51,   and looked around,    
you would have thought you had been abducted by the little 
"Greys".    The insane visuals led one to believe they were in
this huge flying Saucer,  and looking up and all around you,  
were the slanted eyes of the alieans staring down at the main 
arena.     The smoke,   when combined with the lazers,  and 
the two huge Eyeballs with spinning spirals looking down 
at you,   would have certainly "Transported" you off this 
planet.

CDC's Sound system,  with it's huge 20 foot wide speaker banks 
certainly pinned your ears back.     In front,   the Wicked 
crew were craning up the most twisted jungle I ever thought 
possible.

Aliens of all types and sizes were waddling,   dancing,  and/or
floating across the huge Richmond Auditorium all night long.
The costumes were amazing....    "Ooops!   Didn't mean to
step on that.... Whatever you call that thing!!!"  The elevated 
shoes were literally out of this world,   as people wore 
tramboline shoes,  tentacles,   and other unknown apendages 
in the stranges places.

For theme and effects,   I have to hand it to the promoters,
that they did the most incredable rave of the year, that will
rival no equal in a long time to come.....

For me,    I literally left my body to be torn to schreds by the
awsome audio energy of DCD's speaker banks,   while my mind left
the solar system at warp 9 for the most intense interstellar
journey I thought possible.    Step aside,  Cap'n Kirk,  THIS
Captain is COMIN THROUGH!!,  being blown through the universe,
powered by the most insane hard acid,  I thought possible!!
Yow!!  I don't know what that Hard Acid trance DJ was in the 
SPAZ room,    but whoever he was,   he should be promoted to
Admiral.   Yowsa!!     

Earlier,  in the main room,  we were also treated to some excellent
hi-nrg hard trance,  which led to an extremly wide variety of
music from 123 - 160 BPMs and everything in between.

One hilight I thought mentioning....   As I was dancing,  just
GETTING INTO IT!!   I had this big shit eatin grin on my face
and this cop walks by,    and smiles and says....
says "How old are you?"  I say,  "old enough to be your father
and lovin every minute of it!"    He smiles back and shakes
his head and continues walking around.    Even the security
had smiles on their faces.

The Dj's wore the "Area 51" overalls and lab smocks,  and Carlos
who spun last,    played the "Close Encounters" sound track where
the huge saucer was "Communicating" through the musical notes..

FUCKIN BRILLIANT!!   Thats All I gotta say....  Carlos,   you'
*really* did it this time!!  Congrats on a wonderful ending....

"Would the person who parked his saucer please move it!!.... It's
blockin my shuttle craft!!

As I was rocketing through the Galaxy,   I've heard unconfirmed
reports that UFO experts were speaking in a spacey voice over the
Ambient music in a clever bit of brainwashing.

Many people approached me and said "You were in High Times!"
ANd I said "Oh!   Really?    What did they say?" Some reported
it talked about my attending the World Unity Festival in Arizona.

As I recall,   I remember quite well,  this writer,  trying to keep 
up with my constant moving around between the rave and the 
rainbow gathering,  and I had time to talk about a wide variaty
of things,   probably about raving.

If anyone happens to obtain a copy,   I certainly will want to
have a look at it.    (hint hint!)

Anyway,   I'm going to have this big fat grin on my face from
this "Alian encounter" for a very lojng time to come.    Somehow,
my mind managed to find what was left of my body,   thanx to some 
old acquaintences from AutoDesk.    Both are merged quite happily,
especially after about 3 hours of yoga and some blockage removals.
That hike to the waterfalls just put the icing on the cake.

Later...  Thanx for the wonderful party -  Carlos,  and to the tons
of SFRavers out there....

C. Crunch

The visuals were astounding with two laser banks, intellibeams ringing the
arena, a projector screen suspended from the roof over the center of the
arena where some very beautiful montages were constructed using a bank of
twelve slide projectors.  Nice murals in the chill room.

Josh Wink was awsome and I always dig Carlos.  Wicked was in the back
vibrating bolts out of the supports.  There was a nice little electric
sign that scrolled out the DJ's name so I could tell who was spinning
without having to squirm my way up front.

There were lots of cops and security, but they seemed to only wander the
halls giving people the privacy they need.  No ID check, simple backpack
search, and a question about if I was packing markers or paint.  Sent me
a wierd message at first, "We don't care who gets killed, but don't fuck
with the building."

There were concessions, but they weren't over priced.  A $1 for a small
water bottle and a $1 for a shot of expresso (good expresso too).  It
sent me the message that CDC et. al. wasn't milking the vendors for a
lot of money (if any).

I was real happy with the sound quality throughout the building.  Even
better, it was possible to hold a conversation in the hallways without
shouting,

Managed to connect with lots of regulars and a few new folks.

The best massive I've ever been to and I wasn't even on drugs.

Ciao,

1. Carlos. This man coold have lit up all of Richmind with his energy. 
2. Incredible lack of gangsta vibes, and lots of security presence 
without gestapo techniques.
3. Wicked's bass bins, which were going so far into the sub-bass in the 
latter of the jungle sets that I swear my pants were floating off of my 
body, riding on a standing wave. Or maybe the resonant frequency of denim 
is close t0 20 hz.
4. That crazy acid/breakbeat monster that was probably heard four times 
that evening- Josh closed his set with it and Christophe gave up after 
four attempts to find a record to start his set on that would mix, so he 
went with the beatless MLK speech. (or so it appeared). P.S. It's a 
Strictly Rhythm test pressing, for all you fellow trainspotters.
5. Christophe's MLK "I have a dream..." recording, and the crowd response.
6. The eerie laughing song....
7. Wicked's jungle sets. 
8. Visuals. Lasers. Alien Heads. Lasers. Intellibeams. Lasers. Lasers. 
Lasers.
9. A great multifaceted crowd, especially those klub kids with the 
platforms (xtra props to the one with the flashing shoelaces). Also the 
breakdancers- especially the ones working the circle in the second jungle 
set.
10. Leaving at 7am to *clear skies* and a beautiful sunrise, after a week 
of dismal weather, especially up here.

I saw a picture for a 5-watt radio transmitter distributed by Free Radio
Berkeley in the new issue of Colors and I became very interested.

Being a SoCal-Raver myself, I figgered some helpful soul resonating to the same
frequency up North might be able to help me out.  Can anyone tell me how to get
in touch with F.R.B.?

assistance truly appreciated,
paul

I must say that as far as massives go, this was pretty good on production,
though a little low on Vibe (but I think that will improve with time)
Carlos is "old school" and I'm sure that as long as he is at the helm, 
everything will be alright and people will be taken care of.

As far as the main room is concerned, it is the best use of the space
that I have seen since the first Unity Massive benefit for Mal.
(but I didn't go to Phuture so I don't know)

This is how an all ages event should be, low on attitude, lots of smiles and
a reasonable amount of good music for your money.  I wished that there had
been more people dancing and less galking but maybe that will pick up
next time (and I hope there will be a next time).  The newbies that did come
to this event came ready to rave and they definitely seem to want to learn
what its all about, it's up to the "vets" amongsts us to share the vibe and
get them on the right track :)  This would be a nice theme to
continue, maybe at an outdoor location in the summer or at Burning Man
in the Nevada desert at labor day.

Oh Yes! and Josh Wink played Acieeeeed!!!!

I am still recovering from Area 51... 

I had a great time. I must admit, Josh Wink and Dutch rocked.

Dutch even played "Planet of Drums." woohoo.

Now I gotta learn how not to lose my ear plugs at raves.

I sometimes wonder how many spoiled brats guest lists have created. As I
was entering the Richmond High School, uh Civic Auditorium I overheard "The
$10 list [I don't get in for free?], oh that's great - where's Dutch -
we'll see how well he plays with broken fingers." On the other hand,
security were non-intrusive and the ticket people were friendly.

I'd never been to the Civic before. It's ok, but I kept thinking I was at a
hockey game with all those seats. You could lose about a thousand people in
there.

Wandering into the main hall I immediately wished I had some ear plugs.
Loud, loud, loud, although it did make most objects vibrate, a neat effect.
Dutch was playing some fairly hard trance when I arrived around 12, hoping
to catch Taylor's set. Evidently he was bumped to 11. Drat. Ran into Brian
Behlendorf, Cindy, Laura and Mike Wertheim rather quickly, which was
surprising considering he number of people who I looked for all night and
never found.

Simon was spinning in the Wicked area, where the sound was bearable, good
even, with tighter bass than the "whoommm" of the big room. Pretty good
music here. Markie comes on and drops the jungle. Decent jungle stuff, but
he didn't really mix it which is weird, as he mixes house just fine.
Impressive bass, though. I'd kinda like to see a real jungle party in the
UK. Major kudos to Markie here for causing the gigantic, floor consuming
breakdance circle to disintegrate before he went back into standard Wicked
house fare.

The SPAZ area was set up like an ambient room, with blankets everywhere and
people laying down, but every time I went in there they were playing trance
or techno.

The visuals were great. Excellent Intellabeam programming, and decent
lasers. Plus computer projections, and no less than 18 slide projectors.
Almost overstimulated. There was even a laser in the Wicked area as well.
Cool alien heads were strung up over the seats, and there was a Schwa booth
for your abduction pleasure. Over the top was the guy with the LED suit on.
Go for it!

Josh Wink played mid-tempo acid and trance for the most part, but picked
things up towards the end of his set with some really nice acid tunes.
Cristophe continued on the same track, adding some classics to the mix and
moving things a little bit housier. Carlos closed things with his
scratching, cutting style.

Question: There was a song that both Wink and Carlos played with a 303
going crazy over a funky 808 beat. It also a vocodered voice saying
something, and a non vocodered sample saying "Get on up" or "Feel the
groove," or something else along those lines. Please, does anybody know
what this is?

It was a big rave.

Joe

Excellent point. I was tired of the big room myself and when I went back in
after Wink started playing I ended up staying for the rest of the night.

That song that both Josh Wink and Carlos played is called Watch Me
Now by Grooveyard.  I think just about every DJ out there has bought
it now, big buzz on it.  Has a Run DMC sample on it that gets the
crowd jammin.  It's a available at Primal Records in Berkeley if
anyone wants it...  Had a blast on Saturday, hope everyone else did
too...

Nope, that's not it. I know that one, although I don't recall hearing it on 
Sat. This one is straight up 303 going crazy, trying to tune in some
extraterrestrial radio station.

Do you mean the song that had that wacked out twisted distorted
	"higher state of consciousness"?  Wink played that, and I would
like to know what it was...

Jack,

     I don't know if it is close enough for you but in San Jose the place for
all your vinyl needs is Solid Grooves on Bascom near San Carlos.  They have
12"s and CDs of Acid Jazz, and the all encompassing House genre.

408 999-0259  for more info

I'm so glad you all got to experience Josh Wink (not winx)...he's easily 
one of the best dj's in the world and it's a shame it took this long for 
SF to discover him. On the east coast you can see him on a nearly weekly 
basis...the real shame is that SF is so closed-minded. Yes, there's tons 
of good talent here but i think being such a closed scene hurts SF. Go 
see Justin Robertson and Paul Bleasdale at the Dust Brothers show on 
Thursday and see what i mean...there are incredible dj's from all over 
the world, and they go everywhere but here. Scott Henry from Baltimore, 
Sasha from London, Terry Mullan from Chicago. Kimball Collins from 
Orlando...if i had the money i'd throw a party with dj's from everywhere, 
just to show this city a taste of the incredible talent that is out there....

Weekend report coming up, but first, help needed...

My friend Rich, promoter of Kundalini, is throwing another one Feb 3.  He
has a venue lined up (not the Troc) but the venue owner will only allow 18+
and an ending time of 6 a.m.  Rich wants an all ages place that can go until
dawn.  If anyone knows of such a place, please let me know.  All suggestions
will be passed on to him.  In any case, I hope to see you all at what will
be another great party!

I started out Friday night at the Crash Worship show.  I don't like the
promoter(Terminator, a heavy metal club) or the venue (B.A.R.S.-129
Carolina).  Started out great with the room stuffed full of dancers and
luckily very little moshing.  Still a little too much testosterone for me,
I'd love to see Crash Worship at a rave instead of a metal or industrial
show.  I was already sweaty when a CW "helper" who was carrying a big jug
dumped the liquid over the crowd's heads.  I drank it up, thinking it was
water-it was vegtable oil!  Yuk!  Anyways, it made a great lubricant for the
nearly bare dancers in the crowded room.  B.A.R.S. tried to shut the show
down repeatedly - gee, didn't they know that CW uses fire and fireworks?
The band refused to stop, and the crowd was just getting more fired up.  I
wasn't prepared for a us vs. them situation, but much of the crowd loved it.
After power was cut off, the band continued their percussive attack among
the crowd.  When security tried to clear the floor, CW brought out their ace
in the hole - the guitarist was carrying a megaphone on his head and and
amplifier on his back, and was somehow firing thousands of sparks 20 feet
towards the security people, creating more mayhem.  (Nobody got burned too
bad this time though).  The band then continued playing out in the street,
despite the rain and the arrival of several squad cars.  Overall, I would
rather have had more of a sensual vibe, but it was pretty fun.  

Capn Crunch clued me in to a party being put on by Mr. Floppy, so I checked
it out next.  It was in a loft downtown.  There were lots of blacklights and
day-glo decorations (the stars looked familiar-same ones from the
Flophouse?), and the music was purely trance.  About half the small crowd
was dancing ( and dancing very well), the rest were on the floor in deep
meditation.  I danced.

Sat... Q-Zar!  What fun!  Great exercise too.  The only SFRavers were Purple
Tiger and me, unfortunately, but there were lots of other people there to
play with.  Then, on to Area 51.  Out of this world!  Josh Wink launched me
into orbit when he first slowed the beat down to a crawl, then sped it up to
hundreds of BPMs!  Or was it my imagination... ;^)  It was after the song
with the loud crunching guitar sounds... I think...  My sense of time was
distorted that night, the greys must have got to me...  Later, I looked at
my watch, it said 4:30 but it was in fact 5:30-where did that hour go?  I
checked myself for incisions, but couldn't find any...  Those grey devils
must have very advanced surgical examination techniques...  Luckily, I
brought along my bouncy moon shoes to help me readjust to earth's gravity.
I do wish to return to Area 51 someday.  Calling occupants of
interplanetary, quite extraordinary craft!

Enough silliness...

David

Got this off of alt.rave.  Many of you probably saw it but for those who
didn't I thought I might share it.  This isn't in response to anything, or
directed at anyone.  I just thought it was cool and something to keep in
mind, cause this is what we started doing it for in the first place.  I'm
not really a Moby fan and never really have been, but I don't question the
fact that he's a real person and his heart is in the right place:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

as uncool as it might be, raving is a special thing, a phenomenally 
special thing.  hundreds of people celebrating communaly, uplifted, 
transcendent...
that's why the sad unhealthy state of rave culture is so completely 
fucking depressing.  to watch something so wonderful become something 
gross is a tragedy.
and we're all to blame, really.  and we can all work to make things 
healthy if we want to.
i say-bring back happiness, joy, transcendent celbration, naive wonder, 
respect, and positivity.
dj's-stop playing boring records that no one cares about.  stop trying to 
'educate' people and concentrate more on making people happy.
happiness is a lot more valid than jaded bitterness.
oh well, there's my two cents.

In the next couple of days if you have web access I encourage you to 
check out the flyer that I am going to put up in a few minutes.  It's an 
informational flyer called Raves and the Law.  I picked it up at Friends 
and Family and really liked it.  It is done anonymously but I imagine the 
author would love it if people would copy it and give it out to those who 
it may concern.  
Look at the home page below or go direct to 
http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~drenalin/ravelaw.html

On another note does anyone know where to get a hold of Dan Mapes or 
Cyberlab 7 in San Francisco.  I woud also like to find Pacific and MESS 
if anyone knows where they are on the Internet....thanks

I think you're talking about Josh Wink's new single on Stricly Rhythm. The 
name escapes me right now, but it should be out in three weeks.

I took a peek at it when Carlos was warming up the soundsystem during the 
setup. It was on Strictly Rhythm and it was a test pressing. Thats all I 
could find out about it. Go0od luck in tracking it down.

I was at the Sunday night show at Berkeley square. This was the first
"show" I've ever been to so I didn't know what to expect other than
massive weirdness, which I got. It was split between watchers & do'ers
like most parties, but there seemed to be a higher % of do'ers who were
realy "doin' it" I released myself much more than I could at any possible
rave. It was both very different & similar to a rave. Similar in that you
were going after your primal desires to release/dance to trance-inducing
music, the *big* difference being that their alot more hardcore about it.
The floors & people were covered with all sorts of slippery goo so that
you would slip down if there weren't so many people around you, so
everbody was bumping into eachother, which at first I didn't like the idea
of, but I think it brought the crowd together. Lot's of *fire*, it was
very exciting to be dancing & have some guy blow a huge fireball past you.
I definatley recomend the experience to anybody who likes to go of *realy*
hard. Got to see familiar faces Mark A, Tracy & Donavon and made the
mistake of going to some party afterwards thinking that we still had
energy, since afterall it was only 2am.

Good idea, Simon!

But I think Sean had a safe idea too with the recommendation of one of
those thin-type thermometers.  They are about the size of thumb and the
thickness of a few pieces of paper.  Its the same type of material that is
now built into those  battery voltage testers that are built into the
batteries' package.

If you really want to see infinity, try cutting a slit in one of the mirrors.

There was an article in the Sunday 1/15/95 SF Chronicle about pirate radio in SF
and Berkeley. They didn't give an address for Free Radio Berkelely, but mentioned
that a group called the Free Communications Coalition had a web page somewhere
out there in digital space. Web search time. Haven't had time to check it out
yet.

Good luck, and let me know what you find out!

I'm _never_ going back to that place.  No running water so you had to pay
$1 for those tiny bottles, and you had to 'relieve' yourself in porta-potties
with the tops chopped off.  Plus the PA kept cutting in and out all night,
and bouncers called the police -- like anything was going to happen that
hadn't already.  As if that weren't enough, they sprayed Halon into a room
full of people, nearly suffocating many (which is how Halon works, by binding
oxygen so the fire can't burn).

Maybe that place up near Willits that PW used?  Outdoors, plenty of space
for a bonfire, a place to crash afterwards in the sun, mud baths, beautiful.
They'd be a great centerpiece for another weekend of raving up there...

	I have to disagree.  I saw both the BARS and Berkeley Square
shows.  Berkeley Square has a reputation for kick-ass Crash Worship
shows, and it was, but the BARS space was clearly superior.
It was just so much bigger, there was more room on the dance
floor to find your particular grove.  The extra space afforded
by the chill-out-style rooms were also a major bonus; IMHO they
added about as much a rave-style feel as you'll be able to get.
Since the point seemed to be to click into the tribal thing with
everyone around you (which certainly was happening at *both*), too
much more space might not be a good idea.  People need to be close
and personal, but not crushed together precariously over the fires.
The BARS space seemed to be exactly right for the size of the crowd.

Those were my first two Crash Worship shows -- Needless to say, I'm a 
convert.

Mijos! I have missed you guys SO MUCH! I was shut off for so long because
of some bullsh*t financial shuffling here at UC. But now, it's all over.
Tho I did piddle on the UC net administrator's car door. 

Twice, just to be safe.

Whoa! Area 51 teaches me yet another lesson: my fear of tolerance makes me
space out my X, but then it hits me like madonna's virgin again stuff, and
my ass is floored. Don't get me wrong, you get to learn a lot about your
ass when this happens. I swear, I could sit on a flyer AND READ IT thru my
overalls and a thick blanket, I just couldn't get the colors right.

Anyone who saw Ernie (the guy with the black shirt and BIG eyes) x-ing for
the first time there knows why this is such a wonderful chemical. His
tearless-cry realization of joy that "you're ALL so beautiful!!!" was
truely the chill-room highlight of the party. This dude is coming for more,
I'll bet...

At the 7-11, right after the party, I got to hear the NY style cashier
explain to those convenience store pixies (you know, those guys that hang
at the 'levin in the mornings? Where DO they come from? Where do they go?)
what a rave was:
                    (read with that east-coast whine)
"Yeah, these kids came from that party. Good kids, the lot of 'em. The cops
know about it, no problem at all. Crazy, they are. Dancin all night long,
they go in at 10, they stay till the morning. Music, dancing, no fights, no
alcahol, (shrugs his shoulders, increases pitch) no drugs...." and then I
buy an all rubber pacifier and a slushy......

Me and Infinity and some non-sfravers got this idea up on the overlook in
the Berkeley hills: a few weeks ago, we all met spontaneously on twin peaks
after Kundalini, and I always drag people along to chill for an hour or so.
As my Slacks Acieed and Pimp Coat contrasted with serene beauty of the Bay,
we thought "aHa! Let's do a CD-ROM of 'Milton's after rave spots'" but
seriously, most of us should have taken the time to stick around later. 

Shure, lots of us went to the after party or chilled with friends, but we
should try to set up a spot right up close to the place, so sleepy/spun
drivers and there precious payload of life can sort it out for an hour or
so, and all that unity that we exclaimed all night sticks around for real.
Solidify your new-found friendships. So, my curfew line will carry
after-party info from now on, if possible. And it will accept all
contibutions. E-yeah, could be.....


Just had to get that all out of me system.

Lotsa love,
 Milton and you know who!

ps. Thank you Cloud Factory for B-sitting my E-Bee.....she thanks you all....

just like anytying there are good mc's and bad mc's. the british 
hardcore/jungle culture is built around them. i've heard some great mc's 
and i've heard people who i've wanted to slap. :) Bad mc's generally 
big-up themselves (say self-promoting things) too damn much. Good mc's 
big up the crowd. and good mc's know when to shut up.
i've had some of my best experiences ever mc'ing with a crowd - t's like 
an exchange of energy, i feed off how the crowd reacts...if the crowd 
doesn't like the music, then i have trouble doing a good job. But there 
have been moments (which i luckily have one of on tape) where me, the 
music and the crowd clicked (i used to mc solely for a jungle dj named 
dieselboy)...and it's pure magic. 

My next gig is in Allentown, PA at an all-jungle party called Bass 
Rush...it's my first plane gig. :)

i think that mc's only really go with hardcore or faster music like 
jungle/darkside and old-school UK hardcore...(my favorite)
i've mc'd to house and it works if it's of the extremely-happy variety 
but otherwise i woun'dt welcome an mc in a trance or acid set. :)

i ddon't think you get the whole gist of mc's....they don't stand up 
there and shout about how bad they are and 'rap' like you'd think (the 
only mc's i've seen do this were american and nuff said about that). The 
role of mc is one to help the crowd feel it, to get everyone pumped and 
into the music. Granted, this doesn't really work with more 
trance-inducing musics, as i stated in my last post....i guyess you need 
to experience it to understand it...

That's just Frankie bones being himiself..nothing to do with real 
mc's....he's always done that (ask east coast people about the jokes that 
went around), and it's always got on everyone's nerves except the 
brooklynites....unfortunately the party i'm booked to MC at in April 
features Frankie Bones. I think i'll let him mc his own set...

 hiphop mc's are a completely different story. I see hiphop mc's as being

Which F&F were you intrested in?

>From the last one we have Jeyson, Lee's, And Ethan's sets. Too bad we don't
have it all but our recordists just *had* to dance, of course it was also
their birthday :)

As far as previous F&F's we have loads more but in a variety of different
hands. General organization, set selection, and production financing keep
getting in the way...  :)

However given that from the last F&F we have 3 good sets we've been
considering releasing those. I'm happy with my set, Lee is happy with his,
Jeyson what say you?

take it easy

	Yea, they play tribal, but not what a raver would normally think of
as tribal -- it isn't techno.  It's a couple guys taking turns beating on
drums, wailing, spitting fire, building fires on the dance floor, throwing 
various substances onto the scantily-clan masses, and other general mayhem.
They're not so much a band as performance artists who need the audience 
for the show.  The real nice thing is that they seem to mix the community 
spirit of a rave with the intensity and sexuality of something much more 
hardcore.

 Hello, this is Dutch of CDC Sound System. This is a formal apology
to Steve Sawyer. Steve, we at CDC are very sorry about the events
that took place last saturday at our show. As some of you know,
Steve Sawyer was overwhelmed by the SPAZ techno set in the "so called"
ambient room. This, I assure you, was not our intention. Steve, you
are welcome to join us at any of our parties in the future.

 Please accept our apology.

damn right mike, I heard some american shit mc on this tape my friend has 
from some rave on the east coast and I can see why they have such a bad 
name. But some parties in England that I went to last year took me to 
another dimension. Dreamscape in particular was the biggest rave I ever 
went to in my life, massive, what a trip that was. Also Revelation on new 
year's blew my mind. Although, it was a shame I missed Begin Again as 
lots of fellow ravers were there :oe

	The scene in the UK is very different and always has been ever 
since the first acid/house parties in early eighties. It would be impossible 
to pull of some the events they have in the UK here and I am not sure 
if they would be appriciated anyway. The commercial raves here attract 
the wrong type of people and generally get a bad rep for fights, bad 
drugs, etc and usually get busted anyway - so much for the right to 
peaceably assemble -

........but that's off the subject anyway, I agree that mc's are 
sometimes key in getting the crowed pumped but whether or not they would 
go down well on the SF scene is another story altogether.

I;'ve just heard an excellent tape of MC Mikebee and DJ Dieselboy and
can assure that mikebee knows whereof he speaks :)

I'm against having the kind of MCs who have nothing really to say except
"get it on for DJ . . ."  The old reggae style MC (Tommy Cowan, etc.)
is a good approach, as are the better hardcore/jungle ones.  But opinions
on this are not universal anywhere, there recently was some disagreement
on uk-dance among the net.punters about MCs there.

It gets down to the same old thing, below par DJs and below par MCs are
wack, good ones are worth it!

The Well is hosting its 100th monthly "WOP" (Well Office Party) this
Friday, the 20th, at the Presidio Yacht Club at the foot of the
Golden Gate Bridge at the north (Sausalito end).  If you're on the
Well, or if you're just interested and would like to meet some of the
people who are active here, you're welcome to attend.  It starts at
7 pm and generally finishes up just before midnight.

obsfraves, we're having what I call the first Well DJ Relay, with
four Well based-DJs spinning da toonz.  It won't be a very big or
overly loud system, and we're kinda not sure how it will go over with
the Well crowd, but we're part of the culture of the Well too, so it
could be interesting!  The Well is home to the "house conference,"
co-hosted by M Normal (miga@well.sf.ca.us), where we are currently
among other things debating the cosmic meaning of "rave culture" with
none other than Fraser Clark.

Anyway, the lineup is: M (miga) playing ambient, Gil (tow) probably doing
house, Bob Bickford (rab) doing '60s and '70s, and then me (phred)
finishing with house and trance.  

It's basically  a loose potluck, so bring something drinkable or eatable
to share if you like (but it's not required).  

If you need specific directions, I'll be happy to email them.

c u in the future!

...Picking up on this hyperthermia thread, I'm currently investigating the 
risks of heat strain in clubs/raves.  In a replication of a clubs thermal
environment a couple of subjects danced for an hour to some excellent house
tunes....their oral temperature increased by 0.1oC every 15 mins, and in the
hour they lost 1kg in weight.  When I bunged the results into a computer
model, the prediction was they'd be dead after 4 hours from heat stroke.....

Continuing my research, I'm interested in behaviour in raves, I'm sure your
scene is not that different from ours in the UK...... So if you have a free
minute, and don't mind answering a few questions......

Cheers,

Hey gang,

     There has been a change in the line-up for tonight...  Instead of Garth,
John Howard will be playing with Mark Farina.  
     Oh, and I goofed last time I posted.  The price of admission is $3 before
11 with invite, and $5 otherwise.  Derek, could you change this on the weekly
list so I don't get smacked  8*(   

Peace and I hope to see ya there... 

             Tamotsu

apologies for coming in late on this thread ...
but what are you people talking about?

when I went to a movie mega-rave in LA there
was some "give it up for so and so, come on LA" mc'ing
but this seemed about on par for that party

I've never heard any "yippee yippee we're all on e" 
motivational shoutouts either - but that sure doesn't
sound too inspiring!

So this is an east coast / uk phenom?
And it goes on constantly through the whole party?

Indulge me, my fantasies about early rap - ny sugarhill
underground dance parties - hot and sweaty all night
and then like your fave morning dj, the funky four 
or lady b get on the mic and *Take You Home*

This would be like the Power of a well-timed Diva
(Afrohead makes me move) and can be deadly if overused
Now most of this that works for me has an emotional hook
with some bravado and sex thrown in for good measure
even your basic keep on truckin

But what sends me running for the door are the super-cheesy
secret rave planet samples.  Oooh Aaah, we're not in a gymnasium
we have transported.  Don't get me wrong.  I like fantasy in a
party - I just think the Worst techno/rave/house samples
I've heard had this type theme.  Painfully corny.	

This would be my fear of an MC.
Can one person, with words, touch everyone?
There is such an unspoken understanding - a common presence -
but approached from Vastly Different Head Spaces by the party attendees. 
One persons rock'n'roll goof is anothers peak experience.

And aren't you taking away or diminishing the
role of Everyone At the party to Make the party by having a
single leader?  Does everyone still get to be a Superstar??
Are we an Audience or the Truly Fabulous ??!!

Dave

Mijos, answer me personally:
 who is your favorite, and who should really be Dorothy's favorite:
 a. the scarecrow
 b. the tin-man
 c. the cowardly lion
 d. toto

Now, only one counts, and yes, we are within the bounds of lady D's
perceived innocence (no wild combinations, we're talkin who would dorothy
hang with in the chill room on E and spend some Q-time with, if it had to
be only one of them.) 

Put yerself in her Ruby slippers and title it "QuestII" and I'll post the
results and discuss. Hard-nosers and anal-retentives need not apply (that
excludes all the two of you) :)

Tenku!

Mijos, I feel that I must discuss this. It is a condition which can cause
great discomfort in those around you.

 
Goes sumthin' like  theees:
Okay, yer on the "elevator go up" mode 40 mins after taking yer Disco
Biscuit, and as the peak is very obvious and you do the 140bpm
jerk-n-twitch, all that water wants out. 
                           So you oblige.
Now, spun out of yer head, you somehow make it here to the gender
discriminatory room with the tile and ceramic display. Others are enjoying
the wonders of the sink and that "oh, so dashing" person in the mirror, but
you-oh youuuu!-have one thing on your mind. So, you strut and skip in time
to the beat right into the aforementioned release-zone, and as you clench
your fists into tiny balls of joy, you do the cabbage-patch and exclaim "I
gotta boogie pee! E-hee!" and pop into the stall.

Here's the wonder. You stare at it for 2 minutes, you concentrate, and
suddenly, like a fuse on fire, a trickle winds away inside you, and
suddenly you moan at the top of yer lungs:
 "OH GOD YES! YES! OH! GOD YES! SO FUCKIN' GOOD! OH! MAN, THAT'S SOOOO GOOD!"
The discomfort will be noted if you look down and see the feet in the stall
next to you shuffle closer to the toilet and farther away from the
division. 

I apologize to any who may have been disturbed by me  at area 51. Me and IT
have not had so much fun doing our basic work in so long. If you can't
handle it, wear ear plugs to the loo. Know wud ahm sayin'?

ah, BTW,  happens to both sexes. Enjoy that tract, folks.

Always willing to share, 
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

Did anyone else see THEM? I met Xanthor, can't remeber its system, but the
planet is something like NTOOTTTLOIIAS ("No, That One Over There, To The
Left, Or Is It A Satellite? Damn, I'm too high to point it out.") so it'll
e-mail me later.

poor Xanthor, decided to "come out" and tell us about its planet, but
Xanthor  got handed some bunk E last week, and got all pissed about it and
tried to hunt down the guy  for a refund, but he was gone by 3 am. So
Xanthor and I found some Black Lics and a hit of Felix, and we sat in the
chill room and talked some. It said those T-shirts were sort of racist, it 
really felt the shirts were really sexist, representing only one of the
several reproductive states they assume, and that the organs were not drawn
on (they got these thingies with-oh, I'm not supposed to tell). I gave
Xanthor a back rub, when it tried to reciprocate, its finger suckers kept
getting stuck to my skin, so we had to use some massage gloves from
Faralon7. Xanthor said there are some people from its planet that are
really backwards and that they keep abducting people and have elvis
somewhere, and that they do cooperate with the US govt, but only as a sort
of inside joke, sorta the down side of extreme evolution, a weird sense of
humor. The rest just come down for some partying. 
  Last year it spent new year's with the Kamaaji tribe of dolphins near
Maui, and the year before with Rasim beavers in Oregon. They were kinda
cheerful but dull, but the dolphins were really cool. I hadn't done that
yet, but it didn't call me a newbie or anything.  I got a flier from it
about the Spider Monkey Funk-E Fest in Belize this March, but I can't read
it anymore, it just looks like a piece of bark with teeth marks. 
  It had this thing they take like we do E, and I tried it, he calls it
"general positive/compassionate attitude" and once you trip on it, you can 
bring it up again, anytime, anyplace, and feel the same as you did the
first time. Seems like one dose will do you for good. So they give it out
free where it comes from. I was sooo lucky it had lots on it. It's still
legal here in California, but lotsa people have a problem with it.
 At first on its planet, long time ago, there was a group that wanted to
restrict it, but there was so much, that everyone got some and then it was
pointless to do anything but take it as well. All I could say was "Wow!
Right on!" and gave it a hug again.

Me and Xanthor went back to dance, and let me tell you, this is one funky
alien. It didn't even make fun of me dancing, it knows how sensitive I can
get, and it really enjoyed the main room, especially Carlos. It likes
little guys with big smiles that hop around a lot.

Both an eager female  and I tried to get it on with Xanthor later on during
sunday, but we couldn't figure it out plus the how-and-who and  there's a
problem with those thingies they have down there-oops, gotta keep that to
ourselves.....

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the Stardusted E-Bee.....


"So what do we do with this?"
"ouch! Anything but that, you stupid humans, sheesh!"
                  -Xanthor learning top say "sheez!"

Well there's this widdle theory that 'e' makes us males lose our 
aggressive masculine side and enhances our female sensitive side.
And it's true... our better, female, side does emerge!!!!!!

However.. from a physical, not psychological, point of view it also
allows us to experience something else that we as mere males are not
privy to!

Imho, pe'E'eing must be what a female orgasm feels like (with respect to 
all females here)
Ur whole body feels the warmth and excitement...it's phuchin awesome!
it's a high point in any good rave nite..:)

Someone was DAT'ing the event, but you'll probably have to talk to the 
promoters to find out who/where.

Now for an interesting question, how do I get in contact with the 
promoters. I don't even remember who they were. I just remember they were 
an audio company and had initials like CDC or something similiar. Any 
help would be appreciated.

Plus, does anyone know anything about this Saturday's Nag Champa? It 
sounds, how do you say, 'enticing'

COMMENTS TO THIS MESSAGE SHOULD BE ALSO FORWARDED TO ME DIRECTLY, SINCE 
I'LL BE LOGGING OFF FOR A BIT.  :) THANKS...

but it seems like more parties are starting to "pop up".  I mean, area 
51 comes to mind, indonesia here in santa cruz, um, like i don't know, 
but i checked the calendar and there are all these massive looking things 
happening.  does this mean more access for us ravers to cool parties, or 
is this mostly just the same ol same ol taking our money and running 
bit.  i don't know, i just hope this rave thing won't become all tOO 
commercial and stuff...

well, happy guavas and nectarines, all...

All I know about Area 51's DAT'ing was that I saw a deck behind the dj 
table with it's meters jumping--meaning it was recording or paused for 
recording.

If you're really interested, perhaps a call to one of the info lines 
would help?

Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

There's a party called "Atomicon" (put on by Atomic?) that boasts "Techno,
Jungle, Gabber, Hard Acid, Hardcore, House" (according to the flyer).
Friday, Jan 20.  1-415-337-4236.  I don't know why no one has mentioned it,
anybody know who's behind it?

Amazing coincidence.  My friend Mark the Lawyer picked me up at the
Oakland airport on Wednesday morning and we were eating breakfast at
this little place just south of University on San Pablo in Berkeley,
I looked up and DJ Polliwog was just leaving the restaurant, she said
she'd just come in from the FMR which was somewhere nearby  . . .

I had all but given up on Wicked doing another full moon at least until 
spring. I call the Wicked line to find out about the Dust Brother Show 
and the person on the voicemail thanks all those that came out to the 
Full Moon. Who the hell went? Where was it at? I am usually in the know 
about Full Moons. But the one month out of the past six I decide to not 
even ask about it, THERE'S A FULL MOON PARTY!!  
	Will someone who went fill us in. Or for that matter anyone hear 
anything about it?

Dear Sfraves;

	Hi; Tuesday night my x-housemate beat the grap out of me. I have 
a broken orbit(eye socket); a couple of pulled cervical(neck) muscles, 
and cuts and bruses. Why, he's an alcoholic and did it while he was in a 
black out. The reason I'm posting this is that I'm scared. I got a 
restraining order placed against him, and am currently hold up here in my 
10x10 room with my computer; and my two siamese cats Ernesto Kitty and 
Archemedes. I've only been here in Cali for about 3 months and really 
don't know that many people. I'm scared he going to get drunk again and 
come back here with something more than his fists. I have no other place 
unfortuately to go except public shelters and I fiqured I'll take my 
chances here. I'm looking for a new home before the restraining order runs 
out on the 9th of Febuary. It really hurts to eat; but the painkillers 
thay gave me help; at least there's a bright side to this; refering to the 
painkillers. So any kind words; suggestions or whatever would help. I 
don't think I will make it to a show this weekend due to the my current 
situation. But I hope to at least be at Community next Wed. I would hate 
to have to let someone elses problem break my spirit.

Yup!, after Doc went completely balistic at Move we headed on down to the
FMR @ the Berkeley Aquatic Park (not the marina) It was definatley the
smallest full moon I've ever been to, about 50 people, it started kinda
slow but I ended up having a blast despite the lack of dancers. Many props
to Garthy for playing the entire party, almost 6 hours, probably the best
set I've heard him play w/ plenty of acid-house. Being the sicko that I
am, I have a wonderfull opertunity to play a Stanford E-party friday night
for 6+ hours. Just what does the evil unknown have planned for those
unsuspecting brown-spotted frat boys? :)

 yipes!  Hang in there, dude.  Perhaps with all the people on this list
we can help you find a new place.  Definitely do everything in your power
to keep yourself safe.  I would recommend changing the locks and/or getting
a padlock and latch to make sure that this character doesn't have key
access to your pad.  I will keep my eyes open for places and will post
anything I find to the list... whatever you do, don't blame yourself, it's
not your fault.

you're missing the point. it's not about 'leading the party' or focussing 
attention on the MC...the MC helps keep the crowd in a dancing 
frenzy....it's so difficult to understand unless you've actully 
experienced it..

The Full Moon went off without a hitch Tuesday night/Wednesday Morning.
The Mappoint was the Move weekly at 181 Eddy.  This is a really nice party,
in a really dodgy neighborhood, "Rock Lobsters" milling around and openly
lighting up their glass crack pipes (yow!).  It's interesting to note that
there were no "gangsters" at this party, I guess the neighborhood is too
rough for them. There was lotsa Vibe, Josh followed by Doc Martin 
who ripped it up like the ol' days.

The party let out at 3 and everyone (including the doorman who said that Move
was his first exposure to "rave" culture but that he liked what he saw) went
over to a well known spot in Berkeley (not the marina!) where Garth played for
5+ hours, some really good shit!.  This was the smallest FMR that I have
seen in a while, no more than 50 people or so, but it was really nice and
intimate, A little cold but we kept each other warm with smiles, dancing and
music.

This is a really nice party,
in a really dodgy neighborhood, "Rock Lobsters" milling around and openly

there were no "gangsters" at this party, I guess the neighborhood is too
rough for them. There was lotsa Vibe, Josh followed by Doc Martin
who ripped it up like the ol' days.
-------------------

As a longtime tenderloin resident (10 + years), I can verify the availability
of "Rock Lobsters" in and around the 181 (this was an ultra-funky night
spot back in the early-mid 80's as well, but that's another story...).  I
suspect the reason that there are "no gangsters" at the 181 is primarily
due to the fact that they're too busy selling rocks to bother with dancing.

I would be careful of how you deal with the neighborhood; not to cause undue
alarm but some caution is advised.  I am actually moving away from this hood
which I have considered home for some time because of the escalation of rock
related bullshit, violence included.  The cocaine problem in the tenderloin
has been skyrocketing out of control and has been having a number of bad side
effects.  While for the most part, if you keep to yourself, you will be fine,
it's worthwhile to keep your wits about you when in the vicinity of the 181.
I strongly recommend that those who are not in complete control of their
faculties NOT wander around in this neighborhood.

The worst thing about the tenderloin these days, is not, however, the local
residents, junkies and dealers, it's unfortunately the police.  I am moving
basically because of a misunderstanding between myself and a pair of corrupt
undercover police who I mistook for Johns/junkies and ordered out of the way
of my front door one night coming home from work.  They decided to step out
of their undercover personas just long enough to rough me up for "interfering"
in their "operation" which just happened to be blocking my front door.  The
serious thing is that if something like this happens there is no recourse you
can take and these guys are worse thugs than any of the rest of the local
criminals; they are simply another gang, with the exception that they have
the city behind them.  Since this incident I have had several windows in my
car broken which they recognized from the incident in front of my house and
while I am rich enough to replace the glass and keep rolling, it's a drag to
deal with.  I was unfortunately warned that if I made a formal complaint I'd
likely get more attention from the undercover police, something I'm not too
interested in.  At any rate, I don't mean to scare people away from the 181,
on the contrary, since the more people like us who hang out in the neighborhood
the better the neighborhood is (and I'm still down for the loin, for whatever
it's worth).  The club is quite cool, has much history and hopefully someday
when we get control of our public servants, the neighborhood may once again
shine.  On the other hand, there are things to be aware of just so you don't
have to deal with unpleasantries that could be avoided.

Eeeyah, no, I didn't even bother calling. In Brazil, we got this saying,

he's her man. 
I ain't that. One slap and I look for a "new man." My smeared lipstick is

don't treat me like some customer or some status thing: "oh, HE went to the

Well, well, well, hate to drag you into this little, dirty, personal war of
mine, D-man, but your quote shows several clear points I would love to
gloat over:

    they got you! You have been a faithful follower, and they spun that
sign in the fork in the road and gave you the slip!

    you probably will go back for more, as many of us still do (hey, I'll
do it agin someday, if their act cleans up)

    you were available, you were willing, you were dissapointed.

SfRavers, has this terrible, terrible, disease aflicted you or someone you
hug? In its many forms, it will cause ravers to submit to humiliation,
judgement, status, inclusion/exclusion games, long trips into the unknown
realm of virtual directions, buzz driving and desperate come-downs in the
great wilderness patrolled by people with mag-lights and blinker-cars.....

You may have rescheduled work (boss, can I take next tuesday off?) only to
find the moon rescheduled...
You may have rented a large tent, to crash with all those people you love,
after the music dies down, only to find there's no-one there (sob!)

You may decide this time around to go to a party where the funny little
voice that says "'we' love you" actually means it. Words and actions don't
always see i to i.

         Because it shouldn't be about i. it should be about US. 


Really, lotsa love in here,

Maybe it's time for people to start heading back underground nowadays.
Realistically these raves we go to are SO EASY to find out about...that's
why the Cloud Factory is cancelling our voice mail for awhile and trying to
find ways to keep mkore underground.  How long has Wicked had the same
phone number at least a year now, not to mention the Gathering or Basics or
countless others...I'm not harshing on any of these people, but I hope they
will think about how they are "promoting" if these busts continue, because
I'm pretty sure that the people there didn't get there money back when the
show got cancelled...don't flame me to the list please unless it's a
general discussion levelheaded type thing...one way we are staying more out
of sight is doing a private camping trip for 60 people some we know some on
our mailing, we are hoping that we can build a stronger sense of community
and cultivate a good word of mouth system so as not to rely too heavily on
voice mails.  that's enough spouting for today...

I think it was due to sound complaints. They lowered the volume in the
upper room around 12:30 and I saw someone with an SPL meter up on the stage
downstairs right after the Dust Brothers ended (short, but good show by
them).

Yep, the "official" reason given by the police was that the volume was in
excess of the legal limits.

Those are the frat-boys that are obviously cut with smack. They're a

we got there a little early, before they opened the club to non special 
people, and a cop car drove up and told them to keep it down.
the guy at the door said that they had only done sound checks up to this 
point, and that they hadn't gone above 20db's on them...

maybe the troc was being harassed...

	Does anyone know if that measurement that determined that the 
sound was "above legal limits" was taken inside or outside? Is there 
actually a limit on the amount of sound one can produce within a 
sound-dampening room? I wonder if the firing range the nice peace 
officers use ever reaches above said legal limit? Actually, this is a 
serious question, cuz if parties can be shutdown due to excessive 
interior noise, this could represent a problem not only for large 
massives and little gatherings, but also the parties you and two friends 
throw in your flat that the cops stumble upon...

My dearest Milton,
	Will you please lighten up on the whole FMR thing.  There is nothing
	sinister or malific going on.  Basically it takes money and energy
	(yes and guts) to throw these parties and after over three years
	I'm sure some of the participants are getting tired, especially when
	people complain no matter what you do.  

	If you let people know early with plenty of advanced warning then
	the parties are busted before they start (because all of the auto
	movement and folks hanging around HOURS before they are suppose to be
	there tips off the Police).  If you make it too accessable then a lot
	of gangsters and the nitrous proffiteers show up and make it less than
	a wholsome event.  People complain about the party always getting busted.

	If we drive it underground and people have to work a little to find it
	well it is true there are less people but the Vibe is stronger.

	I personally told at lease 8 people on this list where the mappoint 
	to the FMR was around 8:30 pm.  Anyone who called me that night
	and asked me where the mappoint was, was told.  No, I didn't tell the 
	location to people until around 2:00 as I was told to do.  There are a
	a couple of reasons for this, first there shouldn't be a bunch of people
	milling around at the site before the music starts, two years ago the
	most of the folks who went knew how to act at an underground, they
	slipped into the area quietly and didn't draw attention to themselves,
	now people bring firecrackers, nitrous tanks without silencers and
	boom their stereo's just askin for the cops to come.  The second reason
	is that the site could CHANGE at short notice and all of the people who
	went to the first site will become lost.  Undergrounds are suppose to
	be hard to find, remember?
	If you came to 181 there wasn't any problem finding out where
	the party was.  There are even places on the net where
	directions can be found if you bother to look.  The simple fact
	of the matter is that the FMR IS an underground party, it is
	generally illegal, even when it is not stressed by the police
	it is because there are tacit agreements made about conduct and
	size.  For all the bitchin and moaning, I don't see anyone
	risking their sound systems (except maybe Brycer and Galen) or
	arrest throwing outdoor underground monthlies.  Why don't you
	try organizing and throwing your own FMR before you criticize?
	In fact the next time we can use your credit card to secure the
	generator.

   I agree that the FMR should be underground, but I also think Milton
has some great ideas.  Maybe it is time for other groups to get together
and put on FMRs.  I'm glad Wicked has been throwing FMR's for so long...
but I must admit, it gets very annoying when the parties don't start until
5:00 am the following morning...Geoff mentioned that maybe Milton should
try organizing a FMR before he criticizes.  Well, he has been.  Milton
has been introducing many different groups (Ooga Booga, Tribal Funk,
E-Ticket, Harmony, etc...) to us (the Cloud Factory)...I can't speak
for everybody, but we are considering throwing full moon parties this
summer (with help from other groups).  
   We don't want to step on Wicked's toes, but if people are
going to be left completely in the dark, maybe it's time some other
people do something about it.  I completely agree that it should
be kept underground, but it's also nice to know that the party you
are searching for is actually going to happen.....
Hopefully this won't become a flame war (I don't see why it should...).
Anyways, I just had to vent.....

Why wait to the summer?  There is a full moon comming up in 27 days!
I think that most of the people who complain don't realize what a tourch it
is to bear.  Are you saying that the Cloud Factory is willing to commit to
putting on an FMR for 12 months or so straight?  (It's one thing to throw
one party, it's another to throw them for three years)  The thing is that
I don't think any of the complainer are willing to say OK we will throw
the party for the next 13 months, no matter what, we will front the $400
a month or so that it cost to rent the sound system, generator and such,
we will risk arrest, inpounding of our system for the next 13 months, we
will manage a crowd at an illegal event where no-one is being searched and
any one can bring guns.  We will clean up the place after the party if folks
don't stay for that part.  Is this what I'm hearing that the Cloud Factory is
signing on to do?

Well I think you will see the light when you have thrown one or two of these,
how much energy it takes to throw these consistantly and make sure that they
go off without major incident.  Even Galen who I have the utmost respect for
had some really bad shit happen to them at the end of sunset because of the
area that they chose to have the party in.  It's not easy and before people 
open there mouth about how they are gonna have a Full Moon party, I hope
they have some commitment to having more than just a "one off"

C'mon I think you're over reacting. You also probably didn't help carry
equiptment, find a spot that can hold a shitload of car's (cause you'll
probably get some inclusion/exclusion shit going if you try to make it
small), spin in the freezing cold, or pay money out of your already small
pocket to rent a truck & big generator or give them a donation for that
matter. It's true there's been some fucked up shit with the full moon, but
nothing as bad as what you're saying. The only thing you can call them is
lazy for not changing their voicemail, but all of us are lazy. If you
don't like the way they treat you then don't go to the monthly wicked.

You're probably thinking of Future Sound of London's "Papua New Guinea" of
the Accelerator album, breakbeat, dub bassline, dead can dance vox sample,
*exteremely* moving. Galen played a crazy vocal song after it & then
finished with orbital's "midnight" another classic trance song.

OK, all respect to those who put themselves in jeopardy with the law to
throw these things.  But why does one group have to "carry the torch" for
full moon raves?  The full moon is a special time that has been happening
for a lot longer than raves have been and just because someone wants to
throw a full moon party, I don't think that obligates them to have one on
every full moon.  

It seems to me that these things would be harder to bust if different groups
were throwing them throughout the year.  When the same group is throwing
them month after month, it becomes progressively easier for the authorities
to track them down.  And having two on the same night would certainly reduce
the bust factor.

The full moon is a time to come together and have a good time and make new
friends and revel in the energy that seems to only come from a full moon. 
All this discussion about who can and can't throw a FMR seems to be missing
the point.  If you wanna throw a FMR, do it!  I don't care if there are 3
other FMR's the same night.  The idea that full moons are a kind of property
or territory is selfish and egotistical.  No person on this planet put that
sun reflector up there or any of the magic that goes with it.  Let's not get
away from the real reason we're doing all this, folks.  And it wouldn't hurt
any of us to www our asses to hyperreal and re-read what Laura wrote about
PLUR (paying special attention to the R part.)  I've put too much love and
energy into the collective vibe to just let it get torn down now.  Now's a
good time to get centered again.  Do it!

My two cents worth, flame away if you want to.  I can take it.

I mention this because I believe that if the current people who throw FMRs
were to stop and no other group made a concerted effort, there wouldn't be
any party. You see most people have better things to do than throw this
party, as soon as it stopped getting fun or started to get dangerous,
they wouldn't be into it any more.

The people who throw the FMR don't go around breaking people's legs or anything
If anyone wants to throw a Full Moon Party they should do so, just make sure
that both parties don't converge on the same site.  In fact I'm surprised
with all the complaining going on that no one else has attempted it.

I've heard the lame excuse that if Wicked threw a party the same night that
no-one would go to the alternative one, well ther's just one way to find out
isn't there folks? And you might get lucky and Wicked could get lazy and you
might just have 1000 drunken people to deal with wondering when the party's
gonna start. I hope who ever throwes the party can deliver the goods :)

I have never heard anyone at Wicked say that the FMR was THEIR Party.
I have heard them say that if there is gonna be another party, it should be
far enough away so that authorities busting one don't think it's the same party
just moved.  I would say that the folks who want to throw a FMR the way that
they want (posting it to the net, giving every one plenty of time to arrange
baby sitters, and starting the party early so you can have thousands of people
attend) should do just that and let others who are willing to put up with
the late notification and dodgey date shifting to do it the way they want.

You are quite right that the Moon shines down on each of us equally, if
you don't like the way the FMR is executed, there is no one stopping you
from throwing your own.

  I just have a few comments to add to the current FMR debate.

o  The FMR's don't just happen in SF.  They happen all up and down the 
California coast and other places of the world.  Wicked has been throwing 
it consitently the longest.  Before they came to SF, they threw some 
FMR's in England (under the Tonka sound system name) and thought about 
throwing similar parties in america. (Read their interview in XLR8r (i 
think) from a month or two ago.)

o  The full moon isn't the only celestial event for a good outdoor 
party.  The Cloud Factory threw a party the same day of the persid (sp?) 
meteor showers, we threw the party in a canyon and were blessed with an 
amazingly clear Monterey night.  It was a break-in so we were risking our 
equipment and what not, but the party went off with no problems.

o  I don't think there are any soundsystems out there that want to put 
the FMR on each and every month.  That's where Wicked gets lots and lots 
of props.  But, I think it would be a good thing for other people, who 
have experience in outdoor parties, to throw the FMR. 

o  Of course, you don't want 4 seperate FMR's going on at the same time.  
That's why there should be some communication between all the sound 
systems who might be intersted in throwing the party.  There should also 
be some discussion about how it should be promoted and how word would be 
spread.  It seems that Wicked has been spending the last 9 months or so 
trying to make the FMR more underground.  I mean, come on, after you've 
been in Rolling Stone magazine, you might need to shrink things a 
little.  Granted, they should at least put soem info on the voice mail 
saying it's canceled (if they're even going to put it on in the first 
place.) B But they have done a good job of moving it deeper underground.  
I think the fact the even had one in January (and with only 50 people) is 
a good sign they still want to keep doing it and build it up again.

o  On the Cloud Factory FMR... We've never said we want to do it for 13 
months straight.  It was milton who first suggested the CF do a full moon 
and we've been thinking about doing it.  If we do though, it woudln't be 
till this summer and it would probably be in the Monterey/Santa Cruz area 
or perhaps over the Golden Gate and up in the mountains.  We would also 
be interested in colaborating with some of the other sound systems out 
there to get more people involved in it.  Perhaps CF could do something 
on a Sat. night and then Pacific will take over on Sunday (in the same 
spot, if it's a good/safe one..) and do Sunset :)

  Anyways, enough said...

Yeah I saw a picture of the FMR in Thailand someone was holding up a sign
that said "The ORIGINAL Full Moon Rave" :).  It is true the FMR (at least
for Wicked) is an modern day interpretation of the Sabat or Pagan Meet that 
happens at every full moon.  In a fully Pagan community there would be 
full moon gatherings all over the country side and peopl would go to the
one that was closest to them either physicaly or psycicly

Yes, sister Moon has 27 other faces, pick one.  Like the New Moon posse did.

I think that they might even be open to collaboration, has anyone asked them?

This last party was really good, it was nice that it was small, such a contrast
from the 3000+ party that left Bonnie Doon a mess over a year ago.

That's fine but bear in mind that folks can't have it both ways, they complain
that Wicked is lagging but no-one wants to say OK I'll carry the load for a 
while.  Every one is willing to do one or two but if Wicked stopped all 
together would there still be a FMR? Who would carry on the tradition?
I'm afraid that offers to do one in the future (but don't get me wrong
please please do do it!) won't help the situation now of making sure that
there is a (hopefully unbusted) party each month. And if Wicked say OK guys
your right, we're out of it, who's gonna step to the plate and carry on now
I don't hear any of us out here saying that we will take this tremendous task
on for a period of time, maybe someone should offer to do them for a season,
i.e Cloud Factory take the spring, Wicked take the Summer, Pacific take the 
Fall, and CDC or someone take the winter. That way the burden would be shared

Other event coming up

I don't care if you're a jaded raver.... I've seen so many music 
styles/trends come and , well, they actually never go - we just keep on 
groovin'! But I want to thank you for the major compliment you gave me in 
this message, as I did the Intellabeam programming! Thank you sooooo much 
for calling it excellent!! And a big (smooch) from Andre as well. I was 
called at the last minute ( 7:30 pm the night of the event) and am 
further handicapped by crutches ( yes, I am still on crutches and heading 
for more surgery soon ). But I couldn't bear the thought of sitting at 
home when there were 6 Beams that needed to be programmed for what looked 
to be a cool event. And Dutch was panicking. So off I went, and it was 
fun! I ran through his set, until about 2:30, and then Andre and Trev 
took over. It was a cool party, everyone was dancing, and kudos to all 
the DJ's and Visual artists that contributed their positive and creative 
energy to the party. And thanks to all you who came and danced.

The best full moon party I ever went to was on Ocean Beach, with the 
giant disc glimmering off the phosphorescence glowing waves, bonfires 
burning around, and me all by myself, dancing to the music in my mind, at 
the waters edge. Peace and energy of life. Lady Trash

    i don't believe i have been more dissappointed about a party in a great
while!
this party proved to me that maybe just maybe ... i don't like organic
parties.
i think i knew this before hand , but the appetizing price of 12 dollars, so
called magnificent dj line up, and the location which i like ....all tempted
me to go.
as for the people however.....i don't know but there is just something about
the people that organic attracts.
it seemed like there were two kinds of people there.....big brutes with no
shirts fumbling around as high as kites, and little girls problably about 14
years old.
   i always appreciate a good dj when i hear one ....and last night out of
the lineup...i'd have to say it was fairly dissappointing. Keoki, who i came
to see, pretty much kicked my ass but for some reason i expected him to be a
lot more entertaining. Though his mummy costume was pretty neat!
now for hardkiss.....i believe all these brothers do well is make records and
sell them , not perform them. they seemed excited about being there but i
think it was the way they didn't mix records is what bothered me the most but
I did get a free tape though -so that was cool. And lastly i thought mark
farina did a pretty well done job and ended off the evening with some good
tunes.
.......all in all this party was dissappointing, and maybe i learned my
lesson this time about what parties i like and parties i don't like. but
hey...you win some you lose some, can have it always how you want it
unfortunately...............erica

I was trying to decide whether to go to Organic or the 1015 Folsom thing 
and pretty much flipped the coin.  Folsom it was. I hadn't been to a 
party at 1015 since it used to be "Das Klub" in the 80's. 

Here's my most interesting story from this event:  three Italian guys are 
in line ahead of me and are disscussing some pertinent matters and 
finally one of them decides to take his I.D. and proceed to security dude 
for the once over... his trick was to immediately light a cigarette in 
front of the security guy while checking the I.D.  At the time I figured 
it was to make him look more mature, but now that I think about it maybe 
it was just to draw more attention to the fire in his mouth than to the 
features of his face...

Anyways the security dude determined the deception and didn't let him or 
his friends in. 

Other than that I don't think I could report anything signinficant so 
I'll leave it to someone else.

Nag Champa was a nice event , but a missed opportunity on my part.

 I guess I arrived with some misconceptions about the event - I thought
it was going to be something like listening to a classical music
quartet - everyone sitting around quietly and appreciating the music.
It actually was like a big chill room at a Richmond rave , but without
the big bass coming in from the main dancefloor ,and better mattresses.
Once I made my conceptual shift , I had a good time for the remainder
of my time there ( I had to leave early because I had to go to work
today - that's where I'm writing from now ).

 Nice video work by Mike - and who was the other guy(s) upstairs? And
the music was great too , once I understood that a wide range of musical
styles was going to be played. 

 ---

 One of the things I usually regret is not meeting or talking with more 
folks at raves - so Nag Champa would have been perfect , except I got
started with my conversation somewhat late , so I didn't get to meet as
much folks as I could have . It was nice to see folks I haven't talked to
in awhile - Resonate , Raffaela , Rocky (Rocki? female , not male ),
and other SFRavers whose names don't begin with R . Maybe I'll do more
and better socializing at the next such event ( let's have another one! ).

 Thanks Larry !  The guy upstairs who did some gorgeous trippy visuals
 was Johnny Turpin who works with Apple. He brought a very nice video
 DJ setup and did some great stuff all night... thanks Johnny!

 Boy what a party! And the folks kept coming and coming... we "packed"
 komotion again. Rave review of ambient rave. Thanks Joe! (And of course
 Bryce who worked and worked even though obviously not feeling well) And
 of course all the DJ's and regulars...

 Only down side for me was when people lay around they smoke and smoke
 so it's a good thing CC wasn't there. TOO MUCH smoke! Cough, cough!

I WOuld try and make Nag Champa,  but nobody took the time to tell me
where it was.    If you looked in the calander,  you would have seen it
mention an Email address to contact for more info.   Well,  I emailed
my request for info,   but they didn't tell me in time,  so,  not knowing
where the party was,  I didn't go.    How was it?    I heard it was smokey,
yes,  well then I probably wouldn't enjoy it.     Just so you all know,
to all those smokers out there in SFRave land,   I have medication to counter
act the nasty effects (Nausia,  dizzybess,  etc),  unfortunately,  it costs
me $25 for a single pill,   thats $5 more than an E tablet,   which really SUX,,
so all U tobacco addicts out there,  PLEESE consider what *I* have to pay
to enjoy myself at raves.   The medication WORKS,  is horribly expensive,
but I'm willing to put up with it so all U smokers can still have your
nicotine fits because I like raving so much to have to put up such a high
personal expense to attend these parties.   Anyway,  thats my $.02.

Strange - I've been to raves in Carolina in No-Smoking buildings, where the

Here's my speculation on the recent busts by the SFPD. I was at the 938
Harrison Raid/debacle/ that occured on New Year's . I almost didn't get my
computer out that raid, owing to the fact that the cops wanted to
confiscate everything. But that's another story! After finally allowing me
to take the computer home, the officer in charge, a Captain, happened to
mention to me that: 

"By the way it was one of the local clubs around here that turned 'You 
guys' in" 

Could it be that the recent slew of raids and busts _might_ have an
economic basis? ie., that some clubs might be blowing the whistle to drum
up more business for their own locales. What do you think?

  This is a theory that comes up every once and awhile . Even if there was 
evidence of this , are they doing anything illegal? In this case , wouldn't
they be considered "good citizens" reporting a public nuisance?

 ALSO - consider the source - maybe this is a little disinformation on
that police captain's part? Who knows?

In fact, I think Reid is right.  I was also at the 938 Harrison raid and 
several others (the police as well as the guy who threw the party) said that 
it had been the owner of another club (I forgot the name though) who had 
registered a noise complaint earlier that day because of the sound check.
The police came by later on because of the earlier noise complaint.
(at least this is what I was told by the lawyers handling the case)

I've seen it happen before and it wouldn't surprise me at all if a lot of 
the recent busts were a combination of club owner sabotage and the 
"crackdown" on soma clubs.

It would be really unfortunate if this is true.

I can't believe it. Garth and Carlos are going to be here in zion next 
friday spinning at a rave. Actually we get a lot of West coast dj's (from 
San Diego to Seattle) as well as a few from back east. I guess I'm just 
excited because I recognize these names from when I'm in SF. 

Just my $.02

Atomicon Review

   A fellow SFRaver,  David Minuk informs me of a Hardcore rave on 
Friday that I should check out.    It wasn't initially on the
SFRave calander.   but early on Friday afternoon,   someone
added it to the Addendum to the calander.

Friday, January 20th - Atomicon
        "techno, jungle, gabber, hard acid, hardcore, house"
        415.337.4236

With a severe lack of Gabber and Hardcore in the SF Area,  and
thanx to David for providing me a ride,  I had the opportunity
to check it out.    We had no idea how large this party would
be,   because it wasn't promoted that well,   and it got up
on the SFRave calander rather late,  so few people had
opportunity to check it out.

We call the info line,   and learn where it's map point is
located,   and after driving around for a while,   we locate
the Map point dude,  pay then $5,  get our hand stamp,   and
head out to the secret location (Somewhere in SF).

We finally arrive at the venue..  Which was very discreet,
and eventually get let into the space.    The space,  although
rather small,    was about the size of Komotion,   might be
able to accommodate about 100 people,  possibly 150.   When
we arrive,   about 30 people were there.    DJ Crust was 
spinning Housey trance.    And we learned that DJ Stone and
Maria had just finished spinning.    Maria was spinning jungle
but we missed it (Darn!).

The Chill area,  was decorated with spacey mushrooms,  and
a strange mask was mounted on the wall.    It had comfortable
mats,  and pillows spread around the floor,  and the main
dance area had about 10 people dancing.    After stretching
in the chill area,    I headed out to the dance area,  and
was surprised to hear the "Ha Ha" laughing song again.   This
song was also spun by Josh Wink at Area 51.   I also heard
two other songs played at Area 51,  plus a bunch of new songs
I haven't heard before.    I haven't heard DJ Crunch spin 
before,   and have to say,  he was rather good.

Eventually,  DJ Crush gave way to DJ Mars who wasted no time
in upping the BPM's to about 160 -175 range,  and played the
most brilliant Hardcore Trance I've ever heard.    ALL the
songs he played,   I've never heard before,  and really dug
his energy.    The much faster beats,  and new Hard core trance
was really refreshing to hear,  especially in the SF scene.

I recommend that we put DJ Mars behind the turntables at our
next Friends and Family party.   His stuff is really brilliant,
and his energy is amazing.    With little or no breaks in the
fast pumoing 160+ BPMs,  his "beat matching" was excellent,
which I seldom hear from other Hardcore DJ's,  which isn't
that much around here.

The Sound system,  although small,   delivered the music adequately,
although somewhat overdriven at times,   but for the small space,
it was certainly OK with me.   The strobe was excessive at times,
but it wasn't on ALL the time,  and the lighting and visuals wasn't
super spectacular,  but the music more than made up for it.

Most of the Hard core trance was instrumental,  lots of electronic
sounds,  literally put my brain out in space,  and I danced his
entire set,   chilling no more than 5 - 10 minutes as the music
was constantly beckoning me to continue dancing.    Being my
2nd "all nighter",   where my previous evening was devoted to
hearing the Dust Brothers at the Troc,   which got shut down
early by the pigs.

After DJ Mars left the turn tables,  the BPM's got nudged up a
few more notches to somewhere between 190 and 210 BPM's as I
got to hear Gabber for the very first time.    Yow!!   It was
totally INSANE...    It's almost impossible to jump around at
that speed,   but BOY!  It offered some very new dancing 
possibilities,  as I was experimenting,  and frustrated that
the Earths gravity was far too weak for me to do a lot of
jumping around,   but eventually I fell into some blazingly fast
undulating motions with my back and arms.  WOW!!  Had NO idea
I could move that fast.   It is vertainly something I wouldn't
want to do ALL the time,   but the variaty was really great.

I think that Brisen the DJ,  had the volume slightly in the
distorted range,   but the super high energy really loostened
me up,  thats for sure.   Most of his music comes from the
E Coast and Holland and Germany/

At about 5 am,   me and David plus a few others were the only
ones still dancing,   and David wanted to check out Venus,  but
by the time we got there,   things were shut down,  so we eventually
headed back homw.

All in all,   it was an excellent party,   fairly small,  and
VERY UNDERGROUND!!    I strongly recommend that you go to the next
planned party.     Just expect some secrecy,  and a tight Map point
policy.    Also expect a little difficulty in finding the map point.
Just be VERY discrete,  and don't hang outside by the front door.

It is very refreshing to know that the SF scene will be getting
more variaty in music types and higher BPM's.   So be looking 
forward to expanding into newer variaties of music,  and hopefully
the SF scene will offer far more variaty....   CHECK IT OUT!!

Hi! Susie has been nice enough to let me use her net connection to 
get word out that I need a place to live. How shall I put this without 
sounding too desperate? Hellllpppp!!!! This unending dwelling search has 
like-you know-put a serious dent in my rave schedule. God! i was so 
pooped on Saturday after having "the perfect place" snuffed by a roomate 
who decided at the last minute to change her mind and not move out, that 
I didn't make it to nag champa, ohmygod! So I'm really hoping that maybe 
some very special sfraver knows of a place. Let me discuss briefly my 
wishlist for a place:

safe neighborhood in sf
good transporation (no car now)
w/ direct access to yard for my kitty boo
washer and dryer would be nice
no more than three roomates though two would be better
reasonable rent

I am a responsible, clean, happy & friendly roomate, i've lived 
in sf for almost five years.  Some of the best people on earth are ravers, 
and as i continue to rave, i continue to be amazed by the infinite 
amazingness of ravers, so i know my 
plea is in good hands here. If you know of a place, call me @ Gregory's 
(415) 665-7057. THANKS!  Peace, Amy

I think you are right, but I believe the economics to be much more evil than
the jealosy of rival club owners.  There are some very rich and politically
connected property owners, our beloved mayor (cough) may be one of them.
Seen how the property values in the Embarcodero have gone up over the last
few years?  My guess is these property owners want to do the same to SOMA.
I haven't heard of any yuppie bars being busted lately, they might nail
daddy's favorite son if they did, so they don't.

I'm not saying the the police are the dupes of some malevolent political
machine.  This is SF after all.  But certain elements of the police force
are sure to be open to political promptings.

Ciao,

PT

Could it be that the recent slew of raids and busts _might_ have an
economic basis? ie., that some clubs might be blowing the whistle to drum
up more business for their own locales. What do you think?

There were a lot of good reasons for not going to the friday
wicked/astralwerks/gardening club/whatever thing at 1015 folsom.

- Going to any well establised club on a friday or Sat nite means
that there will be a lot of club people/tourists there.

- Big ugly flyer alert

- Music industry & record label people in town usually brings in a pretty
vibeless "suit" element.
 
- CLubs featuring multiple dance rooms (3 on friday) often create a party
with a lot of churning: the "Let's go see if something cooler is happening
in another room" syndrome.  I find that one dance room, and a chill out
room works best, except for big venues like Richmond Civic Auditorium. 
where other dance area can be set up far as an indepenent  entities.

- alcohol

Well, we went anyway simply because it had been *so* long since we've gone
out dancing (NYE), and we prefered 1015 Folsom and it's DJ lineup over 
Ceasar's where Organic was.  We pretty much got what was expected, a club
scene.  In at around 2.   Screetching Diva on the stage of the Main
room to our right, retro 70's in the front room to our left - we dodged a
couple of drunks and escaped to the basement.  Better - Markie was spinning
and there seemed to be some kind of a vibe.  Horrible speaker distortion
to our left, conga player to our right - we opted for the speaker distortion.
Bought a 2$ bottle of water.   My record for fastest time before having a
water bottle stolen was shattered at about 2 minutes.  I put it down,
spin around, it's gone.  (previous record 15 minutes, also in the basement
of 1015 folsom strangely enough).  Ah well, perhaps it saved someone's 
life.  Speaker distortion reduced the music to a nice rumble - hey the
conga player really isn't too bad...

Later we check out John Howard spinning some nice house in the front room.
The main room is featuring John Williams, but the high end seems to be 
getting pushed to a rather harsh level.  All the tourists are there 
anyway.  By 4:30 the party had thinned out considerably.  Jeno is going
off in the basement, but we were already feeling bored.  At least it didn't
get busted.

Geoff W. inquires of Milton:
>Why wait to the summer?  There is a full moon comming up in 27 days!

well, I would love to see it happen, too, sweetcheeks! maybe there's enough
time to get ready, maybe not. Why the rush, "we" haven't been to one in
sooooo long anyway, remember? Nor have *most* of the people I love and
consider sincere and open. A lot of them are under 21, go figure.....

>I think that most of the people who complain don't realize what a tourch it

>putting on an FMR for 12 months or so straight? 

Well, hold on there. Maybe it's a COMUNITY effort. Let me explain this term
to the general public: a lot of people with like interests cooperate and
share the work and the joy. Makes it easier for everyone involved, lets
more people participate, the scene grows and blooms. Oh my!

Ok, Geoff, it's COMPLAINERS, not just MY big mouth. Maybe you should talk
to all those who aren't getting the info as soon as yourself or those 8 on
your phone tree. Or those who don't work for themselves and can't afford to
reschedule everyday, at the whim of "that voice on the line."
 Also, what if that money does pop up? What if several people share the
costs? Hmmm....And what if we do decide to clean up the place? That sounds
like a way of life more than a chore after a party. Guns, hmm, are you
saying that there WILL BE GUNS at anyone else's FMR? 

>Well I think you will see the light when you have thrown one or two of these,
>how much energy it takes to throw these consistantly 

Hello? Consistantly? But yes, I am shure it will be a pain in the colon.
Sheesh, maybe we'll all just give up...

I can't make promises, especially if they can't be kept 100%. Who knows
what sorta shit will happen.But wow! maybe we should TRY and see what
happens? 
Maybe wicked would like to cooperate and join in with other systems, have a
rotating set of DJs and systems and promoters every month? That would mean
a lot of planning and talking and understanding and sharing, sorta what
ravers try to do in their everyday lives. Hmmm....I'm up for that. Care to
share?

Mijo, I stay to the end, and if help is needed, I'm no slob. Spots are
found not by wicked but by people who love to have a moon and contact them
with ideas, then they sort them out and pick one. "that voice"'s day job is
NOT site scouting.
I don't spin. If I did, I'd wear a sweater and a windbreaker. I'd love to
put it on for all those thankful dancers.I don't hink it's the DJ's who
cancell.

>or pay money out of your already small pocket to rent a truck & big generator

Funny how that money thing comes up all the time with this FMR stuff. And
who knows when I have or haven't donated money? Tsk tsk.....


> The only thing you can call them is lazy for not changing their voicemail,
>but all of us are lazy. 

Lazy and mildy INCONSIDERATE. All of us are not lazy. Some try to fight
curfews, age discrimination at parties, and try to change the scene by
getting on the FMR

>If you don't like the way they treat you then don't go to the monthly wicked.

Sounds like a couple kickin' away "if you don't want it, then maybe you get
any!" I love Thomas. Markie is awesome. J&G are eye-poppers on any flyer.
Good people go to Wicked. Do I have to give it all up because I disagree?
Complaining is not an insult.
And new year's I saved the $35 door charge (or BASS $20) and went where the
vibe was. And got the shit hugged out of me.

who says everyone's gonna be drunk? Who throws their party in clubs with a
full on bar and $2.50 water? Who hires the big guys with the pushy
attitudes at the door? And maybe wicked won't be lazy, and 1000 sober
people will show up anyway because they feel someone cares about them.

  no one is gonna try to screw up another party. and I doubt they will be
on the same night. And remeber, Wicked's been busted a lot recently.

Nag Champa, the giant slumber party, the perfect end to a long evening. I went
with my friend Cydney who is stuck in horrible grad school hell on the East
Coast and has been dying to go to some offbeat parties since I talk about raves
a lot. Cydney described it like an opium den, which I thought was really right,
people lying around on bean bag chairs and in sleeping bags listening to spacey
music, some dancing very slowly, some covered in body paint and moving in a very
stylized manner and some watching the psychedelic graphics on the video screen.
Lots of cigarette smoke, yes, too much. We parked up on the stage and got to
watch the djs at work. Great music most of the time, the stuff I love to space
out at home and managed to enjoy it there, too, but I couldnt help noticing
that as soon as music with a little bit of a beat was played, people were immediately
on their feet, ready to move, asking for more. I was, too. Left after about 2
hours because it was too hard to sit without getting way sleepy. I can dance
till morning, but please dont ask me to sit so long because the mind wanders
and loses focus. Thanks to all who put it on. I will go to any event at Komotion
anytime because I like the small community feeling there.

Sorry. I responded to all requests received up to 3pm on Saturday, at which
point we had to start preparing.

I thought Derek mailed out an addendum with the phone number, but I could
be wrong.

yeahyeahyeah! So I have some spare time, sheesh, lemme right some here!

Okay, mijos, look for the "Happy Hug of Approval" at indonesia in SC and
other fine raves in your area, wherever and whenever you may be. (weird,
huh?)

I plan on doing my Sharmin' Squishin' in SC, tho, 'cause is all ages, get
it? Happy ravers, smiles, SC energy, a huge playground, and the sandbox is
BIG!
If anyone goes "down" there, please, make plans to crash if the weather is
cool, take blankets, bags, coats, and donuts, and let's all chill in one
big spot and look at the sun till we all go blind (or just till we wind
down from whatever or take a collective nap). THE party shouldn't end just
because A party ended.....

Lotsa love,

nothing more. Nobody's opinion/views are any more valid than anyone else's.

Milton, this debate is getting old.  Whether it's FMR, Martin,
Cool World, King St. Garage... anyone can find a target to bitch 
about.  I personally have a hard time complaining about any party that 
is free.  But that's me.

Sure - FMR's are sometimes a bit flakey and have had a higher bust 
percentage than other parties - this is nothing new, and is actually
pretty common for illegal renegades.  If you don't like the way something 
is run, it is real easy to just conserve your energy for something else.
If you feel strongly about some void in the scene, complaining about it 
usually will not do much to fill it.  Positive action might.

Yes it happenned....    ....    ....    the full moon went off last 
tuesday nite/wed morn after MOVE ...... Garth and  CB and Donovan and the 
berkely posse took a small system to Berkely Aquatic park.     this party 
was so underground that if you werent at move you probably didnt find out 
about it .    Ishould know... we didnt...Garth said he played 6 hours and 
that tracy should have brought her records...   oh well... garth said 
150   donovan said 40 ... seems the general feeling is to do the party 
with a smaller system (easier logistics, less heat ) instead of the 
purple people pusher and keep the party a bit closer and a bit more low 
key  ... thereby getting away with it.

If it was just greed, this would be an isolated incident. Unfortunately it
seems that there is a concerted attempt to contain and control youth
culture in general and rave culture specifically. Which explains the
moritorium on Club Licences (licences are a source of cash for the city, so
rule out greed), the 2am dance ban. The alchohol/drugs smear attempt and
attempts to make peace-loving citizens just plain shit-scared.  Seems like
the CJB is alive and well and living in San Francisco by default. Expect
your right to dance on the grass to go the way of other "quality of life"
rights. This is not an Isolated System, but rather an interlinked
global-legal hegemony. But if we maximise our positives, we can stop this
before we get to the point of no return.

Dear Sfraves;

       I'm looking for some support right know. My x-roommate beat the
grap out of me on Tuesday night. I have a broken orbit(eye socket) 50/50
chance of lossing sight in that eye. A couple of pulled muscles in the
clervical(neck) area; other cuts and bruses. Why; he's an alcoholic and
did it in a black out. I got a restraining order against him; but I'm
still scared he going to come back here with more than his fists. I've
only been in Cal. 3 months now and don't know that many people. No; he
not part of the scence thank god. I'm hold up here in my room hoping to
find a new place to live before the restraining order runs out.
Unfortuately because I have my two siamese cats Ernesto Kitty and
Archemedes; its been very difficult tring to find a group living
situation thats stable. I still have a lot of hope; though brused and
sore; my spirit remains in tackt. Any support would be greatly
appreicated. Thanks Al; and hope to see you all soon. I don't think I
going to be able to make anything this weekend though. It still hurts
too much when I try and eat. The painkillers are good though I will say.
There's always a bright side to everything.

        Hey all!  Went to a couple of things this weekend, and thought I'd
fill you in on the details.

        Organic:  The evening started out originally with the intent of
making it over to 1015 Folsom.  After hearing what was coming out of the
front floor (it sounded worse than Kylie Minogue :-), we lost interest,
even if the rest of the party wasn't like that.  We packed up and headed
off to Organic.  
        Arrived at Ceasar's, and waited in the rain for about 30 min. 
Inside:  quite a few people (800?), mostly younger than me (I turned 24
last week :-), dead vibe.  I found myself trying different parts of the
dace floor to find a crew that was into it, but failed.  Ravergirl2 was
dead on with her description.  I'm really not all that picky with the
music, but it just wasn't happening for the DJs that spun before Rabbit in
the Moon came on.  It sounded like they were switching every 45 min or so,
the DJ would try to find a groove (deperately), play a couple of good
tracks, and then the music would change.  Case in point:  amazing acid
track (yay!) leading into slower breaks stuff (bummin').  Rabbit in the
Moon was pretty hit 'n' miss.  Some pretty cool 303 stuff -- I'm such a
sucker for that sort of thing.
        Good stuff:  my friend's first party, seeing him stand there
"taking it all in." the dancing guy with glowinthedark stuff that exploded
all over the crowd, covering them in drops of florescent green.  seeing
some friendly faces.  neat funky track during the "technical difficulties."

        Nag Champa:  Ahhhhh.... this is more like it!  After a day of
record shoppin', this is just what the doctor ordered!  Got there around
midnight and stayed 'til the last track.  Lots of people  spread out on the
floor of Kommotion, and a *very* positive vibe, which more than made up for
friday's disappointing experience.  Jonah spun an amazing Jugle-ish set
(I'm no good at the catagories thing) that seriously set my mind on Mars. 
The DJ that followed (Mark somebodyoranother?)  blew me out of the solar
system...  All this was wrapped up quite nicely by Joe Rice.  I'd honestly
have to say there wasn't a time all night when I didn't like what I was
hearing (a little too loud 'round 3am, but no big deal).  Visuals were
amazing too!  Many thanks to all on the list who brought this thing
together for the rest of us to enjoy.
        Good stuff:  hearing ethan say 'we packed the place' with a smile
on his face :-). seeing a fellow happy chemist there. having the chance to
actually *talk* to some of the people I've been meeting at these things.
riding home on the bart with a new mix tape in the walkman and seeing the
sun peek out from behind the clouds.

The FMR's in Seattle started out and continues to be a cooperative, 
community oriented event.  The events are led or coordinated by different 
people at different times.  The promoters are usually good (although by no 
means perfect) about communicating what's to be done for the celebration. 
 DJ's Dervish & Michael (ATOI, Seattle) have been taking the initiative for 
 coordinating and are very much into everyone helping out to make things 
happen.  I have known them to invite and encourage even those promoters whom 
they don't necessarily see eye to eye with.   We try to live up to our 
motto:

     "FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE LOVE OF THE VIBE!!!

It's not my place to say whether either side is right or wrong.  I can only 
offer what works for us up here.

Peace.  I have faith that you will all work it out somehow.

Tigger

PS:  The FMR's in the North West were modeled after the Bay Area FMR's. 
 Thanx for the inspiration!

Andy,

181 is short for 181 Eddy-- coincidentally, the address.  Its in the
tenderloin in SF a couple of blocks from Market St. I think.  I reccommend
taking a cab if possible, actually, if you don't want to be approached by the
various street people that occupy the vicinity.

I've not had a bad experience with them myself, just offers to buy stuff from
strung out people holding persrciption bottles in my face, but my suburbia/LA
friends were a little freaked.  Personally, I think it adds to the
experience.

The club is pretty cool-- its been called New York-ish.  Used to be hoppin'
Wed/Thu, often a $3-$8 cover.  Haven't gone in a while.

Its 21+, and sneakers are not allowed.  Beyond that, there're no other dress
codes-- I've gone in ripped jeans & motorcyle boots, but have been bounced
while wearing a jacket & sneakers :(

Two stars, Joe Bob says check it out.

Subject: Hardcore party last Friday nite

hey everyone
  
   went to that Hardcore party last Friday night and all which was fun. 
There were maybe 40-50 people in the party at its height. 
   apparently at first there was jungle played and then a bit of hard
trance then the last dj i heard was spinning hardcore tracks. 
   all in all it was cool.  the spinning wasnt the best but the Atomico
people basically are really into hardcore and jungle after a treck to NYC
and want to throw more parties in the future.  well put together and a
chill time all in all if my hands ever get feeling good again ill post a
review on my extended trip back east about the scene there.

Your university might be blocking it, but I'd be surprised if they were.  
You should be able to get to it by telnetting to hyperreal.com, port 7283.

Why dont we stop the pointless depating & complaining about the FMR & start

Well it's been quite a while since I babbled about my travels hither &
thither
so here goes . . .
 
NEW YEAR FREEZEOUT
 
And as we slam the dial back on the scene-machine, here we are in Portland,
it's New Year's Eve and fuckin' freeeeejid, about 30 degrees and a strong
gusty wind, and we're chillin', literally, on the sidewalk outside the
infamous Albina warehouse for the big Noo Yeer's do.  I stood on that
sidewalk for just about two fookin' hours, missing all of my friend Brad
Vachal's opening set, and came in just in time to hear Buck crank up on
a full-on hour plus of slow breaks, then a whizzing Dub Tribe set, a
head-achingly loud Jon Bishop hard house-trance set, a slightly more
melodic go by Mike Stevens, all amidst the clangorous sonic mud of this
concrete warehouse.  It was full but a typically low-vibe crowd, how can
you get settled into place where there is literally nowhere to go where
the sound levels are comfortable?
 
So that was the way to ring out '94, I guess.
 
COME/UNITY UPSWING
 
Ringing in the new at 1015 Folsom with the first Come/Unity of '95 was a
better
effort overall, in fact one of the nicer C/U I've been to in a long time.
A real chugger with more of the classic Come/Unity vibe than I've
experienced
in a bit.  I liked Jeno's set quite well (he slid 'Acperience' under some
wailing diva track :), and Dub Tribe was doin' the new slooow dubby stuff
in the basement which was sounding really fine.
 
FRIDAY IS BACK
 
Friday the 6th, back again to 10 Fifteen Folsom for Sound System, a new
addition to the Friday club collage of Dig! (upper floor, hip hop),
Club Bohemia (gold room, disco-ey), and Zendada (basement, progressive
[gawds I hate that term but there it is] house).  The motivators behind
Sound System, once again, Dub Tribe, along with Professor Smith (who is
chair of the Department of XLR8R :-), playing dubby stuff which I was
unable to catch due to work, and residents Corey and Keith Crusher.
With four crowds to mix, it was somewhat as LeeF described about last
Friday (which was really not the usual stuff, more of a Billboard multi-
event), but actually I think it's good the crowds get to circulate and
try out different sounds.  Hey it brought *me* into 1015 for the first
time on a Friday in ages . . .
 
Saturday I spent a shortened but still interesting evening at Il Pirata,
with turns by a variety of DJs including the bar manager, J. C., himself.
The crowd kinda went poof! at 2 am instead of growing the vibe like in
December, but such is life.
 
Sunday the 8th, once again at 10 15 Fol som, this time for the transplanted
Spundae since DV8's liquor license was yanked for the first three weeks
of January.  The crowd was typically clubby and actually a bit sparse,
but I had an interesting time watching Carlos work the decks while Dutch
experimented with a Quadriverb effects box.  Carlos took to some serious
scratching which I haven't seen him do for some time.
 
PORTLAND HANGS IN
 
I spent the following weekend in Portland and only attended the Friday
night weekly hosted by Manoj on the 4th floor of the Park Ave (Modish)
site, with DJs Sean Paul, Dazy, Brad and Mike Stevens taking the decks.
The Portland underground is not exactly thriving, but it's hanging on.
I had the distinct displeasure once again that evening of running afoul
of Portland's small-town suspicions, as one of the space's organizers
physically tried to push me out right after I had paid my entrance,
for some reason I resembled some badguytype who apparently had been
hanging around.  Everywhere else I go, no problems.  Here at home,
I've been accused of being a cop, a dealer (in fact, both back to back
one memorable night), and who knows what . . . sigh . . .
 
BUSTED AT ... THE *TROC*?!?!
 
Although there was a lot of buzz about the Billboard showcase at the
Trocadero on Thursday night, much because of the Dust Brothers, I was
more interested in seeing Justin Robertson, a personal favorite in his
production guises (The Prankster, Lionrock, etc.), and some of the
other DJs.  But to avoid the expected crush at the Troc I decided to
check out Lift at DV8 (yes, it is open, serving lemonade at the bar :).
They always seem to have a fashion show at DV8 when I go and this was
no exception.  But without the alcohol quotient, the crowd was sweet and
serene, and one side of the dancefloor was occupied by a circle not of
the usual boring hoofers, but some excellently acrobatic old-skool
breakdancers doing that thang to the sounds of house.
 
I got to the Troc around 2:45 to find it not at all crowded and completely
low key.  Justin Robertson had just gotten on deck so I was primed for
the remainder of the evening.  Just when I scooted upstairs for another,
yes, lemonade, the word came down that the cops were shutting the party
down.  At the Troc!  I mean, the Troc is practically the only bust-proof
place in my experience (no doubt there have been some, but it's rare to
say the least).  Once again, a trumped-up noise complaint was used in
the ongoing campaign by the Yalon Gang to close down a perfectly harmless
club night.  Leaving a right disappointed JR and the rest of us to straggle
out of the ole Troc . . .
 
BILLBOARD DANCE SCHMOOZE
 
On Friday I stopped at Billboard dance music conference briefly (at the ANA
Hotel on 3rd) just to check the temperature of the scene, which was not
even tepid, four seminars going in a very low-key way.  I actually liked
this, the dance music "industry" is still a very small and unimportant
wedge of the big multinational music machine.  I saw current chartbusters
like E. G. Fullalove just wandering about without a whole lot of clamoring
and pestering that you see at, say, computer industry tradeshows around the
current "names."  So, while it was a schmoozefest -- that is the point of
these things, after all, it seemed like a very pleasant one and not the
sharks-circling kind of affair that the Gavin Report confab and similar
ones have seemingly become.  In spite of all our grumbling about the
commercialization of the house/rave/techno/jungle scenes, and the undeniable
faults and stupidities of the "commercial" side, it's still really not all
that bad.
 
LET'S GO TO THE WOP
 
That brings us up to this past weekend, where we started with the monthly
Well Office Party over at the Presidio Yacht Club at the northeastern
side of the Golden Gate.  Actually, it's a lot less swanky than it sounds.
And there was a torrential rainstorm throughout the evening, driving
everyone inside for the duration.  On the ground floor, the usual
schmoozefest with copious consumables, laminate-making and whatnot.
Upstairs in the lounge, actually a nice room with a bar (unused), pool
table (er, DJ equipment platform!) and fireplace, DJs M Normal, Gil,
rab and myself took turns in the Well's first "DJ Relay" and a fine time
was had by all, though my mixing was technically as bad as I can remember.
We had a good enough time that we'll probably do it again in a couple of
months!
 
MORE BILLBOARDNESS
 
I went to 1 0 1 5 Folsom yet again Friday after the WOP closed down at
midnight, and arrived to find the scene fairly much as Lee Fogel described,
except I walked in right when Kris Needs and Delta Lady were doing "Anything
You Dream," with the singer in this sort of disco outfit belting out the
tune up on the stage, and a vibeless crowd sort of shifting about watching
the proceedings.  Jon Williams followed with a generally faceless mid-130s
banging beats set (it's the style now, yunnow), and someone told my friend
Brad (also down from Portland for the weekend) that JW was actually mellower
than some of the DJs on beforehand.
 
It got a little better after that, with Garth and then Raymond Roker in the
main room, Corey doing breaks and Andrew Rawnsley in the gold room doing,
well, garage (great toonz tho).  After 4 or so, in fact, it was like Editor
Sound Clash in the front hallway with Raymond Urb on the port and Rawno
XLR8R
on the starboard.  Downstairs we had Markie, Jeno and Taj, the latter
spinning
wickedly deep basslines that took full advantage of the wondrous new bass
setup downstairs.  And I thought Jeno rode the really sweet smooth sound
in a way I haven't heard him do for a while.  Kewlness!  But no vibeness,
I'm afraid.  Too many people intent on having a good time to actually have
one, methinx.  I didn't see very many industry types, despite this being
a Billboard showcase.
 
SWEET NAG CHAMPA
 
More rain did not dampen our spirits setting up for Nag Champa at the
Venerable Komotion.  It was sparse at 10:45 and suddenly full at 11:15,
and 20 minutes later everyone who had been standing around in Cocktail
Party Mode suddenly got the idea, went horizontal and made it a party!
There seem to be two schools of thought on the evening, both with valid
points, in my view.  One was that the mix of music, ranging from mostly
beatless through some fairly beat-oriented stuff at quite a variety of
speeds, was just fine.  Others feel that an ambient party really needs to
be basically beat-free.  Myself, I can't avoid moving when there's something
grooving, but that doesn't have to apply to everyone (and not to me in some
situations!).
 
It got quite crowded for a while, but bearably so, and after 3 it was fine.
I enjoyed almost all of the music, starting with Ronan's varied selections
through Joe Rice's wonderfully smooth and deep finale.  Big credits to
Jonah for his usual superb selecting and a 45 minute Jonah In the Jungle
excursion which proves beyond a Moving Shadow of a doubt that yes there
IS good jungle (well I *knew* that, in fact I played a jungle track at the
Well party the night before :-).  My own view is that it was a fairly
experimental evening, and the next time there should be at least one
full set devoted mostly to textures.  But my hat's off to the people who
did the hard work to conceive of this and pull it off, the music and the
visuals were just outstanding.  Turnabout was fair play, Joe Rice had
come up to Portland to the New Year's event and watched Dub Tribe play
there, so it was fitting that Moonbeam & Sunshine were on hand to watch
Joe play!
 
I want to say again what a pleasure it is to work with all these sfraves-
related events.  I think, without overstating the case, that we really
are helping to preserve and evolve the "house nation" concept with these
events, in a time that really needs it, and I hope we continue to put
on innovative events that aren't afraid to take a risk and maybe even
fail in some eyes, because otherwise we too can turn into the vibeless
repetition that one encounters often in clubland and the underground too.
 
Yesterday I stayed away from all events.  Instead I went record shopping,
finding mostly older stuff at Star Alley and BPM.  If you have some time,
go to BPM soon and check out the upstairs, where a rather large collection
of vinyl is sitting in about 50 milk carton crates, priced good-to-go
at $2 to $4 a disc.  Nothing hugely amazing there, but I found some
interesting tidbits including some Strictly test pressings that sound
really good.  Tell DRC and Chris I sent ya :)
 
While I was there, it was discovered there had been a break-in the previous
night and a bunch of computer and audio stuff had been taken from the
upstairs offices.  Just then, Buck arrived, hoping to pick up a reel-to-
reel recorder which was one of the items taken.  The look on his face
said it all (anyone who's seen Buck spin recently knows how devoted he
is to those reel machines).  This is a disheartening blow to the BPM/Third
Floor gang so pleeze send some sfraves-beams their way.
 
Sunday night, I was tired of going to clubs, so I went and saw a movie !
 
I went into such length describing all this because it's really been my
reimmersion in the SF club scene after almost a year of being away from it.
 
My impression is that musically and vibe-wise, things are very much on a
sour (rather than dark) tip, maybe it's just the times, but I don't hear
much up-beat music or see it in the faces.  I think we miss the anchor
events of 1993 like Boogie Buffet more than might have been clear a year
ago.  But Sound System, Zendada and Come/Unity, to name just three ongoing
clubs at 1015, show that things can continue.  With the new apartment
complex about to go up across the street and the crackdown on SOMA now
becoming an integral part of the upcoming mayoral race, in particular
I think the good or great moments at 1015 Folsom are to be savored, because
by this time more or less a year from now the venue will be curtailed or
even closed, is my guess.  But there will always be *somewhere* . . .
 
c u in the future

Right after the Dust Brothers finished, I would imagine that at least half of 
the crowd left. The mood went from hi-key to lo-key in a matter of minutes! 
That was about 2:30 AM.

This was the low point of that nite...however before that cheezy event
Kris had everyone kickin ass with the best set that my humble ass has heard
in a long time. Also a funny story about that DJ: One of our group, an unknown
DJ, had earlier informed me that a lot of DJs will never let u see the title
of songs they are playing etc. so that they can keep their finds secret :) 
During Kris' set, at one stage, he asked Kris what song he was playing...and
not only did he get the name of the song.. Kris GAVE him a second copy of the
album he was playing from.. "HERE", he said, "Take this" Absolutely floored 
our buddy!

jaysus...:) 
sometimes mebbe we gotta bring the vibe with us! 
I went downstairs
after the DIVA showed up (she sucked). Stayed there all nite. 
But damn!  If we can't have fun 
jammin to Markie, Jeno and Taj... man, we must be spoiled :)
Also at one stage.. Jeno was playin downstairs and Garth was playing
upstairs... u gotta admit that that's a RICH choice...
Anyway I had a blast.. and found the vibe :)
but with respect to both the Troc on Thursday nite AND
1015 Folsom on Friday nite.. the BEST stuff happened, for me anyway, 
before 2:30 AM... i.e., Doc Martin and the Dust Brothers on Thurs, 
and Kris on Friday.

If it was just greed, this would be an isolated incident. Unfortunately it
seems that there is a concerted attempt to contain and control youth
culture in general and rave culture specifically.
-----------------------

[much frightening, but apparently [dare I say it?!?!?] true stuff deleted...]

This is not an Isolated System, but rather an interlinked
global-legal hegemony. But if we maximise our positives, we can stop this
before we get to the point of no return.
---------------------------

yes, the straight white christian right wing corporate overlord *IS* that
fucked, believe it.  The question is how do we counter this?  This is
shaping up to be one of the challenges *our* generation must face.  We've
been handed an incredibly corrupt system, and ignoring it won't make it go
away, nor is it a suitable response, it's time to wake up and smell the
coffee.  It will destroy the planet and all else with it if we don't
intervene; the questions are where, how and when, IMHO...1 thing seems to be
that we need to pool our collective "bargaining power" together in ways
yet TBD.  Any ideas?

Personally, I think it adds to the
experience.

The club is pretty cool-- its been called New York-ish.  Used to be hoppin'
Wed/Thu, often a $3-$8 cover.  Haven't gone in a while
---------------------

I feel some responsibility to clear things up since I was the
person who posted the warning.  It DOES add to the experience, the
tenderloin is a trip, it is an extremely interesting place in many
respects; this club is also a landmark night spot, in that it has
seen several phases and a whole host of varied nightclub goers.
It was a fairly wild place in the early-mid eighties...

I didn't know they had a dress code, however... good thing, I always
wear sneakers...

I was at a gathering called F.A.M.I.L.Y. Saturday night and picked up a
letter of sorts from who I guess would be the promoter(s) of Tribal Funk.
The letter (on day-glo green paper) explained the goals of Tribal Funk, and
explained that there were differences between our two cities...stating
however, that recognizing our differences would allow us to better
understand one another and become a stonger force.  (Duh!  =)  It went on
to ask (since the drive is only 6hrs. between cities) for suggestions as to
how to bring us all together.  I dunno if anybody knows about this but I
thought it'd be nice to mention anyway.  I sure smiled when I read it!!  If
I can dig up the original I'll post it in full.


Frick out!

Congrats on a very nice ambient party. The visuals were fun (and fun
to do...) and the music was _great_ all night long. That's very rare
and the DJs should all get warm fuzzies. More warm fuzzies to Mike,
Johnny (Hi!), Gregg, Ann, Mona, Joe, Ethan, Bryce, and all the others
who dragged gear and carpet around not for money but because they
wanted to see something like this happen. Only thing I'd suggest about
the next one is make it no-smoking (but the smoke did make my laser
look pretty cool...)

Can't wait until the F&F anniversary... :)

Yeah, I'm gonna drop this line SOON, I've said about all I have to, just
wanna hear the rest, even if only in private mail....

But just 'cause it's free don't mean I have to sit and take it, nor should
anyone. FMR is more than a free party, it used to be a big part of our
community and a chance for everyone to unite. I'd leave it recharged for a
month, and would spend my money greatfully at any wicked knowing it was
worth it. Things have changed this past 6 months.

Lotsa love,

Mijo, complaining is NOT an insult. I have the utmost respect for the 4 DJs
and they have catalyzed the most important episode of my life. I am always
going to remember all the magic that happened thru them. 

The whole problem with this list or any discussion is that people take too
many things personally, can't handle criticism or different ideas. The fact
is, tho, wicked's not got its shit together. If they need help, we'll join
'em. If they want to keep certain people away (those who can't sacrifice a
midweek engagement) we'll do a seperate one.

No one is stealing wicked's show. Wicked rocks. Sometimes the setting
sucks. Sometimes they flake. But a weekend-bound full moon will not affect
those die-hards who say "screw wednesday, I'm going to Wick's FMR".....

The whole problem with this list or any discussion is that people take too
many things personally, can't handle criticism or different ideas.
---------------

Word.  I've seen a surprising amount of "religion" in this respect; I'd
say it's time to stop creating idols, wicked DOES rock, although it's
lately been diffused, likely by their well deserved success.  I do get
extremely annoyed, however, by the inability of list members to hear any
criticism of certain entities; wicked isn't the only one, but it surely
IS one of those entities that folks don't want to hear being criticized.
I agree they need to take their thing further underground; a friend of
mine had his nose broken at that last Bonnie Doon gig, and this is the
kind of thing that I assume wicked is trying to avoid by going further
underground.  However, there definitely is a group of "in the know" types
surrounding not only wicked but the SF rave scene in general that seem
to be into that "beautiful people" or "special people" or "chosen ones" or
the club-kid ego trip thing; deny it if you want, but I believe that Milton
is sounding an alarm that is long overdue.  There's a growing clique
mentality that is the reason I quit going out to clubs in the first place;
I don't like that club-kid mentality and it's definitely been on the
rise lately....  For example, the gigs thrown by friends and family, & by
Bryce and crew have had a marked distinction from the more "commercial"
parties; that attitude is generally not at the friends and family events,
which (IMHO) is one big reason that everyone likes them so much.

So, it appears that we maybe should get busy rather than complaining,
which is even better!  I would be happy to help organize, scout, or
whatever, I've already offered my services to the cloud factory folks
and would be willing to help any other interested parties as well.

JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR, OK?  I'm an atheist,
afterall...;-)

warning ** non-rave related ** warning

wall street journal television is looking for someone who can talk to
them (anonymously if necessary) about computer system security,
specifically, breaking in.  ideally they are looking for someone who
can appear on camera in NYC (again, anonymously if necessary) for a
taping in the next day or two.

this is apparently in response to a recent New York Times article
about a christmas day break in.  the person doing the piece has an
email address which i'll pass on to anyone who wants to talk with her.
she has indicated that she is interested in getting the big picture,
though anything is possible with the press, she sounds like she is
hoping to desensationalize / make more realistic some of the
inaccurate info in the NYT.

if someone could send me a pointer to the cypherpunk mailing list, i'd
appreciate it, this sounds like a good opportunity to educate people.

(sameer: this also sounds like a good opportunity to plug your service
if you use secure measures to guarantee privacy.  she seemed really
interested in this angle --- the "if you want to be secure and you use
an online service, you should use a secure online service" tack.)

anyhow, please contact me if you are interested, and i'll forward
email on to her so she can get back to you.  feel free to use any of
the anonymous email remailer services if that is appropriate.

Mijos, recently someone posted a query about free radio  berkeley, the
happy pirate on the run's thang, Stephen Dunifer.

Well, an Oakland Federal District judge (Claudia Wilken) ruled in FRB and
Dunifer's favor recently, and the FCC can no longer touch the micro-power
station. But they'll try something else, later.

104.1 FM airs on sundays, usually, on a 10 watt transmitter. Last week's
message(jingle):
           "What we need is liberty,
            not no stinkin' laws
            freedom from the FCC
            and their money grubbin' paws
            Hi, hi, mateys,
            oh, good ole pirate radio.
            Land of the free,
            home of the brave
            FCC, roll in your grave."
Ahhh, ain't it sweet to gloat sometimes? It's all about money and freedom.
The FCC charges 100 thousand big ones to grant people the right to transmit
from a 100 watt transmiter. They claim it blocks airplane
navigation/communication systems. You figure it out.

This means that maybe soon, you can set up a station with limited reach as
a local outlet and regional showcase. Hmm, this and the internet, maybe Big
Bro's asleep.

Anyway, it's in the papers, I saw it in the
(lame,unquestioning,conservative) Daily Cal.  Way to go! I feel better for
the first time since the elections!
Maybe there is hope for Amerika after all...................

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.............

talking about Vibe is easily as hard as talking about the music
I thought there was plenty of vibe at the party - is there some "standardized"
form of Vibe that we measure different parties against?  I enjoy different
kinds of music, different kinds of parties, and Different Kinds of Vibes.

Personally, I got there kinda late (for me) and thought "Wow, this is crazy
the way the upstairs has so many people these days ..." - then I ran into
a bunch of friends for hugs and saw some other friends who'd been out of town. 
I found all sorts of energy pockets on the dance floor both upstairs and
downstairs (I enjoyed Garth) -  I got smiles from all sorts of cute happy
folks getting down - total strangers offered me juice and smokes.

How do you describe a flavor of vibe?
there was some form of "vibe" - even if the best way to recognize it
was the lack of your pile on the floor and think deep raver thoughts vibe
Or *whatever* you think Vibe is

that was a 7 on the club-kid vibe scale, i'd say a 2 for the blowpop
sunshine statistic and a bullish 16 on the mid-party sweaty belly button
index ...

If you want your kind of party to happen, make it happen! In general,
criticism only results in resentment, but action makes vibe.

If there's a party you really like, put your energy into making it
happen! You'll help keep it alive, and give it your own personal
energy. Nothing has been so satisfying for me as seeing this energy
not only palpable in the room, but then magnified far beyond anything
I could do... All promoters need help; if you just ask, they will be
happy to give you lots to do.

Or throw your own! Easier done than said, except perhaps finding a
space (the bane of all promotion). Lots of people are just looking for
an excuse to party.

For parties that just need some remedying, provide some of the remedy.
Help them to work out logistics, to fix problems.

Finally, if you want more great parties than you can stand, find
spaces for the promoters that throw those great parties. That's the
hardest part for them. If spaces were easy, there's be smorgasraves
every weekend. Help them make it happen.

(I figured that when I move to the bay, the best way to get myself to
look for outdoor spaces would be to buy a motorcycle :). On a sunny
day, don't even bother calling... :))

Does anyone kow if DJ Dan works for Dynamix?  There is a DJ Dan making his
first east coast apearance ever this Saturday, January 28, 1995 in
Connecticut at a rave called Paradise.  I was wondering if there were two,
or if he won't be at one of these locations.  I know that there is a Dan DC
from somewhere in the east coast, but he isn't the one playing.  If anyone
can give any info, much obliged =)

I was sad to miss Organic and the Hardkiss chorus at Caesar's last Friday,
but was able to hear lots of posi-vibes from those who went to *Eschew*
afterward.  I'm curious if anyone among us was lucky enough to attend the
party following Organic at an *unbelievable* central SF, 4-floor, truly
vintage Victorian.  As if that weren't enuf, the trance floor, which is
permanently installed in the original formal dining room, featured
Superstar dj *Keoki* who was rumored to have flown in via his trademark
magic carpet ;-}. 

I have lots of questions to ask if you were among The
Blessed with a ticket to this party.  
				Someone lay it down in detail *NOW*

I hope that this "cilque-ish" and "in the know special people" type of 
attitude is not becoming as wide spread in San Francisco as I am being 
led to believe from reading the various posts to the list.  We don't have 
many clubs or raves here in Sacramento and so coming to SF is very 
special to me because I always get a feel good feeling that I don't ever 
get here in Sac.  When Ooga Booga existed, I felt like if I didn't know 
everyone there, I was a nobody.  It was like a fashion show - look who I 
know fest.  I just hope this won't become an epidemic....
luv,
Amy

I personally don't think i could have been happier except
if they had actually stopped letting people in at some point
(although i probably would have been one of the people
not let it, so maybe not :)

Komotion was overly packed for an hour or two and 
it was quite claustrophobic and unbearably stuffy...
i didnt really mind the smoke so much as the fact
that the smoke adn all the other air wasn't able to go anywhere
and i almost had a few serious attacks of claustrophobia
cuz i also couldnt make it to the door over the bodies
strewn across the floor...

but that all ended soon enough and it was happy happy times from then on
(as compared to just happy times before that)

Ummm.. not mentioned so far was a beautiful set by torsion
(aka bryan campbell aka the first guy to post to the socal-raves list :)
 
It sucks that there were major equipment problems for him,
cuz listening to the DAT that he made,
it would have been more than an incredible experience
had he had everything up an running

Velocette also had some pretty rad stuff that i was quite in love with
although teasing my with faintly audible 303 lines
was not nice at all

Other highlights... the woman with the Dige.. was really cool
cuz i thought it was some wierd mix of the song

Jonah's ambient jungle section of his set
and definitely Nick playing "Nervous Acid" 
at the end of an otherwise completely ambient set

and that guy who finished was okay too ;)

as the woman said at like 6 AM

ventilation could have been improved if more people had taken responsibility
to ensure no smoking in the big room. everybody who's been to komotion before
knows about the No Smoking policy in the big room, and why it's there.  And
that includes all substances, except for a small amount (as we discussed
about the next to last party) of incense.  I love incense, and i smoke 
tobacco, and i always do it near the door or outside;  i strongly recommend
others do the same, and suggest the same to folks who they see lighting up. 

there is also a tradeoff that can
be made between running as much equipment as we did from the loft and running
a very powerful exhaust blower that was capable of cooling down one of the
dance parties we held there.

as far as the overcrowding goes, it's really a tough call as to ~when~ to
start holding people up at the door.   also, once the decision is made, a
number of people (not just one or two) need to help make that happen at 
the door.  having had to say "you can't come in" now a number of times, it's
not easy, and it's important to have the support of several other people
to share the burden of explaining why to people in as nice a way as possible.

Well, it really doesn't matter who these people know or how proud of it they
are unless you make it important to you.  There's plenty of stuff to do in SF.

Hi gang:

A while back I asked the list for suggestions about getting a personal
Internet account.  After getting information about a few vendors, I've
signed on with Hooked.  They use the "Pipeline" net client, which uses
TIA for net connectivity; it's much faster than my Chameleon software which
uses SLIP.  Hooked provides a (beta) net browser which only shows graphics
on demand.

Hooked hasn't beeen accepting new customers for a while, since they are growing
too fast and it's been very hard to log in.  To allieviate this, they`re
currently letting people dial in via a Compuserve packet node and they're
eating the $3/hr cost.  Sounds like they care to keep their customers!
I get unlimited hours. for $25/month.  Downside: their overloaded server
is sort of a useless place to telnet to & I wouldn't want to have to
use it for shell accounts; I plan to explore this a little more.

Anyone shopping for net access ought to give hooked a call, IMO. I have
also heard that sirius is a good one to try; no personal experience with
them, though.

Not much to add to this discussion except:  
 
I FUCKIN LOVED IT!!!! 

 
I went to the gig at BARS which did have rotten bouncers and  
$1 water, but also had a whole lot of people who really went off. 
I was skeptical at first since I'm usually pretty bored by the metal 
scene.  And I thought maybe it was a bad idea to be waering sneakers
instead of boots.  But after hanging around for a bit I realized there
was a lot more metal in people's bodies than on their clothes, lot of body 
paint and animal costumes and tattoos & stuff.  Seemed like as 
the evening went on I saw more people who looked like ravers.  The opening
band was excuricatingly awful, especially 'cause they  
kept making lame muttering political speeches that I *agreed* with 
more or less; kind of gave concern for the oppressed a bad name. 
But Crash Whorship (oops, meant to say Worship, no ... really!) finally
came on and all was forgottn.  There was a mighty high percentage 
of do-ers to watchers, to borrow "unknown"'s metric.  People were jumping, 
howling, dancing from  the get.  
Provocations of all the senses, magnesium flares, strobe

lights, smoke, and the infamous squirting unknown liquids, catalyzed us to
go beyond audience to sentience.  It was time to go over the edge or leave
the room. The central dance area was boundaryless mass of slippery bodies. 
It was between a mosh pit and a massage group, it was heavy metal contact 
improv.  I could let myself fall and knew that I would 
be lifted or tossed or shoved in some direction before I could hit the
floor.  Random grabbing, be it for balance, a caress, or to get
someone out of the way, was the order of the moment.    
For minutes on end, the universe was naught but but skin and love and
muscle sweaty maple syrup and smoke and desire and fear and wet and
gripping and inner peace at a hundred miles an hour and skids and hugs and shoves
and the smell of mustard.   

And there were a lot more women than I'd have
imagined.  I'd been down for more of a "testosterone vibe", but there were
maybe 20 per cent women in dance area, which might have been part of why it
felt so damn *safe* in there.  With all that swirling surgin stompin, I
think the sight of a few crucifixes would have freaked me out & I was
relieved to see a shirt reading "Dykes From Hell".  I didn't realize till
the end of the show that lead precussionist is a woman (nope,didn't take a 
census)  For all the fire-circle dances and line dances and pushing, 
my feet didn't get stepped on hardly ever, and I managed not to stomp
anybody either.  Oh, and there was some music too.  Daemonic precussion,
swooping electronic bleats, somebody with a trombone(?), amplified moans
and mutterings.  For me anyway, the use of touch and smell and even
taste to the event made for truly transcendent experience.  There was 
nowhere to hide, no compartment for self-awareness to peer out of.  It
was the same sort of ego loss I felt at my very first raves, but more 
physically involving.  One didn't have to consciously suspend disbelief.
The interplay between "leadership" and participation was ideal.  Without
the participation, Crash Worhsip would be little more than mis-placed
circus acts with a drum corps. But this bunch are really on to something, 
they've gone deep into the territory between art and magick.  
(OK, so much for theory.)

After the beastly bouncers chased us out, the party moved out into the
street, where our frenzied energies drew down a most welcome rain shower.
 Oh damn, my disposable painters coveralls were simply *ruined*!  Took a
while to calm down after all this.  The next day, after perhaps five hours
and light and interrupted sleep, I felt alert and glowing, like I'd taken a
final exam or run a 10K. 
 
If this was an "inferior" Crash Worship gig, I can't wait for a real one!

Some of you had asked me to post when I get on the net and  leave my 
email adress.  Here it is 

peterf@netcom.com

After just being on for about a week I find it to be a great way to get 
to know some ravers alittle better.  Very often I don't take the time to 
get to know people more at raves because it can be very difficult to 
communicate verbally with loud music.  Also much of the time I'm feeling 
so high from my enhanced connection to the oneness of the whole 
experience, that it can be difficult to shift my focus away from that to 
individuals, and I don't have that much of a desire to do so, being that 
I having so much fun dancing.  Sorry I missed the last ambient party.

I'm the opening DJ for the weekly Sound System club at 1015 Folsom this
Friday the 27th, scheduled for 11:00 pm to 12:30 am.  I believe the
schedule then has residents Corey and Keith Crusher.  The last one I
went to was $5 with the flyer and $10 without, but I haven't seen any
flyers for this one since I'm in Portland so I'm not exactly sure about
that.  Anyway, once you're in you can also check out the concurrent
scenes in the gold room (Cafe Bohemia, disco-ey), upstairs (Dig!, hip hop)
and downstairs (Zendada, pro-house), if things work the way they did
previously this month.

For sentimental value alone it's a big deal for me to play in the big
room at 1015.  I expect clashy beats galore but plenty'o'fun wax and
hope you can come and enjoy :-)

c u in the future!

After having a pretty good time at the "stompy productions" thingie at
Club Touche (300 DeHaro x 16th) last week, I was calling around to find
out what was going on tonight. I called the club at 861-8990 and found
out that it is happening again this Wednesday Jan 25, 10-4AM w/ Mark
Farina, John Howard, and Suiki.

Mini-review: Although I was thoroughly unimpressed with the "vibe" at
first, it progressively got better later in the night as the music got
more interesting and the crowd got happier. There was certainly a lot
of "beautiful people" there, who were fun to watch, but not very
friendly. In addition to the BP's there were also some  inner-circle
folks in attendance, e.g. Garth. Fortunately, there were enough people
just into dancing (as opposed to posing) that made the event pretty
fun. In addition, the music kicked good n' funky.

Eventually I ran into some people I've been seeing at SF's classic
raves (FMRs, GG-park, Pacific) for a long time and felt a bit more
comfortable w/ the crowd. The space itself is quite comfortable, w/ a
good soundsystem, nice lights, friendly staff/security/etc.

In my search to find whether this 300 Deharo thing was happening
tonight,  I also, I found out that Stompy is also having an event on
Sat Jan 28th (267-7615) w/ Harry Who, Mark Farina, and Jeno.

PS: thanks to Matt for posting about the event at 300 DeHaro last Wednesday.

can point out the outstanding ones, then I can ask them to put them aside 
for me and avoid the hustle.

As long as I'm around I'm giving all kinds of hell to the club-kid
theme/meme... and, of course, will continue to act "like myself"
which is quite "not" club kid-like in any manner of being.  I know
without asking there are many like me (yay!).  And better still,
there are others unlike me!  And that's ok!  And they don't know
anyone I know!  How grand!  Are we having fun yet?  ABSOLUTELY!

This has about as much to do with raving as UFOs, but this Saturday is 
the last day of a pretty cool exhibit of Buddhist art at the Asian Art 
Museum in SF.  Colorful, esoteric stuff.  So if you happen to be up all 
nite this friday and aren't yet ready to crash, the museum opens at 10am.

Greetings!

I have some good friends who have been involved with SFR for some time
who have a dead Mac they need some help repairing in order to get back
on line.  These folks don't have much money, but have other things to
offer in trade for anyone's assistance.  They think the problem may be
in the power supply, but don't really know.  If you can help them, or
know someone who can, please let me know, and I will put you in touch
with them.  Help bring Monica and Tom back to the online world!  We'll
all benefit from their presence.

Hey Grey, Feels funny meeting you here.  I've never been to that 
gardening thing.  I'm a little reluctant to go to that 55 natoma location.
The last couple of times I've been there wasn't to good.  The last time I 
was there they had the place segregated with people over 21 able to go 
upstairs, and under only able to stay downstairs.  Then at 2am they 
turned up the lights and told everyone under 21 to get out.  Talk about a 
vibe killer.   But I've heard a few good things about the gardening there 
on mondays.

Hi Folks,

If you read the calendar, you might have noticed the addition of the
Pre-Rave Info Line at the bottom of the list.  Unfortunately, I gave
Derek the wrong number (ack!).   The correct number is 415-522-3848.
(not 533).  

I have nothing planned yet, but on Saturday I'll setup dinner and
coffee 7-9 somewhere in the city.  

This line is a resource I'd like to share with ravers.  If you have
an event that isn't a rave but you would like to invite ravers, I'll
list it.  I'm also looking for a couple volunteers to help me with
the line.  I'll also list any post rave info that I come across.  

Finally, the line is attached to my pager.  If you need help, I'll
do my best to aid you.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

Had a great time at generations of love at 1015 folsom.  There wasn't the 
amount of high energy as community but it had a more intimate feel, with 
a nice happy love vibe.  There wasn't quite the showing they were hoping 
for.  There was music in 3 rooms.  The couple of times I went downstairs, 
there was nobody there.  Most of the people stayed in the big room which 
made for a nice crowd.  The music was great, making it difficult to take 
a rest.  I was able to squeeze in a couple of short rests in the chill 
room.  There was a nice atmosphere there with the music volume being just 
right  for me.  Loud enough to drown out the other room and low enough to 
have a conversation without shouting, which I feel I have to do sometimes 
in there.  Had to leave at 4am, although it took me at least 15-20minutes 
to get out the door.  As I was walking out that music just pulled me back to 
the dance floor for another spin.

The Generation of love
======================

This week,  Rick Bloom from Indiana came out to meet me for the very first
time.   He's been reading my reports in "alt.rave",  and came out to meet
me,  as well as return a car to one of his freinds in the bay area.

When he wrote me,   telling me of his intention of coming to visit me
and to rave with me,  I warned him that it might be difficult to keep
up with me,   but he held up pretty well.   So we made plans to head
out to Generatios of Love on Thursday.

So,  On Wednesday,  we head out to the Haight,  where I check into
AMEBA (Rave central) to visit Mark.   I Also picked up the Tracy
tape of her New Years party at Cyberlab 7.    WOW!! - Get this tape!!
You won't be dissapointed....

Thursday, January 26th - Generations of Love
        DJs Tracy, Solar, Tony Fader, Jim & Jeno
        Live: Hardkiss Music & DubTribe
        Ambience: Darkhorse  Charles Uzzell Edwards  Jason
        the San Francisco House Movement comes together to benefit Project
        Open Hand at 1015 Folsom, Planet San Francisco
        admission - 3 cans of nutritious food
        10pm-6am.  415.435.8675


Well,  for a Thursday "middle of the weeker" party,   this one really WENT
OFF.   Tracey spun the most insane set, and I entered a really deep trance
state that put this huge grin on my face,  as I was hopping around like a
mad man,  grinning with the biggest fattest smile all evening long.

I think the longest time I spent NOT dancing was about 10 minutes,   and
with the party going on until 6 am (I just LOVE these partys that go till
6 am or later....)   Rick was really enjoying himself,  then when we
talked in the chill area,   I said "Welcome home!!!"...

The party was at 1015 Folsom (My favorite venue).   Hardkiss and Dubtribe
doing live sets in the chill area downstairs.   For only 3 cans of food,   
What a bargain!!

It's parties like these that really restore my faith in the SF rave scene.

So,  tonight,  it's Venus!!  I just hope the rain stops before tonight...
Hope to see U there... and hope I can make it...

I felt like a total ass in the mornign when i overheard
someone say "well people arent supposed to smoke in the main room
just by the entrance, that's how it was at the last F&F"

BUT... it would be a good idea to put up things like
signs and stuff liek that, because not everybody
there had been to Komotion before and don't know
what the house rules are and all...

I wasn't really thinking when i was smoking,
i was worrying more about the cool shapes teh smoke
was making in the laser :)

ps Any sfravers subscribe to a Galaticomm BBS other than Liberty; please
let me know so that we can get together online via chat. Also maybe start
a weeky online discussion. Galaticomm BBS's better than Netcom, CRL or the
Well. Talk to me about subscribing to Liberty. They pay you to bring in
new members; and if you join you can get paid to bring in new members. 
Its $25 with no setup charge for full internet access; e-mail(Internet &
Majornet), gopher, archie, telnet, USnet, LINUX, virtual slipp soon to be
PPP; ..etc, lots of files, lots of online games, game connect and
multiplayer ganes, QWKMail offline reader, $25 month gets you 4 hours of
access each day; with the option to do more; Worldlink & Chatlink
networks. If you bring in i think like 8 people its free for you to use
the service; If you bring in more you get paid cash$$$$; a check each
month its really a good deal. Also local dialup numbers no Pacbell or
Sprintnet x.25 charges(is available though) no long distance call; or for
extra you can join a concertic network that claims to have no net lag; 
thats $30 a month extra. 

pss it's really good; they had some problems when i first joined and there 
all fixed now. I've been a member for 3 months now and i told them that 
I wouldn't recommend them until they got their stuff together. and they 
did so now i'm recommending them. the only down side is that the 
interface if you not using slip is a little criptic on galaticom.

Hi Peter (welcome to email),

The Gardening Club doesn't happen in the club space, it happens in the
resturant only.  It's a very cool space that never seems to hot or
smokey, theres a very nice chill section with bean backs and carpet.
Its 18+ because it happens in the resturant.  I just with it went
later.

Ciao,

PT

Hi all,

The following is the lastest transcript from the Pre-Rave info line:

Thank you for calling the Pre-Rave Info Line.  You can skip this

yes, it's the superbowl..but at last..it's stopped raining!  doesn't it make
you want to go to a rave?

the new moon is happening sunday starting about 3 or so..and going on all
night.  dj update:  solar, tracy, hardkiss, ronan, darkhorse...i may have 
left out some names...i'll post again later just in case anyone wants to
know...(!) 

anyway, this is happening at somebody's house & will happen even if it does
start raining again.

as usual, we are asking everybody to show respect for the neighborhood, the
town, the planet.  bring food to share and also warm clothes.  this is somewhat
of a rustic location about an hour's drive up the coast from sf.  um, if you
want me to email you directions, let me know!

seeyou!

Well, apparently there was a big schedule shuffle this week for Sound
System since Dub Tribe is touring in the east coast.  I did get to play
but it was between 10 and 10:45 when the place was basically empty.
Nobody there complained too much about my mixing so I suspect I'll get
another shot at it :)  The Rane mixer they use is especially sensitive
in the higher range of the sliders, unlike the Numarks or Geminis, it
really cranks up with just a touch on the sliders at the high end, so
it was good for me to get a workout with that.

After me were weekly residents Corey and Keith, and then various Hardkiss
types playing some really good toonz, even venturing somewhat above the
125 bpm mark, which was good.

I played mostly vocal house (in fact, about half the vocal tracks I've got)
but I really want to go back with the system cranked up playing some of the
faster-trancier stuff!

Afterwards I went over to Il Pirata (16th & Utah) where Freaky Friday was
holding forth, I arrived right at the end of a set and right before Jeno
came on for a bit over an hour.  Neils was there too and will vouch for
the high quality of Jeno's set, it's been a long, long time since I've
enjoyed one of his that much.  There were only about 30 people up and
dancing but it was definitely a groove!  And a nice relaxed hangin-out
scene in the bar.  I think Il Pirata is definitely a good new spot and
all three nights I've been there I've had a good time.

My name *is* on the Sound System flyer for last night, after all, so I guess
it ranks overall as a positive experience.  Next week, btw, Rawno from XLR8R
will be there no doubt doing *really good* garage/vocal house.  If you're
in need of a Friday night outing, the Folsom/Il Pirata combo is a pretty OK
one.  

c u in the future

Well folks, this is a warning so that none of you would go through what
I've been through last night... You see, despite my friend's warning, I
decided to show up at the weekly Indonesia... IT WAS HORRIBLE! That party
lacked good music and even though the small crowd had good vibes, it was
not enough to conceal how boring the party was. I mean, I was on e, and I
was still bored... Very bad in my book... The worst thing was that when the
music started to get good, the owner shut the place down... at 2:30 AM!!!
Sheesh... Talk about ten dollars wasted... Anyways, everyone, trust me,
don't venture into Indonesia, than again, I am sure everyone online is much
smarter than I am and have stayed away from it all along... Sigh... I need
a hug...

Anyways, hope to see you folks at Liquid Groove tonight! 

**HUG**

Party!

So,  how much will it cost?   Is it 21+ 

I might be willing to try that venue again,  Yuk!!   I might show up
if some kind SFRaver sho has a car,  can pick me up!!   :-)

If anyone who lives in Marin, planning to go out to either Stompy or XYZ?
I would very much like a ride,  ad can certainly kick in some $$ for gas
ad bridge tolls.

Please let me know...   I'll be checking my email frequently.   I really 
want to go out tonight and spread more love and energy!!   :-)

What about U PTiger?   Are U going through here this evening?

I'll also see U at Mama's in Mill Valley...  This will be interesting.

I'll vouch for that, second, and even third Phred's opinion!

I fell sound asleep around 7PM last night due to eating a turkey
sandwich at a local deli (dat tryptophan thang you know)... woke up at
midnight and decided I had to rave. Called a few places and according
to my calculations, it sounded like Freaky Friday at 16th and Utah
would be the most underground event with a big-name DJ (Jeno). All the
other numbers I called sounded kinda questionable, I've had a good time
at "move" at 16th&Utah, so I decided to check it out.

Word. What he said. It was fun, and a very "different" Jeno from the
usual club fare. More interesting material, IMHO, than Jeno usually 
plays.

Has this happened to you before-
        I am not in SF nor was I when this happened but I thought it was
pretty groovy so I wanted to write about it. Some friends and I went to
Nebulous at Saltair (an old ballroom/dancehall on the shores of the Great
Salt Lake, SLC,Ut). Garth and Carlos were spinning along with some local
Mechanized DJ's. Anyway, really good music and then they did this really
groovy thing in the middle of it. While Carlos was spinning a live
saxaphone and trumpet player got on the stage and grooved along with what
Carlos was spinning. It was really coooooooooooool - o . Everyone got
really into it. It was great. I hope this is part of a new tradition.

        Just thought I'd share the input. Also watch for more great films
coming out this year from the Sundance Film Festival:
        "The incredibly true adventures of Two girls in love"-I'm straight
and I loved it.
        "Super 8 & 1/2" A gay porno, I had to walk out after 20 minutes but
seemed like a campy little  flick if you can stand the hardcore sex.
        "Little Odessa" Tim Roth - need I say more. Anyway good flick.
Check it out.
        "Before Sunrise" Cheezy even though it was by the same guy who did
"Dazed and Confused"

        Anyway - enough from me.
        Thanks

Hi All,

I moved the time of the pre-rave gathering back two hours to 1:30pm
accomodate the change in start time of the Deep Blue New Moon rave.

Here's the info line message:

Thank you for calling the Pre-Rave Info Line.  You can skip this
announcement at any time by pressing the # key.  There has been a
change in the schedule as of yesterday.

Today, Sunday the 29th, there will be a pre-rave brunch around 1:30pm at
Mama's Royal Cafe in Mill Valley. This event is scheduled before the 3pm
Dark Blue New Moon Rave located not too far away. Note that the time has
been moved back 2 hours from yesterday.  Directions to Mama's Cafe
are as follows:

        Take the 101 north from the Golden Gate Bridge or south from the
        Richmond/San Rafael Bridge.  Exit at the Mill Valley/Stinson
        Beach/Highway One exit.  At the stop sign turn left and follow the

        Ave.  Mama's Cafe is on the right after a block or so. The address
        is 387 Miller Ave.

Any ravers interested in the superbowl.  I haven't met many ravers 
interested in sports.  I know that competition thing is somewhat 
anti-ravey.  But this is our sf 49er's, a pretty ravey team if you think 
about it.  They have a strong sence of unity amongst each other.  With 
Deon Sanders theres alot more dancing on the team, especially after a 
touchdown.

ptiger posted that the pre-party gathering got moved back to 1:30 PM.  
i'll e-mail you the directions, and leave them on your phone.  Anyone 
else who wants directions, there are now maps at Ameba.  Or call the 
voice mail, (415)267-3076.  Or e-mail me and i'll send you the written 
directions.  

The music should start around 3PM.  We'll have ambient in one house and 
dance in another.  After dark the dance house will get more 
ambient/trancy too.  And for even more ambient, try the waves and 
stars down on the beach :)

						hope to see you there,

Has this happened to you?

I think it was around 2:30am or so, maybe 3.... Harry Who had whipped the
crowd into steamy hotness with lots of fresh funky sounds.  King st was
looking very cheery.  Not cheesey but cheery.  The crowd was moving like a
runaway train.  Jeno did some solid energy surges... housey not housey
techno not techno fast and slow up and down back and forth and then
suddenly..... bleeps and blips tweaks and squeaks higher and higher harder
and harder and OH - My - GOD!! The musical orgasm!  A warming
sensation.... tingly all over... shivers down the spine and every single
solitary muscle struggling to somehow express the feeling of pure
happiness.  

Was it good for you too?

Have you tried Time Out Magazine they usually have a pretty comprehensive 
list of all the clubs and parties in London. Although they won't let you 
know about the mega massive raves (usually 2/3 hours drive outside London 
anyway), or the underground ones or industry parties.
	Well if you need more info drop me a line, I've lived in London 
80% of my life so I can help you find your way. Also if your gonna check 
out the local rave scene be sure to try double dipped dolphins, they will 
fuck you up with about 400 mgs of the best e in the world |)

Hello all!
Liquid Groove was simply FABULOUS and I have to share the positive vibes I
got with everyone online! I got so much positive vibes and love, I just
HAVE to share it with others some how!
I arrived at the party shortly after eleven, and the crowd was GREAT!
Everyone was smiling and having a good time. The music was awesome, and as
the evening progresses, it got even better. As more people showed up, the
positive energy got greater! I met so many wonderful people, and I love
them all. This was definitely one of the best party I have been to in a
long time. It wasn't a big commercialized party, instead, it was intimate
underground sorta event. I candy-flipped and danced from eleven to six in
the morning. My joints are sore and possibly swollen, but I had a wonderful
time. The only complaint I had was that water was not readily available, I
mean, I am familiar with paying for water, but at one dollar a pop, I
quickly ran out of money, and had to ask for water from everyone on the
dance floor, but the cool thing was that everyone was willing to share.
Maybe Groove Trip should hook up a tap water hose for their next party...
However, over all, it was definitely worth the ten dollars I paid (and they
were giving away free candy! Yumm!)
Anyways, if anyone online was there and didn't get to meet me, I was the
one in the red cross/M*A*S*H long t-shirt and baggy skater pants, and
hopefully I'll get to meet other people online at the next party!

I LOVE YOU ALL!

**HUG**

Sincerely,
Brian "dragonfly" Wang

Although the candy probably made you thirstier would be my guess,  there
should always be at least tap water for free.  Maybe next time seek out the
promoters and tell them it was great party but that they really need to
consider having FREE water available, this is a very, very important issue.

The newmoon party was really great for  a while.  I got there about 8pm.  It 
had a nice friendy laid back feel when I first got there.  Perfect to do 
alittle dancing and a good enviroment to talk and get to know people.  I 
was able to meet a few sfravers  that I never knew before.  I immediately 
senced a special bond after finding they were also on the net.  When 
Tracy came on the energy level took an incredable surge.  All that 
energy,and in a house, giving it a nice intimate feel, gave way to some 
indescribable magical moments.  About two and a half hours worth.  
Unfortunately there was a sound complaint, which brought about a sudden 
shift to a complete 
ambiant party.  With the drop in energy,  I knew after  a little while 
that it was time to go and hope to get some sleep so I could be in 
somewhat decent shape for work tommorrow.  Driving thru the dark wet 
roads I felt somewhat lost as I seem to has missed a turn.  Interesting 
and somewhat comforting  another car with ravers pulled up next to me and 
told me they were lost as well and wanted to follow me.
Later on we went our separate ways as we drove thru some town on the way 
to the freeway.  Starting to sence the upcoming freeway I suddenly see a 
cop 
flashing his lights at me.  He told me I was speeding, I told him I was 
lost.  After giving me a little lecture on driving safely, he gave me 
directions and no ticket.  He probably either felt sorry for me or maybe 
all the love energy I was carrying with me from the party made him feel 
good and not feel the need to give me the ticket. Probably a little of 
both.

xyz at santa cruz auditorium was one of the more boring times I've had in 
my life. Seriously.  to start off, the $20 bass tickets were quite a 
downer.  Next, seing loads of gangsters getting drunk outside surely 
didn't help.  After standing outside and talking to my friends, we 
decided to go in anyway. outside of the dancefloor area several booths 
were set up (journees, boarderline, etc.) including one that I'd never 
heard of before called matrix.  They sold some pretty trippy alien stuff 
and were just overall friendly people.  The inside had some pretty cool 
visuals and lighting.  Unfortunately, the decks were set up on stage and 
way far away from the crowd which kinda sucks.overall the muzic was 
acshully pretty good.  Although Dan never played on four turntables (as 
promised on the flyer), Spun took his place (on 2).  Jon Bishop (at 
least I think that it was jon Bishop!) played a really cool set that got 
everyone groovin pretty good.After taking an extremely long break kickin 
back with my friends in the hall, I came back in to find rick preston 
spinning.  He spun a fucking incredible set!  Absolutely awesome.  He 
played that new Josh Wink song (yeah, that absolutely crazy, intense, 
insane, wacky one!!) and everyone on the dance floor went nuts!!  
	The fog macines in the place were on wayyyyyy to high and it was 
incredibly hard to breathe.  The fact that security kept the doors shut 
didn't help.  The ambient room was also pretty stuffy.  So, basically, 
the muzik, space, vizuals were all ok but.........the crowd just sucked.  
Pretty hard.  The gangster factor was just too high.  Wayyy too many 
people had a scowl on their face.  the atmospere was just pretty tense.  
The only reason I had an OK time was cuz I got to kick back ewith some of 
my close friends.

Yeah, their weekly is plagued by some of that.But heir big party went off
so well, so vibey, I wonder if it is just that the weekly has the
participation of some people that the big one didn't? They have lots of
potential, to be a big regular. I just don't dig ghost......


>I mean, I was on e, and I was still bored... 

No drug can make a bad party good. Never take your that disco biscuit if
you don't already feel a good vibe and a dip in yer hip and a slide in yer
stride. If the music/crowd don't have the magic, that little pill won't
either. 

But your hands will still feel "oh so good" :)

(abba rave sugar line) 
under strict doctor's orders 
to slow dance only this weekend
i compromised and went to Stompy
ummm, and a flat party in the mission
with hiphop dj josh plus one

i like to think when I lose my 
pricey bottled water that it's
a contribution to the party ...

heard Mark Farina and Jeno 
some o their shit completely set me Off

hey, weren't you at...?
i dig wierd convergences
of sync'd-up party hopping 

since i always need to meet more sfravers
and there was a round of stompy outfit predictions
a bit late, i join the fray - jeans, short dark hair,
and imitation crushed fuzzy blue shirt
(please ignore environmental ramifications) 
say hello - feel free to speak in tongues,
use secret code, or communicate via 2+1

Eddie (Adnao) the spirit of Mushroom Jazz past, pulled off GENERATIONS OF
LOVE with $100 of fliers and 100%love, that's it. A benefit for project
open hand. It would be great if we could get some good press from time to
time.

the security, the bartenders, all VOLUNTEERS. The "price" =3 cans of food

Goes to show what some love can do. That place was packed, and almost
everyone there brought their share of cans or more. Door man/security Holly
was pleased as pie to be there, and it seemed everyone else as well.

The year of the heart-sent, heart-bound parties. Prophetic, eh?

First in a series: Raving as a subversive activity

How about non-stop rave radio in the Bay area? I'm sure there is more than
ample audience for a station that could program rave in all its subgenres
from ambient to gabber. And if it can't be done via usual methods, then why
not pirate rave radio? - all it would take is a couple of techies, some
radio widgets, local dj's and nerves o' steal. BTW the recent Free Radio
Berkely / FCC court ruling seems to have created a precedent for other's to
get in on the independant radio act. And then we would all have something
to listen to on those quiet evenings. A great project for a

This is a great idea..
You should talk to Steven Dunifer's lawyer and figure out a way to
proceed.  There is no reason why people should have to pay six figures
in order to start a small community-based radio station.
My guess is that you could, if you played your cards right.. overturn
the laws regulating small radio stations..
Especially now that the Newtroids want to get rid of NPR..
community radio is really important..

when I arrived Tracy had finished and Sarah was spinning. People were 
unhappy with the intense deprogramming chaos which Sarah was sharing with 
us. If It was a boy playing those sounds they would have removed him 
quick, 
as it was the  vibe which Tracy had drawn out was unpredictably turned to 
another face of Eve. Ironicly It was a Diamanda Galas track that got 
Ronan 
Cyril and Galen to their feet. The predictably pleasant ambient beats 
which 
followed brought people to their feet again. I went to sleep with a warm 
sentimental glow in my heart, having finally witnessed the first public 
performance of Nurse w/Wound, Whitehouse, Galas, Current 93 and others, 
played to a drugged audience, which by my observation had never heard the 
gems of a period which I fondly recall

Well,  this is certainly going to be interesting.    But I doubt if the FCC
would allow this,   because almost ALL home transmitters send out signals
on other frequencys,  but I see a time when the FCC "May" allow low power
transmitters (10 watts or less) to be operated if the equipment is "Type
approved".    Hmmm!   That opens up a whole new market,   especially if
Steve can design a filter system to remove harmonics.

I've built many pirate transmitters in my time,  using Ham radio technology,
and even the best designed filtering system couldn't adequately reduce the
harmonics to a tolerable level.

Now,  if Steve can come up with a good filter design cheaply,  he could be
a very rich man,   especially if the FCC relaxes the technical standards
to allow them to be built cheaply.

Getting an existing radio station to try out a new format,  is next to
impossible.    I've discussed this with my friend John who has part ownership
in a radio station,  and getting sponsors (Commercials and ads) to accept
that format is next to impossible.

Dear Sfraves;

	As I was sitting here listening to a Yello CD; I had the most 
profound thoughts. That we; Net People, are Virtual Cybernetic Beings. 
Cybernetics being def. compartive study of electronic computers and the 
human nervous system. A cyborg is part organic life form part silicon 
lifeform. So with this information in mind that makes us; virtual 
cybernetic beings. The virtual part comes into play because we don't have 
computer chips imbedded in us yet; but with our daily use of these 
machines that our outside of us; & the fact that we grow more and more 
dependent on them; makes us VCB's. In fact our nervous system works much 
like computer logic. Current computer logic has two states on and off, 1 
or a 0; >=3.5vdc and <=0.8vdc; respectively. The human CNS(central 
nervous system) and the PNS(peripheral nervous system) also work in a 
similar fasion; meaning two known states only in microvolts. Also 
computer logic is extremely dependent on timing; making sure that a 
nanosecond wide pulse is where is should be within a few picoseconds wide 
window. Also with the human body the timing of pulses is also essential 
for good coordination. For exmaple MS(multiple sclerosis) is an 
autoimmune disease where things called mylen shealths which cover nerves 
are destoried by the bodies own immune system. These shealths speed the 
computer like pulse to the various organs and muscles. When they are 
destoryed the pulses are recieved in a chaotic state hence the lack of 
manual deterity lost by people suffering this disease; this sentance is 
mine own theroy; but the rest of the information is to the best of my 
knowledge factual. We are a lot like computer more so than most people 
think. In fact it's kinda funny and neat; that as create a machine that's 
more like us; I think we will learn a lot more about how we work. Like 
brain structure, memory and organization. I think is fasinating that the 
net is organize in a loss assoiative state. Like the blue words in a 
document that take you to things that are either close in topic or 
assoicated; this in some ways is how we remember thinks; though 
assoication; its sooo cool. I would like to end this with some profound 
prose of my own:

	What is; as a race of beings our fasination with these machines
	What do we see when we stare into that glowing phosphorus screen
	Do we see just computer generated images
	Or do we see the future; our next evolution as a race of beings
	Will we be cybernetic beings with helper chips built into us
	With computer controlled hydraulic limbs, and eyes
	Will Cyberpunk and Blade Runner turn out to be prophesy rather 
	than fiction
	You decide who and what you want to be

I have a digital wristwatch -- what's that make me, a virtual clock? I
fail to find any reason to want to be considererd virtual, or
cybernetic. The biological is much more interesting. Something has gone
awfully wrong when we start alluding god-like capabilities to
technology rather than looking at it as a mere tool to help us
live/explore/learn. This is partially what sickens me about this whole
Cyberpunk thing, because it is teaching whole generations to become 
totally fascinated by machines/death/technology, at the expense of 
what is really important -- being/life/biology. I see this as  the
worship of "false idols" (or cargo-cultism) and it is antithetical to
my world-view. (Don't get me wrong I'm as "cyber" as the next computer
geek, but it's just my job/hobby, not a god.)
 
Yes, we become a "bigger brain" by virtue of being connected on the
internet. We also became a "bigger brain" when we learned to
communicate, to read, write, paint, to publish on paper, or "publish
electronically" etc. Ants and bees communicate through dance and
pheromones, yet nobody goes around calling ants and bees virtual, or
cybernetic -- it's just part of their social fabric. Similarly, maybe
we can use our improved interconnectedness to become more like
ants/bees and communicate better on a societal and species level.

Ultimately, however, we're still biological. Our interconnectedness may
hasten our ability to communicate and discover, and change the way we
socialize. It doesn't change us, it's just a new tool at our disposal.
I think maintaining this perspective is important.

This is useless and false analogy. There are plenty of neurons and
perceptual entities that work in a much more "analog" fashion. More
importantly, even if you can identify on/off states in some neurons,
the whole way the brain works is as different as you can possibly get
from computer logic. For one, it is more massively parallel and
massively interconnected than anything we can possibly conceive of at
the present time. The control structures are nondeterministic at best,
which again goes against anything we're used to in computers.

The brain and neural system operate much more on a "gestalt" level than
any logical system could ever hope to do. Logic is completely
irrelevant at the neural level. The whole reason why cognition seems so
miraculous is because our current mechanistic/reductionistic attempts

works. That which we can't explain becomes magic....

Not to be a dickhead or a nitpicker (actually, I'm both), but this
isn't really true either. Bipolar ECL computers work with negative
voltage, MOS/CMOS/NMOS often have different sensitivity levels, as does
Gallium Arsenide. Many computer chips work at the TTL levels you
describe, but that's mostly an issue of standardization. There are
computers in operation that use light too. I fail to see the point
of your analogy.

This harks back to the old days of cybernetics and AI. In other words,
it is complete bullshit -- your time would be better spent counting how
many angels can dance on the head of a pin than following this 1950's
line of reasoning.

It has long been a goal-em :-) of human desire to be able to
mechanically create intelligence, it will be a long long time (if ever)
before we can create a brain-like machine ourselves. And if we do,
chances are, it'll be something that we pushed the evolutionary and
learning processes of, rather than something created, inna frankenstein
stylee. 

Can you even describe the things you know using logic? -- not a chance,
most everything you do and know is because you and your forbears
existed in the world and environment and learned how to respond to it
both through evolutionary and cognitive processes.This process took
millenia to bear fruit, and it isn't likely that humans will be able to
shave off even a few orders of magnitude in the time it took
evolutionary, learning, and social processes to create something as
complex as the mind).

We have no better understanding of how the brain works than we do of
how the AIDS virus works. Yes, we can look at the minutiae of the
chemical processes going on. THis is totally uninteresting, however,
because the important interactions are happening at a systemic level.

The interesting thing about biological systems are the emergent
properties that arise out of billions and billions of interconnected
units and interactions. THis goes completely beyond logic.

We can't even predict the weather, turbulence etc from the emergent
properties of billions of interacting molecules, let alone predict how
a brain functions from the interactions of billions of neurons. There
is little hope for rational science trying to be able to build a brain
until we can conquer infinite complexity and master time and evolution
control. At that point, we have become god, and it won't matter anyways.

(PS: I'm an atheist/Jew, so don't take "god" literally, please).

>The virtual part comes into play because we don't have 
>computer chips imbedded in us yet; but with our daily use of these

Actually, there have been neural interfaces created to the optic nerves
allowing blind people to see a very low-resolution (32*32 pixels, i
think) version of the world around them. Likewise, digital auditory
interfaces have been build allowing some deaf people to "hear" (of
course, since these people haven't learned to hear, it's just another
sensation, like someone stimulating a new nerve).

All this neural prosthetic work has nothing to do with science of mind
or intelligence. There certainly has been progress in neurophysiology
-- enough to know what connects to what, but not enough to know how the
whole system works. 

Scientists have the dreams and the hubris to think they can conquer the
mind. A few good years of bashing their heads against the walls of
reality usually takes care of the hubris part and leaves you with a
nice headache too. 

I'm not trying to dissuade you from your dreams/pursuits. Just don't
expect to see much progress on this in our lifetime, or our children's
lifefimes, or... Although it stimulates our flights of fancy, 
we shouldn't get carried away confusing science with science fiction.

That sucked big time.  I tried to fill up my bottle in the restroom sink

someone's swimming pool.   Sorry Greg for the H-2-Cl-O that was truly

	Then don't. I believe I left it up to the indiviual to decide. I 
see that you don't view yourself that way. However I do. Guess what; were 
both right.

	I agree, but society has chosen techology. I'm just guessing mind 
you, but I'll wager that 70% of our GNP is for techology bases items. And 
that less than 3% is for improving the human condition.

	Did I mention god; I don't think so. To clarify what I wrote, I 
wasn't "alluding god-like capabilities." Your interputation was wrong. 
Your message has a very angry feel to it; bad day at the office Niel? 
Personally I think things like the internet will eventually put an end 
to fear politics by getting people all over talking to each other. In 
other word big goverment would be able to lie to us anymore; the same for 
fear religion. You know Niel; there's the half full glass and the half 
empty glass; but somehow I think you'll manage to spill it either way. In 
the Foundation my Asimov; the scientis and the engineers were the priests 
of the community. I see a great divide between the 3rd world and our 
techology; and it grows expotentially everyday. The faster the techology 
grows the more it will seem like the magic or religion to a nomad in the 
desert.

	Yeah its called clear communication; we have that ability now 
without computers but chose not to use it; because it takes effort.
There nothing cybernectic about bee's now there's a useless and false 
analogy. We were talking about the internet and computers. I don't no 
about you but I don;t want to be a bee or an ant. Humans who have tried 
community based societies have failed; look at communism. I enjoy my privacy.

	I agree(above). Except with the part about it doesn't change us. 
It does because it brings us closer together; or farther apartin our 
case. No it doesn't change us as a race of beings; not on an evolutionary 
scale; then again; you can't measure that; our reference is too short. 
What I was saing is that it has the potential; and that as a society we 
have chosen that path.

	I disagree; nerve's are basically wave guides. "A reflex arc 
consists of a receptor, a sensory neuron, a center in the CNS, a motor 
neuron, and a effector organ, and maybe defined as the shortest route of 
an impulse between receptor and effector. Receptors are basically 
transducers that take information from either internal or external 
sources and create neural impulses." By defination a impulse is a 
momentarty signal; much like a sqaure wave. When an impulse is triggered 
from whatever source, it sends a wave of negativeity down the nerve; much 
like negative logic. The number of impulses determines the magitude, 
level of control(fine to gross) ..ETC. Check your A&P Niel; I just quoted 
you verbatum out of my book; which is less than a year old.

	Most people whether computer literiate or not, do not understand 
the various working or types of computer logic chips. This is an area for 
engineers. soildstate chemist & chip designers only. If I got techinical 
only people with those qualifications would have understood what I was 
writing;and I was tring to reach a bigger range of readers. This wasn't 
meant to 100% techinically correct; these were :profound thoughts". Niel 
is poety techinically correct, is love techinically correct. I bet you do 
it with precision. Just a suggestion Niel try reading some poety 
sometime. God what a pin head. I'm surpised you didn't correct my 
spelling and grammar.

	Again Niel so we shouldn't try as a society; I again disagree. I 
feel that it will happen much sooner than that. All it takes is one 
person with one good idea. Thats what they sadi about landing on the moon.

	You can treat the human body like a black box to some extent; but 
to fully understand it you must explore thinks like DNA and the chemical 
celluar intelligence; that is present. We are cells; we are made up of 
trillions of little tiny microscopic organisms; Each with a purpose and a 
task. You are your cells.

	Niel again so we shouldn't try(sigh). These aren't my dreams or

Hey brian; you really shouldn't take Niels` criticisms so personally.
I don't think his sense of sarcasm was intended to hurt your feelings.
Both of you made some good and interesting points, but if you're going 
to post long philisophical musings to sfraves without any attempt to 
relate it to raving - you gotta expect to take a little heat.

This is partially what sickens me about this whole
Cyberpunk thing, because it is teaching whole generations to become
totally fascinated by machines/death/technology, at the expense of
what is really important -- being/life/biology. I see this as  the
worship of "false idols" (or cargo-cultism) and it is antithetical to
my world-view. (Don't get me wrong I'm as "cyber" as the next computer
geek, but it's just my job/hobby, not a god.)
-------------------

Thank you Mr. Mayer, I was getting that sickening feeling myself... not
that I mind fascination with technology, but I must agree about the
false gods.  Also, if I hear one more person saying they can't wait
until they get microchips planted in their brains/bodies, I might NOT
advice them against their foolishness.  Since raving is supposedly (and
largely I agree that it is) about life, affirmation and celebrating the
human being, I must agree with Niels' concerns.  We don't grow by allowing
ourselves to be subjugated by our own technology, we grow only when we
keep things like this in perspective, realizing that it is us that is
most important; it is us that we should have respect for, be fascinated
by, pay homage to, and most of all, it is us that we should keep as our
most important priority.  No life form, and especially no human life form
should ever, and I mean EVER be seen as less important than some random
technological entity, no matter how "wild", "high-tech" or completely and
utterly "profound".  Our world is full of pain and suffering because our
priorities are completely fucked up, allowing us to devalue the human
being.  So many things are seen as "more important" than some human; this
is simply not true.  In fact, there isn't much that is as important as
the LEAST important among us (i.e. the least important person, as if such
a concept even had any validity to begin with), but until this is clearly
understood, we run the risk of annihilation.  This is, of course, only my
opinion, however, I would like anyone interested to give this some thought
and respond if you like...

I don't think Brian was talking about subjugation.  Raving is also
about transcending our limits, letting go, and going beyond our
origins.  I don't find worshipping the biological scum from which we've 
evolved any more noble than being enamored with the less organic 
aspects of the universe that we as living beings have been getting 
closer to.  Personally, I am more put off by people who are soley
driven (subjugated) by their biological urges than by people who aspire 
to a different set of ideals.  I'm sure, jack, that even you wouldn't 
claim to subscribe to the *Dogs' Philosphy of Life*.

It is a simple fact that ravers already have been enhancing themselves
with technology, and not everyone limits their definition of "life"
to exclude "inanimate" materials.

hmmm... some good points... I'm as interested in technology as anyone,
as long as we the humans remain prime in importance, at least WRT the
respect and care that we show for each other and the world around us,
then I heavily advocate frobulating with technology to your heart's
desire - hell, I'm waist-deep in objects right now!

I'm not familiar with the "*Dogs' Philosphy of Life*" reference you
mentioned, Lee, what is it?  I do admit to being a "dog", ("I've been
a dog since I was oh so young..."), but I suspect that you're referring
to something more heinous than hormones...

i frobulate with dogs all the time

while I wouldn't recommend pentium implants
for just anybody - i do enjoy a little enthusiasm

seems premature to be worrying about a lost generation
of gloomy cyberpunks - isn't it nice to Go there and come back?
a bit of experience, perspective, fun and so maybe a few
will fall in and never return to the well rounded
earth/people loving folks we mostly seem to be
such is life

it is my understanding that if you include electromagnetic
fields in a semi-analytical treatment of black holes there is
the possibility of a surface of infinite energy 
inside the event horizon

i think the relevance to raves here is obvious

my friend, Gabe, has declared January 1995 to be boring.
he wants to see the family again.  i do to, but i also want
to go snowboarding sometime soon.  my point, of course, is what
we Desperately Need is a party in a Park on a Sunday afternoon
(Saturday would be ok).  I'm lookin outside this fine morning
and it is Beautiful ... 

Surely I'm not alone in wanting to dance under the fluffy clouds 
of a lovely February afternoon !!??

Now, don't go telling *me* to organize it.  I am way too much
of a flake to undertake such a resposibility.  I cherish my role
as happy party attendee.

I'll wax eloquently of last summer ... aaahhh, listening to KDIA
broadcast the Evergreen Baptist services on my little AM radio as
I tooled thru Berkeley enroute to Sunset.  Spiritual in a way
that is hard to describe.  Always dressed in my Sunday finest.
I Know The Power of Gods Love, Mans Love, Your Love
Feel the Love with ME ...  FEEL IT !!!
Amen, Brother Dave

In my mind, two groups could pull this off - Pacific or F&F
Do It
For the Love
For the Peace
To Celebrate this Good Year
Together

I myself am owned by such a techno doggie, and I must 
say that your Dog's Philosophy of Life is a little 
one (well, three) dimensional. After all, there's also:

sniff it, chew it, jump on it, lick it, submit to it, 
dominate it, chase it, knock it over, cock your head 
and listen to it, growl at it, bark at it, run with it, 
play keep away, disobey it, sleep on it, and last, but in 
my techno dog's case, not least:

dig it!

Ursula, the techno dog that owns me, is microchipped! So I guess 
"scan it" might also qualify ;) 

Ob Rave: Last thursday I went to Velvet Shop, Spun played a 
very moving set. Is it Garth this week? 

Take care-

jocelyn

p.s. as Ursula is female and has never gone into estrus, she isn't 
particularly interested in fucking, nor does she mark her 
territory- down with doggie gender stereotypes !)

ok, i relinquish
i couldn't take the sunshine and fresh air
streaming through my window anymore

umm, yeah boss, i have to, uh, go do some paperwork
in Building 519 ... and I bolted for my car

farms in little valleys with lots of Green grass
wooden fences, old style phone lines, the road is 
a single common lane

Jackpot - 

I found a field with all these Sheep, Cows, and Horses.
I parked on the side of the road, popped in the sweetest
happiest house tape I could find, and started chasing the
Sheep around the pasture.  I'm sure the Sheep appreciated 
this.  Ya know, there's way more than just farm animals in 
this field.  There's alot of Mud.  I'm sure my new sneakers
appreciated this.

Naturally, my frenzied romp in the pasture is noticed by the
owner of the farm who drove up in his truck.  So I get to meet
a farmer.  His name is Junior and apparently he had a fine serving
of pork chops for lunch.  One of his two dogs is also named Junior.
Junior and I discuss the merits of Old Country vs New Country and
we agree that Charlie Pride rules ...

 Does anyone know about any events , regular or special , that focuses more
on un-dance experimental/ambient industrial/trance music/noise in the
SF Bay area? I'd be interested in attending same . 
 Maybe I should ask ba.music ? Which artists and groups should I keep an eye

Dear Sfraves;

	Right wrong accurate or inaccurate; I will say one thing about 
myself; I'm definately a catalist for thought provoking conversation. 
Eat your heart out and Rush, Howard and Obrap. I have never seen so much 
mail about anyone topic. A topic I never expected to get a reply on that 
was fiction and meant for entertainment only. A good friend of mine said 
take what you find on boards with a grain of salt. A lesson I think we 
all could learn from.

the new moon went off really well, having the perfect vibe, in my mind.
it was all pretty chaotic.  people seemed to be having a really great
time, especially in the cavehouse.  gaven, wade, ronan played in there
and then phred in the morning.  the perfect ambient experience.  people
would get up and dance a little bit and then melt back into the puddle,
so to speak.  there was a fireplace and john kept burning cedar, which
smelled good.

oh yes, tracy did an incredible set. when it was over, everyone started
yelling:  tracy rules!  tracy rules!  one girl saw philip changing the
tape in his dat and wouldn't let up:  you have to give me a tape of this,
ill pay anything, ill give you money RIGHT NOW, you WILL send me a tape
of this...etc.  there were also these women dancing kind of in a circle
in front of the decks and they looked almost supernatural, they were
loving it so much.

er, then there was a noise complaint and chaos consensus decided to switch
to ambient...and the switch was HARD and can only be compared to an
emotional trainwreck.  much whining and complaining ensued and well, okay,
we can have some more beats if we just keep it down, or something.

not much later galen played, and then cyril, who does this fast trancy
stuff.  both were really great, i thought.  in the morning pollywog showed
up and played and then erik, who has this enormous afro and is french.  his
stuff was INCREDIBLE.  by then it was time to go and so i didn't hear anything
else.  it looked like ronan, cyril, erik and another guy were kind of 
trading off and stuff...

this one happened because alot of people came together and helped out:
john glevis gave the space..it was his house, mark and tracy and sarah
brought turntables and a mixer (check out the ew system at ameba and
ask what the plan is for it), philip and phred DAT'd, gavin, tracy, 
wade hampton, phred, cyril, galen, ronan, erik, pollywog played, ronan
brought his system and was there from the beginning and kept things 
together, pacific donated their system, mona planned the whole thing &
dreamed up the new moon in the first place.  

whew, what a night.  and at last i finally know who is the purple tiger!

love,

ann/thrax


ps i guess everybody's seen XLR8R with robbie hardkiss wearing a saucy
little number on the cover?  check out the hardkiss interveiw inside
where they talk about the "distance" between dj's and the people who
"love house music.." i gues that's the "fans" who don't buy the rekkids.
anyway, i thought they said some interesting things....

1984 Old Oakland rd. in the San Jose quadrant sounds good to me.
