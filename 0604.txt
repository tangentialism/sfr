Happy birthday Apple 




Apple Computer is 30 years-old today

<http://www.apple.com/>Apple celebrates its 30th birthday today. 

The company was founded on 1 April 1976 by <http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html>Steve Jobs, <http://www.woz.org/>Steve Wozniak and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne>Ronald Wayne and originally operated out of Jobs's garage.

Apple's first offering was the Apple I personal computer, which sold for $666.66 and was showed off at the now-famous Homebrew Computing Club.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves."
-Edward R. Murrow

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

"Venus: Goddess of Love"

>From the crystal blue depths
of sun splashed ocean waves,
a vision of purest beauty emerges,
her birth heralded by the excited voices of sea gulls.
The Goddess Venus,
poised upon an ivory seashell
and borne upon the winds,
brings us love, beauty, sensuality & desire.
Her gifts compel us to fulfill our creative
& procreative needs.
She invokes enchantment, magnetic beauty,
& sexual awareness.

>From the Blue Depths of the Deep
You were born of the challenges, we are bound to keep
Great Mother of love and lust and delight
Who teachs us how to love and live right
Rest quietly sweet Mother
>From your labors of bringing the light
While the passions sing
Of the storm of joy you bring
Lighting up the lovers night

BIO

Thomas began DJing as a teenager in the eighties along-side friend and
collaborator DJ Harvey at 'Tonka Hi-FI'.

In '91 he moved to California and helped to form the 'Wicked Crew'  
which helped to define the West Coast club sound; a powerfull influence on  
America's club scene for years to come.

In '96 he relocated to New York and formed 'A.R.E. Weapons': a  
Science-Fiction Punk Rock band that ushered in the Electro Clash movement.

After being 'discovered' by Jarvis Cocker they signed to Rough Trade  
Records in London and cut chart hits and an album. Unable to keep still in the scene he  
helped create, he returned to NY and to DJing and formed 'Rub n Tug' with partner Eric D. The  
Rub n Tug parties and it's off-shoot Campfire are now somewhat legendary around the world. Under  
this handle the boys have done remixes for such heavy-hitters as The Beastie Boys,  
Coldplay and Roxy Music as well as more underground acts as !!! and LCD Soundsystem. Rub n Tug have  
brought something new back to disco; as I-D Magazine put it : ' In there hands the disco  
ball has regained consciousness . . . '.

As well as all this, Thomas has started a label in New York called  'Whatever We Want Records' with
partner Carlos Arias, a band with DJ Harvey called 'Map Of Africa'  that has an LP coming out in July
and a Electronic Rockabilly outfit with San Francisco party darling  Rene Peraz called 'Bobbie Marie'.
He also may or may not be responsible for the 'Otter Man Empire' re- edit series.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

So, after what was yet another fairly crap week, I managed to have a =
pretty decent weekend.=20

HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE thanks to Adrianna for taking me to the Stanton Warriors =
at 1015 Friday night. Hands down one of the most fun events I've been to =
in a while. There was a nice diverse crowd, people were friendly, the =
music was poppin' for the most part. Stanton Warriors were simply off =
the freakin' chain - so much energy and vibe in that set, it was =
awesome. There was also some girl named Laura spinning hip-hop =
and....BALTIMORE CLUB in the front room!!! I about peed myself when I =
heard the familiar and very specific beats that are present in most =
Bmore club, and I saw the crowd just going off to it. Now that I know =
that San Fran can get down to the Bmore sound, I'll be figuring a way to =
get my boy Jesse Tittsworth out here to drop it like only a true Bmore =
club dj/producer can do it.

Saturday night...I reallllly wanted to go to the Evil Breaks thing, but =
no $$ and no ride =3D no Evil Breaks. So, since I was guestlisted for =
Collective 4.0, and I could get a ride, that's where I ended up. Oasis =
is the venue that it was held at in Oakland, and despite the run down =
front room, the back porch/room in was going off, and has MAD potential =
for a poppin' East Bay party. Highlights of the night were Jim Hopkins & =
Angel Alanis. I have never actually seen Jim perform before, and it's =
been YEARS since I've seen Angel Alanis. Both were realllllllly fun, and =
mixed up styles quite a bit. You could totally see the old school mixing =
style in all it's glory. BIG BUG UPS to Otherworld & the Collective crew =
for a nice lowkey Saturday night. Looks like this is gonna wind up being =
a monthly deal, so keep your eyes peeled for more info on that!

To everyone I saw out and about - thanks for being part of a much needed =
fun weekend!!!

Whisper is a kewl freakin place.. mellow security, great vibe, real 
warehouse space.. just brings ya back to Breakfast of Champions every time I 
go.  I was pretty impressed with Chris Carter's set.. nice guy too.. but 
what a playa.. every time I went to say hi there was another hottie just 
hangin on em.. some guys get it all.  Then there was Kid Kenobe, that boy 
could do no wrong.  His set was was so slammin, I saw three girls speaker 
humpin on the same stack.. oh lucky stack!  But we should all pay homage at 
least once or twice a year to the Space Cowboys.. few crews on the scene 
roll the way they do: in a UniMog with 10,000 watts of portable 4-wheel 
drive playa dust kicken sound!  Kapt'n Kirk, Mancub, Ernie Travino, Brad 
Robinson, Murpstar & 8-Ball are just a few of the peeps I am fortunate to 
have as friends.

I hope to see everyone at Shine in Two weeks for what is destined to be one 
of the best breaks parties of the year!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] STANTIN WARRIORS & KLUTE 

Now this was an amazing night of music.  I have never heard a better Lorin 
set (in my limited Lorin experience) than the one he put down Friday night.  
Amazing shit.. only to be followed by Stantin Warriors.. Hello.. I still 
think that the UK has a hot angle on so many new flavs of breaks these 
days.. mixing in some hip-hop and litt R&B and then back into tribal.. it 
was all over the place.. and each track more hard hittin than the last.  
Then upstairs for Klute.. I love D&B and Jungle but rarely are they in the 
same place as the breaks I go to hear.. so when you get a chance to hear the 
top DJ's in their game, and tboth genres are at the same place.. well had I 
known that before I went.. I would have never questioned.  Klute was 
amazing.. I was so lost just standing there with everyone else going wtf?  
people were so blown away by that set, kewl as f&*K!

I still like to bag on 1015.. but thanks to Lorin, who brought the crowd.. 
omg what beautiful people they are.. I felt like I was back on the playa and 
was inspired again to make more outfits for clubbin in SF - playa style!  
See ya in my new fur soon!

for those that know anything about breaks, you know that the Stanton
Warriors have been at the top of their game for years.

really, really fucking good production.  i have probably played more
stanton warriors tracks and remixes than any other group or producer.
their stuff always works the dancefloor.

their Stanton Session mix cd was in my car cd deck for months.
literally.  months.  i couldn't stop listening to it.

check out their myspace:

click on the mini mix.  hot shit!

Sounds good! I ended up singing Karioki (sp?) with family on Friday and
found out I don't sing as bad as I thought I did.  Saturday hit up the loca=

SJ Studio 8 club, which is a typical SJ type club (which means shitty). The=
n
left there and went to a place called the temple, which was packed again
with the typical SJ club crowd. Danced to a to a ton of pop/top40 and hip
hop. Got drunk, threw up tons of times, ended up at my cousins house who
lives downtown and found out that someone had cut the back of my brand new
birthday slacks and tried stealing my wallet (which luckily they didn't
get). Also my cousin got her jacket stolen and we almost got into a fight
with some fobby clicky bitches that thought they were the shit cause they
have LV bags. Fuckin San Jose.

Anyway, good times, good times.

  The strange case of the man who took 40,000 ecstasy pills in nine years 

· Usage increased to 25 tablets a day at peak
· Memory problems and paranoia may be lasting 

David McCandless
Tuesday April 4, 2006
The Guardian 

  Doctors from London University have revealed details of what they believe is the largest amount of ecstasy ever consumed by a single person. Consultants from the addiction centre at St George's Medical School, London, have published a case report of a British man estimated to have taken around 40,000 pills of MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy, over nine years. The heaviest previous lifetime intake on record is 2,000 pills.   Though the man, who is now 37, stopped taking the drug seven years ago, he still suffers from severe physical and mental health side-effects, including extreme memory problems, paranoia, hallucinations and depression. He also suffers from painful muscle rigidity around his neck and jaw which often prevents him from opening his mouth. The doctors believe many of these symptoms may be permanent.   The man, known as Mr A in the report in the scientific journal Psychosomatics, started using ecstasy at 21. For the first two years his use was an
 average of five pills per weekend. Gradually this escalated until he was taking around three and a half pills a day. At the peak, the man was taking an estimated 25 pills every day for four years. After several severe collapses at parties, Mr A decided to stop taking ecstasy. For several months, he still felt he was under the influence of the drug, despite being bedridden.   Hallucinations   His condition deteriorated and he began to experience recurrent tunnel vision and other problems including hallucinations, paranoia and muscle rigidity. "He came to us after deciding that he couldn't go on any more," said Dr Christos Kouimtsidis, the consultant psychiatrist at St George's Medical School in Tooting who treated him for five months. "He was having trouble functioning in everyday life."   The doctors discovered that the man was suffering from severe short-term memory problems of a type usually only seen in lifetime alcoholics. But evaluating the full extent of his
 condition was difficult as his concentration and attention was so impaired he was unable to follow the simple tasks involved in the test.   "This was an exceptional case. His long- term memory was fine but he could not remember day to day things - the time, the day, what was in his supermarket trolley," said Dr Kouimtsidis. "More worryingly, he did not seem aware himself that he had these memory problems."   With no mental illness in his family and no prior psychiatric history, the doctors concluded that his unique condition was direct result of his intense ecstasy use.   "This is obviously an extreme case so we should not blow any observations out of proportion," says Dr Kouimtsidis. "But if this is what is happening to very heavy users, it might be an indication that daily use of ecstasy over a long period of time can lead to irreversible memory problems and other cognitive deficits."   For 10 years, MDMA has been suspected of causing these kinds of effects in heavy
 users. It is thought to be due to its disruption of the regulation of serotonin, a brain chemical believed to play a role in mood and memory. It remains unclear whether these effects are the result of permanent neurotoxic damage or just temporary reversible alterations in the brain.   A study today in a special MDMA issue of the British Journal of Psychopharmacology, suggests long-term side-effects may be temporary. The researchers from the University Of Louisiana could find no significant relationship between depression and recreational ecstasy use.   In the case of Mr A, a structural MRI brain scan failed to show any obvious damage or atrophy in his brain. However, these results, says Dr Kouimtsidis, are difficult to interpret. "A scan of this type is not sensitive enough," he said.   Such limitations in brain scanning technology, along with ethical and legal barriers to giving MDMA to human test subjects, have limited direct observation of the drug's effects in humans. 
  Instead, scientists have had to use recreational drug users as subjects in their studies. Conclusions from this are often flawed because few, if any, drugs users use ecstasy in isolation.   Cannabis user   Mr A was also a heavy cannabis user, and when he was encouraged to decrease his use, his paranoia and hallucinations disappeared and his anxiety abated. But his memory and concentration problems remained, leading the doctors to suspect that these may be permanent disabilities.   When he was admitted to a specialist brain injury unit and put on anti-psychotic medication, he did start to show some improvement. "Unfortunately, he discharged himself before we were able to complete the assessment," says Dr Kouimtsidis. "We continued to support him. But he started to use cannabis again and he dropped out. We tried to re-engage him but we lost him about a year ago."   The Guardian made several attempts to find the man without success.   Effects of ecstasy   MDMA is one the
 most intensely studied recreational drugs in history. But despite thousands of research papers and studies, scientific evidence on the side-effects remains inconclusive.   Death by overdose   Undoubtedly, large amounts of ecstasy can lead to over-heating which in turn, in rare cases, can trigger fatal heat stroke. Many factors contribute: number and strength of pills taken, environment, alcohol-consumption, body weight - but women seem more at risk. The bulk of ecstasy-related deaths around the world have been young women.   Water-poisoning   Panicking users, fearing they are overdosing, drink too much water and provoke hyponaetraemia (water-poisoning). Leah Betts died after drinking 14 pints in just 90 minutes. The recommended amount of water to drink per hour is one pint.   Toxic reactions   Much of the reports of toxic reactions are muddled with overdose or water-poisoning deaths. There is no clear evidence that some people suffer allergic reactions to ecstasy. However,
 around 10% of Western users do lack a key liver enzyme CYP2D6 needed to break down MDMA. This may make them more sensitive to the effects and more prone to accidental overdose.   Depression   Many weekend users report a mid-week mood dip. This is suspected to be related MDMA's effect on serotonin, but hard evidence is lacking. In heavy users, dips can turn to crashes and depression. However studies suggest this effect reverses after a 2-3 month abstinence.   Positive effects   Users still claim "long lasting improvements in self-awareness, self-esteem, openness and insight into personal problems", reports the study from the University Of Louisiana. In the US, research continues into the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

The fatal metaphor of progress, which means leaving things behind us,  
has utterly obscured the real idea of growth, which means leaving  
things inside us.

Monument, a tribute to WICKED - 9pm tonite on noisefromthevoid.com


Date & Time:
Tuesday, April 4, 2006
9:00 PM
Hello friends..

There will be no guest on noisefromthevoid this week..

Instead - as it's almost exactly 15 years since the first ever WICKED  
party - I will be presenting the first couple of hours of the show as  
a monument to it's memory. I'll be spinning a few classic Wicked  
tracks interspersed with some personal reflections, thoughts,  
feelings, maybe a story or two, and finally a look into the future.  
The second part of the show will be a more regular noisefromthevoid  
mix of old and new musical treats and suprises - from cosmic disco to  
punk rock fun..

9pm - very late. Tune in early to catch the Wickedness..

go to 90hz.org to LISTEN and CHAT..

toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and

pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."

martin obrien threw a nye party in the early 90's at the marine world fairgrounds. 20,000+ i think. that was a good space for a big party. casper/sharon threw a halloween party in the produce area of the city a while back in 91 or 92, that was  a good spae as well. i guess that doesn't help though does it =)

Subject: [sfraves] Feat. Artist of the Month: DJ Brian - Moontribe

Hey everybody just thought I would pass on to you that on 
www.movementnow.com
we have started a new page (A featured artist page!) to help keep things 
fresh and showcase
people from around the country who are helping make things happen. We will 
be updating
it every month with a new artist, along with their bio and a tasty mix set. 
Yes that's right
more free music! I think we all know that we can't have enough of that.

So without further ado our first featured artist:

..::April::..
<<DJ Brian>>
aka Brian Seed (Moontribe, Ritual Sounds, Ball of Wax)

www.moontribe.org
www.ritualsounds.com
www.ballofwax.com

This month's artist is someone very special to all of us outdoor partiers. 
He's been
trailblazing new sounds from his amazing mix's on Moonshine's "Hard Desert 
Trance"
series in the late 90's, to his completely unbelievable live sets at events 
like Moontribe. Lately
he's immersed himself in the studio working with the likes of John Kelley, 
Amani vs. Teapot and
our very own Phokus on his label Ritual Sounds. It was our pleasure to 
showcase this
wonderful DJ at Nowloween and we are glad to be in his presence again.

Please check him out @ www.movementnow.com and download or stream his mix.

Also feel free to check out our other artist's and download all of the sets 
in our mixes section.

Thanks for your time and enjoy,

P

I like Mighty...I think they fit up to 500 or so...

Anu & Shine are cooler smaller venues...I guess they are more bars than
venues though...

Those are the 3 places I end up most regularly...sub lounge was cool, but I
believe Saturday was the last night of its existence

Smartbar in Chicago was always a favorite, but I heard they remodeled, and =
I
haven't been since christmas time...

Hardesrtrance 1 is TEH HOTTNESS!!!!  2 Is really fucking good too.  I dont
really recall 3 that much, so it must not have been that great.

I've always loved DJ Brian though, I've never gotten to see him live though=
,
i've always wanted to.  I've seen John Kelley 2 or 3 times, which is 2 or 3
times too many, but i still really enjoy his funkydesertbreaks mixes.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] your favorite venues?

I like Mighty when the sound doesn't suck ass. But the whole liquor in 
plastic cups thing SUCKS ASS, and the drink prices are insane there (for the 
small amount of liquor u get).

Mezzanine can be cool too - the bar sure is better there (shaddap, I do rate 
clubs by bar too - it's a factor!).

Anu is always fun for a tiny spot, and so are the Sublounge and Amnesia.

I'm actually starting to kind of like 1015. It's not nearly as bad as folks 
out here made it to be when I 1st moved here. Sute the body cavity search 
sucks, but I am used to that from living back east so I know the routine and 
can get through it fast. They make STIFF fuckin' drinks there too - so 
despite the somewhat high prices, it's still worth it. More news about 1015 
later ;)

I like Mighty...I think they fit up to 500 or so...

Anu & Shine are cooler smaller venues...I guess they are more bars than
venues though...

Those are the 3 places I end up most regularly...sub lounge was cool, but I
believe Saturday was the last night of its existence

Smartbar in Chicago was always a favorite, but I heard they remodeled, and I
haven't been since christmas time...

Not forgetting that! That's some of what inspired me to spin breaks. But his
sets RARELY have much breaks in them. If anything, it's mainly boring prog &

      Hardesrtrance 1 is TEH HOTTNESS!!!!  2 Is really fucking good too.  I
dont really recall 3 that much, so it must not have been that great.

      I've always loved DJ Brian though, I've never gotten to see him live
though, i've always wanted to.  I've seen John Kelley 2 or 3 times, which is
2 or 3 times too many, but i still really enjoy his funkydesertbreaks mixes.

Well, kinda true.

Find out when they are, and maybe I can take a 3-day weekend and drive
out west and meet ya'll! I can't really put anything in stone right
now because of work.

Oh, I've also got tons of points from holiday inn for hotel rooms from
the last few months of travel, so I could probably get a hotel room
for the night if I wanted to.

Jeno has a poetic soul and it was in full effect last night on his special Wicked 15th anniversary radio show.  And so much excellent music from back in the Garden of Eden days of raving here in the Bay.  Good times;  extraordinary memories.

I'm listening to some of the recorded show now and I hear Jeno's comments on breaks:  "The only people who play breaks now are the burning man crowd....mostly white folks music these days."  LOL

Love,

Count me in.  I can pitch on gas, al-key-hall, etc.  I'm dying to go to

I thought that comment would bring a reaction from you Bam :-)  The Wicked collective played lots of breaks in the early days, especially Garth.  Much respect for them.  Again, one hallmark of music in those days was diversity.  Many genres in a set.  

Love,

Apollo

The server was full the first few times I tried to get on.  When I did get in I was so happy it didn't occur to me to record.  When I realized what I was missing he was about an hour and a half into the show.  I did manage to record about 3 1/2 hours.  I don't know right now if the full program is available anywhere else but I'll check.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] An Evening with Jeno

well, i'll be the first to admit that i would like to see more
diversity in this scene.  and i mean diversity of all kinds.

age, self expression, race, culture, sexuality.

i don't like elitism and as much as Evil Breaks has gained support
from the Burningman community (and we love it!)...i won't ever forget
that i'm a raver and i have friends from all segments of the dance
community.

i guess i'm kinda surprised that Jeno would say that about breaks, but
i do understand why he would.

I can see why he'd say it too, but honestly, I think a lot of house music
has been diluted and infiltrated by suburban  america...

Yeah, suggesting that prisoners do the labor is stupid, and that dude's
comment about the Irish is also stupid, since they moved here LEGALLY and
were turned away if they carried disease. As for the actual ILLEGAL
immigration dealie: It's Illegal and those people are skipping in line, eve=
n
if Bush's cronies make tons of money off cheap labor and Bush wants to keep
the Cocaine flowing, it is wrong. If you were standing in a long line (say =
5
year long line) to get TacoBell and some dude and his children sneak right
in front of you, is it ok for you to allow them to cut, even if they were
starving? What about the people behind you? They may be starving too!

Background:
My mothers family is Mexican and came to the US LEGALLY and although we
speak Spanish, we were quick to learn English and move forward into the
American culture and never let our culture be an excuse to not succeed and
aim for excellence.

Breaks have changed since the late 80s early 90s.  As I recall there was an explosion of breakbeat at the time, along with house and hip hop.  There was more of a "soulful" quality to it all and Jeno's point was that house has maintained that soulfulness.  The musical landscape WAS very different back then.  He was comparing dance music then to dance music now and I might add Jeno followed with a comment that breaks have always been an integral part of dance music.  

In those days, however, one played "dance" music.  All these genres and subgenres now didn't exist.  The only radical division was between the trance ravers and the more downtempo, Wicked-style events.  The gay subculture was just beginning to introduce house in the big clubs.  Queer parties like Uranus did wild combos of punk, house, pop, industrial..anything danceable.  Again, diverse, free-form.

I actually read a recent article over a GNN.tv that has brought some of the
lesser talked about issues surrounding the  illegal immigration debate.
Although I don't believe we should kick out every person that is here
illegally, we do need to come up with a plan to allow our government to
track and regulate who is within our country.


Here's the article from GNN

By Thom Hartmann
Labor is left behind

The corporatist Republicans ("amnesty!") are fighting with the racist
Republicans ("fence!"), and it provides an opportunity for progressives to
step forward with a clear solution to the immigration problem facing
America.

Both the corporatists and the racists are fond of the mantra, "There are
some jobs Americans won't do." It's a lie.

Americans will do virtually any job if they're paid a decent wage. This
isn't about immigration =96 it's about economics. Industry and agriculture
won't collapse without illegal labor, but the middle class is being crushed
by it.

The reason why thirty years ago United Farm Workers' Union (UFW) founder
Caesar Ch=E1vez fought against illegal immigration, and the UFW turned in
illegals during his tenure as president, was because Ch=E1vez, like
progressives since the 1870s, understood the simple reality that labor rise=
s
and falls in price as a function of availability.

As Wikipedia notes: "In 1969, Ch=E1vez and members of the UFW marched throu=
gh
the Imperial and Coachella Valley to the border of Mexico to protest
growers' use of illegal aliens as temporary replacement workers during a
strike. Joining him on the march were both the Reverend Ralph Abernathy and
U.S. Senator Walter Mondale. Ch=E1vez and the UFW would often report suspec=
ted
illegal aliens who served as temporary replacement workers as well as who
refused to unionize to the INS."

Working Americans have always known this simple equation: More workers,
lower wages. Fewer workers, higher wages.

Progressives fought =96 and many lost their lives in the battle =96 to limi=
t the
pool of "labor hours" available to the Robber Barons from the 1870s through
the 1930s and thus created the modern middle class. They limited labor-hour=
s
by pushing for the 50-hour week and the 10-hour day (and then later the
40-hour week and the 8-hour day). They limited labor-hours by pushing for
laws against child labor (which competed with adult labor). They limited
labor-hours by working for passage of the 1935 Wagner Act that provided for
union shops.

And they limited labor-hours by supporting laws that would regulate
immigration into the United States to a small enough flow that it wouldn't
dilute the unionized labor pool. As Wikipedia notes: "The first laws
creating a quota for immigrants were passed in the 1920s, in response to a
sense that the country could no longer absorb large numbers of unskilled
workers, despite pleas by big business that it wanted the new workers."

Do a little math. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says there are 7.6 million
unemployed Americans right now. Another 1.5 million Americans are no longer
counted because they've become "long term" or "discouraged" unemployed
workers. And although various groups have different ways of measuring it,
most agree that at least another five to ten million Americans are either
working part-time when they want to work full-time, or are "underemployed,"
doing jobs below their level of training, education, or experience. That's
between eight and twenty million un- and under-employed Americans, many
unable to find above-poverty-level work.

At the same time, there are between seven and fifteen million working
illegal immigrants diluting our labor pool.

If illegal immigrants could no longer work, unions would flourish, the
minimum wage would rise, and oligarchic nations to our south would have to
confront and fix their corrupt ways.

Between the Reagan years =96 when there were only around one to two million
illegal aliens in our workforce =96 and today, we've gone from about 25
percent of our private workforce being unionized to around seven percent.
Much of this is the direct result =96 as Caesar Ch=E1vez predicted =96 of i=
llegal
immigrants competing directly with unionized and legal labor. Although it's
most obvious in the construction trades over the past 30 years, it's hit al=
l
sectors of our economy.

Democratic Party strategist Ann Lewis just sent out a mass email on behalf
of former Wal-Mart Board of Directors member and now Senator Hillary Rodham
Clinton. In it, Lewis noted that Clinton suggests we should have: "An earne=
d
path to citizenship for those already here working hard, paying taxes,
respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar for becoming a citizen."
Sounds nice. The same day, on his radio program, Rush Limbaugh told a woman
whose husband is an illegal immigrant that she had nothing to worry about
with regard to deportation of him or their children because all he'd have t=
o
do =96 under the new law under consideration =96 is pay a small fine and le=
arn
English.

The current directors of Wal-Mart are smiling.

Meanwhile, the millions of American citizens who came to this nation as
legal immigrants, who waited in line for years, who did the hard work to
become citizens, are feeling insulted, humiliated, and conned.

Shouldn't we be compassionate? Of course.

But there is nothing compassionate about driving down the wages of any
nation's middle class. It's the most cynical, self-serving, greedy, and
sociopathic behavior you'll see from our "conservatives."

There is nothing compassionate about being the national enabler of a
dysfunctional oligarchy like Mexico. An illegal workforce in the U.S.
sending an estimated $17 billion to Mexico every year =96 second only in
national income to that country's oil revenues =96 supports an antidemocrat=
ic,
anti-worker, hyperconservative administration there that gleefully ships ou=
t
of that nation the "troublesome" Mexican citizens =96 those lowest on the
economic food-chain and thus most likely to present "labor unrest" =96 to t=
he
USA. Mexico (and other "sending nations") need not deal with their own
social and economic problems so long as we're willing to solve them for the=
m
=96 at the expense of our middle class. Democracy in Central and South Amer=
ica
be damned =96 there are profits to be made for Wal-Mart!

Similarly, there is nothing compassionate about handing higher profits
(through a larger and thus cheaper work force) to the CEOs of America's
largest corporations and our now-experiencing-record-profits construction
and agriculture industries.

What about caring for people in need? Isn't that the universal
religious/ethical value? Of course.

A few years ago, when my family and I were visiting Europe, one of our
children fell sick. A doctor came to the home of the people we were staying
with, visited our child at 11 pm on a weeknight, left behind a course of
antibiotics, and charged nothing. It was paid for by that nation's universa=
l
health care system. We should offer the same to any human being in need of
medical care =96 a universal human right =96 in the United States.

But if I'd applied to that nation I was visiting for a monthly unemployment
or retirement check, I would have been laughed out of the local government
office. And if I'd been caught working there, I would have been deported
within a week. Caring for people in crisis/need is very different from
giving a job or a monthly welfare check to non-citizens. No nation =96 even
those in Central and South America =96 will do that. And neither should the
United States.

But if illegal immigrants won't pick our produce or bus our tables won't ou=
r
prices go up? (The most recent mass-emailed conservative variation of this
argument, targeting paranoid middle-class Americans says: "Do you want to
pay an extra $10,000 for your next house?") The answer is simple: Yes.

But wages would also go up, and even faster than housing or food prices. An=
d
CEO salaries, and corporate profits, might moderate back to the levels they
were during the "golden age of the American middle class" between the 1940s
and Reagan's declaration of war on the middle class in the 1980s.

We saw exactly this scenario played out in the U.S. fifty years ago, when
unions helped regulate entry into the workforce, 35 percent of American
workers had a union job, and 70 percent of Americans could raise a family o=
n
a single, 40-hour-week paycheck. All working Americans would gladly pay a
bit more for their food if their paychecks were both significantly higher
and more secure. (This would even allow for an increase in the minimum wage
=96 as it did from the 1930s to the 1980s.)

But what about repressive r=E9gimes? Aren't we denying entrance to this
generation's equivalent of the Jews fleeing Germany? This is the most tragi=
c
of all the arguments put forward by conservatives in the hopes compassionat=
e
progressives will bite. Our immigration policies already allow for refugees
=96 and should be expanded. It's an issue that needs more national discussi=
on
and action. But giving a free pass to former Coca-Cola executive Vincente
Fox to send workers to the US =96 and thus avoid having to deal with his ow=
n
corrupt oligarchy =96 and to equate this to the Holocaust is an insult to t=
he
memory of those who died in Hitler's death camps =96 and to those suffering=
 in
places like Darfur under truly repressive regimes. There is no equivalence.

It's frankly astonishing to hear "progressives" reciting
corporatist/racist/conservative talking points, recycled through
"conservative Democratic" politicians trying to pander to the relatively
small percentage of recently-legal (mostly through recent amnesties or
birth) immigrants who are trying to get their relatives into this country b=
y
means of Bush's proposed guest worker program or the many variations thereo=
f
being proposed.

It's equally astonishing to hear the few unions going along with this (in
the sad/desperate hope of picking up new members) turn their backs on Caesa=
r
Ch=E1vez and the traditions and history of America's Progressive and Union
movements by embracing illegal immigration.

Every nation has an obligation to limit immigration to a number that will
not dilute its workforce, but will maintain a stable middle class =96 if it
wants to have a stable democracy. This has nothing to do with race, nationa=
l
origin, or language (visit Switzerland with it's ethnic- and language-dived
areas!), and everything to do with economics.

Without a middle class, any democracy is doomed. And without labor having =
=96
through control of labor availability =96 power in relative balance to
capital/management, no middle class can emerge. America's early labor
leaders did not die to increase the labor pool for the Robber Barons or the
Walton family =96 they died fighting to give control of it to the workers o=
f
their era and in the hopes that we would continue to hold it =96 and infect
other nations with the same idea of democracy and a stable middle class.

The simple way to do this today is to require that all non-refugee
immigrants go through the same process to become American citizens or legal
workers in this country (no amnesties, no "guest workers," no
"legalizations") regardless of how they got here; to confront employers who
hire illegals with draconian financial and criminal penalties; and to affir=
m
that while health care (and the right to provide humanitarian care to all
humans) is an absolute right for all people within our boundaries regardles=
s
of status, a paycheck, education, or subsidy is not.

The Republican (and Democratic) corporatists who want a cheap labor force,
and the Republican (and Democratic) racists who want to build a fence and
punish humanitarian aid workers, are equally corrupt and anti-progressive.
As long as employers are willing and able (without severe penalties) to hir=
e
illegal workers, people will risk life and limb to grab at the America
Dream. When we stop hiring and paying them, most will leave of their own
volition over a few years, and the remaining few who are committed to the
U.S. will obtain citizenship through normal channels.

This is, after all, the middle-class "American Dream." And how much better
this hemisphere would be if Central and South Americans were motivated to
stay in their own nations (because no employer in the U.S. would dare hire
them) and fight there for a Mexican Dream and a Salvadoran Dream and a
Guatemalan Dream (and so on).

This is the historic Progressive vision for all of the Americas=85

Subject: Re: [sfraves] An Evening with Jeno

I know so many people of other races into breakbeats, it kind of (not much, 
but kind of) miffs me that he'd say that.

I guess in comparison to the long standing house community, it IS a bit more 
of a caucasian genre, but the last few years the breaks community has had 
MORE diversity than any other I have experienced (and that applies to more 
than just ethnicity).

well, i'll be the first to admit that i would like to see more
diversity in this scene.  and i mean diversity of all kinds.

age, self expression, race, culture, sexuality.

i don't like elitism and as much as Evil Breaks has gained support
from the Burningman community (and we love it!)...i won't ever forget
that i'm a raver and i have friends from all segments of the dance
community.

i guess i'm kinda surprised that Jeno would say that about breaks, but
i do understand why he would.

I think you've all made valid points, but I have to agree with Apollo's
interpretation that breaks really doesn't have the amount of soul it used
to....  I love me some funky breaks and there's definitely a lack of them i=
n
the past couple of years!  Looking forward to the 14th so I can get my
double dose of funky breaks with Jim Hopkins again
!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] An Evening with Jeno

Jeno - Energy

Look it up.  VERY hard to find mixtape from 1990.  My favorite mixtape of
ALL time.  A perfect representation of what Apollo is talking about and what
I believe Jeno was pointing out.  You don't happen to have this mix do you
Apollo??  If you do, or if anybody else does for that matter...PLEASE upload
it!!!!  

On a side note:  I think it's tough for folks who really weren't around back
then to feel "harshed" by his comments.  And no, I'm not trying to be and
elitist.  And no, early funky..non-breakbeat techno breaks tapes by DJ Dan
do NOT count.  He ripped off the early Wicked sound.


On another side note:  Who here has ever heard of Bills Hard to Find Records
in Texas??  I used to buy a LOT of recs from them...as well as sold quite a
few gems for WAY too much money.  Long story short:  As I did a ton of biz
with them, I got to know all the reps really well [I'm sure you break heads
know of Kelly Reverb] and they all told me that Dan would call in and
blatantly ask for what Garth and Jeno were buying/ playing.  Not cool.  But
I think Dan is an excellent DJ...maybe just not the evolutionist that some
may think..

I think you've all made valid points, but I have to agree with Apollo's
interpretation that breaks really doesn't have the amount of soul it used
to....  I love me some funky breaks and there's definitely a lack of them in
the past couple of years!  Looking forward to the 14th so I can get my
double dose of funky breaks with Jim Hopkins again
!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] An Evening with Jeno

I dunno, I've been partying since the late 80's....but then again, I model 
my genre mixing style after those types of DJ's , rather than the "stick to 
one trick" style most people play. lol

Plenty of funky breaks to be found....

James Brown is Dead!


On a serious tip....  I find myself ordering through vinyldj.com and gemm
when looking for funky breaks nowdays.  Where is this plethora of funky
breaks you speak of being put out in 2006?  I scour high and low on mp3
sites like beatport as well as a number of online stores, finding funky
breaks is a task, then finding something that is quality and that I like is
even harder!

Depends on if you mean "funky breaks that sound just like that old skool =
stuff", or "funky ass breaks PERIOD". lol

Cuz honestly, I don't play TOO much stuff that sounds like recycled '95 =
beats. If I wanna play the old stuff, I'll dig throu my crates and play =
old stuff...

But if it's new and fresh and sleazy and funky...

www.streetwisemusic.co.uk=20

or www.dropshop.com=20

or www.dmswax.com=20

Of course these will have that "jungle on 33"  sound too, it IS popular, =
but if you are a sample digger like me, you can find PLENTY of funked =
out shit. It's all in how patient you are. I listen to HUNDREDS of =
samples when I'm record shopping, so I find a ton of stuff...

  Plenty of funky breaks to be found....

      well, i'll be the first to admit that i would like to see more
      diversity in this scene.  and i mean diversity of all kinds.

      age, self expression, race, culture, sexuality.=20

      i don't like elitism and as much as Evil Breaks has gained support

forget
      that i'm a raver and i have friends from all segments of the dance

      i guess i'm kinda surprised that Jeno would say that about breaks, =

      i do understand why he would.

Depends on if you mean "funky breaks that sound just like that old skool 
stuff", or "funky ass breaks PERIOD". lol

Cuz honestly, I don't play TOO much stuff that sounds like recycled '95 
beats. If I wanna play the old stuff, I'll dig throu my crates and play old 
stuff...

But if it's new and fresh and sleazy and funky...

www.streetwisemusic.co.uk

or www.dropshop.com

or www.dmswax.com

Of course these will have that "jungle on 33"  sound too, it IS popular, but 
if you are a sample digger like me, you can find PLENTY of funked out shit. 
It's all in how patient you are. I listen to HUNDREDS of samples when I'm 
record shopping, so I find a ton of stuff...

  Plenty of funky breaks to be found....

  James Brown is Dead!


  On a serious tip....  I find myself ordering through vinyldj.com and gemm 
when looking for funky breaks nowdays.  Where is this plethora of funky 
breaks you speak of being put out in 2006?  I scour high and low on mp3 
sites like beatport as well as a number of online stores, finding funky 
breaks is a task, then finding something that is quality and that I like is 
even harder!

It was played out about 10 minutes after it came on the scene, but for some 
reason, people around here eat that shit up like ice cream.

    To me, breakbeat is a party rockin' genre - and I tend to *personally* 
play more party rockin' beats. Some of it is slammed out and bangin' - but 
it's still all very funky and danceable. But hey - I'd rather be the one guy 
that sticks with that vibe/style then be swimming in a sea of breakbeat 
clones, all playing the same top ten releases from this week's charts.

    I think you've all made valid points, but I have to agree with Apollo's 
interpretation that breaks really doesn't have the amount of soul it used 
to....  I love me some funky breaks and there's definitely a lack of them in 
the past couple of years!  Looking forward to the 14th so I can get my 
double dose of funky breaks with Jim Hopkins again
    !

      well, i'll be the first to admit that i would like to see more
      diversity in this scene.  and i mean diversity of all kinds.

      age, self expression, race, culture, sexuality.

      i don't like elitism and as much as Evil Breaks has gained support
      from the Burningman community (and we love it!)...i won't ever forget
      that i'm a raver and i have friends from all segments of the dance
      community.

      i guess i'm kinda surprised that Jeno would say that about breaks, but
      i do understand why he would.

Mmm... any specific labels/producers?  You are giving me sites with
thousands of records!  But I have the feeling our interpretations of funky
breaks may differ.....  I'm looking for funky ass stuff like on the Fort
Knox Label.  Len Lewis' Label NuPoodle Breaks was putting out some more
tribally and tech house influenced breaks for a short period... but looks
like they went bust with that sublabel.

AHA!!!!

www.groovedis.com=20

It's FK5's distributor, and you can buy direct (and HELLA cheaper I =
might add). They have a TON of that funky sound....FK5, Allgood Funk =
Alliance, Dr. Rubberfunk, Citrona Records, Ursula 1000, etc.=20

I got like 15 records for under $90 there...just over $100 w/ shipping I =
think.=20

They don't have a ton of smaples, but they do have some, and other sites =
can provide the rest. ( I always keep a few diff. sites open to listen =
to samples when I'm shopping).=20

I highly suggest checking out that site if that's what you're looking =
for...and if you contact their online customer service, ask for Randall =
Van Kirk - he's SUPER helpful!!!

Happy shopping!

the Fort Knox Label.  Len Lewis' Label NuPoodle Breaks was putting out =

    Depends on if you mean "funky breaks that sound just like that old =

    stuff", or "funky ass breaks PERIOD". lol

    Cuz honestly, I don't play TOO much stuff that sounds like recycled =

    beats. If I wanna play the old stuff, I'll dig throu my crates and =

    stuff...

    But if it's new and fresh and sleazy and funky...

    www.streetwisemusic.co.uk

    or www.dropshop.com

    or www.dmswax.com

    Of course these will have that "jungle on 33"  sound too, it IS =
popular, but
    if you are a sample digger like me, you can find PLENTY of funked =
out shit.=20
    It's all in how patient you are. I listen to HUNDREDS of samples =
when I'm
    record shopping, so I find a ton of stuff...

      Plenty of funky breaks to be found....

      James Brown is Dead!=20


      On a serious tip....  I find myself ordering through vinyldj.com =

    when looking for funky breaks nowdays.  Where is this plethora of =

mp3=20
    sites like beatport as well as a number of online stores, finding =

        I think you've all made valid points, but I have to agree with =

          well, i'll be the first to admit that i would like to see more
          diversity in this scene.  and i mean diversity of all kinds.

          age, self expression, race, culture, sexuality.

          i don't like elitism and as much as Evil Breaks has gained =
support=20
          from the Burningman community (and we love it!)...i won't ever =

          that i'm a raver and i have friends from all segments of the =

          i guess i'm kinda surprised that Jeno would say that about =
breaks, but=20
          i do understand why he would.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] An Evening with Jeno

Great commentary - in and out of the breaks scene.  I agree with Jeno.. it 
really is popularized with the BM crowd.. although it is growing for sure.  
Everyoone I know is saturated in breaks and gets tired of it for a short 
time, then they're back on it like white on rice!  I know why.. but I can't 
say.. cuz you have to be out there to feel it.  There is a flavor of breaks 
that can't be corrupted because it is rooted in a very unique experience, 
only played at BM - Dessert Breaks!  There something about competing 30,000 
watt sound systems, and furry party busses let loose on the open playa that 
just grounds you into the freak you are for being there in the first place.  
Bass echoing through your sole and vibrating beneath your feet.. beautiful 
stuff.  People live for that kind of experience.  DJ's produce their playa 
sets all year long, and year over year, and rarely ever play those tracks in 
clubs. The rest of the the breaks community seems to just occupy space and 
time untill they can get back to where it is reborn for yet another year.  
Just my opinion, but there is a reason Jeno said what he did.. and it is 
centered in the BM experience.

AHA!!!!

www.groovedis.com

It's FK5's distributor, and you can buy direct (and HELLA cheaper I might 
add). They have a TON of that funky sound....FK5, Allgood Funk Alliance, Dr. 
Rubberfunk, Citrona Records, Ursula 1000, etc.

I got like 15 records for under $90 there...just over $100 w/ shipping I 
think.

They don't have a ton of smaples, but they do have some, and other sites can 
provide the rest. ( I always keep a few diff. sites open to listen to 
samples when I'm shopping).

I highly suggest checking out that site if that's what you're looking 
for...and if you contact their online customer service, ask for Randall Van 
Kirk - he's SUPER helpful!!!

Happy shopping!

   Mmm... any specific labels/producers?  You are giving me sites with 
thousands of records!  But I have the feeling our interpretations of funky 
breaks may differ.....  I'm looking for funky ass stuff like on the Fort 
Knox Label.  Len Lewis' Label NuPoodle Breaks was putting out some more 
tribally and tech house influenced breaks for a short period... but looks 
like they went bust with that sublabel.

     Depends on if you mean "funky breaks that sound just like that old

     stuff", or "funky ass breaks PERIOD". lol

     Cuz honestly, I don't play TOO much stuff that sounds like recycled '95
     beats. If I wanna play the old stuff, I'll dig throu my crates and play 
old
     stuff...

     But if it's new and fresh and sleazy and funky...

     www.streetwisemusic.co.uk

     or www.dropshop.com

     or www.dmswax.com

     Of course these will have that "jungle on 33"  sound too, it IS 
popular, but
     if you are a sample digger like me, you can find PLENTY of funked out 
shit.
     It's all in how patient you are. I listen to HUNDREDS of samples when 
I'm
     record shopping, so I find a ton of stuff...

       James Brown is Dead!


       On a serious tip....  I find myself ordering through vinyldj.com and 
gemm
     when looking for funky breaks nowdays.  Where is this plethora of funky
     breaks you speak of being put out in 2006?  I scour high and low on mp3
     sites like beatport as well as a number of online stores, finding funky
     breaks is a task, then finding something that is quality and that I

     even harder!

     It was played out about 10 minutes after it came on the scene, but for

         To me, breakbeat is a party rockin' genre - and I tend to 
*personally*
     play more party rockin' beats. Some of it is slammed out and bangin' - 
but
     it's still all very funky and danceable. But hey - I'd rather be the 
one guy
     that sticks with that vibe/style then be swimming in a sea of breakbeat
     clones, all playing the same top ten releases from this week's charts.

         I think you've all made valid points, but I have to agree with 
Apollo's
     interpretation that breaks really doesn't have the amount of soul it 
used
     to....  I love me some funky breaks and there's definitely a lack of 
them in
     the past couple of years!  Looking forward to the 14th so I can get my

           well, i'll be the first to admit that i would like to see more
           diversity in this scene.  and i mean diversity of all kinds.

           age, self expression, race, culture, sexuality.

           i don't like elitism and as much as Evil Breaks has gained 
support
           from the Burningman community (and we love it!)...i won't ever 
forget
           that i'm a raver and i have friends from all segments of the 
dance
           community.

           i guess i'm kinda surprised that Jeno would say that about 
breaks, but
           i do understand why he would.

I heard about this when I heard about the 2nd Orb show in NYC (scheduled 
for this past weekend.  Apparently AFTER the raids.)

Liked the article's comments about shutting down Central Park, the 
subways, etc. though!

 Hi everyone!
Guess what? We get to go out to the desert again in just a couple of weeks!
The April gathering will be Wednesday night (the 12) in to Thursday
afternoon.

Here are the other upcoming full moon gathering dates -- they're both on
weekends and they're both 2-day events:

May FMG: Friday the 12th to Sunday the 14th

June FMG: Friday the 9th to Sunday the 11th

Actually I don't remember although I know the tape.  I have boxes of mixtapes from those days and one of my more immediate projects is to dig through them and pull out the irreplaceable stuff, then import and transfer it all to CDs.  Cassette tape deteriorates over time.  There are even some ancient sets I played at the End Up in there. :-)

So Chris, if I come across Energy or other Jeno tapes I'll let you know.

Love,

Apollo

My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Apologies if this is old news to the list.  I've been deleting email by the truckload lately
(Don't worry, it was nothing you said)   ;-)


anyway, this dude Nate Harrison made a rather studied little documentary on the Amen Break,
sampling, hip hop, breakbeat, jungle, sampling & copyright law.   

It's a fun watch for all you hip-hop intelligentsia types:

Subject: [sfraves] Bush Authorized Leak to Times, Libby Told Grand Jury

I saw this about an hour ago on GNN, now CBS5.com, I wonder if anything wil=
l
become of it...

By JOSH GERSTEIN - Staff Reporter of the New York Sun
April 6, 2006 *updated 9:02 am EDT*

A former White House aide under indictment for obstructing a leak probe, I.
Lewis Libby, testified to a grand jury that he gave information from a
closely-guarded "National Intelligence Estimate" on Iraq to a New York Time=
s
reporter in 2003 with the specific permission of President Bush, according
to a new court filing from the special prosecutor in the case.

The court papers from the prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, do not suggest
that Mr. Bush violated any law or rule. However, the new disclosure could b=
e
awkward for the president because it places him, for the first time,
directly in a chain of events that led to a meeting where prosecutors
contend the identity of a CIA employee, Valerie Plame, was provided to a
reporter.

Mr. Fitzgerald's inquiry initially focused on the alleged leak, which
occurred after a former ambassador who is Ms. Plame's husband, Joseph
Wilson, wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times questioning the accuracy
of statements Mr. Bush made about Iraq's nuclear procurement efforts in
Africa.

No criminal charges have been brought for the leak itself, but Mr. Libby, a
former chief of staff to Vice President Cheney, was indicted in October on
charges that he obstructed the investigation, perjured himself in front of
the grand jury, and lied to FBI agents who interviewed him. Mr. Libby, who
resigned from the White House and pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go on
trial in January 2007.

In a court filing late Wednesday responding to requests from Mr. Libby's
attorneys for government records that might aid his defense, Mr. Fitzgerald
shed new light on Mr. Libby's claims that he was authorized to provide
sensitive information to the Times reporter, Judith Miller, at a meeting on
July 8, 2003.

"Defendant testified that he was specifically authorized in advance of the
meeting to disclose the key judgments of the classified NIE to Miller on
that occasion because it was thought that the NIE was =D4pretty definitive'
against what Ambassador Wilson had said and that the vice president thought
that it was =D4very important' for the key judgments of the NIE to come out=
,"
Mr. Fitzgerald wrote.

Mr. Libby is said to have testified that "at first" he rebuffed Mr. Cheney'=
s
suggestion to release the information because the estimate was classified.
However, according to the vice presidential aide, Mr. Cheney subsequently
said he got permission for the release directly from Mr. Bush. "Defendant
testified that the vice president later advised him that the president had
authorized defendant to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE," the
prosecution filing said.

Mr. Libby told the grand jury that he also sought the advice of the legal
counsel to the vice president, David Addington, who indicated that Mr.
Bush's permission to disclose the estimate "amounted to a declassification
of the document," according to the new court papers.

One of the facts Mr. Libby said he planned to disclose to Ms. Miller was
that the estimate, produced in October 2002, concluded that Iraq was
"vigorously trying to procure uranium." This contention was sharply at odds
with Mr. Wilson's op-ed piece which argued there was no evidence of such a
procurement effort, at least on a trip he took to Africa at the CIA's
request.

Mr. Bush's alleged instruction to release the conclusions of the
intelligence estimate appears to have been squarely within his authority an=
d
Mr. Fitzgerald makes no argument that it was illegal. While Mr. Libby said
he gave that information "exclusively" to the Times reporter at their
breakfast meeting at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington, many of the finding=
s
of the estimate were formally declassified and discussed at a White House
press briefing ten days later, on July 18, 2003.

The court papers filed by Mr. Fitzgerald do not make clear whether Mr. Bush
knew the disclosure was destined for Ms. Miller, though they indicate Mr.
Cheney knew that fact. Mr. Libby is also said to have testified that five
days late Mr. Cheney authorized the release to the press of information
about a cable about Mr. Wilson's strip.

Messrs. Bush and Cheney have been interviewed by Mr. Fitzgerald and his
staff, but it is not known how their accounts of the events compared to tha=
t
of Mr. Libby.

In an interview with Fox News in February, Mr. Cheney, who has a reputation
for secrecy, acknowledged that he has sometimes pressed for the official
release of classified records.

"I've certainly advocated declassification and participated in
declassification decisions," he said.

Asked if he had ever "unilaterally" declassified material, Mr. Cheney
replied, "I don't want to get into that. There is an executive order that
specifies who has classification authority, and obviously focuses first and
foremost on the president, but also includes the vice president."

While prosecutors initially said Mr. Libby was the first government officia=
l
to disclose Ms. Plame's identity, it subsequently emerged that a Washington
Post reporter, Bob Woodward, learned earlier about her CIA employment from
another government official. Neither Mr. Woodward nor Ms. Miller wrote abou=
t
Ms. Plame at the time. Another journalist, Robert Novak, first disclosed th=
e
employment of Mr. Wilson's wife in a syndicated column released on July 14,
2003. The columnist based his story on interviews with Mr. Bush's top
political adviser, Karl Rove, and another official who has not been
officially identified.

Prosecutors argued that Mr. Libby covered up his role in the disclosures
because "he knew the White House had publicly staked its credibility on
there being no White House involvement in the leaking of information about
Ms. Wilson." They also noted that Mr. Bush publicly declared he would fire
anyone found to have leaked classified information.

The new court filing quotes from handwritten suggestions Mr. Libby gave to
the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, urging the spokesman to
proclaim the vice presidential aide's innocence with the same vigor that th=
e
press secretary previously denounced as "ridiculous" suggestions that Mr.
Rove might have had a hand in leaking Ms. Plame's identity.

Mr. Libby's note, as typed up by the prosecution, reads like a stanza of
verse:

"People have made too much of the difference in
How I described Karl and Libby
I've talked to Libby.
I said it was ridiculous about Karl
And it is ridiculous about Libby.
Libby was not the source of the Novak story.
And he did not leak classified information."

Mr. McClellan did not adopt the talking points verbatim, but did tell
reporters later that Messrs. Rove and Libby "assured me that they were not
involved in this."

Mr. Rove has not been charged with a crime, but remains under investigation
by Mr. Fitzgerald's office.

; D
 
Come join us tonight at the @lpha Bar SF. The first beat drops at 9pm, and  
we're going until 2 a.m. This has turned into a FREE weekly event featuring  
breaks, minimal techno, techno, house, downtempo/experimental.

Our guest  djs for the night-

Praxis
(Omniscient / Intellihance  Records)

Atom Weaver
(Omniscient/ Orphan)

+ Rotating  Residents.....
Evinrude, Mdk, Nugz, Dirt, Dru, Your Friend Nate and  G.A.M.M.A.

Drink Specials are: 1$ off well drink, and 2$ off domestic  beers.

Alpha bar is located at 3848 Geary, almost at the corner of 3rd  Ave. 
it's a very relaxing, swanky, comfortable lounge-type club. We hope  
to see you there!

Subject: [sfraves] The Morning Paper



             the morning paper               


It's easy to remember.  Its better to forget.
We're fucked but to recount these days and the hell we ain’t seen yet.

I rise up through the morning fog, try to beat the dawn
The whole world sleeps in cozy beds while I get my own shit on.

If I didn’t have to take these pills, I’d still be home in bed
One-a-these days in the morning paper they’re gonna find me dead.

Well it might be a pissed-off confidence man; it might be my own luck		
Or it might be my decision to just stay where I’ve been stuck


  
I stopped breathing on the day you left and I haven’t dared breathe since
It’s hard to find enlightenment if you don’t know what it is  

I’ll fit better in the morning papers than I ever fit in your head
I felt for you at the break of dawn, found emptiness instead

I sit still with my morning cup,    watch the colors rise
The silence of her ghost in here, the shadow in her eyes

Her cunt is like a flower, I don’t know what it’s for
The less I understand it, the more I want it more.

Subject: [sfraves] Brand New Day


I started this one in 1997,  and just finished.  I think Andy used to be in it, but i lost a lot
of my notes in the fire.   But now it's got a real slowww house beat and orchestral strings.




U – N – D 
   E – R – G         
      R – O –U – N – D 
   
Michael’s got a tank & some 2-CB
Crack it open, baby, to see who we be.

This party’s jumpin off, kickin full throttle
Yo Jackson, pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
The chill room crew took the good champagne 
--- “Summon the butler for more cocaine!”
 
Keyed-up kids gonna have a heart attack
E’d up kids talking disco-smack
---“Boomerang!  Stop talking!”
---“Just slip another fifty in the stripper’s top stocking!”

Get off the wall, before the night’s a loss
Put your ass in the air like a Muslim in a mosque
“A’salaam aleikum,” and “Hum'di’allah”
When Armageddon comes,  baby:   God help us all.


   Guns at our heads, but we won’t be taken
   Sun comes up on a brand new day
   Golden clouds on the eastern horizon
   Sun comes up on a brand new day



Fartin’ around, scarin’ the cat,
Punch the 808.  Roll the DAT
Rollin like that, with your eyes rolled back
Trying to cut tracks on a midnight snack

We  get no rest til we’re back in the box
Black coffee, cigarettes and Jack on the rocks
Don’t be ringin on the phone,  ain’t nobody home
This headphone is a helmet when you’re deep in the zone

  
The musical organization of data cum religion
Program a pattern, kick back and just listen:
Make the sound final,  squash it down to vinyl 
Then Aaron swoop it up and it’s straight to your spinal

The fury of infinity made my senses bloom
First I fought it,  then I found I was finally finely tuned
But nothing we can see will ever satisfy:
Leave your record player spinning on the day you die


   Guns at our heads, but we won’t be taken
   Sun comes up on a brand new day
   Golden clouds on the eastern horizon
   Sun comes up on a brand new day





(c) me.  1997 - 2006

hmmm... i wouldn't be surprised, Eric.  Straight Outta Compton was my second rap tape (Somehow,
"Eazy Duz It" was the first.)

I used to carry "Compton" around with me when I was a valet parker, jamming & ejecting it outta
every Oldsmobile / Reliant K / Cadillac tape deck I parked, hearing the tape in 2 minute snatches.

Until the day I couldn't get the tape out of a Porshce, 'cause the tape spools were so off their
orbits the tape wouldn't eject.

i always wondered what happened when those rich old fucks got their sportscar back to hear "...a
young nigga on the warpath!!!  and when I'm finished, there's gonna be a bloodbath!!!"


Oh yeah, by the way Eric, it's been almost seven years since Oakland's had 10,000 heads under one
roof, gangstas hugging candy kids and fucked up shit like that. 

Do come back.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

Well I had an interesting surprise last night ... I got home, cooked  
myself some dinner, cleaned up, and decided I was going for a walk.   
So I walked and walked and I came upon a local bookstore that's been  
open for about a year.  And on a sign outside the door was written in  
chalk "meet Clay Jenkinson".  Well, I'd be surprised if anyone on the  
list knew who Clay Jenkinson is, but he is well versed in the life of  
Thomas Jefferson and has a radio show called The Thomas Jefferson  
Hour, where he assumes the personna of our nation's second  
President.  I thought, what an interesting coincidence, because I was  
just listening to him on the radio the day before.

So I walked into the bookstore and he was doing a book signing and a  
short speak.  I caught the end of the discussion where he was  
starting to talk about the next personna he wants to assume, and that  
is Theodore Roosevelt.  And he told a great story about the time that  
Theodore was out in North Dakota on a boat, and someone stole his  
boat, he built another boat, caught up with the boat thieves, and  
marched them back to the authorities.

So anyway, now I have a signed copy of Becoming Jefferson's People:   
Re-Inventing the American Republic in the Twenty-first Century.  So I  
dedicate today's quote to one from the book I just bought.

--

Jefferson's unstated motto was that there is nothing magical in the  
way things are.  He believed that he stood at the dawn of a new era  
in which every institution, every habit, every system, every cultural  
code, every belief, and every received truth would be examined  
according to the dictates of reason and good sense, and its capacity  
to promote human dignity and happiness.

- Clay S. Jenkinson

 P.S. love the tape deck story...I think there's another song in there somewhere.

hmmm... i wouldn't be surprised, Eric.  Straight Outta Compton was my second rap tape (Somehow,
"Eazy Duz It" was the first.)

I used to carry "Compton" around with me when I was a valet parker, jamming & ejecting it outta
every Oldsmobile / Reliant K / Cadillac tape deck I parked, hearing the tape in 2 minute snatches.

Until the day I couldn't get the tape out of a Porshce, 'cause the tape spools were so off their
orbits the tape wouldn't eject.

i always wondered what happened when those rich old fucks got their sportscar back to hear "...a
young nigga on the warpath!!!  and when I'm finished, there's gonna be a bloodbath!!!"


Oh yeah, by the way Eric, it's been almost seven years since Oakland's had 10,000 heads under one
roof, gangstas hugging candy kids and fucked up shit like that. 

Do come back.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Saturday, April 08, 2006 * NU-JIVE *

Date & Time:  Saturday, April 8, 2006 - Sunday, April 9, 2006 9:30 PM 
The scunderground presents: Nu-jive This month we have a very special 
guest: Dj Kiyoshi of KHDC! Listeners to the Chemistry show on KHDC 
90.9FM in Salinas, California will better know Will Kiyoshi DeVoe as 
just KiYoshi. Born in Mountain View, California, KiYoshi was raised in 
New Jersey, San Francisco, LA, San Diego and Santa Cruz. He is now a 
resident of Salinas, California. KiYoshi first got interested in being 
a dj when he was 10 years old, but says "I realised I could not 
recognize a single note". He was inspired by the Sugar Hill Gang's 
'Rapper's Delight' and got his break in the late 80's spinning Hip Hop 
and Electro at various parties. In 1985, KiYoshi started getting 
experience with radio whilst working at a record store in Santa Cruz. 
He started guesting on a radio station at a private school and then 
moved onto a college radio station at UCSC called KZSC 88.1FM. His 
break for "Chemistry" came when he was DJing at UCSC and some people 
from the local public station asked him whether he'd be interested in 
playing over the airwaves. His show on KHDC 90.9FM in Salinas, 
California was entitled "Chemistry" due to the fact that KiYoshi plays 
"all the elements past and present" that make up the music he is into. 
It is a non-commercial bi-lingual radio station and they do the work 
"for the love, not the money". People can pick up the station from 
Monterey to Santa Cruz and "Chemistry" airs on Wednesday nights from 
10pm until midnight. KiYoshi specialises in playing imports, 
underground, independent and up & coming artists as he says, "I 
realised at an early age how hard it is for artists/labels that were 
not on the mainstream thing to get heard". He decided to make it a 
focus of the program and plays all genres from House, Drum & Bass, to 
UK Garage, Broken Beat, Electro and more stating "anything with soul". 
It seems that KiYoshi has found a key to success in there somewhere as 
he has a lot of supporters including Tricksta at Wolftown Recordings, 
Kate at Urban Takeover, Adam at Giant Step, Pure Groove and many more. 
KiYoshi is currently producing his own tracks in the coming year. He 
advises up and coming DJs to "do things for the personal enjoyment of 
music" as he certainly does. You can catch his show on KHDC 90.9FM 
between the hours of 10pm and 12am each and every Wednesday. "Nu-jive" 
will be held at the all new Cardiff Lounge, 529 Seabright Ave., Santa 
Cruz, Cali. Second Saturdays of every month starting this Saturday 
night, April 8th, 2006. Continuing on second Saturdays: , May 13th, 
June 10th, ect. Dj ABC (scunderground) and Kiyoshi will spin a frenzy 
of freakified funk on the floor. So get ready for Broken-beats, bossa 
breaks, soulful/funked up housin', and eclectic afro-electronica. Free 
to all those 21+ who have soul. www.myspace.com/dj_abc

sexual health. Volunteers identify as gay, bi, or queer. The drop-in 
clinic accepts new clients, regardless of sexual orientation, on Sunday

Wednesday, August 02, 2006 * BOOM FESTIVAL Magic *

Date & Time:  Wednesday, August 2, 2006 - Wednesday, August 9, 2006 
4:00 AM Heya, All! We would like to share with you information about a 
very special global arts, music and culture-gathering that incarnates 
biannually in Portugal. Boom Festival takes place in a stunning outdoor 
location on the shore of the Lake Idanha-a-Nova, approximately 2 hours 
North-West from Lisboa. Bringing together the latest in psychedelic 
sights & sounds, phantastic art installations & workshops, this 
week-long event is a harmonic convergence of people, energy, 
information, and philosophies, from planet Earth & beyond. Synchronized 
multi-dimensionally with the full moon of August, the next 
Boom-Festival is taking a bio-dynamic approach by incorporating a 
variety of sustainable techniques, and Earth-based forms throughout its 
infrastructure. Reflecting a harmonic balance of the organic and the 
cyber-technologic, Boom 2006 maps the metaphysical framework in 
accordance with Peace, Love, Unity and Respect. A very magical event 
indeed! 5000 BOOM Festival 2006 Early Bird Tickets are available now. 
They are only 70 Euro for 7 days. Getting there is no big deal. 
Reasonable flights to Lisboa can be purchased on most of the European 
Budget Airlines, and Transatlantic flights from America are also quite 
cheap. The Boom has organized busses that take you directly from the 
international airport to the sacred womb of the vacation party 
paradise. This year, Boom-festival has extended its length to ONE WEEK! 
Great news about the timing of BOOM 2006 is that it's not happening in 
conjunction with Burning Man, so the devoted "Burners" have a chance to 
partake on European creative community expression. BOOM is similar to 
Burning Man, but with a lake & great sounds! Not to be missed ... For 
more info, please visit: www.boomfestival.org

When at one of those free places, what is the correct file to download? I was looking at so many different fruity loops one's with all types of extensions, I wasn't sure which one to pick. Most seemed so vague. .exe , .rar , .dll   which one is correct? It seems like getting free software is a chore. if anyone has a clue on this stuff let me know what i should be downloading. I was thiking about just doing everything but i wasn't positive if that would work. it seems like everything was all spread out.
   
  thanks

I challenge eric spire to hit that again.  (Vacation's over, baby!)
 
That was a special moment in history, when the millenium was turning and our collective nuts were
begging to blow for no reason.   There was a certain desperation then, wasn't there?  


I think that desperation carries more meaning now.   Anarchy and deconstruction mean more now than
they did in 99/00...   before PNAC and phantom airplanes and patriotic terror.

woop  woop.  let's fill up 5 dancefloors again (nodding our heads to Otherworld, of course)

What do you want to do? If you already have a synth all you need is a midi
adaptor and sequencer software. My personal favorite is Sonar 5.

Trying out software by downloading it illegally and then buying the stuff
you think is worth it is the way to go. Yeah, it's probably morally
incorrect, but if you have a concious and buy it at some point you are stil=
l
supporting the developer. I just spent $350 on the Spectrasonic's Atmospher=
e
plug-in. This thing is bad ass. Please don't just go download tons of shit
and never pay for it, that's just wrong.

awkward, contrived graphic novel.  

Much more fun than my own life.  Much more exciting with Treavor as the backing track, if you can
find that mix.

If you're just starting out in computer-based electronic music production,
Reason is going to be the most rewarding.  It has a touch and click
interface and good integration with inexpensive MIDI/USB devices like the
M-Audio keyboards. If you want something more advanced, go for the ProTools
MBox (*cough*  *awkward silence as Cochrane misses his cue*).  A lot of
folks seem to be gravitating towards Live 5 these days; some people find th=
e
interface inuitive, others do not.  There's also Logic Pro from Apple to
consider, which has a more "compositional" or "orchestra" feel to it; steep
learning cuve, but very rewarding once you master it.

As for the hardware component, I've had success with the M-Audio USB and
Firewire interfaces; they're inexpensive and sound decent, at least with th=
e
marginal speakers I was using them with at the time.  Speakerwise, Event
makes some nice sounding stuff that's pretty affordable, and if money is no
object, there's always the Mackie HR824.

I agree that there's not one program for everyone; it depends on your
creative process and budget and how you think about music.  Definitely,
check out a number of them, and find which one is right for you.  You don't
even have to break IP "law"; most companies provide demo versions for just
such purposes.

My experience was that the cost of software was neglible compared to the
investment in time and energy required to make something of real quality.
Computer-based music production has made making mediocre music easier, whic=
h
is no small accomplishment, but ultimately, a great musician (*pointed look
@ GC. and MK-S*) can make good music with nearly anything, just like a grea=
t
programmer can write code with nothing but vi.  I think a lot of learning
electronic music is similar in fashion to the method in which the Australia=
n
aboriginal peoples used to teach the didjeridoo; send the student out into
the wilderness with instructions to come back when he has learned how to
play it properly.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

I went to see these guys in concert this weekend in Dirty Jersey.  I  
don't know, btw if that term refers to the entire state or a specific  
city - the actual city was Camden, right across from Philadephia.   
Anyway, they're all very talented and the instruments, the set  
design, and the lyrics were all very simple but effective.  Kind of  
reminds me of house music, though not in a literal sense.  I think  
this band could signal the beginning of a new cultural revolution  
we've really not had in at least 20, perhaps 30 years.  I hope this  
band will be around for a long time just like a lot of the 70's rock  
bands still are.

The Atlantic was born today, and I'll tell you how:
The clouds above opened up and let it out.

I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole.
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean,
Making islands where no island should go.
Oh no.

Most people were overjoyed; they took to their boats.
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat.
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flat lands to your door
Have been silenced forever more.
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before
Oh no.

I need you so much closer [x8]

I need you so much closer [x4]

So come on, come on [x4]

Subject: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

All,
 
 I'm interested in writing a short blog piece about cooperation in the rave communtiy for http://www.cooperationcommons.com, a blog devoted to understanding human cooperation where I am a contributor.  I've written a couple of short pieces already and I am currently finishing up an article on "freeriding" on P2P networks.  
 
 I don't really have a focus yet for this piece on cooperation in the rave community, but I got the idea to write something after reading this blurb on Mithen's new book The Singing Neanderthals (see http://human-nature.com/ep/reviews/ep03375380.html)  Generally I'm intereted in the ways that cooperation has developed unique social forms within the rave community, or in which the music itself is a catalyst for cooperative behavior.  I'm not that interested in various retellings of the toll plaza scene from Groove however.  Well unless they are particularly cool or amusing ;)
 
 I'm reaching out to the list for any ideas, stories, anecdotes, or whatever else you've got related to cooperation in the rave scene.  Your contributions will be duly noted and attributed of course.
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter Rothman

One time this naked guy named Sticky asked me if I wanted anything hard. I
said "Sure" and next thing you know I was sharing a bottle of rum with a
whole group of people and we started talking like pirates and ran around in
circles chanting "yo ho ho HO a pirates life for me.." Too bad no HOs were
there, but I still managed to get a backwards fingercuff. Plurrrrrrrrr.
snore. pluuuuurrrrrr snore. Plurrrrrrr.

Ok, maybe things didn't happen like that, but it's a good dream nonetheless=

After the first sentence, I expected this story to go in a different direction.  Is the cooperation part here where you talked like pirates?  Hmmm.
 
 I see everyone is in a silly mood today.
 
 Awesome!
 
 purr not plur,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

i'm trying to figure out if i have a good story.

how about this.  at my first massive i was in a crowd up front during
the Chemical Brothers.  i was rocking out and having a blast and i
looked over and noticed this really short girl dancing.

i could tell she was trying to see the stage and was having no luck,
but she was still dancing and enjoying herself.

but i felt bad because she was surrounded by people that were a good
6-10 inches taller than her and she couldn't see a damn thing.  so i
introduced myself and asked if she wanted to get on my back so she
could see the Chems.  she jumped on my back and i held her up for a
good 5-10 minutes.  she thanked me and we went our separate ways.

does that count as rave induced cooperation?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

Yes it does!  
 
 One thing that's interesting about this and other rave related stories of cooperation and altruism I've heard is that you had no real reason to help this person.  You didn't benefit, and the odds of seeing her again were small or zero.  But you did held her up so she could see anyway.  This is in contrast to most examples of cooperation in the literature where altruism is at least somewhat influenced by the potential for mutual benefit or future rewards.  See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_Prisoners_Dilemma
 
 What made you think of helping her?  Any idea?
 
 I'm also especially interested in cooperation among promoters and collectives.  Are there similar stories out there in relation to party production?  I hear a lot about hating and people sabotaging other people's events, but I am sure there are also some notable counterexamples where people cooperated to make parties happen when they otherwise wouldn't have happened at all.
 
 Keep the stories coming, I'm not sure yet where this leads...
 
 And thanks again Bam!
 
 Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

i remember thinking "i am having a great time.  i love the chemical
brothers and am super stoked that i am finally seeing them live.  this
girl would probably be having a much better time if she could see the
stage.  i'm having a good time and want to help her have a good time
too."

so i did.  to this day i've never run into her again (that i know of)
and can't even remember her name.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

I don't know if this is going to be any help at all.
But at parties I like to be a sort of karma patrol
person. Like for instance if I see someone who is
inebrated or on the floor, I ask if they are okay,
offer them water etc. If they are rolling I give them
candy, lightshows whatever lol. We all need to take an
active part in the vibe aspects of a party and
contribute to the overall good feel and love that a
party should have.

my .02,

Delia

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

well, that's a good question.  here's my opinion.

there's a lot of negativity in popular culture and i see a lot of  
young people listening to music that has stood the test of time,  
1960's and 70's rock.  pink floyd, led zeppelin, etc.  sure, 80's  
rock is still popular, but it's not epic like the stuff from the 60's  
and 70's.

now i'm not necessarily saying this band will stand that same test of  
time, but it's got potential.  when you dust that cd off 20 years  
from now what will people think?  what will you think?

i think culturally, we need more music that defines the times we live  
in overall.  i just have a feeling we might be headed that way.   
something that will exist side by side with the rave music.

does this help?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Ethan mixes online?


Awwww!  I think that tag team set on his site (live at persistence) was 
his first time playing colloboratively with anybody aside from like joking 
around at house parties.  I threw that party and didn't book myself and he 
insisted I play with him.  Too bad the volume kinda goes up and down as we 
go between my abstract weirdness (most of it domestic "milder" pressings) 
and his nose-bleed volume british pressings, but still a fun little set.

To a decade of knowing a dj in the "might as well step on the gas and 
drive the bus off the cliff cause we're all on fire already" tradition...

It's so nice to see someone thinking about music with a mind for the future=
.

I heard some choral music (Bach, Faure, Byrd) on the radio this
weekend, and it nearly made me weep.  I suddenly realized I need to
listen to more music that speaks across generations, and not just
stuff from the past five years.

Gee... hmm...
 
...maybe this is just crazy talk.. but if it's an SFR 14th anniversary..  
um.. shouldn't there have been some *SFR* involvement in this? Or er.. hmm, I  
dunno... a BSP on here at some point, maybe even before posting it to  tribe?
 
Since a lot of people are choosing to stay quiet on this, I'll play bad  cop, 
mmkay? Because this raises a few questions:
 
1) Why not call it something else since, as far as I can tell,  SFR was 
totally out of the loop on this? 
 
2) An SFR "Benefit"? Sorry, who is this benefiting? Do we get a say in  it?
 
3) Karina, can you explain why specifically you (or whoever) chose to  call 
this an SFR event? How is SFR at all related to this party other than your  
involvement in both and the date of the event being shared with SFR's  
anniversary?
 
Uh.. I don't get it.
 
heart,
Alida

This is the bad cop posting?  You are too nice for the bad cop...
 
 Based on the response so far on Tribe.net (exactly one posting) I'd say some promotion here on the sfraves list itself might be a good plan. 
 
 Hmm, maybe this would be an interesting study of cooperation in the rave scene?  Or not.
 
 I guess we'll see.
 
 Peace,

Gee... hmm...

dunno... a BSP on here at some point, maybe even before posting it to  tribe?
 
Since a lot of people are choosing to stay quiet on this, I'll play bad  cop,

1) Why not call it something else since, as far as I can tell,  SFR was 
totally out of the loop on this? 
 
2) An SFR "Benefit"? Sorry, who is this benefiting? Do we get a say in  it?
 
3) Karina, can you explain why specifically you (or whoever) chose to  call 
this an SFR event? How is SFR at all related to this party other than your  
involvement in both and the date of the event being shared with SFR's  
anniversary?
 
Uh.. I don't get it.

Based on my highly scientifc analysis, you are not the only person tat does this Delia.  I've heard this behavior called being a "rave nurse".  Anyone else ever hear this term?  anyone else find themselves in the rave nurse role?  Any specific interesting stories related to your rave nursing Delia?
 
 Thanks!

I don't know if this is going to be any help at all.
But at parties I like to be a sort of karma patrol
person. Like for instance if I see someone who is
inebrated or on the floor, I ask if they are okay,
offer them water etc. If they are rolling I give them
candy, lightshows whatever lol. We all need to take an
active part in the vibe aspects of a party and
contribute to the overall good feel and love that a
party should have.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

The thing that's interesting about this story is that arguably you don't have any direct benefit from your actions.  This is contrary to the standard "rational actor" model typically considered in economics.  Of course an economist might argue that you benefit through the party being better or the potential of sex or some such thing.  But I think there is more going on here, where people are taking specific actions to improve the party, the scene, the vibe, etc. even though they probably will never be able to know that their efforts were successful and trully don't realize any direct benefit.  I've been delving into an area called behavioral or psychological game theory which purports to address some of these "irrational" sorts of actions by people, but most of that theory seems to be based around models of conflict rather than pure altruism.  
 
 Of course maybe you were really hoping to get a little somethin' somethin'...you tell me. ;)
 
 Peace,
 
 Peter

i remember thinking "i am having a great time.  i love the chemical
brothers and am super stoked that i am finally seeing them live.  this
girl would probably be having a much better time if she could see the
stage.  i'm having a good time and want to help her have a good time
too."

so i did.  to this day i've never run into her again (that i know of)
and can't even remember her name.

You didn't benefit, and the odds of seeing her again were small or zero.  But you did held her up so she could see anyway.  This is in contrast to most examples of cooperation in the literature where altruism is at least somewhat influenced by the potential for mutual benefit or future rewards.

I hear a lot about hating and people sabotaging other people's events, but I am sure there are also some notable counterexamples where people cooperated to make parties happen when they otherwise wouldn't have happened at all.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

I have no specific stories - but I have played "rave daddy" to tons of 
friends and partiers throughout the years. Even when I'm at my most 
inebriated state, I have made sure to always dissuade people from jumping in 
cars when they're all fucked up, or cramming multitudes of drugs in their 
system without regard for consequences. I think that's one of the things 
that has consistantly kept me involved in the scene...that people, sometimes 
total strangers are willing to sit down and talk a person down, hug them, 
get them water, share a drink, share a smoke, and in general - look out for 
each other, regardless of social clique, etc. It's (by and large) a very 
symbiotic social scene.

I def. see 'Lida's point, especially did last year.  I guess there is a distinction/line to be drawn between the "San Francisco Raves List", which Karina could certainly be said to have played an integral part in over the years, and "SFRp", a rave crew that was assembled from people who were (at the time) subscribers and regulars on said list.  Most of SFRp as I know them have largely moved on from raving to new adventures.  I don't know that the majority of them would be too motivated to throw an umpteenth anniversary party at this point.  (I could be wrong, though)
 
 Why isn't Ryan on this list anymore?  We need somebody to interject "FCUKING DUMB SLUT STOP TRYING TO STEAL OUR STREET CRED, BITCH!" right now.

 Chester?  Wanna bring the heat?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] cooperation in the rave community

Here's something a friend of mine Bill Benzon wrote about the book Singing =
Neanderthals which I mentioned earlier...
=20
 "Mithen begins developing his argument about music in groups with a variat=
ion on Miller's argument about sexual selection. Perhaps, argues Bj=C3=B6rn=
 Merker, males in one group would band together in choral musicking to attr=
act lone females wandering away from their groups. He rejects the idea, how=
ever, on the grounds that such musicking would also attract predators. He d=
oes suggest, however, that such activity might well build trust among the m=
ales, and females as well. From there he discusses the ideas of historian W=
illiam McNeill (1995), who emphasizes the value of dance and drill in creat=
ing cohesion within the group and talks as well how group musicking leads t=
o a blurring of personal boundaries and a consequent sense of merging with =
the group.
=20
=20
  Mithen then takes up a discussion of Robert Axelrod's classic work on the=
 prisoner's dilemma, which shows the value of cooperation, but also the dif=
ficulties of achieving it in a world where people's interests are neither c=
ompletely consonant nor opposed and where it is difficult to know one anoth=
er's intentions. Mithen (214) suggests that=20
          music-making is a cheap and easy form of interaction than     can=
 demonstrate a willingness to cooperate and hence may promote future     co=
operation when there are substantial gains to be made ... It can be     tho=
ught of as the first move of a 'TIT for TAT' strategy that is to always    =
 cooperate, one that can be undertaken at no risk because there is nothing =
to     lose if the other members defect - that is, if they do not join in t=
he song     or dance.=20
      The problem with this, Mithen notes, is that, because the costs are l=
ow and the benefits are high, such musicking could easily be exploited by f=
ree-riders. To the extent, however, that musicking leads to a merging of se=
lf with the group - McNeill's argument - this problem may be dissolved (215=
):=20
          Those who make music together will mould their own minds     and =
bodies into a shared emotional state, and with that will come a loss of    =
 self-identity and a concomitant increase in the ability to cooperate with =
    others. In fact, 'cooperate' is not quite correct, because as identitie=
s are     merged there is no 'other' with whom to cooperate, just one group=
 making     decisions about how to behave.=20
      Thus musicking leads to the formation of a group identity within the =
scope of which individuals will be strongly inclined toward cooperation to =
their mutual benefit."
=20

 http://human-nature.com/nibbs/05/wlbenzon.html
=20
=20
=20
 This reminds me a lot of what I've experienced at raves and parties someho=
w, but I'm still missing how the music leads to where the real cooperation =
happens in the creation of events, musical recordings, art work, etc.  Goog=
ling raves and cooperation turns up an article about promoters cooperating =
with law enforcement which is a somewhat different twist on this theme perh=
aps.

Earthly Delights is the 1st, and IMHO the best. But he just released a 
second one, and I can't remember the name offhand, but it's on his MySpace 
page...

QUICK FACTS ON BOTTLED WATER VERSUS CLEANING UP THE
DRINKING WATER SUPPLY

     * Members of the United Nations estimate that if
the world took half of what it currently spends on
bottled water ($100 billion annually) and invested it
in water infrastructure and treatment, everyone in the
world could have access to clean drinking water.
     * But bottled water is cleaner, right? Actually,
the U.S. EPA sets more stringent quality standards for
tap water than the FDA does for bottled beverages, and
roughly 40% of bottled water is actually just tap
water.
     * 1.5 billion barrels of oil are consumed each
year to produce the plastic for water bottles, enough
to fuel 100,000 cars.
     * According to the Container Recycling Institute,
only 14 percent of plastic water bottles are recycled.
     * A water bottle in a landfill or lying around as
litter will take over 1,000 years to biodegrade.

Toilet paper environmental facts to know.
Love the Planet =96 Using Recyclable Toilet Paper:

Do you know that virgin forests are cut down every day
to make toilet paper ? Here=92s what we can do to stop
it.

Toilet Paper Fact:

If every household in the United States replaced just
one roll of virgin fiber toilet paper (500 sheets)
with 100% recycled ones, we could save 423,900 trees.

_________________________________________________

Charmin AVOID _ 0 0 ECF

Cottonelle AVOID _ 0 0 ECF

Note: You can also save trees by using recycled facial
tissues, paper towels, and paper napkins which are
also produced by many of the same brands above.

Three Reminders You Can Do To Help Save Our Forests:

1. Buy paper products with recycled content=97
especially post-consumer fibers.

Look for products that have a high recycled content,
including high post-consumer content. Post-consumer
fibers are recovered from paper that was previously
used by consumers and would otherwise have been dumped
into a landfill or an incinerator.

2. Buy paper products made with clean, safe processes.

Paper products are bleached to make them whiter and
brighter, but chlorine used in many bleaching
processes contributes to the formations of harmful
chemicals that wind up in our air and water and are
highly toxic to people and fish. Look for products
labeled totally chlorine-free (TCF) or processed
chlorine-free (PCF). In some cases, elemental
chlorine-free (ECF) may be acceptable.

3. Tell tissue manufacturers to stop using virgin wood
for throwaway products.

If a brand you buy for your home doesn=92t have any
recycled content, contact the manufacturer. Tell the
company to use more recycled fibers, to avoid sourcing
from ecologically valuable forests such as those in
the Cumberland Plateau and Canadian boreal, and to
ensure any virgin fibers used are certified by the
Forest Stewardship Council. Saving forests also helps
reduce global warming pollution.

Thanks George. ; D
 
And HAHA, you called me 'Lida. Only my second family (oh, and Osby,  
actually) calls me that. : )
 
So I'm not so concerned about the SFRP aspect, since as far as I can tell  
she was considerate enough to not use that name this time, but the underlying  
problem remains, much of which was what I was upset about in the first place  
last time around. I wasn't *so* concerned with the fact that she was using SFRP 
 before (there's nothing inherent about the use of it that bothers me, since 
it's  not ours to own), it was the way she took the name without addressing 
its  members as a whole to let us know about it *and* the way she was conducting 
 herself in planning the party. For example, once again the event is 
restricted  to 21+. How does that accurately reflect the SFR crowd and its history? A  
21+ party is pretty exclusive.
 
Bottom line though, this was all said before and it was pretty well  
established that what Karina was doing was a bit SFR-unethical and a number of  people 
spoke to her about it. It's just baffling to me that she would do it  again.
 
I mean, I'm with Brandon on this, though- I want to give her (or whoever is  
running it) a chance to explain of course, which is why I didn't come out  
throwing punches and instead posed a few simple questions. They shouldn't  be a 
problem for her to answer if her intentions are good and if  perhaps there's 
some magical way we all managed to forget that the list was  addressed when 
planning this party. *shrug*
 
heart,
Alida

and "SFRp", a rave crew that was assembled from people who were (at the  time) 
subscribers and regulars on said list.  Most of SFRp as I know them  have 
largely moved on from raving to new adventures.  I don't know that  the majority 
of them would be too motivated to throw an umpteenth anniversary  party at 
this point.  (I could be wrong, though)

Why isn't Ryan on  this list anymore?  We need somebody to interject "FCUKING 
DUMB SLUT STOP  TRYING TO STEAL OUR STREET CRED, BITCH!" right now.

Chester?   Wanna bring the heat?

I just hope it's not another "SFRaves" party with just about NO SFraves 
DJ's - much like the last one.

When DCRaves did parties, they were all DCRaves DJ's...CONFIRMED & ACTIVE 
members. Not just some jackass that signed up the week prior...

If this is all true and verifiable law like it appears to be... then

Any legal experts know of any other loopholes BushCo may try to slip throug=

on this one?


When Greg Palast, an investigator of corporate fraud and racketeering,
turned his skills to journalism, he was quickly recognized as, "The most
important investigative reporter of our time" [Tribune Magazine] in Britain=
,
where his first reports appeared on BBC
television<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/default.stm>and
in the

GANGSTER GOVERNMENT
A LEAKY PRESIDENT RUNS AFOUL OF 'LITTLE RICO'

By Greg Palast A leaky president run afoul of "Little Rico"

It's a crime. No kidding. But the media has it all wrong. As usual.

'Scooter' Libby finally outed 'Mr. Big,' the perpetrator of the heinous
disclosure of the name of secret agent Valerie Plame. It was the President
of United States himself=97in conspiracy with his Vice-President. Now the
pundits are arguing over whether our war-a-holic President had the legal
right to leak this national security information. But, that's a fake debate
meant to distract you.

OK, let's accept the White House alibi that releasing Plame's identity was
no crime. But if that's true, they've committed a BIGGER crime: Bush and
Cheney knowingly withheld vital information from a grand jury investigation=
,
a multimillion dollar inquiry the perps themselves authorized. That's akin
to calling in a false fire alarm or calling the cops for a burglary that
never happened=97but far, far worse. Let's not forget that in the hunt for =
the
perpetrator of this non-crime, reporter Judith Miller went to jail.

Think about that. While Miller sat in a prison cell, Bush and Cheney were
laughing their sick heads off, knowing the grand jury testimony, the specia=
l
prosecutor's subpoenas and the FBI's terrorizing newsrooms were nothing but
fake props in Bush's elaborate charade, Cheney's Big Con.

On February 10, 2004, our not-so-dumb-as-he-sounds President stated,
"Listen, I know of nobody =96 I don't know of anybody in my administration =
who
leaked classified information. If somebody did leak classified information,
I'd like to know it, and we'll take the appropriate action. And this
investigation is a good thing. ...And if people have got solid information,
please come forward with it."

Notice Bush's cleverly crafted words. He says he can't name anyone who
leaked this "classified" info=97knowing full well he'd de-classified it. Fa=
r
from letting Bush off the hook, it worsens the crime. For years, I worked a=
s
a government investigator and, let me tell you, Bush and Cheney withholding
material information from the grand jury is a felony. Several felonies,
actually: abuse of legal process, fraud, racketeering and, that old standby=
,
obstruction of justice.

If you or I had manipulated the legal system this way, we'd be breaking
rocks on a chain gang. We wouldn't even get a trial =96 most judges would
consider this a "fraud upon the court" and send us to the slammer in minute=
s
using the bench's power to administer instant punishment for contempt of th=
e
judicial system.

Why'd they do it? The White House junta did the deed for the most evil of
motives: to hoodwink the public during the 2004 election campaign, to
pretend that evil anti-Bush elements were undermining the Republic, when it
was the Bush element itself at the center of the conspiracy. (Notably,
elections trickery also motivated Richard Nixon's "plumbers" to break into
the Watergate, then the Democratic Party campaign headquarters.)

Let me draft the indictment for you as I would have were I still a
government gumshoe:

"Perpetrator Lewis Libby (alias, 'Scooter') contacted Miller; while John Do=
e
1 contacted perpetrators' shill at the Washington Post, Bob Woodward, in
furtherance of a scheme directed by George Bush (alias 'The POTUS') and Dic=
k
Cheney (alias, 'The Veep') to release intelligence information fraudulently
proffered as 'classified,' and thereinafter, knowingly withheld material
evidence from a grand jury empanelled to investigate said disclosure.
Furthermore, perpetrator 'The POTUS' made material statements designed to
deceive investigators and knowingly misrepresent his state of knowledge of
the facts."

Statements aimed at misleading grand jury investigators are hard-time
offenses. It doesn't matter that Bush's too-clever little quip was made to
the press and not under oath. I've cited press releases and comments in the
New York Times in court as evidence of fraud. By not swearing to his
disingenuous statement, Bush gets off the perjury hook, but he committed a
crime nonetheless, "deliberate concealment."

Here's how the law works (and hopefully, it will). The Bush gang's use of
the telephone in this con game constituted wire fraud. Furthermore, while
presidents may leak ("declassify") intelligence information, they may not
obstruct justice; that is, send a grand jury on a wild goose chase. Under
the 'RICO' statute (named after the Edward G. Robinson movie mobster,
'Little Rico'), the combination of these crimes makes the Bush executive
branch a "racketeering enterprise."

So, book'm, Dan-o. Time to read The POTUS and The Veep their rights.

After setting their bail (following the impeachments and removals, of
course), a judge will have a more intriguing matter to address. The RICO la=
w
requires the Feds to seize all "ill-gotten gains" of a racketeering
enterprise, even before trial. Usually we're talking fast cars and diamond
bling. But in this case, the conspirators' purloined booty includes a stole=
n
election and a fraudulently obtained authorization for war. I see no reason
why a judge could not impound the 82d Airborne as "fruits of the fraud " =
=96
lock, stock and gun barrels =96 and bring the boys home.

And if justice is to be done we will will also have to run yellow tape
across the gates at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue =96 "CRIME SCENE =96 DO NOT EN=
TER"
=96 and return the White House to its rightful owners, the American people,
the victims of this gangster government.

Yet another panda connection...

  The famous pandas at the national zoo in DC used to get a lot of their 
food from wild bamboo that grew on my in law's land in PG county just 
outside DC.  This was a pretty big deal at the time...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: I Eat Cannibals - Total Coelo 

I"m listening 2 this song right now & just thought I'd share the lyrics :)
 Love U SFR :)
________________________________________

I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

What can you do
You're in a stew
Hot hot cook it up
I'm never gonna stop
Fancy a bite
My appetite
Yum yum gee it's fun
Banging on a different drum

And I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

I like the spice
Tasty and nice
Roastin vitamin
Forget the dietin'
Mmm such a dish
I can't resist
Healthy recipe
What you got is good for me

And I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

All I wanna do
Make a meal of you
We are what we eat
You're my kind of meat

Got a hunger for your love
(Hot pot cook it up, I'm never gonna stop)
It's all I'm thinkin' of
(Yum yum gee it's fun, I'm banging on a drum)
Give the world a bone
(Roastin vitamin, forget the dietin')
I got steak at home
(I eat cannibals)

[extended version only:
I don't need no take away 'cause Chinese food is so risque
The menu is the venue where your heart is, can't you see
I'm not into foreign platters, loving you is all that matters
You're the kind of bull who's put the animal in me]

I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

Roastin', toastin', you're the one I'm boastin'
Eat me, eat you, incredibly delicious too
Gourmet, flambe, serve you up an entree
Intake, home bake, you're the icing on the cake

Eat me, eat you, incredibly delicious too
Gourmet, flambe, serve you up an entree
Intake, home bake, you're the icing on the cake
Full up, can't stop, dicing on a chop chop

been spinning breaks since 1998, and was the man
behind the Blue Harvest and Mystic parties. He has

Lounge, and 550 Barneveld - come watch him rock the
house at our little spot.

Thursdays are always free, the first beat drops at

welcome to the nearly last 6 years of hell. 

Ben Haus <benhaus@gmail.com> wrote: If this is all true and verifiable law like it appears to be... then
damn!!!

Any legal experts know of any other loopholes BushCo may try to slip through
on this one?


When Greg Palast, an investigator of corporate fraud and racketeering,
turned his skills to journalism, he was quickly recognized as, "The most
important investigative reporter of our time" [Tribune Magazine] in Britain,
where his first reports appeared on BBC
televisionand
in the
Guardian  newspapers.



GANGSTER GOVERNMENT
A LEAKY PRESIDENT RUNS AFOUL OF 'LITTLE RICO'

By Greg Palast A leaky president run afoul of "Little Rico"

It's a crime. No kidding. But the media has it all wrong. As usual.

'Scooter' Libby finally outed 'Mr. Big,' the perpetrator of the heinous
disclosure of the name of secret agent Valerie Plame. It was the President
of United States himselfï¿½in conspiracy with his Vice-President. Now the
pundits are arguing over whether our war-a-holic President had the legal
right to leak this national security information. But, that's a fake debate
meant to distract you.

OK, let's accept the White House alibi that releasing Plame's identity was
no crime. But if that's true, they've committed a BIGGER crime: Bush and
Cheney knowingly withheld vital information from a grand jury investigation,
a multimillion dollar inquiry the perps themselves authorized. That's akin
to calling in a false fire alarm or calling the cops for a burglary that
never happenedï¿½but far, far worse. Let's not forget that in the hunt for the
perpetrator of this non-crime, reporter Judith Miller went to jail.

Think about that. While Miller sat in a prison cell, Bush and Cheney were
laughing their sick heads off, knowing the grand jury testimony, the special
prosecutor's subpoenas and the FBI's terrorizing newsrooms were nothing but
fake props in Bush's elaborate charade, Cheney's Big Con.

On February 10, 2004, our not-so-dumb-as-he-sounds President stated,
"Listen, I know of nobody ï¿½ I don't know of anybody in my administration who
leaked classified information. If somebody did leak classified information,
I'd like to know it, and we'll take the appropriate action. And this
investigation is a good thing. ...And if people have got solid information,
please come forward with it."

Notice Bush's cleverly crafted words. He says he can't name anyone who
leaked this "classified" infoï¿½knowing full well he'd de-classified it. Far
from letting Bush off the hook, it worsens the crime. For years, I worked as
a government investigator and, let me tell you, Bush and Cheney withholding
material information from the grand jury is a felony. Several felonies,
actually: abuse of legal process, fraud, racketeering and, that old standby,
obstruction of justice.

If you or I had manipulated the legal system this way, we'd be breaking
rocks on a chain gang. We wouldn't even get a trial ï¿½ most judges would
consider this a "fraud upon the court" and send us to the slammer in minutes
using the bench's power to administer instant punishment for contempt of the
judicial system.

Why'd they do it? The White House junta did the deed for the most evil of
motives: to hoodwink the public during the 2004 election campaign, to
pretend that evil anti-Bush elements were undermining the Republic, when it
was the Bush element itself at the center of the conspiracy. (Notably,
elections trickery also motivated Richard Nixon's "plumbers" to break into
the Watergate, then the Democratic Party campaign headquarters.)

Let me draft the indictment for you as I would have were I still a
government gumshoe:

"Perpetrator Lewis Libby (alias, 'Scooter') contacted Miller; while John Doe
1 contacted perpetrators' shill at the Washington Post, Bob Woodward, in
furtherance of a scheme directed by George Bush (alias 'The POTUS') and Dick
Cheney (alias, 'The Veep') to release intelligence information fraudulently
proffered as 'classified,' and thereinafter, knowingly withheld material
evidence from a grand jury empanelled to investigate said disclosure.
Furthermore, perpetrator 'The POTUS' made material statements designed to
deceive investigators and knowingly misrepresent his state of knowledge of
the facts."

Statements aimed at misleading grand jury investigators are hard-time
offenses. It doesn't matter that Bush's too-clever little quip was made to
the press and not under oath. I've cited press releases and comments in the
New York Times in court as evidence of fraud. By not swearing to his
disingenuous statement, Bush gets off the perjury hook, but he committed a
crime nonetheless, "deliberate concealment."

Here's how the law works (and hopefully, it will). The Bush gang's use of
the telephone in this con game constituted wire fraud. Furthermore, while
presidents may leak ("declassify") intelligence information, they may not
obstruct justice; that is, send a grand jury on a wild goose chase. Under
the 'RICO' statute (named after the Edward G. Robinson movie mobster,
'Little Rico'), the combination of these crimes makes the Bush executive
branch a "racketeering enterprise."

So, book'm, Dan-o. Time to read The POTUS and The Veep their rights.

After setting their bail (following the impeachments and removals, of
course), a judge will have a more intriguing matter to address. The RICO law
requires the Feds to seize all "ill-gotten gains" of a racketeering
enterprise, even before trial. Usually we're talking fast cars and diamond
bling. But in this case, the conspirators' purloined booty includes a stolen
election and a fraudulently obtained authorization for war. I see no reason
why a judge could not impound the 82d Airborne as "fruits of the fraud " ï¿½
lock, stock and gun barrels ï¿½ and bring the boys home.

And if justice is to be done we will will also have to run yellow tape
across the gates at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ï¿½ "CRIME SCENE ï¿½ DO NOT ENTER"
ï¿½ and return the White House to its rightful owners, the American people,
the victims of this gangster government.

The Sisters present Perpetual Indulgence in the Park

Sunday, April 16th

11:00am - 4:00pm-ish

Free

----/ Event Description /-----------------------------------------------

Continuing their mission to promulgate Universal Joy, the Sisters of  
Perpetual Indulgence are proud to announce "Perpetual Indulgence" in  
the Park, an Easter picnic and celebration. This very San Francisco  
event brings together children, families, friends, artists and community activists all on  
one lawn to celebrate the Sisters' 27th Anniversary and enjoy a day  
in Dolores Park. This event is free to the public. "Perpetual  
Indulgence" in the Park promises to be lively and vivacious  
incorporating stage performances, children's activities and two cash- 
prize contests.

Sister MaryMae Himm, this year's chair of "Perpetual Indulgence" in  
the Park, says "We have all of the old favorites, the Hunky Jesus  
Contest, the Bonnet Contest, Grants Giveaways and Saintings, but we  
are planning a lot of surprises and fun new tricks. The best thing  
about the Sisters' Birthday Celebration is that there is something  
for everyone. It's a true family day, from the kids events in the  
morning, picnicking in the park and ending with the more risqu?  
things like the Hunky Jesus and Bonnet Contests. It's one of the few  
times you really can make everyone happy."

At 1p, participants will line up to parade across the stage in their  
Easter finest for our Bonnet Contest. Later, at 3:15p, this year's  
Hunky Jesus will be chosen. Both winners will receive a $100 cash prize.

In addition to providing an afternoon of merriment, the Sisters also  
hope to raise money for a whole year of grants awards.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Subject: [sfraves] This is the end...

Well...as much as this is tearing me up to post this, I have to suck it up 
and do it.

I'm selling off my record collection. I have a shitload of vinyl, so I'm not 
going to take the time to catalog it all and list it. I'm going to open up 
times at my apartment where you all can come and dig thru my stacks, listen, 
and god willing - purchase stuff.

Some VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS....I *cannot* do deals - either for bulk or for 
visual wear & tear issues. My financial situation is positively dire, so 
please don't give me shit about prices or try haggling - this is literally 
everything I own that's worth anything, and it's killing me to part with 
them.

The vast majority of my records have been well cared for. They may needs 
some cleaning, but all in all they're in great condition.

I have everything from breakbeat, to house, tech-house, drum & bass, trance 
and more. I have a ton of older stuff that's rare or hard to find, or just 
plain obscenely expensive due to rarity or popularity.

After the vinyl, my mixer will go - it's a Vestax PMC 250, used, but works 
great. I think I can even get an extra cross fader for you from a friend of 
mine (but I'll have to check on that).

I'll be holding back one bag's worth of records for what will most likely be 
my last gig @ 1015 on the 21st of this month - after that night, those 
records will be for sale as well.

Anyone who has heard me knows I have good records...so please, if you know 
folks who are looking, let me know.

I seriously feel sick posting this - but my life went to hell over the last 
month, and there's no end in sight. I have tried to find a 2nd job, but 
every opportunity has fallen through, my rent is late, my bank is way 
overdrawn, when my next paycheck comes in, it'll be decimated within minutes 
then I'll be back in the red. I have about 10 things poised to go to 
collections, and no way to recover. I've tried to look for a loan of some 
kind, but my credit is just shitty enough to make sure that'll never happen. 
I'd ask my folks for money, but I don't come from a well off family, so 
that's also a dead end. This is my last resort...I hope you guys can help 
me.

Thanks for all the support everyone has given me in my DJing...it's really 
meant the world to me. I wish there was another way for me to get around 
this dilemma - as DJing has been my sanctuary for the last 5 years. Maybe 
some day in the future I'll be back, but for now, it's time to face the 
music one last time.

Holy fuck man!!  This does NOT sound like a very good idea.  I hardly know
you Marco..but this doesn't sit very well with me.  You seem extremely
passionate about music, and to sell off the things that make you tick?  Are
you sure there isn't another way you can get by??  What is your work
skillset?  If I can help, I will.  Shoot me your resume.  I have a couple
great friends who work in high tech recruitment positions.  Is it that your
day job isn't paying enough, or are the bills just racking up to a point
that a second job is the only option??  If I can help, I will.  Get in
touch.  Please.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] This is the end...

Day job doesn't pay enough, and I can't really adjust my schedule to 
accomodate another position unless the hours are uber flexible or just 
reserved to weekends. I tried taking a job driving an escort which promised 
to pay well, but woulda had me working my day job from 9am to 6pm, then 
driving her from 8pm to 6am - and I honestly woulda been all over it had she 
not flaked out on me.

And you're right Chris - music has been my life since I can't tell you when. 
When my last band fucked me over and took all my shit and split town (back 
in DC), I found my way to DJing, and it's been my life ever since - it's 
right uip there with food, air, sleep and the other essential bullshit for 
me. But, there's a time when you have to suck it up and do what you need to 
do to survive. Truth be told, unless I get a good price on m,y stuff, this 
might barely serve to keep me afloat - but it's the only chance I have right 
now, and I'm not about to have my wages garnished because I didn't lift a 
finger to help myself.

If I could sell my ass right now and not hate myself for it, I would do that 
way before this...but that's just not my thing.

As far as my resume - my tech experience is limited to desktop support 
pretty much (which I've been doing the last year or more), a glorified 
customer service rep at best. I mean, I HAVE a decent chunk of skills - but 
nothing I can really take to a part time position anywhere. I have no certs, 
no degree, and the last few years I was contracting mostly, so it looks like 
I'm the biggest flake on earth. I guess in hindsight , given my current 
position, that's not too far off from the truth...

ANyway...if you can think of anything that would keep me from selling off my

"Barracuda" del Monte, this Toronto native now living in Cologne is a
man of wry charm and multiple musical masks.  Under his Pan/Tone
alais, the two time MUTEK veteran takes sweaty minimal techno and

party vibe to create his signature "Rockno" sound.  Come see for your
self why the Germans call him "The Craziest Woodsman in Canada!"

________________________________________________


The life and times of the former Sheldon Thompson, aka PAN/TONE:

Native to the northern regions of Ontario where ice fishing and
ski-doos are all the rage, Shelbono LeRoche currently lives in
Cologne, Germany with at least 20 bars in walking distance (the
closest one is where you might suspect to find him.) With over 20
releases, 3 albums in 2004-2005 alone, the man with many faces is
bouncing and crashing his way around the world to bring new breath of
sounds to dancefloors under the alias's of PAN/TONE (sub-static,
sender/kompakt, 240 Volts), SID LeROCK (Ladomat2000, Mute) and GRINGO
GRINDER (Onitor). With a steady output of releases, he has seen one of
his busiest years unfold with great success, coming with the privilege
of seeing many new cities and meeting many like minded individuals.
With more production under way for future releases under all names,
Shelbono has been commited to detoxing himself to better health to
prepare himself again for 2006. The neighbours now find themselves
lucky to be next to a producer preparing for his next album(s) in the
midnight hours.

A warning to the promoters: Please make sure to tell him who he is
performing as in advance...things become a little fuzzy after a few
drinks...make sure to repeat, then send him on his way and all will be
fine...the music and the moment will meet its maker. Music will then
be very LOUD and the boys will be screaming like little girls and the
girls will be dancing all over your nice furniture... piss drunk like
a sailor.... which is exactly what happened at all of the following
clubs and/or festivals:

CANADA: MUTEK festival/montreal, footwork/toronto, element
club/toronto. ENGLAND (UK): london/FABRIC, london/foreign muck.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] This is the end...

I'm with Chris on this...selling your records is just the wrong thing to do.  I've been down and out financially myself not very long ago.  Selling your records is the wrong way to go.
 
 
 Here's some other ideas.  
 
 1. 14th anniversary benefit SFR party with some unknown charity?  That's pretty lame.  Sorry Karina, but it is.  There's a good cause right here to help one of our own.  Someone should set up a benefit party in the next two weeks to help Marco keep his records.  I'll be there supporting if someone can pull it off.  Moreover, I might be able to help with some of the expenses of making it happen.  Bam?  Anyone?  I'm serious here.  I'm not rich, but I'll contribute what I can to make this happen.
 
 2. Everyone and anyone that might be able to help with employment, its time to come forward.  I've posted some jobs previously, but Marco go over to the Stanford website and check out the employment section.  If you find anything at all there that might help you I can have my wife put in the word for you.  Unfortunately, my company isn't hiring until the summer at the earliest.  Marco you should take Chris up on his offer even if you think you are underqualified!
 
 3. Everyone on the list contact Marco directly and find out what he needs that you can help with.  A few free meals can go a long way to paying the PGE bill.  A little bit of herb can ease the tensions.  An old BART ticket you don't need anymore can help with transport.  A part time gig, even if the pay sucks, might make the difference.  Etc.  Etc.
 
 I'm about to head out of town until Monday, but I will try to check my e-mail and see what's happening with this.  I think we as a community can really help here if we try.  And this way we get to keep hearing Marco's music so you are helping yourself and the scene too.
 
 Feel free to contact me directly about this everyone.
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter

Holy fuck man!!  This does NOT sound like a very good idea.  I hardly know
you Marco..but this doesn't sit very well with me.  You seem extremely
passionate about music, and to sell off the things that make you tick?  Are
you sure there isn't another way you can get by??  What is your work
skillset?  If I can help, I will.  Shoot me your resume.  I have a couple
great friends who work in high tech recruitment positions.  Is it that your

Subject: [sfraves] This is the end...
Importance: High

Well...as much as this is tearing me up to post this, I have to suck it up 
and do it.

I'm selling off my record collection. I have a shitload of vinyl, so I'm not

going to take the time to catalog it all and list it. I'm going to open up 
times at my apartment where you all can come and dig thru my stacks, listen,

and god willing - purchase stuff.

Some VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS....I *cannot* do deals - either for bulk or for 
visual wear & tear issues. My financial situation is positively dire, so 
please don't give me shit about prices or try haggling - this is literally 
everything I own that's worth anything, and it's killing me to part with 
them.

The vast majority of my records have been well cared for. They may needs 
some cleaning, but all in all they're in great condition.

I have everything from breakbeat, to house, tech-house, drum & bass, trance 
and more. I have a ton of older stuff that's rare or hard to find, or just 
plain obscenely expensive due to rarity or popularity.

After the vinyl, my mixer will go - it's a Vestax PMC 250, used, but works 
great. I think I can even get an extra cross fader for you from a friend of 
mine (but I'll have to check on that).

I'll be holding back one bag's worth of records for what will most likely be

my last gig @ 1015 on the 21st of this month - after that night, those 
records will be for sale as well.

Anyone who has heard me knows I have good records...so please, if you know 
folks who are looking, let me know.

I seriously feel sick posting this - but my life went to hell over the last 
month, and there's no end in sight. I have tried to find a 2nd job, but 
every opportunity has fallen through, my rent is late, my bank is way 
overdrawn, when my next paycheck comes in, it'll be decimated within minutes

then I'll be back in the red. I have about 10 things poised to go to 
collections, and no way to recover. I've tried to look for a loan of some 
kind, but my credit is just shitty enough to make sure that'll never happen.

I'd ask my folks for money, but I don't come from a well off family, so 
that's also a dead end. This is my last resort...I hope you guys can help 
me.

Thanks for all the support everyone has given me in my DJing...it's really 
meant the world to me. I wish there was another way for me to get around 
this dilemma - as DJing has been my sanctuary for the last 5 years. Maybe 
some day in the future I'll be back, but for now, it's time to face the 
music one last time.

~Marco

I"m listening 2 this song right now & just thought I'd share the lyrics :)
 Love U SFR :)
________________________________________

I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

What can you do
You're in a stew
Hot hot cook it up
I'm never gonna stop
Fancy a bite
My appetite
Yum yum gee it's fun
Banging on a different drum

And I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

I like the spice
Tasty and nice
Roastin vitamin
Forget the dietin'
Mmm such a dish
I can't resist
Healthy recipe
What you got is good for me

And I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

All I wanna do
Make a meal of you
We are what we eat
You're my kind of meat

Got a hunger for your love
(Hot pot cook it up, I'm never gonna stop)
It's all I'm thinkin' of
(Yum yum gee it's fun, I'm banging on a drum)
Give the world a bone
(Roastin vitamin, forget the dietin')
I got steak at home
(I eat cannibals)

[extended version only:
I don't need no take away 'cause Chinese food is so risque
The menu is the venue where your heart is, can't you see
I'm not into foreign platters, loving you is all that matters
You're the kind of bull who's put the animal in me]

I eat cannibal
Feed on animal
Your love is so edible to me
I eat cannibals

I eat cannibal
It's incredible
You bring out the animal in me
I eat cannibals

Roastin', toastin', you're the one I'm boastin'
Eat me, eat you, incredibly delicious too
Gourmet, flambe, serve you up an entree
Intake, home bake, you're the icing on the cake

Eat me, eat you, incredibly delicious too
Gourmet, flambe, serve you up an entree
Intake, home bake, you're the icing on the cake
Full up, can't stop, dicing on a chop chop

Subject: Re: [sfraves] This is the end...

Babs and I will personally come out there and kill you if you sell off
your records.

If either of us could afford it.

:-(

I got tons of work at Stanford through Manpower in Palo Alto with
about the same skillset you describe here.

Had bunches of chances to go full time there which i passed on because
it was in the midst of the gold-rush frenzy, which I'm kicking myself
for now, but oh, well.

This is The Year of The Dog and if 1994 is any indication it's gonna
be another slog for everybody this year, but take heart next year is
the year of The Pig which is suppossed to be a prosperous one.

Keep us posted, sounds like you've made lots of friends since you've
been out there, so it doesn't sound like you're going to starve, for
one.

A recent caller to Jerry Springer's AirAmerica Radio said that it took
him a while, but he finally figured out that...

"my Net worth has nothing at all to do with my Self-Worth"

That one has been carrying me for a while now.

Peace,

nic

I agree,

there are other solutions. I have had to sell off my records a half dozen time or so because I was broke but at the end of the day I could have found other ways to make the money and have had to replace the good track over the years which has been a pain in the ass.

 Here's some other ideas.  
 
 1. 14th anniversary benefit SFR party with some unknown charity?  That's pretty lame.  Sorry Karina, but it is.  There's a good cause right here to help one of our own.  Someone should set up a benefit party in the next two weeks to help Marco keep his records.  I'll be there supporting if someone can pull it off.  Moreover, I might be able to help with some of the expenses of making it happen.  Bam?  Anyone?  I'm serious here.  I'm not rich, but I'll contribute what I can to make this happen.
 
 2. Everyone and anyone that might be able to help with employment, its time to come forward.  I've posted some jobs previously, but Marco go over to the Stanford website and check out the employment section.  If you find anything at all there that might help you I can have my wife put in the word for you.  Unfortunately, my company isn't hiring until the summer at the earliest.  Marco you should take Chris up on his offer even if you think you are underqualified!
 
 3. Everyone on the list contact Marco directly and find out what he needs that you can help with.  A few free meals can go a long way to paying the PGE bill.  A little bit of herb can ease the tensions.  An old BART ticket you don't need anymore can help with transport.  A part time gig, even if the pay sucks, might make the difference.  Etc.  Etc.
 
 I'm about to head out of town until Monday, but I will try to check my e-mail and see what's happening with this.  I think we as a community can really help here if we try.  And this way we get to keep hearing Marco's music so you are helping yourself and the scene too.
 
 Feel free to contact me directly about this everyone.
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter

Importance: High

Well...as much as this is tearing me up to post this, I have to suck it up 
and do it.

I'm selling off my record collection. I have a shitload of vinyl, so I'm not

going to take the time to catalog it all and list it. I'm going to open up 
times at my apartment where you all can come and dig thru my stacks, listen,

and god willing - purchase stuff.

Some VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS....I *cannot* do deals - either for bulk or for 
visual wear & tear issues. My financial situation is positively dire, so 
please don't give me shit about prices or try haggling - this is literally 
everything I own that's worth anything, and it's killing me to part with 
them.

The vast majority of my records have been well cared for. They may needs 
some cleaning, but all in all they're in great condition.

I have everything from breakbeat, to house, tech-house, drum & bass, trance 
and more. I have a ton of older stuff that's rare or hard to find, or just 
plain obscenely expensive due to rarity or popularity.

After the vinyl, my mixer will go - it's a Vestax PMC 250, used, but works 
great. I think I can even get an extra cross fader for you from a friend of 
mine (but I'll have to check on that).

I'll be holding back one bag's worth of records for what will most likely be

my last gig @ 1015 on the 21st of this month - after that night, those 
records will be for sale as well.

Anyone who has heard me knows I have good records...so please, if you know 
folks who are looking, let me know.

I seriously feel sick posting this - but my life went to hell over the last 
month, and there's no end in sight. I have tried to find a 2nd job, but 
every opportunity has fallen through, my rent is late, my bank is way 
overdrawn, when my next paycheck comes in, it'll be decimated within minutes

then I'll be back in the red. I have about 10 things poised to go to 
collections, and no way to recover. I've tried to look for a loan of some 
kind, but my credit is just shitty enough to make sure that'll never happen.

I'd ask my folks for money, but I don't come from a well off family, so 
that's also a dead end. This is my last resort...I hope you guys can help 
me.

Thanks for all the support everyone has given me in my DJing...it's really 
meant the world to me. I wish there was another way for me to get around 
this dilemma - as DJing has been my sanctuary for the last 5 years. Maybe 
some day in the future I'll be back, but for now, it's time to face the 
music one last time.

~Marco

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: The Panda Rejects III - The Monkey At-tax

i know a lot of people on this list don't go out much anymore...and if
you do, you tend to go to the same places and hang out with the same
people.

if you haven't been checking out what's been going down in the local
breaks slash burner scene, i'd highly recommend this party.

ps.  i'm not playing breaks.  i'm playing old school hip hop and 80s.


The Panda Rejects III - The Monkey At-tax
April 15th, 2006
11pm-8am
$10


It's finally time for us Panda rejects to throw another party. And
recently it has come to our attention that one of our fellow panda's
has been having a difficult time with the IRS. So we decided to get
together and throw another kick-ass party, but this time make it a
benefit for our poor little panda in need. And what better day to do
this than to do it on tax day. So here we go again, Panda vs Monkey
this time.

We will also be giving out a mp3 cd compilation of the panda dj's to
the best dressed pandas and monkeys for the night. We will be selling
these cd's @ the door for only $10 to help raise a little bit more
money for those of you that don't feel the urge to dress up. The disc
will have 5+ hours of music with a complete set from each of the panda
dj's, and it is very limited edition.

We also wanted to thank all the dj's for donating their time for a
good cause, and we would like to thank everyone for coming out and
supporting the show in advance. Because we know you will, you can't
resist us cause we're cute and fuzzy.


The Panda dj's:

Kapt'n Kirk (panda #01)
Aaron Jae (panda #73)
Ernie Trevino (panda #1138)
Donna Matrix (panda #cos(pi)root2/(2(pi))squared)
Alxndr (panda #69)


Our Panda-rific friends:

dj Bella (Florida)
Mancub
Tung
Dov
Rodman
Goldilox
Mozaic
Bam
J9


PandaRiffic RefresHment Servers Serving UP fine refeshments for all
our pandarejects!!

pandas serving you will be:
Lilc (Panda #43)
Hilife (Panda #16)

and special panda guest

And I heard there might be some kind of crazy breakfest goin on. Bacon

Subject: RE: [sfraves] This is the end...

I'd like to see you play again...douche.

But y'all - this benefit idea. Even if you guys do wanna do that, I have to 
help in some way...I dunno how, but I can't just accept charity or help 
without giving *something* in return. I'm an able bodied person, and I'd 
much rather work for assistance.

Otherwise I'd just get out all my old punk rock tshirts and go beg for $$ on 
Telegraph with the rest of the squatter punks, lol.

Marco,

I've been there. Don't worry, in the future you'll look back on this time
and smile that you have pulled yourself up over the obsticles and are doing
better. I recently went through a similar time in my life. Do what you have
to do to get through it, but just keep reminding yourself, you will get
through it. Trust me, life is like a sine wave and unless you turn the
oscillator off you can always go back up.

I'd like to see you play again...douche.

But y'all - this benefit idea. Even if you guys do wanna do that, I have to 
help in some way...I dunno how, but I can't just accept charity or help 
without giving *something* in return. I'm an able bodied person, and I'd 
much rather work for assistance.

Otherwise I'd just get out all my old punk rock tshirts and go beg for $$ on 
Telegraph with the rest of the squatter punks, lol.

The Panda Rejects III - The Monkey At-tax
April 15th, 2006
11pm-8am
$10


It's finally time for us Panda rejects to throw another party. And
recently it has come to our attention that one of our fellow panda's
has been having a difficult time with the IRS. So we decided to get
together and throw another kick-ass party, but this time make it a
benefit for our poor little panda in need. And what better day to do
this than to do it on tax day. So here we go again, Panda vs Monkey
this time.

We will also be giving out a mp3 cd compilation of the panda dj's to
the best dressed pandas and monkeys for the night. We will be selling
these cd's @ the door for only $10 to help raise a little bit more
money for those of you that don't feel the urge to dress up. The disc
will have 5+ hours of music with a complete set from each of the panda
dj's, and it is very limited edition.

We also wanted to thank all the dj's for donating their time for a
good cause, and we would like to thank everyone for coming out and
supporting the show in advance. Because we know you will, you can't
resist us cause we're cute and fuzzy.


The Panda dj's:

Kapt'n Kirk (panda #01)
Aaron Jae (panda #73)
Ernie Trevino (panda #1138)
Donna Matrix (panda #cos(pi)root2/(2(pi))squared)
Alxndr (panda #69)


Our Panda-rific friends:

dj Bella (Florida)
Mancub
Tung
Dov
Rodman
Goldilox

Subject: RE: [sfraves] This is the end...

ah man...  i'm sorry.  I don't know you, but your posts are always 
good ones to read.  I was facing something similar last month - I'm 
in here in london, my work visa was running out, I couldn't get a 
tech job (plenty of interviews, but I was fumbling through them - 
mind going blank when they'd ask me stupid questions a recent 
graduate would know (though.. what are they doing insulting me like 
that (14 years experience in IT))    probably some age discrimination 
issues...  or i should have been applying for the
more management jobs (but that's not really in my resume explicitly) 
and I hate political crap

really, I was struggling with the sort of conscious knowledge that I 
didn't really want to do IT anymore, or at least not the grueling 
focused work for a corp stuff - so my unconscious was @#### with me. 
I went to film school a few years ago and have been sitting on that, 
worrying more about the money thing (IT does pay too good...)

did I mention there was a hoseup with my US bank account and I've had 
to live off my credit card for 2 months?  the ATM machine ate my card 
because my bank was merging with another company and killing all the 
bank account functions.   I have to come back to SF May 1st to 
straighten out this mess.

and couldn't apply for the visa extension till i got a job....  so it 
was looking like i'd have to return to the
states, which any sane person would be horrified of...

but...  i idly applied for an intern position with a film production 
company doing <whatever>, planning
on killing time till I have to come back.  As it turns out, they 
needed an IT guy to build a website for displaying content they have 
the rights for to potential buyers, so i got hired 24 hours later. 
forcibly  :)

then I got the visa extension in less than a week, despite missing 
the deadline for applying [the british
are careless in general - customer service, the bureaucracy, the 
trains...]    the boss said to go ahead and apply...

yeah, I'm doing IT, but I am getting an intro to the real world of 
film as well - the business side at least.
The work environment is bare bones, but enjoyable - I had an 
interview scheduled with Google over here, but really, google (and 
other companies) pamper you to make you forget you are a slave.

And I get 10% of whatever profit the website makes - that does NOT 
happen in the IT world.  Engineers get paid a pittance and MBAs / 
management make all the money.  enough of that crap!

so in summary, hang in there.   try and figure out what your bliss 
really is and keep an eye on that or
out for opportunities to merge your current skillset with the bliss 
thing.   this prod co i'm with wants to get into multimedia / merge 
of tech and entertainment (like cellphones with TV stuff) and I'm 
damn perfect for that - tech knowledge _and_ I went to film school.

and the boss is dragging everyone to sicily next month for some shoot 
or something  :)

I got some irons in the fire, and some very kind people are looking to help 
me out - you all know who you are, and I thank you SINCERELY from the bottom 
of my heart.

I'll keep everyone posted...in the meanwhile, thanks to all of you for your 
love and support. This is the hardest thing I've had to deal with out here, 
and I'm doing everything within my power to get past it so I can continue to 
stay here and live and love in the community I now call my home. You guys 
have really done nothing but prove to me how truly amazing folks are out 
here, and reinforced why I live here...

Yah, I know the weather has been crappy, but there's actually a decent
chance we'll be going forward with this party on Friday, 4/14.  The current
forecast calls for some scatter showers friday evening, then broken clouds
and even some sunshine on saturday morning.  If you don't have the info, as=
k
around for the infoline, please don't post it on here.   In the event we ar=
e
rained out, we'll most likely be doing a free outdoor make-up party the
following friday, the 21st.

Jim Hopkins  (twitch recordings/electroliners)
Phil Gauthier   (tribal souls)
jesse (tribal souls)
Dave L  (acid totem)
D'andre  (acid totem)
Ben Haus  (acid totem)

See ya there  :)

  I got some irons in the fire, and some very kind people are looking to help

of my heart.

I'll keep everyone posted...in the meanwhile, thanks to all of you for your 
love and support. This is the hardest thing I've had to deal with out here, 
and I'm doing everything within my power to get past it so I can continue to 
stay here and live and love in the community I now call my home. You guys 
have really done nothing but prove to me how truly amazing folks are out 
here, and reinforced why I live here...

Invitation sent to list to sfraves@hyperreal.org

It was posted here before being posted on tribe, in the last two SFRaves 
Calendar mailings last Friday and Saturday, respectively and now as well 
in a formal listing

It's a birthday party for SFRaves and a benefit for Hyperreal plus a 
not-for-profit charity - I am requesting input on the list for the charity 
to be determined. All artists are donating their time and proceeds will 
benefit Hyperreal (SFRaves) as a gift back to SFRaves / Hyperreal for the 
14 years of hosting this list, our website and community. A portion of the 
proceeds will benefit a local non-profit charity as determined per the 
SFRaves list vote / decision to GIVE back to the community.

Please see above. There is an open invitation for all to participate if 
interested. This is a Benefit for SFRaves and Birthday for SFRaves - as 
far as the intention is and the benefit is for - SFRaves is the intended 
celebrant, participant and recipient.

I hope that this community can appreciate a gift back in lieu of finding 
soemthing wrong with a benefit for SFRaves - this intention is the bring 
the community together, not tear it apart.

Love Karina

Those who wish to participate in the organization include a number of 
folks who have already responded from the community, those who wish to 
participate from the SFRaves List PLUS community - as well as the End Up, 
myself and other voluteers.

> 2)  what non-profit is it going to benefit

Not for profits (Hyperreal / SFRaves) donated to: The Hyperreal Fund @

http://hyperreal.org/info/fund.html

on behalf of SFRaves -

And partial funds to be donated to a Not-for-Profit organization per the 
vote of the SFRaves Community on the Hyperreal list... to be decided and 
voted upon publically on this list.

This was the date that was donated and available.

I guess there is a distinction/line to be drawn between the "San Francisco Raves List", which Karina could certainly be said to have played an integral part in over the years, and "SFRp", a rave crew that was assembled from people who were (at the time) subscribers and regulars on said list.  Most of SFRp as I know them have largely moved on from raving to new adventures.  I don't know that the majority of them would be too motivated to throw an umpteenth anniversary party at this point.

So basically - Karina decides there will be an "SF Raves" party, then  
starts looking for "participants".

Karina, this has been an issue before, and here it is again. We all  
know you admin the list, but this is more than just a list - it's a  
community.  If you are going to have an event and say that it is for,  
and by, the community, well then you had better make sure that the  
community is invited to help plan the event, from it's inception.

I consider this an abuse of your 'authority' (for lack of a better  
term) with the SFR List.  I'm not the only one who feels this way.

I think people were just confused because until today, it was never posted 
to SFRaves. At least *I* never saw anything until Bam posted something, and 
then now the "official" posting.

Incidentally, I volunteered my DJing services, and the dude said he'd have 
to run that by you...so, now you've been officially notified, that I want to 
spin (hey - it might be one of my last gigs if I can't get my finances 
straight and have to sell off all my vinyl).

ez.

Hi: Please excuse me if I'm being presumptuous, but given the discussions I just thought I would post these three software engineering positions that Doug is trying to fill at his work (he's Director of Engineering, so the jobs report to him).
   
  Zinio is a smallish company in San Francisco, nice people, steady, profitable, and they need help big time. I think their Product Development and QA departments also have openings, so if you don't do user-interface, maybe there's something else. 
   
  Anyway, just wanted to toss it out there - based on the talk it just seems like a lot of folks on the list are technology types and you never know. Hope this doesn't offend - it's well-meant. If you have any questions, you're welcome to contact me offline.
   
  Thanks, Marla

It seems there has been some confusion as to how this event has come to be.


This was brought up by Shatter, who has been around for many years in one
form or another.  He suggested that with the change of the format on
Thursdays, it would be nice gesture on behalf of The Endup to do something
for the SF Rave community at large.

Over the past 14 years the SF Raves community has grown from being a small
sub page on Hyper Real to a comprehensive collective of people world wide
ranging from the mailing list, to tribe, friendster, MySpave, Live Journal,
and beyond.  It has grown beyond San Francisco, to something world wide.

The Endup recognizes all of the accomplishments, the ability to keep this
alive when all odds are against you, be it political, govenment, police, an=
d
mainstream.  The Endup knows these problems all too well.

Thus, we decided we wante dto do something for everyone.  Shatter put out
the call for DJ's who fell SF Raves have given them something, and want a
chance to give back.  Shatter has known Karina Powers personally for many
years, and knows her as a contact point for the SF Raves community.

The Endup has been using Tribe for a while now for overall community
involvement, thus, it was posted there first.

Just to note, this isn't a 14th Anniversary party.  It's a SF Raves benefit
hosted by The Endup.  We would never be so bold as to decide to throw the
official SF Raves anniversary.  If that was percieved by any of the posting=
,
our apologies.  That was not our intent.  We just simply were acknowledging
14 years of work by teh SF Raves community.

I hope this clears things up.

If you have any concerns or questions, please direct them to this adress.
If you are interested in contributing to this benefit, contact
shatter@sonic.net directly with the subject line NEXUS.


Thank you

That's cool. I can't speak for everyone, but I don't think anyone would  
object to that.

Shatter  put out
the call for DJ's who fell SF Raves have given them something, and  want a
chance to give back.  Shatter has known Karina Powers  personally for many
years, and knows her as a contact point for the SF  Raves community.
Sorry, and was this call for DJs posted on SFR? I don't  think anyone saw it 
on here. Seems that would be the most relevant place to post  it and it's 
obvious that people would have been interested, as evident by the  recent crop of 
postings volunteering their skills since all of this came  up. Thus, seems 
like a call to DJs/BSP about this/call for party planning would  have generated a 
large response.

The  Endup has been using Tribe for a while now for overall  community
involvement, thus, it was posted there first.
Okay... but that's still a strange thing to do. I'm not going to change my  
position on that.

Just to  note, this isn't a 14th Anniversary party.  It's a SF Raves  benefit
hosted by The Endup.  We would never be so bold as to decide  to throw the
official SF Raves anniversary.  If that was percieved by  any of the posting,
our apologies.  That was not our intent.  We  just simply were acknowledging
14 years of work by teh SF Raves  community.

Uh.. you *might* want to speak with Karina about that, then:
 
-From her recent response: "It's a birthday party for  SFRaves and a benefit 
for Hyperreal plus a 
not-for-profit charity -  I am requesting input on the list for the charity 
to be determined."
 
-And on her tribe posting: "SFRaves 14th BDAY ANNIVERSARY BASH  

SFRaves Calendar 11th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION"
 
That is *seriously* misleading if indeed this is simply a benefit for  
SFRaves. In fact, to avoid confusion, I would suggest removing "birthday"  or 
"anniversary" from the title of the event all together. When explaining your  
reasoning for throwing the party, you can certainly note that with fourteen  years 
under its belt of giving to the community, you thought you would  do the same 
and give something back to SFR. That seems perfectly reasonable and  still 
accomplishes your goal. Using either "birthday" or "anniversary" in the  title a 
misleading use of the word in this case. If nothing else, it should say,  "SFR 
Benefit: In Honor of Its 14th Birthday" or something along those  lines.
 
Also, from the tribe posting: "We're looking for DJ's specifically that SF  
Raves have helped, a testamonial of sorts. All talent will be ran past SF Raves 
 for final approval. "
 
I don't know if that was added since all of this came up, since I didn't  see 
that before and neither did a few other people. I don't think people would  
have made such a fuss if that condition was previously listed, but perhaps we  
all managed to not see it. Either way, I think people would appreciate  that.
 
Thanks for the e-mail trying to clear this all up. I still think this all  
seems a little strange and poorly orchestrated, but good luck with the party,  
regardless.
 
Heart,
Alida

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Clarification of the Benefit @ Endup on May 18th

The bit about the DJ approval dealio was indeed there before. I send in my 
request to spin with a blurb about how the SFRaves community has helped me, 
and this was BEFORE this current fiasco I'm in. I would almost like to 
retract the last blurb and make a whole new one, as clearly the SFRaves 
community is down for helping one of their own in a pinch....you guys 
seriously came through when shit was looking awfully grim for me, and I have 
no proper way to express my appreciation right now. I hope that maybe they 
book me so I can give you guys back what you stopped me from losing...

June Pointer Loses Cancer Battle 




Diva, 52, was youngest member of the Grammy-winning trio 

June Pointer, the youngest of the Grammy-winning trio the Pointer Sisters, who scored hits with "I'm So Excited" and "Jump (For My Love)," died of an undisclosed type of cancer on Tuesday in Los Angeles. She was fifty-two years old.

June had been hospitalized since February, and, according to a family statement, died "in the arms of her sisters, Ruth and Anita," and with her brothers Aaron and Fritz "by her side." The statement continues, "Although her sister, Bonnie, was unable to be present, she was with her in spirit."

The singing sisters got their start in San Francisco in the early Seventies as a quartet, sporting a Forties thrift-shop look and a vintage vocal style that incorporated scat and be-bop. The group sang backup for Grace Slick, Boz Scaggs, Taj Mahal and Elvin Bishop, before releasing their self-titled debut in 1973. That album spawned their first Grammy win for the song "Fairytale."

We didn't think so either.  We enjoy the music, and we realize that while
there are at times a division between the clubs and the underground,  we
still like to think that we can support each other in some way.  Obviously
the underground fills in gaps that we legally can't work with (under 21 for
instance) however we dont think that the vibe or the sound should have to
stop once you can walk into a bar or club.  This was what lead to the
forming of NEXUS @ The Endup.

Until today we wern't on this list.  Time being what it is we generally
check the site, the calendar, and such.  Shatter is on Tribe frequently as
well as MySpace, so it was a logical place for him to start looking,
especially with the ability to seperate the DJ's from the fans, if you
will.

Okay... but that's still a strange thing to do. I'm not going to change my

I rememeber 10 years ago when if you didn't put out a direct mailing for an

simply throw and event with one email to a list.  I suspect 10 years from
now the same will be said of email lists and social networking sites.

You are correct.  Blame late night wild ideas and enthusiasm .

Also, I might ask, since we've only known Karina, what is your involvement
with SFRaves?

Also, from the tribe posting: "We're looking for DJ's specifically that SF

That has always been the plan.  When Shatter pictched this he stated in his
own rough manner...

"We should throw a benefit for these guys.  They've been keeping it alive,
especially the site and calendar since Clinton start yamming about wireing
every school in the nation.  I've known Karina forever and a day, and she's
a big sweetie who knows everyone, and can act as a buffer of sorts for us.
We plan it, we do all teh prelim, we promote it, and they can let us know i=
f
the DJ's are up to snuff and have actually been part of teh SF Rave scene."

As I said, Shatter is a bit direct, but that pretty well sums up his entire
pitch.

Thanks for the e-mail trying to clear this all up. I still think this all

New territory is always an adventue!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Clarification of the Benefit @ Endup on May 18th

i think what's causing some of the problems is that some folks know
SFRaves only from the calander, the website and social networking
sites.  on sites such as Tribe, Karina is the main contact.

though, the history of SFR is rooted in the mailing list.  there are
long time members of this community that probably don't even belong to
the SFR tribe on Tribe (and actually there are two SFR tribes) or on
Myspace.

i belong to those groups on Tribe and Myspace.  to me, those aren't a
real community.  the postings, bulletins and listings on those sites
are limited.  rarely updated.  mostly, it's Karina posting up BSPs.=20
nothing wrong with that at all, but i don't think it reflects the SFR
community.

i've been on this list since 1999.  there are people who have been on
the list much longer than that.  i think in some geeky way we all
consider ourselves to be a part of SFRaves and contributing members of
what this community is about.

no single person can represent SFR.  no handfull of people can
represent SFR.  this is a group.

this event and the call for volunteers and DJs was posted off list
before it was posted on-list.  i'm sorry Karina, but saying that it
was buried as an event listing within the calander does not cut it.=20
one, a lot of people here don't read the calander and two, the event
is over a month away so who would actually scroll down to read that
far?

at the very least, it should have been announced here at the same time
as on Tribe, Myspace, etc.

if that had happened, then most of this confusion and resulting
dramarama would have been avoided.

Despite my current situation, and even if by then I *don't* have my vinyl 
(which I am trying desperately to keep), I'll fully help out.

Maybe if things keep going as they are, I'll even break out some old school 
love like you all haven't heard in a long time too...

COUNT ME IN!

I'm up for a day party at somewhere like golden gate park.  Just let me
know, I have some sound equipment along with an 1800watt lightweight honda
generator, and my friend's heavy duty 5500watt genny.  Bam, sane people
never made for a fun party anyways, it's the crazies that make life
interesting!

unfortunately, i do read it.  and i do post.

some threads make me think that our world is going to hell.  if the
next generation of kids are this stupid.....*cry*

did you read the thread where one raver said that people need to be
more "promiscous" when they are outside a venue because the cops might

Ok, seems like a decent amount of people are interested in seeing this part=
y
happen and would also help out. Since bam brought it up, maybe he should
organize a meeting where we can really make this happen.  How many SF Raver=

can we bring out of retirement?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

i'm down to serve as a contact, but i'd really be interested in
getting some old farts onboard.

like the people i used to get into flame wars with back in 2000.  :)

if it's an SFR party, there are a grip of faces that should be
involved and in attendance.

Maybe he meant inconspicuous, cuz if you're validating your promiscuity wit=
h
cops around, you better be inconspicuous!

I remember being around that age.... and kids were just as stupid when I wa=
s
around the same age as they are now.  It just seems there's an imbalance
with more young people going to the all age/18+ parties, as compared to
raves in the mid-late 90's.

>Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

I dunno, but seriously - I am 1 Billion % energized to help out this scene 
in any way I can. You guys have really reinforced all my reasons for moving 
out west over the last couple days.

I think Osby might say...

*Happy HardCore Hugs* to all of you!!!!

Ok, seems like a decent amount of people are interested in seeing this party
happen and would also help out. Since bam brought it up, maybe he should
organize a meeting where we can really make this happen.  How many SF Ravers
can we bring out of retirement?

i'm down to serve as a contact, but i'd really be interested in
getting some old farts onboard.

like the people i used to get into flame wars with back in 2000.  :)

if it's an SFR party, there are a grip of faces that should be
involved and in attendance.

Any ideas on some legit outdoor spots?  I know dirty bird records has been
doing some stuff in GG Park the last couple of years and I don't think

especially through East Bay Reg. Parks.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

we did a small party at GG park last summer and got shut down because
of noise compaints.

the park officer said basically we would have been fine if we'd gotten
a permit that cost something stupid like $25-$50.

it was funnier that while he was talking to us, about 3-4 of us were
smoking cigarettes.  he pointed out that there is also a fine of $100
or so per person smoking.  we all kinda said "oh...."

we didn't get fined.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Clarification of the Benefit @ Endup on May 18th

Clearly, as Alida mentioned, this is a poorly orchestrated event. SFRaves 
has historically thrown its own parties, so to have third parties 
out-of-the-blue come out and announce an SFR event, will certainly call a 
stir. (Not to mention a very similar scenario happened last year)

I'm also not clear on how MySpace and Tribe fits into this. As Bam 
mentioned, both groups have few posts, and very little discussion.

However, this time around it is clear that Karina and the EndUp are 
planning this event as a benefit *to* SFRaves, as opposed to 
*representing* SFRaves. So as long as hyperreal gets a check or this list 
gets to decide which charity proceeds go to, I suppose it's fine.

Just a really weird approach, I think.

      if it's an SFR party, there are a grip of faces that should be

Yeah, that park is 1 mile from my office, *and* it has power! In any case 
I still have a generator at my office we could use.

I would be happy to help secure the park if you guys want to use it =)

I agree though with Bam/Chris/et. al getting the ball rolling on us 
meeting and actually *planning* a party, because imho that's how SFR 
events should be done.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

http://www.parks.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/recpark/Permits_and_Reservati=
ons/special_events.pdf

Long story short - call 415-831-5500 and ask about "special events"

We used to throw daytime evets all the time in parks when I lived in
austin & they were always super fun.  Getting the permit there was
just a formality, but you had to reserve months in advance.

Subject: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

who wants to join forces and actually do a day party this summer that
reflects the community of SFR?

let's bring new heads together with old ones.  kick some asses to get
the crusty fucks off their sofas and into the sunlight.

put a DJ lineup together that reflects the current activity on SFR and
the history of the list.

hello?  anyone?  i think it would be really nice.  i mean, come
on....who on this list is ACTUALLY still throwing parties and going to
parties regularly?  ben haus?

sometimes i feel like i'm the crazy one.  :(

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

I actually asked one of the DB guys about that randomly the other day, he
said they have been just reserving one of the more out of the way spots in
GG for their parties for real cheap, but the last one got big to the point
where they drew too much attention and now they're gettting an official
sound permit or whatever it's called that costs $500.  I'd guess an SFR
party would be small enough to not cause much trouble as long as we didn't
bring ridiculous sound and we didn't pick one of the more trafficed
locations.

I'd also vote for keeping the party in SF if possible, there are a lot of
people like me here that don't have cars, not that I couldn't hitch a ride
but spots in SF are generally easier for everyone to reach.

I personally think a day party should have DAYtime music ie chill, smooth,
and sunshiny, but being that this is SFR I'm sure I'll get shot down on that
one.  ;)

Subject: [sfraves] (SRR) AOL Music... Surprisingly Cool...

Thanks to whoever posted that Dieselboy link to the
AOL Full CD Listen section. I'm surprised that it's
actually a really good selection of music [especially
given the source]. For those who haven't checked the
area out, it's crossplatform now, whereas just a few
months ago I remember going on the site & it basically
said "Go to Hell, Mac user." Old skoolers will
defintely want to check out this week's selections
which features a supremely guilty pleasure Tommy Boy
compilation... Just be careful with it at work,
coworkers will look at you funny when you start to do
the robot in your cubicle...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

before people get too much into what kind of music and who is
playing...IMHO we should figure out the theme of the event.

who do we want to attend?  what kind of vibe are we creating?  what
resources do we have to make this event special?  what's the goal of
the party?

these things are much more important than getting a lineup of DJs.  ;)

Not entirely a bad idea, but I think some funked out stuff would work too - 
just maybe not str8 up banging shit.

Of course, I have played day parties that had both styles, and they seemed 
to go over just as well...

Theme? The weather doesn't suck!

Who? Everyone who wants to come spread some good vibes!

Vibe? FUN!

Goal? TO HAVE FUN!

Chillin & grillin' and spillin' drinks down our throats....what more do u 
need?

before people get too much into what kind of music and who is
playing...IMHO we should figure out the theme of the event.

who do we want to attend?  what kind of vibe are we creating?  what
resources do we have to make this event special?  what's the goal of
the party?

these things are much more important than getting a lineup of DJs.  ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

I'm not a DJ, but do compose and play electronic music, mostly
more like New Age or academic stuff than EDM,   b u t   ...
I could get really stoked about doing live original music for
a chill space at a summer day, full moon, or whatever.

My idea would be to dig up two to four other composers
and organize the sets so we could enjoy the party, too,
maybe do some jamming together.

My use of "chill" = meditative and calm.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

I liked it...good spot for such an event. And there's a section where

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

It's a day party for SFR, we all show up with our friends, listen to music,

Hi,

We are in need of some people to do some basic quality testing in a small
engineering office in Los Gatos (and at home) NEXT week (starting Tuesday).

Requirements:
A little technical knowledge, but not high level.
Basic knowldge of Windows XP.

This is a short term project, but you never know where it could go if you
shine.

  Now.

But there are many people who went from being able have some of this to 
not having a pot to piss in due in most part to the bush agenda.

They're probably not on this list though

Subject: [sfraves] (SRR) AOL Music... Surprisingly Cool...





hello Marc\(O\) and Erin Akamine, yes, it was me!  thanks!  y'all made my
day!  :)

i think aol is cool exposure for edm ... one time i heard drum and bass
coming from my 16-year old daughter's computer and when she left her room
for a minute i snuck in and her computer was on aol.  :)

also i understand aol broadcasts xm radio which is dope - that means we
could hear edm on "the move"/ channel 80.  :)

respect,
mary  :)

          Cool...                                
                                                 

Thanks to whoever posted that Dieselboy link to the
AOL Full CD Listen section. I'm surprised that it's
actually a really good selection of music [especially
given the source]. For those who haven't checked the
area out, it's crossplatform now, whereas just a few
months ago I remember going on the site & it basically
said "Go to Hell, Mac user." Old skoolers will
defintely want to check out this week's selections
which features a supremely guilty pleasure Tommy Boy
compilation... Just be careful with it at work,
coworkers will look at you funny when you start to do
the robot in your cubicle...

As an IT person, I personally LOATHE AOL, but I guess everything has it's 
less than crappy flipside. Can't front on AOL if they push some EDM to 
people who might not ordinarily hear it.

A few years back, the SFRaves 10th (I think) anniversary day party  
was at the McLaren Amphitheater.  I've been to a few others there,  
and I'd have to say that it's easily my favorite day party venue.

Yes, you are both correct in this.

As stated, Endup has a presence on Tribe & MySpace (we havn't ventured onto
others yet).

Traditionally we havn't had any real promotion happening, nor for MANY year=
s
has the club bother to venture out past stock "house" music for a very long
time.

While we didn't make the anncouncement on this list first, we are making it
now.  Anyone who has been a part of SFRaves either in events, DJ'ing events=
,
gotten help with jobs, or feel that they have benefitted from SFRaves is
welcome to contribute.  This idea was never meant to be exclusive to anyone=
,
or to exclude anyone.  All are invited to participate (space and time
willing) and to attend.

Any DJ's that wold like to contribute, place contact
shatter@sonic.netdirectly with the subject line NEXUS  and he will
take in all applicants.
Please include a short summery of why you would like to help out, and what
your involvement in teh past has been.  This is to help weed out people
that, as Van pointed out, would like to just jump in without actually havin=
g
been a part of things.

After the selection has been weeded down, and before we go to print, we wil=
l
post the final candidates here so everyone can take a look at who the line
up will be.  Understand that we cannot please nor accomodate everyone, and
there are at time extinuating circumstances involved, but we wil make the
best possible effort to get in everyone possible.

Keep in mind there are lots of ways to be involved beyond DJing:  Additiona=
l
decorations,  Video Artists (inside and especially outside projected onto
the building itself), vendors (limited space, but it's available on a first
come first served basis)  as well as  fire dancers (if you havn't been to
The Endup, we have a nice space for fire dancers, that makes for amazing
pictures and video), hoola hoops,  and any other talent anyone has to
offer.  All submissions will be considered if possible.

While the event legally must be 21+, we can go to great lengths to make it
very culture friendly.

We're looking forward to this, as we hope all of you are as well.  We again
apologize for ANY mis communications or misrepresentations, as none of them
were intentional, nor did mean mean to offend anyone.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Plaintiffs drop rave lawsuit 

HEIDI TOTH - Daily Herald   

The class action lawsuit against Utah County over last year's rave is dead, for now.

On Monday, attorney Brian Barnard filed a first amended complaint in U.S. District Court, opting to "dismiss without prejudice their action and claims" against Utah County and several of the county's ranking officials, including all three commissioners, Sheriff James Tracy and County Attorney Kay Bryson. It's a strategic move to give them some time to plan, according to one of the plaintiffs.

For the county, though, it's a victory.

The legal hassles aren't over yet, said Peter Stirba, attorney for the county. A judge still has to order the case dismissed, and the county will ask for compensation for its legal fees, which have been significant, especially in light of a lawsuit he termed frivolous.

Brandon Fullmer agreed the case wasn't over; he said all of the involved parties decided they needed to regroup and reorganize their campaign. It is by no means over, he said; they will be refiling once the facts are straightened out.

"It's just kind of dragging out," he said.

The lawsuit was filed in September, a few weeks after the Aug. 20 raid of a CD release party on private property in Spanish Fork Canyon. Promoters Fullmer and Nick Mari and landowners Richard and Trudy Childs alleged various violations of the constitutional rights of partygoers by the sheriff's office, saying excessive force was used to break up the party and that the party was broken up even though UPROCK Records, Fullmer's business, had the correct permits.

The lawsuit also asked for a temporary restraining order that would not allow any more such activities to be broken up until the lawsuit was decided; U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball denied that request in September, citing multiple violations that gave Tracy the right to shut the party down, including drug use and failure to follow through with promised equipment and facilities.

In December, Barnard opened up the possibility of a class action lawsuit and set up a Web site encouraging all partygoers at the Aug. 20 party or an earlier party at the same location that also was broken up to come forward and participate. 

That Web site has Tuesday's date on it and reads, "This site has been taken down as there is no active lawsuit to report on."

Barnard could not be reached for comment.

Yes! That's it! You do get to kill for a hamburger! Sorry, that was terrible. 
Didn't get much sleep last night. No excuse. Sushi for me today. How Metro-Cathol is that?

Sad good Friday everyone! Why should we be happy? shouldn't we be sad today
and happy on Sunday? Sunday is PARTY TIME!!! (ok, well, we'll make it
Saturday!)

BTW- I have to work today and all weekend! Hey but that NSX (my dream for
the last 10+ years) will be worth it and also I think God will be happy
knowing that I can donate more money to the church if I make more money.

Anyway. I don't really believe too much in the whole day or rest thing sinc=
e
the Sun wasn't invented until the 4th day, how can we know how long a day
is? A day could have been millions or billions of years so the sabbith may
mean retirement.

8-p

Just something to think about.

Speaking of heathens, how many of you work on Sundays???
Exodus 35:2 - Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there 
shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever 
doeth work therein shall be put to death.

That's pretty much what I got from the article.  Its really a shame.

I hope they come back strong but it sounds like they were getting worked in 
the court room.  It'd be nice if they nailed those bastards.

Whether answering to Sid LeRock, Gringo Grinder, or Shelbono
"Barracuda" del Monte, this Toronto native now living in Cologne is a
man of wry charm and multiple musical masks.  Under his Pan/Tone
alais, the two time MUTEK veteran takes sweaty minimal techno and
injects gnarling basslines, distorted synths, and a whisky-soaked
party vibe to create his signature "Rockno" sound.  Come see for your
self why the Germans call him "The Craziest Woodsman in Canada!"

________________________________________________


The life and times of the former Sheldon Thompson, aka PAN/TONE:

Native to the northern regions of Ontario where ice fishing and
ski-doos are all the rage, Shelbono LeRoche currently lives in
Cologne, Germany with at least 20 bars in walking distance (the
closest one is where you might suspect to find him.) With over 20
releases, 3 albums in 2004-2005 alone, the man with many faces is
bouncing and crashing his way around the world to bring new breath of
sounds to dancefloors under the alias's of PAN/TONE (sub-static,
sender/kompakt, 240 Volts), SID LeROCK (Ladomat2000, Mute) and GRINGO
GRINDER (Onitor). With a steady output of releases, he has seen one of
his busiest years unfold with great success, coming with the privilege
of seeing many new cities and meeting many like minded individuals.
With more production under way for future releases under all names,
Shelbono has been commited to detoxing himself to better health to
prepare himself again for 2006. The neighbours now find themselves
lucky to be next to a producer preparing for his next album(s) in the
midnight hours.

A warning to the promoters: Please make sure to tell him who he is
performing as in advance...things become a little fuzzy after a few
drinks...make sure to repeat, then send him on his way and all will be
fine...the music and the moment will meet its maker. Music will then
be very LOUD and the boys will be screaming like little girls and the
girls will be dancing all over your nice furniture... piss drunk like
a sailor.... which is exactly what happened at all of the following
clubs and/or festivals:

CANADA: MUTEK festival/montreal, footwork/toronto, element
club/toronto. ENGLAND (UK): london/FABRIC, london/foreign muck.
FRANCE: MUTEK festival/marseille, zoo bizarre/bordeaux,
montpellier/villa rouge, paris/the rex, paris/le pulp. GERMANY:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Plaintiffs drop rave lawsuit

Poor Brandon, he's a good kid :(  I bought plenty of tickets and records
from Uprok once upon a time when I lived in Utah.  Unlike popular belief,
the rave scene in the mid - late 90's was awesome.  Almost no hassling
from cops, everything was in the desert or forest spring through fall, if
a party was shut down there was always alternate venue's lined up. 
They've really cracked down ther since that damn 20/20 episode aired.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFRaves summer day party?

this sounds like it's going to be fun.  i'm a little too far away to  
help but i'll be there in spirit and send a few quotes or something.   
i think the day party in the park fits the sfraves motif very well.

Subject: [sfraves] Barry Manilow likes electronica (from  yesterday's Larry King on
 CNN)

[talking about current artists he appreciates]

Manilow: ... since the art of songwriting seems to have taken a nosedive,
I've gone the way of what they call "electronica music" ... I know it's
kind of odd... it's very bizarre music... but it's kinda... they're
breaking the rules ... and/uh ... they're inventive....  and as a musician
I like that.

King: Electronica??

Manilow: It's called electronica.

King: Is it gimmicky?

Manilow: It's not gimmicky. It's interesting music. Interesting grooves.
Interesting ways of playing music... there's no lyrics... there's hardly
any lyrics.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves."
-Edward R. Murrow

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

I didn't get there until 4:30AM, but it was still going off and I had a
great time - the bacon was a perfect finish...

Was anybody at the Solstice party (I think that's what it was anyway, guess
I took too much!) that night as well?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: The Panda Rejects III - The Monkey At-tax

Ya it was.. 4:30am and still going off, I stayed till 8am.. amazing night.. 
great freakin party!

The upstair hosted 2 more Ernie Travino Sets - that boy is on fire these 
days and can do no wrong, Tung I have never heard but had great tracks, and 
Bella from Florida kicked ass.. plus she's uber hot!  All the DJs were 
great, Alxndrs set was rad, even Rodman who generaly is a little too much on 
the concieous IDM side pulled in some pretty phat beats.  So, a success.. 
and the whole thing got recorded, upstairs and down.. we will have to see if 
they release any of it.. although they were selling cd's so probably not.  
Great idea selling compillation cd's from all the dj's at the party. Bout 
time our local kidz make some recording dollars.

Alright people, i want to know who on this list aint too old to go to a
fucking metal concert?

July 17th at San Jose's HP Pavilon, will be presenting the Unholy Alliance
Tour Featuring...

Lamb of God
Mastadon
Thine Eyes Bleed...

and.....

and..........


FUCKING SLAYER!!!!!!

and some more, but it's all about SLAYER!!!!

I know there are some of you out there that don't always listen to this
electronic dancey crap ;-)

I just picked up my ticket form TicketMaster, and I want to see who else
will be either going, or at least entertaining some thought into going to
this show.

Slayer is one of the bands i havent seen yet, and i have to catch them, as
they put on a good show (so I hear).

I got my tickets through TicketMaster, and will all the fees and lameness i=
t
came out to be like $53.  A bit more then i really like to pay, but i got
the money right now and i need to get my ass to an actual concert for a
change and let out some serious aggression and stress down in the pit.

Hey peeples,

We have an open position for a purchasing/accounting/tech specialist. It ha=
s
the potential of being permanent.

If anyone is interested, please shoot me a copy of your resume.

Your employer would be one of America's biggest telecom companies. It's a
great office located 2 minutes from the Montgomery BART/Muni station.

We are looking for someone that is *extremely* intelligent... this is a ver=
y
demanding position and the applicant must be willing to go the extra mile.
Must be detail-oriented, fast, have a good listening ear and the ability to
put up with some high-strung people (hey, I'm being honest!). The upside is
that the pay is great, and you would be trained by yours truly! Our
department (infrastructure services) is really fun and we take lots of snac=
k
breaks while getting the job done AT THE SAME TIME!

You want this job.

Thanks,
Tala

Friday, April 21st 
Massive Selector, Club 6,
& The Poleng Lounge present
The Summit

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away…

there was a monthly party which crisscrossed all musical genres, showcasing a wide array of talent like Jazzy Jeff, Spinna, Hyper, & Jazzanova (to name a few). From hip hop to house, broken beat to nu-jazz, dancehall to lovers rock, turntablism to live music, this genre-less party celebrated musical diversity for more than three years.

After a 2 year hiatus, Massive Selector and friends return to the newly renovated Club Six reviving this legendary party. On April 21, The Summit resumes its quest to bridge the musical gap with a worldwide eclectic lineup featuring…

The King Britt Experience
(with a 4 piece band)
DJ Muro of Japan
45 King (45King.com)
Haul and Mason (Quality SF/LA)

Alongside with
PantyROBber (Massive Selector)
Proof (Massive Selector)
Malex (Massive Selector)
KingMost & DJ Kero One (Plug Label)
Big Taka (FTC/Reflections)

About King Britt
Rarely will you find a talent whose vision supersedes the boundaries of genre, until you have met King Britt. This Philadelphia native has found a way to escape the boundaries of a single category of music by expressing his creations through deep house, hip-hop, broken beat, nu-jazz, funk and afro-tech.

As a member of Digable Planets and as an artist on San Francisco’s own OM Records label, and having worked with artists such as Questlove from the Roots, Ursula Rucker, Macy Gray, Femi Kuti, and others, King Britt's new style fuses influences from various music genres and comes full circle with a LIVE interpretation of all that he has experienced..

About DJ Muro
A former disciple of DJ Krush. Muro the “King of Diggin” is considered one of Japan’s hip hop royalty. As a Pioneer of Japanese hip hop culture, Muro has produced countless tracks and remixes for such labels as Blue Note, Tommy Boy and Def Jam and has worked with several artist including Lord Finesse and A.G.

About 45 King. (from One Stop Hip Hip)
If you don’t know 45 King, then you don’t know Queen Latifah, DJ Kool, Jay Z, or Eminem. This super-producer has been creating hits since the late 80’s. Most DJs world wide have at least one copy of the classic break beat “900 Number” which was first produced in 1987 and later revisited in DJ Kool’s hit “Let me Clear my Throat”.
45 King blew up in an even bigger way in 1998. Hooking up with Jay-Z, the 45 King produced what was to be the biggest rap song of the summer: "It's a Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)." In 2000, he produced the platinum track "Stan" for Eminem, solidifying his reputation as a top-notch beatmaker. Learn more at 45king.com

About Haul & Mason
Los Angeles based DJ/Producers Haul and Mason are firmly establishing themselves as the party-rocking DJ duo to watch in the coming years. Known for their infamous "2x4 sets," the two So-Cal residents have producing original tracks, playing live with bands, and blowing up dance floors all around the world. Haul & Mason will also re-launch Quality SF @ the Poleng Lounge every 1st Friday of the Month.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

We got there around 3:00, some of the first bunnies to arrive. I was a pink, furry bunny, my friend was a blue, sexy bunny. We cracked up at the looks on the faces of the people who didn't realize what was going on, saying 'um, where are all these bunnies coming from?' Pretty surreal if you're just suddenly surrounded by bunnies,  all starting to pack the joint by the time we left at 5:00. We had a great time and I absolutely danced my ass off. 
   
  I really, really loved what was being played downstairs (must've been Aaron Jae?) and I'm only sorry I missed Bam's set, as I heard it was incredible. My only regret is that I didn't bring something else to wear, as dancing in fur pants drains you pretty fast. Big thank you to the crew for such a well-run, friendly and fun way to finish up our night. 
   
  Namaste, MK

Was anybody at the Solstice party (I think that's what it was anyway, guess
I took too much!) that night as well?

So Saturday night was very cool. It was my first "candy rave" and boy was i=
t
different then normal undergrounds and the club scene. High School kids
everywhere. Very few jaded old-timers. The chill room was going off. Even a=
t
9pm the whole room was melted out. Geeze, these kids start early. I loved
playing my set and it was VERY cool and a personal dream of mine to see my
music make people go nuts. Too bad I had to play straight from my laptop
because someone forgot to bring the CDJ's and my laptop crashed during my
set.

Highlights of the night:
1. A last minute song that I made for the party seemed to get the best
reaction (which suprised me because I had spent so little time on it)
2. Phillip playing his whole set across the room sitting on a bean bag with
his laptop.
3. The old-school style ballons
4. Eesaid's Birthday
5. Osby's fruit
6. Calamity busting out a kick ass set and being a cool person to talk to.
7. The 1 toilet that was overflowed with no toilet paper.

cheese factor aside, barry manilow is quite the musician..  he was a  
guest on the jimmy kimmel show about a year ago, and after watching  
that, i had a new respect for him.  he's intelligent, funny, knows  
his music (i mean, it's his life and livelihood), and can really work  
a crowd.  i'd be interested to hear any electronic releases he comes  
up with.  i bet he'd do something salsa/disco/housey... and that  
you'd LOVE it.

and think about this - in 20 years, your kids will probably think the  
music you made/played/danced to was cheesy...

Barry Manilow is a sick producer/musician. I don't much care for his work, 
but his skills are undeniable.

Must be a Barry thing - Barry White was an amazing musician too. He arranged 
EVERY SINGLE INSTRUMENT in all his work. A composer/artist - very cool. The 
non-white Danny Elfman if you will, hehe.

I've used Psudophed this time of year ever since I was a kid. I get really
bad allergy sinus headaches. The only thing that gets rid of the headaches
and pressure is Psudophed and pure ephedrine. Benadryl and other allergy
medicine puts me to sleep and the new psudophed replacement doesn't do shit=
.
So I have to take psudophed. The problem is, I'm treated like a criminal
when I want to go buy it.  I have to show my ID and if the pharmacy is
closed I'm stuck with the headache. Why should I be persecuted because some
people out there use psudophed to make meth? I have no intention to make
meth and have absolutely zero desire to try it. I just want easy access to
psudophed so I can get rid of my headaches.

Can't do that either, They swipe your ID every time you buy it so some
computer somewhere is keeping track of how much I buy. Also, Kaiser stopped
carrying the generic psudoephedrine caving in to the ignorance. This fuckin=

sucks.

Oh, Philip, I tried cutting out milk, that helps a little.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Barry Manilow likes electronica (from yesterday's Larry King on CNN)

I saw Barry on American Idol a few weeks back, and though I don't really dig his schtick, I was sort of impressed by him.  He really brought out the best in all the contestants regardless of the style they chose or their relative vocal talents.  Bringing out the best in a wide variety of people is a unique and special talent IMO. Its pretty rare to find someone that can do this.  YMMV. FWIW. etc.

 Peter

  Ok, sounds like I'm going to have to take a trip to Rasputins in fremont and pick up some .25 cent records on Barry and research his music.

Look for Actifed & Sudafed @ corner stores/liqour shops where it's still on the shelf. You pay a little more, but I've never been carded @ Scott's for some alergy medicine. Flea market if you want to go hardcore. I've heard laying off the dairy helps too, but don't know much about why. Google it.
   
  Hope ya feel better,

Well... I too have run into the pseudophedrine
problem...

BUT...

I just attended a funeral in kansas. Driving down the
highway you see anhydrous ammonia depots all over the
place... which is one of the main ingredients in meth
manufacturing...

So, in addition to being called a left-coaster more
than once... a drunk farmer at "Country Karaoke" told
me that he sells propane tanks of anhydrous to people
when he trucks in the winter for $4000 a tank...

So it isn't us thats causing the problem. We are just
having to suffer the results of the good-ole "Real
American Values" states that make sure we have a
war-monger as president.

Additionally.... becasue of the new us laws against
meth pre-cursers... Mexico is hot on the manufacture.
I recently read an article about how a mexican pharma
company was producing 20% less medication from their
pseudophedrine supply than they were taking in....
meaning the rest was used to produce illicit
substances.

Our government has turned into a bunch of retards that
only make decisions that make the news, and usually on
the heals of a news story itself... What happened to
the idea that you legislate to set up laws that work
for hundreds of years, like the constitution, rather
than pass ridiculous laws that only infringe on the
civil liberties of us regular folks?

  Does anybody know if these things work around here?  Chuck
  http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/04/18/traffic.changer.ap/index.html  No green light for driver with traffic signal gadget  'That thing paid for itself'   
  LONGMONT, Colorado (AP) -- A man who said he bought a device that allowed him to change stop lights from red to green received a $50 ticket for suspicion of interfering with a traffic signal.
  Jason Niccum of Longmont, Colorado, said the device, which he bought on eBay for $100, helped him cut his time driving to work.
  "I guess in the two years I had it, that thing paid for itself," he told the Daily Times-Call on Wednesday.
  Niccum was issued a citation March 29 after police said they found him using a strobe-like device to change traffic signals. Police confiscated the device.
  "I'm always running late," police quoted Niccum as saying in an incident report.
  The device, called an Opticon, is similar to what firefighters use to change lights when they respond to emergencies. It emits an infrared pulse that receivers on the traffic lights pick up.
  Niccum was cited after city traffic engineers who noticed repeated traffic light disruptions at certain intersections spotted a white Ford pickup passing by whenever the patterns were disrupted.
  City traffic engineer Joe Olson said engineers plan to update the city's Opticon system this year to block unauthorized light-changing signals.

  http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/04/18/traffic.changer.ap/index.html  No green light for driver with traffic signal gadget  'That thing paid for itself'   
  LONGMONT, Colorado (AP) -- A man who said he bought a device that allowed him to change stop lights from red to green received a $50 ticket for suspicion of interfering with a traffic signal.
  Jason Niccum of Longmont, Colorado, said the device, which he bought on eBay for $100, helped him cut his time driving to work.
  "I guess in the two years I had it, that thing paid for itself," he told the Daily Times-Call on Wednesday.
  Niccum was issued a citation March 29 after police said they found him using a strobe-like device to change traffic signals. Police confiscated the device.
  "I'm always running late," police quoted Niccum as saying in an incident report.
  The device, called an Opticon, is similar to what firefighters use to change lights when they respond to emergencies. It emits an infrared pulse that receivers on the traffic lights pick up.
  Niccum was cited after city traffic engineers who noticed repeated traffic light disruptions at certain intersections spotted a white Ford pickup passing by whenever the patterns were disrupted.
  City traffic engineer Joe Olson said engineers plan to update the city's Opticon system this year to block unauthorized light-changing signals.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr:  Room avail...

Hey everyone...
I have a very sunny room available on the island (treasure island)
It is a medium sized room (12x12-ish) I am located on yerba buena isle, 
which is the "real" island that the bay bridge goes thru...There are amazing 
views just steps from the front door, neighbors are awesome and quiet at 
appropriate times, I think I am pretty swell too :)
Benefits and goodies:
300$ deposit
washer and dryer
dishwasher
no utilities
cool artsie housemate (me)
lots of trees
tons of storage
cleanning lady on the way...
there is a cafe, store on treasure as well as muni that runs to the transbay 
terminal 24/7
It helps if you have a car. I do not and I get around fine.
A little about me:
I am 27 years old, homo, fun, meditating, laid back. I work at SupperClub at 
night and durring the day as a loan officer with a mortgage firm in SF, 
needless to say I am pretty busy these days. I love life and accept most of 
its challenges. Certified reiki master, dj, artist, cancerian. I love to 
garden and name my plants stupid names. 420 friendly although I don't really 
smoke.
I party every now and then and get off work late on the weekends.
I am looking for someone really chill, fun, sweet, not an energy leach. 
Someone responsible and happy-go-lucky who smiles a lot would be a great 
match.
Please say hello if you are interested in checking it out.
Thanks and blessings,
Danny

Try buying online-- Like from drugstore.com. No cranky housewives  
with screaming kids, no belligerent old people, no mouth-breathing  
high school dropout cashiers. I haven't set foot in a drugstore in  
years.

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for people interested in helping out...

Hey everybody,

We at Stilldream are in the process of gettin ready for our big 6 year 
anniversary campout (June 16, 17 and 18th) and are looking at making it 
better then ever.  Unfortunatly we are having a hard time contacting some of 
our friends who helped out last year and I have decided to put out a request 
for anybody interested in helping out this year.  We are looking for anybody 
who has talents or knowledge with the following subjects.

- Massage Therapist / Aroma Therapy: To set up a massage booth area, where 
people can go in and get a nice massage and rest and relax.

- Glass Blowers: Last year we had Dr. Smile set up a Glass blowing area 
where he spent most of the night blowing beautiful pipes and other objects, 
unfortunatly we just can't get a hold of him.  It was such an awesome part 
of the campout I would hate to not see something of the like out there 
again. :(

- Guided Meditation / Visualization: Something new I'd like to add to the 
campout.  Would love to add maybe 2 times a day a guided meditation 
somewhere around sunset and sunrise. 3 total for the weekend (Saturday 
Morning, Saturday Evening, and Sunday Morning.

Its always hard to find good help so please only respond if you are truely 
interested. If you know somebody who has experience with one or more of the 
talents listed above and would be interested in helping out please forward 
this on to them too.

For more info or questions please email me (Paul) at gamma@techno-truth.com

Thank you for your time.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Robbie Hardkiss, this friday

ROBBIE HARDKISS
With his brothers Scott Hardkiss and Gavin Hardkiss, Robbie Hardkiss
is a central figure in the infamous Hardkiss family of DJs and
musicians. Working in their hometown of San Francisco, the Hardkiss
brothers were instrumental in developing the U.S. rave and outdoor
party scene in the early '90s. Pioneering Hardkiss tunes such as "3
Nudes In A Purple Garden" and "Rainery" helped define the psychedelic
West Coast breakbeat sound that continues to grow today. Their
legendary status within the realm of electronic music was immortalized
with the release of their double album, Delusions of Grandeur.

Since then, Robbie Hardkiss has gone on to remix songs (with and
without his brothers) for artists such as Elton John, Freestylers,
Spacetime Continuum, The Grid, Lords of Acid, The Sandals, Q-Burn, God
Within (aka Scott Hardkiss), and Hawke.

Scott, Gavin and Robbie, the Hardkiss brothers, ruled the underground
San Francisco club scene during the 1990s with a mixture of acid,
trance and breakbeat techno. World-class DJs all, the brothers also
run their own Hardkiss label, releasing material as themselves plus
myriad other artists, including Rabbit in the Moon and Scott's God
Within project. It was Scott and Gavin who formed the group in the
early '90s after experiencing Britain's 1989 Summer of Love firsthand
while studying in Europe. Returning to the States, the two began
promoting and organizing massive raves on the East Coast, but later
moved out to San Francisco to share the vibe with the West as well.
Hooking up with old friend Robbie and christening themselves Hardkiss,
the trio began recording material for their eponymous label. Though
few releases appeared on anything other than vinyl, the label
compilation Delusions of Grandeur serves as a good primer to the
Hardkiss sound. Scott, Robbie and Gavin have each released
compilations detailing their mixing skills as well. ~ John Bush, All

Subject: [sfraves] Marc Ecko Tags Air Force One

I got this from boing/boing yesterday.

http://www.stillfree.com/

It's on the left.

It's a total fake of Air Force One getting tagged by Marc Ecko but man
it looks legit and ballsy as hell.

Gives Borf a run for his money.

it was a blur, but i remember grabbing some fruit from you in the mini
chill room, that first room to the left of the entrance hallway. i
thought it was a great idea. i was telling my friends the next day,
"this guy had a tray of fresh fruit!" i like giving stuff away too,
but now i'm thinking of what else i could bring. thanks again. do you
know why it got broken up at 2am? i thought it was permitted.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Soma-Tech (4.22) and The End Up (5.4)

Greets,

Well, first off I would like to thank everyone that made it out to the EGR 
8 year at the beginning of April. That was quite an event with a diverse 
crowd, so I was very happy. The out of town guests were excited as well and 
all of us got a chance to hang out and communicate about the state of 
techno in the US and world wide.  I plan on finally getting the EGR 8 year 
mix out this weekend..

Now to the upcoming events...

Soma-Tech  Sat April 22nd by Natural Productions / Good Bad Guy

To my knowledge this is a relatively new crew around here hosting a free 
techno event. I understand the sound system is large and things will be 
bumping from 9pm to 4am at an underground downtown SF location.  Email 
soma-tech@hotmail.com for directions and more info.

Lineup:
Blithe - House (805, LA)
Lorax - Minimal (Good Bad Guy, Mexico)
Catharsis - Industrial-Techno (EGR Records, SF)
Christian Fuller - Techno (Natural Productions, Holland)
Snoek - Techno (Good Bad Guy, Holland)


Also... On Thursday May 4th EGR Records hits The End Up in SF.
DJ Dice (Straylight/JSA)
Catharsis (EGR)
Majere (Elektrosorcery)
http://www.theendup.com/

I'm on from midnight to 2am and plan to bring as much dark techno out as I 
can get the dance floor to handle...

Hope to see you guys out...

Best,
--Mike

A Very Special 4-20 Mellow Beats and Boardgames with Tycho (Merck)

---------------------------------------------------------

Tycho is song writer / producer Scott Hansen. After a string of  
underground offerings, Tycho's first widely available work was  
released: 2002's "The Science of Patterns". A 4 track EP, this early  
work laid the foundations for Tycho's now signature sound. In the  
year that followed, Tycho, along with Chachi Jones, Dusty Brown,  
Fruitbat, and Park Avenue formed the Command Collective, a group of  
musicians and visual artists who defined the electronic music scene  
of Sacramento, CA in the early 2000's.

After a year of experimentation and studio reconfigurations, Tycho  
set to work on a full length release to follow up the Science of  
Patterns EP. The result was 2004's "Sunrise Projector", Tycho's first  
full-length offering. The 13 tracks of Sunrise Projector further  
defined Tycho's continuously evolving sound, garnering praise from  
critics and fans alike.

2006 finds Tycho at work on two full length releases, one for Miami- 
based Merck Records and another for Quebec's Cyclop Media label.

A discussion on our Parenting Advice and Support
Forum<http://forums.about.com/ab-parentteens/messages/?%20msg=3D3271.1&lgnF=
=3Dy>,
had this Guide in puzzlement. I had reported years ago that the term
420(pronounced four twenty, not four hundred and twenty), was police code
for smoking marijuana in a feature on pager codes that teenagers use to
"talk" to each other. I began researching the number again and it seems I
was wrong. Read on to learn the myths, the truth about the origin and what
this term means for parents.

*Known Myths*


   - *Police dispatch code for smoking pot is 420. * The number 420 is
   not police radio code for anything, anywhere. Checks of criminal codes
   suggest that the origin is neither Californian nor federal. For instance=
,
   California Penal Code 420 defines as a misdemeanor the hindrance of use =
of
   public lands.
   - *There are approximately 420 active chemicals in marijuana.
*Actually, there are approximately 315 active chemicals in marijuana.
This
   number goes up and down depending on which plant is used.
   - *April 20th is National Pot Smokers Day. * Well, it is now; but that
   wasn't the origin.
   - *April 20th is Hitler's birthday. * Yes, it is his birthday. But, as

*The Origin Revealed*

According to Steven Hager, editor of High Times, the term 420 originated at
San Rafael High School, in 1971, among a group of about a dozen pot-smoking
wiseacres who called themselves the Waldos, who are now pushing 50. The ter=
m
was shorthand for the time of day the group would meet, at the campus statu=
e
of Louis Pasteur, to smoke pot. Intent on developing their own discreet
language, they made 420 code for a time to get high, and its use spread
among members of an entire generation. While our teens feel that they know
something we don't, you can let them in on the fact that it was your
generation that came up with the numbers.

A quote from one of the Waldos in the High Times article states, "We did
discover we could talk about getting high in front of our parents without
them knowing by using the phrase 420." Fortunately, your teenagers will not
have that same option.

*Whatever! *
Simply put, 420 is a symbol of cannabis and its culture. Today, April 20th
events are international, and 4:20 pm has become sort of a world wide "burn
time". It certainly doesn't matter too much where the term came from becaus=
e
for us parents, it's a flag, a warning sign that our teenagers may be into
something that could harm their future. When you see the symbol 420, be
aware of what it represents.

had this Guide in puzzlement. I had reported years ago that the term
420(pronounced four twenty, not four hundred and twenty), was police code
for smoking marijuana in a feature on pager codes that teenagers use to
"talk" to each other. I began researching the number again and it seems I
was wrong. Read on to learn the myths, the truth about the origin and what
this term means for parents.

*Known Myths*


   - *Police dispatch code for smoking pot is 420. * The number 420 is
   not police radio code for anything, anywhere. Checks of criminal codes
   suggest that the origin is neither Californian nor federal. For instance,
   California Penal Code 420 defines as a misdemeanor the hindrance of use
of
   public lands.
   - *There are approximately 420 active chemicals in marijuana.
*Actually, there are approximately 315 active chemicals in marijuana.
This
   number goes up and down depending on which plant is used.
   - *April 20th is National Pot Smokers Day. * Well, it is now; but that
   wasn't the origin.
   - *April 20th is Hitler's birthday. * Yes, it is his birthday. But, as
   420 started out as a time, not a date, his birthday had nothing to do
with
   it.
   - * April 20th is the date of the Columbine school shootings. * This
   happened after the term was already in use.
   - * 4:20 is tea time for pot-smokers in Holland. * Tea time in Holland
   is at 5:30 pm, or is it 2:30 pm? Seems no one is quite sure when the
   wonderful people of Holland drink their tea.

oh.

would you mind elaborating on that a little?  just curious.  if you  
really want to know, i don't really trust any of these people from  
the media.  i think if you want to find the truth, you've got to  
really dig deep.  and no, i don't consider listening to alex jones,  
or will's favorite, michael savage, to be digging deep.  both of them  
work in commercial radio, which makes them suspect.  on the other  
hand, National Petroleum Radio has sponsors too.

anyway, back to my red bull & vodka.  yum!

ICQ is a messenger client like yahoo, msn or aim.  it was started by 
Mirabilis, which has since been bought by AOL.  The letters aren't an 
acronym, but a homonym - "I seek you".  The id's are uniquie numbers, 
like a serial number.  The number of digits indicates how old the 
account is.  For example:  my first beta number was four digits long, 
my first real one was five, and the current one I use has 6.

Dance Music Then and Now, From Tom Moulton and Unai 

By <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/kelefa_sanneh/index.html?inline=nyt-per>KELEFA SANNEH

Early in the 1970's, Tom Moulton found a way to defy the laws of mathematics: he made songs longer by a process of subtraction. By stretching out the emptiest parts of his favorite records ­ the rhythmic breaks, where verses and choruses gave way to beats and grooves ­ he helped turn R&B hits like "Do It ('Til You're Satisfied)" into disco classics. His hugely influential mixes are collected on a great new double-CD compilation called "A Tom Moulton Mix" (Soul Jazz); in it, you can hear the birth of modern dance music.

Dance-music producers have been subtracting ever since, finding out that less music can often move dancers more. You can hear decades' worth of subtracting when you play "A Love Moderne" (Forcetracks), a skeletal but surprisingly seductive new CD by the Swedish producer known as Unai. It's an early contender for electronic-music album of the year, and it makes Mr. Moulton's work sound positively baroque.

In 1974, Mr. Moulton did something that would soon become commonplace: he made a mix. He spent 80 hours turning some club-friendly records into a 45-minute reel-to-reel tape, which eventually became a hit at the Sandpiper, a center of Fire Island's night life. He took the same principle ­ keep the beat going so the dancers keep dancing ­ into the recording studio, and made a series of danceable remixes and re-edits.

His discovery seems obvious now: he realized that the thumping, dance-floor-friendly soul records of the early 70's would sound that much better, and thumpinger, if he made them longer. (Apparently brevity isn't the soul of soul.) He can claim to have invented the 12-inch single, although he stumbled upon the format by mistake: an engineer had run out of 7-inch vinyl. 

"A Tom Moulton Mix" gathers 16 tracks, starting with "Keep On Truckin' (Part 1)," the 1973 hit by Eddie Kendricks, the former Temptation. The song lasts eight minutes on Kendricks's self-titled album; a radio edit whittled it down to three and a half. But Mr. Moulton went in the other direction: the version here lasts more than 11 minutes, and if anything it ends too soon. When that glorious beat ­ thundering drums, squelchy guitar, a string section darting in and out ­ finally gives way to the timpani heartbeat that serves as a coda, you may be expecting, or even hoping, that the song will come roaring back to life one more time.

Many of his mixes seem relatively unobtrusive, especially compared with the radical disco producers who emerged in the mid-70's. Walter Gibbons and Shep Pettibone, for example, took Mr. Moulton's approach further: they loved to turn songs into wild, weird, drum-driven experiments. But part of the joy in this compilation is the gentleness of Mr. Moulton's approach; he's invisible, unless you're paying attention. Whether he's toying with B.T. Express's "Peace Pipe" or extending the sublime novelty hit "Moonboots," by Orlando Riva Sound, Mr. Moulton makes mixes that hint at what came before and what would come after. You can hear soul songs morphing into machine music.

In the 70's, "disco" evolved from a place into a genre, and in the 80's, house and techno producers focused even more intently on rhythm tracks. It sometimes seems that dance-music producers are doing their best to finish what Mr. Moulton and others started: stripping away the songs until almost nothing's left.

Maybe the job is just about done. Certainly, some of the best electronic dance music these days is also some of the sparsest. In Germany and elsewhere, producers and D.J.'s have figured out ways to evoke disco's propulsion by using little more than hums and clicks and snippets and squiggles. It's just an extension of the Moulton doctrine: a relatively simple track, slowly mutating over 5 or 10 or even (in an age of CD's and laptops) 30 minutes, can drive dancers crazy.

Erik Moller, the Swede who records as Unai, is often counted as one of the minimalists; he's known for subtle, twitchy tracks that occasionally hint at dub reggae. "A Love Moderne," his second full-length CD, is to be released in America next month, and it's a slight departure. There are more melodies, more singing (his own), more songs. His fans will probably claim that this is his pop album, but beware: Unai fans probably have a different definition of pop than you do. (That's why they're Unai fans.) 

Make no mistake: this is ghostly, sometimes eerie music. Mr. Moller is clearly still obsessed with subtle electronic textures and smudgy bass lines that could almost be computer glitches. And yet he has filled this album with strong, melancholy melodies, and unlike most of his contemporaries, he doesn't embarrass himself when he tries to sing. He often hides behind electronic filters; it's as if he recorded his voice and then erased it, leaving only a trace behind. 

One track, "Heart Is to the Left," is about as close as Unai gets to a swaggering disco track. There's a sharp, unrelenting beat and an old-fashioned love lyric: "Truly I believe in you," he sings, although his voice soon disappears into the mix. And in "Modern Love," the music transforms itself through sudden cuts and gradual fades; it's a woozy composition made of gauzy synthesizers, wobbly beats, muscular bass lines, half-decayed backing vocals.

There's something pleasantly perverse about what Mr. Moller is doing: after years of making skeletal dance music, he's adding flesh to the bones he so carefully stripped. But not too much ­ the whole trick, in fact, is to make these skinny songs sound fleshier than they are. Whether they mean to or not, producers like him are heading back toward the disco mixes of the 1970's, only from the other side. Once it was a thrill to hear pop songs turning into electronic tracks. But it can be just as much fun to hear the process in reverse.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What does 420 mean?

Only if you choose to be Ben. 
 
 I remember a couple of years ago my current wife and I had dinner with my ex-girlfriend from college and her husband.  They live in a nice suburban house in Thousand Oaks California where I had visited her a few months earlier.  She was going on about how the city was much "dirtier" than she remembered it.  She used to live in the city back in the early eighties and I grew up in the area, and went to high school over in the Haight (Urban School).  I was pretty amazed to hear this, because my recollection of the Haight and Mission (where we were having dinner at a fancy restaraunt) from those times was that they used to be much dirtier, there was more crime, and no nice shops or restaraunts at all.  The conversation went on with her complaining about the "weirdos" and so forth.
 
 When she lived in the city she was one of those weirdos.  She lived near union street and we used to frequently walk through the tenderloin when were going out drinking.  It hasn't changed much, it was full of addicts, and transvestite hookers, and so forth.  We fit in.  I don't recall the name of the bar we used to stop at in the tenderloin on our way over to North Beach, but it was way shadier than any place I frequent these days.
 
 I guess she didn't want her husband to think she had been one of those weirdos back in the day.  He seemed like a nice guy and I doubt he would have divorced her if he had known she was a bisexual pot smoking leather wearing bar crawler 20+ years ago.  But once you start caring about what people will think, you have to start conforming your history to their beliefs too.  If you do this long enough, you'll not only forget what it was really like back in the day but possibly even who you really were/are.
 
 Personally I still have the leather jacket I used to war back then even if it doesn't fit quite as well as it used to.
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter

ha....  I find I'm just getting cranky as I get older; less patience 
with stupid crap.   But being judgmental?
I was on the tail end of that too much....

as for dirty, SF is a damn dirty city.    Vancouver is soooo clean (I 
was there for a year)  Even London
seems cleaner, even in the rotten parts where they throw warehouse 
parties.  Some trash, but my memory of SF implies there's more there.

don't think there's anyway I could survive anywhere in northern europe or
canada.

I actually love SF for all the freaky weather and cool temperatures. A place 
like Vancouver is ideal to a feller like me.

Now if only I could find a nice Canuck girl to marry me so I could move 
there and get the fuck out of the USA

Just kindsa wanted to give you all an update on my situation since so =
many people really jumped to help me last week when my life went to =
doodoo...

1st off - before I get into it, let me once again sincerely thank you =
all for the help you either supplied and/or offered. It is so sincerely =
appreciated, I honestly can't express how thankful I am.=20

So anyway - I wish I could say my situation has improved. Sadly, if =
anything it's worse at this point. There's way too much that's happened =
for me to go into detail - but suffice it to say, despite me getting =
rent paid and my cell bill decreased to next to nothing (thank you SO =
much Tala), the majority of my debtors are sending me to collections, =
and have PURPOSEFULLY sent through debit attempts to my bank, knowing =
full well there was no money to retrieve. One company literally did it =
on purpose so they could charge me and extra late fee, return payment =
fee, and rack up another 2 NSF fees in my bank account. My bank =
basically said "tough titty" to me when I begged for assistance. I guess =
since they're cleaning house with me on NSF fees, they could care less.=20

On top of all this shit, our servers have been down at work, and the =
people running them are so freaking incompetent, they couldn't migrate =
any of the info on the servers to the right spots, and my work week has =
been a hell of financial planners, securities agents and insurance =
agents freaking out and cancelling service w/ my company. PLUS, our =
company decided to drop our 100% paid PPO insurance plan, to get an 80% =
paid HMO plan - so an extra $100 gets axed from my paychecks each month =
unless I decide to just go without insurance. $100 I already don't have. =
*sigh*

So...I unfortunately have to sell off more records. I'm not dipping into =
the prized stash yet, but it's not far off at this point...I'll most =
likely post a list of stuff for sale later today or this weekend, so if =
ANY OF YOU see records you want on the list, PLEASE contact me ASAP. =
I'll do the best deals I can, but please don't haggle with me...

Bla bla bla....enough about my crappy life. I'm gonna try and transcend =
it all tonight and drop a banging set at 1015. It'd make my week if I =
saw a ton of you folks out there tonight, plus, you'll be supporting =
something new and exciting me and my transplant friends from the other =
coast want to push out here.=20

I go on from 12 to 1 right before Robbie Hardkiss....if you care to =
share in the moment.

(and Bam goes on right at 10pm, so get there early and support him too!)

~Marco

p.s. sorry for the "woe is me" post, I know most people don't wanna hear =
this shit - but I also didn't want you folks to get the idea that I =
forgot about your good will, it means the world to me.

The Summit

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away…

there was a monthly party which crisscrossed all musical genres, showcasing a wide array of talent like Jazzy Jeff, Spinna, Hyper, & Jazzanova (to name a few). From hip hop to house, broken beat to nu-jazz, dancehall to lovers rock, turntablism to live music, this genre-less party celebrated musical diversity for more than three years.

After a 2 year hiatus, Massive Selector and friends return to the newly renovated Club Six reviving this legendary party. On April 21, The Summit resumes its quest to bridge the musical gap with a worldwide eclectic lineup featuring…

The King Britt Experience
(with a 4 piece band)
DJ Muro of Japan
45 King (45King.com)
Haul and Mason (Quality SF/LA)

Alongside with
PantyROBber (Massive Selector)
Proof (Massive Selector)
Malex (Massive Selector)
KingMost & DJ Kero One (Plug Label)
Big Taka (FTC/Reflections)

About King Britt
Rarely will you find a talent whose vision supersedes the boundaries of genre, until you have met King Britt. This Philadelphia native has found a way to escape the boundaries of a single category of music by expressing his creations through deep house, hip-hop, broken beat, nu-jazz, funk and afro-tech.

As a member of Digable Planets and as an artist on San Francisco’s own OM Records label, and having worked with artists such as Questlove from the Roots, Ursula Rucker, Macy Gray, Femi Kuti, and others, King Britt's new style fuses influences from various music genres and comes full circle with a LIVE interpretation of all that he has experienced..

About DJ Muro
A former disciple of DJ Krush. Muro the “King of Diggin” is considered one of Japan’s hip hop royalty. As a Pioneer of Japanese hip hop culture, Muro has produced countless tracks and remixes for such labels as Blue Note, Tommy Boy and Def Jam and has worked with several artist including Lord Finesse and A.G.

About 45 King. (from One Stop Hip Hip)
If you don’t know 45 King, then you don’t know Queen Latifah, DJ Kool, Jay Z, or Eminem. This super-producer has been creating hits since the late 80’s. Most DJs world wide have at least one copy of the classic break beat “900 Number” which was first produced in 1987 and later revisited in DJ Kool’s hit “Let me Clear my Throat”.
45 King blew up in an even bigger way in 1998. Hooking up with Jay-Z, the 45 King produced what was to be the biggest rap song of the summer: "It's a Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)." In 2000, he produced the platinum track "Stan" for Eminem, solidifying his reputation as a top-notch beatmaker. Learn more at 45king.com

About Haul & Mason
Los Angeles based DJ/Producers Haul and Mason are firmly establishing themselves as the party-rocking DJ duo to watch in the coming years. Known for their infamous "2x4 sets," the two So-Cal residents have producing original tracks, playing live with bands, and blowing up dance floors all around the world. Haul & Mason will also re-launch Quality SF @ the Poleng Lounge every 1st Friday of the Month.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

The Rapture Interruptus Revival
April 26 - May 1 In Northern California

The fundamentalist plan ­ "The Rapture" ­ is now in progress. People are vanishing, yanked up into another world. These believers are disappearing into SUV's, idling between super malls. They believe, though, with the Playstations in their dashboards, that their Ford Expeditions are climbing straight up cliffs and jumping fjords and running with wolves. That's Heaven's final ad campaign: Consumers on pixilated interstates up Mount Everest. Those of us left behind will die in the Hell and rising Floods of the over-heating planet.

Children, welcome to the The Rapture Interruptus Revival - we shall hit the Rapture right where it hurts. We shall slam the Rapture into Reverse. We shall sing "Stop Shopping" between the consumer and the car ­ catching them in the Parking Lot Of No Return. We plan a new kind of performance art, a curving choreography designed for on-ramps. Exorcisms of Bad Traffic are now being taught in 24 hour all-night shifts at the Slow Consuming School of Divinity…

--WE RELY ON WORD OF MOUTH! PLEASE FORWARD TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN THE BAY AREA--

www.sinfusion.com/naughty Ladies, Gentlemen, and Pervs of all stripes, 
As they say, "the third time's a charm" and we're certain that our 
third event will be as charmed and charming as our lovely clientele. 
And since it's our third Naughty we're gonna celebrate that most 
magnificent triplet - the threesome. People who purchase at least two 
tickets in advance will be able to bring a hot, sexy, newbie guest for 
free!* The weather has turned much more hospitable and the temperature 
is sure to rise just based on your own naughty participation on 
Saturday, May 6, at our favorite undisclosed location. Random will be 
rewarding the first threesome he sees with a special prize so be 
prepared to get busy! For this, our third event, we will also be 
cracking down a bit. We've been lenient for the first two events both 
on dress and affiliation, but no longer. First off, you MUST NOT arrive 
in casual clothes unless you've brought a change of clothes with you to 
the event. No sneakers; no blue jeans; no t-shirts. Secondly, if you 
are a single male we've upped the ante a bit. You preferably need to be 
accompanied to the venue by a member of the fairer sex. Otherwise you 
need to obtain advance permission from the promoters in order to attend 
solo. We, the management, recognize that there are single guys out 
there who are not only long-term loyal customers but also extremely 
well-behaved and a positive addition to any of our events. We look 
forward to adding you to our list of sinFUSION pre-approved gentleman 
and look forward to hearing from you via email to the reply-to address 
from this announcement. But don't dawdle! All such requests must be 
received, at the latest, 36 hours before Threesomania commences. Please 
provide us with the email address you would use when purchasing tickets 
and, if there's any doubt that we'd not know who you are, a picture or 
link to a picture identifying you. All the hassle can of course be 
avoided by recruiting that lovely femme fatale to walk in on your arm. 
It may make for more guaranteed fun as well... Tickets are now on sale 
online at www.sinfusion.com/naughty/p...ckets.php. Buy two or more and 
that sexy extra guest on us! Your DJ's for the Evening: Shatter

Wednesday, August 02, 2006 * BOOM FESTIVAL Magic *

Date & Time:  Wednesday, August 2, 2006 - Wednesday, August 9, 2006 4:00 AM
Heya, All! We would like to share with you information about a very special
global arts, music and culture-gathering that incarnates biannually in
Portugal. Boom Festival takes place in a stunning outdoor location on the
shore of the Lake Idanha-a-Nova, approximately 2 hours North-West from
Lisboa. Bringing together the latest in psychedelic sights & sounds,
phantastic art installations & workshops, this week-long event is a harmonic
convergence of people, energy, information, and philosophies, from planet
Earth & beyond. Synchronized multi-dimensionally with the full moon of
August, the next Boom-Festival is taking a bio-dynamic approach by
incorporating a variety of sustainable techniques, and Earth-based forms
throughout its infrastructure. Reflecting a harmonic balance of the organic
and the cyber-technologic, Boom 2006 maps the metaphysical framework in
accordance with Peace, Love, Unity and Respect. A very magical event indeed!
5000 BOOM Festival 2006 Early Bird Tickets are available now. They are only
70 Euro for 7 days. Getting there is no big deal. Reasonable flights to
Lisboa can be purchased on most of the European Budget Airlines, and
Transatlantic flights from America are also quite cheap. The Boom has
organized busses that take you directly from the international airport to
the sacred womb of the vacation party paradise. This year, Boom-festival has
extended its length to ONE WEEK! Great news about the timing of BOOM 2006 is
that it's not happening in conjunction with Burning Man, so the devoted
"Burners" have a chance to partake on European creative community
expression. BOOM is similar to Burning Man, but with a lake & great sounds!
Not to be missed ... For more info, please visit: www.boomfestival.org

Neu-Rave: the new wave of guitars and glowsticks 

Monday, 24 April, 2006 
 
As the psychedelic waves of crazy crazes come and go in popular culture or the darker more underground sub cultures, certain ideas plant themselves and evolve with increasing deadly speed. One of these at the moment seems to be the new style of indie music, as its ever looming presence engulfs all in its path, including a hefty slice of old school dance music. 

At the forefront of this quite seemingly random mixture of old and new, guitars and glow sticks, prances The Klaxons who describe themselves as screamo happy hardcore pop. Now if that isn’t the most contradicting genre I’ve ever heard then call me emo. Although this glamorous combination might scare the more emotionally in tune of us away, I do think there is a glimmer of hope here for the unifying opportunities of cross dressing genres. The Klaxons perform as an early 90’s rave tribute, recreating old school acid house rave acts such as Altern-8 and Baby D and more modern techno labels like Cluster Records. Listening to ‘Gravity’s Rainbow’ they sound like all the other indie bands to me, but with more euphoric lyrics – not that that is a bad thing. But then what was I expecting, today you have to sound like NMEs lapdogs to get anywhere. ‘Atlantis to Interzone’ uses some more trance and acid house style sounds, and I think it works well with the punky vocals over the panic sirens.

Scotland’s S***disco are another act hoping to catch the wave before it crashes, and I think they sound nearer to what Neu-Rave suggests. You can hear the influence of Prodigy in their snappy drumming and grimy breakdowns, and this works with the stoner rock-esque voice of the singer of Joe Reeves in ‘Disco Blood’. But they still sound more old school New York punk than British rave.

New Young Pony Club are another outfit ready and willing to provide you with filthy electro grunge food stuffs, but who are they playing for?

As a typical dance music lover I find it hard to see why other ravers would listen to these bands just because they mention old acid house tunes and lyrics and are influenced by early rave. If it’s to really take off a huge fanbase is needed. Luckily these guys have already discovered MySpace and are using it to their full advantage in getting enough contacts to start touring with the right bands and advertising to the open minded new generations of hedonistic guitar lovers.

As I’ve heard more frequently over the past couple of years, techno and electronica is the rock and roll music of the 2000’s, with more passion and enthusiasm than all the long haired ‘alternative’ styles put together.

So is it time for the moaning eighties come backs to retire and the early nineties electronic revival to really bloom?

Only circular time and the short term memory of youth will tell.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves."

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TV-Turnoff Week

I've got you all beat- I'm working on my TV-Turnoff DECADE.  I haven't lived in a house with a TV in it since '98.  Recent developments like YouTube mean I do see a little more content than I used to, but I get to choose it.  I watch the occasional DVD on the computer, so I'm not anti-video.
 
 I just realized at some point that all of the times where I didn't turn the TV on, I could be working on music.  So I just ejected it from my life.  I feel sometimes that I'm missing out on this or that bit of pop culture, but anything really interesting will filter down to me through friends anyway, so... 
 
 It's just never made sense to me to pay for a box and then pay for a monthly subscription so some good stuff will show up on that box, and spend the lion's share of your time being fed advertising BS.  It's like paying somebody to erect a billboard in your living room and shout at you.
 
 ..but that's just my take..

I have a similar problem - i ditched cable 2 years ago, trying to stop
watching TV, but I end up wasting that time somehow (first movies, now
the evil that is the iTunes Video store.)

I'm gonna try to leave the good ol' TV off this week, but its hard to
sleep without the noise...

Um, I've got slight problem with this. Seems I won't be participating as
you have to own a tv before you can turn it off.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] TV-Turnoff Week

You couldn't have expressed the rationale for "TV-Turnoff DECADE"  
better! When I retired in 1995 after 35 years teaching high school, I  
dropped my TV cable service, daily newspaper and magazine  
subscriptions, and switched to the Internet. Healthiest thing I ever  
did in that respect--but I'm not OCD or ADHD either....

Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the  
merger
of state and corporate power.  -- Mussolini

So, I wasn't watching TV, I was in the other room playing music, but I left
the tv on for background noise. But anyway, I just had to watch this show.

There is a documentry on mdma on the history channel right now. So far they
have kept the bias to a minimum and the historical facts are correct.

Funny.  The 1st thing that came to mind right away was this scene from 
the movie They Live.  It's where this homeless encampment gets levelled 
by the police.  Except for ONE thing.  The TV, which they leave running.

Dearest SFRavers,

I bring you final proof of the existence of god in the form of a banana,
a can of pepsi, and Kirk Cameron.

The funniest bit starts around 3:30 in, but the whole thing is pretty
gut bustingly funny, I especially laughed my ass off at the interviews
with the athiests.

It makes me cry more than laugh.  Salvationists are clinically
insane, they hold vast power in this culture, and many of them
are full of mindless, homicidal hatred against people who don't
subscribe to their special version of reality.

They are not Christians, by the way, though they persist in
calling themselves that.  They are Salvationists.

Christians are gentle, loving people who follow the teachings
of a first-century rabbi named Jesus.

There are certain spots in GG park that all you need to do is reserve the
picnic area, as long as the party isn't too huge and out of control, you
shouldn't have any problems with the park rangers.  Here's a link to
available picnic areas in GG park:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfr day party?

i can confirm that.  we had a park ranger shut us down last summer,
but basically all he said was if we had paid some $30-50 permit,
everything would have been okay.

correct me if i'm wrong, but we're expecting this thing to be less
than 75-100 people at any given time during the day, right?

if we're expecting more than 100 people at any given time, then i
think we need to look into other permits.  less than 100...no problem.

MIDDLE HARBOR PARK IN OAKLAND! Hehehe

I really like the spot!

What sort of permits should I be looking into for it? Just sound? Booze? 
Anything else?

Not w/o permits...you do have to get permits - but, seeeing as there are 
rarely EVER people there, they might be a little more easygoing. And it'd be 
perfect for sound/BBQ/etc.

Park system are not worth it for the money.  However Marco mentioned they
set up a sound system down at Middle Harbor Park on the Oakland shoreline
with no permits or problems.

I dunno Marco, all the EBRP rangers I've run into are hardasses (i've been
ticketed a few times by them and so have my friends).  Back when the park
was run by the port authority you could do all kinds of stuff there, but
since then it's transferred complete authority to EBRP.  I love that spot
though, maybe we should try a test run and see how it goes  :)))

    From my past research, all the parks I looked into for East Bay =

    Park system are not worth it for the money.  However Marco mentioned =
they
    set up a sound system down at Middle Harbor Park on the Oakland =
shoreline

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfr day party?

I've been to several parties at Speedway Meadow that went pretty well.  Parking is relatively easy and there is a nearby bathroom as well.  Don't forget to consider that they close some of the roads into the park on weekends. 
 
 Let me know how I can contribute...

Whatever happened to Lake Elizabeth in Fremont?

I didn't see anyone mention that place. Used to be very party friendly a 
few years back.

Join me this week in finally celebrating the demise of Jack.

What do I mean by that? Well for starters, I'm finally springcleaning  
my record collection - most of which was locked away in storage for  
several years. It's been an interesting experience, shedding some new  
light on the value and quality of alot of the so called "house" music  
I picked up from the mid/late nineties through into this century.  
Quite frankly alot of it is not much more but a pale imitation of the  
music that preceded it. Not such a big suprise, but clearing it out  
(and in so doing making room for what is going on now, and what is  
yet to come) has been a liberating experience. One I wish to  
celebrate with you on the show this week. So, the first hour or two I  
will therefore devote to old and new music I feel still contains some  
of the spirit of our dear departed ol' friend Jack, after which I'll  
slowly break away from the beats into a more diverse selections of  
music and song..


So Jack is dead, but as surely as we declare his demise, and push his  
lifeless body back into his box, he inevitably returns, popping right  
back out at us when we least expect it, full of surprise. Jack is  
dead - long live Jack..!

For more information about the theme of tonight' show go here -

topic_view=threads&p=1228&t=300

otherwise go to http://www.90hz.org to LISTEN and CHAT.

9pm - very late..

Note that smoking is now banned in all San Francisco parks including,  
of course, GGP.  Cigs and stuff will attract as much negative  
attention as vigorous music:)

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm



"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sfr day party?

Speaking as a carless SF resident, I'd really like to keep this
shindig in the city if at all possible.  I also think it would be only
right for an SFRaves gettogether.

-------------------------------1146020941
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Um.. not to make this whole party-planning process any more confusing, but  I 
sort of just had an east bay spot plop in my lap.
 
I know we were trying to get a night party going on last summer, but the  
whole... um... *thing* happened, and a lot of people were too busy to commit, to  
boot.
 
I would hate to see this space be passed up. Are you guys down to have a  day 
party *and* night party this summer? We could spread them out. I can't do  
anything in the beginning of summer anyhow, so I was thinking more toward the  
end for this night party.
 
If you wanna take a ride on the cool "I'm planning an SFR night party"  boat, 
then go ahead and sign up to the planning list by sending an e-mail to 
_sfraves-planners-subscribe@hyperreal.org_ 
(mailto:sfraves-planners-subscribe@hyperreal.org)  with  the words "subscribe" in the body.
 
Heart,
Alida

Lets have a day party followed by a night party or vice versa.  Remember
back in the day when you would go out to a party and you wouldnt leave unti=
l
almost noon the next day?  I miss parties that went all night and well into
the next day.

This was the idea i pitched from the start: we have 2 crews, one does  
a day party with minimal effort/resources, and the other throws a  
full-on night party IN AN ALL-AGES VENUE.

I think we could pull it off.

DO NOT VERSUS ME GC.

I WILL SPLATTER THE WALL BEHIND YOU WITH A PEARLY BUKKAKE SHEEN, LEAVING 
ONLY YOUR SILHOUTTE UNSOILED.

ALSO:

I WILL NOT PLAY LIVE DURING THE DAY.  THE LESS I PLAY OUT, THE MEANER AND 
FUNKIER I GET.  THIS WOULD CAUSE "PROBLEMS" AT A DAY PARTY.

TECHNO IS NIGHT MUSIC FUCKERS UNLESS YOU ARE IN DETROIT AND EVERYBODY 
GETS IT.

I WILL HOWEVER PWN YOUR RAGTAG TEAM OF TECHNO SOCKPUPPET FUCKETEERS.  BUT 
NOT IN SOME BEATMATCHED COLLABORATION.  I'M TALKING WAR HERE.  
ALTERNATING 10 MINUTE ROUNDS, SHIT TALKING, THE WORKS.

ROUND ONE:
NITROUS OXIDE TURNTABLISM

ROUND TWO:
BEER BONG BEATBOXING

ROUND THREE:
EACH CONTENDER PLAYS THEIR GEAR WHILE THE OTHER HAS A MIC AND TALKS SHIT 
ABOUT HOW BAD IT SUCKS OVER IT.

ROUND FOUR:
MUD WRESTLING

CROWD DECIDES WHO WINS BY VOLUME OF APPLAUSE.

LOSER EATS NUTELLA OFF WINNERS ASS.  REAL SLOW LIKE.  HOPE YOU'RE NOT 
ALLERGIC TO HAZELNUT, BITCH.

STANDING ON THE SHIFT KEY CAUSE I'M HOPING FOR CHANGE.

THAT IS ALL

The week is almost over! Come join us, and start your weekend early with resident DJs Evinrude, Dirt, Nugz, m.d.K, Dru, E-Rok, G.A.M.M.A., and special guests. 

This week, 4/27, we're extra-, super-, ultra-proud to feature: 

MATT NEE 
(kompute records / www.komputemusik.com - Chicago) 
Kompute Musik, an independent record label, was established in 1999 by Matt Nee and friends for the purpose of releasing Chicago-style electronic music to the world. Since that time, kompute has released music from some of the world's most innovative recording artists, inspiring a new generation and reaching every corner of the globe. Matt Nee was listed as one of the top 12 DJs in Chicago (along with Traxx, Green Velvet, and Derrick Carter) in Time Out! Chicago October 2005. Check out his techno \ electro, new wave sound. This is by far the biggest artist we've EVER brought to @lpha - not to mention on a weekday! 

MYCHO COCOA 
(The Fringe, SF) 
Well, it's high time we brought this breakbeat ally out to spin some records with us. Mycho is an on-the-rise breaks DJ who has been throwing some killer events and spinning a massive quantity of wicked sets all around the Bay lately. We're excited to finally feature him on our decks. 

We now have drink specials on Thursdays, thus we're putting our beloved "Broke-Ass" name back on this one. Ask the bartenders for the specials, or check the specials board. 

Thursdays are always free, the first beat drops at 9pm, and we go 'til 2am. @lpha bar is located at 3848 Geary, at the corner of 3rd Ave. We'll hope to see you there!

2. The past always tries to control the creativity that builds on it.
3. Free societies enable the future by living in the past.
4. Ours is a less and less a free society.

Gosh, I dunno. All I did was compare the film to another film, 
"Tribulation 99: Alien Anomalies Under America", a well made parody doc 
and all hell broke loose. Dunno what got their panties in a bunch.

I think it was the psytrance.

You should add Umberto Eco's book Focault's Pendulum to your list.  Anyone interested in conspiracy theories should read this book.
 
 In brief:
 
 Be careful what sort of conspiracies you pretend to believe in, because it just might turn out that they are true.  
 
 But if it did turn out that your pet conspiracy theory is true, how would you really know that you weren't just imagining it?  
 
 This way lies madness...

Mediocre at best - perhaps. But it raised a number of good questions - and 
that's what intrigued me. Nothing in it really seemed all that hokey or 
out-there....if the books you refer to go into greater depth and detail, I'd 
be interested in reading them.

I've seen the video - it only scratches the tip of the iceburg and a lot of
it is more theory than evidence.  If you really want to go indepth about all
the unaswered questions an inconsistencies, PICK UP A BOOK!  Most of the
videos I've seen covering 9/11 are mediocre at best, including the one you
posted.  Try reading the 9/11 works by one of these authors and you'll be a
lot more pissed off, and wonder why so many questions have remained
unanswered:

**Michel Chossudovsky, Paul Thompson, Nafeez Ahmed, Mike Ruppert, Dan
Hopsicker, David Ray Griffin

If you want to dive really deep into it, start out with Mike Ruppert's
crossing the Rubicon, which is the #2 selling book on 9/11 after the Keam
Commission report.  It's a bit long, around 600pp, but covering something
like 9/11 shouldn't cut the corners.

I think Gforce has been included for years with Winamp.  I've wasted quite =

Good stuff.

They make it really easy to plug in other audio sources to produce visuals
too.  Look up the specs online.

my fave bus driver in the world, LeNay (I hear U Yaya), & well... after i
got my cigs, i still had like 50 minutes 2 kill... so I went 2 the Post
office & like saw these Awesome new envelopes they got for send like kinda
bulky stuff, YAAAY Happy Faces :), then i went 2 the Realestate office &
well.. inquired about escrow :)  Well.. after that i went 2 the $1 Store &
window shopped.. Hello 2day... Tide i Japanesse is well.. Tide :)  Only
for a $1.. Hello 2Day!  Well.. i ended up walking outta there w/ 20 sticks
of insence & new shades :)  Then caught Lenay on her route again 2 my
house! :)  Yeah.. sounds soooo uuuggghh.. Hello 2day... Adventure in the
burbs.. yeah.. i also wash my dishes when i water the plants in the
backyard... i wash clothes when i water the plants in the front yard ;)

But yeah.. now i know what escrow means!! :)  My lif3 is somewhat better
now now that i kjnow that... 'cause I've alw3ays wondered!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: 9/11 "conspiracy" film

I arrived in America in my Mom's womb about 1 hour after Kenendy got
capped in Dallas.

Wanna get my attention at a party and have you a cheap laugh in the process=
?

Just say the words 'grassy knoll' or 'Zapruder' or 'second spitter'
and watch my head snap.

It's a curse more than a blessing actually.

Currently I live on Staten Island, 2 minutes by foot from a picture
perfect view of downtown Manhattan, (there were 4 helicopters hovering
outside my kitchen window for most of the day on 9.11), and the home
of the Fresh Kills landfill where most of the Ground Zero debris was
taken.

There are a lot of interesting issues raised by this film, but the
thing I find most lacking, and downright puzzling, in all conspiracy
theories on the subject, be they book or video, (outside of the fact
that no one ever mentions Kurosawa's movie Rashomon when discussing
this), is that how come nobody has come forward to test or give their
test results for traces of the signature for C-4 explosives at Ground
Zero?

Surely, if this indeed was a controlled demolition, as some contend,
it would be impossible to hide the C-4 signature.

This is simple.

No C-4 signature, no controlled demo, no Govt conspiracy.

End of.

For shits and giggles, check out the last 5 minutes of the pilot for
the X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen, which first ran on 4 March
2001, 6 months and one week, exactly, before 9.11 where one of the
towers narrowly misses getting smacked by a remote controlled 747:

http://www.mininova.org/get/183180

Between that, and Tom Clancy, (who no one in this White House reads),
it kinda punches a hole in Condi's assertion that 'no one could have
forseen a plane being used as a missile' now doesn't it?

ha ha.

Face it.

If this truly is a conspiracy, if you value your life and reputation
it's pointless to pursue because if there are people that have the
cajones http://tinyurl.com/n63g2 to pull this sort of thing off, what
makes you think they're going to care what anyone thinks or says on
the subject?

Monday, May 1st is, among other things, Jay Day.

Not, if you stop to think about it, that there's anything to "celebrate"

I'm gonna go have me a 1933 FDR era Martini right now.

Think when this war is finally over George W. Bush is gonna light up a
fatty on national television in the Oval Office?

Dream on.

Everyone who ever takes shots at the 9/11 theories always takes shot at the
controlled demolotion.  The fact is, there is a plethora of other evidence
that has led many investigative journalists, families of 9/11 victims, and
informed americans to question why and how these attacks were allowed to
occur.

Other invaluable things to consider outside the controlled demo theory:

NORAD/FAA timeline inconsistencies and revisions
Who is in control of US airspace during a terrorist attack
NORAD wargames taking place on 9/11
Insider Trading
The Phoenix and Minnesota FBI memos
Israeli Mossad (similar to CIA) agents undercover as art students conductin=
g
surveilance of certain 9/11 hijackers
Israeli Mossad agent who was on flight 93
Many of the hijackers turning up alive as reported by BBC among other
credible news sources
Midlevel FBI & CIA agents were stonewalled from upper eschelons of the
government from doing further detective work that could very well have
stopped the 9/11 attacks
Substantial amounts of daming evidence/witnesses were kept outside the kean
commission report... do some research on who was involved on the kean
commission and to whom and what they're connected to, simply be put, it'd b=
e
like putting  a suspected  White Power Murderer on trial, while the judge
and jury is all run by the KKK- would we really be surprised with the
outcome?


Like I said in an earlier email, it'd be impossible to summarize everything
surrounding 911-   if you think I'm full of it, pick up the Kean Commission
Report and compare it to all the inconsistencies David Ray Griffin points
out in his book.   And please, do not point out the controlled demolition
theory as proof the US government is innocent.  It's a shame so many
americans take all this with a grain of salt, there are still so many
unanswered questions, and unless a truly independent commission for looking
911 is formed, I don't think we'll ever find out why these attacks were
allowed to occur.


Other things to check into if you want to see what is to come if Neocons
like Paul Wolfowitz and Corporatist- US nationals like Cheney & Rumsfeld
remain in policy making...  look into the National Energy Policy
(particularly 2000) headed by Dick Cheney along with the PNAC (Plan for a
New American Century) conservative think tank

Could you elaborate on the "C-4 signature?"

Joe Blough <geniusatwerk@gmail.com> wrote:  I arrived in America in my Mom's womb about 1 hour after Kenendy got

Wanna get my attention at a party and have you a cheap laugh in the process?

Just say the words 'grassy knoll' or 'Zapruder' or 'second spitter'
and watch my head snap.

It's a curse more than a blessing actually.

Currently I live on Staten Island, 2 minutes by foot from a picture
perfect view of downtown Manhattan, (there were 4 helicopters hovering
outside my kitchen window for most of the day on 9.11), and the home
of the Fresh Kills landfill where most of the Ground Zero debris was
taken.

There are a lot of interesting issues raised by this film, but the
thing I find most lacking, and downright puzzling, in all conspiracy
theories on the subject, be they book or video, (outside of the fact
that no one ever mentions Kurosawa's movie Rashomon when discussing
this), is that how come nobody has come forward to test or give their
test results for traces of the signature for C-4 explosives at Ground
Zero?

Surely, if this indeed was a controlled demolition, as some contend,
it would be impossible to hide the C-4 signature.

This is simple.

No C-4 signature, no controlled demo, no Govt conspiracy.

End of.

For shits and giggles, check out the last 5 minutes of the pilot for
the X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen, which first ran on 4 March
2001, 6 months and one week, exactly, before 9.11 where one of the
towers narrowly misses getting smacked by a remote controlled 747:

http://www.mininova.org/get/183180

Between that, and Tom Clancy, (who no one in this White House reads),
it kinda punches a hole in Condi's assertion that 'no one could have
forseen a plane being used as a missile' now doesn't it?

ha ha.

Face it.

If this truly is a conspiracy, if you value your life and reputation
it's pointless to pursue because if there are people that have the
cajones http://tinyurl.com/n63g2 to pull this sort of thing off, what
makes you think they're going to care what anyone thinks or says on
the subject?

Glad to.

TNT, Dynamite, C-4, paraffin, (which has never, ever, werked for me),
nuclear bombs, sugar and chlorine powder, (in a 2;1 ratio, packed
tightly in a metal tube), all leave a unique and distinct chemical
'signature' much akin to a human fingerprint, which makes them easy to
identify.

hope that helps.

Escrow is the point of like the ummm... Hello 2day.. ok.. so like when
someone wants to buy a house.. they put out an offer to the Realitor, then
when that's accepted & the bank payment stuff is starting to proccess..
that's when escrow begins... when all the money stuff in the bank is
sorted and stuff & the house goes to the new owners.. that when escrow
closes.. it's the money thing in buying a house that escrow is mainly like

um.... almost right.

escrow is where a third, neutral party holds the funds and makes sure =20=

that all the contractual agreements of the sale are met by both parties.

Amy Fisher Blames Ecstasy for Attack
-
Thursday, April 27, 2006

(04-27) 14:20 PDT LOS ANGELES, (AP) --

The Ecstasy made her do it.

Amy Fisher says she was strung out on the club drug when she shot her
boyfriend's wife in the face in 1992.

"I was using Ecstasy, a lot of Ecstasy," Fisher, nicknamed the "Long
Island Lolita," tells "Entertainment Tonight" in an interview that was
to air Thursday. "I had no control."

Fisher was 16 when she visited the home of her much-older lover, Joey
Buttafuoco, a car mechanic on New York's Long Island, and shot his
wife, Mary Jo, as she answered the door.

The drug made her feel "stronger and confident," she says.

"I just did something totally irrational," Fisher says. "Believe me,
rational people don't go to do something like that in the middle of
the day. It's just insane."

She served seven years in prison for the attack.

Buttafuoco pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape and served
four months in jail. His wife survived the shooting. The couple
remained together after the Fisher affair, but divorced after moving
to California.

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Special surprise guest TRAXX (int'l deejay gigolos:chicago) FREE tonight @ boca!

Wow! ...YES!!!

On a last minute hook-up we are supremely excited to present a very,
VERY special guest tonight @ our Thursday weekly @ boca!

I have personally seen Traxx on several occasions and have been
thoroughly impressed every time.  The last time I saw him he threw
down a great thumping mix of techno and house with a bit of an electro
/ 80's synth feel to it.  This man is usually Saturday night headliner
material, so to see him for FREE on a Thursday night is truly a
special treat not to be missed.  He will also be joined but another
excellent visiting minimal/tech DJ from Miami, Jason Short (formerly
known as Sattva)!  Tell your friends and get down there tonight.
Traxx will not disappoint!!!


TONIGHT!!!

@ BOCA (the Bar Of Contemporary Art)
414 Jessie St (just around the corner from Mezzanine)
Full bar! + tons of parking @ the 5th and Mission garage
Free / 21+ / 10pm - 2am


:::::::::: T R A X X ::::::::::

( Int'l DeeJay Gigolos . Disko B . Spectral . Antennae . Kompute : Chicago =
)

A musician like no other. Not content to be labeled as merely a DJ, a
producer, or even a DJ/Producer, Traxx is a lover of music. One with a
passion so intense that it overcomes genre divides to weave an
altogether original, exciting, and multi-textured musical fabric which
envelops both the avid clubber and the home listener, as well as
everyone in between. From an early age, Melvin Oliphant surrounded
himself with a wide variety of sounds, from gospel, soul and jazz to
disco, hip hop and nu wave. Growing up in Chicago, however, afforded
him an opportunity many
longed for but never experienced. He lived, first hand, the evolution
of house music into something much more than just an underground
phenomenon, and for this reason, he has a deep understanding of the
history of the sound, and a clear picture of its future. For Traxx,
the future of dance music rests in the hands of those who seek to
expand its boundaries while preserving its past and educating its
devotees. As a self-described "artist of sound," Traxx morphs musical
compositions into distinctive, highly emotional interpretations. He
is, indeed, an innovator, and one who reshapes music into a
progressive, forward-thinking document which defies classification and
invites analysis and discussion. From eclectic and avant-garde tunes
to old school jack tracks and lounge grooves, Traxx hears it all
without discrimination, pretension or elitism.

Here's a recent set to check out!:
Traxx (part 1) at Etikett (Chicago-USA) - 15-02-2006
www.naughtybadfun.org/nbfmixes/Traxx_Etikett_Chicago_021506pt1.MP3


plus another outstanding visiting guest:

::::: JASON SHORT :::::
( Auralism Records : Miami )

Droping the heady and melodic side of minimal and tech-house!


and of course the Thursday regulars:

ALLAND BYALLO  ( liebe*detail . kvadrat produkt . mo's ferry )
SAMMY D  ( classic . dirtybird . utensil )
CRAIG KUNA  ( concept sf . esdjco )

(04-27) 14:20 PDT LOS ANGELES, (AP) --

The Ecstasy made her do it.

Amy Fisher says she was strung out on the club drug when she shot her
boyfriend's wife in the face in 1992.

"I was using Ecstasy, a lot of Ecstasy," Fisher, nicknamed the "Long
Island Lolita," tells "Entertainment Tonight" in an interview that was
to air Thursday. "I had no control."

Fisher was 16 when she visited the home of her much-older lover, Joey
Buttafuoco, a car mechanic on New York's Long Island, and shot his
wife, Mary Jo, as she answered the door.

The drug made her feel "stronger and confident," she says.

"I just did something totally irrational," Fisher says. "Believe me,
rational people don't go to do something like that in the middle of
the day. It's just insane."

She served seven years in prison for the attack.

Buttafuoco pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape and served
four months in jail. His wife survived the shooting. The couple
remained together after the Fisher affair, but divorced after moving
to California.

Who's that motivated while they're faced to shoot someone, lol.

I have a hard time walking and talking if the E is good enough, let alone 
pointing and shooting a gun.

House Ignores Public, Sells Out the Internet

Growing Right-Left Coalition Gains Momentum, Looks to
Senate to Save Internet Freedom from Telecom Cartel

WASHINGTON -- Today the House Energy and Commerce
Committee struck a blow to Internet freedom by voting
down a proposal to protect Network Neutrality from
attacks by companies like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast.

The diverse, bipartisan SavetheInternet.com Coalition
vowed to continue rallying public support for Internet
freedom as the legislation moves to the full House and
Senate. In less than one week, the coalition gathered
more than 250,000 petition signatures, rallied more
than 500 blogs to write about this issue, and flooded
Congress with thousands of phone calls.

The "Markey Amendment" supporting Net Neutrality was
voted down by a vote of 34 to 22. The "Communications
Opportunity, Promotion and Enhancement Act" telecom
law, or COPE Act, passed out of the committee without
any meaningful protection for Net Neutrality. Net
Neutrality means all online activity must be treated
equally, and companies like AT&T must allow Internet
users to view the smallest blog just as easily as the
largest corporate Web site.

"The Commerce Committee is headed in the
opposite direction of where the American public wants
to go," said Columbia Law Professor Timothy Wu, a pro-
market advocate and one of the intellectual architects
of the Net Neutrality principle."Most people favor an
open and neutral Internet and don't want Internet
gatekeepers taxing and tollboothing innovation."

Major telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon are
spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get
Congress to change the rules to let them discriminate
on the Internet -- forcing Web sites to pay "protection
money" to ensure their sites will work properly.

"Predictably, the careerist politicians on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee rolled right over in
their frantic desire to do the telecoms' bidding," said
Craig Fields, director of Internet operations for Gun
Owners of America. "It makes no difference to them
whether the Internet will remain a free and vibrant
marketplace of ideas. As far as they are concerned, if
big business is happy, all is right with America. And
so we look with hope to the Senate, that supposedly
august body, which prides itself on its more
'deliberative' pace and tone. They paint themselves as
conscientious adults -- perhaps, just perhaps, they'll
actually act like such when it is their turn to decide
the future of the Internet."

Groups on the right and left have banded together, and
hundreds of bloggers from across the political spectrum
have galvanized behind this cause, with more than 500
blogs pointing their readers to SavetheInternet.com.

"It's shocking that the House continues to deny
the will of the people on an issue that affects
everyone so directly -- protecting the free and open
Internet," said Eli Pariser, Executive Director of
MoveOn.org Civic Action. "Our bipartisan coalition will
rally the online community like it's never been
rallied before, and together the public will overturn
today's enormous blow to the freedom principle
that's made the Internet great."

"Commerce and free expression on the Internet have
flourished because it's available to everyone on the
same basis," said Glenn Reynolds, of libertarian blog
Instapundit.com. "That's how it should continue to be."

The SavetheInternet.com coalition includes: Gun Owners
of America, MoveOn.org Civic Action, Craig Newmark of
Craigslist, Glenn Reynolds (a.k.a. libertarian blogger
Instapundit), Parents Television Council, United Church
of Christ, the American Library Association, the
Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Common
Cause, Public Knowledge, and other major public
interest groups. The coalition is spearheaded by Free
Press, a national, nonpartisan group focused on media
reform and Internet policy issues. The rapidly
expanding list of groups supporting Internet freedom is
available at www.SavetheInternet.com.

"The diversity of this coalition underscores the
importance of this issue," said Vint Cerf, one of the
fathers of the Internet and Google's Chief Internet
Evangelist. "When the Internet started, you didn't have
to get permission to start companies. You just got on
the Net and started your idea."

The COPE Act next moves from the committee to a full
House vote. The Senate Commerce Committee is expected
to take up Net Neutrality legislation in the coming
weeks.

"The House vote today ignores a groundswell of popular
support for Internet freedom," said Ben Scott, policy
director of Free Press. "We hope that the full House
will resist the big telecom companies and reject the
bill. But we look to the Senate to restore meaningful
protections for net neutrality and ensure that the
Internet remains open to unlimited economic innovation,
civic involvement and free speech."

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Saturday Night Live is running a retrospective of Robert Smigel's 'TV
Fun House' animations in lieu of their regular show this Saturday
night.

Wonder if they'll be showing this clip from 14 March 1998:

http://movies.crooksandliars.com/snl_tv_funhouse_conspiracy_theory_rock_199=
8_03_14.wmv

Which was edited out of all re-runs of that episode.

Is it a conspiracy?

Or is it.... Satan?

hmmmm?

alec baldrin & jan hooks' characters in bed...

alec baldrin: what do you WANT middle aged man?

middle aged man: i want to share my wisdom and tell you that you
shouldn't fear losing your sexual drive

alec baldrin: you know what i think middle aged man? i think you've
forgotten what it was like!

  So like yesterday i probably had like this mondo adventure in the
  burbs of
  Hercules.. I wanted a pack of ciggies.. so i was sure 2 catch the bus
  w/
  my fave bus driver in the world, LeNay (I hear U Yaya), & well...
  after i
  got my cigs, i still had like 50 minutes 2 kill... so I went 2 the
  Post
  office & like saw these Awesome new envelopes they got for send like
  kinda
  bulky stuff, YAAAY Happy Faces :), then i went 2 the Realestate
  office &
  well.. inquired about escrow :) Well.. after that i went 2 the $1
  Store &
  window shopped.. Hello 2day... Tide i Japanesse is well.. Tide :)
  Only
  for a $1.. Hello 2Day! Well.. i ended up walking outta there w/ 20
  sticks
  of insence & new shades :) Then caught Lenay on her route again 2 my
  house! :) Yeah.. sounds soooo uuuggghh.. Hello 2day... Adventure in
  the
  burbs.. yeah.. i also wash my dishes when i water the plants in the
  backyard... i wash clothes when i water the plants in the front yard
  ;)

  But yeah.. now i know what escrow means!! :) My lif3 is somewhat
  better
  now now that i kjnow that... 'cause I've alw3ays wondered!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  Special Announcement and Updates from Love Parade SF

--Apple-Mail-1-440954650
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset=US-ASCII;

Greetings from the crew that brought you Love Parade San Francisco  
'04 and '05!

This is an update on what's been happening at Love HQ in our efforts  
to bring America's premiere electronic music event back to the  
streets of San Francisco.

We are proud to announce the Love will return Fall, 2006!

Once again we'll be hosting the city's, country's and world's best  
electronic music DJ's and music producers with a full on free parade  
down the heart of San Francisco, festival at the Civic Center plaza,  
take over of City Hall, and more pre-parties, after parties, and  
after-after parties this side of WMC.

This parade and festival will not bear the name 'Love Parade' this  
year, as Love Parade Berlin, who we were licensed through the  
previous 2 years, did not renew -any- of their world wide licenses  
not already under contract so they could focus on their own event  
this July, the first Love Parade Berlin in 2 years. We all remain on  
great terms and wish each other amazing events!

Left with the decision of what to do, the same team that organized  
previous SF LP events felt we couldn't let the momentum, work and  
excitement of our first 2 amazingly successful turn outs take a year  
off to wait and see what happens with Berlin next year. We're excited  
to bring the same concept that makes Love Parade so amazing, and make  
it our own, and take it up a notch with a fresh start building on  
past efforts.

An outdoor all day parade and festival showcasing electronic dance  
music, and the wonderful culture that surrounds it, a culture that  
values a lot of things the world needs right now - unity,  
friendliness, respect, tolerance, spirit, cooperation, and fun.  
You're invited once again to make that shine, so get ready for more  
love!

The original founder of Love Parade Berlin, Dr. Motte told us: "I  
would be happy to work close and direct together with you to keep the  
spirit of loveparade alive beyond all borders."

Sounds like a plan! We'll be hearing more from Dr. Motte....

Now moving ahead.... very special thanks again to all who supported  
our benefits in January and February. Though our basically equivalent  
event is not called 'Love Parade' this year, your support was not and  
will not be in vain. The same organization has the same bills to pay  
to the city, and still has them to pay to secure our permits for this  
year. At the time we threw them we had not heard Berlin was not  
renewing any LP licenses, thus they were at that time 'Love Parade'  
benefits. As you may recall, the increased costs associated with the  
Market St. / Civic Center event, coupled with not enough people  
donating at the festival gates - a key component of how we cover our  
expenses, resulted in us ending the event in the red. We've corrected  
those snags in this year's plan, but are hoping for your support one  
more time before the love returns.

Friday, May 12th, the creators of Love Parade 04 and 05 bring you:
True Love Never Dies: a benefit event for the Love event 2006.

Presented by Spundae, Mezzanine, Flirty Flirty, Satellite SF, Wink,  
and Drive. Mezzanine has donated their amazing club and sound system  
for another eclectic night of world class music featuring.

Markus Schultz (markusschultz.com /Armada Music)
Matthew Dekay (mathewdekay.nl / Holland)

Scott Carrelli (Satellite / Qool)
Alain Octavo (Spundae / Wink)
Bali (djbali.com / Flirty Flirty)

Will Spencer (Drive)
Mozaic (Raindance)
Shooey (In Deep / Deep End)
Jonboy(Dubalicious)

We encourage nation wide party people interested in doing a float at  
this years event to start getting ready. Lots more updates coming  
soon, including our new web launch, our final name (working out  
trademark issues now), and our final date (should be confirmed next  
week.)

If you have questions feel free to reply to this e mail.

We're excited to co-create more love with you all, thanks for your  
support!

The Love Team '06.

The EGR 8 year went down quite well out here in SF.  Got some quality 
techno heads together from around the country and had at it. Wished there 
was more stuff going on like this in SF et al, but such is life.. 
Unfortunately a bunch of things changed for me after the 8 year, so I don't 
know when I'm hosting another event... This one was kick ass though... :)

I was going to record another studio mix of more electro-tech type stuff, 
but just didn't have it in me around the 8 year event.. I was rather angry 
and stuff... However, I'm DJing at The End Up in SF 
(http://www.theendup.com/) Thursday May 4th midnight to 2am (fri morn) and 
plan to record the live mix and release that as I kind of need a club to 
play that kind of stuff anyway.. Still edgy, but maybe a little more 
accessible. Hope some of you can make it out; send me an email and I'll see 
if I can work out some sort of guest list; dunno on that one yet. Heh.. 
I'll try to stick in some real dark stuff though too depending on the scene.

Best,
--Mike

Limbaugh Arrested on Drug  Charges
 (http://ar.atwola.com/link/93179288/294186514/aoladp?target=_blank&border=0) 
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (April 28) - Rush Limbaugh was  arrested Friday on 
prescription drug charges, with his attorney saying he has  reached a deal with 
prosecutors that will eventually see the charges dismissed  if he continues 
treatment for drug addiction. 
Limbaugh turned himself in to authorities on a warrant  issued by the State 
Attorney's Office, said Teri Barbera, a spokeswoman for the  State Attorney's 
Office. 
The conservative radio commentator came into the jail at  about 4 p.m. with 
his attorney Roy Black and left an hour later after posting  $3,000 bail, 
Barbera said. The warrant was for fraud to conceal information to  obtain 
prescriptions, Barbera said. 
Black said his client and prosecutors reached a settlement  on a charge of 
doctor shopping filed Friday by the State Attorney, which Black  said will be 
dismissed in 18 months if Limbaugh complies with court  guidelines. 
As a primary condition of the dismissal, Limbaugh must  continue to seek 
treatment from the doctor he has seen for the past 2 1/2 years,  Black said. 
Limbaugh entered a plea of not guilty in court Friday on  the charge and 
Black maintained his client's innocence. 
"Mr. Limbaugh and I have maintained from the start that  there was no doctor 
shopping, and we continue to hold this position," Black said  in an e-mailed 
statement. 
Prosecutors began investigating Limbaugh in 2003 after a  tabloid newspaper 
reported that his housekeeper said he had used her to  illegally buy 
painkillers. He soon took a five-week leave from his radio show to  enter a 
rehabilitation program. 
Prosecutors seized Limbaugh's records after learning that  he received about 
2,000 painkillers, prescribed by four doctors in six months,  at a pharmacy 
near his Palm Beach mansion. They contended that Limbaugh engaged  in "doctor 
shopping," or illegally deceived multiple doctors to receive  overlapping 
prescriptions. 
Limbaugh acknowledged he became addicted to pain  medication, blaming it on 
severe back pain. 
According to Black, Limbaugh also has agreed to make a  $30,000 payment to 
the state to defray the public cost of the investigation. The  agreement also 
provides that he must refrain from violating the law during this  18 months, 
must pay $30 per month for the cost of supervision and comply with  other similar 
provisions of the agreement.

The Freshness

When it's cold and raining,
you are more beautiful.

And the snow brings me
even closer to your lips.

The inner secret, that which was never born,
you are that freshness, and I am with you now.

I can't explain the goings,
or the comings. You enter suddenly,

and I am nowhere again.
Inside the majesty.

Saturday. May 06, 2006 * NAUGHTY's third event - Threesomania! *

Date & Time:  Saturday, May 6, 2006 more on this date 10:00 PM Location:
Bohemia SoMa More Info:  415.626.4561 www.sinfusion.com/naughty Ladies,
Gentlemen, and Pervs of all stripes, As they say, "the third time's a charm"
and we're certain that our third event will be as charmed and charming as
our lovely clientele. And since it's our third Naughty we're gonna celebrate
that most magnificent triplet - the threesome. People who purchase at least
two tickets in advance will be able to bring a hot, sexy, newbie guest for
free!* The weather has turned much more hospitable and the temperature is
sure to rise just based on your own naughty participation on Saturday, May
6, at our favorite undisclosed location. Random will be rewarding the first
threesome he sees with a special prize so be prepared to get busy! For this,
our third event, we will also be cracking down a bit. We've been lenient for
the first two events both on dress and affiliation, but no longer. First
off, you MUST NOT arrive in casual clothes unless you've brought a change of
clothes with you to the event. No sneakers; no blue jeans; no t-shirts.
Secondly, if you are a single male we've upped the ante a bit. You
preferably need to be accompanied to the venue by a member of the fairer
sex. Otherwise you need to obtain advance permission from the promoters in
order to attend solo. We, the management, recognize that there are single
guys out there who are not only long-term loyal customers but also extremely
well-behaved and a positive addition to any of our events. We look forward
to adding you to our list of sinFUSION pre-approved gentleman and look
forward to hearing from you via email to the reply-to address from this
announcement. But don't dawdle! All such requests must be received, at the
latest, 36 hours before Threesomania commences. Please provide us with the
email address you would use when purchasing tickets and, if there's any
doubt that we'd not know who you are, a picture or link to a picture
identifying you. All the hassle can of course be avoided by recruiting that
lovely femme fatale to walk in on your arm. It may make for more guaranteed

Wednesday, August 02, 2006 * BOOM FESTIVAL Magic *

Date & Time:  Wednesday, August 2, 2006 - Wednesday, August 9, 2006 4:00 AM
Heya, All! We would like to share with you information about a very special
global arts, music and culture-gathering that incarnates biannually in
Portugal. Boom Festival takes place in a stunning outdoor location on the
shore of the Lake Idanha-a-Nova, approximately 2 hours North-West from
Lisboa. Bringing together the latest in psychedelic sights & sounds,
phantastic art installations & workshops, this week-long event is a harmonic
convergence of people, energy, information, and philosophies, from planet
Earth & beyond. Synchronized multi-dimensionally with the full moon of
August, the next Boom-Festival is taking a bio-dynamic approach by
incorporating a variety of sustainable techniques, and Earth-based forms
throughout its infrastructure. Reflecting a harmonic balance of the organic
and the cyber-technologic, Boom 2006 maps the metaphysical framework in
accordance with Peace, Love, Unity and Respect. A very magical event indeed!
5000 BOOM Festival 2006 Early Bird Tickets are available now. They are only
70 Euro for 7 days. Getting there is no big deal. Reasonable flights to
Lisboa can be purchased on most of the European Budget Airlines, and
Transatlantic flights from America are also quite cheap. The Boom has
organized busses that take you directly from the international airport to
the sacred womb of the vacation party paradise. This year, Boom-festival has
extended its length to ONE WEEK! Great news about the timing of BOOM 2006 is
that it's not happening in conjunction with Burning Man, so the devoted
"Burners" have a chance to partake on European creative community
expression. BOOM is similar to Burning Man, but with a lake & great sounds!
Not to be missed ... For more info, please visit: www.boomfestival.org

Mexico's Congress Legalizes Drugs for Personal Use

Friday , April 28, 2006

[]
 

MEXICO CITY ­ Mexico's Congress approved a bill Friday decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and heroin for personal use ­ a measure sure to raise questions in Washington about Mexico's commitment to the war on drugs.

The only remaining step was the signature of President Vicente Fox, whose office indicated he would sign it.

Supporters said the law would let police focus on drug smuggling, rather than on busting casual users. The bill also would stiffen many drug-related penalties: for trafficking, for possession near schools, and for possession of even small quantities by government employees.

Criminal penalties for drug sales would remain on the books.

"We can't close our eyes to this reality," said Sen. Jorge Zermeno, of Fox's conservative National Action Party. "We cannot continue to fill our jails with people who have addictions."

The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush scrambled to come up with a response.

"We're still studying the legislation, but any effort to decriminalize illegal drugs would not be helpful," a U.S. diplomat said on condition of anonymity.

The bill, passed by Mexico's Senate on a 53-26 vote with one abstention, had already been quietly approved in the lower house of Congress and was sent Friday to the president's desk. Presidential spokesman Ruben Aguilar indicated Fox would sign it.

"This law gives police and prosecutors better legal tools to combat drug crimes that do so much damage to our youth and children," he said.

If signed into law, the bill could have an impact on Mexico's relationship with the United States ­ and on the vast numbers of vacationing students who visit Mexico, often to take advantage of its rarely enforced drinking age of 18.

The bill says criminal charges will no longer be brought for possession of up to 25 milligrams of heroin, five grams of marijuana ­ about one-fifth of an ounce, or about four joints ­ and half a gram of cocaine ­ about half the standard street-size quantity, which is enough for several lines of the drug.

"No charges will be brought against ... addicts or consumers who are found in possession of any narcotic for personal use," the Senate bill reads. It also lays out allowable quantities for a large array of other drugs, including LSD, MDA, ecstasy ­ about two pills' worth ­ and amphetamines.

Some of the amounts are eye-popping: Mexicans would be allowed to possess a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of peyote, the button-sized hallucinogenic cactus used in some native Indian religious ceremonies.

Mexican law now leaves open the possibility of dropping charges against people caught with drugs if they are considered addicts and if "the amount is the quantity necessary for personal use." But the exemption isn't automatic.

The new bill drops the "addict" requirement ­ automatically allowing any "consumers" to have drugs ­ and sets out specific allowable quantities.

Sale of all drugs would remain illegal under the proposed law, unlike the Netherlands, where the sale of marijuana for medical use is legal and it can be bought with a prescription in pharmacies.

While Dutch authorities look the other way regarding the open sale of cannabis in designated coffee shops ­ something Mexican police seem unlikely to do ­ the Dutch have zero tolerance for heroin and cocaine. In both countries, commercial growing of marijuana is outlawed.

In Colombia, a 1994 court ruling decriminalized personal possession of small amounts of cocaine, heroin and other drugs. But President Alvaro Uribe, who is almost assured of re-election next month, wants to change that with a constitutional amendment.

"Allowing the personal dosage of drugs is inconsistent with a country committed to fighting the war on drugs," Uribe said at a campaign stop.

The effects could be significant, given that Mexico is rapidly becoming a drug-consuming nation as well as a shipment point for traffickers, and given the number of U.S. students who flock to border cities or resorts like Cancun and Acapulco on vacation.

"This is going to increase addictions in Mexico," said Ulisis Bon, a drug treatment expert in Tijuana, where heroin use is rampant. "A lot of Americans already come here to buy medications they can't get up there ... Just imagine, with heroin."

U.S. legalization advocates greeted the bill with glee.

Ethan Nadelmann, director of the New York-based Drug Policy Alliance, called it "a very good move," saying it removed "a huge opportunity for low-level police corruption." In Mexico, police often release people detained for minor drug possession in exchange for bribes.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] old rave photos



yay for the fans!  :)

one of the first places i ever got to spin a copy of
The Parti EP was at a day party in SF and i remember
people responding well when the CZ-101 organ part
starts up on 'Fresh Is...' and at that moment i
thought "Hey!  I made a record!"  :D

anyway, you can see my full mixtapeography listed out
if you go to http://www.abductionproductions.com then
click on "Music Production"  -- if anyone wants mp3s
of any of those mixtapes, just drop me a note and i'll
hook you up (sorry I don't have the tracklistings
online yet -- i'll work on that this week).
