: For some reason, I was kinda reluctant to introduce myself to some of the
: people at the big group hug...  Ya know that feeling you get when like,
: everyone else knows each other and they're all hugging each other and
: smiling and having fun and talking about random stuff, and you wanna join
: in, but something inside is telling you not to??  I dunno... I guess it
: was just me.  But to the few people that I did introduce myself to, I
: wanna say "Hi!"

Yea well... Just be happy that these people don't criticize you for not
joining in. It is obvious that thousands of people are just like myself
when it comes to opening up, and feeling welcome.
SFRaves people set aside, at the ravEs I am usually looked opon as a person
that is only joining in to put on a good show. Imagine these unwanted
perceptions bombarding your perfectly understandable shyness. Explanation:
Like you finally get the courage to open up just so someone can ridicule
your actions and write you off like your fronting.


Anyways.. I am actually rather healthy mentally today, aside from being
alittle foggy from my partying decisions. I don't really let it get to me
these days as much as I might be projecting.. These are just things that
don't change at the ravEs. Me? Well, if you have seen me in the past, and
you saw me last night BEFORE 4AM you would have probably noticed a
substantial difference.

According to the Random House Colloege Dictionary...
CONGRATULATION:  1. the act of congratulating.  -interj. 2.
"congratulations!" (used to express joy or satisfaction in the success or
good fortune of another.)

In order to have a logical conversation, especially when it comes to
language, we must first agree on a common definition.  This is the purpose
of a dictionary.  It provides a common definition for each word of our
(confusing) launguage.  It is easy to misunderstand words and apply our
"personal" definitions, which are not always accurate.

My point?
1.  In the above definition of the word in question, I find no implication
of snideness or insult.  I think "congratulations" was an appropriate
comment to make.
2.  Use your dictionary when in doubt of the meaning of a word.  That's
what it's there for!

Here's to understanding and commonality...

Hey, Man!! I saw no such thing there!@@!
Was it just me, or was there none?  And where was the virtual reality
stuff?  The Atari 2600's, as one of my friends suggested?  hmmmm...
Anyway, I had a lot of fun at Megga Buzz Mania, so I'm not complaining.....
I would have been smothered, maimed, killed in the Bouncy Panda anyway ;)
THANKS big time for the drinking fountain...my suggestion.....add another
one, please!  Nah, I'm satisfied. Where else but at a rave do you see
people dancing in line? ;) :) :)
Peace...

Im glad that you had a good time. :)   

I sincerely apoligize for the bounce castle and virtual reality not
being at the party.   The Amusement company that was suposed to provide
them never showed up.  I talke to the guy on tuesday and thursday, and
both times he reasured me that he was going to be there.  Im not sure
why he flaked on me like that, but it realy bummed me out.  especialy
since I got a generator 3 times biger than what was needed to have the
power to run the VR and Bounce House.  And we left that big space next
to the fence for the house, and the big opening in the loading dock next
to RaveMart for the VR land.  

We tried, and do apoligize for them not being there, and I feel realy
bad about it.  

I wope that the Chill-Henge provided something for people to bounce
around on, and Low-Teck Land gave people a sorta VR experiece.  And I
hope everyone had a wonderful time.  

Keep It real

Vlad

-->	I've heard that there is/was a good deal of exchange between the
goth world and rave dimension.  My friend Keith went from goth to raver
but is presently stuck in Britpop :P .  Then again, maybe Keith isn't a
good example after all.  I still go to goth clubs now and then since some
of my friends would rather go to Rodrick's Chamber than Ultra.  I don't
know if reversion from raver to goth ever occurs?

the new techno music made is very similar to Industrial from some years
past.  The pounding bass and metallic fills aren't that disparate, and
with the screaming of Prodigy's "vocalist" in the background they could be
the same.  I am probably making a fool of myself by learning that later on
that the Prodigy has always been played in industrial rooms and Dead Can 
Dance in ambient rooms :)  .  However, as it often occurs, I just listen
to the music; my knowledge of names thereof is quite limited.

Right on!  I never really liked Wham! or George M. when they were actually
poplular, but right after high school I studied abroad in Japan and my part
time job was working as a host in a Karaoke House where I would sing such
classics as Careless Whisper, Last Christmas, and Kissing a Fool... yicks!
But the customers loved it!  Turns out that they were pretty fun and
somewhat challenging to sing too.  Anyway, when I got back from Japan I met
this girl (a love at first sight almost Romeo and Juliet level intesity
relationship) and she had been a big fan of all that 80's music growing up.
 So, I was always singing that stuff to her (she also loved all that old
Duran Duran - like Save a Prayer) and now it brings back some pretty cool
memories...  Now when I hear a song, I try to sit back and listen to it and
not judge it by the styles it trys to invoke but whether it actually says
something interesting or is well done (I give it a 9; it has a good beat
and you can dance to it!). I especially try not to judge other people by
the music they listen to because I think that is just a judgemental trap.
Now I meet the greatest people who listen to the worst music!  But it's all
good!

-->	Yes I was serious, don't you know how much energy it takes to rave
sober for 6 hours straight?  Besides, I had a mega-huge sleep deficit
from the first week of classes to overcome.  However, it was all for
naught because I had to help a friend in distress at the last minute.  I
had to drive to the sunset and support her through a family death.  I
love parties, good-vibes, and making new raver friends, but you gotta take
care of your old friends first...otherwise you're a shit and not deserving
of the label "friend."  I don't consider this type of thing as duty or
obligation, it makes me feel good to help a friend in trouble because I
genuinely love her and a relationship requires a mutual exchange of
support between two people; heaven knows how many times she has been
there for me.  And you know what?  The weekend will always be there, but
your best friends will sometimes be in a different city, country, time, or
are simply unreachable; that's when you treasure all the times you had
together...through thick and thin :)

My friend was making a video of MeggaBuzz so a few of us could have copies.
 But He put the camera down on my friend's blanket by the speakers in back of
the main room.  Someone stole the entire camera case, which had our MeggaBuzz
video, the camera, and his car keys.  Luckily, his car keys were recovered,
but the camera was not.  If anyone knows about this or saw the camera (or
even just the tape) please let me know.  The footage is all the candy ravahs
and shots of dancing at the parties.  IF you could help me out I'd really
appreciate it, and I'm sure my friend would love to get his video camera
back.  I think it was a Hitachi.  THANX!!

-->	I am still trying to finish my '80s synth pop collection and am
almost done with my disco collection.  I like music of almost all types
including:

White Lion--"when the children cry"
Johnny Mathis--"chances are"
Michael Jackson--"ben"
Van Morrison--"tb sheets"


	I can't get rid of any of my music (unless it is _really_ bad)
because there are so many associations accompanying them; I mean, what
would all of our escapist movies be w/o a soundtrack.  Music defines an
era, and like scent, it is a powerful memory trigger. Now if they only
invented a scratch and sniff CD that would stimulate your inner ear :)

Hey everybody! I'm finally back. I saw all my family I hadn't seen in 7
years. I ate so much food and did soo much stuff.

These are foods that unfortunaly americans will not be able to taste
without flying south:

Dulce de leche = caremelized milk (delicious)
sandwiches de miga = sandwiches with a special bread
milanesa = like deep fried fish only its meat (good)
empanada = no transaltion (delicious!!)
facturas = like donuts but soo much better

Oh and also who ever said there are no raves in Buenos Aires, Argentina
doesn't know nuttin!

Yes there are raves in Buenos Aires. They are very very differnt all
together too. These are differnces:

There are mass quantities of alcohol and marijuana.
Hardly any other types of mind altering substances (including Xciting
cookies)
The music is nothing but rave/hardcore techno. Lots of buzzing noises
and sirens. Great DJs!!!
They dance so oddly. They bounce like they do when you are just grooving
to the music but they also do this robotic/liquid type stuff. But not
like in Seattle or LA or NY. Its different all together! And the other
half can't dance. NOBODY does the Home Base shuffle or our trademark SF
bounce.
NO FUN FUR!!!!
ALOT of silver and plastic. They dress hellza cyber looking.
They have hippi ravers, label hoes (tons of sick ass adidas), candy
ravers, about %50 cyber ravers, ass hole ravers, etc. etc.
And yes!! They even have club kids.
The vibe is way more mature yet incredibly insecure because of the
alcohol. But there is no violence or "thugs". Really nice positive
people. Its a new scene only like 3 years old. I had a lot of fun and
its a great experience.

Finally I am glad to be back and am gonna go to something this weekend
so i can see you all. 

Oh and i have flyers for Argentina too!

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

P.S. Now i must check my email!!!

My family,

I'm looking for rave mixes in CD format, and I'm not talking about those 
commercially market ones - for some unexplain reasons I don't like them 
as much.  Maybe I'm just used to the DJ's here.  I will glady donate $$ 
for a couple of such CDs.  Please advise me.

Hugs&Thanks,

Well shoot!! Yesterday I decided to take my daughter ice-skating
and I end up slipping on the ice and breaking my freakin' leg!!!
Aaaccckkk!!! Spiral fracture of the tibia (shin bone). GREAT X-rays! 
Probably will have to have surgery.

So I guess this is nature's way of telling me to lay off the raving
for a few months!! *sigh* I'm sure gonna miss you guys...

Send some healing vibes and I'll be back in front of the stacks as
soon as I can!

Love and hugs!

good grooves and grease up my dancin' shoes today.  Since Ultra is
cancelled, the only other info. I got was Electric Fondue @ Cat's Grill
and Real Audio @ 1600 Market, oh, and Black's House @ Coco Club.  Are any
of these good, or should I go to the free ones at Haight?  I am so
confused...I really want a good vibe. Thanks :)

You never heard of the Home Base Shuffle? Or the SF bounce?
The SF bounce is what other ravers i know from other scense describe the
way we dance. We do a lot of jumping and hoping and stuff. More than
most scenes as i have scene from observing LA and Buenos Aires,
Argentina.
The Home Base Shuffle???? If you don't know what that is then you need
serious help :)

Area, I would love to know!!!!!

If you haven't tried them, you're missing out on some of the yummiest food

Hiya Folks,

Well, after being the South Bay laggers that we were, we finally made it 
down to Mega-buzz around 3:00 and although I would have liked to make it 
there earlier I have to say....It was WELL worth it!

Macadio and Vertigo...

You guys rocked the house...no wait you guys rocked the world!...no, try 
the UNIVERSE :)Best set I've ever heard in my 9 months of raving.

Deepfog...

You rocked the universe as well...PHAT! ambiance room vibe, all smooth, 
all funky. BTW thanks for the moment of glory :) CANT WAIT for the 
scorpio bash!

Like Vlad said, "it's not a massive, it's just a really big 
underground"...well, it definately did feel that way! Keep up the awsome 
work vlad, I was only there for four hours but it was well worth it.

Trice I am very sorry about what happened but I would like to add that
the same thing happened to me and Victoria's friend Kate at the last
mega buzz. I guess some things never change. Except the fact that they
stole her rave bag with her wallet in it. WE found the bag and her
wallet. They stole $100 or so and her bra and pantie card!

Geeze people. I can't believe some of you don't know what I am talking
about. This has only been the UG Raver inside joke of the past 6 months.
You know those clubbers that go to raves at Home Base (Megga Buzz) the
people who can't tell the difference between trance and breakbeat and
think its all just deep house. Well.. those people usually go and freak
at the Home Base raves. Like they do at clubs. So the term Home Base
shuffle has become an AKA for freakin'.

Please tell me I am not living in a fantasy world and tell me some of
you know what i am talking about!!!

I suppose the "milanesa" is what in Italy we call "Milanese" or "Milanese
steak" and in the rest of the world (Argentina apart :) is called "Wiener
Shnitzel" (not really sure how you spell it, I call it "Milanese" :)

So, I don't know if I have to suggest you the fast-food chain with the
same name "Wiener whatever", but you can try...

Now Hold Up, Wait a Minute...
What does being a clubber have to do with knowing music?  I would consider
myself more a clubber than a raver.  I started out a raver and moved on to
clubs for the more mellow vibe.  Does this mena I have a limited
understanding of music?  I think you might want to LABEL (that is what
you're doing, right?  I'm gonna tell the Karma Patrol!) these people as
mainstreamers, not clubbers.  There are plenty of underground clubs with
music other than deep house.

If you're going to label people, at least get your labels right.
Megan

p.s. - I have never "freaked" in my life.

LIFE, LIGHT, LOVE & PLUR

SOLUTION TO THE STATE OF THE WORLD

Theres so many problems around us today.  Its frustrating and depressing to
say the least.  To try to overtake or fix the many problems where can and do
you start at.  In reality we cant take on all these immense problems we see
around us, for they are to large, and our lives require to much for us to
give the focus to the time and attention needed.   

There is a possible solution to the problems of the world and a way to a
happier existence.  Its not a new message but a new delivery of it.  The
solution starts with You and then goes to Us. We cannot change everything
around us for it simply wont, but we can change ourselves.  We can grow and
become the best people we can be which in turn has an affect on all things
around us.  People are affected by those around them whether its positive or
negative and nowadays its mostly negative.  Most people live in so much fear
of everything around them.  Fear only paralyzes us and makes things worse
(remember the saying frozen with fear).  Thats whats happening.  We are
focusing to much on the bad things and the problems which only magnifies
them.  What we need to do is start to focus on positive changes and
solutions; how this  starts is with each individual person.  

We must do our best to have a positive attitude and start practicing Peace,
Love, Unity and Respect.  PLUR.  As we do this it starts to be created and as
it is created it then becomes reality.  How things become created is with our
thoughts and emotions.  They provide the blueprint for the reality we live
and see.  This is happening  whether people are aware of it or not just as
many things are happening everyday without peoples awareness of it.  Your
thoughts and emotions become your experiences (fears/negative as well as
faith/positives).  We are responsible for our own fate in that what we think,
the attitudes and prejudices we hold, and how we treat ourselves and others.
 These are infinitely reflected back to us.  

Most dont realize this but as you show them the see it because they are
thousands of examples and demonstrations in our lives on how this is done (a
sick mans thoughts are on his sickness, while a poor mans thoughts are on
what he doesnt have) all manifested as they are feed into the creating
energy of the universe.  Just look at your own life and try to see it such as
something you always wanted and strive so hard to get did you not receive it,
and if not, most times later you find out it was better that you probably
didnt get it.  To take it to the next step our thoughts as a whole (every
person) then collectively creates our society we live in.  Each person
contributes to society and nation as each individual life of each cell of the
body contributes to the whole of  who you are.  If there is a problem we see
around us individually or as a society we must look to ourselves as the cause
of it.  Many dont like to think this way because they want to point fingers
at others and say no its them over there.  Well its time to wake up for we
all are doing it together.  Maybe we didnt even create it but we are
accepting it and not doing anything about it.  If we are doing this then we
are allowing it to stand and supporting that which we dont like around us.
 The problem is we have been focusing to much outwards to fix the problems
but the real answers lies inward (with-in us).  

Whats this answer you say?  Its so simple and yet so complex.  We can
become better people and strive to live PLUR in our everyday lives, and then
we can make changes around us by own living and being.  We extend and spread
out our vibe to those around and if its positive then its returned to us
and if its negative its also returned to us.  It was once said long ago Do
unto others as you would have them do unto you  If we all truly practiced
this in our everyday lives, IMAGINE where our society and the race of man
would be right now.  We would be much further evolved in spirit and mind and
we wouldnt have most of the problems we are all facing as we look out around
us now and see our future ahead of us.  

We are constantly creating our life around us with our thoughts and emotions
are feeding into some unseen energy ,which then responds to and produces
visible results which we see and live as reality, individually and
collectively.  The law of cause and effect is operating on the spiritual and
mental levels as well as the physical level.  The causes on these levels in
our thoughts and emotion with life and reality the effects.  We usually dont
relate the in-world with the out-world but they are very connected indeed.
  We as a race of man just havent truly understood that we are all
interconnected with each other as our own cells in our body as interconnected
with each other.  Our quality of live truly does depend on the quality of
life of those around us and their happiness.  No man is an island, let us
remember our interdependence and start to live in TRUTH.  We are One people,
One nation, One spiritual race.  The physical is the least who we truly are
but really the most apparent.  Since its the most apparent it hard to look
past, but we must or else its going to get worse for us all.

As we live and practice love, light, and life(living) these positive energies
are then returned into our lives.  This is the HOUSE and happiness we all
feel at a party (hopefully many of you tonight are experiencing it as you
read this and will continue to as the night goes on).  We come to celebrate
life, people, and love amongst each other, and we create a higher unity; a
higher way of living and being.  We are all responsible for the good time we
all have because we all  add to it and create it together.  The more you give
to it the better you feel.  There is a scary part though is its not normal
for this world to know what we know.  

The world we are in practices separation and fear while we are practicing
love and unity.  They are now persecuting us for partying and sharing the
great time together we are sharing.  This is not the truth of the matter.  We
are light, love, and life.  We are practicing and living a better way of
life.  We seek Truth and are living and having fun.  This is not wrong, but
what life is really about.  Whats the point of living if you are not happy
and feeling good.  This makes life exciting and makes the hard work of life
enjoyable.  Its  necessary that we have fun for it is healthy for us and in
addition creates a better world it does this because when we are healthy and
happy we do better at living, work, relationships, and practice PLUR  the
best.    They are trying to portray to the masses something else.  They fear
who we are and what we are doing.  They use the media tool to convince many
younger people parents and the general public (who dont know what it is all
about) as we are evil crazy drug users.  They use the worst case scenarios
at what can happen at a party or anywhere for the matter as the rule rather
than the exception.  

Everywhere you look bad things are happening.  The worst killer right now is
alcohol, but its still freely celebrating on every corner in America.  We
all know more people are dying from drunk driving than any other thing but
are they covering this, No, they are covering what they dont like and
picking us out.  We are a culture(ravers) who generally speaking ,are not
into drinking, getting all fucked up, being depressed and hurting other
ourselves or those around us.  We are about positivity and love.   They are
not promoting these ideals in our culture.  All they do is show the violence
and problems of the world.  They teach us these things as we grow up through
television and movies and you learn at a young age how adults deal with
other adults; the old fashioned way go duke it out or go to war and kill each
other.  We are doing so much good for ourselves and others in partying, for
where we are is the celebration of the true individual, life, light, and
love.  Its truly about PLUR.  Remember this as you party and stick up for
who and what we are for it is right and good.  Those that are here who are
not about these things I hope you will eventually see the beauty of this and
want to embrace it and contribute your part to it and see and know that is a
better living than the old way.  This is the Future for mankind and we are
the start of it.  Its much more fun and beautiful to live on this planet
when those around us are practicing these ideals.   It makes life alot more
enjoyable and actually very exciting.  How many people out there in the old
world are feeling this.  Very few!

Know one thing, that you are right in what you are doing.  Be extremely proud
of who you are and what you are doing for its good and righteous(right-use).
 You are not problem but the answer and solution to the problem.  If you
practice a better way of thinking and living you are on the right track and
the reward is so wonder-full not only for you and others but for the world
as a whole.  You are and will live a full and complete life while those who
dont do what you and we are doing are leading  an empty and illusionary
life.  They have no great fulfillment in Life while everyday of our lives can
be and is fulfilling as we choose it to be.  I have great respect and
admiration for any and all who are trying to do better in living and treating
others.   This is not only good for those around you, but its the best for
you.  If you havent tried this way yet release your fear, stick your feet in
the water(youll find its warm) and try practicing PLUR.  Its such a better
way of living and its so much a happier and  joyous experience of life to
partake of.  

We are all mostly here for one common reason and this is HOUSE.  We are here
to have a good time, so make sure and have it, but also dont forget about
your neighbor next to you, their happiness is also interdependent on yours,
for it creates a higher happiness HOUSE for you to.  Let us realize this
Truth and contribute to others happiness and help make it for them; as we
do, we truly make our own, for ALL IS INFINITE REFLECTION AND INFINITE
REFLECTION IS ALL.  Our better life lies in our positive thoughts and
emotions and also in helping others to have a better and more fulfilling
life.  We all magnify and multiply each other as we do this.  PLUR.  When we
come together as people in HOUSE  and in the spirit of unity its not just
one person and one person = two person, but really one person squared =  1 or
two persons squared = 4 or three persons cubed = 27 and so on.  

This magnified number value is an example of the higher HOUSE AND UNITY we
create together collectively.  The more people in it the more magnified and
glorious it becomes.  We create something more than who we are and we all
feel the rush of it and benefit from it but remember one thing it starts with
each person and then us.  Some will  feel what Im talking about but many by
their own choosing miss out.  They and You dont have to though it is for all
people and its thrilling to share and experience with others.  Dont let it
slip you by and dont try to be so cool (scared) that you dont experience
it.  This is cool and right and those that knock it are the fools and are
only losing out.  We can all feel the PLUR together and share in this
wonderful energy freely. 

We can change the world this way in simply doing and continuing on with what
we are already doing.  We are the future.  While the out-world speaks the
message of brotherhood, we are living and feeling it here and Now.  We are
manifesting action of the right way of living and being.  Be proud of the
beautiful person you are and that is within you, for I AM.  Respect and
worship it and appreciate those around you who are beautiful people.  Let us
focus on what unites us not what divides us and also lets try to build each
other lives and other people selves rather than attacking and bringing them
down.  Let us appreciate our differences as more interesting and exciting
that they are there.  Try and rid yourself of prejudices and limitations of
mind as soon as you can and be truly FREE again.  Throw off the shackles of
mental and spiritual slavery we have been sold into.  Release negativity and
hatred and let love and faith fill you up.  We can beat this problem world
together as a Unity and One House One Team/Tribe/Nation/People.   The
truth of each and every person is we all have the same spiritual and mental
source of our beings.  We are a Family in ONE CREATOR, who created us.
 Remember this and let it give you strength and a feeling of release and
freedom.  A wise man once said Ye shall know the Truth and it shall set you
Free.  This is our birthright True Freedom on all levels of being. (spirit,
mind, soul, and body) This is our truth we can and are NOW sharing with each
other as we choose it and create it to be.  We are One People, One Source
Tribe.  Let us unite in PLUR NOW and FOREVER MORE!  Truth is in ONE.

Mad Props to all of you!  Keep shining and being beauty-full!!!!! The Good
Life is NOW!!!

LOVE, LIGHT, LIFE & PLUR NOW AND FOREVER MORE!!!      Brandon

Hmmm.
 What does the "freakin" dance look like? Are you talking about the after
hours rail dancers (show girls) that rarely goto ravEs? Or are you talking
about thoughs kind of people that think the "dip" looks sexy, and listening
to Wild107.7 is cool?
 You know what I trip off is all the high school stoners gone acid head you
see at the ravEs. It's cool, I would have gone to ravEs when I was like
that. I got an allowance too when I was a teen-ager you know.

Hey wait a minute.
 Is the "freakin" dance the slow dance gone hip hop, where you bend your
knees and lock legs with your partner, while you both shaking your hips?
The bite off the dance from the movie Dirty Dancing?
 I used to love that dance! That was like my Saturday night thing! Thats
why I would always wear boxers to the clubs! And I was like the best.
Hmmm.. Last time I did that was probably the week before my first ravE and
first hit of E. Trippy..


 =]:. ...
My dance is called CRAZY though,  awight.

ouch...but dont let a little Spiral fracture of the tibia stop you from
coming out to party. I see people come thru the doors in wheelchairs.
You dont have to dance to have fun and help create a good party.
I really enjoyed going around at some of the outdoor partys this year
handing out sliced fruit and tootsie pops...its really nice and something
that everyone should try sometime. We can have a little pre party
and paint your cast in day glow colors, cover you with glitter and fill
your back pack with tootsie pops...we could even put springs
on your crutches if you feel you just have to dance.

Are you kidding?  "Love Missile F-111" would sound great in the middle of a
good happy trance set sometime.  Just beef up the bassline with the EQ.

Okay Can anyone pleeeease remember back in May=FGE 
EXPERIENCE?  Great if you can I would really love to get ahold of 
some-any mixes from that night & if anyone could direct to someone 
or where I might be able to find the stuff it would be great.
	Especially if the mixes were from the earlier part of the 
night from the BIG room with the dancing laser chics & djs that were 
played above everyone, you know it was the room that was next to the 
hall that was the chill space from Planet Rock.  I think that the 
Djs were like Pascal & Saint, etc... look at your flyers, help me 
please, the music that night was the BEST and it was a night not ot 
forget for me.

			PLEEEEASE HELP ME!!!

AAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!  C'mon man, I was trying to forGET about
that...  I was so ugly those days my mother even told me so...

And Peter Murphy brings back memories of a not-so-carefully-chosen "I
forgot to take my Lithium today so I'm throwing lamps at my mom"
boyfriend...  Who, I should probably add, idolized and SANG like Peter
Murphy (but, IMHO, was a helluva lot cuter)...  And fucked up my head so
bad I almost took "Cuts you Up" a bit too seriously - bad thing to listen
to during that fucked up adolescence thing...

As far as goth-girl f*(king, nah, not too bad...  At least that's what I
was told, hehehe...

okay, i beg to differ - last night i went to one of those parties that ends
up being mediocre all around (i'm talking party favors, too, until the end
of the night when i chanced on something good) - only good thing about that
party was #1) aphrodite's set, and #2) these cool people we met from Ithaca
that ended up crashing at our place (rare occurrence you bring people home
in nyc)...

anyway, aphrodite's set was so funky - I about had it with the stale house
being played downstairs and was kinda depressed, thinking i was going to
have a boring night - was excited about terry mullan, set was stale...
excited about markie mark - set was WAAAAY stale...

went upstairs to the jungle room and the butt started moving and then it
was alright...

I myself just have this sneaking suspicion that all those big peeps were
getting tired of us still dwelling on the Kennedy-Onassis thing...

Now we got our own conspiracy theory for the nineties!  Who's come up with
the best one so far?

Wow, Megan's at it again...  :-)

I dunno tho, it's too bad she didn't party - I think i'd be a bit sick to
my stomach if i was about to die and i hadn't yet experienced it,
personally...

Gotta say tho, I don't think I would have gone about any measly attempt at
changing the world if I hadn't gone out a bunch...

I dunno, it makes me NICERS - when I go a while without a big release I'm a
nasty-ass cranky bitch...  I wouldn't care about the rest of the world...

But, boy I feel nice this morning - got to dance my ass off and I went to
this party with the sorest back and danced it all out - that was even
better than just going and dancing my ass off, cuz after I was done I felt
even better than usual...

And, I'm still psyched about these groovy people we brought home with us -
and they left us some tasty nugs that were so wet & sticky they had to cut
it with scissors - I just walked over to where they put it and let's just
say I don't even normally BUY this much...

Oh well, since I slept until 7 again (did it yesterday too) I am off to
take a shower and make a pathetic attempt at immersing myself in the "real
world" for an hour or to so I can adjust to the fact that the weekend is
already over...

Actually, the "Wiener whatever" restaurant serves only disgusting hot
dogs, but since Amerikkkans think a "wiener" is a hot dog, they don't
see the name of that fast food puke shack as a misnomer. 

Wiener actually stands for "from Wien" in German, and "Wien" is also
known as "Vienna" (austria) so a "Wiener Schnitzel" is actually a
schnitzel from Vienna. It's actually breaded, fried veal, and is
pretty tasty until you learn about veal...

Veal is little innocent calves kept in a tiny box with their head
clamped so they can't move, while fatty food substances are pumped down
their gullet even when they're not hungry. Then they kill these cute
littly fluffly calves early so that people can eat their fatty and
tender meat...

Hell, i became a vegetarian for a while after i saw how veal was created...

PS: w/r/t vegetarianism, i got better -- hell, i ate at In and Out Burger
in Grass Valley CA on my way back from burning man...

PPS: I'd love to see people name their favorite restaurants in the
Mission serving south and central american specialities....

Actually, my california buddy i was partying with sunday night called it
the "SF Shuffle" that he was doing - hmm...  I don't know if we have a name
for the way east coasters dance...  I guess the balto/dc kids do?  The
baltimore hop or something?  dunno, it's all like, "Face your friend, twist
your cap around your head while you spin, and hop around like you're GOING
to breakdance but you don't know how yet" - they're still all really good
dancers tho, sometimes it's hard to bust out down there...

These are foods that unfortunaly americans will not be able to taste

Dulce de leche = caremelized milk (delicious)
sandwiches de miga = sandwiches with a special bread
milanesa = like deep fried fish only its meat (good)
empanada = no transaltion (delicious!!)

When I was in Buenos Aires, I developed a serious empanada habit.
I was forced to join Empanadas Anonymous to regain control of my life.

burning man '97 was another incredible experience.  They took a little bit
of the anarchy out of the event by making roads and designated camping
areas.  The arranged it so you camped on the "Shore" of the playa, making
an avenue on the beach where all the major theme camps were.  All the major
art projects, main stage, ect. were out on the empty playa.  The event
was kept very concentrated geographically, so you could easily walk to any
point of party.  They were successful in keeping the number of cars way
down.  At night the entire shore was lit up with crazy stuff, and did
indeed look like a city.  The dust was kept down to a minimum.

A few highlights:  the hot springs.  Dancing to an 6 hour Goa Gill set
through the incredible desert sunrise.  The sunset with 360' colors.
Bianca's smut shack/lounge.  Vmar's pedal-powered smoothies.  TAZ's mud.

It sounds like this might have been the last BM becuase of financial problems.
That would be a real shame...

Subject: the playa 


hello =)

	i have 
rescieved messages that you've been calling, however last week was a 
very hectic one with the impending excursion into the desert for labor 
day weekend. burningman 97 was nothing short of amazing, mind blowing, 
and magical. there were a lot more people this year, but at the same time 
it was very well organized. many memories reentered my consciousness 
from last years bman, constantly being reminded with the surrounding 
playa and general madness weaving its way thru camp. i am forever altered 
by this years expereince. sitting here in normal reality at home my mind 
keeps wandering thru the many enchanted experiences that are now memories.
	The playa this year was considerably less dusty and not quite as 
extreme with its weather conditions. Black Rock City was very much more 
dense this year, this occuring at the request of the organizers who made 
several alterations in its setup. In addition to to more dense campsites, 
the city was designed for bicycling and walking around as opposed to 
driving, which was very discouraged. Also with being located at teh edge 
of the playa, there was much less of a need to drive across the desert. 
(no driving by vectors across vast expanses of desert this time).
	I resided at the Lyceum camp this year, also referred to as TAZ 
(Temporary Astonishment Zone). In addition to the camping section of TAZ, 
some distance out into the playa Rob Rayle and Randy Cone placed their 
soundsystem. This featured three nights of full on psy trance, plus lots 
of other stuff such as: live ambient, an electronic drum circle, and a 
few other random musical experiments -- some of these acts, of course, were 
done in the nude. Rob Rayle and I provided teh psy trance as it got late 
in the eveings, playing what we called gil sets. (this a reference to the 
length of them, as goa gil's sets tend to last at least half the nite) 
The playa and the many intrepid travelers weaved their spell dancing as 
we played our favorite tracks.  
	The peak of burningman was most definetly sunday nite with the 
burning of the man, as well as a full on CCC party on main stage -- 
lasting well past sunrise on Labor Day. The CCC event was guided by 
Kode IV and Goa Gil...
	After the burn i decided to walk out into the 
desert far away from town. A strange thing i noticed was that the 
farther one walks out into the playa, the muddier the ground became. 
Rather strange, but it began to make sence after a while -- the playa 
being an ancient lake bed. The stillness and emptyness of the desert had 
its influence on my wandering mind, and feelings of connection ran thru 
my body. connected to the earth, and connected to the billions of stars 
above, peaking out in between some clouds overhead. 
	...The pounding trance eventually lured me back to the main stage, 
where balcklites and psy banners surrounded many dancers. The dust 
floating around gave it a very dreamy feeling, as if looking at a hazy 
vision in the desert nite. i spent most of sunday nite here, with 
occassional excursions into Black Rock City. The sunrise was monumnetal. 
As the rosy fingertips of dawn gave way to fiery red bursting across the 
horizon, people turned around and began running out into the desert 
chasing the coming rays of sun. A mythical feeling of unity and feelings 
of 'home' filled my mind. After so many crazy experiences in the playa, i 
realized how much this ritual, the psy trance gathering, was really home 
to me. In looking around at everyone i thought how amazing it was for our 
family to come together hundreds of miles away in the middle of nowhere 
to celebrate our existence. 
	This concluded the desert madness -- it was time to head back 
to the bay area. Filled with dreamy remembrances of a magical time: Troy, 
Meri, Melanie and I dismanteled our campsite and headed out -- leaving 
the playa behind -- but taking with us our life changing experiences.

Troy, how about elaborating on the Goa Gil set? Was it in fact Goa Gill 
himself or "Goa" style trance?  Also, from DAT or tables?  I'm really 
into goa music now and this fascinates me!

I find this to be the key, (music), that unlocks so many memories! I
keep music much like someone would keep photos. I have never been much
of a picture taker. One of my favorite rekkids is "Youth Brigade" and
it
reminds me of my youth as a "punk skater" living on the streets of
L.A.  I look at myself now, I thought I would be dead for sure by the
time
I was 27, I never imagined that I would be where I am. I'm goin' off
track here you get my point. Without music I would have nothing to
touch
off those memories good and bad. Its good to remember.

Oh me!!!  Please!!!  I can lift big crates full of stuff... I can dust
them off and hand them to you too!  It'll be just like Keoki... but
better, because you don't spin crappy records (dug your stuff at
Lepidoptera!).

If for some reason your record crate is a bad idea for you to be carrying,
I'd recommend a small luggage cart and a Az-Iz box and a bungee cord.  Not
that I take this advice myself.  Some of my favorite memories in the world
are not being able to find a parking spot near the dance studio, so I end
up walking 3-4 blocks through the Mission carrying my 80 something 
pound Anvil record case with a limp.  Yum.  I remember whenever
anything sucked that bad as a kid, my parents would tell me it built
character.

But it's cool, because as your arms stretch, you can reach three and
eventully four or more turntables with ease.  Plus, I suppose this never
really stops, and as I grow older I'll be able to pick up stuff off the
ground without bending over, which is good because my back is screwed up.

You know there ol' Deepfog, I hate to burst your bubble but I found out
some very interesting information today in my astronomy class.  The earth
actually wobbles along with the rotation and revolution thing.  This
means that the constellations that we all go by today are all wrong. 
These constellations were made 2000 years ago.  Since then, the earth has
wobbled some and those constellations that we all thought we were ours
actually are not.  I found out today that I'm actually Sagittarius.  To
find out your true sign, you'll need a star wheel to figure it out.

Point being, if you think your Sagittarius, check again to make sure.  If
you don't know how, feel free to send me your birthdate (month and day
only) and I'll let you know what you're true sign is.

Just thought I'd help out anywhere possible.  :o)

Bye Bye

     Peace all,
     
     Well, this was quite a night...
     
     We got there at 11:00. It was nice to see a line for people who had 
     bought presale tix! Strong po-po presence, but they were harmless. 
     Approached with trEats quickly(I was worried about getting ripped 
     off), they were fantastic. Then the real party began.
     
     It was nice to see a overhead with all the DJ's listed and where they 
     would be playing. Helped greatly. At 12:30-1:00, there was still room 
     to walk, and places to chill on the mattresses, however past 1:00am, 
     the place just blew up... Many many many many many many people, from 
     everywhere!! Very cool vibe though... Didn't see any brawls or 
     problems.. The outdoor setup was nice, you could be chilling, watching 
     a DJ work, and right behind him, you'd see a nice backdrop of the 
     Oakland coliseum. Would have been a great kodak moment!
     
     Atari 2600 rocks... The only thing that room needed was a DJ, playing 
     some mellow beats or something, but I guess you need a place to go 
     where it's just that, CHILL... 
     
     I think it was room 2, but I think they had the best sets all night, I 
     spent most of the evening, and morning there... And let me tell you, 
     with such a collection of people on one night, in one place, I think I 
     saw some of the best dancing I've ever seen!! People were jamming...
     
     Macadio, Fantastic! He was the only set I remember... I don't remember 
     hearing a bad set!...  
     
     Now, one item I did notice, and maybe I'm in the minority, and I am 
     not trying to start a flame war, but I did see a bunch a mack daddies 
     at this event. I mean alot of people looked like they came straight 
     from a club, and wanted to continue picking up on the honeys all 
     night.. Wow, players were out in full force. I feel bad for the ladies 
     who were not looking for that kind of attention.. There was nothing 
     wrong with it, I just know that isn't the reason I go to parties..
     
     Anyhow, I dig FGE, and some of the volunteers came out and were 
     shooting the shit with us, making sure everyone was having fun.. Very 
     cool, and important... I've never met Vlad, but congrats is in order.. 
     There was alot of hard work put into this, and it went off without 
     problems...
     
     Oh well, just my opinion. 
     
     Did you see the guy dressed up like the dude from toy story? I wished 
     his jet pack really worked.... Keep the peace! <JCO>

Weird...

 I don't recall seeing any of the people in these pictures, there at the
ravE.. I guess I like don't see much of anything when I go.. I just hear
alot of stuff. And I can't really be sure if what I hear is real or not
these days, because I hear the same things everywhere I go, even when no
one is around. So I am either hearing things that are only inside my head,
or I am reading minds or something. Both of which I think are
possibilities. And both of which make it really difficult to respond to
something someone says behind my back or while passing.. Be it someone
talking shit, or someone complimenting me.. I don't know if I am thinking
it or someone is really saying it..
 Anyways.. I guess I am just trying to say, that if someone gots something
to say to me, good or bad. Please do me a favor and say it to my face.. I
guarantee a positive response.. Because I am really an open person. And
alot more REAL than most ravErs I have watched in action.

 And another thing.. You know how when you are around alot of people, how
all the voices just sound like one steady tone or something. Well it's not
like that. For some annoying reason my mind is constantly trying to
decipher everything EVERYBODY is saying ALL AT ONCE.. And well, I think it
makes me alittle insane I guess.

 I guess I am not a people person..
 Jeeezz... There's something we haven't evaluated.... RavEs are like
suppost to welcome ALL. Why am I not welcomed then? You need to be out
going to be excepted in the ravE community... I get looked at like, well
screw you for not raising your hands and saying "HI!!! MY NAME IS JEFF!! I
LOVE YOU!!" And I don't give off bad vibes... I mean well, until I get
completely irritated with all the bad vibes I have to swallow. But other
than that, I am usually smiling and peaceful looking.. But NO!!! That's not
good enough, you have to jump in there face and come up with something
interesting to talk about to get respect. Actually not to GET respect but
to avoid disrespect.
 Because I am not asking for respect.. It's the blatant disrespect that
bothers me. And it should bother all of you too because everyone hears it,
and it's not right and it's spreading. And it is not my fault it's
spreading, unless I need to proove myself. But do I need to proove myself?.
 But it's all good, I am not tripping, complaining, or dwelling off this
unavoidable, totally predictable scene I keep going back to for some
reason. See you all in October at Funky Techno Tribe's Holloween Tribal
Massive, my next ravE. Most likely. Unless I find a girlfriend first.  =]

Jeff
Hope this doesn't annoying anybody.

The dip is a girl dance. Where they go down really low. Jerk your body to
the left and drop, jerk your body to the right and drop alittle more..
Left, right.. And when you go left both fisted hands go right. And when you
go right both fisted hands go left. It's really dumb looking. You know, one
of thoughs things that will be laughed at in the next century.


Peaz.

Hey Kids..

Well Saturday was a blast the long awaited Megga Buzz happened. It was
kewl Me and my trusty side kick Vertigo got off to a late start we
were running on Raver time. I wanted to get to the party kind of early
but I did not set my alarm and was like sleeping till 12:00 am. Could
it be cause I stayed up all night and most of the day on Friday for
the @spire party? Hmm... Ne-Wayz so me and Verts head out Making pit
stops on our way we make it to the party and are gretted by heat as we
walk in the door. it was hot and there were plenty of Folks walking
around some smilling some laughing some looking confused. the place
was set up nice I like lasers and visual thingies. The DJ's that I did
get to hear were throwind down. I got to hear Simon I have not heard
him in like a year or two and he was working the decks with some
progressive house. DRC was laying down some fierce Tekno traXX She
looked cute too like princess lia with a hair cut real short. She had
on the black suit that they wore in return of the Jedi. I and Vertigo
had a real good time we were a little nervous cause we did not get to
practice that much due to prior engagments so most of it was just off
the head. We got a lot of positive reinforcment from Friends and some
people that I had never met before. I Thank all you that came out to
support us. I would Like to Thank Vlad as well for giving me the
chance to display my talents to the masses. 


Highlights:

all the young beautiful ladies giving me smooches while I was playing.

The big laser that spelled out "Macadio & Vertigo" I always wanted to
see my name in lights or in this case Lasers.

The guy that grabbed my Ankle as I walked by and said that we
"floored" him it looked like he was having a good timEE 

The cute girl that asked my Name and looked very interested, but I was
to shy or was it to busy spinning?

Getting to play a good set with my Boy Vertigo!!! You go boy you know
your Ruff...


I love all of you Thanks for the Postive Energy!!!

Macadio

     Hello all,
     
     I was wondering if anyone knew about Portal 13 that is supposed to 
     happen on 9/13. The SFRaves calendar still lists it, but the recording 
     is back from their last party, CHI, which was a bad ass party.. Hoping 
     it will still happen, looking forward to it... Any information would 
     be HIGHly appreciated!!! Keep the peace! <JCO>

Ok this party seems to start out good.
Jer comes to my work and gets my coffin and Credit Card. (Don't ask
long story) So I get off work psyched about the party I will be
spinning that night I look at the directions and it does not say where
the party is I think "Shit how am I going to find the party?" it had
some girl Karens addy on it. Turns out that is the map point spot and
the party is like 3 blocks away from there. I get a frantic call at
9:00 saying they need my Needles and I am at Vertigo's house
practicing and shit. So I split that house and head to the party kind
of running late. I get there and sound is showing up I think hey this
is kinding of pushing it seeing how the party is supposed to start at
10:30 I think great every one is running on Raver time. But guess what
Jer is know where to be found and no one knows where to setup at. So
we hang there which seems like forever then we finally get to the spot
which I must say was one of the dopest beach locations I have been to.
Great nice pretty valleys etc. Did I mention you HAD TO WALK 3 MILES
to get to the beach? Well not that far but pretty far. I would like to
commend Jer for putting a lot of time and effort into the party but He
should have consulted DJ's and Sound on the location as it was a pain
in the ass to get to and load shit too. O BTW sorry My Credit card did
not go through I forgot it is Maxed out. Just made a payment today :P 
but Ne-Wayz the party did not start till 1:00 am all the DJ's times
got pushed back I was acting like a dick to Terrac and Dan Sorry guys
I just hate not getting able to play a complete full set. Bottom line
each DJ only played like Half Hour and I had a shitty mood and time.
:} I am a little fustrated with UG promoters not having there shit
together. I know that the cops and other things are to be considered
but some promoters should take not from some people that have been
doing it for while. Example the FGE party I was not tripping on shit I
went it handled my business and a good time was had by all. I am not
trying to down anybody just pointing out simple facts. Jer is still my
boy but next location please consult DJ's and Sound FIRST!! Thanks for
everyone letting me Vent if you have read this far. O BTW the DJ's
were good as Hot chocolate on a cold morning. Pistachio rocked so did
Todd and Terrac we have to play back to back one day!! Dan well I have
seen him many times as we has seen me we are both kind of bored of
each other I would think? He had new shit and so did I though.
hehehe...

Love ya all..

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

Well, I'm rounding up my crew so I can organize a trip to super duper Oaktown 
for Big Top . . . I'm so excited, because I recently came into some money so I 
might be able to go to more than one of these huge expensive events.

So I was wondering:  Who's going to . . .
1.  Big Top?
2.  Electric Highway?
3.  Lifeforce?
4.  Cyberfest?
5.  see Daft Punk @ the Filmore?

I want to go to all of them, plus some non-massive parties too (like the 
Pro-Soy event -- _Portal 13_ or something?), but I have to save some funds for 
the FTT(?) party on Halloween (my future husband Josh Wink is there, so you 
know I have to make my appearance).  But where are _you_ going?

Ghetto girl steps in to drop some knowledge:

The term "freakin" usually refers to the dance where 2 dancers interlock their 
legs (while facing each other) in the following fashion:  Dancer A's right 
leg, Dancer B's left leg, Dancer A's left leg, Dancer's B right leg.  Then 
they kinda sway side to side, dip down low, bend over, and do all types of 
rhythmic sex simulation.  You can also do this dance w/ both partners facing 
the same direction (girl in front).  This is called "gettin it from tha back."

A variation of the freak is the "dip."  The song breaks it down:  "I put my 
hand up on your hip / when I dip, you dip, we dip."  It, and most forms of 
freakin, pretty much look stupid, but some people seem to think it's sexy.  I 
think it's just an excuse to grind against somebody, like a lot of forms of 
dancing.  But hey, what's wrong w/ that?

This basic form of freak and many of it's variations are usually seen at hip 
hop/r&b parties, massives, and clubs.  This may sound like I'm talking shit 
but I know these things because I sometimes frequent these places.  Not 
_everyone_ at those places does it, but plenty do.  Although I haven't "gotten 
my freak on" for a very very long time, I have no problem w/ it as long as 
it's done in an appropriate place, i.e. not a rave.  Sorry.

I actually think the term "Home Base shuffle" is pretty damn funny.  I'm going 
to use that sometime soon.  Not that doing it is a bad thing.  Actually, it's 
one of the safest forms of sex, if you think about it.  Those people you see 
freakin @ parties, you should give them props.  Because they are behaving in 
such a responsible manner.  (oooo that's a stretch)

Wow, no-one's written a review yet??  I hope that doesn't mean that none 
of you went (except Ari Fubari who I had fun dancing with for a while!), 
because this WENT OFF!

Without a doubt, Spundae is the best club going in the (admittedly 
dismal) SF big club scene.  This shit is REAL - really good music and 
happy, positive groovers only.  Like someone I met as we surveyed the 
crowd from behind the big dj platform said, "This ain't no club.  This 
here's a PARTY!"  Now, I can't think of any other club (I'm not talking 
about UG-type weeklies, bless 'em) I could say that about.  If you know 
of something decent on a Friday or Saturday night, let me know 'cause I 
haven't found it!  

Incredible music made this night.  Dave Seaman of Cream, UK, threw down 
the best set of the night with a 2 hour+ set of hard trance in the main 
room at peak party hours (2-4, you know it!).  Everyone was yelling their 
heads off until the energy in that room was sky high.  I kept roaming 
after that because every single room was different but all going off.  I 
really like the intimate feeling of the smaller rooms at Spundae, and 
found more blinding trance in the basement (who was spinning??) that kept 
me there for quite a while.  Coming back up, I learned I had missed Doc's 
set, which bummed me because I haven't heard him and I'm out for the East 
Coast in a week :(  But I was kicking back near him behind the dj booth, 
and he turned and introduced himself to me!  I try not to make dj's into 
gods, but I think that was a nice modest gesture from someone who is 
probably inundated with enthusiastic (high) ravers when he spins out.

This was the last great night out for me and an extended group of about 15
of us, and a fantastic time was had for all.  The best for me was the
presence of a friend from school who was pretty straight and had never
really heard techno (but, like they all do, assumed she hated it).  Her
first e and Dave Seaman's set has changed that forever!! (evil laugh). 
She turned to me on the dancefloor as she was madly dancing and screamed,
"this is fucking awesome!!!"  I try to tell people when they think they
dislike techno that it is not passive listening, catchy music like we have
been trained to expect from music.  It is, IMO, primarily an EXPERIENTIAL
music, something you must abandon your body to and let those repetitive
beats work their magic until that zen state of TRANCE.  She said later, "I
heard it before, but I've never _experienced_ it."  Exactly. 

Very happy to see all friendly, positive dancers in the club.  No bad 
vibes anywhere.  

Only complaints for Spundae: the music was TOO loud in every room and gave 
everybody a headache by the end of the night, there was no place to 
really chill out, and it was overcrowded (and you know those damn ravers 
never leave til daybreak).  Plus making us throw out our water and buy 
those fucking $3 little bottles inside (but that's 1015, a - yep - club).

I'm going back to 1015 Friday night for DJ Dan's 3-hour set.  A challenge 
to my fellow ravers: show up in force!  Let's rescue clubland from the 
dreariness of the pick-up, non-dancer crowd.  The predominance of 
weak mainstream music in SF clubs (think WILD 107 house and tired-ass 
hiphop) is also really frustrating.  Most of mainstream clubbing really 
revolves around the alcohol/pick-up scene and there is precious little 
for that wonderful community we have, the DANCE scene.

Love to you,
N

I want to go to Big Top, cuz I came out here saying that there'd be more
opps for seeing live electronic music than where I used to live, so
dammit, I'm going...or at least I want to.  No one I know wants to,
though.  :(

Hi all!  ]=}

 Wow! This was an event that makes raves and *any* other festival look 
silly by comparison! The ultimate in sustained human surrealism!!

 Picture this; A flat, semi-dry lakebed (top was dry but there was mud 
just below the surface in spots) surrounded on all sides by pointed 
mountain tops. A bowl type effect. Within the bowl a crescent moon 
campground with a 40 foot wooden and neon lite man-like structure in the 
center of the lakebed, between the points of the crescnet moon campground.

 Everywhere you look (at nite) there are blinking lites; for miles! 
Strobes, whirling lites, fire eaters and dancers and the occasional art 
installation piece being burned. Nudity everywhere and lots of body 
painting and body adornment (I had my lingam painted and adorned). At the 
Esoteric Society of the Yummy Yoni they had a "twat squat". This was a 
place for women to squat and examine their twats and then compare them 
with with "archtype twats". Then they read a description about the 
archetype twat in a similar vein as a horoscope reading. (this camp was 
run by women)

 Another campsite had "bun registration". Here we had a design painted on 
our buns (I did this just before my lingam painting) which we pressed 
onto a canvas sheet and then signed. After we did the "4 cheek sneak" 
which involved passing a frisbee with our buns from one partner to the 
next and then back. Upon succesful conclusion of this we were given a 
very nice frissbee with the camp name and logo on it (a shaved headed 
woman with her butt prominately pushed foward with a brning man 
charachter catching a frisbee). and the words "Honor the Sacred Elements; 
Fire, Earth, Water and Air. Make Love. Choose Freedom".

 There was the biggest Telsa Coil I had ever seen (I didn't get to see it 
fired up tho), A house of doors, Bianca's Smut Shack (probably my fav 
camp site), flying people (on a paraglider with a fan strapped to the 
riders back), a giant lit up dragon fly, a golf course, a croquet camp 
(with flaming hoops) and sooo much more!

 The hot springs were divine! But the burning of the man was a sustained 
peak of pure release. Sorta a Mardi Gras parade, Rio De Janero (sp?) and 
and pagan fire dance rolled into one with about 14,000 attendees. 
Afterwords was the trance party with Ceiba/Kode IV and Goa Gil. The peak 
of that was watching a flame throwing (we are talking a 20 foot long 
tongue of flame with a huge fire ball and cloud of the blackest smoke) 
contraption wheel onto the dance floor and take aim right at the stage 
where Gil was nervously packing his tapes away as well as Adam from 
Ceiba. After a couple of minutes of frantic negotiations (and Gil played 
a track with a sample saying something about how fear makes your mind do 
things it normally will not do) the "monstor" was turned away to burn 
down other art installations still standing (after which it got stuck in 
the mud after unsuccesfully trying to destroy an ice sculpture).

 There was so much more of course but I'm simply not going to try to tell 
it all. I like to thank Troy and Neils and others for the Electronic Drum 
circle and of course thanks to camp TAZ for supporting our sound stage (I 
actually played about 5 hours of dance music for the first time in my life!).

 Big thanks and hugs to Rob Rayle and Julia Carter for making it possible 
for me to make BM 97!!

hugz,

Everyone,

I didn't get much time to see too many DJs ( I'll make sure to
give support next time) so I'll cut to the record chase.

There are certain instances in life when the energy becomes
one and things just begin to happen. the Energy given by the
folks in the crowd (you know who you are) trancended the music
to spiritual levels. This is what Love does. there was Great
love in that room, and I thank everyone. 

Macadio...Thanks for leading me with your experience, patience
and will. You truly led the set with Domination. 

Oh...BTW.. I had my first proposal by some mysterious woman
while we spun. I had to turn her down. You guys and the music
are the most important thing in this scene. With the vibe you
brought, it was multiplied. I've never felt it like this before.
Sooo....Let's Make More!

ok guys... here's the scoop, but before I begin, I want to appologize to
macadio, dan (micron), carlos (pistachio), terrac, todd manley, jeff 'n
ari, and anyone who wasn't able to have a good time.

quick summary:
 location had a cop sitting in front of it. =(
 cop leaves. =)
 we set-up. =I
 party's going strong! =)
 genny craps out! =(
 genny get's going! =)
 I get sick. =(
 genny's outta gas! =(
 genny get's fed! =)
 all in all the party people had a great time! =)

lesson learned! get a damn good generator!

ok.... the story. it all started with a precision plan and a lot of
faith. the plan was to get it all going by 11pm, but it didn't get going
till 1am. now the reasons this all happened. the day of the party I went
to get the genny, but my friends credit card was declined, and because
of that, we barely got a generator. They gave us a real shitty one
because we didn't have any kind of deposit. We all meet up at the map
point to discuss the plan and go over how the setup was going to happen.
Now if it all went smoothly we would of been setup way sooner than 1am,
but things weren't so smooth. People helping out kinda took some of the
plan as a joke and were in disbeliefe at some of the things we had to do
to get this party rolling. So I kinda worked around those ideas and just
winged it. (I will NEVER do that again). We head down to the location to
set-up, and uh oh..... po po sitting there. At first we thought someone
tipped off the police about the location, but we hoped to gawd that he
was just checking for speeders. As we scrambled a plan for back-up
locations, we positioned someone near the location with a cell phone to
watch the cop. 30 mins later we get a call saying that the cop was
leaving, but it kinda looked like he might come back. I pause to think
for a sec, and say, "fuck it! I have a good feeling about this, let's
use the location!" so  I send two trucks down to unload and tell them to
call me when they've unloaded so that the second two could come unload.
I never get the call.... so the second load heads over to see what
happened. We don't see the first group anywhere! I run down to the
actual spot we were going to use and don't see anyone. I run all the way
back  to find them back at the top! I had no idea where they were or
came from, and didn't have time to ask. We jump on the setup and get
moving. I had no idea that the trek to the spot would be so bad with
equipment. (thank  you guys that helped out!) they finally get going and
set up, and I take off to check the ticket take, check point, and map
point to make sure everything was going ok. Everything was going great.
Sound starts thumping, people started dancing, and everything was going
great. Then the genny started giving us major problems. It also was
about to run out of gas. So I take off to go get gas and by the time I
got back to the top of the hill, I could barely function anymore. I had
only gotten 15 hours of sleep durring the week (w/o drugs), and just
over did it that night with all the stress, running up and down the hill
5 times, and not drinking any water. I drove to the map point and had
the kids there go get the gas and take it back. From that point on I
don't know what happened with the party. I had no other choice to try
and recooperate, so that I could help with clean up in the morning. What
I heard was that the vast majority of the party peoples there had a
really good time and even when the music went out, they were still
having fun talking and meeting people. Regardless of that, I am sorry
for all the problems experienced. I, myself, am really upset with what
happened. I don't want you guys to have to make the best of it to have a
good time, I want it to be where you have no choice but to have a good
time!

                                                                my
sincere appologies,

just jer - @spire

Thanks to all who came out and supported us and the scene once again,
all of you kids were great! Thanx to all who helped out in any way, big
or small. Thanks to all the dj's who spun out. And special thanx to Jeff
and Ari, without them, we almost didn't have the heart thumpin' bass,
thanx guys!

once again... I'm sorry!

 Now we got our own conspiracy theory for the nineties!  Who's come up with

      I think that they staged the whole thing...think about it it was in a
tunnel so nobody could see, they placed the smashed car in the tunnel, and
the princess escaped out the other side, but the dunb picture people see the
smooched car and what looks like Di(who would really know with all the blood)
, but they put some look alikes in the car with a whole bunch fake blood. Her
guy 'died' too so they could escape together, and the choffeur 'died' to
throw everyone off  She wanted to get away from the media didn't she? So now
shes on some remote island chillin with Elvis...i'd like to think positivly
and say this is what really happened :o)

OK thats enough for today i'll give you the details if you really want them

have a good week,

hi!  it sounded like it was off dat's - the mixing was, well, basically 
16 beats of sludge followed by the next track...  the music was up and 
down, too - some of it sounded a little dated to me, but fortunately there 
were some beautiful tracks as well!  it was interesting to hear some 
breakbeats in there as well - done goa style!!!  and the production 
quality on the tracks was superb...

while i fully appreciate the dj's bringing in unreleased material to 
play, if their whole set is gonna be comprised of it, i wish that 
they would put a little more effort into making the tracks flow 
together...  maybe drop the $$$ for a cd burner and mix off of cd's...  
or if that isn't feasible, try creating special mixes for _dat_ - ones 
that have more washes or open sample spaces where it is easier to mix 
into a different track...  basically, _design_ the track for the medium 
upon which it will be played.

oth, my friend was a quivering mass of gelatinous hysteria during 
goa gil's set - he couldn't speak, just laughed and jumped up and down and 
danced and danced and danced...

dear everyone, 

i can't believe that i've waited so long to go to the burninman.

sheer joy and heat and suffering heatstroke and visiting with the aliens 
and discovering the alien in me and seeing massive sculpture.
/////////
the creativity was over abudant the community, if you worked hard at it 
was alive and pulsating. 

yes there were thefts and forms of capitalism and overdoses and cops and 
other problems, but 

              there was nakedness and sharing and ART!!! and jokes and 
communications and an amazing display of people who care about the same 
types of things that you do.  Well, at least i personally met 20 or 30 
of them and i like to think that i was not a spectator.  
the first 24 hours i was a spectator but then i got in the groove.

you know the one groove that makes you feel allright.

o.k. well on to the techno section.

despite the well publicized fact that there was not going to be a large 
scale rave this year, those of us housecats in the know found out where 
the parties were at any way.....

i first encountered this camp from colorado.  i met a guy named dan and 
another guy named bradley,  very nice people, I asked bradley if he 
heard of r.a.w. or hipp-E.  he said that he knew hipp-E and that of 
course he had been experienced on r.a.w

I played a nice 45 min set at their camp at about 4pm for the dancing 
faithful. Mostly (fuck) deep house, but then bradley took over seeing 
how it was his camp and then proceeded to show me what colorado was all 
about. Well I just got a taste, but they sure do know their house in the 
rockies.  Bradley is a very talented individual when hes on the set.

Later that same evening, I saw bradley again and then some unknown dj 
from paris tripped my hop for a spell.  Butta say what? Say what the 
Popcorn.. Butta say what? Say what the Popcorn..  
Butta say what? Say what the Popcorn..  

next came jason, dj mess (I think) from daddys in berkeley. i met these 
great friends from india and san jose whom i had not expectd to see 
which was a treat.  Very solid. Very solid. In fact I must say he rocked 
the spot and made it damn phunky indeed.  There were many booty a 
shakin.
Around four as the headstrong began to make a turn toward dawn and I was 
treated to a power bar of soul courtesy of none other than cHris Orr.  A 
lecture on the deeper side of things.  If you ever get the chance.  Just 
chek him.  Its know wonder the records are 1000% better at rasputins 
these days. He played the greatest songs that I never heard b4 and that 
is simply because they were too underground.. I was proud to be a dj at 
that point and I still danced my ass off

the next nigh I was hangin with a particularly wonderful band HERE ARE 
THE FACTS YOU HAVE REQUESTED, And after the man burned down, they played 
a strong set and mine ears were exposed to dj b))merang. I was very 
honored to meet them and even more honored to hear them.. these guys are 
a tight group from what Ive seen and thats what makes their expression 
clear.

While I was playing some platters I met none other than destructo, a dbl 
hit legend.  He is a very nice person as well as tekno god producer. The 
very first raves I went to were dbl hit parties in la la landthose 
were the daze, but so are these and then I carted my rekkds over to the 
nother tent where I enjoyed the sounz of billy from sacramento.  This 
kid Is no sloutch.  Genuine article.

I finally ended my tekno quest at burning man with a sunrize set and 
then more ear pounding goa from the myth the legend goa gill. I have 
finally witnessed the guru and not a moment too soon.

Well thus ended my rave related burning man stay.  I for one was raving 
24/7 even when there was no music.  I give it a google on a scale from 
one to ten. I will never miss burning man ever ever ever ever ever ever 
what a party what a life what an existence weve got going over here.  
its the only life  you have might as well maxxx it out just like your 
credit card.

This has been a publicly served anouncement..jonas j robledo aka 
jakeloco

Yikes! I was there, but I hadn't had a chance to write up anything yet. But
here goes nothing....

I agree totally. DJ Dag, on the other hand, couldn't hold me. His stuff was
tired sounding and every few minutes there would be this long and protracted
break-down that just f*cked up the energy. I would be groovin' and then, BAM,
take a coffee break.

Doc's set was pumpin'! Lotsa growly (in the seductive way) but truly uplifting
female vocals and great tribal sounding house records. The highlight for me
was a track he threw down that started with JayDees "plastic dreams" (one of
my all time favorites) The crowd went nuts. The cool thing about the track was
that it only used the sample and it morphed into something else with "plastic
dreams" samples through-out.
Doc was great. He was enthusiastic, pumping his hand in the air and was really
great about getting the crowd pumped.

Damn. SO DID I! (Actually I think had too much of the good stuff. I was
totally out of it for a little while. Danced my ass off!)

Sweet. I'd love to meet whoever will be there. I'm gonna try to make it, if possible.
Yaknow, I've gone the the last coupla events trying to hook up with some
fellow SF ravers but it never seems to happen. How can a "newbie" to the list
get together w/ some of you fellow people? You have no idea what I look like
or vice versa, so I'd really like to hook-up w/ some of you in an obvious
place if possible. The worst thing in the world is to be in an ExcitEd state
and not have anyone to relate to on the same wavelength. Yannow whatimsayin'?
I think I tried to make it to the front of the DJ booth around two a.m. but I
saw no laminates or anything and there were so many people that I didn't want
to wander around asking random people if the were SFRavers.

Some body give me a sign!

I bet you,

I always find it hard to believe when something like this happens. You
know, if you really dwell sincerely on the death of someone, you will
actually feel their presents.
 Like for instance.. 2pak sugar(sp?) the gangster-rap artist. When he died
the day before PLASTIC I think it was. For some reason my mind dwelled on
him for a moment..You know, when you feel for someone that died, but not
necessarily have feelings for them. Well, I felt his presents in my room.
Or a better way of saying it would be, I felt him inside my head. And the
strangest thing happened after that! My radio at the time already had a
short in it that would shut it off & on intermittently. But that day, it
went from the CD player, directly to the radio and a 2pak song was playing
on Wild107.7..And the last time I listened to my radio before this, it was
set on 98.5
 Now, I have never listened to any of his songs, nor have I listened to any
of his interviews. But that day, I could have described to any of his close
friends or relatives what he is like when your talking to him at a personal
level. And I bet I would have been right!!

 And then there is my dear old grand-ma-ma.. When she died, I felt her come
to me aswell. And this one was really weird.. For after awhile she was
always coming around.. Tell it got to a point where I felt I had no
privacy. And then I simply thought to myself what I was feeling. And asked
her to give me some space.. And she was out of my head..

 I know, weird. But.. It happened. And it WAS all inside my head. But, I
would like to think that it WAS really them inside my head. You know,
because someday I am going to die and I would rather be somewhere else
other than the nothingness-void when I do.

Anyone ever watch a Ghost documentary on TV and then get spooked
afterwards? Boo!!!

Oh and uh.. With that 2pak thing. I would have to say, yes he is dead and
not faking it. Because I feel that 2pak was the kind of person that would
eventually have to come out and say "yeah, yeah, foo.. Thought I was dead"
But I am pretty sure that ain't gonna happen this time peoplez.
=]:...

But Diana the princess... I sense nothing from this... It was a setup.

Once again, I must agree with my soul-sister, Dori!
I have been a long time fan of house but lately, it doesn't move me the way
jungle does.  Not to say I don't like house anymore but that 4,4 beat gets
plaaaaaaayed.  Again... and again... and again...
Jungle has so much variance.  The patterns of sounds can get so big and
wide that you totally lose track of them.  Just try losing track of a house
sequence, I dare ya!

Hey!  I thought *I* was the most famous sfraves scorpio!

I'm definitely down to help out with a scorpio party ... something dark and
mysterious, transformational and sensual, yep!!

I'll do a scorpionic altar .... and maybe make some changes to my warmth
banner, the figure with the chakras, to do an astrological tie-in...

great idea, tony!

Exec Summary:another Burning Man survived, with all limbs and 86% of my brain 
cells intact.  Not too shabby.



Long Version: (caveat-- this is a long-assed essay) Wednesday began at 8:30 am 
running around doing errands, stopping at toys r us, circuit city, goodwill, 
home depot, trader joes, and several friends' houses for 'other' supplies.  
Picked up the rental van, and finally got on the road 12 hours later.  Reno at 
midnight, where the trip was partially paid for by generous quarter video 
poker. Last meal of cheap casino steak and lobster at 2am, then final shower 
the next morning. 

We got to the site shortly after noon, and helped setup the camp, which was 
called Windy City, as we built a big windmill and had some homemade landsailers 
and such.  Met our really cool neighbors, at Yukon __'s Antarctic freeze zone 
(they had a wading pool filled with this weird gelatin-like stuff), then headed 
to Bianca's smut shack for some cheap thrills and dayglo nail polish. 

Friday was spent checking out all the fab camps, the Man, and relaxing in 
beanbags while watching folx stroll along the playa. At night, we rode around 
on bicycles intoxicated, as it really doesn't hurt much to fall down and crash 
on the Playa.  A high point was finding the field of  small speakers mounted on 
3-ft high posts, each one playing a different sound, such as doors creaking, 
race cars, chain saws, birds chirping, etc.  As you walked around, the sounds 
faded into one another, very surreal sensory experience with stars overhead and 
the desert stretched out in front.  Then hit the Black Light camp for some 
boogying, decent happy hardcore and techno classics.  

Saturday someone in our group came up with the idea to change the theme of our 
camp to the Shave and Shot camp (wasn't much wind anyhow).  Our lovely Liz  
(who incidentally is pictured in tuesday's Chronicle article on Bman) performed 
approximately 30 nude head shaves and mohawks, as well as numerous chest, back, 
leg, kootch, and pube trims (sorry, couldn't thnk of a polite way to phrase it 
;->)  By the end, we had a couple pounds of hair in a pile on the ground, which 
made for scented burning later on.  

After a martini hour at sunset,  I through on the furr shorts and velour shirt 
and went with my neighbor for her confession and paddling at the Temple of 
Atonement-- I guess she'd had 'impure thoughts' earlier that day.  We then 
checked out the Ishtar opera, which was a little less intense than last year's 
(remember?  "fire at night, Devil's delight!"), and that damn tower wouln't 
burn down.  But still an interesting performance, with all the fire twirlers on 
stilts, etc.  Then we checked out some goa and then the techno camp near the 
NubChai decorated school bus, then some mellowness at Biancas, while a 
neghboring camp with loud speakers played the soundtrack to the Wizard of Oz. 

Sunday, the big day.  More shaving to salsa music, art car tourings, ice 
sculpture licking, etc.  The sun set and there was a palpable, powerful 
electric energy in the air as people psyched up for the Burn. With a change of 
clothes into silver pants silver shirt, silver glasses, candy rings, much 
glitter, and a silver prism tophat with pink flamingo on top, then a gulp and 
swallow, my mood for the evening was appropriately set. We set off to witness 
the spectacle. Fire twirlers swirled, then a guy set himself completely on fire 
and ran around under then Man.  The Man caught fire, the purple and green neon 
lights popped, fireworks shot out of his head and mid torso, then he fell.  
Chaos erupted as everyone began dancing around the fallen effigy, chanting scre
aming and cheering.  This eventually gave way to several intense drum circles 
centered around burning piles of hay bales.  I immediately got seperated from 
my crew, which was both good and weird.  Hours later, I needed to chill out, so 
I headed out into the desert a ways and looked back.  Quite a site, with fires 
blazing all over the playa, fireworks and flares going off, and people in their 
wildest costumes running and jumping around in a pagan-like bliss. 

Finally, I headed back into camp, and saw some crazy circus, Juicy Danger or 
something.  The guy carved up an apple held in his assistant's mouth with a 
chain saw, then juggled an egg, bowling ball, and the (still-running) chain 
saw.  Then he balanced a running lawn mower on his chin while audience members 
tossed in soggy heads of lettuce.  Vegetarian cowboy with a whip show, and 
female all-star wrestling were other shows.  After the show, I somehow ended up 
following along with the mobile death-machine flamethrower, looking for things 
to burn down.  They tied a big balloon up 30 feet in the air, cranked the 
muzzle, and fired off a stream of glowing flame that blew up the balloon, Then, 
it headed out to the Goa camp, cranked up the muzzle again, and for several 
tense minutes, the fire-dripping barrel was pointed straight at the DJ (Gil? ) 
I don't know how he continued playing with that thing staring him straght in 
the face, dripping fire,  but eventually the machine backed up and left.  I 
stayed, and danced a bit, then went over to watch as a four-story structure 
surrounding a huge metal skeleton-man burned down around him.  Someone was 
yanking on a rope attached to the metal-man's unit, trying to pull him down. 
Out of the blue another guy came running, and body-checked the yanker off his 
feet to the ground. Weird.  

I headed back into town, danced at the Black light camp, then wandered into a 
parachute tent with a flashing green light and good music.  A girl in 
pippi-longstocking garb was dancing, then suddenly started doing these wild 
body-contortions, rolls and spider-jumps. A few djembe drummers wandered in, as 
did a saxaphonist, and they all jammed along as the dj  played wicked music 
that sounded like someone laughing maniacally.

After the groove slowed, I headed back out to the Goa camp to finish off the 
night.   The Goa camp was a sight to see-- a two story pyramid structure, with 
4 massive stacks of speakers draped with psychedelic tapestries and illuminated 
with blacklights..  The DJ (I guess it was Goa Gil, although I didn't know at 
the time) led the group from above with hard fast goa, as crazy psychedelic 
videos played non-stop behind him.  I moved out to dance around one of the 
fires, while facing the stage.  I turned around to see purple light rising from 
mountains, which faded slowly into pinks and reds.  At this point, I headed 
back to my camp to wake my conspirators.  We left at 7, and made it back to SF 
around 1, filthy, sweaty (those silver vinyl pants and shirt allow NO moisture 
out  ;P ) burned and bedraggled, but all told I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  


----'s:
-more gawkers this year
-too many yahoos with still and video cameras running around just watchin

Jeremy,
I had a BEAUTIFUL time with your party!  It's the effort that one puts 
forth of any goal that receives the greatest reward (even if it is 
walking up that cursed mountain of doom)  Take advantage of my offer to 
help with your next porty.
Your friend and a lot of others (hi guys)
Danny

Hey, did anybody see the Burning Man segment on the 10 o'clock news on
Channel 2.  I did.  It was pretty cool.  They didn't make out to look
like it was for extreme freaks and weirdos.  Instead they gave a fairly
unbaised look at the activities that were happening n'Stuff.  It was
pretty damn trippy looking.  I mean I'm a pretty fucking weird kid and
all (you have to know me personally to understand) but I still have to
say that that party looks hella ODD.  It's cool though because it's that
kind of eccentricism that keeps our generation (not that other
generations aren't involved) vibrant.  We (in terms of general society)
should praise this kind of eccentrism and encourage it more often instead
of trying to repress it.

I don't know, just my random thoughts on the beauty of being strange.

Bye for now.

Precedence: bulk

There will be a rally to protest the logging of the Headwaters Forest on
September 14 in Carlotta (Humboldt County)

Some of the people from the Community organization here will be chartering
a bus (probably a Green Tortoise bus, which are lots of fun to ride in, and
have sleeping facilities..!) to go up there on the 13th..  It will be a lot
of fun, a chance to participate in a very good cause.. and pretty
inexpensive... (probably around $20-30 person..for two days..) The area is
gorgeous.. (along the Avenue of the Giants)  Contact the organizers at
(415) 487-6327 (voicemail) if you are interested..

 When redwoods are cut, it's a tragedy for the whole human race, since some
of these trees are over 2000 years old..

Log the profiteers, not the trees!

Hello everyone,

	Well, it's finally happening...After a year and a half, over 70 
consecutive Wednesday night parties, and over 50 different dj's from 
all around, we are throwing our last Wish Wednesday, next Wednesday 
September 10th.  

	Unfortunately, this is not by choice...We have lost our space to a 
much bigger entity from outside of the bay area, who have a lot more 
money to spend on full page ads in magazines, and promote to all the 
people we never needed to because our family grew on word of mouth 
only.  Not only that, but we just found out ourselves this last 
weekend from other sources, so we're really in shock too. 
	
	It was never easy throwing a small, intimate 18 and over weekly in 
San Francisco, but because of all of you who had supported us, we 
found the love and energy we needed to keep it going.  But, these next 
two weeks are going to be our hardest yet...

	Tonight, Wednesday September 3rd, MARS & Mystr-E of Frequency 8 will 
be playing for the last time at Wish.  We really hope that all of our 
family can make it out to party with us and enjoy their amazing trance 
sound.

	Next week, we are working on putting together something we hope will 
be a very special evening for all of who can make it.  We have made a 
lot of good friends in the dance community over the last year and a 
half, and most will be able to make it out to help celebrate our 
transition to something new.

	Is this the last you'll be seeing of Wish?  Well, it's hard to say 
right now.  It's time to take a quick break and rethink what we really 
want to happen for Wish in the future...We are already talking about 
what we can do to get all of us back together again, so who knows...

	So, please come down to Wish at Big Heart City, (836 Mission St, SF) 
one last time, and play in the black lights with us...we'll be seeing 
you soon.

	Much love, and respect...

The Wish Crew  :-)

Well Simon spun in the Basement from 2-4, David Michael spun from 4-6. 
It must of been David Michael. I did the same thing. Dave Seamen's set  
had the whole room grooving and then I went down and heard David 
Micheal's Acid Breakbeat set which rocked! All I know is that the night 
was incredible!

Well kiddies... I have returned from Florida with news on fOaM. It seems 
as though my partner thinks that it would be an idea that he would be an 
IDIOT to turn down! Soooooooooooooooo, I guess I have to get my sh** 
together and my a** in gear and roll on this! Thank you to everyone who 
gave me positive responses (your work is not finished my friends). This 
party will be for you so please let me know if you have any ideas or ?s 
about it. I'd love to make this happen by October so my work is cut out 
for me. Keep it coming!
fOaM2yOu!

I've been there, done that. Scorpios are too worried about the size of
there stingers.j/k hehe  I believe we all have the power for passion,
Cancers are very unconditional and very giving which are good
qualities for love making. Do you not agree?

Has anybody read the new XLR8R cover story on graffiti?  Does anyone
realize how destructive this article is to our scene?  This is one of
the most thoughtless forms of industry sabatage that I have ever scene. 
Maybee im over-reacting, but its just that genecide makes me nervous.

I encourage everyone to read the artice and send your opinions to
XLR8R.  The attatched is the leter that I sent them.  Please read, and
give me your feedback.  

Keep it real...

Vlad.



Dear Editorial Staff at XLR8R:

	Firstly, I would like to say that the following comments are private,
and are NOT to be published publicly in your magazine.   The last time I
E-Mailed my comment to you they were published in your letters section
after being edited. DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN!

	I would like to thank you on your wonderful Cover story on Graffiti. 
You and your magazine have once again shown that you have no clue as to
whats happening in the scene.   Myself, as well as every other Rave
promoter have put hundreds of hours of work into trying to minimize the
impact of Tagging and Stickering as well as all other destructive
vandalism at the parties, raves and clubs in the Bay Area.   And just as
our efforts start to pay off, and tagging at events is down, your
Informative (not) Magazine comes out with an entire cover story
dedicated to glorifying and encouraging this disrespectful form of
negative egotistical vandalism.   
	Over the last 6 months, the amount of tagging has been reduced, and has
become less and less visible.  Nor has tagging ever been directly
associated with raving.  But your magazine (which is directly associated
with raving) has made a direct connection between tagging and raving,
and will encourage more tagging at raves.   
If you think I am over-reacting than you should see the damage after the
party that we just had, Megga-Buzz-Mania, on this Labor Day, We had more
tagging than weve seen at our last 4 parties combined.  We had tagging
on the speakers, generator, walls, bathroom, floor, banners and every
where else.   I contribute this increase directly to your magazine.  It
came out only ONE week before our event.  Thank you for encouraging
negative behavior at a time when positive role modeling is so important
to help the misguided youth in our society find something to identify
with.  
Graffiti is an art-form.  But your article did not Do it any justice AT
ALL!  Instead you brought it down to a lower level by assimilating it
with tagging. which has no artistic value whatsoever.   You made it
sound like it was "all-good", and fun.  Well in this scene it isnt. 
But then again, what do you really know about this scene.
	Your magazine has done a grave injustice to our scene, and the effects
of your article will be felt for a long time, by all promoters in this
industry.  Venues and equipment will be tagged, and owners of facilities
will not want their locations used for rave events, and promoters will
have to charge higher admission to cover the excessive security,
cleaning, painting and damage expenses with every event.  Nobody wins,
especially the Ravers.  Thank you for being so considerate to the
promoters that place ads in your magazine to advertise their events. 
Im sure that they really appreciate all the extra money you will cost
them.  Maybe in the future, your magazine would consider glorifying
Gang-Rape, excessive drug use, or unsafe sex I am sure those would make
excellent cover stories to follow your trend of encouraging
communication and glorifying negative psychotic behavior in our
society.  Keep up the Positive work. NOT!

There was some concern this year about the Burning Man organizers copping
an ant-rave attitude.  Sound systems were to be limited to a wimpy 300W.
After much negotiations, our camp (Temporary Astonishment Zone) was given
official permission to bring in a moderately sized system (a combo of
Rob Rayle's and Ran D. Dream's equipment.)  One thing we did to help
control the noise was to haul out an 8 foot wall made of bales of hay to
buffer the sound system from the campsites.  This cost us an extra $600,
but if it means that medium-sized sound systems will be tolerated at 
future BMs, then it was well worth it.

There were a quite a few other smaller systems scattered around, and of 
course there was the "community dance" quitely advertised for the main 
BM stage further out on the Playa for Sunday night.  

For me, this resulted in four consecutive nights of great raving.  
Thursday nite, the TAZ system featured Rob Rayle spinning CDs along with
some tasteful keyboard work for an enthusiastic little crowd.  I wandered
back and forth between Rob's Goa set and another site that featured 
house music.  Of course, you have to be an idiot to go to Burning Man
just to rave, but as long as you decide not to sleep much there was
plenty of time for everything.

Unlike last year, everything was pretty close together so you could 
wander on foot, returning at will to a choice of small intimate
rave sites.  I think there were a lot of converts; one camp had a nice 
party going with an enthusiastic bunch of raver-hicks all wearing cowboy 
hats, jumping up&down, whooping it up.

Wandering around all the campsites, I was struck by how much good music
there was.  Prodominantly techno/house/dub/ambient.  If it wasn't for the 
fact that this was Burning Man I would have concluded that all the music  
I love had become totally mainstream.  Of course there was also some 
rock, hip hop, punk, and noise distortion.  I also heard pop music mixed 
with video game sound effects, and a smattering of retro dylan/Greatful 
Dead/etc.  It was fun to hear all the campsite systems overlaying each
other into a thick musical collage.

On Friday, Rob, Niels, myself and Troy finally got our Drum Machine Circle
going.  What a blast!  Sounded like a mess most of the time, but there
were some fairly decent moments.  After the sun set, the TAZ system again
pumped out rave sounds with Niels started off with some acid house.  Keep
practicing Niels! :)  Later it was Tom doing the Goa thing with Rob 
supplying some occassional keyboards and sound effects.  They drew a great 
crowd of about 100 that was totally into it.  We had a really nice setup;
Ran D. had brought a bunch of excellent lighting effects.  We also had a 
ton of blinking Xmas lights, black lights, a strobe, and a projection
screen with slides, and some nice banners.

Saturday night's music began with Ran D. (Dionysis Dreams) doing an
ambient set, which led into a really cool middle eastern dance thing that
drew an interesting bunch of dancers.  Sometime later I was about to go
to sleep, but somehow ended back at the sound system where Rob Rayle was
DJing naked, with everyone going nuts.  I blinked my eyes a couple of
times when it looked like he was actually playing keyboards with his
penis - talk about wanking on your instrument!  But it was just
one of my many BM hallucinations.  Later Tom took over and went on
into the morning, I don't quite remember when I passed out.

Sunday, after the burn, was, according to the published schedule, a 
"community dance".  From what I was told by a BM promoter, the local 
Sheriff's dept had explicitly demanded that there be no "raves", so 
instead we had an official full on killer "community dance".  Whatever! 
As reported, Goa Gil kicked our asses with 6 hour set, preceeded by a 
semi-live CCC set with Adam Om.  I didn't think I would have the energy 
to dance for more than an hour, but the vibe was so thick and the music 
so intense that I managed to dance for 5 or 6.  It was an incredible 
group of freaks, freaking out, dancing, trancing by the stage and around
the fires in the middle of the desert.  Even Goa Gil himself stepped back 
at one point and danced during his set.  Never saw him do that before.

I think this BM was a great success for integrating raving with the event,
without turning BM into a giant rave.  Despite the focus of this report,
I did do a lot more than raving, really getting to experience the best
of many worlds for an absolutely crazy and wonderful time!

hehehe...  on the all-too-true tip, i remember seein the Vandals perform 
down in l.a. (with Moon Zappa!) and the guitarist, after losing his 
shorts, found some interesting ways to strum his guitar.  yeah, hendrix 
played guitar with his teeth, but this is a whole nother league... we're 
talkin pure unadulterated cock rock...

and I just happen to be JAMMIN' to aphrodite's cd right now - if you want
some weird-ass funky basslines that make your body move in some RIGHTEOUS
ways, go get it (I've had this song stuck in my head for about three days
now and it's on the player again, gawd)...  Besides, the MAN knows how to
work a set of tables, and I've never heard basslines like this anyway...
MMMMMmmm...

Not sayin' I don't still LOVE house - but like my friend Elisa sez, jungle
fits my now harried lifestyle - hard, fast, hectic, and chaotic - but
still, my soul finds order in it...  (and my body too)...

i work at Raver Books which as far as I know is the only rave related
bookstore.
We are looking to expand the books that we carry. So far we have a variety
on rave and some indirectly rave related topics like Irvine Welsh
(trainspotting)
and Nicholas Saunders (E is for Ecstasy). I am also making print catalogs for
mail order.

I was wondering if you guys could give me some book suggestions....

Our site is online at http://www.pulpfiction.com/rave

I would really appreciate it, this store is run by ravers for ravers =-)

I also want to carry a variety of zines...do you guys know any good sf zines
other than lotus?

	Hey, are any of you out there into making dance oriented music yourselves?
 If so, I'd like to start a band.  I play the MC-303, which is one of the
ultimate drum machines/acid groover emitters.  But I also play the pc, but
I kind of think it's cheating as far as a performance art, but I do use it
as a sampler.

	I can take it all the way up to jungle (although I specialize in electro)
but the high tempo doesn't give it much time to think (which limits the
amount of sound I can put out on the other tracks) so I need some
accompaniment.  And to make a jungle beat significantly interesting (ie:
tricky) I usually use all 8 tracks just on drums.

	Totally into the live thing too.  Improvise.

	Basically I just wanna jam.

ps - Oh yeah, I can read/write sheet music, know all about keys, etc, and I
also sing kind of like Shabba Ranks (not words, just beats).

awww, c'mon. No need to be ashamed. It's not how old you are, but rather how
young you feel.
Anyway, I was thinking about starting a jurassic raver clique. If you finally
come clean, maybe I'll let you join.

so, just what is the average age of sfravers?

i'm 27, and as  i've said before, just moved out here from
pittsburgh (anybody ever hear of a dj named dieselboy?)...where the scene,
suchas i was into it, was very young.  i didn't identify too well with it.
it seems as if here, there are all different types of folks into the
'scene'....hmmm...maybe i have a better chance of fittin' in?  well?

-jimg


ps. on 9/25-27, at the palace of fine arts in sf, there's supposed to be
this film called 'cinema electronica', which contains a bunch of
behind-the-scenes footage of the making of several 'electronica' videos,
such as those on mtv's amp.  i wanna go...anyone else interested? (i heard
about this on the idm list)

I don't know. I've been out several times to more massive related events
(Jauggernaut, Spundaes, etc.) and it seems to me that if I had to guess it's
probably around 20 to 23 median age.
There are times though when I start feeling a little old tho...


> maybe i have a better chance of fittin' in?  well?

I hope so considering I'm 28 and don't think of myself as out-moded. In fact,
I'd like to think that I'm one of those people that provides a sense of
history and "institutionalized" memory for the rave scene. Being a former DJ
and being sucked in back about '91 (LA - Beej, Sean Perry, shit like that -
Happy Wednesdays, etc.) I feel like I can have that long view where there may
be none. Anyway, that's just MHO.

my philosophy on what a breakbeat is:

the bass is the man
the snare is the woman

they bounce back and forth:

boom - bip
boom boom - bip

how they dance depends on their relationship, how they feel about
eachother, sexual prowess, etc..

the cymbals and hi-hats are drugs they add that extra sparkle (this I'm not
so sure about yet... I think they might be something deeper... any
guesses?)

Actually, you're not.  When these constellations were first observed 2000
years ago, then everything we know about astrology would be correct. 
However, when the earth revolves around the sun and rotates, it also
wobbles like a top would if you spun it.  Because of this wobbling, we,
2000 years later, see the same constellations as the Greeks or whoever
did except that they are now in different locations in the sky.  So this
whole time while you thought the constellation Scorpious was behind the
sun on the date of your birth, the actual constellation behind the sun
was really Libra. 

Therefore you are truly and scientifically proven to be Libra.  Sorry if
that pisses you off or I'm glad to please you if  you feel better about
this.

See you later alligator.

That's cool.  I'm not telling you have to believe it but you should keep
in mind that this new chart was proven by careful scientific observations
over the past 50 years.  This shit is fo' sho' correct.  I'm merely an
unbiased source of information.  :o)

But you know, in the end, it's probably best to just let life go by and
not to try and get an idea of how it's going to be.  Just live.  Sort of
like water flowing past your feet in a stream.  That water will make
contact with you but will just keep on going on without spending time
dwelling on you.  That's what one's rationale should be like; IMHO. 
Don't mind my Zen/Buddhist stuff.  Just do whatever feels right.

hello all~
	most of you probably don't know me, but my name is jack and i
went to raves in the san francisco area for some time, such as true love
and cybertrance communication.  but i just recently moved to the los
angeles area (long beach to be exact), and i am having trouble finding
raves here.  by any chance, do any of you know how i can get information
about raves happening down here?  i tried the computer, but hyperreal
doesn't have a socalraves list or anything.  i would really appreciate
any help you could give this lost ravin' soul.

				thanks in advance,

Actually, there is no laraves mailing list, but there is a Southern
California list which is pretty much dominated by LA:
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/socal/list_info/
Check out the above URl for info.  If you like to drive a bit, you can come
visit us down here in San Diego where we do have our own SD-Raves list :)
Actually, there are a lot, lots and lots, of events in LA and I hear that
it's pretty friendly up there too.  Good Luck!

Binge and Plur,

so, just what is the average age of sfravers?

i'm 27, and as  i've said before, just moved out here from
pittsburgh (anybody ever hear of a dj named dieselboy?)...where the scene,
suchas i was into it, was very young.  i didn't identify too well with it.
it seems as if here, there are all different types of folks into the
'scene'....hmmm...maybe i have a better chance of fittin' in?  well?

ps. on 9/25-27, at the palace of fine arts in sf, there's supposed to be
this film called 'cinema electronica', which contains a bunch of
behind-the-scenes footage of the making of several 'electronica' videos,
such as those on mtv's amp.  i wanna go...anyone else interested? (i heard
about this on the idm list)

I think some entrepreneurial person should start a class to teach new ravers 
all the basic moves.  I remember, way back when, during the height of 
popularity of movies such as Beat Street and Breakin', that several break 
dancing schools sprung up in the very-white state of Colorado.  Just think how 
successful a school here would be.  Imagine:  Jeff N'Stuff's Rave Dance 
Academy.   Kinda like that school in "Fame"

HELL YES!.. me and Derek are going all DROOGED out.. :) It'll be trippy

Oh my god... two of the best DJs ever.... Sneak and Doc Martin.. what

from UNDERWORLD... I can't wait!!!

Keoki!!!! (I'm listening to his stuff right now). He's one of my favorite
DJs... :)

plus... my buddy old pal DJ Bloom is spinning at this party... this guy is
so good.. I love his Discoy funk style... :)

> >> 4.  Cyberfest?

Totally... I owe it to myself because I haven't been to a FGE party for
days (I missed FGExperience cuz I was sick as a dog and I missed MeggaBuzz
(Major frown!!!) because I was in New Mexico.. I REALLY wish I could have
made it because meggabuzz1 was the first party that I had gone to in
years and that really motivated me to get into partying again...

> >> 5.  see Daft Punk @ the Filmore?

DEFINATELY!!... I had planned to see them last time they were here but I
lost my ID (had to be 21) and I found it a week later.. so I guess I
wasn't meant to go?? So me and Rubilicious are going on the 9th...

Talk about 6th degress of seperation.... a few gals from Chicago were
staying at my apartment for a while... and they had a friend they used to
live with athta was going to school/working in Paris who KNEW the guys and
had hung out with them the night before I talked to him on the phone...
crazy....   

if you don't know what 6 degress of seperation is... it's the fact/theory
that we all know eachother (everyone in the world) by 6 people or less...

Hola mi familia...

I'm back from New Mexico.... and I have a few more stripes on my world
travellor belt.

The place is totally hot, super clean, has BEEEEEEAUTIFUL fluffy clouds
like we've never seen (I love clouds), beautiful people, taco bells that
you can actually eat (they make the food so much better then they do
here), generally nice people, totally chill...

the 4 days spent there was really theraputic (sp?) and made me realize
just how much I need to relocate and have new experiences, make new
friends, and change my environment. I'm going to fly to some other cities
in the not so distant future and probably move in about a year or so. 

On Saturday night I went to a club called UN (Underground Nation) and got
a chance to see Donald Glaude spin in a tiny wittle club (which was cool).
He spun some really hard housy/funk stuff which isn't my favorite, but the
way he was mixing made it very enjoyable.. this guy has so much soul and
so much energy... he got this club rocking... he kept yelling "Feel
it!!".. :) I was right in front grooving my butt off. When he was finished
(2 hour set) me and my friend DENISE from New Mexico introduced ourselves
to this big Teddy Bear... he's such a cool guy and was totally down...

There were other things about this trip which were nice that I can't post
about... but lets just say that the grass is greener (and cheaper) on the
other side of the fence!!! ;) [Right DEREK?!?!?!?] Sorry Brian.

Ding, Ding, Shuffle, Shuffle, zaaaaap!

Byroni... .. .

hello all~
 most of you probably don't know me, but my name is jack and i
went to raves in the san francisco area for some time, such as true love
and cybertrance communication.  but i just recently moved to the los
angeles area (long beach to be exact), and i am having trouble finding
raves here.  by any chance, do any of you know how i can get information
about raves happening down here?  i tried the computer, but hyperreal
doesn't have a socalraves list or anything.  i would really appreciate
any help you could give this lost ravin' soul.

    thanks in advance,

     jack

I love Daft Punk and wouldn't miss this show for the world man. Those
Frech dudes are about my age and their music is the soundtrack of my life
at the moment...  They have so much talent (in my opinion) and I love
their CD....   I remember hearing Revolution 909 at Love Affair... I was
grooving (I was alone at this party by the way) and this sista' came up to
me and told me that I danced hella good.. so we started grooving hard core
(it's in the blood.. the groove, the funk, the soul!!)  and Revolution 909
came on... and I will always remember this moment at Love Affair when I
hear this song....     Her name is Andrea and she joined the Navy and was
back from boot camp when I met her at Love Affair.. she moved to Maine and
we're still pen pals.. cool, eh?

Byroni

ps. I love Disco... :) I would give anything for someone to throw a
100% disco house party... I can see it now.... maybe I should organize
it... I could call it "Saturday Night Fever 2000" DJ Bloom mixes these
tracks so well... definately see him at Life Force if you're interested in
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD discoy house....   da boys gotz skillzzz.... homey! ;)

the low, rumbling sound that starts slow (in the background) and pushes
forward ... loudly and sounds like it might overtake the melody is the
world.  It's beaten back by hi-hats, and cymbals, which I see more as
randomness, but could be drugs.

but constant through this is the melody (cycle) of the man and woman ...
boom/bip.

Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!!!  That was some amazing
botanical stuff we had there.  I couldn't believe that for as much as we

better in those hard times of sleeping on shitty smelling (literally)

Don't get me wrong, I went with the intention of seeing them live
(which
they do not really even play live) and it was a poorly put together
show
I am not saying don't go, but seriously bro they SUCKED in a big way
live and I wouldn't want you to waste your money. 8)  Who knows
maybe they've I hope so.

you're no where close...I work the door at a lot of partys so

Hello...

Just wanted to let those of you who can receive 90.7fm on your radios that
I am doing a semi-regular weekly show on Fridays from noon-3pm on KALX in
Berkeley.  I play all sorts of different styles, focusing on techno but
branching into lands of ambient, dub, drum and bass, noise, jazz,
avant-garde classical, obscure soundtracks and the like...  KALX can be
recieved in many parts of SF (but definitely NOT in the Haight).  Tune in
if you can!

Fridays 12-3pm with Seth
KALX 90.7fm Berkeley

See ya,
Seth

Heh...   =]:....
 I could teach breakdancing I think..

Anyways..  I don't know.. Just follow the predictable four steps. And try
to repeat any hits that were cool for you, every fourth step. So like, if
you do something cool on the 2nd step..Do the same thing on the next 2nd
step. Makes it look like, you knew the songs was going to make that sound
on the first 2nd step. Try not to repeat the exact same feeling more than
8times. And remember.. Don't like be shy. Your reputation depends on it!  
Oh..


I am not making much sence..

Thanks for the 411. I know.... :) Dutch told me the same thing when I
missed them last time. But I'm hoping that my experience will be
different. 

You can spend a lot more time perfecting music when you sequence it and do
it in your bedroom as "Homework". :)

I'll tell you how it goes with these French dudes... :)

I wonder if fish could learn to breakdance

and i wonder if dolphins have raves out in the middle of the ocean?

anyone know what a dolphin rave in the sea would be like?

It would be fun to create an underwater rave or at least use that 
as a theme for a party. Who wants to help me?

im a fish but my moon is aquarius which is why Im a foolish fish.
Actually aquarius is the stongest sign in my chart so I really
like aquarius. We all have all 12 signs... btw

Does everyone know what your moon sign is?
THe moon represents your emotions, your subconcious
and how you react when under stress. If you want to know
how to make someone emotionally happy...look at their moon.
 
If you want to know what your moon or someone elses
send me your time and date and city of birth and i will 
run it thru my computer...sorry i dont have time
to do online interpretations though.

Well its re-introduction time for me & sfraves as im back in 
town....just to re-cap.....

I'm Rob from London, England & im on a sort of working vacation in the 
US & have been scooting around since July 2nd doing some DJing (trance, 
drum & bass, chill-out) & pushing our new record label in London (home), 
Seraphim Records to the good ravers of this fair country......and its 
has been a totally wonderful time of meeting good people & going to good 
places......i liked SF so much ive extended my stay for a couple of 
weeks to come back & play! So here's some things to ponder on.....

Out
........so far ive pencilled in the CCC/Halicinogen thing on Sat.....Ken 
Ishii/Ultra Hope Monday...& Big Top (Oakland) w/end after 
next.......further recommendations appreciated...& meetings with sound 
minded people.....and also recoms. for good record shops, cafes, places 
to hang out etc....wot do i do in this lumpy city?

Take advantage!
Any parties (beach/house/street/club/whatever)....u need sounds....you 
got em....ive been treated so well in this country that i think its time 
to give some back so i am quite happy to play almost anywhere @ 
anytime....all i ever need is something to play on (Techs  and/or CDs) 
and willing feet & ears (anything else to keep a DJ happy is @ your 
discretion!)....sounds available are Trance, Jungle/D&B or chill-out 
(for those after party sessions!)....including some dub plates of some 
stuff from the label in London........you'll like!

Help!
My friend, is looking to rent someplace as she's just moved in from 
Wisconsin....she teaches, promotes parties & does good art......can 
anyone help?

So come back to me.....if only to say hi.....i leave town on 
15th....give me your best shot

Love & Thanks to all

Rob (invisible cola)

PS Can we not mention a recent MAJOR news story concerning a certain UK 
celebrity.....its not that i dont have any sympathy (i do) its just that 
its getting a bit much now......i keep getting asked the same stuff over 
& over

hi beautiful people,

some dj from australia looking for a weekend freeloading in SF, in 
exchange for (it seems) turntablist exhibition.  this is from 
alt.music.makers.dj, and i'm just forwarding it.  i neither know the 
poster nor the dj himself, but i just have this warm spot for fellow djs 
(even "purported to be dj"s, especially a bohemian kind), so i'm forwarding 
it to y'all - who knows?  maybe one of yous can use a visiting jock.

like i said, don't know the guy/gal, and *I VOUCH FOR NOTHING*.  apologies to
those who find this post inappropriate.

b-

(hi, dark, if you are getting this)
(hi also to Jen - you got me a buddy bracelet.  sorry couldn't meet up back 
with you at 'the otherside'.  we had to take off early. )
(ok, last ps.  to the folks @ spire, cool party!  getting to the site, an 
awesome site it was, was half the fun, i must say. but next time, do 
us a favor and ask us to donate some gas and wooden boards for the event ;-)

Hi,

I've got a visiting DJ from Austrailia, staying with me right now. He'll be
flying to San Francisco September 13, 1997 and needs a pick-up from the
airport and a room (or couch) to stay in for the night. 

He is a professional magician, and in return for the favor, he will perform
close-up table magic at a wedding reception (during cocktail hour and/or
during meal) or other appropriate event on Saturday, 9/13/97. He has
performed at numerous functions for me and is an EXCELLENT
entertainer...funny, and very accomplished.

All he needs is a pick up from the airport and a piece of floor to sleep on
for the night...then a ride back to the airport Sunday evening.

If you can help, please email me at: trikstar@hotmail.com

Subject: F8 - belated readback - no reviews/responses? 
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Heya - just doing a belated readback nearabouts 8/22 -- didn't find any
messages reviewing/commenting/revibing the F8 party almost two weeks ago...

... had an amazing time myself, D.J. Mystere (sp?) waxed me stratosphereic.
Anyone else?

Had my own lonesome beautiful after hours party -- driving back to the
city, bopped up the hill on the right into the golden gate rec. area right
above the bridge, walked to the corner spot overlooking san fran and the
rising sun wrapped in a mexican blanket (me, not the sun). Beautiful
sunrise with fog below, dense clouds above, and a narrow slit of sky
through which the sun rose all of a sudden blinding and exquisite.

Was actually kinda surprised no other city-bound ravers dropped into that
spot...

Anyhow, on F8 - great party they threw, bummer about the enormous lines to
the two toilets but if you hummed a tune and thought about something bad
you'd done in the past week, you could turn it into a sort of pennance for
wrongdoing, purification ritual. Or something.

Jeremy has gotta be the most ruthless bsp-er on sfraves.  No one's safe from 
becoming bsp bait while he's on the list.  :-)

I think we should have SFRaves awards.  Like Jeremy would win the "Hardest 
Workin Man in Rave Business" award or something.  John S. Lee could get some 
kind of "My Word is Law" award.  Macadio should get some the "UG DJ w/ the 
Most Groupies" award.

I'm hoping for the "Big Mouth Newbie" award.  Vote for me!

I'm going to FnF - and I'm totally psyched about it.  Killer music, cool
people, mud baths, wood burning hot tubs...  Mmmmmmmmm...  Raving has become
one of my favorite outdoor sports.

Hope everyone has a good one, whatever you do.  I'm feeling really positive
today, like a cloud that has been hanging over me lately has lifted - I hope
it's a cosmic thing and everyone else noticed it too.

Love,
Beth

The following people, besides you and me, have expressed interest in
going:

Robert Pointer rwpointer@citiscape.com
"e.menon" emdash@grin.net (if she doesn't have to work that weekend--aw)
"LYLE, THOMAS" LYLET@pab281a.ssd.loral.com
karsten schroeer kschroeer@rocketmail.com (wants to get a schoolbus)

So I guess that makes six.

:)

WhoHoo...I'm glad I brought this up...didn't honestly think I'd get any
response!

Hasta,

EVER HEARD OF DIESELBOY - are you kidding!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  Had to be one of
the first good jungle dj's in the states...  He fucking rocks, although he
shoulda gone on before Aphrodite sunday night cuz Aphrodite makes even
dieselboy sound mediocre (that's just my word for last sunday I guess)...

But, guess what?  He lives in Philadelphia now - kinda cool, actually, cuz
it means it's easier for him to get to New York...

One good thing about New York - our jungle scene can kick your jungle
scene's ass...  (Sorry, that was a knock-off of a Letterman joke (I think)
that got around New York and became it's unofficial motto - one most New
Yorkers tended to adapt to quicker than the real one (I don't even know
what the real one is, actually)...  It was, ""Our City can kick YOUR city's
ass."  

We probably could - y'all are too nice out there.  ;-)  hehehe,  j/k.

mixes can be unreal.

OK, I started reading your letter, Mr. Vlad, and I have a few things to
say.

First of all, let me make it clear that I did not *finish* reading your
post/letter.

Second of all, I am not going to get on some supersoapbox trip and rail
against those who would be railing against the wind-up-toys graf 'artists'
who litter their surroundings and their names with whacked styles and
thoughtless marker use.

HOWEVER, did you ever stop to think that there are ways around the
mindlessness?   For me, grafitti when taken back to the writing your name
in cement level, demonstrates a sort of childish need to leave a trace of
oneself.  Could that need not be fufilled by making some big sheets or
butcher paper or scrap plywood and sheet rock available for public use?
As a sort of free and open and public wall in the outside sector of your
massive?

What if you put the work/finagling in to make the spot's owners let some
wall in/outside their space be bombed over the course of a whole party by
a local writer with piecing skills?

What if you accentuated the positive somehow?  Did you see the grafitti
left over at the Maritime on Sunday last?  The legacy of the hiphop
festival passed down to the ravers?  The big pieces of plywood that had
wonderful and spacey pieces on them, featuring little chipchop shreds of
wisdom and uplifting statements otherwise.....like the stuff on rave
fliers, only written towards the hiphop side.

I would hope that some people who identify with that article would
understand what I'm saying.  For me, that article described a part of my
life that I will always cherish, a sort of light hearted "I don't give a
FUUUUUUUUCH" and juvenile, but altogether artistic and politically active
time in my maturation process.

With a little effort I'm sure you could minimize further the effects of
the whacked, while perhaps even borrowing a bit of positive culture from
another scene.

That is all I am trying to say.

PAX,
DUH,
MAX

An interesting thing about "Generation X":
Genreation X includes, mostly, the folks born between 1969 and 1975.  
This period is the period of the lowest number of live births in the 
United States in at least 50 years.
just an interesting anecdote.
You can throw that out the next time you're at some hoighty-toit cocktail 
party and everyone will think you're cool.

WHAT!?!  I belong to "Gen X"?  Oh no, I'm part of a generation now; that

i read this out of this little miniature book on scorpios.

"Scorpio is linked to "the underground" in astrological tradition:  
mining, investigation, secret societies (whether legal or not), the 
occult- ..."


"Because of your matchless self-control, you are slow to anger; but 
when you explode, the world around had better take shelter fast."

and this part will make you think:

"The Scorpioin is also connected to the reporoductive organs and to 
spiritual cycles of death and rebirth.  Tremendous potential force 
lies locked in your coiled intensity, which can be used to accomplish 
the miraculous in life.  HOW you choose to unleash this preternatural 
power is another question: you can create, or destroy, with equal 
facility."

I'll see you and raise you 6.  :)

I have several extra tickets to this weekend's party due to various
cancellations and poor networking on my part; I'm planning on leaving
tomorrow afternoon from SF, so if you want them *please* get in touch with
me early in the day, via 415-278-5660.  They are $20 a piece and include
directions.

Some short details: it's being held on booty-ful property about 3 hours
north of SF, music's going on from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning.
There'll be quite a few really good DJ's there, and it'll be cozy (~350
people).  Plus I'll be spinning ambient, woohoo!

	Brian

Can I teach the "Ghetto Girl" class?  Can't nobody do the booty dance like I 
can.  I challenge anyone on the list who thinks they can dance more like a low 
budget miami rap video hoochie than I can.

If you know how to dance like a true ghetto girl, when you go to a party and 
there's that one couple freakin to some goa trance, you won't feel left out.  
You can join in and ride that train, maybe even break them off a lil sumthin 
sumthin.

For real tho!

Heh...   =]:....
 I could teach breakdancing I think..

Anyways..  I don't know.. Just follow the predictable four steps. And try
to repeat any hits that were cool for you, every fourth step. So like, if
you do something cool on the 2nd step..Do the same thing on the next 2nd
step. Makes it look like, you knew the songs was going to make that sound
on the first 2nd step. Try not to repeat the exact same feeling more than
8times. And remember.. Don't like be shy. Your reputation depends on it!  
Oh..


I am not making much sence..

Well, if that means there will be a whole lot of scantily clad girls looking 
for men, count me out.   Sounds like my high school dances.

I'm not too sure about what a dolphin rave would be like.  But I know what 
they'd play.  Acid trance!

Hello SF ravers!!  
Sorry for the interruption.  We've been subscribed to this list before under
(Lunatune@aol.com), and have met many of you at parties in previous months.
 We have been having a string of bad luck with dishonest people.  Being new
to the bay area, and not living directly in San Francisco, it is hard to meet
friends in the honest rave scene.  We are looking for honest ravers for that
special connection.  There is a wide variety of favors we need, and will
return the favors accordingly.  We try not to be too hypocritical...we
ourselves are honest.  {=^)  We know there is someone out there that has
honest friends with honest connections.  Anyone willing to help us?  Thank
you so much for your time and sorry again for the interruption.

I know I talk a lot of trash about Sacramento . . . but early in the summer 
there was a party that went off here called _Xanadu_.  It was a pure disco 
party, and although you didn't have to dress up you got in half price if you 
did.  I heard it went OFF.  I wish I would have went . . .  there was supposed 
to be a second installment in August, but hey, didn't happen, probably not 
gonna happen anytime soon.

But yeah, we had a pure disco party here in Sac, there was a good turnout and 
a phat vibe.  If it could happen in Sac it could happen in SF, righ righ?  So 
who's the promoter who'd be willing to do it?

  If you like disco and you like to dance, consider these places:
  The Metronome's Block Party  Ballroom in SF (right off 17th and De Haro)
regularly has "Hustle Night!" This month it's on Friday, Sept, 12, and
includes hustle lessons with Raul Ante. Call 252-9000 for info. The cost
is only about $10 (lesson and dance) and you get to wander back and forth
into the Metronome (1/2 block away) and the Block Party and no extra
cost.
  The Starlite Ballroom in Sunnyvale has regular hustle nights every
Saturday night. Cost is $7, and includes a lesson if you want it. I've
seen some spectacularly good hustle dancing there some nights. Call
408-745-7827 for more info.

scantily clad girls looking for men is disgusting =)
just as bad as scantily clad boys looking for women i guess.
In fact my parents did that and look what happened...a 
foolish fish was born. And i hear it is hereditary too...
if your mother looked for a man then you might wind up doing
that too and then your children will do it also ...its a vicious cycle.

A Humm-V (Hummer) is the official rayvhur vehicle... can carry my
soundsystem wherever i go and it has an optional power generator good for
having friends out to the park and making good music for them while they
dance.

I wish I had one...

Well to add to the pool of available tickets, I have one extra as well. I
am in Oakland. I'm leaving for the party at 3:00, so you would need to
pick it up by then. If interested give me a ring (510) 703-9566. Thanks.

spaces seem kinda small and not so easy to navigate when revelling in 
BeAuTiFuL sliPPer*E* o 0 BUBBLES o o   sooooooooooo.... I am asking for 
your assistance.      0  o   0  o
  If ANYONE knows of a larger, warehouse type space that would be 
adequate for this venue, PLEASE let me know. I'm not too picky as to the 
location as long as it is either in SF or the East Bay (I'd even 
consider the South Bay if necessary). Even a point in the right 
direction would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

In case any of you would like to know

Dolphins are the only animals outside of humans that have been observed
taking part in oral sex with each other

They are also more intelligent than humans...people can generally 
remember 7 digits (like phone numbers) ,but dolphins can generally 
remember 12 digits.

		DOES ANYBODY WORSHIP DOLPHINS?

	If your definition of "intelligence" is simply how many
meaningless digits something can remember, that is pretty warped. I
guess we should be listening to idiot savants who can recite name
address and phone number out of a phone book instead of philosophers,
scholars, and scientists.

Max,
    I totally understand where you are coming from, and I am the last person
to ever want to deter anybody's vision of creativity...  However.... Tagging
is more destructive than it is creative.  Im not talking about Graffiti  I
think that Graffiti is a very expressive form of Urban culture.  But It wasn't
Graffiti the the XLR8R article was encouraging... It was Tagging.   And
Tagging (IMO) is the act of unrestrained destructive vandalism.   We have
tried things like putting up a tagging wall , or dedicating a wall for tagging
only at our events in the past.  And hat has happened, is that everything but
the designated area got tagged.  Tagging is spontaneous and tags do not want
to be controlled, or told "Ok you can tag here, but here only"  It manipulates
them and makes them feel like they are selling out if they put their marks on
the permitted surface.  Its the rebellious nature of tagging that they want to
express, Not the mark or the tag, but the ACT of tagging and getting away with
it.  You can't control or regulate that.
    In the big picture... Raving is about a community coming together and
dropping prejudices, and animosities, and feeling like one under a unifying
energy of the music and the vibe.  Tagging is about ME... Unique, Stand alone,
egotistical, arrogant, and destructive behavior which does not conform with
community beliefs.  This is why it is incompatible with raving.  No one tags
messages on the walls that say "Love" or "Smile" or anything that can in
anyway contribute to the community... They Tag THEIR OWN NAMES, or the names
of their Tag Crews on the walls, floors, Sound and lighting equiptment, rental
equiptment, bathrooms, and anything elese they feel like.   They just want to
do it and get away with it, regardless of the damage that it does to the
community.... That's not a Rave attitude.  Its the same mindset as someone who
comes to a party and sells bunk and gets out as soon as possible before
anybody notices the damage.  There is no defense for those people either.
    Tagging is a cancer to the rave scene.  It taxes raves in the same way
that shoplifting raises the prices of retail products.  The article in the
XLR8R has glorified and encouraged Tagging, and brought down the art form of
graffiti all in one swoop.  Its a shame that that a magazine that is supposed
to be down for the scene can be so short sighted.

Keep it real

Vlad

It was just one measly factoid example...I generally don't have the time 
to go into involved discertations on Dolphin Intelligence. If you don't 
believe it then don't...it's all good.

I work at a bio-tech company in So. San Fran and one of my friends here 
has a masters in marine biology...in case you were wondering where I get 
my info (a.k.a "MEASLY FACTOID EXAMPLE)

	I have no problem with believing that a dolphin can remember
that many numbers. I have a problem with equating memorizing
uncomprehended symbols as a sign of intelligence.

Subject: XLR8R Graffiti article... Very rave related... please read

Has anybody read the new XLR8R cover story on graffiti?  Does anyone
realize how destructive this article is to our scene?  This is one of
the most thoughtless forms of industry sabatage that I have ever scene.
Maybee im over-reacting, but its just that genecide makes me nervous.

I encourage everyone to read the artice and send your opinions to
XLR8R.  The attatched is the leter that I sent them.  Please read, and
give me your feedback.

Keep it real...

Vlad.



Dear Editorial Staff at XLR8R:

        Firstly, I would like to say that the following comments are
private,
and are NOT to be published publicly in your magazine.   The last time I

E-Mailed my comment to you they were published in your letters section
after being edited. DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN!

        I would like to thank you on your wonderful Cover story on
Graffiti.
You and your magazine have once again shown that you have no clue as to
whats happening in the scene.   Myself, as well as every other Rave
promoter have put hundreds of hours of work into trying to minimize the
impact of Tagging and Stickering as well as all other destructive
vandalism at the parties, raves and clubs in the Bay Area.   And just as

our efforts start to pay off, and tagging at events is down, your
Informative (not) Magazine comes out with an entire cover story
dedicated to glorifying and encouraging this disrespectful form of
negative egotistical vandalism.
        Over the last 6 months, the amount of tagging has been reduced,
and has
become less and less visible.  Nor has tagging ever been directly
associated with raving.  But your magazine (which is directly associated

with raving) has made a direct connection between tagging and raving,
and will encourage more tagging at raves.
If you think I am over-reacting than you should see the damage after the

party that we just had, Megga-Buzz-Mania, on this Labor Day, We had more

tagging than weve seen at our last 4 parties combined.  We had tagging
on the speakers, generator, walls, bathroom, floor, banners and every
where else.   I contribute this increase directly to your magazine.  It
came out only ONE week before our event.  Thank you for encouraging
negative behavior at a time when positive role modeling is so important
to help the misguided youth in our society find something to identify
with.
Graffiti is an art-form.  But your article did not Do it any justice AT
ALL!  Instead you brought it down to a lower level by assimilating it
with tagging. which has no artistic value whatsoever.   You made it
sound like it was "all-good", and fun.  Well in this scene it isnt.
But then again, what do you really know about this scene.
        Your magazine has done a grave injustice to our scene, and the
effects
of your article will be felt for a long time, by all promoters in this
industry.  Venues and equipment will be tagged, and owners of facilities

will not want their locations used for rave events, and promoters will
have to charge higher admission to cover the excessive security,
cleaning, painting and damage expenses with every event.  Nobody wins,
especially the Ravers.  Thank you for being so considerate to the
promoters that place ads in your magazine to advertise their events.
Im sure that they really appreciate all the extra money you will cost
them.  Maybe in the future, your magazine would consider glorifying
Gang-Rape, excessive drug use, or unsafe sex I am sure those would make

excellent cover stories to follow your trend of encouraging
communication and glorifying negative psychotic behavior in our
society.  Keep up the Positive work. NOT!

Vlad

Since this event is somewhat (SOMEWHAT?!? Who am I kiddin') VERY 
interactive & participatory, I was thinking of putting up a large wall 
for Graffiti & letting those who are interested, go at it. I figure that 
even if this will be the only party that happens, I'll have a nice 
memoir of it... If there end up being more to come, we'll ALL have a 
record of it that can be displayed for eons! Any other ideas as far as 
interactive/participatory events at this bUbbL*E* party?

After at least a year of being off the list I've decided to take join up
once again (thanks to some organization of mailboxes).  I know that this is
a common request, but I'll make it anyway:   Does anyone know where I could
get a good deal on 1200's?  Either new or used.  If anyone knows of a
source I'd really appreciate the help.  Thanks in advance.
Peace,
Andrew

You must trust people until their trust is lost. I do'nt believe that someone 
is honest because he/she thinks so. For me, it is a matter of trial and error.
Just be honest with yourself and all other things should fall in place.

Five years ago, when I was 20, I was living in Japan and met this very cool
23 year old girl from Oregon who was working at an English school in Tokyo
for the year between finishing college and going of to law school.  I met
her through a friend of my hostfamily that was in her class, and so I sort
of had this blind date with her.  Anyway, so we met up and decided to just
slum it at a beer drinking restaurant nearby where we immediately started
talking about our lives in general; a sort of low key philosophical
conversation that pretty quickly leads to an understanding of each others
political views.  Both of us were the children of hippies that where trying
to balance the ideals of our parents within more realistic modern
contraints (at least that's the way we saw it).  So, our conversation
started to move towards the problems and pitfalls of modern life, of trying
to be true to yourself, find meaning it what you do, and yet still be
successful.  At some point she told me I should check out a book by Douglas
Coupland called Generation X.  I had already fallen in love with her, so I
bought the book fairly soon after.
I loved and hated that book.  I loved it because it was very well written
(it's not a masterpiece of literature, but I don't think it was written to
be anyway) and described the lives of a bunch of people who were struggling
with a lot of the same problems I was.  I hated the book because it
described me in a lot of ways when I never thought that there was any way
to describe me.  I wasn't supposed to fit in any sort of framework!  It was
the first book that I ever really saw myself in and it sorta scared me.
Anyway, over the next couple of years I started hearing the term Gen X
being used to desribe a group of people and at first I thought that was
pretty cool, because the people in the book were very cool, very noble, and
very interesting.  However, it soon became clear that the term was being
used to dismiss a generation, to describe in non too flattering terms a lot
of people who were just struggling to deal with the mixed up ideas of the
generations past.  Generation X was a book about people trying to deal with
modern philosophy and idealism in a very post modern or post-post modern
era; where you are no longer able to identify yourself with one group or
philosophy, but find yourself mixing it all up (a funny and obvious example
of this is Modonna!  The Material Girl, Virgin who is definately not a
Virgin, the religious girl in Like a Prayer; if you see one of her videos,
just notice all the different images she is using to define herself and
remember how much you may have liked her in elementary or jr. high school).
 The characters in the book were all living together and sort of taking
some time off to try and figure things out - I guess find themselves in
their own ways outside of commercialism but with the realistic
understanding that they wouldn't be able to really escape it.  On top of
that, the book didn't really try to supply any answers, just seemed to
present some of the problems in clearer terms.  The fact that it was so
missinterpreted really tended to bug me after awhile.
So I guess that's my two cents about Gen X.  It's a fairly good story that
is very different from the generic term that was borrowed from it and used
to describe the generation after the one in the book.  Sorta makes me
giggle at the irony :)

Binge and Plur!

Hmmm... I'm sure people do this, but this is the first time I've thought
about it. If you believe Astrology works well as a credible tool for
working out who you are as a person, then you could use it to determine
the predisposition of your future child by making whoppee on a certain
day/hour.   I guess the big question is what sign do I want my kids to be?  
Scorpio cuz all the scorpie's I know resonate to the core...bzzzbzzzbzzz.

Hey I *like* intelli-jungle!  :)

Reason I asked about DB is that I kinda know him from back in Pgh.  He's
recently moved to Philly, and I think is now the manager at 611 records
(at least that's what he told me the last time I talked to him).

I've read somewhere that he's on the bill to play with SneakerPimps...I
dunno when they're coming...

He's been know to be a no-show, though.  Check out Warp's web-site for his

	Okay, it's Friday afternoon and I haven't received any responses.
If anyone needs a ride, or is willing to give me a ride to the F&F party,
please call me @ (510) 845-3226. Please don't make me drive up there
alone; or worse yet, not drive up there at all.... :P

I think I'll be spending my birthday at that play nice thingy, so don't
hesitate to stop by and pat me on the head.  I should be in a very
good mood 8) and spinning some tweaked experimental / ambient / triphop /
bluntbeats at some point in the chill/d&b o'matic room.

Last year, I had one of the best birthdays ever dancing my ass off to Juan
Atkins in a small basement with about 150 people tops at some puny Space
Children party at a bar/hotel basement. That party was, well, amazing
(see... and all it took was one (1) eye frying laser, one (1) tictac, and
a DJ who is really scary on three decks and plays the best minimal Detroit
around). Little hot, but I didn't mind.  Vibe kinda blew (too many people
were there to see "THE Juan Atkins", father of detroit, godfather of
techno, blah blah blah... damn hype), but I wasn't dancing to the vibe,
and the friends who took me were great (Neil/Todd/Jay woohoo! and Wayne
and Marci and Moonpup too).

Met these hyperactive bald British guys who were some of the funnest
people to party with... so I guess we got a little good vibe area going,
but there were just so many people standing there with their arms crossed,
watching the labels, checking the skills.  Get a life or dance or 
something... sheesh...

Peace,
AndyW

Actually it doesnt work that way ...the planets dont predetermine
how we deal with the talents that we are given. Plus there is no 
way to tell how long the pregnancy is going to last.

However astrology can be used to determine your fertility
cycle so it can be used as birth control or to help you find
a time to concieve if that is what you want.

happy birthday virgo

Ill be back on monday to do more free astrology

Thought this might be of interest to any of you budding composers.  This
is a competition of "electroacoustic music" with a prize of $2000.  Now I
there is TONS of talent on this list!  And wouldn't it we wonderful if an
sfraver won?  I think so.

The deadline is Sept 15th, there's a $25 entry fee, and here's the URL for
the complete info:  www.algonet.se/~icem/seaa.html

If anyone does decide to enter, let us all know so we can root for ya.

Your points are all very valid.  I forget sometimes that there have always
been 9 eejit toys for every 1 politically or intelligently motivated graf
artist.

So big up to me, I guess. Hahahahah.

I AM A ONE IN TEN.

I tell you what though, next party you have, see if you can get ahold of
some local writers with talent and give them a spot to rock a PLUR theme
wall, I am sure there are definitely kids out there with talent that would
vibe well off the chance to be on display doing their thing within the
context of harmony and righteous fun.

PAX,
DUH,
MAX

DJ Dan will more than likely be up near the DJ Booth for a long time before
he goes on.


Hey, I might goto Nikita.. We will see.. I am not like looking to go. I
just might end up there..


Maybe I will see everyone there though.

another plug for dieselboy - get it, he's good...  REALLY good - his
earlier stuff is kinda pussy "intelligent" jungle sometimes, (that wimpy
shit yuppies listen to to came "underground" music status while they 
smoke

his
mixes can be unreal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Well there's nothing like some dull-headed insulting comment to get a 
respose........ill assume by "intelligent" (idiot terminology) Dori 
means the LTJ Bukem/Goldie/PFM/Omni Trio/whatever-type 
stuff............so "Jungle" is only about hoover bass & mash-up 
sounds...no room for some variety, melodics, rolling drums & a little 
space in the music for you eh, so stuff anyone ("shit yuppies") who 
likes it...........where to start...

Ive lived in London for the past 8 years & have heard Drum & Bass evolve 
from Ragga-ed up breakbeat hardcore thru to the myriad of styles we get 
today.......and as a DJ i enjoy playing all types.

Ive found over in the US "Jungle" tends to mean the more mash-up 
styles.....as the scene has developed in a diff way over here there 
hasn't really been the Logical Progression ('scuse the pun) of styles so 
maybe junglists do actually see the more mellow stuff as shit 
yuppie...Jungle Lite if you like.....try & get a sense of the whole Drum 
& Bass scene (maybe hear some GOOD d&B DJs who can play the more mellow 
stuff & still move a crowd)....you're doing yourself a disservice by 
blithely dissing this stuff....

One minor point to ponder on...ive noticed the word Jungle used a lot 
more over this side of the water (as opposed to Drum & Bass)...the term 
actually comes from the totally offensive & racist phrase "jungle 
bunny"....now the  J & D&B terms are pretty interchangable now & no-one 
cares/knows of the origins...so does it matter? PJ & Smiley (Shut Up & 
Dance), two of the original pioneers, preferred the term "Ragga House" 
and used to get really offended by the term "Jungle"....but then whos 
heard of Ragga House?

Keep on having fun WHOEVER you are

Love

Yeah that is one -really- bad thing about 1015.  I've been there for several
events where the fire dept shut it down for going over the max occupancy.

Great talent though, besides I like to have a couple of drinks in between
groovin. :)

	I think I saw the flyer.  *Nico runs and digs it out*

	Ok, it's called Cyberfest 97, promoted by CoolWorld   Looks like it's
going to be a massive (the flyer is like a 4 page propaganda spread).
They're having a club DJ room called "Erotic City 2000" with some um ....
shall we say interesting decorations like an "erotic fashion show, cybersex
dancers & sensual visuals".
	It says Leftfield is supposed to be there too.  Hope this helps ya out!!  : )

> things?...BTW..I'm recording via a decent Mackie desk etc...

One technique that has proven very successful is to use a "balanced
active transformer" to isolate the grounds between noisy digital synth
and/or computer eqpt and the mixer (which must have balanced inputs). I
actually used this to isolate a *very* noisy analog output on a
computer I have (SGI Indy) which was injecting horrible noise into my
mixer even with the fader controlling it's input all the way off. This
should also work well on other noisy synths, or people using noisy
computer audio boards (e.g. soundblaster, etc) but will work only if
you use a balanced audio input on your mixer (typically an XLR jack, or
a TRS 1/4" phono jack)...

The idea is that you take the unbalanced line output from some noisy
device, and use a "active transformer" (aka a balanced amplifier
buffer) to create a balanced audio signal to go into your mixer (it
needs to be active because the signal level for balanced audio is much
greater, and the impedance is much lower than crap "consumer grad"
unbalanced audio). 

The important thing is that you do *NOT* connect the ground from the
output of the "active transformer" to the shield/ground input on the
balanced input of your mixer. the shield on the cable inputting the
signal to the mixer input *is* connected to ground on the mixer, but on
the output of the balanced txformer, just connect the hot (+) and cold
(-) wires:

<Noisy    >		  { 1/2 of  }                |
<digital  >--UNB SIGNAL->-{+ RDL   +}->---BALANCED---|+ Balanced input on mixer
<synth or >--GND------+->-{- STA-1 -}->---SIGNAL-----|- 
<computer >	      |->-{G	   G}->/ /---GND-----|Gnd
			  {	    }		     |

What happens here is any ground noise from your errant synth/computer
is decoupled from the rest of your audio chain... although it is still
present on the balanced audio lines (the + and - signals in the diagram
above), the common-mode noise rejection of the balanced input of your
mixer will essentially drop the noise level by 50-100dB (depending on
the quality of your balanced inputs) rendering all the digital noise
and other crap completely inaudible.

After talking to some pros, I found a small "stick on" module  that
does exactly what is needed for this task -- from an Amterdam (*)
company called  Radio Design Labs (STA-1 plus PS-24 power supply)
approx $75.00 for STA-1 and $13.00 for PS-24 from www.fullcompass.com
mailorder (no tax).

See http://www.rdlnet.com for more info on the STA-1 and all sorts of
other really cool little audio modules made by RDL. (Not related, just
a happy customer of their stuff -- sounds great, simple, performs
wonderfully, very compact, decent prices).

PS: It's completely pathetic that very little music gear uses balanced
audio.... once you go balanced, you'll curse every piece of unbalanced
gear you have because it all sounds like crap (noisy, prone to
interference). Plus, w/ balanced audio lines, you can easily run very
long audio lines, traditional unbalanced line level signals can't
really be run for more than 10 feet (3 meters approx) before you start
getting interference... and what with everybody having computers, cell
phones, portable phones, etc -- there's tons of interference available
to screw up your audio signal.

PPS: I just rewired most of my studio for balanced audio. when i get
some more money, i'll get a new mixer w/ balanced audio ins on every
line and put STA-1's on the outputs of all my synths. Right now, the
only piece of music-making gear i have that has balanced outs is my Emu
EIIIxp sampler.

*: what is it about the Netherlands that makes them *rule* on audio...
TC Electronics, Radio Design Labs, Synteco, Phillips, etc. How does one
go about applying for citizenship? :-)

   For the people that have not heard the dissapointing news, I just 
wanted to fill them/you/whoever in;  The most loving, caring, 
passionate, helping, woman known world-wide as Mother Theresa passed 
away this morning.  
   I wanted to let people know about this because she was ,and probably 
always will be, the best role model for anyone of our time.  
   So I'd just like to say, Mother Theresa, wherever you are...PLUR 
baby, You are loved by many.

hey sweets - re: your comment as to "having fun whoever I am" - well, I'm
dori and what I say here is pretty indicative of who i am - cuz unlike a
lotta people, i'm the same online and off...

I had a slight feeling that that "pussy jungle" comment might piss a lot of
west coasters off - from what I've heard from east coast (pahdon me, DRUM &
BASS - over here in nyc we laugh at people who say that, cuz again, it's
that whole black clad vodka-swilling yuppie crowd and music industry goofus
crowd that uses that term, they tag it on with "electronica: - tell me THAT
phrase doesn't make you barf and I WILL laugh) anyway, from what i've heard
about the west coast scene, y'all are kinda into that - whereas in new
york, we like to get slapped in the face with the hard jump up base
lines...  Perhaps it's the different vibes of the cities - but, yeah, I was
sorta waiting for someone to take offense to that, and yeah, you're right,
i was referring to the Bukem/Goldie SHITE (a term most brits I know still
love, hehehe) - you know, it's good for sitting in the park or whatever,
but don't get that shit near me in a club or a party, hear me?  Cuz it
makes me sit down.

As for the use of the term "intelligent" - yeah, you guessed it - more than
likely, I as well included this word in quotes, because I think it's
ridiculous as well - as I said before, it's a term given to the wimpy
jungle beats by people who can't handle anything more...

as far as room for "some variety, melodics, rolling drums & a little 
>space in the music for you eh, so stuff anyone ("shit yuppies") who 
>likes it...........where to start..."

start with Aphrodite - he keeps it hard enough (although he gets a little
wimpy periodically as well) and those bass lines rolling enough to keep me
interested in his experimentation while my butt gets movin' to the beats.  

Ya know, the reason I like the word "jungle" probably has a lot to do with
where I LIVE - people in new york take their jungle SERIOUSLY and hell,
this city is known for being called the "koncrete jungle" ya know...  (We
even get a cheesy monday night jungle thang called the same, headed by
Shitslinger and TC Islept, absolutely the WORST MC known to man)...

Hehehe.. not to get flamed or anything... but I went to register for a dance
class the other day, and there were two girls ahead of me in line.  One of
them was facing me and had on a baby tee of some sort, with a cartoon
character on it.  Beneath the cartoon, two words were written.  The cartoon's
name or something.  I half-glanced at it, and the words I saw surprised me.
 "(Cartoon's First name) Raves"  Thinking I must be going crazy and be overly
obsessed with partying, I toook a second look.  Sure enough, the shirt said
something like "Carlos Raves" and it had this cartoon animal (plattipus or
penquin or something) wearing big jeans, a pacifier necklace and a visor.
 Immediately excited and somewhat ready to question this girl if she even
knew what a rave was I asked her where she bought the shirt,.  I was greeted
with a strange glance and a "Oh I don't know.. It was either JC penny's or
Macy's"  AHHH!! The frustration!! How can they be marketing this to people
who don't even know what a rave is??!?!?!  WE need to covet these T-shirts
while they are still in stock!  Quick!  hurry!  RUn to your local mall and
buy them out!
    my second gripe for the day is when I was sitting in Math class
conversing with a nice girl across the aisle about some of the parties we've
been too.  Suddenly the football jock head sitting in front of me blurts out,
"RAves are Fucking Stupid!"  I asked him which ones he'd been too and he
said,"None.. I wouldn't go to one of those things!! BUt I saw one on T.V. and
they're stupid!"  WHat can you do?
My $0.50 for the day...

        hugs n'Stuff,

      P.S.  i'm going out to Mr. Zip Up's Free Party in the Park tomorrow if
anyone's gonna be there.  I need to shop on telegraph, and if there's a free
party going on, hey, why not???  LOOK for me!!

Funny thing!

I never remember anyone tagging at any of the parties I've put on. Maybe
it's the crowd you're pullin' there buddy. In a humorous twist, that crowd
you promote to and their direct actions will eventually act as a natural
governor on how many more parties you'll get to put on, and where. :-)

Awful, isn't it?

:-)

you're out and about. (i, for one, used to (hmmmm, about 12 years ago?) put
on the east coast bitch-don't fuck with me-attitude when i was out - clubs,
at night on the street, sometimes during the day as well!) and of course i
now put on a mask when dealing with work-related things. i put up masks for
many reasons, but online (more often than not) i don't find it necessary.

eeeek - do you think 6 years out of the state could have changed me??? :o

wow. i'm feeling really...naively peaceful???? what ever happened to the
unity? is it only _within_ geographical locations? i *thought* not,... you
know, my first introduction to this (and here's a word i really don't care
for - but for lack of a better one) "scene" was by a group composed of -
well, okay, east coast ppl (great lakes, nyc...), but also by a bunch of
spanish guys, brits, and indian guys. god. i fell in love with the stories
of parties in europe and goa. the *unity*. then bam! the shit hits toronto!
:) anyway, i'm babblng, but the point is that so much more than the music
for me was the unity. the way the group went on a trip together. the
farther away from the party you came from, i thought, the more interesting
i found you. like a family. (okay, on e :) i guess that's why i like sf -
so many ppl from all over the place! and *seemingly* peaceful. for the most
part. (my favorite city is toronto, for precisely that reason.)

anyway, from what i've heard

Max, have you ever had the pleasure of spending $350+ on getting graffiti
cleaned up so that you could get your security deposit back from a
leaseholder or landowner? It wouldn't be so bad if those who did the tagging,
cleaned it up. Do you know how many venues are no longer available because of
graffiti?

Sounds like F&F is kind of an exclusive party, tons of people have said
they want to go and there are more than enough extra tickets available.
Someone please post more info on this party.  All I know is that it's an
outdoor.  Who's spinning and what kind of fun activities will there be?  I
just might take off spontaneously from Cupertino and check it out at the
last minute.

Hey, I (Miccaela aka 'vbaird@msn.com') didn't say it was disgusting!  Foolish 
Fish did!  And I think he was joking anyway.

Not to bitch or anything, but (this is for everyone) be careful when you cut 
out text.  You may end up misquoting someone's post.  In this instance it's 
not a big deal, but if this would have been a different & more hostile thread 
I might have got some nasty hatemail for something I didn't write.

But there's nothing wrong w/ scantily clad females looking for men--but the 
parties where this tends to be the main activity generally suck.  Sorry.  Just 
my opinion.

    Any rave crowd is a diverse poulation, no matter what party.  But that doesn't
have anything to do with it.  It has nothing to do with My parties.  The problem
is the XLR8R article of making tagging sound like "It belongs, and is part off"
the rave scene.  All forms of Rave Media effect the overall direction of the rave
scene.  XLR8R is one of the largest forms of media in the rave scene.  Their
magazine has a voice, and a presence, and does shape perception of what people
think raving is.  If you think that this will only effect my parties, well then
your not seeing the big picture.    After 7 years in this industry, I have a good
grasp of what's happening.  There will be an increase in the amount of tagging at
raves.  With the increase in tagging, will be an increase in other forms of urban
street activities that were never a part of this scene.  Things go hand - in
-hand.  As the scene is expanding and more people are looking for information on
it, the responsibility of any entity that cares about the scene would be to
promote it on a positive level, so that those new to it start of with the right
impression.  Do you think that the XLR8R issue on Graffiti is the type of image
that you would like someone to see as a first impression of this scene?  This
article is not going to make candy ravers turn in their pacifiers for markers, BUT
it has the potential to encourage new ravers to purchase markers instead of
candy... do you follow my drift?
    This is a very sensitive time, much of what people perceive the rave scene to
be comes form printed media.  Anyone that does not have a lot of experience to
this scene, that reads this issue of XLR8R might get the wrong idea of what raving
is all about.  And that influence and encouragement will increase the amount of
tagging at parties... Not just My parties... But every Party!
    So in a way you are right, Tagging will be a governor to raving, and may
eventually bring down the entire scene.   Now every rave promoter has to work
harder to make sure that this does not happen.   And We have  XLR8R to thank for
that.

Keep It Real

Subject: east coast vs. west coast - dumb thing
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

People, before it gets any further, can I just say anything I refer to as
far as east coast vs. west coast - IT'S A JOKE...  Don't take it too
seriously, I'm just playing around...  I think that whole thing is
bullshit, because they're total opposites anyways, and there are a lot of
beautiful things about both - and if you can't see that, you're just
extending the battle...  

Matter of fact, I just sent some guy back to Berkeley raving about how nice
New Yorkers are - why?  Cuz it was raining and I shared my umbrella with
him and talked his ear off the whole way...  Hope I didn't create any false
realities for him, hehehe...  JUST KIDDING!  Kewl thing, he's got email.

So anyway, yeah, I don't wanna start any ridiculous played out east coast
vs. west coast threads, because i think they're ridiculous, and i think
that if you can't find something to like a LOT on either side, you need to
open your eyes - and if you can ONLY see the "bitch don't fuck with me"
attitude of a New Yorker, try to see it as, "Hey I'm a bad ass and so are
you." Cuz when the "bitch don't fuck with me" attitude is a positive thing,
what you get is a lotta confidence and a lot of innovation that doesn't
come from anywhere else.  It's definitely a New York thing and that's not bad.

As for the wimpy jungle, I didn't want anyone to take offense to that - our
scenes are OBVIOUSLY very different - so what?  I'm not saying I don't sit
at HOME and listen to "wimpy" jungle - but i most certainly can't dance to
it.  But, you know what they say "Live in New York, but leave before it
hardens you.  Live in California, and leave before it softens you."  Those
of you who live in the city probably see the bottom levels of humanity a
LOT - here, you see it all the time pretty much no matter WHERE you are
(with the exception of the Upper East Side where people really DO believe
the death of Versace was comparable to the death of Mother Teresa) and
yeah, it hardens you a bit...  So maybe I'll come to California, show ya
how we do it New York style, and you guys can soften me up a bit.  I still
refuse to dance to wimpy jungle or call it drum'n'bass but that may just be
because we don't publish WIRED on this coast, hehehe...  I'm more than
willing to sit around and puff to it tho...

As for what parties are all about, you can put labels like peace & unity on
it if you want to but i think that there's so much more to it than that
that it's impossible to do such a thing.  Lucky for you guys tho, you can
go to an event and EXPECT that that sort of thing will be around.

And finally, for the person who made the comment about their dad being
cooler, I'm not taking you seriously, so please don't take me seriously
either - but my dad is uh "hella" cool (sorry, couldn't help myself) -
found him on the internet last year (no joke) and we've only known each
other since last september - but I'm just like him, so somehow I seriously
doubt your dad is cooler.  ;-)

At any rate, I can't stress enough how much to NOT take me seriously - and
I'm coming out there so hopefully I can meet some of you really interesting
people and have a good time.

Mwaaah,

dori

oh, p l e a s e. you don't honestly think i was serious????
bahhahhahahahah! jesus. i didn't realize you had just met your dad, and
over the internet to boot, so perhaps my comment was a little insensitive.
(apologies if this is the case.) but really, isn't this what kids say
nagging at each other? fuck. i really don't know what to say to your
response, or to the fact that you even found it necessary to defend your
father. i don't have time, nor do i care to make any, for this debate.

cheers - e. :)

 Hey kidz. Take it the fuck offline. We don't give a shit about your

I don't know if you two are aware of this, but part of this list is to promote
and discuss things rave related which goes beyond the topics themselves. It
should also be respected by you two to handle your opinions more fairly and,
perhaps, in a more subtle manner.
How does it help to refer to Mother Theresa as:

"Fuck Mother Theresa"

or 

"We don't give a shit about your relations"

Granted, these topics may not belong here in this list, but certainly the way
you handle your thoughts and how convey those to other people on this list is
definitely something to consider. I, for one, thought that being part of the
rave scene has in part an obligation to tapping into those things that we see
as positive things and applying them to the real world: Respect, openness,
maturity, happiness, dialog, and RESPECT (I have to say it again, it feels like).
To handle yourselves in the manner above is ignorant, non-caring, and
certainly brings the list down. We, as a rave culture (should we all believe
there is one), are only as good as we treat ourselves, those around us, and
those that we do not agree with. If you have to strongly state a position
about some humanist that others may care about, post some supporting thoughts,
and (gasp!) make an effort to tie into the rave/music scene. I'm sure we would
all be appreciative of being educated. If we must tell someone that the topic
is inappropriate for the list, try to send a seperate private message or at
least a publicly posted one with some *tact* that helps the list rather than
degrades it.
Anyway, I know the above topics are non-rave-related specifically, but it
makes me angry when *we* treat each other so callously. Being part of
something greater than the *average* means some amount of work is needed and
even things like posting to a mailing list filled w/ like minded individuals
should be handled with some respect.
Otherwise it makes us and our interests/beliefs a joke.

Well, my thought on this is that you guys seem much more "family" than most
east coasters do - which is another reason why I joined your list...
Sometimes I need a reminder that there really IS one.

       Well, I've realized that I have to take a break for a while.  My
life has become too overwhelming, and raving and being a part of this
list is too much of an interference/distraction to keep my problems at
bay.  It seems as if my life is lived full of extremes.  I've had some
of the most incredibly good things happen to me (i.e. getting into
U.C.Berkeley, etc.), but it seems like every bit of good is tempered
with 2 or 3 things equally incredible, but bad (getting beat up by ex,
etc.).  Drama follows me around like a magnet, and I am fighting a
losing battle.  I am dealing with extreme depression, friends and family
who think I'm an addict (I think they're wrong, but self-doubt is
creeping in), an asshole ex who keeps toying with my heart and won't pay
me back for all the money he owes me (among his debts to me, the $115 I
had to spend on a new graphing calculator for my Calculus class after he
lost my old one, and the $203 that he told me he'd pay me back for if I
got a pager (the sight of which is a constant sickening reminder that
I'm broke because of it), since he'd been hounding me to get one so he
could get ahold of me), the possibility of school being permanently
damaged, supposed "friends" who won't pay me back, not being able to put
gas in my car for the commute to school each day, and now a tide of
bills that, although relatively small in dollar amount, will affect me
quite adversely when not paid (i.e. phone, credit card, parking
ticket).  I'm actually not very much in debt money-wise and I have the
money to pay for it coming to me, but it's not coming to me until the
end of this month, and unfortunately, that's after I've suffered all the
penalties from not paying the bills now.  And the penalties are way
severe.  Money doesn't do you any good if you get it too late for the
payments.  No, I can't ask my family for the money.  They have made it
clear to us kids that we are NOT, under any circumstances, to ask them
for money for anything.  And I don't know anyone who can help me with
this, so I'm stuck.
        I have to leave this list and take a break from the scene for
several reasons.  If I stay on this list, all my woes will come shining
through in each post I make, and spending my time and energy reading the
flood of posts is not the best way to tackle my ever-present problem.  I
have too much pride to come out and ask for help (this being the closest
thing I can manage) and I'm at a loss for knowing anyone who could help
me, and the longer I go without help, the more prone I'll be to whine
about all the shit, and I don't want to do that to the list.  I gained
the nick SmileGirl and I don't want that to change by my making more
depressing posts, so until I can smile again, I feel it is my
responsibility to not be on the list.
        I've never felt more alone in my life, and raving has not helped
me at all.  If anything, it's left me feeling more alone, since when
I've had really rough days/nights, it's been hard to find anyone who
really wanted to deal with me. And I've tried to go out of my way to
help other people with money, love, friendship, an ear to listen, good
advice, etc., but when I've needed things from people, I haven't found
anyone willing, most of the time.  I'm getting bitter and losing faith
in people, and that's not like me.  I don't like feeling this way.  I'd
rather go back to believing that everyone is genuine and true.  I'd
rather go back to feeling I can count on people and rely on them.  It
was so much nicer being able to trust.
      People seem to only be my friend as far as the next party.  People
only call me in regards to parties.  If we are all a community filled
with love, friendship, and unity, how come, for the most part, our
friendships don't extend past raving-related activities?  I love all of
you genuinely.  I have a pure heart, and people don't realize that when
I tell people they can call me for ANYTHING, I really mean it.  But here
I am, regarded as quite popular by many and knowing a huge amount of
people in the scene... yet, when I'm crying because my parents are
jerks, etc., or when I'm jumping for joy because something incredibly
wonderful just happened, I don't have anyone I feel I can call to tell
them about it, good or bad.  I don't think I should feel that way when I
appear to have so many friends, but it's true.
      Everyone in this scene talks as if they'll be friends forever.  I,
normally an optimist with regards to this, have been in the scene since
1992, and I can only name 1 or 2 people from a few years back that still
keep in touch with me.  Reality sings a different tune with regards to
these oh-so-important friendships and bonds that we make in the scene.
I think the main reason for this is that many of this scene's
participants have not made much of an effort to forge friendships based
on anything but raving and its related activities.  If you want to truly
be my friend, be my friend.  God knows I need real friends right now.
But please, please, PLEASE, be my friend in more ways than just being a
party pal.  Go with me to a comedy club one night, go hiking with me up
in the meadows of the Sierras, or just simply spend a day with me at the
beach (when there isn't a party taking place at the beach).  It doesn't
matter, just do something with me other than raving.  Call me to tell me
about the promotion you got at work, or the A you got on your Psych
exam, or to tell me about the date from hell you just went on.  No
matter what it is, it's important to me, good or bad, because I care
about you, a real  person, not just a raver I know.  There is more to
life than raving, and I started to lose sight of that.  I'll always be a
raver.  You can still call me for that.  You can still count on me to be
in attendance at future parties (after I get out of this slump, that
is).  But please show me that PLUR extends past the parties we go to,
and this list.  Please be true and real.  I need to be able to count on
something for a change.  I love all of you.  Sorry I used up so much
bandwidth with my depressed mood.  Goodbye for a while...
                                     Love,
                                          Julie Mae
P.S.  I am unsubscribing right after I send this, so any responses to
this need to be forwarded to me personally.  You can still reach me at
this e-mail address.  I can't pay the bill though, so in about a week,
you may have to address e-mail to me at SmileGrl1@aol.com if the mail
daemon returns mail sent to this address.  I can also be reached at
(209) 984-3918, and when that's busy, you can call (209) 984-5151.  My

Oh my gawd!  

  So much vibe, so little time!!! It's days like this that make me feel
all warm inside; knowing, that I live in San Francisco.  Okay, I went to
People's park at around 2:15 and ran into TeknoDiva and Michael (DJ
Ulrich?).  The music was phat and the people were kewl.  I caught the
beginning of DJ Ghost's set and was as happy as a flubbertye could be.
But I had to move on to meet with friends and go to the Tsunami preview at
Golden Gate park.  We caught the last thirty minutes of the last set of DJ
Simon...Woo hoo!  The chills and the Thrills and all the happy people made
me insane like a sugar high :)  Anyone out there who doesn't know where to
go tonite...GO TO TSUNAMI!!!  I am still sweating like hothouse hony.
It's a shame that I missed Tuyashi (SP?) Suzuki's set (my friend Claire
keeps on insisting he's the bomb; she first heard him at Berlin's Love
Parade--today is his West Coast premiere...show him what we're all
about!).  Okay, okay, my ride for Friends & Family is two hours late, so
I'm heading back out to People's Park for a warm-up.  I sometimes get the
feeling I'm chasing my tail...hmm, naaaw.  I love it here, I love it here,
I love it here!


Okay, CHill y'all.
:)
M&m
...all this and sober too :)

OK, WHere shall I begin?  I headed out around 11:30  to B.A.R.T. with My
friend Greg.  After a nice long ride and losing Greg's wallet, we winded up
in berkely.  Walked a ways to Telegraph, and met some ravers on the way there
(MAN! They can spot us coming... and I wasn't even candied out!)
Arrived at People's Park after milling our way down Telegraph.  It seemed
bigger than I remembered, because I had been questioning if it was a big
enough park to hold everyone.  NOt many people there, but it was only noon.
 Seanie Boy was messing around on the turn tables, while everyone sort of sat
and enjoyed the music.  Only a few people dancing. 
More and more people showed up, overall, there was a fairly large crowd.
 Lotsa happy people.  Greg seemed to enjoy himself.  I hung out with Ulrich
for a good while! HI HI HI!! And Met Kathleen (I hope I got that right) from
SFR.  UM.. DJ Ghost's set was dissapointing.  WAY Clubby, played out,
oldskool.  I don't know.. I was in the mood for something else.  He threw a
really good party, though.  There's just sumthin about the Ghostribe sound I
don't like.  MAD PROPS to JOEY!! The second he came on everyone ran to the
tables!  
Seanie Boy's kids were there... and let me tell you-- they get mean and Dirty
with their super-soakers.  Sure cooled me off, though.  Is it true the little
boy got to spin durring his daddy's set?? wish I could have caught that.  I
never heard Jeno go on and I didn't see him.. was he there?  I don't know.
 Moshe's set, very clean.  Everyone else I kind of space on.
Hello to Jeremy(I finally met you!) Nik, Neptune, The Oakley Family, Sam,
M&M, Just Jer, Slim,Thomas the Glitterboy (nextime, nextime)  All the people
I danced with and the other's who's name escaped my mind.
THe down point of the day was when I couldn't see the oncoming four-person
mosh pit because of the glare on my sunglasses, and found myself sprawled on
the ground  under pounding feet.  Oh well, everything else was wonderful.
 OH! and hi to Vlad... you are just EVERYWHERE,,, aren't you??
I heard Moontribe is spinning there next Sunday.. anyone want to go???

Hi again :)
Does anyone know what the penalties are for getting caught with drugs?  I
heard from a friend that you can get 5 years in prison for a single tab of
acid, and 30 years for a whole sheet!  Is this true?  Do the penalties
differ for different drugs?  Is there anywhere I can look this info up, or
is there one of you out there that can post the penalties on here for the
more common drugs?  Do any of you out there know anyone who's gotten caught
buying or selling to undercover agents at a rave?
Thanks a bunch!
I don't wanna go to jail!!
Don't get paranoid!

HI, SFRavers :)
In general, which club (between Nikita, Release, and Spundae) do YOU
prefer?  Which has the most rave-like atmosphere and the friendliest crowd?
I just picked those 3 clubs since those are the ones I'm most familiar with
and the ones I can actually attend (because of working hours).  If you have
any other club suggestions, let me know. Just looking for opinions :)
Hugs,

I  think that was pretty harsh. I'm Moslem so Mother Theresa is not
someone
I looked up to ,but I respect her as someone who made alot of sacrifices.
She took
care of the sick and dying,  she soothed alot pain for those people.
What pain did she cause for you or anybody else?

Well Fuck!  How much do you need?  If it's not that much, as you say, I'd
pitch in $10-20, and if a handful of other peeps on this list did, maybe
that'd help you out somewhat.  I'd gladly toss $20 if I knew that it was
seriously helping someone out...

Well folks?  It's only the cost of one party...

Subject: RAVE SCARE

My friend told me the other day that on the weekend of Area 51 
Journey Home, but supposedly not at that rave; certain unknown 
people were going around poking people with syringe needles and then 
coming up behind them handing them a card that says, " Welcome to 
the world of HIV."  
	He said it was on the news also.  Does anyone know what is 
up with this story?

					TERESA
--------------------------------------

I heard that at every Rave, their is One syringe that gets thrown and 
where it hits nobody knows and when they look at the syringe it reads, 
"Welcome to the real world of HIV."  I just HEARD this, but now that 
makes 2?  maybe more.  I don't know what's up with this.  Haven't given 
it much thought.  If it is true, it could go both ways,
1.)  Someone is bitter about being HIV positive and wants others to 
share his/her pain (although their are plenty of others experiencing it)

2.)  Someone is sick and wants to play a bad joke.

There are both types of people in this world.

 Hey there,


         Well, it's been some time since I talked to a friend who is a
lawyer, but drugs charges and penalties are broken up in two different ways;
        first, what the drug is. Some drugs get charges that come with
higher penalties (ie. dust, pcp, heroin). So the type of drug carried does
effect the time in jail/charges.

       Second, then the weight comes in to effect, which sucks. Now with
weed or coke they do not include the weight of what it is carried in,
plastic bags. With acid, they generally include the weight of the paper or
other substance that it is in. And, as you would guess the more weight, the
worse the charge. The reality is you may only have 10,000 micrograms of
acid, which is a fare amount, but with the paper included, makes it seem
like allot more.

Peace, Luv, & Hugs

:Hi again :)
:Does anyone know what the penalties are for getting caught with drugs?  I
:heard from a friend that you can get 5 years in prison for a single tab of
:acid, and 30 years for a whole sheet!  Is this true?  Do the penalties
:differ for different drugs?  Is there anywhere I can look this info up, or
:is there one of you out there that can post the penalties on here for the
:more common drugs?  Do any of you out there know anyone who's gotten caught
:buying or selling to undercover agents at a rave?
:Thanks a bunch!

Nope I didn't take the message that way at all.
Okay, I guess it's time for me to spill my guts a little bit, too...

Your mail touched me in a way, because well, I don't know exactly, but
because you were in a situation and you are trying to deal with it.  As
I've posted before, I recently moved out here, and had to break a 1.5 year
long live-in relationship to do so.  My ex didn't want to come out here,
partly because of money reasons, so I had offered to help/support her as
much as I could, even to the point of helping her pay for school if she 
decided to go back, and she basically didn't even recognize that I wanted
to help her out...which kinda hurt.  And, she has a bad habit of NOT
dealing with money problems...she ignores them, in the hopes that they'll
go away...until the bill collectors come knocking on the door, or the IRS
starts garnishing her paycheck, or whatever.

And here you are, with money problems, and it sounds to me like you're
actually TRYING to deal with them, but timing has fucked you over, because
you won't get paid until AFTER your bills are due.  So I think, I've got a
pretty good job, and I'm sure that there are other peeps here that do too,
so if 5 of us throw together $20 each, that's $100 for ya right there, and
it might make your world a bit easier.  I TOTALLY didn't think you were
trolling for handouts.

I'll toss $20 in the mail for ya tomorrow.  Hope it helps some.  Glad you
got your kids set, too...that's really cool.

My ex woulda ran out and bought a new pair of shoes..it's why she still
owes me rent.  :P

YEAH!!!!  finallly somebdy posted EXACTLY what i was thinking when i 
read that post from a representive of Feel Good Entertainment.  many 
MANY people who i have met in the scene are not liking where it's 
going lately, and perhaps due to production companies making PROFIT 
off throwing parties!
all i'm gonnna say is if throwing parties is your meal ticket, then 
get the hell out this 'industry' cuz your losing sight of what it's 
all about.

Two lovers interested in spiritualism and reincarnation vowed
that if either died, the other one remaining  would try to contact
the partner in the other world exactly 30 days after their dying.
As luck would have it, a few weeks later the young man died
in a car wreck.  True to her word, his sweetheart tried to
contact him in the spirit world exactly 30 days later.

At the seance, she called out, "John, dear John; this is Martha.
Do you hear me?"

A ghostly voice answered her, "Yes Martha, this is John; I can
hear you."

Martha tearfully asked, "Oh John, what is it like where you are?"

"It's beautiful.  There are azure skies, a soft breeze, sunshine
most of the time."

"Well what do you do all day," asked Martha.

"Well Martha, we get up before sunrise, eat some good
breakfast, and there's nothing but sex until noon.  After lunch,
we nap until two and then have more sex until about five.  After
dinner, we go at it again until we fall asleep about 11pm."

Martha was somewhat taken aback.  "Is that what heaven
really is like?"

"Heaven? I'm not in heaven Martha."

"Well then where are you?"

"I'm a jack rabbit in Arizona."

 Check Hyperreals FAQ page for answers and leads or point your browser at 
any states web page/legal situations regarding drugs.

 BTW you just identified yourself as a drug user and/or pusher on a public 
mail list that is most likely monitored by some law enforcemnet agency. 
In addition all posts are archived and accessible to the public. Get more 
paranoid.

 BTW are you stupid or fishing for flames?

Subject: DId Someone Lose Film @ MeggaBuzz??? (URGENT)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org

Ok.. THis is really tripping me out.. I put a second roll of film into my
camera at MeggaBuzz and it was Kodak.  I took a buncha pics (not good ones or
NETHing Special.. just pictures)  So I get home and Take the roll outta my
camera.  IT's Seattle FILm Werks Film.. and it has to be shipped in special
and takes a week to get developed.  OK, no problem.  I'm thinking maybe in
the dark I accidentally slipped in a different type of film.  SO here it is,
a week later, and I get the pictures back....
                         THEY ARE NOT MINE!!!!

   I don't know whose pictures I got developed, but they aren't mine.
 There's a few shots of SFR people.. Lara, Amanda, Ulrich, AND EVEN ME!! I'm
in one of the pictures.  So is Ivan (the buzz lightyear guy) and Neptune.
 Two of the pictures on the roll are ones that I took.. but the rest of them
are a mystery.  How did someone else's film end up in my camera??? IS anyone
missing any??  This is one of the strangest things that has ever happened to
me.. UNLESS someone and I had the same camera and they got switched durring a
group photo.  IF so.. .DO you KNow WHo You are??? DO you have my camera??
IT's a little Water-Proof Olympic automatic mini.  I"M Laughing about this..
but I kinda wanna figure out what happened.  The main pictures are of a Curly
haired girl (are you on the list?? I don't remember your name?) and some are
taken inside a Van or something with wood panneling and blue curtains.
 Please.. SOmeone contact me.  This is just too too wierd.

That shit is just too funny because that was something the way my week
went. First of all I would like to say that this years Freshmen are itty
bitty! On the first day of school I was walking down minding my own
buisness when some freshmen (trendy ass girl) stops me and saids "Oh my
god, do you go to raves and stuff??" I said "What's a rave?"
She said "It's like this big party in where everybody does a whole lot
of drugs." I said "Hmmm, nope don't go to those."
She goes "You don't know what a rave is? Cause you look like someone who
goes to raves!" I said "I don't know what a rave is, bye" She goes "Bye"

Then like the third day or so I am watching some Freshmen breakers bust
some moves (but they can't) to some crappy rap coming out of their boom
box. So I ask them if I can put in my tape and I put my tape in and they
go "Oh is that Techno music?" I say "It's Cyber Trance" cause that's
what it was. They say "Do you go to raves?" I said "Why do you ask" They
said "Cause they play this trippy music at those things and that sounds
like it." Then on top of that they asked me to rave for them. Like I can
represent the whole scene. So after a while i just left.

Pretty smiliar weeks hu Patrice?

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

yeah, check THIS out:
my boss who's totally cool, wanted me to bring some of 'my' music.  
so i brought in a couple of mixed tapes, one jungle, one house, one 
trance, whatever.  then this dork who works with me constantly asks 'IS 
THIS RAVE MUSIC??"  i go "no, it's jungle".  i wouldn't mind 
asnwering his questions to the best of my ability, but he needs to 
phrase them in a non-dorkish way.  people are just uncultured i 
guess.  :-)

I had an amazing time at Tsunami.  I just let go and let that goa trance
strike that primal chord.  The vibe was great.  The crowd was on the whole
more mature than many of the raves I've been to, and everyone was having a
great time dancing.  There weren't any people standing in front of the dj
with their arms crossed at this party, no siree!  The flourescent murals
of butterflies, and cybermandalas were gorgeous.  Upstairs, the dj played
some slower trance stuff with breakbeats.  everyone was getting funky,
down and dirty, all under a hippy mood umbrella.

I really fed off the energy of these guys wearing black vests with
a single patch on the back.  Do they signify an order of
brotherhood, or are they little storage vests?  At any rate these guys
were spreading love, peace of mind, and shaking their bums.  And then
there was all the trippy flouro patterns, and flouro crochet pants, trippy
ass visual clothing.  

Great party.  hope I get to read some reviews of FnF.

regards,

I completely disagree.  If you really feel that way, don't spend your
money on the FGE events!  (Hopefully you won't do that.)  If you sit
down and think about it, putting together a rave or any good event/party
for that matter is a HUGE undertaking. (have you ever tried it????) It
has to be done by those that have a good amount of time to deal with all
the elements.  I don't think he meant anything by "industry" other than
the fact that his money goes to an organization that dedicates it's time
to putting on other great parties and events.  He has been in this scene
creating, for the most part, fabulous large events that we enjoy....he
obviously isn't making so much money that he's moved to Jamaica, sipping
rum & cokes and forgetting where he came from.... They even put out
great mailings and a newsletter.  I enjoy the big (licensed) parties as
well as the smaller UG's and I do remember just a few days ago, there
was a post giving out to some of the UG promoters for some difficulties
people had with one of their parties. (I also enjoy a party to start
within a few hours of the posted time...not up to 5 or 6 hours later!!)
You should take your frustrations out on the City for busting all the
UG's.  There are different issues surrounding all the events but just
remember that there is a lot of pressure on the promoters who are
running things..... I believe making a bit of money is part of the
appeal, but just as long as it's not the main issue,which I don't
believe it is, I don't think it's fair to put down ANYONE who takes that
much time to make it possible for you to have a good time. 

And that's all folks.....
:-) Melissa

I must agree it was a bitchin' ass party.  The maturity of the crowd was
actually kinda new to me.  It could be because it was at the Troc.  That
GOA last night was hard ass, knock you right in the face techno.  Man
this stuff was INTENSE.  Oh yeah, and the decorations were fucking BOMB. 
They were hella trippy with all the blacklights.  The one that fucked
with my mind the most was the one of that body that looked electrocuted
all surrounded by those eye balls and shit.  Good thing I wasn't fryin'. 
I had the time of my life.  The only bum thing was that I thought there
was going to be CHILL room.  There was for a short bit but it turned into
more dance type stuff.  Oh well.  It was still awesome.  Oh yeah, and it
was by the loudest party I've ever danced at.  My ears and shit were
still ringin' the next morning.  Shoulda worn ear-plugs. 

Byroni, dude, you woulda hated it.  :o)

Bye everyone.

do you have any strange triangular markings behind your ear....
sometimes you have to look close to see them.

  I think people have lost sight of the fact that a party is supposed to be
you and your friends, and their friends.  You can't really socialize at a
3,000 person party the same way because you spend 90% of the time wandering
around the place.   It's like a step above socializing on the street
outside your house.  Face it though, we're addicted to partying, we're not
going to stop.  
 
   I'm going to say we gotta go private.  We have enough friends with phone
number books of their friends, no fliers needed.  

 Rave was so cool to me when I started and it was more underground.  That's
why I love the list, where we can organize parties right here sitting on
your booty, and don't have to worry about all the shit we have to worry
about at a "rave" that I'm not even going to mention.  Your not supposed to
worry about syringestabbers at a party.    Sanity rules my charter deep sea
fishing boat...

  raving gear of the 00's (that how you say it?):

	lawn chairs..  seriously expect me to spend 20+ hours awake with no chairs
again?
	this list
 	bullet proof vest (shut up elf..)

So it's like 7.30 AM and I really don't want to get off my UncleNoah ass 
and go to work but oh well, looks like I'm going anyway, but not until I 
write to you kids a little. :)

I went to a party this weekend in San Bernardino called 'Computer 
Controlled'.  Now, I've been to SB for parties before nad I've always had 
a fairly rotten time.  I've been rather dissappointed in the SoCal ascene 
in genereal lately.  I miss the closeness and that really friendly vibe 
that I love so much in the Bay area and it just hasn't seemed to exists 
down here.  I find myself just walking around a party for like a couple 
of hours and then realize that there's really nothing interesting going 
on and then I go home.

This was not the case at Computer Controlled at all!  The venue had a 
bunch of really cool lighting effects (including a couple of nice 
lasers), a bunch of speakers that made my vision all blurry from the bass 
vibrations when I stuck my head in them, and a bunch of really friendly 
folks from the SoCal-Raves list.  The music was acid/Detroity-techno for 
the most part and there was none of the b/s that I usually encounter at 
SoCal parties like fights, people trying to be "hard", or a myriad of 
other bad vibe bullshit.

I wound up sitting in the chill area outside for a good part of the 
evening with a really cool woman who was on her first E and a whole bunch 
of other SCR list folks.  OH! and the other thing was most of the SoCal 
list folks had on laminates!!  Everyone was running up to each other and 
meeting and hugging and smiling n'stuff.  There were big group hugs on 
the dancefloor (sometimes we'd grab non-list people and they would get 
kind of upset at first but then succumb to the love!

So it looks like laminates have made it to SoCal, a greater sensee of 
community among people from the internet list is growing...  it looks 
like  the only thing that's missing now is E-kisses :D


I miss you SF folks a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I hope you're all having a nice 
day and that you're being careful out there and everything.  I'm sure 
I'll see you all soon :)

I'm one of the smart kids who does an occasional stupid thing.  In other
words, I'm just human.  Besides, in my post, I didn't say I used drugs or
pushed them on anyone.  I just asked for some info.  Who said it was for
myself?  And the "I don't want to go to jail" part was meant to be funny!

You mean they don't play jungle at raves?  For people who don't know
about raves, I don't tbink they'd know how else to phrase the question.
Sometimes I even say "rave music" because I'm trying to encompass ALL
the different styles in my sentance.  Now the poor guy is probably even
more confused than ever!

First one I can think of right off the top of my head that I use all the
time is X-Radio.  Go to http://www.x-radio.com
There are all different kinds of genres to choose from in Real Audio
format.

     Hello all,
     
     Looking to the weekend ahead, the SFRaves calendar appears to be 
     light. 2 massives, and an outdoor event... I Was wondering what people 
     are planning for this weekend. Are there any events that have not made 
     it to the list yet??? 
     
     Here's to a great week. Much love to everyone. Happy Monday! Peace!

don't worry, i didn't spend my money at the FGE event, nor will i.  
not everybody 'enjoys' this large and somewhat dangerous events.  
i went to the planet new year make-up party, which i must point out 
WASN'T a fge party, but a massive none the less, and i watched two 
girls get in a cat fight and i got pushed back against the wall.  
ouch!  that was 1 in 4 fights that i personally witnessed.  so i stayed 
outside mostly.  
but to me, that's just not fun.  it's not fun to be a part of, to 
watch, or to even be 10 feet near.  and you don't need to be sailing 
on the love boat sipping rum and cokes to be making a profit.  find 
another meal ticket is all i'm saying.  
no, i have yet to throw a party, but someday i probably will.  and i 
sure as hell won't charge 20 bucks a head at the door with tight ass 
security patting people down.   
ok, i'm going to end this before i really start pissing people off.  
sorry, i didn't mean to offend anyone if i did.  just my two bits.
take care
have a good rest of the day
-doreen.

Hey kids!
here comes my shameless classified.

My friend Kathy and I just graduated and moved to the Bay Area
to join the workforce.
Are any of you from around the Sunnyvale/Santa Clara area?
If so, drop us a line--we'd love to party with ya, rave or otherwise :)


By the way, coming from LA, I gotta say that that SF bounce kraks me up.
I don't know how you guys maintain so much energy!
But then again, I dunno how Angeleno ravers maintain their hearing
from all da speaker-tweakin.
I went to the HomeBase Megabuzz last weekend and ended up in ER.
Some kind of misunderstanding between me, Oakland police, and a
few milligrams :)
Great party though!

-Huy

     I sent this out earlier today but it never showed up on the list...
     <take 2!>
     
     As of this afternoon I will be unsubbing from SFR since I won't have 
     this email account after that time, and I'm leaving the job that goes 
     along with it.  So, don't send any email to 
     "robert@mail.geometrics.com" from this time forward.
     
     My new email account will be, if anyone needs to send me an email, is:
     Scooby420@rocketmail.com
     
     However, since I don't have a pc, that's not a very efficient way to 
     reach me in a timely fashion.
     
     I will be doing volunteer work at ARIS all day Saturday and Sunday so 
     I probably won't be out raving much this weekend, but hopefully next 
     weekend.  
     
     Any good vibes (or jobs? :)  please feel free to send my way... 
     
     plurry hugs and all that,

Since this will be my first venture in the land of SF Raving, I 
figured this may be a good chance to invite any other newbies to get 
their chance to SPIN for the first time (in public, that is) at my/our 
fOaM party. I have a few 'seasoned veterans' that I'm hoping will be 
there, but new talent is always welcome, no? If you are interested, e me 
and we can hook up.

so let me get this straight....you are slamming <being judgemental and
rude> to this person b/c he doesn't know anything about "your" music or
scene....

> trance, whatever.  then this dork who works with me constantly asks 'IS
> THIS RAVE MUSIC??"  i go "no, it's jungle".  i wouldn't mind

imho....this statement is rather hypocritical. you are calling someone a
dork and uncultured and judging them based on their knowledge(or lack
thereof) of music and culture that you are into....give me a break....this
person is technically correct anyway... if you were to define "rave" music
as a genre...would you _exclude_ jungle or D&B from that list of types of
electronic danc music played by DJs at underground parties? I think not.

Its rather sad that a cool, hip "raver" like yourself could be so
judgemental, closed-minded, and unaccepting of someone who does not meet
your standards. And then for you to take the time out to post about what a
dork the person is......to SFR.......thinking that 400 other ppl will agree
that this person is uncultured and a dork cause he thinks jungle is "rave"
music....jeez. Think before you speak/type.....please.  You are the one who
needs to be cultured and gain an education, not the "dork".

Actually, there is a type of music called "Rave" although the guy 
probably wasn't talking about that at all. Rave is like Hardcore 
Techno or so. But there is such a thing as Rave. This doesn't apply to 
your situtation though because this moron doesn't know whats up.

2 weeks and i haven't heard anything about it since (i'm not patient enough
to go through all 485 posts that i received while i was gone!!!)...

any info?

She said the right thing because jungle is not rave.
Those are two differnet music types. If you wanna get technical people 
jungle & rave fall under the catagory of Techno, even though that is 
differnt in a way. Oh never mind its so complicated.

   On A good night I would definately rather go to Nakita. They have 
good DJ's there on a more consistant basis then the other places, a 
little better variety of music, good chill space, and it's larger...

But that's just my opinion ;)

I'd have to say Spundae, I've seen some crazy sets there (DV-8 more so
than 1015) however, Norman or B.B. Hayes at about 5:00 in the morning
upstairs at Release. If you like house these boys can throw down.

Hey all, can anybody identify this track?  It's a Real Audio mix at...
http://www.groovetech.com/  Then click on DJ's/Artist, then click on Sang-Do,
Then click on his Funky-side mix and scroll in about 2/3 into the mix.  The
track in question has a little guitar solo with real 'rolling' type background
beat.  Cool tune. :)


Thanks,
       Eric

(this didn't work the first time, so i guess i'l try try again)

after some choice emails regarding my weekend at burning man got
strangely redirected towards my work environment, i've come to
recognize the wisdom behind all these silly email names.  thus i am
reborn before you :

                         $$$Messiah Wannabe$$$
                       <messiahw@rocketmail.com>

thats right, if you're tired of christianity, muslim-ism, hinduism,
buddism, new age and manson, but are too lazy to come up with you're
own spiel, i'm your man.  my tithes are quite reasonable, and i would
NEVER EVER tell you that sex is bad...

right.  regarding the nosy questions floating around on friday when i
first tried to post this:  i'm 29, and my sign is cancer (though i've
always considered myself more of a virus)

so anyway, i was at the end up on sunday morning.  oddly enough, i was
completely sober - my roommate invited me just as i was getting out of
the shower, and i thought, what the hell...  well the thing was, i got
there, and well, i just started feeling, uhhh, strange.  out of place.
i mean, my eyes were all clear, my pupils were their normal size, i
felt like everybody was looking at them.  i put on some sunglasses,
but it didn't help, the lenses were black not green, a dead giveaway. 
anyway, i was getting a little nervous, so i started talking to
people, to see if i could, like, trick them into thinking i was fucked
up - you know, asking about where the after party was, "so what are
you on", etc etc, but after just a few moments, i'd start making jokes
or remembering their names or just generally sounding coherent, and
suddenly i was sure THEY ALL KNEW.  i would of just left but i was
more scared of the cops than anyone there.  i mean, as wierd as it was
it still felt like a safe place to be straight...

oh, better late than never, he's my suggestions for activities at the
foamE party:

1. a meditation course in the middle of the bubble morrass...

2. a foam sculpture contest...

3. slip 'n' slide or other suburban lawn games...

4.  a special room where x'ed out soapy ravers can snog, and maybe
check out each other's techniques...

hmmm, i think burning man has forever changed my idea of what raves
could be like....

yup. i'm on my way back. unfortunately, it's not for good. but at least i get
a chance to get away from sweden for a while. not to mention the chance to see
all my friends again! (and hopefully, make some new ones! *smile*)

i'm arriving in the bay area on thursday, and i'll be around for two weeks.
i hope to see you all at a party or two. i'm pretty damn sure i'll go to play
nice (i just need to figure out how to get there...), so any other suggestions
would be nice.

and oh, if you're throwing a party, be it a massive at home base or a house
party for 10 of your closest friends, and you need a trance dj...get in touch
with me. i'm bringing a batch of phat, new european trance shit, and i'd love
to drop them for you. =)

'til i see you all... much love and plenty of huggies! =)

ok ok ok
i really don't think i explained my story very well when i posted it 
to the list.  first of all, i have no problem explaining what kind of 
music is what (music of the scene that is) but this particular 
individual whom i work with will ask me "hey doreen, is this your 
RAVE music?" like every 10 minutes or so even when something like 
Beck is playing.  he basically asking to get a rise out of me.  which 
sort of worked.  no, i didn't lose my cool and say "you are dork cuz 
you know nothing about jungle"  seriously, i wasn't a bitch about 
it.  but it bothered me because i felt like he keeps asking just to 
poke fun at me and naturally, i took sort of offense to it. 
that is all.  i just don't feel comfortable playing my music at work 
anymore because of this.  basically, if i felt he was SREIOUSLY 
interested in learning what kind of music is what or whatever he 
wants to know about it, i would be more than glad to tell him.  but i 
don't to those who ask me in such a condesdcending manner.  
yes, jungle is played at raves.
no, he is not confused as to what jungle is because he doesn't give a 
fuck anyway, basically.
so, in the future, i will try to explain my story with as much 
details as possible.  geez, what a response i got!!

Wake up time! Hello!

Look, you are (probably) living in the most consumer orientated state in 
the most consumer orientated country on the planet. The fact that this 
scene is so much fun is going to attract the commercial element, cos 
they can sell this fun onto lotsa others....and make money.

The best way of sticking up for the true (non-comercial) scene is to 
keep it going....the underground will always be there as long as people 
are ready to inovate & keep things moving.

Surely by the time the commercial elements have started preying on some 
scene, the real scene will be moving on somewhere better?

I prefer to ignore the commercial scene-stealers (why give them any time 
whatsoever?) & get my kicks where i know the real fun is going to 
happen..........just keep your ear to the (under)ground

YEAH!!!!  finallly somebdy posted EXACTLY what i was thinking when i 
read that post from a representive of Feel Good Entertainment.  many 
MANY people who i have met in the scene are not liking where it's 
going lately, and perhaps due to production companies making PROFIT

all i'm gonnna say is if throwing parties is your meal ticket, then 
get the hell out this 'industry' cuz your losing sight of what it's

I was riding home from friends and family and passed someone
that i had seen at a party. We sorta smiled at each other
with a half uncertain look of " you kinda look familiar"
And since we were both zooming down the highway at 
*censored* miles per hour we couldn't speak to each other.

I thought that it would be nice if we had some kind of hand
gesture...kind of like the peace symbol of the 60's
Have you ever been on your way to a rave and come
up on a car of what looks like it might be a bunch
of ravers going to the same place as you ...

I was thinking of the v that robin williams used to make
in mork and mindy when he said nanu nanu or was it
spock with :live long and prosper....

what do you think? can we start a rave hand signal?

As many of you have seen, I occasionally actually get ahead of my work and
start some hella long and boring SFRaves message... it's this little
fiction I came up with in my head.  No politicans were harmed in the
writing of this story.

IF CHELSEA WAS A RAVER...

Excerpts from an interview of a proud new addition to the Stanford
student body...

Interviewer:	So, Chelsea, how have things been for you as far as
outside activities go?  Met any boys?

Chelsea:	Yep.  I like boys.  They are, after all, just under 50% of
the population.  The male vote is important, and although I'm not actively
pursuing a career in politics, it's good not to sever any ties.  But
honestly, some of my best friends are guys.

Interviewer:	Well, What I meant was, any possible love interests on the
horizon?

Chelsea:	Well, I am seeing this girl in my PreColumbian American
History class... she always wears her hair in these pigtails and wears
these hella worked pants that she buys used and then flares out with the
cutest little patches that she sews in herself... plus she's got a fine
little face and a pierced hood.

Interviewer:	Alright... well, er... so what have you been doing other
than that?

Chelsea:	What do you mean?

Interviewer:	Seen any good movies lately?

Chelsea:	No, movies kinda suck lately, except for the music.
Soundtracks have been getting better lately.  I listen to the
Trainspotting soundtrack all the time, and I'm stoked about some of the
stuff from the new batman flick.

Interviewer:	Oh, you mean the recent outbreak of movies featuring
Techno music in their soundtracks?

Chelsea:	Well... I don't really like Techno all that much, I'm a
little more into the edgier jungle... ya know, hard techstep, hardstep...
even some jumpup when I'm feeling freaky.

Interviewer:	My my... have you gone to any good ... er... jungle
concerts lately?

Chelsea:	Concerts? What egg did you hatch from?  I mean, I've seen
a couple live PA's... but no concerts.  I don't want to sit there with
Budweiser presents this, Miller presents that... it's all so old.

Interviewer:	Live P.A's?

Chelsea:	Yeah.  You know, when an artist performs live at a rave as
opposed to spinning.

Interviewer:	Rave?  Are you saying you go to raves?

Chelsea:	sometimes... could I get some water?

Interviewer:	So, at these raves... what do you do?

Chelsea:	Meet people, dance.  What do you think we do there?

Interviewer:	Oh.. I mean, there's just a lot of press about drugs and
craziness.

Chelsea:	No, no... It's about the music and the community.  Yep,
the people and the DJs and the general overall vibe.

Interviewer:	So do you have any favorites performers?  I'd assume
there's a couple DJs you like more than others...

Chelsea:	Um... I dunno.  I really LOVE Thad... I think he spins as
HAK now... and Science floats my boat, and he's so cute!  ReAch rocks
too.  But I don't just like jungle... I've been really into deep house
lately too.  Sounds really good... well... kinda around 5am.  I just like
DJs that get a fat groove on without getting stale.

Interviewer:	5am!?  So these are the genuine article these raves.  Like
the kind in England back in the late eighties, early nineties.  Hmmm...
Say, have you ever tried ecstacy?

Chelsea:	Um... I tasted it, but I never swallowed.

Interviewer:	So, any plans to get more involved in the scene here, or
is this just an opportunity to unwind from some of your grueling Stanford
cirriculum?

Chelsea:	Yeah, but not around here.  I mean, I love the people, but
the scene needs help in other places.

Interviewer:	Like where?  Seattle?  LA?

Chelsea:	No, Washington DC... I know this PHAT location.

Peace,
AndyW

Um... just keep playing the music.  I have reprogrammed at least 3 of my
coworkers.

One of them is this old guy with no hair that came out to see us at Slow
Roasted once, and you know what?

He came up to me after my set, and said "Damn... it's so neat how you just
kinda control the feel of the room with the music, while at the same time
playing music in response to the feel of the room... and that continous
music where the beat never stops... how long have they been doing that
for?"

It was a very pleasant surprise.  He wasn't a hippy... actually a little
too old to be a hippy (more of a beat really).

Don't make adversaries, take a couple deep breaths and educate.  I mean,
it doesn't do anything for anybody to hear that they are square, or don't
understand.  Just be patient, or ignore them.  They're obviously saying
something because you've given them enough information about yourself and
your weekend whereabouts to get them confident about their comments and
what the effect on you will be.

Don't let the bastards get you down.

p.s.	Does anybody else here think LoveLine is the biggest piece of shit
ever?  I grew up in LA, and was tortured for years, only to have it go
national after I finally leave.  Yuck.  Ew.  Phooey.

yeah, how about the american sign language symbol for the letter "e",
when I am driving my funky painted van down the highway, when I was
coming to and from the BBQ and Beats campout, I got 3 peace signs, one
wave, and one thumbs up, one honk, and one dude yelled out of his
cadillac asking if we had any "grass".  There is definitely a raver
comradery but I think the bulk of these folks were just cool people not
necessarily ravers.

Hi Foolish Fish I did not get to say goodbye to you after FnF!  But I
think I heard you pass by my tent and someone said "is Goldilox in
there?"  I heard your voice say, "yeah, probably sleeping"  I was konked
out, sort of.  So, sorry I didn't say goodbye!!!  WHOT A GREAT PARTY! 
Did you get to meet Denis Perone?  He definitely seemed to be having a
good time.

Hope to see you at the Lord of the Rings!  I may do a similar thing like
I did up at Galactic Newyear where I set up a second system,  But it's
not official yet.  

Peace,
Goldie

Good comeback Dori! 

Still think u need to get to listen to a decent DJ who can move u no 
matter how hard or soft its gets tho. One thing that ive noticed about 
the US (& had backed up by a lot of people) is that too many local 
"name" DJs are shite at keeping the flow going....they can do all the 
mixing & tricks but can't really keep it together on the floor.

Oh yeah, just to clear up....im not from the West Coast, im from London 
(im visiting, DJing, doing record co stuff & generally having 
fun).....so i dont have to get involved with all this west coast vs east 
coast slanging.....London towers over both musically so we can look down 
on your colonial bickerings & smile benevolently (HUMOUR ALERT....feel 
free to comment but dont get too heated!)

As for all that noisy jungle stuff....yeah i like but ive had it going 
for the past 8 years so something different is good....i don't know how 
long you've been into it but come back to me after 8 years & tell me if 
yer still jumping-up!


"Electronica"....you're dead right....which fuck-up came up with THAT!

i did all the NYC jungle bit when i first came over in July....lotsa fun 
but it was a bit like stepping back in time a few years....Konkrete 
Jungle (with Aphrodite funnily enuff), Jungle Nation, one of Dara's 
warehouse parties (with some soppy house following Dara's set....what 
the ?!?).....KJ was fun if a little cheesy like u say....i had a great 
time in the Smelly Apple...can't wait to get back

Following on from some of the East vs West comebacks, my own feeling so 
far is that NYC is one of the friendlier places ive been to....it was a 
great place to start my trip ......SF is a great place too but i sort of 
get the impression that people are a bit to cool here to be toooo 
friendly....altho the rave scene does't really follow that....
Having said that i have met some really good people & did get to the 
best party ive been to in the US (see my Tsunami posting).....

Well ill be back in NYC on the 16th & i think i may be playing there @ 
some point.....and be off to some parties too....then back to London & 
some rest (fat chance!)

Keep hard-assed bitchin' Dori,

see u in the Jungle

hey sweets - re: your comment as to "having fun whoever I am" - well, 
I'm
dori and what I say here is pretty indicative of who i am - cuz unlike a
lotta people, i'm the same online and off...

I had a slight feeling that that "pussy jungle" comment might piss a lot 
of
west coasters off - from what I've heard from east coast (pahdon me, 
DRUM &
BASS - over here in nyc we laugh at people who say that, cuz again, it's
that whole black clad vodka-swilling yuppie crowd and music industry 
goofus
crowd that uses that term, they tag it on with "electronica: - tell me 
THAT
phrase doesn't make you barf and I WILL laugh) anyway, from what i've 
heard
about the west coast scene, y'all are kinda into that - whereas in new
york, we like to get slapped in the face with the hard jump up base
lines...  Perhaps it's the different vibes of the cities - but, yeah, I 
was
sorta waiting for someone to take offense to that, and yeah, you're 
right,
i was referring to the Bukem/Goldie SHITE (a term most brits I know 
still
love, hehehe) - you know, it's good for sitting in the park or whatever,
but don't get that shit near me in a club or a party, hear me?  Cuz it
makes me sit down.

As for the use of the term "intelligent" - yeah, you guessed it - more 
than
likely, I as well included this word in quotes, because I think it's
ridiculous as well - as I said before, it's a term given to the wimpy
jungle beats by people who can't handle anything more...

as far as room for "some variety, melodics, rolling drums & a little 
>space in the music for you eh, so stuff anyone ("shit yuppies") who 
>likes it...........where to start..."

start with Aphrodite - he keeps it hard enough (although he gets a 
little
wimpy periodically as well) and those bass lines rolling enough to keep 
me
interested in his experimentation while my butt gets movin' to the 
beats.  

Ya know, the reason I like the word "jungle" probably has a lot to do 
with
where I LIVE - people in new york take their jungle SERIOUSLY and hell,
this city is known for being called the "koncrete jungle" ya know...  
(We
even get a cheesy monday night jungle thang called the same, headed by
Shitslinger and TC Islept, absolutely the WORST MC known to man)...

> "Electronica"....you're dead right....which fuck-up came up with THAT!

Just a note-

I think it's funny that people have problems with the catch-phrase
"electronica"...

3 years ago, friends of mine had an electronic-music college radio show
at CMU in Pittsburgh called 'electronica', and there's a music-makers
email discussion list also called 'electronica' that's been going strong
for just as long...both were started by Tom Butcher from Hyperreal.

I've been calling electronic music 'electronica' longer than the media...

:)

Now this was a goooooooooooooood party.....had nearly all the essential 
ingriedients...top DJs (Tsuyoshi Suzuki is one of the best....its just a 
shame he's taken this long to get over here....make sure he comes 
back!), excellent crowd of people (young & old, freaky & straight(ish)) 
giving such a good vibe, well decorated venue, relaxed management (where 
were they?!)......good fun.

I chatted to a good few people & nearly all reckoned that this was the 
best party they'd been to in the Bay....and it was the best ive been to 
in the 2 months ive been in the country.....it could have been a party 
back home in London, it was THAT good!

By the way, it was mainly Trance going down, NOT Goa Trance....lets drop 
the "G" word purleese..............

So total respect to the CCC crew & all who made it such a good 
night....and to anyone who didn't make it, look out for more CCC parties 
cos they obviously know wot they're doing!

PS Does anyone out there know Jordan (female, blonde, 5' ish, never 
stops dancing) & KG (male, shaved, piercings, DJ, dances sporadically) 
from Santa Cruz? I met them there but didn't get a chance to say goodbye 
& i want to get some tunes to KG....he's done some beach parties this 
summer @ Monterrey.........if you can help, please do :)

Yep...I was just wondering, in the event I only had energy to go out one
night on any given weekend, which way would I maximize my fun :)  Each has
the possiblity of being at 1015 Folsom, but they are on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday, respectively.

Yet another case of the media bastardising & over using some neat phrase

Just a note-

I think it's funny that people have problems with the catch-phrase
"electronica"...

3 years ago, friends of mine had an electronic-music college radio show
at CMU in Pittsburgh called 'electronica', and there's a music-makers
email discussion list also called 'electronica' that's been going strong
for just as long...both were started by Tom Butcher from Hyperreal.

I've been calling electronic music 'electronica' longer than the 
media...

Garage; which was never clearly explained to me--probably just Breakbeats)
in the London scene.

has more offerings, but the music isn't necessarily better.  I went to the
parties at The Fridge and The Gardening Club and The 'Shaft and the
whatnots all over town (the worst has been @ The MInistry), but wasn't too
impressed.  If the music happened to be good, the people were too cold,
but that's how it is with the blokes an' birds in London, period.

-->  	Ditto! I was at Logical Progression one night (not a pure jungle
venue, I know) with a good DJ/MC combo, but it still left me cold.  I
dunno, D&B, Breakbeat and Jungle don't do nothin' for me; but I _am_ able
to appreciate (and occassionaly dance to ;) ) a good set.


	Maybe it's different at the raves, but I didn't find any in three
months of searching.  I think the UG in London is dead and buried,
everything's just advertised in the Time-out.

perhaps...but we all belong to some kind of gang whether it be the
rebublican gang or the bhudist gang or the knitting gang
 or the police gang or the pepsi gang or what ever,
In fact I feel that since we no longer have the tribal ways
of community that being part of a gang/community is what draws
a lot of people to raving, Indian clothing tells a story about which
tribe you belong to, where that community comes from and what 
the beliefs of that tribe are. 

Our clothing tells a story about us too but seems like in many cases
that story is that we belong to the macys/ emporium capwell gang=)

my take is that the phrase "electronica" came from a Kraftwerk song, a
VERY long time ago, I had no idea it came from the media.  I forget
which song-- "musique nonstop" I think says "musica electronica"  Since
this song is engrained in most of our heads the catch phrase
"electronica" may have stuck.  It means electronic in (Italian?) 

What if people said "music that is created using drum machines and
keyboards"  and then elaborated...I think it would be funny.

Techno- same as above and then I really don't know.  Everybody has a
different opinion because it is used to describe anything played at
raves.

Trance- same as above with arpeggiating and flanging analog keyboard
tracks on every 16th note, song changes on the 16th and 32nd measures
and so on, 130-140bpms

Jungle- same as above with looped snare tracks and high hats on the 16th
notes, reggae samples (sometimes), de-tuned Toms used as bass lines, 2
or 3 breakdowns, 160-170 bpms

House- same as above with Kick on the 1st beat of every measure. High
hat comes in an 8th note later.  Samples of a woman singing a catch
phase or "wooohooohooo"  Simple FM keyboard line with 4-5 note riffs.
120-130bpms.

Industrial- same as above with Kick on the 1st beat of every measure and
the Snare on the 2nd beat, dark keyboards, samples from horror movies.

OK, WHATEVER!!!! (big w symbol)
I am, like, totally not serious, OKay!

Nope.  Worse.  Prodigy.  Anybody see them on MTV Vid awards? Dude can
slobber...ohmygodheskewl. I  actually like the first chembros album,
before all the hype started.  The second one sucks.

     Wow, I don't know what to say...  I've never had to really accept
things from people, nor have I ever really needed to.  But if you really
want to help me out, I have to swallow my pride and gratefully accept.
No matter how adament I normally am with regards to accepting help of
the monetary kind, I know that as screwed up as my situation is right
now, it would be incredibly stupid of me to refuse help, regardless of
pride.
      Just to make sure, though, I hope you and no one else on the list
felt like I was fishing for people to give/loan me money.  That was not
my intention at all.  I guess I was just putting some of my frustrations
into words and using the list as a sounding board.  If people want to
help me, I'll accept (hard as it is) and be incredibly grateful, but I
am, by no means trying to make people feel obligated by
pity/sympathy/whatever reason they might have.  I'm not saying that's
how you feel, either, but I want to make sure people know that I had no
ulterior motives/intentions in making my post.  Thank you, thank you,
THANK YOU, for caring about someone you don't know further than my words
that I have commited to this list.  If you're serious about the $20,
I'll let you know that it will be used to fill my tank to get to school
for a week.  I transfer to U.C. Berkeley in January, and I'm finishing
up my last few lower-division classes at a community college in Sonora
(a twenty-minute commute from my house), and I don't want the lack of
gas money to get in the way of my journey to my dream school, which I
worked so hard to get in to.  That's my biggest priority right now
beyond my beautiful girls, but thankfully, I have them completely taken
care of for the month and the only suffering resulting from my situation
is being taken by me and not by my kids.  I know that was probably more
information than you needed, but sometimes when people help people, they
want to know what it is being used for, how it is helping that person.
    Anyways, before I waste any more bandwidth with my personal
situation, I'll shut up.  But once again, thank you.
                                Love,
                                    Julie Mae

The strangest event has taking place.. 

I come home from work, and I have a new mouse pad on my desk. It's a really
cool MMX "See it! Hear it! Experience it!" 3D logo. But I still don't know
how it got here. Everyone that lives here has denied it. And they were
pretty sincere. No one knows what the hell I am talking about.. It's so
freaky, I wouldn't be surprised if my computer has disappeared by tomorrow
after work.
And that would really suck. Everyone at work would be feeling so sorry for
me, they would probably give me another computer. But where do you go after
loosing seven gigabytes of information, entertainment, and past
experiences? Who do you turn to? I guess I better delete all my nudie
pictures..

=]:. ..:.
I mean, ravE pictures.. Don't want nobody trying to black mail me when I
run for president. 

Thanx for the mouse pad nStuff.
Jeff
I suppose this could be, somehow tied to the ravEs.
Maybe it was this freakin annoying spirit that's been bothering me. The
ghost keeps making my tools disappear..And it literally try's to make every
little thing NOT go my way. Maybe it gave me the new mouse pad as a way of
saying, the jokes on me or something.

Yea, 

I have seen them fnck up on stage and be all punk about it like, "wasn't my
fault" Instead of just showing constructive awareness. Or playing into it.
I mean. You really can't fnck up with music. If you think you did, guess
again. You fnck up in the exact same way four times in a row to the beat.
You just added something new.. A freakin fill.  This even works when your
off key. But though guys don't have any intelligent noting in there rap
anyways.

I wonder if they were just sitting around getting blunted one night. And

 A hottie on the tables (yeoooow!  someone wipe the drool off my chin,

 So yeah, the dj's at this bar, got his SHADES on no less, this fine ass boy

  Hey!!  I saw him first!! I've been watching that commercial for days.  Is
there any way we can locate this guy and have him come spin in SF?? Of course
he wasn't reallly spinning in the commercial.. but we can dream, can't we??
Too bad they've stopped playing it and moved on to the second segment of the
commercial...

i know we have varying tastes and all, but ive been to the gathering, ive 
been to sunset, gateway, a bundle of FnF's, many ccc's, to burningman 
twice, and let me tell ya something magical happened at tsunami that 
makes it stand out easily as one of the best. pure raw energy! 
not being able to make it to that campout this weekend i ended up going 
to tsunami, totally unsuspecting of the immense experience in store -- 
they dont call it by that name for nothing =)
i hadnt danced so connected to everything and everyone in a long time, 
especially in the morning when daylight came into the room and everyone 
was groovin hard, smiling, tranced out till the last track... 




your local phreaked out day glo goan still glowing from burningman 
recharged to the max all over again.

	WHY OH WHY DID I PICK POWER CRYSTAL INSTEAD!?  Well, even though
Tsunami may have been a better party, I will not forget the fact that
I met a few incredibly beautiful SFRavers at Power Crystal.  I gave
two of them a ride to the party and the third was there.  
	As much as I regret missing out, I'm glad for what I got and I 
wouldn't trade it for anything ... except for a night alone with Teri
Hatcher.

Shit man, if I was a photographer at Stanford and they told me shit like 
"We'll fire you if you take a photo of a certain thing," I would organize 
a protest rally or some shit.  Private school or not, there's something 
in that Constitution about freedom of the press n'stuff.

I'm not advocating prying into someone's life over anything.

 and also (with all due PLUR), "in light of recent events" my ass! 
I don't really see the connection between a joke about Chelsea Clinton 
raving and a drunk driving fatality in France (I assume you're refrencing 
the Princess Diana media frenzy)

And another thing:
If the media is really so bad and all that shit, why did so many people 
watch that damn funeral on TV?  If Diana hated being followed by the 
media so much and so many people believe in her right to rivacy and 
everything, then why were there friggin robotic cameras following the box 
all across the damn English countryside?  I think that whole sha-bang was 
about the most disrespectful thing that the media could've done.  It's 
not like she's gonna pop up for one last good-bye smile, folks.  Put the 
cameras down and let her rest.

that's all

I think the main v-mail lists all the info about where you can get tix.  The 
number on my flyer sez 415.541.5030, there are local numbers for other areas 
but I don't wanna list them all.  Look at the sfraves calendar!

Looks like you can get flyers if you live in SF, Berkeley, San Jose, Sac, 
Santa Cruz, Palo Alto, Santa Rosa, Hayward, Portland, Seattle, and Las Vegas.  
There's a whole lotta SF ticket places.

Presale tickets are $25 (but I know here in Sac the store selling them charges 
a $1 service fee, so they may be more).  I believe they are $30 at the door, 
but I'd buy presales to avoid some waiting and save some money ($5 extra bucks 
for water)!

I'm getting my presales on Wednesday!  Woohoo!

Yeah, I didn't want to like make a big deal out of it or anything, but 
that's me in that commercial.  They put this wig on me n'stuff at my 
request 'cause I didn't want people to recognize me right off... and then 
I had them use jungle instead of just raw breaks as a secondary way to 
try to throw people off the track, but I guess it didn't quite work... :/

ONE COMMENT ON THIS:  Freedom of the press is exactly that; freedom of the 
press.  The press can and does regulate itself as to what to cover and what 
not to cover.
Don't confuse government regulation of the press vs private 'control' of the 
press.  Just because you take a picture or write your opinion about 
something, doesn't mean that anyone wants to or is obliged to print it.

Also, don't forget (I think) it was the paper's chief editor that made this 
statement.  Personally, the less I see of Chelsea in the news the better.

Shit man, if I was a photographer at Stanford and they told me shit like
"We'll fire you if you take a photo of a certain thing," I would organize
a protest rally or some shit.  Private school or not, there's something
in that Constitution about freedom of the press n'stuff.

OH MAN!

I went to the Prodigy's web site (www.theprodigy.com) because a viewer signed
in with us and said they found us on their web site as one of Kieth Flint's
cool web sites.
I was like, naww, that ain't right. It's not true.
I went there today on a whim, and BAM! there we are with only 20 other sites
(hyperreal.org included!) w/ Metalheadz and stuff.
That is sooooo cool. I've loved the prodigy for years (just saw them recently
when they played here), so to think that one of them has a remote chance of
knowing and reading the mag....SWEET!
it's at:
http://www.theprodigy.com/siteinfo/keithsit.html
Also, just 'cuz this is 1 giant BSP - check out:
http://www.newsreview.com

Citi:Zen just won the best of sacramento web awards for
1) General Excellence
2) Best Design
3) and Most Cerebral

The News and Review is Sacto's Bay Gaurdian or SFWeekly equivalent.

What a good week!

p.s. thanks for letting me BSP all over the place. I feel like you guys will
understand more than most about why this is so cool.

ah, 

one more thing: 
This week in C:Z - a review of LionRock's new album in Volume

on a personal note:

I am very worked up right now because I just learned that I can't go to Daft
Punk and it is very suspect that I will be able to go to BIG TOP.
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

I really want to get a chance to meet some of you (as I've been ranting and
raving :) for so long about) and I was hoping it would happen this week. I got
the laminate info, so I'll make one and when I find out when I can jam down to
some events, I'm gonna scream at everyone to hook up! (Probably provide some
incentives for everyone to make it - like "godiva chocolates for everyone" or
"free pictures of Chelsea raving" or something like that).

Everyone - Have a Fantastic Day!

Where to start? hmmmm <pause> Damn Dan! This tape is good. Cool
graphics and the track listings were the first thing that grabbed my
eye as I eagerly tore open the package. This tape is well put together
and you can tell there was some serious time involved. It flowed
perfectly and kept me jumpin' out of my cube (at 5:00am this morning).
I am more of a Acid House - Breakbeat kind of guy but this deffinately
opened some more horizons for me. I loved this shit. Thanks Dan - If
you were lucky enough to have purchased one of these you have
something to look forward to - if not you better start beggin' 8)

Nikita (along with Spundae) and Release are put on by two different
production crews. The Spundae guys do a great job of bringing in big-name
talent from all over the world... they are top-notch at this. They deserve
major thanks and support for bringing in the amazing DJs and live acts that
have graced their stage. While I think 1015 attracts some people who aren't
necessarily on the "good vibe" side, I think most of the people at their
events are there for the one thing that counts - the music.

You can't really say this about release - that's put on by Martel, and the
DJs are generally a very small crew who do most of his parties. Martel also
does I-spy at VSF on Friday nights, and the Leopard Lounge at the bar
"Blues" in the Triangle (ick!) on Sunday nights.

Personally, I avoid Martel's nights. IMHO, they have a really
pickup-oriented crowd who are there to see and be seen (or is that scene?)
and not for the music. Generally lots of attitude, soaked in alcohol. I
should qualify this by saying that I haven't really spent much time at any
of his nights recently, so I don't know if that's changed...

I do have to give respect to Martel, though, for his longevity and success.
It takes a lot of work to throw parties, and he's been doing it forever.


A final comment about 1015 - Whatever you think about the crowd, it's a
great large-size space, with a good sound system, cool lighting, and lots
of different environments to play in. It's not in any way "underground,"
but it's not a bad place. In a lot of ways, it is what you make of it. If
you're there with a bunch of friends, it can be fun. Remember that "vibe"
is very often as much your own attitude about a crowd, the music, and the
space, as it is what you're picking up off everyone else. (And while you're
sitting there, stewing about a place with a "bad vibe," you're sending out
those bad vibes yourself!) I've been at UG parties where everyone was
raving about the great vibe (no pun intended, of course), but I was in a
pissy mood and didn't think the vibe was all that great. And at "clubs"
where other people said the vibe sucked, but I was in a great mood and
thought otherwise!

Hello beautiful people,

Does anyone out there have or know of people who might have some room 
and love for a few kitties?  If so, please read the attached email from 
Diane (we work together) and give her a response at dbudjako@fore.com. 

I'm thinking about going to the party in Monterey on 9/20 - not sure of 
the name of that party and its date.  If anybody else is planning to go, 
how about kindly writing to me to hook up or meet there. 

Thanks and hugably yours,

I didn't see any aliens, but I did see a lot of things I'd never seen 
before:

Screaming Naked Guy
Space Station Mir
Geometric Trees
Disappearing Fences
Talking Rocks

I'm pretty sure that most of those weren't seen by everybody....

Memo to self: expect the unexpected.

So then you have absolutely no solid basis or first hand knowledge to

ignorant behavior.

Please speak for yourself, not  for everybody.  As far as I know, everybody
that has ever come out to a Feel Good event has, for the most part, enjoyed
themselves.  Maybe if you actually had first hand experience, then It would
place some value on your opinion.

That's unfortunate that all that happened at that $6 party.  But all
because you did not have fun at some other production companies massive,
you think that I should stop throwing parties and get a job?  WOW... that's
something I've never thought of...  Thank you so much for making that
revolutionary suggestion.  I have one for you that may be just as absurd.
Since you did not have fun at the party, maybe you should STOP Raving
entirely.  And what does it matter to you what I do for a living, you have
never come to support any of my events, so its not YOUR money that I'm
"supposedly" getting.... so where's the beef?

I wish you the best of luck at your party, whenever it is you decide to do
it.   I hope you have a great party, and charge whatever you want, and have
whoever you want there.  But whatever you do, please do it with a good
attitude and for the right reasons, because that is what is going to shine
through to the people that come to your party and create the vibe.

We are all entitled to our own opinion.... and you just read mine.

Let me preface this by saying I love sunset.  The house vibe on a lazy
sunday afternoon is always pleasant.

But you can't compare Sunset to Tsunami.  Sunset has been playing the same
style of music for about 3 years, that goovy house.  Tsumani, on the other
hand, had the most state-of-the-art dance music on the planet.  The psy-trance
at Tsunami was so far beyond any other dance music I have heard in the
bay area or anywhere.  Myself, and many others, had such incredible
expereinces there... dancing FAR beyond our physical limits, using
"jedi powers" to quickly bounce around the dance floor without bumping
into anyone (using extra-sensory perception to keep from hitting people
out of our line of vision).  Experiencing super-human strength and agility
that the music allowed us to access within ourselves.  I am still glowing
from what happened on saterday.

I guess what I am trying to say is, that there are levels we can take
this culture beyond our imagination.  It is parties like Tsumani that push
the evelope, and show us just how incredible our electronic dance music
culture can be.

But what blood-curdling screams the Screaming Naked Guy could belt out!

It was all good!  I am glad he was there to add that special flavor to

Well, after several on-again off-again false starts, it looks like I'll be able to make it to BigTop after all!

I'll be the slim guy with blond hair, beard, glasses and waaaay to old to be there. I'll try to remember to wear my PLUR mtn-raves T-shirt.

If anyone missed the ABC special Niteline report on BurningMan, or the Strange 
Universe segment on it last night, I taped them both.  The ABC report was a 
view of it from fairly conservative group's perspective, but it was not 
critical or condescending; actually, the guys in suits kinda sounded like they 
wish they coulda gone.  The Strange Universe segment was also positive, but 
tried to make it sound more occult-like and sensational than it was.  

Email me if you want a copy.  Might need to trade a mixtape or something, or a 
home video of you and your dog playing catch with a frisbee   :-)

I am going to avoid personal attacks and instead focus on just your flawed
logic. Here is an example of what is wrong with it:

(As an extension of your logic)

I dislike the KKK. I have been, nor do I ever plan on going to a KKK
rally to "give these folks a chance," or get "first hand knowledge" of
what they are about. Their reputation preceeds them, and I have no desire
to look much further. Am I therefore ignorant and disrespectful of them
and what they are about?

Now, it would be stupid of me to compare you to the KKK or any other such
nonsense. However, I hope that the above might demonstrate to you
that because someone does not have have "first hand knowledge" of you
and/or your events, a picture can still be drawn. Whether that reputation
is earned is of course always a subject for debate.

i only caught the last part of it, but i thought what i saw definitely
represented bman fairly. some key items:

* guy saying "this is better than television" to the camera
* sign saying "no spectators" and emphasis that everyone is a participant
* very few sound bites, the responses to questions were fairly in-depth
* emphasis on the importance of being non-commercial

i missed the stange universe segment...

opinion #1: i know promoters who charge $20/head and _still_ don't make any

#2: my first west coast party had 2 stabbings. shit. give me the tight ass

rather than as a nuisance... i've not often found security guards to be a
nuisance to me. but then again, i'm just there to dance and have a good
time. not to be clich, and i'm seeing my age more often than not in my
opinions of things, but times have changed. there are 12 year olds at
parties. doing drugs. there are weapons. that kill. wake up. yes, these
things happen (i think) more often at massives... but this 'scene' is an
urban one, which attracts urban elements, and along with that comes crime.
yes, i've found that i prefer the smaller parties. but you know, sometimes
you've just got to go and hear someone spin, and that might bring you to a
massive. so what all this dribble boils down to is that i'd rather have
fucking metal detectors if it will ensure a safe, good time.

oh yeah, and i've been under the impression that actually having these
tight ass security guards does help in keeping the cops at bay....

Crew,

Instead of calling the various types of music people who rave enjoy, why
not call it "dance music," or "underground dance music"?  That's how I'm
starting to refer to it.  After all, it's not found exclusively at raves.
Moreover
(hardly ever get to use that word!), if you let someone listen to a little
ambient,
or goa, or hardhouse, or jungle, etc., and tell the listener "this is rave
music,"
that person will get too narrow a view of what might be heard at a given
party.  Class?  Anyone?  Anyone?

Peace & beats,
Eric

Hey Josh_E..... kinda like Ralphy from A CHRISTMAS STORY?? :)

Try any bass ticket master, wharehouse, etc... they should have some.. or
you can go to the fillmore if they have a ticket office. I'm not sure if
they do... 

call 411 and ask for BASS...

I would hope as a result that you have a better idea of which "parties" to
avoid now. Rather than "give me the tight ass security" I much prefer
"give me people that aren't interested in hurting each other."

Sure, which is why I don't go to parties that I wouldn't feel safe at,
parties that there is no necessity to search people at. I really feel that
there are some trust issues involved, and by invading ones personal
privacy by seaching your body, the party-thrower is expressing their
distrust in you. This is the unfortunate side-effect of having
parties that are too big. Why go to a party where you don't trust the
promoter, and they in turn cannot trust you?

In my personal experience, it would be more appropriate to say
*EXCLUSIVELY* at massives. I have never been to a UG event where I have
witnessed a fight, stabbing, or killing. That is not to say they have
never occured, however I have never seen or heard of any.

B.S. Don't you think that the bored suburbanite gangster wannabes don't
cause as many of these problems as anyone else?

All that it helps ensures is that there will be less metallic objects at
an event. It ensures *nothing* 

Want proof? When going to SFO on countless occasions, I have a
several inch long folding pocket knife that I regularly carry with me. I
also carry a lot of change, a phone, two pagers, various pieces of
paper, etc. in my pocket at any given time. I have found that if I dump
the knife on the bottom, with the change, phone, etc. on top, they *never*
find the knife. This is all in plain view, right in front of trained,
certified, security-cleared airport security guards. Now, how efficient
are those $5.00 rent-a-cops? Want to bet your life on it?

Hi fellows,

I have just called Kismet and been informed that it's closed. The owner is
selling it or something. I don't know if the sfravers can still get
together at Kismet on every Thursday as usual.

If you have any inside news or know if the Thursay event will still be
going on, please let us know. Thanks.

re:all the junk below....

the underground in london is nowhere near ded & buried....u just didn't 
find it............anyone who even CONSIDERS going near the Ministry of 
Shite is never going to get anywhere near wot is good in 
London..........the G Club & Shaft died out long ago too.....u lucked 
out kid!

As for Londoners being cold.........UK people in general will be more 
reserved than Americans in general....it just takes a little more 
effort.....a lot of americans i ve met who know brits, like that 
.......we are a completely diff. culture & so u should respect that when 
u visit  other places....it ain't going to be the same as being in SF or 
the US.....an open mind please.....................

(remember...it was a joke about the London thing!)


Remember: the best vibe is wherever u make it.....& that can be SF, 
London, NYC, A'dam, Barcelona, Hamburg, Berlin, Moscow, Sydney, Cape 
Town, Malawi, Bali, Pushka, Rio, Ibiza and many, many more 
places......go visit lots & lots of other places & then u may realise 
that no-where wins......and anyone who thinks that one place does, loses 
out on a lot of fun.....

One final thing....don't call women birds u sexist idiut!

Dutch (from what I remember of Dutch) or Garth--I would have added Dan,
but I wasn't too impressed by his Nikita performance last Friday *Hi
Glitterboy :) *.  I tend to think there is too much "Geridge" (aka
Garage; which was never clearly explained to me--probably just 
Breakbeats)
in the London scene.

has more offerings, but the music isn't necessarily better.  I went to 
the
parties at The Fridge and The Gardening Club and The 'Shaft and the
whatnots all over town (the worst has been @ The MInistry), but wasn't 
too
impressed.  If the music happened to be good, the people were too cold,
but that's how it is with the blokes an' birds in London, period.

-->  	Ditto! I was at Logical Progression one night (not a pure jungle
venue, I know) with a good DJ/MC combo, but it still left me cold.  I
dunno, D&B, Breakbeat and Jungle don't do nothin' for me; but I _am_ 
able
to appreciate (and occassionaly dance to ;) ) a good set.


	Maybe it's different at the raves, but I didn't find any in three
months of searching.  I think the UG in London is dead and buried,
everything's just advertised in the Time-out.

I am pleased to introduce the latest member in the XOR Clan.  Dexter, please
step up and say "hi".  Dexter is a lil shy he likes to hide in his secret
palce all day, but at nite he is one impressive dancer.  pulling off moves
no-one can cop.  Dexter grew up in Puerto Rico, in the jungle, not in the
trees though, underground.  As some might have guessed Dexter is a big hairy
tarantula!!!!!! He is not so scary though, except when he shows you his half
inch fangs.  Dexter is known as a Stripe Knee Tarantula, he is about 4.5
inches fang to spindle.  Pretty scary if he comes after you.  Well just
wanted to introduce my new friend.

bye

i know we have varying tastes and all, but ive been to the gathering, 
ive 
been to sunset, gateway, a bundle of FnF's, many ccc's, to burningman 
twice, and let me tell ya something magical happened at tsunami that 
makes it stand out easily as one of the best. pure raw energy! 
not being able to make it to that campout this weekend i ended up going 
to tsunami, totally unsuspecting of the immense experience in store -- 
they dont call it by that name for nothing =)
i hadnt danced so connected to everything and everyone in a long time, 
especially in the morning when daylight came into the room and everyone 
was groovin hard, smiling, tranced out till the last track... 




your local phreaked out day glo goan still glowing from burningman 
recharged to the max all over again.

Subject: Umbrella term for "our" music

Crew,

Instead of calling the various types of music people who rave enjoy, why
not call it "dance music," or "underground dance music"?  That's how I'm
starting to refer to it.  After all, it's not found exclusively at 
raves.
Moreover
(hardly ever get to use that word!), if you let someone listen to a 
little
ambient,
or goa, or hardhouse, or jungle, etc., and tell the listener "this is 
rave
music,"
that person will get too narrow a view of what might be heard at a given
party.  Class?  Anyone?  Anyone?

Peace & beats,
Eric

Hmm...  I dont believe that I could be more psyched about (finally!)
seeing 808 State and Moby perform live... but I have some small concerns.
What do you guys think this is going to turn out to be?  Ive been more
than my fair share of massives but I have no idea for example what this
space looks like (some convention centre or something?) nor do I know what
sort of vibe to expect from that sort of crowd (Rule of thumb : dont
expect good feelings from a massive crowd... the contradiction is that the
more people at a rave, the more alone you feel.  Am I right? :-)

I guess Im fishing for opinions from those who think they know whats going
to go down on Friday.  Your guess?

OK, I have a fairly simple question, based on the reports of flakiness I
have gotten from far and wide:

Will the Rider and Ed Rush be performing on Friday 12 September in the San
Francisco Bay Area?  Is there anyone who knows?  Is this all a crap shoot.
I would prefer to spend my 25 bucks otherwise if all I'm going for is one
local jungle DJ and like 808 State and other GIANTS of ELECTRONICA.

Are Grooverider and Ed Rush really going to be here or not, and if no one
has the answer, can perhaps someone turn me on to a person who has a
better idea?

CHEERS,

DUH,

gawd, i'm spamming again too...

i wonder if the screaming naked guy was from new york?  no joke, my first
night here was new year's eve two years ago, at this huge party in this
gigantic warehouse - before it got busted (in the middle of juan atkins'
unreal set) this guy ran up to me with his thang in his hand and yelled,
'Hi!  I"m the naked guy!"

this is my concern as well... the only 'massive' i've been to was not such
a great experience, but 808 state was the first party i ever went to in '90
- it'd be great to see them again. guess it won't be like it was, tho, in
some old warehouse in toronto.... i can't even imagine. it'll be HUGE!

my guess is that it will draw all sorts of ppl - other than that, i don't

me as well!

Yea, Troy I must concur.  I danced my ass off at Tsunami.  THe music
reached into my being and tapped into a very powerful energy source.  
Just between you and me, my legs are still super dooper sore.  I can
barely walk.  So much for super-human. :)

This party took my dance experience up to another plateau.   The grass up
here is greener, the air is crisper, the sky a deeper azure, and my soul
bubbles cool like a mountain creek.  Wait, what's that I see in the
distance?  :)

Does anybody what those black vests were that so many people were wearing
at that party?  They kind of looked like back braces with embroidered
patches on the back.

Having seen Juggernaut at this "International Event Center" as they're 
now calling it, lemme tell you the space is fucking huge. I thought I'd 
seen some big spaces before but this thing was like the belly of the 
whale. Two good sized side rooms and one monster. A few people came with 
lawn chairs, blankets, and lanterns, which was a new one on me for an 
indoor event. Hopefully the power situation will be a bit more sorted out 
than last time - the generators went out several times during Derrick 
May's set...Cheers!

Hi all -

 Anybody remember Berkeley's Naked Guy ? Back about three, four years
ago? A buff dude who had philosophical/political objections to clothes,
so started to attend his UC Berkeley campus classes in the nude.

  He showed up in his usual un-attire at some raves too. I think our 
Campout Naked Guy was too short & skinny to be the Original Naked Guy.

Thank you so much!

So many arguments arise from misunderstanding.  Many of the terms
associated with the rave scene are slang terms, based on personal
experiences.  There is not always mutuality among those experiences.  Each
of us looks through our own eyes and hears though our own ears.

Can you Describe...
House?
Techno?
Jungle?
Ambient?
Visuals?
Fashion?
Raver?
Us?
Them?
Me?
You?

These are all, of course, rhetorical questions.  But I ask everyone,
including myself, to try to stop before using labels as definite
descriptions.  They are really quite limiting.  Once you get past needing a
name for everything, you might be amazed at what you find.

Bye now,
Megan

OK, the spot is yes, it is THE BELLY OF A STEEL BEAST.

I was there also at Juggernaut, and I had a spectacular time.  Millions of
them, there are so many people there, but it doesn't get crowded.

Because it's so big, get it?  It's a really neat venue, BUT you should do
certain things:

1) bring a flashlight because it has many dark spots and who knows what
might fall out of your pants.

2) wear a pair of pants that are either black or that you don't care if
they get p00 all over them, because if you sit in this place I guarantee
YOU BATTY GWAN GETTIN DURTY, seen?

3) In fact, wear shit clothes in general because it's actually really
bloody dirty, and if you wear a crap sweatshirt and you're tired you can
use it for a pillow.

4) Not sure.


I am not sure if I'm going, I want to see the RIIIIIIIDER, but I've heard
he's been flaking, and Ed Rush flaked on a club gig last night in NYC, so
I'm LOSING FAITH.

Cheers,
PAX,
DUH,

Let me first preface this question with a preconceived notion I have: 
DJ's store their records in crates. I'm not sure where I got this from; 
perhaps pictures of DJ's with crates full of records or seeing a DJ  
using a crate to carry their records to a party???? 
 
So where the hell do you get a crate that records fit into?? 
 
I have now obtained two crates in which a 12" doesn't fit into *neatly* 
It seems these crates are only 12" wide; where records require a slightly 
wider space. I have since traded a crate with a friend who has one the  
correct size and I noticed something... 
 
Crates bought from a store are slightly bigger than the kind you find: or 
at least the kind I've found. Which raises all sorts of questions in my mind. 
In particular I can imagine the designer who came up with the 
size (imagine Spinal Tap): 
 
Designer: Well the crate is slightly bigger than 12" 
Marketer: Why is that?? 
Designer: Ya know, when 12" just isn't enough. You need that extra something. 
 
Is there some DJ originally come up with the idea to make and sell crates 
because 
their records didn't fit into a milk crate? 
 
Is there something else you put into crates (other than records) that 
require a size a little bigger than 12"  Other than ... well crates or rulers?? 
 
Do the clothes and things college students put into crates fit better in a 
12"+? 
 
Did some marketing person think 12"+ crates would sell better because you can 
only get 12" milk crates? 
 
Is this all part of a conspiracy?? ie. records used to fit into milk crates 
than  
they shrank them slightly to sell bigger ones to milk the DJ market... 
 
Damn it I want answers!!! Who is an Illminuati member and understands the  
burgeoning crate industry?!?! 
 
Extra question: 
Does anyone know the penalty for having a non "registered crate"?? 
 
Zza

yes, many cultures and many tribes had their ceremonies, and had some 
interesting gear to go with it.... i think thats more the trip its on

no, they just shrank them so everyone would stop stealing their milk crates
to stick their records in.

Dear Beautiful People,

Alex, Matt and myself have been throwing a free weekly for some time now.
For those of you who have gone, you know it's had it's ups and downs.
We've had some great talent stop by, we've had ambient, trip hop,
downtempo house, jungle, experimental, r&b, and other good, funky stuff.

But more importantly, we've seen a lot of new faces, and had an
opportunity to have a regular, nearly entirely SFR supported event in the
south bay.  It's nice to meet the people behind the posts, and the lurkers
and the hotheads... everybody has been a pleasant surprise.  Pleased to
meet you all.

So... one last chance to get roasted slowly this summer... as always,
free, but we'd appreciate if you help out the store by getting a cup 'o
jo (it's not our store, but rather a nice symbiotic relationship... they
sell coffee, we get to play with our friends). They'll even let you check
your email at the counter if you have AOL, a web based account, or a shell
account (you email geek, you... I bet you're reading email right now).

djs:	science * matt schmitt * andyw
time:	8-11pm wednesday 9.10.97
place:	City Espresso Roasting Company
	On Steven's Creek at Lawrence Expressway in Santa Clara
	Across Steven's Creek from Safeway
	Next to Rock'N Tacos, Payless Drugs, Mr. Chaus, BedBathBeyond

So come by, pull up a chair and get a mellow groove on.

We'll probably start back up in a couple weeks, as soon as we get the urge
to lift a sound system every wednesday again.  If we don't, it'll be
because we have something else in the works... cause that patio gets cold 
come December and some of you have been wanting to dance.  We'll keep you
posted (as if we didn't bsp enough already...).

Peace,
Alex/Andy/Matt

p.s.	Thank you all the DJs that have been by, all the people who have
taken time out to chill with us, and most of all the people who came
through with the rides, cartridges, last minute sets and pulled mixers out
of their butts to make this a weekly event all summer long (Noah + Li +
James!!! Woohoo...).  Thanks everybody.

Hi all..

I think that that post has the days backwards. I'm pretty sure that Enigma,
Porn Kings, Skylab2000 etc is *DAY TWO* not day one as it's listed here..

THE Naked Guy went to my high school.  When I first saw the news
coverage I laughed my ass off, cuz he was really shy.  Berkeley does 
funny things to people.  Hehe..  

I think it'd be pretty liberating to go to a naked rave.  Have there
been themed parties like this?  "In the Buff" "Turn on, tune in, get
naked"  In all seriousness, though.  I think after the initial
uncomfort it would be quite unifying.  No worries about trying to present
a certain image.  You is what you is.

Has anyone seen the movie, "The Full Monty"?  It's great fun watching fat,
skinny, awkward scottish unemployed steelworkers dance.  I highly
recommend it.

The underground is fun but I personally prefer the massives... the
intensity is what I need I tell you! :) I love the big parties but I like
the smaller ones too... nothing remains underground very long once enough
people are interested.. because people tell others, and it becomes wide
spread and main stream. I think if less people ripped on the massives and
went to one once in a while they would change their opinions...  (prepare
for flames!)

think they left this place tho.

*for the longest time, some of us here in new york on this wacky little
list called off-topik made it a point to try and find the damn things -
with no such luck - wouldn't you know it, shortly after whats-their-faces
took off for better planets, all the black Nikes on broadway disappeared -
makes ya wonder how many people REALLY wanna be here*

Damn y'all, have fun tonight - i'm going to a bar and right now i'm trying

actually i'd really love to see some true goa fashions around here,
they're completely nuts - imagine taking a bunch of drug addled,
ultra-hyper-fashion-oriented brits, and giving them more less
unlimited access (read: extremely cheap) to totally crazy fabrics by
the yard and tailors that charge about 50 cents to tailor a piece of
clothing to each individual's fucked-up personal tastes.

the vests are just what the two-week tourists buy...

The 12+ are metric...like metric wrenches are just slightly bigger.

<<SNIP>>

There's a group of folks down here in SoCal that call themselves NRA :the 
Naked Ravers Association... rumor has it that they throw naked parties.  
I haven't been to one myself, so I can't really turn in a review... 
But I suggest that if you do this by the Bay that you do it in the warmer 
months.  I've been freezing at SF outdoors with all of my clothing on 
before... :D

He first walked about naked in Cupertino somewhere down around Stevens 
Creek and DeAnza. Then he went to Berkeley. Can't really blame Berzerkely 
for this one, I'm afraid.

                     SEPTEMBER 19TH & 20TH, 1997
                        (see bottom 4 lineups)
 
************************************************************************

Alright Rave-kids... here's the scoop on the massive Liforce event
that's
going off next weekend (19th & 20th). This is Liquid & M.Mercury from
the
SFR mailing list. We've been working with this event since April, from
the
flyers, to djs, to lighting... we were there. We're not making money by
sending out this email, but just dont want ANY of you to miss this
event!
We know there is a lot of talk about what's going on, where, who, ect...

we'll let you in on the truth behind this party. It's real, it's legit,
everyone on the line-ups are gonna be there, it's going to be like
nothing
you've ever experienced.

We (Sherry & Ryan) have been working hand in hand with the head promoter
dude
since April. We've given him advice on the lineups, trying to get
together
everyone (djs & liveacts) we could think of people always WANT to see,
or
only heard about, designed the flyers, and pretty much advised him on
what
'most' ravers would want from the the best party they could dream up.

This is FCP's (first contact presents) first party, before they've been
all
involved in theatrical productions. We keep telling people, ITS NOT
(necisarily) THE DJS/MUSIC THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER... ITS EVERYTHING ELSE!
They're building these huge movie-like sets and props, lights & lasers
sets,
make-up artists from Startrek! for the aliens that'll be there :) and
so much more; we can't wreck the surprise for you, and tell you
everything!
It's gonna be so fun, we can't believe it's in less than two weeks.

Another note:
Some people are talking about 2 other things. Corporate sponsorship and
price.
Yes this party is being sponsored; they are Southwest, American,
Dollar renta Car, Noahs Bagels, and Starbucks. Yes, they're
corporations, but
look at who they are... they're there for a reason; the airlines are
flying
people out, the car rental place are for the same people, and the
remaining
two are giving out a free breakfast for everyone. Of course all of them
will
make money some way or another, but they will be helping elements in
making
the party better. Think how different that is from someone like NIKE or
MTV
sponsoring a rave.

And price... yes, we all know that raves (some atleast) are getting more

expensive these days. But are the parties getting better? Some are...
but
how offen do you feel that your $20 or $25 or $30 is well spent? We
dunno,
but sometimes we feel a little let down by just black lights and
speakers
for the price. Granted, its not just the setup that makes a party great
but
really, what you're going to get for 25-bucks (presale) is going to be
some-
thing you will remember forever. Shoot, get the double-night ticket and
it's
even cheaper. Each night is going to be different, it'll feel like
another
party all together. Anyways, enough hype, enough explaining, enough
text,dang..
sorry this is SO long...!

*************
or 1-888-664-8879  for updates, the LINEUPS, info on FCP, and more...

So people... come out to this, you wont regret/forget it :)
We're here for your questions too, so email away, ok?!
It's going to be beautiful and we hope to see you all there!

Much love and dancing and smiles!
Sherry & Ryan (Liquid and Mercury)   - liquid hg design
 

P.S.  They're planning on doing a PRE-PARTY on the Thursday before that
will
      be free for the BOTH-night tiket holders, and $5 or $8 for
everyone else.
      They'll probably only have one of the smaller rooms open with a
few of
      the djs below, but will give you a taste! Our guess is, that if
you go
      to ThAT, you'll go to the next 2 nights for sure :)    You WILL
SEE!

I do have spam filters on sfraves and all hyperreal lists.  Someone else
(Noah, I think) is on another one of the lists in the spam, and replied,
and since he's on sfraves his reply got through to sfraves.

This stuff is all best dealt with if you just IGNORE it.

is very much the type of party im looking for. i know a couple people on
the socal-raves list went to the last area 51 and did not have very good
things to say about it, so as much as possible, i want to avoid that sort
of thing

if anyone can help me out, id be incredibly greatful

i know that there is a sfraves calendar and all, but sometimes, the better
parties just arent advertised on the calendar, so it is down here in la anyway

thanks for your time, bye

The ABC report of it was amazingly good - the commentators were talking in
very positive terms about how people have gotten fed up with being passive
consumers and Burning Man is a place where everyone is a participant.  The
best quote of all: it's like what Halloween used to be when you were
younger.  They also nailed Washoe County for being so harsh on the permits
and costs.  What was just so keen for me was that much of what they were
talking about also rings true for the rave scene, at the scene's best.

hey guys... I've been searching around on the net for info on microdot,
but can't find anything. Does anyone here know anything about this tiny
little pill? It's a small orangish press tab, about a millimeter thick
and about 2 millimeters in diamiter. I've heard it's acid, mescaline,
and concetrated shrooms, anyone have the real facts?

ps. I've never seen, bought, or injested this drug, just curious.

hehe just saving my ass =)

Yes - definately a SoCal thing.  Back when I lived in San Diego, I once
went to a crazy party out on the water.  There was a little boat taking
everyone to and from shore, as well as between the *2* party barges.  One
was a big ass boat, owned by some rich old dude that owns a bunch of strip
clubs down there and is just down with the ravers.  In fact, he let us use
his boat for a Right To Dance demo one time - it's docked in direct view of
City Hall.  Anyway, there was a second, "clothing optional" party going on
in his huge floating castle - 3 levels of madness.  There was this crazy
ambient lounge - lots of red carpet and mirrors, naked bodies chillin' all
over the place.  MAn, wAlking into thAt party wAs A moment to remember, let
me tell yA!  Wait...
I just did.

	I'm slightly concerned over what to expect at BigTop also. If anyone has
been paying attention, they have been advertising on Live105 (local radio
station). Anything that comercial has the ability to attract the wrong kind
of crowd. I'm just hoping enough fellow ravers with the right attitude show
up. Great acts, don't get me wrong, but just to big. But in usual fashion,
I'm going to try and make the best of it and just have fun.

PS. Is there any meeting places for fellow sf ravers in the works?

	Usually I don't like to go to big music festivals, but I'm going to be
hitting two of greatly different genres this weekend. One, of course, will be
BigTop and the other is (slightly embarrassed) Kamp Kome. I do my best not to
support commercial garbage like Kome, but this show has one of my all time
favorite bands, the Violent Femmes playing. I was curious as to if there were
any other ravers making an appearance (or trying not to be seen) at the show.

Actually I've bought excellent storage crates at Home Express.  They are
about $4.  They come in all different colors.  Just look for the over sized
ones not the milk crate size!

Take care,

Umm..So yeah. Bassbin Twins is one guy named Pete Houser. I guess he's
from LA, thought the article I'm looking at doesn't say.
(http://www.mixman.com/urb/bassbin/index.html)

I know he's defiantely from the US, though. Perhaps they're confusing
them with the Bassbin Kittens which are from europe.

and shrooms comes from the fact that mescaline is a synthetic
hallucinogen just as LSD, but its effects are commonly compared to those
of 'shrooms.

from the alt.drugs lsd faq:


ommon Drug Slang Terms (NB: many of these refer to the carrier, ie,
"Blotter"

        or "Sugar Cubes".  Often the local names will refer to patterns
printed

        on the blotter, eg, "Blue unicorn".):


        Acid, 'Cid, Sid, Bart Simpsons, Barrels, Tabs, Blotter, Heavenly
blue,

        "L", Liquid, Liquid A, Lucy in the sky with diamonds, 
Microdots,

        Paper acid,  Sacrament, Sandoz,  Sugar, Sugar lumps,

        Sunshine, Tabs, Ticket, Twenty-five, Wedding bells, Windowpane,

        etc.


also: mescaline is one of the active hallucinogens in cactii. mescaline
in a pill is just a purified version. so, it's not truly a "synthetic
drug".

I have heard that also...like on hit is 100 "mics" , but I don't know if
"mics" is short for microdots.
However I know that Microdots are exactly what I iterated in the

Mics is micrograms. Microdots are generally LSD in pill form, despite
common misperception that they're mescaline.

Can someone please repost (or email privately) that last RealAudio enabled

It's the one that runs 24-7, but not the pirate-radio one. I think it was

Actually, there are two forms of Mescaline. There's the "organic" version,
made from cactus stuff, usually it takes the form of either green sludgy
goo, or the more refined blue-green crystal shards.  There's also a
"synthetic", non cactus, lab version that's a lot more concentrated.
Depending on the production process, this version can be an orange, yellow
or white powder/pills.  

Having had some experience with both versions, I can say you need a whole
lot of the organic version to get anywhere, as opposed to NOT a whole lot
of the synthetic version to get stuck in a Picasso painting for 16 hours or
so...  I'm not so sure I would classify mesc as a recreational drug.  A
spiritual tool perhaps... To each his own I suppose 8-) 


You want the real "low down" on this and other fun stuff, read PHICAL by
A&A Shulgin.  You'll get a lot more info there than from web sites based on
hearsay and urban myths...  Plus a lot of the Clinical chapters from the
book are already on the web.

Er..uh..not that I advocate the use of illegal substances...n'stuff...

well that does it. what *is* this world coming to, when you can't see some
of your favourite djs without having to deal the masses??? ;) eh.... i
think i'll save my $25 for a more fruitful endeavour. too bad the dead
concept of taping shows hasn't caught on within this scene.... yet.

Zza~

 i formally werked in a dairy and i do believe ive worked out this whole
crat/size situation....

ok the average width of a 1/2 gallon milk container is 3 5/6 inches, and when
working in a business often places to store things isn't always available so
they wern't trying to conspire against DJ, they were attempting to save space
on a very minute level.
I don't know how many different dariys milk crates you have currently been in
contact with but i have found that wrekkids fit quite nicely in a Model Dairy
crate, they use metal around the top of the crate for re-enforcement while
making their plastic sides thinner. Also Odwalla crates have the same
structure.
As for fines surroundthe possession of a crate, it is up to $10, 000 and a
jail sentence, it should say that on the side of the crate. Most of the
crates say:
WARNING!
use by other than regestered owner prohibited by law
NO. 34564-34567
I have no idea of why this is so damn expencive but i think thet they
probably get a lot stolen and it effects their funds having to buy more
crates. 

As for the ones in the store, usually most of them arre used as sort of cheap
file cabnets and i think thats why they make it a little bit bigger, so you
can fit all thost wacked shaped papers in them...

 well if you have anymore questions, maybe i can help...

well, me and the two people i showed up with arrived at 9:00 or so.  
i was wearing my baby blue cords as promised, but unfortunately 
didn't run into anybody who's on the list.  but, i thought that daft 
punk tore the shit up!  i had a very good time, and am glad i went.  
the fillmore is kind of small, and it got hot, but i've been in way 
WAY more sauna like conditions before so i didn't mind.  the crowd 
seemed really cool.  i didn't get any dirty looks or get pushed or 
anything if i accidentally bumped in to somebody trying to walk 
around.  everybody seemed very....drunk.  and happy.  ;-)

My opinion,
 There will be so many people at this concert thinngie that. All the lovely
ravErs that hate me so much will take up such a little tiny fraction of the total
turn out....I won't even be trippin.  =]:...

 I think it will be....Off the hook? Did that sound 90's or what?



I wonder if there will be bungie jumping? I wouldn't mind jumping off one of
thoughs loading cranes.

This is most excellent news.  I wanted to go to this, but someone (which
will remain unsaid) told me these guys weren't going to show.  That they
had other gigs else where.  

In any case my best friend is going so she'll enjoy it at least.  For
myself I'm to poor to spend that amount of money at this time. =(
(buying records on credit cards finally caught up to me)

God only knows how much I wanted to see GrooveRider, Nico, Ed Rush, etc....

I'll just have to look at pictures! =)

I even missed Dj Rap this monday the 8th at Ultra, huh?  What a bummer.
Maybe I'll get to see Diesel Boy this coming monday!  Anyone else going?

Take care,

Siphon ;)

 Hello again,


       First. a mircodot, started in the 60's. It was generally LSD,
sometimes, it my be mixed with mescaline. It was and last time I seen it the
same shape. A tiny little dot. I had a friend who lost 8 hits, do to the
size.

      Next, a mic is slang for microgram, which is a measurement of drugs,
in general. From Digixion, which is a heart medication to Acid, mescaline.
The average amount needed or taken is a bout 350 mic in a hit. Sometimes
there is more and that would be stronger. I was once said that Jim Morrison
went out on stage and had consumed 5,000 mic's befor that show.


Peace, Luv, & Hugs

Hey. I have a question for the guy who wrote this post. I wanna go to
some place to Dance this weekend and I do not wanna go to Big Top & a
beach party is not what i want. My friends and I are thinking about
Planet X. If I go, I can't dress candied up. What did you wear when you
went? I mean everything from shoes,pants,shirt,hat etc.

Also how are they there about checking IDs?

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

um, i make this a helluva lot easier on myself:

cute tanktop that makes me look gorgeous without the 'i'm trying hard' factor
jeans i can ruin (inevitably i spill or sit in something, never fails)
change of clothes if i'm outta town (leave those in the car tho)
too much money for you know what

i hardly think vivarin and/or vics are smart drugs - they're both bad for you.

and, pardon my attitude, cuz i'm a nice girl and all, but i rarely bring it
with me, cuz all eyes are focused on the dance floor here...

this girl would NEVER be seen with a pacifier...  maybe it's because
generally i substitute a cigarette or something, dunno. 

i do have to say tho, e is really bad for the orally fixated...

so maybe some people don't know this...  goa is a state in india on
the west coast, there are a lot of nice beaches, and for the last few
years (well since the hippies, actually) phreaks have been gathering
there, basically to party (as it costs practically nothing to live
there), generally on the beach on the night of the full moon, more
often than not to hard, german-influenced dance music, thus goa
trance.  as i mentioned above, the fashions spawned there are very
distinct and interesting...

First of all I would have to agree with Sr. Andy in the fact that Slow 
Roasted has been a success outside and behind the counter.  I'd say that 
everybody has enjoyed being a part of this event at City Espresso 
Roasting Co. and we'd all like for it to keep on happenning (if 
possible)  All you customers out there  (I wish I could be a customer 
tonight, but finances wont let me, Thanks mark and everyone that 
wouldn't ever cover my Wed. night shifts ;0) are great and I love being 
able to see all of my friends while I am working.  Once this thing is 
gone I am asking you ravers to keep on coming out to hang, talk, and 
talk to me :)
	On a sad note, I'd like to add  that a dear coworker, the Leo of all 
Leo's, Matt Schmitt and Allegra are going to be leaving to Seattle Wa, 
and this will be Matt's last Slow Roasted (I think) and if it is, well 
Matt, I really enjoyed working with you even though you thought I was  a 
"Big Dork."  You are actually a nice person which contradicts the 
previous thoughts I had about you in the beginning.  I wish you, 
Allegra, and Mohan if he is still going with you guys the best of luck 
in finding a good nest in which you will always let me stay at if I come 
and visit you?  Oh, and make sure the toilet seat is comfortably 
suitable to my big butt  :)  Take care and laters to ya all!

COME TO SLOW ROASTED TONIGHT!!!

You're right about the fact that when a production company gets a lot of
followers it ends up getting main stream.  I think that happens because 
the prod. crew and the promoters let it get massive.  If they are serious

about underground then you can keep it underground.  I personally feel 
that you can have a thousand+ people and it still can be underground.  
It all about the vibe and that is completely up to the people who go to
the party.
There are people that go to massives with all the  wrong intentions and 
I personally don't like to party with those people.  

                                                      STAY TRUE,
                                                                 THE BLZO

P.S.  You can have that intensity that you love at an underground party
if you have a packed warehouse full of the most hardcore, karma addicted,
loving ravers like 
ourselves:-)

   I have actually only gone to Spundea's on the big weekends.  Ya know -
Memorial, and labor day and I think on Presidents weekend.  And all were
phat!  Top dj's and sick sets.  My only complaint is there were soo many
people.
 Nikita, OTOH, I've been to twice and had an unbelievable time on both
nights.  I want last Friday and saw Jeno and Dan both in the main room
utilizing the 3 decks.  Dan spun for 3 hours and I can tell you he took me
to knew hights.  Damn that boy was good but some drunk bitch was yellin' at
Dan in the middle of his set saying he sucked...  I think it effected him
for a few songs and then he blew it up agian.  People were cool, lighting
was sick and all my friends had a great time.

I'd recomend Nikita to start your weekend out.  But I only go to Spundea
when it's big weekend and I don't have to work or go to school on Monday.
You'll need the recouperation after a Sunday at Spun

About Release I agree with Brian Benitez:

>Personally, I avoid Martel's nights. IMHO, they have a really
>pickup-oriented crowd who are there to see and be seen (or is that scene?)
>and not for the music. Generally lots of attitude, soaked in alcohol.

I know many people who go to Release to front and herd women.  There are a
few girls I know that go to show off their shit to the on lookers.  Not
much of a crowd for vibe and straight groove...

Wow, as in the 4AD band?  They were just in SF, I'm surprised they'd be

as far as gusgus is concerned... i was surprised too! i know that they do
the techno thing...but d&b?  
well i just found out that it's only one of the many members in the
group... can't remember which one, they all seem to have their specialties
in the group- i'd assume he ventures in drum&bass... any good? i have no idea!
i guess i'll have to go and see (hear) for myself!!!

I didn't see the yelling, but if what you say is true, it was completely
out of line.  My yelling was happening in my head, "Dan, you can do
better than this!"  Dan's set gets a C+ in my book.  The grading might
seem a little harsh, but I have high expectations when it comes to certain
DJs.    

Novelty moment of the night:  David Michael mixing in the theme song from

-->	That's the point.  I was comparing attitudes in the context of
party vibe, I was not bagging Londoners on their cultural differences
(okay, maybe a little; bread pudding, YUCK :P ).  Since you are more
reserved in the first place, that feeling of community is more lacking.  
In the small geographical contxt that is the UK, I've found the Irish and
Scotts more approachable, and for me, preferable.  Another comparison
(which you would dislike, I know; considering football and all), I think
the Germans are less reserved than the Brits (but hey, the Britisch Royals
came from Hannover in the first place), but not by much.  I do have an
open mind...my views and opinions are based upon a broad sample of
experience.

-->	I _have_ been to more than half the places you listed, and I
always make an impression because I give off good vibes wherever I make
it.  But I have the best time in this place because it is unique and gives
me good vibes back.  After all, it takes more than one good person to make
a good party.
	As a note, I wouldn't touch Moscow with a 1000 mile pole.  This is
my prsonal prejudice from personal experience, but I HATE Muscovites. I've
never had that many people (young and old) _SPIT_ at me walking down the
street before, just because I was Vietnamese!  The US shoulda' nuked them
when it had the chance. (Sorry everyone for passing on the negativity, but
I know there are other SEAsians on the list who might want to know) 

>

-->	I do not call womyn "birds".  I was using it within the context of
your national slang; you should call your own countrymen sexist idiuts,
not me.

-->	Okay, I made meeself a promise way back when that I would not
attend a massive again (unless I was with agroup of 4+ friends).  So I
will be at Moontribe's free PPL's Park party this Sunday in Berkeley.
PPL!  Ethan will be spinning for free!!! WOO HOO!  I might be there the
whole 11-6, but I probably won't wake up till one or two :)  Does anyone
know when Etha's gonna hit the stage?  I would really hate myself if I
slept through his set.  Who's gonna be there to meet me from sfraves?
Don't be shy, this widdle flubberguy is...err...not? :)
	I still have pinkcottoncandyhair, but I might get a haircut
tomorrow...a buzz maybe?  I dunno, I dunno, I dunno...I'll be in the ocean
alot and I need somthin that won't turn to jelly in front of my eyes...ja
know?  But I think I'll look like a dork with really short black hair (it
looks good bleached, but black?); help!  maybe I should shave it all off,
but I don't want a sunburn on my head either....
	Oh, err, I might go to Vertigo too...anyone else?

-->	I'm-a-not 100% sure ('bout 87%), but after getting my horoscope
from the super kewl Astrolog site I am  Aquarius (I always thought  I was
fishy before) with my rising sign, sun (in 1st Hse), and Mercury in
Aquarius as well. So I am 4 x more Aquarius than anyone else na-na-na :P
...which would explain many things; I am definitely weird :)

Anyone planning to go to this?  DiV's latest album kicks ass, so I'm 
interested to see what they're like live.  

Any SouthBayers interested in carpooling?

Okay... this rumor has been going around (featuring different themes) 
for a few years now. Quite possibly someone may have done this a few 
years ago (not at a rave) but out on the street or something. I believe 
that the human brain is great fertilizer and that seeds of this negative 
sort, are best left unplanted. So having said that.... "What syringe 
scare? Has anyone heard about some syringe scare?"
Didn't think so.

Hmmmm . . .

Well, being that before April of this year, I was one of those non-raver types 
that would listen to 105 if I lived in that area (we have 102.5 here), I'm not 
so paranoid that "those" people will fuck (for me) up such a beautiful (read:  
damn talented performers & djs) event.

For those of you who have been in RaveLand longer than I, the outside world 
isn't that bad . . . a positive attitude can do wonders!

So . . . I'm pretty juiced about Big Top.  Plus, Moby, Eat Static, and 808 
State probably don't have the non-raver appeal of say, The Prodigy or Sneaker 
Pimps or something like that.  But that's just my opinion.

P.S.  Oops . . . is this a flame?  sorry! (really)  I'm kinda delirious and

My opinion,
 There will be so many people at this concert thinngie that. All the lovely
ravErs that hate me so much will take up such a little tiny fraction of the 
total
turn out....I won't even be trippin.  =]:...

 I think it will be....Off the hook? Did that sound 90's or what?

I say:
Well, bad for who?  I didn't want to smoke or suck on a pacifier . . . I mean, 
I wanted to suck on something (ahem!) but not candy or toys!

Now that I'm through being foul, what I always need is a _map_, so I can 
figure out how to get to the party.  You know, I always seem to find a faster 
way to get to a party than the way they say on the voice mail.  But that's

Yeah, I think the syringe story is one of those urban legends.  I wouldn't get 
too scared about it.  Although there was a party in Sac where my friends saw a 
happy lil raved out syringe chillin on the bathroom sink . . . but from what 
they saw it didn't look mean enough to go sticking innocent raver kids.

Okay... this rumor has been going around (featuring different themes) 
for a few years now. Quite possibly someone may have done this a few 
years ago (not at a rave) but out on the street or something. I believe 
that the human brain is great fertilizer and that seeds of this negative 
sort, are best left unplanted. So having said that.... "What syringe 
scare? Has anyone heard about some syringe scare?"
Didn't think so.

I say:
Well, bad for who?  I didn't want to smoke or suck on a pacifier . . . I mean,
I wanted to suck on something (ahem!) but not candy or toys!

Now that I'm through being foul, what I always need is a _map_, so I can
figure out how to get to the party.  You know, I always seem to find a faster
way to get to a party than the way they say on the voice mail.  But that's

[BSP over, now some blabbering commentary]

I'm a little bummed

Does anybody else find it a little sad that the Bay Guardian, a weekly
publication that generates a lot of revenue from DJ driven advertising
doesn't have a clue about what's goin' on in their own back yard?  I
called to let them know that I wasn't exactly overjoyed that they
included Pablo's Sugar Shack in their editorial under 70's themed dance
clubs. I named a few DJs like Sneak, Garth, Jeno, etc. who have spun at
our club only to have the Guardian nightlife reporter say, "who are
they?" 

Seems to me that lately there are more DJ driven dance events gracing
their pages than live acts. But the nightlife editorial is always geared
towards some grunge or punk band that  all of 10 people witnessed down
at The Killowatt.

Is it just me? Perhaps I'm just especially bitter after the SF Chronicle
erroneously featured us in their "Clubs That Go Back To The 80's"
article a month ago. SF Chronicle writer Sam Whiting reported that 
"More than 1,000 people cram around the pool deck every Saturday night
to dance at Pablo's Sugar Shack."

The pool was removed from VSF (formerly the Oasis) over 5 years ago.

Like my friend Fajita Molly would say Whatever.

-SUNNY

P.S.  I guess I'm cool with being mis-labeled a 70's club but an 80's
club, that hurts.

that sounds correct... he put a single out recently - very nice, btw - 
a limited number was released, and it's supposedly being rereleased with 
the originally intended cover art (designed by Jeff Taylor, aka Deluxe).  
i can check the name of the single when i get home - i believe the track 
names were pangaea and arghhh... can't remember the other name... more 
info when i get home...

this has nothing to do with raves but could put and end to raving
and breathing if there is another accident....
Nasa is about to launch a probe that contains enough
plutonium to destroy all life on earth. If an accident
like the challenger or the recent space station re-entry
then plutonium will be spread through out the earths atmosphere
destroying all life and poisoning this planet for millions of years.
Aside from not having anymore raves there would be no more life...
not even coach roaches. President clinton is about to make
a decision on this. 

                http://www.sonic.net/~west/cassini.htm

Two important points:
1.The rocket that will be used to launch Cassini does *not* have a good
safety record.  It's been known to explode on lift-off.
2.  The half-life of plutonium far, far exceeds the expected life of any
spacecraft known to man.  Even if Cassini makes it safely to Saturn, it
will
inevitably fail at some point in the future.  If it fails to reach
Saturn,
where *will* it end up? Why are we unnecessarily polluting space with
radioactive material?

There has already been a mishap with the craft.  A hole was torn into a
compartment on board, and this may well delay the launch - but it's 
anyone's guess for how long.

>Might be a good time for you to schedule your vacation?  The protest is
spearheaded by the fact that Cassini will be carrying about 72 lbs of
plutonium on board.  After heading for Venus and orbiting twice there, it
will be sling-shotted on to Saturn, passing closely by Earth on its way
back
in 1999 - possibly close enough to enter our atmosphere.  What is NASA et
al
thinking?  


And here's an example of their petition: 

=================================================
No Plutonium in Space!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We, the undersigned, call upon NASA and our elected officials to suspend
plans to launch the Cassini space probe to Saturn as long as any
plutonium
is scheduled to be on board. Presently, the project calls for 72.3 pounds
of plutonium 238 to generate on-board electricity. The risk of an
accident
at launch or during its "slingshot fly-by" above the Earth is not worth
the
gamble. We urge the use of alternative on-board power sources such as
solar
energy and long-life fuel cells for all future space missions.

The "welcome to the world of AIDS" urban legend has circulated in many
forms... (lipstick on the mirror the morning after, note on the pillow,
etc. etc.). This is the first time I've heard about someone going around
sticking people with a syringe, but the "welcome to the world of AIDS"
tagline gives it away as just another mutation of the original myth.

     Whats up folks,
     
     Caught the crystal method on (blush) MTV t'other day. First I'd heard 
     of them so got the disc & have been groovin' to it all day. Lots to 
     like, sounds a bit like the earlier Chems stuff (before they got 
     sooooooooo *crap*) IMHO. Check it out.
     
     How did these guys get on MTV before I'd heard of them ? Whoop-Whooop, 
     out of touch old fogey alert !! Load-of-arse. 
     
     How about the SFR meeting spot @ Big Top ? Did we pick a time/place 
     already ? What a line-up - whoo-hoo !! Roll on tomorrow ....
     
     I'll be there in my Rupert the Bear pants, come say high .....
     
     Cheers,

[BSP over, now some blabbering commentary]

I'm a little bummed

Does anybody else find it a little sad that the Bay Guardian, a weekly
publication that generates a lot of revenue from DJ driven advertising
doesn't have a clue about what's goin' on in their own back yard?  I
called to let them know that I wasn't exactly overjoyed that they
included Pablo's Sugar Shack in their editorial under 70's themed dance
clubs. I named a few DJs like Sneak, Garth, Jeno, etc. who have spun at
our club only to have the Guardian nightlife reporter say, "who are
they?" 

Seems to me that lately there are more DJ driven dance events gracing
their pages than live acts. But the nightlife editorial is always geared
towards some grunge or punk band that  all of 10 people witnessed down
at The Killowatt.

Is it just me? Perhaps I'm just especially bitter after the SF Chronicle
erroneously featured us in their "Clubs That Go Back To The 80's"
article a month ago. SF Chronicle writer Sam Whiting reported that 
"More than 1,000 people cram around the pool deck every Saturday night
to dance at Pablo's Sugar Shack."

The pool was removed from VSF (formerly the Oasis) over 5 years ago.

Like my friend Fajita Molly would say Whatever.

-SUNNY

P.S.  I guess I'm cool with being mis-labeled a 70's club but an 80's
club, that hurts.

How about bringing:

[ ]	Cigarettes if you smoke, or smoke only at parties...whatever...
also recommended is a little tin to put butts in for outdoor parties.  A
lighter helps too.  I usually bring at least double what I would usually
smoke because... well, most people don't bring enough, and sometimes, I
smoke more than usual at parties.

[ ] 	Money (enough to get in, do whatever it is you came to do, and
still be able to pitch in gas money or cab/bus fare should you ride flake
out, and maybe some breakfast).  Bring money even if you're guest 
listed... sometimes people list too many guests, or things get screwy.
Ask anyone who works door shifts how bad it sucks when somebody claims to
be on a guest list, isn't, and then starts whining about how they can't
pay, and they need to get in because they popped their E half an hour ago
and it's kicking in and they're meeting their friends and it's cold
out and it's all your fault or something. 

[ ]	Water, but most parties nowadays it's either free, or they won't
let you in with it anyway.

[ ]	Keys.  It breaks my heart to see someone bring everything under
the sun and forget their keys or something else important.  Use your
brain... you'll be glad you did.

[ ]	Drugs (optional, but if you're going to do them, please try not to  
buy them at parties... it's bad for drugs, its bad for buyers, it's bad
for honest dealers who have to compete with people selling bunk who you'll
never see again, it's bad for parties in general and it takes the focus
away from the event for those who choose to have nothing to do with
illicit substances).

[ ]	ID, Insurance card, driver's license... it's a bummer when things
happen with the cops or with medical emergencies, but better to be
prepared and have nothing happen than vice versa.

[ ]	Smile, unless it's fake.  Then either bring your damn frown,
or stay home and relax... watch some discovery channel or something.

[ ]	An open mind.  Crusty ravers, candy ravers, DJs, promoters,
wannabes, scum, gangstas, freaks, clubbers, junglists, househeads, and
hardcore junkies can all dance together and have fun.  Your judgements and
prejudices suck as bad as anyone elses.

[ ]	Your street smarts.  There's a lot of things you can do to keep
renegades from getting busted, including: not hanging out all dressed up
in front of venues, not honking or screaming out of cars as you pull up or
leave, not blasting techno/house/jungle out of your car as you drive
around looking for a parking spot, being cool to locals, not talking
about the party or location at the corner store, etc.

[ ]	Friends (optional).  Party with people who are going to be
supportive should you choose to use psychedelics and aren't too familiar
with them.  This is different from somebody who will take off when they
'can't cope' with your 'heavy bullshit'...

[ ]	Powerbar.  In a world where you can't always get three square
meals, settle on a little flat one.  Apple cinnamon highly recommended.
Candy should be avoided as an energy source, as it's not very long lasting
and I get whopping headaches and moodiness after excessive refined sugar.
Your results may very... but I think it's a healthier alternative.  Clif's
bars, other high carbo, high nutrient stuff is equally recommended...

[ ]	Nice manners.  It's nice to hear please, thanks, etc.  Just
recently someone literally took my water out of my hand took a big swig,
and handed it back with their slobber all over the top.  I wouldn't even
mind the slobber had they asked... just treat people with some respect.

[ ]	Dry shirt.  I guess this depends on how much you sweat when you
dance, but for some of us, it's a good idea, especially if you're bumming
a ride home.

[ ]	In colder months, plan on being at least a little colder than
usual.  Dancing, drug use, staying up late, etc all reduce your immunity
to effects of cold.  Bring a jacket, even if you might not get a chance to
use it.

[ ]	A designated driver if you might not be able to drive home okay.
Yeah, sure, dad will be pissed if you get home late, or if Billy drove
your car, but better than a phone call from the CHP asking for an ID on a
body.  That seems harsh, but it's for real... Try and avoid driving if
you're too sleep deprived to stay awake as well.  Hint: Caffeine is found
in the bloodstream of MOST drivers who fall asleep at the wheel where
alcohol isn't involved, so don't think coffee or NoDoz will fix
everything.  Get some sleep.  Also, E's after effects include a tendency
to just nod off with little warning (you know, that thing where you're
talking to somebody and their eyes just start to roll back and close...).
Please be careful.  Cars are big, metal, and propell you through the world
faster than anybody ever intended the human body to go.

STUFF TO LEAVE AT HOME:

[ ]	Six foot high Grafix.  It doesn't help the scene to have HUGE
bongs that can't be hidden when cops walk through.  Generally, obvious
signs of drug use, including shirts, hats, with big ganja leaves / E
caps, etc make it difficult for a visiting city official to believe this
is just a dance oriented event.

[ ]	Candy you can't finish.  Nobody likes standing up to realize
somebody's semi digested Jolly Rancher is stuck to their butt.  If you
don't want it anymore, throw it away please, don't just drop it... I won't
even go on my half chewed blow pop rampage now... 4 pairs of pants and
counting.

DJ Add on list:

[ ]	Your records.  Try and get a box or good bag as early as possible,
too. It makes taking care of your records in hot, wet or outdoor
environments a lot easier.

[ ]	Emergency ambient or spoken word record just in case you follow a
DJ who plays totally whack shtuff that you can't beatmatch to, or don't
want to beatmatch to (ever notice how bad vocal tracks sound sped
waay up?).  Keep it at the back of your crate/bag, so you always know
where it is.

[ ]	Headphones.  Many reasons... mostly, do you want to spend an hour
and a half with somebody else's sweat on your ears?

[ ]	Record Cleaner - especially for outdoor parties.  It's a good idea
to at least try to make sure there's nothing on your records
(especially sand!) when you put them back in the sleeve.

i would never recommend usingf psychedellics with people you don't know
very well. head trips can do weird things to you....

my favorites: 'balance' bar, and 'emergen-c' - the stuff is awesome -
filled with not only vitamin c, but all the electrolites thast you lose
when sweating and dancing your ass off! good stuff. and an energy boost to
boot.

my pet peeve: coming home with all kinds of shit stuck to the bottom of my
sneakers. gum, candy, cigarette butts, you name it. and it all gets really
stuck. find a garbage or at least a bottle in a corner to dump your garbage
into.

cheers - e. :)

First off, mescaline is a natural halucinogen found in a lot a cactuses like
peyote and San Pedro cactus. When somebody offers you a microdot that is
either psilocybin (shroomies) or  mescaline, it is usually fake becuase it is
very difficult to fit enuf drug into a microdot to be psychoactive unless it
is HEAVILY concentrated. microdots usually contain lsd, which is such a
powerful hallucinogen (as all of you psychonauts know) that enuf lsd can
easily be fit into that tiny little pill.

There are synthetic versions of mescaline available which is probably what
the original poster is referring to. The synthetics are of course of much
higher potency.

I remember back at Planet Rock that there was a Sacramento DJ named Simon
who just kicked ass with his happy-hardcore set...
Now we all know that there is an SF DJ also named Simon... but he's not
the one I'm looking for.
I haven't heard or seen this sac-town DJ since then...
can anyone tell me when and where he is going to be playing anytime soon?

Thanks!

Hi all!  My roommate and I got tickets some time ago to Big Top and were
planning on getting there on VTA and BART, but with the BART strike, we're
looking for a ride.  We're in south San Jose, but can easily get as far
north as Fremont BART station, or on the other side of the Bay all the way
up into the city (CalTrain station at 4th & Townsend).  Even if you can't
offer a ride, but know how to get from Fremont or downtown SF to Oakland
on public transit, we'd really appreciate any info!  Also...anybody know
details about the busses from SF mentioned on the Space Children phone
mail?  Thanks in advance for any infos!!!

Tim

ps-either email me direct or phone 408-360-0768 or 408-256-9771 and leave
a message

	I bought this double cassette of Thee-o & Omar, (MindWaves 3000) from 
Pure Acid Mixtapes the other day.  I did not know who they were or what they 
spun---I found out $20 later that I did not like it.
	So if anyone would like to pay me $15 or has a mix that is 180 minutes 
long or so-whatever, to trade it for...perhaps some Christofer Lawrence, I would 
be MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRADE OR SELL THEM.
	So email me PLEEEEEAAAAAAAAASSSSE!

	See yall at the party in the park this weekend I hope.

Even tho it's not really rave-related, I thought you some of you less
serious people would get a giggle out of something my friend posted to
off-topik (it's a mailing list for spam addicts so we can refrain from
(mostly) doing it to other lists - mainly New York based but we've got a
few country folk subscribed too - it's the only new york thang with
"family" in it and the cool thing is that most "topoffs" end up at my place
on weekend nights)...

This is an excerpt from the gabber list poetry slam they appear to be
having (*please note that tongue IS IN CHEEK*)

2 Blonde Carpenters
 
        Two blonde builders were working on a house. One blonde was on a 
ladder
nailing. She'd reach into her nail pouch, pull out a nail, look at it,  
and
either toss it over her shoulder or proceed to nail it into the wood. 
The
other blonde couldn't stand it any longer and yelled up, "Why are you
throwing some of the nails away?"
        The first blonde explained, "When I pull it out of my nail pouch, 
if it's
pointed toward me I throw it away. If it's pointed toward the 
house,then I
can use it!"
        The second blonde got real excited and called her all kinds of 
names,
explaining, "Don't throw away those nails that are pointed toward you!
They're for the other side of the house!!"

hi guys. this is my first post since i started "lurking" two weeks ago.
i'm posting into this concern about people being stuck by syringes....
in a somewhat related situation here (in North Carolina), about 13 kids
died and another 40 went to the hospital after an unknown person sold
ecstasy pills laced with cyanide at one of our massives back in May.  i
lost a friend to this tagedy, so it's a bit personal.  has anything like
this ever happened there?

I just recieved this flyer for the huge protest happening this Sunday
9/14:

Non-violent protest to stop the cutting of the ancient redwood groves in
Headwaters forest.  60,000 acres of old growth forest.

This march is happening at the gates of Pacific Lumber's land up here in
beautiful Humboldt County.  On hand to get our groove on will be
resident Dj INTUITION (Humboldt Full Moon Family) along with DOC MARTIN,
THOMAS, MARKIE, GARTH, JENO, and SAM (loop Guru).

			(510) 468-1660

Car-pooling as well as a charter bus will be available coming from the
bay area.  There is a spot for camping  very close to the protest site
and I believe its free.  E-mail me for info on other campsites.  Last
year thousands of people showed up to protest and we made national media
attention.  This year will be no different when we get together to make
ourselves heard.

This is talk that the Beastie Boys and Pearl Jam (if your interested)
might show up as well.  Anyone heard any on this?

If you have any questions about this event or other parties in the
Humboldt area send me some e-mail.  :)

If this was a flame.. I don't see your point.

I am practically scratching my head wondering what it was you said
actually. I don't feel threatened in anyway. I don't feel lectured. I don't
feel offended in any way neithers... But I know whats up in the Bay Area as
far as MY standing point goes. And you....You listened to 102.5 before
April of this year.


Right?
You know?

I don't stink I am going to BigTop myself though. I have better plans

yesssssssssssssssss
the raverlist of my dreams!
it's actually comforting to know i'm not the only one who eats powerbars
willingly and faithfully.
just make sure, if you pick one of these up -- drink PLENTY of water!
they're yum, and pack full of energy and good-for-you-stuff, but can
dehydrate you if you're not careful :)
thanks andy, good job!

As far as I know, Greg Scavino(AKA Y.A.P.) was signed to DGC records about
two or three years ago. They just released a single of his a few months ago
so I have to assume that an album is on the way shortly.

His previous work on Zoemagic is no longer in print; the label is now
defunct.

good stories, and i may be sympathetic...but they won't get you in the
door if im workin it.  i only let one person in for free, and i won't
say because youall will try to use it on me.  

i just believe in fairness.  that's all.  for those of you that try to
get in free all the time without even contributing (i know there are a
few out there) just remember the investment promoters make in time and
money so you can have a place to go.  

bye!  ;]

Yep, if you see two Droogs dancing their asses off tonight then you need
to come up to them and give them fat hugs and candy. :)
Tonight Derek and I are dressing up in Droog gear and venturing to BIG TOP
for a night of fun under the laser beams... :) If you're not familiar with
what a "Droog" is then you need to read or watch A Clockwork Orange. :) 
"There was me, that is Byroni, and my fellow droog, that is Derek, Derek
being really derek, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our
rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip dark chill winter bastard
though dry. The Korova Milkbar was a milk-plus mesto, and you may, O my
brothers, have forgotten what these mestos were like, things changing so
skorry these days and everybody very quick to forget, newspapers not being
read much neither. Well, what they sold there was milk plus something
else. They had no licence for selling liquor, but there was no law yet
against prodding some of the new veshches which they used to put into the
old moloko, so you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom
or one or two other veshches which would give you a nice quiet horrorshow
fifteen minutes admiring Bog And All His Holy Angels and Saints in your
left shoe with lights bursting all over your mozg. Or you could peet milk
with knives in it, as we used to say, and this would sharpen you up and
make you ready for a bit of dirty twenty-to-one, and that was what we were
peeting this evening I'm starting off the story with."

See you guys there. :) It's going to be so much fun!

Byroni... .. .

 The opening credits of The Simpsons shows Bart Simpson
writing the same sentence over and over again on a chalkboard, reminiscent
of the whole "write it 100 times" punishment, which establishes him as a 
troublemaker. Each episode is usually different. Someone apparently went 
through the trouble of taping all the Simpsons, watching them all and 
writing down what Bart is writing on the board. These are the collected 
writings of the Simpsons from the chalkboard exercises that Bart  writes 
during the opening credits.  Even if you're not a fan, I think you'll find 
at least  few of these worth cracking up over:

i don't know about YAP's "album", but you can still pick up trax from
his earlier releases on various CD compilations, e.g. Twitch,
Razormaid, etc. YAP's "Nature", for example, is on Twitch #4. Those
comps may be out of print too, but I see them in used CD shops all the
time.

PS: My Favorite "score" from the dustbins of old is Eddie Flashin' Fowlkes
& 3MB -- The Birth of Technosoul... couple of good trax on here, IMHO.

PPS: trivia question -- what movie do the samples in "Nature" come from?

Hey, 

is it true that the Funky Techno thing(Electric Highway) only goes until 
2:00 a.m.? I hope it's just a really bad rumor but I've heard it from a few 
people and they were all reliable sources.

Having wandered into jungle through hip-hop and Carribbean music, I have a
huge hole in my musical knowledge where "electronica" is concerned.

I mean I've heard the 808 State remix of UB40's "One in Ten," but most of
the headliners on this tour are people I may have heard in passing or read
about, but basically just have no idea WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THEMSELVES
THESE DAYS.

Does anyone want to take time-out to send me (not the list, I wouldn'tt
torture you guys with my ignorance and its spin-offs/replies) a couple of
blurbs about the various performers who are not the RIIIIIIIIIIIIIDER?


PAX,
DUH,
MAX

When Scott was highlighting the all the lives acts for me just now, while
idiling in his car, on his way home from the infamous SpaceChildren's
warehouse, after sweating for days putting together all the equipment,
decorations, and keeping up with contacts, I shuddered with the most intense
anxiety.........How could I be so lucky to experience all this incredible
talent all in one night and just 10 minutes from my house ?  It is amazing,
but true......and you can have it all too!!!!   See you on the dancefloor!

I guess ignorance is bliss. I never realized there were so many 
predjudices in this 'scene'. It seems like everyone is so worried about 
identifying themselves w/ a certain genre of music that it's not even 
about the music anymore. What am I? I LOVE Jungle, DnB, Hardcore, House, 
Gabber, Breakbeat, Trance, Experimental.... ALL of it! I never even knew 
Gabber/Hardcore was such a violent manifestation! (I wish I had remained 
ignorant.)
  My whole idea with this fOaM party was to get everyone together and 
feature all styles of music... so everyone would feel comfortable and 
maybe even find a new musical interest. I don't know if that's such a 
good idea anymore. Please tell me that people can put aside they're 
pre-concieved notions and just listen with an open mind.
What are you?

I'm selling a 909 - in nice condition - has all of the knobs & of ourse,
works & sounds analogue fat, literally.

hope no-one minds me posting - I want to try & find it a good home in the
west if i can.

selling it because I managed to get my hands on a 2nd one in Canada last
week & I would rather see it benefiting someone down here so I bought it &
brought it back.


:-)

deep thought of the moment:

--> being nice is sometimes a challenge but always a gift

In a message dated 97-09-12 00:34:07 EDT, you write:

<< I heard electric ends @ 3 am =\~ Does anyone know if there will be an
SFraves
 meeting spot? I wanna meet all u wunderful people!!!! >>

     how about 11:30 by the water booth.  Since this event (I can't bring
myself to call it a rave... it's more of a concert) ends early, we should
have an early meeting spot.  I'll have blackpants with white piping, my
bikelights, dino backpack orange tanktop and lots-o-laminates.  Hope to see
you there! (especially since the vibe will need a little boosting from the
SFR crew)

Happy birthday to one of our most eclectic freakazoids, Virgo-tigo (aka
Memo, aka Guillermo, aka Senor Lemus, aka DJ Vertigo, aka Daddy oh
wait...).

Have a great day you big lug you... glad to have you with us.

Feliz Cumpleanos (sorry about the no little ~ over the n, which kind of
makes it look like I'm saying "Happy Completed Anus" instead of "Happy
Completed Year"... but I can't figure out how to get Pine to do it
inside a windows term session... hee hee hee... well, you know what I
meant).

Man, this is a good day... my office mate just hit the motherload of *.wav
files... it's probably old, but it's Barney the Purple Dinosaur getting
done in by Beavis with Butthead egging him on, all done with legit clips
(i.e. no 'fake' voices). Of course, they used Sam Kinnison clips for
Barney's screams of agony while being shot.  It's beautiful.  So I have
the sense of humor of a troubled 12 year old.... big deal.  I'm afraid
you'll have to cope.

Peace,
AndyW

Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday you freaky ass DJ that plays trance, techno, house and 
breakbeat together as smoothly as chocolate and peanut butter blend in a
Reese's peanut butter cuuuuuuuuuuuuuup,
Happy Birthday to you.

and many more...

:)

So, anyone want to take bets on how many acts don't show up or perform? It
seems anytime there is a SUPER-RAVE-FEST, half the acts don't even know
they were supposed to be there. It really sounds like some great folks are
playing... Someone please let me be wrong.. :-)

I think he goes by "Simon Apex" or something like that. If I remember
correctly, he runs around w/ a british accent as well. 
Anyway, that's all I know. If you go to one of the Kick Drum parties and ask
around to the other DJs they will know where he is or what he is doing.

hope that helps,

I believe that San Francisco is the last show of the tour.

Well, in their infinite wisdom, we see that the promoters have put 
Grooverider on for an hour in between Banco de Gaia & Loop 
Guru........does this suggest to anyone else that these people may be 
slightly on the clueless side?

It looks like the whole line-up of live acts with half-hour DJ slots in 
between is more of a rock concert than a rave!

Quantity over quality anyone? (But then how many acts will turn up?!)

In this case it's a packaged tour, so it's likely most of the performers
will be there. Pretty poor scheduling, however, with far too many acts.

Oh, for whomever was asking, I've had confirmation from his label that
Grooverider will be there.

i never knew either. but you know, i heard a few years back that jungle was
associated with all sorts of gang related shit. what ever. i guess you'll
find disturbed ppl who like all kinds of music, but that isn't to say that
because they like it i can't. you know? i agree, there are deviations
within this community, as there are in every one. diversity is what helps
create a lively community. we ought to embrace the diversity, realize that
there aren't a lot of us out there, and that our love of techno *in
general* is what unites us. what is it that they say... together we
stand.... it's ridiculous, childish even, to label a person by the type of
music they prefer. ask yourself, if you don't agree with them, why they
like it? perhaps you will _learn_ something. i dunno... this is all so
trivial in the larger scheme of things. eeeeewwww! you like tootsie pops
rather than blow pops? i can't possibly like you! gawd.

who the hell knows. but if you find out, let me know, will ya? i would hope
that ppl could *enjoy* each difference - not put them aside, not fight
about them. embrace the diversity.

We're honestly excited about the fact that you've found a way to advertise
for free, but this is FLAGRANT COMMERCIAL SPAM.  I realize it's rave
related, but I'm pretty confident we're not interested in world domination
at this point in time.  It would be nice in fact, if we could just start
with some common courtesies like not abusing e-mail or public mailing
lists (especially topic specific regional lists).

Please avoid crossposting.  If you'd like to let us know about it, roll
down the hype, and tell us like we'd tell each other about an event.  We
have no qualms with an occasional post regarding a semilocal event
(seattle, oregon, mtn or la regions) assuming it's EPIC... or even a
global scale event in London, New York, Chicago if say... everybody and
their mother is there, but this seems  a bit excessive. In addition, a lot
of the lists you sent to (313, IDM, calendar) have almost nothing to do
with this event that I can see, and to be honest, this looks opportunist
at best.

Honestly, you'll get better mileage with a handful of flyers.  Nothing
personal, just this is starting to become a problem with mailing lists in 
general.

Thanks,
AndyW

p.s.	Personally, I feel there's enough Global Chaos and Mass Hysteria
in this world already.  How about a little unity... we can build things if
we try, if we respect one another and realize common goals.  Sorry if I
seem offensive, I'd prefer you think of it as defensive of our lists goals
and methods, as well as the time invested by everybody on it.

HAHAH I jsut called the line.

That is the right number but the wrong voice for the voice mail.  I think that
there is prolly a mix up with her service.  Or maybe she just forgot to pay her

This web site was very bad. Very creative though...definite kudos to the 
designer...the KKK connection was funny.
I have to ask though that email conversation between Bert and dahmer 
wasn't to bad, but that "Butchering.txt" attached file...lets just say
it was about 100,000 times more in depth than i would have ever 
imagined. It sounds like the webmaster had some first hand experience in
human butchery and consumption. 
Bert always did scare me when I was little

Are you kidding me????
This is a  joke.....You know what I do when a post comes across on the NY
lists that says info about large events in other states? We pack out a
bus and head up to those events...I dont write back to the man throwing
the party....."please dont inform us of a large event in your state....I
dont live there and I wouldn't take the trip" which is basically what you
told  me... My friends and I fly out to LA and take trips all over the
place just to check out the other scenes...We're even throwin a party in
Arizona in oct...Called "A New Begining".....

Another thing....you said   "Honestly, you'll get better mileage with a
handful of flyers.  Nothing personal, just this is starting to become a
problem"

Well...I hope  this so called problem...which I call promoting a
party.....didn't destroy the PLUR on your mailing list...and I say YOUR
mailing list because you did decide  to speak for all the people on your
list...

actually, just always bring a little tin or plastic baggy (indoors or out)
for your butts or other tiny pieces of garbage you may have. respect the
people who have to clean up, and make the least mess possible. 

Another thing to leave at home:

[ ] Permanent markers. Don't tag, it's complete bullshit. Respect the

Yeah, nothing like being at work and clicking on that 'butchering' tag. 
 Thank God no one was around me when the title "How to butcher a human 
carcass for consumption" popped up on my screen!
My favorite:  Bert at Woodstock - reminded me of the "where's waldo" books.

This web site was very bad. Very creative though...definite kudos to the
designer...the KKK connection was funny.
I have to ask though that email conversation between Bert and dahmer
wasn't to bad, but that "Butchering.txt" attached file...lets just say
it was about 100,000 times more in depth than i would have ever
imagined. It sounds like the webmaster had some first hand experience in
human butchery and consumption.
Bert always did scare me when I was little

Before you jump so quickly to respond to spam, make sure for yourself that
the message you're responding to actually made it to SFraves.  In this
case, this spam message was filtered by my spam filters; but from the looks
of it Andy got it through another mailing list, and since it had
"sfraves@hyperreal.org" in the To: field, his response made it to the list
even though the original didn't.  Before you respond to a multi-list spam,
make sure you GOT IT through the sfraves list before responding TO the
sfraves list.  The easiest way to tell is to look for a header which says
"Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org" in the mail headers.  This happened
earlier this week.  Thanks.

	Brian

This is a  joke.....You know what I do when a post comes across on the 
NY
lists that says info about large events in other states? We pack out a
bus and head up to those events...I dont write back to the man throwing
the party....."please dont inform us of a large event in your state....I
dont live there and I wouldn't take the trip" which is basically what 
you
told  me... My friends and I fly out to LA and take trips all over the
place just to check out the other scenes...We're even throwin a party in
Arizona in oct...Called "A New Begining".....

Another thing....you said   "Honestly, you'll get better mileage with a
handful of flyers.  Nothing personal, just this is starting to become a

Well...I hope  this so called problem...which I call promoting a

  Here it is... I'm thinking 11 p.m. by the water booth.  If you want to hook
up with SFR people before that we can check in at the water booth every hour
on the hour.  I hope to see some of you there so we can run around spreading
that raver cheer for all the peeps that came out cuz they won free tickets on
the radio and have never really been to a rave.  (Gee.. I sort of qualify..
LIve 105, keepin my weekend alive)  Hm.. what kind of sell out am I?? Hey!
 It's a free party,  I"m not complaining.

I hate to make little hand-raising posts, but I have to get Joe Desantis
back on this one...

Someone is out of there mind if they get irked by a post *inviting* us to
a party, and don't get irked by little insignificant crap posts about
mothing at all, made simply for the fact that one gets to see his or her
name in the header-lights.

Irked by posts like this one.

DUH,
MAX

 Your sense of humor is lame and unappreciated. Propagating extreme 
violence (even if "tongue in cheek") is stupid and very 14 ish (age wise 
here).

Hi SFRavers -

 I know there was a little discussion about some SFRavers going to the
Santana concert. I'll be going Sunday at Shoreline - is anyone else going 
to the same show ?

Hello Party Peeps,

Sorry about the post about Electric Highway. I have been a couple of days 
behind the list and finally got caught up and found out that my question 
had already been answered. Anyway does anybody know of any good UG parties 
this weekend that are in the City or the Oak? I don't think I can handle 
all the Hype of the other parties.

Scott

I read what you said and I was finally surprised that there was someone
out there who wasn't pissed off at the fact that someone in another state
would like to invite and unite people from all over the world to come to
our gathering of P.L.U.R.......
I have never checked out the western lists before....today was my first
day...and I realize now whats up with your lists...everyones mad because
of alot of posts....Well within the past few hours I've seen more
senseless posts then I could collect on the NYC list in a month. People
just keep writing back and posting .."Another Spam!"


Spam..Spam...Spam....

People on this list waste time complaining about absolutly nothing...If
they don't wanna come to the party then just delete it...They say I'm
wasting their space....They waste it complaining about me...
Atleast I contribute to the list with party info....

Just one more contribution to wasting peoples time

peace

Hi all!   ]=}


 You know, I used to enjoy going to HUGE massives/commercial events for 
the crowds, the production levels (big lasers are *really* neat!), and 
for the incredible music that is *occasionally* played there.

 But something has happened and I've changed. I've been introduced to the 
UG scene over the years and have a deep respect for the UG (despite the 
petty political and egotistical bullshit that goes on).

 To me the epitimy of "non-commercial" events is Burning Man. There I got 
to experience a multi-artist collabrative of about 10,000 peeps without 
*one* sign for Coors or a Lotus Magazine laying about (sorry Lotus, you do 
have a nice rag) or any other advertisment that is designed to make you 
feel like shit until you buy their product.

 What has soured me (finally) to Massives is the work of two production 
companies (and/or their crew/associates). We had a sound stage at BM (the 
largest [I believe] except for main stage (which only played "dance 
music" on Sunday nite). Some scum bags decided to leave huge glossy 
flyers to two events there on our tables. This is not only an insult to 
us (no one asked if they could leave their trash on our tables) but is an 
insult to *every* participant at Burning Man. NO ONE is there to be 
exposed to commercial advertisments. That is one reason why we go.

 The offending flyers were for Space Children's "Be Here Now" event on 
November 30th. and Organic's show Sept 20th. I highly advise all those 
who truely care about non-commercial art and freedom of expression to 
boycott these shows as a protest to their disrespectful attitude towards 
Burning Man (and our camp incidently).

 I intend to foward this info to other lists and to foward it to the 
Burning Man organisers in hopes of creating a huge protest. I will 
willingly stop these efforts if a public apology is given to the Burning 
Man organisers from the two production companies

hugz y'all,



Ran D. Dreams

Hi Brian ( and SFRaves ) -

 Well, I got the WORLD DOMINATION spam, despite the filters. "sfraves" 
appears more than once in the "To:" string -

sfraves@hyperreal.org
sfraves-calendar-owner@hyperreal.org
sfraves-calendar@hyperreal.org
sfraves-digest@hyperreal.org

 And here's the "Sender:" line -
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org


 Back to filter design ...

Hi folks!  ]=}

 With a little bit of self reflection I've realised that I've been 
involved in a share of spamming with regards to events I've been very 
involved in (finacially and otherwise).

 With that in mind I should offer my apologies to those who have had to 
deal with those spams. I am sorry. most of the time they have been for UG 
events where we were just concerned with breaking even. Case in point 
would be the 4X4 campout. We *way* spammed SFraves and I also apologise 
for my part in that (we still lost over 6 thousand dollars on that).

 I do want to inform peeps about shows I (Dionysus Dreams) am working on 
as I know some peeps want to know and I can't email everyone personally. 
However I will try to keep it to an absolute mininum with as little use 
of buzz words as possible (kewl! ;).

hugz,



Ran D. Dreams

oh, hey now, we aren't *all* like that! some of us are displaced east
coasters who sought the sunshine and laid back attitude of sf.... and a lot
of us are just plain *nice*! please don't make such generalizations about
sf.... yes, there's a lot of crap, but there is that everywhere. as someone
who's lived on the east coast (24 years) the so-called 3rd coast (tx - 6
years) and now the west (only 4 months), i must say that this is a fabulous
city. i love it! maybe you'll have to come out here to see for yourself?
warning - the ug parties bring more 'plurrier' (is that a word?) ppl. or so
i've seen thus far (read: _opinion_ folks!). but it takes all kinds, which
brings me back to my earlier post about diversity. embrace it! if you
don't, you're the one who's losing out. (never mind that it's the most
immature thing i could think of doing, but what ever.) i'm tired too of all
the bitterness. lighten up, ppl.

cheers - e. :)

 Eric you are the epitamy of ego-bound DJs! Shut the fuck up or else I'll 
have to go into (publicly) your fiasco at Greyhound rock where you directly 
caused the theft of audio equipment.

Why are you attacking everyone? What do hope to accomplish by trashing 
people on SFR?

You do not rerally deserve a respons eto this type of language and 
behavior...but out of sympathy for you, I will.

Two of my friends, who will remain nameless, threw the party that you 
speak. They were resonsible for the sound system. They rented it from a 
person named MIKE G. They allowed some other party promoters to use the 
sound system a second night, uinder the pretense that they would return 
it the next day. I had absolutley nothing to do with this. Sorry that you 
want to attach this to me. Additionall, the person who's system was 
stolen received all new gear, and harbors no grudges about the situation. 
Why do you.

In respnse to me being an ego-bound DJ...you don't even know me. How can 
you even comment on anything? Anything that you feel that you know about 
me is at least 2nd or 3rd hand info.

All of your negative energy only helpd to perpetuate the bullshit that so 
many "REAL" paople work hard to get away from every day of their lives. 
Their is enough rumor and inuendo floating through this scene to fuel 
fires for years....and you seem to be adding as much fuel to the fire as 
humanly possible.

Sorry your filled with so much hate, anger, and distateful comments.

peace,
ES

Somehow, by asking to not have personal attacks posted to SFR I became 
involved in this bizarre, lame confrontation. Since my post, that didn't 
attack anyone, Ran D. Dreams, has mailed me twice swearing and 
threatening me on various different levels.

Why have I been drawn into this?

Check your head people.

Peace,
ES

I might have made the mistake of speaking my mind and feeling the list
agreed, but at least I don't tell them what to do.

How about a please along with your request?

To reiterate today's events:

I replied to a cross listed spam, to only it's sender and the list of
which I am part, rather than the trans global cross posting list it
originally contained.  I did this ON PURPOSE to keep my opinion from
affecting the outcome of your event.  If your intentions are good and you
have planned carefully, I wish you all the success in the world, however
you might measure it.

I basically stated that this is SF-Raves, as in San Francisco Raves, as in
a regional list for San Francisco.

Why is there an SFRaves?  Because a US-Raves list would be hard to manage
or enjoy.  Raves are fairly regional events, as you have to attend them to
really get the whole experience.

Plus, it adds to a certain convenience.  If I'm going to Texas, I hop on
their raves list for a couple weeks before I go, and I have a pretty good
idea of what to expect.  Same for NYC, same for MW, same pretty much
everywhere.

You quote PLUR, as if it were some unifying banner to make the meanines go
away.  I've seen it used here by all kinds, from shit talking little
gossipheads spun out on crank and looking for some guy to hit on so
they'll buy them an E to amazingly connected and enlightened people to
everybody in between. Like LOVE, it means different things to different
people.  To me it means it's something I won't cheapen by quoting.  I try
to be respect of people, of this list, of the internet and servers and
admins that support it, and the conditions governing it.

When you subbed to this list, you read a welcome, that included a brief
mission statement if you will about this list.  "Information pertaining to
raves, in and around the San Franscisco Bay area".  If every party in the
country was promoted on this list, it would create a problem.

I found your post disrespectful, because there are literally hundreds of
events going on every month in this country.  If everyone crossposted all
of the lists you just crossposted there would be a major problem.

The policy exists to make these lists viable.  Considering yourself above
these policies indicates either:

a.	A lack of understanding of basic netiquette

b.	A feeling that you or your event or somehow above that policy.

Either way, you took it upon yourself to take your needs above the needs
of others far away across the country.

The list welcome statement also recommends that you lurk for a while
before you post, just to get a feel for the list, which you chose to
disregard as well.

I respect the rules, because they work.  I defend them, because I have
seen what happens when people don't follow them.

Most of you have a good point, in fact, at some level I should hope all of
us do.  I'm ready to back down, but  I can't help but find it ironic
that a promoter from NYC trying to get free publicity could win the hearts
of this list by putting PLUR at the bottom of a mail and taking a cheap
shot or two at me for reminding you some of some of our guidelines.


Is it really about these POWER terms, like "domination"?  Do I just not
get it?  We are more family than enemy, yet we seem so attracted to being
in charge, on top, at the controls of the MASSIF, head of the Juggernaut,
of the big machine.  The goal should not be the end result, the goal
should be coming together for the sake of coming together, as we do...
often.

So, I don't know what I seem to you, but I know how you seem to me.  You
post in violation of policies that you agreed to when sub'ing to this
list, and now you fire off a couple shots and then say don't cc: the list,
send it to me direct.  You chose to tell me something, and I should be
entitled to say my piece.  When you retort, I should be entitled to
retort as well.

Sorry if I didn't respect your wishes, but I feel it best to justify my
actions before the people I see every weekend.  You don't have to live
with them, although I'm sure you'd find them as wonderful and
fascinating as I do.  I hope your party goes well, but I won't be there.

Peace,
AndyW

Disclaimer:	I am not the owner of this list, nor am I it's longest
standing member, nor am I hot shit of any variety.  I choose to speak my
mind in this case because this discussion is somewhat rave related and
very respect related.

People, wake up.  We all need to limit our sense of importance in light of
respect for the sense of importance of others.  That goes for everyone,
including me.  So I'll shut up for a little while, because what I've seen
today has been pretty amazing.  Good night. Reply to whoever you like,
I'll still be on, I'm just not really compelled to speak for a while.

Sorry about the derision, about the infighting, and sorry if I offended
anyone.  I can't tell you all to stop, but I feel like kaka knowing I
helped start it.

Okay, time to stick my neck out here...

I have been lurking for the most part here for a couple of months, and I have
to admit I'm very heartened by what I've seen, the people I've gotten to know
here, the general feeling of fellowship, of community.  It's wonderful, and I
wouldn't trade it for the world.

However, it seems that lately some people on the list have forgotten some of
the basic problems of close-knit societies.  You see, we have our rules, our
conventions, our guidelines and creeds, but they aren't documented anywhere -
Think about NRR and BSP, for example.  They seem obvious, now, but to new
people, they're jsut more TLAs.  Normally, newbies are quiet, and listen a
little before they dive in, and when one makes a mistake, they are normally
reminded of the rule they broke, and life moves on.

The problem comes from a clash of cultures.  Someone who's obviously part of a
more "energetic" scene (not to say ours is moribund by any measure - just that
there's a different way of using and spreading energy) comes to offer us an
invitation.  Yes, it was in a style we have come to regard as suspect of the
commercial types.  Yes, it didn't come with the (BSP) disclaimer.  Yes, it was
an advertisement for a party 4000 miles away.

But it was ONE MESSAGE.  Look at it for what it was - an invitation, an example
of interregional Unity.  Remember, the U in PLUR?  Regardless of your opinion
on the marketing tactics, how boorish or juvenile you may have felt it,
consider it for what it is.

Those who spoke up with loud voices immediately appointed themselves as
spokespeople for the entire Bay Area scene... And as diplomats they seemed to
be very undiplomatic indeed.  Flame, flame, flame...And there's no Respect in
flames, only hard feelings.

If someone makes a mistake, they tend to be a lot more reasonable about being
corrected if you don't do it at the top of your lungs, insulting them all the
way.  if the person won't accept it for what it is, then ignore them.  Walk
away - don't get into needless fights, and save your energy for the things that
matter.

Now that my neck is out, let's see who's got the axe...

-Corey

Ok, yes this is Jeremy again. Yes a party will happen Sept. 20th, this
is a promise. I've worked too hard, and you've heard me BSP too many
times for me not to let this party go off. So unfortunately, my three
room indoor party will not happen. THere is still a possibility of a
one room indoor on the Monterey Peninsula. If this does not go off, we
have two seperate  locations we could use for outdoor parties. if this
does occur, I'll make sure this one goes off like no outdoor you've
ever been too. THis means my line-up has drastically changed. But
there's no way, i'll let you guys down with that line-up. it will be a
combination in some way of our jungle line-up and our main room
line-up. If any of you know me, you know how badly i feel about this.
This is my first party, and I've learned many lessons. And from what
I've learned, I'll make sure you have will have Always Something to
Remember when it comes to *Play Nice.*

you may have been asking why I'm so set on having this party in the
Monterey area.It's because us (the monterey kids) have traveled 2
hours to the city for parties over 30 times. and yes that means
driving home in the morning another 2 hours. This is my chance to give
something back to my area, if this is the only time i throw a party in
the Monterey Bay, it will be one of the best ever. I can tell you
this, but shhhh promise not to tell anyone, K? ASR PRODUCTIONS will
bring you *THE AWAKENING* MARCH 8th 1998. THIS PARTY WILL BE IN THE
BAY AREA, AND WILL BE MY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. 

THANK YOU for reading my confessional. I hope all of you come out and
support my dream to make *Play Nice,* GO OFF.

love~jeremy

When you subscribed, the welcome message you got back said:

  * Normal etiquette is to wait around 2 weeks or more before you start
  posting anything; that ensures that you don't tread on old ground and
  that you have a reasonably good idea of the mindset of the list.

In general, any message which includes more than one mailing list in the
To: header I'd consider spam - yours was addressed to 13 different lists,
which it looks like you got by simply looking for email addresses on the
hyperreal.org web site.  It looks like you subscribed to each list to make
sure your message got through, too.  Finally, the description of the party
itself wasn't anything special - it looks like a typical party.  What if we
posted the sfraves calendar each week to nyc-raves?  That would suck.  

If you want to reach the "general" population of online ravers, post to
alt.raves.  Don't think of "sfraves" as "online ravers who live in sf", but
instead as "online ravers who are interested in information related to the
sf scene".  BIG distinction.

I read what you said and I was finally surprised that there was someone
out there who wasn't pissed off at the fact that someone in another 
state
would like to invite and unite people from all over the world to come to
our gathering of P.L.U.R.......
I have never checked out the western lists before....today was my first
day...and I realize now whats up with your lists...everyones mad because
of alot of posts....Well within the past few hours I've seen more
senseless posts then I could collect on the NYC list in a month. People
just keep writing back and posting .."Another Spam!"


Spam..Spam...Spam....

People on this list waste time complaining about absolutly nothing...If
they don't wanna come to the party then just delete it...They say I'm
wasting their space....They waste it complaining about me...
Atleast I contribute to the list with party info....

Just one more contribution to wasting peoples time

home due to the f*cked up traffic on hwy 17,,,,so to answer your 
question, yes I am going to be going with my cool pops and I'm sure 
we'll all see eachother somewhere.  Veritgo? Julie Mae? I think they are 
going. Not sure though.  If we don't see anyone, well we can be superior 
to everyone else  ha ha ha ;P

me too, actually, cuz i'm from new york - while i'm too busy spamming your
list with retarded replies instead of "bsps" (i don't throw parties, i just
enjoy them) it's only cuz i think the nyc scene sucks...  i joined your
list so we could like, ya know, spread the love across the continent - much
cheaper than me flyin' out there all the time (hey, credit ain't THAT good
- it's nice, but not fabulous) to show ya how we do it...  At any rate,
there ARE people who fly around and go to parties...

that's not the only reason - some people sign onto lists because they plan
on VISITING - me, I don't have too many friends out west but i'd like to
make some before i hit the coastline...  that's another reason - and as for
me, i seem to have made lotsa friends i'll be able to party with when i get
there...  that's a cool enough reason for me...  all this PLUR crap is
starting to get to this hardass new york girl tho, when people just DON'T
seem to have a sense of humor about things anymore...  

that's another reason the ny lists aren't as fun - seems like people just
don't have a sense of humor or much REAL spirituality at all...  and the
thing is, I felt like a little dose of happiness here and god, i don't know
whether i'm instigating it or not, but sheez, it's getting all too familiar...

but hey, props to you list members who i've made a lil friendship with, cuz
the majority of you guys seem really cool and "down" with it...

i'll shut up now, i do believe i've made my five for the day...

well, send your opinion to the idiot that wrote it then - i myself thought
it was kinda funny, personally - cuz this kid OBVIOUSLY doens't know what's
up...

and being so damn mamby-pamby and overly serious about a mail forward that
was SUPPOSED to make you laugh and feel PITY on the stupid gabberhead is
about as lame and unappreciated as it gets...

sorry for the public flame, guys - if it goes any further i guarantee it
will go to email.

Subject: NRR: Disrespect on SFR (long)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

	I just resubbed for a few days and wow! I cannot believe the things
being said on this list. Never have I seen such disgusting and
disrespectful language and actions towards anyone on any mailing list or
for that matter in the real world. It's amazing how hiding behind a
terminal can increase one's testicle or ovary (as the case may be) size.
	I have been on and off this list for a few years now because of the
disrespect that so often occurs here. It's almost impossible to stay on and
read a days mail without feeling hurt, upset, angry, disrespected,
disgusted or as though I want to go on a killing spree. I do not blame any
one person and I do not blame all of the SFRavers. I don't need to point a
finger, because I know that those who engage in this kind of conduct are
aware of who they are. But if you aren't sure, wanna know if you are one of
them? I bet can I can show you without ever knowing you or seeing you post.
Here's a simple test. If you are reading this and are upset by my opinions
and racking your brain out to find the perfect insult and readying your
typing fingers to post a nasty reply, then I have done my job and shown you
who you are. Thank you for doing it for me.
	Not all of SFRavers are like this obviously, it is just that there
are a select few on the list with rather large oral cavities. A few people
out of hundreds that sadly, can make the SF scene look like a rotten place
to be sometimes. Plenty of people have said it, so this is not only my
opinion. Come on, SFR drama has even been a topic on other rave lists for
crying out loud. That is just rediculous.
	Having been in this scene for almost seven years, I have seen many
changes and met many people. I know that the SF scene isn't as bad as it is
sometimes portrayed on this list. I also know that some people who bark a
lot on this list have no bite in reality and that they really have very
little bark, if any, in person as well. Ahhh, the power of the internet, of
hiding under an assumed name or just behind a terminal, away from facing
people in reality. It can be such a good drug can't it? A real ego boost.
	But it's not only the people who cause the trouble on this list
that are to blame. I'm sorry to sound cliche, but those of you who bicker
about it are just as much a part of the problem. People complain about the
disrespect and start flame wars and create new threads telling them what an
a**hole that person is. Great, what has that accomplished? Let's see...
more wasted bandwidth, that person only attacks more (that kind of person
feeds off of your comments whether your right or wrong... they'll find a
way to put you in the wrong) and then what? You have more to complain
about. It's an endless cycle. Constantly I see people say to keep personal
attacks off the list, but then when the one you are attacking says to keep
it personal, what is done? You basically tell him to go screw himself and
that you can do what you want. I think the quote I read was more along the
lines of don't tell us what to do or something. I just don't understand all
the hipocrasy and double standards. It's sick. Practice what you preach
people.
	Having a lack of understanding of basic netiquette was also
mentioned. Well, I think all of you who get involved in this kind of
demeaning activity should check yourselves, I see all of you mention it so
often yet never once see you follow it. Saying the words over and over
doesn't make it happen. There is no need for name-calling, disrespecting,
demeaning, or bringing up past issues that have nothing to do with the
subject at hand, yet you figure it can tarnish one's personality if you do.
That is fully childish. That is the kind of thing I see little tiny kids
doing to one another and even they aren't that brutal and immature about it.
	Please, just learn to respect one another. Learn to keep a personal
attack if you must make it, private. Learn to keep your mouth shut when you
see that same person who always posts starting trouble, so you don't
instigate them any further. It's a cry for attention... it's what they
expect and want, if it wasn't they wouldn't do it. Human nature and common
sense tells us al that.
	Maybe I have instigated a little flame war of my own by coming
forth with this. I'll admit to having slightly poor netiquette by posting
this, but this one post, is nothing compared to the damage that has already
been done. This post does not insult anyone or personally attack anyone. If
you feel it does, I apologise, but it was not truly intended that way and
like I said, if this truly upsets you, especially to the point of publicly
bashing and insulting me, then maybe you are the one with the problem. Not
to mention the fact that I am not one of those who perpetually bickers
about netiquette on this list.
	After only being on again for a few days, I am off this list again,
so sadly I won't get to see all the drama this stirs up on the list as I am
sure there are certain people with plenty to say. So if you want to make
sure I get your personal attack, make sure you email it to me directly, if
you just put it on the list, I'll never see it.
mailto:jenn@cloudfactory.org Just in case, there's my address again. But a
word of warning, if you have a really juicy personal attack for me, you
most likely won't get a response. Just so you won't be disappointed, when
several days pass by without an insult from me. If you really want to
demean me and insult who I am, stop hiding behind your terminal and try
saying it to my face. And that goes for anyone you want to do that to.

Goodbye all.
jenn

Electric Highway Tour ends at 2 AM. Pro-Soy is a daytime thing. Is there 
anything worth going to after Elec. Highway? (Assume I'd prefer not to be

Heh.

At quick glance I thought the message title said "BSP - DEATH"

I was assuming it was another Nomad Interactive event.

False alarm this time, I guess. :-)

hello everybuddy

Our friends throwing the gathering in people's park this Sunday
the 14th, have asked me to make a clarification about the party.
The party is not solely a Moontribe event.  While there are many people
from Moontribe coming up to help out and play and chill with us, there
are many other people from the bay area that are putting their energy
into
this event as well.
thanks a lot and we hope to see you there.

peace
jen

		<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The U.S. Congress, bowing to law enforcement=
 demands for more wiretap powers, is preparing to approve a scheme that=
 endangers the personal freedom of every American.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nobody doubts that wiretaps are useful tools for=
 law enforcement agents. FBI Director Louis Freeh, who as a young agent=
 built his career on them, knows this well.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But <A=
 HREF=3D"http://cgi.pathfinder.com/netly/editorial/0,1012,1343,00.html"=
 TARGET=3D"_new">Freeh's plan</A> would expand the FBI's eavesdropping=
 ability by building Big Brother into every word processor, every e-mail=
 program and every web browser. All computer software distributed after 1998=
 would have a special, secret backdoor for government access to your most=
 private files. Even your Internet provider would be deputized as a=
 cyber-snoop. It's the technological equivalent of requiring that every=
 homeowner turn over a spare copy of his front door key to the FBI.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is the same FBI that has a long and=
 disturbing history of abusing Americans' privacy. As director, J. Edgar=
 Hoover built a successful career out of illegal wiretaps, secret files and=
 political blackmail. Hoover despised Martin Luther King, Jr. -- branding=
 him an "obsessive degenerate" -- and once sent him an anonymous letter,=
 using information gathered through illegal surveillance, to encourage the=
 depressed civil rights leader to commit suicide. Hoover's legacy? Having=
 the FBI headquarters bear his name today.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This debate plays out against a backdrop of=
 export controls on data-scrambling software. For years, the National=
 Security Agency has contended that encryption is dangerous in the wrong=
 hands, which is why the Clinton administration considers encryption=
 products to be munitions. For export purposes, government bureaucrats=
 consider Lotus Notes to be like a B-2 Stealth bomber or an M-1 Abrams tank.=
 This view stems from when encryption was largely the province of soldiers=
 and spies -- and amply demonstrates the <A=
 HREF=3D"http://cgi.pathfinder.com/netly/opinion/0,1042,1344,00.html"=
 TARGET=3D"_new">techno-illiteracy</A> of President Clinton and Vice=
 President Gore.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bills have been introduced in both the House and=
 the Senate to loosen these export restrictions, which businesses say cost=
 U.S. industry millions of dollars a year. A study to be released next month=
 by the <A HREF=3D"http://www.epic.org/" TARGET=3D"_new">Electronic Privacy=
 Information Center</A> shows that many overseas firms aren't hindered by=
 such Cold War rules and are free to sell strong encryption software around=
 the globe. Three lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of the=
 government's regulations on First Amendment grounds and have met with some=
 success.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Of course the Eavesdrop Establishment opposes=
 such changes. After all, limiting freedom through hardwiring Big Brother=
 into communications systems has been long-standing White House policy for=
 at least six years. Only now, however, are the bureaucrats admitting it. A=
 new book by <A HREF=3D"http://www.counterpane.com/" TARGET=3D"_new">Bruce=
 Schneier</A> and <A HREF=3D"http://www.epic.org/epic/staff/banisar/"=
 TARGET=3D"_new">Dave Banisar</A> called "The Electronic Privacy Papers" (<A=
 HREF=3D"http://www.wiley.com/" TARGET=3D"_new">John Wiley & Sons</A>, 1997)=
 reveals that the push for demanding computer and telephone snoopability is=
 both long-standing and bipartisan: in 1991, George Bush ordered advisor=
 Brent Scowcroft to press for such controls.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The plan stalled during the 1992 election, but=
 two years later Clinton endorsed and Congress passed a "Digital Telephony"=
 law requiring that telephone companies build only networks that are easily=
 snoopable by the Feds. Now Freeh is waving that precedent around Congress=
 to justify banning <i>software</i> that's not readily snoopable. "We're=
 asking for a Fourth Amendment that works in the information age. When it=
 was designed by the framers, they didn't contemplate, obviously, Digital=
 Telephony and encryption," he told a Senate panel last week.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Both the House and the Senate are poised to=
 approve his plan. Rep. Sonny Bono (R-Calif.), who once staunchly opposed=
 such a measure, told me yesterday that "we weren't aware of" all the issues=
 and there are others "we have to be concerned about." Bono and his=
 colleagues on the National Security committee yesterday voted 45-1 to gut=
 "<A HREF=3D"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.695:"=
 TARGET=3D"_new">SAFE</A>," a House bill that would have relaxed export=
 controls. Their amendment gives the White House the same veto over exports=
 it has today

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Now SAFE moves to the House Commerce and=
 Intelligence committees, which are expected to vote on Freeh's proposal=
 later this week. "They're going to address some of Louis Freeh's concerns,"=
 Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Penn.), an opponent of SAFE, told me yesterday. The=
 Senate already is <A=
 HREF=3D"http://cgi.pathfinder.com/netly/editorial/0,1012,931,00.html"=
 TARGET=3D"_new">moving in a similar direction</A>. The sad irony, of=
 course, is that legislation originally designed to promote freedom may be=
 perverted to limit it. In a way, though, this outcome was inevitable: the=
 intelligence community wields enormous power on Capitol Hill. Privacy gurus=
 and business lobbyists are simply outnumbered and outgunned.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If Congress doesn't have the courage to do the=
 right thing, we should demand they do nothing. As technologies evolve, we=
 need to preserve our civil liberties, and courts -- not the Congress -- are=
 their most reliable champion. Since any encryption bill is bound to be=
 corrupted in the dank legislative byways of Capitol Hill, it's now time to=
 turn obstructionist. We should reject all legislative changes to encryption=
 rules and let the courts decide.

My wonderful friend Lisa is looking for a ride to a party called Serenity,
which is in Shasta this weekend.  If you have a ride, give her a call at
(415) 626-9635.  The info line for the party is (916) 224-8549 or (916)
551-1121.  Lisa is one of the most entertaining people you'll meet and I
can promise you that her wit, good looks, intelligence, humor, and unique
view of the world will more than make up for any inconvenience you incur in
picking her up.  She lives in the Mission, and would like to hear from
someone as soon as possible.  Thanks!

And of course, I flake out at the last minute... (car trouble)

Yep, their album is called Dead Elvis, I picked it up in england, so 
that's not a lot of help.

I think (thunk...) that there's an earlier album floating around as 
well.

Please, let's not be overly melodramatic... You have never seen more
disrespectful actions in the real world?! Hello! People are getting
beat-up, raped, killed, falsely imprisoned, etc. etc. every day...
Can't get much more disrespectful than that.

Aww, how sweet and non-confrontational of you. If you have a problem with
someone, how about taking some of your own advice and confronting them
with it? Really, how do you expect to correct problems if you don't go to
the source rather than making broad statements that may or may not apply
to someone or anyone at all from that individuals perspective. You are
counting on those select fools to think like you do. Given their inability
to even enter a conversation with a modicum of civility or post
anything but, what makes you think they are of the same mindset as you and
will know that you are talking about them?

Who?

It can be. The list reflects some of what is present in the real world.

Big deal. Drama is present everywhere in the world, in every scene and
culture.

But this being a scene, most of the people here have personally met some
of the folks here. So I don't know how "anonymous" this all is.

Run! Run away! Creep silently through the night! Don't say anything to
the total assholes, you might upset and/or provoke them! Puleez....

How? By making sweeping statements that are directed at no one in

So, by avoiding dealing with the source(s) of the problem(s) you perceive,
do you feel you have really accomplished anything? 99.99% of SF-Raves and
the world can agree with you, but if you don't reach the .01% causing the
problems, what exactly do you hope to accomplish?

Well, I don't know if you will consider my post "bashing," however my
intent is to point out my view that your method of addressing the
problem is prone to failure as it deals in generalities.

Do you have a persecution complex, or are you just unable to deal with
the possibility that some others may not feel the same way as you about
everything you say and might wish to converse with you about your
viewpoints? If you really wish to make a difference, why is it that you do
not have the courage to stay, but instead choose to run? Who wins then?

	AARRRRGGGGHHHH!	Take this crap _OFF_ the list!  I am able to stand
a little bit of friskyness (I know I've been guilty of the same), but I
do not like a spam list that stretches across twenty-odd responses.  There
should be a definite limit on this type of bandwith abuse.  At this point,
there is more "Re: your mail/Re: Disrespect on SFR" listings than any
party related discussions.

ahhh, my favorite thread!

here's my patented recipie for both rave energy and eternal salvation:

the nutri-flip:

go to your local health food store and buy some spirulina (the powder,
not the capsules, for some reason those never seemed to work for me). 
go ahead and splurge for the good stuff, it's all expensive anyway. 
peel and freeze a couple or three bananas overnight, 
break them up and put them in a blender with a heaping
tablespoon or two of spirulina, 1/2 cup orange juice (crucial), and
any other flavors you feel like tasting.  finally, top it all off with
a couple of spoonfuls of royal jelly for that mind-blowing one-two
punch.  then share it with a friend before going out to that big
all-night event - teenagers will be coming up to you asking what
you're on.

I don't think you're wrong with the whole bunch-o-genres idea for the 
f0am party!  I think the best parties I've been to have been ones with a 
diverse selection of music.  Any one subgenre gets boring after 6 or 8 
hours straight.  When you mix it up, you get a tase of what all is out 
there and it gives you a chance to hear stuff that you probably wouldn't 
hear on your own.  :)

By the number of people involved in this silly little thread, I'd say many
of us like, even feed, the drama... by choice.  *You* posted in response,
didn't you?  And I don't think anyone "forced" you to do it.

Personally, I think it's funny when people complain about the volume of
messages.  Why the hell are you an a mailing list if you don't want mail?
Yes - I understand spamming can be annoying.  That's what the DELETE is for.

Perplexed by the Uproar,

Who's still in for the Santana Concert?!?!  We're meeting up before the
concert!

         Okay, so guess what happened?  Despite my financial woes as of
late, it looks like I get to come down to the Bay Area and go see
Santana this weekend after all!  I have to go to my sister-in-law's baby
shower in Fremont on Saturday.  And my friend from up here is a bit
stressed out right now and needs to get out of this boring county for a
day or two, so she called me up and asked me to take her to the Bay Area
and take her out.  I told her I couldn't because I didn't have any money
to go down there and my bills are more important than trips to the Bay
Area, and she said that she needed this so bad that she would pay for
both of us.  Her car is running funny, so all she asks is for me to
drive and take her where she'll have fun.  Yay!
         So on the agenda for the weekend is the Santana concert at the
Shoreline on Sunday evening!  When mentioned almost a month ago on
SFRaves, you all had shown interest in going.  So now I'm wondering if
the interest is still there.  If you still want to go, we're buying
lawn/general admission tix for $16.50 at BASS.  Santana is playing with
Rusted Root and the show starts at 7 P.M.  I'm trying to get some sort
of group thing together, so we can all meet up some place before the
concert, and then carpool there... And then we can all hang together at
the concert!!!   We can pick our own little spot for all of us
SFRavers!  I'd really love to go see Santana with a bunch of you guys!
It would really make my day and fill it with smiles!  I won't be able to
check my e-mails after around 2 PM on Saturday afternoon and I won't be
reachable at my home #s (209-984-3918 and 209-984-5151) after around 4
PM Saturday, so if you don't get this until later, go ahead and either
page me or leave me a voice-mail at (415) 790-1759 to let me know if
you're coming.  And hopefully by Saturday morning, I'll know exactly
where we're meeting up (probably City Espresso, but that's not definite)
and what time we need to meet up to carpool to Shoreline.  Hope to talk
to you soon!
                         Starting to Smile Again,
                                                       Julie Mae
P.S.  I hope this makes it to the list.  I know I'm not currently
subscribed, but I e-mailed Brian to ask him to send it through.  If it
doesn't make it to the list could one of you please forward it?  And
again, for good measure, here's my pager/voice-mail #: 415-790-1759

Kirsten ("I wanna go to sleep") wants to party & Steve (Smurf hair) has 
been up for this for weeks so it looks like i get to celebrate my last 
night out in SF in style.....kewl :)

I think the time has been changed to 11.00 but i'm there....look out for 
fluro green shoulder stripes! (Or Steve's smurf-blue hair!)

Forgive my dumb-Brit ignorance but wot's a water booth? Is it:

a) another term for water fountain
b) like a photo-booth but with water (could get some interesting shots!)
c) a bar for water
d) the bathroom!
e) something else

Help me out here people....i s'pose i should just look out for the cool, 
happy folks near some water.....

Have fun folks & i'll see u there :)

<< I heard electric ends @ 3 am =\~ Does anyone know if there will be an

     how about 11:30 by the water booth.  Since this event (I can't 
bring
myself to call it a rave... it's more of a concert) ends early, we 
should
have an early meeting spot.  I'll have blackpants with white piping, my

Dear my family,

Here's an idea that I have just thought of.  How about each one of us 
somehow getting a picture or two of him/herself in computer formats such 
as bitmap, JPEG, or whatever and send them out to whoever is curious to 
know the face behind the personality.  I have been wanting to meet some 
of you personally at raves but, but, and but.  Believe it, I would much 
rather meet some of you in person but I have been busy lately.  So how 
about it my family?  

Yours truly,
Hai

Caffeine seems to be the cheapest "energy booster" around, but it isn't the
best.

If you want a good enrgy booster for late night studying, I'd go with a
nutrient called DMAE, it's available at a lot of health food stores.. It
makes me pretty linear.... not always what i want.. tho'


You can get a good morning lift from a big spoonful of tyrosine (an amino
acid) mixed with a little bit of scalding water, and then orange juice...

That is the best thing for those mornings after dancing, when your body is
about 10 pounds lighter...

Anyone see the article in the NYT a few weeks ago talking about how the
marketers are now targeting young (under 12) children as the next
marketplace for caffeinated drinks?  I thought that was pretty scary...

SoCal-Raves did something like this.  They made a Raver's Whitepages that
included links to everyone's homepages and to a picture.   Each entry gave a
chance to give a breif description of the person and it worked pretty well.

If you want to see it, go here:

I'm going for sure and I'm going to have a good time with my Daddy and 
smoke umm....some cigarettes?  ;) 
 I think everyone should wear their brightest wardrobes so we can all 
find eachother. 
 The thing about meeting somewhere ahead of time is if we actually 
waited for everyone,  weed end up missing the concert.  *>

I missed you all so much!  I won't take up your time, but after a much needed break
I am ready to be a part of your thoughts, questions and BSPs again.  Keep an eye
out, for I will soon be posting about my next pre-party (my third already!)  Here
is a hint:  next Saturday, before Play Nice (real subtle, no?)

--> 	Hi B.B.!  I ditto your sentiment.  It tastes like liquid gummi
bears but is so much worse than those Haribo gelatines.  It might taste
somewhat better with carbonation, but I doubt it.  A popular mix in ole
D'land was Red Bull with a shot or two of Vodka...ewwww :P   There are a
lot more energy drinks out there that taste much better.  There was one
called Lipo-something-or-other that was in a tall slim can (standard
e-drink shape, BTW); it tasted like lemon iced tea and was very
refreshing.  Another one had the SS Enterprise on it (can't remember the
name, but copyrighting isn't much enforced in Germany anyways) and was a
definite improvement over Bloody Bull***. 
	My fave though was this Guyrana drink (not the one in the US;
Josta or somethin (?) that tastes like cough syrup--YUCK!) that tasted
just like Mountain Dew...after three of those I was wired; but in a nice
way :)  The packaging was very similar to those small fat glass Pepsi-cola
bottles one used to get from vending machines.  Another "drink" was this
mega-shot that was packaged in a 12" long test-tube.  It had some red
colored *40* proof alcohol in it that evaporated once it hit your
tongue...not bad.  I can't remember the name (something to do with seismic
activity, I think), but I do recall seeing it somewhere in the US; maybe
NYC.  You know, there might be a trend to all this forgetfullness...maybe
I should slurp some carrot juice or V8 in the future, but then again, I
never did like the taste of a bloody Mary ;)

	I don't know how many other ravers went to BigTop, but other than Moby's
set, I felt the show was a disaster. No one was into the music early. They
saved the faster, more breakbeat performers for 4-5 AM, instead of putting
them on between 11-3. 
	The place was much to big and the crowd was rather meager for such a hyped
show. The overall vibe was pretty bad early, with most people there either
selling drugs or what seemed checking out the scene for the first time. I
feel for the second group because these people will be getting the wrong
impression of raves. 
	However, the biggest problem with the venue was the location. I don't no how
many people left the place, only to find there cars were broken into. I'd be
really curious to find out how many. I saw at least 5 or 6 smashed windows on
the way back to our car, only to find out by some twisted irony the same
thing had happened to us. 
	The driver side window was smashed, over a hundred CD's gone, wallets
missing, and other fun surprises only to be found later. And what made it
worse was the polices only response was "You shouldn't have been in Oakland".
I might take his advice. Sorry if I killed any good vibes or if I'm bitching
a little to much, but shit happens.

Okay now don't flame me just for going to this-Patrice had free 
tickects that her friend won off the radio, ouch-off the radio, I know-I 
know.  Anyways we went to check it out, it was our first commercialized 
rave and we wanted to know what it would be like.
	So after we get there(Pier 45) we meet lots of nice people, Dave 
from Seattle flew all the way down here just for it!  And it was supposed 
to start at 5pm, then we heard 6pm and then it finally started closer to 
7pm. 
	Jeno was up first and he did well.  It was really emtpy, hardly 
anyone danced for the first few hours.  After him some band came on--Booo 
& get the hell off the stage was heard from me---I mean what the f*ck a 
rock band at what was supposedly a rave.  Then we had, hmm(ask Patrice 
for the Line Up of Djs), then there was ANOTHER BAND, The chic was okay.
	The "Chill room" also served as their "Jungle Room" if you dare 
so call them.  Then out the back doors was a parking lot that you could 
smoke in.  Total police at the front and back of the place.  A sheet 
served as a wall between the main room and the jungle room.
	After the bands left and Dan came on things picked up, the 
Crystal Method was there and they did pretty good, my first time seeing 
them--all live.
	The best part was the H U G E cicle that there was for the circle 
dancers.  Although I think the vibe is definatly better at our raves, 
this one still had a decent one.
	We left at right before Doc Martin & Sneak came on, 
****Grrrr.**** I soo wanted to see them.
	But apparently they took out many people for overdosing on drugs. 
 They also had FREE BOTTLED WATER and FREE RED BULL energy drink, its 
like carbonated Kool-Aid.  IT had me sooo JiVeD for so long.  Can we say 
HyPeR?!?!?
	I think that is the end.  Oh yeah, they gave out free 
glowsticks, everything just about was free.  AND they had this hella cool 
thing that misted water out of the tips of orange street cones, it was in 
the shape of a star.  There should be one at every rave--they are soo 
good for cooling down.

Electric highway tour, rating (scale: 1-10):  3.5

Got there around 8, and it was a sparse crowd for such a large place.  $25 
freakin' dollars!  They better give out free Red Bull (that shit gave me a 
stomach ache).  DJ Dan was one of the better acts.  Fluke was ok, not great for 
dancing.  Some good videos, very loud sound.  Crystal method just couldn't seem 
to get it right.  Did anyone else notice this?  They'd start a build, then it 
would go nowhere.  Doc Martin was better, but by then everyone was tired and he 
never really set it off.  OK vibe, as in no negatives, but nothing to write 
mama about.  Did I mention loud?  Jungle room was ok, but still somewhat 
mediocre.  Free bottled water was the highpoint.

What did we learn from this weekend, liebe Gruppe?  Car break-ins at Big Top, 
ho-hum performances at EHT= Massives suck! Curiosity:  was that you Jeff, in 
the mask and orange roadworker outfit, in the circle?  Time for bed.

Okay. I seem to be one of a minority. I guess it's just 'cuz I seem to 
have fun everywhere I go. I liked it. Crystal Method were ok I guess. 
Nothing like I had expected. I'd heard them on CD and they were better. 
The chill out room was up&down. The times it was up... IT WENT OFF! (If 
you were there, I was the tall girl w/ the red knit cap [that kept 
coming off 'cuz my fro kept escaping] and red parachute pants that was 
jumping around like a fukin' madwoman with glowstix in full effect!) DJ 
Rap is good. I mean she's good. Little gurrrl... BIG boom.
  The water ran out (kinda insane), so I decided to use that tire/road 
cone misty thangy as an H2O fountain. Not quick, but refreshing.
  Question for all of ya. I've never done any drugs before (yeah,really) 
and I had decided (after 'bout 6 mos. worth of deliberation) that I was 
gonna E. Well, my friend & I took 1 each. 2 hrs. later... nothing for 
me, he was doing just fine. So I went back to the person and he gave me 
another (free) I took 1/2... nothing. I took the other 1/2... nada. 
Meanwhile, my friend is having the time of his life. Anyone ever had 
this problem before or am I just a fReAk of science?

 I've had a few ravers recommend Rusted Root, a neo-hippy world
music and percussion band, and I've never been to a Santana 
concert yet, so I'm really eager for the concert tonight!

 As far as meeting SFRave folks before the concert, looks uncertain as of 
9:30 AM today ...

 I was going to wear my new-agey sun/moon t-shirt, but I've decided
to wear something a little more unique and silly - my Goofy (tm) 
t-shirt! It's a black and yellow checkered shirt with a facial view
of the Disney character Goofy on the front of the shirt, and the
back of Goofy's head on the back of the shirt.

 It was one of my first "raving" shirts, so it's very special to me!
Also helps to identify me. 

 I may or may not also have my "SFR" cap on. I just got a very short 
( for me ) haircut - black hair, brown eyes, 5' 7". 

 I will bring a mattress pad for the lawn - if you can find me, you're
welcome to join me !

 I just took a look at the shirt, and it doesn't have Goofy's head 
on the back of the shirt - it says GOOFY in big blue letters.

*sigh* welcome to the world of new york area events (big ones, at least) -
although here in the city, you rarely get your CAR broken into since most
of us don't have one - you get your pocket picked, or god forbid you
brought some presents for friends - my friend got pushed up against a wall
once by some hoodies, and they took all his party favors and cash...  later
on that night, some guy walked by my boyfriend and tried to pick his
pocket...  lovely, eh?  

ya know, peeps, it seems like this crap happens everywhere - and even
weirder is that some of the silly things that have been happening here
lately on this list happen everywhere too...  sometimes i wish we lived in
houses instead of little boxes here (and to think that for manhattan, my
place is a spacious luxury) cuz i end up a lotta times at home, dancing in
my living room...  it's much more fun that way sometimes, and you won't get
arrested for doing it naked... ; -)

So, people...
We haven't yet learned to not leave a bunch of crap in the car?  Not to say
this theft was your fault but let's use our heads!  Even if these items
were hidden in the car, the windows may have still been smashed.  People
just like to be destructive sometimes.  But think about what a plus you
added to the jerks who did the breaking into.  "Hey, we were just being
ass-holes and smashing wiondows, but look at all this cool shit we came up
on!"  Had there not been a car full of goodies, the only thing lost would
have been a window.
Rave Intelligently,
Megan

Man.

I am not sure what life is like where some of you may be from.  I wish
that I could experience the innocence of block after block of houses with
their doors unlocked, and that type of thing, but as they say, you can
never go back.

As with any situation in which you are unfamiliar with the safety of your
stuff, be it travelling or going to a rave in a lurky section of the
world, PACK LIGHT.  The things of value should be carried on your person,
in such a way that someone would have to physically assault you to take.

Not to sound like some MARTIAL LAW LOOK OUT kind of muuuug, but listen...

An money belt is easy to find or make.  Get one.  Use it.  And if you go
to REI or anyplace like that to buy a money belt, you can also consider a
travel thing that is like a wallet that goes around your neck and has a
nice Cambrelle lining to go against your skin without being annoying.
These thangs are made for carrying your passport and other vitals without
them being accessible to the quickfingered public.

I tend to wear one sort of wrapped around my waist with the wallet part
between my pants and my KNICKERS.

Now that you know that, know also that should you try to use this
information to my demise and your profit, that I am well trained not only
in the Mad-Cow and Hungry-Tiger styles of kung-fu, but also the

Or was that Drinken Honkey?  I am ignorant of my own mastery, how quaint.

Oh oh!  By the way!  I finally just got up and motivated people with cars
to go to a party on a beach near Santa Cruz.  It was WICKED fun.
Beautiful sound, nice musical silliness, AMAZING lightshow care of moon
and sea, and funny people doing funny things.  It was all very California.
I should know.  I'm a medical doctor.  So word to the men called Eric,
Andy and Jay for making discs revolve with soul and flavor.   THAT CHAKA
KHAN TRACK WAS AMAZING, someone tell me what it was, or was it just
clever mixing?



Yours forever, in Turbo and Ozone,

In terms of drinkable energy boosters, I like some of the Durk
Pearson/Sandy Shaw formulas.  BLAST is the original, active ingredients
are caffeine and phenylalanine; also has the vitamin content of a
multi.  It tastes orangey and can be mixed with water (kind of
tang-like), or far better, throw it in the blender with a banana and
some juice and frozen berries and you  have a delicious smoothie. 
Because of the phenylalanine content, it is best consumed on an empty
stomach (phe. is an amino acid that will compete with those in your food
if taken that way).

I am just now sippin on a "MELLOW BLAST" smoothie; this newer formula of
theirs also has phenyalanine, but less caffeine as that present is only
in the form of green tea polyphenols (added as an antioxidant).  This
one also has vitamins and grape skin extract (another antioxidant).  I
think it tastes better than the BLAST formula, but it may be the fresh
mango I put in the mix.  

They also make a few other variations on this theme, turbo blast, and
capsule forms of all of the above.  Pretty smooth, I think.  These are a
mail order product only.

For energy boosts in a pill/capsule form, I like the PEP products you
can find in any health food store.  Ingredients vary depending on which
type of PEP you get, but include the usual herbal stimulants:  ephedra
in some, guarana, gota kola, ginseng, etc.  These too are not too speedy
and give you a nice lift when needed.  Try 2 capsules.  

happy sunday all!

Man, when those commercials say, "Red Bull gives you wings."  They are right.  I 
had like 4 or 5 cups of that shit at EHT, and I was so hyper from it that I think 
I began to scare people into thinking that I was on something(I WAS TOTALLY SOBER)

But here's a little staory about me lying down on the ground from a stomach ache 
at EHT....So I am outside lying on the ground with a stomach ache and some cop 
comes up to me and asks if I am okay.  I said yes-just a stomach ach.  Then he 
proceeds to ask me what day it is and where I am.  "Its Saturday & I am at a rave 
in San Fran, on pier 45."  "Okay, you sound alright."  I heard lots o people were 
takin out on overdoses.  COME ON PEOPLE SMARTEN UP!

Just a correction....   BIG TOP was NOT MEGGABUZZ,  Not even close to the same party, nor
put on by the same people.  Megga-Buzz-Mania was a Feel Good Entertainment Event,  Big Top
was Space Children.

That event was NOT a Rave, nor was it a massive... It was an Electronica Concert Tour held
in a warehouse.

This is why I want to point out the difference, because at Megga-Buzz-Mania, We had 15
patrol guards walking the streets of oakland in a i mile radius of the party... LOOKING
around and patrolling cars to keep them from getting broken into.  WHY... Because we are not
like any other big-rave production company in this scene... We care about you... Not your
money.  And unlike at big top, where the police told me they had 17 auto break-ins that
night (had that was about 5 when I was leaving)  We only had 2 on our night.

Heya!

Went to the airport last night to get our records, and found our labels
came through with some promos to give away. Should be enough for the first
30 people or so.

Also, 3D from Chicago will be here, as well as Curious from LA. 

Should be nice 'n sweaty!

:)

<< Electric highway tour, rating (scale: 1-10):  3.5
 
 Got there around 8, and it was a sparse crowd for such a large place.  $25 
 freakin' dollars!  They better give out free Red Bull (that shit gave me a 
 stomach ache).  DJ Dan was one of the better acts.  Fluke was ok, not great
for 
 dancing.  Some good videos, very loud sound.  Crystal method just couldn't
seem 
 to get it right.  Did anyone else notice this?  They'd start a build, then
it 
 would go nowhere.  Doc Martin was better, but by then everyone was tired and
he 
 never really set it off.  OK vibe, as in no negatives, but nothing to write 
 mama about.  Did I mention loud?  Jungle room was ok, but still somewhat 
 mediocre.  Free bottled water was the highpoint.
 
 What did we learn from this weekend, liebe Gruppe?  Car break-ins at Big
Top, 
 ho-hum performances at EHT= Massives suck! Curiosity:  was that you Jeff, in

 the mask and orange roadworker outfit, in the circle?  Time for bed.   >>


Well.. The high point in my evening was definitely DJ DAN.  What can I say??
I got my money's worth.  00$$.  Well.. after freezing outside of the
warehouse and trying to pull some, "I'm with the promoters, I'm on the set-up
crew," so I could get inside and get warm, I opted for cuddling with whoever
I could find.  It was the weakest appearance of SFRavers anywhere, but how
can I blame you guys??  
I definitely noticed the Red Bull was not agreeing with ANYOne... and I speak
from personal experience.  the Sound system sucked, and yet they thought if
they turned it up louder the fuzzies would go away.  Apparently the cops were
there way past when they were supposed to be.  (You could hear the sound from
four blocks away, there were a few to many overdoses, and the
drug-dealer-to-party-goer ratio was waaay off)  
No where to sit... I tried to covet an innertube I found as a comfy chair,
but apparently that was a decoration in progress and some Live 105 crew
member stole it from me to hang from the ceiling.  Opting for a couch behind
the nice man selling glass pipes, I finally got some rest.  However,  Sitting
behind a drug paraphenilia counter in a well lit area with people you've just
met is not the thing to do when your mom decides that she's bored and wants
to stop by to see how the party is going.  HI MOM!! SO WHAT DID YOU THINK????
Hello to Vlad, Terry, Ryan, Laurea, Teresa, and everyone else who tried to
make this pitiful event somewhat happy.

           hugs,

heya Teresa :)
Your post about a large amount of overdoses @ the Electric Highway Tour
brings up a couple questions in mind....
1) This Red Bull drink.. what EXACTLY does it contain? Shit it sounds good
but YOU got a tummyache, someone else on the list got a tummyache..
Hmmm...
Also... Maybe the combo of drugs & Red Bull was a little overwhelming to
some people and overdoses occurred?

Also... this tour was radically promoted, in the mall, on the radio...
etc.. maybe it wasn't the combo of red bull and mad drugs, but... people
who don't usually go to parties and drugs.. uneducated folks and drugs..
mm?
Just a few ideas..
or maybe there were just really bad drugs floating through?
nevertheless... 
I hope all are OK and DJ Rap kicked ass

That Red Bull crap was pretty refreshing. It tasted like Sweet Tarts! And
it gave me a heart Burn that reminded me of sweet tarts. Ouch.. Yuck.
Please don't belch again.

Cydomax.
 This stuff is great.. First time I had a glass was in the morning before
work. And I was like dancing at work with no music. Like I had ants in my
pants for shore. Like James Brown or something. And I forgot to get coffee
that morning! 
 Cydomax comes in a powder form, you can find it at GNC in two (maybe more
now) flavors.. You can make a smoothie, or just mix it straight with water
or milk. Fill a zip lock sandwich bag up and take it to the ravE. Shore ads
flavor & Color to your water bottle.
 Anyone ever drink so much coffee, it ended up having an opposite effect on
you? Like coffee totally drains your blood sugar..Don't be surprised if you
find yourself laying in bed awake with your mouth wide open zoning-out in
the middle of the day after a couple tall mocha's. But if you have a
Cydomax, it completely feels like your blood sugar jumps back to normal
within a few minutes.
 I used to suck on lolly-pops at the ravEs to increase my blood sugar
levels.. But one glass of Cydomax does the job much more efficiently..
It even warns you to NOT drive while taking Cydomax. Because cops might
think your spun or something.
It's intended use, Weight lifting.

Jeff nStuff..
Wanna hear something trippy?
I used to workout in high school three times a week for two years.. The
teacher gave me Most Improved in the class... I used to be like, buff
nStuff.
Woh..
Trip huh?
Yep, continuation school P.E. was bomb.
Jeff nStuff reports: Feeling the rhythms can actually make you lose muscle
mass.
Look at most musicians.. =]:...


And while I am like, shooting the sh!t nStuff.. Anyone that has to build a
computer from time-to-time read this.
 Me being in TechSupport & RMA, I have to build a customer a new computer
every so often. And I usually get chewed out like it's my fault or
something.. "Hey man! You sent me a F'ed up computer man. I want you to
send me a whole new one! And I want your word that it will work this
time!!" I don't work in Assembly. Nor do I do Q.C.  So when people come
across like this to me. I get alittle annoyed.
 So last week I was determined to do something to this one guys computer. I
mean, I couldn't bug it, or flaw it...I gave him my word it would work
right! (customer satisfaction).. So I came up with the idea for "TIP"
pranks..
 Well, I had to load Win95 onto the computer. And I noticed before how
there are some really funny Tips like in Linix.. And you know how after you
successfully install Win95 it has thoughs damn tips popping up on start-up?

 So I searched and searched for where these Tip reside in the Win95 data
base nStuff. And I found them all in the registry.

Click on the Start button, select RUN, type Regedit.. Goto:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\Tips
Then on the right of the regedit screen, click on the AB number you want,
and select Modify..

I messed with hell of Tips on this guys computer... One of my favorites
was..
Did you know...
Using too much laundry detergent can actually increase hemroid expansion?

Followed-up (ofcourse) with:
Did you know...
Tucks medicated pads can actually stop the itching, burning sensation of
hemroidal flare up?

Something like that.  =]

Not to disagree with the beautiful Megan Haggerty nStuff.

I do agree with you. People that write about how offended they are with
current posts are just adding there two cents to the flame pretty much.


Although I don't complain about it. My beef is, having to delete these
waist of skin e-mails all the time, increases my chances of missing
something really good.

You know?

Nop..
 That was not me.. But I was around there somewhere, being all exausted..
Not sure though, I didn't have my compass. 
That dood was sure cool though huh?

I can't Pop & Strut no more. My friend Juan though, in the sixth grade.. He
tought me how to Pop & Strut back then... Then around the 8th grade. My
enemy Mr Hype tought me how to feel uncomfertable doing the break dancing
thing. I sure could of used alittle ravE encouragement back then.

I feel silly dancing like that now a days. And I don't feel silly dancing
the way I do. Go figure.
Yep.. It's a strange world we live in.. Just look at me. Who would of
imagined someone like me exsisted.

i was informed last night that the reason this pier is empty is due to a
labor strike that happened (don't know when) and apparently the company
just fired and moved elsewhere (you noticed the lack of running water and
bathrooms - wouldn't you strike too?)  - you'll have to forgive my
ignorance on local issues - i did just move here a few months ago... but
then i guess the choice of location really shouldn't be surprising given
the sponsors. :P i _will_ give them credit, and huge thanks for all the
freebies... it was just a bit weird to have ppl selling tires at a party.
weird occurence of the night: this live 105 woman tried to give me a
sticker and when i asked what it was, she looked at me in disgust and said
snidely 'a band'. no thanks. (*shrug*)

i *know*!!!!!! what the (and i'll say it) FUCK?!?!?!?!? and they, along
with the other *cough* band seemed to set a rather discordant mode with the
music that ensued. yuck. (imo ;) i was with you right there, screaming
*boo* go *home*! (liked the fact that they didn't even know where they
were...)

'our' raves... a bit exclusive, no? but i'll have to agree. i made some eye
contact and talked to ppl, tho!

you know, when i first walked in, my first reaction at seeing all the
stands and everything was 'hey - like a dead show!' loved the stand with
all the glowing toys... sure wish they had had ear plugs tho. LOUD! and a
pity, 'coz the 1 larger space seemed to drown out the other. alas, it was
not what i was hoping for tho. (you can tell i'm a bit disturbed by this)
tire stands??? and was that *really* supposed to be an art exhibit?!?!? HA!
but yeah, the stack that spewed water (so conveniently near the really dark
port-a-potties) was a luxury.

>        We left at right before Doc Martin & Sneak came on,
>****Grrrr.**** I soo wanted to see them.

you left too early, imo. i didn't *really* enjoy the music until their set.
then... oh no! i couldn't stop dancing! :o (thanks kerry for your drumming,
tho, which kept me rolling until we got to the after party!) so what's up
with me, that i'm still dancing at 2 in the afternoon??? ;)

anyway, *i* had fun... but i couldn't have done it without the ppl i was
with, the ppl i met, and the ppl i just exchanged smiles with. it was *not*
the fun of live 105 or goodrich tires, i'll tell you that much!

cheers - e. :)

oh yeah: _1_ how come the flyer, and the postings, stated that it would be
$20 in advance? tower charged us $25 + their regular fee. _2_ how come when
we asked the ppl at the door when entering if the party would be extended
to make up for the lateness they told us that "yes, it would"? the shit
ended at 2!!!! i can't help but feel a bit abused - let's shut everything
down while ppl are just getting going (and when the music is finally
decent) so they'll come to our (not free) after party (where you couldn't
even bring in _empty_ bottles for water).... just doesn't seem (imo) like
very good pr - telling untruths to your customers.

time to stretch my back. :)

yes, one of my worst experience was at what should have (and would have,
anywhere else) a peaceful, or in the catch-phrase of the day, a plur-y
event, was at the meadowlands. (yes....) a dead show, where a *lot* of ppl
had their bikes and things stolen from their vehicles in the 'camping' area
(which was inside the facilities, supposedly... not to mention that there
was rumor that a cop actually killed a deadhead after one of the shows....
(i did witness quite a bit of unnecessary violence on behalf of the
security there - funny guys with bandanas, tie-dies, and batons... :P)

but you know, it's really weird... i've frequented nyc with my car, as well
as phila. (including germantown, for those of you who are familiar with the
city), houston, made a few visits to oakland, and i now live in the
tenderloin...  but the only place my car has been robbed was in the
*suburbs* of my pretty quiet hometown of rochester, ny. i even worked there
in the projects, but nothing ever happened there either. but, after about 5
robberies during which both the exterior and interior of my car was
_trashed_, many tapes (oh those bootlegs!), leathers, boom boxes... you
name it (except my car-stereo, which each time proved to be resistant to
their attempts)... it's been taken. so what's to learn? a. theft insurance.
they'll even reimburse you for tapes. :) b. don't leave valuables (things
that are expensive, or can't be replaced) in your car! it's just asking for
it. and for me, i've learned not to buy little red cars (mine was a gti,
and at the time i bought it, i read an insurance report statintg that a.
vw's and hyundai's (??) are robbed the most frequently, and b. red cars
have the worst reputation for getting broken into (and i have quite a few
comparitive stories to back this up, and not just my own); yellow cars have
the best (still haven't had the nerve to buy a yellow car tho!). anyway,
the point of all this dribble (and i'm doing a lot of that today) is that
this shit happens *everywhere*. and it's _not_ uncommon.

cheers - e. :)

Hey yeah, and while you're at it, why don't you GROW UP and stop dancing
so hard.  The only way, of course to dance till dawn, outside of you know,
flossing your teeth and eating plenty of fibre, is to just not dance like
you were a nutter.  Try just chilling out and relaxing people.

Actually, DRINK SNAKE JUICE.

Sorry.

=p

All I can say is, if I had payed $25 fer that, I woulda been mighty mighty
MAD!

I was expecting more from the Crystal Method. They were WEAK!

Fluke was interesting. I thought they were a little too on the "rockstar
trip".

DJ Dan, made me sm;)*e as always.

My first time hearing DJ Rap. She blew me away. She is THE provisioner of MAD
KRAZY JUNGLE beats!!!

Besides the fact that it was a weak party, it was especially hard for me to
have fun because of my stupid sore foot. I had to hobble in pain during the (
few ) points of good music.

I finally met Patrice ( TeKnOdiVa ), yer a sweetie thanx fer the sticker =)~
I hope to meet more sfravers in the future, hopefully under better
circumstances...

So wat'd everyone else think? Oh did anyone happen to go to Big Top? I'm
curious as to how that went.

Spread some vibe...

Okay folks, here is the nitty-gritty:
Saturday, Sept 20 (in honor of Play Nice)
approx 6pm - 10pm
DJs Thorfio and ???
In Santa Clara, right next to SCU (why, that's on the way for most of you...how convenient!)


FROM 101: Get on 880 going South (Santa Cruz) and continue with the directions below


FROM 280: Get on 880 going North (Oakland) and continue with the directions below


FROM 880: Take The Alameda exit.  Turn right if you are coming FROM the north (101)
and left if you are coming FROM the south (280).  About a mile down there will be
a left turn lane with a light for The Alameda (yes, again).  Turn left.  You will
almost immediately see a Safeway on your left.  Turn in to the parking lot and cut
across in front of the Safeway.  (It is a small lot.)  Turn left at the road on the
other side and park anywhere.  My apartment complex is the only thing behind the
Safeway.  Go to number six or follow the noise.  And there you are!

If you have any questions call 408-984-6360.  Most of you live in or around SF, do
you really want to make the drive to Monterey in one shot?  Take a break at my place!
 It is easy to find, honest.

If anyone has equipment, decorations, food etc. they would like to bring I would
be delighted!  I want to see some new faces, don't be shy!!  I'll even have some
goodies for you.

Write or call with questions or even if you just want to talk...just because Summer
is ending doesn't mean the fun is ending.

>:) Amber

chill out and relax?  um, wait a minute - i dunno, part of going to a party
for me is dancing myself TO EXHAUSTION BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP BECAUSE THE DJ
IS FUCKING ME HARD...

So, if the dj is good and the music is even better, it's gonna be virtually
IMPOSSIBLE for me to stand there and chill out - I NEED to be a "nutter"
sometimes...  And I'd really miss being able to walk around a party and
pick someone out I don't know, stepping in front of him/her with a big
stupid danceface on, and throwing down with 'em...  It's a good way to make
new friends at least for the six or so hours you're inside the party
microcosm...

Hey guys, please don't laugh - where's Alameda, and what's the relation to
whatever major city it's near (time, cost of living, blah blah blah)?

Microprose has my DREAM job and they're doing Magic the Gathering's online
networked magic game...  *drool*

speaking of, any magic players on here?  

the game is CRACK for those of you who need a healthy version of it...  I
would easily sacrifice a saturday night to sit around and play this
(actually, that's what i did last night)...

Actualy this scpace is a special event venue.  It is available to be rented for
special events by anyone.  You can rent it anytime for any party, as long as it
ends b4 2am... thats why it is never been used for an underground or a real
rave.. cause its limited, and expensive.  And its BORING!  Willy Brown had his
enogurational ceramony there when he became mayor of SF, and this location hosts
many anual festivals, and events, skate demos, art and wine festivals, the 87
dcronicle Centenial celebration, and much more.  Its a turnkey facility for
comercial events.

I liket the water shower, but I must agree with you on the so called "Tire Art"
It was So FONY!  You would think that any artist that would pertray his medium or
urban artwork would ATLEAST not comprimise the urban Persona by using USED tires
in the art work... I took a close look at them, And thew were just a stack of
BRAND NEW painted tires...  What a bunch of hypocritical CRAP>!!!!

I feel for you bro, Its  sad when people tell you anything you want to hear
untill they get your money, and then  all bets are off!!!  "Thank you for
participating in the BFGoodrich underground marketing experiment.... That will be
$25 please"

YUK!!!!!!

Keep it real

Electric Highway was a strange experience.  I had a lot of fun, I met a
cool guy named Andy, and we danced all night, but it was still wierd. I
just cant even explain it.  Me and 3 of my friends came all the way from
Tahoe to see Crystal method and we wernt impressed with the preformance but
it wasnt that horrible.  I liked the spray thing but it was quite
depressing that the water ran out.  I was unhealthaly dehydratd.  Dj Dan
was soo sick!! I had a blast during his set but i was kinda sad cause I
wanted to see Dj Rap and i missed her.  Well thats all for my review.. I
cant wait for the next party i come down for i hope its more worth the 4
hour drive than this was....  :)

Well, I didn't actually go in and pay any $$ or anything, but I got to be
called a "m-f-ing weirdo" by some really *cool* guys that were standing
around near the pier.  :)  Weren't there any candy ravers inside?
Hmmmm.....Didn't phase me, tho :)
Then, my posse and me went to the after party, but got there about 30 mins
early, and so noone was out there but a cop and some guy painting over some
tagging.  Did it go off?  We were worried the party would be busted, so we
split b4 it started....then we came back to Oakland and went to Super
K-mart and walked around, me in all my necklaces, bracelets, n stuff :) :)
:)
And that was my experience with Electrick Highway.  :)

OH, but I did get to have a lil fun at people's park for about an hour or
so.  Big HI to Anthony E, Nico, Zina, and SmileGirl Julie Mae (thanks for a
groovy afternoon!!!)  Disappointment of the day.....I was all prepared to
meet Teknodiva for the first time, and I find out that she left 30 mins b4
we got there....Waaah!!!

Peace, Hugs, and Happiness :)

Heya, SFR People :) :) :)
In light of how many people were disappointed with the two massives this
weekend, do you think that other upcoming massives in the same vein (e.g.
Cyberfest 97 and Life Force) will be about the same?  I had wanted to go to
Cyberfest 97, but now I'm apprehensive about spending that much money for
something that will totally not be worth it.  It sounds like it's going to
be TOO big (30 acres!).  What do you think?  Do you think people should go
to smaller parties on the days of those events, or do you think those two
will be cool?

Little Johnny and Jane are playing in the garden when they start having
an argument about
whether boys are better than girls. After a while Johnny stands up and
pulls down his shorts
saying 'Boys are better than girls 'cos you haven't got one of
these!!'.
 
Jane looks at him in astonishment as she knows that she hasn't got one
 of those between her
 legs. She bursts out crying and rushes inside to her mother. A little
 while later she comes
 back out with a big smile on her face.
 
 'My mum says girls are better than boys', she says.
 
 'No they're not.' says Johnny pulling down his shorts, 'You haven't got
 one of these!'.
 
 Jane looks at him, then raises her skirt, pulls down her panties and
 says
 
 'My mum says that as long as I've got one of these, I can have as many
 of those as I want!!'

Had ablast driving to the city, talkin' with a good friend all stoked to 
go to Virgo.  We just left the map point and before we all know it, 
johnny and his twinkies are staring at all of us ravers right in the 
face.  Everyone stood around and picked our asses and eachother's as 
well trying to figure out what to do because there was no alternate 
location for some dumb reason.  Later, after just a bout everyone left I 
went and checked out if the party was going off and it was.  We get out 
of the car and...BOOM!!! There they are ...more twinkies  :(  So we went 
back to a friends house fairly bitter and watched the walls and clouds 
move ;)...  Had a greattime Lisa, Nita, Tracy, Kyle, Bran-don, Rebecca, 
Blake and George,,,you are all the bomb.  Oh, and Ron, Wherever you are, 
I just wanted to give you a personal thank you...Great times with people 
you love.

Megan,

I was upset at your response to this. I wasn't going to post this to
the
list (because I don't believe its very rave related i.e. you take the
risk when you park anywhere). Since you decided to say "Had there not
been a car full of goodies, the only thing lost would have been a
window- rave intelligently."

First, I rave intelligently and have been for 7 years. I parked in a
well lit, highly visible spot. I had nothing
in my car except an empty coffee cup. My side window was smashed,(a 94
truck nothing special except to me) they stole the seats, the steering
wheel, parts of the engine! do you want me to go on? I was violated and
you are saying its my fault for not "raving intelligently" that is
crap.
The police said they had 18 reported incidents and there were probably
two or three different crews working the area. The one that hit me,
well
lets just say they are good at what they do. 

The fact that you try to insult my intellingence, for someone robbing
me, is just wrong. 
> So, people...
> We haven't yet learned to not leave a bunch of crap in the car

Yes, and I didn't!! Remember you are posting to over 400 people. When
you responded to this you assumed everyone who got robbed is some
idiot who was asking for it. Well I didn't, and I did take
precautions, however, my nickname (lucke) didn't turn out to be the
case that night. I took the risk and I accept the responsibility.
Please, take a moment before you write a post to think about what you
are saying. My night was bad enough without you telling me I'm stupid.
I did nothing wrong.


Why did you fell it necessary to be negative and blame us? Even if that

Okey Dokey, here's a review. Not a "E"view but a review.

Derek, Herb, and Myself arrived at about 9ish. We walked into the party
without having to wait in line (which was nice). Entering the party was
like entering the deathstar or something. It always has that essense of
darkness, emptiness, etc. I looked far ahead and some some AWESOME visuals
and some major bass and stuff was pumping. We spent a few moments in the
porta potties and were on our way. :) THe first thing I noticed was that
the music was REALLY hard and mostly on the dark side. So I looked at my
watch and wondered when BT or some other group would come on and take me
to where I like to be; high above in the white puffy clouds where the cute
little pigs fly with their platinum white feathery wings... and their
currly little tails flapping in the wind... :) But I never
got a chance to see Wilber. My journey would leave me somewhere between
dark jungle and pumping dancinble trancy techno. Unfortunately Tony or
Jeno were not on the bill. :( So the three of us danced from one area to
the next (and were like the only people dancing a lot of the time.. it was
strange) and never really saw very many people we knew. The strangest thing about this
party was the low energy level. I think the party was so long that people
were arriving at all different hours and you never saw a moderate energy
level within a large group of people. It was so scattered. Plus by about
2-3am people were exhausted it seemed.... and as each act/dj was
performing people seemed so unaware of what they were doing and were concentrating on
the act that was setting up behind them. I think there should have been a
curtain or something. It was like people were constantly *waiting* for the
next act and never focused on the current act as much. I dunno maybe I
crazy but this is how it felt. Like there were all these acts crammed into
a space and each act had about an hour... something that took place just
to draw a lot of people and give them a small taste of what these
extremely talented acts had to offer. I think this should have been a two
day event that cost the same and you could go both days. That way you
would be able to actually enjoy BT at 3 am.. if you were there at 4
you would either be totally wired by 3 or 1/2 asleep....
as for me, I was so exhausted by 3 that it took a lot of effort to
raise my hands to the air to participate in the mass groove that BT
suggested.. :)

Overall I think I could have skipped this party and save my (actually
Herb's) $30 for Cyberfest or Life Force. I'm beginning to realize how much
I love house and Bukem style drum and bass. Whatever music it is, it has
to make me feel like I'm walking in the clouds towards the love of my
life... and once we meet we'll bond forever and ascend to the heaves
above... *snap* *snap* *snap* *slap* ok,ok,... enough of my day dreaming.
But you know what I'm saying. I look for LOVE and UNITY at parties and I
NEVER feel that at Space Children parties. The last time I felt that was
at All Together Now.... I can always count on FeelGood Entertainment,
Martin's parties (The Gathering, Freedom, basics) and Pacific SOund system
to take me to that place.....

I hope to see you guys at Cyberfest. It's going to be fun. You all should
go and give this MASSIVE a chance. Massives always have that MASSIVE vibe.

Lets all go and increase the LOVE and UNITY. There's no excuse for
complaining about massives if you're not there giving all your love and
making the party what you want it to be.

 				Byroni... .. .

For all those people out there who think DJ Rap dropped "phat beats" 
and did such a great job, I have a couple of questions for you. Are 
you high? Were you in the same room as I was? Maybe she was off that 
night, but in my honest opinion, she sucked. Can you say, "tennis 
shoes in a dryer?" She even stopped one record and started another 
one, killing any possible flow she may have created. And did you see 
her record stack? What was it, all of 20 records? Yes, I think it's 
cool to see a female DJ be brave and perform at a public event, but 
she sucked and doesn't receive all the rant and rave about her set at 
Electric Highway.
Just saying my piece   :-)

Okay here is my 2 1/2 cents about friday night.

Me and the droogs = ) got there around 8:00 ish.  The first real act that I 
saw was No U-Turn.  Not sure if Nico showed up all i saw was Ed rush.
A little dark at times but a lot of cool drum n bass. They
had a MC who i liked a lot but byroni and AI kept cracking up the next day.
"UK drum n bass ... the sound of the phuture .. phuture" = )

I talked to them later in the nite and they were pretty kool guys.

Next up was 808 State and I was pretty excited.  I last saw them on tour
with Meat Beat Manifesto in dallas May '93.  I must admit that I had high
expectations b/c of that too.  But they came out on stage (had a live drummer)
and proceeded to groove out.  There style has changed a lot over 4 years and 
they played a lot of experimental garage sounding tracks.  I got upset at a
some of the younger crowd due to the lack of respect they were showing.  The 
last song they played was cubik.  Man that was my favorite song back in the day 
and it brought back some good memories.

Next was kevin saunderson.  This was the first (and prolly only) time I have 
heard house spun at a space children party.  It was a nice change.  I just wish
the DJ's had more time to spin instead of just serving as fillers between the 
acts.

System 7 was next.  I saw them at Juggernaut and was kinda suprised that they
were back but their performance was a lot better then the last time. I think
most of that was due to the power outage in the middle of their set at 
Juggernaut.  Anyways, they produced some of the nicest ambient i have heard in
a while and was a nice change of pace.

Left the main room to check out Grooverider in the other room.  He was spinning
some great jungle/drum n bass.  I am a new convert to jungle/drum n bass.  i 
still prefer house/trance but I no longer run at the first sounds of the bass.
As byroni puts it he is very charismatic.  Swaying and grooving behind the decks

After grooverider was loop guru.  I saw them with Meat Beat manifesto back in 
november.  THey put on another good show I just wished they had more lights on 
that back stage. 

Wandered back into the other room to catch the last few songs of Andre lucero.
I was talking to a friend when all of a sudden the music stops and a voice rings
out over the speakers. " Hello my name is moby"  then the phat beat kicks in.
Man his performance was great.  While all the other acts seemed tired and glad
that the tour was coming to an end  Moby had more energy that half the audience
combined.  It was very reminescent of the prodigy/Moby/Cybertronic show I saw
back in 93 as well.  He played all of his classics as well as some new ones.
I couldn't stop dancing/smiling throughout his set.  I got this weird feeling
when someone asked me "hey who is this" puzzled I replied "Moby" I guess its 
very possible to not know who he was, but I am glad that that person has a 
such a positive experience to correlate with who moby is.  I was sober but I
thought I was going to explode.  My chest started to hurt from dancing so much
but I couldn't stop.  That defiantely made my night.

After that I was kinda down b/c i knew nothing was goin to top that but I
figgered that I might as well enjoy the rest of the show.

Joey Beltram spun all of his phat anthems.  Its amazing how many songs that guy
has produced.  Imagine being able to spin for hours and they are all your songs.
He tore it up.  Very much like he did that last time I saw him again in 93.
(1993 was a great year for me and the rave scene.  i will always remember that)
After he was done everyone was chanting "joey joey" and to much dismay of the
following acts he went on to play a few more songs.

after joey was this band called the headdrillaz.  I was very curious to see
what they sounded like and after the show was impressed.  A lot of people 
weren't dancing which kinda upset b/c if it was the prodigy ( who they
sounded a lot like, new prodigy that is) people would be dancing their butts off
oh well that is how it goes.  But i grooved. very high energy. A lot of angst
which is another reason i think people didn't groove veyr well with them.

On ther other stage was Eat Static.  They was this huge brain sculpture on stage
which had all this tripped out lighting.  Kinda wierd.  But as much as I liked
the music, I wanted some energy from them.  And after moby and the headdrillaz
two guys behind keyboards was not going to cut it.  Back to the prodigy show
from a long time ago.. At least they had dancers on stage to dance and move 
around so it just wasn't two of them behind keyboards.  Music was good but it
lacked life.

The long awaited 2x4 of Juan atkins and derrick may.  I was at the very front
seeing how the headdrillaz just finished and juan was kinda upset at this
stage/sound guy. I am not sure about what but it kinda threw me.  i don't 
remember seeing him smile.  Derrick may had one tho and looked puzzled at juan
as he proceeded to yell at the guy.  But they got their set going and started
grooving.  A lot of detroit techno which is okay in spurts but I didn't stick
aorund much.  I was not in the mood it seemed.  But everyone else was having
a good time which made me feel better.   I caught the last few songs which
i danced to and liked a lot.

On the other stage was BT.  This was just one guy and even tho he showed a lot
more energy that Eat static by hopping around behind his cage of electronic
equipment it didn't seem to spur much reaction from the crowd.  Again I really
liked his music but it felt lacking after seeing to high energy live acts.

I was getting really tired around 4:00 but seeing how i got there really early
it seemed acceptable.  I did manage to see empirion and they had a dark set
which didn't seem to appropriate.

All and all i had a great time seeing some acts that brought back some great 
memories.  My only complaint is that there were too many acts and not enough
time.  just when DJ's/acts were getting their groove on, time was up and they
had to stop.  Quantity does not equal quality.

Leaving I saw a few cars with smashed windows and shit.  I totally felt for them
b/c the same thing happened to me at 1015 a few months ago.  And my friend had
her car stolen from 1015 a couple of weeks ago.Its not just oakland or raving 
its metropolis and life in general. Things like this happen so we can appreciate
what we have.  

I hope in the future that promoters have better security, but they can't be
everywhere all of the time.

Lots of luv and mad hugz,

Herb

Don't worry, your opinion is heard and respected. Just a note, though,
because a lot of people don't realize that jungle dj's from the UK
operate in an entirely different culture from ours. For example, it's
completely normal to stop a record during your set. Not a whole bunch
of times, of course, but if a dj really wants to drop on particualr
track, or wants to change the vibe, or especially if it's the last
track of the night, they'll fade out of one track and start up
another. Now you might think this is weak, but honstly, it's just
different. A lot of jungle dj's don't care about taking you on a
'journey' and performing ultra-smooth mixes, but more like a hip-hop
dj, it's about slamming down the fat bass drops. 

As far as the the record stack, I don't understand why it matters that
there were only 20 records. Can you explain?

The amount of records a DJ brings to play a set does not matter. My 
apologies.

Yeah,

Jungle DJs are insane. :) They do things that don't make sense to the
average house raver. We're used to continuous mixes of melodic beats.
Jungle DJs stop the decks, scratch a lot, don't necessarily beat match and
have MCs.

I personally like the continuous mix and don't enjoy the choppy sound you
can get from jungle. But that doesn't mean the DJ sucks, in fact I give
anyone major props for spinning music in front of people. It takes a lot
of guts to do that. But the guts part can be replaced by the love you
should have for the music you're sharing with others.

This post covers 2 seperate requests. #1. If anyone is looking for P/T 
employment, I have a position available. You must have a car and either 
live or not mind working in SF. Also, you must be dependable. I am a 
chef and we need a driver for 2 mornings and 1 afternoon a week to 
deliver to a few homes & restaurants. It's good for a bit of extra 
spending (partying ; ) $ (aprox $100 per week). 
  Also, if anyone (especially whom I have been e-ing back & forth w/ 
about this fOaM party is able to come see a space w/ me tomorrow, I'd be 
ever so appreciative. This is especially if you have some knoweledge 
about production/promotion.
Please e me privately about either subject.
Thanks!

And lets not forget the Massive condom...the ones
with huge 4 color glossy packaging including the poster
telling you about the mind altering orgasm you will have
by using it...and then when you open it you find
you have just overpaid  for an ordinary condom.

or the underground condom that you can only get by 
calling a 800 number to find the mapoint where they can be 
purchased

or the goa condoms...the ones with psychedelic art on them.

or the jungle condoms painted with camoflage

or the candy raver condoms that glow in the dark
and are covered with glitter ...plus they come with free stickers

The stuff that gives Red Bull its "Zing" is called Taurine (The 
caffine and sugar do help too, tho). Taurine is naturally found in Bulls, 
funnily enough, some kind of hormoney stuff, but the stuff in Red bull is 
artificially produced.
I find it gives me pretty bad stomach ache after about 2 cans - 
managed 5 once and stayed awake for days.
The drink originally came from Austria, and a great local cocktail is 
Red Bull and Vodka - try it and see- rocket fuel feeling!
There is a better taurine drink called Indigo - don't think it's come 
over here yet - Wolfberry flavour and no stomach ache.
So there ya go

I believe Taurine is an Amino Acid.

You can also find such amino acids in various nutritional concotions 
at GNC and other health food and vitamin supplement stores.

I've found Twinlabs "Choline Cocktail" to be a good substitute for
coffee (has caffeine in the form of Guarana Extract, plus tons of
choline and b,c,e vitamins). It's a powder that you mix with water or 
juice to produce a drink. The only problem is that after a few days of
drinking it, you feel all amped out but you can't think productively
and just sit around daydreaming and staring at things, or you end up
wasting time in useless flame wars on SFR... :-)

A buddy of mine that I work with (who is from Amsterdam) told me that
Taurine is extracted from a Bull's testicle. :)

Hi all again,

So I am looking towards the rest of my week (like I always do on monday) and I
can't help but get a little depressed.

My once filled wednesday and thursday nights are now vacant. It seems like 
there isn't a good place to hang out with your friends and loiter = ).
But I just liked seeing the faces of people and my friends.  Talking and making 
plans for the weekend.

Oh well I know its not really that bad but hey I will definately notice 
something different about my week this week.

SMilez,

herb

Slow day at work so I get to post a lot today.

There are a lot of web sites devoted to taurine or so it seems.  There 
are a shitload of drinks out in the market with taurine as its main 
ingrediant.  But a brief description for all of you.

Taurine is am amino acid. It is found in all animals (including humans).  it
is called taurine b/c it is most abundant in the organ of bulls/ox hence the
name is derived from the word taurus.  Whether or not that is the source
of manufactured taurine I am not sure.

here is a general listing that is pretty informative about taurine.
http://www.smartbasic.com/glos.aminos/taurine.glos.html
or just type in the word taurine in your fav. search engine and watch about
1000 entried come up. = )

Herb = )

Okay I am a veggie but I wanted to try a few of these drinks to see what the bigdeal was all about.  My fav so far is the SoBe Power drink.

okay, i'm getting really disgusted now. i haven't eaten meat in ... 14
years (cheese, and a few fish, yes, but anything that grosses me out
doesn't enter my system ;) and i had a couple of these nasty drinks
saturday night. not only did i get stomach cramps and nausea from hell, i
haven't been able to sleep, and now i find that i may have injested
something extracted from a bull's _balls_?!?!?! who would have thought - in
a drink - that you'd have to check for animal products? gross. if you all
could see me, i am shaking from this news. i always assumed that the amino
acids i took were... i don't know really, but not from animals or people!
perhaps i sound incredibly naive, but can someone please enlighten me on
where these things come from? (yes, i am naive. i felt like such an idiot
when i realized what gelatin was made of! another gross one.)

cheers - e. :)

Well... I think that the mental aspects of taking E, are straight up in
your head.. YOu didn't know what to expect.. I have seen people NOT E
simply because they thought it was going to be bunk... Strange. "Man, this
sh!t is bunk! I am not going to E".. Well cheer up man.

Maybe you were E'ing. The first time I e'ed was my first ravE.. And I felt
like I was E'ing tornados.. But maybe I was just over heating. ... You,
having gone to several ravEs prior to taking E. Maybe you thought you were
just over heating like normal.

And then agian.. First time I took Acid, I didn't fry.
I am sure your eye's will start rolling next time.

Your not alone Tracy...  I had fun too at EHT.. Not much was getting to me.
Except maybe some of my inhabilities. And it was pretty depressing to see
Samona(sp) ignoring me.. We were on such better terms last time I saw her.
It's like, she either heard some bull-shit rumor about me. Or she just
wanted to look cool infront of "everyone" by dissing the STUFF. Oh well...
No loss over here.  =]:..
But the music did seem to lag.. Sometimes, it started sounding hell of
hyper, and before even I realized it, it was back to some kinna mellow weak
sounding stuff. Alot of unwelcomed ambient breaks...Didn't go over to well
with House & Break-Beat. And the Crystal Method, now I know why Technics
put tempo control on there tables. They were TO SLOW...... Putt, putt.. 


E sucks though.

Dancing tell 4:30AM is not healthy anyways.
 4:30AM is when your suppost to be sleeping. Unless you work the
grave-yard shift, Snake Juice is your only alternative.
 The only thing capable of giving me a second wind is interest in the
music, and sweat. Because at four in the morning, my body has already
built a tolorance to all magic potions.
 And, If I am not interested in what I am hearing, my dancing won't be
interesting either. By the way..

 So does this mean that...If you dance compulsively at a ravE, your
immature? Seems like a perfectly normal thing to do for everyone,,, besides
myself.
 
I am only relaxed -at the ravE- WHEN I am dancing.
And it's quite u4ic..

	Did you know that all of those kind of pinkish fruit juices
(like pink graprefruit, Mui Laui, Guava drinks, etc) are colored that
way with the guts of insects? Take a look at the label of any food in
question and look for "carmine", "carmine extract", or "natural and
artificial colors including carmine". It is required to be listed if
the food contains it, and carmine is extracted from a certain species
of insect that lives off of leaves. They basically scrape them off the
leaf and grind them up.

	Brings new meaning to the word "bug juice"...

Wrong...

 She was tearing it up through the end of her set...
 Incase you didn't notice Sir, she was getting completely distracted by about 20
fools lined up around her tables. Smoking in her face.. I mean, people were totally
pushed up against the tables like stoners in the front of the stage at a Slayer
concert. If you were to have went up front to try and see what she looked like...You
would of seen that she was way buggin out on the people hanging so close to the
tables asking questions, and straight up not even giving her elbow room.
 Yes.. I believe she deliberately busted out with some "Wimpy" jungle at first to
clear the place out alittle bit. Cause she played some tight soundin jungle later
on. And yea, she stopped once, and she also spun the record back a couple of
times. But she was getting WAY interrupted. 
 I myself just wanted to dance infront of her set. But I could barely even get a
glimpse of her, with all the hard-up doods buggin her up front. Yea 20
records...Probably remixed by her.
 People were so crammed up; they were literally over the tables.

Excuse me? But that is the lamest excuse I have ever heard for why a 
DJ performed so poorly. She train wrecked the whole time I was back 
there. I came back again to give her another chance (maybe she had a 
bad mix or I caught her at a bad time) and it still sounded like two 
shoes in a dryer. Come on now, we're talking about a DJ who has been 
labeled "The First Lady of Jungle" , has been ranted and raved about, 
and has had a full page, color picture slapped in the middle of this 
month's issue of Mixmag. I figured with all the hype built up for her 
and all the recent bookings, she would at least perform a half way 
decent set. I was disappointed. She's definitely got the look, but she 
didn't show her skills (if she really has any) at the Electric Highway 
party. DJs are paid to make a public performance. If she can't handle 
the public whom she is paid to perform for, then she needs to learn 
to. It's just my personal opinion.

Hey everybody.

I thought dj rap did really well considering how much sound was bleeding 
over from the main stage... it seemed pretty apparent that she was having 
trouble with her monitor/headphone levels.

I thoroughly enjoyed her set, and danced my booty off.

hey sweets, 

first off, you are NOT an idiot for not knowing what an amino acid is...i
had to take several science classes before i figured out what they hell
they are:)....ok, an amino acid is the building block for all kinds of
proteins, whether they are found in plants or animals. proteins serve SO
many functions i won't even go into it, but just to name a few: serve
structural roles in the body (muscles, chromosomes), are enzymes (speed up
chemical reactions in the body). the actual chemical make-up of an amino
acid is nitrogen and hydrogen (and i think some oxygen but i'm not too
sure).
so don't feel disgusted or anything, amino acids are EvErYwhERe.....and
good for you:)
take care dears. 

con amor y paz
priscilla

Ack!  Enough already.

So she had a bad day.  And so has every other well known/unknown dj I know
of.  Deal with it.  
Dj Rap kicks ass as far as her own producing goes.  As far as djing, well
I'm not sure cause I
have never seen her, but I do know one thing; I wouldn't want a bunch of
"boys" goo-goo eyed and slobbering on the decks if I were her.  

It doesn't matter if your a well known dj or not.  Having people hovering
over the decks would get me claustrophobic and very uncomfortable.  You
don't know anything about how that person felt that day.  What happened to
them or how tired they are.  What if she just didn't get any vibe from the
whole production, but she had to play any way, right!?  

I'm sorry but a dj is not always going to be on it.  It happens.

My 2 cents, take it as you will.

Siphon

> OH, but I did get to have a lil fun at people's park for about an hour or

I got to do the sound for this, and honestly, I had so much fun!!!!

Hella props to Roman and crew for a job well done.  I saw a ton of people
i haven't seen in forever, and enjoyed a great day dancing, playing around
on the grass, socializin, and just generally enjoying life on a Sunday.

I didn't get names for all the DJ's, but I heard great stuff from
everybody.  Bonnie and Ethan tore shit up, and Roman did a great job
bringing the energy back down enough so people could go home without
trying to grind into their upholstery (which was a threat after Ethan's
hella fun, slower than usual set that had people freakin the speakers,
including a couple of the residents of the park).  The other DJs were
rippin shtuff up, heard some jungle I haven't heard in a while, as well as
some tasty LA-UG style breakbeat and some tasty housier stuff.  Hell
yeah... good to hear a party that played some serious slower stuff as a
general rule.  Good, mellow, afternoon vibe music...

High point of the party was sitting down with this guy who has been living
in the park for a couple years, and talking about unity and
positive progress.  I'm still blown away when some people just "get it"
right away, and see us for our intentions, not our differences.  Right
on...

Special thankyous to Carrie for transpo and the mobile martini laboratory,
Jonathan for getting me that tape, and Ethan for saving my butt with his
big ole amp rack.

Peace,
AndyW

now back into my previously promised self imposed silence... bad andy...

Isn't the RAVE-0-LUTION just a bunch a pre-fab drum samples? You can't
like, add any new sounds right?

Anyone selling a vintage 303 this week?


I don't know though. RAVE-0-LUTION is a silly name for an instrument. Why
don't they just sell things like this at Toy's R US or something? I don't
get it.

First things first, I wasn't at the m0f0 Electric Buttsnut concert.  I am
way happier to support Rap, VSF, and FTT all at the same time in
surroundings that have proven in the past to be enjoyable for ME.

In the second, place, so far I have seen several junglists whose opinions
I respect naysay Miss Neves' opinion, so I thought I would put my word in.

>From what I understand, DJ Rap is a sort of shy person.  Yes, she is
confident in her looks, her production skills, her mixing, etc.  After
all, she has been a huge success in the UK and the Continent as a DJ *and*
a producer.

None of which changes that fact that several people I'm friends with who
have met her, and gottten to know her through the UK/East Coast jungle
mashup all say that while she is a bouncy happy person when among friends,
she is initially quite a shy person.

And if she had a legion of groupies, and crap sound, and like no one
showing their appreciation for anything but the face and the body...I
would imagine circumstances would be sort of negatively affecting her
mixing, etc.

Also, I have found that certain types of women are quite against
everything about DJ Rap, whereas certain types respect her production but
think she's just a whorish girl who gets gigs because she dresses in
ALLURING FASHIONS.

Also, there is the word PLAYAHATER.

DUH,

I like the ideas that Massives have.  Gathering thousands of ravers together
for a huge celebration.  Bringing out lots of fun things to do that give
people a chance to have lots of fun if they don't quite feel like dancing.  I
think that's all great.  The problem is, the community (not just our scene)
it's ready for it.  Since raving has so far to go to be publicly accepted and
UNDERSTOOD, there is almost no chance of a real massive to go off anything
like a smaller party.  The vibe CAN'T be there because too many people don't
know why they are there.  Too many people go for the wrong reasons to the
massives.  Unlike the smaller parties where we know why we're there and
everyone shares in the experience.  Until the majority of the people going to
massives understand, then no massive will truley "go off".   

That is, IMHO.  :o)

 You got me at a really bad time..
 Didn't I already say SHUT THE FUXK UP to this reply of yours? Even before
you fucking sent it?
 You know, I am so fuxking sick of women. You all want a man. And that man
DON'T FUXKING LOOK LIKE ME... I just wish all of you would do me a favor
and, stop trying to jock me at the raves!! Because if I wasn't dancing, I
wouldn't even get a second look from most of you.

  
Jeff
There is a reason for my outburst though. It's like everytime I actually
open up to some lady, I get to hear about how skinny I am, or how quiet I
am.. So fuck yall.. And NO that don't mean I am going to be a fag. Hell no.

Anyways. Bad timing on your side.

It was pretty cool.  But when you were blunt headed and starting to
hallucinate on certain chemical, one finds it difficult just to buy the
fucking ticket and make it inside the party.  ;o)  

Dude, Byron, I was really startin' to trip at the ticket counter.

For those of you who were asking me what I meant by mentioning the birth
of a new crew, this last quote has kinda to do with it.

That was actually weird but better for me becaus i need at least a foot
radius when I'm under a certain influence and dancing at the same time. 
But it's very true, when there are not too many people dancing, the
feeling isn't quite there.

Ohhh man, not I.  I was dancing my ass of to Eat Static.  They were so
fucking awesome, I couldn't believe it.  Good party overall.  I'm usually
not the massive type but I have to give some props for it.  True though,
so badly that place needed a chill room.

Hope you all have a good evening, day, or whatever.

I don''t think that everyone should diss ALL massives. Some parties suck and
some are incredible. Variety is the key. It all depends on the mix of music,
people, vibe etc, ( pick yer order ). I think that if you wanted a massive to
be fun, it would be, as long as you and those around you contribute. If you
go to a party with a set mentality of "this is going to suck" it probably
will. I'm not saying that you should have happiness popping outta every
orifice of yer body, ( although it would be kinda nice ) but you should
always go with an open mind. That way, your mind is free to change, and
hopefully please.

To me, Lifeforce looks to have a stellar lineup, and hopefully draw a stellar
crowd. Cyberfest looks huuuuuuuuggggggggeeee and rides @ a rave seem like a
very interesting concept. I think that it would be so wunderful if all 30
acres of that could be completely immersed in an awesome vibe. Small parties
with intimate vibes are so much fun, and you get to bond with people, but at
the same time, a rilly good massive gets hundreds, maybe even thousands of
people to shake their booties all nite long, with a wide grin etched on their
face, along with other evidence of happiness and good feeling. THAT is the
goal of the real massive. It can only be achieved if we ALL contributed,
instead of bitching the entire time. WE can control the party TOGETHER.

'Till then.
Spread some vibe...
Keep it alive...

It bothers me , too.  Anyone else?  I like having a clear line of site and
energy between my groovin' ass and the dj.  Sure, they've a right to be
there, but they put a damper on the vibe, 'specially if all they do is
stand there with cold faces.  Parties are SO much better when
we're all participating and contributing.  Don't 'cha think?  

I've made it a personal challenge to try to elicit some energy in the
watchers by throwing some of my own at them.  Sometimes I get some butt
waggles and head grooves, and other times I get cold hard stare downs.  Ya
win some, and ya win some(i tried didn't I?)  When I'm feeling especially
naughty I jump right into the midst of the stone crowd and bust out a
multi-directional special; rainbows of skittles, fountains of chocolate,
candied jewelry, ear to ear grins, and a little bit of teasing too.
Bedlam.  Please join us in the dancer's outreach program to reach out and
funkify someone.

And here's my more practical, Libra, let's please everybody idea for those
wannabe DJ's who like to watch other DJ's spin so they can learn or
criticize; pipe a video feed into another area where people can watch the
DJ's handiwork on tv.  They can have their own little DJ vibe going, and
discuss amongst themselves the finer nuances of the art.

We can all be happy..

I have to agree with Phoenix about why massives usually are stinky in
terms of vibage.   I went to an outdoor massive in Am'dam this
summer called Dance Valley and they're community was incredibly united.
They are one BIG happy family over there.  One of these days I'll post a
little report on it.  But it was all about love, family, and having
fun.  I felt oh so good being accepted and loved in Holland.  Oh, to have
my very own Dutch girl to ogle and faun over.

hey folks

i just moved here about 2 months ago, and decided that i should introduce
myself finally :)

i go by dsp among the continuum... some people call me garrett ;-) I live
in the Ho CHi mIn district of Santa Clara.  I hate silicon valley but i
really like hanging out in santa cruz and san francisco and adventuring in
northern california.

Im from northern Vermont/New Hampshire, grew up with NEAU/NEW, ive been
one of the ne-raves cult for 4 years, i dj free parties and house parties
and sick cheap underground gigs, im a vegetarian, i really like techno
music like deep minimal sometimes overwhelming stuff (not that boring
shite and not that melodic lala stuff with no oomph or jam to it) i also
like deep house if it has oomph and it jams... if it goes Bap tsss Bap
tsss Bap tss for 8 hours i become disturbed.

im curious about warehouse kinda parties in san francisco... im really out
of that loop 100%... the city loop.  im not talking about the $35 empty
warehouse with two speakers that dont work and lots of candy things like
booths and massage parlors and big name wankers... but the ones i read
about in your papers that "slam" ;-) and the ones with "weird" music ;-)
For some odd reason Ive been very successful getting the 411 for free
parties :) truth ruled :) 

Some random facts about dsp:

Favorite Djs: Richie Hawtin (+8), Prozac (DiskoB), Pixie (Spiraltribe),
Function (downwards), Neil Landstrumm (peacefrog...)
Favorite Live Sets: Regis (downwards), Raoul Delgado (sheep)
Favorite Record Labels: DiskoB!, Drumcode, ABsense, Auk, Primate,
Subsounds, Future Frontier
Favorite place in the world: New Mexico
2nd favorite place in the world: Williamsburg bridge in brooklyn at dawn
Favorite food: Burritos
Favorite time of day: 6am
Most exciting thing i did this weekend... saw deer jumping OVER the road
on highway 1 at 6am over a cliff and straight down at the ocean :-)
Favorite Party ever: Minimal (+8) Toronto Ca, 96
2nd Favorite Party ever: the "cocacola party" (n.e.w.) Manchester NH 95

Im going to "Diet for the Sick" it should be toootally awesome :)
Definitely get a ticket sooon! time to go MENTAL!!! hehehehehehehheheheheh
word. Richie Hawtin in the U.S.!! I saw him two years ago in montreal,
best house set ive ever heard (he went on at 5am and the whole place was
going MAD) and at Minimal in Toronto a year ago... the sickest most
twisted party ive ever been to... totally totally worth the $10CA
heheheheheh bigger sound better setup best music than any party ive ever
been to :)  (and richie was spinning the hard shite)

do you guys have pre-partys and net meets and stuff for people like me to
say hello? 

i want to go grocery shopping with vegans too, like i want to be a vegan
but i dont know what to cook and what to buy.  and i hear there are some
vXe people here that listen to crazy music ;-)

pk

I think crowd around the DJ can be kinda fun, myself.  Down here in SoCal 
everyone dances toward the speakers (I mean like right on top of the 
speakers, face to the grill, no lookin back!).  You're spinning your 
rekkids and you look up and there... NO ONE!  It's really kinda odd to 
look out and not see anyone there and to have to crane your head out and 
around the decks to see if kids are hugging the speakers or not. If the 
people in front of you are grooving, it's all good (as long as the floor 
isn't weak or something).  When they're just standing there, arms folded, 
baseball caps down past the brow staring at the mixer and the decks, it 
kinda puts the pressure on.  It's as if they're saying, "Okay, let's see 
some scratchin' or somethin'!"  That's when I start getting kinda scared 
'cause my scratchin sounds kinda wiggity wiggity wiggity wack if you know 
what I mean. :D  And when you throw out some stupid (and I dont' mean 
stoopid fresh) scratch and the kids watching so intently all of a sudden 
make that hissing noise and just turn away shaking their heads like 
you're a foolio, it's kinda depressing :D

Taurine doesn't get you wired, it calms you down!!! (it's very slightly

It is one of the cheapest amino acids....by weight.

I like the reference to bulls, though..

Fits in with the long tradition of such things..

Please, oh please, oh please if anyone is going to Love this Friday, do
you have room in your car for the TRIP BACK to San Jose for me and my
very small ity bitty friend Ashton? Our ride is going back way early and
we would like to be able to stay longer. If anyone is going back to San
Jose area (Cupertino, right by Vallco Mall) page me or email me. I would
appreciate it very much. Ashton is small and he doesn't take up much
room. He can be folded easily and slid under the seat if necessary.

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

	No, it's a lot closer to being a synth than a sampler. It's
more like an 808/909 combined with a 303 than it is like a sample-
based drum machine.

> I don't know though. RAVE-0-LUTION is a silly name for an instrument.

	Easy to remember, though.

I was just going to send this to George Porgie. But because of how it came out when I was writing
it to this individual person George, I have decided to share it with anyone interested in deep mind
transfer  =]:..
 
 For starters. George sounds like he completely knows what I am going through at the ravEs.
 I was not intending to give off a disrespectful vibe. I have to assume you are talking about my
French, my dirty mouth. But you ever hear the way Woopy Goldberg says the F word? She says it in a
way that is NOT disrespectful.. And I honestly believe this is one of the things that made her so
interesting when she started out.
 But I am not trying to insult no one in my post. I may have yelled alittle,  but most great
leaders could pipe down alittle more in their speeches too. Perhaps, you could have seen it as me
be-littling another person.. But I wasn't trying to get any points like that across.
 It's like someone standing up and saying "F&%K EVERYBODY!!"  This right here can definitely be
taking as disrespectful. But I am sure you could think of many instances in your life..where this
was more of a turning point..Maybe even a way of telling everyone you love them.. It has been used
in so many different ways, I am sure.
 You know what I am saying? If we were all standing around in a group, and I got up and said the
same thing I said in that post.. You would of known by the look on my face that I was not being
disrespectful..

 And asfar as being shy -n- all that.. You see things through my eyes pretty clearly. But it's
worse for me, much worse.. I trip off more things. For one, I need to quit smoking pot. I don't buy
it on weekdays but. I have other problems. I have some kind of inability,  that makes it hard for
me to concentrate on any one thing at a time. Like I need LOTS of input all at once to be at peace.
And if I don't get all the input I am unwillingly craving for. Most of the time I will fade out of
the present and start thinking about past experiences.
 Somebody will spark a memory in my mind, and I will just take a trip back into my thoughts, relive
them and ANALyze them. I usually don't give it much thought, but it is also very hard to think my
way out of the vision.. Like I am stuck in my past, but the present is still ticking. Sometimes
even literally making me appear for an instance, to be completely spaced out. 
 And if you think this is a problem. When I am at the raves, if this happens I usually don't even
remember what it was I was thinking about, until maybe the next day..at which time I will also know
what happened around me in the present, during my spaced-out voyage to the past. Which is in it's
self is another space-out voyage to the past. Shew, this is deep sh!t..
 
Now, lets go back to the ravE situation. Call it the past, call it the present.
 This inability I have will make me come across like I am thinking something, but when you snap me
out of it, my mind goes BLANK. You ask me "What were you thinking about?" and I will have no
rational answer for you.
 Techno music and the ravE scene particularly. When I get into an enviorment that dark, yet
completely colorful. I am totally showered with beautiful input.. After my first ravE, I knew this
was my new vacation location. And I need a vacation atleast once a week.
 When I first started raving, the first ravE and up.. No one wanted to talk to me. Everyone was
just doing there thing, having fun like they so much deserve now for being alive. But I was just
getting in the way or interrupting. I would be thinking feeling, and sharing my feeling with whom
ever was in hearing range.but looked at like "huh? be gone little one".
 Yes, people (candy ravErs) would come up and introduce themselves to me and my friends, want to
hug, and basically preach the meaning of love with there joy for being alive. But they were just
playing the part, because if I didn't play along I was rejected.
 Example: I can't stand the feeling of lotion on my already smooth hands. To me it is just terrible
mixed with a dirty ravE and hotter temperatures. It actually makes my body feel like it is lacking
oxygen for some reason. When I would kindly & peacefully "sincerely!" say no thank you when offered
lotion.. I was immediately past off as not interested. Not playing the part.
 So after awhile of feeling like a was completely alone, in my way of thinking. I started leaning
more towards the biggest sounds and input left for me to enjoy at the ravEs..The music.. 
 Then one night, while raving with my friend Luciana. It all changed. For starters, Luciana my
friend and practically family to one of my best friends, came onto me. She is beautiful. One second
I am thinking...I don't know what I was thinking, completely dumbfounded. The next second I am
thinking Tim, one of my best friends got mad at me the day I asked Luciana for her phone number.
And now she is rubbing up against me like a kittin around a warm leg.
 On the third second she asked me something. I thought I heard "Jeff, can you show me a good time"
But I had to be sure with something like this, being it was such an out of reality thing for her to
be saying.. Especially for someone I had barely known at the time for over a year. A girl that
liked my other friends, not me. And would always talk about how her man needs to be tall, buff, and
Harvard grad.
 So on the fourth second I said "what?" And on the fifth second, by the hesitation in her
appearance, she instantly either feared rejection, or thought I was disappointed. So she did not
repeat herself and quickly turned away.
 Now if this wasn't a ravE where things are going alittle faster than normal. My initial response
might not of been what, maybe something like a great big smile and a "did you say what I think you
said?" instead. Luciana is a beautiful lady.
 After awhile that night, she found someone else. She brought him over to me and said with a very
happy smile "see Jeff, this is my kind of man".. I was happy for her. After we all hung out for
awhile they decided they wanted to go chill alone for awhile. So I wondered off on my own journeE..
 I end up spotting this girl. She had lights around her waist..one flashing bike light attached to
each belt buckle. I went up to her and told her how much I liked the way the lights seemed like
just one circling around her hips. Not premeditated. Probably thanks to her, we end up really
hitting it off after that.
 But then. One of her friends came up to her and whispered something to her, something later on I
thought sounded like "you better hurry up if you like this guy" While there whispering, I get
distracted by all the imput now taking place over hers. And I find out I have a four girl (plus)
audience standing around behind me. All totally beautiful, saying things like "what does she have
that I don't have?" I turn around to my newly found friend and she asks me where the chill room is
located. I respond, she asks me if I want to go check it out. What do I say? No.... }:\ Damnit!! I
was getting to much attention now!! What happened!!?!?!??
 I now have a half dozen more stimulating instances going on around me. It all happened so fast.
Girls saying things like "he is making me hungry",, or I think it was I am dancing, this is
happening, this is unreal and totally flattering. The night ends, I go home with the upmost
confidence in my self-being.
 I then went to my next ravE, FUSION. Where I got up and danced again. In hope, the monster would
come back out of the closet once again. And it did!,!,,,something fearce. In my mind it seemed like
every single girl was enjoying my dancing. So what do I do? I fucking danced non-stop, without
skipping the beat for six hours....
 Around the end of the night is when it first started. Girls now WANT me to move on them. And as
you can so clearly see yourself, the shyness was thick. There not having fun now mind you, they now
just want me to move in..
 Oh yea and, that night was the first night I wasn't IGNORED by the male population at the ravEs.
But did they want to meet me? No! They just wanted to walk around me and say things like "live it
up me" and they were not happy. They gave off more of a "dick" vibe.. Like they were jealous, but
at the time seemed to me as straight up disrespect and disbelief... Infact the only person that
came up to me and gave me props was one of the promoters. He came up to me and either said "the
whole world is watching you, keep it up" or it was "All the girls are watching you, keep it up" and
he made me very happy. He was cool..
 Multiply all my inabilities, enhanced fully by E usage. Trying to conquer my shyness, my
quietness, and inability to concentrate when happy input unfolds..
 Then you got me, here, a year later...

 You know. I never held a grudge to anything. All I have been doing is trying to correct myself,
while being attacked, pressured, and misunderstood. 

 I would also like to share another mistake, mistakin thing that happened to me not so long ago,
during a time when I was coming down, and at the time I was most SNAPPED out on what is happening
to me.
 I was at a friends house after a ravE, there were a lot of ravErs there I had never seen, but all
seemed to know me as someone they DID NOT want to be friendly with.  And the stupidest thing
happened. A bunch of people were in the room..Then they all got up a went to burn or something,
except for one. He stayed in there while I was mixing. I stopped, then he said something to me like
"I remember you when you first started raving. You know it's cool your all dancing and having a
good time with your friends. But sometimes you need to give alittle back"
 I don't know what I was feeling. I know that, that was the last time I took E because I was so
twisted up. I ended up saying "you know, I have problems. I don't want to be no roll model. And the
girls there are to young for me anyways" It was so stupid for me to say that, for I do not really
feel this way. He quickly got off the subject. The next day I was like, "oh my god, what did I say
that?"
 And you know what? I believe that story is getting dragged around the ravEs too. 
 That day he seemed to not be takin by my words. But shortly after that day, all of the people he
hangs out with completely started HATING me. I mean total disrespect. This is a shit happens
situation, and no one seems to want me to answer for it..
 I just It really sucks all the messed up shit I have gone through this past year..

 But I have to cut this off somewhere...
I hope no one gets the wrong impression..

Nice chatting with yea. If you got this far..Goto bed!!!

I thought you guys would enjoy these... haha.

Ten Reasons why "Scooby Doo" was a Drug-influenced Cartoon: 

1.Scooby and Shaggy were always being freaked out by ghosts and ghouls,
but no one
else saw them before Scoob and Shaggy. 
2.Scooby and Shaggy always had the munchies. 
3.Shaggy always thought Scooby was talking and was the only one who could
hear him
and understand him. 
4.Scooby and Shaggy always fell into the trap that was intended for the
monster because
they were tripping over themselves and couldn't see where they were going. 
5.They were always deluded and warped, by thinking they were dressed up in
some
costumes and entertained the monster. 
6.Shaggy always said "like" to the extreme, i.e. "like ZOIKS, Scoob, let's
get outta here!!"
What's a "zoik"? 
7.Scooby and Shaggy were always the ones in the back of the van (doing who
knows
what). 
8.They drove around in the MYSTERY MACHINE, which had that weird trippy
design
on it's side. 
9.Shaggy and Scooby were always giddy and laughing. 
10.Look at Shaggy; the way he dressed, his goatee, etc., 'nuff said.

I have found that "Screamin Energy" the official raver drink is
considered to be one of the best. It has vitamines and amino acids and
caffine to help you party on till dusk or dawn. Peace
               O R I O N






           A buddy of mine that I work with (who is from
          Amsterdam) told me that Taurine is extracted from a Bull's
          testicle. :)

I don't much care for massives so I didn't even bother with The Electric
Highway or Big Top but was I the only one from the list who went to the
after-party at Pablo's Sugar Shack? I danced my ass off to Monty, Taj, Garth,
DJ Sneak, & Doc Martin last Saturday night.  Both Sneak and Doc played two
hour sets
that finished somewhere around 7:30am Sunday with Crystal Method &
Fluke dancing right next to me! 10 hours of music, great soundsystem,
great crowd (for a club) and all for $10 = 4 star review.  Seems like
there used to be more nights like this, wish there were.

I heard that this blew the tour away and both Doc and Sneak played
much better at VSF. Everyone I talked to said the place was bumpin'.
Your right there used to be many nights like this and mornings 
anyone remember "Boogy Buffet" 8) I'm jealous.

It wasn't easy getting up this morning. ;)

Ok here goes my take on the night....

Got there pretty darn early, matter of fact an hour or so early.  So we
kicked it till it opened.  Around 10ish we walk in and it ends up being
only $5.  That was a pleasant surprise.  The place is made up nicely.  Not
very many people there at that time, but they rolled in by the minute.
They had some food trays out, that was a nice touch. 

Its seems that they only had 1 cartridge/needle when we got there so Noel
was just play'n rekerds for a while.  They ended up getting set about a
half hour after that.  Noel spun a mixture of stuff.  Some of it was on the
jazzy tip.  Nice.

Next was Miss StarEyes.  She got the ball rolling with some jump up and
some rollers.  I was talking with Flux while she was spin'n.  Right on top
of a bass bin.  Let me tell you it was loud.  Good sounding bass... Good to
see you Flux. ;)

Dj Rap was on next with her Benny and sunglasses.  She started off with an
intro "Its DJ RAP".  It was appropriate as far as I'm concerned.  She
started out with massive crazy beats that just got the crowd going
instantly.  She definitely didn't f@&k around getting the people ready to
sweat cause she didn't let off the whole time.  Towards the end she played
alot of older jump up and she even played this Jonny L (piper) remix that I
never heard before.  It was dope.  (by the way Jonny L is coming next
Monday to Ultra).  Her skills were good.  No real wrecks.  She had a couple
of rewinds.  She dropped alot of tracks in at the right times.  Some
crossfader abuse...She was on it!  She likes to move behind them decks
though!  Lots of good energy.

We left after her.  I heard a couple of mixes from Sage who was next, but
not enough to review on.  I didn't get to see Diesel Boy.  =(  Anyone want
to give a review on his set?

There were alot of heads of the industry there.  DJ Sneak, Dj Dan, DRC,
junglist left and right, and a slew of others I'm not able to conjure up at
this time. 

I got an URB magazine with a cd in it from Hypnotic.  Its got crazy techno
on it, not bad, except the cd is skipping like mad (allwell).  I also got a
Photek: Risc vs. Reward cd.  All this stuff for $5.  So thats not bad for
one night.

Other than that, take care...

Sorry for the tease guys.  But after referring to my fellow founder of
this new thing, it has been decided that the birth of it all shall be
postponed for atleast six months due to dissatisfaction with our
confidence to be able to start it off this fast.  We're going to do it at
some time later on, just not now.

Sorry for being such an ass/tease.

My roomie and I got there around seven after about five hours of public
transportation to get all the way around the bay by tram, bus. train and
boat, instead of BART.  There weren't too many people there and we just
walked straight in and sought a schedule.  I missed the post with that,
and there were about two whole copies floating around the warehouse, so we
weren't too sure who was on when or who we were seeing half the time. 
Anyways..the show... 

it started pretty slow with some mixing going on at first then M.C. 
Rymetyme and the previously mentioned "sound of the phuture..the sound of
the UK massive".  They had some great beats going off, but it just went on
a little too long (two hours at least) with the same lyric the whole time. 
I'm not a real 808 state fan, but I've only heard way old stuff.  I
actually kinda liked them live.  At this point people were starting to
fill in and and finally dance some, at least those I was around up close
to the stage. Oh yeah, those two hours of the sound of the UK were
actually mostly spent in the second area, as we really dug whoever was
spinning in the second area...either Micheal Dog or Aaron Axelson I guess. 
We both really liked System 7...they seemed to be much more in tune with
their audience and were playing well compared to many of the other live
acts who just didn't have that live thing quite down.  They warmed the
crowd up. Andre Lucero spun a great set between them and Moby. 
Unfortunately the djs inbetween live sets were often overshadowed by the
work on stage and most appeared pretty pissed at the sound checks on the
stage coming thru over their sets..understandable.  Also, most of them had
quite a bunch of people drooling over their decks, until the dancing got
going more up front.  Moby came on stage and just exploded with his Vegan
shirt and complaints about ticket prices and the change in the scene and
all that in between songs. He's an amazing performer.  He said its not too
aften anymore that he gets that feeling where he just wants to dance his
heart out from the music he's hearing these days, so he'd just have to try
to give us that feeling.  He was the main draw for my 25$ (plus the 15$
"Moby::::I like to score"  shirt)...and he deliverd with Next is the E,
Go, a couple unreleased things, and the really danceable songs of
Everything is Wrong.  I turned around a few times and it looked like the
room was pretty full at that point with a lot of dancing going on
(finally) although I too got the impression a lot of people didn't know
who he was.  We'd hoped to catch Banco de Gaia and Loop Guru on the second
stage, but don't think we really saw much of them.  Heard Joey Beltram for
a while (what a mixer!), then caught either BT or Eat Static (who was the
guy in the red pants up there going off behind his rig around three on the
main stage?) but was really running out of energy, cause I'd been up since
6am the previous day.  Around 4 I nodded off in a corner for a while and
just listened to everybody in the second room.  My roommate says Medicine
Drum was really good.  Things started tailing off in the wee hours of the
morning and we headed home.  All in all we both thought it was a pretty
good show and worth the price.  I can see how people had trouble with
their cars...it wasn't the best part of town and people parked around the
corner from the door, where the few security people we were.

Anyway..that's my thoughts on the show.

aww... man!
we were right at the door to go and check out the party... but there was a
huge line- figured it would be packed- no place to dance... and the crowd
that was on the way in seemed different than what i expected(didn't look
like the same people i had just had so much fun with at EHT)... guess i
should have given it a chance... we turned around and went to the pier66
after party- broken up in an hour!
my loss! :(

sounds like he already has...  

age should never be thought of as an unsurpassable boundary.


also sounds like Deepfrog already revels in this.

I love when you kids say silly little things like that, Bruce.  It's so cute.

Hang around a little while in the scene, OK?  Hopefully you'll meet lots of
people who become role models so you can be just like us when you grow up!

I have to admit... it would crack me up to see a 350 year old in a star trek jumper shaking his booty.

Yeah, it was a definate blast! a bachelorette party that was there. The lucky

Maybe Garth gave it up? Another top night out.....

Consumer reports rates denon consumer players amongst the lowest in
reliability, right next to radioshack and yamaha. This may or may
not matter for Denon pro decks. 

I personally hate these. I find the ergonomics of the Denon DJ players
very bad. Very hard to use. Ass-backwards anti-user interface. I always
end up hitting the wrong buttons or screwing up the controls.

Then again, maybe I'm just spastic.

>Pioneer CDJ-500II Player - list $999 x 2 = $1998

(1) You can get these Mailorder for $599 each. Try J&R Music and Computers.
See http://garbanzo.ssesco.com/nau/mailorder.htm for listings on
this and other companies.

(2) I have these. I like these. They are a significant improvement over
the Denon's in terms of ergonomics and ease of use. I think they sound
very good too.

Some people have complained that if you have super loud bass sounds
around these units they will fail to read a CD and give some kind of
error. I have found this to be a problem only when there's a monitor
speaker with lots of bass blasting straight into the CD player.  For
example, I was having this problem at Burning man on Friday evening at
the Taz soundsystem, mostly because I didn't realize that the monitor
was aimed straight into the left CD player (the right one was working
fine). This is not a normal situation because the monitor speaker was
less than 1 foot away....When I turned it down (it was also too loud
for my ears as well), it was able to track again. I would say a
turntable would have had howling feedback with a monitor speaker aimed
straight onto the vinyl. So this may or may not be a problem for you. 
This problem never happens w/ my monitor speakers at home even though
I can get them up to about 130dB (painfully loud).

Hey lara!! It's yuko!!!  I finally got the discussion list.  Doreen helped
me out with this.  I guess you've already heard about "transcend" about
two weeks ago from Dor.  I think it was supposed to be massive, but not
many showed up so it turned out to be pretty small, but I was so glad that
it was small.  I really hate massives most of the times.  It's all about
making more money, that's how I feel most of the times.  Besides you can't
share happy vibes with people at massives.  
But anyways, just wanted to say hey.

whoa. haven't seen a single virgo review yet. did everyone else end up
on the wrong side of the police cars? i'm sorry, you missed out... not
only did you miss a great party, you also didn't get to see _me_! *grin*

seriously though, it was fun. we got to daly city at 12.30 or so, found
the parking lot (outside lyon's) which served as map point. with tons
of cars with kids driving round and round, it must have looked sorta
suspicious. so i guess it didn't *really* surprise anyone when four
police cars were waiting for us as we approached the trail down to the
beach. we found kristen (kirsten?), also known as the birthday girl,
and returned to the map point to warn everyone. we did, and after sam
changed the voice mail we started looking for an alternate route down
to the beach. after a while, we did, and the hike down began. apparently
this route was a lot easier than the one people were originally told
to use. :) we got to the party at 2.something, and it was banging. the
location was beautiful, and everyone was happy and friendly! i've missed
the sf vibe all summer, but it wasn't until i started wandering around
among all the beautiful ravers that i realized just how much i've missed
you all! i saw a lot of people i haven't seen in a long time, and i met
a made a lot of new friends! much love to all of you! :)
the music spun by mars and mystr-e was pretty much right on the spot.
there's nothing that beats trance at a beach party! for me, though, the
real highlight came during the last 45 minutes. banging hard trance for
the headstrong. :) this combined with a beautiful morning put a perfect
end to a perfect party! thanks a lot sam, nick, and everyone else involved
in making this happen! :)

after a few hours of just being cracked out at christine's house, we all
went down to people in the park. couldn't really get myself in the mood
to dance, i was more in a hanging out kinda mood. and so i did. :) met
more beautiful peeps, and had a blast! the highlight here was definitely
the last hour, when we got classics like jam&spoon's "stella" and future
sound of london's "papua new guinea". yay! 
another highlight was watching all the non-raver types getting down! i 
just love it when people let go off whatever restraints they have on 
themselves, and just have a blast! :)

well, i'm off. but i hope to see you all this weekend. i don't know what's
up for friday, but i'll definitely see you all at play nice saturday! :)

much love.

jonas the spaceboy (who's back in sf)

I just re-joined the list today, so please bear with me if you have already ranted about this...

I don't know if anyone out there will actually admit to going to this party, but I was wondering what you guys thought about Dan's set...I hadn't heard him play since Freedom '96, but I thought that his set was absolutely blinding...So many quality tracks, brilliant mixing, and enough energy to blow the roof off of any party with even the toughest of crowds...I never have danced so hard in my life...Thanks to Dan, and actually Charissa (DJ Rap) for making that party happen for me....

cheers,

Shawn

is your spellchecker not working or are you just trying to make an
original joke?  if you're trying to be original, believe me, someone
else beat you to the punch line about 4 1/2 years ago.  funny?  well im
sure someone's laughing.  me?  i just breathe deeply and remember that
when people try to be funny at other people's expense, they may not
fully understand how others might take it.  

Breathe deep and remember unconditional love.  and leave the frog in
your throat.  

Good publicity for me, eh?  ;]

Alright, alright.  So I didn't think of that one too much.  But what we're
looking for is maturity.  Someone that's reliable and trustworthy.  No one

 I just called J&R - individual price is $699. Demand is up, the guy says.
But they have a package deal of two players and the Pioneer DJM-500
mixer and a coffin for $2299 ( I forgot to ask him about shipping ).

 After hearing about this from someone else, I wondered what would
happen if the players had a plate of lead or something massy attached
to them? Adds weight to the whole , but would help damp vibrations.

For those of you who have already dicussed this..Bear with me, I just re-joined the list today...		

I am curious to know what people thought about Dan's set???  I hadn't heard him play since Freedom '96, but I thought that he was absolutely brilliant...His track selection was impeccable, and his mixing was incredible....And with the exception of Charissa's (DJ Rap) set, I thought that he made going to this party worth while...

What do you think?

cheers,

shawn

What spelling errors...  What do you want from me?  Sheesh.


Boy, I guess the REALLY "funny" thing... is that my name is actually Sol, and you are the one poking fun...  believe me... I know what else S.O.L. stands for, I still didn't name myself.


On a brighter note... it also means "sun".

Hmm.. well it was $599.00 when i got 'em... while all the music stores
were charging 100's more... I think J&R wised up to the fact that they
can  charge more just like the music and pro audio stores do. The
mixer/coffin setup is a good deal, though if you want to get a cheaper
coffin, you can find one that's less rugged and fitted than the custom
anvil coffin pioneer offers -- I've seen those for about $180 instead
of $300.00...
	2 * CDJ500mkII -- 1200
	1 * DJM500     --  800
	1 * coffin     --  300	
			------
			  2300

ALso note that if you don't need all the fancy stuff in the DJM500,
pioneer also offers a new DJM300 for cheaper.

IMHO, the problem wasn't the entire unit vibrating -- it's the plastic
hinged cover of CD  deck that vibrates and passes the vibration on to
the CD. I was able to get it to track during the overloud monitor
mishap by putting my hand ontop of the hinged CD cover to keep it from
vibrating. So perhaps some heavy 1" thick foamrubber (wetsuit material)
glued to the covers might work (??). Like I said, I believe even a 1200
would have been howling with feedback under these conditions. Best
thing to do is not have your monitor firing straight into the CD deck
-- note that only the deck 12" away from the monitor had this problem;
the one a little farther away in the Pioneer CDJ coffin didn't have the
problem.

I built a sandbox for my decks at home to help dampen the vibration.  Works
great!  I got the the idea from an FAQ page off the net.

 I just called J&R - individual price is $699. Demand is up, the guy says.
But they have a package deal of two players and the Pioneer DJM-500
mixer and a coffin for $2299 ( I forgot to ask him about shipping ).

 After hearing about this from someone else, I wondered what would
happen if the players had a plate of lead or something massy attached
to them? Adds weight to the whole , but would help damp vibrations.

oh please ... all you have to do is keep your skin protected from the
sun... and a tattoo touchup after 20 years or so really helps refresh color
... at least it did for me.

And when you get tired of your piercings, just take 'em out (but if you
find yourself taking them out right away, maybe you didn't really think
about it in the first place)...

so excuse me if I take exception to your implication that old people with
tattoos and piercings are ugly and, um, nasty.  Unless you happened to have
meant that in the nicest possible way, right?

Besides, we should learn to be proud of the marks that our bodies acquire
as we age, because they tell the story of our life.  It's if you don't like
the story that they tell, then you should worry.

love, leslie

  I had my nipple pierced for about two years, (dang thing kept getting
infected) I took it out and now my nipple looks like a deflated tire.
Well, maybe not quite that bad, but you get the picture.  Also my friend has
one of those "BIG" inserts that makes a hole big enough for you to put a pinky
finger through, if he takes it out, his earlobe swings about a 2inches
from his shoulders.

BTW, Cold days just aren't the same w/o my nipple ring.

I got this a few months ago, and it's very very nice.  The mixer (which I
think retails for $899 anyways) is a superb mixer, very clean sound,
balanced outputs, separate eq's for each of 4 channels, and a slew of
on-board effects like flange, reverb, echo, and even pitch shifting, as
well as a send/receive for an outboard effects box.  It also has a BPM
counter, though like all BPM counters don't completely rely upon it :)  The
BPM counter can be combined with the adjustable timing of the effects for
some really cool sounds - ever hear flanging that cycled in time with the
beat?  Really trippy.  And the coffin is rocks, it's completely sturdy yet
the whole thing can be carried by one person, at least much more easily
than a two-1200 coffin can be carried.

My only problem now is I wish I had 4 or 5 of them for all the layering I
want to do in my ambient sets :)

Keeping them in the case, I've never had this problem; I'd be tough to
imagine a situation where the DJ couldn't address this issue if it started
happening.

 When I read about these features today on a Pioneer web site, I 
immediatley started lusting for this mixer! I think the synced effects 
timing is going to be the feature that decides the whole idea of buying 
my first DJ gear.

 CD players before turntables - I wonder who's done that route ?  :-}

Yes, another bsp...

I've completed a new mixtape ready for distribution and thought I'd give
you all the lowdown...

The music on this tape ranges from hard, distorted, monotonous techno, to
smooth, slower house-influenced techno, to just plain weird stuff.  Some of
the labels featured are Fax, A13, Missile, Algorithme, E-com, Ideal, Grow,
Svek, Playground, Tag, Primitive Urges, Subhead and a bunch more.  The tape
is called "Hieroglyphics", it's 90 minutes long and comes in a fancy blue
plastic shell.

The prices are the same as my last tape: $5 in person or $7 mail order.
For mail order, all you need to do is email me with your address and I will
send you a tape with a self-addressed stamped envelope ready for you to
drop in the mail.  The best place to meet me in person is Static, tuesday
nights at Liquid in SF (see the URL in my sig for more info).  I may also
have some available at Drop Beat in Oakland.  

So... if you're interested, let me know!

Thanks for your time,
Seth

I want you to either spell my name correctly or take responsibility for

that's possible?

you did write:

not me.  if you don't want me to slam you, then call me by the right name.
I don't expect perfection from you (or anyone), but i don't like being
called the wrong name, and if i catch someone, their ass is gonna hear
about it!  End of story.

hiya,

i know this is sort of late now, but what the heck...i rarely write party
reviews.  i'll try to keep this short and possibly constructive.

MUSIC

big top had a lot of potential with all that talent there...there were
definitely moments of musical brilliance, however they were oftened
squelched by the

        a) way too short sets

[ok, let this east coaster try to get the lingo right, 'hella short' :) ]

i mean kevin saunderson gets 30 minutes? i'm sure that at most parties he
would get 2 hours.  30 minutes isn't really long enough for any kind of
'journey'.

an idea:  all sets at least 1 hr, staggered every half hour between the two
main rooms.

        b) people always setting up behind the dj

yeah, i guess not much may be done about this, but its really distracting
for both the dancers and i'm sure the djs/performers

SPACE

the size of this piece of real estate really tends to spread the party thin

VIBE

well, i wasn't expecting all that much, though i always walk in
hopeful...it was definitely best in the chill out room.  when talking to
random people got a mixture of good vibes and "like, why the hell are you
talking to me?"

MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT BIG TOP

see, i'm not all bah humbug. :)

SYSTEM 7:  their 57 varieties of acid got me dancing
ANDRE LUCERO:  entertaining breakbeak set even got my shy friend to try her
'liquid' moves :) some things he did made me laugh, in a good way!
BEYOND RACE:    to set the vibe for their chilled out set, they had these
two women walk around the room, the first carried this big flaming staff
and the second followed behind with burning sage.

peace,

basically i was flabbergasted (c'mon, you gotta love that word) that my car
wasn't broken into at bigtop like it was outside of smiles II. i got to
thinking (uh oh)...

since the locks on my car are a total joke, i mean, every time i lock my
keys in there it takes a big 10 seconds with a coat hanger to unlock the
door, maybe it would be better to just leave the doors unlocked in the
hopes that if someone wants to get in, they won't break the window.  (with
an attempt not to leave anything worthwhile in the car implied)

i don't know...i guess it's a sad state of affairs when you're considering
just 'giving in' to the criminals.

One of the promoters that has quite a bit to do with the 85th street

know, either directly or indirectly, whos cars may have been broken into 
during any of the last few parties.

If this pertains to you, please e-mail me privately.

Absolutely.  


I had no intention of mispelling your name (spellchecker didn't catch it by the way), I had an apparent brief period of unobservance which offended someone I did not know or bear any ill will.  I apologize for the misspelling, it *was* a mistake, certainly not meant as a joke (hadn't even occured to me as funny in the slightest).


On another note:

###

not me.  if you don't want me to slam you, then call me by the right name.

I don't expect perfection from you (or anyone), but i don't like being

called the wrong name, and if i catch someone, their ass is gonna hear

about it!  End of story.

###

This sounds to me like some pent up aggression.  Is it really worth getting worked up over *anything*?  Why spend time being uptight...  everything is just going to happen, or it already did.  This could have been a lot less aggravating to you if you had just said... "hey... it's Deepfog, not frog."  I would have apologized immediately, and that would have been the end of it.


Got this from Leslie right before your email:

###

by the way...

 bet someone (maybe Deepfog/Tony) already told you ... but his obtuse

spellcheck reference was really because you called him Deepfrog instead of

Deepfog.  I think!

###


No one had.  Peace man.


oh, hey Deepfog, one of these times I will remember to only send out the one copy so the list, so you don't get two of the same mail. I would of sent this one only to you, but since you posted to the list, I had to apologize openly...  no hard feelings brother.

Hi All!

Since age came up recently, here's something only a few of
us (including me!) may relate to (hi Leslie! hi Larry! ;) ).
(I can imagine lots of blank faces out there, like, so what?).

Hugs,

- Martin

------------------------------------------------------------------


Are you feeling old?  If not, consider this:
     
The people who are starting college this fall across the nation 
were born in 1980.
     
The Iranian hostage crisis occurred before they were conceived.     
     
They have no memory of a time before M-TV.
     
"New Wave" is their PARENTS musical generation.
     
Cyndi Lauper, Boy George, the Pretenders, the Kinks, the Sex Pistols -- 
are all old music they have heard of, if they have heard of it at all.
     
They have no meaningful recollection of the Reagan era.
     
They were prepubescent when the Persian Gulf War was waged.
     
If they have heard the name "Oliver North," it was probably as a losing 
Congressional candidate, or perhaps in some obscure survey history text's 
reference, such as might be made to Huey Long or Teapot Dome.
     
Black Monday 1987 is as significant to them as the Great Depression.
     
Their world has always included AIDS.
     
Having not lived through the Disco Scare, they can romanticize the 1970s.
     
They see "Family Ties" as something middle aged ladies watch.     
     
They watched "Star Wars" years ago, when they were kids -- on video.
     
Atari predates them, as do vinyl albums and cassette audiotapes; they may 
have heard of an 8-track, but probably never actually seen (or heard) one.
     
>From their earliest years, a camera was something you used once and 
threw away.
     
As far as they know, stamps have always cost about 32 cents.
     
The oil crisis is history of which they probably know nothing -- and why 
anyone WOULDN'T buy a Suburban is beyond them.
     
Most of them have probably never seen a real nun, even if they went to 
Catholic schools.

you did write:

not me.  if you don't want me to slam you, then call me by the right name.

###


someone said "Live long and Prosper"...  when you were saying you were 350 years old, and got here on a star trek voyager teleporter that was of questionable reliability.

My response was:


"sounds like he already has...  

age should never be thought of as an unsurpassable boundary."

	{}{ lived long and prospered, is what you already had }{}


"also sounds like Deepfrog already revels in this."

	{}{ reveled in that age is not an unsurpassable boundary }{}


We *really* got off on the wrong foot Deepfog.

Before eMpTV?  I'm 22 next Tues, and I remember when there was like 
maybe one person in a 4 mile radius who actually HAD cable.  Now it 
seems the other way around....
It was a sad day when I mentioned Cindi Lauper and just got blank looks.

what with cdrom burners getting cheaper by the minute, i have a
feeling that cd's will soon be the medium of choice for the really
underground artists.   pretty soon consumers will be able to create
cool tracks using pc programs like rebirth, mix them to their hard
drive, then burn copies onto cd's in the comfort of their own homes.

I have some good news for everyone. The first one of these statements below
is actually wrong. The people who are starting college this fall across the
nation were born in 1979, not 1980. It takes some very rudimentary math to
figure this out, so this may be a sign of extreme paranoia on the part of
the author. But at least that means we have another year before we have to
see this again and actually feel old. So let's make it a good one.

	I think this would be SO cool.

	1) I have a hard time finding stuff that is fast enough
	   for my tastes here in SF
	2) I am not into really funky beat tracks with lots of
	   breaks, etc. and only care for 3 or 4 beat patterns
	   and like them to just go and go and go like like
	   a metronome, or to accent a certain part of the mix
	   or add a "chorus" I like the beat to go even faster,
	   say 1/3rd or so. Like, str8 4/4 beat at 180bpm the
	   whole 7 or 8 minutes, but with occasional 220bpm
	   blitzes inserted
	3) I really like what is considered in the states "cheese"
	   and the Rotterdam style gabber with sped-up female vocal
	   tracks from other dance/pop songs.

	So I think that would be way cool to have enough HD space and
a good sampler to grab each of the parts I want, the default drum
patches for the beat track, and then mix in a harsh acid track where
apropriate over that... Sigh... dreaming.

	Marisa

Yeah, and I think it's possible for an 8 year old to have meaningful
thoughts, much less a 17-19 year old to recall Ronald Reagan, God rest his
soul.

Not only burners, but erasables are also out now and the price is
dropping fast. Anyone had a chance to check them out? Who needs tapes?

    Ahh yes, but would these 17-19 year olds also recall that he's still

Greetingz...
I've finally decided after a month here to make my SF nightscene debut 
with the tasty prospect of a six hour set from Mr Ritchie Hawtin this 
Friday at the onetrackmind party, so anyone wanting to meet up or summink 
givuzashout, or have a look on:
http://www.kult.demon.co.uk/kult2.htm
For a piccy of me. Innit, fellah.
I'll also be at Sunset on Sunday. Be good to see some of you this 
weekend and have a bit of a comradely tekkno knees up kindathing. After a 
montha of peace and solitude in this laid-back Californian atmosphere I'm 
really up for some hectic mindbending beats.
Overnout
C@weasel.

Quick clarification for those who heard the last Slow Roasted of the
summer was last week:

"Slow Roasted" is taking a couple weeks off, but there will still be a
weekly there with a different sound system put together by some different,
equally charming people (Hi Ben and crew!).  Alex and I should be back
sometime soon with some ideas we've been working on to keep the Slow 
Roasted format fresh...

I believe this new weekly is called Delicious Beats, but I've only heard
it through the grapevine. I don't know, I'm a tad confused, but please
come by and check out DA FOG rolling into Santa Clara.  Deepfog plays 
some choice stuff so if you haven't had a chance to hear him, c'mon down.

LoveUnity,
AndyW

I'll say!  Does any remember 'Fraggle Rock'?  Does that air anywhere these 
days?  I remember that was my fav tv program of the day.  Watching that and 
trying to out do my friends with how many times you could see Star Wars on 
cable in one month occupied most of my 'play time' :-)  anyone wanna play?

I think saw S.W. 25 times or so in one month before our free 'trial' month 
of cable was over!  (and so were my cable days)

shrink to little glass trinkets when you baked them in the oven? and
that colored sand they used to sell that you could make shit with
underwater?

by the way.... do you remember the episode of that show where some store
was selling skin tight shirts or something, but really they were some
kinda mind control shit? my memory's getting fuzzy now....

I don't think we should disregard this!  This a Great idea.  I would be 
able to make a site with everyones pictures and profiles on it, but it 
would be on the Geocities Server and (IMO) it should be on the Hyperreal 
Server.  So the question is...who here has access to create a web site 
on Hyperreal?  This would be so Bomb..so c'mon..

Josh "E" Josh

-------------------------------
Dear my family,

Here's an idea that I have just thought of.  How about each one of us 
somehow getting a picture or two of him/herself in computer formats such 
as bitmap, JPEG, or whatever and send them out to whoever is curious to 
know the face behind the personality.  I have been wanting to meet some 
of you personally at raves but, but, and but.  Believe it, I would much 
rather meet some of you in person but I have been busy lately.  So how 
about it my family?  

Yours truly,
Hai

Hi again!

Jus' thought some of you might be interested to know that there's
a review of last weekend's Big Top in today's SJ Mercury News(!).
Back page of the "Life" section. Quite positive!

So this is what it's coming to....

Hey everybody.

I need to sell my Numark dm1800x dj mixer. Pro Sound and Stage is selling 
for $449.99 new, mine is about six months old. I'll sell for $230. (It's a 
four channel, 19-inch dj mixer with eq on each channel, an effects loop 
and lots of other features. It sounds really clean)

I'm also selling my turntable coffin, which has a 19-inch rack (perfect 
for, say, a numark dm1800x mixer) and room for two 1200s. I bought six 
months ago for about $200. I'll sell for $120.

Or, if you're interested in both, I'll sell 'em together for $300. This 
is an _extremely_ good price.

If you're interested, send me email.

-radon

I would be more than happy to host the sfraves photo gallery. :) Just
start sending me your pics and I'll throw something together in HTML and
then make it fancy later.

We could make about 10 questions that people could answer and then we
could put them below the picture....

Start sending your pics to byroni@ccnet.com and I'll set somethiing up on
my friend's server.... as www.tbw.net/sfraves

Hello SFraves 

I was thinking last night that we, or someone on the list should
organize a SFRaves rave. My idea would be for all the DJ's on the list
interested in spinning would submit there name to an organizing
comittee. Because we all know from all the BSP's on the list there are
quite a few promoters on the list. This party would not be exclusive
to SF raves member to go to, it would most likely be a Underground
Party. Since the point of us throwing the party would be strictly for
the fun of the actual event. A list of charities the profits could be
given to. I havent been on the list that long so i dont know if this
has been suggested before, but i know we would be able to create quite
a slamming line-up from SFraves DJ's. Of course this would be a
benefit party so we could most easily get quite a bit of the cost
erased. 

What do you guys think?

love~jeremy

Does anyone know where I can find these three songs, I think Dj Dan has 
spun them all.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**** Okay the first one goes like this:  
	
	"Uh-uh, No-you wouldn't want to...Uh-uh, No-you wouldn't want to...oh 
boy...Uh-uh, No-you wouldn't want to...Uh-uh, No-you wouldn't want to...oh boy!"  
(Or something very much like that & it's a guy singing, kinda poppy sounding.)

**** And the second one, I heard it again at the Peoples Park on Sun goes like 
this:
	(can't understand the beginning)  "I love the sound of your voice...Words 
that you say--stay with me night and day--move me in every way...(can't understand 
this part)--i'm yours till the end of time--Love I'm sure we'll find."  (repeats 
the last line over again & again.)
(Its a chic talking, music starts slow & mellow, going in and out, then builds.

**** The last one is a guy again & he says:
	"Listen, it's getting closer." (With birds and frogs chirping in the 
background.)
	
	The last weo are on Dj Dan WEEDWACKER, but where can I get the originals of 
all three... & what mix is the first one on?

			PLEASE HELP ME AGAIN,  thanks to those who do;
			T      E      R      E       S      A      =]

A pre-attempt to stop flames. My idea for it to be a UG party had
nothing to do with UG vs. Massive. It was only thinking that it would
be easier to throw a UG party over a much bigger massive. I hope this
makes my point a lil' clearer.

I think you missed the sort of subtle and OVERWHELMINGLY CLEVER YET MEAN
AND NASTY POINT of what I was saying.  As in "Take him away, God.  Time to
push him down, or pick him up, but he's not really working out here in the
middle."

 Hey there,

       Moby has allot of stuff out, he even has stuff under different names
(VHF, and some more). I think a favorite disc would come which type a music
you driven by, be it house, jungle, trance, etc..... Moby does it all. My
personal fav is a single called Bring back my happiness, then I would have
to say Everything is wrong Remixed ( a non-stop dj mix by Evil Ninja Moby).

Peace, Luv, & Hugs

...and for that matter my favorite dance track of all time (next to

..."NEXT_IS_THE_E"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

not the mix on his self-titled LP, though (though it's pretty good).  the
one that causes my mind to instantly separate into its component atoms and
randomize itself across the universe is a mix that has a whole bunch of
piano in it.  i don't know what it's called or if anyone who's still
spinning even has it...i have it on the "Live at WHAT?" tape...

We're looking for a third person to be our housemate in a house in
Sunnyvale, conveniently located in a nice neighborhood.

The basics:
Good sized room with ample closet space and shared bathroom.
The house has 2 large common area rooms, plus dining room and modern
kitchen (DW, gas stove/oven, et al.), large back yard and garden,
washer/dryer, and the house itself is fairly large.
You'd be sharing the house with two gay males.
We'd like to have someone responsible, fun, open minded, and easy to
get along with in a shared housing situation.  Obviously ravers are a
+. :-)

Rent: no, it ain't free - it's Silicon Valley! ...  $600/mo
      + deposit, + last, + utilities

Room available on or around Oct. 1, but can be flexible.  We'd rather
take the time to find the right person than rush to get it filled.

For details, please either email me at scooby420@rocketmail.com, or
Scott at Scottw@emu.com, or call Scott at (408) 336-2620 in the
evening before 11:00p.m. or weekends.

Thanks!

 - Robert

There's a version of this that Jeno used to play all the time; I think it's
on the domestic CD single.  Very trancy and non-cheesy sounding.

What's up! 

This song is by Olive, called "you're not alone"
If you like it , also check out the Matthew Robertts' "cloud 10 mix" 
I think I saw the original at a record store in Berkley called Mod Lang.

                     SEPTEMBER 19TH & 20TH, 1997
                        (see bottom 4 lineups)

************************************************************************

Alright Rave-kids... here's the scoop on the massive Liforce event that's
going off next weekend (19th & 20th). This is Liquid & M.Mercury from the
SFR mailing list. We've been working with this event since April, from the
flyers, to djs, to lighting... we were there. We're not making money by
sending out this email, but just dont want ANY of you to miss this event!
We know there is a lot of talk about what's going on, where, who, ect...
we'll let you in on the truth behind this party. It's real, it's legit,
everyone on the line-ups are gonna be there, it's going to be like nothing
you've ever experienced.

We (Sherry & Ryan) have been working hand in hand with the head promoter dude
since April. We've given him advice on the lineups, trying to get together
everyone (djs & liveacts) we could think of people always WANT to see, or
only heard about, designed the flyers, and pretty much advised him on what
'most' ravers would want from the the best party they could dream up.

This is FCP's (first contact presents) first party, before they've been all
involved in theatrical productions. We keep telling people, ITS NOT
(necisarily) THE DJS/MUSIC THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER... ITS EVERYTHING ELSE!
They're building these huge movie-like sets and props, lights & lasers sets,
make-up artists from Startrek! for the aliens that'll be there :) and
so much more; we can't wreck the surprise for you, and tell you everything!
It's gonna be so fun, we can't believe it's in less than two weeks.

Another note:
Some people are talking about 2 other things. Corporate sponsorship and price.
Yes this party is being sponsored; they are Southwest, American,
Dollar renta Car, Noahs Bagels, and Starbucks. Yes, they're corporations, but
look at who they are... they're there for a reason; the airlines are flying
people out, the car rental place are for the same people, and the remaining
two are giving out a free breakfast for everyone. Of course all of them will
make money some way or another, but they will be helping elements in making
the party better. Think how different that is from someone like NIKE or MTV
sponsoring a rave.

And price... yes, we all know that raves (some atleast) are getting more
expensive these days. But are the parties getting better? Some are... but
how offen do you feel that your $20 or $25 or $30 is well spent? We dunno,
but sometimes we feel a little let down by just black lights and speakers
for the price. Granted, its not just the setup that makes a party great but
really, what you're going to get for 25-bucks (presale) is going to be some-
thing you will remember forever. Shoot, get the double-night ticket and it's
even cheaper. Each night is going to be different, it'll feel like another
party all together. Anyways, enough hype, enough explaining, enough text,dang..
sorry this is SO long...!

CHECK **********        WWW.FirstContactPresents.COM         *************
or 1-888-664-8879  for updates, the LINEUPS, info on FCP, and more...

So people... come out to this, you wont regret/forget it :)
It's going to be beautiful and we hope to see you all there!

Much love and dancing and smiles!
Sherry & Ryan (Liquid and Mercury)   - liquid hg design


P.S.  They're planning on doing a PRE-PARTY on the Thursday before that will
      be free for the BOTH-night tiket holders, and $5 or $8 for everyone else.
      They'll probably only have one of the smaller rooms open with a few of
      the djs below, but will give you a taste! Our guess is, that if you go
      to ThAT, you'll go to the next 2 nights for sure :)    You WILL SEE!

Okay all I am confused


> _______LIVE ACTS (Performing BOTH Nights)_____________________________

Is this not the same BASSBIN Twins we have discussed before.  The single guy
from Los Angeles?  
> *BASSBIN TWINS* -live & direct from Belgium, 1st live US performance

I read the interview but it didn't really say much, plus I talked to my friend
who is going b/c he really wants to see them (him) again.  he said that the guy
used to play clubs/parties in LA all the time.

Okay don't mean to be anal about things but its really got me curious

I won't be there anyways opting for Love and PLay Nice but I hope 
all of you who do have a great time and enjoy some great acts.

HUGZ,

herb

Sorry if this is not totally rave related but a good friend of mine had
an unexpected visit from the SFPD last night. About 10 police stormed
his flat (he was  sleeping with his wife and newborn baby). They
confiscated, actually ripped up, his medicine even though he produced a
picture ID from the club. 

Anyway, there is a march and protest tomorrow in SF and we could use a
good turnout. 

1:30 PM Thursday sept. 18th meet at the Club (1400 market?) and march to
850 Bryant.

2:00 Hall of Justice - 850 bryant Demonstration to demand that the SFPD
respect the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (prop 215) and return this
man's legal plants.

Thanks--

Martin

Hi all,

Despite all the confusing posts on here, Saturday night is the night that
Skylab2000 / Rabbit in the Moon / Bassbin Twins will be playing at Lifeforce. 

I think that Friday will be Cirrus and Bassbin Twins, who play both nights.

We (Skylab2000)have played SF once before, at Nikita on July 4th, so we are
looking forward to being there again this weekend.

peace

Yeah I felt that way as well. But at the same time I was excited to see all
the new faces. They were so cute and well dressed and they were at a
massive. It was good to see a flavor of SFR that I don't always see online.

Considering $150 will buy *anyone* a "picture ID" from the Cannabis club, 
I am not suprised it wasn't given much credence. Not that I approve of SS
tactics employed by the police over such a stupid thing. Just pointing out
the value of those picture ID's and the (lack of) integrity of those
issuing them.

I take it that a prescription was issued by a doctor? Why didn't your

I want to offer my charming company to you!

I'm one of those people who have only just recently 
discovered the world of raving- I spent the last year 
in Amsterdam- experiencing all that Amsterdam has to offer.
I know a lot about the scene in Europe/UK but I'm completely 
clueless about the SF scene.  Now I find myself NEEDING to 
hear good techno on a regular basis, it's in my blood.

I went to Big Top and did NOT get a good first impression
about the scene here.  $30 entrance, everyone left by 3am 
(probably because they were mostly under 18) and 
NO ONE was dancing!  I have a feeling that not all events 
are like Big Top, I need some info about where to go and it
would be Xtra nice if I had someone to go with.

Please contact me if you are 20 years old or over, you love
house/techno/drum n bass, dislike trance (okay you can like
trance, but I don't like it), you go to clubs/raves to hear 
good music, you don't have a high and mighty attitude because 
you're SO different, you LOVE to dance, you use drugs 
occassionally but don't need them to have a good time, you pay 
some attention to your appearance but don't smear glitter all 
over yourself and wear 8 inch platforms because you need everyone 
to look at you, you are (or used to be) a thinking individual,
and you'd like someone new to go out with.

I'm 21 years old, in my last semester of college, I've lived in
Boston and LA.  I'm one of the cutest little Asian chicks you'll
ever see in your life, I'm one of the nicest people you'll ever
meet in your life, I have a good time no matter what I do (God,
I feel like I'm writing a personal ad, this is sorta embarrassing),
I'm moving to New York soon so if you are too that would be really
nifty.

marisa -

since you've got email, i'm guessing you have access to some sort of
personal computer.  if it's in your own home, so much the better.  if
it's a fairly recent model (either a power pc or a pc w/a pentium
processor) you can get this cool program called rebirth (which by the
way i would love to "borrow" myself if anyone has it - i've only
gotten to mess w/the free download) which is basically an 808 and two
303's in one computer program.  then you can make up your own beats,
or use the phat ones that come with it, or download other peoples (at
least one sfraver is offering his tracks to download, i believe), then
do whatever you want with them, speed 'em up, slow 'em down, turn up
the 303, loop a sample on your soundblaster card, whatever.  you'd
never have to buy another cd again, just plug your pc into your
stereosystem/box and play your own music.  all this is totally do-able
for anyone with a relatively new computer, you only need lots of hard
disk space to actually burn cd's, which you only need if you want to
distribute it...

Hell yeah!!!  The Doozers!!!!!  they made stuff outta those crystalline 
beams that were supposed to be made from raddishes!  They would get all 
pissed of when the Fraggles ate their stuff, but then they just built 
more and more...  I think there was an episode where the Fraggles stopped 
eating Doozer constructions and pretty soon there was Doozer stuff 
everywhere and the Doozers started getting mad because there was no place 
left to build! :D

(excerpt from Lifeforce BSP message):
>>Another note:
Some people are talking about 2 other things. Corporate sponsorship and price.
Yes this party is being sponsored; they are Southwest, American,
Dollar renta Car, Noahs Bagels, and Starbucks. Yes, they're corporations, but
look at who they are... they're there for a reason; the airlines are flying
people out, the car rental place are for the same people, and the remaining
two are giving out a free breakfast for everyone. Of course all of them will
make money some way or another, but they will be helping elements in making
the party better. Think how different that is from someone like NIKE or MTV
sponsoring a rave.<<



I have to take issue with this paragraph from your (repeat) promotional 
message.  If it's going to be a big, corporate-sponsored event treat it as such 
and don't try to "justify" the corporate (read:$$) driving this party.  
C'mon... Starbucks?  Yeah, I think it's great they offer employee health bennys 
and all, but I can think of few other firms that are as predatory as this one.  
One of the reasons I live in SF is because there are many small neighborhoods 
filled with "community"-- i.e.,  local independent business-run clothing 
stores, record shops, restaurants, COFFEE SHOPS, etc.  I live here because 
every corner is NOT filled with a Blockbuster, McDonalds, STARBUCKS, 
wherehouse, Gap, etc.  I was very happy the other day when I saw that the Una 
Mas (national fast-food mexican chain) that had invaded the street by my house 
had gone out of business, while Miguel's little greasy taqueria had hung a 
banner saying they had been in business 22 years.  Starbucks is opening an 
average of ONE NEW STORE EVERY DAY; how long will your favorite local 
coffeehouse-- the one where your friends work, the one where you hang out and 
read the paper on Sunday morning,--- last when a new Starbucks opens across the 
street?  IMHO, this is NO different from a rave  would be if sponsored by Nike 
(they're there to clothe the DJ's) or MTV (they're there to play Enigma's 
video).  Sorry, you're splitting hairs here.  A corporate-sponsored rave is a 
corporate-sponsored rave.  

Anyway, the line-up looks fun.  I just hope this is not a taste of things to 
come...give me a repeat of Sunday's People's Park or a full moon or a sunset 
anyday over "American Airlines and Noah's Bagels Presents:  Techno, a Journey 
into The Moment's Hot New Music".  

Ciao, Nathan

Bzzt!  Thank you for playing.

The song is "Talk to Me" by Hysterix.

It is on Dj Dan "Weed Wacker" and Tony's "Live Gathering Dec. 93" tape.

I would love to have it on vinyl (or even CD) tho.  Someone was recently
bragging on this list that they had it.

I will have to agree with Jennifer about Big Top... it was quite a
dissapointment, and definitely not a good showing for someone's first SF
rave.  Did anyone else who went feel this way?  The whole integration of
live bands and dj's didn't go to well.  In the main room a band would
finish their set, and ten minutes later a DJ would start, while in the
meantime everyone would leave to go to another room, and the whole thing
just didn't flow.  

I myself left at 3am simply because there was nothing else to look
forward to.  

Well that's my opinion of Big Top.  Jennifer, there will be better stuff
to come.  Just keep watching.  Talk to ya later.

OOPS!
You are probably right, I know which song you're talking about,
BUT, If you listen to Olive's you're not alone, it has very similar
lyrics.

I will punish my self for being a bad trainspotter, 
I will put a record in a microwave , press 4:20 and start.

hey there peeps,

this is julian from socal raves or better known as juce down here, but will
also respond to:
	jucey
	jucey julian
	jucey jules   or
	jules (which sounds like jewels)

anyways, i'm coming up to the bay area to visit my sister who's at uc
berkeley right now.  i've been raving on and off for about 5 years now.  i
actually started off in the bay area when i attended berkeley.  but i'm
living down here in cloudy, hot, humid southern california now.  

well, i love this scene, love the music, and love the people.  and
hopefully, so will my sister who will be attending her first rave this
weekend, along with several other rave-virgins.
now i've been reading everybody's posts for the past week and a half (sorry
if i didn't wait the normal 2 weeks), sorry to hear how the massives went
off this past weekend. eht down here was about as exciting down here as it
was up there (so i heard, didn't go myself).  big top down here, although
things got way screwy with cancelled stages and cut djs, people, on the
whole, seemed to have had a pretty good time considering how big it was.

on saturday night, i will be taking my sister and some of her friends to
lifeforce.  i know it's a massive and it's corporate sponsored, but they've
got some great acts and djs.  plus, i'll be there to support one of our
boys and fellow socaler, dennis barton of skylab 2000.  hopefully, this
will go off and i'm really excited to see how the promoters visually
entertain us all.  so if any of you sfravers plan on going to this saturday
night, let me know.  i'll be sporting a socal-raves laminate or two.  i
would love to meet some of you kids.

i would really like to go to play nice, as it seems like a lot of you are
planning to head down there, but i can't be at 2 places at once. :(

oh, i don't have any plans yet for friday night.  my sister's probably
going to call it an early night (wants to be nice and rested for saturday
night), so if there's a nice small party going on with thick vibes and hard
thumping beats, let me know.  

hope to meet some of yas,

juce


btw, i told my sister to check out people's park sunday.  i'm not sure how
long she stayed there, but she said she had fun and that "it sounded like
the music you (that being me) play."  which i guess i take as a good thing.

He does have and did produce a doctors prescription, although a
recommendation is all I beleive he needs.

Regardless of the problems of the cannabis club and their relationship
with the police, A man was legally, quietly growing some plants on his
back porch, with a doctors prescription. (No elaborate grow setup).

I, personally, am not going to swallow the SFPD resoning that they have
the authority to disregard and ignore the Compassionate Use Act simply
because they do not agree with the cannabis clubs practices.

It seems to me that people in need growing their own is the best
solution for everyone involved. It eliminates involvement with dealers
in general. (both street corner and the club).

while i'm usually not much for spooky's style the music that he spins is
usually pretty good and he's a nice guy, but i could live without
shitslinger and his awful mc, TC I-SLEPT although even Carlos does some
good things for the scene - I wouldn't mind his spaced out jungle if it
weren't for Islam constantly telling me how much of a superstar we all are

I could get along with you really well (I tend to get seriously annoyed
with people who preach the PLUR gospel instead of just letting it happen,
get anywhere NEAR me with pacifiers and/or stuffed animals in public, or
smear themselves with glitter - thanks, but no thanks, that's so like, 1991
- but apparently California has this huge candyraver culture - here in New
York the equivalent is generally a superskinny 15-year-old k-head with
multiple piercings and nasty hair, but oh well - are we regressing or
evolving here, and can you do both at once?), and I live in New York - but
brace yourself - you probably already know this, but there's a million and
one of the "cutest little Asian chicks you'll ever see in your life"
here...  Hell, even my boyfriend could be one of those...  he's cute as
hell and we wear the same clothes...

And oh yeah, I like almost anything as long as it doesn't sound like "BAM
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM" - that probably leaves out most techno for me I
guess...  Four four can be annoying if it ain't done right.

As most of you know, I am working my ll' arse off to make sure y'all 
get a good dose of fOaM. As of now, due to SF & Oakland being such 
greedy little piggies ($5000 just 4 tha permit : ( there may be a fOaM 
fundraiser ; ) down in SoCal to garner enough capital to host one up 
here. In the meantime, I seem to have had another brilliant idea.
   I was driving to school yesterday and I saw a young man. I have seen 
many others like him. He was hobbling as if he had been so unfortunately 
stricken with Polio, Muscular Dystrophy, Multiple Sclerosis or any one 
of a number of debilitating diseases. I thought to myself, "I have never 
seen anyone like this at a rave... why not?" Of course my brain began to 
work overtime and I'll not bore you with the details, but suffice to say 
that an idea had been born. I want to make sure anyone & EVERYONE feels 
welcome to dance! Somehow, I want to get groups of people that may be in 
wheelchairs, use braces or even may be mentally challenged, together and 
bring them to an environment where they are not judged on the basis of 
how well they dance, but feel like they have all the freedom in the 
world to move however they're able!
Introducing....

in soCal i know there are several people in wheelchairs who come to
events...they never get a second look or anything so this sounds like a
great idea.

but do people at raves normally get judged on how well they dance?  if they
do that's too bad...

and if you're at a party that's really going off at like 1 a.m. even if you
can walk perfectly well without external aid, you still have no freedom in
the world to move however you're able.  unless shuffling back and forth in
the same 2' x 2' space counts as moving...

good luck putting this together!

I do not think that people are judged by their dancing skills (other 
than B-Boy circles) at raves... precisely why I think it would be great! 
I mean, these people are probably used to being gawked at everywhere 
they go so they may not even venture into a nightclub for fear of more 
stares. I also want this to be for people that are mentally challenged. 
They unfortunately suffer the most just due to people's ignorance. I 
think everyone there would gain something from it. Hopefully those 
without any disability will see just how lucky they are and those with 
disabilities will realize just how normal they are. Maybe everyone will 
understand just how special we all are.

We need to clear something up about this patient.  I am directly involved
with the 215 campaign.  It is very difficult to obtain a "percription" for
medical pot.  If this person had a "perscription" they would receive cannabis
from the federal government,  so much that they would not have to grow any. A
"recommendation" for cannabis is completely different. But, if you have a
recommendation you can obtain cannabis from a buyer's club.  You need a
perscription for cannabis from Holland.  This is the only way to obtain a
"perscription" in the U.S. Ther was a federal program that provided cannabis
to 12 patients. 4 or 5 of them have died( not from pot) and the rest continue
to receive pot.  Right now there are 0 "perscriptions" in the U.S., only the
leftovers of a worthless government study, "recomendations", and all the
homegrown you can harvest.  Peace Love Pot

Whoa, what a response (5th or 6th like this now).  

I have already downed it... thank you all.

Obviously this is something I should have already had.

I still have to install it, but the demo tracks have shown me the
possibilities.

Thanks again...

We did this for the uk-dance mailing list, called it Triology - got a 
venue with 3 rooms and had 700 people jumping like loons to Tech/house, 
Jungle and weird beats in the 3 rooms, organised and DJd by people from 
the list. Best thing I've ever done. It'd go well here. I'm game for 
organising/DJing. We need a co-ordinator and a separate mailing list to get 
with organising it, but it's more than possible - it'd be a crime if we 
didn't.
If you want to see what it was all about in the UK, check:
http://www.kult.demon.co.uk
It was so successful they're doing more stuff all over London (Without 
me, sob, sob!). However, don't even think about doing it for financial 
gain - it ain't easy to make money out there. We lost a load, but it was 
worth paying to see hundreds of sweaty smiley faces jumping up and down 
due to our efforts.

That's the point, they aren't.  Although all too frequently they *are* in an environment where they are judged...


they need hugs like everyone else.

Thank you so much to everyone who helped me out with finding what they were 
called and where I might find them.  For anyone else that was wondering about them too 
here they are:

The FIRST one that I asked about was called, "You're not alone." by OLIVE.

The SECOND one was, "Talk to me." by HYSTERIX.

The LAST one was, "Treefrog."

		Find them on DJ DAN___WEEDWACKER

Just to remind you and add some additional info...
South Bay Pre-party
Sept 20, approx 6-10
In honor of Play Nice (but you need not be going to Play Nice to attend!)

And the DJs are...
DJ Shimmer
DJ Pillow
DJ Thorfio

These are all new (or new to the area) talents.  This party should truly be out-of-hand.
 I am really excited and want to thank everyone who is making the effort to stop
by!  You don't need to already know me to be welcome in my home.  If you missed the
directions on the last post or have any questions, call me at 408-984-6360.  Can't
wait to see you on Saturday!!

I suggest that if you do decide to do this which I think is a great
idea, I think that you would want to bring them to a phat underground
party because the vibes are so much better there. Massives I wouldn't
do it, but at an underground anyday. Let me know how it goes.

I am looking for people interested in being part of a brand new
scene in the South Bay. We are interested in producing parties with
fantastic vibes and local dj's and occasional out of town deejays. If
you are interested in helping then email me @ undrgrnd@kudonet.com. We
are looking for people with good attitudes and people that want to have
fun. If you are sick of the South Bay scene and want to help email me.

Because of all the day to day stress we often find ourselves under, I 
thought this may help each of you out in its own way :)
     
When you are feeling a little stressed, read the below:  

Picture yourself near a stream. Birds are softly chirping in the crisp cool
mountain air.  

Nothing can bother you here. 

No one knows this secret place.
 
You are in total seclusion from that place called "the world." 

The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a cascade of 
serenity.
 
The water is clear and you can easily make out the face of the person
whose head you're holding under the water. 

Look.  It's the person who caused you all this stress. 

What a pleasant surprise.  

You let them up... just for a quick breath... then ploop!  Back under they
go...
 
You allow yourself as many deep breaths as you want. 

There now, feeling better?((((((((((P.L.U.R.)))))))))
((((((((ChaDsTeR))))))))

Okay. People this needs to stop! Everyone who has recently become
addicted to this drug needs to stop. I know a lot of this has been going
around and I have been hearing how it has been changing everyone.
Don't go down this path!!
Crystal Meth is the most dirtiest drug in the world.
Make wise choices.

well, you're just in luck, kid.   I  *only* hang out with pre- 20something
people who wear glitter and platform shoes.  Perhaps we met at the
Limelight in NYC back in '91?   No?

gimme a call!  we'll snuggle with our pacifiers in prenatal bliss!

	I guess that means I shouldn't ask you for some muriatic acid
and sodium hydroxide since I am out from cooking up my last? ;-)

(The above was a _joke_ in case that wasn't clear - while it is
tempting to supply myself in such a way and avoid middlemen, I have
other substances I prefer for which I use those same materials, ones
that I could wave in the face of law enforcement before taking and be
free from worry...)

Hell yeah!

ALL of the people I know  who are/did use it didn't get anything out of
it.
It is sad to see a rise in its use,

What is worse is people who do it for their first time and try to get
everyone else to do it with them, promising some kind of wonderful
transformation in their life.

I guess only the strong survive, and doing  any type of meth is a test,
because it does not make people any stronger.

 In light of the recent post about the Cassini mission, I thought I'd 
post the URL for the mission.

 I work with folks who were part of the Cassini design team, and ITT 
Cannon (the company I work for) connectors are on the delivery vehicle.

Anyway, here's a place to get some facts about the mission:

Thanks to everyone who wrote in response to "Get outta your rut."
Not to be cheezy but you all sound very nice and I'm glad I joined
this sfraves thing.

Sorry if I offended anyone with the age thing, I hang out with people
of all ages, but lately all of my friends seem to be younger than me.
That's all.

All I ever wanted in life was a big sister to play Barbie's with.

When sex is a dangerous game
Alison Motluk reports
from last week's International Ethological Conference in Vienna
The flatworm Pseudoceros bifurcus is no romantic. When it wants sex, 
it simply rears up and stabs its mate with its penis. Because it is a 
hermaphroditic species, its mate has a penis too, so it may get a jab 
in return. This leads to an unusual foreplay ritual that its 
discoverers in Germany have dubbed "penis fencing".
Nicolaas Michiels and Leslie Newman of the Max Planck Institute for 
Behavioural Physiology in Seewiesen stumbled upon the 6-centimetre 
worm in the sea off Heron Island at the southern end of Australia's 
Great Barrier Reef. For 20 hours they observed 16 pairs of worms, 
which they had housed in ice-cream tubs. At first, the animals did 
nothing.  "They can't smell, so they couldn't find each other," says 
Michiels.
But when the worms happened to meet, they started sexual fencing bouts 
that lasted up to an hour. The two animals would sit up, evert their 
penises and try to inject sperm into each other. Only about one out of 
six strikes leads to successful insemination, says Michiels, who calls 
the behaviour "brutally inefficient". The animals are left severely 
wounded, with prominent punctures.
Michiels says each worm may be trying to inseminate others and avoid 
being stabbed itself so that others have to bear the energetic costs 
of reproducing its genes. "It's hard to know whether the individuals 
are really trying to avoid being hit," comments Janet Leonard of 
Oregon State University in Newport. "It's an interesting hypothesis.

word paul.
but seriously, hun, the people who have the problems, are NOT going to
take heed to your plea for them to quit.
they're prolly saying "that candyraver kid don't know shit about nothin,
he doesn't understand and he sucks"
see.. there's this thing called denial...
"I use it in moderation". 
moderation?
no...
hmm
let me cut/paste exerpts of a conversation i had with a friend re: his
addiction that it took 4 months to stay a week clean. 

a sidenote before i start the exerpt: i hate the drug, it's destroyed alot
of what i have known to love, and turned my friends into distant memories
who i wish i could see more of but why hang out with them when they're all
twacked out and drama-indulged? (ack it's that DRAMA word again, someone
shoot my ass off)

you people need to realize that crystal meth DOES change your personality.
itcan cause permanent personality disorders, such as acute schizophrenia
or paranoia, or general assholiness. it does HELL to your emotions, fucks
up your perspectives, starts out as recreational and ends up creeping into
your very heart and soul and taking them captive...

 flame me about this, please, i have a million flames in
return...

anyhoo on with the excerpt
*****

 *Merc* im tellin you...i mean i know that im still addicted to crystal
*Merc* i know that if i did some it would be the best fucking feeling in
the world
*Merc* but i was away from it for a long enough time to let my head clear
*Merc* and i wouldnt even put myself in that position again
*Merc* you never stop liking the drug, but you have to get away from it
for long enough to see clearly, that it hurts more in the longterm
Merc:the shortterm stops being so important. when yer hooked on speed the
next rush is all you give a fuck about... and no matter how good you are
feeling in your body, you're fucked
up.  well, i know for myself i wouldnt have been strong enough to just
quit. i had to get away from it
***
(regarding friends who do crystal as well)
***
	Merc: people say "those kind of people arent your friends" but
thats bullshit
 they are your friends and i know that
 but they are fucked up, and you're fucked up
i know how it is, addiction is like a disease  
everyone just feeds off of each other , cuz nothing else matters.
its like a sinking ship. you cant save them, all you can do is jump off
the boat yourself. id much rather sulk in my room and do some cool things
by myself than to be so fucked up for a hit of crack or a bump of crystal
that i hate life that much more. and that's all that shit ever leads to.
hating life more than you would have...
the shortterm becomes too important when yer addicted like that
coz you're never
ever
going to be able to come up with a way to be fucked up all the time
it can't happen
you'll run out of money, or life first..
something's gotta give.. and when yer addicted, anytime that you aren't
using you feel like shit
worse than you would have straight.
****

i could go on but i think well shit...
paul, t would be lovely to think that your small plea would affect
someone, but it takes alot more than a post to a mailing list to help
those who have a problem..

everyone else, if you have ever asked yourself (this is people who do
crystal)( even for a SECOND:L "Do I have a problem?" 
you probably do... or if you keep up the usage.,. you will very soon have
a problem..
most of my friends have been caught in this grip, and it caught me for a
moment but i slipped free and i'm sitting around in solitude wondering
what to do
if it's even worthopening your mouth and speaking your opinion
because so many friendships are lost by confronting people with drug
problems
anyway...
stay true to yourselves, always.
xo

I was in 7-11 the other day and i was dieing for one of those ever so tasty
slurpees. All they had was some mystery flavor that tasted like poo. All of
the other ones were all melted.. Well anyways, it was like 3 o'clock in the
morning and you know how it is really hard to make decision at that time..
Well i'll get on with the story, I was looking around and next to the
poisinous hot dogs I spoted a can of red bull. =) As I was walking over to
look at the back of the can. I noticed right next to it a can that had BIG
letters that read, "XTC". I had to buy that can. I was in line and I took a
big gulp of it and I yelled out, " OH SHIT, IM eN bALLs"..... =) The drink
actually tasted good... I was just thinking that they should run ad campaigns
with some big name Djs endorsing the drink.. It could be like Carl Cox
holding up a can of XTC and saying, "After a long session, I always like to
drink my XTC. It gives me that special boost to help me groove till dawn."
 Yeah that will be the day.. hey download this file then open it to see some
kewl party pictures... Im warning though that these are pictures of massives.
 (I know how all of you peeps always say that massives suck) Sorry y'all =(
no party pix of n e of the small gatherings that ive been to... maybe next
time. peace

Peace Love Unity Respect

Hey guys,

I've been busy, haven't had a chance to post to the list lately about all the
cool escapades. After going through withdrawls ("WHY HASN'T ANYBODY POSTED
ANYTHING IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES?!!!!!" Yeah, I need to get a life....) due
to my inability to make anytime to really post anything, here is a whopper of
a post to make up for it all. 
Sorry 'bout the size but for those of you who don't give a rat's ass about
URB, 

Hit DELETE NOW on your email program. (bye, bye). 

(Don't flame me either, I'm just trying to give those w/o web access a chance
to read it. Plus, I really happen to believe it's rave related, considering
the roots, man. It's all about the history! It's also not a BSP considering
I'm not forcing you to our COMMERCIALLY SUPPORTED WEB SITE that I make zero
money on.)

Ah, but for those of you who have read URB and followed the mag (and maybe
these last 7 years of following it really means something to ya), or you just
plain like it, here is the interview that I did with him at ULTRA a coupla
weeks back.
This is supposed to go into Citi:Zen tommorrow, so sfraves get the scoop on
everyone else  (ahhhh, it's just 'cuz I love you all....)

You know what else, tho? If you have any comments about what he says, I'd love
to know them. I have to write an intro and a conclusion, and I don't know
really what to write (straight brain drain...I've been soooo busy I can't see
straight). 
Give me some ideas, plz! It would be cool if some of you had some story about
how something in URB might have affected you or got you into the scene or
something like that.
(oh, and if Chelsea Clinton is now part of this list, ('cuz "you go, rave
girl") and you submit an idea... IT GOES IN!)

still a democrat,

rob.

########################################

C:Z
 I was reading your editorial in the latest issue and saw that you have some
real changes going on within URB.

Raymond Roker
 Yeah, some people have to realize their own growth. Todd (C. Roberts) has
been with us for a long time and he just wanted to realize some other things.
That is how I feel sometimes as well, you know. The magazine is a very
encompassing profession, as you well know, and there is this electronica craze
going on right now. Everybody wants to get what should be coming to them. They
have put a lot of hard work into the scene and Todd was one of them, so he
wants to branch out. Its funny because even though he is leaving us to pursue
other things, he has actually become a greater asset to us cuz hes out there
now representing what we are about, looking out for us, and giving us some
great pieces. So its solid.
Tamara (Palmer) moved up to San Francisco and I talk to her more now than when
she was even in the URB office. I almost talk to her on a daily basis and I
know what we need from her for the magazine, so it is working out well. She
just wants to be at home in San Francisco, keep her own hours. Shes a San
Francisco girl still. 
A lot of people come to L.A. and never quite get acclimated.  It happened to
my cousin as well. He went back to New York eventually.

C:Z
 Are you from L.A.?

Roker
 No. I was born in the Bahamas in Nassau and I grew up in  New Orleans. Ive
lived in L.A. since I was 13.

C:Z
 Its funny because I just got back from New York a few weeks ago and dealt
with a lot of native New Yorkers while I was there. Talking to you earlier
down stairs, I thought you had this east coast flavor in the way that you
talk. Its very to the point. You were like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep going,
and I was like, Man, I gotta hurry up and get to the point.

Roker 
 Do I?

C:Z Yeah. I was expecting this whole L.A./California laid back personality,
but it wasnt like that. It probably has to do with running the magazine....

Roker
 Well, I have to deal with a lot of people. Ninety percent of the roads that
you go down, in a social exchange, Ive been down before numerous times. You
just have to cut to the quick. I really deal with things pretty
striaght-forward and I know what things I need to avoid. You kinda just have a
plot already figured out with a lot of your interactions. 

C:Z
 Seven years ago, you were running around with the first issue of URB
distributing it around L.A., Melrose Avenue, and such. I would imagine that
the Raymond Roker of seven years ago is quite different from the one today. Do
you feel, as you are getting older, it is changing your perspective of the
Rave/Hip Hop/Publishing scene?

Roker
 For one thing, as you get older, your eyes open up. Perspective is all about
lifes experiences and how they are accumulated. What you see, or have been
privy to, is what you know. Ive always been one of those people who like to
explore and see new people. I like finding out what is going on at different
levels. The magazine was a doorway for me to do this. When I started URB I
didnt realize that the magazine would be this portal to this expansive,
growing, revolution. The magazine has put me in a position to walk through
this doorway and other minds [that read the magazine] have opened up to the
potential as well.
Even though my perspective on certain truths didnt change, I still believe in
the same connections back when I started the magazine, I got to see how
pervasive some things really are; both good and bad.

C:Z
 The struggle that I face when publishing a magazine is the conflict between
the business needs and the ideal opportunity to say what I really feel. Do you
feel that conflict when publishing URB?

Roker
 Yeah, you mature in that respect. It is a forced maturity. You just have to
be realistic and wiegh what is important to run a business. When you are
younger and first starting out, certain things feel more important than others
because you dont really realize the reality of the situation. Not as much is
at stake. As you go on, though, you learn how to balance the requirement
between the ideals of publishing and the business requirements that take
place. Comprimise is part of life. 
For instance, we drive 55 because 65, 75, 85 is going to get you a ticket or
cause you to get in accident and kill someone else. You can be Fuck the
World and drive 80 mph down the road in a 35 mph zone, but you are probably
going to kill someone.
Its not selling out, it is just being able to weigh the two requirements to
find a successful balance. What is more important to me right now? Is it
writing an editorial that calls my main advertiser a lying piece of shit or
knowing that my main advertiser is a lying piece of shit but allowing them
to give me money so I may subvert their monetary support in other ways, one of
which is to write about truth. 
URB has been subversive. We have done this right under the nose of some of our
advertisers. Actually, if you read some of my older editorials you will read
that I sometimes mention the names of our advertisers and question what they
are doing even though they are advertising in that same issue.
Anyway, it is your business so no one can really keep the score on you. Its
your decision as to what needs to happen. Business, just like in life, comes
down to personal choices. The responsibility business has to truth is just as
high as an individual has to upholding the truth. If individuals are a certain
way then their business will reflect that.

C:Z
 One of the things that I was always impressed with is your dedication to
creating a bridge for the people involved in this culture. You have always
made an attempt to show how rave or techno and hip hop are intertwined.

Roker
 Its because I am an Oreo. Im mixed. It is as simple as that. My reality has
always been because people have always tried to divide my world or divide me. 

C:Z
 What do you mean, Youre mixed?

Roker
 You know, Im black. Im also white. My heritage is mixed. The black side of
my family is Bahamaian, I dont know them to be any more than that. They are
of African descent living in the Bahamas. Sons of slaves, daughters of slaves.
But on the white side of my family, my mother is half Porteguese, Russion Jew,
and German. There is all sorts of stuff goin on up in there.
Im black and white and I grew up in the south. All my life people have always
tried to divide me. I had to go through the pain of dealing with that. It
happens to all people that are of mixed race and culture. The stories are
always the same and as you grow up in this type of world you start to be able
to draw the connections. I mean, regardless of personal experience, people
really doubt the connections that Ive been trying to show in URB. Anyway, I
dont need a world that is divided. Ive been trying to explain the
connections for years but certain people still dont want to see these things
because it doesnt reflect their reality. To them, it doesnt matter what I say.
But thats not the world I want to live in, so if I go to my grave Im going
to project the world [with these connections] and if I can back my stance up
with enough evidence, cool. The world that is not connected with me is a world
I dont want to be associated with. Its not a world I want to be a part of.
Fundamentally, I believe there are real connections beyond my wishful
thinking. I mean, how could you have gotten to Drum n Bass without Hip Hop?
How? Draw the fuckin line for me, yknow? If it wasnt for Bambatta, if it
wasnt for Kool Herc figuring out how to mix records and how to make the DJ
the center of attention, Sasha would be nothing. He descended from these
innovators not from some loser disco dj. The progression goes from Grandmaster
Flash mixing it up with Larry Levan which involves your gay black house with
your black ghetto, disenfranchised Hip Hop. This eventually reaches your white
British kid. You cannot draw a family tree without connecting all of these
things. If this is not done it is disrespectful and it is a waste of culture.
To think that my music just suddenly spontaneously combusted out of the
Heavenly Social because Ed and Tom (of the Chemical Brothers) decided to play
this music is disrespectful to our culture. I am comfortable with knowing that
there were many types of people that contributed to this revolutionary new
music because it makes it colorful, it makes a movement, it makes it something
I want to be a part of.

C:Z
 Seeing all the progress that this scene and music has made, do you feel
vindication that some people are starting to get it? That after seven years of
bangin your head against the wall that some progress is being made?

Roker
 Ive easily got another seven years a head of me. Its cool when you travel
and you meet people from around the country and they talk about things that I
believe in or along the lines of where my head is. That is when I feel, like,
damn, this kid is on it. And who knows if hes even read URB? My mom is a
teacher, so I really feel like teaching is where my head is. Whether it is
through my writing, my graphic design, or whatever it is I can get involved
with, I try to teach something. 

C:Z
 What happened when you took URB national after you had been a free local
magazine for so long throughout California and L.A.? Did you lose anything
along the way?

Roker
 Well, we lost our innocence. We also lost the comfort of just being among
friends. But being only local and always just covering those you are familiar
with can become fairly incestuous. You deal with your same circle of DJs, same
circle of promoters, and you write about the same things every month. 
L.A. was not proving it was the center of world, it wasnt even trying. Other
places in the world were delivering stronger flyers, stronger connections to
Detroit techno, connections to Europe, House, Jungle, peaceful rave movements,
3 day parties. Florida was going off, Wisconson was going off, so why just do
the L.A. thing? 
L.A. has proven that it doesnt really support its own local efforts as well.
I mean look at the L.A. Weekly which has to take sex ads to diet pill ads etc.
just to survive. The Reader went out of business. BAM tried to fill our shoes
when we went national for a second. Now its like a fuckin newsletter. L.A.
Style and Buzz are  duking it out. 
Its not a city built around publications. There is too much transient culture
moving in and out, there arent any newstands, everybody drives, its too
spread out. There were a lot of reasons to go national. The record companies
were concerned about being just locally advertised, clothing companies, and
even the DJs were concerned about reaching other audiences besides L.A. We had
to move for our own good and Ive always wanted to do URB Magazine in the best
possible way. 
Im not going to fuckin dedicate the best years of my life to something and
not push it to its potential. 
That doesnt mean that it needs to be the biggest in the world, but it does
mean that we must make it the best possible magazine it could be. I knew that
part of its growth was dependent on making it national. Not to be egocentric,
but I feel that URB had done a damn good job at representing what was going on
in the scene so why hide us away in California? I really thought that someone
was going to come along with some money and dump it into something national
and it was going to take what should be ours.
So that was it. We did it. And when we did it, everybody was like, Thats it.
Theyre over. Kids really resented us, boycotted us, and we really fell out
peoples good will in the state of California. But, however, there were people
that were finding us for the first time around the country and that was exciting.

C:Z
 I remember when you made that switch. I was really hyped for you. Actually, I
think I saw it coming. You were increasing the quality of the paper stock,
your coverage was getting more national, etc.
 
Roker
 We really, really went into some serious times after going national. Cash
flow was an issue. We had to invest so much into printing, had to wait to get
our money from distributors, it was really tough. It took two years before we
got over that and trying to stay away from going over the brink. It was just
about Spring or Summer of last year when things really started to click. 
People that didnt call before started to call. People wanted us to sponsor
their tours. The cool insiders were checking us again, or at least admitting
to it, and we had passed the hump. I think some people just had to respect us
for our longevity and they eventually realized that we didnt change our
philosophy just because we went national. I dont sweat it to this day.

C:Z
 Did the magazine almost go out of business?

Roker
 Well, we probably almost went out of business a few times during our
existence but we were really, really hurting during this period. There is big
difference between really, really hurting and almost going out of business,
you know. There is always a way out. I mean, even if you had to lay off people
and ask them, Hey guys, you can hang out if you want while I get things
together, and fuck off all your creditors or whatever. You can do it as long
as you have your audience. Look at Apple, you couldnt find a more
revolutionary company, and look at their woes. Companies do that sort of thing
all the time. 
As time goes on, I am having less and less of hard time dealing with the fact
that our company has had hard times. Way bigger companies have had bigger
problems. Its just a fact of doing business.
All those magazines that were dancing around our assumed grave....

C:Z
 It didnt happen.

Roker
 Nope, it didnt happen. Sure enough, though, the scene expanded to command
national attention and we were there along with that expansion. It was a
natural progression and we had to do it.

C:Z
 My only criticism I can think of regarding URB was its lack of an overt
political stance. I carry this criticism about the rave scene in general,
which is: Where can we preach to the non-converted about how we feel? I
always thought that URB was sometimes too much about what was going on rather
than what we, our generation, could do with what was happening.

Roker
 Well, I can think of many more criticisms of URB, but really, part of that
comes down to the resources weve had. URBs political stance has always been
more cultural, more from the heart. It has always been less concerned with the
tangible how-tos. Some of that has to do with me. I like to deal more on the
personal tip. My editorials really may come off as making strong statements,
but Im not on the preachy tip and I believe in more personal actions. 
I think if you read between the lines, though, there is more there than people
give credit for. A lot of people might say, you know, URB is not really
political, but do you really read the articles? Do you really listen to what
the artists are saying?
I used to listen to Black Sabbath. Im still a Black Sabbath head and I had to
listen to people talk about how Ozzy was a satanist. I was like, Do you
really listen to Ozzy? Do you read what his lyrics are about? Does he ever
mention Satan in a loving kind of way? Does he ever mention God or Jesus?
People didnt listen to him talk about peace, caring for the environment, and
worry about blowing ourselves up. You had to read and listen.
I think that a lot of what URB has covered has allowed for a message to be
sifted out. It really cries out for personal responsibility. I think for me,
that is the most important thing. People have to start with themselves. If
they start there and learn how to believe in truth, believe in themselves,
believe in what they are listening to, project that truth out into the scene,
have compassion, recognize struggles of their brothers and sisters, that is
what translates into political action.

you want to see nasty?
come into the valley where I live. the FBI calls it crank alley because
of all the meth
peeps walking around with all of their teeth rotting out ,so skinny that
its incredible.
paranoid and deliusional they rob stores and people to support the drug
habit .
they smoke it ,slam it ,put it up their noses, and kill themselves,a one
way trip through hell. my brother went to prison over it , then, as soon
as he was paroled he was 
doing that crap again, 
some of my high school buddies (male and female) live on the street , and
spend
every penny they can on that crap
its amazing , at first people look normal , a year passes the face is
starting to get skinny, two years pass paranoia is set in deep, and they
can "control the habit"
three years pass their health is gone , teeth are starting to rot and
,"they don't have a drug problem"

i need to take a trip across the country, seriously - i hate not being able
to see exactly what it is you people are talking about (oh, and by the way,
i was looking at urb a few minutes ago and *gasp* ohmigod you people really
DO still wear gigantic platforms out there)...

this is an awful ramble, but oh well - i am supposed to be at roni size
with my boyfriend (whole reason for the urb magazine read is cuz it got us
a comp + 1 if he'd write the review - I'm now sitting on my ass and
painting my toe nails thanks to the fucking mayor of this city, who's
crackdown on nightlife has gotten my 24 ass turned away from SEVERAL club
doors now since i can't find my drivers' license)...

Anyway, it's just been one bitch session after another with me today, but
regardless:  i came from the south (gawgia, to be exact) - used to drive
all over the south east to party, 44,000 miles on a brand new car in a
year, to be exact...  at any rate, for some reason, the florida kids all
went to smack after a while (the pills got to the point where people would
just walk around and throw up and keep on eating them, and no i'm not
kidding), and it was, oddly enough, the north carolina kids who got freaked
on speed...

now - my thing always was, i'd get some, go dance all night, give half of
it away and not think anything of it, and drive the four hours back to
atlanta alone, singing really loud and butt-dancing and coming home to
crash after being up the entire weekend.  yeah, my head was cracked out,
and i was a mess, but a few days of good eating and sleep turned everything
around.  Perhaps the weirdest thing I saw all weekend were the hardcore nc
speedheads who'd been up for days, going to the next party and the next,
and the next, and then coming home and doing some more.  that always fucked
up my head HARD...

And it got worse when i saw my friend, who was skinny to begin with,
narrowing down to nothing but a skeleton with taut skin and sores...
Seeing this other guy, who was a professional boxer and went to school to
be a, get this, drug counselor, up for fourteen days and sitting by his
window with a shotgun in paranoia - earlier on that weekend he had a party
at his house, and decided he'd take an old guitar amp, do something to it
that made it into a tattoo needle, and actually give himself one of the
best tattoos i've ever seen - still tho, he was missing teeth and had a few
of those nasty sores himself, but it was a pretty bizarre thing to see...

i don't know what happened to any of those people - last i heard, since i
just had to quit going there after a while since everyone got so freaky on
me, was that she quit and moved away, and god only knows what happened to
him...

here's the clincher tho - i still do it sometimes...  apparently it's
reaching mass proportions here again on the east coast (upper east coast
this time, i moved) under the name of "glass" - probably called that
because that's what feels like is going up your nose, i dunno, but it's
more the younger kids - at any rate, i don't see myself feening for it, and
i don't know any dealers personally - so what is it out there - is it all
over the place or what?  Are normal college-educated types doing it and
getting hooked, or is it just the uh, people who get totally caught up in
the scene and don't have a life outside?  what?  from my perspective, which
is a party every few weeks or so and a sunday and monday of hell recovering
(i'm an old lady, remember) it doesn't seem like that big of a deal - and i
haven't seen anyone freaking out on it or getting seriously paranoid since
i moved here...

and i'm clueless, because i'm all the way on the other coast and until
today, i seriously thought someone was joking when he said y'all wear 16
inch platforms and stuff cuz we don't do that here...

and i'm pissed because i'm not at roni size right now and my apartment is
totally clean and the driver's license STILL hasn't shown up, and i don't
get it...

anywayz, i guess i'll see for myself next spring, if i don't fly out there
to check it out first, but it's just weird - i mean, it seems like
ravers/scene people support some drugs and not others, when it just seems
to me like personal choice...  It sounds like you guys lump it in with the
likes of crack or something and that people seem to use it the same way...

at any rate, i can see the damaging effects of any kind of amphetemine,
physically and emotionally, but playing around with my serotonin levels
seems just as dangerous...

my vote goes to tv.  not only does it make you sit on the couch and
stare at a little glowing screen for hours on end, it's always telling
you stupid things like "buy a car you can't afford!", or "you don't
look good unless you weight 98 pounds and use clairol!", or "vote
republican!"  all heroin ever tells you is "get more heroin".

of course, meth tells you shit like "your friends are out to get you."
 maybe it IS the dirtiest nastiest drug there is...

I am sometimes ashamed to have been blessed with the energy I have.

And sometimes I wish I could just drip my blood into the mouths of the
tweaks.  Just to trip them out.  Just kidding.

It's like, there are people who trust in the meth, and think of it as the
future, like they are more competetive and vital because of it.

And that is what I love about jungle.  And other forms of music.  If you
are RIGHTEOUS, and the music is BUMPING, it's like no other drug.  It's
you and having a power exchange with the primal forces that sit and wait
within our silly modern bodies.

I am sorry that some of you will do speed and never been in a drum circle
at a Grateful Dead show.

But I will say this.  If you take speed, try to save enough money to buy a
drum, and find a circle.  There are nice ones on the Berkeley campus,
especially on Sunday afternoons.  you can't help but hear them.

And get good at playing your own drum.  And don't let other people play it
very often, unless they really really need to.  Or you want them to.

And slip into a heartbeat that sometimes will just make you start crying.
Not out of sadness, or happiness.  Out of the emotions that we cannot
connect with sometimes.  The ones that don't have names.  And play with it
gently.  But also beat the motherfucking shit out of it sometimes.  But
definitely play with it.

And it will play with you.  Bonk bonk!

Oh yeah, and then quit being taken advantage of by speed, right?

And then pray that one day the Man will decriminalize cannabis, so that
people will have access to something other than drink to use to feel a
little less connected to the horrors that life brings sometimes, or more
connected to the wonders we can bring life.

NOW I SOUND LIKE A RAVE FLYER AUTHOR HI HOW ARE YOU


I feel bad for you, if you tweak.  And bad if your life has been messed
with directly or indirectly by a drug so cheap and silly and powerful,
that people start living the sterotype of the anti-drug crusaders.

And commit crime without justification or thought.  Which is of course the
bad kind of crime.

Which of course, connects me back to the point.  It is no crime to bang
drums.  Get to it, ye wee snozzijizz.

DUH,
MAX

No offense but my good friends that I have are all strictly based on

yeah, i heard it being called "glass"--although i think that's a variety
rather than a blanket term...i know a couple friends of mine in the SF and
LA scenes who've started using--college students and reasonably
well-adjusted people.  yeah, they use for weekend thrills, but the point is
they use, and more than once. 

and the funny thing is, all the scare stories and warnings of addiction and
comedown and paranoia haven't driven the idea from my mind.

i want to try speed.  for the experience.

isn't it strange?  actually, all this talk about it has brought the idea to
the forefront of my mind...

I think this is just a part of our culture.  It ha \s and will always be
there.  The groove is in the room, so you should be able to catch it

you can't emphasize this enough...i've experienced the exact same 
things...

<rant><preach>

i've been going to parties here in Colorado for about 5 years now, and it 
wasn't until about 3 years ago that crystal hit Colorado.....*hard*.

Three summers ago I began dating a girl who was a coke dealer (I didn't 
know it until we had been dating a month -- she hid it well, initially -- 
at the time I was foreign to coke and afraid of it and didn't want to be 
involved with someone who was attached to it)....Soon after I reached the 
point of being fairly committed to this girl, she and her circle of 
friends dove full-on into crystal. Within the course of 3 months I 
watched her change into a cracked shell, burned from the inside out. I 
watched her and ehr friends spread the evil antivibe of crystal (IMHO it 
is simply evil incarnate -- not to be dramatic, but, if you've 
experienced anything like I have, you understand) throughout Denver's 
scene, eventually reaching people who, at the beginning of that summer, 
seemed like their happiness, their love, their vibe was too strong be 
consumed by crystal. Crystal just sets fire to your mind, heart, and 
soul. What's left after your two-week long binges is the ashes of what it 
means to be human. 

Physically removing her from the crackhouse she lived in, taking her 50 
miles south to her Dad's house didn't help. I was sort of hoping the 
phoenix would rise from the ashes, that being so far removed from the 
drug and her friends and dealing the shit that she -- and the rest of the 
Denver scene -- would rise above it and return to the way thigns used to 
be. I distanced myself from her completely right here because I couldn't 
take the emotional strain, I couldn't keep feeling responsible for a 
person who was so beyond irresponsible, and couldn't keep feeling 
responsible for the circles of people sho sold and dealt to. I had 
already suffered an emotional breakdown trying to help her and my other 
friends. But within a week her crystal-head friends got her back to 
Denver. Within two weeks her binges were worse than ever. Within a month 
she was dating another dealer and was pregnant.

I don't even want to know what happened to the baby. And I can't even 
begin to picture what this ex-girlfriend's life is like now -- she either 
overcame it and became the beautiful soul she once was, or she's walking 
the streets of Denver talking to herself about walnuts (which, according 
to her after being up for 7 days straight one time, are alien pods 
planted on earth by an intergalactic police who are all out to steal her 
drugs. When the aliens hatch from the walnuts, they become invisible to 
most, but apparently they're always right next to us.) 

Sometimes I try and convince myself that crystal is just another drug. We 
delineate betwen the softy touchy feely puffy cloud "good" drugs and the 
evil bad nasty concrete jungle "hard" drugs, and crystal is just another 
drug. But I've experienced other "hard" drugs -- I've watched coke fly 
through the Denver scene on a silvery-chrome electric wave, I've seen the 
slow-moving deep pale blue shadows of heroin and the sickness of its 
recovery in our scene, I've seen the dark laserlight dimensions Special K 
offers up, but crystal in my mind retains its own blackness, it's an 
antimatter that sucks the goodness out of the earth and its people. 
That's all it is when you look at it on that level.

I don't usually preach because to me usually nothing is worth moshing in 
the pulpit for, but this is, in my mind, the closest thing to an evil 
I've experienced. 

I recently returned to Colorado after a year of living in Fremont, 
working in SF and the valley, and there's so much good and real about 
rave and ecstacy culture in the Bay Area that I've wanted to share with 
Denver -- we have so much to learn from you SF Ravers, you're 1 1/2 steps 
ahead of the world. When I came back from Denver I figured, "ok, Denver 
is probably catching up with the way SF and LA's scene have moved towards 
being more candy/penny-ravers, more politicaly active, more positive, 
more real and accepted." But at my first party back in Denver, I had 8 
young girls -- fresh from shopping at Contempo/Wet Seal, fresh from 
sneaking away from Mom & Dad to steal the car and go party -- ask me for 
crystal. It's a shame SF is seing a resurgance as well.

but we can conquer it. 

</rant></preach>

much love and real hugs.

have a  positive, safe and vibey weekend.

Wow!

Great turnout for a weekly 21+ jungle party. 

I didn't expect that many people to show, so my expectations were low. Tuns
out, a lot of "the family" showed up.

Y'know, a lot of the familar faces you saw a few years ago at the House
parties. Well now they're shakin' to jungle.

And the vibe was DOWN. Way down. No bullshit here, folks! It's nice to know
a vibe with genuine sincerity still exists out there.

Adnan had free food (the tabouli was AMAZING!), Om Records was giving away
tapes, and lots of smiles!

Hot damn, I think I'll go next week too!  ;)

Don't have the v-mail, but they're at Kate O'Brians every Thursday, 10p-2a.
I think it's $5.

hey guys,
    sorry i sent a message without a reply earlier. i accidentally hit
the wrong button. in regards to this whole crowds around the dj thing,
i know that i only get annoyed if i'm trying to get my groove on and i
keep getting shoved by *ssholes who can't trainspot in an orderly
fashion.
     on the other hand, i do agree with john that the groove and the
vibe you are feeling are what you make them out to be. just thought
i'd add my $.02.
     i hope to see some of you south bay ppl. over at the velvet shop3
year tomorrow. right front speaker family will be grooving in full
force around the dj.

>yuck.  =[



I've always wondered why folks in the throes of the 7-Day Bulging Eyeball
Syndrome start to imagine electronic surveillance devices...implanted in
the radio, the telephone, the clock radio.    I understand the concept that
a paranoid person would imagine that they are in trouble with the law or
the intergalactic space cowboys,  but the repeating  hallucination  that
they are electronically wired is fascinating to me.

Kind of like the DMT/alien thing.  I mean, there are a million different
things one could hallucinate:

  o  picnic tables square dancing
  o  staplers making love in Jello bowls
  o  ski hats sword-fighting  with Broadway theatre tickets.

why does the brain select aliens?

and why do tweakers imagine cia bugs in their light sockets?   i guess it's
their attachment  to electricity and electronic devices that interests me
the most .

it's odd that the collective human unconscious latches onto such images.

or,  is there really something on the other side that the sober mind cannot see?

Hey everyone, I was just on the toilet reading this internet mag and I 
came across somethingLabeled  "A New Danger In Drug World Spelled GHB"  
They refer to it as "liquid E" but I have never heard that way of 
describing it.  If you want to check out this dumb article that was 
written by someone whos probably never smoked  some pot it's on page 28 
of October's issue of THE WEB MAGAZINE.
Later,

temptation is hard, isn't it?  so many things seem appealing, especially in
the short-run.  like spending the money we should be saving, like eating
the chocolate cake we'll regret later because it keeps us from losing the
weight we want, like having another martini because it seems like fun and
then we're sick (yeah, yeah, that's me).

and some of these tempting things almost seem to have a life of their own,
waving that temptation in front of us, offering more fun, more time to
party, a chance to be one of the crowd ... their own little marketing
campaign built in.

saying no to these temptations isn't easy...  in fact, it's fucking hard.

and the hardest ones to resist are the ones where there is little gray area.

you might be able to have one bite of chocolate cake, or spend a little
money on a treat and save the rest....

but the reality is there isn't much gray area in highly addictive drugs,
and to me, crystal/crank/coke/et.al. is the absolute worst, because the
first thing it does to your mind is make you think you're completely in
charge *and* make you lie about the effect the drug has on you.

ever notice how people never come up to you at a party and say "hi, i'm on
speed, are you too?"  it's always either not spoken of at all, or mentioned
with embarrassment.  it's a drug of denial in every way.

and extended use will make you crazy, folks.  picture a healthy totally
cool 35-year old marketing executive who starts using crystal and becoming
what she perceived as the queen of the sf nightlife scene.  she was my
roommate.

one christmas day (when the rest of the world was with friends and family
and having good times) i came home to barricaded doors and her delusions
that people were waiting at the front door and there were cops watching our
house from behind a car parked nearby that she was watching out the window.
her downward spiral was painful to watch, and since i didn't use speed, she
didn't think i was as "cool" as she was, so i moved.

I just want to say that CRYSTAL METH is nasty. Personally I'd much rather be
sleeping or eating.                BECCA

Vertigo's time slots for Life Force have been moved by those scoundrels who
don't know a peak dj when they hear one... (just kidding, sorta)   :o)

   friday.....10:15pm -12:15
   saturday..4:30am-6:30

if you haven't seen Vertigo in action, check him out!  He does this thing
where he turns his brain into a sphere and splits it in half so that the
two side of his brain can separate the sounds of each record.  The result?
flawless mixing.

personally, i think it's a dangerous way to mix records.  but it seems to work.


check him out.

I think you meant, sitting in a corner shuffling cards while the secret
agents lurk just outside and you're wondering with what you think is that
back of your mind but your actually obsessed with the fact that the
fuckin drapes don't close all the way, in fact they leave about an 1/8 of
an inch open and even though you're not doin anything wrong they really
should close all the way and the sun coming in is reminding you that it's
daytime, and that's not a safe time for you to be outside because everyone
can see that you're a victim of the people, the people who run from the
light because the light doesn't feel good anymore and you smile, but only
because you think somebody wants you to smile but you know damn well
you're alone, in fact really, really alone... yet somehow you wish you
could be just a little more alone until you get a chance to sleep for a
day or two and get back in the rut with everybody else, not that you miss
them, but you're tired... oh wait, I don't have to be tired, I can go back
into the bathroom, the secret place where I go when I need to sleep but
decide to divert the need, and you go and you lay out that rail and you
look at it and it's so pretty and perfect and you go to suck it up, but
you smell it from afar and the smell makes you twist with sickness and joy
at the same time, because it's one thing to be on a bender but it's
another thing to be on a bender and not have any so at least you're not
pathetic like them, so you look around for a straw or a dollar bill, but
you throw those away because only a tweaker leaves shit like that around
so you reach into you wallet and find a bill and crank it up and shove it
up your nose and go to town, and it doesn't even hit your nose anymore, it
feels like it sticks to the bottom of the front of your brain, and it's
not about asking yourself what you're doing anymore but rather finding a
way to keep your body from folding in half from the rush and the pain at
the same time and you tell yourself "what an amazing drug" that can keep
you awake and keep you from being human and weak by sleeping defenseless
from the evils of the world should they come... and hurts me at the point
of entry rather than later down the road but little do you realize that
yes, it makes you not human, it tears away at your ability to feel and
maybe someday somebody will take the time to tell you that you're turning
into an asshole, but that's okay because they're an asshole for not
understanding you and not acknowledging that you're still in control but
you really don't care because you're getting the smell of ether down to
the bottom of your lungs, even though they don't feel like lungs and you
know you're not falling asleep anytime soon.

And I ask the musical question, what the fuck are you doing?

Come back to the living, flush it down the toilet, it's not worth anything
anyway. A drug that cheats you of your dreams has nothing to do with a
scene about love, understanding and making the parts fit.  Drink some
water, pick up a book, and get sick of your eyes tweaking on the page
until eventually, you feel the urge to sleep for a long time.  When you
wake up, we are still here, we love you, we always did but you scared us.
Be strong and together, you don't need to be scared and alone and this is
the first step.

The drug sucks.  Some drugs eat seratonin receptors, some drugs eat brain
cells, some drugs just make you eat, but speed sucks away your life, and
the potential for abuse is so high that I have to make a blanket statement
of "quit while you still can", and if you haven't tried it, please don't.
I was very addicted a couple years back and it is now nothing better than
two lost years, and a handful of crazy Hunter S. Thompson-esque stories
that aren't worth anything but scaring people.  Crystal Meth in it's
purest form has a list of temporary and permanent side effects and risks
that goes on for days, as well as the fact that most speed is made by
tweakers who skip steps and leave it smelling of ether, benzene and other
impurities that are outright poisonous to all living creatures.

And for those of you who think tweak, gak, glass, crystal and crank are
any different from each other, open any book, or have your fuckin brain
checked.  Methamphetamine in any form is just outright harmful, and
although you may not believe that you'll live to be 25 like I did once,
you might, and you don't want to hate yourself for causing damage to the
body and brain you will live in for the rest of your life.

Peace,
AndyW

i met this guy recently who claimed to be on "liquid e - i poured it
into my eyeball..."  he was completely out of his mind, though i'm not
neccesarily saying that's bad.  the thing was, his behavior didn't
really match the patterns of any other drug i'm familiar with.  what
is this stuff?

jeez, all these new drugs around, i think the times are more decadent
than we realize - like living in rome at the height of the empire or
something.  anyone know where the orgy is this weekend?

if you think he's kidding, he's not .... so make sure if Vertigo's wearing

	Any drug you put up your nose could in theory be put in the
eye as well, but SHIT that would hurt for some things. I would put
money on it being acid, since that is one way it is distributed (and
damn I wish I could find it) and that is actually the usual way for
taking it in that form. Much quicker to take effect, and also very
easy to get more than you intended...

andy hawkes and andy w, you have written two of the most moving and
well-written posts I have ever seen on SFRaves...

it's clear that personal emotion and experience has made you both speak up
so eloquently...

is everyone listening out there?  do you hear that these posts are coming
from a place of love and concern?  do you see that your actions hurt those
around you who must witness your fall?  do you see how pathetic the
addiction is when you look at it in retrospect?

we can't tell each other what to do.  we can only make our own choices ....
but i know that the choices i make can set an example for others.

when i was offered coke the other day, i was conscious that, even though it
was a tempting diversion, saying yes would have made me a hypocrite.
practicing what i preach (and yep, i do tend to preach  ;^) is too
important if i am to have any credibility ... and the same goes for each
and every one of us.

because even if it's not you that falls into the downward spiral, it will
be one of your friends, someone you love.

do it for yourself ... but if that little voice in your head gets weak and
you can't hear it telling you that you can be strong and resist ... think
of my voice, too, and andy's and andy's and all the people who love you
.... telling you that you *can* be strong enough and you *can* love
yourself enough to win that battle.

wouldn't it be great if we *really* showed the underground dance community
around the world what makes san francisco so special, and we -- each and
every one of us -- make a commitment to resist the darkness and heartbreak
that this drug spreads?  now that would be about love and unity!

love, leslie

I agree!
(IMHO) A person is only as good as his word. This is something I live
by
and apply to everything,from showing up somewhere on time, to being an
honest person, to just coming through when you say you are going to.
With this drug these things just don't seem important and they truly
are.

problem is, here, "moderation" to one is "overdose" to another.  and
there's little predicting it.

and an overdose on ghb puts you into a coma.  yeah, you'll wake up in a few
hours, but in the meantime, your friends freak out cuz they can't wake you,
if you're at a party, they'll probably need to call 911 and have you taken
to the hospital, and the party may be over because of it.

really fun, isn't it?

i especially love when the overdose victim wakes up bright and bushy-tailed
and says "wow! i was really asleep!" and has NO idea that their friends
have been worried out of their minds for hours, and that they weren't
asleep, they had overdosed.

or they're in a ghb coma and the party's over, but they can't be roused.

hopefully they don't wake up like that in the emergency room (and by the
way, if you're under 18 and taken there, and your parents don't come get
you, then you go into child protective custody.  oh boy that's fun, too)

ghb probably won't actually kill you.  but please, don't do it at parties,
because you may ruin everyone's good time.

leslie

(oh yeah, second problem is that your info on what GHB is is incomplete ...
and to me, if you don't have full information on a substance, you shouldn't
even consider doing it.  period.  the Just Say Know program has begun
creating flyers of information on substances, and their ghb flyer is quite
informative, or check some web sites)

okay, i realize this is very heartfelt for a lot of you, but with all the
back and forth on it all, this is what i get:

1. some drugs are good
2. some drugs are bad

3. this is not objective, this is based on personal experience and deep
heartfelt emotions and personal convictions...

unfortunately, NO ONE is able to dictate whether a large group of people
will all be able to intelligently make the decision to use or not to use...
case in point:  the uselessness of DARE and the "drug war".

nor can you tell someone ahead of time whether or not to make a personal
choice (although as much as we'd like to sometimes - we've all seen friends
fall)

and as much as we'd like to spread the love and the message and keep our
friends from harm, there's not a hundred percent chance that they'll 1)
listen to us, 2) feel the same way, or 3) take your word as their own -
sorry, but I haven't seen Jesus yet, and I still don't believe in him.

and, even worse than all that, even if your friend makes a wrong decision
and fucks him/herself up for it, it's not always the case, no matter how
much you love them or try, that you'll be able to pick them up off the
floor of hell, either - unless they're so goddamn helpless and rockbottom
that they realize they need help and can't do it themselves, but they know
that they sincerely want to put the effort into getting off of whatever it
is.

if someone decides to get help because you've been pestering the hell out
of them with your worry and concern for so long that they want YOUR pain to
stop, it's likely to happen.  And once they get you out of their hair,
they'll go back to their nasty habits...

seen it happen.  (unfortunately, i actually caused it to)...

as much as we'd all like to have a lovely world where bad drugs are gone
(this is a perfect world i'm talking about, so we'd all agree on what we
thought was bad), and good drugs are free (a personal opinion i think would
be nice in a perfect world hehehe), and everyone exemplifies PLUR,
eventually we all look at that southern baptist preacher and realize he's
full of shit, get our ass off the pew and go find out what we think for
ourselves (at least I personally would hope)...

that may sound harsh after some of the really gutwrenching emotional posts
on here, which are obviously based on personal experience, but a few things:

-we gotta have faith in each other to make the right decisions for ourselves
-we gotta realize that part of the reason a lot of us are involved in this
is cuz you can do your own thing and be accepted for it
-we gotta realize that other people's mistakes will eventually hurt us,
unfortunately, in some way or another and that's part of life.  it sucks.
but this is the reality we generally deal with on a day to day basis.

again, i apologize if i sound like a hardass - and again, i can't stress
enough, that you don't have to agree with me either, that's why this is a
FORUM for DISCUSSION.  and like a lot of you, the above ideas rang true for
me because they were based on personal experience.  and because i chose to
make my own decisions.  and because i'm a strong person.

	Very true. Even if you have taken it before, unless this is
from the same batch as the last time. Even then, other things you may
have drank or eaten can affect how the same amount from the same batch
affects you this time. This is true for a lot of drugs, if not all.

	"coma" is stretching it a bit. The person is passed out not
quite the same as a coma. And alcohol does that very well, too.

	If you are at a party, and your friends know you took GHB, and
you pass out, and they freak, you have some clueless friends. Not that
I am advocating GHB at parties in the slightest. If for no other
reason than if you pass out, you are FORCING your friends to watch
over you, make sure noone robs you, rapes you (I have very strong
feelings that that almost happened to me at an e-bay party last year
when I had foolishly partaken in something that had no business at a
party, which is why I won't ever go to a party held in the e-bay
again. I don't like the crowd or vibe they attract - sorry if anyone
has a problem with that), etc. etc. and just how much of a "friend"
are you to do that to someone? And if you aren't awake before the
party ends then they have to carry you out and take you home till you
wake up, an even bigger imposition.

    Leslie> really fun, isn't it?

	Not as fun as being so into alcohol that you go through a
bottle of 151 every 2 days and one day half come to while you are
strapped down to a stretcher being wheeled down the hallway and
then fade out and come to as someone is shoving a tube down your
throat and you are trying to jump up and tear their throat out
but your tied down and theres this tube in your throat and they
can't hear you cussing at them and you are convulsing so bad you
really couldn't have gotten up anyway and maybe it would just be
better to go back to staring at the water spiraling up into the
drain in the ceiling cause it is so pretty and you wish you were
spinning up there with it and god you're so nice and numb.

    Leslie> ghb probably won't actually kill you.  but please, don't
    Leslie> do it at parties, because you may ruin everyone's good
    Leslie> time.

	I totally agree. There are some things that go great at
parties, and E is definately one of them, IMHO, followed by weed. But
GHB, acid, PCP, ketamine, mushrooms, DXM, those kind of things I jusr
don't think are apropriate or safe to use at parties. It brings things
down for everyone else to have to deal with you, you may wind up raped
or robbed, and, IMHO, they just work better in private or in a small
group of friends at someone's house where there aren't going to be
strangers around and if you pass out someone can just throw a blanket
on you and let you be.

> 1. some drugs are good
> 2. some drugs are bad

	As someone with some experience in this area, I'd like to
weigh in. I don't use drugs at all anymore, but I've used speed &
lots of other things in the past (this is true, not just ass-covering
in case the list is monitored.) Personally, coke was much more of a 
problem for me than speed was. Why? because I liked it a lot more, so
I did a lot more of it.

	I think that the main problem with speed is that it keeps you
from sleeping & eating. Go without fod or sleep for 3 weeks & you'll
look like a speed freak even if you don't touch the stuff.

	Anyway, I'm not arguing that speed isn't bad for you. It is. But
people react differently to different drugs, and some people will be able
to take or leave it.

	What I am arguing with is the flip side - the smug assertion that
speed is bad *but the other drugs are OK*.

	For those of you who are or will become addicted, here's a simple
rule - what drug do you love the most? That one is the one to watch out for.
The drug you like the best, the one you do the most of, is the one that will
get you.

	Rob

curious, and not just on a social level. ready? here goes.....

to belong to not just one, but ten. you have to be the BEST, not good. you
have to SUpERFaST, not quick. you have to be happy, not normal. you have
to here, now. you had to be there, then. you have to be ....etc. 
how can i do this? i kNow! speed/coke/crank, that'll keep me up, that'll
keep me going. with this, i can do it. without, i'll FAIL.

the real stuff would do. thankyou, so incredibly much, for saying what you
said and saying it from the heart. you have killed my curiousity....and i
love you for it.

con amor y paz

I'd rather pester them to stop than just sit back and watch my friends 
waste away to nothing.  
My younger brother looked like he had just stepped out of a picture of a 
holocaust victim, when I finally did something about it.
Pestering isn't enough.  I pestered, he promised.  that worked oh so 
well.  So I destroyed his life (or at least that's what he was screaming 
at me when I told him), I narc'd him out to our parents.
He almost looks human now, and sometimes, the smile isn't fake.
And one day, I'll be able to look him in the eye.

I have faith in others, but you also have to live up to their faith in 
you to help them when they need it.  

And it's not just crystal/speed/etc.  You can do the self destruction 
jag with anything.  even, oh my, e.  Especially e.  Cause you feel so 
wonderful and happy, and plurrrry, and you have all these friends, and 
they think its okay, but it's not.

If your life revolves around a drug, there is something wrong.  
When you can't handle the next week unless you get so much partying over 
the weekend, there's something wrong.  

This scene is far from perfect, but just about all of us have had some 
experience dealing with addiction.  Don't we owe it to our friends to 
help them avoid it, or pull them out of it.  At least to try?

It's a hard topic, apology accepted and unneeded (but probably best said

And the strong survive?  or do they...?

*matter timidly types some wack inquiry, which develops into a somewaht
disgusting tale... press <DEL> now, if you are afraid you might be offended*

	Uh, am I mistaken or is there a huge amount of effort spent on
being inoffensive within the SF "scene" and this list? I feel huge amounts
of acceptance with my new SF friends and I never worry about offending
them... should I? I mean, maybe even this inquire will be offensive to
somebody? Perhaps, we should all do nothing for a while... Well, I guess I
am pretty confident that I am not too horribly offensive, but you just
never know what might make somebody feel offended...
	Heh, I was at some crazy party in Bezerkly, where this d00d took a
glow stick, dropped his pants and held it with his butt cheeks while
dancing around! Then, after a minute or so, he drops it on the floor and
picks it up and puts it in his mouth! Everyone laughed in disgust and
amazement of this drunken fool. I am sure many were offended, but he was
never even asked to leave the party... which probably would have been
different if it were my house.
	The beauty of it is: So long as we aren't hurting, threatening,
slandering, etc. anybody... we can enjoy our freedom and do whatever we
want... maybe in many cases -> alone. I'm not sure I have a point, besides
accepting your honest opinions... :) Any?

peace,

Um, I wasn't trying to be the catch all end all, I just felt I should say
my peice, because I don't trust the DARE program, I don't trust your
friend who is telling you it just keeps you up, I don't trust the parents
who say all drugs are bad (but take your Ritalin, honey), I don't trust
the dealer who says this is clean shit and I don't trust the methhead who
claims as long as you do pure meth you won't get tweaked out.  Maybe
somebody trusts me, because I party, I'm not an old/new skooler, I'm open
with my views and feelings on things, etc.

Sharing my perspective is as at least as valueable as you undermining the
commentaries of others and going on about the perfect world we obviously
aren't in. Suffice to say that perhaps somebody trusts my
opinion, or has seen themselves close to the situation I described.  This
is not a perfect world, very few people die from doing one line, but there
is a pattern to amphetamine use for many people unlike most drugs out
there, and I though I'd share my experience.  It's not harmless in certain
situations and those sitations can arise rather quickly.

There are people ON THIS LIST, in this community, at our parties, people
that some of us care very much about who are already established pattern
users of speed.  It is for them I sent that post.  Search your feelings
and ask yourself if you should say something to these people, or just run
to an anonymous forum and post your rage about the drug nobody admits to
doing.

There are DJs who can't seem to quit the shit on this list as well.  Users
of coke and crystal, full of life, and with heads full of egocentric
ramblings about a world where their needs are paramount, regardless of
their ramifications.  People who are becoming detached from their
feelings, and spend time thinking of how they should seem to feel, rather
than feeling as a prelude to thought and action.  People who live in the
stimulus/response trap that is addiction.  Some of our youngest, most
talented, most popular and inspiring individuals are having trouble
keeping the peices together.  There comes a point when you wake up feeling
groggy, and if you do a rail you feel normal, a little more aware.  This
point is addiction and comes VERY quickly with methaphetamine for a good
portion of the population.

I shared my reason for not doing it.  It is because it has done things to
me, that MAY happen again if I use again.  I could probably talk myself 
into the slight exception and get away with it, that one incident, but
I won't, because that space was so ugly, so lonely I would not risk it by
doing the smallest bump, the thinnest line.

Despite the rush, and the promise of being awake when I lack the strength,
I would rather fall asleep in the sand at a beach party and be laughed at
as Andy aka DJ Narcolepsy (it's happened) than risk going through that
again.  I saw that drug cripple the Dead tour scene in 89, the goth
/industrial scene in 91/92 and I've heard about what it did to this scene
in 93/94, especially in LA... anybody see a pattern here?  Get wise.

I'm not polarizing the issue, any drug can be a 'bad drug'.  I know
stoners who need to get on with their lives, I know people who do E every
weekend, and almost seem miserable when they're not on it.  There are
people in every walk of life who are sick with alcohol addication, an
ingredient in my favorite *Guiness* which I so dearly love, but few are as
sick and damaging as the path cut when speed comes through town.

Peace,
AndyW

Since when has methamphetamines not been a part of the goth scene? Here or

every one makes their own choices, but check out my story.  Over the last two
years I have realy tried to be more true to my self.  I have not put anything
up my nose and I have also came very close to not drinking spirits.  It was
the music back in 92 that began bringing me to my current reality check.  I
still hit the buds, but i have come to  peace with my self about this because
there are a lot of positive effects of pot.  So here I am in 97, spinning
records for a couple years, being myself, just being, and all of a sudden
WHAM!!! BIG reality check,  I find out my girfriend for 3 years has just
tried or has been doing speed(crank,meth,DOPE!!!). I lost my shit, I cant
hang with this.  I have spent several years of my life turning my
evil-vandalism-drug-dealing-life around hoping to stay as distant as possible
from shit like this.  And now someone so close to me has lost all my trust.
 She did not come to me and tell me "Hey I got this fucked up urge the other
day to do something stupid," no, I found out from her friends and ceased the
dope out of her purse my-self.  She lied to me and told me she would never
think of doing it.  She should know better, we live with her mom who vaccumes
at 3am and looks 60+ when she just made 50.  I am having so much trouble with
this and I dont know where to turn.  Sometimes I wish I could vanish
completely into the underground( im all ready half-way there).  All i am
lacking now is more family , and i know they are out there.I feel i should be
going to these raves by myself, not bringing my girlfriend or any other
un-adjusted people.  I want to meet more hard-core people that dont go out to
parties for the drugs or even the music( it all kicks ass anyways!) but for
the LOVE!!!! THE FIFTH ELEMENT!!!!!!!!!!  That is my high-wire now.  I love
music, I love all organisms, and most of all I love myself and the creator.
 Self confidence is the key to happiness, and if you are happy you should not
need any of those
hardcore-laboratory-chemical-dirt-non-organic-shit-drugs-interfering with the
most valuable gift, your mind!!!!       PEACE LOVE AND OPEN-MINDEDNESS
            RUEN ONE

drugs. good drugs? maybe those that are prescribed to you for a
reason. i'm on several of those, and they've saved my life. but they
are good only for me and other ppl like me. i don't think drugs are
necessarily bad, either. if you're going to use them, do a little
research before hand. what effect does it generally have on ppl? and
keep in mind that we all have a different body chemistry, so the same
drug won't affect me and my friend in the same way. i have my own
opinions of which drugs are 'bad', and this is only because i've seen
them literally destroy ppl close to me. and don't fool yourself, _all_
drugs if used in excess can and will destroy you. maybe i'm fortunate
that i have seen a lot of people totally lose themselves to one drug
or another, and i've had my own share of experiences of losing myself.
and no, when i was 18, i wasn't about to listen to someone tell me
that this or that was dangerous - i had to find out for myself. i'm
rambling on, as usual, but what it all comes down to is that all
drugs, alcohol included, can be deadly. just be aware of what you're
taking, and be aware of your own limitations. and really, try to
experiment with new things in a safe setting, around ppl you would
trust with your life. because that's what it comes down to. you're
playing with your life. especially with illegal drugs. you don't know
what it is exactly that you're putting into your system, do you now?

i just had some disturbing news relayed to me about an old friend.
he's in prison due to his drug use. no, he's not dead. but i'd say
that his addiction has destroyed his life. another old friend i hear
is still alive, and just knowing that much puts my mind at ease. he
never expected to live this long. i've had 2 friends lose their lives
- one was directly related to drugs, and another probably wouldn't
have taken his if he'd had his shit together a bit more. and i won't
go into the relatives i've lost to addiction. 

it's not a game, all happy happy all the time. despite what it may
look like at times. drugs will inhibit your thought process to the
point that you will no longer be the person you thought you were. and
this is a scary thing to go through. you stop caring. period. if this
is what you're looking for, then hey. party on blindly.

be safe - e. :)

yeah that was my first thought, but usually people on liquid acid are
pretty laid back, this guy was pretty chatty (in a not quite but
almost coherent way) and fairly mobile - basically he didn't really
come across as someone who was tripping, or if he was there was
something else involved.  i might have guessed some sort of lsd/meth
combo, but "liquid x" was distinctly mentioned.  and now i hear about
it on sfraves.  so what are it's effects?  was that what he was on? 
or was he so drugged up he didn't know what the hell he was on
(possible, but somehow i didn't think that was the case)   

basically, whats the scoop on this GBH stuff? 

i'm only asking cause i'm trying to decide what drugs my church is
going to endorse as "god-approved"...

People, It's okay to make jokes, but my post wasn't intended as a joke.
I am really serious about this. Imagine yourself in my shoes:
You go away for 2 weeks for vacation and find out that 20 or so of your
friends have become addicted to Crystal. I don't mean using it ever so
often I mean buying $100 or so of it and using it all in a week!
This is scary and it makes me upset. These are people I love and I would
much rather they hadn't started on it.
Love,
Paul*E*Wog

This is true! I totally support the freedom of choice, but this is a
scene where unity is one of 4 the main ideas, so when one person has a
problem they affect us all. This is not just their problem, it is our
problem as well because when we see someone throwing thier life away in
this scene they are also throwing away a piece of our heart. Every
friend has a spot in another friends heart. 
Love,
Paul*E*Wog

Somone emailed me in private with this message because they did not want
to send this email with their name attached over SFRaves.
Here is a very meaningfull and wise post by an annonymous person:

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

--------------
Paul,

Do you drink coffee? You may have noticed the prices steeply rose
about a year ago and have since been rising. The reason - Columbias'
main resource "Cocaine" is not doing so well. Why buy overpriced snow
when
you can cook up a batch of Crank for a third the Price? Besides the
fact
that it is 10 times more physically addicting than heroin. Which is
great for the dealers because it takes such a small amount for you to
become addicted. This is a fools drug (and I have been the fool before)
college kids take it to stay awake and study, people use it as a
weightloss program, and some ravers use it as a means to stay awake
all night and dance. No matter what reasoning you have, it sucks, I
agree 
with you 100%. I did not post this to the list because 1) most people
don't want to be told that their drug is bad and some people say all
drugs affect people individually 2) I have no room to talk, I have
used it in the past. I can tell you this, the world is too populated,
its going to find a way to kill off a lot of people so it can survive.
This
drug is going to be one of its means along with aids and some other not
so pleasant things. I am glad you choose to be strong, remember this
if your friends don't listen get away from them no matter how much it
hurts
that shit can only bring you one step closer to death........

Yes, Liquid E is the right term for it. Although it is far from it.
Myslef, never having tried it so I am not saying too much, but
all i know is that recently a very large batch of GHB came into a harbor
in SF. Be carefull who's water you drink from at a massive. GHB is a
liquid and people put it in their water. It is used a lot in New York,
known as Liquid E.

This is some very real shit....especially the last coup[le of lines. We 
all search for ways to help our friends end their battle with SPEED...but 
sometimes they don't want to. They'll lie, steal, and hurt you through 
the ntire ordeal. There sometimes comes a point when the only thing that 
you can do to help the person is to force them away from you, in an 
attempt to destroy their support network. Without a net to continually 
fall into, people become resourceful again...they have to eat, sleep, and 
exist....and making them achieve these things on their own is sometimes 
the only path towards success. It is in some ways our way of allowing our 
friends to feel the ground as they are hitting rock bottom.

Peace,
ES

	Um, buying $100 in a week and doing a first time bender is not
the same thing as being an addict. Wait and see if they do it
again.

Hey I'm not exactly like a person you described below, but I'm 21, I like
dancing (hey you know why I go to raves and clubs?  Coz I like dancing and
meeting people!!!), I like glitters just because I like em, I like
hardcore and progressive stuff, especially jungle, and my dear roommate
and friend is like that, too!! (Though she's not 21 yet.)  But who really
cares about age?  Anyways, it'll be fun to see you at some rave or club.
If you are interested, email me at 'maruyay@sonoma.edu'

I went to "transcend' about two or three weeks ago, and no one (seriously)
was dancing there but me and probably ten other people.  It sucked!! 

yuko :)

Hey Kids...hopefully i'll be seein all ya'all tomorrow nite in Monterey :o) 

My mommie gave me this...i thought it was kinda neet-o...

ATTITUDE

"The longer i live, the more i realize the impact of attitude on life.
Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the
past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than
sucesses, than what other people think or say or do. It is more than
appearence, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company... a
church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding
the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we
cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot
change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we
have, and that is our attitude...i am convinced that life is 10% what happens
to e and 90% how i react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of
our attitudes."  --Charles Swindoll

OK take care all of you and have a great weekend doing whatever it is exactly
you do...oh and on monday...
HAPPY AUTUMN!!!!
ByE
lovez!
JiL

p.s. did i ever tell you i was a psychic genie?...well i am...i just found

Now, I think I'm a pretty accepting fellow, but I don't really know how 
I'd react to that anal/oral glowstick trick... I don't think I'd ask the 
guy to leave, though... I'd probably bust out the video camera and 
suggest he do it again and ass it to my visuals tape...

geezeummmm... =)

GHB is like one of the safest drugs you can possibly take, you just have
to know how to use it! the problem with the drug is that potency is
usually never the same, so you have to expeiment with dosages with every
batch you get. ie. you get a bottle of it, take a small amout (a cap
full) wait a while, if it doesn't do anything, take a tiny bit more, and
keep doing this until you get the effect you want. 

Caution: if your buzzing good, don't take anymore, cause it won't fuck
you up that much more, it'll most likely put you to sleep.

once you've figured out your dosage, you can always take the same amount
for the same buzz, you don't get a tolerance to it, but if you get a
different batch of it, you have to figure out your dosage again.

Please don't experiment at a party though, cause it can cause it to get
shut down!

Please becareful out there.... =)


oh yeah and if you plan on trying GHB go here first and learn about it!
as with any drug, you should learn as much as you can about it before
you try it! 

http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/ghb/


ps. no flames please.... I just put on flame reflectors, if you flame
me, it'll bounce right off and back to you! =) try me... I dare you ;)

GHB is completely metabolized into carbon dioxide and water, leaving
absolutely no residue of toxic metabolites [Vickers, 1969; Laborit,
1972].

southern baptist preacher) anyway...

a mass exodus of people leaving shortly, i can smell it....

Let it rest.

I'm off to roni size.  I need to go dance.

I know this is totally Non Rave Realated. But I often hear grumblings
towards Corporate America on this list so I thought it would be nice to
point out an exceptional case of the contrary.

Ted Turner, founder of CNN, just announced that he will donate 1 Billion
dollars to United Nations humanitarian efforts and encouraged other
wealthy americans to do the same. Thats almost a third of his wealth
(3.2 bil).

Hey hey y'all.

	After being away for a coupla dayz, its suprisin to see so many drug
related posts... good. I'm in agreement that amphetamines can and most
of the time, will be, the devil's drug. There's an article at the
lycaeceum web page 
	  http://www.lycaeceum.org/drugs/synthetics/amps/builtforspeed.html

	that deals with both sides of speed... the ugly nasty fuckin abusive
side and also the side that the drug was originally concocted for...
thought maybe some of you might want to take a look.
	I remember talking to somebody about the scene in another city and how
they have pamphlets circulating around about commonly used drugs...
short and long term effects... they said it helps them out in educating
folks about what the drugs do. Personally, when I was first hearing
about certain drugs, I didn't know what stuff I heard about the effects
of those certain drugs to believe and what not to believe, I felt like I
needed to 'experiment' and my experimneting did get out of hand <to put
it mildly>. I think they have a good thing goin on out there... make
people see what its all about with the written word, so all of us don't
need to run the risk with 'experimenting' to see whether we like it.
	Or has handing out drug effect pamphlets been done before, out here?
Maybe we could do it again... not everybody has a computer to use as a
reference tool.

        Hey, I thought that was what I was doing by stuffing my head
in the woofer? ;-) And, uh, guys; you don't know what you are missing
out on not having breasts to feel thump with the bass washing over
them when you do that...

Well, I don't have breast, but I did have my nipple pierced.  What a feeling
that used to be with your body bent down and your head stuck in the woofer.
Can you say vi-vi-vi-vi-b-b-b-b-er-a-tion... Oh what a feeling. :)~

or a twelve hour party - c'mon, some of older, lethargic types can
obviously see a need for you-know-what if we are expected to make it
through twelve hours of chaos...

personally, i rarely stray that far from home these days so i don't have to
put myself in that position...  i am getting to the point where six hours,
four or five of those spent dancing my ass off, are getting to me...

luckily, when i hang in new york and party, i can do this, and take a taxi
home instead of getting behind the wheel of a car...

>> Herion use is up to.  It seems there is a form of 'snortable' powdered
>> herion.  The kids are using it & saying its ok because they are
>> snorting it instead of shooting it. That really scared me.

yeah, here's the deal - it's the same heroin, just a lot more pure and
that's only due to the ways of the market and the abilities of smugglers
and factories...  and snorted, generally it's a lot weaker of an effect -
again, you can't get addicted to snorting heroin by doing it once...

several months ago i was at a get together with a bunch of south american
kids - figure out parts of that yourself and take a wild guess at what we
were doing...

i went for a line of what i thought was columbian suger, and next thing you
know i felt surprisingly light and fuzzy...  almost like i'd smoked a
joint, but, lighter and fuzzier...

what was "addictive" here was the fact that here i was, just did a "rail"
of heroin, and after the initial freakout when i found out it wasn't what i
thought i was (boy was i pissed, i had always said, "I'm never doing that,
I'd like it too much" after all these orgasmic references - think
trainspotting here)  - I found myself saying, "Wow, that's not bad at all,
not as intense as all this documentation made it out to be, and hell, i
feel DANDY.  I COULD DO THIS ALL THE TIME."

THAT was where the problem was.  It's readily available, and we have a big
conspiratorial media push a lot like what's happening on this list -
supermodels giving interviews in every beauty magazine in the book, new
york magazine doing coverage, etc. etc. - so, lots of curious cats get
interested...

again, what it boils down to is personal choice and maturity...  a few
years ago, and this was documented on hyperreal for a long time, a girl
calling herself China Girl od'd at a large 3-day outdoor gathering called
Interstellar Outback in Kentucky...  she died, and after a guru from st.
louis and half the kids who came with him sat and meditated, she came back
to life, but not after being carted away in an ambulance...  if the letter
that she wrote, which also ended up in urb, i believe, is still around, a
lot of you, especially the younger ones, should take a read.

this girl was no idiot - nor was she a drug addict, or a heroin addict.
she was a user of pharmaceutical grade, clean substances who made a one
mistake...  use any drug at all, and you put yourself at risk for
something... 

hell, step outside your front door and you run the risk of getting run over
by a car or something...  live in fear?  that's not the answer... 

take too much Aleve, you could hurt yourself.  Just because it's legal and
prescribed by a doctor doesn't mean it's not dangerous...  And if you think
our pharmaceutical industry or our medical fields aren't corrupt, ask me
personally, and i'll tell you about a few things.  i spent a while at an ad
agency that marketed these prescription drugs to the medical field, in
order to influence them to push them on their patients.  Because they were
good drugs?  Not necessarily - because Proctor & Gamble, Merck, and other
companies have an agenda, and it's not to make you feel better.  The one
good thing about things that come from pharmaceutical companies is that
they're not cut up with bathtub substances before you get them.

education is the key here, not an "underground" anti-drug movement.  and
the good folks at hyperreal, who've given kids all over the country the
ability to read and discuss this stuff, have provided more than enough
information for us to know what we're doing to ourselves when we feel the
need to expand.

still trying to figure out this rocket mail - where do the original
mssgs go??? anyway, re: ted turner's 'donation' - yes, tax write off,
and no skin off his back. (please, giving a million dollars to him is
like me giving a dollar to a bum on the street) even better is all the
'good' publicity it will give him and his companies. it's called
marketing, folks. 

cheers - e. :)

I think the amount was Billon with a B. And I don't understand why you
would rush to discount such a gesture. There are a millon other things he
could do with the money if he wanted tax shelters/write-offs.

Hahahahahahahh, last night, myself and two girlfriends of mine went to go
BOOGEY.  We were all slow and didn't get to STEP2K until about 1, and then
that was great, but it could only go until 2.  So where could we go?
These women were hyped on REDBULL n GIN, can you feel me?  They wanted to
go beat out and get down.  So we were going to go check the Richie
Superhhawtin thang.  But it was already 2:30 and it was like money and we
knew that that particular spot usually turns into some strange sort of
RAVER OVEN.

And I had three free VIP passes to PRODUCT at the almighty SOUND FACTORY.
I got them way early in the summer when I was at the STARLIGHT room on top
of the Sir Francis Drake above Union Square (which on a Wednesday
coincidentally is great fun, if you want to see a completely different
scene).

So we went to product, me and two other jungle heads who happen to be
ladies.  And I just wanted to thank the Gods of Lurk.  That was the
lurkiest thing I've ever seen ever in my entire life ever.

Except the part that was lurkier than I had ever dreamed anything could
ever be, in terms of unadulterated lurkiness.


Thank you.

DUH,
MAX

i'm not discounting his gesture. a billion dollars over the next
decade, and it will go to help the 'poorest people in the world, the
people who need it the most.' and i suppose it is a fair chunk - the
article i read on it states that it's about a third of his wealth.
leaving him with ... 2 billion. my point is that it's not a big loss
for him. and that he gets front page coverage for his gesture, while
there are a *lot* of ppl who give their more valuable time and aren't
recognised for it at all. i'd be really impressed if he had done it
anonymously. but no, he made an *announcement* to the media and to the
rich. (show and tell anyone?) yes, more ppl with his standing should
do such things. but they should do it because they want to help, and
this they could do anonymously. don't you think? as it is, no, i'm not
impressed. but then i'm not often impressed by the super rich and
their monetary gestures. as i said, and this is really only my
opinion, it's no skin off his back, and it does give him some mighty
nice media coverage. i'm not discounting it; it is a big help. i'm
just not bowled over by it... and not surprised that he's getting
front page coverage for it. disgusted, more like. is his donation more
important thatn all the other news that really should be getting front
page coverage? (but then again, i don't see the news value in chelsea
starting at stanford, either. :P page 11, and very small: news on the
nea; a bill to protect abused children... pg 17: civilians killed by
security forces in india; bomb explodes near bosnia  police station,
injuring 50.... and not to mention all the news that isn't supposedly
'fit to print'.)

cheers - e. :)

woo-wee. steamy in there...even hotter than lepidoptera (same space)...
and silly me was wearing even more clothing (not hard to do ;-)

Thermal intensity aside, what a party! First time seeing Richie...and
all I can say is that it was quite nice of him to visit our humble lil
planet for a night.

temptation is hard, isn't it?  so many things seem appealing, especially in
the short-run.  like spending the money we should be saving, like eating
the chocolate cake we'll regret later because it keeps us from losing the
weight we want, like having another martini because it seems like fun and
then we're sick (yeah, yeah, that's me).

and some of these tempting things almost seem to have a life of their own,
waving that temptation in front of us, offering more fun, more time to
party, a chance to be one of the crowd ... their own little marketing
campaign built in.

saying no to these temptations isn't easy...  in fact, it's fucking hard.

and the hardest ones to resist are the ones where there is little gray area.

you might be able to have one bite of chocolate cake, or spend a little
money on a treat and save the rest....

but the reality is there isn't much gray area in highly addictive drugs,
and to me, crystal/crank/coke/et.al. is the absolute worst, because the
first thing it does to your mind is make you think you're completely in
charge *and* make you lie about the effect the drug has on you.

ever notice how people never come up to you at a party and say "hi, i'm on
speed, are you too?"  it's always either not spoken of at all, or mentioned
with embarrassment.  it's a drug of denial in every way.

and extended use will make you crazy, folks.  picture a healthy totally
cool 35-year old marketing executive who starts using crystal and becoming
what she perceived as the queen of the sf nightlife scene.  she was my
roommate.

one christmas day (when the rest of the world was with friends and family
and having good times) i came home to barricaded doors and her delusions
that people were waiting at the front door and there were cops watching our
house from behind a car parked nearby that she was watching out the window.
her downward spiral was painful to watch, and since i didn't use speed, she
didn't think i was as "cool" as she was, so i moved.

and she's not the only friend i've lost that way ... and yes, it is lost,
because to a speed freak, everything is secondary to the drug.  sorry, but
i've learned that there's nothing in it for me to hang around and be
"supportive" because unless someone has committed to freeing themselves
from this drug, there is no support you can offer, because they don't care
about you or anything else.

and for those of you who "occasionally use in moderation" ... maybe you're
one of the lucky ones.  but maybe you're only lucky so far.  is it really
worth that risk?  does your sanity and your health really mean that little
to you?  because remember, the first thing this drug does is make you lie
about it.  to yourself and to your friends.

saying no isn't easy.  i still get offered bumps or lines occasionally,
even though my friends know i'll say no .... but there's always still that
moment of temptation, hmmmm, maybe, since i could dance longer, and it
would feel good.... but i know that there is no "maybe" in this choice.

sorry, but with speed, there's *nothing* good about it.  and i mean
*nothing*.

here's wishing you the strength to love yourself enough to do what's really
right for you,

leslie

okay guys, RONI SIZE - Reprazent...

i'm only calling it wimpy because it's not like the normal techstep i've
been shaking my butt to lately, but it's GOOD...

cd #1 is full o'vocals that aren't even cheesy - she kinda sounds like
Eryka Badu (i hope i spelled that right) at times and it gets kinda R&b'y
(they're from Bristol, it's understandable)...  it even breaks out from the
"this is drum & bass" beats to some hip-hoppy and even borderline "breaky"
beats...  The MC is cool although he can be a bit "conrad-y" at times...

cd #2 i wouldn't DARE put near a dance floor - but right now i'm sitting at
home and i have to say you could smoke some serious marijuana while this is
on...

I AM glad my boyfriend was the one who spent $34 on it tho...

NEW FORMS is of course, one of the most important electronic music albums
of the year, and not particularly wimpy, nor r'n'b, nor anything else
besides a truly ground-breaking effort getting awards such as the Murcury
showered on it everywhere.

It is an album for people who appreciate music.  Yes, it has more acoustic
drums and stand-up bass, and a more organic feel than most recent jungle
releases.

Then again, it is not a dancehall album, that is what remixes (see
Grooverider's remix of Share The Fall from this album, an absolutely
STOMPING new anthem from over there) are for.


I would be surprised to see if many jungle headz would call this shit
wimpy though.  It's Roni Size, he's always been a little bit past gun talk
and hardcore tech sounds.

DUH,
MAX

Thanks for the un-hysterical GB post. You might want to check out the Just
Say Know webpage (http://www.sirius.com/~hr4u) for further unbiased factual
information on GHB, crystal, ketamine and more to follow. Have you seen the
informational safety fliers out in some of the clubs/parties/stores? It's a
campaign to educate people so they can make their own decisions based on
facts, not hype or stuff people think will sell magazines or get TV ratings.

Also, I agree with Leslie on her earlier points about the destructive nature
of crystal, however I'd just like to add that I think there are many more
occaisional recreational users who never develop a problem than you think -
its just that you never see them or notice them the way you do the lost
souls....
One reason is they feeled compelled to lie or keep their use quiet is not an
effect of the drug, but because they know the reaction they get from their
peers will range from disapproval to rejection to disgust or worse. The worst
case is always assumed and projected onto people even when they don't know
the person personally or outside the party/club environment. 
The Urb magazine article put it best "its not the drug. A drug is an
innanimate object - as dangerous as a head of lettuce until put into a
human's hands. Ultimately the responsibility comes down to the individual".
It is time for each of us to take responsibility for our own actions and not
place blame on the drug. I'm not advocating the use of crystal or any other
substance, and truthfully it seems for a lot people its a ticket straight
down the toilet - but who's to say they wouldn't have bought that ticket
somewhere else if crystal wasn't around?
Learn to love yourself and enjoy all aspects of life without drugs first,
then know and respect the substances you are using.
That's my 2 pennies worth  - check out JUST SAY KNOW

Yeah, so I've read that short thread about throwin' the party for
everyone, including the physically and mentally disabled.  Then I
thought, hmmm....since I myself am a disabled student, I knew that I knew
a very large amount of disabled who are involved with Programs and
Services.  N E Ways, if this goes through just thought I'd let the ones
throwin' this know that I have contact with many disabled college
students who may be very interested in this.

Sooo, well, talk to you all later.  Hope you all have a supEr weekend.

P.S.-  I made my first half-decent mixtape today.  It's some cool
ambient.  Mainly a journey through FSOL and B-12.  I like it.  Not a
whole hell of lot of mistakes, but much room for improvement.  This

Thank you for bringing this up. Recently a campaign called JUST SAY KNOW
began distributing drug informational/safety fliers to clubs/parties/record
shops etc. The first one in the series is crys, with more to follow. The goal
is to let people know what they might be getting themselves into, then at
least a person can make an informed decision for themself. Because not all
relevant info can fit on a flier there is a related web site on
http://www.sirius.com/~hr4U

People have been using substances for thousands of years -- its illogical to
think or even necessarily want them to stop - education, self-love and harm
reduction is the way. Celebrate life through dance and pass on some Just Say
Know fliers if you find them at a club.......  thanks  jd

And don't watch the movie "The Game" with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. 
Man, that movie just straight warps you mind.  By the time the end of the
movie roles around, you're feeling so paranoid (yes, I was completely
sober) that you feel like everyone's out to get you.  I don't know,
basically, the main character gets so fucked over during the movie you
start feeling like you're the one who's getting fucked over.  If you're
going to watch it, take some Prozac before-hand or atleast go sober, it
won't be so bad then.

I don't know, just thought I'd warn ya'll.

dErEk

P.S.-- As I'm proofreading this message, I'm beginning to think I'm
advertising the movie more than warning people about it.  N E Ways, don't
watch it.

Dear SFRavers,

I have come to realize something important this weekend.
The society we live in is corrupt. The government, the way all religions
has evolved from what they used to be, they way our parents, and grand
parents, and great grand parents were raised, and even the education in
school is corrupt.

Why do people go to raves?
They go to escape to a world that is just, sympathetic, unprejudiced,
and forgiving in so many ways. All of us in the scene know this. We have
come to realize it. Some, knew this from the second we stepped foot in a
rave. Others, needed time, and patience to understand it. 

We are born with 5 senses that handicap our 6th sense. The 5 senses are,
sight, hearing, taste, touch, & smell. The 6th sense is what all of us
call "vibe".  Our mind, body, & spirit create our vibe. Can you see a
vibe? No. Can you hear a vibe? No. Can you smell a vibe? No. Can you
taste a vibe? No. Can you touch a vibe with your hands? No. Then, which
one of our senses absorbs someone's vibe? Which one of our senses gives
of a vibe? The 6th one. None of the 5 we are born with lets us do that.
It is very hard to shut down those 5 senses and just use our 6th to
communicate, understand, and love each other.

All of us in the scene know how to let go of our 5 senses and rely on
our 6th. That's what we do when we rave. Still, we can not let go of the
5 that are used by the rest of the civilized world. Civilized World? I
am so sure! The rest of the world creates war, poverty, evil, and the
most terrible thing in life, money! If we did, let go off all
inhibitions, and pre-judices in the un-civilized world, it would all be
used against us. In the uncivilized world, kindness, is viewed as a
weakness. There for, we must be mean, rude, and never reveal the true
kind person we are. We must live with a huge front to protect us from
the society we live in.

Since, we are not born into a rave community, we must go through the
most influential parts of our lives (childhood) in the uncivilized
world. Us ravers have no earth or land of our own. We have no place to
truly call home. We have no place to live, where we can be who we are
and not need front. We need to live in a rave, where life is as it
should be. But, because the uncivilized society is afraid of us, they
try to shut us down. They force us to leave @ 7:00AM every Saturday
morning because, by law some us must go to school (where we learn
nothing about "vibe") or to a job to earn money (root of evil) to
survive in the uncivilized world.

I am only 16 and still haven't figured out everything. I am not mature
enough to grasp all this and because the un-civilized world believes
that minors are minor in every way, including their thoughts. I wish
that sometime, someone, anyone, all of us would start a fund to buy an
Island big enough to hold the vibe of ravers all over the world, where
we could raise children the right way, with the freedom to expand their
minds, body, & spirit that society will not permit us to do. I am not
saying permanent happiness. If you are constantly release happiness then
you will explode from not releasing any anger. Anger is not evil. Anger
is very good. Without anger there is no happiness.

One of the most interesting things about the fact that I have finally
come to realize this is the way I did it. By means of which the
uncivilized world frowns upon. Ecstacy & Mushrooms. Two drugs which are
forbidden in this un-civilized society. Ecstacy gives us the courage to
be ourselves. Mushrooms give us the power to expand our consciousness on
a level of high spirituality and and self religious emotion. There is so
much evidence of the positive effects of these drugs. And, so very
little of the damage it does to our health. Yes, they both change around
our neurotransmitters in our brain. That is because of the accelerated
learning we do on them. If I feel I have gotten such a positive
enlightenment from something that the uncivilized world views dangerous,
I must ask myself, why do they view it as dangerous? And the answer is
because they are afraid, afraid that we will realize what I have. That
they are screwing us so bad and it must stop!!!

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

I don;t mean to come off as too something, but I think that this is the
difference between the jungle scene and the quote unquote raver scene.  I
think you're right Mister Wog, I think people go to raves to escape.  And
I think that people bang out to jungle to cope, to try to go harder than
the world which tries to make our lives routinal and tries to make us like
it (in terms of predjudices and anger and other assorted evils).  Does
that make sense to anyone?

"Raving" is about losing yourself to a different world.  Jungle is about
rising above the world you live in, and raising your fist in unison with
the good parts, and in opposition to the bad.

I might be whacked here though, WARNING.

DUH,
MAX

what's up Paul.

I hella feel you on the points you made in your posting,
but this "forbidden" culture that we are in is in its infancy,
just like rock and roll  was once a taboo.

In the future people will realize there is a lot of good values to be
learned at raves ,
especially through  music and the understanding between people.

This world is not ready to accept drugs such as E and mushrooms to be a
learning tool for society. This is a sober world, the "other side" is
there to inspire and envision us.

I guess you saw this world as it should be, and hopefully it will be
like that someday.
Till then we should make the best of this evil filled world, 

It would be unproductive if everyone was always high,
and who would get up at 7:00 AM to go to school and learn how to make
the drum machines and keyboards that make the music, the turntables and
speakers that make the sound, the bricks and steel to built the space
where the party 's at. To make sure the records get pressed, and  to
make sure there's electricity to power the party.

It all interconnects.
 Reality is  big ball of shit that's rollin' and you can't stop it.
might as well have fun!

Pete
Reality is a sandwich I DID NOT order!

Okay, I have been doing some research on hyperreal and there are some
old posts to alt.drugs and some articles saying that there is a chemical
in bananas called bananadine. It's supposedly has almost the same
structure of DMT and is a relative of the Tryptamine family. The reason,
eating bananas do not get us high is because it's in the peel of the
banana.Yet, you need to do all this soaking in chemicals over night to
secrete the bananadine.  Also, bananadine is only active when smoked. I
dunno. I am really curius about this because it's legal.

Also, there is supposedly something in Nutmeg that is quite similar to
(methylndioxyamphetamine) MDA. Not the same stuff, but similar. It saids
you need to buy a raw nutmeg and eat 20mg of it. Well, I said, what the
heck and so I looked in our cabinet for raw nutmeg but all we had was
the Trader Horn powdered kind. It said there was 22.2mg of nutmeg in the
container so I opened it up and poured a little in my mouth and almost
gagged! It tastes really bad. I got some a cup of water and poured the
all of the powdered nutmeg in the water and threw in tons of sugar. It
was still a little difficult to get down. In like 45 min or so I began
to feel just light headed and I got a very small tingle threw my body
and for some strange reason I seemed to ever so often see small "trips"
out of the corners of my eyes. It made my stomach really hurt and it was
not worth it. Maybe I did it wrong.

It's also legal to purchase San Pedro cactus seeds and plant the seeds
and let them grow. For those who don't know, San Pedro cactus contains
mescaline. You can purchase 100 seeds for $5. You are suppose to cut the
cacti and leave 1/2 left at the bottom for another cactus to grow. Then
you pluck all the seeds, peel the skin off the cactus and you cheww it
up reall good and swallow. Then you eat the fleshy inside and I suppose
in a while you should be tripping. Hmmmm?? 

That's not all? If you go and purchase morning glory seeds and plant
them. Then pluck the seeds from the flowers that grow. Put 4-8 seeds in
your mouth, chew them well and then swallow. If you don't know morning
glories contain lysergic acid amine. That's just about the same as LSD,
but not quite it. The trip is suppose to less uneasy than LSD.

Wow! I never knew that all these legal plants that you can own can get
you high. But, I dunno about the bananas. If you know something about
that, reply to this post in open form.

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

nah, i dunno about whacked but this will be a fun one to discuss...

i'm just wondering why there is such a "rift" between "jungle" and "raving"
- they're both styles of music to dance to, and both of them came out of a
sort of "let's flee from the club/everyday shit that's provided since it's
not suited to us" - raves, you had kids breaking into warehouses so they
could throw parties and have the freedom to enjoy themselves the way they
wanted to...  Jungle, you had street kids taking the music that was already
out there and making it into something that fitted their own tastes and
lifestyles...  

sorta sounds the same to me...  either way, it evolved into the same thing
- to me, either one is about rejoicing in the face of reality's "bad shit"
and having a good time -although at this point in my life, yeah i'm leaning
towards the jungle thang because i'm sick and tired of coming out of "rave
utopia" and being faced with a double comedown of painful doses of reality
- i think i'd rather just walk out of a jungle event and think, "Yeah, I
had a good time DESPITE the 16-year-old crackhead with child I'm stepping
over at the moment."...  and personally, i'd rather go to a party that had
two rooms so you could get a bit of both...

dori
*still trying to understand why there are people out there who can't like
both house/techno AND jungle without putting a rift between the two*

i guess i'm just glad people are finally taking it a step further...

the recipe for doing the banana peel shit is in anarchist's cookbook...

tried it, never could get it to work...

nutmeg is widely used in prisons as a desperate attempt...  the painful bit
is typical...

I remeber in middle school i heard a rumor that you could get high by smoking
the tip of a banana so i dried out  a bunch of bananas but never smoked them
cause they got some mold on them.
As for morning glory seeds that contain  LSA (close relative to LSD), you
have to be careful about just eating the seeds or making a tea out of them
because the government laces almost all new seeds sold in nurseries and other
stores with lead so you either have to grow the flower and use the new seeds,
or find some that arent laced with lead. I wouldnt recomend trying this
unless you got a pretty strong stomach. LSA induces vommitting in most
people.
san pedro cactus seeds, along with shroom spores, dont contain the
ingredients that make them illegal, mescaline and psilocybin(sp). so you can
legally buy the seeds and spores and then grow them yourself. growing shrooms
is pretty complicated. heres are good references to check out if your
interested, http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/plants/mushrooms/gg32/mmgg.htm
http://www.fanaticus.com/pf-tek.htm
you can also get high if you chug a bottle of robitussin. it contains a
hallucinogen/dissociative called DXM which is supposed to be pretty fun.i
have heard that it is a lot like K or pcp, but it also makes a lot of people
throw up. If you have a scale that measures milligrams accurately you can buy
pharmaceutical DXM powder form from this company called Wanman Industries.
then you can buy your own little capsules at a health food store and take it
in pill form.
I have also heard of a company called Biogenesis that sells pharmaceutical
GHB, but since its an illegal drug, i dont know the reliability.
Also over-the -counter drugs such as dramamine, you know, the stuff you take
when youre feeling car sick on the way down the Santa Cruz Mnts., can have
psychedelic effect if taken in high doses. check out this reference

First of all, I want to point out that the idea that religions have
"elvolved" into their corrupt state is untrue.  Ever heard of the Christian
Crusades?  How about all those missionaries who "spread the word" by
forcing ideas on ancient cultures and robbing them of their trditions?  Did
you know that there was a time (long, long ago) that the Catholic Church
accepted donations which were supposed to ensure the donators place in
Heaven?  Even the poorest of the congragation were intimidated into giving
their earnings to the Church.  Oh, did I mention their donations were often
disguised as "mandatory" taxes?

And I would be careful in saying ALL religions are corrupt unitl you have
some more experience with them.  Western religion and culture is the most
corrupt of any in the world.  Do not assume all others are just like ours.
If you are feeling frustrated, you may want to check out some others.  New
memebers of any faith are always welcome.  I watched a show on PBS the
other night about Islam.  Very interesting people.  Fastest growing
religion in the world , right now.

You are so quick to let our ancstors off the hook.  The present is how it
is due to *everything* and *everyone* which preceeded it.  This crazy world
was given to us by those before us.

There might be more people in the scene who disagree with you than you
might think.  I have never thought the rave scene to be any of the things
you have coined it  as.  It, too, has it's corruption, prejudices, etc.  Do
not forget that ravers were human before anything else.  We are no less a
part of this world than anyone else.  We are no better than people who do
not go to raves.  I sense you passing judgement on non-ravers and I think
this type of judgement is the easy way out of confronting the real problems
of society, at large.  I think evryone desreves credit for the good they
do, where-ever they do it.  I cannot accept the idea that ravers somehow
are changing the world by going out all night and sleeping all day.
Escapism should not be rewarded.  It is running away.  People who have
dedicated their lives to teaching, healing, providing and helping, deserve
more recognition than you, or the rest of our society, are giving them.

I am not saying that all ravers live with these attitudes.  I have met
wonderful people who do wonderful things in their lives.  But I think it is
unwise to assume all ravers spread the "vibe" in the outside world.  This
is the real challenge: taking what you feel at a rave and applying it to
your life.  Don't you think people who don't rave deserve to experience
what you have?  I don't think you have to be at a rave to experience,
justice, unprejudice, sympathy and forginess.

I agree that it is hard to let go of the 5 senses.  But I should point out
that this which you describe above is the goal and premise of many
religions.  We ravers are not the only one's who know this "vibe" exists.
Others may have a different name for it: G*d, chi, etc.  Granted, these
religious structures may have problems, but I beleive many of the
church-goers have the same ideas of rising above the superficial, tangible
world, into the world of the spirit.

Sounds like you're giving in to those who dod not wnat you to beleive in
your true self.  I do not buy the idea that most of the people in the world
want this to happen.  The peolple who do want this, make themselves the
most visible in the hopes to have the greatest influence.  By giving into
their influence, you have let them win.  Now they have you right where they
want you - out of their way.  Do not step aside for them.  Continue on with
your true self, for it is the only thing that they CANNOT take away form
you.

Just a note about money...
it is NOT the most terrible thing in life.  I challenge anyone to come up
with a barter/exchange theory that would be more successful than the one we
have now.  I guarantee each will look like a winner unitl you introduced
GREED.  Greed is the problem, not money.  If greed were eliminated, money
would work for you.  And we are all guilty of greed.  Learning to live
simply is the key.  There is a theory of simple living called Afluenza,
which I reccommend checking out if you are tired of living in this material
world.  There are lots of books out on the subject of simple living.  One
titled, YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE, is especially good.  It is a guide for
simple maney management based on evaluting the worth of everyday things.
We are used to paying for convenience but we are not resticted to it.  We
*give* our money away for things which have been disguised as quicker,
easier, better, but in reality, they are not.

I understand your frustration with your age.  We live in a soiety which
shuns it's youth and it's elderly.  The only suggestion I have for you is,
please don't run away.  Make yourself visible to those who do not want to
see you.  If you make enogh noise, they will eventualy notice.  Things may
not change iommediately but people will have to take notice.

As far as buying an island and all that, you can start a collective living
unit right wherre you are.  People do it all the time.  Besides, wouldn't
you want all the "uncivilized" people to see the good your doing with this
style of living?  I think it would do everyone some good to see this type
of co-operation.

But if you were really stuck on the living-on-an-island thing, you could
always call up Marlon Brando.  Maybe he'd let you come and stay on his
private island for a while. ;-)

I don not claim to understand the motives behind the war on drugs.  But I
will encourage anyone who does drugs to educate themsleves about it.  I
think a lot of people have been pasing out a leaflet or flyer or something
called Just Say Know.  I don't remeber much of thisdrug-education back in
the days when I was raving but I think it's a great idea.

Educate the people so that they may rise up!

On that note, have a lovely day!

Many of the posts on this list revolve around the lack of positive
recognition the rave scene gets.  This is why I find it interesting that
some of us are having difficulty recognizing the good of another.  Why is
it so terrible that he wanted to be recognized for his contribution?  I am
not understanding this.  Granted, it is a huge tax wrtie off but I think
once people get into the billions of dollars, money seems to take on a
different menaing, or lack of.

I am not "bowled over" by his contribution, either, but I do think he
deserves the recognition he gets.  I mean, the media is going to inflate
any info they get their hands on, so I don't know why anyone is surprised
by this.  But he should be recognized for giving a billion dollars away,
tax write-off or no tax write-off.

   I think if I were to give away a billion dollars, more so 1/3 my total
monetary worth, I think I'd want some people to know about it.  Not so much
for the limelight, (I could certainly find cheaper ways for that) I think
just so that people know.  Why?  Perhaps in the quest of obtaining so much
money I took from the community and now I'm trying to give back.  Speculation
that's going waayyy off topic.  I'll be going now. :)

Many of the posts on this list revolve around the lack of positive
recognition the rave scene gets.  This is why I find it interesting that
some of us are having difficulty recognizing the good of another.  Why is
it so terrible that he wanted to be recognized for his contribution?  I am
not understanding this.  Granted, it is a huge tax wrtie off but I think
once people get into the billions of dollars, money seems to take on a
different menaing, or lack of.

I am not "bowled over" by his contribution, either, but I do think he
deserves the recognition he gets.  I mean, the media is going to inflate
any info they get their hands on, so I don't know why anyone is surprised
by this.  But he should be recognized for giving a billion dollars away,
tax write-off or no tax write-off.

Yes, i have heard about people smoking banannas... also about the nutmeg-
people in prisons snort for an easier, quicker high or you can roll it up in
a ciggarrete... because yes, even tho it is just an herb, it is poisoning
your body in a way, and that is why it has that effect on people.  For the
same reason mushrooms do! Rosemary can do the same things, if you ingest too
much.    
If you smoke mugwort, it has similar effects as marijuana, as well as being
somewhat more hallucinogenic.  So does sage, they enhance your dreams too!

The same articles that discuss his contribution also discuss his net
worth. So it's not a big loss for him. Should he have just not done it,
because it wasn't impressive enough?

I don't see what your problem is with this. He said "Here. Here's a
Billion dollars. I would encourage more wealthy folks to do the same." To
me that has much more value than doing it anonomously. He's setting a bar.

Uh, hello?! Ted Turner *is* the mainstream media, or at least a good
portion of it. Do you think he needs to make monetary gestures in order to
get airtime?

So he gets nice media coverage. GOOD! Because his message was to encourage
others to do the same. That is a message that SHOULD get media coverage.

Neither am I. However I do see it as a very positive gesture and it's
really sad to see so much apathy.

Of the aforementioned articles, which, if any of them had a positive
message? That makes Ted Turner's gesture front page material in my eyes.

Hello SFRavers -

 Looks like there will be a Sunset Boat Party next Sunday ( Sept. 28th ).
I'm making plans to go, but I have a question for those who have gone
before.

 I just went on my first off-shore fishing boat excursion on Thursday,
on a 65 foot fishing boat out of Half Moon Bay. Despite taking anti-nausea
pills before the trip, I was seasick for most of the trip.

 I assume that the Sunset Boat Party is held on a much larger boat, and
the S.F. Bay is much gentler on the inner ear & stomach than the open 
ocean. Has anyone had trouble with motion sickness on a Sunset Boat Party?

Hello all,
    I came to a realization this past week, and it was kind of depressing.
 The scene was starting to bother me and I was getting really cold towards
other people that would ask me what raves were like and "would I take them?".
 This is an aspect of my personality I almost never see.  I'm always the
happy one who's smiling and loves to talk with anyone about raving or just
random topics in general.  
    However, all of the comercialization and bad vibes that I used to shrug
off, I actually spend time focused on now.  Then, finally, I realized what
was happening to me.  I'm not a September Child anymore.  I lost all that
ignorance and PLURRY VIBEY LOVEY stuff I used to thrive on.  OH! and I miss
it so much!  If anyone knows where my innocence went would please carefully
wrap it and mail it back to me??  I need to be annoyingly cheerful again.  I
would appreciate it so much if you could help me out!  Taking the weekend off
seems to have helped, but I need a little extra confidence to find the old
TeknoDiva.  I love you all and I'll be myself again soon (I hope)

           hugs n'stuff,
               'trice the tekno diva                        <<<<RAVEON>>>>

Hey kids...ive had a bit of a rough weekend but heres a subject i'm certified
in :o)

>Also, bananadine is only active when smoked.

have any of you heard the Dead Milkmen song "Smokin Banana Peels"? Well the
directions to doing so are on the inside cover of the tape/cd...we tried it
once like 5 years ago, tasted like the worst poo ever and i don't recall any
sort of high off it, but everybody else got a good laugh over the fact that
we actually did it! :o) 

> It saids you need to buy a raw nutmeg and eat 20mg of it.

don't ever ever EVER try this!!!!! You will never be able to look at nutmeg
the same again!! Everytime i see nutmeg i gag...damn that poo is nasty,
especially in large quanities!!!! I all i remember is a massive stomach ache
and falling asleep on the couch, and this terriable taste of nutmeg
EeEEEewWWWwwWW!!!!!

>purchase San Pedro cactus seeds and plant the seeds and let them grow.

Last time i looked at my cactus...it haddn't grown in like 3 years, its still
3 inches high, this project could take quite a while....maybe it'll have a
growth spurt soon.

>Then pluck the seeds from the flowers that grow. Put 4-8 seeds in your
mouth, >chew them well and then swallow.

now this one i havn't suceeded, by the time our plants flowered we forgot

Ok time for me to go to sleep, you all take care and lovies and lots of

I would hope that it was said with a hint of sarcasm.  I can't see how
it can be anything close to intimate (in the crowds of people sense.)

i can only tell you what i know about sea-sickness... i went to
sailing camp as a teenager (shhhhh!) and they used to tell us that
sea-sickness came from fear. i really don't know if there's any
validity in this or not, but perhaps you're holding onto some
deap-seated fears pertaining to the water? not that you could resolve
them all by sept. 28th, but it's a thought! anyway, my mom used to
give us saltines and coca-cola for our upset tummies. it helps!

cheers - e. :)

The boat used for Sunset boat party is relatively large and stable (it's one of 
those Blue and Gold or Red and White boats down at Fishy Wharf).  However, it 
DOES rock back and forth, making for some interesting dancing at times.  I went 
to the last boat party, plus several parties on those in college, and each time 
I was VERY ready  to get off when it got back to the dock.  Drinking amplifies 
the effect.

IF you're really worried, there are small 3/4" circular patches you can buy 
that you place behind your ear that counteract the disequilibrium.  You may 
need to wear it for a day before, but they DO work.

yes thats right folx, i said god-approved speed!  i tell ya the
macroorganism that is you and i and all the rest of 'em has told me
that there is a BETTER KIND of speed than that awful crystal meth!

that's right, i tell ya GOD has said OUT LOUD that that crystal meth
stuff is fuckin' arwful shite! let me tell ya, i and i should know,
that cryystal is nothing more than SATAN"S CHARIOT!  and when you're
riding that 84 98 with the black paint job, the gold rims, the opaque
windows and the ripped black vynil interior, when your riding it down
route 66 at two hundred and twenty fucking bpm, make know mistake
whatsoever WHERE YOU'RE DRIVING IT! STRAIGHT TO FUCKING HELL!


now hold on there, messiah.   i mean, dancing all night on a beach
with 200 other plurry kids is a lotta fun, right?  and sometimes ya
kant score x or ya know it's just heroin and vivarin concocted in some
crackhead's basement, and you don't wanna do acid again cause last
time you're eyeballs were bleeding and it just wasn't, ya know, fun? 
and you just wanna get pumped up and dance all night, cause your dj
friend is spinning at like 6 and  he's gonna play your favorite song?

well obviously. whatta ya kneed?  

SPEED!


well, let me tell ya, there's WAY better speed to be had than crystal
meth!  that's right!  now what would you say if i told you that there
was a little yellow pill where you could take one, and by gum that
sucker would keep you up till the dawn's EARLY LITE, and the
AFTER-PARTY if ya feel like going!  that's right!  and what if i told
you these pills cost 99 cents for SIX of 'em!  that's right, 16 and a
half cents a pop!  all fuckin night!

naw, yer just pullin our leg, messiah.

nope, i'm not, and let me tell you something else!  what if i told you
that, after staying up allnight rolling around in the sand with your
friends, havin' a ball, after the party was over and everybody who was
too fucked up to drive had been safely delivered home by YOU, the
sober, wide awake one, after you got home and closed your door and
listened to a mix tape for a while, ya fall right asleep get a good
night's, and wake up on monday and do what ya gotta do WITHOUT EVEN A
HANGOVER!  no! the cops aren't after ya!  no!  there ain't no aliens
in the walnuts!  you wouldn't believe that ridiculous shit if you best
friend tried to convince you as a practical JOKE!  thats right, i'm
tellin ya ABSOLUTELY NO PARANOIA WHATSOVER!

nah.  yer jist havun us on, mate.

nosiree.  nope, i would'nt shit ya on something like this.  now you
listining?  you listining?  

shhhhhhhhhhhhhh....






NOW WHAT IF I TOLD YOU! ahem, what if i TOLD ya that you could get
this drug 24/7/360 fuckin FIVE!  the dealer is ALWAYS HOME!  that's
right, you dont EVEN have to CALL FIRST!  ya know why?  ya know why? 
listen, shhhhhhhhhhhhh....















BECAUSE IT'S ABSOULITY FUCKING LEGAL!  THATS WHY!  THAT'S RIGHT, I'M
GONNA SHOUT IT AT THE LOP OF MY VIRTUAL LUNGS!  ABSOFUCKINLUTELY 100%
COP-PROOF PHARMECUTICAL-GRADE LEGAL!


Ahem.

ok.  really.  this is the scoop.  the packet is generally bright blue
with flourecent yellow print saying "mini thins"  or "mini pseudo".   
you can get it at practically any 24 hour convenience store in the
united states.  the tech-name is pseudo-ephedrine - i believe it's a
decongestant/anti-asthma pill,  the way it works is it dialates every
membrane in your body , especially arteries and lung tissues, allowing
everthing to "flow" faster.    or something like that.  to tell you
the truth, i doubt if it's particularly good for you.    but it sure
the hell is better for you than crystal meth and the stuff they cut it
with in every possible way shape and form - i shit you not.  don't
take 'em by the handful.  it's unpleasant that way.  i usually take
1or maybe two, and i'm no wuss when it comes to these matters.  i
wouldn't combine them with other speeds either - that way you're less
likely to end up in an emergency room.  (have you ever hung out in an
emergency room on a friday night?  yoiks!)  well, take care with 'em
like you would any other drugs you take.

i hope.















i did not tell you this.

yay! what a great way to end my sf visit! jeremy threw a bombass party,
and if you didn't go, you missed out! :)

we (me, stariana, cricket, and sindhu) got to the mappoint right before
11pm, and after a minor hiking expedition, we got to the location itself.
the spot was just so beautiful, a big "sand pit" right by the beach. you
could climb up the walls of the pit and get down to the water. 
sound system wasn't up and running until a little after midnight, but
no one seemed to mind. it was just a lot of "good vibe people", and
we all just kicked it waiting for the music to start. ;)
the music finally started, and we were treated to some drum'n'bass. now,
personally i consider d'n'b to be chillout-music, no matter how fast
it is or how intense the bassline is. it's just really hard for me to
get in a "party mood" to d'n'b. fortunately for me (and everyone else
looking for some simple 4/4-beats), kid bippy got on the decks a little
later. his hardcore set was just so awesome! starting out with classics
such as prodigy's "everybody in the place" and human resource's 
"dominator", and then progressing into badass hardcore...it was one of
the best sets i've heard in a long time.
micron spun too. micron is the bomb, that's all there's to it. we love
you dan! :)
at the end of the night, we were treated to some nice d'n'b. by now
more than fifty percent of all the peeps had left, and those of us who
were still there were in a chillout-kinda mood, so it all worked out
beautifully. :)

what else can i say? lots of beautiful people, many of whom looked like
they've never been to a party before! it's always fun with people who
go to their first rave with a positive attitude and a good vibe! :)
i ran into _one_ sfraver that i hadn't met before (hi beth!). big ups
to all my other friends! i love you! :)

i think we're going to sunset tonight, then tomorrow i get on the plane
back to lovely sweden! i'm going to miss you guys, but i'll be back!
or hey, you could all just come to europe! ;)))

much love.

                CHECK OUT  www.partnercomm.com/~raveinfo/ 	


                  The RAVEDATA project needs your help!
 

 Some of you have seen our messages on the list, some can tell you how
they like using our "North American Rave Promoter Index" also known as the
"fonebook" to get connected, and still others might say how they have
enjoyed trading mixtapes and flyers with us...

 That's just the beginning!  We've been aggresively compiling data for
20 months, known as the Ravedata project...  We're just about ready to
present the result: the world's largest rave-oriented database -- tracking
all KINDS of information,worldwide!  Why?  

	1 - To bring more talent and energy together (unity)
	2 - To recognize those in the scene who have done so much
             (respect)
	3 - To factually "set the record straight" after a lot of bad 
             news media (peace)
	4 - To bring alive those memories of our favorite events gone-by
             and our friends who were there to share them with us (love)


If that's RAVE D-A-T-A, What's this RAVE I-N-F-O stuff??
--------------------------------------------------------
 Raveinfo is what we call our attempt to ask YOU for those missing
bits and pieces of information we've missed along the way.  We can't do it 
alone... So, check out the site and e-mail us with *ANY* info you may
have!!  We've just re-organized some things to make it even easier to get
around and will finish that up tomorrow.

 We hope you look forward to seeing the ravedata site sometime in December 
and requesting your copy of the Fonebook ('98 edition) sometime in 
January (as always, it will be free).

Thanks!!

Love and Lollipops-
  Matt & Nicole

hear hear. i go to raves to dance, to have fun. the only ideal i
attach to this 'scene' is hedonism. that's *all* it's about. i have
met some of the most corrupt people through this "just, sympathetic,
unprejudiced world". please. okay, so you're only 16. but this is
being naive to an extreme, isn't it?  as megan states, we're all
human. just like those "uncivilized" non-ravers. GAWD. can you see
what you're written? don't we sound like our white forefathers? i'm
_gagging_.  *shudder*.

no _shit_. what a farce.

yes, but isn't it *fun*? c'mon, folks. we all have lives, full of
problems, stresses, responsibilities. i love having the opportunity to
chuck it all out the window if only for one night. i had a discussion
with someone on this list once about why ppl seem to have the need to
validate their fun. my theory is that the protestant work ethic is so
engrained in our society, we feel guilty for wanting to have *fun*,
just for the sake of it. so we come up with all sorts of
rationalizations for it - yeah, we're changing/saving the world.
bullshit. we're out there, having fun, dancing our asses off, meeting
new people, enjoying the music. forgetting our lives for a night. but
you know what? it's _okay_ to want to have fun! really it is! you
don't need some cockameyme rationalization for doing so. but i digress.

unwise? no. naive? yes. but i find in this particular naivete some

and isn't that what's it's all about - finding some meaning, some
validity, and definetely some community. but i call to those of you
who are trying to gain meaning and validity in your life from the rave
'scene' to go look elsewhere. better yet, look within yourselves.
scary thought, there! i just can't see validating the meaning and
purpose of my life with an all night party.

okay, so i'm going to take this out of context for a minute only

you are *so* frightening. i don't think that when 'they' said 'love
thy neighbor', they meant only the one who was just like you. you do
see the hypocracy in what you write, i _do_ hope.

your thoughts ... hmmmm. well, i am not going to validate the above.
yes, it's true, that minors are treated extremely unfairly. (i could
turn the tables on you and bring up how minorities, no matter what
their age, are treated...) but you say yourself that you are not
mature enough to grasp all of this, and me... i'm nearly twice your
age and still so naive about things. but growth only comes when you
open yourself to it. please, keep your mind open to life. the world
will greet you with a mirror. embrace it, and for the most part, it
will embrace you. see evil everywhere, and sure enough, there it will
be! i used to have this big luvvie rottweiler - a big lug, a
sweetheart, sloppy with his hugs and kisses. but if kids in the
neighborhood walked by and were afraid, he would sense that, and
become afraid himself. life is just like this. don't be afraid. you
could miss out on some wonderful things.

uhhhhh..... i beg to differ. not that i can explain what exactly
they're doing to the synapses in our brains - i'm no neuro-scientist.
yes, the drugs have their benefits. but please don't fool yourself
about the effects they're having on your brain. they're *toxic*.

ahhhh.... there are many reasons that drugs become illegal. and i,
like megan, don't claim to know them all. i do know that there are
political motives behind declaring things illicit (and some that go so
far back into our history it isn't even funny), but i also know that,
at least with 'e', there are real dangers. i don't really know how
much research has been done on long-term effects of heavy usage -
maybe you're right and there is no harm. but i'd rather not be the
guinea pig for neuro-toxicity research. 

anyway, i've rambled on far too long - please don't misunderstand me -
this is not a flame. i am just concerned about what i've read here. 

cheers - e. :)

what a waste of money. get this: their info line said that "we made a
promise, now we're keeping it". they are SO FULL OF SHIT! the only
reason i went didn't show (along with others), and HA! *loved* the
shuttle that was promised from the bart station (we walked), and their
'complimentary breakfast buffet' consisted of some sort of packaged
creme pie like you might find at a greyhound station. and it was so
loud that i couldn't enjoy the music. really. why do people think that
louder must be better? the bass just sounded ugly. too much space for
too few ppl, and too many cops with billie-clubs. this will be my last
massive for a while. (sad that i'll be missing carl cox next week, but
if i'm to learn anything from the last 2 massives i've been to.... i'd
be better off at the movies.)

Hi Folks -

> it's at its normal spot then it's at Point Malata in Richmond. 

 Yup. Started at 2PM - if you go there, don't forget to park as far into 
the parking lot as possible, not near the entrance. It's almost always
the case that folks see a lot of cars on the entrance side of the parking
lot and assume the whole lot is full, and so park alongside the entrance,
which the park rangers don't like. I've seen the entrance clogged with cars 
and empty parking spaces at the far end of the lot.

> ...the buzz line # is 415.569.3300

 ...but that's not the Sunset info number. The message does have the 
Sunset info number ( said once , so have pencil and paper ready , or
record the message with your answering machine and play it back).

 The Buzz Line has old info - the Sunset message has been updated with the
location info for today's Sunset (Richmond), and has a description of their
upcoming boat party next week Sunday.

By the way, it's Pt. Molate in Richmond, not Pt. Malata , in case you're 
trying to find it on a map. HW 580 West .

 It's a very tricky exit - as you drive around the last corner from Richmond
to the Richmond/San Rafael bridge, you'll see the toll booths , and
the exit is immediatley to your right - last exit before the bridge!

Don't get me wrong!  I have had some really super super incredible
beautiful experiences with house music, with techno, with crazy Santa Cruz
acid break.psy-goa nonsense!

But I have never fallen into the whole "reconnect me to pigtails and
pacifiers, and let me ignore the reality of life around me, running from
the stress."  and that's why I can fit better into the house/techno stuff
than many "ravers" can fit into the jungle scene, in my opinion.

Jungle is a music that is often based on, and even created with stress in
mind.  It's fuckin gnarly a lot of the time you know?  Not happy.
Artists' conceptions of spaceships crashing into domed colonies, or
locusts descending on your evil-ass farm.  And THAT is why it's nice.  It
can be, for me, a way to get SO STRESSED out, and SO HYPED, that my feet
hardly touch the floor, and my heart nearly explodes, fighting against it.
Or am I fighting with it?  Or am I fighting IT alongside IT?

I am not saying that all jungle is war.  I'm saying the most jungle is
rough business, and doesn't take itself lightly, and doesn't care if you
don't smile about it.  It's just more attitudinal, I suppose.

ANOTHER point I've been thinking about is that although sometimes jungle
really unifies crowds, and people are all slapping each other five and
yelling beside each other, oftentimes, people are completely lost in their
own concentration on the beats.  To stay with their raggedness?  Because
the beats are like walls of sound?  Because there are other sounds hidden
in the first ones, and people are hearing them?

So, while I feel I am overgeneralizing everything, I feel safe saying that
jungle may be a little less PLURy (in the huggies candy toys way) than the
'raver' scene, I think that's because jungle reflects a life that doesn't
always want or need PLUR.  It mirrors the dirt on the ground and the
tangles of machete-requiring bullshit that we have to cut through no
matter if you hug us or not.

Ok gang...this is your chance to use collective Rave Vibe to help me out with
my traveling dilemma.

I'll be poking my head out from under the sand next weekend to take a gander
at the SF Rave scene. I'm scooting into town on Friday, (yes on a big Jet
plane) and all I want to do party and dance my ass off. I'm trying to get the
beat on the Cyberfest adventure and whether it's worth dodging gangsters to
have a good time and experience the local SF Rave subculture, or go to a
smaller club.

I've asked around via AOL, but I get mixed messages considering the pending
"massive" so I'm still in a state of rubber as to what to do.  Sodoes anyone
have any suggestion s on how to avoid the pitfalls of Cyberfest and still
have rockus time or should I grin and bear it and just go.

Hello San FranciscoI'm listening

Promises broken. ( no Keoki, and so much more ) NO FREE BREAKFAST! $3 water!
Seanie Boy and Rabbit In The Moon were pretty tight and were able to make me
and my company smile.

Bum party overall. Definitely NOT worth $25!!! I was able to meet some kewl
people and made the best of things...

I really do believe that 85th and Baldwin is a cursed location. There's
always something not right with the parties held there. It's either acts
don't come through, or there's absolutely NO vibe. I dunno why.

Anyway this weekend was a seminightmare I saw coming sometime, I never knew
when, but it hit me in the face. My friend' s and my parents have now
discovered that we are ravers...

That's it!
FOR NOW AT LEAST!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

For all those who went to Play Nice, I'm extremely jealous because I bet you
all had a wonderful time!
Sillier.....OOOOOOOHHHHH god. I went to Silly back in like April or May man,
that was such a good party!
I wanna hear other people's thoughts on these two parties and Lifeforce as
well.

Hi to Liquid, Mercury and Byroni!!! I hope u guys had a good time last nite
=]

Till then...
Spread some vibe...
Keep it alive...

Well, Rabbit and the Moon definately never played.  (They were there,
everything was set to go for them, but, they had some problems witht the
promoters.)  However, Skylab 2000 funked everyone up with an extra-long set
of hard acid brakbeat and trance.  They even played an old-school hardcore
anthem that I especially love to rock out to.  (This because there was no DJ
to follow them???)

Bassbin Twins also bombed the bass for a still dancing early morning crowd.
 It was the same set they played on Friday, which included among other
tranks, my favorite that goes "Nobody move, nobody get Burned..." and
something super funky using an old SKA sample.  

And I absolutley love the video projectors on all the walls.  

A word on the vibe...  I thought for the most part this party went off.
 Everyone who was there was dancing, dancing hard and doing some way cool
moves.  There wasn't alot of people crashed on the floor, or standing and
watching.  The crowd that showed up definately came to have fun and make the
most of a very poorly organized production.  But, hey, it was this promoters
first event.  And to do two in one weekend was quite a feat to undertake.
 Things are bound to go wrong.  There is a lot to do to insure that the show
goes on, and it must take trial and error to perfect the "massive
experience".  

I give it a thumbs up, mostly because the bands really gave it their all on
the performances and the dancers intereacted with the music beautifully

This is ridiculous.   Let's all give Turner a pat on the back, lots of
press, and a gold star.

Also, let's not forget the process by whic one man can amass an obscene
fortune worth three billion in a country with 35 million people going hungry
every day (yes, the U.S.).  Did Turner work to earn that money?  How many
hours a week would you have to work to earn a Billion?  Other people's labor
made that money for him.  He got that money, and they didn't. 

Give away a billion?  Great.  Now take away most of the other two billion
and leave him with what he earned through his labor, physical and intellectual.

The media will eat this up across the spectrum, whether he owns it or not.
The meadia is owned by and operated for other people of Turner's class, and
I bet they love to see how "generous" they are.  Gosh, aren't billionares
really just nice people?

OK.  I am out of bile.  Sorry about the rage, folks.

Peace and love (and I mean it!),

i'd end up rambling on far too long...  I understand you meant no harm (in
fact
the exact opposite), but i also understand that to a 16 year old w/ lots of
ideals
and fears your post would probably sting of some old fart who 'just doesn't

point is, without the (sometimes) naive attitudes that us youngins have, the

Secretly, deep down I hoped this would fail, so with a little joy I'm glad it 
did.  ALong with many on this list, I worry about the influx of corporate 
sponsors bastardizing the music and scene.  If Starbucks, American Airlines, Bf 
Goodrich (EHT), etc. etc. invest their money on this "rave promotion 
experiment" (or whatever they call it in the boardrooms) and the return on 
investment is minimal, they will divert  their money elsewhere and the scene 
will remain (relatively) untouched.

shuttle that was promised from the bart station (we walked), and their
'complimentary breakfast buffet' consisted of some sort of packaged
creme pie like you might find at a greyhound station. and it was so
loud that i couldn't enjoy the music. really. why do people think that
louder must be better? the bass just sounded ugly. too much space for
too few ppl, and too many cops with billie-clubs. this will be my last

it's all good girl.  i was the same way as you are. in fact i occasionally
get like that. sometimes i actually get annoyed with raving and every weekend
seems like the same ole thing. so what i usually do is take a big break from
raving, usually like a month without going. then i'm all excited to go again
and i miss it so much. that's the best advice i can think of, it usually
works for me. i also prefer to go to smaller parties where you can meet lots
of people and there's a good vibe. i wish you lots of luck.
lots of love and hugs,

Hello all,
    I came to a realization this past week, and it was kind of depressing.
 The scene was starting to bother me and I was getting really cold towards
other people that would ask me what raves were like and "would I take them?".
 This is an aspect of my personality I almost never see.  I'm always the
happy one who's smiling and loves to talk with anyone about raving or just
random topics in general.  
    However, all of the comercialization and bad vibes that I used to shrug
off, I actually spend time focused on now.  Then, finally, I realized what
was happening to me.  I'm not a September Child anymore.  I lost all that
ignorance and PLURRY VIBEY LOVEY stuff I used to thrive on.  OH! and I miss
it so much!  If anyone knows where my innocence went would please carefully
wrap it and mail it back to me??  I need to be annoyingly cheerful again.  I
would appreciate it so much if you could help me out!  Taking the weekend off
seems to have helped, but I need a little extra confidence to find the old
TeknoDiva.  I love you all and I'll be myself again soon (I hope)

      Well this is some incorrect info in the above statement.=20

1) In mini-thins there are two active drugs (Ephedrine 25mg and =
Guaifenesin 200mg). The generic name for one actually being talked about =
here is "Ephedrine Hydrochloride".  "Pseudo-ephedrine" is "Actifed", and =
if you bought "mini pseudo", you'd be buying  generic Actifed.

      Actifed is a decongestant, but is not an anti-asthma pill. This =
would be a good pill to take if you have a stuffy nose, not dance all =
night.=20

      Ephedrine is a broncodilator, and adrenergic. With this in mind, =
it's not the broncodilator that gives you "dance all night fever" it's =
the adrenergic. When a drug that has this property, and is introduced =
into the body, it cause the body to release it's own "epinephrine"

      Epinephrine is a hormone made in the human body. Another name for =
epinephrine is Adrenaline

>it dilates every membrane in your body , especially arteries and lung =
tissues

      The truth here is the Ephedrine actually cause the blood vessels =
to constrict, but at the same time cause the airways in your lungs to =
dilate, by causing the muscles in the lungs to relax.

You shouldn't take this drug if you have heart problems, high blood =
pressure, thyroid problems, or diabetes.

When taking Mini-thins, remember to drink lots, and lots, of water. Some =
things that can happen when taking this drug, nervousness, tremors, =
sleeplessness, nausea, headache, palpitations, rapid heart beat, dry =
mouth, large pupils, increased blood pressure loss of appetite. Rare =
side effects (if taken at the normal dose) include: chest pain, =
hallucinations, dizziness, difficulty urination, and muscle cramps.



>BECAUSE IT'S ABSOULITY FUCKING LEGAL!  THATS WHY!  THAT'S RIGHT, I'M
>GONNA SHOUT IT AT THE LOP OF MY VIRTUAL LUNGS!  ABSOFUCKINLUTELY 100%
>COP-PROOF PHARMACEUTICAL-GRADE LEGAL! =20

    Legal, for now. People in the FDA, are trying to remove this from =
the market. Due to the increased abuse of this drug.

In a message dated 9/21/97 7:10:43 PM, you wrote:

<<So how was the party?  >>
Um...it was OK, I guess. It definately suffered from a lack of organization,
though. I'm sure someone will chime in on that aspect, but bascially,
considering how the party began, it turned out to be a pretty OK event.

Micron, myself and posse arrived in Monterrey at around 11:30, just about the
time when Micron was supposed to play. We were told that the sound system
wasnt ready yet--there were a few extension cords to be found and the bass
amps needed to be brought to the site. We parked and walked over to where the
party was taking place. Now, if you've ever been to "The Pit" for a Cloud
Factory party or whatever, you know what this place is like. If you've never
been, well, let's just say that the name is very appropriate. A huge pit in
the middle of the sand on a beach.  The music comes on and people start
yelling excitedly that the night is going to finally begin. But the DJ on is
just the sound man, doing a soundcheck. Darn! Besides, the turntables had to
stands to be propped upon at this point, and those pesky bass amps hadnt
arrived as yet either. 

Soon after, they both arrived and it was time to get down to business with
some serious music by Re Ach. Re Ach laid it on 'em heavy, like he always
does, but some drama seems to erupt during his set(not really involving him).
Since the party started late, the DJ schedule was naturally pushed back. I
was originally scheduled to play at 2:30 but was now told that I would be
able to play until 5:30. OK.....pass me a Red Bull, Micron, this is gonna be
a long one! Well, I see some guy yelling at Jeremy and Jeremy, obviously
upset, responding to him. Turns out this guy came with Kid Bippy, and was
demanding that Kid Bippy be put on immediately to play. Re ach had been on
about a half hour at this point and sets were schedlued to be 1hr 15mins. I
didnt hear everything the guy had to say, but it was clear that he wasnt
happy and didnt care about the fact that the party got delayed. He didnt care
that all the other DJ's time were pushed back either, he just wanted Mr.
Bippy or whatever to play at the time he was scheduled, no matter what the
deal was. Jeremy didnt budge, nor did Re Ach, even though this guy asked Re
Ach to get off the decks after about 20 mins.

When this Bippy person got on, I couldnt believe it.


It was, IMO,  one of the worst DJ sets I've ever heard. Almost every track he
played was from 1992 or thereabouts. Rave techno, straight up. I vociferously
implored the Bipster to play something, *anything* from '97, to no avail. I
pleaded with him to rock a track from '96 maybe, but no response.  How about
'95 or '94? I gots no love, from this guy,  people!

I was appalled. Not only was this guy's lackey completely rude and
insensitive to the situation, the music this guy was playing was a lot less
than something to write home about. But hey? Who am I to say, if the candy
kids like it, let the candy kids have it, I guess, but how are you doing your
job as a DJ by playing records from 1992? If what we do is about progression
and experimentation and new forms of musical exploration, then where does
this fit? Sure, a lot of these kids werent around when this music first came
out, but they can find this stuff on one of a million CD compilations that
come out every week in record stores. I dont think a set of Rave hits was
appropriate given the situation. That situation being that the year is 1997,
not '92.

I'm sorry if I'm rambling, it's 11 pm and I havent had the chance to sleep as
yet. I jst had to share some thoughts about that party since Jen asked......

Ok, so the party had its techical difficulties...but then again, I try not to
rely too much on technology for my personal enjoyment :)

Anytime I hear that a party is going to be at the pit, I know it's going to be
killer. I could go on and on about morphic resonance and the weird wonderful
energies that exist at the border between two different worlds; I'll just say
that many different kinds of life have been having a really good time there
for quite a while, and it's nice to be able to spend the night there and
pick up on it.  The moonrise was stellar, the fog rolled in just in time
to be quite the effective (and ecologically sound ;) smoke machine. The sun
rose and cast a pink tint on an ocean washing up green algae against a
backdrop of wispy clouds and fog.

As far as human intervention goes, I must thank asr for bringing *plywood*
for a dance floor, as the one thing the pit doesn't provide naturally is a 
danceable surface. The music for the most part was excellent...kickin
jungle set (gosh that stuff feels good in my tummy), and an excellent
throw-down session by brother micron. The partygoers responded in kind by
coming together to create a vibe which really makes the bay area scene
something special. And the best part, making new friends...and I THINK I
can remember everyone's names...Carleen(sp?), Julia, Kathleen(sp?;-), Garret,
Roland, Keith, Hi, Mike, Mike, Fauna, Shamus...well, I'm sure I'm forgetting
someone...

The human intervention aspect that really annoyed me, however, was the number
of beer and other bottles left strewn about the dunes...cummon folks, we have
beautiful places to party out here, let's not take them for granted. Doing
so is bad for the everyone involved, from the various fauna and flora to the
person who cuts her/himself on a shard rolling down the dune at the next party.

Back to really happy thoughts, this review would not of course be complete
without a few words about Amber's most excellent pre-party...got there late,
but in time to see DJ Thorfio spin a killer hard trance set, make the most
wonderful Beth a bracelet, and hug Amber, which is the *best* way to start a
saturday night. 

Thanks everyone for making my first party since lepidoptera a great one.

love/justin

i didn't make it to this party; but from what you describe i think that
sounds like an excellent set.  nowadays it seems like one trance set after
another, and if you're in SF, many house sets in between...

it would be really cool if there were a bunch more old school breaks
interspersed there as well.  music often takes giant leaps forward by
taking old elements and making something new with them--rock and roll came
from blues, after all...and some of the most exciting new stuff i've heard
borrows from the old days--like some of the new psy-breaks and, well, all
of jungle.

most of those old compilations are really cheesy, and hardly any are mixed.
 to get the true early '90s vibe you've really got to grab a mixtape, and
with distribution the way it was back then, how can you realistically get
ahold of one?

it would be really cool to reissue some of the classic tapes, back when the
sound was fresh and unheard of, and techno and breakbeat were mixed as
aggressively as any hip-hop you'd care to name.

i suppose people who want one kind of music will probably be disappointed
by another.  but remember, if you'd never heard any music that you didn't
choose to hear, you'd probably still be working your way through your Raffi
tapes.

not to dis Raffi--he lays down some fresh grooves.

Play Nice, my first underground, gave me my first real sense of family in
the dance community.  Yea, it's great to be on the dance floor getting
into a groove with others, but clubs and massives were all I knew.  That
is, until last night.  Big fat heaping tablespoons of praise and thanks to
ASR for showing me a part of life I've been missing.   I've been going
through a phase of loneliness and last night I was totally embraced in the
loving arms of a community.  healing processes at work.  a state of
continued mindfulness.  

And in that state of mindfulness, I forgot my blue jacket, lined with
white fleece next to the stage right speaker cabs.  Any chance that
someone picked it up?  

A warm hug to all the peeps I met.  You taught me some invaluable lessons
in love and giving.  I didn't get a chance to get all the contact
information from everyone that I wanted to, so if we connected, please
please, please, PLEASE send me email, cuz i dunno when I'm going to
see some of you's.  And in case you didn't remember that my name is
George, let me give you a visual reminder.  I was wearin a fuzzed white
wool beanie and having a wonderful time.  :)


Hugs,
George

Hey Dori,

I did not post this to the list because I did not want it
to get mis-interperted and get flamed for it. (its all good Paul 8) 

>paranoid freak (or a southern baptist preacher)
Why did you have to go here? 

I am an educated man Dori, (pre-med i could go on) and my brother is a
staff scientist (bio-inorganic) for AIDS research at John Hopkins
Univ. so I know what I am talking about. What I stated are clinical
facts. I have the info. to back me up, I was simply stating the truth.
I wasn't saying all hell and damnation shit. I am so far from
religious that this struck me as funny. You shouldn't label people
period! What if I was a baptist preacher? Are all southern baptist
preachers like this? Don't make generlizations you can't back up. I
wasn't saying, "stop all drug use now your going to hell"! I have the
knowledge and the facts to back up what I say! Until you know me don't
judge me...

Layne

looks like it went to the list to me!  I hit reply and that
sfraves@hyperreal.org addy automatically placed itself in the cc...  i
don't think that was sheer coincidence...

regardless, stating that AIDS and Crystal Meth are substances that are
being used to hopefully remove half the population of the earth are
paranoid statements, at best...

As for references to southern baptist preachers, well I DO have a bit to go
on, yeah (tie in personal experience with a year or so of comparitive
religion studies):

I grew up in the Bible Belt, thumping my bible with the best of them...  As
well, for years I had it drilled into my head the following:

AIDS is a plague on homosexuals for committing heinous & unbiblical acts
Cartoons such as the smurfs have hidden and satanic agendas
44,000 INDIVIDUALS WILL BE SAVED at the time of Christ's return (i guess
this is where aids & crystal meth come in?)
All other religions are incorrect

The church that I attended for several years was one of the largest in the
southeast, and is currently televised, in possession of youth & cultural
centers that families can go to for all sorts of things, and in the
practice of helping homosexuals convert to a "Christian" and heterosexual
lifestyle...

As well, this organization is fond of sending out rather militant
door-to-door "salesmen" to preach to unbelievers, and then patting
themselves on the back for "saving" them from the doom of hell.

Am I bitter?  No.  It was there for me when i needed it and yeah, for a
while it pulled me out of some serious mental and drug abuse, depression,
and a near-high-school dropout, but still...  One day I was sitting in
church thinking, "God, you know what?  These people are really
closed-minded..."  And I realized that all the help I thought I'd gotten
from this "church" was built on personal strength.  This was probably due
to the fact that a close friend of mine, who finally came to terms with and
accepted herself, was in love with another woman and couldn't be happier,
yet our "loving, caring church who represented the love of Christ" was
basically telling her that her future held nothing but  AIDS & hell...

I am of the personal opinion that the Southern Baptist church and most
other 'christian' beliefs operate on guilt and submission...  Fun if you're
into whips & chains but not when it pertains to how you construct your
life...

As well, mother earth has been in existence far longer than us humans - and
if/when she feels that we are getting entirely too out of hand, she'll make
some moves that put us in our place (she can start by that promised
earthquake that's going to send LA into the Pacific - JUST KIDDING!!!!)
That's if our own stupidity and ignorance doesn't do us in first.

So yeah, i can see where your PRE-medical experience and your brother's job
would give you insight on the effects of crystal meth - but I don't see
where either of those indicate that AIDS & crystal meth will be removing
half of us from the planet.

Hey everyone!  I almost started to miss you guys, because I haven't checked my 
email since Big Top.  So if anyone sent me any mail, it might have been 
deleted because there was no way I was sorting through over a weeks worth of 
mail.  Send it again, please!

I had a really good time at Big Top, btw, but I won't do a review cuz it's a 
little too late.  Plus I was asleep most of the night anyway . . . damn 
prescription drugs!

Haven't been to a party since Big Top either.  Saving up for Happy Daze (here 
in Sac, looks like it's going to be a PHAT party) and the Tribal Massive on 
Halloween . . . oh yeah . . . It's amazing how much other stuff there is to do 
besides party.  Forgot about the outside world for awhile.

But . . . does anyone know about any parties in northern cal that'll be 
playing some good happy hardcore?  My friends and I are needing a party like 
that sooo bad . . .

Oh, and love to all those who actually bothered to read all this rambling, 
thanks for caring, peace be with you, rave on and prosper.

Dori,

Did you read my post? Where did I state that these are "being used to
remove half the population from the planet"???? Where Dori?? You need
to read before you reply. I'll let you read again without ASSUMING
then reply. 

I said the world (as an entity) is going to find a way to reduce its
population (not people, maybe your being a bit paranoid 8) and if you
have studied any history (or science) you know that this is the
truth.There is nothing paranoid about it, its reality. Black Plague -
Oh! I'm not going to deffend what is commonly known. (frustrated)
Let me tell you straight out. There will never be a cure for AIDS -
NEVER - hopefully someday there will be a vaccine that will curtail 
the disease and if you have read as extensively as you say you would
know this. But Dori, this is a long time in the waiting and thousands
and thousands of people will die before this happens. I could argue
about this all day but look at the reality.

There is a reason why Crystal Meth is being called an epidemic- take a
good long look in a dictionary at the word before you reply this time.
There is a reason why task forces and millions of dollars are being
dedicated to stopping this EPIDEMIC (yeah right). Lets take this off
line Dori....

okay then, maybe you thought i was replying to you, rather than to the
forward that Paul E. Wog sent to the list, which is where the original
quote came from.

Paul E. Wog forwarded a rather insipid post from a friend, stating that
crystal meth and AIDS were going to be used to wipe off the planet.

And if you think the drug war or the thousands of dollars that are being
spent to "curtail" it are honestly in good cause, check again...

hello everybody!

i just want to say i had the best of times at play nice.  sure it had some
bumps in the begining, but once it started going, it really went off!  the
music was great and i was dancing half the night (the lightly sprinkled sand
covered ply-wood floor was perfect!)  the vibes and energy emminating from
all the people i met were nothing less than of welcoming and lovingness (is
that a word?)  i have never seen so many givers and lovers running around! =)
 this has got to be my best party yet.  props to ASR and everyone there.  if
i met any of you there, drop me an email.

btw, i kinda misplaced my two little round red blinkies, has anyone seen it?

luvs,
-=wyv=-
 Long H.  (starting to ache from dancing like a maniac and climbing up and
down that damn pit!!)  =)

Thus the (yeah right). Dori, I wrote that post to Paul 80) and again
you
say "these are used to wipe us off the planet." Please, take the
time to read what I wrote to you. That is why I posted this to you
in the first place I am not about starting a flame war unless I have
the direct info. to back my ass. Read all the posts I wrote to you
carefully. It will make sense,8) that is why in my first reply I
stated that I wasn't going to post this to the list and had Paul
refrain from doing so> you mis-interpreted what I was saying and you
blew it way
out of context and you took it as I am saying "this is why the world
is so corrupt and its all going to hell," or something to that effect,
right!

Listen Dori, I am not going to argue with you, read what I wrote.
If you feel that something I wrote was wrong in anyway reply to me.
My opinions are not locked in steel and I am wrong as much as anyone
else. I will tell you this, I don't think you really read my posts
or you would have known that I wrote that "insipid" and I must be
honest (I thought it had lots of zest and flavor) post. I wasn't
saying this
is the end of our world Dori, please read through my posts once more
before you reply.

Thanks
Layne

I have to agree w/B.A. here ....  are we all so cynical that there is
nothing that is considered a positive thing?

how sad it makes me when I see so many on this list take positive events
and cast such a cynical eye on them that it completely negates the
positivity?

is this contribution completely selfless? no, nothing is completely
selfless.  and, really, what the hell is wrong with not paying income tax
on money you are passing through in a move that could affect world piece,
for chrissake??

is it an amazingly good thing that he is doing this and taking the
opportunity to encourage other people of wealth to do the same thing?  fuck
yeah.  this is what leadership is  all about.  this is exactly what "put
your money where your mouth is" is all about.

and he gets slammed?  just like someone on this list slammed Mother Theresa
full-on 100%.  Was she *all* good?  possibly not, when you consider her
religious perspectives that might be too hard-core for some.  but was she a
million times better than anyone most of us have ever encountered in our
daily lives? yes.  did she accomplish more good than most in our world ever
could even conceive of?  yes.

so come on folks.  it's one thing to be wisely skeptical and realize
there's always more than meets the eye.

it's another entirely to become so close-minded that you suspect
everything.  it's an open mind and heart that makes us different is it not?
otherwise, we're just another incarnation of the KKK or fundamentalists.

(and sorry, a million dollars is a million dollars, it ain't never no drop
in no bucket, no matter how much you have .... and a billion dollars is a

Well, I'm not gonan say up or down - there were good and bad points.  The good
ones seemed really really good, and the bad ones... Let me explain.

(Disclaimer: I am only just now attending these events regularly.  My opinion
should be taken as that - opinion, and froma newbie at that)

I only went Saturday night - I was hoping to meet up with osmeone, but we
eneded up missing each other.  I heard Friday night had a number of problems...

Security sucked.  I would have expected more courtesy from a southern cop
(note: I'm a long-hair fag... This can cause trouble!)  Indoor security in
black is bad juju - you feel like you're in a police state.  And then, if
something DOES happen, finding security in a dimly lit environment can be
difficult.

Security also shouldn't slink about and harass people.  They are there to
reflect the order the promoters and the producers want - they are not the long
arm of the law.

Conversely, the strong security presence seemed to keep vandals down,
particualrly outside, but there are some prices not worth paying, IMNSHO.

I know the party had commercial backing, but I didn't expect to have to pay $3
for the only size water they offered.  That gets REALLY pricey, and aliter of
water is not good to drink at once, but is also very easy to lose.  By 3 am,
the main dance floor was soaked.

Skylab 2000 kicked!  I loved their show - so much that it got to the point that
I couldn't move afterward. The DJs in general were really good - I felt fine
just sitting and listening.  However, there seemed to be a little trouble in
getting the next acts synched up.  Unfortunately for me, this is where the
party ended - I was sore, exhausted, and had to drive all the way back to Santa
Cruz, so I vanished around 4:30.

All in all, it was not a bad evening, but there are a numebr of ways I could
have seen it done better.

I think it would've been fine too, but my main point was that the attitude
that this guy  and his promoter friend had had no place, anywhere. 
and I'm really sure I understand your comment about 'one trance set after
another, and if you're in SF, many house sets in between...' but last time I
checked, F8 was out of SF, as is the Monday and Tuesday night
techno/experimental nights Real Audio and Static, and you can check some Drum
& Bass and Hip-Hop styles on Wednesdays at Phunkatech. And you wouldnt find a
drop of House at any of those joints......

Okay Peeps,

First of all no great party goes off without its little glitches and problems
but all were overcome by the end of the night/next afternoon and what resulted
in a bomb ass party.

First off was Re-Ach spinning some mad ass drum -n- bass.  What a way to start
off the party.  Great set.  After him was Kid Bippy.  I will get into that 
later.  After him was Turrac and man does he lay down some sick tracks.  My 
mind was pudding after he was done.  I don't know where he finds some of those
songs but they should come with a warning label! = ) 

After him was Micron who played some great cybertrance.  I liked the songs he
played but I couldn't get over the mass of girls hovering in front of him
screaming at him.  It was very much like when Elvis and the beatles debuted on
the Ed Sullivan show.  He also had some difficulties matching a few tunes but
a nice set overall once you got over the cheerleaders.

Monty was next and did a great job.  He had some tight beats.  After him was
Science.  There were a lot of sound difficulties during his set which might have
distracted some people but he played some of the best tek-step.  The sun was 
coming up and man can he tear up the decks.  Sitting at the top of the dunes
with the waves behind you watching the sunrise.  It was definately a beautiful
morning.  After science was his tag team partner Siphon.  Some even more
beautiful drum-n-bass. Start the party off with some and close it out with some
more.  w0w.  Another great set.  He went all out showing off his skillz and 
played some sick beats.  I loved his faced when he layed down this funky 
track, it was one of near disbelief.  

Thank you to all the DJ's above you made it a great party.

Okay now listen up all kids, please read thru all of this before passing
judgement.

I have never felt so insulted and violated as I did after Kid Bippy finished
his set.  First of all it started out with his manager bitching at anyone
within listening distance saying how they should kick Re-Ach off the decks so
Kid Bippy could spin right at 1:00 am so he could get home in time.  Get home
in time ? for what ? he can't even stick around for the rest of the party?
Is he not good enough for us ? Oh its the I am a (wanna be) DJ and thus I am too
cool to dance and mingle with the common folk. Plus what is the manager stuff.
Oh man this is not what being a DJ is about and being a part of the scene.

Okay let me continue.  That whole incident left a bad taste in my mouth to start
off with, and after hearing the first two songs I knew it was going to be 
painful.  To best describe his set is this:  

Someone went back in time to 1992-1993, kid napped a DJ and his records (this 
would also explain how some of his 5 year old rekkids sounded so clean) and
brought him hear to 1997 to play.  I can play you mix tapes of my friends
spinning back in the day and you will hear all the songs he played and all the
same mixes, cutins/cutouts that he used.

I have been doing this for a while and all
those old skewl songs mean a lot to me and to have hear them again under those 
circumstances was not a positive experience.  I am not saying that no one can
play old stuff,  I emplore DJ's dropping some old school beats every once in a
while.  Also if they have been in the scene for a long time and DJ since 1992
they probly do play the songs.  BUT then again do not make it your thing! Kid
bippy has not been spinning for 5 years, and if he has he hasn't bought a new
record since.  He played those songs NOT out of love or respect for the songs
and the scene they represent/represented.  There were not so many diverse
genre's back then so every DJ played this style of techno. 

Another point is that I want to say to avoid so confusion is that I love those
songs a lot and they are very dear to me, and for all the people that heard
these songs for the first time, I am happy for too for they are great songs
with lots of energy.  I want a lot of people to enjoy them.

It all comes down to intention and what the DJ puts into his style/set. Does 
Kid Bippy jsut like old school soo much he wants all to share it with all of 
you?  If thats true then show some class, style and respect.  None was displayed
saturday night by him or his "manager".  

Does he want to spin popular songs/easy songs, identifiable songs  
that everybody likes and will dance to so it makes him look like a better DJ
than he really is?  Yes and this is where I have my problem. Anyone can
get behind the decks and spin that same set and get the same crowd reaction.
Prolly a little better cuz hopefully they would not have the occasional train
wreck and manager jumping up and down behind him/her while they spun.

Does he really care about the scene or is he just in it for the fame/fortune?
Well he and his manager took off awfully quick after he finished.  Plus what
is it with this whole "The schedule says 1:00 so he spins at 1:00am no matter
what" It was a underground/renegade party!! Its not going to go a s smoothly
as it was planned .. thats a part of doing it.  It makes it more real down to 
earth.  Plus where is all the PLUR in that as well. The repect for the DJ 
spinning he wanted to kick off, the people he was screaming at, the rest of the
people at the party. 

No he wants to become a big name popular DJ, and he (and his manager) figure 
that the easiest way was to use these songs. I seriously doubt that he or his
manager gives a shit about this scene.  Its obvious they haven't been in it long
or I would hope that they would show more respect than that.

Sorry to ramble on so much but after doing this for so long, I get very 
emotional when I see the scene I love exploited for someone elses personal
gain.

SOOOOOOOOOOOO Please all of you out there.  DO NOT support Kid Bippy and what he(doesn't) stand for.  If he is spinning at a party you know of don't go, if you
find yourself at a party he is spinning at, go to the other room or go outside.

You might say where is the PLUR in all of this, but when someone doesn't show
respect in the first place, they get no respect in return!

I hope all of you had fun this weekend,

Herb

If you truly love her, and if you are, like you've said, being true to
yourself and gained some strength in yourself, why don't you talk to your
girlfriend and try to help her out of the mess instead of running away
from the situation.  I'm really sorry this is none of my business, but I
guess she had some reason to start doing speed and getting into the shit
and to have lied to you.  Again, if you really love her, all she really
needs is someone's support and love, good vibe.  I know it's fucking hard
and you might not wanna be involved with this kind of shit.  But she may
need your help.

And the word is THANKS to all the people there.

Despite some technical problems (which happen) I was very glad to spin
this party. Monty, in particular, really had me feelin it. I was sorta
half-asleep lying down for Micron's set (sorry dan, but it was pretty
damn soothing) when things started getting funky. I figured I'd better
get up or I'd sleep through my slot. It's incredible how a dj can just
grab you plop you into the groove. I went from half-asleep to
head-boobin, to dancing in 3 tracks. Sweetness...

The reason for the THANKS is also because I had a good old friend from
Paris visiting who had just flown in that evening. Although Dan wasn't
into all of the music, he had a great time and said it reminded him of
the old days. So thanks so much for letting him in, kids. Whenever I
start losin the love a little you guys kick me in the ass and show me
that after 6 years in this scene it's still going strong for the right
reasons.

take care

Science

sorry for any confusion there, elizabeth, but my comments were meant for
the list as a whole, but because i chose a post to reply to that had text
from you and from Black Adder, it may have looked like i singled you out...

but i must say that, upon rereading your post as requested, that yes, I do
believe you were discounting his donation by belittling its value because
he is hugely wealthy and because you are skeptical of his public
announcement of it, and that he has something to gain...  (though i can't
imagine how much p.r. one would need to get back in order to have it be
worth a billion dollars!)

"sharing your wealth" can present a dilemma on how to "value" someone's
contributions ... on one hand, i do believe that if you are profoundly
poor, and you give 50 cents of your last dollar to help someone else, then
you have made a huge contribution of half of what you own.

but on the other hand, if you are immensely rich, and you give a billion
dollars to help someone else, but it's only 1/3 of what you own, you've
just give ****a million dollars a thousand times**** ... and that's way
better than 50  cents, because it can do so much more.  (in fact, that is
SO MUCH MONEY that it might actually have an effect on the entire world)

(though frankly, giving ONE THIRD of your total worth is huge no matter how
you look at it ... how much are your parents or your wealthiest relatives
worth?  can you imagine them giving away one third of what they own????)

sometimes many of us carry issues about money and who deserves it and that
people who have it can't be truly good .... and so on and so on .... if you
(that means 450 people out there, e., not just you) have issues like that
that color how you see the world, you may want to examine them and try to
get over it ... because money *can* be used to do good, but if you think
people with money are inherently bad, then it's not likely that you will
ever have any ....

it just seems so silly to me that i hear people say things like "if I had a
million dollars, i would do this, and this and this.." but then turn around
and be suspicious of people who actually have that kind of money and are
willing to use it for what they think is important.

money can do great things .... but not if you don't have any.  here's
someone proving that (at least it appears that is his intention) ...

over and out, back to work to earn a dollar or two!

Well im kicking myself in the ass cause I missed the party. I was
scheduled to play the after party so I figured I will just attend that
cause I was tired from work plus I did not want to drive back and
forth from Monterey to SJ I heard the party Went off!! My Day Starts
with a phone call at 7:30 am from Beth saying "Where are you" im like
it is 7:30 and im tired. She tells me to come to the party cause it is
sunny and nice so I ask if I can play early as I was supposed to play
at 1:00 pm. She asks Jeremy and he says sure come on down. So im like
kewl I will do that. Then I think Shit!! I have not arranged my
records yet there is a pile of records all over my floor cause I was
frustrated with my sound and I was trying some new stuff. So I get a
bunch of them and stuff them in my Technics bag. And off I go. I get
there and it is kewl I have never been to the "Pit" it was a nice spot
nice sun kind of breazy im like awwww this is kewl. Plenty of peeps. I
say high to everyone some nice Jungle and Disco was played by a CFC DJ
and some other Monterey kids. I talk with Jeremy and he tell me how
Mikey (Kid Bippy's MGR.) Totally bitched him out and he was drunk and
acting a fool. That is not kewl he should have understood that shit
happens. BTW if you are going to boycott Kid you should also do so his
MGR. Mikey is the guy that does "Planet Rock" Just A FYI he is the
main man behind that krew. I have never been to any of his parties but
I heard his last couple of ones were sketchy with times and acts not
even showing up?? So I would think he would be understanding but I
guess not? NE-Wayz I don't know either one of them personally so im
not even going to talk shit or go that route. I just think he should
have understood how things go. Sound was good space was  good I hope
you guys liked my Groovy House even though people were expecting me to
play Hard Tekno I just could not do it in the middle of the day I
thought house fit the mood. It was nice to see some old faces  high
Dan "Micron Ladie killer" heheheh...
You know what's up kid Sorry I missed your cybering beats hey Monty
and the rest of everyone I saw out there.  In closing it was a good
party and good day. See you all at Abyss this weekend if you haven't
heard about it you betta ask somboda...

well...i read monty's post......and decided that i had some thoughts
on this too.

but first.....never drink red bull after eating a
burrito...yuck.....my stomach will never be the same.

okay..back to the party....

KIDS!!!!  if u want to throw a party...which i definitely encourage u
to do...PLEASE be organized.  i can't tell u how many times i've been
to or played at a party that was not organized well.  If u have never
thrown a party before...talk to some of the experienced groups that
have (like viberation, cloud factory, FnF, etc.) and really get a feel
for what is involved.  I'm not pissed, just getting tired of party's
not going off, or barely going off due to so many problems.

Now about kid bippy.....
if u would like to play music that's all from 1992 and on MTV's rave
compilation...that is totally cool with me, everyone has their own
style and i can respect that.  BUT please do NOT walk around like u
are the shitza and DEMAND to play NOW...regardless of circumstance.  
We are all dj's and of equal importance to the party, so whether u are
dj dan or mr. nobody u all deserve to play.  So, i guess what i'm
trying to say is that u should be MUCH more considerate to the
promoters and other dj's.

BTW...nice sets monty, re-ach, science, siphon and terrac.  u guys ALL
rocked.

What a weekend!
Hawtin was hot in both senses, going through a crazy musical journey over 5 hours, encompassing hard techno, detroit techno, trippy mad techno, oldskool techno, chicago house, even some vocal garage thrown in there towards the end. Brilliant. The DJs on before him were very good too, especially the crazy electro beatz.
Play nice really blew my preconceived ideas about what the Californian scene was about. Coming from London involves a healthy dose of cynicism about the whole "PLUR" thing - it's been seen, done, sold and killed. But there was such a feeling of openness and unpretentious acceptance of everyone there that it really surprised me.
Plus the venue was killer. Who needs a smoke machine when you've got fresh fog rolling off the sea ;) And as for the stagediving down the dunes - wow!
Music went from vey good to very cheesy - Started with great jungle (hell, you gotta love jungle if you're from London), but rapidly the tone went decidedly cheesy - Urban Hype's "The Key", anyone??
However, all was saved by a DJ who I think was called Terrac (not sure though) but he started with Dave Clarkes Red 3 and ended with this amazing New Order remix that really made me moove and groove.
All in all the best five dollar's worth I've ever had. Well done, guys. Think I met Jeremy and Pyro (briefly) and saw some guys with sfraves laminates on but was in a little world of my own 8).
Seeya all at sunset boat party next w/e.
Overnout

hey...u guys be NICE!!!

i...for one...did NOT see all these "girls" that u are talking
about.....

i know that i am/have been the butt of a lot of jokes on this
list...but there's no need for this.

i love the scene as much as any of u...or i wouldn't still be around. 
(been "raving" since '91).  i...unlike some people...am not in this
for fame OR money.  In fact...if u kids REALLY want to know the big
truth...i RARELY ever get payed to play..i do it because i LOVE the
music and also in support of the UG scene or for the benefit of a
charity.  

i'm not pissed about this...i just don't think that it is fair to me
or other people.

thanks...

I'd like to go a step further.  If you want to throw parties, that is
completely great, because we always needs new blood coming in and doing
things in a new way...

but i suggest that you don't just *talk* to more experienced promoters and
crews....

i STRONGLY suggest that you actually help put on a few parties first before
you try your own...  be in on it from the planning stages all the way
through to the chill-out when the cleanup is done.  and i mean *working*
and *paying attention to details*  ....  make those lists, work those
shifts, learn it by doing it.

think of it as an apprenticeship of sorts .... a way to learn from behind
the scenes how many details there really are to all kinds of parties, from
the tricks of beach parties all the way to the red tape of permitted
parties... learn what you can, and don't count on the more experienced
people to bail you out.... calling up someone on Saturday afternoon cuz you
just realized you don't have any decorations is sorta silly, wouldn't you
agree?  or not having a working generator or -- even worse and more easily
avoidable -- not having enough gas for the gennie?  (these are just random
examples)

it will be better for you and your crew in the long run, and will certainly
be better for the people who are turning over their friday or saturday
night to you, if you have a little practice at what you're doing!

love, leslie

p.s.  sound like play nice played nice.  wish i'd have been there, Jeremy!

Well my side of this whole thang goes something like this....

The party itself was cool.  It was Jeremy's first party so as far as
production, and whats actually possible to do at the PIT (what you feel
like hauling up and down this brutal task)....the wood was an excellent
option for the people shaking their booty's.  The rug under the dj was
great for stability and keeping our record boxes, bags, and rack mounted
gear that much cleaner... =)  The lights that were used were pretty cool,
behind the dj by the generator and up the pit wall.  There were black
lights that gave it that wonderful effect we use black lights for.  There
was some ASR props.  I think I saw a matress, but I wasn't sure.  The fog,
mist, what ever that stuff was, was an added natural plus.  Except for
getting a little damp at times.  It wasn't that bad.  It cleared up later.
Thats when it got cold. =(

The crowd was young energetic and having fun, despite the sound problems
and whatever drama there was.  I slept most of the time till my set @
7:30am right after Mr. Science (alex).  I was soooooooo tired!  Sorry.

About Kid Bippy, well I wasn't impressed.  Matter of fact I went to sleep
after a while during his set.  I heard about all the drama that happened
after I woke up.  My take on it is a dj needs to be more thoughtful towards
the other dj's, the promoter/s, and the people.  Its all about respect and
supporting this scene.  If you want to be a rock star then you're in the
wrong scene.  Keep your body gaurds/thugs/personal promoter/manager at home
this isn't the MTV Music awards...enough of that...

I think we need to thank AndyW for his support in this whole party and
Cloud Factory.  Without them this party wouldn't have happened.  Jeremy
thanks for having me spin.  I had a good time spin'n for you all.  

Other than that I hope everyone had a good weekend.  And until next time,

Bu_bye...

I had a blast at play nice....running up the hill....running down the the
hill....about 1000 times...I didnt know there was any drama going on with the
teenbippidy boppidy...but my whole opinion on that is...if his "manager" was
such a snooty jerk in the first place....why didnt anyone just tell  him to
go home...oh well....despite anything that went wrong....I had such a
wonderful time and it was way worth the drive...even though I dont really
remember it....stariana named me "mushy smooshy moo head" but the rest of you
can just call me *mushy! I was the one jumping down the hill constantly with
Rebecca, Brandon, and Trevor all night....and then passed out all by myself
for about two hours in the morning just enjoying the scene and the good
vibes.....thanks a lot everyone  **PLUR** ><{{{*>~

                             *Mushy!

I can relate.. I think it's called is "comparison syndrome".  A "so-so" 
thing will be really disappointing when you've gone to lots of 
"yes-yes!" things.  It's all new in the beginning, so everything 
including the so-so things are great, after a while things aren't so new 
anymore, so it's not as exciting.  Personally, I realized that I was 
sick of E and not of raving.  So I took a break from E and found raving 
a completely different experience, but still enjoyable.
Hope this helps.

Hey, Mista DJ;

At BBQ & Beats, I was chilling at my tent when I heard screaming coming 
from across the campground.  In a panic that someone had been hurt, I 
ran toward the screams; to see that 
they were screaming about you.    The bottom line is, it's not your darn 
fault.  You're just playing records, for god's sake.  Techno music is 
pretty emotional stuff and I can understand 
the desire to attach that strong emotion  to a human face.  That's the 
dj's curse.

Which brings me to my one big gripe about SF:   Most of the smaller, 
underground parties only have 2 speakers, not 4; and everybody dances 
facing the DJ!!!
This is not a slam on SF, but it is an odd phenomenon that appears to be 
regional.  For example, at parties on the east coast, there are always 
at least 4 speakers, one in each corner.  This was, the music spins a 
web around the listener and completely ensnares the dancers.  Why do 
promoters in SF use only 2 speakers?    There is a natural instinct to 
face the music, which also means facing the DJ.

Personally, I hate it.   I even prefer circle dancing to DJ-dancing.  
It's such a nicer environment when dancers are facing each other, 
communicating with their bodies,  rather than worshiping the DJ.   
There's a certain emptiness in everybody facing the same direction, I 
think.  At many east coast parties, the DJ is not even visible to the 
dancefloor.  (He or she is often on an elevated platform, so that they 
can monitor the dancefloor reaction; but there is none of this 
rock-concert environment on the dancefloor.


I have a feeling that the two-speaker party is partly responsible for 
the rock-concert environment.  So why don't more promoters create 
four-cornered sound systems?  Is it because of expenses?   Or is it too 
hard to find a sound crew that can appropriately balance the speakers in 
4 corners.  I do understand that it's a lot harder than with 2 speakers, 
but why can't anyone go to the trouble?   Laziness?    

It really disturbs me sometimes.   There really is a lot of vibe that 
gets sucked away.

Alrighty, I'm through.  you rock the house, Micron.  that's why they're 
screamin'

If anyone has any answers or flames for me; I'm all ears.

So i'z skimmin da list and see people dissing the soundz of '92. No, I
wasn't at play nice, so i didn't get to see the actions of Kid Bippy...
but, seems like people here are dissing him for playing "retro" '92
classic choonz. IMHO, those were the best soundz that ever got played,
and all the diversity of style that we revel in nowadays just don't
have the soul and the groove of a classic techno rip-up ala Jeno or
Garth of that era (IMHO, of course), or any of the mixing/production by
the grand-masters of yore (e.g. F.Knuckles, D.May, T.Terry).

It still causes the crowd's booty to schwang when you can pull out some
forgotten track and play it again and it sounds just as good or better
than any of the latest shit that makes all the glitter-spangled
pubescents cream their diapers ....  Seems like music today is being
made to throw away -- why would I want to waste my time listening to
music that was designed not to stand the test of time, for a public
that seems to exalt a limited artistic attention span as a way of
life?? Why is it that this one art form requires equating "good" with
"new" or "latest"  or even "underground" -- do y'all act like that when
you go to art galleries "dude, the Louvre sucks, all that art is OLD
SCHOOL!"

Besides, there's some really good "classic" tunes that came out in
1987-88 that are just about impossible to find nowadays and they'll
still shred on a lot of the choonz churned out today, e.g. (stuff i
picked up recently):

	-- Ce Ce Rogers' "Someday" (1987) -- vocal house at it's upliftingest

	-- Bam Bam's "Give it to me" (1988) -- rude and nasty dance choon
					       with a great booty shaking 303
					       proto-acid bass sound.

	-- A Guy Called Gerald's "Voodoo Ray" (1988) -- great rhythm, good
							sampling.

Retro rules. "We like the music ... we like that disco sound!"

And if Kid Bippy was an asshole, just say "kid bippy was an asshole" 
and leave it at that.

I received a private response from the "16 year old with lots of ideals and
fears" in which the he praised me for being so respectful in my
communication with him.  He elaborated on some points and we continue to
engage in an interesting conversation.  In light of this, I will not take
your criticism too harshly.
I believe in truth.  The truth is that we live a world which does not
reward naivete.  Those who chose to walk around with blinders, covering the
realities of modern society, are taken advantge of in this jaded world of
ours.  Being naive is not something which aids progress.  It is something
that leaves people behind, playing the perpetual game of catch-up,
desperately trying to figure out what hit them.
I know how it feels to be 16 and have unrealisticly high ideals of what I
want the world to be.  I have felt his frustration.  I wish someone had
told me all of this when I was his age.  I was just sharing my own
experiences in hopes of improving his.  You make it seems as though he
wouldn't be able to handle what I was saying.  I guess I just gave the kid
a little more credit.  His passion was inspiring and I felt compelled to
encourage him to not give up on the world.  He can make a difference, even
if it is only on a local level.  Change starts in the community.  We all
need to take responsibility for that.

And I think I forgot to mention in my original repsonse, if you are 18
years old or over, please VOTE!!!!!!!!
Things may not be perfect, but if we give up, they're only going to get worse.

So just outside the office I spotted a flyer on the sidewalk that said
there was an afterparty for the Folsom Street Fair this Saturday night. 
I was wondering if it was indeed this weekend?  Any info would be
helpful, thank you.

	They have a couple of stages and a dance area at Folsom. Go to
http://www.folsomstfair.com/ for more info. I'll be there as will my
ex and a bunch of my butch & femme friends who are into the leather
scene too. I didn't know you were in that scene... ;-)

Hi Everyone!

Been lurking out here for a while and thought I'd finally let y'all know who
I is. My name is Brian and I've been in the scene for about a year and a
half. I've been listening to the music for much longer, though (remember
hearing "Numbers" from Kraftwerk when 1st came out and loving it ((that puts
me on the Jurassic scale of age, I know). Do mostly the club thing but do hit
raves occasionally. Would go more frequently but the sense of community is
hard to feel when you outage most by 10 years. 

Musik-wize I'm a trance Freeeek. Also into most house (Xcept the deep
stuff....yech!), Jungle, and almost anything else that has some originality. 

I'm local-grew up in Marin, school at UCSC and have now lived in S.F. about 5
years. Don't know if I'll ever be abel to leave this place, the people and
the area is so fucking BEAUTIFUL!

I'm kind of stuck in a 9-5 yob for a while (but not too much longer!!!) so
can't get to many of the events I'd like too during the week. Those parties
can be soooo much nicer just cuz' there's room to actually dance! Anyway, you
all are a great crowd and I'd love to hook up with you at the next (smallish)
event. 

By the way, if anyone went to Release this weekend I was the guy with short,
brown hair in an orange Diesel shirt trying his best to shake his ass clean
off at the end of Demilo's set (and probably looking pretty silly, was
feeling pretty silly). 

On the NRR tip...I'm looking to get into someone's snowboard cabin for the
winter. Anyone out there board and has a slot?

Later,

Brian Wolfe

Play Nice was a great party despite a bad trip that I had. Apparently 
the e that i had taken had mesculine in it and along with the 
candyflipping, well, lets just say it was waaaaay too overwhelming.  My 
friend who was taking e for his first time also had a scary time but we 
managed to be a lright once the sun came up.  
   Thank you so much for everyone that was trying to help Joel and 
Myself: Jenny, Blake, Lisa, and others.  My eyes were closed for most of 
the time because everyone looked very threatenning.  Joel and I ended up 
babysitting eachother and really bonded because of it which I am 
greatful for.  The fog, lights, blake with the cool trippy blinking red 
lights and multiply everyone by 15 and think of cutting your head off.  
It wasn't very PLURry so if people were trying to say hello and I 
couldn't talk, well that is why. I apologize and I wont be going to a 
rave for a while. 
   After the sun came up I was doing much better, I didn't realize who 
was all there cuz I couldn't move until I could see.  Everyone was soo 
beautiful and enjoying every bit of the party and dancing and laughing 
sharing stories and providing huge smiles.  This is what I loved.  The 
music was so cool even when I was way screwed up, well you dj's just 
made me sick.  It was a good thing though, I guess. props to AndyW for 
helping out with everything, along with Kid Bippy even with the drama 
that I heard about (sorry, but I love the old stuff)Siphon "Da Bomb" 
Ruiz, Science, Micron, Chris...I love the Oingo Boingo-sorry everyone 
but when I start spinning a bit more I'm gonna make everyone love cheese 
music and trance.  Don't think of it as dumb, but very fun  :)
   On kind of a bad note, Chad in the Blue had a very bad trip also and 
if you guys see him, make sure you give him a huge ass hug.  Despite the 
2 and two white fluffs, I want everyone to know that I learned a lot of 
valuable lessons...chill with the drugs, enjoy sobriety, and enjoy the 
love.  
   I am also asking that all dealers out there to notify anyone that 
buys stuff off of you to inform everyone if there is a surprise 
sub'satan'ce it will save us all a very bad time.  PLEASE PLEASE 
PLEASE!! I cannot beg you enough.  
   Later on I danced my heart out had ablast and then I had to go.  But 
to top things off,  My clutch was blown to smitherreenies and it took 
all day to get back home. and my car is still in Monterey :(
   Thanks to all the people that wouldn't help us out at all, you know  
who you are and I'm not talking about the people that had full cars.  
PLUR didn't exist that morning  when I tried to ask people to try to 
drop the friends I was with off in San Jose anywhere.  I was very angry.  
But thanks (sincerely) to the people that offered Pyro, Fernando, and 
others.  I got to bed finally, and had the best night of sleep in my 
life.

Thank you Jeremy!!!!!!!! I love you  :)
And we'll all  see you at City Espresso some time huh?
Don't worry , I still love everybody
Peace,
Danny "bAByHueY"Picard

So, this evening CSPAN2 showed a lecture and slide presentation by Ellis 
Miner, Cassini Science Manager as recorded at JPL in Pasadena.  The 
presentation was very informative and even covered some of the claims 
that were in that sensational post to SFR a couple of weeks back.  I find it 
interesting, so I'd like to share a few of the things I learned:

One of the claims that really disturbed me was the one that said the 
launch vehicle had a horrible performance record and had detonated on the 
launch pad in the past.  The main launch vehicle is the Titan 4B rocket.  
The Titan 4B has only been used on one other mission and that was in 
February of 1997 to deliver USAF payload and the vehicle performed 
flawlessly.  
The secondary rocket is the Centaur rocket which has been used with great 
success on other satellite deployment missions.

In regards to radioactive elements of the Cassini unit:
Certain electronic units on the craft cannot withstand the extreme cold 
of space.  To this end, heaters have been installed to keep the units 
functional.  These heaters are powered by radioactive isotopes.  While 
on Earth (eg. from now until it gets into space) these parts of the unit 
are being cooled by an extensive air-conditioning system.  Also, the 
radioactive isotopes are housed in protective covers, etc. to prevent 
leakage, contamination, etc.

One other claim that really got me was the one about the recent re-enrty 
of a space station to Earth's atmosphere.  I really have no idea what 
these folks were talking about here.  MIR is still orbiting, the 
International Space Station (ISS) is not in orbit yet...  Could they have 
been referring to Skylab which re-entered back in the late 70's?  In an 
environment where 1992 is considered ancient history, I'd say 1979 
couldn't really be touted as "recent".


As always, I encourage you to not take my word for it.  Go find out for 
yourself.  As they used to say back in the Hippy Days, "Feed your head."

:)

the e going around at all of the raves 
(just a joke, i realize that not all if even a small minority actually use
that sort of mind altering substance...  :)

but seriously though... is the list down? or is something wrong with my
connection? i'm getting mail from other sources...
if everyone or anyone actually recieves this e-mail-  could you please send
me mail???  this way i'll have a better clue as to what's gone wrong.
i feel like i've lost almost all connection to the outside world...

(ahh... it's actually kind of refreshing... no gripe about drugs, bad djs,

i understand your intention, and you *shouldn't* have to sugar coat every-
thing, but sometimes, to quote Mary Poppins, "a spoon-full of sugar helps
the medicine go down."  Often we, as 'social doctors' (to carry on the 
medical analogy) give the right prescription, but forget about the care-
giver part of medicine.

I apologize if you where offended, I did not mean to call you an old
fogey, I was trying to say that you might *APPEAR* to be one to Paul.
I commend you on your never ending search for truth, and i hope that
you truly listen (to me and yourself) and grow from the conversation 
that we've been having (i know i have.)  I also agree that, in general,
a 16 year old should be responsible for what they say and write, but
keep in mind that he (like the rest of us) is still growing.  And he (like
the rest of us) should be nurtured, and not cut down.

That is a good question, I think it's interesting that he responded to 
Megan and not you.  He probably found more constructive and 
nurturing guidance from her.  And my approach might not have been
perfect either.  Hey, I'm workin on it ;)

I agree, and i'm listening to all of your points.  I apologize for anything
you may have taken offense at.  Please show me the same respect.

Hey Dan, I've got your tape (Passages) and I must say they are super. 
Very PHAT.  

N E Ways, the check is going in the mail tomorrow morning before school
(just for reassurance).  As far as I remember, with postage and all, it
came to a little under 19 beans.  I'll just write a check for 19 bucks. 
Cool?

okay, first off i'm a she. :) and i really didn't mean to be too
harsh. but you have to see how calling the non-rave world uncivilized
is a bit nazi-istic (if that's a word). i only meant to show this kid
that the world will give to you what ever you see in it. if you see
everyone on the street as uncivilized, sure. they're not going to
respond to you very kindly. in many cases i was merely reiterating
megan's points. and not too harshly. the only thing i was harsh about
was his looking at the world as being uncivilized, and praising the
rave scene as some sort of god-sent group of ppl. please. i have heard
of some pretty horrific things happening at raves, and i've been
burned by quite a few ravers. having this naive attitude will only get
paul hurt. if being straight and not coating my comments with sugar
makes me harsh, then i guess i am. but this wasn't my intention. 

second, i am not some sort of old fogey, or however you put it.
(calling me that was just plain rude.) i've been the naive 16 year old
who thought i knew it all. i was angry that people didn't see or hear
me. now i realize that i didn't really know anything, and this is the
point i was trying to make. if i had kept my mind closed, i never
would have grown. the same applies to me today... i hope to grow and
learn until i die. to me, the world is both a wonderful and sad place.
but if i refuse to see the wonderful in everyday things, then i'd
probably have a pretty miserable existence. why is saying this harsh?
looking at older people as old fogeys will only close you off to a lot
of learning. and i'm not saying that i know it all - i'm only
beginning to see how naive i really am. and this is the only path
toward growth, imho. but hey, if you've got another way, go for it.
this is the way i've chosen. i guess i was fortunate to have a good
eduction - both in high school and in college. i never saw my profs as
trying to feed me bullshit. one must realize that everything is coming
from one person's perspective, and take it as that. but this doesn't
mean you can't learn from it. i would be really saddened if paul gave
up and didn't take advantage of the good in life. closing himself off
and isolating himself in the rave community, imo, would not be a good
thing. he's far too young, and has far too much to learn. and yes, i
was extremely offended by his 'uncivilized' comments. he should be
prepared to take responsibility for what he's written. or is that too
much to ask of a 16 year old? 

anyway, why hasn't paul written me about this? you were the only
person who jumped down my throat, and i don't think that the way you
approached it was very appropriate or constructive.  i mean, really.
is that the best you can do? i'm only 30, and to tell you the truth, i
feel like i have as much to learn about the world as i did when i was
12. i asm only now becoming prepared to assimilate all that there is
out there.  

as clich as it may be at this point, "open your mind". *this* was my
point.

cheers - e. :)

I don't know about you guys, but I've been doing a lot of reading about
this kind of thing. Including conspiracies, etc... and it really opens
your mind up to things that you have no control over and all it does is
add stress and anxiety to my life. Even though it's really interesting
it's still very frightening. We have no control over what the government
does (realistically), and if the space ship is going to blow up
and kill us all I'd rather not know about it. You know what I mean?
What could I do?? ha. Run to the nearest bomb shelter and hide, and
never know when it'll be safe to come out?? 

But one good thing about this is that it motivates me to call that gal I met
a few weeks ago ... who I had a fantastic evening with.... She's the
best. And I'm not going to be hesitant to call her. Cuz byroni could be
vapor in the not so distant future.. if this whole thing goes haywire and
humans longer exist.... so we should all start doing those last minute
things before the earth turns into a barren wasteland.. and all we hear is
DEAD CITIES playing on humongous speakers....

What, you mean throw a party?  Me?   What are you, nuts?
I would never be crazy enough to throw a party.  But if I was so wacky,
I would definitely use 4 speakers.

Yes, cost cutting is a big concern,   but the whole point of raving is:
 
  o  the music
  o  communion through dance

in my opinion, by cutting the speakers from 4 to 2, you are cutting the 
experience
in ha/lf

   If the music doesn't

    sur (me) round

and snag me like a spiderweb;

and I am looking at Ran's buttocks rather than Ran's face while I dance,

I feel like I am 

  o  not experiencing the full potential of techno music.
  o  not experiencing the full potential of having a cosmic body 
conversation with Ran D. Dreams.

My question was based on more of a sociological phenomenon than anything 
else.  I have also been to high budget parties (Richmond Civic Ctr, 
HomeBase, The MooMoo Palace) where they use two stacks instead of 4.

It is curious that a culture made up of techical wizards and music 
aficionados would choose to cut 1/2 of the most important elements from 
their budget.

But mad props to anyone who has ever thrown a party.  I know that I'm 
too scared to even think about it.

Hi folks!  ]=}


 Just wanted to say that my nasty spat of a couple weeks ago was lame and 
i am sorry for forcing all of you to endure it.  :(   While I think I had 
some good points I expressed them very badly. The issue with Eric Spires 
I plan to take off-line and the response from Vlad on my protesting 
commercial flyers at Burning Man I will respond to soonest.

 My only excuse is extreme emotional distress from unrequitted love. From 
someone I have been in love with for over 5 years whom I took to Burning 
Man. 

 I am sorry.

hugz?

Hey guys, you might have already seen this, dunno...  (my friend produces
Rocktropolis, not that it matters but i thought i'd throw that in)...
After all the EH and BT reviews i thought someone might find this
interesting...


>this is from rocktropolis.  wow, no alcohol AND no vibe.
>bummer, man.
>
>>
>>ORGANIC PLAGUED BY BAD VENUE, NO ALCOHOL, NO VIBE
>>
>>  A last- minute location change killed the vibe of this year's Organic
>>Festival. Last year's critically- acclaimed event, held at Snow Valley
>>Resort in the San Bernadino Mountains, brought forth acts like
>>Underworld, Chemical Brothers, The Orb, and Orbital in a fashion close
>>to Europe's popular festival culture -- something only barely
>>accomplished in the U.S. with Woodstock and early Lollapalooza. Its
>>success gave rise to the possibility that England's huge dance music
>>scene could descend upon America in a major way.
>>
>>  If this year's Organic is any indication, it suggests the music will
>>remain underground.  Coming just after two under- performing national
>>summer tours promoting electronic and DJ culture (Electric Highway and
>>Big Top), the promise of a regionally- promoted, previously-
>>accomplished event remained with acts like Faithless, Crystal Method,
>>Sneaker Pimps, Aphex Twin, and Talvin Singh scheduled to play Organic's
>>all-night outdoor setup.
>>
>>  Unfortunately, two days prior to Saturday's (Sept. 20) event, promoter
>>Philip Blaine announced a location change due to adverse weather
>>conditions (fire hazards and flash flood possibilities). As a result, it
>>was held at the sterile  National Orange Showgrounds in San Bernadino,
>>California where Big Top and Electric Highway had just taken place the
>>previous weekend -- with some of the same headliners (Crystal Method,
>>Aphex Twin). Instead of featuring trees, stars, horseback riding, and
>>multiple beer and wine stands, the event offered no alcohol or food, a
>>soul- less gymnasium aesthetic, and not even enough water for sale to
>>meet the needs of those diehard fans who braved the ill-attended event.
>>
>>  Backstage, bands and DJs from the U.K. complained that it was one of
>>the worst events they had been to in America. Even so, acts like
>>Faithless -- whose blend of dance, rap, and rock captured America's ear
>>with this year's hit single "Insomnia" -- gave sophisticated, powerful
>>performances, but left immediately after performing. Aphex Twin and
>>their gimmicky dancing bears remained a crowd favorite, and
>>unfortunately, the latest U.K. buzz act, Supersonic (formerly known as
>>Supercharger), came on so late that few stayed.
>>
>>  Ironically, the colorful Organic '97 flyers handed out all week at
>>local raves promised "You remember the first, you'll never forget the
>>second." It's true, but for reasons other than the ones promoters
>>intended.

hey all!  here's my take on lifeforce:

well, let's see...  my sister, her 2 friends (all rave-virgins and there
should have been 2 more, but you know, shiznit happens), and i take off
from berkeley a little after 9.  we stopped off at the market to get some
candy, power bars, and a disposable camera for the evening.  finally get to
the location in oakland a little before 10.  found a nice close parking
spot right near the front.  there were probably about a 100 or so kids
waiting in line to get in.  they weren't letting anyone in for about a half
hour or so, if i remember correctly.  thankfully, there was a porta-pottie
outside; nature always seems to call when your waiting in line.  the rest
i'll break down by category.

LOCATION/SETUP:

huge ass place in oakland, about a mile or 2 from the oakland airport.  all
you sfravers already know about the location, but let me just describe the
place for everyone else.  it's this enourmous silo type complex with many
different sections, 5 that i know of; however, they only used 4 for that
night.  i heard that they used 5 the night before with less people (will
get into this later).

after finally getting in (sometime after 10:30 i think), you hit the first
room.  the tables are setup at the end of the room with, i think, 6 tv's of
space-related video loops.  there's a red carpet in front of the tables
(hmmm...pay homage to dj?)  and a golden camel and some other props setup
behind the dj.  a little different, kinda cool, i liked it at least.
there's a walkway on the right side of the room where it takes you to the
other areas.  immediately at the intersection of this walkway and the
walkway perpendicular to it, is this 6 foot long fluro fairy-type thingy
hanging off the ceiling.  liked that a lot so i took a picture of it.  from
the intersection, i went left.  the 2 other rooms were to the right, but
were closed off cuz they were still getting things ready.  so i go through
this walkway which i ended up calling flyer row (don't think i need to
expand on this).  so i get to the end of this which isn't long and leads
into the second room.  pretty dark, 3 still projected images on the right
side of the dj and one of those green lasers that look amazing and spell
stuff out.  well, wandered between the 2 rooms for a bit, met some people,
and danced in the first room for a while until the third room opened up.
djs on the left side, sound and visual guys in the center this room also
had all the concession stands and the 20 or so porta-pots.  SIDENOTE:  the
food/drink stand sold some food, $2 juice bottles, and $3 water bottles.
some of you might be saying what the f*$k?  well, fortunately, they were
liter bottles.  much better than the $2 dinky ass bottles we get down here.
 the 4th room didn't open up until 12, but i took a look a peek inside.
the stage was setup at the end of the room for the performers.  sound and
visual guys plus the turntables for the djs were setup in the middle of the
room. the whole right wall had acid warp images projected onto it.  

i liked the setup a lot, but i was expecting more, but i was happy with it
anyways.

MUSIC:

let's just say that SF loves there house music.  grooved to it for a little
while, but it just wasn't doing much for me.  if you're going to have
multiple rooms, i personally, think you should have different styles of
music going in each.  something i thought which was really cool was that
some of the djs in a couple of the rooms decided to get a little more
experimental with their track selections.  throughout the early part of the
night,  i got so confused with who was playing where and which room was
which.  the schedule didn't even help, especially since things got set back
a bit.

once the fourth room opened up about 12, i spent most of the night in
there.  first came terry mullan spinning some nice stuff.  danced for a bit
and wandered around until skylab 2000 came on which was close to 2.  got up
to the front of the stage, danced pretty hard, and was in awe watching
dennis just go off, mc a bit, and just plain having fun while intermitently
jumping around.  after a while, more people started coming into this room
to hear sklab.  majority of the people were in that room cuz all the other
rooms were starting to thin out.  while watching the crowd dancing, i
noticed how a lot of them were going nuts when sklab were building to a
climax.  so i decided to get on the stage, have a seat and bounce around
with glow sticks in hand.  when the next build came on, i just had to get
my camera out and took some crowd shots, plus some candids.  i gotta say
that there performance was the highlight of my night.  also, i must have
had close to 30 people ask me who this group was.  told them who they were,
and all the responses were positive to "fuck yeah," "oh my god,"  "they are
the shit," and other similar type of responses.  

after, they were done, i walked around for a bit and noticed that a lot of
people had left.  this was really sad.  since most of the people were in
this room, all the other rooms were virtually empty.  you could almost
count the number of people in each room on maybe 3 or 4 hands.  they even
started to tear down the equipment in the 3rd room with the concession stands.

after the dj that followed skylab, don't even know who it was.  for that
matter, i didn't know majority of the djs, when they came on if they did,
or where they were.  so sorry i can't give a more in-depth review of all
the djs, as if this post ain't long enough as it is.

around the time that skylab finished, my sister came up to me and told me
that her and her friends were getting tired.  i told them that we had to
wait for rabbit in the moon to come on.  unfortunately, they never did.  i
asked around and found out that they were getting paid and were discussing
when they would go on, but for some reason they didn't.  i was kinda
bummed, after seeing them at nocturnal wonderland last year, i really
wanted to have my sister experience a performance by them.  

so instead, bassbin twins came on.  they had a bit of technical difficulty
after about 5 minutes.  but came back with some beautiful, slower beat
stuff.  and although we only stayed for about half hour of the set, my
sister and her friends enjoyed that music the best.  however, this is not
to say that they didn't enjoy the rest of the stuff.  as a matter of fact,
they danced the majority of the night.  hardly even took any breaks to sit
down and rest, and this was from 11ish to 4:15.  

FINALLY:

okay, i'll make the rest of this short.  i had a really good time and so
did my sister and her friends.  i knew that this was supposed to be a
massive though the number of people didn't show it.  there was too much
space for the draw they got, so it did make things a bit difficult for the
close-knit vibey atmosphere.  i, personally, didn't see any negative vibes.
 i met a lot of cool people up there.  unfortunately, i only met one
sfraver, sherry (mercury).  and watching the smiles on people's faces
during s2000's set, made me really happy.


i could say a lot more, but i won't.  and if any of you actually read this
whole thing, i'm really impressed.  i was ready to delete this and just
say, yeah i had a good time and so did my sis and friends.

juce


btw, to all you sfravers, i will be up again sometime before the end of the
year.  i'm really close with my sister, so i can't go too long without
seeing her.  she definitely wants to hit up another party; next time we'll
go small ug style.  i definitely want to meet more of you.

this was a rad party.  the new space was great.  i hope people didn't tag
it up so it can be used again.

boomerang, his friend jamie, and marshall and i got there at around 11:30.
downstairs in the main room hiz boy elroy and marcellus both spun fantastic
acid breaks/breakbeat sets that really had everyone dancing.  The energy
level was very high in the room the entire night.  henrik's set varied from
trance to more breakbeat and kept the place going.  not sure of the details
of the other djs, but all of the music i heard was great.  at one point
lots of peeps were clapping as people took turns trying to destroy - the
raver pinata!!! :)  yes, it was a real pinata, but it was filled with
things ravers like, candy, glow stix, and some other incendiaries that that
a few people to scan the floor with flashlights looking for anyones that
all the people snagging the stuff on the floor might have missed.

upstairs was a very crowded, but very cozy chill room with lots of happy people.

props to the sillier crew for a job well done.

you can dance if you want to,

I wasn't going to say anything, but you did say HELP!!  and ask "What
can
I do???" and "What have I done?!?!?!".

So let me help you with the 2nd question first.
You have agreed to not wear glitter for 3 weeks in exchange for your
Mom buying you a pair of overpriced baggy jeans.
 

To answer the question, "What can I do?":
Here is:      PLAN A

First, take a few deep breathes.
Now, get out a photo album and look at some pictures
of your sweet pretty face without glitter.  Breathe, it's okay.
Realize that you as beautiful without the glitter as you are with it,
IF NOT MORE SO.
Breathe some more.
Know that you will be okay and that
the glitter will still be there in 3 weeks.  It is NOT going anywhere.

Feeling better?
If not, here is PLAN B:
Return the jeans.
 

Hope this helps...

jen

We're both relatively new to the eXperience, please make suggestions

Could you elaborate on "improvised original sounds"?  Does that mean the
artists are creating the tunes with instruments on the spot?  Or were the
choons churned out improvisationally and then pressed onto vinyl?  Please
'splain cuz this sounds really interesting.  

Happy Autumn,

I find myself facing the dj a lot.  I tried to get out of the habit because I 
told myself not to focus on the dj but to feel the music because that's how 
you really get down.  Right?

So I turned around and had my back to the dj.  And you know what I see?  
People standing around on the floor not dancing!  People in the middle of the 
dancefloor not moving a muscle (maybe bobbing their head or smoking a 
cigaretter or something), like they're too cool to dance . . . even when the 
dj is spinning phat beats!  Boo!  No parking on the dancefloor, at least not 
in the middle!

So fuck it!  I face the dj . . . but I close my eyes most of the time.

yeah!  MY e-mail is working!

my e-mail goes down so often that when I don't receive anything I figure the 
e-mail system died again.  The only way i know it is working is getting sfr

downstairs in the main room hiz boy elroy and marcellus both spun fantastic
acid breaks/breakbeat sets that really had everyone dancing.  The energy
level was very high in the room the entire night.  henrik's set varied from
trance to more breakbeat and kept the place going.  not sure of the details
of the other djs, but all of the music i heard was great.  at one point
lots of peeps were clapping as people took turns trying to destroy - the
raver pinata!!! :)  yes, it was a real pinata, but it was filled with
things ravers like, candy, glow stix, and some other incendiaries that that
a few people to scan the floor with flashlights looking for anyones that
all the people snagging the stuff on the floor might have missed.

upstairs was a very crowded, but very cozy chill room with lots of happy people.

props to the sillier crew for a job well done.

you can dance if you want to,

after all the bitching about kid bippy's set, i just have to say something.
(again!)
like i said in my original review of play nice, his set was fuckin awesome,
and to
me, the main reason for this was just the fact that he spun what i consider
to be
classics. a dj set doesn't have be made up by all the latest releases from
noom
or time unlimited to be good. au contraire, if a song is good it deserves
to be
played. and if you're playing a hardcore set, you *need* some old classics
in there.
at least that's how i feel, but then again, it all comes down to that age
old thing
about how everyone has different preferences.

much love.

I wasn't going to say anything, but you did say HELP!!  and ask "What
can
I do???" and "What have I done?!?!?!".

So let me help you with the 2nd question first.
You have agreed to not wear glitter for 3 weeks in exchange for your
Mom buying you a pair of overpriced baggy jeans.
 

To answer the question, "What can I do?":
Here is:      PLAN A

First, take a few deep breathes.
Now, get out a photo album and look at some pictures
of your sweet pretty face without glitter.  Breathe, it's okay.
Realize that you as beautiful without the glitter as you are with it,
IF NOT MORE SO.
Breathe some more.
Know that you will be okay and that
the glitter will still be there in 3 weeks.  It is NOT going anywhere.

Feeling better?
If not, here is PLAN B:
Return the jeans.
 

Hope this helps...

If you are a consumer who shops for records, be especially aware of 
shopping at Daddy's Records in Berkeley. There is a chance that you 
may get ripped off, blamed for it, and then treated rudely by store 
staff because of it. Read below to learn how I (the consumer) learned 
the hard way:

** Don't let This Happen To You*

I recently bought a used, domestic record that I thought was hard to 
find for fifteen bucks. Then today, I find out that the record is 
still widely available (new) on record store shelves for $7.00. When I 
called Daddy's Records to confront them about this, I was told (in a 
nutshell) that since I hadn't done my research on the availability on 
this record, that I deserved to pay that price. Then the guy (the guy 
said his name was Jason) told me about some of the records being on 
consignment and that the owner of the record determined the price, not 
Daddy's. I asked him then why there wasn't anything posted about 
records being sold on consignment and why was there a Daddy's price 
tag on the record? He belched on the phone, grew rude and told me that 
I should go buy the record somewhere else then. Oh, he did offer me to 
put the record back up on consignment. I declined and told him that 
that would just cause someone else to be ripped off. But he finally 
told me hastily to bring the record in and I would receive a full 
refund. It took 10 minutes to come to this conclusion and I verified 
he's refund offer and his name. Poor customer service. You won't see 
me in there again!

Megan... perhaps i wasn't clear... i was attempting to praise your for your
positive and nurturing attitude and make emdash more aware of his harsh
and critical one... I really wish that someone like you had been around when
i was 16, i might not have made some of the poorer decisions that i did...
in fact, the only voices i did hear at 16 where the ones saying "stupid kid,
life's a bitch."... and now i'm in the process of playing 'catch up'...
but don't worry, someday we'll all mustard the world ;)

PEACE

Just a note, I wasn't trying to let everybody know about all of my drug 
habbits, I really just wanted to let people who are experimenting to 
just not over do it and maybe by someone reading what I had posted they 
will realize that it doesn't take drugs in order to have a good time.

The song is called: "Hope Your Body" Its about 2 years old
Its done by the Cheeky Boyz (not to be confused with the Cheeky
Label) its a yellow label with a smiley face on one side. 
If you know the song, you know its hard to find! Any clues would 
be greatly appreciated and I am willing to pay for its unavailability.
Sorry to spam the list with this but I MUST have this rekkid.

"cope caus' I'm ready to cope" kinda goes like that with a mean
Talking Heads sample.

If you can get this rekkid for me I have some special gifts for 
you 8)

hiya trice...

Okay,  I wasn't going to say anything, but you did say HELP!!
and ask "What can I do???" and "What have I done?!?!?!".

So let me help you with the 2nd question first.
You have agreed to not wear glitter for 3 weeks in exchange for your
Mom buying you a pair of overpriced baggy jeans.
 

To answer the question, "What can I do?":
Here is:      PLAN A

First, take a few deep breathes.
Now, get out a photo album and look at some pictures
of your sweet pretty face without glitter.  Breathe, it's okay.
Realize that you as beautiful without the glitter as you are with it,
IF NOT MORE SO.
Breathe some more.
Know that you will be okay and that
the glitter will still be there in 3 weeks.  It is NOT going anywhere.

Feeling better?
If not, here is PLAN B:
Return the jeans.
 

Hope this helps...

jen

i was not as bummed about keoki not showing (although after all the
hype i *was* curious) as i was about the porn kings not showing. 

the only difference between a massive and a rock concert? if you buy a
ticket to a rock concert and the act doesn't show, you get your money
back. why isn't this so with massives??? refund, please!

cheers - e. :)

And you are pissed because of this? They're right. *YOU* thought it was
hard to fine, therefore it was your mistake. The customer isn't always
right, as seems to be the case here.

I can't really comment one way or the other about this poster's experiences 
with Daddy's, but I've found the place to have great music sold by good 
people.

As far as buying a record for an "inflated" price, that's due to what is 
called an "imperfect market".  It's a phenomenon caused by the fact that 
all people don't have access to the same information at the same time. 
 It's what allows a thing called arbitrage occur in the financial markets. 
 It's a fact of life.  If the poster failed to do their research on the 
record, that's pretty much how it goes when buying vinyl.  It's what makes 
it more interesting than spinning down to the Virgin Megastore.

Hmmm..

 Not to disagree with my buddy Boom))nStuff.. But.
 I personally like it better when all the speakers are against one wall. I
think it's more powerful this way. It gives off a more 'in your face' kinna
feeling. You got to much...stuff...bouncing off the walls when you have
speakers all around you. Maybe if they had surround sound? =]:.. .. 3D
enchanced nStuff? Or ofcourse if they had the speakers raised and facing
alittle downward on each corner, that would be cool..

They should just splurge at every ravE. And get thoughs damn cabinets you
see at the Freedom ravE thingies. Just go balls out. See it! Hear it!
Experience it!.. Have like exotic dancing babes hanging from the ceiling so
Jeff can act like he is not starring at them. UFO's on every wall.. And
maybe even some florescent remote controlled airplanes flying around.

Anyways.. What is this thread about?
 I think people should throw parties if they want to, and goto parties if
they want to. And to make things less damned surprising.. They should just
re-record the info lines atleast once an hour, letting people know how
things are turning out. Keeping people informed.
 I always see promoters getting on here saying sorry. "Man, sorry guys, but
we couldn't get that bungie jumping thing up at the last second" bla, bla
bla.. Well, once this harsh reality hits the promoters, I think they should
change the damned message or something. Like: "Boom, boom, boom, hey, hey
everybody. Allright, tonights the night. We got a killer line-up for you
all this evening.." blah, blah. .. Oh and uh, Terry Mullan missed the plane
to San Francisco again.

You know?
I don't nStuff

Yea.. Right on Vanessa.. The dance floor should be all about dancing.
 Wow....  I just got this memory back.. I remember when I first started
going to clubs five years ago.. Me and my friend Brian would walk straight
through the dance floor just to look for women. That was back when I...
atleast,,, didn't feel like everyone was watching me.

Are you referring to the Electric H-way Tour by the way?

and 2 of her friends to their 1st rave.  They saw the ad for Cyberfest and
want to go to it.  What is your opinion of this event.  After reading the
posts about the last few massives (Big Top, Lifeforce and Electric highy)
I'm kinda skeptical about taking them to this and want to suggest another
spot.  Is there any other place you can recommend for saturday night?  Any
help is appreciated.

That reminds me of when some dude showed up at at 24th & Illinois 
with a AK .  
one of my friends approached the group (before they whipped out a gun)
to say what's up.
Then, he saw the gun, and he made the fastest U-turn,  he had a pretty
confused look on his face as he fast-walked back towards us.
after that 24th & Illinois wasn't used as much for renegades, and I can
see why.

Hey Jason,

I will state this first off - I don't support Coolworld Productions
for my own personal reasons. However, I went to the first Cyberfest at 
Henry J. Kaiser and I had a fuckin' blast. If your going to pay $25
for a party this one has a lot to offer. I prefer small intimate
parties
but massives can be fun, its all in your attitude, be positive and you
will have fun.  

I will say this, the thought of 20,000 plus (probably at least half of
them high individuals) kinda scares me. Too much of anything isn't a  
good thing ya' know.

Theres going to be a good party in Sonoma with some of the local
talent that is sure to go off - you can guarantee good solid DJ's and
music and
the vibe will be, well lets just say a little more positive to start.

You make the call.

Layne

you, see, vlad will know what im talking about nStuff (hi Jeff!)

You, see, long ago, there were a couple of pizza places owned by Tom and
Jeff.  

Tom felt guilty charging too much for the pizzas.  For instance, the
large combo was $14.22 at his store, while the same pizza in Belmont
(though sometimes more soggier) costed you $16.76.  

You see, Jeff was Tom's partner, and he made gOOd yummy pizzas.  But he
didn't feel guilty charging more for the pizzas.  His philosophy was
that people will complain, but most will still pay the price.  His
philosophy was to get them to get as much money out of their pockets as
possible before they will say 'too much' and go to Mickey Dee's down the
corner.  

And that's what I see happening in the rave world.  People complaining
about paying $25-30 but still paying it.  

The only reason gas is $1.60 per gallon is because we pay it.  I
guarantee you if everyone got together and said 'we're not going to buy
gas until it is 80 cents per gallon', the oil companies would FIND a way
to drop the price.  But you and I both know that will not ever happen.  

And that won't ever happen in the rave world either.  There are some
pretty goood $25 parties.  There are some pretty shitty $25 parties,
too.  I'm a little biased, I just don't like paying to get into these
things anymore, so  I usually find something or some way to contribute
to the party and just get in.  You know, I bring like a cow or a sheep
or a goat, something equitable to trade.  A chicken...;]

See then there is this other thing.  

The only Funky Techno Tribe party I ever went to was like 4 years ago. 
I was having a perfectly wonderful joyous time.  

But a friend of mine there wasn't.  He said, it was ok.  

So it's all about perception sometime.  If you had talked to me the next
day, I would have said it was a great party.  If you had talked to
Casey, he would have said the party was just ok.  

So...go if you want to a $25 cyberfest.  i don't have any idea if it'll
be good or not.  Maybe you'll have the time of your life.  some of those
massives can be good.  You might have a great time.  But they won't
notice if you're there or not, cause there will be so many people
already.  Don't expect a little card in the mail saying 'sorry we missed
you.  here's a coupon for $5 off the next party.'

Hey everyone, tonight is Wednesday night and you all know what that 
means,,,well I know what it means.  It means I will be extremely busy 
catering to all of your raver coffee needs at City Espresso in Santa 
Clara.  I can'nt wait till Slow Roasted comes back just because I really 
miss the old crew that used to come out.  Mike Robinson will be spinning 
and to give you an idea, well Boomerang Fidget and AndyW are his idols.  
He spins what AndyW likes to call  "FUD"  good stuff so everyone come 
out tonight from 8-10 pm just so I can say hello and make some good 
mochas for you guys...no free drinks anymore though :(
see you all tonight 408-248-4500
Please remember to treat the store like it's your own and clean up after 
yourselves.  If the messes continue the way that they have been we may 
lose this priveledge of having a place for everyone to hang out at.
Enjoy the Warmth,
bAByHueY

you wanted a solution. so, here it is....if you want the JNCOS that
bad, get a job and buy them yourself!!!! i'm not trying to bag, but
moms tend to hate when their daughters wear "boy pants" (as my mother
so distastefully refers to my own jncos). it's easier and you avoid
the hassle. plus, you can wear all of the glitter that you want!!!

keepin' it real and baggy in my jncos,

I can't believe you're writing such scathing remarks about a record store
ripping you off. Are you not the same Kathleen Neves who ripped people off
with the Garth CD? It's been nearly a month and I still haven't so much as
recieved my credit slip in the mail or even been credited on my credit card.
What is going on over there?

I guess if you can't provide your own good service, might as well bash
others to make yourself feel good.

Hi all!  ]=}



 On the issue of speaker stacks; When you only have two stacks (a stereo 
pair) you get a *much* cleaner, tighter, punchier sound (assuming 
everything else is done correctly) due to the physics of accoustics. When 
sound waves from multiple sources (speaker stacks) combine they affect 
each other (think of ripples in water interacting with one another). This 
interaction *can* be nice but is usually destructive to clearly hearing 
the sound. A two speaker stack will potentially produce stronger bass 
with less cabinets and amps (read less exspense and set up work).

 I had a bi-amp stack once (subs and top cabinets seperately amped) and 
at one point I lost one bass bin. The system sounded *better* without the 
2nd cabinet! The bass was tight and punchy without any washed out feeling.

 If done correctly, a 4 stack system is lovely. However to get really 
intense bass you need to have a bass bin stack that is seperate from the 
main stacks or at least only under one stack. Also it helps if the main 
subs (the cabinets clustered together) are only producing bass that is 
120 Hertz or lower. At 120 Hz. and lower sound moves in all directions 
whereas above 120 Hz. it moves in a 'beam' fashion (like a flashlite 
beam). To "beam" the sound from 4 corners is kewl but to have stuff from 
120 and lower coming from two or more physically seperate positions is 
asking for audio mud.

 I hope this answers a few of your questions Mr. Fidget.  ;)

hugz,



Ran D. Dreams

Just a simple goodbye to all my friends out there in SFR Land.  I'll be signing off for a few months.

You can still send me a mail at markcamp@earthlink.net

Let's get one thing straight, I am not out to "bash" anyone. My 
purpose for the caution posting was to INFORM all of you out there of 
a nasty incident that happened to me as an average consumer in hopes 
to prevent it from happening to anyone else. Bringing people and their 
business down was and is not my purpose here. Just to merely 
inform.......

Yes I am the same Kathleen Neves (in regards to the Garth CD 
postings), but I did not RIP OFF anybody. You need to personally 
contact Rhythm Music and talk to Matt Mau (408) 298-8299 and discuss 
any unsolved issues you may have about your CD fiasco.

In the case of the posting of the Garth CD, I was supporting a friend 
whom had produced and funded that project. I had no financial 
obligations what so ever to anyone, so how could I (Kathleen Neves) 
possibly rip anyone off?

The Garth CD was not in any way related to Rhythm Music. The CD was 
produced by Universe Music. The only thing the CD and store had in 
common was that the CD was sold there (among many other record stores) 
and the person who produced it happens to work there.

I have no intentions on "bashing" anyone. I was psyched to check out 
Daddy's. I was impressed, ended up buying a pretty good size stack of 
records, and even recommended people to Daddy's. When I found out that 
I was overcharged, I calmly called the store to find out why. But with 
the response I got on the phone which was rude and bad business, made 
me think otherwise.

I support ALL the businesses directly involved with the scene, not 
just the record store where my friend works at. I know this may be 
hard for some of you out there to believe but if Rhythm Music were to 
rip me off or mistreat anyone, I'd make a bloody mess of the incident 
as well.

I can't believe you're writing such scathing remarks about a record 
store
ripping you off. Are you not the same Kathleen Neves who ripped people 
off
with the Garth CD? It's been nearly a month and I still haven't so 
much as
recieved my credit slip in the mail or even been credited on my credit 
card.
What is going on over there?

I guess if you can't provide your own good service, might as well 
bash
others to make yourself feel good.

Well, OK, vlad.  

You see, I was cleaning one side of Vlad's windshield.  

Then his car alarm went off.  

It was October 17th, 1989 5:04 PM.  

That's where I was, in a suddenly-very-ripply parking lot.  

Where were you?

layne, i may have exceeded my limit.  you may have to forward it.  

'im moving to ohio next week' is my new standard line just to add fluff
to the conversation and make people turn their heads and go 'why does he
want to move to OHIO?' 

cause once you've lived in the bay area, who would want to move to
ohio?  

i hope i didn't offend any ohioans.  they are NICE people there.  really
nice.  that whole area of the country has the most polite people
around.  
so anyway, im exicted, im moving to ohio next week ;]

gotta run!  dEEp

i've posted before, but i'm getting a little stir crazy, so i'll hope 
this reaches the right ears. i'm looking for a place in s.f. preferably a 
loft share. a lot of you know me at least a  little by now, i'm a 29 yr 
old financially (emotionally, chemically 8]) stable artist, writer and 
interacitve media designer with turntables, a sound system, lots of books 
and two well behaved cats. i have a bit of furniture, sound, woodworking 
and computer equiptment, etc, so space is an issue. i'm staying with 
relatives in silicon valley, but would love to get out of their hair 
asap. i am capable of keeping common areas clean, paying bills, doing the 
whole roommate thang. i'm also a fairly handy re-habber if anyone is 
thinking of setting up a new space, i might be game. supposing nothing 
comes of this, i might be interested in a shorter term apt/space to land 
while i look for the right situation.

 Only $10 ($7 w/ a group of 20 or more - c'mon everybody!) and it includes 
admission to the opening night party on thursday - suppose they'll have 
munchies?

okay, here's the info for all of you who might be interested:

from last wed's guardian:
resfest digital film festival
palace of fine arts

cinema electronica
hyper-kinetic films from nick philip, josh wink, the orb, howie b.,
meat beat, ninjatune, and more.

www.resfest.com

if there are enough ppl interested, perhaps we could meet a bit
beforehand - i'm not familiar with the venue, but maybe somewhere out
front?

cheers - e. :)

mmm...
sounds pretty good!
i don't have any extra space open in my sf apartment...  
BUT guys that have cats... (and well-behaved cats at that) is a major turn
on! and you sound stable...  29...  books... interactive multimedia
designer...   handy around the house...  clean...  sounds like my dream
man!   
how about a date? 

just teasing!  
it's funny how all of these "looking for a room" ads sound like mini bios
or dating ads!
good luck on your search...

I don't know about anyone else, I thought that Kid Bibby was great at *Play
Nice*.  I don't care if his records were 5 years old or 500 years old, he had
everyone out there up and dancing!  I never realized that the most important
thing about a DJ was his records.  I always thought that talent and technique
rated above the year that their records came out.  I don't know too much
about being a DJ, all I know is that Kid Bippy made everyone happy and isn't
that what it is all about?

 Friendship is a strange thing....we find ourselves telling each other
the
deepest details of our lives...things we don't even share with our
families
who raised us...But what is a friend? A confidant? A lover? A fellow
email
junkie? A shoulder to cry on? an ear to listen? a heart to feel?...A
friend
is all these things...and more.  No matter where we met,....I  call you
friend. A word so small...yet so large in feeling...a word filled with
emotion. It is true great things come in small packages.
   
   Once the package of friendship has been opened, it can never be
closed...it is a                           constant book always
written...waiting to be read...and enjoyed. 
   
   We may have our disagreements...we may argue...we may concern one
another... friendship is a unique bond that lasts through it all.... A
part
of me is put into my friends...some it is my humor...some it is my
listening
ear...some it is real life experiences...some it is my romanticism...but
with
all, it is friendship. Friendships forged are a construct stronger than
steel
 built as a foundation....necessary for life...and necessary for love.
:-)
       
     Friends, you and me.... 
        you brought another friend...
           and then there were 3...
              we started our group...
                 Our circle of friends...
                    and like that circle...
                       there is no beginning or end..
     
 Keep this going.... 
 Email all your friends this message.... 
 Email all those friends you never met.... 
 Those you have... and those you've lost along the way...
 
 
 This is to all wonderful people I have met personally or online! 
 @}----}----
  
  Pass this rose on
 and let them know
 that you care about them!!!

Ok heres my thoughts on my party . . . .

(1) Andy W is Da Man with out him this could not have happened. I know
that
if no one else does.
(2) On organization, I learned never depend on others if you can get
the job
done yourself. Sorry the sound didnt get up on time. 
(3) I wanna thank all of the DJ's for making the trip down to Monterey.
Can
you believe  we do that every weekend, the opposite dirrection.
(4) Thanks Jer for picking up the sound.
(5) I think this party had a great vibe and was appreciative of
everyone who
came out in support of ASR Productions first party. I threw this party
for
you.
(6) I wanna thank CFC namely Scott and Chris without your support i do
not
know what i would have done.
(7) I wanna thank Mike (ASR Productions)  for taking care of the manual
labor
the night of the party as I ran around.
(8) Ok here it goes *pluR*, yes the *R* is for respect. That is
something I
dont think was shown the night of the party by Mikey. Ok to fill you in
Mikey
is the promoter for Planet Rock. Mikey is also Kid Bippys Promoter
Manager
type thing. I didnt know Dj's had managers. I guess I'm lucky im in da
underground scene. I'm gonna keep it that way too. ok, here's what
happened,
the sound did not get there until late so, the party did not get
started on
time. Each DJ's set was cut from the hour and a half to a hour and 15.
the
lineup was moved around due to some crazy otha stuff. well mikey wanted
kid
bipp to start at 1 for a two hour set. i had tried to accomadate him,
when he
asked for a 1 am time slot, but that was before the sound sotuation.
well he
felt it was his job to get his dj' the best time. truly i could give a
fuck
who he was, big name or not. he kept repeating to evereyone bippy could
get
300 dollars if he left and went and spun at life force. i suggested
they both
leave then. he said what are ya going to do escort me. i simply wanted
him
gone, so i said he could go on next and get a hour 1 hr 15 set, just as
all
the dj's got. i'm sorry i wasnt going to treat him better than any of
the
dj's. I'm sorry thats just me. well i do want to make it clear, it
wasnt Kid
bippy yelling at me, it was his represanative. Greg = Kid Bippy, well
greg
was being very nice and understanding, but he also said nothing to me
about
Mikey's actions. I hope Mikey as well as Greg had a blast at *Play
Nice*,
just as I wish everyone did. But for me that was a bit of drama that I
didnt
need to handle at that time. but hey. its "all good." i guess. 
(9) I can't thank the Dj's enough for making the trip to Monterey. I
hope it
was worth the drive. i know you made my night.
(10) I can't believe I almost forgot to thank Marcos. thank you for the
lights you made the night beautiful. i hope to work with  you again.

Well I hope all you kids had fun, it was great to see you guys there/
love~jeremy
~Remember to *Play Nice*~

one thing that a lot of people don't understand is that motive plays a
big part in the overall vibe of a party. even if you don't know what's
going on behind the scenes, it does reflect on the vibe of a party.
anyhow apparently I heard from several people that kid bippy can't beat
match for shit, and his 'lil manager mikey (the guy who throws planet
crock), is a 'lil asshole threatening people, and acting like a complete
and total bitch. "waaah waah waah, my kid bippy is going to play at 1am
whether you fucking like it or not! I don't care if you had problems,
he's playing at 1" that drunken fool. some people just don't get it...

anyways... all I'm trying to say is buy gasoline at unocal 76, why?
because they get it. disregard everything else I said. =)

oh yeah, I did however enjoy the music kid bippy played, although I
didn't like him, his manager, nor their attitudes!

and now a word from our sponsor:
"do you get outta hand when you drink too much? are other people worried
about your drinking problem? well we can help! we at R.A.D.D.H (ravers
against drunken dickheads) would like to tell you what you can do to
help youself and the people you care about! DON'T DRINK STUPID!"

bye guys.

Seeing how that it was my party, i think i should reflect on the
comment about the quality of kid bippy's records, and music. i may not
have appreciated his music as much as the kids on the dance floor
thats cuz i like much harder music. however , those kids on the
dancefloor were dancing. that is why i threw this party. not for those
who disliked his music for the ones who were out there dancing the
night away. that is why i love this scene everyone has there own taste
in music. the kids at my party obviously loved this style of music.
that is all i think that is important to the situation.

I would try to avoid Tweekin on haight also...
A while ago, they insisted that I pay $10 for two Bottom Heavy records.  I
told them that Bottom Heavy is an LA label and the records should be $6
like all their other domestics.  
Then crazy evil white lady started yelling at me.

(Here's the part where I was stupid) I bought them anyway.
On one hand, I was dumb.  On the other hand, why the hell do you have to
be shady to your customers, even if in a particular instance you can get
away with it? Please never shop there.

Anyone involved with music (record store owners/employees, DJ's,
partygoers, whoever) _should_ be in it for the love of music, no?
To me, this extends to respecting others also loving that music.

-steve
(Zebra, Drop Beat, Trance & Jungle... -- almost anywhere, actually -- are
all MUCH less shady than Tweekin, those low motherfuckers.  I've never had
problems with Daddy's, and at least you finally got your cash back, but
shit, just goes to show people will get away with whatever the hell you
let them get away with.  It saddens me.)

Daddy's is a tight-ass record store, I got some good records there.
Also when buying hard to find records, one should research  the
price/availability .
and if the person has access to the internet, it makes it so much
easier, plus you find out other interesting stuff about artist/label
etc.

  I would say definately NOT to take them to Cyberfest! Now I can't
say I've gone to one and "oh this happened and I had horrible time..etc.."
but I have been to a few Massives(i.e.this and last year's Freedom) and if
it had been my very first rave I don't think that I would of walked away
with a clear and positive concept of what a 'rave' actually was. I don't
feel safe at the maasives and probaly never will. It's always a vibe
killer for me when I walk into the party and there is this huge line of
people ready to sell you the drug of your choice.
  I would look on the calendar and see if there are any *small* parties
going on. It seems best to introduce a newbie to raving at one of
the smaller ones. This gives them a chance to get used to things at their
pace and not be bombarded by what's going around them..Ya know there is
the
Sunset boat party going on this Sunday=)..If you don't think that is their
thing..maybe push their 1st rave experience back a week...Whatever you
guys decide to do;I hope you have great time!....Still, I'm sure others on
the list will share my view about Cyberfest....
                                  -Reagan

p.s.- If I see anything interesting on the list;I'll e-mail it to ya!

The moral of the story is "pay attention while they ring you up and make
sure you don't get ripped". It really doesn't matter which store it is...
If it were my store I would have a hard time taking someone's word that
they were charged for a record they didn't receive or something... I guess
if you were overcharged for a single record and brought the whole stack
back with the reciept, that might be a bit different. It's pretty tough to
take your word that you got overcharged or charged incorrectly once you
walk out the door... Make sure the stuff is straight b4 you leave.

I ask for some type of discount whenever purchasing a "stack" of records.

Peace,

Hello SFRaves,

A few weeks back there was some talk about a website with pictures of 
SFRaves folks.  Weeell, Byroni and I think that it is a good idea so we 
are trying to make it happens.  Byroni will setup the website so to 
anyone out there who is interested in knowing who's who visually, pls 
help contribute and send to him a digital image of your splendid self, 
and also don't forget to mention something, anything about yourself too.  
And for those of you who don't have a picture in computer form (or 
whatever you call it), I will be happy to scan in a photo for you and 
forward it to Byroni.  My address is: 3014 Crater Lane, San Jose, CA 
95132.

Here is my experience of Play Nice.  Hitched a ride from Justin and 
Garvin so figured I "Play Nice" in return and helped out with the gas. 
Oh, earlier in the evening went to Amber's house for the pre-party, 
"Play Nice" and brought some fruits and muffins.  In Monterey, had a 
Nice walk to the crater of paradise, calmly waited, and then...  uh.. 
sorry guys, I couldn't find words to describe it but just imagine that 
you danced, hugged, and smiled all night under the stars, in the cool 
misty air, and sands under your feet.  And imagine morning came with 
warm sun rising from east and blue ocean from west...  Well this will be 
my last rave review because I just can't seem to describe how much 
aliveness I feel raving in general.  That's a tribute to all of you.  

vibe'aciously,
Hai
(HI Justin, Garvin, Rolan, George, AndyW, Hope, Beth, Rebecca, ...)

got fired today.

been on the job 2 1/2 days-- in training.  yesterday the immensly BORING
training videos made me fall asleep. today on my first break, to try and
prevent from sleeping, i went to 7-11 and chugged 2 Red Bulls (yucko
taste- uggh) at exactly 10:15.

went back to training.

found myself being woken up at exactly 11:48 by a huge POW!
the trainer guy popped a balloon right next to my head.

didn't you guys say that Red Bull was supposed to keep people awake?

by the way... i slept 11 full hours the night before.

anyways, 
i need a hug.

Yes, observation has its rewards, SOME djs are way entertaining to watch.
But it's just a part of a process for those of us who want dancing.

My strategy is to seek the optimal spot on the dance floor vibe-wise (facing
the dj) (placeholding)(resting).  Then...when the beat becomes fully
compelling, turn away from the dj to find others who dig this same groove
and busta move with them. 

I learned this at Raving 101 as standard operating procedure.

Raving on as usual,

High SF ravers...

Earlier today, Randy Cohn posted an apology to the sfraves community for 
his behavior a couple of weeks ago. For whatever reason, he specifically 
kept me oput of this apology.

In response to this, I wrote Randy a personal message asking why he held 
so much anger towards me. (ie: the name calling like...dipshit, fucking 
asshole, idiots, rich kid, etc...)

Even after being called all of these names, and being threatened, I was 
still interested in trying to work this out. I called Randy at his 
home...and he hung up on me shortly after finding out who was on the 
other line.

I don't really feel that a point by point response to Randy's 
anger-driven letter is necessary. It is enough to say that he has no idea 
who I am, where I have come from, or what I do. Yet, he still feels that 
these attacks are relevant and reality based.

I am posting this to SFRAVES for 2 rerasons. 1, because Randy attacked me 
so viciously for whatever reason. 2, because he is threatening me, and 
that behavior shouldn't be tolerated by any community based on PLUR.
Additionally, it should be noted that my entire involvement in this 
free party that Randy remembers so vividly from 4 years ago was renting a 
sound system from Santa Cruz Sound, and returning it the next day.

PEACE>>>

This is, unfortunately, not true.  A Titan IV rocket blew up in California
in 1993, destroying a one billion dollar spy satalite, sending its debris
into the Pacific ocean.  NASA Chief Scientist Frances Cordova acknowledged
that the Titian IV does not have a 100% success rate (Space News, March 14,
1994).

Not just any radioactive isotope.  Plutonium. The most toxic subjstance
known to man.  One millionth of a gram is a carcinogenic dose.  One pound,
evenly distriuted around the earth, could kill everybody.  It is only
dangerous in particulate form, though.  

Thus, the biggest danger is the slingshot maneuver, in which the Cassini
will buzz the earth in August 1999 at 42,300 MPH, 312 miles above the
surface of the earth.  If it came in too close, it could burn up in the
atmoshpere. NASA's Environmental impact statement states that if this
happened, seven to eight BILLION PEOPLE "could receive 99 percent or more of
the radiation exposure".

Estimated deaths in such an event:  NASA estimates 2,300.  Course, they
might have a vested interest in lowballing.  Prof. Ernest Sternglass,
professor of radiological physics at U. Pittsburgh School of Medicine,
estimates a death toll of 30 to 40 million people.  

Keep in mind that the plutonium is there to generate a mere 745 Watts of
electricity to power instruments. That's it.  Solar power could handle this
requirement...

I think they meant Russia's Mars96 space probe.  It fell over Chile and
Bolivia, breaking up over a 10,000 square mile area.  Not such a problem
under normal circumstances, except that it had a half-pound of plutonium in
it.  If it fell to the ground intact, there is a danger of nuclear
proliferation.  If it burned up in the atmosphere, there is an enormous
increase in the risk of cancer for those oiving in the area.  We don't know
what happened to the canisters containing the plutonium.  The biggest danger
indicator:  the US predicted it would fall on Australia.  Clinton called
Australia to warn them.  Our space tracking capabilities are not that good.
What might this mean for Cassini?

yup. people spoutin meaningless "i love yous" cheapens everything. it
kinda makes me apprehensive to tell people i like raves/ravers because
it's associated with such insipid insincerity. gimme that good
old-fashioned "house nation" uniting all under one groove and that's
all we really need. no plur, no love lies, nuthin but the schwang of
the bootay. i suggest everybody shut up, quit quacking, and  just
dance.

in other words, kill your teddy bear :-)

PS: due to a week long biz-ness trip, I'm writing y'all from the
rave-free zone of Auburn CA, where people listen to rock and roll,
everybdy drives 4x4's, all the women are blond, and all the men have
facial hair, and people are so friendly i keep thiking they're going to
invite me to their church service. creepy. every time i leave, i
reaffirm why SF is home!

Chicago Media Watch Newsletter August 1997
The Chicago Media Watch Interview
Gary Webb Speaks
Conducted by David Peterson

          Try calling Gary Webb these days at the
          San Jose Mercury News, and you're in for
          a surprise. After suffering close to a
          year's worth of ridicule from his
          mainstream colleagues for his three-part
          series "Dark Alliance: The Story Behind
          the Crack Explosion" (Aug. 18-20, 1996),
          Webb's paper in early June pulled him
          from the story he'd been investigating
          for two years, and transferred him to its
          bureau in Cupertino, California. There, a
          recorded voice answers your call with the
          greeting: "You have reached the San Jose
          Mercury News West Bureau editorial office
          and the home of the Community Focus
          Calendar, birth announcements and
          Lend-a-Hand Volunteer Column. No one is
          available to take your call right now."
          We wonder why Oliver North's career
          hasn't taken so ignominious a turn.

 That's because Webb's series broke one of the ten commandments of
 respectable journalism: he accumulated a ton of evidence from which
 he drew the reasonable if unflattering conclusion that the U.S.
 Government routinely engages in activities of a kind that it would
 condemn, were an enemy government to engage in them. In doing so,
 his series challenged the official history of U.S. interventions in
 Central America since the overthrow of the Nicaraguan dictator
 Anastasio Somoza by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in
 1979. Far more important, Webb's series offered an alternative
 history for some of the drug-related "blowback" from the
 U.S.-sponsored Contra war, a sponsorship that in Webb's words
 "opened the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and
 the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles, a city now known as the
 'crack' capital of the world [and that] helped spark a crack
 explosion in urban America..." (San Jose Mercury News, Aug. 18,
 1996).

 We were able to catch up with Webb in June for an interview. He
 explained to us that his "union contract with the Mercury News
 gives the paper full control over [his] writing outside the paper,"
 and that since he believes the paper "will look for any excuse to
 fire [him,]" he is "not doing outside writing while at the paper."
 But, he graciously added, he "would be happy to answer some
 questions."

 (Note that when Webb uses the words "we" and "our," he's referring
 both to himself and to his colleague Georg Hodel, a Managua-based
 reporter who in Webb's own words "made a major contribution to this
 investigation, especially in regards to the Central American
 aspects of it.")

 CMW: Today, what do you believe were the most important findings of
 the investigation that culminated in your series, "Dark Alliance?"

 Gary Webb: The most important thing our research found was that the
 crack market in South Central L.A.-the nation's first and
 biggest-was begun and supplied for almost a decade by a drug ring
 connected to the Nicaraguan Contras, and that these traffickers
 were in direct contact with CIA agents before and after they
 started selling cocaine in L.A.

 CMW: Do you believe that your series had any serious flaws?

 Webb: There were no major flaws in the reporting or the writing. To
 my knowledge, there isn't a single significant factual error in the
 entire series, as Jerry Ceppos acknowledged last October in a memo
 to the staff. Some aspects of the story were not explained as fully
 as I would have liked, but that wasn't my choice. Because of space
 limitations imposed by my editors, what was in the paper was the
 most I was allowed to write. Still, what appeared was accurate. My
 editors deemed the stories detailed enough for their liking and
 found them fully substantiated-otherwise, they wouldn't have
 printed them in the first place.

 The biggest problem with the series, as I see it now, is that it
 wasn't long enough. We didn't provide enough background on the
 earlier investigations of Contra cocaine trafficking, the earlier
 efforts by other investigative reporters to expose this drug
 pipeline. Nor did we explain the CIA's history of involvement-both
 benign and malign-with drug traffickers. That would have helped the
 public understand that this seemingly bizarre relationship really
 wasn't so bizarre after all. As we have discovered since, the
 series didn't go far enough in the area of U.S. government
 knowledge of these traffickers and their activities. (See excerpts
 from Kerry subcommittee report, page 6.)

 CMW: On May 11, San Jose Mercury News executive editor Jerry Ceppos
 took the unprecedented step of publishing a column under his own
 byline that charged "Dark Alliance" with failing to meet the
 newspaper's "standards" of good journalism. Later on, Ceppos noted
 that "reporter Gary Webb, who wrote the series, disagrees with my
 conclusions." What, exactly, are your strongest objections to
 Ceppos' charges?

 Webb: My main objection to Ceppos' column is that even if you
 accept his complaints as valid, which I don't, they don't change
 the thrust of what I wrote. In fact, if you read his column
 carefully, he acknowledges that the story was right and that there
 was solid evidence to support the main finding: that the Contras
 were selling dope to the gangs. He cites no factual errors. No one
 was misquoted. Nothing was invented, plagiarized, fabricated or
 misinterpreted. The documents we cited exist, and we posted them on
 the Internet so everyone could see them and judge the context for
 themselves.

 What he ends up objecting to are mostly "suggestions" and
 "inferences," omissions and some unspecified "imprecise language."
 When one is reduced to criticizing a story for what people might
 have inferred from it-rather than for what it actually stated-it's
 a good indication of the level of desperation involved.

 CMW: In his May 11 column, Ceppos detailed a number of specific
 charges as to why he thought your "series was less clear-cut than
 the way it was presented."

 First, Ceppos complained that the series failed to note the fact
 that the Nicaraguan expatriate Danilo Blandon had testified in the
 trial of "Freeway" Ricky Ross that in 1982, he, Blandon, stopped
 sending cocaine profits to the Contras.

 Webb: The charge is not only insignificant; the allegedly
 "important evidence" that was cut out is almost certainly false.
 Yes, Blandon testified under oath that he stopped selling cocaine
 for the Contras in 1982. He also testified under oath-at the same
 trialhe stopped selling the cocaine in 1983. Two years earlier he'd
 told a federal grand jury, again under oath, that he stopped in
 1983. The day before the trial, the U.S. Attorney who put Blandon
 on the witness stand said in court that he stopped in 1984.

 The Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI, the L.A. County
 Sheriff's Office and the Bell Police Department all had information
 from participants in the drug operation that Blandon was selling
 coke for the Contras as late as August 1986. More importantly,
 Blandon told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he gave drug
 money to Contra commander Eden Pastora in 1985, along with a couple
 pickup trucks and the key to his house in San Jose, Costa Rica.
 Blandon's 1983 claim was reported in the original text of the
 series, as well as some of the contradictory evidence. Those
 paragraphs were cut to save space, as Ceppos acknowledges. To me it
 is quite telling that the prime example of "important evidence"
 that wasn't in the series was a falsehood that was cut by my
 editors.

 CMW: Ceppos' second charge is that the series failed to stress that
 its numbers for the "millions in profits" that it reported were
 sent to the Contras were at best estimates, not hard data.

 Webb: Guilty as charged. We should have made it clearer what the
 "millions" language was based upon. I myself thought it was fairly
 obvious that the number was an estimate, since there was no
 specific figure attached to it. But maybe that's just me. I also
 think this is a sin newspapers commit every day, in far more
 callous fashion. How many times have you read a story reporting "$X
 million worth of drugs seized"? And how many times have those
 stories disclosed that the number, an extrapolation based on an
 unknown formula, was plucked from a police press release and no
 independent attempt was made to verify its accuracy before passing
 it along to readers as a fact? I'll answer that: Never. My
 estimate, on the other hand, was based on court testimony, court
 records, and interviews with cocaine dealers.

 CMW: Ceppos states that "Another clear implication of our series
 was that the Blandon-Ross drug connection played the critical role
 in the crack explosion in urban America"-an implication that Ceppos
 now calls an "oversimplification."

 Webb: Baloney. The series never said this drug ring played "the
 critical role" in the nationwide crack epidemic. The reason is that
 there never was a "nationwide" crack "epidemic," as those terms are
 generally understood. It was an invention of the media. Widespread
 crack use began in L.A. in 1982-83, in Miami in 1984, and in much
 of the rest of the country between 1986 to 1989. When the national
 media finally woke up to the story in the spring and summer of
 1986, crack markets were popping up all over the place.

 But since neither the press, the Congress nor the DEA could admit
 that they'd been snoozing for four years, crack was declared to be
 a sudden tidal wave that had come out of nowhere and spread
 instantaneously from coast-to-coast-appearing like Athena,
 full-grown from the brow of Zeus. The fact that supposedly
 knowledgeable people still believe this nonsense is not surprising;
 the Washington Post trotted out this scenario to "prove" that one
 drug ring couldn't have had the impact that we, allegedly, had
 attributed to it.

 What I wrote was that this Contra drug ring played a critical role
 in the spread of crack from South Central L.A. to other black
 neighborhoods nationwide, since the dope was being sold mainly to
 the L.A. gangs. As far as Ceppos' "oversimplification" charge goes,
 if you want to find the root of a crack market, you find the
 market's source of cocaine powder. If there's no powder, there's no
 crack. Simple as that.

 CMW: Finally, to quote Ceppos' exact words: "Finally, though we
 [i.e., the series] never said the CIA knew of, or was involved in,
 this Contra funding effort, we strongly implied CIA knowledge....I
 feel that we did not have proof that top CIA officials knew of the
 relationship."

 Webb: This is an admission to something that has never been denied,
 at least not by me. The series did much more than "strongly imply"
 CIA knowledge of these traffickers and their activities. I quoted
 people, by name, who came right out and said it. We quoted from an
 FBI cable to that effect. We pointed out that a CIA agent gave
 these traffickers their fundraising orders and produced a picture
 of the head of the drug ring meeting with another CIA agent during
 the time these drugs were being sold. But the series never
 suggested "high level" CIA knowledge, as Ceppos disingenuously
 claims.

 CMW: You told the New York Times (May 13, 1997) that your newspaper
 "has been sitting on a series of follow-up stories," but has yet to
 publish them.

 Webb: Yeah. I was told directly by Ceppos that the paper would not
 print the follow ups, but would assign someone else to follow up on
 some angles. We'll see.

 CMW: University of Wisconsin professor Alfred McCoy always cautions
 that "it's important not to run down the track like the blind dog
 facing the hare of intentionality: Did the CIA know? Can we
 actually track it to Langley? That's a false issue," he contends.
 "The real issue is the consequences of these operations." Well,
 what were the real consequences?

 Webb: This drug ring certainly increased the flow of drugs to South
 Central Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, San Jose,
 New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Houston and San Diego. And, as I wrote,
 the money the street gangs made from selling this ring's product
 allowed the gangs to expand and arm themselves with high-powered
 weapons. The consequences of that are mind-boggling.

 CMW: When your series began to receive national attention last
 September, CMW was struck by how vehemently the mainstream media
 turned against it, after a very brief honeymoon.

 Webb: Jesse Jackson said my series was dangerous because it
 challenged the moral authority of the government. Preserving the
 myths of the drug war-in which the media has played a central and
 often shameful role-was more important to most news outlets than
 preserving the myths of the Contra war, I think. Finally, this
 series caught the CIA right as it was struggling to justify its
 continued existence. And as we have seen, the CIA has many
 important defenders.

 CMW: What have the media's broadly negative reactions to the series
 taught you?

 Webb: The media, with few exceptions, show less and less interest
 in helping people understand their world all the time. Foreign news
 is almost non-existent in most daily papers. Stories keep getting
 shorter. Context and perspective disappear entirely so that it
 appears to most readers that events happen in a vacuum. But we sure
 get exhaustive coverage of sex scandals, celebrity crime and phony
 outrages like outing the fatcats who slept in the Lincoln bedroom.

 CMW: Has the flak that you've had to suffer because of your series
 turned you into a pariah among your colleagues?

 Webb: No. Not really. My friends are still friends. And I've never
 been much of a joiner. I belong to no journalism organizations,
 subscribe to no professional journals and, until this year, hadn't
 been to a journalism convention in a long time. Frankly, talking
 and reading about journalism never interested me half as much as
 doing it.

 CMW: Your predicament calls to mind the case of Raymond Bonner, who
 the New York Times yanked from Central America in the early 1980s
 because of the backlash that it was suffering over Bonner's reports
 on the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador, then a terror state that
 was heavily supported by the U.S. Government. Where has the
 backlash against your series left your work today?

 Webb: I think that's something that remains to be seen. History has
 a way of sorting out these little disputes.



 Gary Webb tells us that the writing of "Dark Alliance" would not
 have been possible without the investigations of his partner in
 Nicaragua, Georg Hodel, and Hodel's wife, attorney Carmen Maria.
 But, Webb reports, both Georg and Carmen have been receiving death
 threats fairly regularly since Jerry Ceppos' column first appeared
 in the Mercury News in mid-May. Supporters of the "Dark Alliance"
 investigation, as well as of freedom of speech around the world,
 are trying to scrape together enough money to get Georg and Carmen
 safely out of Nicaragua. A fund for this purpose has been
 established in Washington by Dick Gregory and Joe Madison. Proceeds
 will be used not only to protect Georg and Carmen, but to continue
 their investigation. For more information, write the C3 Research
 Fund at P.O. Box 14185, Washington, D.C. 20044.

lara, 

there are like 5 or 6 billion people on this planet.  that's a lot.
basically, if you could stop the world so people were not born and did not
die, it would take you between 161 and 193 years to meet everyone on the
planet if you met one person every second.

our scene is small; like real small.  i'd guess that there are maybe ten
thousand ravers in the bay area, but that's just my guess.  We are between
1 and 2 percent of a percent of a percent of the world's population--that
is, for every million people on this planet, there are one or two of us.

we are literally one in a million people on this planet,
so it's not so cheapening of what love is to love that kid next to you.
you may barely know him/her, but 'we all start off as strangers--it's where
we end up that counts'.

spread the love,

rj

     Hey everybody I was in a position a while back where I was 
desperatley looking for a place, I found one, renting from my two cool 
parents up in the beautiful 
Santa Cruz Mountains.  I know someone out there is looking for a place 
and I could really use some help with rent and just, well a darn good 
friend to talk to and party with.  
     It is very relaxing and peaceful up here.  I enjoy sitting out on 
my back deck staring at the stars and listenning to the giant redwoods 
talk to you (I'm not that weird, but it is that beautiful)  The commute 
isn't bad but anyone that would be interested should have a decent car 
for the drive (my '81 Honda works fine)  I'm a good, straight forward, 
caring, cancerian who works two jobs down in Santa Clara and Cupertino.  
We are about 8 miles from Santa Cruz, about 20 to San Jose (my family is 
very liberal (hippies :) It is a studio that is downstairs from my 
parent's place, two rooms, Around 700 square feet (great for wild orgies 
and blacklights) With functional kitchen and bathroom (for those hard 
times with Mr. digestive system) and we have an awesome view of the 
Majestic Mother Earth.
It would be easier if you were like me and was considered a male(it 
really is just as easy to put the toilet seat up as it is to put it 
down) Anyways, I hope I have convinced somebody out there who is 
reliable and has a good job....and way Bitchin'

I guarantee you if they charged you $10 bucks for that 12" that their price
was higher than normal as well. A good way to check is to go to another
store, find the same record and see how much it is. Comparison shop! And I
would go on about how characterizing the people who work at Tweekin' as 'low

I have to ditto what lara said- plus my 2 cents-
Unless one of the listed acts is your absolute, do-anything for, has never
played here and probably never will again favorites, I would avoid it,
especially for newbies. This will be more like a huge rock festival/concert
than rave. If that's what they want though, go for it if you can afford it.
But if they want a rave I'd definately wait for a good party - check the
sfraves calendar. (Though Carl Cox and Peshay are great - no one can perform
up to their best if there's no vibe - or worse - BAD VIBE)

Good luck-

ps if you guys are 21+ Peshay is at Ultra at VSF Monday night (Funky Tekno

That was why I put the sarcastic response.  I too think the same thing. 
While I may love the personal raver friends that I've made, I have to be
honest in saying that the person that I know absolutely nothing about
dancing next to me cannot receive my love.  Maybe my respect for being at
an awesome party or whatever but until I get to know who they are and
respect them for who they are, I won't be sayin' "I love you" to anybody.

I'm not saying that you need to say "I Love You" to people that
you do not love but remember that what you say or do has effects
on people:


  He was in the first third grade class I taught at Saint Mary's
School in Morris, Minn.  All 34 of my students were dear to me, but
Mark Eklund was one in a million.  Very neat in appearance, but had
that happy-to-be-alive attitude that made even his occasional
mischieviousness delightful.
       Mark talked incessantly.  I had to remind him again and again
that talking without permission was not acceptable.  What impressed me
so much, though, was his sincere response every time I had to correct
him for misbehaving - "Thank you for correcting me,!"  I didn't know
what to make of it at first, but before long I became accustomed to
hearing it many times a day.
       One morning my patience was growing thin when Mark talked once
too often, and then I made a novice-teacher's mistake.  I looked at
him and said, "If you say one more word, I am going to tape your mouth
shut!" It wasn't ten seconds later when Chuck blurted out, "Mark is
talking again."  I hadn't asked any of the students to help me watch
Mark, but since I had stated the punishment in front of the class, I
had to act on it.
       I remember the scene as if it had occurred this morning.  I
walked to my desk, very deliberately opened my drawer and took out a
roll of masking tape.  Without saying a word, I proceeded to Mark's
desk, tore off two pieces of tape and made a big X with them over his
mouth.  I then returned to the front of the room.  As I glanced at
Mark to see how he was doing he winked at me.  That did it!  I started
laughing.  The class cheered as I walked back to Mark's desk, removed
the tape and shrugged my shoulders.  His first words
were, "Thank you for correcting me." At the end of the year I was
asked to teach junior-high math.  The years flew by, and before I knew
it Mark was in my classroom again.  He was more handsome than ever and
just as polite.  Since he had to listen carefully to my instructions
in the "new math," he did not talk as much in ninth grade as he had in
the third.
    One Friday, things just didn't feel right.  We had worked hard on a
new concept all week, and I sensed that the students were frowning,
frustrated with themselves - and edgy with one another.  I had to stop
this crankiness before it got out of hand.  So I asked them to list
the names of the other students in the room on two sheets of paper,
leaving a space between each name.  Then I told them to think of the
nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates and write
it down.
It took the remainder of the class period to finish the assignment,
and as the students left the room, each one handed me the papers. 
Charlie smiled. Mark said, "Thank you for teaching me.  Have a good
weekend." That Saturday, I wrote down the name of each student on a
separate sheet of paper, and I listed what everyone else had said
about that individual.On Monday I gave each student his or her list. 
Before long, the entire class was smiling.  "Really?"  I heard
whispered.  "I never knew that meant anything to anyone!" "I didn't
know others liked me so much!"
       No one ever mentioned those papers in class again.  I never
knew if they discussed them after class or with their parents, but it
didn't
matter. The exercise had accomplished its purpose.  The students were
happy with themselves and one another again.
        That group of students moved on.  Several years later, after I
returned from vacation, my parents met me at the airport.  As we were
driving home, Mother asked me the usual questions about the trip - the
weather, my experiences in general.  There was a light lull in the
conversation. Mother gave Dad a side-ways glance and simply says,
"Dad?"  My father cleared his throat as he usually did before
something important.  "The Eklunds called last night," he began. 
"Really?" I said.  "I haven't heard from them in years.  I wonder how
Mark is."
Dad responded quietly.  "Mark was killed in Vietnam," he said.  "The
funeral is tomorrow, and his parents would like it if you could
attend."
To this day I can still point to the exact spot on I-494 where Dad
told me about Mark.
       I had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin before.  Mark
looked so handsome, so mature.  All I could think at that moment was,
Mark, I would give all the masking tape in the world if only you would
talk to me. The church was packed with Mark's friends.  Chuck's sister
sang "The Battle Hymn of the Republic."  Why did it have to rain on
the day of the funeral?  It was difficult enough at the graveside. 
The pastor said the usual prayers, and the bugler played taps.  One by
one those who loved Mark took a last walk by the coffin and sprinkled
it with holy water. I was the last one to bless the coffin.  As I
stood there, one of the soldiers who had acted as pallbearer came up
to me.  "Were you Mark's math "teacher?" he asked.  I nodded as I
continued to stare at the coffin.  "Mark talked about you a lot," he
said. After the funeral, most of Mark's former classmates headed to
Chucks
farmhouse for lunch.  Mark's mother and father were there, obviously
waiting for me.  "We want to show you something," his father said,
taking a wallet out of his pocket.  "They found this on Mark when he
was killed.  We thought you might recognize it."Opening the billfold,
he carefully removed two worn pieces of notebook
paper that had obviously been taped, folded and refolded many times.  I
knew without looking that the papers were the ones on which I had
listed all the good things each of Mark's classmates had said about
him.  "Thank you so much for doing that" Mark's mother said.  "As you
can see, Mark treasured it."Mark's classmates started to gather around
us.  Charlie smiled rather sheepishly and said, "I still have my list.
 It's in the top drawer of my desk at home."  Chuck's wife said,
"Chuck asked me to put this in our wedding album."  "I have mine too,"
Marilyn said.  "It's in my diary."  Then Vicki, another classmate,
reached into her pocketbook, took out her wallet and showed her worn
and frazzled list to the group.  "I carry this with me at all times,"
Vicki said without batting an eyelash.  "I think we all saved our
lists."
    That's when I finally sat down and cried.  I cried for Mark and for
all his friends who would never see him again.
       THE END

        The purpose of this letter, is to encourage everyone to
compliment the people you love and care about.  We often tend to
forget the importance of showing our affections and love.  Sometimes
the smallest of things, could mean the most to another. I am asking
you,to express your love and caring by complimenting and being open
with communication.  The density of people in society, is so thick,
that we forget that life will end one day. And we don't know when that
one day will be.  So please, tell the people you love and care for,
that they are special and important. Tell them, before it is too late.

I read that Coolworld lost their permit for Cyberfest '97 (today's 
Chronicle).  As of yet, they hadn't secured a new location, nor do they 
think that they will.  The Navy revoked the city's permit Tuesday (me 
thinks).  Has anyone heard anything new about this?

I have to ditto what lara said- plus my 2 cents-
Unless one of the listed acts is your absolute, do-anything for, has never
played here and probably never will again favorites, I would avoid it,
especially for newbies. This will be more like a huge rock festival/concert
than rave. If that's what they want though, go for it if you can afford it.
But if they want a rave I'd definately wait for a good party - check the
sfraves calendar. (Though Carl Cox and Peshay are great - no one can perform
up to their best if there's no vibe - or worse - BAD VIBE)

Good luck-
jd
ps if you guys are 21+ Peshay is at Ultra at VSF Monday night (Funky Tekno
Tribe)

Posted at 8:55 a.m. PDT Thursday, September 25, 1997 


Here's the article straight outta SJ Mercury News:
_______________________________________
Navy halts plans for weekend `cyberfest' concert

ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- A heavily promoted concert expected to draw
thousands to the nearly abandoned Alameda Naval Air Station this weekend
has been canceled by military officials.

``Cyberfest '97,'' was to run from 7 p.m. Saturday night until 8 a.m.
Sunday. But it was canned Wednesday by the Navy -- even though the
promoters, Cool World Productions, had received permits from the Alameda
Planning Commission and a license from a citizens' base reuse committee.

The Navy still owns the land, and rejected the license.

Sason Perry of Cool World Productions said he was stunned by the decision,
and said his company stands to lose about $250,000. An estimated 10,000
people were expected to attend the event.

``We've been working on this for the past six months and now, at the
eleventh hour, we're being told by the Navy that it can't go on,'' Perry
said. ``We weren't even dealing with the Navy.''

Perry said the concert was about halfway set up on Wednesday, with fences
erected, tents put up and other details finalized.

Navy spokesman Jeff Young said he believed the community around the base
``doesn't like loud music or any other kind of late night event that would
draw crowds late into the evening. We (canceled it) out of respect for
these people.''

Perry said he could not understand why the Navy felt compelled to get
involved in the concert.

``These (Cyberfest) concerts are very peaceful,'' he said. ``I haven't even
seen a fight at any of them in the past. It's just a very good,
multi-ethnic crowd.''


Glad I didn't buy presale!

Now are these the same people that a 10,000 person RIOT or near close
to it started at last year's new years party when they shut down there
 party at like 2:00 am? I heard something like that? Of course I would
not know cause I was at the Gateway party that never happened... :-(
No how could someone say it is "Peaceful" or they have never seen a
fight. I will tell you why they were to busy counting there $$$ that
is why. Sorry if it seems like im  bashing CWP. There parties use to
be kewl like 5 years ago. Now they are not what they use to be.

What a bunch of complete bullshit. The peeps of the east bay where not
taken into consideration when the base was in operation w.r.t. noise.
They used to do testing of jet engines out there. Talk about loud.
And the activity during to Gulf War was completely insane... but then
hey... thats just the sound of freedom.=8)
He is right about the folks that live over there not liking loud
music/etc.
It's one of the most conservative little pockets in CA. Downright scary.

Navy Cancels Cyberfest Dance Party 

Catherine Bowman, Natasha Stovall, Chronicle Staff Writers

The Navy has pulled the plug on Cyberfest '97, an all-night rave that
was scheduled for this
weekend at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. 

The event had been approved by the city of Alameda Planning Commission,
but on Tuesday the
Navy said no. 

``The party is canceled,'' said Navy spokesman Jeff Young. ``It's not an
event the Navy wanted,
and it was not an event that many of the city officials wanted.'' 

The base, which closed in April, is being converted to civilian use.
Until it is completely out of the
Navy's hands, -- Young said, the Navy and the city must agree on any
events held there. 

``This is completely ridiculous, completely unconscionable,'' Cyberfest
producer Sason Parry said
yesterday from the naval base, where he said the event was ``40
percent'' set up. 

He would not give an exact figure but estimated that Cyberfest would
have sold out, which would
have resulted in an audience of 20,000 for the more than 40 disc jockeys
and musicians -- including
electronic dance superstars Aphex Twin and the Sneaker Pimps -- who were
scheduled to appear.
The show, which Parry dubbed a ``dance festival,'' was to run from 7
p.m. Saturday to 8 a.m.
Sunday and feature food, light shows and five dance floors. 

Parry said he had had a permit for Cyberfest '97 from the Planning
Commission since August 11,
when he attended a commission hearing at Alameda City Hall. In addition,
he said, he went before
the commissioners again on September 15 and they again gave their
blessing. According to Parry,
the permit he holds extends from last Saturday to October 4. The party
was to be held on a 30-acre
site on the west end of the base, and tickets were selling for $25.
Although the event has been
promoted since the beginning of August, Navy spokesman Young insisted
that the Navy could not
have acted any sooner than it did to reject the application. 

He said city officials had notified the promoter Tuesday that the event
was off, although portable
toilets and telephone lines were still being set up yesterday afternoon. 

``We can't deny a permit until we have it physically in front of us,''
Young said. ``Everybody was
surprised it got this far -- virtually no one expected this to be
approved by the city.'' 

Alameda Mayor Ralph Appezzato said he understood the Navy's decision.
Had the Navy not acted,
he probably would have called a special meeting of the City Council to
review the Planning
Commission's decision. 

Young said the rave was not an appropriate use for the site, noting that
people near the old base
have made it clear that they do not want a lot of noise, traffic or
all-night activities there. 

``The primary reason was the noise,'' Young said. ``The other is fears
of vandalism or possible
injury. Military bases are essentially an industrial area -- no matter
how good the security is, it can't
always prevent someone from wandering off into an area where they could
conceivably be injured.''
Young said the Navy, the city and Bay Area leaders received more than
200 angry calls after the
Navy allowed the Army to conduct late- night training exercises at the
base a few weeks ago. The
soldiers were practicing hostage rescues until 11:30 p.m. and made
plenty of noise in the process. 
Parry, who has been producing musical events for 12 years, said that he
believed he had the support
of the city and that he never had any indication that the Navy could
revoke his permits. ``For them to
say, at the 11th hour, that the event cannot go on is just wrong.
There's got to be some decency
here. It's discrimination against a youth culture that bureaucrats don't
understand.'' 

Parry said his company, Coolworld, stands to lose upward of $300,000 if
Cyberfest '97 is
canceled. 

He is looking into alternate venues but conceded that ``the possibility
is not very good.'' If the event
is canceled altogether, Parry said he believes that tickets can be
returned at their point of purchase. 

The Coolworld information line is (415) 979-4543. Sason said last night
that he would update the
tape to reflect the latest information.

	Look, you are the consumer. If you don't like the service or the
prices at a certain place, don't go there. If you got ripped off,
guess what: it's your fault. It's happened to me, and I guarantee you,
you'll do a lot more price-comparisons in the future. Vote with your
dollar, it's the american way. 

As for the Tweekin' problem, I've noticed a definate attitude there,
but who says everyone has to be a PLURry happy representative of the
scene. Every time I go in there I find at least one thing I've not
seen anywhere else. Now I usually only end up buying ONE thing there,
b/c they're pricey for SF, but still, it's all about being a consumer.

I think it's funny that if anyone isn't cool and laid back, people say
they're not in touch with the scene and are in it for the wrong
reason. However a lot of big dj's like Keoki, which half of this list
idolizes, are grade A assholes, but you don't hear people saying he's
in it for the wrong reasons...

If you are a vinyl connoisseur you should know better. Especially if you
know the record and know its available in an other store for lesser
price. But that does not excuse any sales rep. to be rude.
I personally support TWEEKIN for house imports. Darren (owner) is always
most helpful when he's not
stuck over seas in England. If you have a problem with a rude employee
speak up and complain to him.
For fair priced domestics go to SOLID GROOVES.  Harry  and/or staff are
always there to help.
Sometimes if you know a little tune and are not shy to sing,  Harry might
be able to figure the title for 
you. They are also very good on ordering records for you. All in all keep
the scene alive and don't bash
especially if you could've avoided the problem in the 1st place.

Hi!

I'm still here, I've just been quiet. :) I've been exploring the world,
while lurking.  Christine moved out and doesn't have a computer at the
moment. I'm sure we'll see her again.

Peace,
Julie

P.S. as eeee-or (from whinnie the pooh) would say, thanks for noticing me.

what's so scary about this?  i saw this on the news weeks ago.  it looks 
like it will be great for determining who is, and, also important, who isn't 
the father with one simple test.  I don't remember if they use blood samples

wow.... she got semi-flamed for saying "I wuv you!"

you guys fail to realize that there are 3 kinds of love... the love you
have for friends, the love you have for a lover, and the unconditional
love that exists between a mother and her child. perhaps she was just
saying I wuv u, to all her friends as a friendly gesture to brighten up
your days! =)

hey I love you guys too, but I don't wanna bone you! =)

peace out.jer

perhaps you're not as bombarded by advertising as we are...

what's so scary about this?  duh, you answered your own question - having
to determine who the hell the father is in the first place...  the simple
fact that a product or service like this needs to be advertised is pathetic
- okay, since it's probably apparent how i feel about sex generally, i
guess i'm not one for most "traditional" family values, but i'm saying,
even if you're going to be at peace with your sexuality (no matter how
rampant it is, hehehe), the thing is, you can still be responsible about
whether or not you're going to have a child, etc. etc...

WHO'S THE FATHER!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!

first of all, in the age of aids, it's scary enough if you're pregnant and
don't know whose it is...

second, having to resort to a dna test to determine the father of a child,
to me, is shitty.

that poor child.

you have a few different scenarios this could apply to, among others - the
first ones that came to MY mind were:

promiscious mother (again, i'm thinking AIDS & STDs here that can be
transmitted to a child)
pregnant woman claiming some rich fuck is the father so she can get money
(typical new york scam)
baby is product of rape or molestation and no one will own up to it
(unfortunately it's true, there are a lot of fathers out there fucking
their daughters and getting them pregnant - it's a sad truth)...

that's what i think is so scary, okay?  sometimes it seems like we're all
going to hell in a handbasket...

But know they have a website poll so you can vote for the plaintiff or
defendant a little more High Tec then it was in my younger day. So you
hear the cheesy music that they do before every case. and the title is
"the rave party that never happened" or something like that and I was
like cool let see what this guy has to say. This rave promoter walks
in young guy mid 20's with several witnesses. Then the defendant comes
in this greasy short guy middle aged balding guy. With what looks like
a lawyer but turns out to be his son. The Case gets under way. This
takes place in NYC just a FYI I was hoping they would say the name of
the party but they did not. To make a long story short. The party
promoter was very through on Dates, contracts, verbal and written
agreements. He even had a Tape recorded conversation with the
defendant. The defendant that had the space tried to Fuck him out of
his cash cause he did not open the doors for the party when it was
supposed to start. He tried to make up some excuse and keep the kids
$3,000 pretty cheap for a space that holds 3,000 people espically for
NYC. The rave promoter won cause he had contracts was very honest and
had witnesses. The moral to my stupid story is We can win cases in
court, contracts do mean something. When I have signed contracts in
the past I thought it was stupid but I learned a lesson in this case.
Hope you all did too. have witness's and have those contracts signed
and Justice will prevail.

My opinion on playing tracks like Human Resource: there's a difference
between playing a nostalgia set, between finding obscure old tracks and
playing them as if they were new coz they still sound fresh, and between
just being cheap.

I just got out of the tank.

For the first five years of the rave scene; I was living large:  scoring on
all the lollipop ladies, and making all kinds of loot by slanging bunk e.
It didn't matter to me what kind of e I was working...sometimes it was
crushed-up lightbulbs, other times it was any old tabs laying around the
house.

"Yeah man,"  I'd tell 'em,  "They're baby Tylenols."    And I wasn't even
kidding.

And then one day, Destiny dropped her cold hand on my shoulder.  My days of
hanging out at the doorway mumbling "X. I got bomb X, dood,"  were through.
I got busted, even though what I was slanging was bunk.

The party was over.

Judge Ricketts sent me Upstate for 8 years;  but before them deputies done
drug me away, my homeboy Slider, who was faithfully  by my side in court,
shouted to me,  "Don't let 'em turn you into a Mama, Boomerang!  Whatever
happens when you get to the Big House, make sure you tell 'em you're the
Papa!"

Slider's advice didn't really make no sense to me, partly on acount of
because I'm a little slow to begin with, and partly on account of because I
was drunk at the time.

Well, once I got Upstate  Slider's advice began to make sense.  My cellmate
was this huge old dude name Sticky Fingers Freddy, who was doing life for
murder.    Every day, Sticky Fingers just /stared/ at me.   Really creepy
like.

I tried keeping tough by making barbells out of some cinderblocks taped to
an old broomstick, but old Sticky Fingers Freddy was one of the meanest,
biggest mothers I've ever seen, and no weightlifting would make me as
strong as him.

Then one day, old Sticky Fingers says to me, he says, "You obviously don't
know how it works around here, do you, Boomerang?"

"Eeep."  said I, trembling in my britches.  "Well, I guess not, Mr. Fingers."

"In every cell,  there's a Mama, and there's a Papa.  Now, since you're new
around here, I'mma give you the option to choose.  Which one are you gonna
be, the Mama, or the Papa?"

"Gulp,"  said I, thinking quick to gain the upper hand.  "Well, sir,  I
guess I'll be the Papa."

"Allrighty then, Papa.   Why don't you come on over here, and suck Mama's
ding-a-ling."

The love you have for your Mother or Father, is different than the love you have for a best friend, lover, even a favorite beach or high mountain camping spot ("I love it  here").


As long as you have love to share, you might very well choose to love the kid next to you, maybe they need it...  What you have to decide is what love means to you, and how you choose to use the word... after all, love is an emotion, going beyond being just a phrase that you "throw around".  


Everybody needs love, everybody.


luv ya.

Anyone know of anything going off in Sonoma/Napa Saturday night?

I'm going to be up there for a wedding, and the way it's looking so
far, I'm going to be in dire need of some good house/techno/d&b at 
some point...

there's only so much country dancing w/ maiden aunts (& uncles) i can take...

thanks,
Neil.

maybe the ravers just aren't what they used to be. A party is a party. Its
the people that go to the party that make it happen/not happen.

ok, not that i'm making light of this 'tragedy', but like i said 
before when i was slamming massives in general about a month ago, i 
DID go to the Cool World make-up party....and it wasn't that 
peaceful.  in fact, was quite scary
but that's just my ignorant, biased opinion.

Hiya gang,

after being outta the loop for Big Top and now the demise of Cyberfest is upon
us, I am going to allocate my "free" weekend to ResFest. Looks good w/ Young
American Primitive video being highlighted etc. (YA! Gimme some YAP!)
Sidenote: Thanks to all who gave me info on the YAP MAN. 'preciate it.

O.k. - I'll be down there for the 9:30 showing of the film.
Saturday I plan to attend the technology usage portion at 4:30 or so as well.

I know there are some creative tech heads out there on this list that will be
going. Let's hook up.

Let me know if this is possible. I've seen the thread start. Let's make it
official. I live in Sacto so I can't really take a leadership role on this
one. Somebody who has the city nailed down and knows it well (parking advice,
etc.) needs to set up a meeting place or something.

Let's make it happen!

rob.
http://www.citizenmag.com

P.s. BSP: Citi:Zen is a finalist for two New Media Magazine Invision awards
this year. Yahoo! National recognition finally. It feels good that CITISCAPE
is on to something and doing the web right! We are finalists in the "Best
Online Adult Magazine" as well as "Best Online Music Magazine". OH YEAH!

Though I'm sure there's more here than meets the eye, let's think twice
about this, folks ... here is a properly permitted event (I am assuming, I
don't know any of the people involved) ... with a large amount of planning
and production costs invested...  and at the last minute the Navy (who
apparently didn't have to approve legally in the first place, since the
permits had been issued without them) said, to paraphrase, "the neighbors
don't like loud music."  He said "we cancelled it out of respect for these
people" ...

This kind of last-minute slam might not happen to our underground parties,
because we avoid the process and risk the bust ... but larger parties in
this day and age need to follow the rules.... and here's one that (we have
to assume) did follow the rules, and this happens anyway.

Whether you like this kind of party or not, this kind of thing effects us
all.  Don't ever think that the Navy or the people who let this happen
(because we don't know who really is responsible for this) would do this to
Cool World and not to your party group.  Because they would, we're all the
same to them.

Last New Year's Eve, they shut down Cool World, they shut down Gateway and
they shut down Nomad.  It's all the same to them.... the violent response
at Cool World could have happened in the street outside the other parties
in my opinion, because I was there and felt the energy.  For crying out
loud, they even shut down 1015 Folsom that night.

This won't effect my weekend, cuz I wasn't going to this, but it may have
an effect in other ways in my life, and in yours too.  Just like the
yanking of the permit on the pier last year in SF felt like a turning point
in that city as far as venues were concerned.

Sucks.

True, but think of all the money they've made over the past few years......I
personally dont think this event getting cancelled is a big loss to the
scene. After the apparent failures of parties like Big Top and Electric
Highway, I think its just a sign that the scene needs to keep diggin'. Just
because the music is being heard by more people than ever right now doesnt
mean that we're going to be allowed to have huge events anytime we'd like. We
need to re-think what's happening here in SF in regards to this because the
situation is dismal. What ever happened to the Right to Dance movement? It
seems as though after they had the party at the Fed I havent heard
anything...I have friends who were involved with that so dont take that as an
attack of any kind please.

again later tonight and then even tomorrow.  Well see what's going on.  
Lets give him some time to change the recording.

I called the number and the guy did not say anything about Cyberfest 
being CANCELLED.  What is the deal, is it still going on?

I have a challenge ... for all you folks who so easily throw out the
phrase, "I Love You" to friends, acquaintances, etc. ....  try this.

Next time you're tempted to let those words roll so easily off your tongue,
try digging a little deeper, getting a little more real.

Say "One thing I really like (or, ok, love) about you is the way you
.................." and fill something that you actually admire or respect
or whatever about them....

I really appreciate a heartfelt compliment from people ... but I hear the
"I love you" stuff so often from people who hardly even know me, that it
becomes meaningless in that context.

Again, I think you are putting too much meaning in the usage of those three little words.  Love is an emotion, something you feel.  It goes beyond words.  There are so many other (better) ways to say "I love you", the words *are* almost boring.  I think they mean what people think they mean... whatever that may be from person to  person.  


At a party, it most probably means something like "Hey brother/sister raver, thanks for sharing my vibe."  Honestly, I don't use the words that often, I feel similar to you in that respect.  Although, in any context it still is sharing good feelings.  As long as that stays real, you can't go wrong.


If you put a damper on how people feel comfortable about expressing themselves, you may find people less likely to share shooga instead of salt. 


What do you do when someone says "I love you" at a rave?  Hopefully not shoot them down by verbally flaming them for using those words you hold so dear... that would be a bummer.  They are only trying to share thier good feelings, and feeling of brotherhood amongst friends and co-existers.  If saying "I love you" is the only way you feel right expressing your true love to someone, or the only way you can recieve it... dang, sorry, you're missing out.


Just saying "I love you" feels good.  If there is feeling or emotion behind it (which I would have to say is certain, under any condition), you are recieving someone's friendship, and oops... love... for however long.  It seems hard to believe anyone could be annoyed by someone sharing that.  I would agree hearing it can become old and repetative... but, hey, they are just trying to give what love they can.  


Your advice is sound, but harping on people for saying "I love you" is just not right, and it certainly isn't spreading any shooga.  Which we (as a people) are in desperately short supply.

Okay, okay, we've seen both sides of the fence... And here's the basic problem.

Greek has at least three words for love - English has only one.  This is a big
problem.

In Greek, "eros" means what we commonly assume love to mean -0 though it coverd
the gammut from lust to deep, overriding love for the physical.  "Agape" is the
kind of love that you feel for very close friends and acquaintances - it is a
chaste love,but can be very intense.  I don't rememebr the word for the third
type, but it is the kind of love one feels for family, parents or children, as
well as teachers, confidants, and one's home.

So both sides are right in this case - the phrase "I love you" is over-used,
but conversely people are putting too muh weight on it.  There's no very easy
way to remedy this without trying to force new words into usage in English,
unfortunately.

     Guyz & dolls,
     
     When does such unacceptable behavior by the various authorities get 
     bad enough to provoke more than whining on this list ? We all know the 
     litany of events screwed by the man. Perhaps we cared more or less 
     about some of them. If you remain silent who will speak out when they 
     come for you ?
     
     Lets start causing a fuss !! 
     
     I would like to compile a list of legal, permitted bay area events 
     ruined or harassed in the recent past. This would be useful in a 
     letter writing campaign.
     
     9/27/97 Cyberfest '97 - Navy cancels in week before event
     9/1/97 Burning Man - Extortion & harassment by local authorities 
     
     :
     :
     
     1/1/97 Cool World - Shut down 
     (Leslie - were Nomad, Gateway parties permitted ?)
     
     Anybody remember which party @ pier 45 was dumped on by Willie in the 
     week prior ?
     
     How about a demonstration parade/party ? Lets get on the news with 
     this ! Can we get it together and really UNITE to save our scene ? 
     
     Your parents wouldn't have put up with this crap for pity's sake.
     
     Land of the free - my arse.

I think that the promoters have alot to do with it... but when it comes
down to it, the people have changed.

Many of us will agree that the scene today is completely different than the
scene of a few years ago due to the following facts:

1) There are a hell of a lot more rave-goers 
2) There is a hell of a lot more money to be made
3) The promoters opened up the scene to a hell of a lot more people by over
promoting which brought in another huge element of people (x% of which are
very cool and that we like to be around and y% that we can't stand)

Im glad of all of the new cool people which I, and other promoters, have
brought to this scene, and if I could go back in time to when I started
promoting I wouldn't do anything differently (i.e. not promoting so hard,
etc.) What has happened to this scene is inevitable. It happens to every
scene (the hippies, rock & roll, grunge, goth, etc.) Everything will
inevitably become commercial. (Even country music went commercial, and if
country can go commercial, anything can:)

Did the promoters do the wrong thing by opening up the scene... I don't
think so.

Did the promoters open up the scene for the wrong reasons... yup... money
is a corrupter of people. But this was inevitable. Wherever there is a
chance to make money, people are going to try to make money.

(and I wont even try to lie by saying that I haven't been tempted by the
cash either)

But I've said it before and I've said it again... those of us who feel the
vibe have got to keep on spreading the vibe.

hello all!  just moved down here and signed onto this list and thought i'd

I've found 
(and I think that Dear Abby would agree)

that the best etiquette is 
to ask for their e-mail address, 

and send them a flame on Monday.

I want to make love to all of you 
in my bed,
tonight.

And when you do say it to that person you love, MEAN IT!  Be sure about it.
Don't be saying them words for the moment, and not mean it.  You'll end up
hurting someone that thought you were telling them the truth.  Lessons in
life!

Take care,

Hi sol (and cc-ing the list of course)...

Once again, I invite you to try to substitute real content for shortcuts
.... yes, love is an emotion, but no, i don't think i'm "putting too much
meaning in the usage of those three little words."

Just as I think we fall into lazy patterns in many social interactions (hi,
hug, how are you? quick shallow interchanges) ... I think we fall into lazy
patterns of expressing ourselves verbally.

If you're at a party, and you want to thank someone for sharing the vibe
with you, why not say "Sol, your energy is awesome and I want to thank you
for sharing this amazing vibe with me tonight."  Now, I don't know about
you, but I'd much rather hear something personal like that than "Dude, I
love you."  I mean, we didn't need a beer commercial to show us how silly
that can sound.

Do I "shoot people down by verbally flaming them at a party"?  Sheez, you
obviously don't know me.  I cherish the open loving nature of the people in
our community and I treat them and their emotions with complete respect.
But as one of the "elders" of this scene (yep, older than dirt), there are
things I've learned and feel a responsibility to share.

So, sometimes when someone says to me "Leslie, I love you" and I have the
feeling that they may not be quite conscious of the actual meaning and
importance of the words they say, I might look them in the eye and say
"Thank you.  What is it about me that makes you say that," coming from a
place of love and respect myself.

See, to me, operating from a place of love and allowing that conscious
awareness to permeate your daily life is the goal .. and just saying the
words without recognizing the true meaning underneath actually ends up
separating you from the very essence of love.

So, for those of you who I have said "I love you" to on this list... please
know that when I say it, I mean it.

Much love (which is a much more universal feeling and therefore different
from "I love you"),

Leslie

I hate to tell you this but coffee shops DO have vibes, that's what gets 
people coming back.  It's what made me want to spin @ city E since the 
very first Slow Roasted.  
It's the fact that I know just about everybody who works there, and get 
a smile from them (and most of the clientel as well) each time I come 
in.  

good vibes. also good lattes, mochas, cappucinos, americanos, etc.  

I'm sorry if we left a mess tho.  I know how much that sux.

So people, when you visit city e, remember to clean up after yourselves.  
And THEN Danny will give/feel a much happier vibe. :)

Does anybody remember the store..."Gemco"...or "Alpha Beta".  They were 
in Redwood City about a decade ago.  I only remember them slightly 
because I'm only "Twamp".

okay, i don't know if i'm the only one, or i'fe i'm just being
ignorant about something really obvious, but my email's have been
doing bizarre things. so apologies to those you you who are getting
multiples of this message!

so anyway, this was suggested to me:

>You might want to suggest a meeting place to the list.  Behind the
pond at the Palace of Fine Arts is an dome.  We could all meet under
it.

say, around 9 or so? the film(s) start at 9:30. and then afterwards???

cheers - e. :)

Sheesh - aren't we all getting a little serious here? Flaming
someone 'cos they say "I love you"?

One of the things I find so wonderful about this whole scene
is the refreshingly positive vibe that refuses to go away no
matter how cynical and weird things get on the list sometimes.
And I have to say it really picks me up when Randy or Stariana
or Jen or whoever just broadcasts a happy "Love you all!" message.
Jeez, I even SAVE messages like that for rainy days!

I don't need to dissect it and think "well I don't think I ever
even MET Jen, so who is she to say I love you?". Obviously it's
not that kind of love. To me it's love for the scene that we're
all a part of.

I'm not the kind of person to go up to strangers and say "I love
you" at a party, but I do feel a very powerful sense of love for
the scene and the people that are all a part of it. I think it's
this that people are trying to express.

I'll never forget taking a looong nap at a Lightseed party at Organic
earlier this year, and waking at about 4am and wandering downstairs
and just basking in the vibe - the music was totally going off and
people were dancing their little hearts out, and I was filled with
awe and, yes, love, of this whole scene and how people work their
behinds off, not for money but to give people a good time, and how
people come together and commune all night in dancing and sharing.
And you catch a stranger's eye and you smile and you can tell they
feel it too. Yes, I love this scene and the people that make it
happen. That's a different kind of love than you feel for an
individual, but no less valid.

It would be a sad thing if those people are now too scared to share 
that feeling, 'cos last time someone else did, they got flamed!
So let's not come down on people who feel that sense of love and
feel like they want to shout it out loud - hell, I do sometimes!

Love!

- Martin

adventurous, and the ResFest party should be a good show too.  The

on Sunday (plus the Spundae) is always interesting...

DEFINATELY 9!
i think that there is going to be a big turn out (i could be wrong...) but
it seems like a good idea to get there a little early, 1/2 an hour should
be good!

afterwards...?  i bet we'll all have different ideas of what would be a
good place... i used to like nikita (although the last time i went -2
months ago- i got bad vibes) but it usually has a great diversity in music-
house, drum&bass, techno, loungy stuff upstairs... "sometime for the whole
family" that might be a good place... any other suggestions? it is 21+ but
i don't know any other places on a fri night... or we could just all wait
til after and THEN decide...

Cybertribe,

On the topic of this "I love you" thread...

In New York City, we had sort of a similar problem in the rave scene. 
People were using the phrase, "You fucking asshole!" far too loosely and
often--even when what they really meant was "That wasn't very nice of you
to sell me bunk E," or "I don't appreciate you talking about me behind my
back," or "I think that's my backpack," or even "Excuse me, you just
stepped on my foot, and a minute ago your 'tickle me elmo' was hitting me
in the face as you were trying to do something that looked a lot like
dancing." 

So, after a lot of heated discussion on the topic, we solved the problem
by learning to reply, "Up yours, dickhead!"

I wholeheartedly agree.

No, you're right, I don't.  Although, my point was to say "shooting
down..." would very obviously be the lame thing to do... and that we *all*
should be accepting in eachother's forms of communication.  From crude like
a stone tool, to the full meaningfulness of an emotion which holds the
fabric of life together.

I think that's a pretty deep thinker for a raver who's  probably just
trying to keep from biting their binki in half while aligning the fur on
their teddy... although, I agree that they should perhaps put more thought
into their choice of words.  

I choose to interperate and use those words as you do Leslie.  "Just saying
"I love you" feels good."  The reason is those words evoke (or should
evoke) an emotion, as you very obviously well know.  I know the "what do
you do at a ..." question may not have seemed so, it was... in fact,
rhetorical.  I made an attempt at being all-encompassing with my last post.
 I certainly did not mean to infer you would actually be that harsh. My
statements were not meant to be directed at any one person, I simply felt
the posts were more or less flaming people for expressing themselves in a
positive, friendly way.  I don't see that as wrong, and find it hard to
swallow these people deserve "training" of any sort for their choice of

i just saw peshay on sunday here in boston... and he was good. really good.
my only complaint was that instead of playing off his mistakes he would take
a second try at the mix. but this is not one of those UK dj's who is going
to come over here and just drop dubplates on you with no care given to the
mixing. he has SKILLZ... anyway, i'd like to see your reviews come
tuesday...

 Well, I don't throw around the words "I Love You" carelessly, but I do say
them quite often.  It's just for me, there are different degrees of love.
 There's the love you have for your friends, your family, your BEST friend,
signifigant other, or someone you just met.  I personally love all ravers
because we share something special, and I'm so thankful to be a part of it
that I want to heap my happy feelings on everyone.  So when I say I love you,
I mean it... it just might not be as huge as you're making it out to be.
 with the quantity and the quality I'm signing off... love to you all!

 Hey there,

:hey, a weird question: is ketamine made for horses or cats?

    Good question, Ketamine is used on both humans and animals. The use it
produce anesthesia.

Now for the technical stuff.

     Ketamine hydrochloride is a nonbarbiturate substance, that is used IV
and intramuscularly (a type of shot) to produce anesthesia. The patient
becomes cataleptic ( a trance like state) and may appear to be awake, but is
unaware of the environment and unresponsive to pain.

     This really only applies if you were to take the suggested amount which
would be more that most people would want to take for recreational purposes.
I read in one of those book you find in a head shop, that you can mix the
ketamine with, I think, baking powder, and then bake it do to just a powder
and snort it.

   I remember when I took my dog to the vet to get something done, and they
gave her that. I asked if I could get some also. MAN, did I get a weird
look.

To whinny or purr is up to you.

Feel free to direct all medical and drugs related questions to

ketamine is a general veterinary anaesthetic.  but it is also used as a
children's anaesthetic because you don't have to worry so much about the
tricky heartrate and breathing stuff that you do with opiates--hard to
calculate the morphine dosage for an 8-year-old.  a FOAF went in for some
surgery and asked for ketamine but was told that "they don't use it for
this procedure because it can give adults 'nightmares.'"

"nightmares."  or just a really deep k-hole?

As of  now, The CYBERFEST III event IS STILL HAPPENING!!!!!!

I would love to go into details about all the behind the scene stuff
going on, but I do not have the time right now.

AS FAR AS  I KNOW, THIS EVENT WILL HAPPEN.

Don't believe the media, the Navy, Bass, or any thing else, trust only
the voice lines.

Organized entertainment is always out to destroy independent promoters,
under any means possible.   This is another typical example of how big
time organized entertainment (no names will be used) has once again
tried unsuccessfully to cock-block up-n-coming independent
entertainment.  It is the same as the mafia collecting "protection"
money  :  "You pay .. or we screw you"  well, CWP never sold out,
despite what people may say, and that's why their last few events have
experienced problems... Direct sabotage from the BIG BOYS ON THE
BLOCK.   Pulling strings through all their connections, making it hard
for the little guys to come up in the world.  Typical Player Hating.

Gota run, had a VERY long day, and need some rest....

Keep the Faith, and Keep it real

Damn right I mean it.  I'm not the one to say a deep feeling like that
unless I know for sure it's from the heart.  I too can't stand it when
the phrase is used like toilet paper.  It totally kills the value of it
when used to much.

Hello everybody.  I'm back from Boston and an extremely ridiculous
summer which included far too little sleep.  Hope everybody is doing
well and I still know a few people on the list.  I can't wait to get up
to the city and was just wondering what the prime gala is going to be
this weekend.  Hopefully I'll see all the old faces and meet some new. 
If you remember me from last year,  drop an email and say hi.
goooood bye,
Bret

Just what exactly is a "twamp"??? Does that mean I'm an elderly twamp
because I remember them vividly??  =)

I remember the Gemco in Dublin -- I used to buy 8 track tapes and Atari
2600 games there!

how about these flashbacks:
-Kid Power shoes (mid 70's)
-Andre The Giant bodyslamming Big John Studd for $25,000 (back when WWF
was cool)
-Watching the evening news as they counted the days of the Iran hostage
crisis
-When Reagan got shot
-Tuesday nights on ABC--
	8:00 Happy Days
	8:30 Laverne & Shirley (hated it...)
	9:00 Three's Company 
	9:30 The Ropers (Stanley kicked ass...)
-Friday Night Fights on MTV back in '83 or '84 (they'd show two videos
and then people would call in to vote for their favorite... Def Leppard
was champ for like 8 million weeks straight...)
-Old school cable boxes where if you punched in certain numbers at the
same time, you could unscramble the channel (great when you're 14 and
your hormones are raging like crazy and you just found out that Playboy
came out with their own cable network...)
-The "ghost" in Three Men and a Baby
-Girls with poofy hair (Hair Bears) or that f*$%*ed up look where they
would make their bangs straight up
-Big Wheel
-Sit 'N Spin (don't they still make these?)
-The original version of the board game "Operation" where it would give
you a jolt of electricity if you messed up (how masochistic is that?)
-Atari 2600,5200,7800, Intellivision, Coleco Vision, Vectrex (anyone
remember Vectrex?  I STILL play with mine once in a while...)
-Mr. Potato head packaged with a pipe
-Rubik's Cube, Rubik's Snake, Rubik's Revenge
-Reggie candy bar (named after Reggie Jackson)
-Le Tigre' shirts (Remember their commercials? "Hold that tiger...")
-Gennerra HyperColor clothes
-Cavaricci pants
-Pac Man Fever (I have it on 12"...  why I'm admitting that, I don't
know.)
-When Milli Vanilli got busted
-Does anyone remeber Monchichis? (monchichi monchichi, oh so soft and
cuddly...)
-etc., etc.

Anyways, my 2 cents...
J
(doughboy!)

Ok, folks this is a LONG ass post, so...

This summer I was lucky enough to do a solo trek through Europe and during
my wayward travels, I ended up going to all manner of dance clubs,
discotheques, grungy bars, and raves.  Well, raves should be singular,
because I only went to one rave.  But, let me say, it was the biggest
party I've ever been to, as well as an intensive learning experience.
Here's a little review of the party from the eyes of a neophytic raver.

Set outside at  "recreatiegebied spaarnwoude", an outdoor park about the
the size of golden gate park, with lots of open hills and valleys.  There
were big stone sculptures throughout the park.  One of them, size and
appearance, looked like the Millenium Falcon had crashed into the hillside
and was sticking straight up, buried in the earth.  It was held during the
day from 10:00 - 23:00.  When it got dark they went crazy with the lasers
and lit up the stone sculptures with geometric designs and such.  I was
really impressed with the location.  Gorgeous.

Now as far as the music was concerned, also huge in scope.  I heard all
that dance music has to offer, and learned a lot in the process.
This was all taking place in 11 circus tents spread throughout the valley.
Themed after the Solar System, here's a breakdown of the areas; The Sun
(Main Stage/Global Grooves), Saturn (Detroit/Minimal Techno), Uranus
(Techno/Trance), Jupiter (Hard-house/Techno), Neptune(Happy Trance),
Mercury (Acid Trance), Mars (Goa Trance), Milky Way (Dub), Pluto
(Triphop/Chemical/DrumN'Bass), and Moon (Ambient).  Carl Cox, CJ Bolland,
Joey Beltram, Derrick May spun as well as a slew of local DJs.  

I stood out like a wrinkled pea in a sea of smooth peas, but it didn't
matter and everyone seemed to dig the fact that I was there having a good
time.  I was in heaven.  Beautiful blue eyes, rosy cheeks, blond hair.
I'm a sucker for scandinavian women.  Anyways, I spent most of my time in
Pluto and Uranus, but I visited each planet and people were going nuts.
They just let loose with SO much energy and abandon.  I didn't see any
circle dancing, because everyone was bouncing around and sharing the
experience.  Granted, they're not great dancers, but with that much
energy, who gives a fuck?  I guess what I'm saying is that there were no
inhibitions and I really fed off of that.  Sharing the vibe with 15,000
other people, it was too much for me, at times.  The party was also
incredibly well-organized as far as I could tell.  Schedules were posted
everywhere and ran pretty much on time.  They had pretty in-depth
booklets giving locations, schedules, and dj profiles.  Beverage coupons
were sold and could be redeemed for beer, water, soft drinks.  There were
vendors of party goods, corporate sponsors, what not.  It was all very
smooth and well run.  The one problem I had was that after the party, the
whole place was covered with empty water bottles and trash.  It was
everywhere.  

[what follows is a more personal account, which you can skip because the
above is a sufficient description of the party, but if your curious read
on! :)]


Now that you've got a general perspective about this party, I'm going to
relate from a more personal perspective.  The night before, I was in
Prague at a preparty where Afrika Bambaata was spinning some really funky
shit (that's another story).  At this point, I planned on staying in
Prague for another night, when while digging through my shit I see the
DanceValley flyer that I picked up in Amsterdam a week ago.  Made a quick
decision, consulted the train schedule, and was able to catch an early
morning to Amsterdam.  When I got into Am'dam at 8:00, I cruised over to
My Home hostel, where I stayed 2 weeks ago, (I highly recommend it)
chatted with Chris the manager and left my bags to get my "other gear".  I
bought a dose of Copelandia cubensis (magic mushrooms:) at Conscious
Dreams, and then I cruised over to a coffee shop got some of my favorite
stinky buds, Jack Herer and White Widow.  (God, this place is nirvana if
ever there was.)  All stocked up along with some E from the only place I
call home, San Francisco, I was ready to send myself off on a spiritual
journey of a lifetime.  There really is nothing like taking mind-enhancing
substances in foreign environs.

So, I hop onto a shuttle full of kick back easy going Dutch people, and
prepare myself.  I haven't gotten a ticket yet, $40.  So when I get there
I'm directed to the entry gate, where a large crowd is being funneled
through 4 gates of security guards taking tickets and frisking people.
It's hot and sunny, and after waiting 30 minutes sharing sweat with
strangers I'm told that I need to go back to the ticket booth and get a
ticket.  I'm feeling really stupid, especially because I'm going to have
to wade through a mass of people.  Shit. Well, one girl named Hanakah was
sympathetic to my woes, and it turned out to be the beginning of a new
friendship.   Anyways,  I play it cool and make it out.  End up going to
the guestlist entry booth and the security guard sneaks me in and takes my
admission fee.  Guess he had his little racket going on the side.  So I
make it in without getting frisked, but who gives a fuck since they're not
confiscating drugs, anyway?   Usually at our massives I'm a little worried
they'll find my pipe and stash.  Haha I love it. Amsterdam rules.

Well, on my way in I bump into Hanakah again and I tell her my little
story.  Then I'm off on my own again and am amazed as I walk into the
valley by the magnitude of this party.  First thing I do is hike up a hill
plant myself down, skin up a joint, and soak it all in.  Some English guys
cruise over and say hi, and while sharing joints I ask them about the DJ
lineups and what I should check out.  They tell me the skinny, and then
leave after getting pleasantly buzzed from Amsterdam's finest.  The
mushies in my bag are calling my name; I promptly chomp about 1.5 grams of
dry and distinctively tasting mind candy and wash it down with some
orangina.  Hehe, the Millenium Falcon took a nose dive into the other side
of the valley.  Well, I'm about ready to find a place to get a groove on,
so down the hill and through the valley I go.  I end up finding some happy
trance music and start bouncing around with the 100 or so other people.
At this time, it's about 1:00, and the tents are still waiting to fill up,
but people are having fun, and so am I.  Happy trance gets to be a little
to fast for my unwarm legs to handle so I cruise over to find something a
little less frantic.  I end up in the Dub tent, and chill for a little
bit.  Around this time, people are showing me their auras around their
faces and skin.  Everyone is glowing with so much happiness I can see
their energy emanating from their bodies.  Everything is resonating with
vibrancy, colors are alive and pulsing.  I want to be a part of that.  I'm
having an ok time, but still feeling a bit like an outsider,  I go off and
start wandering again.  I start thinking about the challenges of
readapting in new environments, and how rewarding it is.  I start thinking
about home, my buddies, my ex-girlfriend.  Thinking about Erin gets me
into a funk, so

My next stop is the Sun, main stage area, where I do a little dancing.  I
get the feeling that everyone is looking at me without really looking.  At
least they're polite about not staring, which is not the case in Spain.  I
feel out of place so I sit down by some sound mixers.   Along comes
Hanakah to save me.  We end up talking a little, and she gives me her
notebook to write in.  At this point, I guess everyone feels that it's ok
to stare now that I'm talking to Hanakah so I now I feel I'm on stage, but
I'm suffering from stage fright.  Hanakah takes off for a couple of
minutes to leave me to my musings.  Well, my writing abilities are gone,
so I end up taking a fistful of colored pencils and draw swirly lines over
the page.    Shit, is that all I can do?  When she comes back, she takes
me to another tent and introduces me to her group of friends, Leisha,
Michele, and Eduardo.  They take me into their family and we have a fun
dancing to jungle.  Their love and warmth cheer me up more than they know.
Now that I'm feeling positive, at this point, I decide that some E would
be nice to experience in this setting.  Well, once I start e'ing, I find
that zone called self, and then Hanakah for some reason starts hitting a
funk.  So I try my best to cheer her up, but she tells me its beyond that
and releases me to go explore and have fun with Eduardo.  Eduardo and I
hit the goa trance tent, and get lost in our mind space.  Well, it's
gotten dark, and the rest of the evening I'm cruising to different areas
dancing and having a good time. Occassionally, I stop and check to see how
Hanakah is doing and give her hugs.  Towards the end of the party, Carl
Cox starts spinning and the main stage valley is packed with people going
crazy.   I lose my new friends in the mass, and end up finding the
community of happy bouncing people.  I had such a great time.
Unfortunately, I don't get a chance to say goodbye to hanakah and her
friends, but the next morning I get a call at the hostel from her, even
though she didn't know where I was staying.  By some act of fate, the
first number she called on her hostel list ended up being the right one.
I thought that was pretty nifty.  So she ends up showing me around her
favorite parts of Amsterdam for the next day and a half, but that's
another story. 

Well, this turned out to be a huge post, but it's also going into my
journal, so I really couldn't skimp on details.  If you made it this far,
I hope you enjoyed the story, thanks for reading, and if you like I could
tell you stories about Ibiza, summer rave-island retreat for Europe. 
And one thing more, while I had an amazing experience at Dance Valley, it
doesn't top the love I felt at PlayNice, go figure.  :)  

WIth love,
george

Hi John-
Great idea-you can't complain if you haven't tried to do something about it.
The party at the pier last year that was cancelled was "Nation", by Spundae
productions.  They also had their New Years party at 1015 Folsom shut down
last year. (That's why I'm headed to London for this NYE-don't want to risk a
repeat performance this year). 
Let me preface this by saying I generally prefer smaller more intimate
underground events, but admit I usually manage to enjoy myself at massives as
well (as long as the music's good). Some of my best times have been at huge
commercial events - not here but overseas- Mayday, Love Parade, and Tribal
Gathering. You need commercial support to have as much talent,diversity and
depth as is encompased by those type of events. Enjoy each for what it is.
Both of those events involved top, well respected and influential
international talent, (Sasha, Laurent Garnier respectively -although it
would've been just as bad to shut down Joe no-name bedroom DJ). The city
officials don't realize they are cutting off their nose to spite their face.
SF comes across as a backwater disorganized throwback to the rest  of the
civilized world. By shutting down safe, permitted parties they are driving
all parties more underground (which is cool in most respets but usually less
safe) and extinguishing chances for increases in tourism and the influx of $$
associated with that (you'd think that's what the city would want-not
necessarily what I want though). In Europe and Japan there are entire travel
agencies based on rave travel. Berlin's techno festival "Love Parade" brings
over 1 million people to that city every year, making it the second biggest
tourist event. Why is American culture so reluctant to accept new things and
ideas?
I'm by no means saying that we should all of a sudden have huge commercial
events all the time, but I do believe there is a place for successful,
sanctioned, commercial type events. It won't kill the underground. They are
two different animals entirely. No one will force you to go to a commercial
event, so why wish it out of existence?
I know there is the tendency to reject anything that ends up being accepted
by the mainstream (i.e. if it becomes popular I can't like it anymore)...but
that indicates that the driving force of your involvement in "rave" or
whatever you call it is rebellion and desire to be different. That's OK but
shouldn't it come down to the music? At the end of the day it's the same song
whether it is being played by Carlos at a Full Moon party or by that guy on
LIVE 105 Sat night at midnight. It moves you or it doesn't.
True eventually it might end up getting watered down but then you just have
to sift through the junk a little more to find the gems.
The above is all IMHO of course - thanks - jd

FYI - DJ Dag is at Nikita tonight - he recently relocated from Frankfurt
Germany where he played with Sven Vath at the Omen Club. He also was one of
the original residents at Universe (London promoters of Tribal Gathering,
etc). If you like techno but not just the boom-boom-boom kind check him out.
I saw him do a 7 hour set in May that kept me on my feet the whole time.
Should be a nice change of pace for SF (IMHO). Hopefully he won't water it
down. See ya there! jd

It appears Cyberfest is still on, but I wanted to address the "apparant
failures" of Big Top, etc. I assume you meant financial failure or sheer
turnout failure. I didn't go to the Electric Hwy so this just refers to Big
Top. 

Its true there were about half as many people as expected and no matter how
many people turn up that limitless expanse of space located in Oakland at
85th and whatever street will always LOOK empty.

Even though there was nothing resembling a vibe and no continuity or flow due
to scheduling band, DJ, DJ, band, DJ etc and jungle, techno, d n b, trance,
techno..start stop start stop start...and splitting the line-up fairly evenly
in two rooms so you constantly ran back and forth and worried about missing x
y or z (you get the picture)....seeing Derrick May and Juan Atkins on 4 decks
side by side was one of the high points of my musical experiences.Not so
little a slice of history there, only magnified by the presence of Kevin
Saunderson, Joey Beltram and Grooverider. A virtual Hall of Fame that
musically speaking could only be considered a success. (IMHO)  jd

this i just can't understand...

with that went keoki, as far as i'm concerned, along with all my vinyl
clothing...

not that i was heavily involved in it anyway - it was on its way out the

again, maybe it was all the bridge&tunnel cheeseballs that seemed to like
him...

not to mention his ego is the size of fucking montana.

                                       (that was my favorite episode of 
The Real World).

>ain't into that...  keep it behind the tables...

I give Keoki credit for being a good marketer, for creating a personality 
that people can latch on to easily when they first discover techno 
music...Kinda like the Madonna of techno...The title and art of his CD 
makes that "I'm hyper-aware of my own image presentation" comparison with 
Madonna easy....Think back -- if you were 17 years old and just 
discovering techno, the rave scene, and LSD concurrently -- wouldn't 
Keoki's music appeal to you and wouldn't his personality attract you if 
nothing other than for the fact that he makes himself highly visible?

I think for a lot of people Keoki serves as a very large and ornate 
gateway to the infinitely larger worlds of club and rave culture, and 
IMHO that's not such a bad thing to be. Someone's gotta do it. 

I'm not even one of those people, I didn't pass through the Keoki Door to 
get into the Church of Rave (more like I was conceived and born within -- 
at least I like to think I was =), but I still go back and lsiten to 
older Keoki tapes and CDs once in awhile and even years later, though 
it's completely contribed now, I can still feel and understand that 
spaced-out-and-futuristic appeal he sprinkles through your glo-stick head.

Speaking of heads, his ego is much maligned in the media, but from my 
personal experiences I've found him approachable, pleasant, and a lot 
nicer than some groups of kids I see at parties week after week. I'm the 
only one I know who feels that way, though, for what it's worth. =) He's 
not angelic, he's not evil -- take him for what he is and move on past 
his doorway. 

It's the American in us that keeps us relatively intrested in Keoki -- 
he's charging down a path that dead rock stars pave and repave time and 
time again. With all the changes he's experienced in life, all the 
rumors, half-truths, and truths that shadow him, I think he deserves a 
little more peace (though he doesn't want it) than we give him as he 
steamrolls down that road.


Man, I can't believe I just wrote a page of text on Keoki. I must be 
pretty damn bored.

love and happy friday,

I read an interesting interview recently with Keoki (i think in Mixmag 
...?)

anyway, he is pretty much unashamed to admit that his full intentions 
have been, from the start, to become
the superstar of the scene, to manipulate himself, his image, and his 
lack of skills to appeal to the Idol-hungry masses.

His sheer honesty almost made it acceptable, in a twisted, pathetic, 
cool kind of way.   It's kind of inspiring, a rags-to-riches, American 
Dream sort of success...you can become anything you want if you present 
yourself the right way...
(in this case, an arrogant, polyester wearing, trainwrecking fashion 
model crackhead.)

Funny thing is, it worked.

um, i'm taking him for what he is - an egotistically idiot...  and his ego
is apparent in more than just the media...  keoki was a common new york
street occurrence you could deal with on a near daily basis, bumping into
him at record stores, etc...  he was always accompanied by some spaced-out
kheads in 16 inch platforms and expecting people to clear the floor for
him...  (I'd clear the floor for him but i think he can do a pretty good
job of that himself)...

Okay, whatever...  you guys can HAVE the "new improved keoki" over there...
we're not so forgiving over here...

i'd agree...  i can't believe you did it either.  ;-)

Well I head on out to Justice League in SF around 9:30pm.  This new club
was pretty impressive with its decor.  Plenty of places to sit and nice art
work.  It took me about 40 minutes to find parking, but it was worth it.
While I was looking for parking I saw a scene shooting for "Party of Five"
on some corner.  The officer wasn't to happy with me sitting at the stop
sign rubber necking. ;)  He came up and said something like "This ain't
your private driveway".  Ok.  So I drove off.   

So I finally find a place to park, and I walk to the club.  Noel was on
when I got in there.  Good music, and a nice set. =)  It was nice to see
Thad, Alex(science), Lola, and Sho.  There were also some heads there like
Jason(spun), and Tony.  That was odd seeing them at a Drum & Bass thang.  I
saw a couple more folks whos names I forgot.

So I kicked it till Optical came on.  Or should I say falling a sleep on my
chair.  I was even doing the head banging thing, you know when you can't
keep your head up and you try as hard as you can, but it just looks like
you're banging your head to some metal! ;)  Ha_ha! 

Anyways, Optical came on and he had the dope tracks.  Can you say Dub
plates!  He had that place going.  The bass he was dropping was awesome,
but the club needs to invest in some subs, bass bins, something!  There
just wasn't enough to fill the room.  The ceiling was to high and the sound
was bouncing.  All well, over all the club was cool, and it has a lot of
potential.

I headed on out about 1:45am.  I dreaded the drive back to Santa Clara, but
I had a great time! =)  

Nothing like three hours of sleep and going to work...

Bu_bye!

Totally. But I have to say that LifeForce (Saturday night) was a perfect
example of ravers coming together to make a cool party out of a
disorganized, screwed up party. We all came together and made it special.
All those bands that played for free. That is what it's all about.

Yeah. The Coolworld make up party was strange. The only think I liked
about it was Hardsequencer. It was too crowded to boogy. 

I say that we demolish the 89th street (the wharehouse need home base that
is being used for the large parties now). It's the worst venue... in my
opinion (and many others) it radiates a cold, dark, empty, vibe. There is
this vast emptiness in there. You have one big wharehouse and there are
only 3 music arenas. There should be a seperation in the main room that
could create two areas... and maybe add some black light in the middle of
that place... some couches, a chill room... it's just too dark and cold.
Anyone that ever trips in there would hate walking through there alone...
it sucks..... every party I've gone to there has giving me and my buddies
the same feeling. Unless you're into the dark techno stuff you'll probably
feel the same way. I wish I could have been there on Friday to see what it
was like....

Massives are great if they possess the right kinda of ravers to create the
vibe you want. You have to have twice as many Candy ravers in there to
make it extra happy... I wish you kids would come over to this space one
time and make it extra joyful..... receiving a fat hung from one of you
candy ravers while I'm walking through *the void* would make it much
nicer.. hehe. :)

Hi there..

I am sittin' here at work kinda zoned... looking out into the buildings of
downtown Oakland... a thick blanket of gray clouds hover high above. The
sun is pushing the blanket away and the blue sky is starting to poke it's
way through....    and I'm thinking... "This Sunday is the Folsom street
thing, and it would be a great opportunity to meet a lot of you guys and
for us to hang out..."..  I know that Derek and I are going, plus some
none raver friends of mine...   and I was going to e-mail some of you and
ask ya.... so If you wanna do something and hookup.. lets definatley do
this... I'll get Rubilicious to go as well... we can all meet and place
faces to names....  and have some fun.... watch BT up on the roof... maybe
go up there too and chat with him.. maybe push him off and start our own
little thing.... (forgive me my brain is tired ... stressful week... and
my morbid sense of humor is shining through)...   

Sound cool?

Byroni... .. .

Dear kids at Sfraves

I'm sorry to say this will be my last post on sfraves for some time.
unfortunately at this time the scene seems to be hurting my home life
more than helping further myself. I love the Sf UG scene, but at this
moment i can only stay away. I hope everyone had a lot of fun at my
party, I threw it for you guys. Well anyways, at this time school is
number 1 priorty, number 2 priorty is to get out of the dog house I've
seem to put myself in at home. 
I don't know when the next party I will be at or the next time I'll
post to the list but until then "I'll miss you all."
Have a good day, a good week, and remember to do something for me
*Play Nice*.
love~jeremy

Geez Vlad Live 105 was advertising Cyberfest fer chrissakes. Don't you
consider them part of the "Organized Entertainment" industry?

I don't know if I should be happy or sad. I'm happy I suppose because
people that had permits and had gone through the process aren't going to
get them pulled at the 11th hour. I'm sad because I'm sure it will be
yet another in a string of vibeless, fucked up money fests for Cool World.
Anyone want to take bets on how many people get hauled away in ambulances
this year?

Well, this should date me - I remember when they were having the bicentennial
celebrations (!!) and the live firewords down around the Statue of Liberty, and
the comments about the battleship in harbor being able to shell my sleepy
little hometown of Binghamton, NY.  (Ya, I'm a back-easter, too - but I'm in
remission, and I think I'm cured. :)

CoolWorldProd is large and organized.  They better be to be throwing
parties of this caliber.  So how can it be said that there are "big
boys" trying to squeeze them out?  They _are_ the big boys.

hrm.

I just want to hear Wintermute and the rest of that ass-kicking music.

>sorry, i don't HAVE a glo-stick head...  never did...

well: a) a spacey glo-stick head isn't necessarily a bad thing, I was 
jsut trying to articulate a state of mind, b) I wasn't refering to you 
and probably not anyone here on SFRaves -- the paragraph was referring to 
newcomers to party culture and that sense of awe and wonder when you 
first get into it -- that's what Keoki appeals to. sorry for not 
communicating more clearly on that one.

>um, i'm taking him for what he is - an egotistically idiot...  and his ego
>is apparent in more than just the media...  keoki was a common new york
>street occurrence you could deal with on a near daily basis, bumping into
>him at record stores, etc...  he was always accompanied by some spaced-out
>kheads in 16 inch platforms and expecting people to clear the floor for
>him...  (I'd clear the floor for him but i think he can do a pretty good
>job of that himself)...

i dunno i think there's a lot of attention-needing egoists in every town, 
in every club scene. do we as a culture really need to isolate Keoki for 
this when there's local groups of club kids who are just as obnoxious and 
attention-seeking, if not moreso? and what's worse, is they don't pull it 
off as well.

i mean, not to bring up the dreaded d word, but some people nurturely 
like drama, like creating it and rolling around in it, and i don't think 
it's necessarily o.k. to not like someone simply because they need drama 
and attention in their life -- especially if you can pull it off by 
"branding yourself" (not in the physical sense but in the marketing 
sense) with these qualities the way keoki does.

it's not somethign i want to surround myself with, it's not something i 
want anyone i surround ymself with to be surrounded with, but some people 
-- for whatever psychological fuck-up -- need that. i'm not going to feel 
ill-will for someone simply for that.

>you guys can HAVE the "new improved keoki" over there...
>we're not so forgiving over here...

why not? =)



>>Man, I can't believe I just wrote a page of text on Keoki. I must be
>>pretty damn bored.
>
>i'd agree...  i can't believe you did it either.  ;-)

i can't believe you replied.

i can't believe i replied to your reply.

didn't mean to upset you Dori -- which I think I did -- i'm sure neither 
of us really care that much either way about Keoki anyway. =)

have a good weekend. =)

	Funny to think that Keoki could be reading posts from 
this list and relishing all the attention and controversy 
which so thrives on.... :)
	Hey, give the guy a break -- you gotta be pretty damn 
cocky to get out there and be all that he is - and hopes to
still become - don't know if I personally could be that way,
but it's all a *part* of what makes our scene so unique...

	Though i must admit the polyester is a bit overdone  :) 

Luv n hugs,

What exactly are they implying by putting Trance/Techno is Uranus?
I mean, I personally would feel pretty violated about the whole thing?

Um.. enough of me.  I've decided to see what it would be like to send a
post that's really short.  I think I hate it, too fast to write, and
totally unsatisfying.  At least I tried it once...

I don't feel my age too often, but I sure did when I found myself telling
one of my friends about how amazing the fireworks were in Philadelphia on
July 4, 1976 during the bicentennial ...

my boyfriend (later husband) and I watched from the roof of our warehouse
in Old City, just 2 blocks away from two of the main spots they were
shooting them off at the waterfront and Independence Hall... and these
HUUUUGGGEEE crazy things would explode DIRECTLY over our heads as we laid
there on the roof....  BOOM and showers of color!!! amazing...  now THAT
was a party!

.... and he said, um, Leslie, you know I wasn't even *born* then!!

where's my cane?

;^)

Isn't the name of Keoki's new mix tape something like "Big ass ego trip" or
something?

I think that people are trippin.. Ok. You might be able to say "I know he
has an ego, I tryed to talk to him" Yea well, you need to realize.. When
you go up to someone to talk to them "JUST" to see if they have an ego or
whatever. You yourself actually give off a distrustful vibe...a vibe that
makes the other person feel like he is being interagated or something.  So
if you just go up to someone to "JUDGE" them, don't expect a bunch of
positive responce back.

Like. The doods probably hell of cool and more REAL then most people. I
don't know, haven't met him. Thats MY problem by the way. ... And the guy
might even unintentionally be distant with people just wanting to be his
friend. Because well, when you have so many people getting the wrong
impression of you, you become alittle distant like that.

But I bet he is not stuck-up or anything. Everyone just likes to assume
stuff in the scene still.


Yanno.

Navy Cancels Cyberfest Dance Party
     =

     Catherine Bowman, Natasha Stovall, Chronicle Staff Writers
     =

          The Navy has pulled the plug on Cyberfest '97, an =

          all-night rave that was scheduled for this weekend at =

          the former Alameda Naval Air Station.
     =

          The event had been approved by the city of Alameda =

          Planning Commission, but on Tuesday the Navy said no.
     =

          ``The party is canceled,'' said Navy spokesman Jeff =

          Young. ``It's not an event the Navy wanted, and it was =

          not an event that many of the city officials wanted.''
     =

          The base, which closed in April, is being converted to =

          civilian use. Until it is completely out of the Navy's =

          hands, -- Young said, the Navy and the city must agree =

          on any events held there.
     =

          ``This is completely ridiculous, completely =

          unconscionable,'' Cyberfest producer Sason Parry said =

          yesterday from the naval base, where he said the event =

          was ``40 percent'' set up.
     =

          He would not give an exact figure but estimated that =

          Cyberfest would have sold out, which would have resulted =

          in an audience of 20,000 for the more than 40 disc =

          jockeys and musicians -- including electronic dance =

          superstars Aphex Twin and the Sneaker Pimps -- who were =

          scheduled to appear. The show, which Parry dubbed a =

          ``dance festival,'' was to run from 7 p.m. Saturday to 8 =

          a.m. Sunday and feature food, light shows and five dance =

          floors.
     =

          Parry said he had had a permit for Cyberfest '97 from =

          the Planning Commission since August 11, when he =

          attended a commission hearing at Alameda City Hall. In =

          addition, he said, he went before the commissioners =

          again on September 15 and they again gave their =

          blessing. According to Parry, the permit he holds =

          extends from last Saturday to October 4. The party was =

          to be held on a 30-acre site on the west end of the =

          base, and tickets were selling for $25. Although the =

          event has been promoted since the beginning of August, =

          Navy spokesman Young insisted that the Navy could not =

          have acted any sooner than it did to reject the =

          application.
     =

          He said city officials had notified the promoter Tuesday =

          that the event was off, although portable toilets and =

          telephone lines were still being set up yesterday =

          afternoon.
     =

          ``We can't deny a permit until we have it physically in =

          front of us,'' Young said. ``Everybody was surprised it =

          got this far -- virtually no one expected this to be =

          approved by the city.''
     =

          Alameda Mayor Ralph Appezzato said he understood the =

          Navy's decision. Had the Navy not acted, he probably =

          would have called a special meeting of the City Council =

          to review the Planning Commission's decision.
     =

          Young said the rave was not an appropriate use for the =

          site, noting that people near the old base have made it =

          clear that they do not want a lot of noise, traffic or =

          all-night activities there.
     =

          ``The primary reason was the noise,'' Young said. ``The =

          other is fears of vandalism or possible injury. Military =

          bases are essentially an industrial area -- no matter =

          how good the security is, it can't always prevent =

          someone from wandering off into an area where they could =

          conceivably be injured.'' Young said the Navy, the city =

          and Bay Area leaders received more than 200 angry calls =

          after the Navy allowed the Army to conduct late- night =

          training exercises at the base a few weeks ago. The =

          soldiers were practicing hostage rescues until 11:30 =

          p.m. and made plenty of noise in the process.
     =

          Parry, who has been producing musical events for 12 =

          years, said that he believed he had the support of the =

          city and that he never had any indication that the Navy =

          could revoke his permits. ``For them to say, at the 11th =

          hour, that the event cannot go on is just wrong. There's =

          got to be some decency here. It's discrimination against =

          a youth culture that bureaucrats don't understand.''
     =

          Parry said his company, Coolworld, stands to lose upward =

          of $300,000 if Cyberfest '97 is canceled.
     =

          He is looking into alternate venues but conceded that =

          ``the possibility is not very good.'' If the event is =

          canceled altogether, Parry said he believes that tickets =

          can be returned at their point of purchase.
     =

          The Coolworld information line is (415) 979-4543. Sason =

          said last night that he would update the tape to reflect =

          the latest information.

I too have mixed Free to Be... You and Me... into several of

Okay, so I still love listening to it. I even have it on

I'm glad other people remember that record, too  =)

My partners and I are kicking off a new Friday night party in SF and we
can't think of a name. Everything we've come up with is too serious.  We
need something on the happier-lighter-funny side ("Pablo's Sugar Shack)
rather than a one word serious name like NATION or something. Any ideas
that you have would be greatly appreciated.

Seriously Stumped,

Yes you're right, they are VERY organized, on the corporate level, ... but
they are forced to be somewhat neutral and non biased on the listener level,
due to the fact that they are REGULATED by the FCC, and other regulatory
agencies.   Therefore their actions hold HIGH accountability.  They are not
the problem, they are not even entertainment... just glamorous marketing and
advertising medium, as all commercial radio is.  There is a bigger picture
going on here that is probably very hard for you and many others to grasp
because it is way our of many peoples scope of reason....

Well, here again you are missing it entirely... CWP expected to loosing some
money at this event.... Even from the start, this event would have broken even
AT BEST.  You see, LIFE is about the CHALLENGE of doing something new that
no-one has done before, or else life is not worth living..... Money is just a
tool, that does not immortalize you as well as your achievements in life.
This event is a milestone, and not a cash cow....   It's real easy to jump to
conclusions, especially when you don't understand the big picture...   Lets se
how this one plays out before we prematurely judge something before it has
happened.

> Anyone want to take bets on how many people get hauled away in ambulances

This is a real sad thing to say... relishing on peoples misfortune is a
cynical attitude toward life....  Lets HOPE that people party responsibly,
weather its at a rave, a concert, or in their own home...

Keep it Real

Nah, dood.   Check out some of the old XLR8R letters-to-the-editor from 
a year or so ago..  there was a series of letters from fellow DJ's who 
took a whole bunch of crap from the boy.  Doing stuff like not getting 
off the decks to let the next guy on because he didn't "feel like 
it"...throwing hissy fits about get VIP treatments, etc.

Normally I might pass stuff off as hearsay, but there were a LOT of DJ's 
talking about personal experiences with him. Of course, that was a year 
or 2 ago when he was in his crack heyday...I have heard that he's 
mellowed out.  But he defnitely admits (by magazine interviews and album 
titles) that he's on an ego trip.  it's kind of cool (I guess) that he 
admits it, and doesn't appear ashamed by it.  I reckon a lot of people 
get turned on by that reckless, arrogant presence.  Kind of like Jim 
Morrison...larger than life, sexy, cocky, and proud of it.

alrighty.

Unfortunately, in this world, there is always someone bigger, always beyond the
normal scope of thought there is something else going on... well this situation
is no different....

Conspiracies exist.  And there is a big conspiracy being played out here.   I
would love to someday write a book about this industry and all the MAJOR players

leave it at that...  Entertainment is a world power factor....  And there are

what the independent promoters are producing... weather its concerts, music,
shows, dances, raves, movies, plays, videos, or anything that could cut into the
"OVERALL long-term projected profit margin..."   The world is not a simple
place... keep it in mind...

Yeah, yeah, yeah...  green machines are the bomb.  Mine is still in my Mom's

Wouldn't it be cool to have a party where we brought all those old toys out to
play on?  I love those balloon kinda things that you sit on and bounce around.

Did someone fail to realize something???...

consciousness you realize this and accept it.. yet my spirit is mearly
using this physical (flesh) as a means to interact with other spirits on
this physical plane....  it's funny how people can think we're not
animals.... we ARE animals. And that's not a bad thing. For Christ's sake
my cat UNIX cries when I don't share my fish with him (or other food for 
that matter) .. we eat the same kinda food, drink the same liquid, etc..
have the same habits.... we're animals! Some of us are just more civilized

Oh my Good God Damn.


First question.  Can anyone confirm or deny the allegations that last
night (the newly unstoppable JUSTICE LEAGUE on Divisadero and Hayes in SF)
was OPTICAL's first US performance?

Now...

Holy Mary.  That was some pretty incredible everything.  I was pleased to
finally see Grooverider a short while ago.  I was absolutely astoudned by
the things that Optical is doing.

I don't know if I'm out of the loop, but when I heard him throw down his
remix of To Shape the Future... I knew while jungle reigned righteousness.

How can I go over his set, when hardly any of the tracks had names yet?
Like I was saying last night, when someone writes a story about jungle
culture, there better be some DUBPLATE JACKERS in it.  They would have hit
Fort Know last night.  End of line.

I simply do not know what to think about the future of jungle, besides the
fact that no matter what people say, no matter if he makes tech
now...Optical will be smiling.  That dude is IN THE NO.

And finally, I have found a crew that with time and perseverence will
represent the Bay Area when the tin-pan sound make a comeback.  Enormous
and unfadeable props and thanks and respect to Billy Culture and SEN-C
MEDIA.  After so long, I've finally found you.  Mateo rock out, yall
Aragon badmen.  415!

PAX,
DUH,
MAX

PS:  If you have the chance, see Optical when he comes through.  by any
means necessary.  I really had a divine time last night.  Divine man in
the booth.  Divine gente in the floor.

When you say "neutral... on the listener level", are you talking about 
their programming? 

Because, while the FCC does regulate programming that 
may be considered indecent or obscene, or (theoretically) prohibits 
"calls to action" (for example, it's illegal for an on-air personality to 
say, "drink some miller, get a baseball bat, and take your  
modern-rock-attitude down to city hall"), the FCC is certainly not 
responsible for the neutrality (i.e., mediocrity) of live 105's programming.

The only people responsible for that are live 105's programming people, 
who have decided that the best (i.e., most profitable) way to run their 
radio station is to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

-radon

ps. what does live 105's neutrality or the fact that "their actions hold 
HIGH accountability" have to do with your argument about them not being a 
part of the organized entertainment industry? i don't mean to sound 
pedantic, but your post is confusing.

pps. if you get the time, I'd be interested to hear about the "bigger 
picture" going on.

What is the big deal over cyberfest anyway???
It's just another festival/massivly massive. The overall vibe will be 
bad, yet the good vibe will take tons of effort to find. I personally 
don't like thugs picking on me. No thanks! I will wait for the Santa

yes we are the consumers.  Yes, even if some customers complain, most of
the stores can keep thier fucked-up business.  Yes we live in capitalism.
It's true that most of customers voice won't change anything, especially
this crazy system.  

But I do not want to accept this system without complaining.  I know it's
pretty silly, but I can't stand some sotre owners taking shit for granted.
It's like saying, "I know my vote won't change anything, so I won't vote."
As long as you are a customer, you have a right to complain, at least try
to make it better.

meg,

yeas, you can get tix at door.  $10, I think...at least that's what the
info line says.

I'm 6' skinny with supershort brownhair and a goatee/sides and
earrings. I'll be wearing my fave green jacket & black jeans, and I'll be
holding a piece of paper with my name on it:"jimg/skoop".  I'm in a silly
mood and it's the easiest thing to do. :) You peeps better come up and say
hi to me, or else...

My friend erik is coming with me...he's got a long blonde ponytail.

The customer absolutely has the right to complain. And the store owner
absolutely has the right to say "bite me, go somewhere else." 

Bitch all you want, it doesn't make you any more right or wrong. From what
I saw in this case, the person was bitching because they didn't bother to
shop around, and had a misconception on the rarity of a piece of vinyl.
Neither of which is the record stores fault.

Two Keoki memories...

During a really crappy set at 1015 Folsom (bad mixing, bad music choices in
my opinion, no groove) ... some silly clubster bumped into the turntables,
and his response was to *actually stop the music* to glare at the
interloper, before starting the music again...

then (the same weekend i believe) he played a much better set at sunset,
with the added treat that he was in his socks because, if i recall
correctly, his platform shoes were impractical on the bumpy dirt surface.
either that, or he had blisters .... at least he was more real..

i have a friend who thinks keoki is the master ... and appreciates that he
is willing to be a drama queen no matter what people think...  however my
friend is also a drama queen, so ... peas in a pod, i guess!

It looks to be the flip and flop of it, this small VS thang.

ARC003 soming for a cash-drop in a biggish spot with definitely more
spaced out and organic sounds.

DRUNKYN MASTYRZ, seemingly combing three of my superfaavorite things in
the entire world: the Drunken Monkey style of kung-fu brought to us in
part but Jackie Chan's 1978 classic.  (big up all the Drunken Gods,
bringing mankind the steeelo); hip hop affection and cut-up dissection;
roughneck screwface jungle beats.  Oh and #4, it's free.

Any opinions?  Any information?  What's up selvaticas?

Ok, ok...
 What about (6th grade for me) when Break Dancing was becoming popular.
Seemed like everybody in the whole elementary school that Christmas got a
BOOM-BOX.. It's like.. We all brought our boom-boxes to school thinking we
were cool.. The speakers came off of my boom-box. And the tape recorder
slided out making it a walkman.. Thoughs were the days.
 I remember back then. All I did was play with my friends. We all would go
to my house and watch my dads band practice. I got to experience first hand
at a young age, the negative effects drugs can have on a band.
 Can you believe it? I had the coolest jacket in the whole school six grade
year.. Yep.. I had a real leather red Michael Jackson jacket! We had cutout
pictures of Michael Jackson pasted up on every wall in our classroom. But
me and my friends were slightly cooler then the rest of the school, because
we also listened to Prince and hung out with 7th graders.
 It wasn't that long after, they finished building the New Park Mall in
Newark.

 My friends and I (Joel & Juan) choreographed a killer break dancing show
we put on the last day of school. PHAT. Better than thoughs doods dressed
in white at the ravEs.. Oh..   =]:

 But.. Who else on the list can say they cut class in preschool. Yep.. Me,
my brother and three other friends cut class at noon. Because we did NOT
want to take our nap! I guess you can say music has always been a part of
my life. In preschool we all dressed up, painted our faces to look like the
band KISS, and put on a lip syncing concert.

 Anyways. Just some memory sparks.
 Have good weekend people. Yes.


Jeff

 Well, as the guy who started this thread, I must say that as the guy who
started this thread, I really haven't heard all that much from him, and
what little I've heard sounded OK to me. One track on the "Hard Hop & Tripno"
#1 cd.

 What I REALLY want to know ( being from Hawaii ) is, is his name 
really Keoki ? If not, why did he choose a Hawaiian name to DJ by ?
Or does another culture have the name Keoki too?

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

Favorite Keoki rumor: He was at a Golden Gate Park daytime rave once. An
SFRaver was approached by him with this greeting:

"Hello! I'm Keoki! I'm gay!"

Well, the fact of the matter is that there are people who really enjoy
massives.  They have a great time and they like the mass amount of people
and the energy that generates.  Along with the massive sound you get at big
events.  You see some folks get off on the fact that there are so many
people in one place under one roof.  

It took someone dear to me to learn this aspect of the massives.  I myself
don't go to many, but I do at times.

All I know is that its not for everyone, and none of us have the right to
put anyone down for choosing to go to a massive.  Some things are better
left unsaid, and I feel we all need to stop bagging on those who choose to
go to massives.  No ones better than the other if they choose to go to one
or not.  We're all equal.

Who are we to say that the vibe will be bad.  Are we actually trying to
ruin the good time they might have, all because we are to head strong about
massives that you don't want others to experience it.  People need to find
out for them selves if they enjoy them or not.  Lets leave it to the
individual.

Just my thoughts.  Everyone have a good weekend.

Bu_bye!

Siphon

Your right. ..
But man. I hear/hear about, so many people saying things about me that's not
true. I guess it's things like this that make it hard for me to beleive even the
most serious of hear say at times.

You know?
But I don't really know...
 I remember back when I used to play guitar for a thrash band. We had the
pleasure of playing a gig with a "glamour" band.. And thoughs people.. I go up to
the guitar player to introduce myself before the show. I hold out my hand and say
"what up" or something. The dood just says something like "don't even try to take
one of my guitar picks. if you only brought one with you thats your problem. I
don't let people borrow my picks" And the guy had lipstick on..
 Now that I think about this guy. Maybe Keoki is really stuck-up or something.
They do exist..
 I remember I went to go check this Keoki dood out at Nikita. A couple of people
came up to me and told me Keoki was "wacked".. And I was like thinking. Ok.. I
don't like any of his CD's either.. I just hang out here. Jeez..

 Gotta jet ski. I am suppost to be working!

Jeff
P.S. Saving the best for when I get home.  =]:...

Wrinkles.  Mortgage payments.  Needing a break after walking 3 flights 
of stairs.  Talking to your kids about your raver days.  Worrying about 
your libido/menopause/getting it up. Having more of a history than 
childhood and adolescence.  Not being able to wear anything from 
Goodwill and looking cute in it.  Eating healthy because you have to or 
else you'll die.  Worrying about retirement.  

..that's old

yes that's his real name; he's from hawaii.


> "Hello! I'm Keoki! I'm gay!"


he tells a pretty colorful story in Mixmag, about this teenage boy he
was boning in some bathroom at a party, later on the kid was sending him 
sexy email
and the kid's father found out about it; and sent Keoki a message ("My 
son will no  longer
be sending such filthy and unChristian messages...)

Keoki replied :  Shit, put him back on, I want to fuck him again, I 
don't even remember the last time!

or something like that.

Okay, so I'm horribly late!  Naughty me...
But my gratitude is still genuine.  Thank you so much to the turntable overlords...DJ
Shimmer, DJ Pillow and DJ Thorfio.  Without your talents I couldn't have irritated
the neighbors.  It was great to see some new faces, but I know that not everyone
who called came.  Everyone fit comfortably in my apartment.  I don't want to be so
lucky next time.  A big thank you to the gang who swung by on their way to the party.
 I was sorry you couldn't stay but it meant a lot that you came by. Everyone was
fantastic!!  I hope you have lots of good memories and lots of new jewelry.  Special
thanks to Hai and Mike who fed everyone, I had enough left over to get me through
half this week.  
See you all next time!!

Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidential.

Man, I loved the Dukes of Hazzard.  Did you catch the reunion show from a
few months back?  Pretty awful.

Anyways, daisy did NOT have a camaro..it was a dodge challenger.  And then
she got that awful jeep.  ugh.

yeah, I admit it, I was young enough at the time that I only watched it
for the automotive mayhem...everything else was lost on me.

 Ok, ok...
 What about (6th grade for me) when Break Dancing was becoming popular.
 Seemed like everybody in the whole elementary school that Christmas got a 
 BOOM-BOX.. It's like.. We all brought our boom-boxes to school thinking we were 
 cool.. The speakers came off of my boom-box. And the tape recorder slided out 
 making it a walkman.. Thoughs were the days.
 I remember back then. All I did was play with my friends. We all would go
to my house and watch my dads band practice. I got to experience first hand 
at a young age, the negative effects drugs can have on a band.
 Can you believe it? I had the coolest jacket in the whole school six grade
year.. Yep.. I had a real leather red Michael Jackson jacket! We had cutout 
pictures of Michael Jackson pasted up on every wall in our classroom. But 
me and my friends were slightly cooler then the rest of the school, because 
we also listened to Prince and hung out with 7th graders.
 It wasn't that long after, they finished building the New Park Mall in
Newark.
     
 My friends and I (Joel & Juan) choreographed a killer break dancing show
we put on the last day of school. PHAT. Better than thoughs doods dressed 
in white at the ravEs.. Oh..   =]:
     
 But.. Who else on the list can say they cut class in preschool. Yep.. Me,
my brother and three other friends cut class at noon. Because we did NOT 
want to take our nap! I guess you can say music has always been a part of 
my life. In preschool we all dressed up, painted our faces to look like the 
band KISS, and put on a lip syncing concert.
     
 Anyways. Just some memory sparks.
 Have good weekend people. Yes.

I recall walking into one of my dads friends house and seeing a calendar
featuring Daisy Duke, with out her daisy dukes on...or anything else.  Boy

space lift-offs or whatever they were) a film warning us about the
dangers of drugs - lots of long haired hippie-lookin ppl, all smokin'
a whole lot of dope - funny - didn't look very dangerous to me
then.... perhaps it had the wrong effect on me... :P  i always *was*

Here! Here!

The rave ecosystem is at always work, regulating itself.

My hat is off to the US Navy for making a critical decision of positive
impact for our community at the 11th hour to cancel this exploitive event.

Write your congressman, write your senator. Thank them for their and the
Navy's wisdom. Write the Alameda city council and thank them too!

Then go to an underground. It's good for you(tm).

As of 4pm this afternoon cyberfest 3 will not be happening at the
alameda naval air station....  Please do not go that way, and please
tell your friend not to go out there.    This is a sad day for the dance
movement and the overall independent dance community.   There may still
be a smaller cyberfest 3 event at another venue, it is being worked out
at this moment.   For aditional information, call the CWP info lines...

Keep it real

last time i saw a show at the place where ARC003 is, it was standing
room only, filled with all these 2-/30somethings who had probably
never been to a rave, which is fine, exept no-one was dancing, they
were just standing there looking at the dj's, who were good, but not
worth all that money to WATCH.  i mean it was too damn crowded to
dance even if you felt like having everyone stare at you.  now i'd
really like to see this arcthing, cause i really like indian classical
and bhangra and hindi films an shit (that is the arc003 show isn't it?
future sound of india bedouin rising whatever...) but not if if it's
gonna be packed to the gills with a bunch of immobles...

watching people walk on the moon and dreaming about a future
of space travel, colonies on mars and robots that did all of our
work so we would have all day to explore the stars or whatever.
I guess the future isnt what it used to be.

ps...im back from a week in shasta and am finished with my 
summer travels so now i can get focused on the Art pARTy.
If all goes as planned the first one will be in Nov. and 
a month long multimedia art show in shasta next summer.
Watch for the foolish fish at a flyer table near you soon.


btw  feelin g old  =  feelin gold...its all relative.

O.k, o.k.  Yeah, so he may have fucking huge ass ego.  But I still have
to give Keoki props.  If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have the love
today that I have for techno.  I guess you can say I wouldn't have any
aspiration for being a DJ.  Keoki was the first DJ I ever listened to
before I went to my first rave and I have to say that his record "All
Mixed Up" is still the fucking bomb.  I just have to give credit where
credit is due.  Doesn't mean that he has no faults.  N E Ways, back to
studyin'.

Hey kids!

It's with great pride and a lot of happiness that I announce to you that 
as of about 11:27 this evening I am oficially a Double Uncle!  That's 
right, my step-sister has gone and done it again and in an interesting 
turn of events, she had my new neice on the same day that she had my 
first neice five years ago!  So they have the same birthday, just five 
years apart.  !!!

Amazing stuff, this whole life thing I tell ya!

Anyway, I'm pretty happy :)

<randomness>

speaking of that Jungle and Kung-Fu flick nexus,

what's the name of that Jungle track that has the english dub of 
some kung-fu movie where the guy says "my style is the best"

and for that matter, what's the name of the movie where this comes from.

PS: curiously enough, if any of you remember the Kevin Mitnick internet
hacker case from a few years back, Mitnick left a message on
whatsisface's the anti-hacker guy (who worked at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center) answering machine boasting about his hacking
style in a mock english accent saying the same "my style is the best"
line (tho he was talking about his hacking prowess, not his kung fu
prowess). Extra points for anybody that can point me to the URL of
Mitnick's phone threats that were on the internet a while back).

PPS: I'd have to agree w/ Max that the Jackie Chan Drunken Master
series of Kung Fu movies are probably the best, most interestingly
choreographed, and funniest kung-fu movies ever made. i accidentally
walked into the wrong move at the mill-valley film fest a few years
ago and found myself discovering/watching/laughing at one of the
Drunken Master films (v2, or v3??) even though I had originally 
planned to watch some serious art-wank flick instead.

I was in Urban Outfitters Just a couple weeks ago and I saw
this new-fangled modern version of the "dick and jane " story....
it kind of had hightlights from the book along with modern-day 
comparisons to kinda show how times have changed, etc.  It was
way cool -- had all the original story words and pictures and 
everything!

"Independent" means the freedom to throw any kind of event you want.  CWP
may be huge but I don't know that they are connected to anything TOO
coporate.  (Mind you, I don't have extensive knowledge of them.  Please
correct me if I am wrong.)  The dance community should have the option of
attending a massive if they so desire.  Personally, I prefer smaller, more
underground parties/clubs but I respect that others may have different
preferences.  I agree with Vlad that it is sad that this party was
cancelled.  I had no plans of going but the manner in which it was
cnacelled seems shady and underhanded.  It is only a matter of time before
that underhandedness reaches into the underground, as well.

Exactly, I think it was pretty cool of Vlad to let everyone know,
since there will be interested parties. I think its damn cool that
we even have the option. My friends parties in Vancouver get
busted every time permits or not (some Anti-Rave ordinance). We should
always back up our freedom to assemble.

	Does anyone know if any of the people who were supposed to be at Cyberfest
are going to be anywhere in SF tonight?  The reason I ask is the CoolWorlds
info line said they are trying to find venues for the various people.
Anyone have any info on this?

I have to agree about Sat Lifeforce. A lot of people I went with left early
or were complaining - I couldn't figure out why - the music went off and most
people there were friendly and seemed to be having a great time. The
promoters obviously had their heart in the right place. You could tell there
was a lot of effort put in - it was the best I'd seen that cavernous
werehouse ever look. Too bad more people weren't there to enjoy it. But I
sure had a blast with plenty of room to dance and plenty of air to breath. In
fact we closed out the 2nd room till 8AM!!

...."unless you're into the dark techno stuff you'll probably feel the same
way"....

I LOVE the dark techno stuff and the only jungle I like is dark and I STILL
feel the same way. You know the main room is actuallyeven BIGGER - they had
the stage area set up about 2/3 of the way back - there was still another
large area behind the stage that wasn't used (or maybe just used as
backstage). Regardless, I'll be well impressed if anyone can ever create a
vibe there - it's seems an impossible task.

Hi:

The message (for 415...) for Cyberfest 97 said they were trying to find
other shows for the artists to work at.

Are there any other raves going tonight?  Cyberfest was the only one.

That is such a good point. I have to make a conscious effort (and need to
remember that I need to make that effort) not to ever use qualitative words
such as "good", "bad", "it sucked", "it was amazing" etc etc. If I do find
myself letting one slip (which is almost impossible not to) I rephrase by
adding first, "for me....." or "for my taste, others might disagree...." 
Yeah, this might seem obvious or rhetorical, but you don't realize how much
you could insult someone or hurt their feelings if they happen to love the
thing you just said was crap. They might not give a sht about your opinion
anyway, but it still is the considerate thing to realize, when it comes down
to it, that is all it is...your <opinion>.
Still frankly I can't fathom how someone can sit and listen/dance to certain
music, while I honestly don't believe they aren't moved by kick-ass techno
(of the detroit and acid variety). I think they are all in denial. But
diversity is what makes horse races (or some expression like that).
It all comes down to respect. If you want it, you've got to give it.

Hmmm. Does Live 105, which is owned by CBS count? That seems pretty
corporate. The connection that I see that makes them having more than an
advertiser/customer relationship was a little paradoy of "In the Navy"
that was played on the station a couple of days ago in which the
cancellation of Cyberfest was the subject. Seems odd to me that somebody
with a simple advertiser relationship to a client would go so far as to
produce such a thing. But that is admittedly purely conjecture on my part.
But nonetheless I still find it suspect.

I'm not. Then again I have hear tales of near riots at the front gates at
past events, sketchy experiences with other attendees, as well as seen the
article in the paper last year about all the people(15 or so if memory
serves) found wandering the streets after their New Years party in a
drug-filled stupor. Wow, sounds like some place I want to go. Think of it
this way: perhaps by the cancellation of the event, some lives were
saved, literally.

Check out the front page of the Oakland Tribune. The people that are
culpable in this is the City of Oakland who didn't tell the promoter that 
he needed permission from the Navy as well as the city for use of the
site.

The reason why the underground is underground is because it bypasses a lot
of the bullshit. And for the most part, people will try to look out
for each other.

Yeah. If anyone is planning to go, I'm gonna check my email before I get
outta here ('bout 12:30 a.m.), so please leave a msg. of what you will
be wearing or something to identify yourself with. I'm going by myself
(due to the wierd hours of this rescheduled event) and it would really
suck doing the loner thang. (I'll still get my groove on, though....)

call me @ home if you'd like to arrange hooking up
707.455.7371 - tonight only! :)

Welp,

It's 9:38 in the morn and I just got home. Still a little wired from the
whole night, so I thought I'd post a review...

Walked into Sound Factory about 2:30 a.m. to a packed house. Not having
been to a "proper" club in ages (besides 1015 for spundae's a few weeks
ago) I have to say that I was impressed. Tons of people dancing in the
main room and the DJ was spinning some high energy house. I think the
sound at Sound factory is the best I've heard in a club. Deep bass,
perfect midrange, crisp highs, w/o any distortion. It makes the music
100% better.
Anyway:

1) Doc Martin or Aphex Twin never showed.
2) The guy from Leftfield was there. DJ'd starting around 3:30 a.m. Very
sparse set, with few hooks to draw me in. Every now and then he would
drop some very tasty basslines and some vocal treats, but for the most
part, I liked the Sound Factory DJ's better that were on before him.
3) Italy's #1 DJ was there. His set got me going again. played great
Dance music 'cuz there were fat samples and groovy basslines.
4) SuperSonic played live. Imagine Crystal Method, but harder breakbeats
with nothing but old skool hip hop samples ( a la Run DMC, KRS-ONE, etc.
and a taste of Rodney O and Joe Cooley.) I'd give them a thumbs up.
5) Danced until 7:30 w/ this cool person named Judy. I met her 'cuz I
thought she might have been an SFRaver. I was wrong, oh well.

Until we meet,

rob.

Was up ya'll this is Seth.  I really wanted to thank everyone for coming 
out last night.  The music last night majorly went off. All of the djs 
spun spectacular soul shakin sets. Micron Macadio Trace Jelo my two main 
men James Christopher and Logik (aka Ornette) and every one else really 
went all out.

I think the majority of the had a really really good time.  The outdoor 
space was beautfull.  Tons of stars to watch.  I'd like to thank Amber 
for the permission to use this amazing site.  The vibe was terrific and 
everyone contributed to that.

Im sad to say that we did have a few problems.  We had some trouble with 
some traffic because somehow are party got posted on the hotline so a 
space ment for 200 people had to accomdate close to 400 at the peak of 
the evening.  It was a little dusty & dirty but we lived. 

Unfortunatly at the close of the evening we had a car accident so if we 
could all wish the best of luck to those involved. Luckily no one was 
injured to badly.  

I really want to thank everyone that volunteered there help when things 
were getting rough. you know who you are. Hugsnkisses to ya.
I really hope that everyone who came out had a good time and enjoy the 
music and the people. see ya soon

being non-judgemental is just soemthing to think about, maybe not to
perfectly live it al the time, cause even in some of the books i've read,
they say it's important to express feelings.  and if someone pisses you
off, let them know!  and if someone's music sucks, throw up on them!!!

oooh.  i have a feeling this keoki guy would have a lot of vomit on him the
way everyone's talking about this cd.  in fact, i was feeling a bit queasy
myself (and im not even a cancer) when it was being gruefully explained to
me.

yes, just like little 3 year old cassandra gave me a nickel this mornign,
and i felt compelled to give her a quarter.  see, whatever you give, you
get 5 times back!  ;]

I don't listen to the radio, therefore had no idea of the connection
between the two.  I stand corrected.

Can an event be held responsible for the actions of it's attendees?  I'm
torn on this issue, myself.  I beleive each individual is responsible for
his/her own actions.  But on the other hand, should an organization which
has repeated problems at its events continue to put on those events?  I am
not close enough to the situation on either side of the arguement to draw a
sound conclusion.
But I do see your point.

I found out about the cancellation in the SF Chronicle.  It sounded a
little fishy to me.  All parties were not informed of all necessary
details, thus the misunderstanding, leading to the cancellation.  I am not
so naieve as to think what I read in the papaer is the whole truth, but it
just doesn't seem right to me.

But the underground is growing larger and larger, becoming less underground
all the time.  I still believe that the bullshit can potentially leak in.
People try to look out for one another but this is no gaurantee that there
will not be problems.
Just My Opinion,
Megan

all i have to say is, Wow!
and Thank You.
Thanks to all who was involved in making The Abyss happen because it 
was a f**cking bombass party. :-)
me and my friends overcame such osbstacles as getting lost and then 
getting stuck and spinning tires out on the dusty dirt road, but we 
made it and boy am i glad we did.
i saw many of my old friends, old aquaintances, and new ones.  i 
spazzed out during somebody's set (i think it was cloud's) cuz the 
energy level was so intense.  yeah, that was me with the blinking red 
reflector on collar of my shirt.  and yeah, like i said, i met so 
many rad new people...
the weather was perfect too.  i didn't even need to bust out my 
trusty green sweatshirt.  and as if looking at all the beautiful 
people there wasn't enough, i could always lay back and check out the 
stars.  like i said, wow!
-doreen.

 And... not tonight, but on october 3rd,  something/someone called "the

stage :  Q-bert, mix master mike, shortkut, d-styles, and yoga frog... PLUS
 chief x-cel, (blackalicious), j-boogie, bad-rok, the supernatural turntable
artists, doze, and spyda monkey as dj's

--=-=-=-=snip-=-=-

  I'd highly recommend this!!  Although not for everybody, if you like watching
the DJ, watch these guys decks go up in smoke. :)

  I'd suggest checking out this sight for more info.  It has some .wav samples
samples, but most importantly, it has a Quick Time video of Q-Bert in action
so you can get a little idea of what's up for the evening.

Boeeey, you know I was pumped when I heard that Cyberfest was
relocated to the Sound Factory.  They said not to show up until 3am,
but you you know I had to get down there early to get loaded and scope
out the freshies.

So once I had a beer in each fist, I started freakin my way across 
the floor toward the girlz dancing in the cages.    I took off 
my shirt and started with the ole shirtless, drawers-showing boomerang
freak; flexing my pecs and thrusting the old rocketship.   Eventually, 
this hotty caught my eye, so I strolled on over to where she was 
dancing atop the speaker stacks and said, 

"Hey, Baby, ain't your name 'Damn'?  Cause that's the first thing I 
thought when I seen you!"

Well, naturally she was all charmed by my wit amd not to mention my 
smooth dance moves,   so all it took was a couple more drinks to 
convince her to hit the road and see if we could make some music 
of our own.

Only problem was, once we got back to her crib, there was some chump
sleeping in the sack!   

"What's this?" says I.  "Don't expect me to be doing any menatch
ah-twa or any of that kinky french booty knockin.  I came here for the 
REAL, baby, the 1-on-1, you know what I'm sayin?"

"Aww, don't worry about Bulldawg,"  she said.  "Here, come on, get 
in bed.  See, when  Bulldawg goes out drinking, he passes out stone 
cold.
Now, pull a hair out of his fanny.  It won't even wake him."

I yanked a hair right out of his butt, and sure enough, ole Bulldawg
didn't budge.

So me and the miss commenced to dance the Horizontal Bop like it was 
going out of 
style.

Naturally, she wanted me to go for a second round.  I got a reputation
around here--Boomerang-the stick that won't quit-- so I had no choice 
but
to oblige.

So I yanked another hair out of old Bulldawg, and he didn't move.
I was beginning to fear maybe he'd drunk himself to death,  but
then I got distracted by the lovely lady.

I was ready to collapse when she said she wanted to go for the 3!
"Damn baby, you're gonna kill me!  I got a heart condition, and 
stuff!"

But I had yo please, so I yanked another hair out of the old boy next
to me.  

And then I heard this growling that sounded like a rabid dawg ready
to strike.  Old Bulldawg turned around and looked me in the eye and said

"Look, it's bad enough that you're getting busy with my lady
in my own bed, but do you have to use my ass as a scoreboard?"

Seemed like everybody in the whole elementary school that Christmas got a

Boom-boxes were the definers of the social hierarchy in skool, kinda like the 
social order in a group of orangutan or something; i.e., the bigger the 
boombox, the cooler you were.  You'd be playing your music on your boombox, and 
someone with a bigger one'd come up, and you'd have to turn yours off.  I only 
had a small one, but it had a 3' b&w tv in it, so it was cool.


>>Can you believe it? I had the coolest jacket in the whole school six grade
year.. Yep.. I had a real leather red Michael Jackson jacket! We had cutout
pictures of Michael Jackson pasted up on every wall in our classroom. But<<<


I remember when these came out, they wer like $200 or something.  NO ONE bought 
one, except this one unpopular girl that REALLY wanted to fit in, and it was 
kinda sad cause the kids teased her even more for trying so hard.  Then the 
vinyl knockoffs came out for $30 or so and made it even worse for her.  ;-<



>> My friends and I (Joel & Juan) choreographed a killer break dancing show
we put on the last day of school. PHAT. Better than thoughs doods dressed
in white at the ravEs.. Oh..   =]:<<<


I bought the Breakin' and Beat Street records.  The Breakin' record had a large 
fold-out poster that had instructions for all the popular moves on it.  My 
parents re-did the parquet floors in the kitchen, so they were really smooth 
and slippery. I practeiced the back spin thing for weeks.  Never got good, 
though.  But boy could I pop it and lock it!


Mini-reviews:

Resfest:  pretty cool, took my 12-year old brother.  He fell asleep.  I liked 
the Coldcut films the best.  That guy with the chainsaw was rad!

Psy-Harmonics:  I took the 12-year old to this too, perhaps the youngest raver 
in town last night?  He had a killer outfit, though:  big red bell bottoms, 
matching red vest, matching red jacket.  Glowing rings, glitter, smiley 
medallion.  He can't dance much though.  He's in town visiting for the weekend, 
and he made me take him to a rave.  

The music was good, vibe pretty good (I love the ppl who dress up in dayglo 
psychedelic outfits for psytrance parties!).  REALLY hot and moist in there, 
and a little too crowded, but I'm sure it was better than the massive.  

Peace, 

Nathan

Hello lovely peoples,

Well, the evening started like this...

Mack-audio picks me up and we hit the road for the long trip to Santa Rosa.  It
seems hella long.  The directions are kinda wonky, but after a few trys we find
a lot of ravers in the road.  The parking situation was totally whack when we
got there.  There was this big hill that a coupla cars couldn't get up and like
six cars blocking the road.  Heads were parking right there and walking up!  We
park the car and catch a ride in a truck - RIGHT ANSWER!

So many people!  Yowza!  What a party!  I missed Jelo and Cloud and James
Christian =(.  I really wanted to see Jelo - see, he's a new DJ and I've seen
him spin at house parties before - but this was the big debut.  He rocked the
block from what I heard!

I did get to see my man, Macadio do his thang.  I really liked his set, even
though I know he didn't get to play all the rekkids he wanted to.  After him,
another hometown favorite, Micron.

I wandered around talking to peeps and setting up my tent and didn't pay
attention to who was spinning again until my boys got up again for a really
nice hard in the morning set - Jelo, Macadio and Micron all tag-teaming.  I got
my best dancing of the party in then!  Hella props, doods!

This was a kick ass party.  The Phanthum crew did an amazing job, despite all
the parking trauma.  Good lights, good sound [the XOR boys], good vibe.  Clay
et al. - you guys rock.

On a side note, does anyone know Ian that moved to Santa Rosa two months ago
from San Diego?  I want to get a hold of him.

Lotsa love and hugs,

Beth
Rave Mama

>     Does anyone remember some movies that teachers would make you watch in 
>     Elementary school???

Free to be You and Me -- this shaped my foundations for love, family, 
gender roles (I was, what, 5 at the time, and nothing since has had as 
much of an impact on me)....Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas as babies in the 
delivery room trying to figure out which one's the boy and which one's 
the girl....And my theme song when I was 5 was William and his doll:

"a doll, a doll, william wants a doll..." ... "i'd give my bat and ball 
and glove, to have a doll that i could love...."  

oh and there was the one about crying..."it's alright to cry...crying 
something something out of you...it's alright to cry...it just might make 
you feel better!" 

This wasn't in school, but Sid & Marty Krofft shows had the same amount 
of impact on me....Cool to see those are back on the air again....I loved 
those shows, just like Land of the Lost, that take you to another world...

At school on Friday afternoons we used to have movie day, and it was 
usual some Disney thing -- Herbie the Lovebug, 20,000 leagues under the 
sea, etc...But the ones that had a big impact on me were Escape from 
Witch Mountain, The Black Hole, and The Cat from Outer Space, or whatever 
it was called....When I was that age (5, 6, 7, 8), all I cared about in 
terms of the media wre anything that showed me things that I thought were 
all part of "The Force" from Star Wars -- ESP, telekenesis, outer space, 
animals and plants communicating, etc...And I used to think anything that 
*showed*, like, energy or looked all energy-like was extra cool....Secret 
of Nimh...Dark Crystal...Xanadu, Logan's Run, The Wiz....

Man, looking back, I was just doomed to do hallucinogens....I don't think 
I really had a choice...

And on the breakdancing thing, man, we had one guy at my school when I 
was in 3rd grade who could do headspins -- you're typical upper-middle 
class kids in the suburbs trying to breakdance on cardboard at recess -- 
so every recess he was this big hero, but then back in class or at lunch 
he was just nobody, but his 15 minutes of fame came at recess when we'd 
all sit around the Kivas (these cement bleacher half-circle things), 
someone would always put on that Breakin' (or maybe it was Breakin 2, 
Electric Bugaloo) soundtrack and he would do his thing....

We had 2 Kivas at school, and towards the end of the breakdance phenom 
there were 2 different crews, 1 for each Kiva, forming -- I can remember 
one day when a battle led to a fight, and somebody kicked the Martinez' 
kid's ghettoblaster across the Kiva and it smashed. That was the end of 
breakdancing at my elementary school.

Yes.. with a kerberized connection to MIT, and a filter-capable mail
client, I can finally manage to process hundreds of emails a day without
drowning in spam.  I missed you all, though none of you might remember my
short stay on the list.  I'm glad to be back; it'll be great to be back

Lovee dovees to all!
Last night wasn't going to be a normle night for me...I had nothing to 
do so I decided to do absolutly nothing with Sir Joel at my coffee shop. 
Eck...Aura's ride flaked (for lack of better terms, sorry Andy) Aura and 
friends decided that they would be generous and give me gas money if I 
were to drive them...I wasn't looking forward to the drive (especially 
the day after I got my car out of the clutch shop in Monterey) After a 
few days of driving, we finally made it to a dirt road that was totally 
blocked with cars, people, and a few more cars.  we started hiking, 
doing the "trust walk" thing and then we got a ride the rest of the way 
up (thanks Nick!) One car stuck, and a second about to flip...the vibes 
were sooo intense that it pushed these cars over the EDGE, well that's 
what I think caused all the rucus ;) People were dancing like mad, dust 
everywhere lights, awesome, people happy as ever.  I was very thankful I 
went.
   Macadio was the first to hear, and as always...the  BoMb. I was 
dancing like crazy bumpin into everybody. Sorry.  :)   It was amazing, I 
met so many new peoples that uh, uh uhhhh well, I was very glad to meet 
all of you.
   This was my first north of SF party with all of the Fathom 
guys...Props to Ornette, Nick, Clay, Seth, David, Jay and who ever I 
forgot you guys gave us a great time! It is great to see a big group of 
good, close friends be able to work together like you guys did. 
   One thing in particular that I thought was amusing were the kamacazi 
sp? moths and other bug paraphanallia that would keep on running into 
our foreheads while we were dancing , talking, or peeing,  they never 
failed.  Great added touch guys!  :) they look really cool in the black 
lights too....I thought it was fun....  . ... .. bzzzzz 
  In the morning, our bodies were tired, a friend and I bonded even more 
than before (thanks Troll, I love you) and I neeeded water.  
Leaving we decided to stop the car  and observe the accident, well we 
didn't really have any choice, thanks Macadio ;)  But I do sincerely 
hope that everyone  eventually got home safely and not too shakin up.
   Was it me or was it the weather or something?, uh, it was hotter in 
S.F. than I really would have liked it to be...ick... 
   (holding the mirror of ravers)I see Lisa,Neeta.Joel,Steve,chad, 
Aura,Kyle,you, you , oh, and you thanks for joining our crazed world of 
fun...back to fingerpaints and paste for me...Doh!
Take care all  of you lovely, great, hAppennin , groovy young lads and 
ladeees, we love you
AAarrgh...damn moths,

Would that dj be Anabolic Frolic?  Of "Happy 2B Hardcore" fame?

Well, here's the 411 from the sfraves calendar:
Sunday, October 19th - We Work It Entertainment Group presents _Global
   DJ Mix Awards_
   The Ultimate DJ Celebration
   volunteers needed...
   benefits the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention
   8pm-6am, 21+. 1015 Folsom St, SF. 415.356.8127
   
Sounds great, except that 21+ part.  Being that I'm 17 and all.  I'm pissed, 
but what can you do?  Any ideas?

xoxo--Miccaela

Hey all, 

  I tried to send this earlier today, but the server said there was an error.
 :o\  Oh well, better late than never.

 Channel 54 (KTEH) in the Bay Area is trying to help bring more Anime into
the US.  They are doing this by buying episodes from Japan and airing them on
their station every weekend.  At the moment, they have Robotech and Tenchi
Muyo.  Since they are a non-profit station they have to rely on member
support and donations.  Last night, they had a huge pledge drive to show
Tenchi Muyo for it's U.S. Television Premiere.  They were giving gifts like
lil' Ryo-Ohci dolls, T-shirts, Tenchi videos, etc.  I don't know if they
would still be giving these out, but I do know they will still accept pledges
and any ideas you may have on anime, bringing it to the states, where to get
it, and esp. what to get -- subbed or dubbed.

If you want to help, call them at 1-800-225-5454 or if you're in the Bay
Area, call 408-795-5454.  Also, for those of you that can receive it, Channel
54 (not cable, so get out that antenna) airs Robotech and now, Tenchi Muyo
every Sunday at 9pm.  You can check their webpage (http://www.kteh.org) to
get exact times for each show.  

I hope everyone can help. :oD

 This message i will try to keep short & sweet, yet i feel it very
important to
express my deepest concerns for the future of our survival in this scene!

     Last night i attended "ABYSS" up in the beautiful mountains of Santa
Rosa. & enjoyed talkin' & hangin' out w/friends & star gazin' under the
clear skies up there. It was BEAUTIFUL, i saw 12 shooting stars & then
hiked up a hill later on to greet the most amazing sunrise! Those who know
me usually find me groovin' in the speakers all night long but last
night...i just felt like relaxin'.The music was o.k. & there was alot of
dust in the air from people dancin'. It was good for a free outdoor event
UNTIL!!! When departing back down the long winding dirt road this morning,
i came across some very shaken and distraught friends as their car had
flipped off the side of the cliff and smashed into a large tree!!!   The
driver was still in shock and i crawled down to help them recover some
belongings & be there to support them in their dire need of help! They
luckily, survived without severe injuries and if it weren't for that great
big tree, they would no longer be here with us!!!

     Also, after helping them out, i finally made it down to my own ride &
witnessed that ANOTHER friend's car window had been smashed by a rock that
was thrown through it!!! WHAT the FUCK is going on!!! In the last month
alone iv'e lost count with the amount of cars broken into & fights breaking
out & backpacks being stolen & total kaos @ our events!!!

     Eventhough, i'd like to wish that we have alot of power to prevent
these  occurences, we're not invincible to them happening to us. It
especially
terrifies me that we could've also experienced a very tragic incident this
morning that would've resulted in several untimely deaths of our own family
members!!! Whether YOU even know them or not...they belong to our scene, &
they're apart of our tribe!!!

     It is SO important that WE, as a family, bond together & communicate
to each other & we look out for each other and respect one another! It's
AWESOME to celebrate our music & gather together to partake in every
positive aspect of a movement such as ours...The music truly is the
drug,YET, we obviously need to focus alot more & partake in moderation & in
a very responsible & mature manner so that we can continue to be strong &
survive & gain ground in this not so positive world of ours! We can then
prove to the world that PLUR isn't fantasy, we know it works & we must
share with others our experiences of how we think,feel,& GROW!!!  Maybe
then... the world will LISTEN & begin to understand that change is good, it
comes from within.

     WE all have a purpose in our scene & in our lives on this planet!
Reflect, Accept, Know & Understand!!! If we love ourselves, then we can
love one another, & if we love each other... then PLUR is real!!!

                            Actions speak LOUDER than words,
                        peace and love to all who really DO care...
                                                       tall paul :)

I was just watchign Grosse Pointe Blank with my roomie, and aside from the
nostalgia-inducing soundtrack, I was struck by whatever that song was...  The
english version I think was named 99 Red Balloons, and there was a german
version, too, if I remember.  Two questions:

(a) Who was the original artist?
(b) How many (and are any of them good) mixes of this song are ou tthere?  It
struck me as one of those things that wouldsound really good dropped into a set
a sa "surprise"  :-)

Lets not forget something before we start wrapping up a cancellation of a
PARTY with some type of inalienable right.  It is after all a party, with
the two purposes being entertainment and money making.  They THEY you talk
about are elected representatives of the people, who, ideally represent the
constiuents demands.  Screwed because somebody couldn;t get a permit?  This
is far different than denying someones civil rights.

Althouhg I agree with your outrage and agner, it is afterall a party.  And
a party that was going to occur on govt. property.  To date the only person
to successfully pull of anything on govt. land has been Martin O'Brien, the
one and only who brings you Basics and the Gathering.  Maybe they shoulda
called him up for some pointers as to how things can be done.

Navy's perrogative.  Also the dance community has done a shitty job of
portraying itself than anything else than a massive drug fest so (take a
look at the flyers, the hidden drug references , etc..  do you really think
the authorities are that stupid?).

>     9/1/97 Burning Man - Extortion & harassment by local authorities

Didn't happen last year.  Decided to play with the authorities and got what
any party would get given the publicity of the past.  Once again, since (I
beleive this didn;t occur in CA, who would you write to?).

Permits!  Now there's the answer.  The process needs to be changed.  A good
place to start?  I dunno...

Er, uh, there have been all night parties on several of the piers there
(did you know that?), how?  Becuase of some insider who knows the Mayor and
the port authority.  You have GOt to pay to play in this city, or anywhere
else.  The key is organization, accountability, and good ol politics.  If
you plan on doing anything here or anywhere else, I think these are the
prereqs.

You mean clog up the streets, put toghter a protest, all because you want
to have a party?  How about organizing and becoming a force like the
gay/lesbian community and the other factions here in the city.  Only the
organized, who can deliver votes, gets anyone's ear here.  Just a reality
of city life.

Your parents are the ones who put these bozos in power in the first place.
And many have capitulated thier resonsibility by opting out of the
political process, and by not holding people accountable for their actions.

On the contrary, if I were a parent in Alameda, I would congratulate the
council for the fine decision making, given what I know about raves/all
night parties.

The only answer is the underground.  Other than that it will be a long
protracted, political battle with one side having the arsental of time
(i.e. elected officials stay in office longer than ravers stay raving),
money, and general support of the community who elected them.

It can be a good fight, but it will most assuredly be a long one.

Nobody is truly free.  In this country freedom is measured in degrees.  The
more money you have, the greater degree of freedom you are alotted.  Sad
but true.

------------   ORIGINAL ATTACHMENT   --------
SENT 09-29-97 FROM SMTPGATE (corey@ncd.com)

I was just watchign Grosse Pointe Blank with my roomie, and aside from the
nostalgia-inducing soundtrack, I was struck by whatever that song was...  The
english version I think was named 99 Red Balloons, and there was a german
version, too, if I remember.  Two questions:

(a) Who was the original artist?
(b) How many (and are any of them good) mixes of this song are ou tthere?  It
struck me as one of those things that wouldsound really good dropped into a set
a sa "surprise"  :-)

hi there,
my name is darren and i own tweekin records, i would like to reply to some
of the comments which appeared over the last few days.
first of all i am involved in this scene because first and formost i am a
music lover and a collector. if i was only interested in making money i
would not have bought a small independant record store, i would have opted
for a business where the mark-up on an item is more than $1 ! ( which is
what i make on a domestic record, if i am lucky)
to the the guy who bought the 2 bottom heavy records, i spoke to marjorie
(the evil WHITE woman who served you) and see assured me not only did she
apologise at the time but sold you the records at the correct price. even
though your attitude was the one which made her fell so unconfortable that
she had to ask somebody who was walking past into the store.
if you feel so wronged i will refund your money in full !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
one question i would like to ask at this point, is, what relevance does her
colour have to your problem ?
we at tweekin try to provide people with a pleasant enviroment to buy
records, if you do not like the prices or attitude of the people who work
at the store, it is siimple.
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thahks for your time
darren.

I figured anyone could remember her shorts. There was even a rap song about it.  That doesn't take any brain cells to remember.  Furthermore it would most likely have recieved a response similar to "figures you can only remember her shorts, eh,  must have been pervert. couldn't even remember what kind of car she drove."  and it  probably would have come from you.  Guess you didn't have anything constructive or creative to say, just decided to cast some aspersions instead... hey, hope you got something out of it... I always try to be there for people.

I was wondering if anyone else was going to remember them.  Although, they were actually called Sleestacks.

Subject: Re: CYBERFEST CANCELED

I agree - I hadn't planned on going but I know a lot of people who have never
had the chance to see Carl Cox or Aphex Twin. Can anyone tell me how you
could manage to see/hear/experience either one of these influential and
talented artists (OK yes they are also popular but that doesn't diminish
their influence or talent) at anything other than a massive type event? 
Unless you were in England back in the day and were lucky enough to see them
before anyone knew their names, or now are so well connected you can get them
to turn up at your house for a go on your decks, there isn't much choice.
Putting a CD in is never close to vibing off Carl Cox's bouncey energy and
big smile while you can feel the bass of the big sound system in your chest.
Even if you have to wade through 5000 16yr old gangsta kids to do it. (That
is what I've been told is the major problem with Cool World - I don't know if
this is true or not or even if it by definition is a bad thing). jd

The General Lee was a Challenger...  The jeep was white, and her Camaro was black and yellow, I am almost certain, I could be wrong...

Some kind of derivative of "eat me" should be the response to this...  so, do you mean soul food, or do I not just get the joke?

What about the General Lee [orange challenger, double blk/wht zeros]... it wrecked every show.  I used to wonder how they could do one of their jumps, have the bumper, a front quarterpanel, and the under carriage come flying off, and they would still be able to drive away... without so much as a front end misalignment or dent.  That was one hell of a car.

You know, the red and white napkin she wore as a top was pretty nifty too.  Never the less, Daisy nekkid would have probably confused me as well.

I was just watchign Grosse Pointe Blank with my roomie, and aside from the
nostalgia-inducing soundtrack, I was struck by whatever that song was...  The
english version I think was named 99 Red Balloons, and there was a german
version, too, if I remember.  Two questions:

(a) Who was the original artist?
(b) How many (and are any of them good) mixes of this song are ou tthere?  It
struck me as one of those things that wouldsound really good dropped into a set
a sa "surprise"  :-)

When we arrived at around midnight, 115 minna was already a complete
sweatbox.  Within an hour I was completely soaked, head to toe, as if
I had just jumped into a pool.  The heat and humidity was probably due to
the fact that the music totally rocked... starting with streight-up
psy-trance (none of which I had heard before), then moving into some
sick breaktrance.  breaktrance is the bomb!  fast breakbeats with
lush synth lines over it...  around 5-6am they were spinning techstep
jungle! and then they brought it back around to pure psytrance in the
morning.  It was really fun hearing this sort of variety of music.  Props
to the crew for letting people freely hang out on the street to cool
off... I couldn't beleive how loud the music was outside and the cops
didn't seem to care... Hmmmm... I'm not complaining, though!

Anybody know why Coolworl felt the compassion to change the info line in 
SF to reflect the cancellation, but not the east bay and southbay 
numbers. The last to numbers were like "yes there has been a lot of 
controversy in the media in the last couple of days, but Cyberfest is 
still going on...don't listen to anything, but this line...it's going 
off all night...7pm -8am..." total garbage. 
Is coolworld stupid, lazy, or just a punk?

Well my Saturday starts off with picking up Miss Beth in the City to
go to the party. She hands me a Red bull I was like Yes scored!! I
love red bull now Thanks to (Micron) heheh I remember that morning.
Well we start off on our Journey and let me Tell you it was a F**king
journey I live in the South bay and this party seemed like forever to
get to we got kind of lost a few times and when we finally find it we
still had like 2 miles to go to get to the party at this time it is
like 12:30 In my head im like no problem I got plenty of time cause I
was supposed to spin at 1:00 Im greeted by Seth one of the phatum boys
and he is like "Shit there is way to many people here"  This is at the
front gate keep in mind. I told him I thought no one would be there he
tells me there is like 400-500 people already. Then I thought Shit,
how am I going to get up there. We Drive up the road and there are a
shit load of cars all over the place one car stuck in the road. When
we get all the way up the guy tells us it is about a mile still to go.
But not to many people can make it up "The hill of death" it was a
steep hill. I was not about to drive my car up the hill I thought my
hoopty would not make it. Then this guy in a truck behind me offers me
and Beth a ride cause im a DJ and I was supposed to be playing 5
mintues ago. So we get up there I run to the decks cause there was
confusion on who would be playing next? I hate to be late to anyware
it is just Me. So I get there and the spot is perfect nice hills
Massive people everywhere dancing up a storm. I mean a Real Dust
storm. Can you say Dusty cough,cough. I Did what a consider a shitty
job at spinning it was very dusty and I could not see where my tracks
ended or broke down. The lights and sound was great. I am sad I missed
Cloud, Jelo, and James I heard they Rocked!!  I did get to hear this
Kid Named Trace look at for him all he is Dope he was playing some
good Cyber. Dan rocked a bit for beeing sick. Ornette was kewl to for
his first time out. In the morning as the sun came up Me, Dan, and
Jelo did a nice tag team set. It was a great party Thanks Phatum crew
and all the kewl people that showed up it was such a good party
despite the Few problems and the crash problem. Sorry about your Car
Alec. Thank God your alive Kid. For all the cyberfesties Sorry you
kids did not get to party. I posted the party too the list to give
everyone a chance to come out. Either some of you did not get the post
till it was too late or you just deleted it. In any case you missed
out on a kick ass party. Hopefully next time all will get to attend
the next phatum party. I look forward to the next one. Danny sorry for
the hold up in the morning. hehehe. Take care people and DRIVE SAFE!!!

Peace, love, cybersex ;-)

Hey All,

I am looking for a couple or three people who have some soccer skillz and 
would like to play on an indoor team.  We are having to start over so the team
is in a lower division but it is still lots of fun.

Games are on Wednesday night and start anywhere from 5:00 pm to 11:30 pm (yeah i
know thats late).

Off the wall soccer requires a membership which is $50 a year and team fees are
$60.  A session is 8 games.  It is kinda expensive but worth it. 

The first game is this wednesday so if you are interested please contact me
today preferrably.

What a fucking disaster...sorta.

Did ANYBODY meet ANYBODY from this list there?

My friend Erik and I got there around 9:20 and went to the dome by the
pond.  Nuthin but skaters EVERYWHERE...damn near impossible to find people
there...there musta been 200+ skaters.

We walked around and finally found the box office, bought our tix, and
went into the lobby, and just as we did they opened the doors to the
theater, so we headed in.

I thought I saw e.menon over on the other side of the place with 2 other
peeps, but I couldn't get over there to say hi.

The movie was pretty cool...I got my $10 worth on Coldcuts' 'Timber' and
'More Beats'n'Pieces'...fucking brilliant...made me all warm and fuzzy
inside.

Afterwards, we hung out in the lobby looking for people, but none were to
be found.

DAMN, because I even wore my green jacket and a big paper nametag...just
like I said I would.

All's I wanted was to meet some of you...

ohwell.

  I went to the earlier show. Sorry we didn't hook up!
  On the rave/techno front:
  There was a very nice program called Mixman that they were demoing in
the inner meeting area. It doesn't run on the web like the elegant
"DJDemo" crafted by SFR's  Derek Chung and Jeremy Cooper from BayMOO
(http://130.212.41.61/TURNTABLES/BAYMOOMIX.HTML), but it was a very sweet
standalone program. Wish they had it for the Macintosh.
  One of the films from the earlier show had a section of what I can only
call "visual techno." It took some video clips of an actual news show,
then looped and counterpointed them, with an effect sort of like the old
Max Headroom stutters.  I'm going to try to score a copy for SFSU, and
I'll let you know if we get it.

There's a retro clothing store in Sac named

I always thought that name was the friggin bomb and if you could come up with 
some type of variation of that it would be sooo cool.

How bout "Fat Daddy's Snack Shop?"  No?  Okay then.  I tried.

Well, I was vegging out listening to some music and I was having the feeling I 
always get when I listen to something I really like . . . . I always think, 
"Damn, I wish I could spin so I could make everyone feel what I'm feeling."

I don't want to be the next Keoki or anything, and I wouldn't even trip off 
never ever getting paid for spinning at a party as long as I had another 
daytime job that paid enough for me to buy records and equipment.  And I 
wouldn't be out to be the biggest and the best, I realize I'd be just one of a 
million amateurs.  I'd just want to make people feel good, feel like I feel 
when I hear an incredible song . . . the type of music I want to spin is so 
rare out here, people should be hearing it.

Problem:  I'm a student and I don't have a very large income (about $650 a 
month) and I have to save up for when I go off to college.  So I have limited 
time and _very_ limited funds.  It'd be hard for me to get material because I 
want to spin happy hardcore and I'd have to get all my stuff imported from the 
UK, which can't be cheap.

So I thought, "Well, I'll just learn to spin, and when I get out of college 
and get a decent job I can start throwing my own parties and spinning at 
them."  I spoke to a dj friend about this and he said that music will have 
changed so much by then.  And I want to spin the kind of 4-beat that's out 
now, plus some of the classics from the early 90s.  I want to do it now(!) but 
I don't know if I can or should.

So what should I do?

That's the best reason to start spinning.

Start small, learn off other peoples records if possible, buy 1 or 2 
records a paycheck.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend you'll be 
more likely to find THE best track to spend that money on.

Do what you want.  Hardcore's been around for a while now, it's not just 
gonna up and dissapear (tho some people wish it would :( )
And hey, in a few years the early nineties will be "retro" and in and 
all......

So, equipment wise, use friends decks.  Buy stylii(styluses?) so they'll 
be more willing to let you play on their stuff.  

Buy only 1 or 2 records per paycheck, take your time choosing them.

See if DJs you know will let you learn with their records.

If nothing else, give it a try, otherwise, you'll always be wondering 
whether you could/should have done it.

     Troy??? I wish I would have known, I would have said hello.. What were 
     you wearing??? 
     
     Anyhow, this was a cool party... They had said at the map point it had 
     sold out, but at the door, they were still letting in a few select 
     people. 
     
     This location is cool, when it's completely open. It's the same 
     location as Pro-Soy's Light my Fire Party, but this time they only had 
     the downstairs open... Very humid... The walls were sweating, no for 
     real!
     
     Music was cool, some of the mixes were clumsy, but they made up for it 
     with the choice of music... 
     
     Someone walked around with a few gallons of water, and obliged needy 
     partiers, very cool... Didn't see a 12 year old though...
     
     The only misfortunate item was when I went downstairs to get some air. 
     A young girl was having a VERRY INTENSE evening... Acid trip I 
     believe, could be wrong. But the female host at the door, with the 
     feathers in her hair, realized this was getting sorta dangerous with 
     the open door and all. So, she grabbed the girl, and yelled at her 
     "YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN" "BE COOL NOW, FRIENDS ARE HERE"  - All done out 
     of love....  
     
     Cool party, I'm glad Cyberfest didn't break my heart.. Sorry to all 
     the folks that got ripped off. I hope there's a means for a refund, 
     because you did not get the show promised... Keep the Peace!

When we arrived at around midnight, 115 minna was already a complete 
sweatbox.  Within an hour I was completely soaked, head to toe, as if
I had just jumped into a pool.  The heat and humidity was probably due to 
the fact that the music totally rocked... starting with streight-up 
psy-trance (none of which I had heard before), then moving into some
sick breaktrance.  breaktrance is the bomb!  fast breakbeats with 
lush synth lines over it...  around 5-6am they were spinning techstep 
jungle! and then they brought it back around to pure psytrance in the
morning.  It was really fun hearing this sort of variety of music.  Props 
to the crew for letting people freely hang out on the street to cool 
off... I couldn't beleive how loud the music was outside and the cops 
didn't seem to care... Hmmmm... I'm not complaining, though!

It's a good reason to start :). Although it's true, Happy hardcore 
hasn't really caught on out here to say the least, but if your motive to 
start spinning is to play and listen to the kinds of music that make you 
feel good, I say go for it. 

On the other hand....

If your motive is to play out and get people to listen to your music 
selection immediately, beware. Anyone will tell you there are way too 
many DJ's out there right now. I've experienced this personally and it's 
not a pretty scene. You could even practice for months, get really good 
at beat-matching, and still be fighting for spots at little house 
parties ;). Anyway, if you really want to get people to hear your music 
you need to start off by getting a tape recorder and making mix tapes. 
That way people can hear your stuff without being burdened by trying to 
squeeze you into thier line-up. Once enough people have heard the hard 
work you've put into your tapes they should start asking you to play at 
thier gigs without you even asking.


Anywayz...good luck :)

RE:  Hardcore

yeah, you'l prollyhave to pick up a lot of imports, but you can 
mail-order from places that have good Hardcore selections, like Dr. 
Freecloud's Mixing lab (www.drfreeclouds.com) or other soCal places.  
Hardcore is as big as ever down here, so I wouldn't worry too much about 
it drying up over the next 2 or 3 years.  Especially 'Happy' Hardcore.  
People down here seem to be more accepting of that verses Terrorcore and 
some of the 'darker' hardcore stuff.

How 'bout Earth Dance, Sat, 12-6pm, SF Civic Center Plaza?

It's free, the weather's been *bootiful* lately, and it's for a good cause
(raise awareness & funds (how they gonna do that if it's free?) for the
Tibetan cause).

Graema, Cesar x Twerk, Dutch, UFO x Jason Mouse x Noel.
It's a Space Children event...dunno why it's not on SFRaves Calendar, tho'.

BTW, am I the only one who finds the S.C. web site utterly useless? 2 of the
4 main links lead to nowhere, and the Calendar section still says
"Juggernaut...coming soon..." which happened like, 2 months ago?

Event coordinators should not be responsible for the actions of the
attendees, but they should be responsible for the environment they create.
For example, just over a week ago, I was at a cool little party in the
city, and one of the attendees started flipping out a little.  It was /not/
the party throwers fault that this happened.  It /was/, however, due to
good handling by the people throwing the event that the situation didn't
get out of control.  Having a ton of friendly people there who were all
willing to help calm the person down, was great, and, contributed to the
great vibe that was floating around.  Its hard o have that sort of thing
happen at a massive, its not the same.  

People who don't take responsibility for their parties are not a part of
the underground, they are exploiting it.  The moment it becomes about money
and ego and drugs, and not about music and friendship and everything else,
its lost its meaning.  It still might be a great show, but it probably
won't be a great experience.


Just my long rambling take...

Does anyone have information as to where the "funds for the Tibetan cause"
go? It seems like a difficult issue for money to solve, and the only time
I ever even hear about it is when someone mentions raising funds. Not to
sound incompassionate or greedy or anything, but I'd like to know that
any money I donate to this cause is being put to good use...that someone
is actually *doing something* other than printing bumper stickers ;P

Ok...now I'm being surly...ffffpwhap!..that's better.

Seriously, though, if anyone has info, please forward it. 

thanks :)

No, this isn't a bsp...more of an rfi. A few times while riding in GG park
on sundays I've run across a particularly interesting group. I don't know
if they're a club or organization or anything, but (when I saw it) it
consisted of about 10-20 people playing drums, and about 150 people, split
into groups, dancing to the drums. It was all really quite cool, but
unfortunately I have been unable to find these folks again.

Does anyone know who/what/when/where this is?

Thanks,

/justin

I was just watchign Grosse Pointe Blank with my roomie, and aside from the 
nostalgia-inducing soundtrack, I was struck by whatever that song was...  The 
english version I think was named 99 Red Balloons, and there was a german 
version, too, if I remember.  Two questions:
     
(a) Who was the original artist?
(b) How many (and are any of them good) mixes of this song are ou tthere?  It 
struck me as one of those things that wouldsound really good dropped into a set 
a sa "surprise"  :-)

Yes, this is something that happens every sunday in GG park, near the pan
handle, that at a place called Hippy Hill... there are usually 1-2 hundred
people there building up and amazing vibe.  It is another close knit family,
because we see the same people each weekend, and get to know each other thru
it.   It usually begins around 1 or 2 pm, but there are people hanging out
from 10 or so in the morning... it is a nice wind down from saturday night.  
There is not really a name of any organization that does it, it's just
whoever wants to jam or dance or connect goes... and thats what its all
about... :)  
we all should arrange to meet together there sometime,  ...?  anyone?

I live across the street from GG park, so I am over there frequently.

I think my favorite thing about the "drum circle" is that it is not *only*
drums, but anything anyone wants to play.  You frequently get saxophonists,
guitarists, harmonicas, whatever.  My favorite is the guy who drops by
occassionally to play the stick-and-coke-bottle.  They are people of all
different ages, backgrounds, and musical skill levels.  People show up if
they want to, which makes each musical creation entirely spontaneous and
unique.

One of my favorite things about GG park in general is the frequent
spontaneous musical that occurs.  It is quite common to run across someone
practicing in one of the subterranean walkways under the streets (great
acoustics!) or sitting in a little grove of trees serenading their
girlfriend.

If you haven't visited GG park from a musical perspective, I highly
recommend it.

Lying around in the sun listening to people make music is also a great way
to spend those lazy sunday afternoons after being up all night at a party.

Hi, the only thing I know of is the Global DJ mix awards... which i 
will be playing at. as far as i know I will be the first dj to play 
this kind of music in that area. I'm not sure about this over 21 
business, I'm going to talk to the promoters about that one.

  At San Francisco State we have a film called "Little Jesus," shot at
Hippie Hill in 1969. There was drum and weird instrument action even then. 
The amazing highlight (no pun) of the film, though, shows the folks
passing around a gas mask loaded with marijuana. People would put on the
mask, and the smoke would pour out the nozzle in front and around the
sides of the mask -- making the smoker inside look like a barbequed alien
-- then they'd take the mask off and pass it to the next person. You could
almost see the birds flying out of the eyelids of the smokers as they
emerged.  :<)

That would be totally cool...1 or 2 is early for me on a sunday ;-), but
it would be well worth it... it's amazing just to watch; I'm participation
would be most excellent.

this certainly merits a meeting spot...

i've been a naughty non-postin' lurker flake dj type slacker off about 
giving due props to the many lovely dj's that have saved my life with a 
song lately so here goes......

on sunday i didn't know i would be required to wear leather so me and my 
mac dad friend byron cruised on down  to chek the scene with a 
destination unknown as spundae.  (no, we're not gay... really)

after swealtering in the hot sun and checking out the sites, we 
proceeded to shake shake shake to the talents of a dj who was playing 
handbag house.  who'd thought? i didn't catch his name but i will....

then we went to vsf, my first time, and paid $3, not bad, and proceeded 
to get loose.  some stadouts that i saw we're Jerry Bonham, verry tasty 
trance, and angel in the front room.  i also caught a slice of BT live 
on the roof.  i think that spundae is a well run club and they 
definately delivered.

others that i've seen in recent weeks that have made me move:  ethan in 
people's park, treavor and chris of moontribe and junglist linda love. 
also not to forget, did you guys see Traxx a coupla weeks back? man! i 
can't get that set outta my head, and that's a good thing.  mystic bill 
was in there as well and represented chicago in the fullest way.

looking foward to stacey pullen.....

It started off in the blistering heat of the Folsom Street fair, the 
kinkiest show on Earth with hundreds and even thousands of leather clad 
fetishists prowling and mincing the streets like a modern-day Sodom and 
Gomorrah to the soundtrack of dirty filthy fucked up house.
>From this surreal scene I head down to the pier, and await embarkation 
of the Sunset boat. Finally, after much waiting, we all pile upon the 
decks and sit out top, watching the sun go down and waiting for the show 
to begin. There must be over 500 people on board, all looking eager to 
get on with the serious business of dancing their way around the bay, and 
the frustration at the late leaving time is rife in the air. Eventually 
we chug off into the sunset with a loud cheer, the music boots up and 
the party kicks off. Right from the start I can tell its going to be 
something beyond a normal party experience - there is a vibe in the air that 
everyone there is going to interact at their best to create something 
really special. We kick off with some funky hip hop on the top deck, and 
killer deep house on the lower deck, people get straight into it - no 
warm up at all, and within 30 seconds the whole place is kicking to the 
sounds of appreciative yells of joy over the deep reverberating bass 
rhythms from deep within the boat. 
Pretty soon we are out in the bay, looking out at the incredible 
palette the sunset is daubing on the horizon beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, 
and the multitude of lights piercing the dark silhouettes of the 
skyscrapers dominating the city skyline. Soon we pass out under the bridge 
itself, everyone crowded on the open-air deck craning their necks at the 
awesome sight of the towering red structure. Back to business down below we 
are treated to more crazy funky Chicago house from Derrick Carter's 
Chicago partner (Who's name escapes me) and as the boat chugs its way along 
the Marin county coastline and past Alcatraz and Treasure Island the 
beat just goes straight on and on, people locked onto one groove, everyone 
on the same wavelength - crazy San Fransiscans exercising their right 
to party hard. 
At one point I look out of the window and see an insane sight - we are 
cruising past the old naval air base at Alameda, and the huge naval 
bunkers and gun turrets and docking stations lit up by sparse halogen light 
create a really freaky atmosphere, a technospherical set through which 
we cruise on our little mobile island of humanity powered by organic 
house beats.
All too soon the boat starts to turn, and we leisurely make our way 
back, the dancefloor blistering with heat as people go for it even harder 
as they realise they haven't much time left, and the music gets harder 
and more evil and techno-like as we all dance ourselves into a rabid 
frenzy of pure hedonism, and all it takes is a quick look out of the window, 
or a brief walk onto the open deck to be transported from this clubbing 
frenzy into the beauty of a warm starlit night, with the sparkling 
lights of the approaching city providing the visual effects.
A close flyby of the downtown San Fransisco coastline while the DJ 
slaps on Gary Newman's "Cars" just for that final bit of insanity, and 
we're back in dock, the trip over, and people stumble off the boat, dazed 
and confused and irreversibly altered for having been a part of the one 
mind trapped aboard a boat that we all became for those all-too brief 
hours.
Sunset boat parties are something else.

 This is no joke people. The East Bass needs to come out and represent! No
more driving across the Bay Bridge on your scooter to get to a slamming club!
No more needing to bail from the club at 11:50 because you need to get to
BART before the last train leaves! No more paying a dollar for bridge toll on
top of what you pay to get into the club youre going to!

This club is for music lovers, East Bass and beyond.....

ps-maybe this week we can give a dollar off to everyone who shows up and can
prove they live in SF?

Heya!!

My friend Amy lost a bag @ the Sunset Boat Party.

Description:    Blue Guatamalan backpack
Contents:       Lots of condoms(!), Dirty Dice(?), and, of course, a wallet
with 
                all the usual personal stuff.

As one would figure, the wallet is most important, mainly for the ID and
bank cards. You can keep the money.

If ANYONE has info for Amy, please give here a call at 415 863 8910. She
would love to hear from you.

Ciao!


Jonas

Hey all yous:
 Since we are walking down memory lane here ,let me ask you to recall a
 few fashion fads of me younger years:
 (I hope nobody has posted this yet as I have only started to pay
 attention to this thread)
  Do you recall:
 Circa 1980
 Those little, satiny  shorts  with one side white & one side a solid
 color that had the little dove in the corner?
 If you can remember that fashion trend(gurp),you can probably also 
recall those shorts worn with leg warmers..as another.Ha ha.
 I wish I had some pics.

I know this thread is kinda beaten and dead, but I just had to say:

andyhawks said:
>Think back -- if you were 17 years old and just 
>discovering techno, the rave scene, and LSD concurrently -- 

This describes me.  Born 12/8/79.  First got into the music when "Amp" started 
airing.  First rave was in April this year.  First candyflip was in late 
August.

>wouldn't Keoki's music appeal to you and wouldn't his personality >attract 
you if nothing other than for the fact that he makes himself >highly visible?

Nope.  No way, Jose.  Hell naw.  Nuh-uh.  No sir.

Not all of us teenybopper newbies are as predictable as ya'll seem to think.  
I don't even like The Prodigy too much (although I confess to owning and 
enjoying "The Prodigy Experience")

But I have friends who fit the above description who think Keoki is hella 
tight.  The same people who down other djs/musicians for being too commercial 
(e.g. The Prodigy).  Go figure.

Does this sound like bitching?  Sorry, I'm not pissed or anything, just had to 
address that though.  Bugged me a little bit.

>>Yes, this is something that happens every sunday in GG park, near the pan
handle, that at a place called Hippy Hill... there are usually 1-2 hundred
people there building up and amazing vibe.  It is another close knit family,
because we see the same people each weekend, and get to know each other thru
it.   It usually begins around 1 or 2 pm, but there are people hanging out
from 10 or so in the morning... it is a nice wind down from saturday night.  
There is not really a name of any organization that does it, it's just
whoever wants to jam or dance or connect goes... and thats what its all
about... :)  
we all should arrange to meet together there sometime,  ...?  anyone?
Passing the Love,

Yes yes!  this is great fun, perhaps the most relaxed I ever get is sitting in 
the sun, listening to the rhythms.  I was there on Sat., with my lil bro, 
playing catch.  I know there are other SFR's that go sometimes, (Kerryl?), we 
should all meet at one of these. Ja wohl! Nathan

My $.02:

I don't really give a crap about his attitude, but I have heard him
spin, own a bootleg of his stuff that he played w/ DJ Dan coupla years
ago, and one of his CD mixes f*ckin' jump.
I think his selection of music when he mixes is awesome.
However, I do think his own self produced music kinda sucks. It never
really goes anywhere.
Anyway, I am sure that he is completely aware of the concern that y'all
are bringing up due to his new CD being called "ego trip."
If that is what it is, so be it...His karma will take care of the  bad
vibes he spreads wittingly.
otherwise, (a la Donnie Brasco):

Fahgetta 'bout it.

p.s. Wow, just getting involved in the scene since Amp started to air?
What was the impetus for you to candyflip? why even bother, i guess,
when the whole atmosphere is already different enough, dontcha think? I
didn't take E at all for a good seven years while I was raving my heart
out. I was so into the music. I tried it on a whim last year to see what
it was all about. It was great, don't get me totally wrong, but I'm glad
that I had a vision of the scene that wasn't tainted by the "drug
gogles" that a lot of people have. Y'know, its the ones that can't
imagine going out unless they are on something I think that totally miss
the amazing effect that the music can have on an even sober person.
Anyway, I guess I just bring it up (being the old fart that I am)
because I would hate to see you get burned out or dependent on
extraneous substances to see how amazing all of this can truly be.
Anyway, i guess that's my 4 cents.

Hey everyone out there where ever you are, whatever you may be doing, 
whomever you may be dreaming about, I figured I would like to say a 
little something motivational and cheerful just because...well, I'd like 
to.
  

   Smiles, ice cream, beaches, sunsets and full moons shinning the light 
on everything that is.
   Love, tranquility, happiness, and those who were meant to be...
   Laughter, work, life, all that has to be done...
   Wind blowing through you fingers while you are admiring your best of 
friends...
   All that used to be, can still be created in your souls, 
   Your first kiss...
   Clear, brisk nights, at a family barbeque with cousins, aunts, and 
uncles who you have never met before...
   Memories, creating and sharing them with those you want to love and 
remembering those times you have hated...laughing at them.
   If darkness comes, so will the light, we must keep our heads high and 
trample through it like a field of knee-high grass.  
   Everything happens for a reason, and everything can be learned from 
and should be.  There are people who care, you may have just not found 
them yet, 
   but they are thinking of you as you are thinking of them...happily, 
embracing the moments...when you will meet...

   I just felt like sharing what was on my brain...sorry if I caused 
anyone any misfortune  :)
   Can anyone tell that I'm in love? :P

  PLUR everyone and good night, for tomorrow is a new experience

"One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by 
making darkness conscious."
                         -C.G. Jung

Happily,
  bAByHueY

P.S.
and when you do find that someone, don't forget to bring your...

(a) As we've all read by now, it's by nena
(b) the german version is Neun-und-neunzig Luftballoonen

I don't know all the Dj's that have used it, but I know for a fact that
Paulina Taylor used it in his mixtape, "Smile 2"   You can find it at
Pureacid Mixtapes in Torrence (down in LA) or just find the webpage and order
it.  Ken may have a Real Audio sample of it on the page.  The page is at:
http://www.pureacidmixtapes.com/start.htm

Enjoy now. :o)

Trance and Jungle Factory has them for $449.. they are back ordered but
they're the best price.. also, if you take a receipt or coupon from the TJ
factory to another store you can get them for $449 too.. like Goodguys and
circuit city.

     OOOOOoooohh.  I've got something for people who have been in the bay 
     area for awhile...
     
     Do you remember way back when, on TV20-KOFY, when they had 3-D movies, 
     and the greatest,... Scratch n Sniff TV... You'd have to go to 7-11, 
     pickup your very cool 3-D glasses, or your SNUFF sheet, with all the 
     cool smells going on..  Grab a slurpee, turn on the TV and when a 
     number would flash on the TV, you'd scratch n sniff that number on 
     your page.... INTERACTIVE TELEVISION BEGINS PEOPLE!!!
     
     Wow... Peace.

Hey all yous:
 Since we are walking down memory lane here ,let me ask you to recall a 
 few fashion fads of me younger years:
 (I hope nobody has posted this yet as I have only started to pay 
 attention to this thread)
  Do you recall:
 Circa 1980
 Those little, satiny  shorts  with one side white & one side a solid 
 color that had the little dove in the corner?
 If you can remember that fashion trend(gurp),you can probably also 
recall those shorts worn with leg warmers..as another.Ha ha.
 I wish I had some pics.

I love hippie hill drum sessions....I used to live around the corner from the
Haight and I would go every Sunday...its fun to bring your dog...if you have
one...I wouldn't call it a candy-raver scene...it's more of a
hippie-kickback-chill spot...yet you still have that cool drum circle beat
going on....it's a good vibe....you do get the occasional tourist photo shoot
moments going on...it's fun....yeah!!!!!!! It sometimes lasts until 4:20 on a
nice day. I'll be there...hope to see you there.....oh wait....I'm going to
San Diego with Rebecca and Janel this weekend...I forgot....does anyone have
any suggestions for San Diego? We are in search of a good party to go
to....underground....any tips will be appreciated...have a beautiful
day!!!!!!

The drum circle at Hippie Hill is a wonderful part of San Francisco, with a
long history and a great vibe.  I haven't been there for a couple months,
and I miss it.  It happens every week.  Maybe there should be a weekly
meeting place?  (I am being a just little selfish here, as I can not meet
this weekend :>)  ).  A good place to meet is just behind the bench.  

See you all there next week.

Peace food and hug bombs,
Kerry

My e-mail's a little persnickity today - hope this works.
Sorry to beat this dead horse but this point is one I'm really wondering
about.

A massive certainly isn;t a social event  - its an avenue to see/hear
performers that you wouldn't otherwise be able to see/hear live. That is why
the atmosphere is rock concert-ish. And that is why I don;t go to too  many.
But if someone had been booked that i really wanted to see I probably
would've. But not for any of the reasons I go to sunset. Apples and oranges.

thanks for your input - jd

Subject: Re: CYBERFEST CANCELED

I agree - I hadn't planned on going but I know a lot of people who have never
had the chance to see Carl Cox or Aphex Twin. Can anyone tell me how you
could manage to see/hear/experience either one of these influential and
talented artists (OK yes they are also popular but that doesn't diminish
their influence or talent) at anything other than a massive type event? 
Unless you were in England back in the day and were lucky enough to see them
before anyone knew their names, or now are so well connected you can get them
to turn up at your house for a go on your decks, there isn't much choice.
Putting a CD in is never close to vibing off Carl Cox's bouncey energy and
big smile while you can feel the bass of the big sound system in your chest.
Even if you have to wade through 5000 16yr old gangsta kids to do it. (That
is what I've been told is the major problem with Cool World - I don't know if
this is true or not or even if it by definition is a bad thing). jd

So I double click the addy below and watch this amazing video for Apex Twin
on my PC.  I have to say that this is an awesome video and the music is
fricken bad ass.  It reminds me of the old industrial days, and my Carcass,
Cannibal Corpse days all rolled up into a tad bit of drum and bass.  (yes,
I used to listen to death metal, and still do) The video does the song
justice.  Thanks for the addy! =)  If you have the capabilities to see this
do it.  It might not be your cup of tea, but with the way my days going
this made it all better!  Excellent!

hmm..  the audio came out in such a bad quality (maybe 8 bitz max) and the
video is choppy..  guess you need a digital line to enjoy this or any
online video/music.

i truely wish the chipmakers would engineer some rather ground breaking
technology, this is more pain than pleasure nowadays.

After meeting that cat many a time, I think it's safe to say that
Byroniquai should be afraid, very afraid.  Little too much THC in that
cat's blood.

I have that track!! It is called 2 fat guitars it is a cheese old rave
93 anthem or around that time? I have it. I might sell it but I have
to make sure I still have it I may have given it away. I still have
rolling gear from that era as well you all know the one with the
whitney houstan sample "Ive got it" it was another anthem I use to
play from time to time at universal groove. Does anyone remember that
old gig besides Jazz-E ?

Actually, I have really good connectivity, and it still wasn't all that
good (picture size was too small, and the audio sound was fair at best).
Oh well.

and drink beer and spin with your friends.

I agree 100%, excellent review.

I work for an ISP, sitting here on a T1 of bandwidth, and it was still as you say.

I was not allowed to have dolls...cause i was a boy.
But i kept ripping the head off my sisters Ringo doll,
(ringo was one of the beatles for you youngins)
so i was finally given a lucky troll with flourescent hair
so that i would leave my sisters dolls alone.

I also had a stuffed chipmunk that I called chippy.
I carried him everywhere until his fur was worn off
and his head started to come loose. Then my dad
took him out to his workshop and did surgery to replace
his fur and reattach his head. I never went anywhere
without chippy tucked under my arm so i was very upset
while he was undergoing surgery. 

My middle name is alvin ...i was named after alvin
the chipmunk...and have lived up to my name...

Okay, speaking of interactive TV, does anyone remember that sci-fi kids 
show where you could go buy the toys of the ships and you could shoot at 
the screen at the bad guys and they could shoot at your ship too!  I 
never actually played with one but I saw them and I thought it was just 
weird!

Or how about playing Intellivision through WPIX TV station (NYC) by calling
the station and--if you were lucky enough to be chosen--saying, "Pix" into
the phone to activate the fire button of the controller as you watched the
results in real-time on the TV. It was done during commercial breaks in the
afternoons. The caller was able to play one full game and those who beat the
high score got gift certificates for Toys 'R' Us.

Sheeeit you had a Teddy Ruckspin? My gawd you must be barely out of
diapers. Why in my day our toys didn't talk. We had to use our
imaginations. We didn't mind; we liked it. When I was young I had some
Planet of The Apes action figures, and a model of a Wankel rotary engine.
When I was in High school, all the girls wore Sergio Valente, Or Chemin de
Fer (sp?) Jeans. <toggle Homer Simpson voice> Mmmmm camel toe. Now that's
ancient history. Anyways remembering odd things doesn't make you old, bad
fashion does. As I always say: You're only as old as your fashions are lame.

Although I've been subscribed to SF-Raves for several months now, I've
never found the need to post. So hi, I'm Matt, and I thought you might
find the following interesting:

(My apologies if this fuels a renewal of heated discussions.)

---------------

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 30 (UPI) _ Legislation signed into law by the governor
will outlaw the party drug GHB, sometimes called ``liquid ecstasy'' or
the ``date rape'' drug.

Beginning next Jan. 1, the measure by Assemblyman Larry Bowler, R-Elk
Grove, will make it a felony to possess gamma-hydroxybutyrate, which may
cause respiratory arrest, liver failure, seizures and prolonged
unconsciousness.

Bowler says the bill was requested by law enforcement officers in San
Francisco and Los Angeles who say GHB is out of control among youths who
brew it in bathtubs from engine solvents and lye.

Manufacture and sale of GHB is prohibited in the United States, but
possession isn't illegal in most parts of the country.

Wilson also signed a bill that adds the Internet and electronic mail to
the list of mediums through which it's illegal to distribute harmful
sexual material to a minor.

Also signed was a bill that prohibits rapists from obtaining custody or
having unsupervised visitation of a child who was conceived as a result
of the rape.

Another newly signed measure prohibits the sale, manufacture, possession
and importation of military practice or metal replica hand grenades.
Gangs fill them with explosives and use them as weapons.

Not to be defensive,  BUT
I didn't say that I had a Teddy Ruckspin.(reading over my original post)    
Nope...sure didn't.  I was just quoting the commercial.  I'm sure you 
can quote the commercial also.  Does that mean that you just got out of 
diapers?  I know I'm not old (20), but I did just get out of diapers 3 
weeks ago. Should have seen my accident at Organic!  =0)

Sheeeit you had a Teddy Ruckspin? My gawd you must be barely out of
diapers. Why in my day our toys didn't talk. We had to use our
imaginations. We didn't mind; we liked it. When I was young I had some
Planet of The Apes action figures, and a model of a Wankel rotary 
engine.

Extra points for anybody that can point me to the URL of

They were on buchu for a long time, I'm sure I have them on a tape
somewhere, should I dredge them up?  I just grep'ed through a directory
of tape listings I have and found the files, let me know if you want
them... that stuff was prime, Whew!

Hi all!  ]=}

 First off I'm sorry to spam both lists but this is a very relavant 
question or two...

 My housemate just bought a pair of tables and a mixer (Numark, rrrrrr) 
as well as other goodies. (Big happy face here as I get to play as well!) 
As I'm the one who gets to set them up I was looking through the manuals 
and found some needed info missing.

 The tables are Technics SL-1200MK2. Can anyone give me some info on 
these beautiful machines? Are they any different from other 1200s? Also; 
I have the tone arms balanced (set at 0) but I don't know what the 
correct stylus pressure should be (we have the Ortofon Concorde with the 
Night Club S stylus). The Ortofon spec sheet has an "Equivalent stylus 
tip mass" (at 0.5 mg). Is that the number I'm looking for?

 I also have no height for the stylus to adjust the tonearm height. Do I 
have to measure it myself or am I juist missing something here.

 Ever since my unexpected dance set at Burning Man this year I've been 
itching to spin more but too poor to really do it. But now!.....  :)

hugz,



Ran D. Dreams
