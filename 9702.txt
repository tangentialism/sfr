 Gee, and if I threatened to kill you or someone close to you I wonder 
what you would do. Stab me maybe? I really wouldn't doubt it given the 
violence in your posts (not only to me but to others, It is amazing how 
you seem to think you are the only one with the right answers and that 
you never make a mistake and anyone disagreeing with you is treated to 
name calling and yelling)) And would that have been wrong of me to 
say that and perhaps it could be argued that I called that upon myself?

 Wrong. I believe I said "it _could_ be that TT called this upon 
himself" (underline added) in my original post that you responded to. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong as I don't have the original letter.

 If he did threatened then my opinion is he called the action upon 
himself. If you want me to consider your opinion and perspective you'll   
have to stop being so shitty about communicating. All I'm hearing from 
you is anger, not reason.

 Maybe. I havn't seen TT or had his prescence at the hospital confirmed 
by anyone.


> There is no excuse for this. Period. 

 Not for his stabbing, no there isn't. As I have already mentioned (and 
what should be obvious given my call for a boycott of Stevenson/GT) I do 
not support or condone the violence AT ALL.

 Again another sound bite! ooo I'm impressed. Show me the hypocrisy.

 Yeah, I know. I just study 1st aid/CPR for kicks. I prevented a violent 
person from hurting himself and others, peacefully (after he attacked me), 
while on 4 drops, knowing I would have to deal with police. Your so 
correct it just scares me.  ;)

 Well, I had thought the subject was dropped after I apologised for my 
mistake in communication, but if you want to bring it up...   ;)

Sure. 

You are perfectly willing to pass judgement on others based on rumors. You
make statements based on those rumors. You make the statement, as you
reiterate below, that someones words somehow allow for  *physical*
violence upon a person, almost as if it is an expected thing. All of this
without the benefit of any real knowledge of what occured.

No, it would be more accurate to say that you *HEARD* that he claimed he
was going to kill someone. Do you know this person so well as to know the
people he was dealing with, and what was going on besides some second hand
story you got from "someone who knew someone who heard something?" I
don't.

I suggest you go up a couple of paragraphs and look at your own, if we are
going to enter into petty grammar discussions.

> TT. 

That is exactly what you are doing. What you are saying is little 
different than saying "Well, TT drove them to stab him."

And just what neighborhood are we in? Is this what our neigborhood is 
about now? People getting stabbed? Sorry, this isn't the neighborhood I
want to be any part of.

Again, this is all conjecture. Which is what all your statements are
based on.

It is not insecurity or lack of validity that leads me to yelling or name
calling. It is sheer frustration that someone could hold what is in my
opinion such a misguided, inhuman, and uncompassionate view. Especially
amongst a group of people that usually seem to give a damn about one
another.

Great, so now when the parties get busted, we can all be wearing flourescent 
green ribbons as we sit on the curb. That will show them!

How bout doing something truly revolutionary, like finding out our
remaining rights in Amerika and exercising them? I remember reading
something in some old, dusty, forgotten document about the freedom of
assembly. Or maybe it was a dream....

>From a friend of Thomas Troubles, I hear that he was stabbed 13(?) times in
the face and chest, by 4 black dudes who broke into his home in Berkeley and
were stealing his equipment.  Apparently he tried to keep them from taking

I'm told he is staying home with a bunch of stitches and a .44 by his bed.
Hardy motherfucker, sounds like to me...  I don't know about the facts of
the busted party, or who the burglars were...  

I heard this from someone who got it from TT himself, so I'm just passing it

 i don't feel so good,


 Well, besides being completly bitched at and called a moron in front of 
about 800 people (oh joy), I just recieved a phone call from Thomas 
Trouble (I really should have gone out tonight). This is going to be long...


 In my posts concerning the bust of the last GT parties, I had mentioned 
that rumor had that TT called the police. TT is _very_ upset by this, 
especially as he is not online and cannot respond. In the interest of 
fairness (and despite the fact I have to wake up for work in about 4 
hours) I am posting TT's report on some of the situations surronding this 
mess.

 TT had an argument with the russians (over DJ's) at the Karma 5 party. 
There was some hot words but TT denies saying "I'm going to kill...". His 
report is that the russians were upset and claimed they were going to 
kick his ass and his response was "we'll see whose ass gets kicked" 
(these words may be slightly off but not by much from what Tom said).

 His flat was robbed, he went to the warehouse and got most equipment 
back confronting (and beating up) two of the russians. He was still 
missing a CD burner. He talked with the parents of the two russians he 
got his other equipment back from, and they were concerned about police 
and their sons being deported.

 On Sunday the 26th (Jan.), TT drove up (to his flat?) and saw the other 
two russians. He hurried to talk to them and to let them know everything 
was all right. As he was talking to them he was struck several times and 
he tried to defend himself but a knife was pulled out. They didn't stab 
him once but 13 times. As he lay in a pool of blood, pretending to be 
dead, the russians got in their car and tried to run over him. Despite a 
knife wound in the neck to an artery he evaded the russians.

 He is getting stitches out on Sunday and will have lovely scars to show off.

 Tom swears that he did not call the police about the Stevenson 
warehouse. He swears on his mum and family. In fact he says he will give 
his sound system to anyone who can prove he called the police about 
Stevenson. Tom says that two of the russians (Eugene and Max) are willing 
to state that they believe Tom did not call the police. And that the 
reason the police came was because a power cable (damn them cables) was 
run to a neighboring warehouse which the police had checked earlier (that 
day or the day before GT I believe TT said).

 For my part I believe I said that the info I heard concerning all this 
was info told to me, rumors. However some people didn't see it that way 
and told TT I was telling everyone that he was responsible for the bust. 
If anyone can send me a copy of my posts concerning that it would be 
greatly appreciated. I just want to see how much shoe needs to be 
inserted into my mouth.


bye,

Ran D.Dreams

 Prove it. i fuck up sometimes but I don't think so here. I believe I

So?

 That is not what I said. Not allow as in it's okay but if you strike a 
match flame usually results. If you threatened people ( and I said, 
again, that TT _may_ have...") especially sketchy people you are inviting 
violence into your life. It is not right, it is not proper, it is not 
wanted but it happens.

 Correct. As I have pointed out in about three responses to you now. You 
seem to be (for the sake of your argument/anger) ignoring that.

 Well Iactually got it from two seperate sousrces. That don't matter due 
to my original disclaimer.

 At least I'm not yelling.

 No, I'm saying that he set himself up (if he had said that). You don't 
deal with psychos that way and expect your guardian angel to protect you.

 Oh yeah thats right. Your perfect. You never go into neighborhoods, 
ever, where violence might occur.

 True. And it was a conjecture, as stated by me in my first post that 
you replied so violently to, from the very start.

 Get a grip then. People aren't as perfect as you. And if you had 
bothered to read my original post carefully, you would have seen that I 
was speaking specutivly.

 I sure wish we could have had this discussion 5 posts ago. It would have 
saved a lot of bandwidth.

   Yeah...I watched this show last night and I was laughing all the way!
What really surprised and amused me was the fact that they actually
referred to the drug the killer was handing out as Ecstacy and not some
other dreamed up title...Yeap, folks E has now hit the mainstream. But,
I'm going to continue to do what I've always done when I've seen
rave-related shows: just ignore it all!
   I hope that all of you have a wonderful weekend at whatever you
do...I'll be at home pounding away at the books..
                                        Love-

First off, I want to say I was disgusted at mr. Ruiz racist post. Just
shows how much real contact people have with African-American's in this
KKKountry.  More segregated than ever (there are studies that back this
stuff up, check them out).  I feel sorry for this KKKountry andd this
planet that has to deal with the constant assualt against people of color.
Fuck it, the world is getting browner, and I am thankful for that.

As for the content of Mr. Ruiz post, shows how FAR BEHIND the curve the
general public is when it comes to black slang OR ebonics.  Some of the
phraseology is SO OLD, that to speak in such terms would certainly label
you , er, "out-of-the loop".  You  can always tell when certain people
outside of a demographic interprets what they hear.  It probably took
whomever a whole year to put that tepid shit together.  Adn byt he time it
is put together the words and meanings have changed.  If people KNEW
anything about Africans's they would know this, but my suspiscion has
always been people DON'T care about Africans in this country so fuck 'em.
Especially if THEY can't take a joke.

Noah, get real, the terms are old.  Go to the, er, hood and check yourself
to some un-cut knowledge.  Who knows, dey might bust you off somethin'
proper.

I am glad that , like the minstrel shows of the past, you and other techno
weenies, find great humor in laughing at black vernacular.  We often
ridicule those things we understand least.  Like my anger at all of this
bullshit.  I can't wait for the sorry ass messages lebelling me a racist
for how I feel, or citing "hey he was only joking, lighten up!".  Well, I
will NEVER lighten up, I am black, don't wanna get no lighter, love the
melanin factor.  Muthafuckas gobblin' to get some, the shit so righteous.
Stop crackin' on my people, and I'll stop busting science.  For all you
pedants, "my people" are the human race, fuck that, IS the human race.
Here in this kkkountry, my people refers to ALL people of color, I want to
include everyone, but not everyone wants to be included.

As for Larry's comment, I can only say that I am sure there are people who
would've considered James Earl Ray, Byron Delabeckwith, Mr. Stoner, Jesse
Helms, and the ubiquitous senate virus Strom Thrumond as "nice guys".  Only
by virtue that they did nothing to them.  Shortsighted.  A man is judged by
the company he keeps.  I for one would never want to call any of the
aforementioned people my friends.  Nor any racist scumbag.  But, to each
his own.  Everyone makes thier own bed, and eventually must sleep in it.
Hope that nobody's burns in the process.

Out like Moses after the first rave,
John

P.S.  I hate those long sigs.

that's why hearing Ethan answering reasonable questions about raves, fnf,
sfraves & hyperreal.com on the "Internet Cafe" on PBS last night was
heartening ("Friends and Family are a group of people which got together
about 3 years ago to promote raves, which are large dance celebrations,
which celebrate life through music and dance ...")

but it's a drop in the media ocean ... I suspect the media will get worse

Black Russians?  Now I'm really confused.  It's funny how rumors
mutate...

Subject: Party Tonight!!!! 
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Hey all you beautiful people out there in SFRave land.... I'm going out for
the first time since New Year's and I'M SOOOOO EXCITED!!!!   I narrowed my
choices down to Cloud Factory and Odyssey and I ended up picking Odyssey.
 But if anything happens in terms of my friends' finances (most of them are
broke ravers), etc., then who knows where I'll end up....





















                                                                        Also,
since I plan on doing E tonight (lots of it), I don't think I'll be wanting
to go home when the party ends, so it will be after-party time for me!  Yeah!
 I know there will be at least 2 after-parties, but does anyone know anything
about them?  If you have a number, the cost, etc., please leave a message on
my voice-mail (415-253-2568) as I probably won't be able to use my computer
the rest of the day to retrieve any e-mails.   
Also, since I want to meet all you lovely people, I'll describe what I'm
going to be wearing tonight.  I'm definitely wearing a pair of blue-jeans
that are the low-slung, hip-hugger, bell-bottomish type jeans that look
really cool with a black pair of ankle boots that have a bit of a chunk heel.
 As for a top, I'll either be wearing a black clingy stretchy bare-midriff
half-top that has long sleeves and a bit of a mock turtleneck to it, or a
rainbow stretchy half-top, or a bright lime green polyester lace button-up
top that is sort of reminiscent of the 70's and I'll wear a black bra under
it.  I wouldn't normally tell you that, but since the top is lacey, the bra
is a little bit visible. As for the rest of my description, I'm petite (like
5' 3" without heels) and slim, and I have long wavy chestnut red hair that
goes about halfway down my back.  And I will have very dilated eyes so I
doubt you'll see the color, but they're big and blue (just in case there are
any lighted areas where people can really see each other).  I know that I
probably just gave you way more information than you need... or want, for
that matter.  But I wanted to give you as detailed a description as possible,
because I REALLY want you to be able to find me so that we can meet!!!!
  Anyways, other than that, I'll be the one bopping through the croud dancing
with some funk to my step... I know, I know....just like everybody else will
be... LOL.
So everybody, have a great time tonight (and tomorrow) practicing PLUR and
just having random fun.  Be safe, be smart, and, most importantly, be happy.
 I hope to meet you soon...
                         Peace and Love,
                                  ;-)     Julie Mae   ;-)   

P.S. Here's the Thought For The Day:

Hi!      I don't know if my letter earlier turned out the same way on your
screens as the way it got sent back to me from sfraves.  Anyways, there is a
HUGE (I mean HUGE) gap between my first paragraph and the next.  So my letter
seems to end with just that little note.  There was more to it and I'm hoping
that you guys scrolled down and came across it, but if you didn't happen to
notice that there were no Headers and stuff below my note and thought it was
finished, please read the rest...  Anyways, sorry to bother you if you did.
 And again, have fun tonight!   
                                     Much PLUR,

dear sfravers:

for those of you stuck in the walnut creek area there is a club on fridays
worth checking out.  it's called 'fusion' and it's at the 1220 club
at 1220 pine street, behind the 7-11.  house from 9pm-4am.  21+.
dj's raoul, pat allen + special guests.


i thought i might share something i found humorous from last week's
walnut creek journal, teen talk column.  the subject was "police are your
friends -- or not?"  

"Cops don't treat us fairly because it's hella not cool the way they be
yellin at us for being out past curfew or whatever.  They come up to 
us and try to kick us out of our own territory, you know.  It's hella messed
up.  They shouldn't do that to us.  I mean we're gonna be running the country
anyway, so they don't gotta be like buggin us".
- No Name, El Dorado Middle School

"Cops do treat teens fairly because, like, they're so nice to us.  When we're
walking down the street they'll like, stop the car and watch us walk and
talk to us.  Yeah, they're very fair".
- K., Carondelet High (a private girl's high school in Walnut Creek)

 i don't feel so good,


 Well, besides being completly bitched at and called a moron in front of
about 800 people (oh joy), I just recieved a phone call from Thomas
Trouble (I really should have gone out tonight). This is going to be long...


 In my posts concerning the bust of the last GT parties, I had mentioned
that rumor had that TT called the police. TT is _very_ upset by this,
especially as he is not online and cannot respond. In the interest of
fairness (and despite the fact I have to wake up for work in about 4
hours) I am posting TT's report on some of the situations surronding this
mess.

 TT had an argument with the russians (over DJ's) at the Karma 5 party.
There was some hot words but TT denies saying "I'm going to kill...". His
report is that the russians were upset and claimed they were going to
kick his ass and his response was "we'll see whose ass gets kicked"
(these words may be slightly off but not by much from what Tom said).

 His flat was robbed, he went to the warehouse and got most equipment
back confronting (and beating up) two of the russians. He was still
missing a CD burner. He talked with the parents of the two russians he
got his other equipment back from, and they were concerned about police
and their sons being deported.

 On Sunday the 26th (Jan.), TT drove up (to his flat?) and saw the other
two russians. He hurried to talk to them and to let them know everything
was all right. As he was talking to them he was struck several times and
he tried to defend himself but a knife was pulled out. They didn't stab
him once but 13 times. As he lay in a pool of blood, pretending to be
dead, the russians got in their car and tried to run over him. Despite a
knife wound in the neck to an artery he evaded the russians.

 He is getting stitches out on Sunday and will have lovely scars to show off.

 Tom swears that he did not call the police about the Stevenson
warehouse. He swears on his mum and family. In fact he says he will give
his sound system to anyone who can prove he called the police about
Stevenson. Tom says that two of the russians (Eugene and Max) are willing
to state that they believe Tom did not call the police. And that the
reason the police came was because a power cable (damn them cables) was
run to a neighboring warehouse which the police had checked earlier (that
day or the day before GT I believe TT said).

 For my part I believe I said that the info I heard concerning all this
was info told to me, rumors. However some people didn't see it that way
and told TT I was telling everyone that he was responsible for the bust.
If anyone can send me a copy of my posts concerning that it would be
greatly appreciated. I just want to see how much shoe needs to be
inserted into my mouth.


bye,

okay, i'm having a minor panic attack here... macadio is helping me out 
because i have to work until midnight tonight, and i know oddessy will 
be sold out by then, so he arranged to have a couple tickets at the 
door for me, rather than at the map point.. only thing is, we need 
directions to where it's really going to be... i don't know if he 
forgot that, or if he lost the voice mail number, but it's super 
important that we get these directions! soooo.. i have a HUGE favor to 
ask all the wonderful sfravers.... could someone, anyone 
pleeeeeaaaassseeee call with the directions once they get the map? 
there's two different numbers to call.. the first one is my pager, and 
it doesn't have voice mail, but if there's a way i could reach you 
(payphone that can recieve incoming calls, or maybe a cel/car phone) 
you could call that one.. it's 510 744 7407... or, just leave 
directions on my friend's voicemail, which is 510 440 4274... thanks in 
advance you guys, you don't know how much this means to us!!! i love 
you all and am crossing my fingers that i'll get to see a ton of you 
tonight!!

                                much love,
                                   anissa...

I have only been here for 2 weeks and recieved an email message from a 
fellow sfraver which totally disrespected me. I simply asked if there 
was anyone who had extra room if they were going to Odyssey and I got 
back a reply totally disrespecting me. I am new to Santa Cruz and do not 
know my way around so I thought someone could help me. Don't get me 
wrong there are many of you sfravers who responded with open arms which 
I am greatly appreciative of. But when someone for whatever reason 
responds to my post in a negative way it makes me wonder is this all 
this individual has to do is question my intelligence and waste his own 
time writing hate email to me. This individual needs to address his 
problem asap or his negative energy will cause more problems for them 
down the road. I am so pissed off. I am from Indiana and have been in 
the rave scene there since 1991. I go to raves to listen to the music 
not to be cool it seems that I have threaten or upset this person in a 
way that is very interesting. Maybe they saw their true fake self in my 
post. Sort of like how the homophobe is actually the homo. By simply 
asking for a ride I am assumed as a redneck wannabe from the mainstream 
who wants to be part of the crowd. I don't want to be part of anything 
and if this is how people are treated on the sfraves then I don't want 
to be part of this or the SF scene. I have been rejected from many 
people based on my physical appearance in my short stay. I have heard 
people call me a fag or he must be gay simply because I look a certain 
way (working out at gym). Has Santa Cruz or northern Cali. changed this 
much? I expect this from the Mary and Joe six pack back in Indiana but I 
thought the last place I would be disrespected is on sfraves or 
Northern California in general. I did not have the chance to make it to 
Odyssey but I am not giving up. I am sorry if this adds to the bullshit 
but I don't think I deserved any bad attitudes from anyone. I would do 
just about anything within reason for someone who is geniune and needs 
my help but for the liquid(shit)who sent me vicious email I can't wait 
till I find out who you really are so I can stay away from your negative 
blackhole of a mouth. I feel better now.

P.S. You negative ravers keep your dirty email amongst yourselves.

I become very suspicious when anyone makes a moral pronouncement along
the lines of "Oh, you _ought_ to do this" or "No one should _ever_ do
that", or even "Everyone should do this" -- especially when the person
holding the opinion isn't required to do something beacuse of that
pronouncement.

Classic examples include "No one should ever have an abortion", often
spouted by 1) males and 2) happily married (and often no longer fertile)
older couples to whom it will never be an issue.

Ditto "Isn't that war in Bosnia horrible?", or "They should just put all
those gang kids in jail", or "Isn't violence horrible?", ... the list
goes on and on.

These tend to be what I call a "No-Cost Moral Judgment".  It wouldn't
cost me anything, as a male, to say I am against abortion.  It wouldn't
cost me anything, as a white guy with long hair, to make sanctimonious
pronouncements about "gangbangers".  It wouldn't cost me anything, as a
privileged white male with good income, to decry violence when I am not
in a position where violence or its threat is required for survival. 
And it doesn't even cost me anything to say I am against tropical
deforestation if I keep eating McDeathburgers and not recycling my
trash.

Making such a statement is simple ego-inflation.  It is saying "See how
nice and enlightened I am to know the truth in this situation?"  It
serves no other purpose.

So when I see pronouncements like:

> You are repeating rumors, and making judgements based on those rumors. A
> person, a *human being*, is lying in the hospital. *THAT* is fact. *THAT*
> is what matters.
> 
> There is no excuse for this. Period.
[snip] 
> Save your hypocrisy. Your lack of compassion and valuation of human life
> is pretty damn clear.

I think "Hmmm.  No-cost moral judgment."

There are a lot of other facts that you have chosen to discount because
you don't know them.  Probably no one ever will.  Therefore, I will
restrain myself from saying anything one way or the other, because I
can't add anything informed to the discussion.

I won't go to that space, either, but that's because of how unsafe
everyone has said it is.  Moot point for me either way.

  Fox did not write the storyline for this episode.  Fox did not produce 
this episode.  This does not show any agenda fox has about raves.
  Did you see the episode about how dangerous acid can be?
  If you want to see a recent misleading bit of media, the AP report 
about a 19 year old PA boy recently shot by police - the implication was 
that the music he listened to led him to use drugs, which in turn led to 
him resisting arrest, which led to him getting shot fatally.  

> blacklights, lazers, people dancing with glow toys, Adidas gear

  Anyway, knowing CC's work, I'd assume he did this in order to use an 
interesting set(ting).  Perhaps the K thing is based on those guys who 
used it to rape women.  He occasionally takes small factual bits then 
expands and modifies them into shows.  I don't suspect most ordinary 
people will read into it too much.

  On an unrelated note.  Those new TV ratings.  Now, if NYPD Blue and 
Millenium don't deserve the M(ature) rating, what does?

We're not all like that...
leave those negative "evil-raver" types to play with themselves and
we'll have a good time vibe'n together.  I sorry about the poor
reception you received, hopefully as you get to meet more Mid-coast and
Bay Area ravers you'll appreciate the fact that we've got a few
"blackhearts" roamin' around looking to do the dirty because they have
to exist in order for all of us love-happy party fanatics to be
concentrated in such a comparably small area. <whew!>

Hey people!  I have a similar problem as Anissa (sk8erree) with Odyssey
tonight.  I'm on Macadio's guest list (well the $10 one at least) and I told
him yesterday that I'd be there with bells on.  The problem is... I'm in
Sonora right now and I'm about to make the drive to SF, but I know I won't
get to the mappoint in time since I have to make a stop in Pinole on the way
and it's already getting late...  So, if anybody finds out where the actual
party is, please leave me a voice-mail at (415) 253-2568.  I'd greatly
appreciate it.  Thanks so much in advance....
                               Peace, love, and happiness,
                                                     Julie Mae

And you should be suspicious. I guess the important thing is to know if
the person making such pronouncments actually lives by their words in
order to make a value judgement.

It is a simple matter to take comments out of context and then make
sweeping generalizations about them, isn't it?

There is no excuse for physical violence as a result of words. It happens
every day, yes. It is the same type of logic that defendants in rape cases
use: "Well, did you see the way she was dressed? She was asking for it." I
do not see the reason in this type of logic at all. I do not think it is
right. Actually, I think it is a pretty horrible.  

It may be as you say a "no-cost moral judgement." Cool, I just saved
myself 2 cents.

well what can i say folks......a great party.  cool spot with space to sit down
if you could get around to it.

i could be found grooving most fasstidiously during the sets of carlos and spun
although i had to catch my breath from time to time.

although i still don't quite understand circle dancing (no disrespect i'm from
an earlier era) i had a great time. hope i didn't bug anyone by bumping my
booty.  it was nice and warm on the dance floor like i like it.  the vibe was
definately alive, but there were some non-believers so i had to turn to my
fellow neighbor and give a big fat smile and you know what? people were like
grinnin'.  i had to call it quits at 4:15 cause of an early wake-up call for
the thing i do during the day called work.

it's clubs/parties like that that make me wanna keep going to parties/clubs
like that..........

this was copied from a post i received today, sorry if you take offence
to the capital letters, but it is perhaps something that needs to be
yelled... loud and clear...



WE NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE....
EVERTHING.
WE ARE TIRED OF BEING TIRED
WE KNOW WHAT REALITY IS NOT THE SAME AS WE USED TO THINK ABOUT IT...IT
IS MALUABLE.

I DON'T WANT TO PERISH IN SOME WAR BROUGHT ON BY STUPID CONSUMERS BUYING
UP RESOURCES TRYING TO FIND TRUTH IN A BIG MAC...

I'VE HAD VISIONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME TO TEARS, DYING..ECSTASY...ETC
I WANT THESE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCES AND FRIENDS TO GROW AND REALIZE
THEMSELVES IN WAYS THEY DON'T YET REMEMBER ARE POSSIBLE.

AS MUCH AS YOU MAY THINK I'M FULL OF SHIT...
I'VE SEEN MANY FUTURES...THE ONE THAT WE MAY GET -WILL SUCK, BIG TIME.
ON THE OTHER HAND...THE BEST ONE I'VE SEEN...MAKES CELESTINE PROPHESIES
LOOK LIKE A BAD DAY AT WORK. 

NETWORKING IS THE HAND THAT TURNS THE KEY AND THE KEY IS LOVE.
LOVE FOR YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND ENVIRONMENT, LOVE FOR YOUR FRIENDS,
AND LOVE FOR JUST BEING ALIVE...

WHAT DO I DO? I'M JUST ONE PERSON....
WELL GET OVER IT...ONE PERSON ONE VOTE AND ONE E-MAIL LIST THAT CAN SEND
STUFF ALL OVER THE WORLD...GET IT YET?!
WHETHER YOU'RE E-MAILING OR TALKING OR DOING.

FIND WHAT WORK YOU REALLY LOVE DOING...TRADE IT FOR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
WILL OFFER YOU. WHEN YOU LOVE SOMETHING ALOT IT BECOMES MAGICAL AND YOUR
ABILITY TO DO IT BETTER WILL MAKE YOU MORE VALUABLE TO OTHERS.AND YOU
WON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY PAY OR TRADE WITH YOU FOR YOUR
STUFF!!!!

WE ARE THE FUTURE OF THIS PLANET EITHER YOU'RE 6 FEET UNDER OR BUILDING
A NEW WAY OF INTERACTING WITH THIS STUFF CALLED REALITY...YOU'RE IT!

ALL THESE E-MAILS I'VE SENT YOU ARE TO BE READ AND SENT TO OTHERS. YOU
CAN ADD TO THEM IF YOU WISH. BUT REMEMBER...DO WHAT YOU LOVE...THAT IS
SYNERGY NOT COMPROMISE OR SACRIFICE. WE WANT YOUR STRENGTH.

WHO'S WE? YOU, ME ANYBODY WHO'S INTERESTED IN RED LINING PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE AND BELIEVE IN FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, RESPECT, PLAY AND LIFE.

THIS IS A CULTURAL VIRUS. THE INTENT IS CLEAR:
THROUGH THE RE-ORGANIZATION OF BEING IN A PARALLEL NETWORK SYSTEM OF
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, WE CAN GROW, DIVERSIFY AND EXPAND OUR ABILITIES,
PEACE OF MIND AND SAVE OURSELVES FORM OUR OWN STUPIDITY.

YOU CAN KILL THIS VIRUS IF YOU WISH BY NOT PARTICIPATING IN IT.

BUT BEFORE DOING SO...IN THE END... DO YOU REAlLY BELIEVE THAT
GOVERNMENT AS WE HAVE SEEN IT... SUPPORTS YOU?... OR SUPPORTS CORPORATE
POWER BROKERS, ABSTRACT FINANCIAL PROFITS AND WASTE.

DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ENGINE THAT RUNS ON WATER? 
IT USES ELECTRICITY TO SPLIT WATER INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN... THEY ARE
THEN RECOMBINED IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND GIVE OFF STEAM AS EXHAUST.

IMAGINE EACH HOUSEHOLD WITH IT'S OWN INDEPENDENT POWER and vehicle THAT
USES A NATURAL RENEWABLE RESOURCE AND GIVES OFF AN EXHAUST YOU CAN
DRINK?

THIS AIN'T BULLSHIT...CHECK IT OUT ... we are being manipulated: TO KEEP
CORPORATE STRUCTURES IN CONTROL AND MAKE MONEY.

EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT EXCEPT PEOPLE WHO MANIPULATE FOR SELFISH
GROTESQUE GAIN AT THE COST OF PEOPLE AND THE PLANET. 

IF YOU WANT A DIFFERENT FUTURE, START THE VIRUS-IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM.

NOT CAPITALISM SOCIALISM OR FASCISM. IT'S ABOUT LIFE.



another quote perhaps relevant is age-old Roman emperor Marcus Aerulius

"WASTE NO TIME ARGUING WHAT A GOOD MAN SHOULD BE, BE ONE!"



political bantering is a waste of time... whether it's about violence,
thoughts on violence, language or who stole the cable...

we have found ourselves in the midst of a culture, who for the first
time in ages, was seemingly pushing itself forward through mutual
support and respect...  are we now bursting at the seems with ego,
hostility and competition...?

the key is throwing the rule-book away and getting on with life, not
getting caught up in the semantics of the game...

peace and love, light and life...

yeah, all that hippie shit...

anyways, i agree, things seem a little 'hairy', especially reading this
list the last couple weeks.  1997 has brought some bad vibes, starting with
all the busts and such...  i think everyone needs to drop a hit and think
things out a little.  i think the problems really come down to greed,
people can make a quick (untaxed) buck by throwing together a party, not
worrying about permits, safety, health, toilet paper, ventilation,....and
have a venue to peddle some drugs (in my experience, usually inferior or
worse).
after almost 4 years, i definitly feel like a vet, and all this talk about
unity is very transitory.  it's rare to meet someone more than twice, and
promotors and djs come and go.  the unity generally lasts a few hours.  But,
those few hours can really change peoples lifes.
what this scene needs is one (or a small group) of dedicated promoters to
get it together and get the required permitted space and do it right.  they
could still keep it pretty underground in their methods of promoting, make
a few bucks, and do everyone a favor.  maybe we should call Steve Jobs up?
the nature of SF (imho) is very flaky, and 'the rave scene' reflects this
well.  i've met *hundreds* if not a 1000 people here, and maybe 5 i can call
'friends' at this point, and i'm not a bad dude, really.
maybe we could be friends??

Ran- i think you a swell guy and all, i can tell you mean well, really.
don't get mad at me for asking, but, since you post a lot, would you consider
shortening/dropping the long attachment you always add to your messages?  i
just don't feel advertising on sfraves 10x/day is that cool, is all.  plus
"bandwidth" and most people have a quota on their email accounts.
btw-personally i hope that TT lays low for a while since his name (Trouble)
definitely seems to be some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, and lord-knows
we don't need any more of it.
Peace,

yes, i would have to agree that a lot of people are greedy really without 
knowing it.  but i always try to look at it from their perspective, 
because if we are to actually enact any kind of change, we must first 
understand the promoter's point of view, without bias, as well as the 
partygoers point of view.  

That's for each of us to decide in our own minds what those points of 
view are for at least a day before posting on SFR what our answers are.  
Here's why:

We all need to learn to listen to each other.  You see, a lot of us think 
we listen to people, but what actually happens is we just take turns 
talking.  This especially happens in live conversation.  We live in a 
society where people are attention starved and RECOGNITION starved.  Try 
this sometime.  Instead of waiting for a hole to pop up so we can insert 
our comments in a conversation with someone (this could be on or off the 
list, it doesn't matter), listen to everything they say, you'll notice 
they'll run out of things to say on their own, nod attentively, smile a 
little bit while nodding a little bit, take mental note of what they have 
to say, acknowledge their point of view, and be excited for them.  

Of course, this is basic for a lot of people's programming.  But there 
are a lot of people stuck.  Some of us might be reading this post right 
now thinking "he's full of baloney" or "well this might work for some 
people, but personally i'm above all this personal growth stuff" If this 
is true, we may have more to gain from reading this post over and over 
again than those not reviewing their ego-based "I understand everything", 
also known as the "know it all" program.  

Egos serve a purpose.  They are like a shield we use to protect our true, 
sensitive selves.  But it can also cut us off from sharing appreciation, 
recognition, and general love for each other.  It sometimes causes us to 
misinterpret points of view based on lack of information due to lack of 
listening and start a negative chain reaction.  

more later.  tired.

Most of the retailers in the bay area are selling the Pioneer gear for way
too much. I got mine back in April 96 (prices might be different now):
	* CDJ-500mkII	(CD deck -- $599.99 ea) 
	* M-500		(mixer -- $799.99 ea)

I got it via mail order from NY at J&R Music and Computer World
1-800-221-8180. In addition to the very good prices on most equipment,
you save on 8.25% sales tax, but you have to pay 3% shipping/insurance.

Anybody buying computer/software/audio/photo/video/lighting/home-electronics
should check these guys out -- call the number above and have them send
you a catalog. They'll definitely save you some $$ on big ticket items.
Also, on many items, they're willing to haggle over prices -- try it
and see if you can get them to come down a few more percent.
Unfortunately other than the pioneer equipment, all they sell for
club/dj audio is Gemini/Numark/Carver, which we all know is crap.

Hmm, from the sound of it, it seems SF has a Peter Gatien dilemma on their
hands.  For those who don't know, Peter Gatien was a big New York City club
promoter who ran clubs like the Limelight, the home of the Wednesday night
Disco2000 which made DJ Keoki ever so (in)famous.  Plus I believe he ran
several nights at the re-opened Tunnel.  Anyway to make a short story even
shorter, he decided that the fame and fortune of being one of the central
people behind the Club Kid scene in NY wasn't enough for him.  As it turns
out he was running a fairly organized drug dealing operation.  He'd have the
door people at his clubs selectively bust the dealers going in that weren't
selling his drugs for him.  Well, NYPD finally got him on it and he's now in
jail.  The bust came around some murder charge that one of his underlings
got themselves into.  The kid narked on Peter Gatien in attempts to get
himself off of the murder charge.  Well, unfortunately for the kid, the
murder charge and the drug trafficking charge are completely unrelated
legally and NYPD got their murderer AND Peter Gatien!

I'm sorry to hear Thomas Trouble has been injured.  I hope he gets well
soon.  In my eyes, nobody ever deserves to be physically harmed for any reason.

hi Chris

I am From Santa Cruz and now mostly live in S.F. I think people in S.C.
suck even though it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. I love
the people in S.F. Partying in Santa Cruz is scary sometimes, and
homophobia is rampant. However there are good people mingled in with all
the crap down there. 

It's not you.

He all!

Last night a couple of friends of mind through this party Clearspace here 
in san Luis Obisbo.  I would say it was the biggest party i've seen here 
in this area.  Approx 800 ppl.  The space was a ware house in Paso Robles 
fairgrounds.  I'm stll tired from that party and studing all day today so 
sorry if i seem blunt.  
     The space had a 2200 cappacity so it looked small but it was very 
fun, for as long as it lasted...   The chill space by sputnik was cool 
and very one was very cool and happy.  Dj dan and "freaky chakra"  were 
not able to come but they posted that tomas michael and simply jeff 
aggred to spin too.  i missed the first dj probably Diego-v ( a 
local/promoter) went first.  Then Radley marx came next and got the crowd 
pumpin'.  I couldn't stop dancing, i need to work out all my tentions 
after mid-terms friday.  Everyone was dancing, I was very iimpressed on 
how many people I met from LA and SF that came down for the party, they 
were all great people.  I'm sorry though that it got broken up.
    Trance went after Radley and started off slow, a little too much 
trippy trip hop to dance to and moved more into his usual funky trance.  
An hour or so into his set (3.00am)  paso robles police came in and shut 
the party down.  They were getting noise complants all night since 11.00 
pm and said they couldn't let the party go on.  What I thought was really 
cool was that one of the officers got on a mic gave a small speech about 
the party and scene in general.  The made it clear that they would have 
kept the party going had nobody complained.  There was no violence and 
eveery one was very positive and they approved of the way the party was 
handled.  Everyone in the building started cheering and clapping.  YEAH!
	Well a few people in slow offered many people back to their 
houses to crash or continue parting.  Skark-e had MANY MANY people come 
by as well as a few other friends of mine had house parties till dawn. 
 The promoters are supposted to throw a free after party tonight but I got too
 much stuff to do tomorrow (more mid-terms - ahh!)  The only negative 
thing I heard last night was that m friend Josh got his back pack stolen. 
(Claire.  Did Josh ever find it?  Let me know.  i'm glad you had fun in LA!)
There are more smaller parties planed for the future and I hope we can 
create something numinious and fun down here.  (I love that word).
Peace all-


PLUR,

       Austin

Hey so like last night night I did it again! I raved sober. IT was great.
I think I rave better sober  and have more fun, I meet more people and
 make more friends.Pretty good so far right? So I want to rave sober 
more often but around 2 or 3in the morning I run out of steam.  Does 
anyone have any good healty suggestions on how I can keep my 
energy and vibe going past 3:00 am without drugs? Somebody send me
a magic recipe please.

Peace out, James

My packpack mysteriously disapeared last night at Koinonea, stolen/moved or 
otherwise.  If anyone happened to find a blue small backpack with only food 
(pretzels, blue water bottle, banana) and a maroon long-sleeved tee in it and 
"M. Anderson" written on a strap, it could be mine so please let me know.

thank you,

I think it has alot to do with where techno is today vs. where it was in
the mid 80's. I think that there always has been a dance culture in
African-American history (one thing that NOBODY could take away).  But I
think that 140bpm and above is not really danceable, and danceability is
crucial to acceptance IMO.  Just a possibility.

I think hi-nrg music appeals to Latino/Chicano's because it's rhythm
structures are based on a latin rhythm subtext.  Ramp it up a few BPM's and
you may well exclude many african's from catching a groove.  Besides the
fact I think it may be still seen as too latin rhythm oriented and thus the
avoidance (yep, we as a country are really screwed in this sense.  got
brown against brown, the man has achieved the ultimate).

Faux Pas here Uncle.  There is a tendency (I was guilty as well at one
point), of grouping all people of African descent together.  The
experiences of Africans in england are far different than those of Africans
in America.  Same for Africans in teh Carribiean, and Africans in Africa.
Each group is linked by a common bond, thier African genetics, but then it
diverges from there.  There are Billions of blacks that have no slave
ancestors, there are blacks who did not undergo the persecution that
Africans in America faced.  Same for my carribiean brothers and sisters.
We all have different politicial and social realities.  Goldy may well
resonate in Brixton, but may fall on deaf ears in the Bronx.  Same for
Tricky.  Hey I like those guys, and believe they are creative and love
their music, but NWA or Jungle Brothers, or Pharcyde resonate with me much
more than anything that comes over the Atlantic (except for Fela, King
Sunny Ade, etc.).  Things lost in translation?  I dunno.  I think Jungle
has a disticnt chance of bridging that gap.

I think it's endemic of the problem overall.  There is a basic lack of
understanding.  People don't understand why I could be so upset at the word
gangstah and then ask "Gee, WHY aren't there any blacks at this party?".  I
think being sensitive to other peoples reality is a start.  Making the
music accessible (in many ways, BPM referenced) is another.  Bringing in
the hip-hop contingent is another, something that has been avoided here in
the bay area.

There is plenty that can be done, for those with the courage to do it.

FLAVA '97.

Peace,
John

I went to my first ever rave on New Year's Eve completely straight.  I
think I enjoyed it much more than I would have if I had dropped anything.

Anyway, if you're running out of steam at 3am, there's always caffeine.
If you're averse to that, try an Odwalla honey lemonade or Serious Ginseng;
They always give me a nice little buzz, although I'm not sure I could dance
'till dawn under fruit juice power alone.  You'll have to ask others
about Ma Huang and its ephedra cousins...

	About 10:30 or 11 pm before/during a rave I generally have a 
smoothie containing about 50g of protein from various supplements 
(egg, whey, soy, <no meat, but I'm no vegan either>), 5g of synthetic
creatine monohydrate (important nutrient naturally found *only* 
in red meat that is an important factor in your ability to 
store energy in your muscles - basically all pro athletes use this 
supplement these days), 1.5g of vitamin C. I throw in some OJ and a 
bunch of fresh fruit (strawberries, blueberries, bananas depending on 
the season). Usually take some vitamins at this time also - B complex 
or niacin for sure, maybe some calcium, zinc, and/or E (the vitamin!)
as well. It's not difficult for me to stay up dancing all nite.

	This isn't a cheap drink, but it's cheaper than a hit of E 
(the drug!), I think anyway - one of my studio clients tells me that E
goes for $20 a hit these days - is that right? Jeez...


	I also have a regular program of exercise that includes 
aerobics & weight training. I don't really know how much good 
the supplement alone will do, but I doubt anyone could sleep for 
at least four hours after one of these things. The fructose kicks 
in right away, and by the time that's gone you're burning the protein 
for energy if you're dancing.

	I'm a coffee drinker, but coffee before a rave doesn't
work for me. I find that the caffiene crash 4-5 hours later will
drain my energy for the rave every time. On the other hand, 
a little Chai after 1am or so can help ...

Congrats! I've been noticing more and more reports similar to yours.

Well, I've noticed that eating a lot of fruit throughout the party
keeps me awake and energetic for the entire night (and also helps my
sleep more refreshing). Starting the night with a protein-powder laden
fruit smoothie also helps prepare your body for a long night of
dancing.

Another thing that helps is taking a half hour or an hour cat nap at
some point during the night. I don't always do this, but when I do,
I'm usually okay to dance until about 9 or 10 the next morning.

Another suggestion is to use your breaktime (ie. resting from dancing)
to rest your legs and re-hydrate, but avoid sitting on the floor and
slowly easing into comfort-land. You'll find that by forcing your
breaks to be productive (ie. stretching your muscles and drinking some
water), it will keep you from settling into a comfy corner and losing
all inspiration to keep moving.

And if all else fails, look for the Nub! Chai has the wonderful effect
of loosening your body and clearing your mind (great for dancing) while
providing you with that special caffeine boost (great for keeping awake).
A cup of Chai really goes a long way.

Hope this helps, and good luck.

from your favorite happy sober raver,
Steve

An awe-struck THANK YOU to Koinonea for that beautiful, beautiful party 
last night.  _Clean_ space, amazing artwork everywhere, Chai tea hut 
(ummm!), bananas-and-oranges just when I needed them, many grooving 
drummers, a random flutist, people melting on massage tables, the dance 
floor pounding all night with the boundless soul-energy of goa trance, and 
even a breathtaking contortionist, gracefully bending to the music like a 
moving meditation.  And of course, all the people...

It was rejuevenation to me.  Last I danced was two weeks ago, but somehow 
it felt like it had been too long, and the night passed in a daze and I 
came out of it wrung through with sweat and exhaustion...a 4-hour 
work-out in a sauna...a deep body experience to restore me to myself. 

Sober raving meant our night ended when our bodies could go on no more, 
around 4AM.  But this time I actually _remember_ the names of those I 
met, and, though the sober experience is different, it is just as fulfilling.

Til next time!
Love,
n

Regarding sober raving,

While in London over the summer I became fond of the new boom in "energy
drinks" such as Red Bull (Virgin had a brand but I can't remember what they
called it) and there were numerous others. Caffeine was a major ingredient,
but there were others that made it nicer than coffee or Jolt or Mtn Dew.
These soft drinks were quite popular at clubs and helped to go all night when
avoiding other substances. They took off so well there (even sold in 6packs
at supermarkets) I'm surprised they haven't made their way over here yet,
especially since the bars have to stop the alcohol at 2AM - these cans of
soft drinks helped  in the revenue dept as well.

Sure, I sometimes wonder how many around me are dancing sober or on E -
not that it's a huge deal. Last night at Koinonea (which was simply
amazing!) I had a rare glimpse into a *statistic* of sorts.

While I was dancing, a young woman came up to me, with a smile and a warm
touch of reassurance, and asked "Are you on Ecstacy?" After I answered
her, she went on to the person dancing next to me and asked the same
question in the same way. I saw him shake his head no, returning her 
smile. I was curious why she was asking the question, of course, but I
became even more interested in what kind of answers she was getting. 

So after about the fifth person, I simply asked her this, with the same
smile and touch of reassurance. She dismissed my question by moving on to
the next person, which was fine (although I admit that I was intrigued
by her mission, whatever it was). 

But I was even more curious about the responses she was getting, so I
watched her rounds, as she asked almost everyone in the room. The yes or
no answers were fairly clear from the nods and head-shakes, without having
to hear their words. I counted three affirmatives and about fifteen
negatives before I lost her in the crowd.

>From the vibe of the Koinonea crowd, I would have guessed that same 5-1
ratio (yeah yeah, I know this isn't a very accurate poll), although those
who believe the current media hype about DRUGS AT RAVES probably would be
surprised that *everyone* there wasn't on E.

For those of you who care, I am sooo psyched to be moving out there!

I know you all have problems with the scene, but this past friday guess
what happenned to me: I was at this really *nice* party Dan Efex record
release party "RELEASED". It was a very positive party and all around good
time. Until around 4:30a, when I was at the smart bar talking with the
smart drink guy and this security guard (cop?) handcuffed me and took both
of us to the store front next door. There, these three guys grilled us and
took all of our stuff. They proceeded to negotiate "bond" money. I told
them I only had $60 until next Friday, so they asked for $30. I gave them
$40, they gave me change. Then they gave me ALL [;)] of my stuff back
(except my bowl and an e) which they kept. Odd, one of the DJs (I won't
name publicly) was hanging out with these crooks.

The good peeps here in Chicago (like Dan and some others) are working to
straighen all of this out. I think it's FUBAR. I posted that I boycott
Chicago parties, from now on. I will only go to little and/or smaller town
parties. :D

Goin' to California,
 m

protein is verry good for our bodies because it builds muscle and burns 
fat as well as slowing down the absorption of sugar.  

though, people that get sluggishly tired all the time could be mineral 
deficient...it's not in our fruits and veggies anymore, unless you get 
organic, and even then it's questionable...

i'm not a doctor or this health wizard, but i have had the oppty to hang 
out with people a lot smarter than me, so i'm just passing some of this 
on.

say no prob randream.  might i say good of you to recognize me.  feels 
even better than that nubchai stuff!  i actually would like to take the 
time to acknowledge the SFR people in general, because when i logged back 
on about 6 months ago as TGARCI02@harris.com, it seemed there was more 
bickering.  it seems that we have been successful in keeping that off the 
list to the most part.  remember, it's not how many times you strike out 
that counts, it's what your batting average is at the end of the season.  
RESULTS!  

keep up the good work randy, maybe we'll get to work together again in 
the future.  seeyas!  deep

first off, i totally have to thank macadio.. you tore it up! i didn't 
introduce myself (i'm sorry, but when i saw you after you spun you were 
talking to a bunch of people).. anyways, i was the girl dancing right 
in front of you for most of your set... i had on the 101 dalmation 
backpack and navy track pants with white stripes and a white shirt.... 
and my hair was in two buns.. anyways, that was definitely a pretty 
cool party, i must say... it's too bad about donald glaude, but kexa =) 
definitely made up for it.. where are you spining next? anyway, it was 
pretty positive for most of the night, but towards the end, i was 
getting this really bad vibe... does anyone know what happened to that 
girl who was freaking out? okay, i'm still tired, so i'm going to 
sleep.. see you next weekend everyone!

                                  much love,
                                     anissa...

some types of protiens also mask histone protiens which prevents us from
accessing genetic consciousness...  perhaps less meat-based protiens and
a diet that seeks to eliminate sugar would be a healthier suggestion, if
you've the discipline... sugar is in everything!  the
redmeat/alchohol/sugar diet is something terrence mckenna has a lot to
say about in his book "food of the gods"

yes it is, but much of our produce (commercial produce) isn't
healthy...  the key is to get organic... growing food yourself is like
raising a child that you're going to eat... if you treat it with neglect
or take it for granted, you're not going to have a healthy offspring... 
this probably isn't coming out the way i want it to, so i'll refer you
to the celestine prohpecy by what's-his-name new-age guy..  i forget...

new sfrave gossip will have thomas trouble packing a bazooka and the
alchemist is a cannibal who eats his own kids...  

its been a late night, which hasnt stopped since yesterday...

One last thing about this 20/20 thing (from me anyways). I watched the show
this Friday to see if maybe they would comment on our response to their show. 
Well, no response from what I saw, but John Stossel (is that his name?)
reported on prostitution and the benefits of legalizing it.

Boy, was he ever excited about his report. 

Not to mention all for the legalization of it.

Even though I am against prostitution, it is whoever is doing it's own body.

I just don't understand 20/20 projection of morality?

Pro-Prostitution / Anti-Rave ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

from all of us at 20/20 to all of you...

We hope you partied your fucking asses of this weekend!!!!!

-much love, and good night
-justin

          Hello to All


          Hi I'm James I was lurking around here for the last five weeks or
so reading just about everything.  The coolest thing I've noticed about it
was that you all try to keep that vibe alive.  Anyways on to bisness, sorry
but it's late and I'm tired.  I've been involved in the scene for about 2.5 -
3 years and was helping promote and throw NEXUS parties for allmost a year.
 I'm about 6'4" with brown hair and green eye's.  I think some of you might
know me, I'm sure Peter does(I have justins number if you want it).  

          My thoughts on the 20/20 issue is that I would like to set up an
information station at Love Affair.  It's purpose would be to educate those
attracted to the scene by the massive's and hopefully blunt some of the
impact of the 14 - ?? rush that I believe might be there.  I haven't got a
chance of doing this alone.  Anyone who feels this is something that's a good
Idea, please send any thoughts to Jim Coch@aol.com (this adress may change
shortly).  

             ok the important message is above now's the time to let go and
see what happens.   my personal veiw is that the scene is about  PLUR.  that
is a simple statement though and it mean's alot more then is really apparent.
 like peace  sure it means world peace and peace in the streets but it also
means peace within and without of yourself.  That's off the top of my head,
 think of what would happen if I put some thought into it wait I've been
doing that for years :)  anyways the interprtations are only relitive to
those who see them for themselves.  I want to promote a party I'm gonna try
for the 29th of march  it's a saterday night and if it's not it will be moved
to the date of the last saterday in the month of march.   I've been trying to
tie down an outdoor location with indoor space for 500.  a friend of a friend
might do it but who knows.  i've been stareing at the screen for a couple of
minutes  seems my brain want's to stop or something. gotta wake up for school


night 

          -James

We have some ex-Chicago promoters out here that have been suspected of
quite a few unfavorable things.

That "Chicago" style rave promotion that's happening out here is the 'grit'
at the bottom of San Francisco's rave cup, I must say.

OK there's no way I have time to rewrite what's bellow it's vage and full of
tangents but I needed to get it out and I could use some help so if you can
acctualy read through it and then by some miricale understand what I think I
was saying then please e-mail me at Jim Coch@aol.com and I'll answer any
questions you ask but would rather get your opinion on what you think I might
have missed or possiable problems you think might come up.

For those who don't have the time or the inclination to scroll down to the
end

HI I'm James I've been around the scene for about 3 years and I've been
reading the list since late dec early jan.  I've got some crazy Ideas (one or
two are hiddin in the chaos below) and at least 2 or 3 dreams I still belive
in
going to intoxication tonight see you there I'm about 6'4" with brown hair
fairly skinny about 185-190 and  I have a mustache and gotee and I used to
help setup nexus partys ( 2nd chakra, open, multiple chill rooms) anyways
gotta go 

P.L.U.R.A.L

PEACE, LOVE, UNITY, RESPECT, ACCEPTANCE, LOVE (YOU CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH LOVE)

James
\





in advance I'd like to apoligize for any typos, or gramatical errors that
will soon follow but I need to vent so I'm just gonna let go. And hey it's
probably about time that I said "HI !" and introduced myself.  I'm James
those of you on here that have gone to a few massives might know me or some
of you longer term members might recognize me to I've been into raveing for
aproxamatly 3 years and I'm trying to figure out how to educate a massive
especcialy with the expected influx of newbies (a la 20/20) in the 14- ??
range I expect this to really show at love affiar.  a majority of these are
going to be so utterly cluless about whats going on ( Mainly refering to thug
or at least that's where >I< think the problem arises) that it would be a
good Idea to set up an information service I've been on this list for allmost
a month now and I read every message and really like the bent of your beliefs
so I ask for help the information booth will be run by me in the 2 wks.
aprox. that I have I'd like you all to talk to your friends and pass the word
on about the booth and encourage any newbies to stop by  I'm thinking of
calling it 
are ya ready ;)

                                    JUST SAY KNOW

I'm gonna have my friend do a  grafatti art style banner with the letters
being drawn so that they resemble a large varity of drugs in those colors
that we all know and love sooooo muuuuchhhh under those darklights. so I'll
be hard to miss.  I'd like on a longer term to start a political movement not
to leagalize drug use but instead to regulate those who sell them by
licenceing them and enforceing strict education standards for these people
these people then would have the legal right to sell drugs to any legal adult
or to an adolesent or a child if precribed by a doctor, shrink or apropriate
responsable athority ( I feel I must state that I don't consider our Current
goverment to be responsable athority) i can't see any deeper then that right
now.  what I'd like to do now is to collect some samples from your friends
and with your assurance that they will honor the agreement I'll get it tested
at a lab and then I'll return to you a laminated card designed indiviualy for
him or her with all the appropreate(sp?) information and then have enlarged
posters of those cards in my booth as well as all the ACCURATE INFORMATION
that I can obtain and duplicate in time thus getting the newbies to stop by
and finding out what there in for and hopefully avoiding the complications of
new years cool world health fiasco.  I truly believe our scene is in need of
something like this at least at the massives cause it's to large and we can't
know everyone around us and that's hurting the vibe more then anything else
cause you then have distrust those around you at least a bit or inevitably
you end up getting something stolen bunked or just plain used by the way
those 3 things should be looked at IMHO as educational opertunities,  most
theives I've encountered have had a lack of respect for themselves so how can
we expect them to respect us or our property, they are under the normal
conditions of a party :)  rather easy to spot (i'm generizing I know but it's
gotta get out and I cant stop to order it out right)  and inevitably someone
gets hurt Vlad's won my respect on this in that he has prepared for these
eventualitys but he's agravating in that he dosn't seem to try to provide
education as a means of averting problems

I don't think anyone out their thinks this but I want to make it clear that
the purpose of the booth would not be to discourage drug use or encorage it
but simply inform those that ask what I've been told and believe to be
reliable for that to be worth a Shit though I'll need help gathering it all
and cross referenceing it and probably most importantly love not for anyone
in particular or even someone you know show it by teaching what you know to
those new and around you at this event if you can't connect to them on a
personal level then send them to the booth.  the beauty is that you really
don't have to work you just have to care I'll be accepting any help I can use

at this point though I could use some advice and some factual answers on a
few legal issues so that when I try and convince vlad to let me do this I
have the answers to some really obvious questions.


for the few the brave the truly bored that acctualy got this far my
appreation and my thanks especially if you would e-mail me with any
suggestions you might have.

A good sized nap before you go out helps a great deal, I find. And
depending on what you consider drug free, something with caffine to take
later can be good. And it helps to keep 420 just for 420. That always
puts me right to sleep.

Hmmmm... that reminds me, has anyone ever tried out thoes 'Herbal E'
thingies? Are they worth it at all?

1) yes a long time ago.

Get enough sleep right before the party.  Whenever I plan rave sober I
usually stay up the night before then sleep the whole day before the party
and I take lots of vitamins and drink lots of sports drinks.   There is a
kind of bottled water in the market called Water Joes and it's caffiene
water.  It contains caffiene but tastes like water.  You should try this.

1) money

2) accessiblity

Raves appeal to young, suburban rebellion.  Usually suburban means white.
In order to go to raves you need 1-cash and 2-time.  This is usually
where youth come in who, being supported by their parents, are in a
unique experience similar to the bourgeoisie. When you don't
have a lot of money or have to work your ass off to pay the bills, raving
becomes quite the luxury, especially at $20 a pop (excluding your average
pharmocopia).

Raving may have been started by the AFrican American community, but it is
now dominated by the people who can afford it.

I'd have to say that I am at my very best when I am in really good shape.
If I am exercising about 3 times a week I have tons and tons of energy.  I
danced hard one night until 6 a.m. feeling like this.  It felt great.
However, when I don't exercise I feel especially crappy and have no extra
energy to spare.  The difference is amazing.

that's good and observant observation, but if we want to clean up the 
rave scene and get rid of the scumbuckets, instead of concentrating on 
what we're doing wrong, why not concentrate on what we're doing right and 
try to duplicate that?  make sense?  success in anything is way way 
easier when we find out what everyone else is doing and do the exact 
OPPOSITE.  everyone else (especially people and news shows that don't 
even contribute to our scene) is taking a toothpick and a magnifying 
glass to find out what's wrong with us.  NOTHING  is wrong with us.  
We're just a group of happy-go-lucky bouncy people that like to listen 
and dance to intellegent dance music.  we like to watch the sun come up.  
if that's not good enough for them, too bad.  we are going to keep on 
truckin, as they say in alabama.  =]

well, that's true, but i've found "afford" a lot of times is an 
individual perception.  

what if we all boycotted gas until it came down to 69 cents per gallon?  
it would never happen, because there's still not enough believers...but 
what if?

So I hope everyone is as well rested as I, and ready for yet another
glorious week...

(Heh)

Friday:  Well I took the day off and instead of rifling thru tons of
paperwork I stood in line form 8-10 AM and caught Star Wars.  While
watching the film a few friends of mine paged me and wanted to catch an
afternoon showing of... Star Wars.  So off to Santa Clara and a 2 PM
showing.  After lunch, and a few errands I was off to Redwood City to
rondevous w/ some other friends to catch a 7:30 showing of Star Wars.
(Can someone say Fanatico??).  I was dead tiredby 11Pm...

Saturday:  I must say if only one issue were cleared up, It would a been
a 10/10 Saturday...

My day really started @ 5:30PM when myself and a friend helped set up @
the _Koinonea_ event.  After spending a few hrs @ the site, myself and
Dhrien gruuved up to the mappoint and sold tickets from 9:30 till 11:30.
 I actually don't mind Mappoint because your not only get to see
everyone that's going to be @ the event, but you also help set the mood
of the party @ hand, and (possibly the best part) you KNOW the party
will be going OFF when you get there...
	And going OFF it was when D and I arrived back @ 12-or-so.  Anna was on
the 12" and playing some, well, really On Psi-trance. I was impressed on
how the sceansters themselves sorta reserved the back room for the
circle dancers. and the fron was wher the vibesters were playing...  I
jumped infront of a speaker and kept going...  I really enjoyed the
contorionist set during Ivo's set.  Hell, I really enjoyed Ivo's set!
He thru one or two tracks that really brought me to that higher state...
	Funny thing was, that while dancing three or so peoples asked me what I
was on while dancing I told them that I was pretty clean and that sorta
ended the conversations.  Dear ravers, some of us are "there" w/o drugs.
 I enjoy chatting, but you have ta pull me out of my reality first.  I
really don't mind...  What really got me to laughing was that allthough
I know I wasn't the only sober one, I guess us sober dancing maniacs
stick out like sore thums...
	My associates we're quite tired from setting up and dancing and such,
so we bailed early ( by my standards) @ 4:30.  Chilled out and 420'ed @
a friends house slept and spent a lovley sunday communing with nature @
one of my hidey hole beaches...

I really would like to thank the scensters for coming on down and
supporting the _Koinonea_ crew (And, no I STILL don't know how to
pronounce it...) and party.  At the same time I would like to express my
thanks to the _Koinonea_ family: Tom, Dhrien, Wonka, CT, and everyone
else who put thier trust in be to help out, set up, run mappoint and
have a killer good time.  Much love to all of you.

Saturday night, to me, is what the scene is about...  It's incidental
that it music was Goa.  I;ve caught the same vibe from Cyber-Trance to
House to Breakbeat events.  I love music, but love moreso the driving
force that gets these events going.

Respect,

no.  they're not.  at least i don't think so.  the main active

herbal weight loss programs for a fraction of the cost.  try it if you 
want, but some people get real edgy from the ma huang ( i might be

Alas, I didn't tape it cos I aint got cable (or even very good non cable
reception for that matter!).

It was nice to get asked some reasonable questions and get (I beleive)
undistorted reponses that actually aired. The woman that produces show (not
the interviewer) goes to parties etc. and is really nice.

The woman that interviewed me had no idea what a rave was, but actually
spent about an hour before we taped asking me questions including the usual
litany of sex and drugs questions =) and seemed very interested. At one
point she said (paraphrasing),

  "...so if all these psychedleics -- ecstasy etc, break down
social/cultural barriers as you say, don't wild orgies break out?"

"Sure, occasionally," I said, "But only if it's a really good party..."

Might just see her at a rave soon.... ;)

She too was nice enough when all was said and done. Nice one PBS.

see ya

According to Thomas himself, he DIDN'T call the cops on them, which makes
their actions a helluva lot more reprehensible. Apparently the problems
started when he had some differences with the way they run their parties
(them: money money money. tom: ???)

Anyway, he's healing OK and he says the scars on his face and head won't be
as bad as he expected.

Sorry for bringing this discussion up again, but from what I understand TT
was the victim in this case, and did nothing that would inspire that level
of violence in a NORMAL person. I'm still totally blown away that somthing
like this could happen here, now.

...so I went to my first Bagok Tribe party on saturday. I was curious since
I've heard so many bad things about BT on this list and from friends, and I
wanted to check it out for myself to confirm/deny my suspicions.

Geez, I tried to go with an open mind but I haven't seen so many high
school kiddies so completely into themselves since my senior prom.
(although the vibe was better at "A night in the tropics, April 1995")

Those circle dancers sure can circle dance, but I'll be damned if I buy
into the whole exhibitionism thing. I wonder how they reconcile showing off
*and* getting yucky dust all over their brand-spankin'-new Hilfiger
threads?

So I wasn't at all surprised when they got busted at 230am. I heard one of
the promoters got taken in for mouthing off to the cops. Where's the
"respect" I hear so much about on their flyers, or is it applied
selectively to people in hot pants and sports bras?

miffed,

I just spoke with a lawyer who works at my company(and he is even a nice
guy) who is going to give me a lead on a good civil rights attorney within
the next day or two.

I'm right there with you.  That's why I posted my response about
the fact that it wasn't funny, that it was racist, and that people
should think about what it is that they're laughing at and 
retelling.  I think some very anti-racist people on this list 
might be making the mistake of thinking that they're only laughing 
at a misunderstood policy, when in fact, after thinking it through,
they may suddenly realize that the jokes have a hurtful, racist 
aspect to them as well.  

As for "laughing at ourselves", that's only fine when the 
person the jokes center around finds them funny.  I get a little 
tired of the "redneck" jokes -- y'know, "family-trees-with-too-
few-branches" type jokes.  They're funny the first 14-or-so times 
you hear them, then they wear thin, and then even the semi-polite 
ones are downright offensive.  Being a Southern boy, I find that 
there is a pervasive attitude here against Southern people that 
depicts them as ignorant, shotgun-toting, pig-romancing, 
dentally-neglected, hygiene-challenged, idiots generated by a 
severely limited gene-pool.  I often see that reflected in how
I'm treated in business situations.  I'm respected right up until
I open my mouth.  I'm a senior systems engineer with over a 
decade of software experience under my belt, but I have to fight 
just to be included in some conversations, even when I'm the 
acknowledged expert.

Anyway, I did not find Mr. Ruiz's "joke" funny at all.  And as for 
those that might react negatively to your post, just blow them 
off.  You're dead on.  On the other hand, as for the "nice people"
side of this, I'd be willing that Noah just failed to think about
how it might be taken.  I'm sure he's a nice guy in need of a 
little education.  I *sincerely* hope he doesn't fall into the
same category with Jesse Helms and James Earl Ray!

(said in an "Erckel" voice) So get down with your bad self, 
my brother!  Cracking on the busted science, and, uh, 
righteous melanin, and, um...  stuff...

Does he do pro bono work?  There are several lawyers on line, but not
one
that would take up the "good fight", and I haven't seen anyone put down
the
dollars it would take to wage that war.  I absolutely agree with you
that
our constitutional rights are being flexed severely, but who ever goes

I've tried various herbal E solutions and I found them all to work for
me.  They aren't as good as the real thing AND you really need to be
careful with them, improper dosing can really mess-you-up (even kill
you).  I know that improper dosing of anything can be potentially
fatal... it's just that the "experience" you get from the herbal
products is much, much mellower than the real thing and it's easy to be
tempted to take more, thus the hazard.  Also, be prepared to abstain
from eating ANYTHING for 12-18 hours before dosing! (Normally, I can
eat ANYTHING up to 6 hours before taking the real thing....)  The cost
of the product, by the time you take as many tablets as required, is
pretty much equiv to taking the full version.  The plus is the fact
that you don't get "altered" by it and can function fine the next day
if you are sensitive to the effects of mdma.

That's my all my knowledge on the subject,

Hey Tina... there is also another space on Stevenson alley that is okay,
and that is the space where Silly was held on a very rainy night last
November and I think there have been other parties here such as Pro-Soy
events???
This space is between 5th & 6th and is well run by cool people....

Can anyone tell me why mentioning the race of the alleged assailants is
crucial in the following text? I can see why it's important in the context of
the rest of the paragraph. I can't wait to hear your responses....

I was just relaying facts exactly as I heard them.  Note that Russians were
also allegedly involved in all this too, is Russian a race? I'm not sure, but

If you are a little kid, and you are first going to school, and the
teacher tells you not to talk "like that," what are you going to do?  How
can you talk any way but how you talk?  Wouldn't it be great if the
teachers could explain that how you talk is okay, but that you
should learn to speak in the standard way?

I grew up in Texas, and for some strange reason, my family spoke standard
English at home.  My little kid brain was quite delighted that nobody told
me at school not to talk "like that."  But there were plenty of other kids
who didn't speak the standard way, and they had a very hard time of it.  

I could tell even then that there was something interesting and different
about how Black and Latino kids expressed themselves, and they that were
getting some serious sh*t from the teachers over it.  The teachers made
them feel they were ignorant, but really they weren't.  It was the
teachers who were ignorant!

Black English has a long and fascinating history.  Why not teach it in
school- at least to teach people how to translate into standard
English?  And to teach people about all the slang and not-slang
expressions and structures in standard English that Black people invented.
And about the debt American culture owes to African-Americans.  In this
respect, acknowledging Ebonics seems a step in the right direction.

        I can't tell you why mentioning the race is important, but I can
remind you that the best info we have now indicates this is a false rumor.

	The encounter in which TT was knifed happened outside the Stevenson 
space, and it was a Russian - possibly even from the Caucasus, who knows -
who did the knifing. This information was relayed from TT thru Ran to the
list.

        I guess it says something about America that anytime somebody
makes up a story about some crime, it seems to be "black guys" cast as the
perps ...

circle dancer chick that has been talking shit about me ever since
Sankofa..  And if she is on the net. I have one thing to say to her. GET
OVER IT! Thank you.
  Just to damn crowded thats all...
  Everytime I found some room to dance.. BOOM! crowded agian...

  From what became of my night after the break up..  I must say. The bust
could not of happened at a better time.
  Anybody know if they got a new space? I did not follow up on that one.

  Special thanx goes out to Corey for calling me up, and letting me know
that the Odyssey ravE was going to be "Booty?" And that Donald G. was never
bought his plane ticket agian.. Hmmmm..
   Cause I would of REALLY missed out if I didn't goto the Bagok party..

OK, so in the little amount of time Ive been in the Bay Area Ive been to
something like 10 raves.  Easily one of the most memorable was a Pro-Soy
event over the summer (why cant I remember the name?).  Anyway, it looks
like this list appreciates Pro-Soy... but I notice there are a bunch of
other raves that same nite.  Is this the right one to go to?  Indeed, if
anyone can recommend any of the stuff thats coming up (since I am *STILL*
green to the DJs and production corps), I will forever be your friend.

Ive got *MORE* new people coming to this next event.  So make it a good
one!  :-)

- David

So far myself, Eric Pedersen, and Geoff White(thanks guys) are putting up 
the money. As I posted before anyone wishing to contribute anything be it
money, their presence at the consultation, or good questions, is welcome
to do so.

I was working Koinonea on saturday, <i was crewing with black lighting dave, plus just helping out the buetyful Koinonea crew> And I chose to stand at the upstairs bathroom and make sure that the toilet didn't overflow anymore...ANYWAYS, through my bordom of watching people stand in line for the bathroom i thought I would start a survey...I have always been curious of the actual amount of drugs used at a rave, so I started to ask people if they were on any drugs...excluding pot, the ratio was about 3 sober people to every high person...and it seemed to me the sober people were having a much better time...

Looks as though my move North is approaching fast - 

Appreciate any comments regarding - 

How much are you paying for housing?  Where is it.

Recomendations - where to look, where to stay away from.

Any resources on the Net?

Anyone know of people living on boats?  I'm living on my sailboat in
Santa Barbara, may bring her North depending if I sell and availibility
of land housing.

I don't have any specific area, but Suasilito seems like a trip place.

Appreciate as much info as I can get.

It sounds great to me.  If your nation could get the bux up to send me to 
anyplace they want to in the world, I might surely take them up on it.  

As for what the world is doing, I think you need to check history.  There 
has always been an assulat on epople of color, especially since the 
discovery of, er, the new world.  Until that point Mr. Ruiz, people were 
pretty much cannibalizing themselves.  I am aware of this, are you?

And what does this have to do with that lame post you had porr judgement 
in forwarding?

Nothing.

And what excuses are these?  What excuses did I make?  Are you so damned 
angry that you can barely think straight?  Please give me some references 
to respond to instead of hyperbole.

Next time you might want to think before you post such inane drivel.  I 
don;t care where the f**k you're from, if you make some off color remark 
I'll call you on it.  Could care less if your ancestors are from here or 
Mars.  My ancestors are from here too bucko (We have native american 
blood in our family...you are not the only one with the claim dear sir).

Much of that slang is out of date. Did you know that?  Or are you just 
down to ridicule that which you have no argument for...blast on Mr. 
Ruiz.  Let's get this list shut down.

And whose slang is it anyway? 

As for entertainemnt, your post was anything but.  Just a bunch of 
raciast drivel guised as humor.

Wow, you didn;t read.  I clearly said people of color.  And sir, I am 
keenly aware of the persecution of others here in this racist shitpot 
called Amerikka.  The racism of the Irish (who at one time were worht 
LESS than a slave during the building of this country), your people (some 
call 'em Indians, I prefer Native Americans.  Or I could drop all 
civility and go the Noble Savage route just for laughs, but I find racism 
not to be funny at all sir, not at all).

When in god's name did I ever say I lived a hard life?  Your own 
predjudices and bigotries cry out with this statement.  YOU think that 
because I defend those whose life is hard that somehow my life is as hard 
or just as hard?  Or do you suppose the contrary and say that I am a 
poseur who knows nothing of the hard life?  Not really clear.  OG?  Nope 
never been a gangstah or even close to the streets, and therein lies my 
credibility, I don;t pretend to be something I am not.  I am old school, 
because I am old.  I remeber when hip-hop first started, I remeber when 
disco was going off and went to plenty in my day.  I remeber when blow 
pops first came out, I remeber throwing rocks as play using garbage can 
lids, I remember being the second black family to move into an all white 
neighborhood, I remember the first day of high school when race riot6s 
broke out, I remeber in junior high some black kids beating the shit out 
of a white kid for no reason other than he was a white kid (I helped 
homey up, and showed him the way home), I remember the first Asian person 
I ever met as the center of a racially divided team (the white guys chose 
him, the black team chose me); he got bum rushed and got his face beat 
and glasses broken.  He and I sat out the rest of the game while a riot 
ensued.  He is still one of my closest frineds, one Mr. Grant Lam.

Mr. Ruiz, kiss my ass.

As for being tough?  I am tough by virtue of just being here.  I am not 
locked up, nor in the process of being locked up.  I have great command 
of the english language, and despite not having a degree work at one of 
the best computer comanies in the world.  Tough?  Yeah as nails, because 
I am here.  Bad ass?  Never made that claim.  Honorable?  Always, or at 
least I try to be.

And tell us something about yourslef, other than the vile you chose to 
share with the list today.  Let's talk about the complete lack of 
judgement you showed by putting such an insentive message up on SFRaves.  
Especially considering the fact that we recently did this racial go 
around.  Tell us about the humor you find as one group malignes another, 
or makes fun of another.  At whose expense humor?  When do you apply 
PLUR?  Was your post PLUR?  Did it embody peace, love, unity, or 
respect?  And how?  That is the only real question here.

I will always think hightly of myslef.  You may denigrate yourself or 
feign humility, I will not.  BTW, stop telling people how they should be, 
you would get alot farther with your message.

Now please continue...

> Stop using your peoples past as an excuse for the present and the future.

Are you really that naive?  Yes you are.  Those who do not learn from 
history are doomed to repeat it.

I will NEVER FORGET: Slavery of any peoples (The Crusades, the Slavery of 
Africans by Africans, The Salvery of Women, the Holocaust, the Pogroms, 
the Johanessburghs), the triumph of good over evil; WWII, WWI 
(consequences noted), civil right struggle that allows you with your 
mixed heritage to have an opinion broadcast, womens equality and 
suffrage, gender equality and gay rights.

I WILL NEVER FORGET: Moses, Ghandi, Begin, Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Malcolm X, Geronimo, Geronimo Pratt, Ralph Bunche, W.E.B. Dubois, Maya 
Angelou, Sitting Bull, Madame Curie, and every other warrior who fought 
the fight for what they believed.  I guess they should've been quiet too.

You made this personal not me.  I didn;t say how I was treated, I made a 
generalization as to how people of color are treated.  Don;t beleive it 
huh?  Get out of the poarty scene and smell reality.  50% of people in 
prison  are black (we are only 12% of the population), The most people on 
welfare are white females, this country wages war against the poor in 
various ways that 20% of all children in this kkkountry are born in 
poverty.  Get a life.  My people are the people of this nation.  Every 
man is my brother, and every woman my sister.  Get it?

No you don;t because you will see me as you want to see me.  Angry, 
hateful, and any other adjective.  TYoo bad for you you can't see the 
forest for the trees.

Been watching "Yo MTV Raps!" Mr. Ruiz?  Ok G, bust me off something...

Wrong sir.  You overstepped your boundaries.  Posting that racist drivel, 
and I called your sorry butt to the carpet for it.  If you don;t want 
ridicule, then be careful of what you say lest ou offend.  Adn be 
prepared to defend what you say.  Instead all you have done is, instead 
of explain, ridicule my inital reaction in an attempt to dismiss.  You 
have failed, much like your tepid attempt at humor sir.

Sir, I did not call you a racist.  In John Lee's world saying a racist 
thing does not automatically make you a racist.  That is your own jump in 
logic.  Saying something that may be construed as sexist does not 
automatically make one a sexist.  Faux Pas?  Perhaps.

What you posted, to me, was racist.  It wasn;t even ebonics, but slang.  
Adn it was racist.  Next time get the category right so that we may all 
laugh togehter.  IMO, you just missed the target.  No, you may very well 
not be a racist, I have no way of knowing since I never met you, but what 
you posted, under the guise of ebonics was racist.  Why?  it had nothing 
to do with ebonics but slang.  And Ebonics, by most accounts, is 
different than slang and is a pattern of speech.  You fucked up and 
mislabled something.  No biggie, just a racial slip-up.

Now please...continue.

PLUR to you too.  Thank you for grouping my feelings and the feelings of 
others as having no value.  You Mr. Ruiz are in need of some serious 
love, or at least a good lay.

Speaking of getting laid...I think you should get some, or use your hand 
or something.  I think you have pent up sexual frustration that manifests 
itself in strange ways.

As for using something, what can I use?  How do I use past discrimination 
to my benefit?  And please tell mw how *I* have benefitted from pointing 
out the fact that your message was not only lacking humor , but, IMO, racist?

Everytime?  Erroneous non-sequitors.  Everytime something is posted about 
race, I have an insight or a view that I'd like to share with people.  
Sorry you don;t like it.  Maybe you shouldn't read my posts regarding 
race.  Or maybe a better solution might be to stop reading my posts 
altogether, since it seems you don't as much read them, as react to them.

The last thing I need from ANYONE on this lsit or in life is pity.  I do 
not ask for it, thus please fell no need to give it.  I however do pity 
you.  You head is stuck so far up your ass I think your brain has been

Am I to answer that as well?  I think you have to choose your own battles 
and fights.  That is not for me to decide.  If it si a fight that I have 
a cuase to join, I'll be there with ya, otherwise, consider the fact that 
you can fight as a great liberty bestowed upon us all by the Great White 
Fathers.  Hell, the way I look at it, if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't 
have the pleasure of talking to you now.

Ain't life grand! :)

What schools are these that *I* have?  Are these schools that John S. Lee 
owns, or are these African American schools?  Please inform me.  I can 
smeel your racism you so neatly cast aside as my misunderstanding.  Your 
generalizing and grouping, albeit veiled.

And what native american slang have *I* or any black person tried to copy 
or ape?  Sheeit, we took english and made it so you couldn't understand 
it if you tried.  We (Africans) have already mastered it.  So much so, we 
had the Southerners during the civil war singing a rebel slave song 
("Away Dixieland" was written by a former slave who escaped from the 
south! <- GOTHCA!).

What made your post sickeningly racist was this:  the title is deceptive, 
ebonics primer as if one is going to be taught the basics of ebonics.  
simple joke algorithm, however it turns ugly when it is revelaed that it 
is not ebonics but street slang. OOPS.  You attribute them as equal, when 
in fact they are far different from each other.  OOPS.  Intentional?  You 
tell me?

The fact you don't know shit about Ebonic vs. Slang, and your total lack 
of comprehension of such differences doesn't make your littlle faux pas 
any less stinging.  All I did was point out that eqauting the two in a 
joking manner reeked IMHO of racisms, intended or not.

You see sir, as much as people in this country want to move past race, we 
cannot.  Why?  Because we don;t talk about it, we don;t want to deal with 
the scars of the past, we don;t want to have to open all of the ugliness 
that we've done to each other. ALL THE WAY AROUND.  One of the reasons I 
think countries like South Africa will surpass us in many ways.  They are 
dealing with their past in a most direct way, while we Americans have 
engaged in a campaign of sweeping every controversial issue under the 
rug.  I don;t buy into cuh a program.  I would just as well have a 
discussion about where I'm coming from in the hopes oif greater 
understanding all around.

But...please continue.

Now I KNOW you're clueless.  

The fact that you would DARE compare one person's or people's misery to 
another shows how friggin detached you are from the truth.  I have never 
said one group got it worse than others.  NEVER!

You have though, and now I know what sewer your mind dwells in.

Suffering is suffering, whether it has a brown or white face.

Get real.

As for getting real, let me know when you do, and we can have a cogent 
conversation.

And I guess you speak for most people.  Most people, did you hear that, 
you now have a spokesperson:

The live in a hole.  I will never forget the various holocausts that the 
human race has inflicted on itself.  But I will always try to learn from 
it, not HIDE from it like you wish to do sir.

And what in the fuck is long ago?  Rodney King is long ago?  Arthur Mc 
Duffie is long ago?  A generation is long ago?  Please define.

What advantage do I have?  The advantage of engaging in this stupid

And what veiled advantage are you talking about. Affirmative Action?  
What are you babbling about?

No, you made racist statements, IMO, and I called you on it.  People will 
use what voice they may, I for one will NEVER be silent.  If you spout 
some more distateful jokes, I'll do it again.  Just be prepared for when 
you post stupid shit, someone will be there to check you.

hello,
I wanted to give an ocean of thanks to every soul that gave itself to 
helping out with Koinonea on Saturday. I was amazed at how openly people 
shared themselves and what they had to offer with one another. I think 
dancing creates a kind of unity that transcends the boundaries we as a 
people have. Also, sharing plays an equally important role in fostering 
community. I felt that as a whole, we managed to ascend from the 
constraints of third dimensional drama and pressure, and re-unite 
together, somewhere high in the sky, to hug and laugh.....

One thing that bothered me.....
There was a small group of guys in particular who, pardon me, did not 
belong and WERE NOT welcome. They were welocm when they first came in, 
and they were welcome to be free and share themselves for about an hour. 
But when they began tagging the walls, intimidating people, and being 
scary and unpleasant, they GAVE UP the privelege of being there. This is 
a tuff issue for me, because while I want ot embrace everyone who comes 
inside and I want everyone to be welcome, some people who infringe on 
other people prevent people at the party from feeling safe and welcome. 
At about 3:00, when I asked them peacfully, calmly and politely to leave 
because they were being unpleasant and unfairly infringing on others (and 
because they were drunk), they refused. I did not know what to do, since 
the last thing I would want to happen is a confrontation of violence or 
physical force, so they stayed. What I am doing now, may seem mean, but I 
feel it is necesary:
If you are going to come to a Koinonea gathering, please respect every 
person's right to be and to be free. If you are going to be intimidating, 
if you are going to infringe on others, if you are there to rudely "mack" 
on people as if they were meat, if you are going to disrespect ANYONE, 
		DO NOT COME, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT WELCOME!!!!!!!!!

Otherwise, (and I'm sorry to even have to address this issue, and bring 
the unpleasantness of this issue up) all are welcome and let's  continue 
to gather peacefully as a group of individuals forming ONE whole. Thank 
you for understanding.

I will not respond to anything thats posted to the list regarding this
subject after this email...This is the one and only response you'll see
from me on the list.  Bu-bye!
_______________________________________________________________________________
Well,  I already responded to John S. Lee privately.  It was supposed to
goto the list, but I'm glad it didn't.  This email is basically towards
those who piss me off and that would be mainly one person... but if you
feel you need to read this and you get offended by it, PLEASE SPARE THE
REST OF THE LIST, and email me privately.

I do wish that certain people would just leave this alone.  I apologize for
not thinking before posting, but you know what people, shit happens and
sometimes one makes mistakes.  If you all feel your better than that then
you should leave me out of your petty flames about a joke cause I'm really
not at your level and never will be.

Its slang no matter how you look at it.  If you want to put a race behind
it then do so.  Ebo, Indianbo whatever its the same we all talk slang
therefore we're all part of this thing called language and life...  DEAL
WITH IT, FOLKS!

All I know is that Double standards bite.  And I see alot of it especially
on this list from certain people...

I'm a minority (Apache Indian)  I don't need anyone telling me about
suffering.  My sisters and brothers got their land stolen.  Their wifes
rapped.  Their families killed.  And you don't see me using this to justify
my actions NOW, DO YOU!!!!

If you all can't handle a little slang then sorry don't read it.  Its all
around us.  So get used to it.

I don't see any of you backing up Native Americans.  As far as I'm
concerned your all racist and I'm fully disgusted with your actions towards
me...

Whine about how African "Americans" suffered then use it against everyone
later on... That makes fricken sense, John.  You guys crack me up...  Give
it up folks its done, its over.

I'm tired of hearing about how African "Americans" are all getting picked
on, and how they don't have any say in this world we live in.  John, if you
asked me its called DOUBLE STANDARDS, and I think you guys are milking it.


And don't give me this shit about me being racist for my words right now,
cause I talked to my Uncle "WHO IS BLACK", and he agrees with me.  So take
your shit and stuff it right back where you found it.  In your mouth.....

What about my say in this world, what about the land your on right now.
What about my family living on shitty land in Arizona cause people like you
have their head so far up their ass they can't smell their own shit any
more.

Don't irritate me with your babble about the past.  You all have your foot
in the door.  No one is stopping you...  You don't know nothing but lets
jump on the bad wagon and stand up for a race cause everyone else is doing
it and its cool...

I need to go and cool down now, and get my thoughts together.  You know,
live my life for today not the past.  I know its hard for some of you.  And
most of you will never get it.  And you know what, I don't care.  AS long
as my family and my friends are happy then I'm happy.

Have a fricken wonderful day...

Siphon!

I am sick of all of this mindless blather.  "I am opressed".  "No, I am
more oppressed".  Is this some sort of claim to excellence?  Shut up, and
understand the fact that you are INDIVIDUALS first, members of this or that
race, ethnicity, or nation later.  As individuals, you have ultimate power
over your individual destiny, regardless of your oppression.  Personally, I
couldn't care less about what the color of someone's skin is.  It means
nothing in itself.  But a person who spouts sewage from their mouth, THAT I
care about.


>It sounds great to me.  If your nation could get the bux up to send me to
>anyplace they want to in the world, I might surely take them up on it.

Finally, a word on the United States.  While it is true that this country
has done some horrible things over the years, what country hasn't?  As
members of a social contract, we 'choose' to be Americans.  We have every
right in the world to leave.  Haiti?  Ghana? Syria? Yugoslavia? I doubt
that you would want to live in any of these countries.... or most countries
in the world, for that matter.  Any of us would be shot for saying the
things we say on this list.  When you complain about how bad it is here,
your provinciality shows.

And then you do go on and on, getting your last bits in.  I thought you 
would have nothing further to say?

Man, Noah, I think you should calm down, chill, 420, and re-visit.
(I can't beleive *I* am telling anyone to calm down.  I'm usually the one 
who's hot!).

I see:  You post something with racial content AND you expect everyone to 
not be affected WHILE saying that you are not at our level (whoever "we", 
are).  I want to know what level that is, superior, inferior, or equal?

You are very ambiguous with much of what you say Noah.

Was linguistics your major?  Got a PhD in it?  I know I don't, but since 
this deabte started I am fascinated by all the linguists coming out of 
the woodwork to declare that it is a language.  Interesting.  I guess I 
better ignore those, er experts, and use Mr. Ruiz's Most People 
approach.  That way I could better, DEAL WITH IT.  Folx.

And, pray-tell, who might "certain people" be?  Certainly not the same as 
Most People you throw around so causally.  I'm dying to know.  Why so 
obtuse and covert.  Don;t hide , say it, you've never stopped saying what 
you wanted to in the first place, why stop now Mr. Ruiz?

I dunno.  Maybe consideration of your ancestors might make you a better 
person, but that is my very humble opinion.  We can all learn lessons 
from the past.  Justify your actions?  What actions has anyone justified 
by way of thier ancestors?  Obtuse again...please calm down and be specific.

Nope.  I will not have you ape Africans.  Nor will I let others ape your 
people, nor will I let others ape anyone, tell off color jokes, make fun 
of people for something they cannot help.  It's called being human.

Now look whose using what.  Be careful.  Don;t set a pradigm you are not 
ready to follow religiously.  Now you are sounding mad AND hypocritical.

Since I have Native American blood coarsing through my veins, I can only 
guess that I am excluded.  But maybe my black side is pissed off, maybe 
that Buffalo Soldier will come out with great vengeance and furious anger 
(reminds me of the Robert Mitchum movie "Night of The Hunter", where his 
fists are tatooed 'love' and 'hate' and he has a mock hand battle showing 
the virtues of love over hate.  Directly thereafter, he kills a woman and 
hunts down her kids for loot and stolen booty).

Nope, it's just begun and now YOU won't let it loose.  The struggle dear 
sir never ceases.

I thought you responded to me privately yet stilla dress me publicly?  
You're really a confused person Noah.

"You guys"?  WHO are you talking about?  Who is milking what?  tired of 
history?  Don't repeat it.

And so?....Hmmm.. uncle agress, he is black, Noah went and verified his 
thoughts with a black person, to give his thoughts validity.  In other 
words, you had no faith in what you beleived, and needed a boost from an 
African to give your argument merit?  Who is using whom for what?  You 
mean they could not stand on their own merit and required help from the 
group you have spent time maligning?  I wonder has you uncle read you 
other jewels of wisdom that he gave such a response?

I am suprised you needed any help at all.

Your argument has no merit.  Your post was/is racist, and I'm really 
starting to suspect you have a serious problem with not only history, but 
perhaps yourself.  even you don;t beleive the shit you say, needed uncle 
to verify, your own words.

Make your mark, and stand on it.

No matter what Uncle said, your post was racist.  Get real, adn deal with 
it Noah.

> 
> What about my say in this world, what about the land your on right now.

I dunno, changed hands alot.  Land I'm on was Mexico at one point.  Your 
name is certainly not completely Native American now is it.  Sounds 
Spanish to me.  Anyway the land is the land, and from what I understand 
from many Native American cultures, the land is owned by noone, not even 
your ancestors by some accounts.  One of the reasons it was relatively 
easy to get this rock called the USA anyway, the people, on the whole, 
may not have felt the supreme sense of ownership whites had.

Just a thought.

> What about my family living on shitty land in Arizona cause people like you

> more.

I can only venture that was meant for me.

My people, other than perhaps the white side:
-Didn't own any land, we were/are black.
-Were slaves when we were brought here in 1756, from England!
-All of the wealth and fortune of that great white master Wilkinson are 
east coast, we had nothing to do with the subjugation of your tribe or 
peoples, save the fact for being here in the first place.

As a person of color, I understand.  But I was under the impression that 
you don't live, much less think about the past.  Why mention this now?  
Having trouble sticking to your guns perhaps?

Please stake a line and hold it.  You move around too much for me to take 
proper aim Noah.

Excellent Noah.  Now you've given us a REAL Ebonic pre-primer:"You don't 
know nothing..."  

Use of the double negative, excellent. See, it's easy if you try!

Count me in.  Until this country cleans up it's racial mess, we will 
ALWAYS have racil tension.  And as much as it is ignored, it will always 
raise it's ugly head as the issue you left untouched.

Sad.

Are you sure?  You don't seem to happy today.  I would say, hostile is 
more appropriate.

Oh yeah, once again, I am not OG, I am old school. Why, cuz' I am old, 
and proud of it.  I remember Knockers, AstroPops, The First epidsode of 
the Brady Bunch, Partridge Family, the Waltons, Good Times, and of course 
ALL In The Family.

Remember Soul Train dance line, when the robot and penguin were the 
dances, what about the freak...any old schoolers out there wanna put on 
some bells, proper shirt (out of the two sisters), and of course a sky 
with hella brim?  Y'know what I'm sayin'.

okay kids.  This really is going to far.  I think everybody has to take a
minute to cool off.  I don't think anybody here is really meaning to lay on
the slander and racism.  Who is more racist the racist or the accuser?
This fight has been going on for way too long and I don't just mean on this
list.  We should all take some time to look at the generations who have
passed us by, for instance the baby boomers.  Who for the last 40 years
have preached to all of us about peace and loving one another and while the
backs were turned still maintained their hate as much as before.  Why don't
we, the new generation, try to make an effort to end the bullshit and just
be cool?  We don't need marches and sit-ins.  We don't need great leaders
and fierce warriors.  We just need to know, which I think that we all do,
that we are all here for the rest of our lives and our children's lives and
we have to live together.  Why don't we save out bickering and fighting and
hating for people who deserve it.  Like people who oppress and prevent
personal freedom and happiness.  The ebonics bit is something that we have
all heard too much about lately, and simply because it was in somewhat poor
taste or perhaps without forethought doesn't mean we should force someone
into angst.  I don't post to this list often, I just like to hear the
goings on, being that I'm not from SF (yet:) But from what I've seen you
all are way smarter than this shit.  You all give a damn about each other.
It's one thing to teach each other about what ebonics really is, this is
good.  I didn't know the truth about it, I appreciate the knowledge and
truth.  However, I don't even like to hear somebody else beat up like that.
 Everybody needs to relax and enjoy our differences.  We need to learn from
each other, my God I'm starting to sound like my mom.  Please make it go
away!!  
Seriously.  End it.  No more flames.  Just
Peace
-Eric

Thanks thanks thanks to the crew who put on this beautiful party.

The vibe was so good - I spent most of the night in a comfy couch
upstairs meeting folks and yakking with my sweet buddy J.  If ya
talked to guy with a long black ponytail and a gal with a blonde bob...
and two huge grins... that was us.

The Chai folks were wonderful - that is a _buzzin'_ drink!

Oh... I'm new here... thanks for the community y'all.

hugs... ..max..

Hey all-

I was just reading a post about TT and him catching a buglar in his home and
them stabbing him. It is very interesting how people are quick to point out
nationality, cause had they been WHITE guys like they were no one mentions that
but if it is a person of color they are quick to say "some BLACK DUDES did it"
incedentally I was watching a program on TV and it was with some guys that were
in new york and they had robbed some guys and when the cops came they said who
did the robbing the guys said it was some "black dudes" and they were white
jewish guys on the program. This type of attitude gets me so upset cause I am a
african american and when some violent crime happens people always tend to
think that is a person of color. I am sick of people of color being used as
some scape goat for this society, It is real hard to in the "rave scene" cause
this scene is predominately european (I.E encompassing all "white people") I
hope that does not sound racist I dont mean to label it is just that if you say
"white" some people say im not white im this or that so I refer to people who
would be considered "white" european seeing how "white" people originated from
europe.
But NE-Wayz when there are "homies" at partys they are usally people or color
and it just makes me stop and wonder if my fellow rave brothers look at me in
that type of light? I would assume not seeing how I have experineced nothing
but love in this community. But I still feel that some of these persons are
like representing me even though I am not with them I feel that most people
discrimanate in groups. They don't say those guys over there they judge by one
persons actions. If some black guy is acting a fool at a party he does not
represent me or my race he represents his self, but society in most cases does
not see it that way. So to make a long story short, TT was appereantly beat up
by some europeans and yet "some black doodes" where blamed for it. And the same
thing with the lady that killed her children in Carolina once again "some black
guy" stole my kids and car. The real shame here is that no black people were
probably in these areas at the time :-(


ONE DAY WE WILL ALL BE COLOR BLIND...

Peace and love,

Hey all-

It is now monday and our party went fairly ok due to all the tiny problems we
encountered during the course of the evening. Unfortunately donald glaude did
not show up due to he FUKING FAKED one us he called the day of the party from
ST. louis and his exact words were "dude im sorry im cathching a flight out
now" I will be in the bay area before your party. But we had already booked
terence toy from LA to take his place so we said ok you two can go on four
decks. That did not happen donald did not show up. :-(  Plus the person that
was supposed to supply the black light and various banners did not show as
well. However we did make due with what we had. I would like to thank all of
you who did come out I did have a good time and hope you all enjoyed my music.
Now with the girl at the end I have some not so good news. The young girl was
triping out on some acid and some FUCKING JERKS thought that it was ok to rape
her. I assume she was raped cause we found some used condoms and her friend who
stayed with us said that it might have happend. I would like to thank Dutch and
the mantra sound sound system for helping us out with the situation. One of the
guys from the mantra sound system said that he kind of remembers seeing the
guys but did not know what was going on? No one new until it was to late. But
we plan on using the Mantra sound again and we will keep our eyes out for this
FUCKING INHUMANE JERKS. And if we do catch them we will call the cops and due
some of our own things to them. I dont advocate violence but KNOW ONE has the
right to RAPE or hurt another human being under any circumstance. The one lady
turns out to be only 15 years old two that is really sad and we are real upset
about that. We plan on staying in contact with some of the girls who came to
the party that happened to take acid with the girl in question and try to work
through this problem. IT's people like that, that give our community a bad name
and scare promoters and partys, and the people that take controlled substances
need to be more responsibility two and informed about what they are taking and
be aware of your environment. But that still does not give any body the right
to put there hands on someone else, I feel deeply  hurt about the situation
because that is somebodys lil sister or daughter and I know if someone did that
to my sister mother or daughter I would be upset besides the simply fact that
is wrong. But enough about that it was a good party and the vibe was good. Look
out for our next party in April wich will be even better. We have learned a lot
from this experience and are ready to learn what we can and move on. BTW the
voice mail was messed up all day so we will be switching VM but I will post the
updated numbers. Plus if anyone is interested I will be playing some partys
this month um one next saturday and some others but nothing is set in stone.
Once again I would like to thank all that showed and Dutch and the mantra crew
and all the people that helped with my party. Hey anissa you should have came
up to me I think I remember you dancing in the front kewl thanks. BTW send my
your number again cause someone stole my day runner :-(



peace and love all.

Macadio      STay tuned for our party in April =)

Ok.  So.

So John and Noah are at each other's virtual throats on this.  Noah
threw down some rather weird defensive "logic" for which John proceeded
to verbally bash his head in.  I'd have done the same, I'm sure.

BUT:  
	o Noah is a good guy who made a dumb mistake
	  and is now acting defensively.  
	o John is a good guy teaching Noah the hard 
	  penalty for racist remarks in this forum.

SO, let's just calm down a bit, ok?  You guys kiss and make up, alright?

Some observations:

1. JOHN: Rather than go around and around about whether the "joke" Noah
sent was Ebonics or slang, why not give examples of both so we, the poor
uneducated melanin-challenged folk ;) , can make the distinction in the
future?

2. For some, the difference between being funny and being racist is
whether or not you're the underdog.  I personally find Russell Simmons
"Def Comedy Jam" to be one of the most amazingly racist programs on TV
today.  Open, vitriolic characterizations of whites typifies most of the
routines.  I find it patently offensive and unacceptable, but it's
hysterically funny if you're on the "black" side of the fence, no?

3. So Noah is Native American.  Fine.  Well, that really plays no part
in whether or not the humor was acceptable.  If a little green man
stepped out of a spaceship and started delivering a comedy routine
smattered with the "N" word, I'd personally walk up and shut off the
mike.  There's never a good excuse for racial remarks, period.

4. So I'm a brownish shade of pink (popularly referred to as "white"). 
Fine.  That doesn't mean I can't be just as offended by a racist
statement that disrespects a dark brown (popularly referred to as
"black") friend.  We are all here together, and we're all family.

5. THE COLOR DOESN'T MATTER.  If this had a been a list of jokes that
slandered ANYONE based on their skin color, I, and I'm sure most of the
people on this list, would have a very real problem with it.

6. IMPORTANT: The joke was dumb, Noah apologized for it, and I think the
whole incident made an important point, that "jokes" of that nature just
aren't appropriate.

Much love and phat hugz,

S

He probably feels the same as the person who wrote this:

>ONE DAY WE WILL ALL BE COLOR BLIND...

This could be flame bait but:
I believe that the only reason that race was mentioned was that, at the time
it was assumed that certain Russians had attacked TT. If the persons who
attacked TT had an excess of melanin then it stands to reason they also were
lacking in russian-ness. Something like; If black then not russian....Most
of the time....

Ok people,

Before I start getting all these suggestions please note:

Noah and I are in private mail having a chat.  Relax.  we've both known 
each other for a long time and both have had a bout of it.  It's all good.

Back to healing & communicating...I now return you to that whch you left 
before you read this message...er, yeah.

Peace,
Out,
John

P.S.  I love the 420 reference.  I NEVER knew until recently what it 
meant.  And some youngblood schooled this old kat here as to wassup wit 
the 420.  Even my, er younger SO, informed me of what 420 was.  Sheeit, 
I'm outta tha loop myself AND got schooled.

Now people, I'ma take my schoolin and see if it learned me some good.

420?  good to go!

Peace! :)'s

For yer info ... i happened to be at the BC College of Pharmacists the 
other day and grabbed a book called Drugs and Drug Abuse off the shelf.  
it was a 1996 edition, but stupidly i didn't get the authors' names etc. 
so this isn't the most organized post but i thought someone might find it 
interesting ...

KETAMINE
Drug Class: Disassociative Anesthetic

Ketamine (Katalar) is a sythetically manufactured disassociative(1) 
anesthetic with potent hallucinogenic and analgesic features similar to 
those produced by phencyclidine (PCP).  It occurs as a white crystalline 
powder, freely soluble in water and soluble in alcohol.  When it is 
injected intravenously over a period of one minute, disassociative 
feelings are experienced very rapidly and unconsciousness may be achieved 
almost immediately.  The therapeutic intravenous dose is between 1 and 2 
mg per kilogram of body weight; the dose range for intramuscular 
injection is approximately three times as great.  A therapeutic dose 
causes increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure.

Unconsciousness lasts for only 10 - 15 minutes(2); for this reason, 
ketaime is useful only in short surgical procedures (usually those 
involving the head and neck where the use of an anesthetic mask is 
inconvenient) and for induction of anesthesia before switching to 
another anesthetic.  A number of problems associated with its use can 
further limit its therapeutic value: unsatisfactory muscle relaxation; 
increased muscle tone; unpredictable and sometimes violent jerking and 
twitching (which can be precipitated by otherwise relatively innocuous 
stimuli); vivid and unpleasant dreams during and after surgery; and slow 
recovery from anesthesia (up to several hours).  During the period of 
recovery, patients may experience headache, nausea and vomiting, 
hallucinations, feelings of unreality, confusion, and sensations of 
heaviness or floating.  Irrational behaviour may also occur.  
Hyperexcitablity (and sometimes convulsions) may be precipitated by mild 
stimuli for up to several hours after surgery.  These adverse effects are 
particularly common in patients over the age of 30; nonetheless, some 
patients find the hallucinogenic effects to be pleasant.  The incidence 
of adverse effects is low among children.

Ketamine has been subject to some abuse in both the United States and 
Canada.  Street preparations include powders, capsules, tablets, crystals 
and solutions.  Nonmedical users inject (estimated) doses of 50 mg or 
sniff between 60 and 100 mg.  At such levels, consciousness is usually 
maintained.  The main desired effects are euphoria and "mystical" 
revelations, as well as hallucinations and pleasant sensations of both 
floating and stimulation.  Users generally experience impairment of 
cognitive processes, dizziness, motor incoordination, slurred speech, and 
confusion.  Severe adverse episodes sometimes occur and resemble the toxic 
psychotic state caused by PCP.  The principle hazardous effect of high 
doses is respiratory depression.

There has been little research on the protracted nonmedical use of 
ketamine, and it is not known whether tolerance or dependance develops 
with regular use.  However, a number of regular users do experience 
"flashbacks".  In fact, there are reliable reports of some patients' 
experiencing recurrent hallucinations after ketamine anesthesia.


(1) In this context, disassociative means producing feelings in the user 
of disassociation from the external environment.

(2) Intense analgesia lasts for up to 40 minutes.

> As far as I'm concerned you're all racist ...

        I'll go along with that. Racism is a particular flavor of
"ethnocentrism". Ethnocentrism is the *universal human tendency* to
believe that whatever group you are a member of is the "best" group,
that your group does things "right", that other groups that are different
from you are at best "wrong" or "stupid" or if they oppose you are perhaps
"evil".

        To get past my own racism (ageism, nationalism, speciesism,
raverism, ...) I have to first acknowledge that it exists. Then I can
*start* to work on a little self-reprogramming. Yes, I'm a racist. But
at least I'm working on that.

Try taking some "Rip Fuel" & a glass of "Cytomax"
Found at a local GNC near you...


Then..  When that starts to wear off.  Take two doses of "Thermadrean"
You should have no problem raving all night long.

FOOD.  Otherwise your body just runs out of calories and dies.

However, anything heavy will divert energy towards digestion and away
from dancing; same problem.

Fruit is a good solution.  Bananas are nice and mushy and easy to
digest.  Fruit juice is good but too much on an empty stomach gets
acidic.  A big bunch of bananas and a quart of your favorite thick soupy
Odwalla admixture will keep you going for a LONG time.

Plus, make sure to have eaten well before you go, and drink lots of
water whilst there.  Borderline dehydration shows up as tiredness too.

Any proof of rape?

  I don't know man..   I could understand how this could happen at Home
Base or something..   But at a little house.    The way I see it, just my
opinion. In this little house, the only place you would get away w/ raping
someone, would have to be in the promoters private little room.  Know what
I mean?  I don't think everyone is just going to stand around and let this
shit happen. 
  But hey, sounds like no one knows for sure if this really happened..  So
some girls said she got raped, who knows, they were probably frying there
asses off too. They might of just thought she was raped.
  If it is true.  How did it happen? And why does no one in this little
house know who did it?

happy monday night everyone! :)
	I went to koinonea expecting a phat party, and my mind was 
blown! I agree that the sobriety level was incredible there, but 
sober or not, most EVERYONE had smile buzz ON.. not only smiles but 
LOVE too! 
	Everything was perfectly harmonious.. The drumming, the music 
being downstairs and the whole upstairs just a nice big chillin' vibe 
thing goin on.. I felt like I was with family, and for once didn't 
experience any negative vibes (i was lucky enough to avoid some of 
the negative guys but was disappointed to see tagging).. 
	Massive props to ALL the djs who spun, it was HARD to tear 
myself from the speakers but it must be done once in awhile :)) you 
guys are turning a junglist into a trancer ya know! :P 
	The Chai and water were perfect, no lines for either of these 
(which was great) and so was the fruit (i especially want to say 
THANX! to the guy who was running around slicing oranges!)! The 
location, I was surprised it didnt get busted but with no in/out 
privelages iI guess not as surprised.. I almost didn't get in after 
taking a dangerously lightheaded (cuz of the HEAT not drugs, mind 
ya'all) person outside.. =o but thanks for letting us back in whoever 
you are! :)
	All in all, the best party in a LONG time. Big BIG BIG props 
to the wonderful beautiful Koinonea kru for everything they did to 
make the night as spectacular as it was :) ANYWAYYY take care 
everyone and hope you have great weeks!
love hugs and a whole lotta smiles,
lara

	In my opinion, it hardly matters at all whether he
called the cops or not. Stabbing people is in a whole different
category from calling a bust in on a party. What are we, the
fucking Mafia code-of-silence talk-to-the-cops-and-you-deserve-

An excess of melanin?  Huh?  Excess?, and what constitutes that?  I contend
that one might use melanin rich, and conversley melanin chalenged.  Now,
THAT has a better ring to it.

The melanin is GOOD, one can never have enough of it. ;)  For real
scientific PROOF POSITIVE, I present the following as evidence, article 1:

"...I don't know, yeah, I'm just a rhyme sayer, skins proctected 'gainst
the ozone layer, breakdown 2001 it might be best to be black or just borwn,
COUNTDOWN!" - Public Enemy, Fear Of A Black Planet

article 2:

"...black man, black woman , black baby...white man, white woman, white
baby...black man , white woman, black baby...white man, black woman, black
baby...check it out!..." - Public Enemy, Fear Of A Black Planet

Now of course my science could be royally fucked IF these were the well
known Black Russians.  Then again, I thought a black russian was a drink.
Looking at article two it could very well be a "black" Russian, perhaps
someone who is bi-racial and Russian.  I hear that's been going around
these days. Or it could be the fabled minstrel russian.  You know, they put
on blackface and fuck people up.  Now I gotta see that...Al Jolsen mugs a
promoter. Mammy!

With plenty of ;)'s,
John

 I believe that this is the space where some UG trance parties have been 
held. It is operated by some very nice folks. Way helpful and kind!

I'd like to thank those of you who wrote to me in person on the list.  I'm
sorry for not writing many of you back.  I wish I had time to write to all.
My classes are quite heavy this quarter and I'm in the lab writing code
pretty much from dawn till bedtime.

The mail is pretty heavy and I'm a little disapointed esp. when people start
saying things like a girl was probably frying so hard she imagined she was
raped...  Sentiment like that really hits me hard even if the original post
was a rumour and whatnot.

I'll be back when my workload is lighter and I can contribute more to the list.

Keep the faith SF because it says a lot that friends of mine from New York
can come here and have a better time than they do in the big apple (props
out to MAD for one of the most pumping techno nights in the country!)

the zine? Would you take the time to download
and listen to samples? What about tracker files .XM and =
.XI...etc...sounds and loops and songs? Would you submit files if you =
were given the opportunity to share? (given proper credit of course)

	were also considering an art gallery..with fliers as well as any other =
art people care to see.  Would you care to see art? Would you send us =
art..digitally or by mail..if you were given the ability? Does this =
interest anyone? Let me know what you think.

	We want as much of the site to be open to contributions as possible. If =
you were able to add in any text you wanted...such as give your own =
angle on record reviews, articles, and what not? Any other ideas?

	This is gonna be a non profit thing..just something positive for "the =
community"...something fun to do and a good way to get involved in this =
sport =3D) also..if anyone wants to be a part of this..please give me an =
email!  Wed love whatever help you can give us =3D)

I'm hoping to turn the Monday Night Dinner into a monthly event,

so stayed tuned...

hello all-

the monday night dinner has passed through many iterations, and since my
monday night schedule has had some changes, i can no longer sponsor any
monday night dinners!

so, i encourage any and all individuals to sponsor a dinner at your house,
your favorite restaurant, wherever you wish to sponsor it.

i have quite enjoyed doing my share of dinners, as have diana g. and steve.

so, get out and sponsor your own!

love to you all-

The following post contains views and subject mater that might not be suitable for all readers.  
Open mindedness is suggested.

I was not sure I was going to post any information about this party on the net.  I always get my 
head chewed of every time I go out of my way to try and inform the people on this list about my 
events.   I debated for some time whether I was going to subject myself to the aggravation of 
having people misinterpret my intentions and actions and inevitably blow things completely out 
of proportion.  But because of my open mindedness, I decided to go with the benefit of the doubt 
and tell everyone who cares about our event.

The event on Feb 15th is going to be unlike any event we have ever produced.

It is our 5 year anniversary event.  We are going to take everything that we have learned in the 
past 5 years and apply a very generous application of PLUR into making an incredible party.  In 
my opinion, there is no substitute for experience, and there is no excuse for ignorance.   We 
are not holding anything back, this event will break new ground.

This event is all about love.  It is about giving, and sharing.   

It is really hard for me to put my feeling into words when it comes to something as passionate 
an meaningful as this.  All I can say is that this event is going to be like non before, and 
will hopefully set the pattern for other promoters to follow.   If you want to understand what I 
mean, you will just have to experience it for yourself.

The event is a benefit for the environment.  At the party will be tables set up by several non 
profit environmental activity organizations that will receive monetary donations from a portion 
of the proceeds from this party.  Yes StarChild, I said a portion, and NO I will not open up my 
books for anyone to review.  Please lets not start that discussion all over again. 
The better the party does, the more money we will donate.  Your support of this event will be 
directly reflected in our contribution the save our planet and aid in education about 
environmental problems.  It is something that we call - "Edutainment:  Educational 
Entertainment"  This is the direction that We will be focusing all our future events on.

I know that some of you have this certain stigma about "massive" and large parties in general 
for whatever reasons.  That is fine.  I respect your views, and would prefer that you kept them 
to yourselves, or e-mailed me privately.  But for those of you who have always wanted to 
experience a large party with the small party vibe, than don't miss this event.

A party is not measured by its size.  Size has become a barrier that is insinuated to be 
inversely proportional to the vibe of the party.  I can't understand how so many of you got 
suckered into believing this BS.   I believe that the problem lies in the fact that it takes a 
lot of very very very hard work and determination to create a large party with a good vibe.  And 
because it does take so much work, most promoters are more willing to perpetuate the mentality 
that you cannot have a good vibe at a large party, so therefore large parties do not have a good 
vibe.  This to me is the epitomy of laziness, and ignorance.  I don not only believe that large 
party can have a great vibe, I am going to prove it.
  
You see, the vibe is something that is created far before the party takes place.  It is a 
combination of: belief, attitude, motivation, concern, effort, and most of all; inspiration and 
vision.  When these factors collimate with good intentions, the vibe is created.  This is the 
vibe that people take with them to the party.  Vibe is not created by an event at all, it is 
expressed there.  The promoters job is to manifest to expectations that people bring with them 
into reality.  If this is done, then the vibe at the event will be better than good, it will be 
extraordinary.

You can not please everybody.  I used to think you could, and at one time it was possible, but 
the scene is very dynamic, and changes all the time.  Over the past 5 years of throwing parties 
and being involved in the scene, I have seen many changes and I have come up with many of my own 
conclusions as to what is needed to make a good party.  These beliefs will be self evident in 
our anniversary party on the 15th.    

I hope to get a chance to see everybody out there, sharing love, and rejoicing in the goodness 
created by our culture, spirituality, and energy. 

For all the info and DJ lineups and directions, check the SF Raves calendar, and dial the info 
numbers.  Leave me a message if you like or e-mail me.  I would love to hear your opinion or 
suggestions.

Attached is a copy of the Global Party Network News Letter that we sent out.  For those of you 
who do not understand what we are doing at Feel Good Entertainment, maybe this will bring you up 
to speed.

Global Party Network News Letter                  Issue #  2          Page # 1

Introduction

Dear Global Party Network Members, it is a new year and it looks like it is going to be a 
wonderful and positive year in all respects.  The purpose of this newsletter is to keep 
everybody informed about our upcoming plans as well as sharing information about topics that 
concern our scene and our culture.

The Past Five Years Were Just The Beginning 

It was a Thursday night on Valentine's Day, in 1992, when 200 people crowded into a small 
basement for the first event promoted by Feel Good Productions.  The name has now become Feel 
Good Entertainment, but the vision has not changed, and our mission is still to create positive 
events that make people FEEL GOOD.  Our parties are now safer, legal, more culturally 
diversified, always original, and virtually hassle free.
People often ask me, "What is FGE all about?"  Well, the answer is very simple.  We want to 
create a cohesive medium that culminates  Music, Dance, Spirituality, Expression, and Awareness, 
so that it promotes Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect for everything.  It means more than just 
throwing outrageous parties, it's producing incredible dance collectives for meaningful reasons.  
We are a dynamic organization with real concerns about our community, our culture, and the 
direction of the rave scene.  We work year-round on creating this cohesive medium that we called 
the Global Party Network.  By networking everyone's resources, we want to create a powerful 
organization that will maintain the integrity of the reason why we 'RAVE'.  This is what FGE is 
all about.   We are all the Rave Generation.  Lets keep it REAL.   

97 and Beyond 

The GPN (Global Party Network) has many aspects.  These include; The  Buzz-Line, Global Party 
Productions, The GPN News, GlobalParty.Com., the Membership Card Program, and YOU.  These are 
just some of the things that make up the GPN and much more is being worked on daily.  The 
following will hopefully bring everybody up to speed on the past, present, and future of  the 
GPN.   
Three years ago, we started the Buzz-Line.  This information resource is to help ALL promoters 
pass on their event info, and to help ALL ravers find out about all the parties and clubs.  We 
provide this service to spread the word about positive parties going on and to keep people 
informed and aware of our culture.  This service is free to you, but for us, it is expensive and 
time consuming to operate and maintain.  Sometimes 'Shit Happens' and it breaks down,  but we 
are still doing our best to make it even more reliable and dependable.   In the event that there 
are problems with the new number, 415-569-3300,  then please call the FGE info line @ 415-568-
1338 for updates or changes.   We plan on expanding the Buzz-Line with many surprises this 
year, so keep calling.
Global Party Productions is the engine that creates FGE events.  You are all members of the GPN, 
therefore Global Party Productions are parties for you.  Every one of our events is a growth 
experience.  With each party, we learn and improve the way we do things.  As always, we make 
sure that all of our events are positive for you, the community, and our culture.   We 
have always made some form of  donation to non-profit organizations, whether the event made a 
profit or not.  It is our ultimate goal to eventually expand Global Party Productions into a 
'Benefactory' collective, producing 100% beneficial events for our community.  This might still 
be a ways down the road but we plan on setting up our events so that each time we are able to 
contribute more, until we reach our goal.   This will give all of our events a method of 
channeling the positive vibe created at the parties into a meaningful direction.   Makes me FEEL 
GOOD just thinking about it.
What you are reading now is our second issue of the Global Party Network News.  We hope that 
this grows and becomes something informative and meaningful as a regular periodical of the 
network.  In future issues, we would like to see articles contributed by some members of the 
GPN.   Your comments, views, and questions are always welcome.  Please feel 
free to submit any articles, stories, poems, or artwork to us anytime.  If you have something 
you want to share with us, please fax it to 415-654-9354, or send it to Feel Good Entertainment,  
951 Old County Rd.  Suite # 217, Belmont, CA.  94404.
By summertime, the GPN will be online.  Our domain is registered @ WWW.GlobalParty.Com.   We 
will let you know as soon as it is ready.   If you want to contribute to our website, please 
leave a message on our voice mail. 
The GPN is like a support mechanism for our rave community.   Many of you already have the 
membership card, most of you don't.  If you did not pick yours up at Megga-Buzz, they will be 
available at the GPN booth at Love A-Fair on Feb 15th.   The card program will get you discounts 
at clubs, parties, food, merchandise, and other services that support the GPN.  It is just 
our way of saying thanks for your support.  Keep calling the Buzz-Line for updates.  
This is just the beginning of the GPN.  We have a lot of incredible ideas on how to create our 
network.  It will take a lot of hard work and a great deal of support.  By working together we 
can accomplish more than our wildest dreams.  Lets show the world the power of  RAVING. 

A Very Special Celebration of Unconditional Love.

How much do you love raving?  Does raving love you back?  What does it mean to you?   What do 
you get out of it?  Is it about the music, the dancing, the energy, the spirituality, the 
people, or the whole scene?  Why do you do it?  The answers to these questions are the reasons 
for this party.    In our own individual ways, we all have an intimate love affair 
with raving.  It means a lot more to us than just partying or dancing, it is the ritualistic 
devotion and dedication that makes us all feel good about ourselves when we know that our 
partying has a positive message, that it has a purpose,  a deeper meaning, and a direction.  
That is what creates our love affair with raving. 	
Valentine's is a reason to express love and affection.  This Valentine's, lets share our 
unconditional love.  Our five year birthday party is a festival dedicated to environmental 
awareness and consciousness.  A portion of our proceeds will be donated to several non-profit 
environmental activity programs.  Lets show our love for Mother Earth by helping to 
conserve our natural resources and  to protect our only planet. 
This party will be set up like a small festival, or like a FAIR (get it??)    We do not want to 
give away all the surprises, but I'll put it like this -  we are putting a lot of passion into 
this party.  It is our five year anniversary and we aren't going to do anything short of 
spectacular to celebrate this event.  We have a wonderful, fully permitted, centrally located, 
indoor and outdoor, Bay Area location.  Take a look at the flyer and read it carefully - this 
party is going to break new 
ground.  As always, we are going to do our best to create a large party with the small party 
feel.  We will do our part and set up the event, but you are the one that will set the vibe, so 
please come prepared to share your love with everybody, and it will turn out to be a very 
memorable night full of fun, excitement, and absolutely excellent music.
	We have enclosed a special gift for all GPN members.  It is a cutaway coupon on the bottom 
of the flyer.  This is just a small way to show you our love and appreciation for your support.  
We look forward to seeing you all on Feb 15th.  Get there early, or you might miss some of the 
incredible surprises that we have in store for you, and please recycle the flyer by sharing it 
with a friend. 

Tagging - Its Not Cool At All !!!! 

Graffiti is Art, but Tagging is Vandalism.  It's destroying our scene.  Here is a list of 
locations that will never again be used for raves because of tagging; Cow Palace, Richmond 
Civic, Henry J. Kaiser, Vallejo & Sonoma County Fairgrounds, Fashion Center, Concourse, 
Galleria, Santa Cruz Civic, and many more.  It costs the rave scene money by making raves 
more expensive, and gives us a bad image by giving society the wrong impression.  Please protect 
and respect our scene, as well as the art form of graffiti  by  putting an end to tagging before 
we run out of places to have raves.   Please spread the word.

Editorial  (Just My View on Things) 
 
Music is has a special way of distinguishing people and separating generations.  The 60's gave 
us Hippies.  In the 70's it was Disco.  The 80's brought us Rock and Roll, and now it's the 
90's, and everybody is raving to house music.   Raving is becoming  more and more accepted every 
day.  What started as underground music and parties has grown to become a major influence in our 
lifestyles and attitudes.  Some things, such as the spread of  Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect 
(PLUR) are good for society, and we feel proud about this positive contribution from our 
culture.  Other things, such as the exploitation of the culture by mainstream capitalization, 
are less appealing.  We can't sit around and wish for things to get better, because they won't.  
However, our attitudes, participation, and behavior can influence the expansion of raving 
in a more positive direction, bettering society.  We have a very unique heritage, and it would 
be a shame if it was forgotten or misunderstood.  It is up to each one of us to figure out what 
we can do to influence society's perception of our generation.  It's no longer 'Just Do It', 
it's about doing it the right way for all the right reasons.  Lets show our pride.  This is our 
time.  We are the Rave Generation.

Dear Friends,

NetAction, the Institute for Global Communication, and Media Alliance are
co-sponsoring a four-week workshop on how to be a Virtual Activist.

The workshop will be held in San Francisco, beginning March 3, for activists
interested in learning how to use the Internet effectively for organizing,
advocacy, and outreach.  Classes are scheduled for four consecutive Mondays,
March 3, 10, 17, and 24, from 6:30-9:30 p.m. at Media Alliance, 814 Mission
Street, Suite 205.

The workshop is designed specifically for people who want to learn how to
make better use of the Internet for organizing, advocacy, media outreach,
building membership, education, and fund raising.  Participants should have
some experience using a computer, but previous online experience is not
required.

The first two sessions will be an overview of the basics of the Internet,
including selecting an Internet service provider, using E-mail and Web
browsers, and more advanced tools.  The last two sessions will focus on how
to make use of these tools for activism, including fund raising and
membership building, with examples of successful strategies.

Online homework will be assigned and temporary Internet access accounts may
be available on a case-by-case basis for students who need them.

It's not a PBC program, but it's syndicated on some PBS stations. If you're
really burning in the britches for it, write to aleph@underground.org --
his roommate produces that program, and it's called "The Internet Cafe".
It's taped every monday (i think!) at Cybersmith or whatever in Palo Alto.
Otherwise, call KCSM-60 in San Mateo... They have it on tape.

I did appreciate the plea for less tagging. Since your parties attract
taggers like flys to flypaper, I guess that's a big problem for you. I
fixed that by not having any friends that are taggers and only inviting
friends and their friends to parties. And If I ever found someone tagging
my space I would bust their fucking heads in. Taggers are a bunch of tiny
dick busters, and they know it.
There's some PLUR they can understand!

But I guess you can't not invite the busters when you're running an
operation that is founded on maximizing your return-on-investment, and hey,
you know what? Your parties are full of 'em!

That return-on-investment stuff comes with such baggage! Buster baggage!

Glad that money isn't the reason why I have parties!

But feel free to make a million by strip-mining our scene.
You weren't the first and you won't be the last.

:-(

ps: Each time I see you write "PLUR", it sounds as nice to my ears as if
you were saying "FUCK."
How about that.

This was a really neat party considering it was the first rave thrown by US
Eternal Ent.  The lighting was superb, the sounds were very nice, and
everyone had their best smile on.  The few problems that I noticed was the
VMB which didn't give the right directions to the map point and the map
point which didn't give the right directions to the party, good thing I've
been to that place before so I really didn't get lost.  Then there was the
girl who had too much LSD and was supposedly raped and started freaking out
which abruptly ended the party at around 5:00am.  No matter what we do
there are going to be assholes in our scene.  I can deal with the drunks,
the gangsters, the snobs, but I CAN NEVER DEAL WITH RAPISTS!  A RAVE ISN'T
A PLACE TO GET LAID PEOPLE!  That person is guilty of either 2 kinds of
rape statutory(sp?) rape and raping someone who is intoxicated...  Oh well,
 I feel sorry for the girl but I also believe that she has to take
responsibility for her actions and she should have at least known a little
better before putting any substances in her body.  The other bad part to
this was her friends abandoned her when she started getting attention from
everyone.  SOME FRIENDS THEY ARE!  People, if you know that your friend is
on drugs please, please be sure to watch over them for their 6-12 hour trip
if you are their real friend.  I have guided a lot of people throughout
their trips on LSD and E and a lot of other drugs and I make sure I am
there for them whenever they need help be it getting a drink of water or
just giving a warm hug to give that fuzzy E feeling.  Anyway,  I'm done
bitching for now.  I hope that this becomes a learning experience for
everyone for years to come.  

Have a nice day!

Dear Mr. NStuff,


> Any proof of rape?

Please read below so that I can correct your ignorance.  If I were ever
raped, I certainly would not want to have a friend with your cavalier
attitude about the subject.

I'd just like to inform you that a rape can occur in a large room, in a
small room, outside, inside.  The size of the place does not matter.
Especially when people are VERY unwilling to get involved with
interactions between other people.  For your information women are taught
to scream fire instead of rape in order to get help. And why is it so
unbelievable that this would happen at a small rave when a certain aspect
of raves is a tolerance of more expressed sexuality.  This just makes it
more likely that people won't get involved.

That is the typical excuse that has been used for decades, "She was too
_________(insert varying intoxicants here) to know what she was doing,
therefore she couldn't have been raped."  Or, "She deserved it due to
________ (1-dressing sexy, 2-I know she wanted it).  The only thing I can
imagine worse than being raped would be being raped on acid.  And I don't
really think someone would imagine a trauma like that.  

Of course, women have responsibity too, and I am not a supporter of "we're
all victims."  But, Mr. NStuff, your attitude is the purveyor of a larger
ignorance about this crime, and I think you should do some intelligent
re-thinking.

And, I'd like to remind you, MEN can be raped as well as women, and it is
NOT as rare as you might think.  And, most people are raped by
acquaintances whom they trust.  And, yes, rape can be hard to prove, but
I"d like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  And, people do cry
wolf, which is really terrible and makes you not want to give people the
benefit of the doubt.  

Just, please, don't be so cavalier about such a serious topic.  The girl
was only 15.  That's sure a nice way to grow up.  Shit like this happens
and then we bitch about all the negative media raves get.  Well, rave have
a seriously shady side, don't you think??  I personally feel really sorry
for that girl, and especially her parents.  What a terrible thing to have
happen.  My worst nightmare is about being raped.  

That's all I have to say on the topic.  I cc'd this to the list because it
is a problem that needs to be addressed in the rave scene, but moreso in
society in general.

Coming to your Frequency Modulation dial somewhere between 87 and 107
Megahertz is MRAU, the latest radio fad... [Rave Alternative-Underground
radio, the music formerly known as techno]

That's right, we are determined to challenge the commerical "alternative"
scene with a whole bunch of commercial "underground" material. You ask,
"how can it be underground if it's commercial"? Our investors asked the
same question and we answered, "Who would have ever thought that
"alternative" would be commercialized? We don't want to miss out on the
oppurtunity of commercializing the underground and we want your help"...

So, after receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from companies and
individuals, whose ethics and moral practices reflect absolutely nothing of
the ideals of the rave sub-culture from whence the majority of music comes
from, we feel we are now fully prepared to bring the underground to the
mainstream...

Flip around on your FM dial until you find us... Then listen to all of our
wonderful adverstisements for products and services which are intended to
fully take advantage of the "average" american consumer and transmutate
them from normal less than productive americans into full blown candy-raver
slackers. Also keep your ears peeled for our new radio endeavors:

WRCU Rave-Country Underground (formerly known as gabber)
WRSU Rave-Soul Underground (currently "dance music format radio")
WRRU Rave-Rock Underground (also includes some not so well known
"industrial" acts like Nitzer Ebb, Front 242, Ministry and NIN)
WRGU Rave-Gospel Underground (our biggest risk, religous rave music)
WRCU Rave-Classical Underground (formerly experimental)
WRPU Rave-Pillow Underground (formerly known as ambient)
WREU Rave-Elavator Underground Musak (formerly known as house music)
WRJU Rave-Jazz Underground (formerly known as acid jazz)

The possibilities are endless. Stay tuned for more details...

Hey Sean... yeah I spoke to this lovely woman who is running this space
with her partner (a big friendly guy) and they said that they spent 3
months sage-ing & smoking the place out to get rid of the speed vibes and
now they want to open it to raves and theatre events. They even cleaned up
the space after the party! It was included in the price!

I've heard of DJ Keoki, the one that goes by "superstar DJ Keoki"  If
so, he's pretty huge back east, maybe here, too.
who had many CD's out under I what I seem to remember "moonshine music"
by any chance is this a Typo or a moniker of his name?

This space is cool, but the the outlits are faulty and its unsafe.  My
friend got shocked and burned pretty bad there at Golden Gate a couple
weekends ago.

While I was spin'n the power would flicker this black light on and off.  So
if they fix that stuff it would be cool.  But until then I think it
unsafe...

With the spate of recent busts, do we think it is wise to go about listing
the address and detailed descriptions about available spaces.  This is
a public forum, anyone can read it easily enough.  The lack of
spaces is problem enough without advertising "Here's our address, come
bust us!!"   Information is good, but there is such a thing as TOO
much of a good thing in this case.  Secrecy isn't all bad. :\  

I dunno, just my thought.

-KaySEE

p.s. My advice is probably the same on the recent influx of "I did E at
this party and my friend did it at this party."  Think about who you
are advertising too.  On sfraves we feel like we can trust one
another, and I like to think of it that way.  But, one should still be
careful.  Email *is* considered written evidence, and it is starting to 
find it's way into more court cases.  I'm not being paranoid, just 
realistic.  Until we reach legalization, sometimes the best thing
said is unsaid. :)  Please, don't consider this admonishment, just a few
thoughts and advice.  I am personally not bothered by such talk, sometimes
rather interested in fact.

Hey Jeff (MrNstuff)

That was not kewl of you to send the post to SFR and to me if you have
something to say you should say it to me, For you info my party did not take
place in a "little house" It was at the 24 street dance studio and one of the
rooms was closed I am not sure if it was locked or not? But at any rate that is
not the point, Rape is wrong and I nor my prod. team or Dutch or the Mantra
sound system condon that, in your post it is as if you are saying we had almost
something to do with it. How so far from the truth you are, and for those of
you who were there like Anthony E you know what the real story is. We took one
of the girls home cause she was triping and did not realy have any where to go
her supposed FRIENDS left her at the party so we let her chill with us to end
and then took her home at a approate time. So before you go off half cocked you
should get all the facts from people who were on the scene. Sorry for the waste
of bandwith all but I just hate people to say or assume shit when they don't
have a clue of what they are talking about. Now as far as the young lady is
conserned I will be contacting one of her "friends" this week to find out what
realy happened.
And Jeff it is nothing personal with you Just contact me if you need correct
info.

Peace and love all-

Macadio

1) Having sex with a minor is statutory(sp?) rape.

2) Even if she was over 18 she was still intoxicated, and having sex with
someone who is intoxicated is rape.  


Thank you, drive thru....

that's the problem... everyone was so fucking into themselves that they
were crowding the people who were there to DANCE. (me =) I've never seen a
"main room" with more than 3/4 of the people standing around with their
hands in their pockets-- how dull! That bagok crowd can't party for shit! I
guess most of the blame falls on the promoters themselves... I went to this
party fully expecting a bust; how could they have expected a party to go
off all night in the middle of a residential neighborhood? And how could
they have expected to cram 500 people into that dinky little frat house?
YUCK.

        So some girls said she got raped, who knows, they were probably frying
        there asses off too. They might of just thought she was raped.
        If it is true.  How did it happen? And why does no one in this little
        house know who did it?

I can't believe you are questioning her.  You know when you have been
raped.  Especially if you are on a psychedelic.  Psychedelics make you more
aware rather than numb.  I hardly think this 15 year old girl is making
this up.  This is very serious to the rave community,  especially if she
goes to her parents with this information.

What was a 15 year old girl doing at a party in the first place.  I thought
parties were a space for adults 18 and up to rave and be children.  People
wonder why the older crowd is not interested in coming to raves anymore.
Well personally I love to rave and although I look very young, I feel very
uncomfortable taking drugs with 15 year old little girls around.

The other thing I wanted to comment on was I have personally oberserved
promoters and dj's using their "status" to convince little girls in high
school to come to the "promoters room" or car and give blow jobs.  I have
listened to the dj/promoters brag about it and the little girls talk about
doing it and then disappointed later in the way their relationship is with
the male.  This isn't rape but it certainly is taking advantage of one's
role in the scene to prey on girls under the age of 18.  Little girls who
are allowed to come to these parties idolize these older players and with
the ideals in mind for throwing a party should be treated with respect
When they are used as objects of play for their fascination for the evening
they are struck with a different view of PLUR than most people get from the
parties.

This is the behavior that the media and cops are looking for and someday
when one girl screams rape... the rave scene is going to fall fast.

Yes, I thought of this factor KC, but I think it is important to
distinguish the two DIFFERENT spaces on Stevenson so that the good people
who run the other space (b/n 5th & 6th) don't get boycotted. Things get
awfully confusing and rumor-infested around here and I was trying to clear
things up a little...and I do agree that secrecy is good and very much
needed with all the crazy things that have been happening lately....also I
agree that bragging about E exploits on here is not such a good thing - the
whole world does not need to know...and its better for each of us to 'keep
our heads down' a little - to be a little DISCRETE (sp?)....

... I appreciate your comments....

... have a peaceful day....

True true. Legally speaking, yes.

I disagree. Taking advantage of the fact that someone is intoxicated
for the purposes of forcing sex upon on them, on the other hand, is
rape. Ohterwise, I know many people (including myself) who could have
been arrested for perfectly innocent and consentual sexual situations.

Just thought I'd add a little clarity to this brewing flame war...;)

Maybe you should volunteer an hour of your time, to help clean, work the
door, stock toilet paper, or help set up or break down, or decorate--
show up early and ask if you can help!

I'm down for that, also if you need any drummers, I can exchange music
and/or work if I can get comp' ed.

Peace,

Goldilox

OK good, because I hope it's pretty clear that I wouldn't condone their
actions under any circumstances-- It just makes them seem like even more of
a pack of assholes when you take into account the fact (according to
thomas) that they assaulted him WHILE he was explaning that he hadn'g
gotten the cops involved.

Ooops, should have read a bit more. 15, and on psychedelics? Yep,
that seems pretty suspect... That girl needs better parents. Any kid
that age doing heavy drugs and involved in situations like that is
on a one way trip to *nowhere*.

Raped or not, situations like that are *exactly* what those 20/20 and
Leeza shows are talking about: young kids getting fucked up on drugs
at raves and damaging their lives forever. No thanks; I will have no
part in that.

You kids can have your drug parties.

Steve

Damn Ray,

   There shore is alot of hostile, negative people in our scene isn't
there.
 I sure would like to hear atleast one of these people explain, what
exactly it is about FGE they find so repulsive..  But I bet it would not
make much sence anyways. And, ofcourse it would be full of self centered
opinions, I am sure.
 Welp.  I will be at Love Affair (you know this people)..  
 And all my friends will be there too..    Huh Adam?  heheee..   =]:.. .

 Your going to have the fat 50,000Sq. Ft. section open right? (Anybody that
hasn't seen this room, must go!)
  There will be plenty of room to dance, heh?   =]
  There will be like, some trippy visuals nStuff to?
  If some blows a speaker now, remember. Instead of turning the music down.
Disconnect the blown speaker! Damnit.. Hehee..   }:\
  Oh, and uh..  Plenty of them Christal Gyser thingies?
  Oh yea and, we need places to rest our butts..  We need padding!   HOme
BAse ravEs usually never have "soft" chill rooms..
  Bathrooms inside aswell as out are a plus.  Might rain yanno.

  Lets make sure everyone has there plain tickets now. And the security is
all payed off too.. (Demanding huh?)

  It's going to be one hellOfa night.! No matter what though. Damnit.!

Gee..  I hope you don't make no money though.  Then people might not hate
you guys as much huh?  Hah.

Thats it.
Jeff

Hmm,

	Yes, there are stipulations and factors as to who can do what to
whom...  Ravers are younger nowadays, I see many @ the age of  fifteen
to seventeen...  One of my friends got "snagged" by a gal who said she
was nineteen.  Allthough mature and a very nice person, deception was
conveied (she is sixteen)...  So it can be a double edge sword...
	If your young and doing drugs, please be responsible.. Your
carelessness is what will cause this scene to disintergrate into a
swirling mass of negativity and confusion.  People have to take in
consideration that drugs, which loosen inhibitions, can also cause you
to lose control... Please keep control when on whatever.  Or at least
have someone around to act as your common sense when you're "out there".
	And to those who take advantage of these children... If I were to run
across someone forcing themselves onto a female...  Well, let's just say
I defend my scene.  An act of aggresson like that (and that's all rape
is, an act of hostile aggression) would make U an enemy in my book. 

 And I don't _have_ enemies.

I'm saddened to hear about what happened @ Odyssey, and cautious as my
little sister will become more involved in the scene (after HS
graduation)...  But at the same time I am releived to hear about such
positive corispondence in regards to making proactive measures so such a
incident does not occur in our scene again...

the promoters doing Osmosis have asked me to post this to SFRaves...

OSMOSIS is not happenning! Mirage is no more due to internal conflicts or
something...


however, the party originally known as "osmosis" will be split up into two
other parties, with the same dj's...


One will be called "ROSA," and will feature dj's Ryan Cimino, Shoam vs.
Bonnie (on 4 tables), the a.r.m crew, and centipide (benji). It will be on
Saturday the 8th and the info line number is 707-329-2189.


I don't know much about the other one, but it will have the rest of the
osmosis dj's and the info line number is 415-458-3177, I believe.



take care,

Bla, bla..  Bla.    Bla, bla bla bla. Bla.


 I am ingnorant maybe. I admit, I did not read the whole post.. No time for
that.  Had to delete a hundred junk mails..
 Yet, agian.. I have no time to read all of your mail..  
  But anyways. You don't have to worry.. You don't have me as your friend. 
And I certantly would not want to subject you to such a horrible thing,
such as myself.

  As far as MY friends..  They do not have to worry..  If I see them
introuble.. I will be more than "willing" to help.  And that pretty much
means anyone I know, and do not know..  No girl at my party would get away
with saying rape, and be ignored. I would be less disturbed if someone said
"fire". And no one I know would brush off some girl saying rape in a dark
corner of the room..

 From what I did read, it sounded like no one knew for sure if she was
raped. I said that maybe her friends (the informants) were just tripping.. 
I never said that she didn't know what she was doing. I never said that
most rapes are initiated by the female. Your putting words in my mouth. 
There is no excuse for assulting someone.
 I don't blame no one for this. But I also know that. It wouldn't happen at
my party. Expecially in such a small space to control..  

But as far as me..  You can think what you want.. Everyone else does.. Your
no different. Preach on brother KC. Tell us how things really are.. Cast
your superior judgement opon me.. I got to go back to work now..

The story in a nutshell:

The girl was 15.  It was at a dance studio, not at someone's house.

It's my understanding, having chatted with someone who just spoke to 
someone connected with the promoters and then getting confirmation
from one of the promoters, that the girl was freaking on 2.5 hits of 
acid, had gotten into the room where people were allowed to toss 
their backpacks and stuff, and had decided to turn into Nature Girl 
by removing all her clothes except her bra, and then proceeded to 
scream her head off.  She was completely out of her mind, and no one 
could restrain or help her.  The promoters tried to get her under 
control but could not approach her.  She would alternate between
inviting them to do various things to her, and then attacking anyone 
that got within a few feet of her.  The cops showed up at some point 
and called an ambulance for the girl.  The EMT had a helluva time 
getting the girl's clothes back on.  She had to be restrained, loaded 
into the ambulance, and taken to the psych ward at the hospital.  The 
whole question of rape came from the fact that some schmo left a used 
condom in the same room, but there's no proof of rape - yet.  As for 
the promoters, they were in a bind because they couldn't locate the 
girl's friends or anyone to take responsibility for the girl.

So that's the story.  Ignoring the possibility of rape for a moment, 
may I state an opinion?

Where the hell were the 15 year old girl's parents?  What the hell 
was a LITTLE GIRL doing at a party?  Perhaps it behooves the more 
responsible promoters to start throwing parties where there is
an age limit.  At 15, you're hardly able to recognize the virtues of
moderation.  At 15, you'll trust anyone, believe anything, put just
about any kind of crap into your system, and all the while thinking
it'll just be a fun ride the whole way, that you're invincible, that
all the bad things you hear about can't happen to you.  Fast forward
to the hospital where your stomach is being pumped, your parents 
are sitting nearby in tears, and your friends are being questioned or 
even arrested by the police.

I won't assume even for a moment that I'll get total consensus on
this, but if I were her father, I wouldn't have given her permission
to go to such a party.  I would want to know where the hell she 
got acid, who gave it to her, and where they live [flash to scene
of large man grabbing scrawny punk by the neck and threatening
to break him in half if he ever got near his daughter again], and
then I'd ground her until she was 50, with her first chance at 
parole in about a month.

I'm a 32 year old man, and I know enough at this age that, IF I
take a substance, then when I take a substance, be it anything 
between caffiene all the way up to E, I take only enough to get
the desired effect.  I assure you that freaking out naked at a 
large party is NEVER the desired effect.  At 18 you *might* 
start having some idea that sometimes less is more.  At 15 you 
can barely wipe your butt and keep your room clean at the same 
time.

		WHERE WERE HER PARENTS?

The episode is TIC 105, "Electronic Communities" -- call 1-800-916-PCTV (I
didn't make that up), and it can be yours for $24.95.

When I first saw the Internet Cafe show on Friday, I somehow presumed that
others knew about it or that it would be shown again (most PBS affiliates
repeat shows often).

But, as I posted on Friday night:

>my VCR worked

Depending on interest level, I'll have a "formal" showing at my place in
Berkeley sometime within a week or so, and can lend it out to people.

The context of the show was this -- a half-hour program on virtual
communities in cyberspace, featuring a women's community, some other
on-line group I can't remember, and Ethan talking about Fnf, sfraves, the
hyperreal web-site & raving for about 4 1/2 minutes (with interspersed
shots of the Fnf & hyperreal web-sites).

        More people should explore the rhythmic pleasure you receive from
dancing to drum and bass at parties..I think the real reason people haven't
caught on yet, is because they still think that it's just really fast,
frantic breakbeat music, when they never really, really actually listened to
it before..The stepping and rolling blends are the new funk breakbeat sound
of the 90's, and if you actually listen to how the music breaks, then you
will see that it is also very danceable....Food 4 Thought:)

Peace...

This is not entirely true.  It is illegal, but not always considered rape.

Um, that's sister KC, and a very lovely, very intelligent

it affects it's victims, I'd take it seriously.

not to carry this on any longer but I think that you are still talking 
about the galatic tunnel space (this is total speculation), but I do know 
that the space ran mentioned doesn't have any exposed wiring or blatant 
safety hazards...it's on stevenson between 5th/6th, galatic tunnel place 
is btwn 6th/7th, are there any other space being used on stevenson 
recently?  anyone?

Since I am way beyond green to the atmosphere out here I will REFRAIN from
commenting on any parties that I have no clue about but I do want to say
that the experience given here is just what I am trying to avoid when I
manage to get out.  Its why I always ask the wonderful people on this list
before I go to some event.  Im sure Everyone on this list (including me)
has a horror story to tell about how they were clueless and ended up at
some shitty party with 2 people dancing and everyone else staring.  Isnt
there something we can do about this?  I was going to go real
philosophical on this but instead Id like to hear what other people have
to say about the subject.  Im bringing a number of new people to raves
lately and we have a good time cause I know how to find events that wont
be disasters.  But many people (including me a few years back) dont have
the benefit of help in choosing.  How do we keep the good people from
getting discouraged by bad raves?

- David

who just cant believe some of the things he's heard about the scene here
lately.  Sheesh.

ok...I figured that...what are the operational costs? besides the obvious
things like staff and records...

also...there seems to be lots of space on the dial for another station in
the bay...what does it take to get a number?

How about pirate radio?...how much can you get away with?

what kind of crap are you going to get from the fcc?

The cloud house party last Sat. in Oaktown went off!!!

I was happy to see all of the good posts about the _Koinonea_Sp? party. 
Because the Cloud House party was on the same level.  Absolutely amazing
energy flowed through this rather small party of about 200 ppl.  My
cheeks were actually sore from smiling too much, and this is not an
exaggeration.  It is really good to see that there is still a lot of
good left in the scene: whether it be the people, promoters or dj's.

Free water and lotsa toilet paper.  BUST FREE! and happy people.  No bad
vibes or fights.....well actually there was one...but it had nothin to
do with the party. ;) for those that know what i'm talking about.  :P 
It was just a warm and cozy party.  There were even two impromptu
circles where everyone held hands and danced around together.

The cloud factory group, like others, have gotten it right.  Anyone who
hasn't been to a Cloud Factory party should definitely check one out and
see what it is all about.

I truly love the scene and am quite happy to see it survive through all
of the BS that goes on, because there will always be BS.

:)

CloudFactory always finishes first in my book!  They seem to have their
act together and the ravers that show-up are the warm-fuzzy-lovable
people that are fun to talk and dance with.

Here's to high production values,

the whole idea of the relative danger for kids under eighteen going to
parties and being taken advantage of is very distressing to me, as i
started partying at fourteen, and have only fairly recently turned
eighteen. if you see someone young who seems to be an inexperienced raver
who may attract the kind of {evil} people who would take advantege of
her/him, then keep an eye out!! nothing has ever happened to me, though
several people have tried to take advantage of me when they thought i was
too high to handle myself. fortunately, that has never been the case,
and i was able to stop those encounters from becoming far more serious. 
it concerns me that inexperienced partiers may not know enough about the
drugs they take to ensure their own safety. this stems from a lack of
easily available information, and though i don't have a solution to that
problem aside from more responsible drug education in scholls or through
parent/ community relationships, it is possible for those of us who have
more experience and knowledge to look out for those that seem to be in
a potentially dangerous place.
with love often comes responsibility.
love as always,
****allegra****

The key word for me is "funk", I like it just as much as anyone, and when

  My lady and I have recently taken up dancing -- ballroom, for the most
part, including the traditional Latin steps -- cha-cha, samba, rumba, etc. 
-- plus some of the modern dance club moves (salsa, swing, the retro
hustle, etc.). I'm looking for some good contemporary mixes by Latino djs
with interesting, up-tempo rhythms and riffs. Any suggestions? 
  Many thanks!

The issue of age limits at parties has come up several times today.

Where do we set the cutoff 16? 18? 21???

At times I almost wish there was a limit, but this would most definitely
change the scene. Our scene is based on FAMILY, young and old alike. When I
started partying at age 15, there were people who always watched out for
everyone (i.e. giving out candy, helping people through a bad trip,
whatever.). Now at age 22, I try to do the same for the younger kids on the
scene. Unfortunately, the kids seem different than all the kids I partied
with when I was young.

Its kinda sad that I took it for granted, but part of that family vibe is
gone. Now we are trying to keep the younger kids out of the scene, which
may be good for us now, but what happens in a few years when we start
dropping out of the scene and there's no one left.

The moral of this stupid story is... keep an eye out for the kids. I think
that all of us have had someone watch over US at one time or another. Keep
the circle going. Show the kids what the vibe is and just maybe they'll
pass it along.

Anyways,

dnns

C ya at Strawberry Sundaes (we're working on some special guests... i'll

If you're so concerned about this, then you should check yourself on
your own usage as well. Why did you need to say they were "white jewish
guys" -- didn't "white" suffice? perhaps you just thought they were
jewish because they had "new york" accents? Or were they wearing
yarmulke's and tvilin and peyes (i.e. orthodox jewish garb) so that it
was clear that they were jewish, rather than, say eastern european or
italian or whatever other nationality/races people sometimes confuse
with "jewish"... Did you know there are chinese, hispanic, "arabic" and
black jews? What's "white" have to do with it?

Other than this, i'd have to agree with the points you made -- I see
often that the media loves to portray people of color as "criminals",
to the extent that they go out of their way to show pictures of the
suspects, especially if they're "of color". For example in the
chronicle and/or SJ Mercury  article about the guys that have been
apprehended for blowing up the solano county courthouse -- they just
had to put a small picture of the suspect on the front page, just so
you know what color he is. 

PS: And by the way, from now on, I want y'all to talk HEBONICS to me...
it sounds something like this ...

	PLUR SHMUR ... 
	I think I'm going to kvetch.
	One more word of this, and i think I'm gonna retch.

	I'm rappin' tvilin like Bob Dylan,
	Like milk and honey, that rhyme.
	You make my head like calendar and I don't have the time!

	I'm in the mix-a with my shicksa,
	Dancin' the hora with the hoes.
	So I just don't need yo comment bout the size o' my nose! 

	Say Oy!
	Say Oy!
	Rap a little harder Jew boyeee...

Don't you all know that all mailing lists turn into a blatant
Race/Sex/Religion discussion?  It's really annoying. So are these brand
new subjects for y'all that you think you need to enlighten us with your
newly found wisdom?  C'mon. All these wonderful "points" you think you
are making have been made already, including what I am saying. 

I am not interested in hearing what you have to say unless you were
actually there (thank you to those few who told us the real stories) 

Look beyond yourself and subsequently if someone describes someone else
as being "black" "jewish" "gay" don't get offended.  You belong to
groups of people no matter what. Be proud and quit obsessing on it.

I dunno if any of y'all have been down south lately, but in the Santa =
Monica area there is a redio station that plays house, techno, jungle, =
trance, and trip-hop 24 hrs. a day...

And it's not any of the "Wild 107 type" cheesy, commercialized stuff =
either...=20

They call themselves "Groove Radio", and they're at 103.1FM, next time =
you're anywhere near there...  and they have a website where you can =
listen to them through real audio..

http://www.grooveradio.com

If anyone here does listen to Wild 107, you may have heard about their =
newest mixing DJ who calls herself "The Mixstress"...  this is where =
they "found" her...

I would really like to know what you guys feel about having a radio =
station committed strictly to our scene...  Can this be considered =
"commercialization" when the top priority is to get the message of PLUR =
out to as many people as possible?  After all, to run a radio station, =
you need money; and to make money, you have to sacrifice a little (in =
this case- keeping it underground).

much hugs,
doughboy

Apparently there are several AON remix CD's out - I heard one last
night called "Art of Noise - The Drum & Bass Mixes" which was very
sweet. I heard there's also an Ambient Mix CD and another one which
I forget now.

canned donations for Food Not Bombs.

The DJ lineup is as follows:

Oh please. Art of Noise were the shit back in the '80s. But there is =
no way their stuff sounds like it was made yesterday. AON pretty much =

Hey all!

Shawna here, back from the dead, for those of you who noticed.  Boy what a
long strange trip it's been.  I signed off of sfraves a month or two ago,
finally got my ass back on again to see what's up.  I've finally gotten
myself out of Concordland, Fabled Land of Circle Dancers ;) and closer to an
area I want to live in, and also got a new computer in the process which
took a while to get going, and an SO magically fell in to my lap, so I've
really been out of the loop for a long time.  So now I'm pretty much settled
in, and have my new computer up & running, and said SO is off doing SO-ish
things, so time to come back to sfraves & see what goes on.  Hello to all
you old people who are still here (those oldsters who're still here speak
up!) (SDream, you still out there hon?) (Steve Simitzis I miss you!!)
(Wayne, you're just exactly as Crusty as when I left, and thank you for
dragging me out to play that very first time, definitely got the ball
rolling!) (Matt L, I have a picture of us from the church rave and we look
beautiful! :) (knucklehead I'm pleased as hell to see the BBQ & Beats
campout, count me in for help!) (Burger King I miss you too!!) (Tom L. I'm
such a GODDAMNED flake I SWEAR I'll make it up to you) (Amy S. you've been
there from the start) (Reagan, Stan told me you say hello, so HELLO BACK!
:):),  and hello too to all you gnu fokes who are on the list too.  

Wow is all I can say!  I can't tell yet if it's a good wow or a bad wow.  It
feels bad right now.  I scrolled thru all the info numbers of all my
favorite promoters and found pretty much nothing there when I dialed them to
see what's going on lately.  Either there was a recorded message from
parties that occured ages ago, or the number doesn't even exist any more, or
something.  Seems like everybody's just up & vanished, all those beautiful
parties that hold so many memories for me, Harmony, Beautiful People,
Chrysalis, Light, Friends & Family, and all the ones that just seemed to be
everywhere, never had a free weekend cuz there was almost *always* something
really great being planned by all those beautiful people (I now regret
throwing out my 1996 calendar with all those wonderful days written in it).
Those parties were just exactly what I needed at exactly the time I needed
them, an amazing supportive environment for me to begin growing into the
kind of person I still work at becoming, and so it saddens me to see neither
hide nor hair of these people and parties of course.  (god I feel so
nostalgic I'm bout ta cry!)  But I'm hoping that what I'm seeing is not a
loss of these people & parties that meant so much to me, but rather an
evolution of them into new and beautiful things awaiting on the horizon.
It's a little difficult for me to look at it this way, it's very easy for me
to simply lament the loss of what once was and is no more, but I really do
have to begin looking again for the hidden beauty that I'm sure is still
there and just needs to be found, just like it was before.  Also, perhaps it
is possible that these parties have simply gone further underground, rather
than actually dying out, so again that would require further looking.  One
party that really gives me hope of evolution is the Koinonea party, reading
the couple reviews that have trickled in since I subbed back on really makes
me feel like there is new growth on the old tree.  And poor Tom knows I have
yet to make it to one of those parties, but I know they must be beautiful
cuz Tom is there pouring his amazing energy and intent into them along with
the rest of his group, how could it be otherwise?  Tom has some of the most
beautiful energy and pure intent of anybody I've met in the rave scene,
everybody please support him and his group, they really deserve it, I know
I'm happy to see those parties occurring when all else appears to have dried
up. :)  And so perhaps the scene is evolving as it should, and so maybe it's
a good wow rather than a bad wow.  But that remains to be seen, only the
future will tell.

So people, regale me with tales of the amazing parties that have been
happening in the past two months or so, what new things are appearing on the
horizon of our scene?  What new groups have started up and show promise?
And I really am curious, did anybody attend Coolworld Planet New Years?  I
am *very* curious about that one (and please no flamewars, I just want to
hear descriptions).  Course, prolly everyone's afraid to even admit to
attending massive, eh, Wayne "Crusty the Raver" Correia will run out & lop
off their heads! ;)  

So that's all that's new in Shawnaland, hope everybody is well.

Much love,
Shawna

        I just thought I'd ad that on theat night of Karma, (Lara & Leslie
know). I got some E from some little ass guy who I was told to of had some
really good E. I got 2 for me, and one for Laycee. I was told that it was
really strong and it made a lot of people sick really quickly. But I'm a
strong guy so it didn't make any diffirence to me.
        I took one hit on the way home. I felt it a little about 10 mins
away from my house. I noticed that things were melting (a trait which mdma
doesn't posess). Me and laycee took the rest when we got home and then went
to take a shower. . . it started hitting me pretty hard and shit just
started going haywire, all melting and jumping around, It was pretty obvious
that this wasn't only MDMA. Me and laycee just started talking and massaging
each other and I started sweating like some kind of oversoaked sponge. The
feelings we had were super intense, and the next thing we knew, it was 3
hours later and we were still sitting there in front of each other. I guess
the acid like effects and the e lasted through the next 2 days, gradually
diminishing to nothing.

        But to make my point, yep, my temperature must have been at least
105-110 degrees F that night. And that certainly wasn't just E.

        Me and about 14 other friends had an E party one night. I had about
4 hits. After a while, I noticed weird little neon  colored shapes on
everyones faces, and after the fourth hit really hit, I couldn't sit still
if I had a gun to my head. But other than that, it was a killer little get
together and we're doin it again soon.

        So MDMA IS hallucinogenic in larger amounts. But that other stuff in
the beginning wasn't all mdma.

Guess there really was no point. . . 

who cares. . .

That space used to be the TWEAKER (speed freak for all of you not hip with

I recently discovered that nothing makes the rhythm inside me flow more
than drumming along to jungle breakbeats.  I had pretty much ignored
jungle until my first out-of-body experience at Gaiamind.  I felt it
again when I tranced out at Koinonea.  The breakbeats keep the rhythm
jumping, while the speed makes it all flow so smoothly.  I'm all eyes &
ears now for any jungle event that will welcome an enthusiastic drummer.

As for dancing, it might be harder to capture the rhythm inside your
body.. I think letting it flow naturally instead of trying for a
robot-breakdance is the best bet.  Then, there's no telling what you'll
do.. =)

Living the beat,

Leonardo

Aryck:

    If Youz really had a temp of 105 to 110 degrees ....You would have

Okay, anyone remember the post I made about my concern for kids at
raves? The general (but thankfully kind :) response was that we need to
educate young people about the substances they take at a rave.

Was *this* a good time to educate her about the characteristics of LCD?
I'm being sarcastic.

Whoa Whoa Whoa. So 20/20 tells the parents and others that "The Raves"
are to blame for over drug use and it's dangers like the example at
oddyssey. So WE blame the parents. Okay, I'm glad everyone is taking
responsibility.

 Rise your hand if youve ever sneaked out of your house from your
parents to go to a Rave. If we have a problem withthe age of some people
at parites, then a few collectives may need to trim down their rosters.
Because people this age are are helping to throw parties.

  And in the 20/20 story the young girls mother basicly did all that AND
shut down the site permanently. So I guess we can say goodbye to that
site, huh?

Please do not push the blame on her parents. This is whats going to
happen at an underground party and it must be accepted. Yoda would say
that this is the "Dark Side" of the Rave. This and the Thomas Trouble/GT
incident.

Flame away...

Lots of space?    Come one man....  get real....   The FM band in the Bay
Area is saturated.     I'm sure you might find something below 92 Mhz.

If you get no complaints of interference,  or from the programming,   you
might be able to go on the air without getting molested by the FCC.   You're
range will be small (1- 5 miles radius) but Berkeley Free Radio has been on
the air for a long time,  although they are fighting the FCC on Civil Liberty
issues.

>how much can you get away with?

Depends on the quality of your signal.   If you over-modulate,  or the audio
is crappy,   you won't get away with it at all.     If your audio is clean
and you don't interfere or cause problems,   you MIGHT get away with it.

Usually the first "offence" they will warn you,   or possibly confisgate your
equipment.    Or they would file criminal charges.   5 yrs jail or 5 years
probation at worst case.

Getting a license is next to impossible,  again,  Steve Dunnifer is fighting
the FCC for this reason.

I would certainly like to participate in that....   For starters,  assuming
that a frequency is available (which there is NOT in the Bay Area),   it
takes a Minimum of about $200,000.   FCC requires a radio station to be
able to run in the "red" for 2 years without making money.

You're best bet is to buy an existing radio station,   assuming one is for
sale.    Average costs run from 2 - $10 million.

There is talk of trying to pursuade the FCC to permit low power licenses
for neighborhood stations with ranges from 1 - 5 mile radius,  but the
FCC is dragging their feet on this.

In Berkeley,  there is Steve Dunnifer,  fighting the FCC on these issues,
trying to get them to ease up license restrictions to permit neighborhood
radio.   It might be important to get behind Steve and supporting him.

this whole oddyssey rape thing is giving me a bad taste in my mouth for 
a ton of reasons.. first off, i'm really concerned with how apathetic 
certain posts seem to be about this.. not just this poor girl, but 
about rape in general.. speaking from experience, rape is the most 
devestating thing that can happen to a girl... so regardless of how 
fucked upo she was, if she said no, that's what it meant.. she didn't 
invite this... there's been an influx of negative people coming into 
the scene with all the media publicity, and unfortunately, many of 
these people think they can take advantage of others there.. she was 
only 15, and maybe hadn't fryed before, so her friends should have been 
there for her... but blaming this violent act on her age (as well as 
the promoters for letting her in) is lame... i've been partying since i 
was 14, and i've just turned 18 now... it wasn't until recently that 
i've had to deal with guys trying to take advantage of me while i'm 
"too fucked up" to notice... fortunately, i have good friends, and 
never let myself get to the point where i'm out of control of what's 
being done to me...another thing that made me sad was to hear the way 
it sounded like everyone was coming down on the promoters... they put 
on a good party, and it wasn't their fault that something like this had 
to happen... i think they did their best to control the situation, but 
it just was beyond their hands.. instead of all of us fighting about 
what is rape and what isn't, we should be sticking together to help 
this girl and preventing tragedies like this from happening in the 
future.. i'm sorry this was so long, but as you can tell, i feel 
strongly about this subject...

                             much love,
                               anissa...

Funny you should mention 'Legs' since there have been at least two fairly
big releases over the last few months that included samples from
Legs...X-Calibur's Retriculan Groove and U.K. Science's Mainline

And don't forget all those Moments In Love samples we keep hearing, or
that Prodigy used samples from Beat Box (Diversion One) in Firestarter
or....


:)

I agree, the AoN 'sound' is very stuck in the 80's.  That's part of what I
like about it, though!  I helps me remember those days gone by.  I think
was ahead of their time, though, as they were experimenting with methods
of synthesis and sampling produciton techniques that other groups were not
trying.

When Groove Radio 103.1 in LA (broadcasts out of Santa Monica, repeater
station is in Newport Beach) went on the air in the summer, it was really
really funny.  No DJs, no real programming cycle, just all of a sudden
this message ont eh air that said "Have you ever been to a rave...?" and
then all this clubby-housey music.  

Now, after a while, they got their programs together, got the DJs on board
and such and it's all good.  During the daytime they spin mostly
commercially available club/house/Hi-NRG stuff, but they also spin a good
amount of Drum&Bass and various techno.  Now, everybody has to pay their
bills, so you really can't condemn Groove Radio for spinning commercial
discs during the day.  
Noghttime, though, sees a bit of a difference.  Continuous mix shows
dominate, including special guest DJs from all around the country.  Doc
Martin has a weekly show, and there is also a weekly International
countdown continuous mix program.  Last week they broadcast the Future
Sound of London live via an ISDN hookup.  
I've heard everything from Troi Amos to Fatboy Slim, Josh Wink to
Uberzone, Fluke to Everything But the Girl on Groove Radio.  The diversity
in the programming is quite impressive for a commercial station.  But, if
you only listen at lunch time or on your drive home from work, you're only
going to hear the heavy rotation tracks.

Just my thoughts.  Viva Groove Radio!

 Maybe somone can offer some advice here...
I started out throwing the party Osmosis with a partner.
After my personal bullshit with a mutual friend (which was all my
fault), he decided to support our friend and decided to cancel the
party.  He took 4 of the 10 dj's and decided to throw another party...
It was decided that neither of us would use the name Osmosis.  Wanting
to make a clean break I decided to name my make-up party Begin Again.
(seemed appropriate to me at the time)
What I didn't realise was that this name had been used a couple of times
previously.  So my question is this: Do I stick with the name which I
feel is appropriate, or do I change it again out of respect?
    Any suggestions would be appreciated...
    & if anyone want's to come out to a nice House party this Sat. call

Hi all!

 No smiley faces. This subject is WAY too serious.

 I would like to propose a raver "escort" service to help prevent 
situations like this. Many promoters do this with their crew on an 
informal level but I feel an organised system might be helpful.

 This would be similar, in some respects, to escort services offered by 
volunteers working at colleges and university.

 A general outline for operating could go like this;

	A bunch of folks agree to volunteer to help.
	
	These folks coordinate with each other before each party (as many 
	parties as possible) so everyone knows who is going to what party 
	(know your support group!) A mailing list for this group maybe?

	This group should be in touch with the promoters and staff so 
	that everyone knows each other and can call on each other for help if 
	needed.

	If a person looks messed up a volunteer can either hang with them 
	or just keep a discreet eye on them. Also, folks can let the 
	volunteers know if someone looks out of it.
 
	This could help prevent unwanted run ins between loaded folks and 
	event security/cops/media/whatever.

	This could include escorts to ones car in scarey neighborhoods.

 	Ideally most escort members would know basic first aid.

	Out of the spirit of giving, I feel the escorts should still be 
	paying party goers. Guest lists are too huge!
 
 

 There is strength in numbers and I believe there are enough of us that 
care to watch out for one another and our scene.

 Intelligant and compassionate responses invited.


peace y'all

 Try hunting around for a similar feeling phrase or word! (Born Again?) A 
thesaurus (sp?) really helps.

 Good luck to both you and your old partners!

On the general topic of rave radio and the mainstreaming of rave music, I'm
fascinated to hear how much more dance and electronic music there is on
KZSC (88.1), UCSC's station, this year compared to last.  Last year it was
very rare, and now I can hardly get away from it.  There seems to be more
every term.  Three nights in a row now I've switched it on and there it
was.  It shows up in the daytime, too.  I haven't seen their current
schedule, but most of what I've been hearing is along the lines of jungle,
drum-n-bass, trip-hop, dub, ambient/experimental sounds.  Some house, very
little techno, trance, hardcore, breakbeat.  I'm not sure what it means,
but it's interesting.

For those who can receive it, next Tuesday night Hollipop, from Moontribe
in LA, will be a guest DJ in the midnight to 3 slot.

randy's got a pretty good idea, if i understand it correctly.  if i did 
get this correctly, when someone looks lost, this guide sort of stays 
there with them.  

kind of reminds me what the shamen does with all of his "guidees" 
(theres' prolly a better word, just can't think right now) 

the only difference though is that like real shamen in say peru the 
shamen-shamenee relationship is established BEFORE the trip starts.  

this is the problem with these substances being illegal.  there ought to 
be people who have had more experience with psychedelics guiding the 
younger (or less experienced people) through the trip.  so they have 
someone they know they can rely on.  but there's a risk for taking that 
role in the united states of clinton/gingrich [applause banner 
please]...it's called...

"contributing to the delinquency of a minor"

hello everyone...

i don't know if this will help anyone...but Vlad and I have known each 
other for years.  I remember when his /Honda/ was new and I was cleaning 
his windshield.  That was October 17, 1989 at 5:03 PM.  Remember what 
happened after that?  why was i cleaning his windshield?  well, that's a 
long story.  

so we've known each other like 10 years now.  from even before raving.  
in fact, i remember when our mutual friend took him to his first party.  
he's a cool guy, really.  we haven't really hung out a whole lot, but 
that doesn't matter.  

i guess what i'm trying to say is what i like most about him is he's at 
least making a contribution to our music community.  it's ok to make 
money doing this, contrary to popular belief, and promoters take on a lot 
of responsiblity.  but vlad seems to enjoy it.  

yeah, i know.  i've seen posts about what happens at some of these big 
massives.  but i'm just here to say that the vladster isn't someone from 
out of town in for the weekend type of guy.  if we keep on positively 
reinforcing each other, instead of taking a little toothpick and finding 
out what's wrong, you know some of you guys are like that.  oh, look 
there's a problem!  quick!  focus on that problem!  look, let CNN and 
Geraldo and Oprah Windbag focus on the problems.  Any idiot can tell you 
what's wrong with something.  What we need here is a mastermind group 
that can start blending ideas so we all throw better parties, have better 
trips, and have more fun!

this doesn't mean don't express your opinion, by the way.  

fog
(ps, vlad...call me!)

I have no first aid training, but believe myself to be a calming presence,
if that would help.
What do y'all think?

Is this really possible?  Can one person relate to another's trip sufficiently
to be of help?  My curiosity forcuses on LSD, as I have no experience

unpleasant experience.  I know that, with some organic psychedelics,

LSD trips are really too complicated to be documented since different
amounts will have different pleasant and unpleasnt effects.  The best way
to help someone with a bad trip in my experience is to have a few people
hang around the person.  Sing songs, dance, share candy, and tell stories
(even tho it will not really make sense to the person at all).  I realize
that most of my bad-trips happen when no one is around me to give me
assurance that it's going to be over in a few hours.  

Another cause of a bad trip would be an event that may be traumatic to the
person right before taking acid (breaking up with someone, etc...)  So you
also have to make sure that the person is in a pleasant mood before dosing
and if not suggest that the person stay sober or try a weaker dose.

As far as Ran's suggestion, I think I'm up for it.....

Much love,
Anthony E

  Just a comment:  From my perspective the people who don't like Feel Good Prod.
don't mind people making money from the scene as much as the line of BULL SHIT
that comes from them.... Martin for example exemplifies the commercial rave
scene and most people get along with him... but then he doesn't spam sfraves
with pleading messages about how all he's concerned with is the "togetherness
and sharing of the oneness of the scene and how much we love blah, blah blah...
and btw check your money with me at the door"

  If the message about how concerned Feel Good was about sharing and vibe had
included btw  - all sfravers get in for $5 just give your account info at the
door the message would have made more sense....

  but I suspect that the motive behind the contact of sfraves was more along the
lines of.... well there's 600 of 'em out there... if I compose a message and am
able to get 100 to bring one or two friends then that'll be 200-300 more and at
$20 ... that's $4000 to $6000 more income in my pocket.... not bad for sending
a message to the net plus it's free advertising........

  But then maybe I'm more cynical than I should be ;-)

Oh, heck yeah, I once had a temp of 212.  Had steam shooting out my
ears, which of course made my ears shrivel up.  My head swelled, my
eyes turned all black and got huge, and all my hair just >poof!<
fell out.  All my clothes burned off.  And with all the moisture
escaping, my body shrunk down from 6'1" to about 3".  So if you saw
a little guy with a big head and large black eyes jamming in front

Yes, in part we blame the parents.  Just because we can't put all the 
blame on one person doesn't mean no one gets some part of the blame.
Her parents were at fault.  The promoter was at fault.  The GIRL was
at fault.  Her friends were at fault.  You're absolutely right that
I focused quite a lot on one point, but the truth is we are all in
this together, and when it comes to our young people, we ALL have a
responsibility to look out for them.  She was too young to be at a
party that goes all night.  She was too young to be doing LSD (or 
LCD for you electronics freaks ;) )

We all have, but that doesn't mean parents should just throw up 
their hands a say, "Geez, I guess I should just condone it, cause
I sure can't stop it."  *That* would be one helluva a lousy parent.

You are absolutely right.  Some of the collectives *should* trim
their rosters, and they should check IDs at the door.  People wouldn't
have a problem with raves if ADULTS were attending.  The reason raves
get SO much flak is because, at the mids to massives and at a lot
of the small raves, a large portion of the population are KIDS.  
Kids that parents are worried are thrashing themselves near to 
death with  drugs.  Hell, who cares if kids (beyond a certain age)
go out all night and DANCE?  It's the DRUGS that parents are pissed 
off about, and this girl is a prime example of why.

Yup.  And if a bar was serving minors it would get shut down as 
well.  Too bad for the bar, too bad for the site, too bad for the
promoters.  And WAY too bad for the mother whose daughter had to
die before someone DID something about it.

No, it does not have to be accepted.  It has to be changed or 
parents will continue to attempt to *stop* it.  And that's life 
in the social contract.

I'm really sorry to bring the OJ Simpson saga onto this list, but there 
is something that is really bothering me about this fine country that we 
live in.

Last night I flip on the TV at around 6PM to see a Live camera shot from 
a Hellicopter hovering over OJ's House.  Then they cut to a live camera 
shot from a hellicoter hovering over the Santa Monica Court Room.  
Appaerntly the OJ Verdict was about to come in.  

At the same time, on the other side of the country in Washington DC, 
President Clinton was about to give his State of the Nation Address.  
However, the media decided that the OJ Verdict was more important, and 
that they would air the Presidents Address on tape delay.

To be honest, I could really care less about politics or the OJ Trial.  
But me, as a citezen of this Country, feels that what our president has 
to say is much more important then the fate of OJ.  It just goes to show 
you that the state of our nation is controlled by the media, and that the 
mass majority of the people in this country want to know what is going on 
in OJ's life more than what the President has to say.

Its sickning.

Ray (and everyone else), how would these environmental organizations
respond if they knew about the hundreds of full-color-glossy-fliers for
this "Love Affair" that were left all over the floor of the last CF party?
(BTW, seeing them strewn all over the floor was prolly one of the biggest
"vibekillers" of the night)

you're lucky we recycle the WASTE from our parties.

maybe, but in this case i don't think so mike ;)

Special note to Ray follows:

i don't think you're an evil person, just a hypocrite. whether you are
aware of this hypocricy or not i cannot say, but maybe you should put a
little energy into educationg yourself if you are going to take on the
responsiblity of throwing "massives" or whatever.

Hey there !

I was wondering if any of you guys could give me leads where to find the
movie "Yellow Submarine".  I heard it was a collectors item, then I heard
it was possible to buy it etc.  Also, ideas where I could rent it would be
cool as well.

Any leads would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

ok, thas cool.  i haven't even scrolled down the list of messages yet, im 
sure there's gonna be lots.  all promoters have their faults just like 
they do their good ones.  but hang out.  people have the ability to 
change.  

i usually stay away from these huge massives myself because i've already 
been to enough of them.  things just happen at massives that don't 
usually happen at smaller ones.  but that element is what makes massives 
sort of unique. yeah, go ahead.  flame my post.  doesnt' matter. i just 
hope i'm getting through to even one person out there out of 800 that can 
look beyond criticism and just start working toward throwing better 
parties.  

good luck!  =]

Subject: Re:  harrasment at parties, longish
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

This reminds me of a story I uh....heard.  
A couple of years ago a group of fairly inexperienced ravers journeyed out
to a party (Thunderground). They had cut their teeth on small family type
parties (Chrysalis, where did you go!!) and intimate house parties,
thunderground was a different scene altogether for them. 

 There was no E to be found, but there was a lot of acid to be had. One of
the more chemically inexperienced of the group ended up with about a 1.5
inch long strip of paper in his possession, and not knowing any better,
I...er...I mean he ate it. Stupid eh?  Anyway, in about an hour this guy is
on a couch in the chill room, completely motionless, experiencing his own
personal hell.  Bad trip is way too mild a description.  All night long this
poor, stupid guy watches groups of friends come into the chill room and
ignore his motionless, agonizing form glued to the couch totaly unable to
communicate.  This story would not have been nearly so sad if someone,
anyone had hung out and talked/interacted with the poor bloke.  

Moral of the story?  If someone looks lost at a party, you might want to
check on'em and give some assistance. Talk to the person, hold their hand,
find their friends, It could mean a lot.

Oh, the very next night, on thanksgiving, the poor shmuck in this story had
a religious experience (went to heaven/saw god/was god) at Tribal Funk, this
time mescaline was the culprit.  This person has learned his lesson and no
longer indulges in "Hard" psychedelics in public.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DISCLAIMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a made up story, the events depicted never happen.  Drugs are not
sold at raves.  Mind expanding drugs are illegal and never consumed at
raves.  No minors had their delinquency contributed to during the making of
this story. (The group of, now very experienced ravers, was 22-23 years of
age at the time of filming)

Ya Ya!! How bout The Elite Guide of Our Rave Scene (the EGORS)

Seriously though this is a wonderfull idea and I would like to be the

How bout Glo in the dark necklacces used as headbands? 

I cant do it alone, anyone else up for this?

I don't know what Thermodrean is but Cytomax is a sustained energy
drink used by endurance atheletes (runners, bikers, swimmers,....
ravers) It accomplishes this mainly via complex carbohydrates and
other natural fuels...I can't remember exactly the other stuff on the
label. It also contains a nutrient which helps prevent lactose (sp?)
buildup in your muscles. This buildup is what causes your muscles to
feel sore during and after strenuous exercise. I've tried it a few 
times and I was able to run a whole lot longer at a faster pace. It's
also caffeine and ephedra (ephedrine) free!!! Try buying it at your
local healthfood store before going to GNC which charges premium $$$.
The fruit punch flavor tastes best too!

Peace,
John K.

  BUt look on the bright side, I believe yesterday's state of the union 
was the most watched, ever.  So if people are lame for wanting to know 
what happened to OJ, and the media is lame for pandering to that, at 
least some good came from it all.

No..  It's all good...

  Thats just what Corey said..  From what I have heard, it was a killer
party.
  But..  I had so much fun after the Bagok party that.. I wouldn't of
missed that for the world..  
  I did put the big "Hmmmmm" after the Donald statement..  What I meant by
that is; that it sure seemed strange that this accured twice in two weeks..
 It does sound like he is being flakey.
  As far as talking shit..  I don't recall doing that..  What I really
think here is; that you were expecting people to talk shit (becouse someone
always does) and you think I am that person..  But I am not.. So,,, yanno..

What is cool, and what is not cool; is totally up to you and your delete
key.


 For the record..  The promoters had nothing to do w/ the raping
<--(opinion. no one knows for sure if this happened. But Mac posted it

Questioning who?   I would never defend a rapist.

This story is "booty?"
I want to know if this shit really happened..  If it did!!  I want to know,
so that I can warn people I care about very dearly in this scene!  But I
don't want them to get all shook about about the ravE scene if this shit is
just some fucking rumor!!!

Thanx.

This is true. But I don't think her or any parents would condone it
simply because they cannot stop it. This really is a seperate matter
though, because we are not the parents here. I just want to make the
point that we should not focus so much on the faults of others when as
promoters there is room for improvment on our part.

 You highlight *should* because, I assume, you mean that promoters
probably won't exclude kids from their collectives anytime soon. A
promoter who has kids on their staff will probably not start IDing
people. This is what I mean by having to accept it unless promoters want
to change. And right now few are interested in doing that. Underground
basicly means no rules exept thoes that people voluntiarly follow.

Aye, here's the rub. So it must be changed, yes? While we can blame
parents or friends the only thing we have any sort of control over is
the party itself. Therefore this must be the focus.

I challenge each and every promoter that is concerned for the well being
of the people that attent the parties to START CHECKING I.D.s AT THE MAP
POINT _AND_ AT THE SPACE. If we fail to do this, then it is not our
place to blame any other individual (child) or group (friends or
parents). Unless I'm forgeting some other option, this is the only way
we as promoters can help prevent these problems. And if promoters won't
check I.D.s, then yes, these problems must be accepted as part of
underground parties.

A couple of weeks ago, at a party called "First Contact", there was a dj who
was absolutely runnin' things in the main room...Who was he?..He played a
combination of hard trance and goa, and he was wearing some hannah barbara
cartoon character on his shirt...Anyways, I had never really been exposed to
music like that before...His whole set had the crowd freaking out, and I
watched many people come to the front of the decks, and tell him how much
they loved it...To me, that's what it's all about...Good music, good crowd,
equals good vibes and good times...Also, just wanted all the anti-trancers
to know, that proper trance and goa, can be just as funky as anything
else...Nuff' respect to the dj (whoever he is), and to all the trancers who
were havin' it...

Reverting back to my original e-mail...

Checking IDs and such at parties would kill the whole spirit of the party.
Ask yourself how old you were when you went to your first party. What if
they ID'd you? I stick to my same argument in that putting an age on
parties puts a damper on the scene.

Its no different than mocking the commercial scene or anything else
associated with raving. What we are saying is that we want to make the
environment better for ourselves by keeping the people who MIGHT make us
have a bad time out of the scene. 

I'm sure that we all have our self-centered attitudes about younger ravers
but they are still part of the FAMILY, (or maybe what's left of it.)

You know what peoples....

This is rediculious.  This is sooooo sad it's laughable.  I see postings
from
some of you saying "when I was sixteen", and "Yeah I just turned 
eighteen" blah, blah.  When did you all grow up?  Do you remember raving
in your younger days?  And now some of you are looking to cut off raving
to the younger generation?  

I _KNOW_ even if an age limit is imposed there will be *exceptions* when
 it comes to the promoters, DJ's, sound and light crews and friends.
Will
 it become a type of "exclusive socieity" as to who gets in where?  I 
played this game in the club circut.  When I was 16-17 yrs old I was
going 
to The Edge, (come to think of it, they still play the same music there
too...), Catcus Club, and a few other 21 and up venues cos my brother
and his friends were the DJ's...

The answer isn't in the age, but in watching our own and watching
ourselves.  Has anyone notice how much more 'relaxed' people are at a
CCC or F'n'F (or Harmony, F-8, FMR for that matter, the list goes on..)
then say, Ghost Tribe, Gathering or other massives...  What I percieve
is our smaller parties gaining a more massive party additude.  How do we
change that?  
>I have my answer...  And you, out there, must find yours.

Thank you to the person who said that F-8 was going to be at Wish this 
evening.  I was thinking about going to ComeUnity, but when I found out 
that Myster-E and Mars were going to spin at Wish, and being a total 
goa-freak, I decided to be at the Cabana tonight. ;)

When unemployed, one must take advantage of weeklies! ;)

Actually, I was discussing this with someone and they suggested that
promoters have a responsibility to the people that pay to get into the
party to have some kind of staff on hand to watch over everyone. 
A bar has bouncers, and the clientele there are adults.  By the very
virtue of the "vibe", I don't think a rave needs bouncers per se, but I 
do think there should be a handful, say 1-to-50 ratio, of people that 
are paid (or get in free?) that are part of the staff and are tasked 
with staying sober and just keeping an eye out for any trouble, even 
folks that are just tripping way too hard.

This is a solution that can be applied regardless of the target
audience or age group for the rave.

Just another $.02.

Exactly - I think drawing an artificial age-limit, be it 14 or 16 or 18
is just that - artificial. There are some very mature and responsible
14-year-old's and some very immature and irresponsible 21-year-old's.
Excluding someone from a scene as (generally) positive as ours on the
basis of age is going to force them back into a less healthy scene.

Precisely - we should all be looking out for each other, and especially
for the younger kids, not trying to exclude them. We can teach them a
lot about caring and responsibility.

The sad thing is, that that the dance studio is one of the fattest
locations in sf...and now it's probably known to every cop in the
area...any word as to whether the location is still going to be used?

	Well, is there some age that's *definitely too young* for these
	parties? 12? 14? I know lots of people hate 18 & up parties. How
	about 16 and up?

  And having a 15 year old girl strip down and proceed to tweak like
hell, causing the authorities to be called kills the spirit of the party
a lot more. Don't you think?

  Yes I know, we all love our family members, no matter what age. But
having no age control over who goes to a party for the sake of keeping
the vibe alive or because they are FAMILY members does not justitfy
allowing tragedies like this weekends or any other to happen.  This is
not something that MIGHT happen. IT WILL HAPPEN. Sooner or later, you
know it will happen again. And I'm not talking about keeping kids out
for our sake. It's for their sake.

You're right massives are (arguably) bad, having to turn away people
from parties is bad, lots of things in the scence are bad but NOTHING
compares to having a kid get so fucked up she has to be put under
restraint. Short of death maybe.

Sorry everyone for getting so rilled up over this topic. But it's one I
feel passonate about. =)

And carrying someout out of a party who was in a coma who had O.D. and
was clearly over 18 was no fun either. Point is, there are irresponible
folks regardless of their age. It is ignorance we should be combatting,
not age.

Damn it, you've converted me, Adam!  No more age discrimination!  Why,
this should extend to everything!  Let's take it to some extremes,
whatdya say?

The Draft: Put a gun in the little buggers hands and let them duke
it out with the rest of us.  Most of them are carrying guns anyway,
right?  We'll just watch our own on the battle field.  They'd be
ok, right?

Drinking: What the hell, as long as they're young enough to die, 
they're young enough to throw back a few stiff ones at the end of
a hard day in of eighth grade math and English.

Driving: Who cares if they can't hardly reach the pedals?  Everyone
has a right to transportation so they can get to and from the raves,
right?

Voting: So some of the kids in today's high schools wouldn't know
an issue from a tissue, but if we can catch them at a moment when
they're not drunk, shooting someone, or out of their minds on
acid and naked as a jaybird, they should be able to wander into a 
voting booth with the rest of us.  Of course they wouldn't know
who the hell was on the ballot or what they various initiative
numbers meant, but then who does?

Cigarettes: Light up, kiddies!  Cancer - the game the whole family
can die from!

Porn: Pop that stupid Barney tape out of the VCR and throw in 
"Debbie Does [fill in blank with name of major city or sports team]".
Then grab the baby oil and a towel and get bizzee!

Jobs: Hey!  It shouldn't be my responsibility to provide everything
these little sh*ts need -- let them get off their duffs and work
a full day like the rest of us.  Janitorial services would clean up!

Taxes: Great!  Now that everyone can do anything anybody else can
do, regardless of their age, including getting gainful employment,
let's tax the little rug-rats.  How about taxing comic books?  Or 
pacifier disposal?  Or padded bras?  Make kids generate the funds
to implement the programs they use the most.  Tax peechees and
jock straps.  No more free bus rides to the school -- charge them!
Charge for school lunches, books, crayons, etc.

Have I made a point yet?  There are a LOT of things that HAVE to
have an age limit.  Anyone can stagger through the door of a rave,
but do they belong in an environment known for it's availability
of drugs, where the clientele are known for their consumption of
any and all combinations of just about any substance that will
alter reality?  Do you want your kids going into the environment?
I know I don't want mine to until they're old enough to handle
what goes on there.  I'm thinking 17, but I'm sure that number
will cause an uproar.  

Either way, Pengo had it right, the promoters have to decide how
responsible they're going to be and whether they want to deal 
with a bunch of kiddies barely out of diapers that probably will
not know how to handle their drugs.  The responsible promoters
will stick with people who are mature enough, or should be,
to handle whatever entertainment they choose to partake of while
at partying and let the less responsible promoters field the 
babies in the bunch.  They'll also, hopefully, provide some kind
of staff to watch out for people that are in trouble, people
with the training to handle situations like the one that occurred
at Odyssey.

Let's see... that must have been at least a $1.25...

My opinion on age-limits varies.  On one hand I am very disturbed by the
amount of young people doing lots of drugs at parties.  I also don't
always like the attitudes that teenagers exhibit.  It is too exclusionary 
for me, and that's why *I* stopped being a teenager.  It had nothing to
do with getting older! :P hehehe  And the older I get, the more I realize
how young teenagers actually are. And then I get selfish and think,
"Teenagers should be banned from all the things I was banned from when I
was a teenager."  But, then I get a flash and remember what it is like to
be a teenager.  It sucks to be treated like a child because you aren't
actually that, but you aren't actually an adult either.  However, this
society spends so much time not respecting children that you end up being
really resentful against this as a teenager.  I remember the few people
that treated me with respect as a teenager, and I listened to them a lot
more than I listened to people who just told me what I could and could not
do.

I honestly don't think that as a society we provide enough things for
teenagers to do.  I would not want to exclude teenagers from dancing and
some of the joys of raving.  It is fun, provides a social outlet, and
provides a sense of community.  Being at social gatherings is fun for all
of us, and is not something that should be limited to certain ages.  For
example, I don't support the age limit on drinking.  I think that, in
itself, promotes excessive drinking.  Because it is forbidden and "adult",
you want to do it more.  I lived in a country that had no age limit on
drinking, and teenagers were more resonsible about drinking.  This was
because there was open communication in this family oriented society. I
feel that the larger problems are how un-family oriented we are as
Americans.  Americans are materialistic and seek instant gratification.
This is reflected in the youth and raving is a prime target in which to
seek instant gratification via drugs and be materialistic via clothing and
other goods.

Age limits may be the answer to keeping kids away, but I don't know if it
is the right one.  I think the right one is more familial communication.
When I started raving 2 years ago at 22, the people I went with did drugs
every damn weekend.  I was a bit worried by that, and myself did not
partake in such excess.  The people with me weren't teenagers, but
their drug use concerned me.  Part of me always looks towards the future
and is always careful about what I do.  That's how I've always been.  When
I was a teenager I certainly drank and got drunk with my friends at
parties, but I knew when enough was enough.  But, I also remember being a
teenager and having *nothing* social to do.  I would hate to cut off 
social outlets to teenagers when we don't provide them with alternatives.
We also force them to grow up too quickly and then tell them they are too
young.  It's ridiculous.

My crazy solution to the kid/drug problem is raising the legal driving age
to 18.  I don't think teenagers need cars as much as they think they do.
It is part of a larger materialism.  Not being able to have licenses and
cars would probably do a lot to curb the drug/drinking problem because
you would wipe out the accessibility.  Also, it would get a lot of cars
off the highway which is good environmentally.  I know it sounds strange,
but I think it is a legitimate point.

I've noticed from a number of posts that quite a few of you *are*
teenagers.  What do you have to say about this??  How do you feel you are
being treated?  HOw do you feel about yourselves, your peers, and all the
drugs at raves?

One more question.  All of you out there who say, "I began raving at
14 and now I'm 18, or whatever", how did you do this?? I can understand
sneaking out once or twice, but *all the time.*  My parents would have
never let me do this.  Plus I had a lot of other responsibilities
including school work and sports.  You can't do that when you are burnt
out and exhausted from raving.  Did your parents allow you to go out all
the time?  Did they know?  What did they think?

I have wondered about this forever.  I still don't understand *how* so
many teenagers go in the first place.  It amazes me.  Parental ignorance?

I think that this applies to a lot of the adult population as well.

Children are taxed on income just as adults. The government gets it's
money no matter how old you are.

The few "kids" I've met, one 19, and two 16, are high school dropouts. 
They all seem very wise for their years, some travellers who stay on the
street, and one of the 16 year olds has his own apartment.  These people
are sober ravers and very cool.  But, I really advocate the fact that
they should go back to school and get GED's.  Maybe they will listen to
a "cool" old schooler (no pun intended) like me.  I seriously doubt that
all teenagers at rave are dropouts, becuase I seem to attract an element
of homeless and hippy dready teenagers because of what I look like--so
that's who I meet, I guess.

I am not saying that raves causes teenage delinquency (but, they may
attract them to some degree)  When I was a teen, I regularly went to
dance parties in Canada (this was ten years ago) and it really shaped me
into the music-loving adult that I am now.  Dancing keeps kids out of
other kinds of trouble and gives them something to look forward to!  I
remember being in school and counting the hours 'till the next time I
was dancing my butt off in Quebec.  If it wasn't for those nights, I
wouldn't have started trying to make my own dance music, learned how to
use a computer, become a computer programmer, become a music producer,
become a drummer, etc. etc. etc.

As far as my mother goes, she hated the fact that I went out all the
time.  I used to say, "But, Ma!  I don't drink, I don't break the law, I
get good excercise, please, please can I stay out 'til four AM??  She
begrudgingly let me go because she knew how much I loved it.  

So, let teens be teens and don't turn into the adult that you once hated
when you were a teen.

Adam and I are discussing this topic offline at this point, but I wanted
to make this much clear:

On the topic of looking out for our own, I'm in total agreement, but I'd
rather keep the gun out of a kid's hand than let him play with it and
hope he doesn't blow his brains out with it.  I do not condone giving
drugs to kids.  I absolutely believe that up to a certain age most kids
do NOT have the mental tools to deal with the drugs that are prevalent
at a rave.

Most of Adam's last post ticked me off because it was just disingenuous
or so completely off the wall that it seemed to be time to take my
response offline, but this I want to post here:

Adam wrote:

Like I said, I was thinking 17+ and up.  I would try to arrange to 
have some "designated straights" who would not get stoned and would
watch out for the others.  And I'd keep the number of people down around
300 to 500, the better to keep control of the venue.  And y'know what? 
I'm willing to bet my events would be the ones less likely to get
busted, less likely to have crisis situations occur.  People would have
a better time at events where they could have fun with other, at least
somewhat, mature individuals.

        One of the reasons I feel very strongly that *all* drugs
should be legal *for adults*, is that this would give us a fighting
chance to keep drugs out of the hands of those who are way too young
to handle them. If we kill off the black market with legalization,
but keep draconian penalties in place for those who provide drugs to
minors, I think things would change for the better. Yes, some minors
would still get drugs. But it would be more difficult for them. Right
now, it's not significantly more difficult for a 12 year old to get
LSD than it is for a 25 year old. Dealers don't have any incentive to
check ID. 

        Now, how does this relate to age limits at parties?

	If these parties were really drug-free, I wouldn't have any
problem with letting anybody in regardless of age. Bring in the 
5-year-olds, who cares. If it's really just about music, dance and 
community then we should include all ages. That's not really the case, 
though, is it?

I've seen the effects of rape.
I've even been accused of rape, by someone I never met mind you.

And I have been misunderstood from time to time..  Did I mention that?

When I originally proposed that promoters ID people at their parties in
an attempt to keep accidents like this weekends at the Dance Studio from
happening, it was as an answer to SDreams statement that these accidents
are not to be just accepted as a 'Side Effect' of parties and that
something has to change. I guess I worded it wrong when I said "I
challenge...". I know that IDing would never work for many reasons. Adam
G. covered them well.

My only real point in this whole thing was that: When something like
this happens at a party, I don't want to hear people blaming the persons
parents, or their friends, or the dealer, or whatever when there was an
opportunity by the promoters to keep people this age out of the party.
Yes I know, people can tweak off of drugs at any age. But when youre 15
a bad acid trip is going to affect you mentally for a while (if not
longer). A lot worse than if the same thing happened to an adult.

I believe that while continuing to educate young ravers as much as
possible is definitely a big help, a situation like this weekends was
unacceptable. We collectively AS A FAMILY FAILED to educate this girl
ahead of time before she took her acid. Which was obviously beyond her
limit. If we cannot ensure a young persons safety at a party, then what
the hell are we doing? Do you find it acceptable?

We talk about a LOT of different things of SFR. So why do I feel like
I'm the only one screaming bloody murder about this? Has a little girls
bad acid trip become that pass? I didn't know that girl, I wasn't a
promoter at that party, yet because I feel for ALL ravers I feel
especially guilty that this happened. We lost a member of the family
forever and probably gained two hateful parents and a girl who will know
she striped down in front of her peers and went berserk. Thats quite a
mental scar. If we are FAMILY, then cmon gang let's act like it and
each in our own way accept responsibility. Or are we still blaming 'the
other guy'?

Mike, You are not extra cynical. You are *right on*. But then we all know
how Mike and I feel about the PLUR-spouting marketing gimmick commercial
rave swine like Feel Good Entertainment and Nomad Interactive, don't we? :-)

When I saw 16k of "hugs and love and plur and sharing and caring" from Feel
Good E. (inplied drug references to lure the 15 year old kids out to
'play') I just wanted to throw up.

Maybe it would have been more appropriate of Feel Good E. to write
something like:

----
"I'm having a big commercial party that I hope to make a lot of money at.
Although I am spouting PLUR and Sharing and Caring out my ass I am not
going to let any of you in for free -- but I really hope all you vibey SF
ravers from the underground will come, drop your hard earned $20 to get in
so that you can unknowingly help me make my tagger-fest move vibey!

Then my party, having a new-found vibey reputation will have an even bigger
turnout next time, making me many suitcases of cash! Then I can have an
even bigger party, make even more money whilst fooling the public with my
reputation of legitimacy that I swindled from my unknowing accomplices in
the underground!

By then it will be too late for any of you to detract from me because my
parties will have the hugest marketing budget that even if all of your
collective voices in the undergorund attempt to detract from me you won't
have a hope of countering me and my 100,000 rave flyers -- which will be
spread around every square inch of every related store and gas station in
northern california! And the the biggest joke will be on all those Eco
groups that think they're getting money from me cuz I printed it on all my
100,000 non-recycleable wax coated rave flyers! Hell, I will be Cool World
II !!!
----

With that in mind, I am a very compassionate person, but, without regret, I
must absolutely, positively maintain a hard line 100% against the breed of
promoter that spouts "MARKETING BUZZWORDS" like "PLUR" and "LOVE" and
"SHARING" and "CARING" because when it's heard by those of us who actually
attach meaning, emotion, passion and purpose to those words, it's just
disgusting.

I hope to see Feel Good Entertainment & _Love-A-Fair_ on a Leeza, Hard
Copy, 20/20 or the local TV news soon. It seems to be the only way to keep
exploitation in check in the land of raving.

And if after reading all of this you (the sf raves community) are not in
doubt that this party will suck, ((1)) judge the size and complexity of the
flyer (inverse rule applies), ((2)) the number of DJ's on the lineup
(inverse rule applies), or ((3)) the number of different area codes and
info lines (inverse rule applies). [Remember, this is *no* disrespect to
the DJ's.]

Three strikes, cash-boy, and you're out!

KaySEE wanted to know how teenagers are treated like at parties by 
people they don't know..
	I am 19 years old and technically still a teen but i look 
about 16 when i go to parties. I wear my short hair in pigtails and 
put kiddie hair thingies in them, and i have a pacifier, and i wear 
glitter and lots of bracelets made of beads not unlike the bracelets a 
child would wear. (i hand them out too, so look out!!)
and many of you may ask why? well i have my various 
reasons. but this isnt why i am posting. 
	I can remember many a time I attend a party and get looked at 
(and this aint the massive scene) with almost disdain because i look 
young. I was actually preached to by a guy on E the other night about 
how i shouldnt be doing drugs (i was sober.)at such a young age. why 
does age matter? maturity is the key here, and i think you're all 
forgetting this when you're saying "people 18 and under shouldnt go 
to parties." I would hate to be carded at an event where we are 
supposed to all be coming together and celebrating our differences 
AND our similarities. 
	I can understand all your anger about "those damn kids" and 
their damn drugs. so can i say "damn you oldies and your 
discriminating elitist vibes?" :) no, because i know tons of older 
ravers who welcome the younger kids into the scene, and vice versa. 
the scene isn't OWNED by any of us. it's CREATED by ALL of us, 
every single one. you all crow PLUR! PLUR! but yet, you ignore the 
Unity part of it by discriminating against younger ravers. we are ALL 
individuals, not all of the kids in the scene are drug addicts, and i 
know that not all the older ravers are sobriety addicts. may i repeat 
again, iTS NOT ABOUT AGE. its about maturity.
	i tend to LIKE younger ravers alot, because they have a fresh 
outlook on the scene and don't get all caught up on "well IM better 
because I think THIS and IM better because I know THAT DJ and I got 
into SUCH and SUCH party for FREE". plus, I enjoy feeling younger at 
parties, and i know that some of you (come on admit it) feel like a 
child at a party, no matter how old you are, because you are so 
happy. admit it. youth is an incredible contribution in the scene. i 
agree that a 15 year old girl tweaking on acid is not much fun to 
see, hear about, or even BE, but ANYONE tweaking on acid is not much 
fun to see, hear about or BE. I thought that in this scene, you were 
accepted for who you are, and now we are saying "you can't come to a 
party.. 
not because of your bad vibes, or your drugs, but something you can't 
even control -- your AGE" since when is being 15 a crime? because you 
KNOW that even if you DO card at parties, bad vibers who are 18+ will 
come in, and one of THEM will overdose. then will we say "well we 
might as well just call off parties, except for me and my best 
friend, because everyone else has the probability of giving me bad 
vibes and overdosing on something". if we start discrimination with 
age, what's next? no ADIDAS allowed at parties ?? Glostix contain 
toxic stuff, are glostick masters gonna be banned too because they 
MIGHT break and get in someone's eye? how would you older ravers like 
it if us younger ones said "we don't like the <insert whatever 
generalization about older ravers here> you bring to the parties we 
go to, we're gonna make it a 21 and under party!" you'd be shouting 
discrimination all over the place. 
	It sounds like some of you just want to have some parties 
where all these older ravers get together and talk about the good old 
rave days, and talk about whats wrong with the rave scene today. 
that's fine and dandy, you can do that.
 but while you are 
discriminating against the younger rave genre, you are also missing 
the chance to get to know and befriend some of the most unique and 
beautiful people in the world. we are ALL beautiful people, no matter 
what year we were born in. 
peace love hugs and smilin' loud,
lara

	Whoa! Since when did small raves become consumer events? When did 
we institute such a division between promoter and party goer? When did 
people forget what a community consists of? All this talk of promoters 
are responsible for this and that, where does it end? Aren't each of us 
responsible for >ourselves<?

	I have recently made a fool of myself in private and may be doing
it here in public, but this is moving from what I view a community to be,
toward a consumer event. Everyone is throwing responsiblity on to everyone
else's shoulders, no? "I paid good money for this so I should be taken
care of"? How does that fit into a community? Maybe my idea of community
is a little off from everyone elses, and maybe that is due to the time I
spent going between festivals... I dunno. I had a belief that the rave
scene had some ties to people DIYing things and finding certain things out
in the process. What is next? Promoters responsible for provibing a vibe?
If I sound somewhat beside myself, I am so please look at what I am trying
to get say: I have another suggestion - if you see something which you
feel is lacking, why not fill the gap...
	You want medically trained people at raves, go get trained in
first aid, then CPR, then maybe as an EMT. Maybe scout around the net and
try to find some other courses than those offered by the Red Cross (their
courses are shit now, don't tell you anything except call 911). Keep
badgering groups until they respond (yes I am still try to get those
wilderness first aid courses for those of you who were interested. And I
finally found out why I haven't gotten a response to any of the emails I
was sending out, I was sending them to the old listserver which crashed -
but it still eats my mail without sending out a delivery failed notice). 
Granted big commerical parties are commerical and they are "providing" 
for party goers so maybe they have such a responsiblity, but small 
parties?

now sEE that's one DAMN good idea. 
instead of sitting on your asses complaining about how awful some 
aspects of raving are, why not try to improve it? by providing  a 
shoulder to lean on and a hug and a smile and a conversation to 
someone having a bad trip, it's not CONDONING drug use. The person 
took the drug, if they're having a bad time, then they're obivously 
learning a lesson. I should hope though, that the escorts do not 
become people who lecture trippers. Maybe inform them why/how their brain 
is reacting to the chemicals they ingested.. Educate them while 
making them feel more comfortable with themselves and their trip. 
It's a natural instinct for me to go up to someone leaning against 
the wall with a frown/crying/not looking so hot and sit down and 
smile and ask them if they're ok. If they lost someone/something, i 
stay with them until they find it. If they want to talk, I want to 
listen. I'm all for this escort service, sign me up! And for those of 
you who oppose the idea, try and think of a time at a party, sober OR 
not, when you felt (even for an instant) that you needed a hug, or 
some sort of reassurance that things are going to be ok. If you've 
ever felt this way, then you'd know that having escorts is a good idea..
	I'm not so sure about wearing glostix on your head though. I 
mean, I think that people won't know to go to the person or what the 
glostick headband really means. Unless the map point people tell 
everyone in advance "if you have a problem go to a glostick head 
person" hehe :) 
	anyway, happy wednesday all!
love hugs and smilin loud,
lara

---------- Forwarded message ----------
This was posted in early December by "LiQUiD 7" from UCSC about sober 
raving.  I foward it to the sfraves list again for the person that asked 
about sober raving.   Peace! Bill


Well obviously there is an art to sober raving, and to keep up with all 
those who are 'not' sober can sometimes be a challenge ;)

But there are tons of ways to stay alive throughout the night.  
*	Firstly and most importantly is **BAD-ASS** music (without i almost 
	always die)

*	Then Id say people and their vibes are number two...

---> but from here the rest is up to yooooou!  & theres lots of options

*	ok, theres 'Vivarin' & NoDoze, they're great for some mild tweaking,
	haha, just kidding, but they DO keep you 'UP'.  Then again they
	are very hard on your stomache, so never take too much.  It isnt
	something you should take for a long time...  theres other the ways!

*	now theres 'herbal power' stuff.  i have recently begun experiment
	ing with this and it's great!  a medium sized bottle of red ginseng
	right before a party TOTALLY energized me!  im looking further 
	into other herbal 'upers'.  SOMETHING NOT TO TRY: MaHuang
	Its as addictive as speed, and quite harmful.  DONT GO THERE :!

*	and then there are many *smart* things to do.
	- resting before partying
	- eating high protein food, some good carbos too!
	- like someone said before, lots of water & juice (ESSENTIAL)
	- take something to munch on. i remember once when i took a couple
	  of pb&j sandwiches, and i ate them when i tought i was pooped.
	  those little badboys perked me up like mad!  Try it!

*	and finally there are "energy boosters" that are available. i dont
	know much about the products that are out there, like at GNC, but
	i sell nutritional products that are sponsored by the US Olympic 
	Licensee comitee, and about 20 olympic atheletes, not to mention 
	ive tried their energy booster, its great!  cheaper than a hit 
	of E, better for you than "psuedo-amphedamines", and works well.

	e-mail me if you want more info on this, they have many other 
	awsome supplements as well. (its worth looking into if youre
		---sick'n'tired of being SICK & TIRED---- haha

RAVE ON !!!!!

Just an observation, but I dont think I saw anyone say "get wired on
sugar".  I kinda thought this was convention, no?  I try to bring massive
amounts of sugar and cold water (w/o, you will VERY quickly get dehydrated
even if you DONT dance).  The fact that the water is cold aids the
digestive process (eeewww! :-) and speeds the absorption of the sugar to
the blood stream.  And sugar is way less harmful than caffeine (tho
neither are very dangerous if you behave at all reasonably).

who is just glad to be able to contribute to conversation :-)

OK - time for me to wade into this one - it's a subject close to my heart
and I've kept quiet for long enough. I have a 14 year-old son who I'd 
hesitated to take with me to raves for the very reason that most parents 
would - the pretty free acceptance of drug use. Well, it turns out that 
the drug scene in schools and on the street these days is so bad that 
kids are actually exposed to a lot more than you'd think. All the things 
I was worried about him seeing at a rave, he'd already seen in a much 
more negative context. 

I'd always had this dilemma - on the one hand raves are such incredibly
positive events with an amazing vibe and a spirit of.. uh... PLUR (you 
know what I mean) that I was aching to show my kid. On the other hand 
there is undeniable drug use to a greater or lesser extent which I'd just
as soon not expose my kid to. When I found out the exposure to drugs he'd 
already had at school and on the street, my dilemma was solved. The kids 
are ALREADY exposed to this!

The first rave I took him to was Karma 4 which was pretty heavy on the
drug use, and he *loved* it. Even though there were a lot of drugs there,
he actually felt peer-pressure to stay off drugs, and I think seeing drugs
used in a "responsible" context was really good. He's not interested in
doing drugs himself - and no, I don't think I'm just being naive here -
he, like a lot of people who have posted on this subject (including
myself), likes to rave sober! It's not a cop or a bunch of republicans
telling him to "just say no", it's a bunch of wacky ravers who he respects
MUCH more!

And the positive aspects of raving have totally changed his life. Don't
underestimate the impact of such a positive, loving environment - kids
these days often get lost in the negativity of the world that surrounds
them. All I can say is that raving is the most positive influence in his 
life and his outlook and attitudes have changed literally overnight. Oh,
and he doesn't go on weeknights and it doesn't interfere with school, so 
the other parental concerns are taken care of. 

> 
> I have wondered about this forever.  I still don't understand *how* so

Hey, if more parents took their kids raving *responsibly*, the world 
would be a better place! Yeah - I realize this story is probably about 
as untypical as they come, but it goes to show that raves CAN be an 
incredibly positive influence on kids, and I'd be sad to see them excluded
automatically because of their age (well, maybe the REALLY young ones -
14 is probably about as young as I'd be comfortable with, and only then
with "adult supervision" for all-nighters). (Maybe we should have PG-14 
raves where you can go if you're accompanied by an adult!)

Hugs y'all....

dear lara.  

that is a fascinating story.  for the life of me i've never understood 
that type of mentality, but I know that it does exist, and I'm pretty 
sure it's never going to change, because we constantly have new people 
entering the dance scene and we constantly have new people turning into 
old people.  are you with me?  =]  

I've always thought that most people are like cows.  They sit around,
complain about what's wrong with the world [cows moo and chew their cud]
instead of trying to focus on how we can make the world a better place. 
Of course it's easy to pick on kids, because they're there, a lot of them
are nervous because they haven't gone out that much, and they handle it in
different ways.

I'm going to make this kind of short.  But I'll just leave you with one 
of my favorite quotes:

"Everyone has a flock of opinions waiting to be had upon anyone that will 
take them."

Ok, folx those of you that aren't young and think i'm seeing only one 
side of the coin, there are a lot of kids that do cause trouble at 
raves.  some of you circle dancers need to respect the dance floor as a 
community dance floor for instance.  but telling kids they shouldn't be 
doing e is hypocritical, especially if they've ever done it in their 
life.  It's hypocritical, and the kids can sense that.  Those of you that 
have kids, have you ever noticed that they do what you do and not what 
you say?  Don't always pay attention to what people say.  Watch what they 
do.  

I've just about always enjoyed hanging out with younger people.  I mean, 
sometimes they're going through something i went through years ago, but 
hey that's life.  deal with it.  smile and let others be right.  you 
won't be hanging out with them forever anyway.    

Sorry folx I broke that I/we thingy rule in all English books.  So just 
say aaaauuuummmmmmm and drink some Nub Chai <nubcircus@cruzio.com>( no 
purchase necessary but donations are appreciated i have no financial 
interest in this plug) and the answers will come naturally...

        I had the same (but probably stronger) experience with psylicybin
mushrooms a while ago. I've never been able to duplicate it, but I will when
summer comes back around and me and all can go camping again. I think
spiritual experiences are best left to those who are deemed special by
someone deemed special, and not to those who would use the experience as a
getaway from they're usual routine of getting fucked up.

Hi!  ]=)

 I'm really happy to see this thread rolling a bit more now. I'll collect 
all the mail and create a huge cc list for us involved.

 I don't think the time to educate/brainwash someone is when they're 
high. I prefer instead to help them (if I'm talking with them) by giving 
tips on relaxation techniques. Breathing, focusing on words/images tend 
to help. I hate to say this but I have a lot of high dosage trip 
experience and experience in helping folks through rough moments. It 
doesn't always work, but having someone take a deep breath does wonders 
sometimes (especially if they are panicking/hyperventilating). Sometimes 
knowing someone is suffering from low blood sugar is helpful (you find 
out by talking to them of course, focusing on something as ordinary as 
breakfast can sometimes help), as you can give them a bannana or orange.

 Or if they would like a drink of water or some candy.

 It is by teaching through example that you reach deep.

I raed your post and would like to ask you something........

DO YOU KNOW ME????  HAVE YOU EVER TALKED TO ME???  I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE, BUT YOU SEEM TO 
THINK YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME.  DO YOU KNOW HOW TO READ???  OR ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT 
JUST READS BETWEEN THE LINES AN MAKES SHIT UP THAT SOUNDS GOOD ENOUGHT TO COMPENSATE FOR AN 
INFERIORITY COMPLEX.

DO YOU MAKE IT A HABIT TO INSULT STRANGERS AND TELLING THEM WHAT THEY ARE SUPOSABLY THINKING 
WITHOUT EVEN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY SAID?????

DO YOU CONSIDER THIS RESPECTFULL?  WHAT IS YOUR DEFENITION OF PLUR??  WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU 
ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT IS RIGHT???   WHOOS THE HIPOCRYT???

Anyways, I am not going to indulge you by trying to defend myself or my position.  I make it a 
habit not to have conversations with closed minded, opinionated, negative egomaniacs. I have 
been in this scene for way to long, and taken way to much shit from the like of you.  And you 
know what, I'm still here.  And you know what else, I'm not going anywhere.

Mabee you should read my initial post, with an open mind this time, and see if you understand me 
any better.  If not call me, and get to know me.  415-593-3664.  Atleast then you won't be 
insulting a complete stranger.  

PLUR, VLAD, FGE.

Why is everything with you about money?  You have a twisted perspective on what the endproduct 
of entertainmnet is.  Just to clearify:  ENTERTAINMENT IS THE EDN PRODUCT OF ENTERTAINMENT 
PORODUCTIONS.  MONEY IS A RESOURCE, A TOOL AND A MEANS TO AN END, NOT AN END TO A MEANS.
	
if I did not make this apearent enought in my enitial post, I hope i have clearified myself this 
time.  I also noticed that you have nothing against my event if i let you in for $5 but you have 
somthing against my event if I charge $20.  Thats layme.

As far as this goes, didn't you read the first paragraph of my initial post????

This is what it read:  SNIP>>>

I was not sure I was going to post any information about this party on the net.  I always get my 
head chewed of every time I go out of my way to try and inform the people on this list about my 
events.   I debated for some time whether I was going to subject myself to the aggravation of 
having people misinterpret my intentions and actions and inevitably blow things completely out 
of proportion.  But because of my open mindedness, I decided to go with the benefit of the doubt 
and tell everyone who cares about our event.

People often ask me why I walk around picking up my flyers of the gorund, even the ones that 
were steped all over or got wet and smushed up?.... so I tell them, It is important to recycle 
the flyers, it saves paper, energy and money.  

I instruct all my promoters to eficiently hand out flyers and not to leave them laying around.  
I unfortunently can not be everywhere at once.  I apreciate you telling me about this, I had no 
idea.  I will look into this and try to find out which one of my promoters was at that event and 
get to the botom of this.  It sadens me that this hapened, but shit hapens and people make 
mistakes, or unintentional drop flyers on the ground acidently.  Who knows, but thank you for 
telling me. I apreciate it.

> Doesn't work too well with alcohol now does it?

	The penalties for giving alcohol to minors are not draconian.
	There's a general atmosphere of social tolerance for alcohol.
	But I agree, it might not work out that way. Still, my 
	experience at a young looking age 14 when I returned to
	the US from Greece (where there is no drinking age, and
	I used to get alcohol quite easily) was that it was easier
	to get marijuana than beer.

	Assuming an age limit of 18, 16 & 17 year olds will probably
	have fairly easy access. 12 year olds won't.

I think everyone knows this.  Fundamentally, the qualities that people
would like to be restrictive about are things like maturity,
responsibility, respectfulness, and such.  But there's no easy way to
measure these qualities, so once you've decided to expand what you're doing
(raves, or anything) beyond the people you know intimately, you have to
give up some degree of control over them.  But not necessarily all--there's
a lot of ways to regulate indirectly.  Some are very simple and have only
minor drawbacks--taking care who you tell or how you advertise, for
example--but are correspondingly weak guarantees of the sort of person
you'll attract.  And if you feel that certain risks are too great or
certain costs are too high, you may want a stronger guarantee.  If you can
come up with some sort of statistical connection between an easy-to-measure
quality--say, age--and your hard-to-measure target-- "maturity" --then you
can get that stronger guarantee by testing people on the easy one.  And
yes, it will be unfair; you're bound to get false positives and negatives
both.  But maybe the tradeoff's acceptable.

It's matter of judgement on all counts, of course: weighing the risks and
costs, establishing correspondences, evaluating the tradeoffs.  But these
are things that can be reasonably discussed or argued about without this
sort of "it IS"/"it ISN'T" yammering, crying discrimination, and so on.

I was just watching Late Night w/ Conan O'Brian and they were talking
with the actor John Frank Lezamo, and Conan asks him about his "dancing
hobby". "Oh yea!" Frank says, he's "totaly into the rave scene". "First"
he says, "you gotta get some E!" Then procedes to grab this big canister
of capsules with that big RX symbol on it. Conan's sidekick-dude  starts
to dig on em and pops one after another into his mouth. "*Then yew hav
two git into this british accent and be real violent" John says as he
jumps behind the chairs and throws on a black sweater and runs over to
this... well it can only be described as a one/two person rave area,
with some strobes and cool colors. Some cool trance breaks out full on.

"ARE YOU GOING TO RAVE WITH ME?!?" Yells John.

"Uhh.. you rave first then I'll jump in."

And you know, this guy can dance pretty good! Even though he funky/dumb
sometimes. Then Conan starts busting in trying to do some break dancing.

I have a tape if anyone whats to check it out.

Subject: Young ravers
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Hey all!

	All the talk I've heard and all the posts I've read regarding young
ravers (or candy ravers, or teeny-boppers, or whatever) has been most
discouraging, and it got me to thinking: how 'bout we more experienced
ravers try to show some of the younglings the aspects of the scene that
attract us?  Find out where their raving interest lies, and use that as a
springboard for exploration.  We were young once, too, just maybe not going
to parties.  These young people need to understand that it's not about
hanging out in some big tripper's den, but rather that it's about people
joining together through music and dance.  Beyond that, there are plenty of
additional spins people could put on the concept of the rave scene.
	I challenge each of you to someday make an effort to school at
least one young raver.  The more of them who spread the "good news," the
more of their friends might check in for good reasons, and the less we
might see of clueless kids just out of their minds.
Do you hear the bell ringing?  Class is about to start ;)
Love and peace,
Eric

if anyone's every down in la, also check out metropolis hosted by jason
bentley, on kcrw 89.9 fm.  jason bentley was the editor of urb for years
and has been heavily involved in the l.a. scene.

I have always felt, and you can check the archives, that we are the new
Roman Empire.  People are , in general, lemmings, and lemmings can be
easily led...right over a cliff.

Bread & Circuses for the masses, Ultimate Fighting Challenge, Children
getting murdered, people covering thier asses, the rich stay free, the poor
go to jail (nobody on death row is/was ever rich), and all of it available
in living color thru the TV.  One great mass of idiots, marching to the
beat of 60hz, pumped right into our headz.

There is great hope:

Read more, turn off the TV (rent movies instead), vote you conscience, and
for your clan.

That's pretty much it.

Livin' highlander style,
John

P.S.  Man, I saw that Rob Roy & Braveheart.  DAMN!  Them Scots are not to
be fucked with!  Cool movies!

Really? Let's look at a similar situation. As others have pointed out a
very disproportionate number of people in prison are people of color. So
it could be argued that statistically, people of color commit more crimes.
(actually more likely that they can't afford to buy justice.) 

Now, do you think it would be an "acceptable tradeoff" to say, limit the
number of people of color in a store at a given time because statistically
the store could show that people of color commit more crime? This is done
every day with young people. We are criminalizing a whole group in our
society based on their age alone. It is no more right than the above
senario. The only difference is that young people have no rights in this
society. What kind of message do you send to young people when you treat
them like criminals until the age of 18? How do you expect them to act?

Finally, I think that many people are making a big, possibly false
assumption here: Anyone under 18 who comes to a party is going to do
drugs, and therefore should not be at the party.

I was happenning to listin to the radio this morning (BTW is rare for me)
but I heard what the radio had to say. They started there little news cast with
sound bytes from the 20/20 fiasco and they just totally made the "rave" scene
look so negative. Then the stupid DJ's went on to say how they have done "E"
and the dangers that it possess. But he went on to say how he liked it and
loved the feeling. Yet enticing young listners to possibly consider taking the
drug and at the same time he is saying how bad it is. He made his self sound
like a total hypocrit. Then some of the listners called in and said that 2 out
of hundreed people that try E die there first time. I Find these stats a little
hard to beleive seeing how I have been going to partys for 4 or 5 years and
have been to countless massives. with tens of thousands of people and never had
heard of any deaths. I was not trying to find any however either but I have
just not heard of two many "rave ecstacy" realated deaths in my time in the
scene. That is not to say that there have not been any cause I bet there have
but 2 out of 100 those facts are wrong or else we would have seen a lot of
people dead at partys. They would have been dropping like flys? I wonder where
these "experts" get there stats from? Sorry but that was my $0.02

Sorry, you are making assumptions again. If you are going to make a
blanket statement like you have, please provide some information to back
it up. Where do you get the idea that a bad acid trip is going to affect
an adult less than a 15 year old, besides your own personal feelings?=20

darkness and DAMN! I wish I would have stayed for the entire Dawn!

You have just explained the reason for our underground-requirement.

Fools in the Media are the most out-of-control aspect in this country...
well, maybe the Web is a larger media fiasco... but who's to blame?

I don't think the Chemical Brothers are interested in keeping it
underground though; Minnesota is just Now getting air play for them
great Bros... 

Peace

this is a little unclear...could you expand on this? are you saying that

I suppose one could ask you if you know how to write.

I listened to what you said. Pretty much sounds like bullshit to me. 

What you said(possible paraphrasing):

"This party is a benefit for the enviroment."
"This party is about sharing and giving." 
"I am not opening up my books." 

When someone says something is a benefit, I take that to mean that most,
if not all profits are going to the cause. For example, Gaimind springs to
mind as a true benefit(and a really diverse crowd too which was cool.) 

Now, you claim that your party is a benefit for the enviroment, but you
refuse to tell us how much money is going to this cause, who the money is
going to, what percentange of the profits are going to this cause or any
meaningful information. All you say is: "The more you give, the more will 
go to the cause." And from your post that cause seems to be primarily your
pocket book. 

> DO YOU CONSIDER THIS RESPECTFULL?  

I consider your post an insult to my intelligence. Apparently a couple
others felt the same way, which is why you received the responses you did.

> WHAT IS YOUR DEFENITION OF PLUR??  

Something that doesn't cost $20, and you can't sell, which is what you are
doing.

Then why did you respond in the first place, screaming all the way?

Hmm. Nope, still seems like bullshit to me. 

You know, I don't think anyone would object if you said "Hey, I am going
to throw a kick-ass party and it is $20." But when you say your party is
the benefit for something, and then are ambigious and defensive about
exact amounts, and start making new-agey, feel-good brotherhood
of man and PLUR statements, it all rings very, very, hollow. This party is
about making *you* money first, and everything else is second. If you were
to just level with people, perhaps you would have some more credibility.

	Right on... spring is nearly here, and all of us experienced
ravers have to spread that *pure* underground vibe which is so fantastic--
since the mainstream always eventually adopts a somewhat diluted version
of whatever is going on underground, I think it's all the more important
that we increase the 'PLUR density level', if you will--that way, the
lessons of raving will carry more impact as they spread everywhere (given
that this year looks like it will be the 'year raves blow up' for better
or worse).  If it can be shown to as many people as possible that DIY is 
the way to go, then DIY will set the standard... (sorry to sound like some 
quasi-prophet or something there ;)
Anyways, I guess you can never overdo it on PLUR, so more more more!
best,
Timothy

WAIT!

No no no no please don't say you don't care about politics!!
NEVER say that, however tempting it may be!  Politics *matter*.
Did you hear President Clinton's proposal?  A 10,000 dollar tax credit
for college tuition!!!  A pledge to make education "The number one 
priority for the next four years."  I know I always stick up for Clinton, 
but believe me the guy knows what's up.  A lot of his ideals match up
with the traditional set of raver ideologies: more education, more
knowledge, and greater global community through advancements in
technology.  
Anyways, I would just love to see ravers more involved in politics,
especially because we have so many great ideas and could actually bring
about some real change.  
And if anyone wants to get good, accurate political coverage, click on
www.washingtonpost.com.   (And no, all you silly SF "the media brainwashes
us and controls the news" people ;) --sorry couldn't resist, I'm a DC
boy--the post can be trusted --remember, they toppled Nixon!)
Local political coverage here sucks, basically because no one at the 
Chronicle can write, but the post is a great read.
Anyway, I've rambled enough I think, but remember--your voice counts
as much as anyone's, so don't be afraid to use it!

"The biggest enemy today is inaction." -Bill Clinton

peace and love,
Timothy

I didnt realize Jay Leno was so multi- faceted:

In this week's SF Weekly there is a full page ad for cds on sale at
Virgin Records.......other than a wonderfully priced domestic version of
'platinum breaks' at a groovilicious price of $12.99...there is a sale
on the most recent mix cd from the United Dj's series....

United DJ's of America 7: San Francisco's own DJ Leno

Maybe one night he'll skip his monologue and just tear it up on the
decks......

I am going to this one, does anyone from San Francisco proper (Mission,
Haight, Hayes Valley, SOMA, Castro, etc.)  need a ride?

I'll be bringing 'me dog and 'me drums, but I have a van and can fit a
couple people provided a few bucks for gas money!

Peace,

Dear ravers, 

	What can I say, I tried to get out a positive message about a positve event, and insted I 
was made to feel like shit for trying.  But That doesn't matter.  A lot of people posted me 
privately suporting what I am doing.  That made me feel good.  Thank you everybody.  

	There is way to much anamosity and politics.  This is the underground......Why can't we 
all just get along??  Isn't that the reason why we went underground to get away from things like 
this???  I don't think there is anythin I will be able to say that will change peoples minds, 
and that is hardly what I wanted anyways.  All I wanted to do was to share my information about, 
what I believe, to be a positive event for a good pursose.  I do not have the luxury or the 
convenience of time to respond to everyones questions.  I am sorry, but I have important work to 
take care of for the party.

For those of you who care enough, and realy want to get to know me, just give ma a call, @ 415-
593-3664.  I will be glad to talk to you, answer all your questions, and get to know you.  I 
hope you do call.  The only thing you may loose by talking to me is your asumtions.

It would be nice to talk to some of you in person, And answer all your questions.  I will try to 
make it to the FnF party this weekend,  If you realy want to talk....find me.  I won't be hard 
to miss.  I will be the guy wearing a t-shirt that says "Money Grubin Sell-Out rave promoter"  
walking around throwing flyers on the ground, and trying to steal money ot of peoples bags. just 
kiding.

I will once again try to leave a copy of my original post, for those of you that missed it the 
first time.  Thank you for you time and bandwidth.

PLUR
Vlad,  415-593-3664  FGE

Subject: Love Is In The Air


The following post contains views and subject mater that might not be suitable for all readers.  
Open mindedness is suggested.

I was not sure I was going to post any information about this party on the net.  I always get my 
head chewed of every time I go out of my way to try and inform the people on this list about my 
events.   I debated for some time whether I was going to subject myself to the aggravation of 
having people misinterpret my intentions and actions and inevitably blow things completely out 
of proportion.  But because of my open mindedness, I decided to go with the benefit of the doubt 
and tell everyone who cares about our event.

The event on Feb 15th is going to be unlike any event we have ever produced.

It is our 5 year anniversary event.  We are going to take everything that we have learned in the 
past 5 years and apply a very generous application of PLUR into making an incredible party.  In 
my opinion, there is no substitute for experience, and there is no excuse for ignorance.   We 
are not holding anything back, this event will break new ground.

This event is all about love.  It is about giving, and sharing.   

It is really hard for me to put my feeling into words when it comes to something as passionate 
an meaningful as this.  All I can say is that this event is going to be like non before, and 
will hopefully set the pattern for other promoters to follow.   If you want to understand what I 
mean, you will just have to experience it for yourself.

The event is a benefit for the environment.  At the party will be tables set up by several non 
profit environmental activity organizations that will receive monetary donations from a portion 
of the proceeds from this party.  Yes StarChild, I said a portion, and NO I will not open up my 
books for anyone to review.  Please lets not start that discussion all over again. 
The better the party does, the more money we will donate.  Your support of this event will be 
directly reflected in our contribution the save our planet and aid in education about 
environmental problems.  It is something that we call - "Edutainment:  Educational 
Entertainment"  This is the direction that We will be focusing all our future events on.

I know that some of you have this certain stigma about "massive" and large parties in general 
for whatever reasons.  That is fine.  I respect your views, and would prefer that you kept them 
to yourselves, or e-mailed me privately.  But for those of you who have always wanted to 
experience a large party with the small party vibe, than don't miss this event.

A party is not measured by its size.  Size has become a barrier that is insinuated to be 
inversely proportional to the vibe of the party.  I can't understand how so many of you got 
suckered into believing this BS.   I believe that the problem lies in the fact that it takes a 
lot of very very very hard work and determination to create a large party with a good vibe.  And 
because it does take so much work, most promoters are more willing to perpetuate the mentality 
that you cannot have a good vibe at a large party, so therefore large parties do not have a good 
vibe.  This to me is the epitomy of laziness, and ignorance.  I don not only believe that large 
party can have a great vibe, I am going to prove it.
  
You see, the vibe is something that is created far before the party takes place.  It is a 
combination of: belief, attitude, motivation, concern, effort, and most of all; inspiration and 
vision.  When these factors collimate with good intentions, the vibe is created.  This is the 
vibe that people take with them to the party.  Vibe is not created by an event at all, it is 
expressed there.  The promoters job is to manifest to expectations that people bring with them 
into reality.  If this is done, then the vibe at the event will be better than good, it will be 
extraordinary.

You can not please everybody.  I used to think you could, and at one time it was possible, but 
the scene is very dynamic, and changes all the time.  Over the past 5 years of throwing parties 
and being involved in the scene, I have seen many changes and I have come up with many of my own 
conclusions as to what is needed to make a good party.  These beliefs will be self evident in 
our anniversary party on the 15th.    

I hope to get a chance to see everybody out there, sharing love, and rejoicing in the goodness 
created by our culture, spirituality, and energy. 

For all the info and DJ lineups and directions, check the SF Raves calendar, and dial the info 
numbers.  Leave me a message if you like or e-mail me.  I would love to hear your opinion or 
suggestions.

Attached is a copy of the Global Party Network News Letter that we sent out.  For those of you 
who do not understand what we are doing at Feel Good Entertainment, maybe this will bring you up 
to speed.

Global Party Network News Letter                  Issue #  2         

Introduction

Dear Global Party Network Members, it is a new year and it looks like it is going to be a 
wonderful and positive year in all respects.  The purpose of this newsletter is to keep 
everybody informed about our upcoming plans as well as sharing information about topics that 
concern our scene and our culture.

The Past Five Years Were Just The Beginning 

It was a Thursday night on Valentine's Day, in 1992, when 200 people crowded into a small 
basement for the first event promoted by Feel Good Productions.  The name has now become Feel 
Good Entertainment, but the vision has not changed, and our mission is still to create positive 
events that make people FEEL GOOD.  Our parties are now safer, legal, more culturally 
diversified, always original, and virtually hassle free.
People often ask me, "What is FGE all about?"  Well, the answer is very simple.  We want to 
create a cohesive medium that culminates  Music, Dance, Spirituality, Expression, and Awareness, 
so that it promotes Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect for everything.  It means more than just 
throwing outrageous parties, it's producing incredible dance collectives for meaningful reasons.  
We are a dynamic organization with real concerns about our community, our culture, and the 
direction of the rave scene.  We work year-round on creating this cohesive medium that we called 
the Global Party Network.  By networking everyone's resources, we want to create a powerful 
organization that will maintain the integrity of the reason why we 'RAVE'.  This is what FGE is 
all about.   We are all the Rave Generation.  Lets keep it REAL.   

97 and Beyond 

The GPN (Global Party Network) has many aspects.  These include; The  Buzz-Line, Global Party 
Productions, The GPN News, GlobalParty.Com., the Membership Card Program, and YOU.  These are 
just some of the things that make up the GPN and much more is being worked on daily.  The 
following will hopefully bring everybody up to speed on the past, present, and future of  the 
GPN.   
Three years ago, we started the Buzz-Line.  This information resource is to help ALL promoters 
pass on their event info, and to help ALL ravers find out about all the parties and clubs.  We 
provide this service to spread the word about positive parties going on and to keep people 
informed and aware of our culture.  This service is free to you, but for us, it is expensive and 
time consuming to operate and maintain.  Sometimes 'Shit Happens' and it breaks down,  but we 
are still doing our best to make it even more reliable and dependable.   In the event that there 
are problems with the new number, 415-569-3300,  then please call the FGE info line @ 415-568-
1338 for updates or changes.   We plan on expanding the Buzz-Line with many surprises this 
year, so keep calling.
Global Party Productions is the engine that creates FGE events.  You are all members of the GPN, 
therefore Global Party Productions are parties for you.  Every one of our events is a growth 
experience.  With each party, we learn and improve the way we do things.  As always, we make 
sure that all of our events are positive for you, the community, and our culture.   We 
have always made some form of  donation to non-profit organizations, whether the event made a 
profit or not.  It is our ultimate goal to eventually expand Global Party Productions into a 
'Benefactory' collective, producing 100% beneficial events for our community.  This might still 
be a ways down the road but we plan on setting up our events so that each time we are able to 
contribute more, until we reach our goal.   This will give all of our events a method of 
channeling the positive vibe created at the parties into a meaningful direction.   Makes me FEEL 
GOOD just thinking about it.
What you are reading now is our second issue of the Global Party Network News.  We hope that 
this grows and becomes something informative and meaningful as a regular periodical of the 
network.  In future issues, we would like to see articles contributed by some members of the 
GPN.   Your comments, views, and questions are always welcome.  Please feel 
free to submit any articles, stories, poems, or artwork to us anytime.  If you have something 
you want to share with us, please fax it to 415-654-9354, or send it to Feel Good Entertainment,  
951 Old County Rd.  Suite # 217, Belmont, CA.  94404.
By summertime, the GPN will be online.  Our domain is registered @ WWW.GlobalParty.Com.   We 
will let you know as soon as it is ready.   If you want to contribute to our website, please 
leave a message on our voice mail. 
The GPN is like a support mechanism for our rave community.   Many of you already have the 
membership card, most of you don't.  If you did not pick yours up at Megga-Buzz, they will be 
available at the GPN booth at Love A-Fair on Feb 15th.   The card program will get you discounts 
at clubs, parties, food, merchandise, and other services that support the GPN.  It is just 
our way of saying thanks for your support.  Keep calling the Buzz-Line for updates.  
This is just the beginning of the GPN.  We have a lot of incredible ideas on how to create our 
network.  It will take a lot of hard work and a great deal of support.  By working together we 
can accomplish more than our wildest dreams.  Lets show the world the power of  RAVING. 

A Very Special Celebration of Unconditional Love.

How much do you love raving?  Does raving love you back?  What does it mean to you?   What do 
you get out of it?  Is it about the music, the dancing, the energy, the spirituality, the 
people, or the whole scene?  Why do you do it?  The answers to these questions are the reasons 
for this party.    In our own individual ways, we all have an intimate love affair 
with raving.  It means a lot more to us than just partying or dancing, it is the ritualistic 
devotion and dedication that makes us all feel good about ourselves when we know that our 
partying has a positive message, that it has a purpose,  a deeper meaning, and a direction.  
That is what creates our love affair with raving. 	
Valentine's is a reason to express love and affection.  This Valentine's, lets share our 
unconditional love.  Our five year birthday party is a festival dedicated to environmental 
awareness and consciousness.  A portion of our proceeds will be donated to several non-profit 
environmental activity programs.  Lets show our love for Mother Earth by helping to 
conserve our natural resources and  to protect our only planet. 
This party will be set up like a small festival, or like a FAIR (get it??)    We do not want to 
give away all the surprises, but I'll put it like this -  we are putting a lot of passion into 
this party.  It is our five year anniversary and we aren't going to do anything short of 
spectacular to celebrate this event.  We have a wonderful, fully permitted, centrally located, 
indoor and outdoor, Bay Area location.  Take a look at the flyer and read it carefully - this 
party is going to break new 
ground.  As always, we are going to do our best to create a large party with the small party 
feel.  We will do our part and set up the event, but you are the one that will set the vibe, so 
please come prepared to share your love with everybody, and it will turn out to be a very 
memorable night full of fun, excitement, and absolutely excellent music.
	We have enclosed a special gift for all GPN members.  It is a cutaway coupon on the bottom 
of the flyer.  This is just a small way to show you our love and appreciation for your support.  
We look forward to seeing you all on Feb 15th.  Get there early, or you might miss some of the 
incredible surprises that we have in store for you, and please recycle the flyer by sharing it 
with a friend. 

Tagging - Its Not Cool At All !!!! 

Graffiti is Art, but Tagging is Vandalism.  It's destroying our scene.  Here is a list of 
locations that will never again be used for raves because of tagging; Cow Palace, Richmond 
Civic, Henry J. Kaiser, Vallejo & Sonoma County Fairgrounds, Fashion Center, Concourse, 
Galleria, Santa Cruz Civic, and many more.  It costs the rave scene money by making raves 
more expensive, and gives us a bad image by giving society the wrong impression.  Please protect 
and respect our scene, as well as the art form of graffiti  by  putting an end to tagging before 
we run out of places to have raves.   Please spread the word.

Editorial  (Just My View on Things) 
 
Music is has a special way of distinguishing people and separating generations.  The 60's gave 
us Hippies.  In the 70's it was Disco.  The 80's brought us Rock and Roll, and now it's the 
90's, and everybody is raving to house music.   Raving is becoming  more and more accepted every 
day.  What started as underground music and parties has grown to become a major influence in our 
lifestyles and attitudes.  Some things, such as the spread of  Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect 
(PLUR) are good for society, and we feel proud about this positive contribution from our 
culture.  Other things, such as the exploitation of the culture by mainstream capitalization, 
are less appealing.  We can't sit around and wish for things to get better, because they won't.  
However, our attitudes, participation, and behavior can influence the expansion of raving 
in a more positive direction, bettering society.  We have a very unique heritage, and it would 
be a shame if it was forgotten or misunderstood.  It is up to each one of us to figure out what 
we can do to influence society's perception of our generation.  It's no longer 'Just Do It', 
it's about doing it the right way for all the right reasons.  Lets show our pride.  This is our 
time.  We are the Rave Generation.

FGE did not host the New Years party...

Every FGE party I have been to has;
Gone all night
Been lots of fun
Never ran out of water
Had a fat line-up
Great visuals
Lots of smiling ravEr people
Ect.

Cool World did blow it on New Years though.
			 	But I had fun.

> FGE did not host the New Years party...

        OK, but Ray did send out a bunch of mail before Planet
New Year saying basically the same things he's saying now about
his upcoming party. Clearly, there is some affiliation between
FGE & CW, though they are not precisely the same entity. So, if
you want to, you can read my question this way:

        "What does FGE do differently from CW that will make
         this FGE party better than CW's Planet New Year?"                      
> CW did blow it on New Years, though

	Which is why I'd like to hear what's going to be different.

	I *do* have an open mind, but when I hear from Ray that some
	parties going to be great, then it turns out to be a total 
	bust, I'm going to think twice about the next party Ray tells
	me is going to be great. Just like I would with anybody else,
	nothing personal.

Dear friend,

	The climate of the sfraves list has become entirely to vicious.
I haven't read the whole text of your original post yet, but I
will do so.  For now, I will offer that many UG ravers
are coming to detest anything that's high-production/high-cost
(AKA "massives"), because they see it as voracious capitalism,
corrupting something that they'd rather maintain as pure as possible.
	I do not share this feeling.  The Gathering changed my mind
about massives in general.  There are some promoters who have found
other promoters to have impure motives, and justifiably so, but that's
no reason, IMHO, to blanket all promoters who wish to put together
extra-special events, even if those events *will* generate tall bank.
	I've never been to a party and come away from it feeling as
though I didn't get my pure chewing satisfaction (my money's worth).
I know how to be selective.  It's not my place to condemn others, no
matter their motives or actions, but I do feel, very strongly, that no
one is welcome in the scene who wants to exploit it solely for their
own gain or aggrandizement (sp?).  At this point, I don't see you as
that type.  Until and unless I have proof positive to the contrary, I
will support you.
	There, I've done it: stuck my neck out.  Is that a headsman's
axe I hear whistling my way?  OK, I'm posting too much again.  I'll
quiet down now...
Peace, PLEASE!
Eric

I went and looked at the FAQ again, and noticed something.

You left out the second portion of the paragraph which is:

Hmm, the whole statement looks just a little bit different now when put
back into context, wouldn't you say?

i remember at that huge rave behind the "home base" shop, there were signs
all over the place saying "peace love unity respect" and i was getting
confrontational dominance-assertion attitudes from the security people and
the other people at the rave.

it was just another example of good principles being used to make money.
the environmental movement is an example of a movement which has had all of
its rhetoric debased in this way, with logging groups giving themselves
grass-roots environmentalist group names, and spouting about "wise use" (ie,
clearcutting).

I cut out that section because it was not relative to our *private*
disscussion about LSD users at a young age. At least, it was private
untill you decided to send it to the list. And with "LSD is a killer?"
as the header no less. Not that you don't have a right to do so. But
excuse my language, you're just being a bitch by doing in such a contex
as to try to make me look like I'm calling LSD a fatal drug. You seem to
be the kind of person that must "win" an argument. You asked for
something to back up what I said. I'm still not shure what exactly you
want to see. So I tried to find something in the LSD FAQ and you make a
point to attack me for it publicly. When did I ever say LSD was a
killer? Where does it say in any of the quoted text? This is not a
disscussion about weather LSD 'is a killer' or not anyway. Explain to me
why you find you must take it upon yourself. And if you can stomach such
a difficult task, please respond to me privately.

I'm agruging this whole age thing because I am concerned with the safety
of others. Why are you?

	I have a feeling this is more along the lines of trip with people
one respects (and maybe the two or more will become truely closer because
of it?) not just to trip with a bunch of people every week because it
allows an individual to become someone other them themselves for a bit
("sorry man, I was <insert drug slang here> real hard". "Oh well, you were
<insert same type of drug slang here> real hard, well it's ok then"). Just
what I think I see in that phrasing.

....hey,hey,....for the older ravers it sometimes feels like post or die.
If not, one simply fades into the hyperreal archives...My last party was the
Cloudfactory NYE so I got enough rave energy to power my life for a
while.....that and spinning at home...Rave parties of one.  The upside of
that is I get to pick the records and there are no cops or 15 years olds bad
tripping on drugs, etc.  However, I do miss "being there....and dancing with
the tribe...."

Anyway, when the cloudfactory boys posted that they a found another
spot..the CSUMB Black Box cabaret to play at on Tues...I said to
myself.."SpinSilver should be at the Spin Cycle!!""" Besides they are the
kinda people one likes to support, cause they're hearts in the right spot,
and they're do'in it right.....

It was on the old fort ord military base, so they was kinda fun.  It was an
old army barracks, coverted into a college coffee house.  Scott said they
had about forty people last week, but there were only about 15 hail and
hearty this week.  It always takes awhile to build a weekly.....WE danced
and had fun...It will be a cool place to play it LOUD!!!!!

Definately try to make it in two weeks for Astronaut Scott and Maya....they
will tear it up. Definately.

Bye the bye,..all this talk about age limits gets me to wondering.  I hope
no one starts thinks that there should be an old age limit for parties.
..."Sorry, you're over forty, you can't come in...you'll spoil the vibe...go
away old raver dude!!!!  Go play your Lawerence Welk records, and waltz
yourself to death...That's the knock I used to get sometimes,  "What are you
doing here?"

The younger ravers actually need the older ravers to shoe them the way to
responsible raving and responsible drug use, or the joys of sober
raving...(I do both). I actually miss the wizened, and sagacious voices of
Geoff White, and Lee Fogel, who were able to provide so much insight, with
so much love and experience.....

I hope to play at the Spin Cycle in a few months...just so I could say, come
and hear SpinSilver@Spin Cycle, it almost rhymes............

Well it sounded like a good argument.  by most accounts, LSD is very benign
and there is no LD50 for it.  I would say that LSD is killer, AND it IS 
"The Bomb" too..... :-D
of course, you MUST know something about proper usage, and not be an unstable
person.  I've met people who've done it 500+ times, and they could easily
pass as "straight" and my dad would probably like them too.  :)
anyways, couldn't pass up a the chance.....

You know, the viciousness of SFRavers is wrecking my PLUR much more than 
any massives happening this weekend...

Values mean nothing if preached but not followed.  And to skewer some 
promoter or other for not showing "enough" respect/love/etc. is almost 
laughably hypocritical.

Massives are not by definition evil.  They are huge productions that
require a larger ticket price.  Why is a small $15 Harmony party just
dandy, and a huge massive, just five dollars more, with dj's from all over
the country/world, permitted space, lightshows, etc. suddenly the fount of
all evil?  On that note, why does a $20 Martin party get the blessing of
SFRavers, while a $20 Feel Good party get roasted (a nice word for it)? 

I am not a fan of commercialism, the general attitude at commercial 
parties, or the prospect of turing "rave" into a profitable commodity.
But if our intent is to create a positive and loving community, we need 
to start living by the values we are demanding others to follow (and, 
seemingly,  being arbitrary about who gets labeled pure and who is a rave 
outlaw!)

Massives _are_ commercial ventures, and this is enough to brand them bad 
- or at least suspect - in many people's eyes (including mine!).  But 
massives ARE how most people are exposed to our scene.  By highlighting 
PLUR and benefiting good causes, massives are in fact EXPOSING people to 
these ideals.  We can grumble about their "exploiting" these ideals to 
entrap idealistic - and, I guess, stupid - SFRavers into shelling out 
$20, but if a massive doesn't meet our elitist definition of what's 
_really_ peace and love, don't we have the mental capacity to evaluate 
that for OURSELVES?  Ever hear the term, vote with your pocketbook??  

Meanwhile, newbies go to a Feel Good and hear these virtues included on
the flier as an integral part of the party, something they are told to be
aware of before even coming to the event.  Do they have the cynical eyes
we do?  Or are they then opened in a way?  And for us old cynics who laugh
at the idea of PLUR at (certain) $20 parties, there still is a damn good
dance event for our money. 

I personally cringe when I see Vlad post, because I know he will be the 
recipient of an unbelievable torrent of verbal abuse from peaceful, 
respectful underground ravers.  What is his crime, exactly?  Daring to 
mention the virtues peace, love, unity, respect while charging money?  Then 
why aren't other promoters held to that same standard?

We have promoters who are charged with attempting to have someone stabbed 
to death.  We have promoters who had a person beat to a pulp in 
front of hundreds of people in line for a "party".  Where is the outrage 
over these _real_ outrages??!  Is Feel Good Entertainment some sort of 
sacrificial lamb, some syphon into which we can sublimate all the rave 
scene's problems?  A convenient scapegoat, because the promoter dares to 
post on SFRaves.

A $20 party isn't the problem.  Making our touted values real is what 
_really_ needs our attention.

Because I love the scene,
and all of you,
Nancy

Damn..  

  This scientific veiw, makes no scence to me..
  LSD can make you one wacked out individual. No matter what you read. This
is a fact.  LSD is not something you want to use as frequently as, POT for
say.
  Even last week (if my story is staight)  I heard that some girl raped her
self in a closet, on LSD.. Let this be a leson to you little kiddies on
Acid.

  I myself dropped out of school becouse, I spent all my lunch money on
Acid. But what a trip lunch was everyday though.
  I would buy two hits of acid everyday, save one, and take the other. At
the end of the week, I would take all the hits I saved and pop them all at
once. Up to as many as 20 assorted hits!  And Acid gets weeker every
century. So you could amagine how high I was ten years ago.
  My Dad, and step Mom were all drunk one night.  And..  Me and my older
brother ended up frying with them.. Anyone else ever fry with there
parents?  Ha.

  It's just a freaky drug.
 Being an Acid head sucks.

you've got a good point here.  there's always 2 sides to this coin, 
though.  security perhaps gets stressed out because it's friggin HARD to 
control a crowd that size.  quite often your life can be on the line 
(this has been proven a few times where people have been trampled to 
death).  of course, that doesnt' really give security any special 
privelege to be agressive, but i've noticed that agressive people have 
different motivators, and people do things for their reasons, not ours, 
wouldn't you agree?  =]

this is verry true.  this is true in all industries.  that's why i 
believe that $$ is a crude way to value items and services and will 
eventually (probably not in our lifetime, but definitely in the next 
couple of hundred years) not exist.  

but be careful, try to keep your mind open at all times, otherwise you 
might miss a perfectly legitamite environmental movement that is actually 
enacting change!  

not everyone does things to save the planet.  duh!  of course.  but if we 
can start using that to our advantage.  some people just like to have 
fun.  

well, that's enough from me...fog

I agree with this sentiment.  When i first started raving i didn't care 
who i bought from or if i bothered to drink water or anything - all i 
wanted was to GET FUCKED UP and PARTY!  but these days i find that i have 
MORE fun if i actually pay attention to my body and my companions 
respectfully.  I learned this slowly over the years, and i wish i hadn't 
been so hard on my system as i was in the past ... ya know?

What's wrong with a 14 year old going to a rave with an adult.  I'm not
talking 30 and over.  Just someone at least eighteen who agreed to stay
sober for the evening.  They have designated drivers.  Why can't we have
designated ravers.   I know how parents worry about where their rebellious
young kids are, and I think I would feel safer if someone older was at a
party where there was probably going to be drugs, anyway.  I like the idea
of "escort" service.  It would make parents feel a little more at ease and
hopefully more accepting of rave culture.  Although my solutions for my son
when he gets older will be:    Andrew  "Mom, I'm going to a rave"
                       Mom     "Who's spinning, and can I go too, pleeze? I
won't take e and embarrass

you in front of your friends, promise"
                       Andrew  "Okay mom, you can go, just drive us home."
                       Mom     "WOO HOO!"

 Yeah, it's just side splitting how people will use pieces of communiques 
to justify their position. Certain factors in Christianity have been 
doing it for a long time.

 Interesting. So BA sent, I would imagine, a reply to Pengo and then 
added in the SFraves address by accident? This from such a

Actually, if I remember rightly, a LOT of flame wars have happened as a

shut up about it! :)  Massives in general almost always seemed to get flamed
overall.  I think that in this case, it's happening more so because it's (at
least from what I've seen) pretty rare that massive promoters actually come
onto sfraves and advertise as much as Feel Good has.  And another thing, a
point correctly raised by Black Adder, is that the offense is not
necessarily in simply having a $20 party (which does cause enough of an
outrage in & of itself), but rather that Vlad appears to be advertising a
party that is "for charity" but is not upfront at all about the details of
that intent.  I don't personally feel that a promoter is required to open
his books to us any more than any other capitalistic venture we frequent
(such as the stores we shop in, etc), but in situations where large amounts
of money will be collected "for charity", it seems more reasonable to want
to know where our money is going and how much is going there.  I would.  If
something is really being for charity, there should be no reason to hide the
details, imo.  And Vlad, this is not intended to be a flame towards you, but
I do think perhaps you could have handled the questions differently (as
could have the flamers, imo), it doesn't help your credibility (which you
appear to be working very hard for) to immediately clam up about things that
people will be sensitive about such as where & how much of their hard-earned
money is going.  If you really are as PLURy as you say, you need to look to
your real goal here  (sound of shawna giving Vlad the benefit of the doubt
cuz she doesnt know him).

Blah blah blah.

Ok, I'm done!

Love,

When I said "maybe," I meant maybe.  As in "may be the case, for some
people, in some circumstances."  I wasn't just rhetorically suggesting
something that I believe in myself.  And did you miss the "matters of
judgement" paragraph?  Some people probably would think it wise to limit
blacks or gangstas or whatever in their store.  Well, that's them
exercising their judgement, but it doesn't have anything to do with me.
Same for people who decide they want to restrict ages for their parties.
I'm just describing a method of addressing a problem, which anyone is free
to apply or not in any situation, whatever they think best.  I don't say
it's right or wrong, or that you should or shouldn't--it's a matter of
judgement.

I brought it up because I wanted to make clear the details of what I think
is really going on when people say, "There are real risks to having younger
people at a party, so maybe we should set an age limit."  It didn't look
like discussion was headed in a productive direction; I thought suggesting
some kind of rational framework and exposing some details might help people
argue more usefully.

This is the kind of thing I meant by unproductive discussion.  They're
huge, categorical statements, strident and vague at the same time; it's
just too easy, especially in brief, casual discussions, for this sort of
argument to turn into yes-it-is/no-it-isn't, or just to go nowhere.

>Finally, I think that many people are making a big, possibly false

Now this is a bit more like it.  This is the sort of detail I was hoping to
call attention to by looking at the way people rationalize restrictions by
age.  It's a smaller claim, so easier to assess in itself, and you can also
look at the role it would play in the kind of argument I outlined, how it
does or doesn't support the conclusion, fits with other elements, and so
on.

Just got word that a huge, superbulous project I've been clamoring to get on 
came through..... and it's Mine Alone!

Oh boy, some good news finally from work, but it dashes all plans for both Fri 
and Sat night.  SOOOO...

FnF on Sunday is gonna ROCK!!   Even though I have nothing to do with throwing 
it, I Nathan will personally guarantee everyone who goes a good time.  Through 
sheer determination and force of will thou shalt be done. Just like that 
demonic little boy on an old Twilight ZOne episode  who, if he detects "unhappy 
thoughts",  can change anything in the world to suit his whims just by thinking 
it so (or the take-off of it on a Simpson's Halloween Special  [Bart turns 
homer into a jack-in-the-box  and makes Snowball breathe fire]).  Thus, THIS IS 
YOUR ONLY WARNING.  THINK ONLY HAPPY THOUGHTS ON SUNDAY  OR YOU WILL BE TURNED 
INTO A JACK IN THE BOX.


This is not a joke. 






just try to dance, Jerky,  when you can't even get out of your box 'cause no

doo-doo   doo-doo-dee-doo-doo  song that indicates its now time to spring 
out.   Yah, think about it.

Macadio!

Thanks for sending us your tape, and also for your great message the other

playing...

Email me again and I'll give you my phone #.  

See you Sunday at Fnf?  Please say hi...just ask around for Ann of the New

This has been an interesting thread...

I have to admit I feel most comfortable at parties where all age groups
are represented.  That includes teens, 20s, 30s, and beyond!

I won't tell you my age, but let's just say I ain't no teenager. *smile*

In fact, it's been so many years since I haven't been a teenager that I'm
starting to get damned maudlin about the youth.  I sure do miss the
energy, the freshness, the dreamy innocense, and even the angst I used to
feel when I was that certain age.  

As an ocassional thrower of parties, I do get a little nervous when I see
folks under the age of 18 doing dangerous stuff.  Because I can't help it-
I feel responsible for them because they're young and I want to protect
them from doing stupid things that they'll regret later.

Even so, I love it when young people come to parties because it makes me
feel young, too. Ever see an older cat play with a kitten?  It's the
cutest thing...the older cat acts all annoyed at first, and then starts
getting into it, and eventually acts like a kitten itself.

Respect,

Ann

        I have a psychology class this quarter and I was doing a report

of 13 students (most of which are over 30).

        I'd greatly appreciate if you could write some of your experiences:
good, bad, etc and tell me of the diffirent drugs you've been interested in,
why, when you did them, why you think that you chose them, and any type of
general info you may know about any type of drug. Nicotene, alcohol, all
drugs are included. 

        Also, any rumors about the effects of the drugs, or the actual long
and short term effects of which you know about.

        My class isn't aware of our knowledgeable (is that spelled right)
community and I won't really bring up anything about raves. But we've all
had experiences that I'm sure they couldn't even dream of. 

        Thanks a bunch. . . lotsza hugz. . .

Once, as Tiffy, Robby, Tyndall, Dano, Matt, Brian, Lotus, Kim and I sat in
GG park...visiting the spirit of the mushroom... 

I thought (out loud) "next time, i'll be born as a bird, so i can just...


fly away..."

And as I flew away in time from that magical day...

The birds were all i could see.  

One paper square, one large tylenol (code word then was 'cookies'), wet, 
squishy, long bladed grass, the impending blistering sacramento sun, 
booming black speakers oozing Markie Mark's fat vibes; they were all it 
took to make me see those birds.  

I could see their feathers.  

There were five.  

And then their energy amplified and I saw a bright light...

I was crouching down, talking to Martin and Julian.  but it wasn't me 
talking, it was the birds.  All of a sudden I felt like ALL of the 
answers were in my brain, I just didn't have a mouth big enough to tell 
everyone.  

It was a gift from the birds.  

And as the light diminished, one of the birds looked at me from afar and 
said, "go.  throw rocks in the American River."  

And as the first rock hit, and as I put sunscreen on my body to protect 
it from the now blistering 100 degree + Sacramento heat, I thought...

I touched God.  

but when Capt. Sisko visited the wormhole people, 

there were no birds.  

only images.  

images of people saying...

"they are linear.  it

				limits 	
			them."

And all I am doing is pointing out the error and unacceptability to me of
judging people in this fashion. It is outrageous to do so with a
group of people based on their race, but it is acceptable to do so based
on peoples age. A very serious contradiction.

How is it at all unproductive? I offered a specific example, limits on
the number of people that can be in a store based on their age.

People tweak out at raves all the time, and while it's not a _good_
thing, we tend to do what we can and take it in stride.  How come
everyone's getting all worked up about it because of where a person's
birthday happened to fall?

There are plenty of irresponsible old people, and plenty of together
young people.  To draw a line in the sand is ridiculous and exposes all
our talk about peace, love, and unity as a flat lie, to be discarded
when  in conflict with our prejudices.

The problem with this woman was most likely ignorance; ignorance of the
chemical she was putting into her body.  The solution to ignorance is
education, not prohibition.

Alcohol is as much of a drug as pot or acid, in that you can fuck
yourself up on it just as much.  You can even kill yourself if you
want.  Most European countries have NO DRINKING AGE, and much less of an
alcohol problem than the US.  Why?  It doesn't have the allure of
illegality, and as a legal substance its problems can be addressed
directly and straightforwardly.  

What do we get?  "Just Say No."  So kids find out that you won't
immediately die from one toke (contrary to the propaganda) and decide
that _all_ the warnings must be bullshit, since obviously you can't
trust adults to give you the truth.

> And I'm not talking about keeping kids out
> for our sake. It's for their sake.

Listen to yourself.  This sort of sanctimonious bullshit is exactly why
your kids will come to hate you.  The solution to ignorance is
education, not prohibition.

Gods protect me from all the people ready to prevent me from doing
something "for my sake".  This is another No-Cost Moral Judgment (tm),
which I just got finished ranting about.

And turning away young people will cause less deaths how?  Of the (very
few) deaths in the scene, how many were underage?

I like the idea of ensuring a maximum number of responsible people at
any gathering, whether through free admission or otherwise.  As a 100%
drug-free raver, which includes the legal drugs of caffeine and alcohol,
I know I will be able to deal with whatever panic situation might
happen.  

The key is "How can we take responsibility for our actions?"  This
problem is not solved by excluding arbitrary age ranges.

PS: I am well over 21 and have no personal stake in this matter.

I don't classify going to a rave wired to the gills "sober raving".  All
these are DRUGS.  Don't fool yourself.  The fact that they are legal
does not mean they are not drugs.

Black Adder has been riding Ray hard for not opening books.  I suspect
part of the reason has to do with cashflow and taxable income (nudge
nudge, wink wink, of course I'll have to deny this), but how about a
compromise:  just say how much will go to which environmental org?

Like, for instance, <x> dollars for each paid admission after the <y>th?

It's a little confusing because it's being left unsaid, but the reason
age limits are being discussed is because people fear that, due to the
increased media attention, the authorities are going to start *really*
cracking down on raves.  It's all being driven by parents' fears.

It only has to get a little bit worse before laws get passed and promoters
start going to jail.  At that point the "scene" is going to be only
1) 21+ clubs and 2) totally underground, word of mouth small gatherings.
People just won't risk throwing parties when they can get taken to jail,
sued, fined, sound systems confiscated, etc.

So I think what we're seeing is a little proactive thinking to get
things under control before "raves" are outlawed entirely.

Insulting my intelligence. Spouting all this PLUR, brotherhood of man, and
"this party is a benefit for the enviroment" *BULLSHIT* while being vague
and ambigious and refusing to answer questions in this forum because "he
doesn't have time." He had time to post a bunch of marketing crap, and use
S.F. Raves as his personal billboard, but doesn't have time to respond to
peoples posts. 

There is a great advantage in dealing with this group of people, because
there are so many good-intentioned, trusting folks here. It's a great
market, unwitting dupes.

Speaking out against those opportunists that wish to twist and

me.

Are you going to Vlads party?

I ride anyone hard when they make dubious claims about their largess. 

And to anyone I ask this information of, I will *gladly* and without
hesitation hand them my 1040's. *I* don't have anything to hide. 
Why do you, supposed "community" member?

Works for me. Remember however, he hasn't even said who the money is
going to exactly. But I think Vlad is too busy answering all those
private votes of support to reply.

Subject: Need a ride to Evolution!!
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hey, it's me again.
  Yes, I posted yesterday, but as of right now, I'm still in my own
transportational limbo, not finding the currents to pull me out.  If anyone
is going to Evolution... wait, scratch that.  If anyone wants to give me a
ride to Evolution, I would be very thankful to them.  I'm not even asking
for a ride back (although I may be, come 7am ;) so as to minimize
liabilities on your part.
  Geez, I just reread the first paragraph and it sounds really sarcastic.
Sorry about that; it's not my usual vibe.  I'm just bummed that the $600 i
just spent on my car was to go to parties like this one and now I've still
got my foot in the same hole, only it's got a better grip of my shoe this
time and this pair has already cost me 600 bucks!  (Now that I look again,
it looks like my arm and leg are already in there too!)  And while I oft
claim that thinking is the best way to travel, i wouldn't mind the company
of a nice smile (or two :) in a Honda Civic or something.  Anyway, I better
stop before this sarcasm goes to bitterness.  Pleasepleasepleaseplease
pretty please with super-sticky on top, can someone _please_ help me out?  
(408.998.0581, and I'm near SJSU)
Peace & Love

So, basically you were an addict. And while condeming LSD, you brag about
gobbling down as much as you could chew.  The logic escapes me.

	Because when an adult stupidly takes too many drugs and tweaks
	it is legally and ethically considered their own personal problem.
	They are supposed to be old enough to know better, and if they
	aren't it is nobody's fault but their own. When a minor does the
	same thing our legal system & *some* ethical systems hold the
	adults around them responsible.

 You know BA you seem to act like your fucking god or something. Why 
don't you put your keyboard where your mouth is and throw your own party. 
Put up the money, hire the talent, secure the space, deal with the cops 
and tweakers, blah, blah blah. It sure is a lot easier to point fingers 
thAN TO DO IT YOURSELF.

Hello everyone. I am the new guy from indiana. Does anyone know what
style of techno DJ ESP(WM) and Hyperactive will be spinning? I have
noticed that most of the music that is popular in the Bay area is a
little slower than the stuff I am used to. I WANT HARD acid tracks. Will
this be the case at Stairway to the Headphones on March 1? I am fully
aware that it is really up to what the DJ's feel like playing or what
gets the crowd moving but maybe someone actually knows and they can
share their info with me. Thanks so much.

You fell for that one Randy.  With this hail of inflammatory posts
upon us, you must have forgotten that Mr. Adder is in the habit
of trolling on this list.

Tempers sure have been running hot around here lately.  That age limit
business really got everyone riled up.  Life is full of compromises!
Try not to take these disagreements personally.  Someone will jump in
and make you feel bad if you do, even on SFRaves :(

I always enjoy when people talk about you in the third person, as if you
can't hear them.

I don't troll. People that troll say something inflammatory for the sake
of being inflammatory, which is not what I do. I stand by anything I say.

I heard it in the morining.
I wasn't awake so i thought i was half asleep and dreaming.
All I kept hearing was E this E that.
PLUR,
Paul

People listen to WILD 107.7 because I am gonna call in and talk to them
and tell them not not say anything negative about raves anymore. I will
be nice though.

I do not want to get into the mix about all of this, I just want to say
that I agree with Mike.
I hope everyone who wants to pay $20/$25 to Feel Good and go to Love
Afair does.
Make the most of it if you do and remember it's not wether you win or
loose but how you play the game. Wait a minute that doesn't make since.
Nevermind that. 
I mean, HAVE FUN AT LOVE CARNIVAL. OOOpS! I Mean Love Circus. No Wait
Love Fair. No Thats not it Love Afair.

And if you don't go to Pro-Soy or the better rave the scene night with a
super tight ass line up witch i wont say the name because i am not
suppose to.

Okay Bye.

I think it would be mean if people asked for ID at a rave.
What If you got someone who is young, but can still be a good vibe and is
going sober and loves to dance and then you wont let them in. 
I have only done E twice and a half in my life. I have been raving since
May 24th of 96.
I may be very young, and i still dont know even 1/5 of everything there
is to know about raves yet. I celebrated my 16th B day at Cloud Factory
that was the second time I ever did E. I liked it a lot of course, but
that's not why I rave.
I know that a lot of people, well maybe some on this list know me and
know that I am a cool person. I am not a bad vibe. I understand enough of
the scene to be a good vibe.
People at undergrounds can not believe hoe young I am. They always think
I am much older.
Its not the age. Its the person.

I understand where everyone is coming from, for checking IDs at raves.
It wont make a difference at all. Our maturity and understandign of the
scene isn't on our ID and if anything thats what to check.
Even still how would you check a newbie if they knew nothing.

I beleve from what i know is that raves should have no age limits.

PLUR,
Paul

 I think Ray posted his party to the list becouse, he listens to us. He
actually likes the SFRaves list. And it was an oportunity for him to speak,
to be a part of the list.
 But he never talks on the list otherwise, becouse he knows that he will
just be insulted. Not only stabbed for voicing his opinion, but accused of
not even being worthy of an opinion.
 If he was just thinking about advertisment, I doubt he would of posted.
 If I was him. I would think that posting my party to the list, might only
help to hurt my party, becouse of all the shit talking replies.
 I think if Ray is the one running this FGE show, he is a damn good
business man. He don't need our support.
 Sounds like he just wants to be friends to me.

Sorry to disapoint you, but the main thing we listen to hear is.
Proggressive House and Trance.
Acid House also but not as much.

They do play just about everything, but those are the main things.

 Oh it's okay. i gots me asbestos undies from KMart today. BA can do his

 Actually I'm using BA for Temper Action Control Training (TACT). Since he 
likes to be so nasty, it's real good practice to engage him. especially 
since he backs down when he is losing ground.

I think the whole offencive stratagy of a FLAME WAR is; To ask a person a
question. Then try to twist the answer into something other than what the
defendant meant, to gain an advantage for your offence. While, the whole
time, you are trying to increase your quantity of agree-ers (followers).
 Maybe Ray don't answer your questions because, he don't want to play the
little flame game...

OK, but don't lay it on me.  I'm not saying that people should think this
way, just that they *do*, and so if you want to debate these things, it's
better to address points in that line of reasoning rather than falling into
some kind of "Kids under X can't handle raves," "Yes they can," "No they
can't," "Kids over X don't need their parents' responsibility," "Yes they
do," "It's unfair," "No it isn't" so-called argument.  (By, for example,
drawing analogies...that's perfectly sensible).

I thought the example was restricting people of color.  But that doesn't
matter--I wasn't trying to criticize your example.  I took that bit out of
context, deliberately, just to illustrate a contrast between those sorts of
statements and your final comment.  Something like "we are criminalizing a
whole group based on their age" is a fine claim, great as a conclusion or
summation, but an entire argument drawn with such broad strokes--again,
especially in a brief, informal setting like this one--is, I think,
unlikely to deepen understanding.

Again, I don't mean to criticize your analogies or to contest any claim
about criminalizing youth, or the effects of doing so.  I'm just talking
about types of argument, and what I think would be useful for people who
want to think about the question of age limits for parties.

Does anyone find it a little funny, that ever since some people asked
the mudslinging to stop that there have been a lot less postings?

My 2 cents for today: Keep those positive thoughts flowing and keep the
energy pure...

See you out there...

I'm trying to figure out who Vlad is.  His ideas are sound and
well-thought (apparently), but infringe on the freedom and love
cherished by all Ravers.  Maybe the rules of engagement are
characteristically joined to provide this banter...  has anyone thought
about the positive/negative aspect of Love Vs. Freedom?  Freedom is
restricted by Love, and Love is granted Freedom...   Peace

Just thought I'd let some of you know I have been slapping up some webpages
and one of them has pixs from a BBQ & BEATS, the urls are in my sig. There
still in the construction stage right now so watch out for falling html. If
anyone has any pixs from any of the BBQ & BEATS I'd love to get them so I
can put them up. You can email me the pixs or if we can hook up, I can scan
them and then get the pixs right back to you.

Also, if your picture is up and you don't want it on the web please let me
know and I can remove your picture for you, or at least crop you out of it.

For those that are interested, I'll also be putting update info and
location pixs for the BBQ & BEATS Campout set for June 7-8th 1997 as soon
as I do a site visit.

Later..

He never answered the questions. He refuses to answer the questions, and
remains evasive and ambigious. I much rather have real information that

I think that's the definition of 'underground'.  However, since we are

Well,

	Since it seems that the list has (again) fallen to the usual bickering
that we are oh, so accustomed to (yes, even I am guilty of this crime).
I've decided to go a lil more underground... 

Friday looks like a nice lil house-type party in the lovey hills of
Santa Cruz, or I might do a lil smokin parapanellia shopping in Berkley.
Saturday is New Years and Sat night, well I might just chill @ my homeys
w/a 40 and a blunt (Yea, right).

Hmm... In any case Sunday sounds good for a FnF event...

C-U out there, wherever you may be....

Paz y amor,

No, it's not.  To judge someone by their race is to assume that there
are differences in their character that can be based solely on the color
of their skin, certainly a fallacious assumption.  But to judge someone
based on their age is to assume, regardless of their skin color, social
class, belief system, etc., that greater age TENDS to bring greater
maturity.  Therefore one must assume that a 25 year old will QUITE
LIKELY have more maturity than a 15 year old.  This is a perfectly valid
GENERAL assumption.

Much luv, BA.  I agree with you 9 times out of 10, but not on this
particular issue.

Yes it is, however it can be backed up by statistics.

You are substituting one group for another. I could just as easily say 
"but to judge someone based on their race is to assume, regardless of
their age, social class, belief system, etc. that white people TEND to
commit less crime, given prison statistics. Therefore one must assume that
person of color will QUITE LIKELY commit more crime than a white person.
This is a perfectly valid GENERAL assumption."

Now, a few things:

1) Lest anyone get ready to flame the hell out of me for using issues of
   race in this manner, I in no way condone the above statement as being
   valid or true.

2) I am not disagreeing with the *general* assumption that a 15 year old
   is less mature than a 25 year old, however I am disagreeing with
   the manner in which you draw this conclusion.

3) You make no mention of how it is acceptable to use lack of maturity
   should be used as an excuse to limit the number of "students" in a
   store, which is the example I was offering.

I am including the above to highlight my point, but please, Randy and BA,
I am not singling you guys out.  YOu two are *definitely* not the only
ones involved in this.

I'd just like to point out that the above is an example of a volley of
"I'm right and your wrong."  I just find it tedious and time-wasting.  No
one listens to this pettiness.  It is really ineffectual in getting your
point across.  When this happens it makes the attacker look bad, not the
attackee.  Unless both get going, which so frequently happens.

What is the reason for pointing out every *single* foible that someone
makes?  Let's grow up.  People can make themselves look pretty bad, no one
needs to point it out.  Trying to demean someone (in any way, shape, or
form), is very selfish because you are trying to make yourself bigger at
their expense.  This is just not such a great way to treat others, and in
the end you only hurt yourself.  It takes a bigger person to let things go
and not try and prove themselves rather than take the easy route and get
in an argument.

I'm not saying that *I'm* not guilty, either.  I am well intouch with my
own hypocrisy, as well as that of humankind.  I would just plead with
sfravers to think about what they are posting.  If you find that the
majority of your posts happen to be involved in arguments, maybe you
should think twice before doing this.  You are being selfish to the whole
list and monopolizing a COMMUNITY forum.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not
saying controversy should be avoided, or even negativity, because both
serve there purpose. But, pettiness in large quantities might
be something worthwhile to pass on.

Pick your battles.  There is a lot of energy that could be spent for much
better things.

And to paraphrase Samuel Clemmens, "No one knows of your ignorance until
you open up your mouth and tell them."

-KaySEE

p.s.  If someone feels personally attacked, DON'T.  There is such a thing
as constructive criticism.  I WILL NOT reply to anyone's defensiveness
because THAT is EXACTLY my point!

Yes and no.  Yeah, I'd rather see promoters be responsible, but I 
also would like to see people being taken care of, looked out for.
Communities take care of their young because the young ones don't
know any better.  Part of looking out for them is preventing them
from doing potentially harmful things.

Anyway, I'm getting a bit worn out from all this.  The kiddies 
don't agree, most of the adults do.  That's good enough for now.

"Drawing a line in the sand" as far as age limits go is not 
at all ridiculous.  Unless something is done, you're going to get your
inevitable share of young people at raves who are simply not mature enough
to handle the situation, just as you will also get young people who can
handle it.  But we live in a civilization, where all the rules always have
to be based on percentages--it's all math-based.  
I mean, what's the alternative, interviewing potential ravers to see if
they're mature enough to handle it?  Is that any less arbitrary,
ultimately?  
Limits aren't intended to exclude people, they simply want to make sure
the highest possible level of communal safety is maintained.

Okay, discuss--  :)

peace,
Timothy

Thank you for agreeing on that at least.

We don't do *all* that we can.  That's why there are problems.  
That's why parents are in an uproar.  That's what this is about.

Because of the maturity that comes with a birthday that falls further
back.

How young?  What percentage at what age?  Yes, it's a blanket 
rule, a generalization, but one which is valid, that older people
are GENERALLY more mature than younger people.

I see NO conflict between looking out for our young folks, as a
COMMUNITY, and the concepts of PLUR.  No conflict whatsoever.

The solution is education AND limitations.

That is such a MYTH!  People, if you don't listen to anything else,
listen to this:  Kids don't get busted for it because it's legal,
and drinking is not frowned on like it is here, but that's about 
where it ends.  There is just as much alcoholism, just as many, if
not more, drunk-driving deaths, more problems with fetal-alcohol
syndrome, etc., etc., etc.  The attitudes in some other countries
towards alcohol are certainly different, but to say that 
legalizing a substance makes all the problems with that substance 
just vanish like a bad dream is LUDICROUS.

Please show me propoganda that says you'll die from one toke.
And whatever substance they say that *can* kill you at one toke,
please show me the evidence that it's a lie.  

> since obviously you can't

And you're well over 21, so why the hell did I bother to 
respond to all this since you OBVIOUSLY can't be trusted?
Kids!  Warning!  Don't trust this guy!  He's OVER 21!!!

> Listen to yourself.  This sort of sanctimonious bullshit is exactly why

If my kids come to hate me for taking care of them and looking
out for their best interests, so be it, but I highly doubt that's
what will happen.  On the other hand, if you're saying that you
hate your parents because of some perceived slight or your idea
of a bad childhood based on the limitations they put upon you,
then that is *your* problem to work through.

And it was a rant, alright.  God protect that child with a 
parent that doesn't do things for the child's sake.  You're
beloved and "trademarked" "No-Cost Moral Judgement" describes
EVERYTHING a parent does for a child.

Imagine that -- I suppose you once partook of many things, but
intervening years have seen you come to the conclusion that
you don't need the substances to have a good time, right?
If you had to give a name to your experience, what would it be?
Not that horrible word, Maturity?

You're absolutely right.  Excluding arbitrary age ranges is not 
the key to "How can we take responsibility for our actions?"  It
IS the key, along with decent parenting, to "How can we take care 
of the younger folx in our community and insure that they reach 
an age, safely, where they can make their OWN decisions, regarding 
medicating themselves with potentially dangerous substances, in a 
mature fashion?"

Hi all,

I'm currently seeking a partner for a South Bay business 
venture near Santa Clara University. Hopefully you love 
the music of our scene as much as I do and have had some
experience running/managing a juice bar/cafe? Also, I'm
open to discussing the capital and time investment on
your part.

For additional details please email me at: johnk@excite.com
Note that if my idea pans out, the target date for opening
is ASAP, so respond soon if you're interested?

Peace,

I dunno, I've done it many a night.  And afterward, I have always hoped (and 
often found) that the person  
1) will take a more responsible attitude towards whatever substance was used, 
and 2) will understand that people at these events do truly care, and that 
they should feel safe returning to the scene once the ordeal is over. 
 
I can see your point quite clearly, but any form of discrimination strikes me 
as wrong. Imagine if I was a bank, and gave different interest rates based on 
age, sex, race, religion...  Things like this irk me.   
 
We're trying to restrict access to what is illegal in our scene.  Now, as far 
as society *as a whole* is concerned, we, as adults, are no more responsible 
than those kids in regard to the illegal drugs.  You're not mature enought to 
handle these things, and neither am I.  Nobody on this list is mature enough 
to deal with drugs.  If we're ID-ing because we are restricting access to a 
substance that legally has an age limit, then fine.  Can somebody answer these 
questions for me?  At what age is it legal to take E?  At what age is it legal 
to take LSD?  When we have an age limit for the drugs that are "causing the 
problems for these youngsters", then I will support ID-ing at a rave. 
 
Regards,

I'll give you that.  There's no magic number to go by, no moment of
epiphany when someone is suddenly "all grown up", but you got to start
somewhere.

There's greater number that feel it does reduce substance abuse (not
alcoholism - those would be dependent/addictive personalities that would
become hooked regardless), but that they grossful elevate
substance-related crime.  When I've been in Europe I've discussed this
stuff at length with a variety of people.

Agreed.

No one person.  But promoters that decide to be responsible will limit
the ages of the attendees, the point being to discourage kids from
going.  Or they'll provide a staff to look out for everyone, but do you
have any idea how tough it would be to have a raver staff that had to
stay *sober* the entire night and hold some little kid's hand as they
puked their way through an evening gone bad?

> Are we going to kick the kids off of the SFRaves list?

Of course not -- no way to do it anyway -- but we can use the list to
promote education and attitudes towards responsible raving.

Another $.02...

I have to agree with KC here..it gets kinda old and tired when every
time i check my mail there are either flame wars or just a bunch of
bickering going on in this list.  So...i just have to start cutting
things out, which i don't wanna do because a lot of u have good points
and information.  But it just gets to be too much with all the
bickering...so i cut it all out.

Why can't we seem to talk about or go on about positive things on
here??  I know life isn't all positive and sometimes there are more than
1 side to an opinion, but GEEZ, i get enough of that in life.  I really
don't need it on here ALL the time.  TO debate is okay with me, but all
this bickering..finger pointing or whatever....just gets old.

I rarely post and i think part of that is due to the fact that the list
has gotten so hostile.  When i joined this list, 1.5 years ago, i posted
much more because i felt a certain sense of community amongst the list
and its subscribers-(either that or i was just really naive and
stoopid), either way, the list was much more fun back then.  I've seen
some really lovely people either un-sub or just vanish from the list
because of the negativity on here.  I want u guys BACK.

I have met a few of u on the list in person and seem to like most, if
not all, of u.  (well...with the exception of 1 or 2 ;) :) :P

My point is this: let's try to make this a more fun and enjoyable list
and leave all the BS to the outside world, where there's plenty of it.

OH YEAH AND HAVE A GREAT FUCKIN' WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!!

:)

	It's not legal to "possess" E at any age - but if you're an adult
and you are caught in possesion of E, the other adults around you can't be
held responsible for *your* actionns. If you are a minor and you are caught
in possesion of E, the adults around you can be held responsible. It's
called contributing to the deliquency of a minor. If you're an adult in
the scene and you don't think you have a personal stake in this, you're wrong.

A favor:

Even though drugs have a big influence on the rave scene, can you
please please please mark posts that are strictly about drugs as NRR
in the subject? Note that NRR = Not Rave Related. Putting NRR is the
subject line allows people (like me) who use filters not to have to read
about things that aren't interesting (ie. not relevant to raving).

Reading post after post comparing LSD and Ketamine and Ecstasy, various
interpretations about the origin of 420, what Ecstasy is being laced with
nowadays, and so on....

It's just too much. This is not a drug list... although, I assure you,
you should be able to find one with little difficulty. But since I
understand that the nature of SFRaves involves a large amount of
off-topic posting, remember:

Please, just use the NRR tag in the subject line. It's there for a
reason. :)

Put yourself in my shoes. I receive over 300 pieces of email everyday;
that's after filtering the hell out of it. :( Please be nice to those
of us with overflowing mailboxes. (I would say something about PLUR,
but I won't... >:)

Finally, I find it interesting to note that during the whole 20/20
hysteria, the SFRaves community passionately proclaimed how "Raving is
not all about drugs! How *dare* they insinuate that. Let's FAX bomb
then with protests." However, at the same time, the other thread on
SFRaves that was running concurrently was all about drugs... That
makes a very interesting statement about our community.

No it is not. What kinds of crime are you talking about?  Violent crime?
White-collar crime?  The punishments are different for each, thus looking
solely at the prison population is no clear indication of anything other
than who gets locked up the most, not necessarily who has/will committ more
crime.  Jump in logic there Adder.  And by far it is African-Americans &
people of color.

Unfortunatly, we are faced with a volume problem on SFR... namely, it
it is too high.  We can try to create systems that allow people to
sort their mail better, but there is only so much we can do.

I think educating people about drugs is a very important fuction of
SFR, espcially when the gov's just say no mentality has effectively
muted any real drug education.

Personally, I think the NRR tag should be reserved for chain letters,
funny jokes, and "I'm just writing to say how much I love you all"
messages.

Anything even remotely rave related should not have the NRR tag on it.

I suggest if you want to filter out drug info, you should add the
names of various drugs and their slang to your procmail file.
 
If you look at the archives of SFR, you will see there has been active
discussion about recreational drugs from the very beginning.

But, I fully understand your frustration about the volume on sfr.

Kewl--everybody is Kung Fu fighting  :)

Just my 2 cents re age/maturity re 15 y/o vs 25 y/o etc.

The 25 y/o may legally get drunk out of their mind, add to 
that a smattering of drugs--and they aren't more responsible 
than a sober 15 y/o

The view of most teenagers learning world history and 
current events is that the adults running the world and 
their lives are the irresponsible ones, petty, unable to see 
past their differences, and on power trips re their age and 
control over minors and politics

The psychological dysfunctions and illnesses induced in 
childhood (mostly from defective parents) often come to 
fruition in "maturity" and there are as many or more fucked 
up adults in this world as there are teenagers.

Actually the opposite might be true--people lose their 
sensitivity and awareness with age, drink, drugs, 
relationships, etc.

Why do adults take drugs but to re-experience the energy and 
lack of inhibitions of childhood;  or conversely--what use 
would a kid have for "mature people's drugs"--they are 
already high!

Respect for our youth--they don't fuck with the world 
anywhere as badly as adults mess it up!

I have his tapes and I am willing to distribute them to anyone who might be

Well, last time Hyperractive was here he played hard acid traxx and solid 
techno, like a lot of the stuff you hear on Missile Records.  The man can 
mix too.  He was freakin' it!  I'm looking forward to hearing him again.

Im writing an apology to everyone because I feel that I was the one who
added most of the fuel to the fire of this recent age thread. Why I let
myself get all worked up is beyond me. It just that I love all of you
truly and because of that I sometimes turn into this Mr. Mom and start
waving my finger at someone thinking I know whats best. Its my bad. 

Im sorry

And you can turn *this* back around and ask similar questions about the
original case of maturity and age, which I think was Adder's point:  What
kinds of maturity are you talking about?  Education?  Depth of personal
sensitivity?  Growth proceeds differently for each...

Details!  Like I've been saying.  What do we mean by maturity?  Why do we
find it correlated with age?  How strong is the correlation?  How is it
substantiated?  That's the way to get somewhere with this argument.

I know it's late, but is there anyway that anyone can fit me in? I live
in one of the dorms in Berkeley. It would be greatly appreciated and I
would help with gas, of course.

Andre and I were both glued to the DJ booth when Hyperactive was here last,
and I gotta tell you, this guy was the most inspirational mixer I saw in
all of '96. And the icing on the cake was he was playing his own dub
plates/shite labels most of the time. I *can not wait* to see him again --
he rocked.

 One thing I wanted to mention here in support of Steve's perspective 
while showing another;

 I just learned about a week ago that students who have email tend to 
have something (sysop? help me someone) that filters out a lot of junk 
mail and spammed mail. We students don't "see" what folks in the "real" 
world have to deal with daily (thank you).

 In my haste to post sometimes I forget to add NRR to such posts that 
deserve it. I would like to thank Steve for reminding us all. Courtesy is 
catching (except to those in isolation suits).

QUOTES ON THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE
Carl Zwanzig: "Duct tape is like the Force. It has a light side, a=20
dark side, and it holds the universe together...."
Douglas Adams: "There is a theory which states that if ever anybody=20
discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will=20
instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and=20
inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has=20
already happened."
Albert Einstein: "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human=20
stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."
Unknown: "Astronomers say the universe is finite, which is a=20
comforting thought for those people who can't remember where they=20
leave things."
Edward P. Tryon: "In answer to the question of why it happened, I=20
offer the modest proposal that our Universe is simply one of those=20
things which happen from time to time."
John Andrew Holmes: "It is well to remember that the entire universe,=20
with one trifling exception, is composed of others."
Max Frisch: "Technology is a way of organizing the universe so that=20
man doesn't have to experience it."
Kilgore Trout: "The universe is a big place, perhaps the biggest."
Woody Allen: "I'm astounded by people who want to 'know' the universe=20
when it's hard enough to find your way around Chinatown."
Douglas Adams: "In the beginning the Universe was created. This has=20
made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad=20
move."
William J. Broad: "The crux... is that the vast majority of the mass=20
of the universe seems to be missing."
Rich Cook: "Programming today is a race between software engineers=20
striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the=20
Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the=20
Universe is winning."
Fred Hoyle: "There is a coherent plan in the universe, though I don't=20
know what it's a plan for."
Ray Bradbury: "We are an impossibility in an impossible universe."
Christopher Morley: "My theology, briefly, is that the universe was=20
dictated but not signed."
Edward Chilton: "I'm worried that the universe will soon need=20
replacing. It's not holding a charge."
Calvin and Hobbes (Bill Watterson): "The surest sign that intelligent=20
life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to =3D=20
contact us."

anyone is passing by here to get there (it's in SF), please give me a call
or email me or something to let me know you can take me :)
I'll gladly pitch in for gas !
Thanks in advance...

PS- I can BART it anywhere, but I'd love a ride home afterwards :)

You understood me wrong. I meant that Proggressive House and Trance are
the most often played at all raves.
They do play all the other stuff too, but I mean the most comme hear are
those.
There is a huge Proggressive House audience.
I listen to other stuff also.

Indeed! Quite so! I've pencilled this one in on the calendar fer sure.
Derrick Carter and DJ Dan have pretty much defined some of the ultimate
DJ experiences I've enjoyed... (and of course I like Galen and Graeme too).

Does this mean there will be an organic in the park after-party?

Oddly enough, Black Adder has successfully made friends (gasp!), friends who
like and respect him.  Ya'd never know it, but he's a very nice, intelligent
caring person!  And all his friends know it. :)

	I was out at the Evoulution party last night.  It had a pretty decent vibe for a party 
that was over crowded, hot, sticky, and extreamly hard to move around at because they stuffed 
about 2000+ people into a location that can only "cofortly" acomidate 1000 people.  I left at 
about 2:30 am, so I can not tell you much more than that, but it looked to me like everybody was 
having a pretty good time.  Lots of smiles, Good music, great banners.

	The question I have is this:  Would this party be considered an 'UG' or a 'Massive'?

	And as long as I am asking, could someone explain to me where the origin of the term 
'massive' came from in defining large parties.  Is it a derivation of 'The Tribal Massive 
Gathering' from Europe??  Because if it is then it is being applied incorectly.   And what is it 
that seperates a massive from an UG party??  Is it the price, the lineup, the comfort/discomfort 
level, the location, the level of organization, or what??	Were these term coined here on 
SFRaves, because that is realy the only place I see them being used??

	I know that these questions must sound silly, but I am just trying to get a little better 
understanding of what public perception on this issue is.  It seems so ambiguose.  

	I personaly liked it whan they were all called RAVES it was a lot less derogatory and much 
less desceptive.  Some were smaller raves, others were bigger raves.

	I am not a big fan of labeling things, I believe that it inedvertantly implies bias, 
descrimination and prejudice.  Maybee it is time for us to recapture our heritage and revert 
back to calling things what they realy are??

	Anyways, Just a thought.


Keep it Real

AMEN!  BA can be a bit of a hardass, but he's a very logical one.  If
you can show him where he's wrong, he admits it, but you better be able

Hi Everyone.... I dunno :P I decided that maybe I should go to a party at
aroudn 7:30pm or so.. so I got ready, got my friend into it and got in the
car and drove to SF... I wasn't really in the mood to go because I had to
work (and I am) wat 6am Sat.


Anyhow, I did not like the location very much :( there is something about
the Mission that I don't like... I dunno, it was a weird vibe. It felt
more like a club ravther than a rave it was weird, I did see people I knew
so I said hi and stuff... The Music was good, but it was too housey. I
dunno, I like House but something more upbeat (after all, I was hella
tired so I needed something to keep me going not make me fall asleep). I
dunno... it was way crowded and smokey and hot (I hate it when they
overcrowd small places)so I was very uncomfortable and
cluastrophobic..short of breath too. I was having a panic attack :( I
couldn't stay there one more second, I needed to go outside and breathe... 

so I left around midnight :( or actually almost 1am or so...
and I guess I still haven't had a chance to hear DjDan. I hear so much
about him...even though I haven't heard ;)

Oh and I almost forgot.. the Secutiry people where hella rude :(

So there goes a half-review of Evolution :) 
I'll see you alls laterz
love
Pab

Hi everyone, I was looking/browsing through some news clippins of the
incident at Circa97 in LA and I was curious about the so called 'fx' that
was mentioned.  Does anyone know what Fx is? I remember that JondaBomb
posted something about Fx once a while ago on the list (I don't remember
whether it was a question or an answer ;oP)

So does anyone know what this stuff is?
What does it do?

If anyone has had any experience with it, I would love to hear their
storie. Its just for my personal knowledgebase thing you know?...It sounds
interesting. and I want to know what that stuff is :P


Love to all

>	The question I have is this:  Would this party be considered an 'UG' or a

I didn't go to this party, but I've only seen DJ Dan (whom I like) at
massives, as in parties that have more than 1000 people or so.  Not that
1000 is the definitive number (now if it were only 999, it would be an UG!
;), but overall it seems like size-wise, UG parties tend to have people in
the 100's, massives in the 1000's.  I think there's often issues of legality
too.  Massives, as they often charge a lot more, from what I've seen tend to
have purchased/acquired all the necessary things to make their parties
legal, insurance & all that crap.  UG's tend to be more renegade, just some
people trying to find some hidden place to play music for a few hundred
people, hence old warehouses & such.  The feel is very different, in my
experience.   I dont know where the term massive came from tho, but it seems
a fairly accurate term to me.

While I don't like labeling things either, I still feel that 'massive' is a
reasonably accurate term, and I think that both UG and massive are terms
that have been earned over the years, from people's experiences with both.
I know there is definitely a difference to me, and I do not consider
massives to be inherently evil, there are some things you will find at a
massive that you won't find at an UG.  The enormous energy of 2000-3000
people enjoying & dancing their asses off to seriously kick-ass music with
the entire space booming, in spite of all the magical experiences I've had
with small intimate parties, that is a feeling I've only gotten at massives,
both here and outside the U.S.  So yes there are differences, and while I
generally avoid massives, not all the differences are bad.  While it's
stupid to get too picky with terminology, I think it's silly to try to mash
vastly different experiences into one easy word.  "Rave" is just too broad a
term nowadays.

The drug FX contained some sort of stimulant that by itself is safe but can
be lethal when syergized with other drugs. I do not remember the name of
the drug in FX... but I believe it was a natural stimulant...

I would like to know more about FX too...

what kind of music do i spin?  well, stuff with a beat?  [just playin 
withya] you know, i've never been that great at classifying things, 
reagan.  if you're really curious, you might want to go to Ameba and 
listen to it.  Allen's a great guy (in fact i was just up there 
yesterday) and he is a TRUE supporter of the underground.  he'll let you 
listen.  

...oh, and, um.  free submarine with purchase.  but they're not there 
yet, (i haven't found the right class of submarine), so if you do get 
one, email me and with 'proof of purchase' (there will be a quiz, so you 
real smarty pants who think you're going to get around that, think 
again!) i will send you a sub.  okee?  =]

vlad:

good question.  in fact, great question.  i've been asked that kind of 
stuff about the kind of music i spin on a daily basis, and i'm always at 
a loss of words.  

you see, someone might go to a 2000+ RAVE and not have a good time, and 
then start calling those parties MASSIVES.  

In fact, the one Funky Tekno party I've been to, I talked to someone who 
was having a great time, and someone who was having an apparently shitty 
time.  (I apologize in advance if anyone is offended by the word "shit" 
no purchase necessary must be 18 to read this).  

but you see, it's all about perception.  we might get a lot of responses 
to this thread, and they are all perceived through the eyes of whoever is 
reading them or writing them.  

I'll tell you a little story:

Last night I was taking down some of those little string lights.  The 
person who was instructing me to take them down is verry good with 
lighting, in my book.  But I didn't know what the heck he was talking 
about about wrapping them up.  He's really good with that stuff.  But I'm 
not, and I don't really have a care in the world to set up lighting.  
I'll do it to help out and give my share, but it's not my forte.  
However, give me 2 turntables and a mixer... he he he.  you won't be able 
to PRY me away from those things.  

My old roommate when we would go to parties together would always go up 
to the dj table and immediately report back to me "tony's spinning" or 
"simon's up next".  I would be like, "who cares?"  This was before I got 
good at beatmatching.  Now I'm up there sometimes spinning my head with 
the platter trying to figure out what song is playing.  

Now, what does this all have to do with mASSIVES vs. rAVES?  Absolutely

Too crowded was my first though.  About 1,500 at Ceasar's Latin Palace.  All
highschool, gangastas.  A lot of bad vibes.  But a lot of friendly people as
well.

Icey wasn't as good as I had hoped.  He played a lot of his stuff, of course.

Paul Johnson played like it was a fucking club in Tijuana!!  A lot of housey
music, a lot of slow, melodic house.  He even played "These Sounds Fall Into
My Mind" or whatever that mainstream club song is.

Dan was good!!!  He plays a lot of hard shit now.  He had the levels cranked
way up though and sometimes it hurt to listen to the music.

Overall it was a good party since I didn't pay, he he.  But it was so packed
that it was hard to dance.  Even at 4 in the morning.

They even had to carry one guy out because he o.d.ed

  I think this comes from Hoffman, who argued that younger people =

at risk of a lasting detrimental (Sp) effect from doing acid.

  Since Disney holds the position as the most hated person on this list,

I think anyone who intends to throw a party, or is interested in some
authorities point of view would do well to read Lotus (v.1 iss.7).  There;s
a really good interview with the LA Fire Dept in there, that really spells
out a lot of stuff.  Safety, Legal, Permitting, type issues, and what happened
on NYE in LA.  There's also coverage of the whole NYE scene, busts, etc.. with
a lot of details.

Good stuff.  Thanks to the people at Lotus!

hugs,
Bruce

Would you guys stop it?! I'm getting all teary-eyed. Gee, first I fail at

Has anyone tried "2CB" before? I noticed there have more people selling it
lately, and I am suppose to try it sometime pretty soon with some friends.
Anyone know anything about it? side effects, etc? It is some kind of powder,
and you snort it usually. The effects are somewhere between ecstacy and
acid. Thats all I really know about it.Thanks.

 to Jan 96 as I can get. The DJ's were:
 
 Carlos
 Dutch
 Tony
 Solar
 Jeno

 Hope that helped some.

      the first thing that comes to my mind in regards to evolution is that
it was way too packed. cesar's is too small a place to pack that many bodies.
it was stuffy and there was no air circulating. the security staff was also
hella rude. i saw one of the punk ass security guards out front giving johnny
fiasco and kimo a hard time about coming into the party. from now on,
promoters should get potential security guards tested for steroid abuse. 
     although the party was packed, the music was incredible. jeno delivered
a wicked house set. i don't think i've ever heard him spin a bad set. i'm
always amazed at how consistent he is. 
     icey is a different story. i was expecting him to be some sort of
breakbeat god. the kids in orlando are right, he is a better producer than he
is a dj. i sat down for his entire set, because it was totally undanceable.
     paul johnson was amazing. i've heard a lot of his records and i was
amazed at how good he was. he played a lot of my favorite old school house
tracks. some people might complain that his set was too housey. but, i
disagree. the vibe of the party needed to be brought back up after icey's
disappointing set and he did it. anyone that opens their set off with "jack's
house" has my stamp of approval!!!!
     dj dan's set was good, but it was a little too hard for my tastes (sorry
sarvi, don't hurt me for complaining about your man). after grooving to some
phat house beats from paul johnson i needed to hear something funky. i've
heard dan spin some funky ass disco house before and it was the bomb. i had
hoped that he would opt to spin that instead of his harder stuff.
     johnny fiasco was johnny fiasco. for those of you who have heard his
records, you know that this man is the BOMB!!! i saw him once out here in san
jose during the summer and was amazed by his style. i wasn't disappointed
this time around either. he spun some funky ass chicago style house. i only
wish that i had been able to stay at the party longer to hear the rest of his
set. 
     overall the party was good. i went for the music and i wasn't too
disappointed. i hope to see some of you at splish on friday and at organic on
saturday.

PLUR,

dorena

That party was at Clue Arte (435 Broadway, in SF) and it got busted by the
SFPD 8 minutes into Solar's closing set.

Galen opened, Solar closed (kinda).

I will be there as well.  Can't wait.  All I know is that I have a feeling
it is going to be PACKED!  I saw everyone from Evolution with Love Affair
flyers in their hands, so the promo boyz have been flyering away.  

Hopefully the good thing is the DJ's that will be playing.  I also got a
presale for $17 so that makes me happy as well.

I'd love to meet some others if anybody else is going.

FNF was just what the doctor ordered today.  That was the first outdoor event 
I've been to since Burning Man, and it rocked!  Took along some steaming hot 
chai to ward off the chill.  A great crowd, very mixed, as can be expected at 
such an event.  The motorcycle ride home was a little cold, but overall this 
was the best Sunday in awhile!  Thanks FNF!

Tomorrow (probably today for most of you) there is a protest in support of
the Dineh (navaho) resistors. In a nutshell they are indigenous people
that are getting kicked off (relocated is the nice way to say it) their
land. It is important to make a showing today since the court decision
regarding this case is being made this week. If they lose they may be
forcefully relocated beginning april 1st.

show your support:

vigil begins at 8:00 am

Anybody heard a very strange song on the radio (heard it on Live 105) called
Ain't Goin to Goa?  Very weird song!  And a little out of context for a
mainstream radio station, very strange.

I'm interested in finding out in what "region" this CF production is
being held (South-Bay, North-Bay, East-bay, Santa Cruz, Monterey Bay,
and etc.).  Any information will be greatly appreciated as we are
trying to determine what event we're going to attend on the 15th.  I
REALLY want to go to TLC as I've had lot's of fun with CF and their
crowd but, others in my group want to go to "the other" event on that
evening... what it comes do to is the location!  I know that that bites
but, we've all got to make compromises somewhere.

Thanks in advance....
Hope to be giving out pixie-stix at TLC,

-SoNiC

OKAY, SF-Ravers,

	Who's doing what on Saturday?  Is it going to be "Love Affair" or
"Techno Love Children"?  What's your take on this sticky situation
where there's going to be two (possibly PHENOMINAL) raves happening at
the same time?

pLOVEur,

I couldn't resist posting this full message for those who don't have access=
 to the www. For those who do, check out this site. It has an incredible=
 amount of current information on a lot of the substances we all use and=
 abuse (and it has an awesome look to it as well):

MDMA : Staying Healthy                             MDMA - How to X properly


Seems like allot of sick ravers lately so here's some advice on tripping,=
 Xing and staying healthy gleaned from my 15 odd years of experience. No=
 these aren't cast in concrete, yes you don't have to follow them exactly,=
 but at 35 I'm still in good shape, hardly ever get sick and can still party=
 all night. Something to think about. :)


   1.Frequency and dose - It really takes about a week for you to completely=
 return to baseline after X or L. This means if you are doing it more often=
 than that your body is being stressed, which lowers your immune system.=
 Also, the higher the dose, the harder it is on your body. While X is easier=
 mentally than L, it is much harder on the body. Doing just enough to get=
 off will not only keep you healthy, it saves money too. :)=20


   2.Food - Both X and L suppress your appetite while increasing your level=
 of activity. (X is worse because the suppression lasts longer than the=
 trip.) This means that you are burning up your body's reserve energy when=
 you are dancing and not eating. When the body's reserves are gone, you then=
 begin burning muscle tissue, this is bad. Of course, all of this adds to=
 your physical stress levels and lowers your immune system. The bottom line=
 is that you must force yourself to eat correctly before, during and after X=
 or L. This is complicated by the fact that both X and L slow down the=
 movement of your bowels, making it harder to digest food. Before a trip -=
 eat fruits, vegetables and starches, avoid oils and heavy proteins, don't=
 eat anything heavier than fruit an hour before dropping, especially if you=
 are prone to nausea. During the trip - drink juice, eat simple starches=
 (bread, crackers) and nibble fruit (eating food is much easier on X than=
 L), set a schedule for eating and stick to it (remember, you won't feel=
 hungry) avoid candy, pop and anything with alcohol or caffeine. (These may=
 seem nice, but they do bad things to your blood sugar and hydration.) After=
 the trip - eat fruits, vegetables and starches, avoid oils and heavy=
 proteins, eat several small meals rather than trying to eat a few large=
 ones, remember you won't *feel* hungry but your body needs the food. Take a=
 good look at yourself, are you just skin and bone? If you are, up your=
 calories from starches and good fats (esp. olive/canola and fish). Your=
 body needs a slight layer of fat to stay healthy, men and women.=20


   3.Vitamins and herbs - Vitamins are NOT a replacement for eating right!=
 However, when you stress your body vitamins can help keep any negative=
 impact to a minimum. X in particular (especially when raving and drinking=
 lots of water) removes water soluble vitamins from the body. Also, certain=
 vitamins are used up a higher rates when you're under stress or over=
 exerting.


 Here are some of my favorites:

A good multivitamin multimineral for the day after. (break it up to help=
 digestion)

2-3 grams of DLPA (DL-Phenylalanine) if I feel "bummed out" the day after.

Melatonin 9-21 mg when I'm ready (and able) to sleep.

60 mg CoEnzyme Q 10 (oxygenates the heart), .5 - 1 gm inositol and 3.5 gm l-=
 orthine alpha ketoglutarate (keeps the cells in aerobic respiration), 2 gm=
 time release pantothenic acid (maintains endurance and fights stress) I=
 take these 1 or 2 hours before dropping.=20

Vitamin C 1-4 grams as needed 3-4 times a day. Every time they study vitamin=
 C they find it does more good stuff for ya. Pluses are: time release,=
 neutralized with calcium, mixed with bioflaviniods.=20

Herbs - This is a complex area with many conflicting opinions. Some that I=
 find useful:=20

Reshie mushrooms - Proven to boost the immune system shitake and miatake=
 mushrooms - contain "adaptogens" which help cope with stress=20

Ginseng - more adaptogens.=20

Ginko - increases blood flow in the brain=20


   4.Respecting yourself between trips - learn to meditate and then practice=
 it regularly. Take care of yourself, get some exercise, get some sunshine,=
 get out in nature. Don't have your whole life revolve around just tripping=
 and raving. Pay close attention to yourself and the world around you.=
 Realize that what you see in life really depends on what you are looking=
 for. Without any reason, do something good for yourself, a friend, a=
 stranger and some one you don't like. (try to keep it simple and personal=
 :) )=20


Physically touch and be touched by people.


Smile a lot, laugh out loud.


I take no credit for writing this and I have never done any drugs (one or=
 more true statements).

Hey everybody!
  (Yes, I changed my name... ;)
Sorry to bug you all with so many posts about finding a ride to
Evolution--it sucked.  Well, maybe that's a little harsh.  In any case, I
didn't like it.  Not really a "rave" at all, as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe
that's why I didn't like it--too sellout clubby.  I tried to have a good
time, but you gotta look pretty hard for fun when you spend an hour in line,
$20 to get in, get searched, and then it was so crowded that there wasn't
even enough room on the dance floor to bend your knees--let alone sit down
in a corner and have a little smoke...assuming you were able to sneak it in
past the frisk at the door in the first place.
  Not really what I expected of the music either.  A lot of bass, beats, and
some scattered vocals.  The mixing of course was fabulous.  But there was no
music--no melody, no harmony, no instruments other than different sounding
drums and such.  Dunno... not for me anyway. ;)
Peace & Love

 hmmm, don't think I agree with this statement. I usually find that 
stimulants of ANY variety (this includes caffeine) tend to induce at 
least one quick bowel movement (eewwl!). It seem to me that stimulants 
make the bowels work faster, rather slower, making absorbtion of 
nutrients incomplete (nutrients tend not to be completly absorbed anyway 
but this situation makes it worse).
 In addition, I tend to get a bit of dhiarea (sp?) (double eewl!) so I 
think some water may be lost this way also.
 Any coments anyone?

 I found the rest of the info pretty good or unfamiliar to me.

 Attention all Pepsi Max kids, snow boarding suffragettes and high fibre 
 low-cal health freaks. Think you know the score? Think you're in control 
 of your lives? Think you're cool?

VENT'S got something to say about that and it goes something like this

 If your greatest fear is not where you next meal is coming from but when 
 you should trade in your old pair of air-cushioned wind resistant all 
 singing, dancing, thinking American-dream trainers, then vent's here to 
 tell you - you've sold out. 

 You can lead that cosy little life if you believe. Believe in the gods 
 of merchandise, instant gratification, dentally enhanced politicians. 
 The dream. It'll only cost you 9.99 at your local store. Stay tuned for 
 more.

 Your mind is theirs. They'll look after your nuerons now. A little tweak 
 here, a little tweak there. You won't feel a thing, except what they 
 want you to feel.

 What's it like to be a body without a cause? Don't think, don't talk, 
 don't even move until they tell you to. It doesn't matter who the 
 president is, where the war is, what the day is, it's not important. If 
 they don't say it, show it, sell it, you don't need to know it. 

 The world's too big for you. Let them make it smaller, safer. Hold their 
 hand now, prozac pedestrians, you don't want to lose your way to the 
 other pedastal sitters, street corner prophets, holier-than-thou 
 hipsters, purer than snow surfers and tunnel visioniaries. Don't lose 
 your way. They're vying for your loyalties, your pin numbers, your life 
 decisions. Stay loyal, stay cool, stay dumb, deaf and blind. They'll 
 make the decisions for you.

 Buy into their marketing empires, social conditioning, political 
 opppression, economic succession. Forget reality, forget the individual, 
 forget the rain forests, refugees, prisoners of conscience, child 
 soldiers, ethnic cleansing, freedom of expression. Plug into the 
 genetically-improved soya bean dream, know what I mean? 

 It's your life. Right?

	Good morning you bleary eyed boys and girls.....

Well, here we sit, thinking back on the 48 past.  Some have fond (or
not-so fond) memories of Friday (Evoultion), Saturday (House parties,
House Nation or Lightseed) or/and Sunday (Friends).   In all aspects, it
shoulda been a bitchin' weekend...

It was.  

Friday:  _Evoultion_
Standing in line @ 11:30, listenin' to the deep bass resonate thru the
walls.  I honestly don't remember standing in a line since FTT's
Haloween thang (And many events have gone off between the two).  The
line is a mixed crowd, hoodies, and scensters, Klub kidz and candy
ravers,  mac daddys 'n' mac mommies...  I get in (flying solo, as usual)
and I make my way to the front.  Stuffy. crowded.  Little space to
gruuve out.  Very housey vibe.  I get into the the music and start
mooving.  Nice lasers scanning an image of two skeltions dancing on the
wall.  I run into a few non SFR ravers who are suprised to see me.  We
chat in the middle of the dance floor (the floor is soo crowded that not
many people are dancing anyways...) about the busted party in SJ and
hope that someday, SJ's house scene will grow to this standard...  I
break from conversation and wander around...  Jump into a breakdancer
circle and gruuve out for a few hrs.  Nice.  
Still very very crowded @ 4 and Im tired.  Tired? At 4AM?  Somethings
wrong.. I head home and take a nap.

Saturday:  Running around The City , Mr Pager goes off @ 4pm.  It's
DeepFog reminding me of a lil intimate house thingy going on in Berk.
By 8 PM, A wee-bit 420'ed Anakin shows up, helps set up, and opens the
event(round' 9ish). Spinning hardtrance and melodic trance for A few
Hrs. I also gained the privlige of meeting a few other SFRavers ( Hiya
Spencer, Pengo, Macgaines).  Afta my set Macgaines jumpes, on and my
friends and I are gruuving to so nicley laid progressive house only hung
around for a bit longer cos Im supposed to 'hook' with some more friends
@ lightseed...

And _Lightseed_ was the bomb.  Not too crowded (due to lack of
promoting, my guess).  But nice vibe.  I stayed upstairs dancin' to the
serious Drum and Bass blaring from the speaker, allthough the tunes were
on, I could FEEL the energy down below...
So downstairs I venture, Entranced to the front speakers Ethan is
spinning some grande ol SF Trance.  I dance away into the void, but
something keeps pulling me back to this reality...  Hmm. Somethings
defenitaly awry.  Afta dancing with a bunch of peoples to whom I know
and know not, I break away and head back upstairs, running into another
SFR'er Mr Rob Rayle (hey Rob!).  Big howdys to Dhren, Wonka and s few
others on the promoter side...
I spin out in a chill room and catch a few zzz's, prepairing myself
for....

Sunday: @ FnF.  I get there at about 2 Pm. The only sleep I had was 2hrs
@ light seed.  And allthough my body is funked a bit im still ready to
dance...
I hop to one of the front speakers and proceed to become an enviormental
hazard to the grass below me.  In about 2 hrs im dancing on a mond of
dirt (Sorry grass!) and havin' an absoultly i'll time.. Thanks for that
Sesame Street Disco 70's tune (And I though only I had that record...).
I saw many of you ( too many to list) but then again I feel the base of
FNF is the SFR family...
I stopp dancing @ about 4:30ish and finally realize what is the matter.
	Im sick.
		Really really sick...
The mind and spirit were up, but now I noticed that I've been wheezing
and coughing quite badly.  I sit in my car and try to focus on how I'm
to get home.  20Mins and a disoreantated Adam later, Im @ a friends
house chilling (well, shivering, actually) for a few more hrs. Home.
Bed. Sleep.

Oh well...

A family doctor says I have a worsening broncial infection and gotsa go
to the RX peoples today.  (goodie goodie  =P)  So, sorry to all of
thoese I was supposed to "hook" with yesterday.  I promise we will meet
again in the future.
And now I'll be spending this week (and next weekend most likley too).
With my good friends Peter penicillin, Cody codene, and Chelsa Chicken
soup.  
(At least I have my 1200's,  Gemini and Acoustic Research's to keep me
company) 

So i guess, dear raver, you need to keep me informed on nec\xt weeks
parties...

Keep the vibe alive.

I've always thought 420 was the code number of the California Penal Code
that referred to smoking pot. That's what I post it for.

Being the week before Valentine's Day, I'd like to suggest we reflect on 
matters of the heart.  I'll start things out with a question for the 
poets within us all.  In as few words as possible, what does "being in 
love" mean to you?

:-)

peace

Two?  Don't forget Organic, and then there's that deal at the Fillmore.
Not to mention the Diatribe show, where I'll probably start my night
(anyone else?).

f'n great party!

Thanks to all of you who threw it and spun and set up and made tea!

Looked like it was going to rain, and besides a couple of scary 
sprinkles, it did not.

Outdoor parties are the best.  Dogs, children, just makes you want to
do cartwheels.

My only complaint was that gross outhouse--but I started bush'n it.

Music was great!

Thanks Ethan for playing Smack 3000 (Herwig Maurer)!  I was the girl
flipping out when you played that record (you probably thought I was
nuts.)  Now in L.A., Herwig and I lived together in Boston and had
adjacent recording studios, I miss him terribly!  I can't get him outta
my head, and now outta my ears.  It's hard when you put out records, you
really don't know if they are getting played or not.  He'll be glad to
know!

Peace,

Santa Cruz kids-
We still have a limited number of tickets here at the NUB Circus. 
Remember, this event is presale only and there are not that many
tickets.  Call 458-2071 before you come by.  We are located downtown at
755 Cedar St.  Also, check Capricorn Music on River St. because I
believe they have some tickets too.

WOW, 	good question.

Here are some of the things that love means to me:

Love is the unconditional giving and sharing of something that is intamate and personal to you, 
without the consideration of wather or not it will come back to you.

Love is believing in yourself and in your indevors.  

Love is viruous in itself.  It is its own reward. 

Love is a healing emotion.

Love is a circle.  No mater what it is you do, If you put it outthere it will come back to you.

True love is unconditional.

Love is the feeling released through the enrgy on the dancefloor.

Love is the spirituality at a rave.

Love is a the desire to share it.

Love breaks down bariers, removes anamosity, and destroys prejudice.

Love is everything - all at ounce.

Love gives purpose.

Love is the meaning of life.


Thanks for asking such a beautiful and wonderful question.
I hope everybody has a chance to respond to this thread and share their LOVE.
Happy Valentines.

Keep it real.

Simply the Best.

Got there around 3:30, after meditating and having a nice lunch at the KDK
Dharma Center celebrating Tibetan New Year.  Cool breaks were happening
which I love so I was dancing.....which was really nice because it had been
quite a while.  Who ever was spinning played "Bomb Scare" by Two Bad Mice,
ancient but classic tune and people were into it.....at least I was.  Spent
much time socializing with bay area friends I rarely get to see these days
and it felt really good.  Socialized through much of Joe's set, sorry bro.
Spent alot of Ethan's set talking as well, but really good tracks kept
breaking my train of thought and calling me to the dance floor.  Had some
Nub Chai thanks to Tony R., then started dancing.  Ethan was totally on.
Supurb mixes, with several of them leaving me wondering when the song
changed...cuz I didn't hear it.  Ethan's last two song were incredibly
beautiful tracks...they just need to be heard.  Feelings similar to "Rez" or
"Belfast."  Then Rich (happy b-day) came on.  He let Ethan's last song play
out before starting his set.  I had never heard him spin before and didn't
know what he was going to do....but I was standing there saying under my
breath..."let it be jungle" "let it be jungle."   Then I turned to my friend
Dave and said..."please let it be jungle."   And he said "oh yea, it'll be
jungle." .....I replied "now Dave, don't fuck with me cuz I really wanna
hear some d&b, to which he replied he was serious.  Soon after, the crazy
beats dropped and over the next hour or so Rich proceeded to spill my brains
all over the freshly trampled Pt. Molate grass.  Thanks Rich, and thank you
Friends and Family for a quite memorable Sunday.

Oh, yea...Dave gave me a flyer for the next Gateway party on March 1 called
"Shine", looked at it and it said Consciousness Lab was playing.........I
looked up at Dave and said...."uh, am I supposed to be playing here?"  He
gave me an "I don't know, I just got the flyers myself."  But it was all
good, I'll be there.  I guess Rich, who is also on the flyer said the same
thing when he saw it....as well as Joe Rice.....but hey, we're all friends,
and all of us were into it.  So maybe we'll see ya there.

Rick

Hey everybody. I have to get rid of a good sampling mixer, a Numark DM-1425.

specs are online at http://www.numark.com/2DM1425.html

I'm asking $320. If you're interested, give me a call at (415) 497-1318.

Indeed! Quite so! I've pencilled this one in on the calendar fer sure.
Derrick Carter and DJ Dan have pretty much defined some of the ultimate
DJ experiences I've enjoyed... (and of course I like Galen and Graeme too).

Does this mean there will be an organic in the park after-party?

Hello this is my first posting, I have been on SF raves for a couple of
months and enjoy all the postings. (PLUR to Shannonr for introducing me to
the rave scene and this group) I noticed several different help notices and
well I thought I might be able to offer a little help in one area. My
ex-boyfriend is a Conceptual Design major at SF State and a Graphic Designer.
I told him of some of the WEB msgs here and he is willing to offer a hand in:
Designing a WEB page, design covers or art work (he won 3rd place in computer
design at the Sate Fair). He has a CD burner and video equipment all linked
to his computer system and is very very knowledgable. If you have specific
questions or needs you can contact him at norris@wenet.net He gave me some
prices or trade (music and stuff) he would be willing to do, but I forgot the
specifics. Sorry. 
If he can be of help to anyone go ahead and contact him, I told him about
SFRAVES and he wants me to take him to one next time I go, I only went to my
first on in December and had a blast. Hope this does some good, and thanks
for letting me post this...

Hey, Veronica, where were you?  I think I might of seen you, but I have no
idea what you look like, color hair etc.  You had to have seen me, I was
the one with the black beanie hat chasin' the little one all around the
park.  He was wearing a green beanie hat and Toy Story apparel.  You had to
have seen us, Andrew just about stepped on everyone and was dancing around
too.  He got so hard to keep up with cuz he would weave in and out of
everyone.  He was so full of energy, we stayed till the end and then we
took down our tent.  Right when we got in the car, he crashed with Oreo
cookie all over his face, he was even snoring.  We went to eat at Nations
(bad experience for some there!) and I took Andrew inside and put two
chairs together for him to lay on, and he did not WAKE UP!! He was sooo
passed out.  Poor guy, he raved his little heart out!

Thanks to everyone at FnF for making this event an enjoyable/memorable one
for Andrew as well as myself. I'm glad I got to meet Ethan and Jennie, and
of course their children, Andrew and Shannon. They are wonderful, and so
are all of you. Both of us send hugs and kisses to all. elina & Andrew

reality.  Thank you for your time.

Now see, when ever I see "forward this to everyone you know" shit, it always

had a great time!! My buddy Tony kept lagging so we didn't get out there till
about 7... Just in time to hear Ethan... Sounds like you had a great set
Ethan!! =)
Now an amazing thing happened to me at this party... Moshe and i talked about
the jungle Rich was spinning and I said to him," I can't really get into this
hardcore stuff" Moshe was grooving hardcore... Then about 5 minutes later, I
was talking to some friends and my body started to move.. Then i kinda made
my way to the speaker, and for some Unknown reason except to the Techno
Gods... I LOST IT!!! I can't even dance to house music! I had a blast! That
jungle just made me get down like I never had in my entire life!!! Thank you
Rich, Thank you Ethan, Thank's to all my friends and family!! I'm a little
sore right now, but it was well worth it!!! I was the guy with the backwards
baseball cap and black jacket with a grey and white stripe across the
breast....
Peace,
Jonathan

Would that it were a joke...  Im not sure that the actual law-suit has
been filed (petition?  whatever) but it is definatelyy something that the
Local phone companies have been griping about for years.  I would imagine
that Capitol Hill would be where this was fought out... But I dont know
for sure.  Expect it to happen and be either :

1) Too expensive to enforce (you cant know Im using a modem unles you
tap my call...)
2) Too difficult to charge (by the minute?  the packet?  Each has a
workaround)
3) Too aggregious to the consumers (especially with the LDs getting into
the local phone biz... now there is competition)
4) Irrelevant (ISDN lines, cable modems, wireless transmission... people
will use whatever is cheapest).
5) Irrelevant part 2 : I *still* believe that it will soon no longer be
'cool' to use the net for absolutely nothing and people will leave in
droves.  Modem calls will no longer last forever (little Billy will get
his E-Mail and sign off) and so no-one will care anymore.

In other words, complain but dont get too scared.  This is utterly
winable.

- David

who is happy today.  :-)

I don't remember.  Being heartbroken. *sniff*
--Come on, all at once, "AWWW, poor Lisa"--

Having a true friend that you can say ANYTHING to.

Love at first listen.

Being apart, feelings don't fade. 

Being able to work creatively together.

Loving every aspect of a person.

Having no expectations.

Peace,
--Goldilox

My personal belief is that e-mail is not the main load-causer on the
regional telephone offices, but rather web usage. And quite frankly,
it's not the people that are putting up personal-interest sites such as
the various rave pages we see here, or some page telling you more than
you ever wanted to know about some Roland beat box. It's the commercial
usage, and the advertising.

I believe there should be a tax for internet usage to reimburse the
extra costs incurred at the RBOC's and backbone sites. This tax should
come from the ADVERTISERS and not the USERS of the  internet. A hell of
a lot of bandwidth on the internet is used up for commercial purposes,
not for personal purposes. Yet the advertizers are not paying their
fair share for clogging up the internet with lots of graphics for
products they're selling. Now they want US to pay more $$$ to look at
their advertising!

I therefore think there should be a special internet-sales tax for all
companies who get revenue for doing commercial activity (e.g. 
selling/advertizing/customer-support, etc) over the internet. They
should pay their fair share for turning a once relatively fast two-lane
highway (the internet circa 1993) into an online version of El Camino
Real (the internet circa 1997, lots of storefronts, lots of
traffic-lights, and lots of traffic). The costs of this should be more
distributed so that those that use lots of bandwidth (for graphics
intensive advertising) should pay their fair share to maintain the
roadway.

I have a feeling that employees of Organic Corp. might disagree w/ me
on this :-).

   Love is something you can feel for any person at any time.  Since there
are different types of love, you could love everyone from your parents to
your significant other, to some guy who picked your wallet up for you when
you dropped it.  I won't go into detail, but loving someone takes a lot less
energy than hating someone.  Hate just isn't worth your time.  Hugs and
kisses are.  Especially for me since my birthday is two days before
Vallentine's Day.  I'm a love child.

     hugs and non-profound thoughts, 
      'trice                                                   <<<<RAVEON>>>>

      I came across a web site that sells glow apparel.  My favorite item on
the list was glow sticks for 6 gauge piercings.  Now I can put a glow stick
through my tounge at parties!!  Check it out!!

	Not at all. I'm not sure what it is, but it has prominent vocals
	and it's about 3:30. I think it has guitars too.

        Love is not having to talk. And not having to make sense if
        you do. Love is being able to give the *only* right answer
	to "how was that for you?" and mean it.

-  Love is when your S.O. gives you the high sign, subtley so no one
notices, that you've got something hanging from your nose and keeps a
poker face about it so you won't die of embarrassment.

-  Love is handling your S.O.'s underwear while doing the laundry.

-  Love is changing your baby's diapers, especially the ones filled with
a cross between toxic waste and velcro.

-  Love is kissing your S.O. full on the lips right after waking up and
not minding the morning breath.

-  Love is seeing your S.O.'s new haircut and saying it's nice even when
it looks like the stylist cut it with live, crazed ferrets.

-  Love letting your S.O. put their cold feet on you at night.

-  Love is giving your S.O. a few minutes to cool off after a bad day,
then giving them a big hug before asking them to take out the trash.

-  Love is rubbing your S.O.'s feet while watching TV without being
asked.

-  Love is cooking up brussel sprouts just because your S.O. likes it,
even if the smell makes your skin crawl.

-  Love is listening to your S.O. tell about his/her job as though it's
really interesting, even if you only understand every other word they're
talking about.

-  Love is realizing that that other person's mind is priceless.

-  Love is admiring and cherishing someone for how they make you feel.

-  Love is seeing that other person walk into the room and suddenly
feeling like everything is now ok.

I didn't like him.  Too slow.  There was one shinning light in his set,
though, the song that said "Baddest mutherfucker on two turntables" I think
is what it said.  I think he may have doubled up on this one, I'm not sure.
If this sounds right, does anybody know what the record is called?

If anyone is interested in going to The Deep tomorrow night, or if you 
live in Santa Cruz already and would like a ride back, email me privately 
or call the Aware Environments Service Center at 415-595-3427.  I am 
planning on leaving from the mid-Penninsula at around 4pm and can stop 
anywhere in the South Bay area.  

Thank you and peace out 97!

This track is by a group (like eight members) called Alabama 3 and is 
definately not goa; it makes fun of the psytrance movement from what I
understand. But it is some form of dance music.

Yea,  and also don't forget thatsome cable companies are now offering
a TCP/IP connection to the INternet at 10Megabits download,  and 768kbits
Upload speeds at $50/month.   This is just now being offered in MY area
and as soon as I can get my place,   I'm signing up.    Heck,   get the
box,   hook it up and connect the BNC to my TCP/IP card and I'm on
24hrs/day at 10 times the T1 speeds.....

Love is when you're hugging another person tighly and you feel your heart
beating so strong, and they're heart is beating so strong and pretty soon
you can't tell whos heart you're actually feeling.

My ideal form of love from anyone is for them to look past physical
appearance.

To not jump to conclusions when they speak. Give them the benefit of the
doubt. just because someone has stabbed you in the back before doesn't
mean that everyone else you meet is capable of the same thing.

Instead of firing back with a negative statement you respond with
positive energy. (Difficult to do especially in today's culture) Example
today I was at the SC post office and this couple was waiting in line.
They were talking and did not notice that there was an opening. Before
the couple had time to scratch their asses a gentlemen(HAHAHA) behind me
said HELLO!!!! real mean. I turned around and gave (parden my language)
this fat ass in a business suit the evil eye. He was not looking at me
but I wish he would have. I am trying so hard to not think negative
thoughts but when I am surrounded by ignorant, negative, miserable
people I feel that I have to stand up to the bullshit. I feel that I am
a very positive person who has alot to offer. Why is it that I cannot
shut this negative kharma out? In today's culture people recognize your
positive energy and try to take it away. I know that people can only
take something away if you let them but it is sooooo hard to remain
positive. PLUR  

My ideal form of love does not involve another person. I have found that
true love can only be found within one's self. I hope someday I will
find someone to share this trip we are on but until then I must love
myself.

hey all, i bring love from Texas...

...i'm unfamiliar with your list 'etiquette', so if i'm stepping on your 
toes, just write me off as a stupid cowboy, or something :)

there's a happening in Austin on feb 15th called Flowerchild, by Small 
World and Tribal Entertainment, featuring:
Ghost...SF's funkiest acid breaks tech
Frank Nitty...burning up the dope beats
Tracy...SF's female phenom
Dutch...Hard Trance to make you dance
and some locals...

the big question is: What are these people like?(interpret in any way you 
want to...)

the little question is: Will this be worth $21? (in TX most are $10-$15)

cheers, thanks a lot

I'm looking for the disk "Arecibo" by Brian Lustmord on Soleil Moon records.
Apparently the label is sold out, and I need it asap for a project at work, so
I'm hoping to borrow it from someone locally for a day or two at the most if
possible.

Thanks a whole lot for any leads you can drum up.

Good Evening my friends and friendesses...

I made this really cool decal and had it printed at Kinko's, but now my 
dry cleaner place doesn't want to paste it on my t-shirt, because it's a 
"steam thing" or whatever.  =[[[[[[[ this got my 7 chins in a little 
tiffy.  

Could someone direct me to a place that specializes in this kind of stuff 
nstuff?  (hi jeff!)  

thanx sooooo much, 1000 hugs to you all...deep

culture.... PLUR........


				Thanks Again!!

Lately I've been noticing that the SF rave scene is gaining a lot of non
ravers who don't understand what raving is all about. They don't understand
what PLUR means. We need to help these people understand what we're all
about. If u see someone who looks like theyre having a bad time, ask them to
dance, or do something to make them laugh, or give them a lollipop and talk
to them for a while. These new ravers need to know what we're all about. SHow
them a little love and help introduce them in a friendly way. Do the same
with the unsocials too. Just whatever you do, don't offend them. We have to
keep the PLUR vibe alive. Don't let the scene turn into an unsocial gangster
party. Remember... spread the vibe, keep raves alive.

Hehe, apparently, Cablemodems aren't very secure.  My friend has done some
testing on cablemodems in the Philadelphia area and he has done some
testing and he has written his report about it.  If you want a copy of the
report point your www browsers to:

http://sciri.blacklisted.com

I will provide everyone with my own findings and hopefully a fix for the
problem once cablemodems become available in my area.

Happy and safe netsurfing!  

Much love,
Anthony E

This track is by a group (like eight members) called Alabama 3 and is 
definately not goa; it makes fun of the psytrance movement from what I 
understand. But it is some form of dance music.

I just have to say that this weekend kicked ass for me.  I hadn't been to a 
party since June of last year.  I guess that I was too bummed to rave.  I went 
to a tiny (<200) UG in Menlo Park on Saturday, and I could not believe how 
much I NEEDED that!  The music got me pumped, and I became a dancin' fool once 
again.  Next Saturday I may be back out in full force.  Looking forward... 
 
PLUR. 
 
Regards,

Dave, I think that lately you haven't even been in the scene.  You've been
to 2 maby 3 raves that I can remeber, and you talk about being in the
scene.  If you've been to a party lately you'd see that the VIBE is very
ALIVE and PLUR, there is so much that it is spreading through the walls. 
Now I don't mean to sound like an asshole because your my friend.  But I
don't think you need to be posting messages like this to people when you
don't even really know what it's about.  What is the deal with "non ravers"
 It's not about being a newbie, or a "non-raver"  We will spread the PLUR
with ANYONE raver or "non-raver"  So if you did know what PLUR means you
wouldn't say things like that... U = Unity and that is what we are all
about not seperating ravers and non-ravers or us from them...that's all I
have to say about that...

I actually agreed with the original poster, and how long he's been in "the
scene" is not a valid argument as to whether or not he's wise -- which I
think he is.

Then you wrote:

and with all your mooing "blah blah blah..." welcome to my NRR file.

People, you have to remember that PLUR is a four letter word, especially
when it's used to beat people over the head. Just insert the name of any
world-dominating (ruining) religion in place of "plur" and you will see
what I mean.

Now can we please talk about music or DJ's or something?

Hey folks, check this out:

about four hours of GOOD music you can listen to while you

Here's my favorite:

It probably is a good idea to listen to what Davids view of the scence
is if he really has only been to 2 or 3 parties. It's a good way to see
how we are being percieved by newbies and 'non-ravers' (To me there is
only 'pre-ravers' :). Especially if he's been going to small parites and
not massives. I'm not shure which he's been at. It's easy to have your
vission blured after you've been involved in the scence for a while and
it becomes tough to see what it looks like to outsiders.

wholesale distributor of Technics products & the wholesale price of a 
Technics SL1200MK2 is $384.00.  So use that as a starting  price of a 
point...keep in mind that your retailer also has to pay shipping of a 
(they ship from the Chicago area) plus make some money--when I g of a 
ordered mine (in May) the manufacturers suggested retail price was  a 
$650.00.  But I know that Technics only makes a set amount of 12's  a 
per year, so as demand increases, the price will go up.  And since  a 
that old line about "everbody wants to be a DJ" seems to be getting a 
more and more realistic everyday, you can't be sure that the prices a 
aren't fluctuating daily.  I hope that this will educate some rices a

I just saw the flyer for the Planet New Year '97 make up party....The lineup
looks great, and its going to be $6 for everyone! I called the number, and
it basically said that it would be at Homebase without saying the word
"Homebase". I am exited....A $6 massive is allways a good thing for me :)
Count me in.

Love is...

...forgetting to breath when she enters the room.

...knowing her favorite ice cream, even when she doesn't even know your 
name.

...two circles that link together.

...a union of mind, heart, and body.

peace and love, you're all the best!

donUt normally discuss or think about.  Sure, there are particular 
characteristics, certain traits that we look for in our significant 
others, traits that we deem attractive and interesting but do we find the 
very origin of love here.  Is why we love someone described by 
revelations like  Rwow, you like cheese in a bottle too,S or Rhey, I Tm  
also really into Yoko!S , or is love a product of something ingrained in 
humanity, an instinctual urge, or a spiritual goal?  
      AristophanesUs concept of a once whole human that was both female 
and male  but was then split in two by Zeus can shed some loving light on 
the matter.  Aristophanes describes present day humans as only half an 
entity, only half a being.  He argues that we were split in two, from an 
androgynous being into distinctly sexed humans.  As we  are now only half 
the creatures we used to be naturally we feel unforfiled, empty, as if 
something is missing.  This RsomethingS being our other half, the part of 
us that was split away, and so we search vehemently for our match.  
According to Aristophanes we must bring the two halves together in order 
to be one again, once we have done this the two people coexist in a 
stasis of love through togetherness.  RLove is born into every human 
being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries 
to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature.S states 
Aristophanies.  
      I agree with Aristophanies, not  that we were all androgynous 
nightmares with enough arms to make Shiva jealous (I am far to much a 
product of the Rhere comes scienceS, kindergarten movement of the 
eighties to buy that one) but that there is a definite intrinsic human 
need for fulfillment.  I have more often heard the argument that this 
feeling of disconnection and unforfillment comes from lack of religious 
connection and can be for filled through religion and spirituality.  But 
what strikes me the most is the use of the term love in both cases.  We 
are bombarded by religions telling us that Love of a god or deity can 
give us what we are missing, can for fill us, can bring us to the 
wholeness Aristophanes speaks about.  My specific interest here is in the 
Idea of love as something that can be shared between humans and as 
something between a human and their religious convictions.  This causes 
me to believe that what leads us to love is our personal manipulation of  
a force.  We can tap into the force of love (and I am speaking of love as 
if it is a tangible, viable,  and malleable energy) through our need to 
love, the intrinsic feeling of unforfilment I spoke of earlier.  Our 
personal manipulation may result in connection with another human, with a 
religion, or in some odd causes with a particular consumer product (its 
the American way).  But weather or not you are in love with a him, a her, 
a god, or a food processor you are in love and are being ravished by a 
force.  This force of love is what gives us forfillment.   Agathon, the 
greek philosopher, knows where I am coming from as he states that RLove 
fills us with togetherness and drains all of our divisiveness away.  Love 
calls gatherings like these together.  In feasts, in dance, and in 
ceremonies, he gives the lead.  Love moves us to mildness, removes from 
us mildness.S  This force is ours to manipulate and to do with what we 
may, we choose to for fill an emptiness within ourselvs with it. This is 
why we love.

Heya, Everyone :)
After a long weekend of raving fun, I want to go to Spundae to finish it
off nice n smooth...would anyone care to join me?  I'd like to carpool with
someone (pitching in for gas, of course :) and maybe even find some cool
people to kick it with after hours...  The lineup looks superb (3 Hardkiss
Bros, Doc Martin, Donald Glaude, etc...), and I surely don't want to miss
it!!
Thanks kindly in advance =]

hello,


>>>This e-mail will donate 3 cents to cancer research by the American Cancer
>>>Society. ACS will donate 3 cents for everyone who receives it, so pass it
>>>along.

i copied the following from a page on the ACS homepage(www.cancer.org) entitled
"Statement on Fraudulent Chain Letter":

_______________________________________________________________________________
Fraudulent Chain Letter

The American Cancer Society is greatly disturbed by reports of a fraudulent
chain letter circulating on the internet which lists the American Cancer
Society as a "corporate sponsor" but which has in no way been endorsed by
the American Cancer Society. This letter appears to have started on America
Online but has now spread well beyond the online service. The text of the
message reads as follows:

LITTLE JESSICA MYDEK IS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND IS SUFFERING FROM AN ACUTE AND
VERY RARE CASE OF CEREBRAL CARCINOMA. THIS CONDITION CAUSES SEVERE
MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMORS AND IS A TERMINAL ILLNESS. THE DOCTORS HAVE GIVEN
HER SIX MONTHS TO LIVE.

AS PART OF HER DYING WISH, SHE WANTED TO START A CHAIN LETTER TO INFORM
PEOPLE OF THIS CONDITION AND TO SEND PEOPLE THE MESSAGE TO LIVE LIFE TO THE
FULLEST AND ENJOY EVERY MOMENT, A CHANCE THAT SHE WILL NEVER HAVE.
FURTHERMORE, THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AND SEVERAL CORPORATE SPONSORS
HAVE AGREED TO DONATE THREE CENTS TOWARD CONTINUING CANCER RESEARCH FOR
EVERY NEW PERSON THAT GETS FORWARDED THIS MESSAGE. PLEASE GIVE JESSICA AND
ALL CANCER VICTIMS A CHANCE.

IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, SEND THEM TO THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AT
ACS@AOL.COM

As far as the American Cancer Society can determine, the story of Jessica
Mydek is completely unsubstantiated. No fundraising efforts are being made
by the American Cancer Society in her name or by the use of chain letters.
Furthermore, the email address ACS@AOL.COM is inactive. Any messages to the
American Cancer Society should be instead sent through the American Cancer
Society website at http://www.cancer.org.

This particular chain letter with its heartbreaking story appears to have
struck an emotional chord with online users. Although we are very concerned
that the  merican Cancer Society's name has been used to manipulate the
online public, we applaud the good intentions of all who participated in
this letter. We are pleased to note that there are so many caring
individuals out there and hope that they will find another way to support
cancer research. Jessica Mydek's story, whether true or false, is
representative of that of many cancer patients who benefit daily from the
efforts of legitimate cancer organizations nationwide.

Hmmm...I'm not too thrilled about giving anymore of my money to Cool World Prod.  It sounds to 
me like they're trying to save face for the fact that they fucked up a whole lotta ppl's New 
Years.  It was my worst New Years nite ever.  $30 bucks for a half ass party and 4 hours of wait 
under pouring rain at the Lake Merrit bart station for the 8 am train back to the city.  My 
faith in them as a reputable crew has been lost.  They shoulda had their shit together better.  
Although the dip shit that kept pulling the fire alarm sure made sure the party got broken up.
My .02 cents worth.

Home ISDN is charged per-minute during prime time, but not at other times.
Pac Bell has been repeatedly submitting the same proposal to charge per-minute
all the time for ISDN.  They already do charge businesses per-minute all
the time
for ISDN.   Another part of their proposal is to double all the per-minute
rates.
These proposals have been getting shot down, so far.  

I have no doubt that they and the other RBOC's would love to meter not only
all
data service, but all service, period.  They may find it rather difficult
to do this
when they no longer have a monopoly though.  One long-distance carrier is
offering
unlimited calling within the entire calling area (Crescent City thru Santa
Cruz, not
just what Pac Bell considers a local call).  With that kind of competition,
I don't see
how they can do it.

If they do, they may be giving the market away to the cable tv industry
anyway.

Hey everyone!

A bunch of people have been asking me what happend to Audio Imact, so here
ya go...

As most of you know, we've suspended AI for the moment. It's the usual
story, spaces, and of course, the associated owners. Whacked.

Fear not, for we have an angle.  ;)

We're looking at getting a permanent local, and are taking the time to line
things up proper. 

Stay in touch with the BASS Kru voicemail, as they are always out and about
tearing things up.

It hurts!  I felt these same things at one point.  I've written similar things:
"Love is the wound that never heals...", also some songs, one called
"Farewell" (meant to read as a suicide note) and one of my masterpieces,
called "Love Denied."  I'll send anyone who's interested a copy of either
or both.
I have a much more positive outlook on love now, though romantic love
always manages to elude me.  My interest has always been returned with
fear or rejection or a series of vicious attacks and behavior which made
me feel that women like nothing better than to find a nice guy and
destroy his heart.  I know better than that now, and I know that my
sweetheart is out there, somewhere.  I dearly look forward to the time
we shall meet, and give each other our whole hearts.
Love to all,
Eric

With all this talk about positvity and Luv in the air it seems that this
weekend is gonna be... different.

Dispite my Doctors recommendation (I tell everyone im a raver) and a few
of my SO-SO's (Sort-Of-Sig.Others) telling me to "Stay Home".  I think
I'm gonna sneak off to a few of the parties this weekend.  I doubt I'll
be dancin' but i'll be hangin' in the shadows feeling the vibe....


hope to see you out there!

I have this track, The sample "baddest mothafucka on 2 turntables"
comes from a  King tech & sway 12inch of the same name. It may
have been bit by someone elese and put into a breakbeat track.(seems 
like a sample icey would use in his own stuff)
But it originated from this late 80s hip hop/dance record.
       
    
later, sean......

I've also heard it on Logic Records "Dope on Plastic Vol. 3"
compilation, I think it was track 2, but I dont have the CD on me, so 
I can't get the name.  It's a Trip Hop track, and the sample "baddest
mothafucka on 2 turntables goin' on" repeats about a million times. 
More likeley you would have heard that recently at a party since it's
baddass trip hop.  I would play it.  The song is really long and is easy
to mix with other tracks.

Now Wait a Minute!!!

I LIKE The Sound of Music!!!!

(Isn't that the one with Gene Kelly? He's one of the dancers I get my
inspirations from... waitaminute, I'm thinking of Brigadoon, not to be
confused with Bonnydoon)

But a very valid point Deep,  Many of my younger friends parents look at
me with a bit of suspicion when I tell them I rave.  But my actions are
not those of a seedy drug dealer/user and  I actually get some postive
feed back when I play one of my mixtapes (of course, my melodic mixes,
not, the hardcore / hardtrance stuff.).  I try to convey the aspect of
ravers moreso through actions, than just words.  If we believed
EVERYTHING the media protrayed (aside from being mindless sheep) we'd be
jumping @ our shadows with parinioa.


"Im singing in the rain...." (Cough, cough, hack...sputter...No wonder
Im sick)

Pengo made a good point here...

I'd like to sort of elaborate on that.  This story has an SFRaver 
starring in this one, I hope it was ok.  I didn't ask prior permission.  
Adam, you've got permission to put me in a story, ok?  =]

Imagine that we are all watching TV.  We're going to go rent a movie.  
Something with lots of action, like "Die Hard".  

Now Adam G. comes over and says "hey i heard there's a party here!"  and 
we say "yeah, man we're going to watch 'die hard', please pop the tape 
in."  so he does that and we get all excited because we're expecting to 
see lots of action (you might not like diehard, but play along, it's 
fun!) and we're going to see bruce willis and other people creating lots 
of explosions and all that...

and then the tape starts rolling.  

it's a wide shot panning up this grassy green hill, and out comes julie 
andrews singing "...the hills are alive, with the sound of music!"

oops. did someone put the wrong tape in?  well, don't worry adam.  it 
wasn't your fault, it was mine.  i handed the wrong tape to you.  

But you see, that's what some of us are doing in the rave scene.  We're 
putting the wrong tape in the VCR.  We want the cops and our parents and 
other people to see the show "raves are great and spiritual and lots of 
friends", but what they're actually watching is "20/20".  

now obviously some people have decided to stay on one channel for good.  
and that's sad, because we have thousands to choose from.  each person 
has a different point of view, and therefore a different channel we can 
choose.  

Perhaps we can all lead by example.  Work with parties and promoters that 
care and start creating a new show.  it's called "PLUR TV".

Wasn't there some slogan...oh yeah, Kill Your Television.  Now THAT'S a
novel idea.  Especially when this new channel airs! Yikes!!!

Better yet, my vote is for NO TV.

Dunno, funny you say that, but the same thing happens to me, all the
time, especially when I am smiling.  E is too expensive, smiles are more
affordable for me.  I think when people ask you that, they want to
relate to someone who's also feeling the effects of the drug.  It is
very common that when you are tripping, especially on L, to think that
others are also tripping.

DRC's name is Darcy, and so is her girlfriend's name.  I don't know if
her girlfriend is a DJ or not.  I am quite sure these are two different
people.  DRC has short blond hair, Darcy (the girlfriend) has long blond
hair.  Does this help a little?

It should be noted that the entire teleservice pricing schedule and switch 
network was and is designed to handle voice calls which have traditionally 
averaged around 3 minutes in duration.  With an average call of 3 minutes, the 
phone network infrastructure was perfectly capable of handling the volume of 
users.  With the use of modems and the vastly longer usage times (esp. with the 
use of the Web),  the switching networks have become overloaded, even to the 
point of occasionally becoming "full" at peak times (i.e., you pick up the 
phone, and receive no dial tone.)  This, of course, raises the ire of uses, as 
the phone is viewed as a lifeline tool.  Thus, local loop providers and RBOCs 
have had to make significant investments in infrastructure, which is not cheap 
(price out a public network-quality switch sometime.  The whole point is that 
there is some justification for this price raise.  RBOCs are trying to create 
almost two networks, one for voice (analog transmission) and one for digital, 
which will benefit users of both once its completed. Adios, Nathan

Subject: Intro and thoughts on first rave
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Hello, tout.  First post disclaimer, etc.  Here's a little intro on
how I am getting drawn into it all.

I went to Nikita at 1015 Folsom a couple of months ago.  It was the
first time I'd ever been to a dance club, and I loved it.  I
especially liked the different vibes in each room, and the way you
could be your own dj by slowly walking from room to room.  I'd be
tranced out in that big ass room, and then slowly get drawn by the
drums and bass in the basement, all the while letting myself make
that transition from vibe to vibe.  I found a new type of music that
my body enjoyed exploring.  And so it was the music/dancing and not
the people that got me curious enough to go to my first rave.  So I
headed straight to hyperreal.com, where usually I ignore the rave
archives and head straight for the "chemistry" archives, but not this
time.  So I scoured the files.  Yum yum.  Read alot about PLUR.  My
personal philosophy is similar.

So I decided to go to First Contact (end of Jan), and it was cool,
but not mindblowing like I hoped.  Took 15 mg's to see bees, and many
things I did see.  I enjoyed to large visual screen and the slide
projection sequences.  I was expecting an infusion of PLUR, but found
the general attitude to be self-engrossed.  My self-consciousness was
probably hampering me initially, but then the bees started buzzing
and I too was self-engrossed.  So, you got to give to get, and that's
why I didn't feel the PLUR vibe.  

I danced, but for some reason i didn't click in.  Maybe because I was
too absorbed by the new experience, trying to figure out the system,
the vibe, I didn't have as much fun as I could have.  And so I'm
excited go to another rave, and I'd like to experience it as an
insider this time instead of an outsider.  Any thoughts on how I
should approach it this time?  Maybe I can find someone's wing.

On a different note, I've noticed a lot of discussion on public
perception of rave culture.  If you don't like the way the culture is
being perceived by the public, the rave culture as a community needs
to do some outreach.  That seems to be the general consensus.  It's
not going to stay underground forever.

Thanks all for letting me share,
George

To answer your 1st question...   I think I have finally figured it out..
There must be this guy at the ravEs, that goes by the name Eon. But no one
knows what he looks like, but everyone wants to meet him.. So they take
time out of there ravE habbits, to go out and search for the mysterious Eon
guy..

The truth was that this message wasn't even sent to you. It was sent to SF
Raves. And the message I wrote never said anything even close to "I'm going
to put it/you in my kill file." I don't even use a kill file. I use
filters. They are different.

But since you have probably guessed correctly that you are in quite a few
peoples' kill files (understandably, based on how you responded to me, both
publicly and privately), you seem to be hypersensative to the possibility
that one more person is no longer reading your posts. This hypersensativity
has created a self fufilling prophecy.

And, once again, with feeling, what I said was: I am now going to filter
all messages with LOVE in the title to my SFR/NRR folder -- to be read
later (i.e. when I have insomnia) -- not to be killed.

Before you go off and jump the gun in the future, read the words and don't
be so Ran-centric and think that all messages posted to SF Raves are
written to *you*.

hi :-)

i think these badges are nifty and helpful, but i was thinking it might be
fun to design a new one (uh oooohh, hope i dont ofend anyone, but i just
thought it could be fun, not that i dont like the ones ive seen out there.)

sooo, my idea so far is this: If i was a turtle then when im out raving and i
get sleepy and need to take a little nap id have my house right there with
me, and could take a cozy nap and then get up and rave rave rave some more
:-). so i have been doodling out raving turtles grooving to funky tunes and
trying to work in "SFRaves" too. 

but, im not such a great artist and all my turtles look pretty bored. 

If anyone out there is a good turtle artist could you let me know? 

thank you tons and tons,
jeremy

				Hi SFRavers!

Finally am able to be at the computer for more than 30 minutes here at 
Univ. of DVC :-)  Well, I'll be brief and get to the point . . . 
	This last weekend I threw a little b-day party for my cousin 
(she's in her teens), and all of her friends, and I would just like to 
say that the D.I.Y. thing definitely turned out perfect, and I had a 
wonderful time.  There was two 15" speakers, the 1200's, blacklights, fog 
machine, the works! It turned out beautifully, even though this was a b-day 
party and we were not going to make *any* profits whatsoever.  
	From the bottom of my heart, I would like to sincerely thank 
*ALL* promoters in this scene of ours (past, present, and future) for 
making events happen.  You guys have to go through a lot of B.S. and hard 
work in order to finally have that needle drop onto the vinyl, to the 
glow of the morning sun.  Thanks again!

				B

I read that he was playing at Nikita.  If this is true, how come the last
rave he played at he was billed as "Last rave performace".  Was this false
advertising, did he decide to hop back into the saddle, what gives?

Thanks,

Well, unfortunately, 1015 is fascist when it comes to IDs. Highly doubtful
that you'll get in without a GOOD fake.

Subject: Union Of Everyone

To Everyone Who Cares:

   With all the media attention, legal issues, and violations of citizens
rights, we, as a culture, have decided to do something about it. We our
forming a national organization to protect and defend the rights of people
who chose to live their life underground. I have contacted the ACLU and
the Citzen's Commision on Human Rights and they have advised us to form an
organization of our own. They strongly agree that a whole organization of
people with the same interests is the best route to take.

So join in and let your voice be heard.

The organization is going to be named PLUR (Protecting and Living The
Underground Culture), for now. If anyone has ideas on a different name
mail it. We need it soon, within the next few days because we our going to
print flyers, t-shirts, member cards, bumper stickers, letterhead and the
whole deal. 

What you Get: The fee for joining is going to be $10.00 (the cost of a
small rave) and will include a mass amount of stuff. We will scope out an
area for you if you are planning to have a rave (i.e. legal issues such as
permits, curfews, building capacities, and everything involved). We will
have a legal staff to advise you on your rights for any reason (being
arrested, fined, harrassed, and barred entry from events). We have found
to volunteer lawyers to defend the rights of legal cases in which we think
a persons rights have been violated (This includes promoters, Djs, ravers,
average people). We will get and give you all legal information for
protests etc., as we plan to have a physical involvement in those. You
will also get a monthly newsletter, i.d. card, bumper sticker
(re-useable), an invitation to a members only national rave (coming this
summer, which hopefully will be free), along with all of the services
listed above for free. This isnot everything, as we are just forming and more stuff will be included in
the offical application. You must e-mail portod@ccbc.ml.org to recieve an
application. Include your name, address, phone number, and e-mail.
Depending on the costs we wish to include a t-shirt with our logo, your
member name, and your city and state.
We will be a legal organization. I have the papers on their journey in the
mail. We are legal and the Offical club of the underground culture.


This is going to be the best thing that has happened for our culture since
it was born. Please join, we need a couple of thousand people to really
stand up and make a difference. We are the first and only organization
that is not afraid to defend who we are. We have put alot of effort this
past year into this and it is finally here. Make a difference, join our
organization.

E-Mail portod@ccbc.ml.org for an application or more info.

now am i just being paranoid...or wouldn't this "union" be a great scam
from the government to get all of our addresses, names and etc.

Plus they want us to tell them where we're having the raves ahead of
time..so they can give us "legal council".

disclaimer:
i'm just kidding...but it would be smart of the gov.
i'm sure these guys are probably legit and a worthy cause...after
all...we definitely need something like this.

......but u never know  ;)

sorry guys i was bored and at work

  Today was my birthday and I feel like *I* should be the one giving out
presents.  So wrap your arms around yourself and squeeze them tight while you
pucker up your lips.  Ready.... 

             Ok... you look like a fool!!  No!  I'm just kidding.. that was a
big hug and kiss from me hoping everyone has a happy Vallentine's day!  Maybe
I'll see some of you this weekend, but I'm not sure where I'm going yet.
 Have a good Day!!!

Superduper strict.  Their liquor license is their pot o' gold and they 
ain't gonna compromise it for anyone.

And if they suspect an i.d. is fake, they will confiscate.

YEAH!
we should all propose ideas for possible laminates...
	i was looking at socal raves site and they have a few different 
	laminates uploaded there... it might be cool ?!

STILL!...  PHAT props out to terry (ctdzyne) who created the first and 
**original** sfraves laminate (to my knowledge)! he was my inspiration 
for collection laminated stuff :)  thanx terry!

	we should designate a web site to host the new ideas for 
laminates if people are down to create such... i guess our site is a 
possibility if no one else has another idea!  PLUR PEEPS

I know that CT made up a bunch of laminates and was starting to distribute
them through other folks... from what I hear at most of the cool events
there is someone with a bunch o' laminates... I guess ya have to keep your
eyes open...

Because Nikita is _definitely_, without a doubt, anything but a rave.

Also because Nikita, in the face of lagging attendance, is willing to 
shell out big bucks to bigname "superstar" dj's in order to bring in the 
masses.

And because "superstar" dj's like to be paid like the superstars they 
think they are.  For some, it's all 'bout money and fame (or what's possible 
in the dance culture) - so perhaps, this is the reason behind Keoki's 
abandonment of "raves." 

I saw Keoki there in the spring.  Despite numerous trainwrecks and a 
shocking display of bad attitude, his set was crowd-pleasing and the 
place was packed.  I'd see him there again.

Probably reading the archives and this list can mis-prepare you for the 
experience.  The friendliness and openness has definitely deteriorated 
over the years, even from when I started (2 years ago) - and back then 
old school ravers were bemoaning the "end of the scene" that occurred in 
'93 with wide-scale attendance.

This is why you will see people talk about bringing it back DEEP 
underground.  Because anyone can come to a party and they don't 
necessarily bring love and light.  It used to be that people brought toys 
and gifts and fruit for everyone.  I rarely see that now.  It is still a 
special environment, but the really transcendent moments of group 
togetherness seem more sparse.  But when they do happen, WOW.

A lot of people _are_ into their own thing.  In fact, a lot of people are 
tripping or just dancing or whatever.  But after a while, you realize 
that all (or most)  of you are there for the same reason, and there is a 
comfort and an easiness, and even if you aren't "bonding" with people, 
you are still there _together_, rather than separate "costumers" like at 
a club, for example.

My advice?  Look at it as a great party, a place to have fun with cool 
people.  Many many people have experienced great insights and 
mind-blowing connections at parties... so when we old-timers talk of 
PLUR or lessons we've learned, we understand each other... but it can't 
be forced.  Just go to have fun, and if you do, keep going.  And maybe 
along the way you'll run across something really cool.

love,
Nancy

Since I will happily be out of town this weekend, frolicking in the snow,
gambling away my money, and shrooming in the trees, I must pass on my
recommendations.  Getting really good vibes from Techno Love Children
(support new UG's!) and here's a surprise rec for ravers -- Spundae's
4-Year Anniversary!!  I had so much fun here at the Martin Luther King Jr. 
weekend party.  This is their anniversary and I'm sure they will put on a
fabulous party.  And I _want_ to read reviews!! 

Have fun, and see you all at Shine (I book my rave calendar weeks ahead ;)

There is something i don't quite understand.

If everyone only has to pay $10, where do all the other money nevessary to
start and run this "union" come from? It sounds like a good idea, I hope
it gets off the ground.

How long do you guys think this whole scene will last? All I know is that
I've been playing with computers and listening to techno since I the late
80s and they are both now exploding in our society... I guess you could
call us cyber-hippies. 

I'm staring out my office window into Oakland and I can see the twin
buildings and 2 American flags from my view point. I work for Farallon in
Alameda.

Piece.

Very surprised to run across a flier for a $6 Cool World make-up party,
with a (promised) thick line-up.  (I keep hearing that monster-truck-rally
voice in my head!) People can do their best to trash _this_ move, but it
at least shows some concern for their market.  My cynical side realizes 
that this is to keep the customers satisfied, but _at least_ it proves 
that even the largest and most commercial "rave" events have to display 
some commitment to the scenesters.

Also, I didn't hear a peep on here a few weeks ago when the rave held next 
door to Pacific/Gateway (forgot the name!) threw their ($5) make-up 
party.  Thought I'd point out that that occured.

So, whatever happened to the promised Pac/Gateway make-up party?!  I'm 
still clutching my ticket.  If the $20 turns into a donation for a summer 
of Sunsets, I'm cool with that... just wondering.

Wrong! :-)

I proposed the original SF Raves in August 1995. The night of the Friends
and Family party in August 1995 Vince immediately found me and agreed it
was an excellent idea to get us all together and soon after that he debuted
the original laminate design. We are partners in crime, and he's definitely
the visual artist in our family... we made and distributed a BUNCH of them
in 1995 and 1996.

Later Terry did his laminate design, which we thought was cool and Vince
didn't really make any more after that, giving Terry the opportunity to
spread his art around.

Then Vince, not to sit on the sidelines, rolled out the *very limited
edition* SFR button, of which there are only a couple hundred. The design
is an excellent "repurposement" of the STP logo. I have some at home and
will bring them to parties again if any of you want them.

pax, man.

 Love is like being given the choice between eating cat shit and eating
 dog shit... and when you complain about it, people tell you, "well
 at least you've got freedom of choice!" ...

Not that anybody cares, but I believe an SFR badge/laminate predated
the Aug 1995 F&F badge -- I think it was made sometime around  92 or
93. My memory is fuzzy, but it was sometime between The Whoopie Ball
and the SFR Connection III rave... I'm not sure, but I think Bob
Ramstad and/or Arthur Chandler had something to do w/ this
badge/button.

I thank you all, and my mail filter, and my always-hungry kill files
for allowing my continued participation on this list over the years!

At Evolution, I previously wrote about a song that I thought said "Baddest

song Icey played (and possibly doubled up on) had the sample "hear the
drummer get wicked"

here's a cheezy rendition of how it went:
(breakbeat) hear the drummer, hear the drummer, hear the drummer get wicked
hear the drummer, hear the drummer, get get wicked...

hope somebody knows

OK so i've been convinced by the masses that I need to go to Love 
A-Fair on Saturday night. After all I haven't been to Home Base since 
Halloween Tribal Massive and damnit I kinda MISS being able to wander 
aimlessly and not feel incredibly cramped :)
	SO my question, to Vlad, Ray Vonie, whoever you are.. Since 
you are saying Love A-Fair is going to be so different.. Can I bring 
fruit for people to share? I mean usually when I try to bring fruit or 
food to share other than blopops, it gets smashed/taken by the 
security guards and I really don't feel like bringing some yummy 
oranges or lemons or pineapple only to see it ground into the 
concrete minutes after arriving at the door. I guess I can kind of 
understand the security involved in not bringing in fruit (YEA THIS 
GUY, 
HE BROUGHT ORANGES LACED WITH LSD INTO A pARTY ONCE <-= never heard

Dear Ravefriends,

        I've asked the San Francisco Libertarian Party to postpone until
next month the discussion of rave busts and what can be done about it that
I'd asked to have on the agenda of tonight's SFLP meeting.
        Since I haven't been part of the SFRaves conversation recently to
remind people of the meeting, or even to know what has been talked about, I
thought it best to wait and hopefully gather more folks to come next month
with a bit more preparation.
        My absence has been due partly to a problem of my getting
unsubscribed every time I rejoin the high-volume main list (apparantly a
bug in my service provider's software that they're working on fixing) and
partly to other things going on like a new fulltime job and the planning of
this Friday, when my fiance Chikako and I will be getting married!  (More
on this in separate post to come...)
        I haven't even yet gotten around to reading the posts to the SFR
legal list, but I have them all saved and intend to do so ASAP, because
this is an issue that is important to me.
        If someone hasn't beaten me to the punch I hope to do some legal
research on the permit process, public gatherings, and so forth in order to
be armed with some concrete data to bring to the table.
        Look forward to seeing many of you (I hope) a month from now...

May the bass be with us,
                                        <<< Starchild >>>

For those interested, I still have both the old and new designs on a web
page given to the SFRavers who want to put up art work on the web.  I've
only had a few submissions, but I invite anyone that wants to show their
artistic side to send me any art they'd like to add.  NOTE:  It doesn't
have to have the SFR logo, even though all the current art does.  The
URL is http://www.tgrigsby.com/sfraves/index.html.

 I don't know if you want to go this way but San jose State is supposed 
to have some really nice studios and classes to go with them. I know of 
one woman who studied film scoring there and then went on to work at the 
Lucas ranch in Marin.

 Good luck!

Hey all, 
First I would like to say Hi to all those SFRavers out there....I was on
the list a while back...and recently moved back to SF. Glad to see
everyone survived that trainwreck and stuck it out. 
Anyway.....I haven't heard much about Organic...any of you peeps have
the 411 on it? Inside/outdoor, sound, visuals, etc.....
How about Techno Love Children? I've been out of town for so long I'm
clueless on what different promoters/parties are up to these days. ..
Please, please fill me in! 
My s/o will be attending her first event this weekend _ack!!_ .
I want her to really feel the vibe and the positive emotion all
around....
I've been telling her all about what a beautiful and enhancing
experience it will be for her this wknd....please help me make it happen
by filling me in on the parties. Thanks in advance........
 oh, 
Love is......
	that rush of adrenalin, and that knot in my stomach I feel every time I
think back to the life altering experience I had at Come-together 
Unity.....way back when.....(92 -I think....it was at that civic center
in........Richmond?? guessing here)

peace, love, UR, and HAPPY V-DAY....

I think the whole laminate thing is a great idea. By distributing them I
was able to meet a ton of you in a short period of time. Since then I felt
that my laminates would serve a better purpose if I gave a couple to other
SFRavers so they could meet new people just like I did.

As far as new laminates...there's no SFR commission, (Well, except for
Randy, Krusty, Black Adder, Neils, and JSL--->> I'M KIDDING!! PLEASE DON'T
FLAME ME!!) So if you have any kind of talent, by all means make up your
own. Or, for the artisticly challenged, feel free to download my laminate
at:

http://www.tgrigsby.com/sfraves/index.html.

                 or

http://www.cyborganic.com/people/ctdzine

Print some out, laminate them and give them out to fellow SFRavers. Or, ask
around, I'm sure there's still a few of mine floating around, and if
there's a demand I'd be glad to make more.

Still, I think it would be cool if I had a personalized laminate from each
and everyone of you.

love, energy, and viberations,

Terry

  First, thanks to all who emailed me their suggestions. I wasn't able to
listen to a DJCarlos tape; but I did spend a good deal of time at Tower
and Borders (where they will let you listen to ANY 3 CDs at a private
listening post -- terrific policy!). Here's my take:
  1) The best -- or, at least, my favorite -- Latin mixes are dance based,
and very specifically dance-oriented. Merengue, salsa, and macarena
dominate, though there are others. And not all Latin dance mixes
are done by Latinos. Two very interesting CDs I listened to were *Fatal
Mambo*, done by a group from southern France, and Afrirumba, an African
group doing a Latin American form and speaking French half the time. :<O
  2) The Latin mixers excel the Nortes in the use of smaller percussion
instruments, whether real or sampled -- timbales, bongos, bells, etc.
Sometimes you're not even aware of all that's going on until you tune into
the mid- and upper ranges.
  3) If you're used to brushing off Latin music because of the traditional
brass chorus shout lines or traditional harmonies (as I was), park your
prejudices and get up and DANCE. 

  That said, here's my Grand Champ Recommendation for SFRaves:

                    Fiesta Mix USA '97 (#PROD-7061)

  The least impressive tracks (like the Lambada mix in #2)  are merely
good. The best are volcanic. If you play this CD through a good stereo
system and remain sitting down, you need to see a doctor.  :<)

Today I started reading a book titled "Nothing in This Book Is True. But
It's Exactly How Things Are" by Bob Frissell. At first I thought this
was just another one of those crop cycle books the I found myself
becoming more and more interested as I read one. Is there anyone else on
SFraves who enjoys learning about extraterrestrial possibilities? And if
so could you explain some of the alien races further they mention in
this book? Such as the Anunnaki/Nefilim, Sirians, Martians, Greys,
Pleiadians, etc. If this subject matter is a little embarrassing please
respond privately. I find this book very interesting. I one specific
tale Bob talks about a tribe near Timbuktu in Africa called the Dogon.
The book claims that this tribe has had information for more than 700
years which is impossible for them to have known. They said that there
was another star orbiting the star Sirius. Scientists did not discover
the second star until 1970 when a large telescope was sent into space.
To quote from the book, "When a team of scientists visited the Dogon
tribe to find out how they knew about this, the elders said that a
flying saucer landed. Beings emerged and made a large hole in the ground
which they filled with water. The occupants, who looked like dolphins,
jumped into the lake they had made, then came up to shore, and talked to
the Dogon people." (Frissell, p. 26). I found this absolutely amazing. I
would have to see an alien before I believed in them but this made me a
little more partial to anyone who believes in UFO's. If anyone would
like to get the book it is only $12.95 available from Frog, Ltd in
Berkeley. :)

  I was listening to a BBC piece this evening about the rise of punk 
music incorporating fascist messages in Germany.  They had a DJ, Alex 
Empire (I believe) who commented on it.  They asked him if anti-fascists 
were also using music and he referred to how electronic music is used to 
unify everyone.
  The piece that followed was about Indonesia implementing the death 
penalty for ecstasy smugglers.  They said that E is more widespread (and 
expensive) than in Europe.  The reporter said it was available even in 
remote areas, and that clubs in that country attract crowds of ~15,000.

 Sorry. My mistake. I didn't even know there was a difference between the

Aaaah.... You're right, "E'in" sounds better. I didn't ketch that one.
Ha... can you believe it's 6am and I'm sitting here getting paid to
listen to some killer trance in some fat headphones, drinking some good
fucking coffee... and read sfraves.

I am getting really impatient for Saturday night peoples. I bet we'll be
running into eachother and not even known it. Me and my buddy are going to
Love Affair and are going to have a blast, I just know it....

What kind of electronic music do you guys like the most? I would have to
say I like Trance the most... I love how Eric explained his feelings
towards the who electronic music thing. How it puts you in a different
place, a different world.

Peace.... I actually spelled that "piece" yesterday and didn't realize it
until I was at home. Man, my mind is in the clouds.

-Byroni

Where's the rave scene the biggest???

Lets all go to Indonesia!! 15,000 people. Damn. I would have never
imagined that.

It's a muslim country I believe, so the death penalty for E doesn't
surprise me. I've read that monks in Asia use small doses of E to help
them meditate. Did you know that in Malaysia women can't even drive? And
if you get a DUI you and your wife are killed. I learned this interesting
tid-bit in traffic school.

Do people still Candyflip??  remember the band? I have the tape in my car
and have been listening to it lately. "Strawberry Fields Forever".

One last question.....

Who's your favorite electronic bands? Name 3.

Here's mine:

1. Future Sound of London
2. Underworld
3. Chemical Brothers

I love the stuff.... I just spend too much money on it... but it's my
money so who gives....

I remember when I heard Papua New Guinea for the first time on the Cool
World soundtrack... I fell in love with FSOL at that very moment.

I guess I'm going to be known as the new guy to sfraves that has diarea of
the fingers... typing so damn much.

there are files dated back to August of 1993. So there were logos and

This is a little contraption I was thinking of as I was emerging from REM...

You know, it's got a square barrel.  Pretty convincing, yanno?  

So next time some lowlife jerk-o-matic comes up to you and tries to make 
your day as miserable as theirs...get out this little contraption.  

Just pull that thing out point it right at their skull (or their funny 
bone if you can find it) and say "ALL RIGHT MAN THIS IS IT I'VE HAD JUST 
ABOUT ENOUGH OF YOU...IT'S THE BRICKS FOR YOU BABY!!!!!!!!!"

...Slowly pull back on that [thing that usually cocks the bullet thing] 
and look at them right in the eye and say "You're an annoying piece of 
..."  Go ahead.  Clench that lower lip.  Lift the upper lip in total 
digust.  

And shoot!  Ha Ha!  Hee Hee!  It's just a hologram!  This guy sees the 
brick flying right after him, he ducks,but no avail it ducks with him and 
when it finally reaches his nose hairs...it breaks up into a million 
little happy faces...and scares him half to death!  He runs out of the 
room in terror as you of course blow on that smoking barrel...

[the preceding announcement brought to you by REM sleep.  no purchase 
necessary must be 18 to play.]

Sounds like Nation 12 "Hear the Drummer" on Rhythm King. I saw some copies
around last year, so it may have been repressed, as the original is from
'91 or '92. Considering Icey's sampling habit, though, it could have been
one of his tracks sampling the original, which in itself was a sample...

Hey Man!!  Hows it going?

The school I went to, Cogswell College, has an absolutly amazing music 
program.  The program is a Bachlor of Science in Music Technology.  They 
also have a Certificate Program, which is what I took.  They basiclly 
teach you everything you need to know about sound, sampling, digital 
audio, recording techniques, sound design, sequencing, etc.....  The only 
bummer is, its kinda expensive.  Like 500 bucks a unit, and most classes 
are two or three units.  But that was a couple of years ago, not sure how 
much its costs now.

The book to check out on the whole Sirius thing is "The Sirius Mystery" by
Robert Temple, a British astronomer.  He goes over the African stuff and
also draws similar information out of the Egyption and Babylonian
mythological traditions, tracing it all back to a common origin in
extraterrestrial contact six or seven thousand years ago.  It will point
you to the anthropological studies of the Dogon (and Bozo, another tribe)
that brought their Sirius-knowledge to light.  The Dogon/Bozo stuff is also
entertainingly expounded in Tom Robbins' latest novel, "Half Asleep in Frog
Pajamas."

Umm, no offense to anyone, but the Macarena--SUCKS!! Que estupido! It's
the equivalent of that cheesy, lame production coming out of Florida
called the Train. The one that goes "Come on ride the train... blah blah
blah"

Latin music such as salsa, cumbia, etc. are great, but the cheesy dance
songs are so silly.    (my opinion, of course)  By the way, the Macarena
is all about this woman and her sex appeal--something *not* very appealing
to me.

DOWN WITH SEX APPEAL!!! Let's all be bland and uninteresting and
non-sexual as possible, eh?

Really?  When I went to Spundae on MLK, Jr. weekend, the place was packed
(Club 55), and there were times when there was no room on each dance floor
for me.  Welp, maybe since it's a club, it's too, um, clubby, for most
people on sfraves...but I like it ;)

Her sex appeal?  How about it's about her swooping on her boyfriend's
TWO best friends while he's out of town?  SLUT!!  SLUT!!  GRRRRR!!!  Now
if it had been about a guy swooping his girlfriend's THREE best friends
while *she's* out of town... well... that would be cool....

(Pan out:  A laughing SDream runs for his life as the females of SFRaves
begin lobbing mail bombs in his direction...)

Which leads me to a question: A lot of the ladies on this list have
voiced the opinion in the past that raves are much more enjoyable to go
to because they don't have the "meat market" aspect that most clubs
have.  I don't think there's any doubt though that the scene is changing
lately.  Would you ladies say that the same still holds true?

A few years ago (maybe '93?) before I was ever into raving I just *happened*
to be in Berlin the very weekend of the love parade. I had no idea what
it was all about or even that it was happening until I found myself in
the middle of it! Man, if I had only known then what I know now!

We had walked down to the Kurfurstendamm (the main boulevard in Berlin)
to go out to dinner, and were wondering what all these crowds were doing, 
and along comes a whole procession of big flat-bed trucks loaded with huge 
speaker systems pounding out this GREAT techno - each truck sounding better 
than the last - and throngs of happy ravers dancing on the trucks and 
following them down the boulevard, dancing in the streets, handing out 
fliers, and just having a wonderful time. The vibe was amazing - of course
I'd never been to a rave then, so to my untrained heart it was something
to behold. People were smiling and dancing and it was just great. I think
it was then that I decided I'd better check this scene out - those people
were having WAY more fun than I was!

Now I kick myself that I didn't follow them down the street and join in
the rest of the evening's activities! But they planted the seed in me!
I'd be interested to hear if anyone else actually got more involved and
experienced the raves themselves - it seemed to me that it was pretty
much a weekend of raves rather than just the parade itself, and that
maybe there was even more than one parade (?) (but then again I guess 
that in Berlin, EVERY weekend is a weekend of raves!!!!).

Love to you all - have a GREAT weekend!!!!

- Martin  =]

I am now adding "PLUR" ot my NRR filter rules.

Why PLUR, that most sacred communication of raving? (I can hear the uproar
among those that are more feeling than analytical.)

PLUR is a very beautiful concept. PLUR should be practiced, PLUR should be
teached. But PLUR has gone from being an interesting utopian meme to a
"bible" that is hit over others heads from on high as some kind of moral
hammer. I'm tired of seeing "If you practiced PLUR you would not have done
that." or "Blah, blah, blah... you would go around hugging your enemies if
you <blank> PLUR." or whatever.

So, to keep my main SFR mailbox in line with raving and not all the
tangentical drug and 12-step talk, "PLUR" now joined the filtered ranks of
"Addidas", "Cool World", "E", "Heroin" and "420".

Flame on, I love all of you! :-)

Nope... the first was done by Vince many moons ago. It was blue and yellow
and green and kinda big, but beautiful. Terry made his on his own volition
when people decided they wanted a new one.

there already is one, and it's about 1 year old. Find SDream's homepage;
it's there. (www.tgrigsby.com, I think...) Terry's design is there, as are
some others and three from me. I didn't have the grit that terry did to
just go out and make mine, but I've heard reports that there's a few
bootlegs of mine designs out there, maybe laminated by Adam or Brendan? I
don't know who did 'em... I think I saw Austin wearing one at Freedom.

I have friends who are really close to turning 21.... I'm the only one

That looks like a VERY good line-up.

        I've found that Odwalla "Superfood" (it comes as a funky green
drink) gives me a ton of energy and makes me feel really clear and fresh. 

        It actually seems to live up to it's name. 

        Try some Cliff bars, they're better than powerbars and they work
great for sustained energy.

        So many people try to force themselves to be happy or to get up and
dance. You should be in a positive mind, and a great mood, after that you'll
have a ton of energy and nothin can stop ya. You're mind (if used correctly)
can be used to influence any little function of your body. All you have to
do is to learn how to influence yourself and you'll be just great.

        That's how I do it.

SMILE:)

How many of you are going to go on Sunday night? I ask only because most of
my friends will be gone and I would love nothing more but to be in the
company of this community.

love and peace,

Wow, talk about weird.  I receive this email today from some person I've
never heard of.  The message reads "Now that's a spam"

The kicker?  It's addressed to 191 different people, all named *Shawna*, all
different people with different addresses, but all with that same first name
spelled the same way.  Very weird!  While somewhat amusing (and with much
rumination with regards to why on earth he did this), it's still weird to
know that some people really do have nothing fucking better to do with their
stupid lives!  :/

  Wait a minute... I fully support this effort and am totally into
contributing myself towards it, however... I think that some of what is
proposed (in the original post) is contradictory to true "rave" ideals and
I think that we all oughtta have our acts together before we go to capitol
hill or the front lawn of the white house to rave and/or protest...

...

  I will simply say that an event like this cannot go down, truly
representing raves, without allowing each and everyone one of us to do what
we want. That's what I think it's about... Loving each other for what we
are. [people could be urged to accept repsonsibility for their actions]
  It woudln't be right to tell people that since we're in Washington: you
can't be a "homosexual" or "red head" or "southerner" or "female" or
"black" or "fucking PeeWee Hermain". We are all our best when we are
ourselves. :)
  If we are going to go to Washington as ravers, then we go as ravers and
stand up for what we believe in. I won't be a wimp-ass and go up there,
perpin'... Cuz', if it's going to hit home... It should be done up right.
Besides, Slick Willy might actually take a puff [and inhale]... ya never
know... :)

It is actually pretty interesting stuff; it's based around a type of
algae (genus _Spirulina_, looks like a cool little spaghetti/corkscrew
shape under the 'scope) that aparently grows rampant in Africa. They 
supposedly contain just about *everything* anyone would ever need to
survive on (in terms of nutrients and such), and was being seriously
considered as an alternative food source in many 3rd-world countries,
where it can be grown quick and cheap.  The only problem is...
it smells *AWFUL*.  ;)  I mean *real* nasty.  Odwalla covers it up real
nice with the fruit flavors, though.
Okay, enough useless factoid-ish stuff...  Have a fantastic Valentine's
day, folks!  Hope to see some of you at the Pro-Soy event this weekend; I
love you all (even if I don't have my own Valentine this year)-

I _WILL NOT_ miss...
Saturday night Im going to put my faith in the South Bay scene
(_Euphonic Genesis_).  Sunday is the Grand opening of KING KONG so it's
gonna be a grand weekend.  

And with all the luvin in the air???  Who knows what can happen?

I chose to stop subscribing to the sfraves mailing list, about
three weeks ago, after being on it for 3 of the last 4 years.

But this morning, when I read my sf-raves-calendar that had come in
last night, it triggered a memory that was just too STRONG, & I felt
I just had to get back on here and post:

** From this week's SFRAVES calendar:

>Friday, February 14th - Nomad Interactive presents _Splish Valentine's
>   midnight cruise_
>   An intimate Valentine's midnight cruise on SF Bay with the masters
>   of house   Doc Martin, Jeno.
>   Aqua ambience funk deck with His Boy Elroy and surprise guests.
>   Will take place on a luxurious multi-level all-weather yacht.
>   Presale tix only, available for $25 from Housewares.
>   415.675.5605 415.273.5850 408.236.3398 916.484.4213>

Help me remember this, any of you who were there, and correct me if
I'm wrong, but wasn't Nomad Interactive the people, a couple
years back, who advertised a SF Bay cruise party, then had the
following problems:

* boat didn't leave until way after midnight - people gathering in a
huge line freezing, since before 11:00 PM on....being cajoled & cajoled
into waiting, without being given any reason why..."we're still getting
things ready, we PROMISE we're almost done getting things ready"....
finally, near 1 AM, a Rydr truck screeches up to the dock, its back doors
are flung open, and two guys tumble out with a big GENERATOR....

* they take the $20 at the ramp to get on the boat - then everyone hurrying
downstairs to a ????? buffet where a dinner of  ?????????? chicken wings
????????? and rice ??????????? was laid out, people devouring "free"
chicken wings manically....

* on the "main" dance floor, there's tables & chairs _everywhere_,
the dance floor measures about 20x15, and NO ONE will let you push back
any tables and chairs to dance....

* main sound system is terrible, muffled...but with Tracy, still
doing a great job putting her songs together, even with the system she
had...

* boat is now smelling like CHICKEN....

* an ambient area was advertised, I remember discussion on sfraves
about how Rick's girlfriend was really looking forward to that, as she
was writing a paper on ambient spaces at raves - they never set it up,
never brought the sound system...

* one and a half hour into it, the boat turns back, and  - DOCKS!
the lights come on a bit, & it's like we're in a floating
Denny's...we're done with the water portion of this ride...

* boat is now smelling like sweaty CHICKEN...

* the lights stay on low, sound system goes down a bit - but it's
not over, no, we're invited to stay - as boat crew members start to
walk around, cleaning up - they open up the doors, a gentle cold
breeze blows in....official crew members in snappy white military yacht
dress begin to stroll back & forth on the dock, some 10 feet outside
the main dance floor's windows.....

* Ti-Fred & I are just sitting, perplexed, then laughing, looking
at each other - THEN Garth throws on "Rockit"  - and we are
SO out of there....


Do I have this story right???  If so, looks to me like they're
doing it again, this time for 5 more bucks a head, and covering
themselves a bit more in the ad:  "will take place on"
a multi-level....yacht.

"Tempts me to join SFR again, just so i can go on & make this post!
There are some people out there who may be kind of new, and may not know
this little bit of history," I said to my friend Ti-Fred.

He said, "oooohh....you should post it...!"  So I did.

Hi to everybody who remembers me & Ti-Fred !

Hey,

Sometimes it's appropriate to throw down old skool tracks.  Just like
the "It's Time" jam @ the Gateway party NYE on the stroke of midnite.

Well, of course nothing's WRONG with Rockit, in & of itself...
it just made too classic of an ending to that night!

Too much nostalgia in too cheesy of a setting - I just HAD to
renounce something like that!

Dear friends,

	I just wanted to wish everybody the most wonderfull of all valentines days, and a glorious 
weekend.  The weather is beatiful, and its a wonderfull time to be alive.

	This weekend is, in my opinion, the "make-up" for New Years Eve Weekend.  It is the weekend 
that New Years was suposed to be.  There are so many wonderful and positive events going on , and 
there is so much positive spirit in the air.  I hope every body has a wonderfull weekend no matter 
what you end up doing.  I hope to have a chance to see you all at Love A-Fair tomorow, but if you 
do not make it out, I hope you have a great time at which ever party you decide to go to.

	Have a wonderfull weekend, and Spread the Love.

Keep It Real

Ray Vonie

Hello everyone!

	Just wanted to say whatever you do tonight, I hope you all have an
oustanding Valentine's Day celebration :)  I'll miss everyone, as I'm
battling a sinus infection (sound familiar?), and it's tough when you have
no medical insurance...enough of that.
	This day is in honor of romantic love, so I encourage everyone to
open their hearts completely to each other, love and appreciate each other,
and remember that we either hang together or we hang separately!  My love
goes with each and every one of you, now and always.  I hope that my
projection of love and positive energy today and tonight will somehow be
felt, however subtle, and will help to supercharge the occasion for
everyone.  I predict an extra-tasty vibe tonight :)
Peace & pass the tissue,
Eric

The party below did happen, but I can't be sure if it was Nomad Interactive.
I thought it was the people from Ameba on Haight, but to tell you the truth,
I don't remember.

Yes, this happened.

Yes, this happened.  The rice was pretty good though....or maybe I was just
really hungry after waiting two hours on a cold dock.

Yes.

I believe it was Wicked sound.  I didn't notice anything wrong with it myself.

Yes...Yuck!!

This part is incorrect.  They had an "ambient" area with a sound system, but
they never really played ambient music.  I can remember hearing some disco
though.  About an hour into the trip, they turned the lights on and took
down all the psychedelic wallhangings and visuals....probably because they
were worried that people were going behind the tarps and gettin 420'd.

Yep.

Yep.

Yep, somthing like that.

We left around then too.

Someone's doin it again, but I'm not sure if these are the same people.

:   I will simply say that an event like this cannot go down, truly
: representing raves, without allowing each and everyone one of us to do what
: we want. 

	First of all, they're right about the heat & the weather. 
I've been there. It will be at least in the 90's & *very* humid.

	Second of all, this sounds like it's about a political 
action, not just about having a good time. It's about getting 
results. 

	Way back in 68, there were a bunch of hippies who 
wanted to see Eugene McCarthy get the Democratic Presidential
nomination, because they felt he sincerely wanted to end the 
Vietnam war. They cut their hair & cut out the drug use so they 
could function effectively as political activists. It was called
getting "clean for Gene". 

	Now, I suggest that if all you want to do is party, 
don't go to this thing. This is about political activism for
rave tolerance - we have to show raving's *best* side. Part of
this thing is public relations.

	If you want to fight for drug legalization, that's a
*different* political action. And I doubt that the best way to
fight for that would be a drug-in on the White House lawn anyway.

     Peeps,

     be leaving from Alameda & to check the vm. It has no info on boarding 
     point so whats up ? Anybody have the 411 on this ??
     
     Also, gotta' larf - some fellow Chironite scrawled the hyperreal URL 
     as graffitti in our pissoirs. Now that's mainstream !! Intrigued, I 
     tried a Who SFRaves but apparently that command has been disabled. 
     Come say hello if you're out there !!

Interesting idea, but can we have specifics? When is this thing going to 
happen? Organised by who? What? I'll go, I'll stay sober. But you guys 
have to tell me when it is?????

Some of you might remember that I posted a while back, asking for help in
preparing my mother for her first rave.  I'd like to thank everyone for
their responses.  It helped a lot.

I ended up reading a lot of the responses to my mom.  I also had many
long talks with her about drugs.  I made a tape of all my friends talking
about their first rave, their first time on e, what the rave scene means
to them, etcetera.  My mom and I have listened to most of it already.

As a result, I think my mom will have some fun (unfortunately, she hates
techno) and I don't think she'll die of shock at her first party.

So, tomorrow night, my mother will be attending Euphonic Genesis in San
Jose.  I'm helping throw this party, so I'm gonna try to convince her to
come early and watch us set up.  I want her to see how much energy and
love goes into throwing a party.

If you're not already going to one of those big parties in The City, try
to come to Euphonic Genesis and meet my mom.  Trust me, it's worth it. 
My mom's a stud!  She's pretty, too.  And single!!!!  Any 40-somethingers
out there looking for a hot 40-something babe?  Come meet Libby's mom!

And, if you don't know me yet, you can meet me too!

Okay. I have no choice but to share this.

I got the April issue of Games Magazine in the mail today, and while
thumbing through it came upon an article about a certain puzzle.  It's a
sphere that breaks into eight pieces that you have to reassemble.  The
catch?

It's invisible.  100%.  I'm not kidding.

In a word, bad-ass.

Unfortunately, I haven't found any place yet that stocks them.  If anyone
ever sees one in the Bay Area (or mail order), please, pleeeeeze let me
know.

Yep, I guess it sucks that your parents didn't have you earlier than 1976 
					huh?

But on a side note, I forgot to add, that my friend who looks like Alicia 
Silverstone turned 21 back earlier this month, and when *she* went to 
1015, they still didn't think she was the person on her driver's 
license.  Too bad for her for looking young huh?

Um, if it's invisible, how will I see it??  They could have thousands of
them in stock and no one would ever know!  On the other hand, this could
be the easiest item to shoplift in the history of retail sales.  What
are they gonna do?  Frisk everyone at the door and see if the feel
something they can't see?

On the other hand, they'd be a lot of fun at raves.  Go up to someone
who's obviously tweaking, put it in their hands, and say, "Hey, keep an
eye on this for a moment, ok?"

On a related note, there was a famous ad placed in some classified
section of some paper somewhere which read:

	DON'T MISS OUT - SEND YOUR DOLLAR NOW
	
and listed a p.o. box number.  That's all it said.  the guy who did this
made a few thousand dollars, I believe.  Dunno the rest of the story, tho.

you might want to check the carbo content on that.  it's way high for 
superfood and all of the odwalla products.  not that odwalla products are 
bad, i've certainly loved the fact they are around.  

but when you take a lot of carbos in it's a good idea to find some 
source of fat to curb the carb (which is a form of sugar) intake.  

gotta go...deep

Attention Dance Producers and DJs

I have several pieces of studio gear for sale. All the equipment was bought
new, and has only seen use in my home studio.

Yamaha TX16W Stereo Sampler: Rack mount 12 bit sampler with great chunky
sound (brilliant for drums). 8 individual outs + stereo out, memory
expanded to 6 MEGS, includes all updated system software, three sets of
sound libraries (2 limited European sets), and my own collection of samples
made over four years. $500 obo

Kawai 16 input line mixer: 8 stereo channels/16 input line/keyboard mixer.
Each channel has 2 auxillary sends, pan, fader volume. 2 mic inputs,
low/med/high output switches. Very high sound quality, very quiet. Great as
a submixer for keyboards or sampler outputs, also good for digital
mastering. $300 obo

Roland D110 Synthesizer: Rack mount, multi-timbral synth. Uses PCM samples
and digital synthesis. 6 individual outs + stereo outs. Great sounds. With
additional sound card (Analogue Synth Sounds -awesome!) LCD display has
characters out, so needs light service, hence cheap price. $200 obo

Anyone who's interested in any of the above, should e-mail me here, or call
me @ xlr8r 415/861.7583

ALSO,

I'm clearing out about 4 or 5 crates of my record collection, I need the room.
Mostly HOUSE, ranging from some classic Chicago and NY stuff, good unusual
garage, some older imports, lots of solid workable uncommon house records
(mostly priced @ $2), a small amount of techno/experimental, some soul and
disco and the odd rarity. I'm still pulling stuff, but anyone who might be
interested should e-mail me, and I'll let you know when things are ready.

Respect
Andrew

there are 2 rekkids out on Skint right now with this sample:
"Go Off" by Midfield General 
and
"Two Turntables and a Box of Skint" by Bassbin Twins

happy hunting.

Or you could just pick up the new Uncle Noah tape "Cycle Information" and
listen to "Go Off" on side 1

I disagree.  The use of drugs is probably the number one problems folks
have with raves - at least it's the aspect the news shows focus on the
most.  Pretending that that aspect doesn't exist, or that it can be
separated from "raving", wouldn't be a credible statement for these folks.

Happy Saturday morning SFravers!

My friend, who has just come out of the Army (said he didn't learn very 
much!), is very interested in acquiring some 1200's.  He will be looking 
around the want ads\classifieds, while enlisting me to help him find some 
Technics through this list.  If anyone knows\wants someone to get rid of 
his\her tables please *privately post* me back with more pertinent info.
	Paying the Good Guys $549.00 each (plus no needles) goes pretty 
			deep into the pocketbook doesn't it?

				Peace! B

Splish started off just like the last one...but got worse. Some guy
jumped off into the Bay and a security person jumped in after him. I
think they found the security person but not the person who jumped.

They're around $550 or $600 at Leo's Pro Audio in Oak-town. However =
they were all out when I dropped by last week. I just heard an FOAF =
rumor about poor build quality. It's a shame too; 'cuz Blues are =
fucking cool.

1200s are on sale at Guitar Centre for $499; however if you're good, =
you can weasle them down even farther. The price that they quote you =
when you walk in is bullshit. If you push hard enough you can get =
them way down. Six months ago I got Guitar Centre to match an LA =
stores price of $450. Just last night I used the 6 month old reciept =
from GC to Weasel K&K down. Gawd I love that new equipment smell.

You got it exactly right. It was Nomad Interactive.

They "monitor" SF Raves, but only speak when severely flamed. They know better.

I will say no more... :-)

I heard this too, this morning.  I have heard that the City is suing 
Stacy of Nomad Interactive because of the person who jumped overboard 
(due to OD'ing I also heard).  I am just repeating rumors heard from 
someone else.  I would really like to know what actually happened from 
someone who was there....

The scene IS changing, which is why I am much MUCH **MUCH** more 
selective in the events I attend.  So I guess that for me, not much has 
changed in how I am respected as a female at a rave, because I simply 
attend the parties where the people that go respect EVERYONE.

I'm not sure what you believed when you receieved the mail, but anarch is 
right, it is fake.  And I don't know if someone sending fakemail earns 
the title Hacker, since it *very* easy to send mail that appears to be 
from another address.  It was probably someone you know... maybe someone 
you pissed off...

Yes, Superfood is good shit.  Although I go with straight spirulina, which
will propel you for a long time, with no wiry-ness like a lot of 'stimulants',
since it's basically just (vegetaable) protein and vitamins.  Being a rock-
climber, I disagree, I think Powerbars are much more effective that Clif Bars,
myself.  I find a tablespoon of Spirulina powder, mixed in some liquid, and one
powerbar, and i can crank stone like a fiend, or dance for hours.  Initially
after ingestion, however, you may feel a little sleepy for .5-1.0 hours, whill
you assimilate the substances.

Hi Everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love -A-Fair was DaBombbbbbbbbbbbb......

I had soooo muchhhhh funnnnn!!!!!! :) The vibe was pretty good, not like
the
usual HomeBase party vibe, the decorations were Amazzzingg! The people were
Extra Nice, the candy extra sweet and everything was just good :) 

Thank you so much to Lara, Stariana, Rhona, Ryan, Ace (you rule!),
Fernando, Eric,
extra Special thanKs to Jason :) who else? that cool girl with the leopard
pants who showed me the slinky [sp?] trick, Lara's friends from Sonoma, and
that other guy I met at the Karma party... (I can't remember! I can't
remember! was it Eric?)  and not to forget Alex :o) and everyone else that
was there who helped the vibe! :)

I had a greeaaattt Time! :o)

Best parts of the night:
* They turned the lights on and the music off around midnight, but our vibe
kept
  going and we made our own music! then the lights went out again and the
music
  started playing again... It was just something you'd have to have been
there to 
  really understand! ;o)

* Johnathan was spinning good stuff (even though I didn't stay there for
*that* long)
  I specially liked the GrassMonkey tune ;O) or is that BrassMonkey? either
way...it 
  was rad! :o)

* Hanging out with everyone! :o)


Worst parts of the night:
* hummm... was there a fight or something?

Overall, this party 'PHAT' :o)

PlUr PlUR PlUR Plur!
Pab

those substances would probably be the carbohydrates.  if im not mistaken 
it contains like 68g of carbos, which makes it a yummy but unbalanced 
food.  all that needs to be done though is to add fat to slow down the 
sugar (carbo) intake and protein (to build muscle and burn fat).  

might want to try mixing the superfood with some more protein powder and 
some soy milk (adding fat and protein)...then it would be able to last 
LONGER, could almost 2 or three servings spread out through the night or 
a ritual drink with 3 people.  

mmm...you guyz are making me thirsty!

so...which one was better?  

yeah, i'll bet you would like to know that!  =]

Deepfog Itinerary---

800 pm...all is well at da home base.  

915 pm...the first deepfog set starts after many rude interruptions by 
the plug strip/circuit breakers.  Great work from the electrical folx and 
Sean Murray.  

1045pm...the first deepfog set comes to an end...and he is informed that 
he'll also be CLOSING the room too (500-630 am) since bv dub got caught 
in an electrical storm or somethin...oh well, i don't mind driving!

1145 pm...arriving at the tekno love children, which is stationed at the 
secret rebel base.  skaters doin their grindy thing across the street.  a 
mysteriously funny curly topped dude busts out these glo-sticks to hand 
them out with the "Warmth" flyers (no purchase necessary must be 
open-minded to 
play)...420...talk...dance...420...talk...dance...420...ohp!  time to 
go!  

300 am...the shuttle pod 'el-baz' departs for starbase 23 so the fog can 
get some more rekkids...

420 am...no sorry kids, nothing exciting at this time.  on the road to 
the home base again after a yummy 
vegan-organic-fat-free-zippo-zippo-breakfast-burrito!  

503 am...entering the home base...the b((m (he always comes back to ya!)  
finishes his set with some fat-ass rekkid that i must have completely 
missed out on a few years ago...

630 am...set ends...off to an uncharted planet...hung out with 3 really 
cool people.  

830 am...at Andronico's in Berkeley...trying to find some of that yummy 
meuslix again...

930 am...after trying to find some street in Berkeley which apparently 
doesn't exist in the Berkeley map...now arriving at the secret rebel base 
to rendevous with a friend to give them a ride...always glad to help!

NOW...14 swedish pancakes later, i get to tell you which party was 
better.  the answer?  well, maybe i'll tell you later.  

nah.  i'll tell you.  

the answer is...they were both excellent parties, well decorated and well 
thought out.  one of them had too mmany people or was too hot, though, 
and the other was a little less personal because it was big.  big doesn't 
necessarily mean bad, though, and we did find some fans to turn on at the 
other event.  but be careful about packin in so many.  

but in my opinion, they were both great parties.  deep

My friends and I tried to go to Love-affair.  We got there at about 11:30
and couldn't find parking until about a quarter mile away.  While walking
there, many people were walking the other direction and saying that it was
going to be shut down within an hour.  Did it close down?  We took their
work and took off.  I also hear from another guy that there was a bomb
threat.  So what's the right story?

 The party went all night.. 
 I heard about the bomb..  It was probably just some people talking about
how bomb the party was. And some dood on Acid just took it all out of
context. Or something.
 I myself, was not tripping off no bombs.. I just didn't want the party to
get busted.  It's usually all over once them lights come on.
 Fat, Dope, tight ass party. Although, the music never seemed to peak. But
shi, I was probably just E'in to hard. And my legs, my legs were dead.  I
could only dance for like 5 minutes, then it was time to take another 30
minute nap. Hopefully my second wind will kick in tonight at Spundae's!
 My friend Tim lost his wallet at Love Affair...  So if anyone knows
anything about that..  He would like to hear from you..   You could page
him @ 510.607.0223. He is pretty depressed about not having no ID to get
into Spunfreaks tonight.
 Anyways..  I had fun.. I was not suprized at all.  I knew the night would
turn out as it did. I am used to it...

Just call me Mr Unapproachable.

Matthew Wietzke

I showed up at 10:00 in a fidgety panic, in fear of missing my set; found
out I wasn't due on until 3:00; and decided to take a nap in the chill room
under the REMguidance of Deepfog's mellofunky. Woke up at 11:00 to the sound
of grinding guitars and crashing snares, the kind of music you might expect
of the Jesus & Mary Chain after a weekend K bender..

What's this?   A rock and roll band in the the chill room?  Catsup on my
eggs? CD's in my tapedeck?  Muslims in my Israel?  C'est bizarre.  It was a
bit disconcerting, just because I've never seen anything of the sort before.
It certainly wasn't /chill/, but then again, chill rooms ain't what they
used to be.  That kind of got me to thinking about organizers like Feelgood
& CoolWorld among others, who sort of have a different vision of parties...a
bit more eclectic, not strictly  limited to the conventional
techno-in-one-room and ambient-in-the-other.  Sort of more like just a big
"party" with a focus on the rave but not limited to just that.  It's weird
only because it's unexpected.

There was a bit of disco in the back-back-back room, which I thought was a
bit refreshing; kind of takes the edge off of things, you know?

I think the confusion abouth the bomb was that someone called up Ray Vonie
and said, "JondaBomb is going to be tearing shit up tonight."  Then,
naturally, Mr. Vonie wanted to know where Jonathan daBombathan was: did he
have his records, and enough water and cigarettes to get him through his
set?  No one could find Jonathan, so they had to turn on the lights and off
the music,  shouting, "Jonathan!  Where's JondaBomb?"  Finally they found
him huddled in the corner in an abandoned knapsack, and from what I heard,
Jondabomb delivered an explosive set.  But then again, this is just what I
heard.  Things ain't alway what you hear.

Of all the parties Ive had to miss over the past four years of raving I
feel I missed the most by missing this party last night.  I'm from Seattle
and _love_ Donald Glaude... If I would have known he was spinning there I
would have gone way *way* out of my way to make sure I could get there...
Treasure cool times like last night and don't forget them!  Never take the
good times for granted :)  sigh.  Hrm.  I'm going to Spundae tonight,
nothing stopping me :)  maybe I'll see you guys there?

Cybertribe,

What's up?  I moved out to SF in October, and was fortunate enough to meet
John Kowamoto (another SFraves member) who was looking for a roommate here
in San Francisco.  I moved in in December along with one of John's
co-workers at Excite.  Our three month lease is up at the end of this
month, but my roommate Gunter and I want to stay on for another year.
John will be buying a place of his own.

We're looking for a roommate to share our awesome apartment near
Japantown.  It's at 66 Cleary Court, right off Laguna and Geary.  It's a
three bedroom condo on the 7th floor of a fifteen story high-rise.  There
are two bathrooms, open kitchen, dishwasher, washer, dryer, tons of closet
space, balconies off every room.  There's even a doorman and two
elevators.  There's always parking in front of the building.

Gunter and I both work down in Mountain View and commute back and forth
every day.  I work as a software developer and DJ and produce music as
well.  If you've got good credit, can commit to a year lease and can
afford $600 a month, give me a call or send me e-mail.  We'll set up a
time for you to come by.  The number here is: 415.928.7901.

peace and love,
Marshal "Mars" Villarosa

Hello everybody!

I must say that Vlad has again created something awesome. I could have
listened to Seany-Boy for milleniums. I'm looking forward to the next
party with this master of the mix.

I was in the Heartbeat chamber and got a chance to meet Vlad. That was
killer and I got a laminate...

I'm still feeling the effects.....

Too bad about the deaths on the cruise...

There was no bomb threat, where did you hear that?

Let me explain....   I killed Crunchman.   That legion is not passe and I
now like to be Called Johnny D.   And that will soon be my DJ name.

I think it's time I shed that identity.....   Although I will keep the
Crunchman WEB page up for a little while longer,  so if you haven't read it
yet,   now is the time to visit it.

http://www.well.com/user/crunch

Now,   I think I will be driving a U-haul up to SF for a friend who has
no license.   This puts me in SF this coming weekend.    I want you all
to meet the new Johnny D..    Plus I want to go to the most PLUR'ey
party this coming weekend.

One other thing,   I no longer do any "Energy work",  only Crunchman

(This was written by Mark, not Amy)

well well well . Another smashing party of social macrocosms and techno 
insanity at Club homebase.whats this about a damn bomb threat?
the only people who would do such a thing would be F.G.E's competitiors 
and we all died last night , who would go to their raves? A hollow ploy.
Ive never been to a party that large before that actually held a tangible 
vibe besides the gathering. it must have had a lot to do with the 
Valentine factor. It was nice to see Lil' Ricky spinning along with the 
rest of the Fremont heads gathered round.Nothing kicks my ass more than 
that main room:700+ Heads,Tony rockin' us to the next dimension of 
musical consciousness,the neon figures dancing in the distance and the 
commeraderie of everyone ex'ed out of their minds. it was beuitiful.
	still, one complaint. When are these greedy fools going to 
release us from the water monopoly they have us under? No water aloud in, 
no faucets,and 2 dollars to buy what would cost us about 2 cents by 
turning on the faucet in our kitchen sink.It is almost evil what they are 
doing. Everyone needs water. Especially in a place where they have to 
remain for 12 hours of dancing, sweating, Eing,Frying,and mass socializing?
A guy who has just enough money to pay the ridiculous price of 25 dollars 
to get in might not have any more for water. So is he just fucked? Pretty 
much.
			
	sincerly, Mark the raveslave.

I think anyone who intends to throw a party, or is interested in some
authorities point of view would do well to read Lotus (v.1 iss.7).  There;s
a really good interview with the LA Fire Dept in there, that really spells
out a lot of stuff.  Safety, Legal, Permitting, type issues, and what happened
on NYE in LA.  There's also coverage of the whole NYE scene, busts, etc.. with
a lot of details.

Good stuff.  Thanks to the people at Lotus!

hugs,
Bruce

Two things, It is foolish to believe that drug use can be seperated from
rave culture.  But most drug use is illegal.  That said, people have to
decide what they want to accomplish.  In the civil rights movements of the
60's people made
a conscious choice to break or disregard certain laws, because they felt
that they were wrong, they realized the consequences and were willing to go
to jail for them.  Many of the drugs that raver are associated with carry
_very sever_
mandatory penalties for their possession and use, this is not something to
be taken lightly.  Drugs like Pot and Nitrous may be considered more
recreational and while I personally believe that all drugs should be
legalized my question is how will open drug use at an event like this best
forward this cause?
Traditionally, groups that hae come to Washington (African American Civil
Rights Movement in the 60's, American Indian Civil Rights Movement in the
70's,
Vietnam Peace Movement in the 70's, Million Man March in the 90's) Have all
been peaceful, but forcefull demonstrations where the participants are on
display for the world.  What message will be show the world if as a speaker
is talking, the shhhhhIIIIISSSHHHHHH! of a nitrous tank can be heard in the
background, or if three young people have to go to the emergency because
they took too much GHB?  I think it's well within the boundaries of the
organizers of such an event to request that people abstain from the use of
illegal substances for the duration of the demonstration/celebration.
After all, it's
only a few hours and you have the rest of eternity to Rave and take drugs,
if that's your thing.  Besides, there will be hella kool after-parties :)

As dark and morbid as some of these poems may be, they were a release
for me during a difficult time in my life. Some of you wanted me to post
another so here it is. Have a delicious day! Peace n Love Erik!

Tic...Toc...

The strongest of men,
not one, and not ten,
can hinder the hands of a clock.
With each passing day,
the hours they weigh,
as a chain round the neck with a rock.
No manner of coin,
no ally you join,
will waylay the dawn from its breaking.
And when all's said and done,
there is nowhere to run,
the morning of that final awakening.
Yet immortal we feel,
and made up of steel
we pretend to not see the rust.
Which gnaws us away,
with each passing day.
It's there....on that you may trust.
So color your hair.
Lift your face if they stare	
at the signs of your oncoming night.
And deny your mortality,
the one TRUE reality.
It is there...if just out of sight.

hello, a couple friends and i are visiting san fran during spring break 
(march20-30) and we're looking for cool things to do in and around the 
city.  i'd greatly appreciate it if somebody could tell me about good
parties that week (especially jungle parties), what the clubs are 
like(we're all 18 or 19 so we can't get into 21+), and/or neat places to go 
and hang out(not necessarily techno-related). 
plur,
 -tom

Yes there was a bomb threat as far as I know.  Security was searching through 
garbage cans, behind all the buildings, all over.  Somebody doesn't like the 
promoters at Feel Good Entertainment I guess.  The question I have is:  what 
happened that caused the fire truck, the ambulance, and the 2 or 3 cop cars to 
all show up while I was driving away at 3:30?  Oh, and why was Charlotte (The 
Baroness) scheduled to spin from 5:30 - 7:00 AM?  I was really looking forward 
to her set, but I wasn't about to stay at that size of party for so long.  I 
was happy to hear Deepfog spin, and in the main room Andre Lucero(sp?) and 
Thomas Michael laid down some *intense* tracks.   
 
I introduced myself to a few of you, by the laser, but I didn't catch names 
very well being right next to those speakers and all.  I was the guy in the 
grey long-sleeved shirt, shaved head and glasses.  Say hello again if we met!  
Great evening!  Thanks.

Saturday night was tha BOMB! It's the first time in a few years that I went
to 2 raves in one night and my first time partying with Deepfog. What's up
Deep? The first party, "Love A-fair," was huge. Massives are cool, but
there's usually that good old gangster element around that brings a bad
vibe with it. The place was awesome though. You should've seen the
decorations and special effects and all the other cool stuff. There were
about 5 or 6 DJs spinning different shit in different rooms at the same
time. In one room, there were 2 DJs spinning at the same time on 4
turntables. I love that shit! That was fucking awesome to watch. We stayed
at the first party from about 8 pm (before the party even started) unitl
around 11 pm, when we took off for party #2, Techno Love Children.

TLC was way smaller but WAY Phatter! The vibe was phenomenal (sp?)! We got
into the place and my body just started to move. I couldn't even help
myself. By this time, my E was making me feel really goooood, so I danced
my ass off to the hardcore shit that was being spun. My only complaint
about the location is that the dance room was Oh Sooo Fucking HoT! I swear,
it was about 120=B0 in the room, and if you started dancing, it only took
about a second to feel sweat dripping down your face. When it came to
dancing though, I couldn't help myself because it was sick-ass track after
sick-ass track, so I only left the dance floor when I was severely over
heated. When 3 am came I didn't want to leave, but it was time cuz one of
my friends had to go home to his woman, so I reluctantly stepped outside
the building where the party was and cooled off. Luckily, there were some
sick ass skaters skating the BART station across the street. It made me
wish I had my skate, but it was cool just to watch them.

What's up for next weekend?

Ivan

Hey Bionic...my apologies to you and all the other kids that headed for the
beach and did not find us. We had some trouble with the authorities and
also with location at the last minute. It was a real shame due to the great
weather.

We are going to try this again in the spring and try and get permits etc.
Its funny how hard it is in this country of free speech etc. to just set up
a few speakers and dance to music outside in the sun.

Stay tuned - we will return....

* Meri *

PS.... thanks to Macadio for his effort and good vibes....

Are you out there?  

I'd still be asleep if I didn't hafta work today either....

Anyways, the subject tells it all.  Yes I was out and about this
weekend, Yes there were some terrific parties.  Yes, I'm sooo sorry to
hear about the 'incident' regarding the boat thang. But lets get to
reviewing..

Friday:  Didn't make it to D-7 for that Trance thang (_Infinite One_)
just because if I did I'd possibly be another fatality on V-day as well.
 So I chilled it @ the mappoint buyin' wrekkads & talking to Dhrien a
bit about future parties in the Santa Cruz area. Im soo hyped about
seeing this scene flourish again in other areas of the bay (but more on
that later).  Got home early (1:45) and slept.

Saturday:  Had a nice day @ the beach, waiting, sitting, looking....
Something, anything... But nothing in regards to seeing anything on this
thing about something in regards to that trainwreck-thing.  Oh well.  We
(myself and a few other partygoers I found on the beach) spent the
remainder of the day playing, "spot the raver" on the beach...

Went to F-8 later and chatted with MARS, saw some REAL promoter drama
(All the while im thinking that I'll soon be getting involved with these
kind of politics, uhg...).  But also caught up with 411 with the
many'o'DJ's about the boat partie, D-7,cancelled Trainwrecks (too bad no
one updated the VM#). and what was happening where tonite.  Ended up
going to...

_Euphonic Genesis_ in SJ.  Putting my faith in the South bay scene
(again).
It was a phat partie.  Not too many people for the space (large
warehouse /w multiple rooms) but a really, really nice vibe.  The
"gansta" element was nil (I actually felt pretty Ganstaish w/my black
and grey clothes and biege trenchcoat).  I saw Pengo (hey dude) and said
hi to (Matt?).  All though the music was nice and diverse, I stayed
pretty true to my word and really chilled more than dance.  Well,
actually every time a PD Cruser rolled by, the sound would almost cut
off... Which made it hard to dance (drum roll building, building,
BUILDING and then... Cut - volume drop - uhh. hmm.) .  So I pretty much
had a nice time zoning 420'ing and chillin...

Sunday: A friend calls from Cupertino, it's the afterparty for E.G. at
sone of the promoters house.  I called a few people to whom I was
suppoed to hook up with, Hmm they're out doing things with thier SO's I
guess.. So off I head, record bag in hand.
	A very VERY crazy E-party is going on as I get there.  People chilln on
the lawn, some nice domestic trance and breakbeat pumpin thru the
speakers.  Others dancing on the tables thru the kitcken.  Mucho 420 and
other E-partie consumeables.  Nice lil DJ setup. I kickit, chatting with
some of the _EU_ promoters compleminting them on a fine job.  party gets
crazier and zanyer but a lot of fun.  Everyone pretty much packs ut up
and carries to a small office space in Sunnyvale.  Drop by for a few
hours and let one of the promoters spin on my decks (everyone wants to
be a DJ, and personally,I think that's a good thing.).  I jump on for a
bit to express my style and several hard tracks later I give the tables
back.  
Everything winds well into midnite when I remember that Im supposed to
be here (@ work ) by 8.  ugh.  I hate Mondays. 

I really have to say that I feel that the south bay has promise.  SJ in
97' seems like SF in 94': lil' intimate parties, E-parties.  The fuse is
lit.  A new crew relocating in Santa Cruz.  A bunch of Rebels in the
SoBay plotting and planning.  A new trance store on the horizon in SJ.
The time is coming, the seeds are spreading.

"Stay Connected"

---Adam

Throw the party at 4 mile or Panther. Less chance of a bust if you don't
have permits I heard.

Yeah, this ActiveX crap is just the tip of the iceberg. And people
shouldn't be getting all dreamy in the shorts about Java either. Cool
thing, crappiest UI toolkit I've ever seen, and nothing revolutionary about
it other than good marketing for a ho-hum language. Unfortunately, it's
really no more secure than anything else once embedded into Netscape,
especially if someone wasn't real careful w/ LiveConnect extensions in your
browser installation. Nonetheless, given its widespread usage/adoption, it
will eventually get there and give us some cool new toys. I'm certainly
planning on working on it... but quite frankly, I would trust Java applets
more if there were a half-decent public domain browser using it, so the
source could be "peer reviewed" by computer scientists and hobbyists
worldwide. "peer review" is one of the main reasons why I trust Linux as an
OS...

The post I'm forwarding below is right-on w/r/t the overall problem of this
lemming-like industry that seems to be accepting and perpetrating shitware
from Microsoft. Like the author below, I too have spent untold hours
getting W95 to "behave" on my laptop, and often the only reason why I don't
have to do the usual wipe-filesystem-and-reinstall is that I can manipulate
my entire MSDOS/Win95 filesystem from Linux and use backup and directory
comparison scripts (e.g.
http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/scrnsnaps/dircmp.gif,
http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/examples/dircmp.lsp) I've written to
check for damaged stuff and suck the appropriate undamaged files off of a
backup tape.

I find it hard to imagine that Win95/NT is the operating system "for the
rest of us", given the lengths I've had to go in order to make it behave
(having about 12 years of professional software engineering experience,
having the ability to run the Linux OS on my laptop which allows me to fix
a damaged Win95 filesystem, and having the luxury of a daily DAT backup of
my systems). Now I'm not dissing the usefulness of certain apps built on
MS-Win (e.g. CakeWalk 5.0, Turbotax, various games and media apps that I
use) but it is amazing how brittle some of these apps become when built on
such a shaky foundation. And you wouldn't believe some of the crap software
developers have to go through in order to deliver windows apps. No wonder
people get computerphobic. Hell, I'm a computer scientist and Windows makes
me computerphobic....

Microsoft at Apogee 

by John Walker
http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/autofile.html 

This document is in the public domain.

It's been a heady week for Bill Gates. As Microsoft stock hit a new
all-time high, he was hailed on the front page of the International Herald
Tribune as the superstar of the World Economic Forum at Davos, eclipsing
mere heads of state, enthralling the audience with geeky details of how
Office 97 would fuse desktop, Internet, and Intranet into a seamless
whole. Afterward Bill was invited to a lengthy tete a tete with French
President Jacques Chirac, whose finance minister had, the week before, said
that Europe's economic crisis could best be solved by the emergence of one
or more "European Bill Gates".

What's a crusty contrarian to make of all this?

I think Microsoft have peaked. Do I subscribe to the fantasy that the Java
gang or US$500 network computers are going to displace Windows? That OS/2
will Warp into Number One? That Apple will become the NeXT de-facto
standard? That in a year or two disgusted Windows users will be lining up
to buy Linux? Of course not--I am a contrarian, not crazy. Microsoft's
rapid growth has been fueled by taking over more and more sectors of the PC
business and gaining effective control of standards so that, once the
engine is up to speed, competitors cannot keep up with Microsoft's
development and marketing capabilities. Nobody can outspend Microsoft, even
in a narrow sector, once Bill decides he wants to own it. Microsoft have
been able to dominate the sectors of the industry they deem strategic by
deliberate rapid change, often coordinated among multiple products. Since
no other vendor has similar control over operating systems, development
tools, and applications, Microsoft are alone in being able to do this.

It is now possible to discern the technological vision Microsoft have for
their customers in the years to come. It will be a COM-mediated world of
ActiveX (which, of course, will continue to be re-named once or twice a
year to embody whatever buzz word is on the tip of the industry's
collective tongue) components, flitting here and there across networks,
interacting in sophisticated and subtle ways with one another's methods,
accessing databases hither and yon and components everywhere with DCOM, all
under the benevolent supervision of an evolved NT which embraces objects in
its very kernel.

But this is complete bullshit, and it will never work, at least not very
well or for very long. Why? Because the underlying architecture lacks even
the most rudimentary security and configuration control mechanisms required
for a distributed system of such complexity. Academic and industrial
computer scientists have invested a great deal of effort into this problem,
and have come to understand at least some of the requirements. Microsoft
have none of them, and these are not things you can retrofit--at least not
without discarding one's entire investment to date and doing everything
over. Now, this is something Microsoft have been very willing to ask of
their customers, but there comes a time when the lost investment becomes so
great customers refuse to accept it. Do they bolt to another vendor? No,
they simply stop updating their systems, continue to use the software they
have which gets the job done quite well, thank you, and begin to bank the
productivity gains which come from *not* throwing everything out and
retraining users on something new every two years.

In the 1960's and 70's, many IBM 360/370 sites ran DOS for years and years
because it got the job done, and because the pain of "upgrading" to the
hardware requirements and the reprogramming required for OS/360 was simply
not something they could afford, nor did the benefits justify it. I think
we're reaching that point with Microsoft's PC software.

Anecdotal ground truth: in the last month, I have attempted to install
32-bit updates to three separate commercial Windows applications I have
been using for three years or more, each a best-seller in its market, all
bearing the Windows 95 logo, and claiming full compatibility with Windows
NT 4.0, which I am running. Three times I have failed to get the update to
work. In the most recent case, an update to the bank order-entry software I
use, which does nothing other than display forms and write files, modified
*thirty-seven* files in my C:\WINNT directory tree (without asking for
confirmation first), then crashed when attempting to import the database
from the previous version with a numeric error code from ODBC. Customer
support for problems like this in these enlightened times seems to have
converged onto the All Purpose Answer: "Reformat your hard drive, then
re-install Windows and all your applications".

I have a life which does not leave me adequate free time to play system
administrator, continually repairing damage inflicted by Microsoft. So, I
think I'll just stay with what I have, thanks. And I think I am not
alone.

When I look at Microsoft's current product line (which I avoid doing as
much as possible, I must confess), the problem is not that it lacks
features--God, most of it has way too many features for its own good, and I
suspect 90% of the users never discover nor use a majority of them--but
that it is bug-infested junk. What users need is not ActiveXYZ, the
NanoGenetic TransSpecies API, etc., etc., endless etc. but software which
works properly and does not crash. Jamming 1.5 megabytes of roach-motel
USER and GDI code into the kernel of NT 4.0 to "improve performance" shows
Microsoft lack the basic competence and/or willingness to provide a
reliable operating system.  And that has been a solved problem since the
1960's. Now they're going to sell us a global distributed component model
secure multi-platform multi-media object oriented operating system. Right.

I think we're approaching a pause, where the pain of staying on the
treadmill outweighs any possible benefit. I wish it were possible to
measure the pain, anguish, and lost productivity resulting from Windows
applications installing a mismatched set of DLLs in users' WINDOWS
directory. The distributed component world will be just like that, only
thousands of times worse. I think users will simply stay with what they
have, and Microsoft will be unable to push more down their throats.

When you consider how much the PC hardware industry has been driven by
upgrades needed to run new Microsoft releases, the consequences of this go
well beyond the software industry. Also, Microsoft's stock multiple
envisions growth continuing at the present rate. A mature market, where
sales plateau and product lines become stable, does not sustain a P/E
greater than 50. By comparison, Washington State's other near-monopoly,
Boeing, trades at 34 times earnings, and IBM at 14.

Absent a colossal strategic blunder (which is possible, but unlikely in the
extreme), I don't see Microsoft falling. But I think we'll soon experience
a kind of plateau in the PC world that resembles the mainframe business in
the 70's or minicomputers after DEC and Data General had staked out their
territory.

The technological frontier will not close, but it will be somewhere other
than the PC software business. In terms of my 1989 nanotechnology screed, I
think PC software is moving from the "Oh Wow"

http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_84_3.html 

to the "Oh Well" stage on the following page. Microsoft may succeed in
continuing to grow by diversification into media ventures and plush toys:

(http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/press/1997/feb97/actimate.htm), 

but will see revenues from PC software transition from exponential growth
to cyclical performance tracking the overall economy which is typical of
mature industries.

I'm certainly not about to run out and short a huge block of Microsoft
stock--momentum often carries a trend much further than rational
calculation justifies. But it will be interesting to observe how what
Microsoft have in the pipeline is accepted, and how the landscape of the PC
market will shift if and when users conclude, "Enough, already".

There is a simple solution to this problem.
Simply goto the Microsoft home page, download all the ActiveX controls. And
if you goto a WEB site that starts to install another ActiveX component,
Leave before it finishes.

Dear Friends:

	I would like to start of by extending a deep thank you to all the people who believed and 
came out to experience this event.   It was a wonderfull night and I honestly beliueve that this 
was one of the more incredible parties I have ever seen.  There was some intense energy created 
here.  

	This event was also able to raise some cash for the environmnet, how much is still to be 
seen.  When all the acounting is reconciled, we will post it on the list.  Untill then please 
keep your asumptions and speculations to yourself.

	I would also like to address some topics that have been brought up on the list.  I would 
like to coment about them before they get blown out of perspective.

The Bomb thing:
     Yes, at 11:30 the Oakland police department recieved a call from an individual that said 
that he placed a bomb of 36 sticks of dynamite in the facility and it was suposed to detonate 
sometimes between 12 and 1:30.  While talking to the police, the agreed with me that this was 
obviously a sabatoge tactic that was being used to shut down the party and they left it up to my 
discretion to act on it.  The police protocall on this was vage and unclear because they new as 
well as i did that this was just a bunch of BullShit.   
	However, when it comes to the safety of our guests, we do not take any chances.  I had my 
security check the groungs, the trash canns, the back packs in the coat check and we turned on 
the lights, and stoped the music to make an anouncement for everyone to look around and if they 
see something strange, th contact any of the security.
	At about 2 am, after the building was still there, the police told me agin that they 
recieved another bomb threat called into 911 from the same person from the payphone at a nearby 
gas station.  Neither the police or myself took this threat very serously.

That person:
	There was a person that was outside on the streets, telling a lot of you that the party 
was going to get shut down by 1 a.m.  We, and the police believe that this was the same person 
that was responsible for the bomb threat.  Our staff could not find the perpetrator, but 
multiple witnesses have given descriptions and the police have information from the phone calls, 
we are sure that justice will be served.  If any of you talked to this person, please contact 
me, if there is any information that you may have, It would be more than apreciated.  A lot of 
people worked very hard to put together this event, and it is a shame whan anyone for whatever 
reason takes it upon themselves to not only destroy something that was worked hard on, but to 
deprive people the opertunity to enjoy a good time with lies, desception ,and terorizm.  once 
again, If anyone has any infgormation, please contact me directly at my office @ 415-593-3664, 
and I promise I will keep our conversations stricly cofidential.  I am not trying to turn this 
into a manhunt, Karma always catches up to you, But I would like to find out why someone would 
be this way.  

The ambulence:
	Unlike most homebase parties, when the anmbulences number between 3-7 ocurences, we were 
fortunente to only have one out of 5000 people require a trip to the hospital.  This was even 
more astonishing when you aply the fact that most abulence trips are because of drug overdoses.  
This guy, had an epaleptic seizure, and it was apearently not drug related.  beacuse we have 
to call 911 for the ambulence, It is routine protocall for the fire truck to show up with the 
ambulences.  
	The guy who was taken away is dooing fine and the hospital informed us that they were 
relesing him that morning. 	
	It is a brath of fresh air to look back at an event of this size, that almost doubles the 
atendence of the average evets at this facility, and to realize that you had absolutely no drug 
realted ambulence rides, while other parties that have 2-3 thousand people are sending 3-4 
people to the hospital for drug overdoses.  Makes us feel good about our crowd, and the fact tha 
the message about partying responsibly and in moderation is getting through.		

Donald Gluade was also not at this party, we could not get him, he had prior arangements.

Also, DJ Carlos missed his flight out of chicago, so DJ melanie, pulled the set byherself, and 
had the bes set of her life.  Way to go Girl.

I acn't remenber if ther was anything else?

	Anyways, I just want to thank everyone agoin from the bottom of my heart for coming out 
and sharing your live and believing in us as well as yourself.  We are all here together, lets 
work together to make it as pleasant as posible.  Life is just to short for negative 
distractions from a positive course. 

	Our next party is going to be a little bit diferent then what we have done in the past.  I 
think you guys will particularly like it.  I will keep everyone updated.

Yesterday is history,
Tomorow is a mystery,
today is a gift,
Thats why it is called the "present"

Keep it real.

sometimes between 12 and 1:30.  While talking to the police, the agreed with me that this was 
obviously a sabatoge tactic that was being used to shut down the party and they left it up to my 
discretion to act on it.  The police protocall on this was vage and unclear because they new as 
well as i did that this was just a bunch of BullShit.   
	However, when it comes to the safety of our guests, we do not take any chances.  I had my 
security check the groungs, the trash canns, the back packs in the coat check and we turned on 
the lights, and stoped the music to make an anouncement for everyone to look around and if they 
see something strange, th contact any of the security.
	At about 2 am, after the building was still there, the police told me agin that they 
recieved another bomb threat called into 911 from the same person from the payphone at a nearby 
gas station.  Neither the police or myself took this threat very serously.

That person:
	There was a person that was outside on the streets, telling a lot of you that the party 
was going to get shut down by 1 a.m.  We, and the police believe that this was the same person 
that was responsible for the bomb threat.  Our staff could not find the perpetrator, but 
multiple witnesses have given descriptions and the police have information from the phone calls, 
we are sure that justice will be served.  If any of you talked to this person, please contact 
me, if there is any information that you may have, It would be more than apreciated.  A lot of 
people worked very hard to put together this event, and it is a shame whan anyone for whatever 
reason takes it upon themselves to not only destroy something that was worked hard on, but to 
deprive people the opertunity to enjoy a good time with lies, desception ,and terorizm.  once 
again, If anyone has any infgormation, please contact me directly at my office @ 415-593-3664, 
and I promise I will keep our conversations stricly cofidential.  I am not trying to turn this 
into a manhunt, Karma always catches up to you, But I would like to find out why someone would 
be this way.  

The ambulence:
	Unlike most homebase parties, when the anmbulences number between 3-7 ocurences, we were 
fortunente to only have one out of 5000 people require a trip to the hospital.  This was even 
more astonishing when you aply the fact that most abulence trips are because of drug overdoses.  
This guy, had an epaleptic seizure, and it was apearently not drug related.  beacuse we have 
to call 911 for the ambulence, It is routine protocall for the fire truck to show up with the 
ambulences.  
	The guy who was taken away is dooing fine and the hospital informed us that they were 
relesing him that morning. 	
	It is a brath of fresh air to look back at an event of this size, that almost doubles the 
atendence of the average evets at this facility, and to realize that you had absolutely no drug 
realted ambulence rides, while other parties that have 2-3 thousand people are sending 3-4 
people to the hospital for drug overdoses.  Makes us feel good about our crowd, and the fact tha 
the message about partying responsibly and in moderation is getting through.		

Donald Gluade was also not at this party, we could not get him, he had prior arangements.

Also, DJ Carlos missed his flight out of chicago, so DJ melanie, pulled the set byherself, and 
had the bes set of her life.  Way to go Girl.

I acn't remenber if ther was anything else?

	Anyways, I just want to thank everyone agoin from the bottom of my heart for coming out 
and sharing your live and believing in us as well as yourself.  We are all here together, lets 
work together to make it as pleasant as posible.  Life is just to short for negative 
distractions from a positive course. 

	Our next party is going to be a little bit diferent then what we have done in the past.  I 
think you guys will particularly like it.  I will keep everyone updated.

Yesterday is history,
Tomorow is a mystery,
today is a gift,
Thats why it is called the "present"

Keep it real.

Yes this was a a super cool rave. Great  job you guys. The visuals blew
me away. The music was sensational. Everyone was super cool. All my
friends were there. I had so much fun. I danced all night, even aftee my
E I did not stop. Great music. It didn't bothre me at all about having to
turn down the music for part of the rave because the vibe was so good.
And when it came back up that was terrific. I met so many people and had
just tons of fun. Great Vibe Great music Great Visuals.
I think that the most amazing thing was that it was actually in San Jose!
The cops knew we were there. They didn't break it up. We went on strong
all the way until the morining. I thought when i saw the cop outside, Oh
No, but when i got in. I said no way can this get broken up. The vibe is
way too strong. It didn't it went all the way until the morning!!! Super
cool. I really loved the location. It was big had rooms and planty of
space for everyone. The free fruit was great too. The smart drinks didn't
taste that great because they weren't sweet enough, but boy did they have
a lot of energy in them!!! I must have drank about 3 of them after my E
went away and i still felt the vibe afterwards. Plus i had so much
energy.
I guesss you can see that from my babbling that i had a great time!!!
Geez, I had so much fun i can't even describe. There's just too much to
say. I don't knwo what to say except that when is the next one???? I will
be there for sure.

You don't want protein and fat if you're going to be *dancing*, though!
You need easily-uptaken NRG; if you're moving around a lot, carbos seem
way better for you than proteins, (IMHO).  They digest quickly, last
longer than sugars, but kick in significantly faster than protein does.
Now the morning after, well that's a different story.  Then, I'd say pack
on lots of protein then so that your muscles can actually recover.  But
for the night, I think carbos will save you, balanced or not.

I know, technically.  But I was talking about the traditional longer-chain
polysaccharides (i.e. more than 3 rings involved) that I've always
assumed people mean when they're referring to "carbos", not just basic
sugars like sucrose or fructose.  Those 1-2 ringers get absorbed hella'
quick!  :)  (Hence the term sugar-high, as opposed to carbo-high...)
Okay, just wanted to add that in.  Peace and respect-

i totally trip out on Tim's style. at parties, people tend to take
themselves really seriouslly and have a good time ((sometimes myself
included)) or don't take themselves all that seriouslly and don't have a
good time ((sometimes myself included)). Tim doesn't seem to take himself
all that seriouslly and he seems to have a really good time and he
inspires the same in the people around him, which makes him unique. i
totally trip out on Tim's style.

I have to agree about the water situation.  While standing around a water
station that was being shut down around 4, myself and a few others were
ready to liberate crates of water to hand out to the masses.  None of us
seemed to have the courage of Robin Hood, though.  :)

All in all, there was an incredible spirit in the place and the music kept
me moving most of the nite until the body finally surrendered itself to the
floor.  The best moment had to be when the lights were turned off
accompanied by an explosion of music around midnight after that bit of
confusion.  It seemed to unite the rave and set the course of the night.
Don't know if it was intentional or not but it definately made me smile
anyway.

stompy -- double plus good thumbs up.
spundae -- double minus bad thumbs down.

Mark Farina, Derrick Carter and DJ Sneak ripped it up big time and I
was most pleased that the scene is still alive and that I didn't have
to drive all the way to Pittsburgh to hear some real dance music (i.e.
house music!)... Despite the potential sleaze-club vibe of the SF
Oasis, little was noticed, and it had the added benefits of the roof
that opens up to vent in a little fresh air. I was happy to hear
Derrick Carter spin a nice groovin' choon built off a simple loop from
the Fatback Band's '74 funk classic "Wicky Wacky" -- something that I
had tried and failed at a few years ago and is still waiting in the
bowels of my sampler, waiting to get out. (uh, i guess it helps if you
speed it up to 125 BPM)... The crowd was friendly, nice, good,
uplifted, and dancing hard w/ good vibe. I've come to expect this from
Stompy events, which is why I'm a return customer.... Hello to Sfravers
Sid, SunK, DougZ, and AndreL..

On the other hand, I attended Spundae for a few hours hoping to hear
Doc Martin and DJ Dan do some good stuff. Not! Perhaps it was just the
crowd of 20something-kawlich-whiteboys and same-looking-peninsula-chix
that made this thing a vibeless affair, maybe I was tired after
attending Stompy from 5:30-10:00PM. Or maybe it was the total lack of
oxygen and the  sweltering heat and pushy crowd of people desperate to
find the best place in the party, which couldn't be found 'cause the
party sucked. In either case, I found Doc Martin's set to be pretty
lackluster and boring, with a couple of interesting mixes here and
there, but a disappointing selection of what I thought of as "generic
LA club music." I've heard Doc do some great stuff in the past --
perhaps LA has gotten to him. I felt similarly about DJ Dan's set,
which was driving, but passionless/unfunky. I didn't have the patience
to wait for him to warm up cause I was sweating just standing still,
and dancing was making it rain, so I left and went to sleep.

Quite frankly, the only real vibe I saw at Spundae was happening
upstairs with DJ Julius Papp spinning the slower funky stuff.  People
were actually dancing with panache and having fun and letting loose,
and there was actually some semblance of a vibe. Downstairs in the
front room, The Hardkiss bros were spinning stuff I'd find interesting
on my stereo, but not that fun to dance to.

Perhaps spundae got better late in the evening as the "clubbers" and
the apparently fratboy/sorority-girl/peninsulanormals crowd went back
to watching MTV's the grind in preparation for their next outing. I for
one, was not impressed by this event. Perhaps I had had my fill or
raving for the day -- Spundae was like having a pop-tart for dessert
after gourmet dining at Stompy -- an unecessary waste of money and
time.

whilst i was stuck in limbo waiting to board the splish cruiser, 
i was whetting my chops in anticipation to report how lame nomad's prep
job was (an hour and a half late).  But, after the tragedy that ensued,
 i plunged into much more important
areas of deep question and thought... 

i share these with the community...

would this event cause stereotypical hype about ravers and their events?
--i guess that the media coverage was light and thankfully 
non-exploitative.

is the crew responsive to the emergency situation?  is there any 
hesitation in helping the jumpers?  why are we not being informed?  how 
long to deploy the choppers and rescue boats?  Shouldn't we all be on 
deck in an organized fashion to help visually search?  Was this a suicide 
or an accident? Is it appropriate for the beats to still be pumpin 
considering the overwhelming priority of finding the people overboard?  
Are they forcing the deejays to play so that no one asks for their money 
back?  Is the music successfully lending a soothing soundscape or 
backdrop to this ominous cruise?

I want to maintain that these unedited thoughts darting around my brain 
on friday night  should not be swept under the rug.  We need to be more 
responsible, communicative and caring or our generation will not progress 
any more than the others.

I had been hoping to get out to Love A-fair all month... and of course, I end
up getting the worst cold of the year on the weekend that it's happening!
 How's that for luck? Oh, well... Glad to see that everyone who GOT to go had
a good time...

white people and techno?
I don't get it.. What do you mean, white people and techno?
What does this correlation have to do with anything?


Not to make two wrongs here but..  Isn't techno more like the white mans
heavy metel? Just my opinion..  You take away thoughs 303's and put in some
electric guitar, you got Metallica, minus the vocals...
Anyways..  Your high to think that white people don't have no rythm.

well, after spending valentine's day alone after last minute changes 
in plans, i was expecting love a-fair to make up for lost time. :)
	IT DID! um, in a way. here are a few things I learned on 
February 15th.
	1) SFRavers are the SHIT! I ran into Leslie, Ryan, Liquid, 
Madame Merc, Lucas, Eric, Pablo, Clay an tons more.. :) It was 
wonderful!:))
	2) I get easily bored with progressive and deep house 
(boomtisboomtisboomtis just doesn't do it for me). 
	3) I get easily intimidated by the crowd that was hangin 
around in between the heartbeat chamber and the main room - can't 
they hang out and look mean somewhere else other than a hallway? :)
	4) If any guy veers me into a wall and gets all creepy, tell 
them Pablo or a guy friend is your boyfriend (THANKS TONS PABLO!), it 
works wonders! :)
	5) Fruit -- oranges, lemons and strawberries are FUN to hand 
out and share with people. Thanks TONS to  Vlad for letting me bring 
some int, they put smiles on every single person I shared with's 
face. :) 
	6) Good things come to those who wait -- Jonathan's set, 
followed by Miah's set were my favorite highlights of the evening. I 
ran outside to get a crowd in to hear Miah's set (yay!) and it was 
the first time our group of rriends were inside the werehouse the 
whole night long.
	7) For me, the vibe was ALIVE outside. When the music 
stopped, we all started screaming and dancing until the music went 
back on. Found myself a handful of new friends out there as well as 
friends I haven't seen since way back. :) Plus it wasn't all hot and 
crowded, and cuddling to keep warm with everyone was the best!
	So yeah, I had a great time at Love A-Fair in general. Wow, I 
really can't believe I went to massives all the time before, they're 
so expensive and crowded and so many tense-angry looking people in 
some places! But you can't really control the crowd you're gonna get 
at a massive, and all things considering, the vibe was pretty good 
that night. I heard alot of KMEL-type "hi NRG" rappy stuff and as i 
said boomtis house, so i didn't concentrate on the music, i 
concentrated on people :) Boring review I know. Missed deepfog's set 
cuz of a flat tire (damn you, car, damn you!) :((( and spent about 
70% of the party outside, dancing, eating fruit, talking to friends.. 
15% in the heartbeat chamber saying hullo to sfravers and dancing... 
and 15% in the pulse/walking around home base with a friend and a 
teddy bear w/ a mask on.. (the teddy, not me!):)
	anyway, great to go back to the massive scene before they 
close home base (i hear they're turning it into a shopping mall cuz 
the guy was breaking even leasing out the space and they're tearing 
it down? can anyone confirm?).. if they DO close homebase, what will 
this do to the massive scene? just curious.. :) hey, many thanks to 
pablo and ryan for helping me find my lost things and to ALL of you 
for sharing your love and smiling :) and vlad, many thanks to a 
wonderful event :)
love and hugs,
lara

Check your self Niels!

: spundae -- double minus bad thumbs down.
 
Spundae's was bomb. Coreys last night out..
 I know he had fun, but I guess some people can just have a good time no
matter where they are.

: Perhaps it was just the crowd of 20something-kawlich-whiteboys and
same-looking-peninsula-chix that made this thing a vibeless affair.

Yet agian..  What does this mean?  I am a white boy..  What the fuck?
"Asshole, racist, shit-head."

: I found Doc Martin's set to be pretty lackluster and boring, with a
couple of interesting mixes here and there, but a disappointing selection
of what I thought of as "generic LA club music." I've heard Doc do some
great stuff in the past -- perhaps LA has gotten to him. I felt similarly
about DJ Dan's set, which was driving, but passionless/unfunky.

Why do you talk so much shit?
I would of thought that god would be more of a respecting type. You have
really disapointed me.
It's funny.. Cause.. I feel like saying, you act like your god or
something..  Cause thats what people usually say to your kind.. But I
really don't think god just sits up in heaven talking shit about everyone,
like you...

Sick demon of negativity.

You can call me your Sir.

It's funny.. My friend Tim was frying his booty off at Love-Affair....
He was saying that he felt like he had the most evil look on his face
right.. While he was on his little acid trip. He remembers going though
that hallway between the two big rooms and, he looks around to see all
these evil looking people (with pissed off looks on there faces) and thinks
to him self..  "Woh...  All these people must be frying too!!"..

It was funnier when he explained it though..

After reading the story about the cruise party jumper I really felt sad.. 
not so much for the person who jumped, although that is of course sad..

People have a right to kill themselves.. I think.. However,
the death of the security guard seemed really tragic.. 

Here is a guy who was probably being paid $10.00 an hour,giving his life 
in an attempt to save one of the partygoers..
Someone should throw a benefit - or some kind of memorial to thank him.. 
posthumously...

...but not too late to tell you all about this bitch'n gathering...

It's really good to see that the SouthBay can get it going-on!  This
party had "rave" written all over it - in the inside, of course!  To
start things off, the map-point was easy to find, filled with good
vibes/friendly people and fairly close to the final destination. The
crew was FEVERISH about making sure that everything went right at the
door which is a good thing, as San Jose is known to be inhospitable to
the Rave scene.
COOL, FREAKY, LOVABLE people we're hangin' in every room.....and....I
know that you won't believe it cuz we're talking about the SouthBay
but.... there was a dedicated lack of "thugs" which meant that the vibe
was WAY INTENSE!!!  Despite all of this killer vibe there was a few
downturns to this otherwise 5-Star affair.  Everyone was sooo paranoid
about a bust that the music was soooooooooo low that I coulda gone out
to my car - backed it up to the door and rocked the house with it!  I
know, I know... it didn't get busted and the music eventually got a
little louder....  The thing is is that we would all start getting
funky and rolling on that roller-coaster ride which is the hallmark of
a good sound engineer and WHAM - you are back to ground zero.
The other "little" thing that I heard people complaining about was that
it was too cold.  My thoughts were that IT IS NEVER TO COLD AT A RAVE! 
I know that you've probably heard it before, "If you are cold then you
just aren't dancing enough/fast enough."  Feel the relative comfort af
a chill, compared to the agony of not being able to drink E'nough
fluids to keep you from overheating or sweating so much that.... you
all know what I mean!
Wow, free power-drinks and fruit!  That was way kewl.  The place was
decorated in a way that you knew that it was an UG as you could tell
that the decorations didn't cost a lot but, MAN WERE THEY POWERFULL! 
The Tree-room, mushroom-room, "jungle"room and main room were all
gorgeous.  My favoritE was the manequin(sp), hanging from the ceiling,
with the butterfly wings and the cool things being projected on her (I
must have spent most of my time staring at that enchanting creature).
All in all, a great party.  Everyone was having a blast ('cept for the
few novice cAndy-flippErs holding onto my wife!)  Props go all-out to
Adam and his crew for a fine job and we hope to attend another superb
night of sonic sensations, huggy-smiley people and unequalled visuals.


pLOVEur,
-SoNiC
(a new kind of TechKnowHippie)

p.s. Deepfog, I'm sorry that I didn't get to hear you spin at
LoveAffair...next time.

If I could mention a couple of things to the promoter:
1. CHAI would be a welcome addition
2. The power-drinks were nasty, think about making them more like
power-drinks and charge us a couple of buck for them.  If they are good
you'll make money and we'll be satisfied.
3. Don't lose those visuals, they were Xcellent - and you know what I
mean.
4. Please, please find a place where there isn't next door neighbors,
we like to hear it LOUD!
5. This event had "gathering" written all over it.  Whatever you do,
try to maintain it. 

Rock the house, Adam!

 Check the SJ Merc (Monday) for details. I don't know which section, 
sorry. Interesting to note that NO mention of the type of party held on 
the boat (ship?). Interesting notes on the individual who intially 
jumped. Apparently a "friend" said that the jumper was hostile and seeing 
devil's faces when he looked at certain people. Not only did he jump into 
the bay but he did it from the third deck of the ship.

 My apologies for any misquotes (this is from memory).

Actually I thought Neils posted an interesting and factual review and
added some opinions which while strongly expressed at least had some
humor.

More than I can say for Jeff's response.  Or is sfraves no longer a place
where we can express an opinion without having it crammed back down our
throats by someone who doesn't agree?

This shit is getting old. This type of attitude is too common among the
ravers out here. For some reason I thought that I would be escaping this
type of stereotypic labeling from where I was from. Many times during my
short stay out here I had to keep myself from being absorbed with all of
this negative energy. I told a few people I was from Indiana and any
person who is familiar with body language could tell that they already
had their minds made up about this Indiana boy. I wanted to say looky
here wormboy you obviously have no concept of the rave scene(s) or dance
music period but that would just be bringing me down to their level.
Instead I kept on smiling. For those of you who still don't know there
are raves everywhere. In every state in every major city throughout the
world. Soon the entire rave scene in the U.S. will be like that in the
U.K. (If it is not already here) 
 I cannot look people in the face in public you see. It is a no win
situation. I cannot look at men because they will think I am gay, If I
do not look then I am too good for them. For women the same, If I look I
want to get in their pants, If I don't then I am gay. Maybe this was a
vibeless party because people actually waste their time worrying about
what other people look like. 
Dave Clarke is considered "normal looking" but does that make him any
less of a person. Just because someone looks like a frat boy does not
mean anything about what this person feels inside. Should all these frat
boys and glamour girls get garbed out in vintage adidas jump suits and
pierce their nose septums to fit in? I don't think so, they would be
just as fake as the people who continuously talk about each other on
this list. If there are any REAL(underground)ravers out there who have
better things to do than talk about other people let me know. I feel as
if I am the only happy person left on the face of the earth. 
I would love to meet new people who would like a friend. I don't care
who you are as long as you understand that we are all the same deep
down. I have had many winding roads to travel over to get where I am at
today, so in no way am I perfect or anyone else for that fact.
Peace(Hopefully some day), Love(Must love yourself first), Unity(???),
and Respect(Must give to recieve). Love to all who have love to give.

I second that, I was talking to the guy about 20 minutes before it happened.
He was pretty kool, when the party started he told people that if they
wanted to "burn" they needed to do it uptairs, outside so the captain
wouldn't smell 
anything (people didn't pay him any attention).

There are many things that really disturb me about this tragedy.  Yes, it
was dark, yes maybe people reacted slow but the more overwhelming thing
that worries me are the following...

	1) Where was the "jumper's" Family? Didn't he come to the party with
people? If he was blazing (as some people report) why didn't someone from
his posse keep an eye on him?  Why didn't other ravers keep a eye on him?
Back during the times when raving was a potentially dangerous affair
(abandonded warehouses, toxic landfills, sketchy neighborhoods), everyone
looked out for eachother, if some one was too high, people would keep an
eye on them.  I'm a big tall guy, I would have to do a little work to even
fall over the railing
on that boat, didn't anyone see this guy climbing up on the railing, didn't
anyone care? Or was everyone too fucked up to worry about it.  After this
all happened I heard people yelling to turn the music back on, lighting up
bowels and making out, even though two people just lost their lives.  This
isn't
what raving is about for me and it definitely makes me not want to go out
much anymore.

As far as the security guard is concerned, he was very brave, and very
compasionate to give his life to try and save another.  If anyone wants to
throw a tribute party in his honor.  I would gladly participate.  I once
went in some water to get to a hyperthermic person stuck on a rock, (and I
can't swim :) this incident makes me realize just how lucky (or foolish) I
was. My heart goes out to him his family and I so very sad that this guys
gave his life to save someone he didn't know, and none of the supposed
PLURist seem to give a fuck. This guys exhibited more PLUR then all the
windbags who talk shit on a regular basis on this list.

I am sorry if this starts a flame war but I am very curious on this
subject. I have noticed that there are alot of people who have a stud
between their eyebrows. Is this a test to see if people look at the stud
instead of the person's eyes when they are talking or is this for
aesthetic purposes? I understand that people have different reasons for
doing everything but I have noticed in the Midwest that in the
underground music scene piercing changes in styles over time. It seems
as if the in-group is constantly changing to distant itself from the
rest of society. Is this actually taking place. From my limited
understanding the nose septum was cool then too many fakies(not real)
started doing that then it went to such things as the ear expander.
Sorry if this offends anyone this was not my intention.

If the memorial party happens, proceeds should go to family of the security 
guard, and the raver as well.  If the security guard has kids, his family 
might not be doing too well financially with him gone.  Just a thought.

I second that, I was talking to the guy about 20 minutes before it happened.
He was pretty kool, when the party started he told people that if they
wanted to "burn" they needed to do it uptairs, outside so the captain
wouldn't smell 
anything (people didn't pay him any attention).

There are many things that really disturb me about this tragedy.  Yes, it
was dark, yes maybe people reacted slow but the more overwhelming thing
that worries me are the following...

	1) Where was the "jumper's" Family? Didn't he come to the party with
people? If he was blazing (as some people report) why didn't someone from
his posse keep an eye on him?  Why didn't other ravers keep a eye on him?
Back during the times when raving was a potentially dangerous affair
(abandonded warehouses, toxic landfills, sketchy neighborhoods), everyone
looked out for eachother, if some one was too high, people would keep an
eye on them.  I'm a big tall guy, I would have to do a little work to even
fall over the railing
on that boat, didn't anyone see this guy climbing up on the railing, didn't
anyone care? Or was everyone too fucked up to worry about it.  After this
all happened I heard people yelling to turn the music back on, lighting up
bowels and making out, even though two people just lost their lives.  This
isn't
what raving is about for me and it definitely makes me not want to go out
much anymore.

As far as the security guard is concerned, he was very brave, and very
compasionate to give his life to try and save another.  If anyone wants to
throw a tribute party in his honor.  I would gladly participate.  I once
went in some water to get to a hyperthermic person stuck on a rock, (and I
can't swim :) this incident makes me realize just how lucky (or foolish) I
was. My heart goes out to him his family and I so very sad that this guys
gave his life to save someone he didn't know, and none of the supposed
PLURist seem to give a fuck. This guys exhibited more PLUR then all the
windbags who talk shit on a regular basis on this list.

I don't usually like to get involved in these little festivals here on 
the lovely list (prob. why I *never* post), but here goes anyway.

I think you are maybe getting just a bit over defensive here.  It sounds
like you have had some bad experiences with peeps, but Niels was not
attacking you or your race (I think he is a whiteboy, also).  Though Niels
can often get inflammatory, this post seemed fairly tame.  I chose not to
go to this one, but I have attended my fair share of spundae events and
they do tend to be a bit more clubby with a meat-market vibe, especially
on holiday weekends.  Lots of peeps standing around (not dancing, even on
the dancefloor) checking out the opposite sex, with beer in hand. 
Whatever floats yer boat, but not the sort of vibe I'm looking for.  I am
just guessing that is what Niels is talking about, I'm not speaking for
him though. 

Stompy-stomp-stomp:

I definitely enjoyed myself, big time, at Stompy.  It was am awesome
Wicked-like vibe, with some getting incredibly decked out and almost
everyone in the place dancing uncontrollably (with the rest taking much
needed breaks).  Those that were drinking beer seemed to be just wetting
their whistle to get back on the floor.  It got a bit warm at times, but
never unbearable.  It was so cool when they periodically opened the roof. 
letting lots of nice air and smoke out. 

Those boys from Chicago sure know how to get a groove on.  Made me 
believe in house music again.  I wish they lived here.  I am never going 
to miss a gig that they do here again.  That is a promise.

You took one sentence of Niels' post and turned it into a huge rant about
race.  Neils' description brought an instant picture to mind (which I
think constitutes a good, if biased, description :).  I do not judge a
book by it's cover.  But if a frat-boy type is looking too cool and
*standing* on the dance floor (esp, if right in front of me while I am
dancing and trying to connect with the vibe), I will prob. think of him as
a frat boy.  On the other hand if he is getting sweaty and working in it
with the rest, I wouldn't even notice him as such.  Do you get it? 

The crowd at Stompy was just so funky (even the whiteys).  
It made me happy.

Yeah! I totally liked the way they had this room set up. It was empty
except for a huge wall 'o speakers and a DJ stand in the back of the room.
The rest of the room was covered with phat ass graphics everywhere. I felt
like I was trippin' *hard* even though I was still sober, just by walking
in there. Whoever did the visuals in that room gets _PHAT_ props. If they
had these visuals at more parties, I'd give up LSD for good.

Stop drug use by providing superior visual stimulation...

I can't agree more (about the visuals). It was my first time doing LSD and
it was fucking awesome. I swear I had an out of body experience. Those
visuals kicked ass. My ONLY complaint is that there was no way of knowing
who was spinning at any fiven time.. I wish there was a display that said
their name.... like at Mega Buzz... doesn't everyone agree? I though
Kereoki was spinning when it was really Seany-Boy (thanks for clearing
this up for me Vlad).

I was up for 2 days....

Take care of your selves.

Okay, you click there and it's some attempt by some guy to get the
company WhizKid to buyout his domain name?!!!  That stinks if it's
true.  My raver friends, please don't go to this site expecting to find
anything... all that we're doing by going there is probably racking-up
numbers for this guy who owns the domain name to present to the company
he's trying to cooerce into buying it! (uhhhh, that was a long
sentence!)

Jeff,

I can;t decide whterh you're kidding, a lunatic, or on hallucinogens.
Maybe you just have a difficult time putting together cohesive thoughts.

All I can say about your post is, er, "Huh?"

It is interesting that you can get in my head simply by me asking a
question? I think you are missing the point. I believe I have the right
to talk about this subject because I myself have contemplated whether or
not getting my ears pierced and my nose septum. I tried to get my ears
pierced but they got infected. The doctor said I had to have solid gold! 
So what you are telling me is that you and others get face peircing done
for no reason at all. I find this very vague. You must understand that
you are separating yourselves from society. This is not a bad thing of
course. 

> separate themselves, but you are the one drawing the line as to what's
> acceptable and what's not. How can you tell if someone is a fakie?  Is

How did I draw a line? Did I say this is bad to have your nose pierced?
I will tell you how I know someone is a fakie. HMMMMM. Lets see from my
experience with raves. I noticed a certain girl who I tried to talk to
her. Walked up to her with a smile and I made a comment about her purple
vintage jump suit. She was very mean and DISrespectful, oh well I have
had this happen before. I later saw her at a rave in Ohio and she had
her nose septum pierced walking around without a smile on her face. It
wasn't until about two weeks later that I saw her again and she was with
her friend hugging people. So, I said maybe she has had a change of
heart I will go talk to her again. Once again a meanie. I graduated with
a minor in Anthropology so I think some of my observations should be
considered valid. Some people will however not agree with this
assumption. This girl wanted to be cool she wanted to be part of the in
crowd and she was going to do whatever it takes to get there. In no way
was this post designed to make fun of body piercing. I think it takes a
very strong person to look different in this day in age.

Now we are getting some where. You say "It takes a certain mindset" so
you could see how some people get their nose, belly button, or anything
else pierced for diffrent reasons.

How is this in my head? I can understand if you sat down and listened to
what I was saying and then you psycho-analyzed what I said. There are
"in" crowds everywhere. Does the term tribal have something to do with
this? I think so. There were many "in" crowds in grade school, junior
high, high school, and everywhere which EVERYONE at some time wants to
be part of. If this is not the case for everyone I would have a hard
time believing that.

I don't exactly understand this term "old school". Do you mean that you
were pierced before many others were. Does this relate to your
involvement in the early underground? Please explain!

As I STATED in the original post the intention was not to start a flame
war. But for this list it should be expected I guess. How can anyone
prejudge anyone else on this list by simply asking a valid question.

I know.  It got a little wordy didn't it?  I say, if you want to get
something pierced, 
think of what will look good on YOU.  And, if you happen to pierce
something less common, (such as a cheek or chin) be sure you are
comfortable with it.  Tons of people will ask you about it, be sure to
be ready to talk about it even if you are half asleep or gotten used to
the fact that it's there.  Remember there are piercings you can get that
you don't have to show the world everyday.  I am considering those.

I think I responded to you privately so as not to start a flame war.
You're question was indeed valid, otherwise I would not have answered
it.

Peace and Piercings!

How am I getting defensive? I responded to Niels prejudgemental remarks.

I mentioned that.

No, I have had bad experiences with people not pReps. When I say public

How do you know I am white? Does this even matter?

Could you PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE explain how I did this? Was it because I
used Dave Clarke as an example? If so I think you need to look in the
mirror. You are thinking in racial terms. Please, explain all of this
talk about race. I am getting real scared of the list. I will use DAVE
ANGEL as an example this time. My point was that if a person wearing a
polo came into a rave (which Dave Clarke has been known to wear at
times) he would no doubt be considered by many of the prejudgemental
clueless ravers as a prep but after they hear he is Dave Clarke they
would be riding his jock.

No, sorry I don't get it. So you are saying a prep who is dancing is
more accepted by yourself than a preppy who is standing. Maybe he wants
to make friends and he is afraid he will make a fool of himself. Maybe
he is just like you but you are placing your prejudices of preppys upon
him. It sounds to me that the preppy is the book and you are judging it
by his cover (appearance).

It is interesting that you can get in my head simply by me asking a
question? I think you are missing the point. I believe I have the right
to talk about this subject because I myself have contemplated whether or
not getting my ears pierced and my nose septum. I tried to get my ears
pierced but they got infected. The doctor said I had to have solid gold! 
So what you are telling me is that you and others get face peircing done
for no reason at all. I find this very vague. You must understand that
you ARE separating yourselves from society. This is not a bad thing of
course. But It is hard to land a job dealing with the public when you
have a nose ring. I think you can get my point.

How did I draw a line? Did I say this is bad to have your nose pierced?
I will tell you how I know someone is a fakie. HMMMMM. Lets see from my
experience with raves. I noticed a certain girl who I tried to talk to
her. Walked up to her with a smile and I made a comment about her purple
vintage jump suit. She was very mean and DISrespectful, oh well I have
had this happen before. I later saw her at a rave in Ohio and she had
her nose septum pierced walking around without a smile on her face. It
wasn't until about two weeks later that I saw her again and she was with
her friend hugging people. So, I said maybe she has had a change of
heart I will go talk to her again. Once again a meanie. I graduated with
a minor in Anthropology so I think some of my observations should be
considered valid. Some people will however not agree with this
assumption. This girl wanted to be cool she wanted to be part of the in
crowd and she was going to do whatever it takes to get there. In no way
was this post designed to make fun of body piercing. I think it takes a
very strong person to look different in this day in age.

Now we are getting some where. You say "It takes a certain mindset" so
you could see how some people get their nose, belly button, or anything
else pierced for diffrent reasons. From my limited understanding of
Egyptian culture only the royalty was allowed to pierced their bodies
and faces. So you could see in Egyptian culture the reasons were very
different or maybe not as different depending how you look at it.

How is this in my head? I can understand if you sat down and listened to
what I was saying and then you psycho-analyzed what I said. There are
"in" crowds everywhere. Does the term tribal have something to do with
this? I think so. There were many "in" crowds in grade school, junior
high, high school, and everywhere which EVERYONE at some time wants to
be part of. If this is not the case for everyone I would have a hard
time believing that. 

I am kinda oldschool, but the opposite was true in

I don't exactly understand this term "old school". Do you mean that you
were pierced before many others were. Does this relate to your
involvement in the early underground? Please explain!

How can you consider yourself a freak? What makes you a freak on the

As I STATED in the original post the intention was not to start a flame

Sorry, Jeff this was an honest mistake!! I got a little worked up and
was not paying attention. See how easy it is to be human and make
mistakes. Niels, I am sure you will realize real soom that you are
opening new doors and closing others. We all go through this some time
in our lives. That is how we grow and blossom into positive, merkaba
sporting, loving people. If we all got away from labeling each other on
this list this would at least give some of us a place where we could
learn and not be afraid of offending each other. You are still loved by
me if that is worth anything.

Just comments here.  I thought that ALL bomb threats were treated
seriously ALL the time no matter how hokey they appeared to be.  All
through college, there was always bomb threats during midterms and finals.
Everyone knew they were fake, but the university still had to evacuate
each and every building where the threat occured.  I'd say the police
were being slightly irresponsible under this premise then.  But, I don't
know what the law is.  I just assumed ALL bomb threats were evacuated.

Agreed. Up 'till now I've been mulling over the idea of having a
Houseboat party during the summer. But I think I may shelf that idea
after the Nomad event. Which clarifed a concern that perhaps large
bodies of water and substances don't mix.

I heard about this the night after I talked to a friend about the party.
One of the things that has really been bugging me about parties of late is
the ever present "Yeah that sucked, but it was still a great party!  The
DJ's ROCKED IT!!!" ;(

I said it during the Burning Man/Omar incident, during other episodes where
people had to be carried out of parties on stretchers, seeing people on
respirators, etc.  And usually some pollyanna will pipe up from the drug
induced euphoric moment with "Let's not concentrate on the negative..." or
the even more tepid and dumb "Let's not forget all the other GOOD things
that have happened...." ARRGH!!!

Maybe what needs to be done, instead of running away from this reality, is
to confront it.  Is to ask ourselves "What are WE doing?".  I remember
during many drug induced hours asking myself that same question.  What was
I doing crackerjacking when I coulda been home playin with my kid, what was
I doing in a dark ass club when I coulda been huggin' and snugglin' with
the wife, what am I doing while somewhere out there someone is hurting,
suffering, etc.  These were some of my "E" & LSD thoughts during my later
days of this scene.

Now I have no problem with people going out and doing the do.  I do not
foist the massive responsibilities I have, or my heavy thoughts on others,
but at some time we gotta ask why we do the things we do, and to what ends?
I mean, when someone dies, giving his life for a crackerjacker (who is
still a human), how important does the party become?  Someone has died,
someone was seriously injured, and someone might never have a daddy or
mommy ever again.  What up?

Does the party go on, or are we human enough to really take pause.  Take
time out to assess what is really going on....I'll tell you what's going on
these days, and I don't need to go out to know this either:

It is nothing but a drug party, and it has become the reason the majority
party.  That's it, plain and simple.  This scene has changed, for the worse
IMO.

Yes, there are pockets of "vibe" and "goodness" out there for sure, and I
know some of you are involved in various scenes or cliques that are more
positive.  But, alas, you are outnumbered and in the extreme minority.
Just a note.  Parties these days are all about:
#1 - Scoring the drugs.
#2 - Music
#3 - Friends (only those you'll see in the scene, cuz' you ain't hangin'
otherwise).

Once again, let me reiterate, this does not apply to everyone, but this
scene, as a whole, has become the biggest escape vehicle since television.
And we do know the value TV has in our society and the value-add it
provides overall to our society.  I think the same can be said of the
current state of our dance culture.  People die, and the party must go on.
People get hurt, hospitalized, and the party goes on.  Poeple will never
walk again, never dance again, but the party must go on.  Sick, sick, sick!

"Yeah man, I saw this guy get decapitated, but dood, fuckin' DJ SoAndSo
tore it up, and man, I had a great time, despite the fact, this guy is
fertilizer."  Of course, in order for us to feel better, a group of
genuinely good people will get together to throw a party to collect some
funds for whatever.  How ironic.  And this is often touted  as a way for
the scene to heal itself...yeah, let's throw another drug party, collect
some money then give it to the family.

You know, if I didn't know the people I do, if I were half as bitter as
some would make me out to be, I would have a mind to call up the TV
stations, the cops, and whoever else I could, and have them investigate
FULLY what happened.  But even *I*, with all my high falutin talk won't
step up to that plate. Ironically my honor to many of the people in all of
this means I keep lotsa shit to myself, and that is where it'll stay.

So I have my own little forms of protest.  I stay away from the majority of
all of this.  I do go to really small events, like @ the TOP, or even a D7
party every blue moon.  I would even probably go to Stompy if it weren't on
the weekends I have visitation w/ my son, His Excellency (I love my boy,
he's the BOMB!).  But crackerjackin' @ a party is OUT.  Being out of my
skull is OUT.  And socializing ONLY at parties is OUT, OUT, OUT!

Out of all of this what do we get:  DRAMA.  The drama of people losing
thier lives because of drugs & irresponsible use.   The drama of people
never being able to dance again.  The drama of people throwing benefits
(read drug parties) for the purpose of, er, healing. The drama of girls
snatchin' other girls men, actively.  The drama of guys and girls notchin'
up thier bedposts with the conquests of other people's mates.  The drama of
some mother, some brother, some father, some sister, some daughter, some
son, crying because the person they love will never come home again.

But the party must go on.  Damn, that DJ' really rocked the fucking house....

I need a Kleenex, an enema, and even more of a break from parties...months
and counting,
John

P.S.  These are my opinions and thoughts.  I will pray for both of those
people who lost thier lives.  For the person who got so high he would never
ever touch the ground again, and for the person who gave his life trying to
make sure that this person would see his tribe again:  My hopes and prayers
are with you both.  Peace.

"Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people
who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder
and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its waters... Power
concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will."

Frederick Douglas, 1857

in any way?  

How does my example relate to you Cami? Are you afraid that you are
being considered this type of girlie? If so I think you are getting a
little to defensive. For your information I wanted to ask the girl where
she got her jump suit but she instantly thought I was trying to crack.
Can you see by this girl having this attitude she had shut the doors on
me being a friend?
> so, she is probably often approached by men/boys, some of whom, I am sure,are very sleazy about it.  I speak from my own experience.  I am very wary of men I don't know coming up to me at raves/clubs. 

This sounds like a problem you should address. I would be flattered to
have someone come up to me and strike up a conversation.  

>Unbelievable as you may think, not every male in attendance at raves have merely Peace,Love, Unity and Respect on their minds.  Some are also thinking about getting themselves some raver-girlie booty. Hate to burst your idealistic bubble.  

Sorry to burst yours but I think since I am a male I fully understand
this scenerio very well. Not everyone on this list has PLUR on their
minds. What is your point that you should filter off all forms of male
contact except with your boyfriend. You say that you have a problem with
men approaching you at raves so in essense are you saying that all of
them are out for puss. 


You, yourself, may have had the best intentions about
> approaching this woman/girl.  Why did you approach her again?  You liked her outfit, thought she was cute?  She may have been approached by 10 guys before you came up to her.  I think her attitude came from her
defense mechanisms.  Most attractive women know this and many men don't
> understand this.  Women do not prowl after men in the same way (for the most part, there are exceptions), so men don't understand this.  

Here is where you are dead wrong. There are many women out there who
prowl after men. Women are finally understanding that it is ok to be
themselves and if there is something they like who is to say they can't
go out and get it. Madonna I believe is a good example. The male
dominated society has for the longest time dictated what is socially
acceptable for woman. More and more women in my opinion are taking what
little power they do have in this world. My 60 year old aunt has told me
that she has noticed that many more females today know what they want in
a mate and if they don't find it then they find someone who can give
what they want.
> saying is, you really cannot judge people just by how they individually react to you. You would prob. think I am a fakie bitch too.  
I sure in the hell would think you were a fakie if I could not come up
to you and strike up a conversation without you jumping on the
defensive.

I wouldn't classify myself as beautiful either, more like modestly attractive, so if it happens to me with this kind of frequency just think how often it happens to drop-dead-types.  This is why I don't do E at raves anymore.

> > How is this in my head? I can understand if you sat down and listened to what I was saying and then you psycho-analyzed what I said. There are "in" crowds everywhere. Does the term tribal have something to do with this? I think so. There were many "in" crowds in grade school, junior high, high school, and everywhere which EVERYONE at some time wants to be part of. If this is not the case for everyone I would have a hard time believing that.
> 
> I think you may have some insecurities you have not dealt with.  Try to be honest with yourself.  

Sorry, to burst your idealistic bubble but I am more secure with myself
than anyone could possibly imagine. What insecurities in particular have
you picked up on? When it comes to speaking with people I am myself.
Many times people think that I am insulting their intelligence when I am
not. Soon people will realize when a person is smiling they are happy
not every male is trying to get in their women's pants. I will give you
a perfect example: I meet a couple who were ravers and the female was
dogging her boyfriend in front of me. Then he was watching me when I was
listening to what she was saying. So if we want to talk about
insecurities we can.  

>Do you feel like an outsider?  If so, it is your problem, not those that seem like the "in" group.  

I think you are misinterpreting my original questions once again. I have
been in a "in" group before where you talk about other people who are
not "in". This is very unhealthy. Very negative. I don't want to be a
part of any such group anymore.  

People that appear to be in the "in" crowd have their own insecurities
and problems; it's not all it's crapped up to be.  Take it from a former

How did I prejudge you or anyone else? Please explain this.

Please explain your reasoning? The only conclusion I have drawn from
this is that you were once considered a part of an "in" group
(cheerleader) then you decided to move on the another "in" group. That
is why you are so defensive to my original post. Don't get me wrong, I
am a very loving person but I get upset when people think they have my
situation figured out. You don't know me as much as I don't know you but
if I have meet you before HMMMM. let's say at a meeting. Then I know you

Lecture to follow.  Flame me at will, I'm beyond that and need to say
something that has been on my mind.  

Do we have to hear so many posts about the plethora of drugs one did at a
party?  How many people really care about how you were E'in/fryin'/420'in 
your ass off?  I think people say this stuff because they think this is a
forum where others are sympathetic.  I'd just like to say that I
personally am not sympathetic to hearing how fucking high someone was.  If
you want to do 4 E's, 18 hits of acid, please keep it among your substance
abusing friends. (and if you don't think that's abuse, maybe that's the
answer, or was that the question?)  I think this just equates with where
the rave scene is going.  Mentioning how high you were used to be a
severely frowned upon topic here on this list 2 years ago.  If you wanted
to ask information, or even talk about how E or LSD helped you gain some
insight into the world around you, or maybe bond with your friends, the
list tolerated that.  Maybe because it meant that drugs were a tool and
not a vice.

But no one talks about it in this manner any more.  After every weekend, I
get on my computer only to find out how the party was so great and you
were E'in your ass off.  Props to you.  

People, look at the trends.  Do we wonder why the scene is changing?  Just
read the list and see what the recent posts are about for greater insight 
into the "raver world". All you see these days (with exceptions, of
course) are the posts about how PHun or how PHat a party is.  How PHony
is my reply.  I can honestly say that I think most people see this.  I
used to go to a party to come home a better person the next day, to a
certain degree.  Now, when I think about going to a party, I think, "let's
find somewhere were I can ignore the rest of the crowd, hang with my
friends, and chill to some music."  I used to feel like we were all in
this together, but now I feel like it is an individual pursuit to have the
best time you can at the biggest party you can go to.  

Believe me, I know my part in this.  I try and turn it into more self
exploration and think about my part in the puzzle.  I just know
something's up when Nancy gets called old-school for bringing oranges to a
party, though, and everyone I see talks about how high they are.  I'm
trying not to bemoan better days because it is all relative to our age,
maturity, and experiences.  However, incorporate everything into your
world view, know your history, and accept change in that manner.  It's
over when it's just a party.

And, as a qualifier, I'm not anti-drug, anti-pleasure, nor anti-hedonism,
but I am anti-abuse and anti-materialism.  It's a trap when your excuse is
"there is always someone who does more than I do." Be careful about the
cycle you put yourself in.

I know I'm putting myself out on a limb for saying all this, but I promise
not to drag it on. Flames come from defensive people usually, and I won't
play that game.  No one wins. 
 
I don't want to be entirely negative and it's nice to still read the
reviews about how people found a sense of community or discovered
something about themselves, or even put effort into something they
believed in.  That is what has always amazed me about the rave scene.

... becuase you can move to it at different energy levels.

It is really too bad that so much of the jungle scene in this city takes
place in 21+ venues.  Its the younger people who really have the energy
to effectively get into jungle anyway...

But, you make the most of it.  King Kong was in a little bar on Folsom.
Generally a good vibe.  You could tell the promoters had their heart
in it, bananas and a stuffed gorilla was a nice touch.  The sound system
was nice.  The bar scene made it a little difficult for people to really
let go and bust into some jungle moves... but shortly after midnight it
finally happened, and the party went off for the rest of the night.

I was disappointed that 2 rooms were advertised and there was only 1.  No
big deal for 3 bucks, but little things like that make you wonder about
the intentions of the promoter.

Also, when you say a party goes until 2am, that means the lights stay off
and the music on until 2am... you don't stop the party at 1:40... its just
not right... espcially when everybody is going off.

Under the circumstances...

I was the person who the cops originally reported the bomb threat to.
Here's what was explained:

1) Evacuating the premises would have created a minor riot, possibly
leading to more harm.
2) This is an extremely common promoter trick that many party promoters
have used at one time or another. This also happens with concerts, etc.
Everyone should open their eyes to the fact that many of the promoters who
you view as being non-commercial or "old school" have done many of these
lame promoter tricks to bust other parties, in order to further their
material wealth.
3) Feel Good security went through all precautions to make sure something
like this didn't happen.

Granted, maybe the best thing to do would have been to evacuate for safety
precautions... But would you want to leave, provided that bomb threats have
happened at many parties that you have attended, even though you did not
know about them.

Now how is what Neils said prejudgemental?  He saw some white guys standing
around looking at girls.  Their appearance seemed to indicate they belonged
to some sort of Fraternity.  Whether it be Theta Epsilon Tau, or Bridge and
Tunnel Society.  I mean, from a simple glance, we here on the list have
become rather adept at figuring out whose who.  After all, it's not only a
matter of appearance, it coulda been the frat 'tude they were throwing off.
No reason to get mad.  We often use this method to determine who's a raver,
and who's a gangstah.  It's all in appearance & 'tude.  We already firgured
this stuff out so...

Peeps, is what Cami said, it is short for people.  I am well versed in
Ebonics, got a doctorate in it (from the skreets).  And I can definitely
tell you, peeps ain't no ebonics word.  See, it's a Caucasonic word.  Kida
like supersonic, but whiter than supersonic.  See what I mean?

>
>How do you know I am white? Does this even matter?

You know how?  I'll tell you:  The only people who get in a real hackles
when you try to attach race to people, in general, are whites.  People of
color , in general, don't like the labels given them since they are usually
given from the majority (white) culture.  So you'll see me go off on people
about "gangsters" or "undesireables".  But the second you try to pigeonhole
someone into a category racilly, usually a white person will jump up to
demand, er, justice.  Becuase there is only one group that is allowed to
defy categorization.  And we know that many whites in this country have a
real problem with race.  So much so, they want to erase it from
consciousness so it never has to be dealt with.  So one can assume, by
previous actions of others in life, and on this list, that your reaction to
the labelling or characterizations of whites has some how hit a nerve.
Being the spokeperson for all blacks in this country (I was just elected
BTW), I did not have such a reaction.  Why?  Why should I?  Brothers don't
sit in no corner waiting for ladies, we is on da hunt fo dem 24/7.  Also,
we can't afford no $4 drinks.  Sheeit, a 40 is only 1.99 at the corner
store (run by my semetic brothers the Arabs usually).  So why I got's to go
to a club, when I can wait fo dem ladies on da corner, wit' my 40 and
gangstah ways ready to charm?  Uncut G?  Straight up!

And no, it doesn't matter unless it really matters to you, which it does
since you're in hackles about it.

I have been so scared I unsubbed.  But then I got my nerve back and came
back on.  It's scarey here sometimes.  Sheeit, I'm scared now.

Oh yeah, don't fuck with this list.  These motherfuckers will bum rush you

Riding his jock?  Is that like, er, on his dick?  Or is that "Get off my
dick, and tell yo' b*tch to come here!"

You're right though, people are rather sycophantic when it suits their

Is there anyway else to judge a book?  C'mon, you walk into a bookstore,
the first thing you see is the cover art.  I think we need to revise this
saying cuz' it's just not true in our media driven society.  Soemthing more
like, "Don't judge a book unless you've read it page to page, but if they
didn't put any effrot into the cover art, it probably sucks."  Yeah, I like
that better.

>> The crowd at Stompy was just so funky (even the whiteys).
>
>Even the whiteys. I cannot believe that this happening.

Ok now, let's get real for a moment...who brought you break dancing,
scratching, beats, re-manipulation of music, disco, jazz, hip-hop, rap,
gospel, graffitti, tagging, Adidas, the twist, Motown, shimmy (and every
other creative modern dance form) and the High Top Fade...well it sure as
fuck wasn't Pat Boone (non dancer).  Now, I gotta give my white brothers
and sisters thier due, part of the reason Hip-Hop exists is due directly to
Kraftwerk.  Brothers from Dusseldorf were on the one.  Who made blues style
accessible to a worldwide audience? Rolling Stones, Led Zepplin, Janice
Joplin (Henrix smoked all of them, but that's another issue, he didn't play
60,000 stadiums regularly), and Patsy Kline. And of course the main kool
kat, the brotha who made porkpie hats kool (fo da masses, we already were
sportin them 10-15 years before Frankie got ahold of one) and the ONLY
person who could call the President Of The United States "Chickee Baby"
fuckin' Frank "Chairman Of The Board" Sinatra (I have his Columbia Years 4
pak CD set, smokin' baby!).  Now that brother had a smooth voice, great
phrasing, and about 100 years ahead of this country when it came to race
relations.

Look at who the giggers, stompers, and circle dancers are at a party.  Now,
I gotta hand it to some of my white brothers and sisters.  I have seen many
a white sister SMOKE a dance floor.  Same with some of my white bretheren.
But on as a whole, the brown, when it comes to moves, got it down.  But yo,
white is alright!  Ya know why?  Cu'z it's all the same at night!  (damn, I
am one poetic motherfucker!)

Many ;)'s and :)'s!,
John

P.S.  It's all IMO, good to go!!!

"Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people
who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder

     Well, it finally happened. The software company I work for is asking
me to move to sacramento. The good thing is, they're gonna help out with
tuition at sac state! Also, rent is cheap enough in this area that I can
now live on my own! if annyone knows any ravers/dj's that are looking to
split a house or apartment in this area PLEEEEASE email me at
andy@trak-it.com and let me know! I'm also interested in trying out the
rave scene in this area...I've been to two parties in sac, both where at
this small club called bojangles(?) I'm interested in any upcoming sac
parties (does majordomo have a SACRAVES list?)

Just wanted to offer a word of support for KC <scarab@value.net>.

I personally tend to think that drugs are pretty much just a
distraction from anything worthwhile.  The people that I
respect who are (or have been) into drugs, are the people
who talk about them as "training wheels" for getting into a
mental state that you can also reach without them.  People
bragging about how much they do, on the other hand, seem to
be stuck in some kind of high school status contest...

In reply to something Brian posted about how you can't get
someone from the major media to believe you if you downplay
the drugs-rave connection: there's some truth to this, but
if I were talking to the press, I would probably go on the
offensive and accuse them of helping to create the
situation.  Every time they run a story about teenagers
dancing all night on drugs (booga-booga), they're running a
highly visible ad telling all the teenagers that the cool
thing to do is get out there and do some drugs.  

Anyway, I can't claim that drug-obsessed ravers are the only
reason I don't hang at raves much these days.  The music
seems to be evolving a lot slower than it used to be, and my
interests have shifted more toward live improvised music. 

Speaking of which, I thought Electro-sphere was okay, though
I have to say I expected a little bit more in the way of
live jamming.  Mood Clinic was pretty good, but the rest of
it seemed to be the usual live DJ stuff, with maybe a little
better than average music.  The crackling Van de Graff
generator up on stage was okay, though.

Sorry to everyone on the list.  Please disregard Chris' last message.    
He responded publicly to my private e-mail to him.  

Chris,

This is the second or third time in as many days you have responded publicly 
to a private post.  I don't know if you are new to mailing lists, but it is 
general list protocol to respond privately to private e-mail.  It is 
considered to be a huge mistake to respond publicly to private e-mail.  
Be sure to read the header.   

Thanks,
Cami

That was a very REAL posting...thank you for being soooo honest.  It
made me take a step back and honestly assess where I'm at in the rave
scene.  I have to say that MOST of the stuff(situations) don't apply to
the way my wife and I and our extremely close circle of friends rave. 
But, I can definately see how things can change without you being aware
of the changes and how catastophic those said changes can be.  Here's
to making sure that your eyes are open and that you are ready to be a
responsible individual *even while partying!*

Stay REAL, party as you see fit - just don't lose touch of your
humanity.

pLOVEur,

I *totally* and *completely* agree with what John Lee said.

In fact, I would have personally called *all* the radio and TV networks
myself and clued them in so that they would be waiting to shove cameras and
microphones into the faces of these promoters as the boat returned to the
dock.

But alas I was out of town enjoying life outside the tiny manufactured
reality that is raving. :-)

If you call Nomad's voice mail lines (one per area code, of course) all you
get now is "Thank you for calling. Please leave a message and we we'll get
back to you as soon as possible."

That's quite a bit different from the usual "It was the most beautiful
party in the most beautiful space with the most beautiful crowd. Thank you
for all coming out 'blah blah blah'" type crap that's usually heard there.

I really hope they stop having parties before anyone else gets killed
("collateral damage.")

Not a flame at all from this guy!  I applaud you for saying what you
needed to say.  Do you really need to get *fucked-up* to rave?  I think
that the intensity of traffic on this list about sober-raving will
speak volumes about that idea.  Drugs are a tool.(period)  If you use
them otherwise you are opening yourself up to be a possible abuser.  Be
smart when you party, people.  I love my raver friends(and non-raver
friends) and I don't want someone to screw-up their lives - I've seen
it happen and it ain't pretty.

[ to sfraves list ]

( Mostly for those who know me, but there's some general interest too )

 My personal life just got a lot more complicated again, so I'll be 
cutting back on going out again. I'll still be subscribed to the 
list, although I may not read everything that's posted.

 I was thinking of posting some "fantasy rave" ideas, just to see
what people think of them.

Greetings,  JohnnyD here...

  Hi,   I'm wondering whats up this Friday evening in the Bay Area.   Is there
any good Goa trance parties taking place?    F-8 parties?   or anything with
some good trance?

  I'm going to be in the Bay area,  but not sure if I can stay for Sat Night,
so I'm checking on Fridays.

  According to last weeks calander,  I don't see anything scheduled for Friday
evening.

Thanx
JohnnyD

john and all,

i don't know if you guys have gotten my last post on this subject but i
wanted to clarify my point of view a bit.  the parties that the Ahau
Collective (PDX) and Starseed (SEA) are on a very different tip...i know
because i throw them and am family with Starseed.  We truly care about
each other and are in each other's live daily...we ARE family.  we take
care of each other when we're sick, we study and we share with our
community.  I know of many beautiful collectives in SF that feel the same
way.  We want children involved in this type of celebration that's why
Ahau throws dance events in the middle if Pioneer Square, downtown, and
invite the whole community during a beautiful summer day, or up in the
park.  We have our adult only nighttime things too where whoever wishes
will alter their consciousness in which ever fashion fancies them or they
run into, but, I just forget soemtimes how much more intense and
potentially diverse the SF scene is.  not to say that we have a perfect
scene, at all, we just work and keep each other in check, make sure we're
doing things for the right reasons.  you don't have to wait for a tragedy
to clean up your act.

love,

brenda
a performer, raver, mother, human being, lover

Yes, we froze to death on the dock waiting 2+ hours to get on the boat.  
Yes, the boat stayed out on the Bay for no more than 1.5 hours.  Yes, the 
lights came on and crew started cleaning up around 4AM.  Yes, there was a 
food buffet (though I don't think this was a bad thing!).  Yes, it cost $20.

But let me add that yes, there was a bar serving alcohol, and yes, 
there were a bunch of people in suits and dresses and shit drinking the 
alcohol and yes, I got hit on by drunk men.  

Yes, the party sucked!  :P

Hey all, just wanted to clarify that I was referring to the Splish from 
approximately a year ago (fall 95?).  I hadn't yet reached the thread 
about the tragedy that occured.

A letter to Troy and everyone who made it out to KING KONG the other night:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the honest review.  I was one of the organizers of the party,
and I was really happy the way it turned out.  The vibes were good, the
music was great, and I danced my ass off.  Thanks to everyone that made it
happen!

To address some of people's concerns...  the second room didn't happen
because the club owners decided to paint the floor in there on the day of
the party - we brought 4 turntables down and found out upon arriving.
There were 2 DJs who came down and didn't get to spin - thanks to Vanka and
Ian for not being sore.  I was pretty bummed about not having the chill
room, and I'd like to say that we'll have it up and running for the next
party, but I won't promise, so I don't have to go back on my word.  I
apologize on behalf of the club for false advertising.

As far as the lights going on at 1:40, again this was the club owners being
in a hurry to get home.  I will do my best to make sure in the future that
the sound system stays on and the lights stay off until 2.  This time, we
were under observation by the club, they were checking us out to see if
they wanted to have us there every week, so I was going out of my way to be
accomodating and nice to the owners.  On the bright side, I think we proved
ourselves capable of working with the club and throwing a fun party, so
they're going to give us a weekly starting in March.  I'll post to this
list with more details as soon as I have them - in the meantime you can
find out more by checking out our website -
http://www.betalounge.com/kingkong/ or calling our hotline, (415) 276-8549.

Thanks again for all of those who came out to dance, and big up all
junglists - support your local scene!

I heard about the tragedy that happened on the boat party.
What I want to know is if confirmed that the two persons are in fact dead?
It does not seem and I dont live in SF so I did not get to read the paper or
not but im unclear if they are dead or not? I would like to be involed in a
memorial party for both persons involved and if any one else would like to get
involved just E-mail me and we can ALL try and get something together. This is
a very unfortunate thing to have occured and It just points out that people
need to be responsible when taking any type of drug and be aware of your
environment.
Sub commander lycos lets talk man, and anyone else that would like to get
involved lets all come together. Sorry for the waste of bandwith

Now how is what Neils said prejudgemental?  He saw some white guys
standing around looking at girls.  Their appearance seemed to indicate
they belonged to some sort of Fraternity.  Whether it be Theta Epsilon
Tau, or Bridge and Tunnel Society.  I mean, from a simple glance, we
here on the list have become rather adept at figuring out whose who. 
After all, it's not only a matter of appearance, it coulda been the frat
'tude they were throwing off. No reason to get mad.  We often use this
method to determine who's a raver and who's a gangstah.  It's all in
appearance & 'tude.  

So you can tell a raver by his appearance? Interesting. I apologize for
the reference to peeps (my ignorance) but what I will not accept is
someone telling me this is a racial thing. I did not mention my race in
the post and I still do not understand how it was brought into the
discussion. 

We already firgured this stuff out so...

It seems to me that you yourself John are getting into a hackle. I think
you need to talk to Richie Hawtin (you know the guy Plastikman) he can
tell you all about how it is to be labeled. How the Detroit founders of
techno can be just as prejudice and prejudgemental as the (white)
culture.

> color , in general, don't like the labels given them since they are usually given from the majority (white) culture.  So you'll see me go off on people about "gangsters" or "undesireables".  But the second you try to pigeonhole someone into a category racilly, usually a white person will jump up to demand, er, justice.  Becuase there is only one group that is allowed to defy categorization.  And we know that many whites in this country have a real problem with race.  So much so, they want to erase it from consciousness so it never has to be dealt with.  So one can assume, by previous actions of others in life, and on this list, that your reaction to the labelling or characterizations of whites has some how hit a nerve.

Once again this referal hit a nerve because I did not mention my race in
any of the posts. I wanted to know how Cami knew my race without me
stating it. That's all.

> Being the spokeperson for all blacks in this country (I was just elected BTW), I did not have such a reaction.  Why?  Why should I?  Brothers don't sit in no corner waiting for ladies, we is on da hunt fo dem 24/7.   

Are you saying that all brothers hunt for the ladies? Not all white men,
asian men, or a black man wait for the ladies because they have figured
out from experience that the ones who come up to you with their game are
no good. Maybe a quick fuck, but not the type of girl to take home to
mama.

On the other hand, I think it's perfectly valid to consider that certain
drugs, used responsibly, can also be used recreationally.  When people
drink beer there's usually no higher purpose other than to get loosened up
and numbed from a lot of trouble around them temporarily - I think it's
alright to look at smoking a joint in the same way.

Life imitating the media, or the media imitating life?  

I think the tide is turning somewhat.  The article in the Chron about the
tragic boat party on Friday night said it was a "private party", which is
cool.

Yeah, I had a pretty good time too, particularly during Astral Matrix's
set, and Jason Velocette's set was really good too.  The crowd wasn't
really responding well to the jungle at the beginning of the night, and it
got really industrial at one point when Daum put on some stuff he had been
working on off of a DAT.  It was definitely cool to be at the Fillmore, a
place with a ton of history.

Hey everyone,

	As some of you may know, I have moved up to Oaktown. All is well, and the
crew and I are taking a long needed rest from the parties. But watch out
there is one coming soon!

	Anyways, the purpose of this mail, is that I am trying to find places to
ride my mountain bike. (preferably in a pretty/non smoggy place) I have
tried calling all of the parks and rec. dept. in the east bay and everyone
keeps transferring me to someone else who transfers me again. I understand,
they are all busy doing something else. It's cool. 

	So does anyone out there in sfr land have any cool places to go to and
ride? Thanks in advance!

Peace and love,

Greg =)

What I don't understand about the "rave" scene, and about this thread, is
why people seem to think that PLUR and sexual attraction are mutually
exclusive. Granted, there is a sleazy way to approach that attractive
someone, and it's very often found in your "meat market" type places. I
admit, this can be very offensive. But it's really a matter of how you
approach the person, isn't it? Granted, many people, no matter how
respectfully they are approached, are not interested in meeting anyone -
but if that's the case, then they should say so politely, and the other
person should take the hint. There seems to be an attitude among many
people on this list, and people I've encountered in the scene, that you
can't mix PLUR and approaching that attractive someone out there on the
dance floor. And I have to say I don't agree. Discuss?

	Two people are known to have gone overboard into the Bay.
	They / their bodies have not been found, so it's possible
	that one or both of them may have survived. However, it
	seems most likely that they have not, since hypothermia

Personally, I think that we should compile a list of sober raving alternatives
and post it on Hyperreal. This way we're actually doing something about the
drug problem in the scene instead of just complaining about it. I remember some
of you had some good ideas in the past, we just need a place where anybody can
review your ideas. Also, maybe people could bring some of these herbal
stimulants to parties so that people could actually see and sample them. Just a
thought...

Go to a bookstore and get a good book about local mountain bike trails.
There's a-plenty of them out there.  Almost ANY of the East Bay regional
parks have great trails.  I've ridden all over Tilden and Redwood myself
and lovely it is, lovely.

Greetings,  JohnnyD here...

  I have the honor to be driving Steve Pagan (BIG NAME DJ) up to the Bay
Area,  and I'm sure you'll soon be hearing his sick set of funky beats.

  We used to live at the Loft,  until the big purge of all ravers from
that sick cult....

  Pagan will be setting his recording studio up in San Francisco,  and
will soon be booked at future gigs.

  His music is sick,  and beats are really good.  He tends to stay on the
slow funky side,  with lots of strange synth sounds,  and he does all his
own music,  as well as has a collection of about 600,000 records (I'm sure
not all house and techno).

  Anyway,   he's a force to be reckoned with,  and I hope you all like him,
and I would like all of you great PLUR'ey SFRavers will give him a big phat
welcome to the best vibe in the WEST....

  See Y'all this weekend....   I just need to know what the PLURiest party
will be this weekend...

Luv, Y'all

JohnnyD

Hey Brian,

In reference to your version of PLUR...

PLUR is not a vice to get your mack on. Granted, they may interweave at
points.

PLUR is not a way to approach a person, it is, in essence, a way to exist.

Always show: PEACE, LOVE, UNITY, & RESPECT and good things will happen.
Now... if these good things end up being things like getting your mack on,
go with it. If PLUR leads to you making new friends, go with it. If PLUR
helps you to unravel the secrets of the universe, go with it. 

The secret of PLUR... FLOW WITH IT. GO WITH THE VIBE. GO WITH WHAT YOU FEEL
IS RIGHT, NOT ONLY FOR YOU BUT FOR THE FAMILY AROUND YOU.

Also, in reference to the fact that people don't agree with you approaching
someone on the dancefloor... take this into consideration...

When I dance, I lose myself. The music and I are essentially one entity.
When someone comes up to me and taps me on the shoulder, or bumps into me
or whatever, I fall out of that world. Something as small as someone
tapping me on the shoulder has brought me out of my own private nirvana.

The moral of the story is... just flow with it, don't try to make it happen
just let it happen. There is a lot of love flowing on the scene, mental,
physical, & spiritual. You gotta let these elements come together for
yourself as well as others, and then you will understand why people say
macking on the dancefloor and PLUR don't go together.

I saw the news last night on Ch. 7 and they called it a Murder/Suicide.
William Cortez, I think was the sec. guard's name.  They have been
searching for his body since Valentine's Day weekend, and have not found
it.  They did not mention the other guy too much, just that he committed
suicide on a Tour Boat of the Bay that had 500 passengers, and that Mr.
Cortez went in after him.  They said nothing about what kind of party it
was or if it was drug related nor did they mention dancing or raves.  

Both the people who went overboard are considered missing by police.  It
is very likely that they are both dead.

I *totally* and *completely* agree with what John Lee said.

In fact, I would have personally called *all* the radio and TV networks
myself and clued them in so that they would be waiting to shove cameras and
microphones into the faces of these promoters when the boat returned to the
dock.

But I was out of town this weekend.

If you call Nomad's voice mail lines (one per area code, of course) all you
get now is "Thank you for calling. Please leave a message and we we'll get
back to you as soon as possible."

That's quite a bit different from the usual "It was the most beautiful
party in the most beautiful space with the most beautiful crowd. Thank you
for all coming out 'blah blah blah'" type crap that's usually heard there.

I really hope they stop having parties before anyone else gets killed
(read: "collateral damage")

So, who's going to tip off the media about what *really* happened?

Calling something a cult is very strong language. You probably could be

I agree, this was a hell of a party!  Maybe the reason there hasn't been
much posted is that there's not much more to say than that?  The only
downside for me was the woman that attached herself to me and WOULDN'T
go away.  Each time I would gently disengage myself and wander off, but
sooner or later... shhhhhhlupp! ... there she was stuck on my arm again.

And it WAS frickin' hot in the main room, but that couldn't keep me out :)

I was pretty caught up in the "surprised to see old friends" trip and
consequently didn't get to have as much of a "pleased to meet new friends"
experience as I wanted.  Next time I get out, I hope to see some of you!

I actually was surprised and quite glad that the media has not caught on 
that this boat party was a "rave" event.  Surprised in that if they did 
know about it, they haven't jumped all over the rave/drug-related aspect 
of it.  Glad because I don't think publicity of this sort would be 
helpful to anyone, really.  Is there some reason you would want the media 
to know that there may have been drugs involved?  

Also, I haven't heard anything to make me think it was the promoter's
fault.  How could they have prevented something like that from happening? 
Is there something I don't know about?  I mean, really, Nomad doesn't
always put on the most well-organized events, but are they really all that
bad?  Please eduacate me why it would be a good thing to have the media 
jump on Nomad, other than that you don't like them or their events.

Don't get me wrong, I think that what happened was truly tragic.  No one 
really knows why the kid jumped, but who's to say that same kid couldn't 
have done it on a Sunset?  Would your attitude be the same?

It might have something to do with the fact that their WAREHOUSE that 
they're supposed to store shit in to sell is always empty enough for 
raving!!

I wasn't suggesting that the concept of PLUR is about "the right way" to
approach someone to score... I was just commenting that some people seem to
think that living life with PLUR and approaching an attractive stranger at
a rave are completely incompatible. They are not, IMHO. I've noticed again
and again on this list, that there are those who wish that raves could be
some sanctuary in the world where sexual attraction does not exist. I would
have to say that: 1) anywhere that you put a bunch of people together, it's
almost guaranteed that there will be SOME form of sexual attraction; and 2)
It's possible to treat someone with love and respect and still "hit on"
them. I think that those who want to pretend that sexuality doesn't exist
at raves, have probably had some bad "meat-market" type experiences. For
that, I'm sorry, but I think it would be foolish to try and pretend that
because you don't want the sex vibe to be there, it shouldn't/won't be
there. It's a fact of life for healthy human beings. Rather than wishing it
away, I think it's best to try to educate people so that the vibe is
"healthy, fun sexuality" and not "scamming meat-market."


>Also, in reference to the fact that people don't agree with you approaching
>someone on the dancefloor... take this into consideration...

I totally understand where you're coming from here, I was just using the
word "dancefloor" very loosely. It IS pretty rude to break someone out of
their dancefloor trance/bliss.

It's simply a matter of respect, and of recognizing that there are times when

What the hell was done about this?!  Is it true that the party just went 
on as though nothing happened - the boat just puttin' along, leaving two 
people to fend for themselves in the middle of the bay??!

They should have stopped the boat (and the party!!), put on any
searchlights, and immediately called authorities for help.  Anything less
than that is unconscienable. 

All we can do now is try to make this easier on the families.  I think a 
memorial fundraiser is a great idea.

 I just wanted to say sorry to everyone that had to listen to my constent 
negative bickering yesterday. Expecially Niels.
 Niels was probably just expressing his opinion, the way he expresses it. 
He probably wasn't talking shit nStuff, but it looked that way to me..
 Even though... I shouldn't of snapped out yesterday. But after being set
off by that so -n- so racist, talking about how white people and techno
don't mix.
 My world is just not always a bottle of good smelling hand lotion. things
turn to shit alot. And I don't always have the time to deal with it.
 But I don't know.. it's all good.  Just feeling kind of bad for jumping
all over Niels agian, for probably no good reason, agian.
 I am just a mean evil person or something.

 Anyways..  I don't like the way I have been talking so.  Sorry.

I'd have to go with Brian here.  I don't think it makes sense seperate PLUR 
from normal human attraction.  The vibe sucks when a party becomes nothing but 
a single's bar, and I'm not down with that kind of activity at a rave.  But I 
think it also destroys the vibe to say that you can't to get to know somebody 
a little better.  A simple rule of thumb is this:  1.  Don't go to raves 
expecting booty.  That is sleazy.  2.  If you just have to talk/dance with 
someone, be civilized about it.  The only problems I've ever had with guys 
approaching me is when he just won't leave me alone, otherwise it's cool.  
Unfortunately, the most annoying tend to be high or drunk.  Many people who 
are cool when sober can be most difficult when high.  In short, my only 
problem with people approaching others is when they go about it in crude and 
incessant manner.

What I don't understand about the "rave" scene, and about this thread, is
why people seem to think that PLUR and sexual attraction are mutually
exclusive. Granted, there is a sleazy way to approach that attractive
someone, and it's very often found in your "meat market" type places. I
admit, this can be very offensive. But it's really a matter of how you
approach the person, isn't it? Granted, many people, no matter how
respectfully they are approached, are not interested in meeting anyone -
but if that's the case, then they should say so politely, and the other
person should take the hint. There seems to be an attitude among many
people on this list, and people I've encountered in the scene, that you
can't mix PLUR and approaching that attractive someone out there on the
dance floor. And I have to say I don't agree. Discuss?

	Unfortunately, my copy of this article has been recycled. My
understanding is that the boat did turn around to search for the two
who went over, and that they did call for help, but they didn't stop
the party. Anybody got better info? Anyone who was there?

racist ? i don't know, maybe. what i am is a white boy, so it's my
perogative to talk shit about white people. just like Margaret Cho can get
up on stage and talk about asians, or Eddy Murphy or Chris Rock can talk
about blacks. actually, the last time i saw Chris Rock he was throwing the
word nigger around quite a bit, and since he's black that's his
perogative. that's how race relationships work in america.

 I don't know..   I was "frying my ass off" way before the ravE scene
transpired (or should I say, got this popular?) Fug-it, I was frying my
butt-ox off way before the 9th grade..  There, I didn't mention a
party/rave at all!
 Anyways..  I don't know..  Are you going to make another label for these
kind of posts...?  Let me know..

Aww... Poor white boy has no rythm?  =[
Curious..  Does, a lack of rythm, actually make you a worse lover?  You

Would-be hero "had a big heart' 

Search called off for two men who jumped into Bay

Anastasia Hendrix
OF THE EXAMINER STAFF
Michael Dougan of The Examiner staff contributed to this report.

           As nightfall halted the Saturday search for two men who leaped 
into the Bay during a St. Valentine's Day cruise - a
           Georgia tourist and the San Franciscan who tried to save him - 
the would-be rescuer's family and friends painted a portrait
           of a hero time and again. 

           "He never had the desire to be a hero. He just had a big heart 
and cared about people and didn't want to see people get
           hurt," said Sean Ravenscraft, who witnessed the valiant effort 
of fellow security guard Ricardo Ortega Jr. 

           Starting at 2:05 a.m. Saturday, a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter 
and five search and rescue boats combed a 20-square-mile
           area from Hunters Point to Bay Farm Island in Alameda looking 
for Tavaris Willis, 20, and Ortega, 28. 

           Life expectancy in the 55-degree water is from four to six 
hours for a healthy adult, according to Coast Guard officials,
           who called off the search at dusk Saturday. 

           A Coast Guard spokesman said the search would not be resumed 
Sunday because all areas of the water had already been
           thoroughly examined. 

           Willis, a resident of the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, jumped 
from the third deck of the Jack London Commodore dinner
           cruise ship around 2 a.m. Saturday during a private party. 
Ortega, who lives on Potrero Hill, immediately climbed over the
           waist-high railing of the deck and jumped 26 feet into the 
Bay. 

           "There was all this commotion as I made way up to the deck, 
and then I saw Rick standing on the other side of the railing,
           and I said, "Rick, don't jump in after him,' " said 
Ravenscraft, who was working with Ortega that night. 

           "But he just looked back at me and took off," said 
Ravenscraft, Ortega's best friend. 

           It was a split-second decision that reflected a lifetime of 
trying to help others, say those who knew Ortega best. 

           Ravenscraft said that when a brawl broke out in a nightclub 
and someone wielded a knife and tried to stab him, Ortega
           grabbed the knife and handcuffed the person before any harm 
was done. 

           After an armed robbery at another club, Ortega chased the 
getaway car even as the robbers fired at him. 

           "He just always wanted to help people," said Willa Ortega of 
her husband. 

           The San Francisco firefighter said her husband was a highly 
trained expert in law enforcement. 

           Raised in San Francisco, Ortega graduated in 1986 from El 
Camino High School. He served several years in the U.S.
           Army after high school and was trained as a sharpshooter, his 
wife said. She added that Ortega won numerous military
           awards. "He was proud of them, but he didn't display them," 
she said. 

           Ortega worked as a community service officer, assisting 
regular police in various chores, in San Bruno before moving
           back to San Francisco and attending the SFPD's Police Academy, 
said Willa Ortega. A certified lifeguard, Ortega was a
           strong swimmer who regularly worked out at the gym. 

           He started his own security business, Panther Private Security 
Services, with Ravenscraft while waiting to land a job as a
           firefighter so he could work with his wife. 

           Hired those closest to him 

           Willa Ortega said he wanted to take care of those closest to 
him, which is why he trained and hired his father to work for
           his company. The two also played racquetball and loved to 
tinker with cars, she said. 

           Willa Ortega learned of her husband's disappearance Saturday 
morning after returning from work. Despite the fact that the
           search had not found him after 15 hours, she said she was 
still optimistic he was alive. 

           "I've experienced a few losses in my life and usually I can 
feel it when someone close to me has departed," she said. "And
           I don't have that feeling." 

           Ravenscraft said partygoers had complained Willis was unruly - 
accosting people and telling them he was the devil.
           Alcohol was being served to passengers over age 21. 

           Responding to the complaints, Ravenscraft made his way to the 
top deck - and finally arrived just in time to get a glimpse
           of Ortega leaping into the Bay. 

           He looked over the rail and spotted the flashlight that Ortega 
was holding when he jumped - its light bobbing in the water. 

           "My impulse was to jump in after him to try and save him," 
Ravenscraft said. 

           Instead, he ran to the first deck to get a life preserver and 
inform the captain there were two men overboard. Every minute
           seemed like an hour, he said, recalling his desperate attempt 
to flash the SOS signal with his flashlight to signal for help. 

           4 captains aboard 

           "It was a tragedy that never should have happened," said Capt. 
Ward Hornblower Proescher. 

           Proescher - one of four captains aboard the yacht - said he 
was horrified when he heard there were two people in the
           water. 

           "I immediately spun the yacht around, and in the water about 
75 yards away I could see the flashlight - one he had asked to
           borrow from me earlier," said Proescher, fleet commander and 
president of Commodore Dining Cruises Inc. 

           "We were so excited when we saw that and we started moving in 
that direction," he said. "And I thought Rick is going to
           be a hero, he'll be in all the papers tomorrow. 

           "And then the light went off. And we never saw anything 
again." 

           The music stopped. And the party turned panicked and somber as 
the nearly 500 partygoers ran to the rails to see if there
           was any trace of the men. 

           "It was so sad and eerie," said Proescher Saturday, looking 
out at the empty Jack London cruise ship docked in the harbor
           near Jack London Square in Oakland. "Everyone was calling out 
after them." 

           Willis jumped just as the 80-foot-long replica of a Hudson 
River steamboat - which had departed from Alameda - crept into
           the Bay from the Oakland Estuary, he said. The boat was 
traveling at 6 knots, about 9 mph, and the water was calm. 

           It's the first time since Proescher began sailing in 1973 that 
anyone has gone overboard, he said, calling such an event an
           "extreme rarity." 

           But he was filled with praise for Ortega. Even though they had 
just met earlier that evening, Proescher said he was
           impressed with the security guard's professionalism and 
personality. 

           Ortega did not work for the Commodore cruise line but was 
hired by acquaintances - promoters who sponsored the party
           as a commercial enterprise. Ortega had previously provided 
security for a rave party the same people had thrown at Cesar's
           Latin Palace. The Valentine's party was scheduled to last from 
midnight to 5 a.m. 

           "Courage and bravery' 

           "When I see courage and bravery like that I draw back in 
reverence," Proescher said. "This man is a hero. Who the hell
           else would have gone in there like that? If I were a guest on 
a yacht and someone went overboard, I would not be the hero
           that Rick Ortega was. What he did was incredible." 

           Leona Ortega, the eldest of his four siblings, said she was 
anxious but held a glimmer of hope that her brother was still
           alive. 

           "He is so strong, and he is a fighter, so we are still hoping 
and clasping our fingers and hoping for the best," she said, as
           she sat with her father by the phone. 

           "Who knows, maybe he did save this guy and they are somewhere 
just waiting to be found," she said. "Maybe he's
           unconscious. Maybe he's already in a hospital somewhere." 

           The family's stress was heightened because Ortega's mother is 
away visiting relatives and doesn't know what happened. 

           "We don't want to call her," said Leona Ortega. 

           Another sister, vacationing in Monterey, also does not know. 

           Willa Ortega said not knowing was the worst - and spoke of the 
many unanswered questions darting through her mind. 

           The Coast Guard will investigate the incident to determine 
whether anything could have been done to prevent it, said
           spokesman Bruce Pimental.

This article really touched me.  There are so many words that fill my head
about this tragic incident, but none that would do justice to the heroic
honor Mr. Ortega displayed.  A sad loss to our community and our world.
Although I don't have much to give, I'd like to donate money to this man's
family.  Could someone find out how to contact them?  A fund raising event
would be more than in order.

Drugs really do kill.

Well this is a ridiculously big shot in the dark, when it comes to 
finding something. I lost my head for a while, esp when I came up during 
the Thomas Michael (oh, how I love thee) set, but other than that I also 
lost my white sunglasses at love affair, and is 
extremely unhappy about it. Sad as it may be. So if anyone found it 
please please please contact me.

Otherwise had a great time, I wrote shit loads about in when I came home 
that morning, but somehow the msg didn't appear. mmmm, it was from my 
other account so does msg from non subscribed accounts not show???

I was in love with the visuals,the decorations, the lights. My friend and I 
bowed three times to pay respects to the wall of sound, which was much
 warranted. Didn't venture 
much outside of the imediate vicinity of the speakers. But I did manage 
to have a few SF raves sighting.

I "think" I spoke to Eric, and laura? Moshe, and I definately did hang

OK, OK, I'll kick down.  I got there late, around 2, and decided to make up
for lost time by planting myself by one of those big fans and freaking out
as hard as I could for the rest of the night.  Fun!  And hot, yes.
Strange...it was probably the least crowded event I've been to there, but
definitely the hottest and wettest.  Just more movin, I guess.  Music: good
thumping techno stuff, though occasionally monotonous and generally less
melodic emphasis than I like to hear--still plenty to get me jumping (of
course, I am one of those white people).  The 2x4 approach was interesting.
I was really glad to see them trying it out and broadening the DJing
horizon a bit, but I think it had some drawbacks.  The mixing, overall,
seemed more abrupt than it might have been.  Not less precise, but quicker
and with less consistency of feel or rhythm from track to track.  I didn't
pay close enough attention to the decks to say for sure that it was really
was due to the two-DJ arrangement, but it seemed like it.  I heard Deaks
solo the night before at SJDRS, and that was definitely smoother.

The "Dream Core" room was excellent, too, but what a difference!  Every
time I stepped in there I felt like I'd been teleported to a completely
different party.  The temperature dropped ten or fifteen degrees, the
humidity about 50%, the lights came on, the colors changed, the music got
all slow and funky, you could suddenly hear people talking...quite a shock.
I was actually more comfortable back in the Storm Core, but I wish I'd
spent more time chilling...everyone was cool, fruit was great, chai was
awesome--kept me alive all night--and grooves were fat.  Did I really hear
Fishbone?  Who put that on?

Great party.  I know because I found myself filthy and exhausted, wandering
the streets of San Francisco with the rising sun on my face.  That's a
sign.

There haven't been any reviews for Friday night parties, either...anyone go
to Infinitely One?  I was considering it, but by good fortune ended up at
St. John's.  Also a great party, that.  Congrats Starchild.  And what an
amazing laser.  It showed up at TLC, too, so I suspect it's a new Gateway
fixture.  Very simple, but what an immense effect.  It fit the long, high
body of St. John's beautifully--didn't come through quite so brilliant at
TLC, but still an excellent accoutrement.

I agree with John on this. Throwing another party for someone who may be an
inocent victim of our scene does not feel right to me. I would much rather
ask everyone who feels for this family and wants to help them out, to just
dig into your pockets, and take the $10, $20 or $50 you would spend on a
night of partying, and give it to them. Maybe even spend a night at home
with your family/friends that you would normally have been out partying.

Think about the impact of your actions.....just for a second, lets consider
the kid who jumped, and assume that it was a suicide, do you think that he
could in his wildest dreams thought that his killing himself could have
taken another mans life. Could he have even thought of the devestation to
the lives of a total stranger, that his actions could cause ?? I don't
think so. And to think that he might have been acting totally irrational
due to some drug induced state just makes matters worse.

I'll stop now before I get all worked up.

  Ok... maybe a bad subject line but I know there are an abundant number of
Jewish people on this list.  Time for a NRR event.  This one is on March 1st
at the Lawrence Hall of Science... check it out--

           *Havdalah Beneath the Stars*
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
            At the Lawrence Hall of Science Saturday, March 1st

               Begining @ 7:30 p.m.
          A Havdalah cellebration for the whole family.  Havdalah is the
closing ritual for Shabbat.  Join the East Bay Jewish community as we light
the braided candle, pass the sweet spices and celebrate the coming of a new
week.. together.

         Activities to follow ceremony:
    Sidewalk astronomy-discussion of Judaism and cosmology-arts and
crafts-music and dancing-and of course all of the Lawrence Hall of Science
exhibits.














------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
       There are a limited amount of tickets so if you are interested call
Jamie @ the center for Jewish living and Learning or the Jewish Federation of
the Greater East Bay at (510) 839-2900.  Tix are $7 dollars for adults and $5
for teenagers and children.  All ages welcome.
        Tix also available through CJLL or Afikomen Jewish Books & Arts.  
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

           You don't have to be Jewish to attend.  For those of you who have
never been a part of a Havdalah ceremony, or one in this large of a group, I
strongly reccomend it.  This is one of those events where you'll feel a
strong vibe between everyone there and even learn a thing or two.  It is very
spiritual, I hope to see some of you there, Jewish or not.  Until then....

         Hugs,

In a message dated 97-02-18 19:21:55 EST, you write:

<< In fact, I would have personally called *all* the radio and TV networks
 myself and clued them in so that they would be waiting to shove cameras and
 microphones into the faces of these promoters when the boat returned to the
 dock.
 
 But I was out of town this weekend.
 
 If you call Nomad's voice mail lines (one per area code, of course) all you
 get now is "Thank you for calling. Please leave a message and we we'll get
 back to you as soon as possible."
 
 That's quite a bit different from the usual "It was the most beautiful
 party in the most beautiful space with the most beautiful crowd. Thank you
 for all coming out 'blah blah blah'" type crap that's usually heard there.
 
 I really hope they stop having parties before anyone else gets killed
 (read: "collateral damage")
 
 So, who's going to tip off the media about what *really* happened?
 
  >>
     wayne, 
     you are the BIGGEST ASSHOLE on this list. what happened was tragic
enough without you trying to start shit with tom and stacy. don't you think
that they feel guilty enough over what has happened? now, you are trying to
place the blame on them for something they had no control over. no one could
have predicted what was going to happen the night of the party. they took the
proper precautions to make sure that everything would go alright.
unfortunately, something went wrong.
     what happened was bad for everyone. do you honestly think that you would
have made things better by making allegations to the local media? all you
would have done was made things worse for everyone... tom and stacy, the
victims' families, the scene....EVERYONE!!! what the fuck is your problem? hav
e a little compassion!!!! would you have the same opinon if someone would
have died at a FnF, a sunset, or any other party? i seriously doubt it. you
only feel this way because it was a nomad party. keep your personal conflicts
with people off of the list and GROW UP!!!!.

PLUR, (if you even know what this means)

I still can't figure out why you continue to be supportive of such swill
and you will flame me so vigorously in the name of defending them.

You obviously haven't been screwed by Nomad like I and many, many others
have. Well, keep hanging around them and your time will come. It's an
unfortunate trend I've found.

But then again this whole argument is moot -- since they've now produced a
party that put two people into their graves tangentically in the name of
greed I figure they'll finally give up and go back under the rock they
crawled out from.

I feel sad for the poor guy that jumped into the bay while out of his mind
-- but I feel even the most for the good samaritan that went over to save
him. His death was the real tragedy of the evening.

Speaking of benefit parties, I wonder how much $$$ Dumb and Spacy walked
away from that party with? 500 unfortunate Nomad victims (uh, oops,
'customers') x $25 = $12,500 gross. I figure they cleared at least $5,000.
Happy Valentine$ day.

Oh, and finally Dorena, I forgive you for calling me the BIGGEST ASSHOLE on
the list.
Yeah right, kill the messenger. Plur, baby.

That, exactly, was my point. When I was told "they" tried to get the party
going again ("the show must go on!") I almost threw up.

*That* would not have happened at a Sunset party. There's the difference.

I have the opportunity to get a nice price on some Gemini direct drive
decks... I think the model is the X800 (or something like that).. it's not
the brand new super high tech one... anyway, I was wondering if anyone had
any experience with these decks.  I am particularly interested in finding
out about problems with feedback or sympathetic vibration.
thanks
PLUR

PS:  I think everyone needs to be a little happier :) hugs!

Well, i think it can be cool as a conversation starter at parties, myself.
I can't say I agree with abuse though, but it can give perspective to 
someones views towards a party, because it can make *all* the diff at a 
party, sometimes.

for some reason i've never really heard of anyone having a good time with 
gems...the ones i've ever used at record stores (i think i might have 
used directs) were horrendous about noise nstuff (hi jeff!)...so i 
dunno.  

my advice would be to find Technics SLBD22K's if you can find them.  They 
were $100 brand new each and they are super small so they didn't seem to 
have that noise problem.  

Or you can just make yourself a real good 'have to'...go out and buy 
1200's.  and a good mixer.  then when you get that first credit card 
payment you'll be REAL motivated to find the $$  =]...

Ya know, this is out of hand.  How could it possibly be the promotors fault
that someone took drugs and flung themselves into the bay?  I think lines of
connection are being drawn here just because people don't like Nomad....and
that's just simply wrong.

Subject: Confessions of a techno newbie / it's gonna be all right
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I've been hearing a lot of concern about techno's growing popularity and what 
effect it will have on the whole scene.  I just thought I'd share my views on 
the subject, why I'm not to worried about it . . .

First of all, I'm one of the newbies myself.  I used to listen to (actually, I 
still do) alternative, hip hop, and r&b, and some other stuff as well.  
However, I've always been attracted to techno.  Sure, high energy and all that 
was okay, but the few techno songs I used to hear (the first being "Charly" 
and "Sesame's Treat," i believe) I loved.  I couldn't get enough of it, but I 
didn't have any friends who listened to it, so I didn't know where to go to 
get more.  Ravers were just people I saw on TV, I never saw one in real life 
before.

Then came along the infamous Prodigy and Chemical Brothers buzz clips, and 
Mtv's Amp.  It blew me away about how much stuff I had never been exposed to 
(not even the super popular songs).  I began taping Amp through my stereo, and 
I'd listen to the tapes 24/7 (this was the only techno I had).

I expected my friends to feel the same way.  So at a kick-back party I popped 
one of my tapes in.  First song was Orbital, i think, "halycon and on and on," 
whatever that songs called (I'm trying, y'all)  It did not go over well.  
"What is this???" they asked.  "It's techno," I say.  "Techno?  It sounds a 
little weird to be techno," they reply.  "It doesn't sound like the normal 
stuff."  "Normal stuff?"  I say, thinking they've known about this stuff all 
along, "What normal stuff?"  "You know, like Gina G and all that."

Needless to say, before the first song was over, the tape came off.  That 
leads to my first conclusion, that most people aren't ready for, or interested 
in, techno music.  My friends aren't that crazy about The Prodigy even.  They 
like the song, but they aren't going to be charging any record stores to get 
the new album.

When I came to school yesterday, I mentioned to these same friends that there 
was a rave last weekend (the loveaffair thing).  "RAVE???" they said.  "You 
should have told us!  We could have had hella fun!"  You see, most people have 
this idea of a rave being all about sex, drugs, and techno (and you don't have 
to be 21!!!)  Perhaps the media is responsible for this, I dunno, but it's 
supposed to be some grand, gigantic party.  And whether they like techno or 
not, they all like a good party.

However, I'm not too concerned with this either.  #1, you can't go to rave and 
not like techno.  I know my friends would become weary of dancing for over 2 
hours and never hearing Real McCoy.  #2, there are plenty of clubs playing 
HiNRG, alternative, industrial, house etc., that are much cheaper than a rave, 
within a reasonable distance, less likely to be broken up by cops, serve 
alcohol, and you can "meet people there--" the meat market atmosphere.  It'll 
take one or two raves before the average person moves on to something more 
appealing to them.

So if the music and the rave isn't turning them on, then what is?  What turned 
me on to techno was how simply sitting down and listening to the music could 
take me to a whole higher level--something that doesn't happen listening to 
most popular music genres.  Raves are only attractive to me because of the 
music, but especially that nonmeat market, superficial vibe so present in the 
r&b / hip hop house parties I've been too.  As for alternative, I could never 
dance to it . . . you can't express yourself like you can with techno.  You 
just bang your head or get in the mosh pit and throw chairs.  Not the same 
effect on the soul, imho.  But when I talk about how the music affects me to 
my friends, they think I'm going nuts.

>From someone who's on the "other side," return all your black gear you were 
going to wear to mourn the death of the scene.  Straight up, the american teen 
isn't going to trade in their Alanis Morrissette and/or Snoop Dogg cds for 
Orbital or even Prodigy for awhile.  I'm concerned about what might happen 
when they get bored with alt. and hip hop, but most likely they will create 
new forms of rock and rap to listen to, instead of turning to techno.

In other words, I think everything will be fine.

becalmacidrage   (<------it's an anagram)

P.S.  I'd like to 1.  apologize for waste of bandwidth, 2.  hear your views on 
the subject (even flaming, although I don't know what I've said to deserve 
it), and 3.  ask if there are any ravers in Sacramento who wouldn't mind 
hooking up with me and educating this poor ignorant girl about the scene 
(don't you feel sorry for me?  I have no friends w/ the same interests, I'm an 
outcast  *sniff sniff*)

Hello Everyone, 

		My name is Marco and I've been on this list for about a 
year now without posting once.  I think that my time has come although 
I've felt like posting before, but have not come across to it yet.  Well 
I won't talk too much about myself just because I know how boring it can 
be sometimes.  Anyways I'm from Toronto, and have been raving since early 
1995.  I've been to over 50 parties and consider myself quite addicted!  
I used to go almost every week, but now I just go to select parties that 
i'll know i will have a good time at.  ( I used to go to every party no 
matter how large or small just because it was a "rave" but now I usually 
choose the smaller parties, because that's where I usually have the most 
fun).  
I really like reading the posts to see what's going on in San Fran.  I 
usually can't say anything about the parties because I've never been to 
SF or any of these parties that everyone talkes about.  I just want to 
say that many of the people on this list are very bright and most of them 
have nice positive things to say, although this does not stop people from 
voicing their personal opinions, which is also fantastic!
Anyway's I look forward to posting more often, and getting to know more 
people on the list!  Much Love




Marco

Cybertribe,

I know some of you on the list already, but I felt I'd sort of reintroduce
myself as well since I just resubbed this past weekend (finally got a
computer at home!).  I had been out here visiting like 5 times last year
from the East Coast, and finally landed a job in Mountian View in October.
I spun at this amazing party in Newark, New Jersey, on the day before I
moved with Joey Beltram, Electric Indigo ( <----she is the fucking
*bomb*), Frankie Bones, and more.  I literally went straight from the
party to the airport got on a plane and moved out here with little more
than a suitcase and my records.

I've been devoting myself to my work and setting up my home studio, but
have managed to spin at two raves in the Bay Area, one in L.A., and one
back in NYC since I've been here.  I love the vibe and the openness of the
San Francisco scene, though.  The joy and positivity you feel at the
parties here is amazing.

I'm 25 and started DJing five years ago when DJ GeoffE and I started a
tekno club called the Freight Yard in Allentown, PA, that is still open
and running today.  Actually, it's the last of the original weekly tekno
parties on the East Coast with the unfortunate closing of Scott Henry's 
Fever and Buzz down in Washington, DC, a couple of weeks ago.  I've thrown
and helped produce hunderds of raves on the East Coast and it was very had
for me to leave my rave family and blood family.  I needed a chance to
experience something new and to change and grow.

Out East, people know me as DJ Mars, but out of respect for Mike (aka
MARS) from Frequency 8 and to avoid all the confusion the two of us have
encountered already using the same DJ name, I'm now just using my real
name when I spin (well, except for the Bagok Tribe's party on Mar. 29th).

I'd really like to get to meet more of you in the next few weeks, and if
I do, ask me for a DJ demo tape.  As I had said in a previous post, I'm
living in the City, and looking for a roommate, if you're looking, drop me
a message.  Also, if you're interested in hearing the rave history of the
East Coast or seeing every flyer for every event there, or just wanna come
over and listen to my record collection or the music I've been working on,
reply too!

peace and love and Spring and Summer,
Marshal

Just one more stupid promoter trick...

If any of you have received a flyer for Field Trip...

Please be wary.

This party is falsely putting DJs names on their flyer.

3 DJs: Jazz-E, Corey, and Leo were never booked for this event, YET their
names appear on the flyer.

Please avoid this party at all costs, as it is probably a scam, in addition
to the fact that they are showing an enormous amount of disrespect.

thx,
dnns

I got married over the weekend on a boat run by the same company, the
night after this incident.  The captain of our boat was the same captain
that piloted the ill-fated boat of the night before.  Apparently the
security guard that jumped over was a good friend of the captain.  The
captain saw the guard go over, saw that he had a light, brought the boat
around thinking he'd see the light, but never found either person.  Both
are still unaccounted for.  

The captain was hoarse.  He did our ceremony, but you could hardly hear
him.  Afterwards I asked if he had a cold.  Apparently he had spent the
entire night before trying to find his friend in the darkness...

Its been awhile since I have contributed to the list and I 
apologize that my response couldnt be to a more positive thread.  

First, as a promoter my worst nightmare is the thought that I 
should be forced to endure what the Nomad promoters did this past 
weekend.  To suggest that they are truly culpable for such a tragic 
sequence of events is both callous and absurd.  

That said, I remember the sense of disgust I felt when my friend 
(who was on board) told me that after approximately two hours the 
party proceeded.  Her excuse to me was, Shit everybody was outta 
their minds man and Doc and Jeno were there so the music had to go 
on.  In that instance, I do fault Nomad.

I think, or at least I hope, that people can accept the excuse of 
two possible deaths as reason enough to call a night quits. Once 
again, I was not on board that evening.  Had I been, I cant 
imagine that I would want anything to do with continuing the party 
under those circumstances.  Ive seen a lot over the years and I 
have to admit that sometimes the extremes that this scene offers 
can really scare me.  But partying after two people have died is 
not only sick but disrespectful. 

My sympathies are with the families of those that departed that 
evening.  Put yourself in their shoes.  I'm sure that they'd be 
very relieved to hear that the party was able to proceeded as 
planned.

-Sunny

I agree.
I would like to know if Nomad is liable.<--(spelling?)  From what I
understand, the boat that had the party is a booze cruise boat that
always has intoxicated passengers on it.  That's the business they are
in.  So, they must have insurance for things like that (The boat
owners)  I wonder how many people have taken in a leap off of booze
cruises in the Bay Area?  I'm sure it happens, just like people are
always jumping of the GG bridge.  The thing that stands out about this
case is that an innocent life was lost, in addition to the drug
casualty.  Does anybody have any facts about this?

How about-- large bodies of water and large numbers of people who aren't
very familiar with each other and may or may not have buddies with them
don't mix?  I think things could be okay for you if you knew all the folks 
you were inviting, or at the very least, they knew someone else there...
I guess that means underground, then.  But, wait-- shouldn't it be called
"Underwater" then?  ;)

Great little meeting of the raving generations:

It's a trip when a 32 yr old hooks with a 19 yr old:

During an afternoon audio sesh:

"Sounds like Kraftwerk samples"
"Who?"
"Man, if you only knew."
"Thomas Michael is the bomb."
"Who?"
"Man, if you only knew."

Then we jointly tripped to excessive Chemical Brothers - they will be
huge.

Can't wait for TM to show in Santa Barbara this Thursday!!

u are SO right about people creating new forms of music (ie new 
alternative/hiphop/ect) its already happening...  and its a good thing!

some people are just not down with progressive music (ie trance, 
breakbeat...) and they may never be...

personally i don't think mtv's amp, nor LIVE 105.3's transmitter 
adjustments, or ESPN's background music will ever attract a huge number 
of people to our scene... 
just a thought :)

Before I stopped, that was EXACTLY what it was getting to be.  So I
turned to the smaller raves with a known factor, friends of mine that
shared a similar desire to be with good people at a good event with good
music.  The people make the rave, and some of the people I was running
into were just not on the same wavelength or were so entirely messed up
they couldn't function anymore.  Not a lot of fun, that.

Nancy's comment stuck with me, too.  Yeah, I always bring fruit and
candy, but the last party I went to I got some pretty strange looks when
I was handing stuff out.  I found one person that was enthusiastic about
sharing an orange.  I sat down with that lady and had a wonderful time
chatting, giving a backrub, talking some more, meeting her friends,
laughing, etc. -- you know, that "Old Skool" stuff...

> It's over when it's just a party.

Amen, but that's just what it's turning into; the "beer bust" of the
'90s.

I like the new girls's attitude...

you have a very pure attitude towards the MUSIC. <-- kinda rare to find
someone who can truly and totally appreciate it these days, even the wierd
stuff. (observation: *everyone and their fuckin' mom* likes acid/breakbeat
house these days. I like it too, just so you all know I'm not just being a

Move to the East Bay. I keep getting this feeling that the "scene" is dead
in SF, given all the busts that have happenned recently... (input? people?)

And I don't *even* know what's going on in sacramento, but I hear rumors of
something a-brewin' up there... But the east bay, for now at least, seems
to be "where it's at."

take care,

I am going to jump into this snake pit because people don't really give a
damn about each other.  There is no respect for anything, and people take
the first opportunity to beat the fuck out of each other via , this, thing,
this ether crap.

Look, the majority of you wouldn't even use this type of tone when in each
others presence.  Practice in ether what you do in reality, and we'll all
get along better.

Time for the fight...(this has taken a very serious post and trivialized
it...now you've made ME mad! ) ;( !

Dorena,

PLUR means nothign to me, it means little to the majority on this list.
Let's start to face some real facts here.

PLUR:  You start out calling Wayne D. and asshole.  Can you please tell me
where the value is in callign someone names?  Wayne was expressing his
opinion about my post and his feelings toward the event.  Can't he have
whatever opinon he wants?  He never names the two promoters, YOU DID.  To
me, Nomad is an entity that throws parties, a posse, I don;t know tom and
stacy from spit.  Of course you told the whole list about who was who and
now everyone knows.

If Wayne has a beef with these folx, so be it.  There was no need in you
making this a public matter.  As for his feelings, maybe you and Wayne can
hook up and talk FACE TO FACE, and get to know his feelings, instead of
reading a post and inferring alot of stuff out of it.

PLUR: You said "keep your personal conflicts with people off of the list
and GROW UP!!!!".  I see, and what were you doing in that singular
sentence?.  You were doing the same thing you chastised Wayne for doing.
Practice what you preach sistah.

Look, I really don't care who who threw what party, who promoter X is, and
why they do what they do.  I don't give a fuck about Burning Man's mythic
mystical moments, I don't give a fuck about the next big party, or even
these days the next small one.  Somebody died, get it, someone passed away
as a direct result of, oh yes, THIS SCENE.  That is what can happen when
people are amatuers or are disturbed, or are novice crackerjackers; they
can lose thier lives.  That is what can also happen when the focus is on
getting high and NOT on the music.  If homeboy was concentrating on the
music, and had a responsible posse around him, we might be talking about
reviews of the party instead of the obituaries.

Stop trivializing two peoples death with trivialities of whose friggin'
party it was.  It DOESN'T MATTER.

responsible action:  Nomad should take pause, they should put an
announcement up with thier regrets and good wishes.  Next, they should take
some time off from doing parties for a while, and should spearhead a
collection effort for teh families of these two young men.  I will go even
farther, although this will NEVER, EVER HAPPEN.  Maybe this scene needs an,
oh my, ENTIRE MONTH OFF.  No parties, no nothing.  No music, no dancing, no
beats.  There are many more weeks of fun to be had, and maybe it would
allow people to re-connect.  People should do little get togethers in thier
houses, have a fuckin' cookout, a barbeque, listen to something other than
house.  Groove with your friends to some different beats, some different
music, talk about the things that have made a difference, talk about the
scene w/o actually being in it.  Talk about it w/o the latest
goa/house/trance playing as a backdrop.  Go hear some REAL music, the music
of nature.  Go cmaping, snowboarding, skiing with pals.  Yeah, smoke your
herb, drink your beer, hey even engage in some mushies, but do it in a
remote, yet very, very, safe place w a responsilbe posse who has your back
24/7 like a ripe as melon.  But like MLK said I have a dream, and like his,
I know mine will never be realized on a large scale.  Well sometimes a
dream is all one has.

Now can we please stop this incessant bullshit fighting.  I tell ya what.
If you want to fight , fight me.  I'm 100% down to clown, and can take as
well as give.  If you ain't up to that, why not just let it all go and just
get along.

Can we do that, for a little while...please.

Back to sensible commentary...

Audi 5000 and counting,
John

PS!:  All you PLURHeads; I wish you would practice what you preach.  If you
are calling someone names, pissing on someone, picking a fight, telling
others how to live, chastising others w/o constructive critique, and of
course all the while beating people over the head with that mantra, you are
looking like a hypocrite.  Practice the acronym or drop it from your
signature.  Spare me the brain cycles trying to figure out if words mean
anything other than a way to indentify yourself with a pop-mantra.  Action
ALWAYS speaks louder than words.

Much peace to you all! Out.

Becuase they are her pals or friends.  People will defend their friends no
matter what they do.  Nomad is not responsible for the actions of it's
partygoers.  I agree, they perhaps proper thing to do woulda been to change
thier message, but civility and humanity are not required in this scene.
Too bad, it is probably why the majority of parties have the vibe of piss
hitting water.

Her reality at this moment is that they have probably done fine by her.
Until her experience changes, she has no reason to change her view based
upon things that have not happened to her but others.  Yes, she may indeed
get bitten, but then again, maybe she won't.  But for the moment she is
happy, and she is allowed to be happy, yes?

She is defending her friends as I have defended my promoter pals.  I
understand her view in this.

These are NOT the only promoters who have had tragic things happen at thier
parties.  There are TOO MANY to count, but resat assured this is not an
isolated incident.  Before this it was Burning Man, and people were
defending that.  Whatever, they are no more guilty than anyone else g-money.

I strongly disagree, BOTH deaths were tragic.  One life is not worth more
than another by virtue of action or deed.  Any life lost is tragic, I'm
suprised you do not see this.

Name calling Wayne?  C'mon man, wassup with that? What purpose is served.
If you have a beef, you should take it to them and to their face.  I didn't
think SFR was in the bidness of calculating rave costs , expenses and
profits.  take it to them, I and others, could care less.  Me especially
since I *know* that unless you're involved from start to finish in ALL the
financial aspects, everything is PURE specualtion.

You HAD to put *that* word up huh?

Let me remind you what you said: "what i am is a white boy, so it's my
>perogative to talk shit about white people."

Exactly, so , IMO you don't have such rights when it comes to talking about
blacks.  You talked about Chris Rock, you could've paraphrased of bleeted
out the word and the message woulda gotten through.  I hate it when whites
utter this word, much less spell it out.

Before I start another race war nonsense thread:  Please be careful how you
post, my kid might be reading this list.

Thanks,
John

P.S.  Funny I could give a damn about the curses, the drug talk, but I
won't stand for racially devicive language.  Zero tolerance.  Be glad I'm
in a good mood today.

I concurr with Troy: it was excellent. I had a good time and really enjoyed
the music. Thanks for putting it on. I hope that you will be able to make
it into a regular event. I'd love to be able to bring some friends from
back home when they come out to visit at the end of March.

There may have been a couple of snafus, but I'm certainly not going to hold
it against anyone.

What was the actual order of the DJs? I know Slider wrapped things up and
Mudfoot was on just before that.

Terrence.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean any harm by that...  I guess that was sort of
inappropriate; it's just that I have been hearing so many tragic stories
as of late that I wanted to try to lighten up my public comments a bit.  I
started to feel incredibly depressed thinking about the fact that the
security guard lost his life helping another; that's about the noblest way
one can die (imho).  But I also find that rooting in sadness makes one
very bitter, and that looking for a shred of happiness in the face of such
sorrow tends to make serious issues easier to take, for myself at least.
My sincere apologies if my words offended anyone, I really had no
intention of doing so...

Hm.  So you're saying they have a nice sound, but overall they tend to
stink?  Gotcha...  ;)

I have to agree.  Tom and Stacy, regardless of what you think of their
parties, did NOT pick this guy up and throw him off the balcony, nor did
they toss the security guard off.  As for how much they made, well,
apparently some folks like their parties, otherwise they would get any
attendees at all.  Wayne, I like you, but this smacks of personal
agenda, something that I figured was beneath you...

As for the dollar figures, I've seen that boat and I chartered one
similar to it if a bit smaller, and I doubt they could have gotten 500
people on it.  Just my guess, but I'd limit it to 300, tops.  I welcome
corrections to that number.

> Nomad is not responsible for the actions of it's partygoers.

        I have to agree. Any activity has risks. We all take our 
lives in our hands every time we get in some car to go for a drive.
Without risk, we have no life at all.

On the other hand, I now plan on avoiding Nomad events.

> Before this it was Burning Man, and people were defending that.

        There's a difference between 2 deaths during a 5-day party
of 10,000 people, and 2 deaths during a 5-hour cruise of 300 people.

        Also, if you read any of the literature the Burning man people
put out, it said many times "fuck up out in the desert and you may die. 
Take personal responsibility for your own survival." and so on. I doubt 
the Nomad folk were putting out those kinds of warnings.

John, I have a lot of respect for you because of all you have done by
responsibly directing people down "the path."  You've really hit a
nerve with this one though.  The word is "nigger."  It is a word of
hate and oppression (which it sounds like you know) and thus, it is
veryVERY ugly.  The usage of this word in Tina's post was not what YOU
made it out to be.  I personally HATE the damb word and only used it
because I felt that I needed to in order to make this intelligible but,
for you to say that it is okay for African Americans to use that word
while other people shouldn't is wrong.  It is simply perpetrating the
sickness behind the word.  That itself defies PLUR which is a
philosophy of life quite a lot of us on this list live by each and
every day.

I understand and reciprocate the feeling.  Do you really NEED to
threaten in order for you point to be taken?  That's the way the last
sentence comes thru.  Personally, I'm always glad when people are in a
good mood!

> Nomad is not responsible for the actions of it's partygoers.

        I have to agree. Any activity has risks. We all take our 
lives in our hands every time we get in some car to go for a drive.
Without risk, we have no life at all.

On the other hand, I now plan on avoiding Nomad events.

> Before this it was Burning Man, and people were defending that.

        There's a difference between 2 deaths during a 5-day party
of 10,000 people, and 2 deaths during a 5-hour cruise of 300 people.

        Also, if you read any of the literature the Burning man people
put out, it said many times "fuck up out in the desert and you may die. 
Take personal responsibility for your own survival." and so on. I doubt 
the Nomad folk were putting out those kinds of warnings.

Interesting point.

I'm pretty much on the fence when it comes to these issues. You see I'm
1/2 black and 1/2 white. But I'm considered black because when you're even
a smidgen black you're treated differently by the general public. Although
I don't look black in most people's eyes I don't look caucasian either. I
look like a mix. This both to my benefit and against it.

It's to my benefit because I'm not assumed to be black and am not
discriminated against based on my appearance. It's against my benefit
because I hear all kinds of racist remarks from people who are oblivious
to my heritage. I've lost respect for A LOT of people this way.

But as far as the N word, it doesn't bother me if it's used in the correct
context. Meaning if you're quoting someone else and not using it to put me
down it doesn't bother me. His post didn't bother me. But I never use the
word unless I'm joking around with my friend who's also half black....

I think people are a little too uptight about how to call people of
certain races... like do I call an African american "Black" or do I call
them "African American".. I have friends who have a hard time with this.
But it's kind of upsetting to be called a color instead of a race. I never
call someone "white". I was raised by my mom's side of the family that is
caucasian and have most always had caucasian friends. But one of my best
friends is also half African American....  

I'm babbling....

All I know is that we're all the same color underneath... and we're all
related in one way or another.

We should all love eachother. There is no reason to not love one another.
Life is too short for hate. 

Hugz,

Byroni

A guy I work with is from Chicago (just moved here) and he said he knows a
lot of the DJs on the list... HYPERACTIVE is supposed to be awesome. The
others seem to be top notch as well. I'm definately going. Hyperactive
supposedly spins in fron tof 10-20k in Europe on a regular basis.

We should meet at this event before we go in. Maybe at a Dennys or Lyons??
So we can all meet and perhaps DROP at the same time? Hehe... then when we
see eachother inside we can greet and see the metamorphisis. What do you
guys think? I could even drive some poeple. I have a hatch back that fits
5.. and a few midgets in the trunk.

I agree that yelling to the media won't necessarily solve anything.

HOWEVER.

I am completely stunned by the fact that _no one_ did anything once
people fell overboard.  I hold the promoters, the ship captain, and the
partygoers responsible -- EVERYONE ON THE SHIP.

Here is the situation:  

Two people have just fallen off a boat into the Bay at night.  They are
*guaranteed* to be dead within five hours (hypothermia) unless someone
finds them, and could easily die much sooner if they're not good at
treading water.

The fact that everyone did not IMMEDIATELY stop what they were doing,
SHUT OFF the sound system and tell everyone to SHUT UP so that they
might hear the people who fell off (who no doubt were yelling their
lungs out),  call the Coast Guard and anyone else who would listen, tell
everyone to take those flashlights and glowsticks and start LOOKING for
them, is completely incomprehensible to me.

I know what I would be thinking if I was the security guard.  "Aw, fuck,
I'm gonna have to go save this asshole", so you jump out.  Maybe you
don't find him, so you signal back to the boat that you need help.

The boat doesn't stop.

You get to watch it slowly motor away into the distance while you
realize that YOU ARE GOING TO DIE if they don't turn around.  You are
yelling your lungs out.

But everyone is too self-absorbed to care, and they can't hear you
anyway, and the sound of laughter and "thump-thump-thump" slowly fades
off into the distance.

Within full sight of the lights of San Francisco, you are dead.  But you
get several hours to think about this.

Piss on everyone on that goddamn boat.  And if you can't figure out why
I'm angry, piss on you too.

Put out, it said many times "fuck up out in the desert and you may die.
Take personal responsibility for your own survival." and so on. I doubt
the Nomad folk were putting out those kinds of warnings.

I totally agree.  Frankly, it is a testament to the folks who participated
in Burning Man that more people didn't die.  The playa is a VERY dangerous
place, and not for the typical drug-partyer that we all know and dislike.

As a note:  It is absolutely disgusting to me that the party resumed after
the two people disappeared.  This "party must go on" attitude is a perfect
example of the facile, trashy behavior that many of us older (20-something)
folks don't like about the scene.  We want music, conversation, dancing,
and a good vibe.  We don't want gangsters, dealers, and tweakers who have
no conception of reality.

"Underground" doesn't mean "lacking any sense of morality", does it?

It's long been my belief that promoters are responsible for what happens at
their parties. The promoter picks who they 'market' to, they pick who they
let in and they either do or do not facilitate some form of what I'll call
magick to  protect the party and those who attend it. Might sound wishy
washy and new age but I've been to plenty of parties where I felt safe and
protected and I've also been to plenty of parties where I could feel random
violence waiting to happen, and it all, quite literally, begins with the
promoter.

A whole complex of things including the promoter's intentions and
awareness; the people at the party, their intentions and awareness; things
done before, during, and after the party to direct all of the above toward
a positive result, ultimately shape the energy that guides and informs the
party.

I would call turning the music back on with two people overboard, the
actions of people not terribly tuned in -- to anything.  How I would feel
as the parent of one of those missing were I to know this, horrifies me.
What could there possibly be to celebrate at that point? If this did in
fact happen, ultimately, no one but the promoters can be held responsible
for that decision.

Anyone facilitating the gathering of hundreds of people most of whom will
probably be out of their heads must have no illusions about their
responsibility for creating as safe and as healthy an environment as
possible.

Whether or not, as the promoters, Tom and Stacy should be held legally
responsible, I hope that, to the appropriate degree, they do feel
personally responsible: they invoked this voyage, and none of it would have
happened had they not. Oonly they will know if they did *everything* they
could to make it a safe trip. If they did, the deserve our sympathy, if
they did not they deserve our wrath.

yours in deep regret

THANK YOU for reprinting this, and for everyone else who responded about 
how much was actually done to try to save these two people.  I'm sorry if 
I offended anyone by jumping to conclusions.  I had gotten the wrong 
impression from some things said earlier about the party "just going on."

I haven't yet read the posts on the possible memorial party, but I'm 
willing to help.  Now's the time for us to pull together as a community :)  

Love,
Nancy

YEP!!  I notice that the biggest parties refrain from putting price on 
SFR, their fliers, or their voicemail.  I just assume $25!

I remember one party at Pittsburg Skate that was a major-surprise $25 -
but at that point, everyone had driven an hour so they just shelled out
the cash rather than turning around and driving back...  I wonder how many
would not show up if they knew how much it would have been!  (The major
reason behind price secrecy, I imagine).

I've been gone for a couple months, but I'm surprised at all the s.bay 
organizing that's goin on...maybe we aren't throwin the parties down here, but 
there's a lot of hard-working and enthusiastic people down this way..

John,

Your words ring very true.  I agree wholeheartedly that people really need 
to take a break for a moment to reflect on what has just happened.  You're 
right about raving becoming a crutch to many, a shield people can hide 
behind to excuse their actions, or hide from the truth.  As a group, ravers 
in San Francisco have taken their place for granted, we all keep saying 
things like peace, love, unity and respect, but how many really know what 
these things mean?  I would like to believe that we all know the answers, 
but unfortunately, this is not the case.  I have only been on sfraves for 2 
days now, mostly to hear chat about the local scene, and to see what people 
had to say about the weekend, including the Splish cruise.

I'll say that I'm a bit suprised at the attitude of the posts found on 
sfraves.  At one time, sfraves was filled with people that were really in 
tune with what PLUR meant, before it became a buzz word.  Now I hear people 
saying PLUR like its going out of style, like it is just another passing 
fad, or secret handshake into the underground community of ravers.  Well, I 
honestly do not believe that the majority of these people truly understand 
its meaning, or even what it represents to them.

Yep, it's definately time to take a moment to reflect.  What just happened? 
 Do people realize what kind of reprecussions might happen from this type of 
accident?

As far as throwing another party for someone who was just killed at a 
party...well I would like for us as a group to think of something a little 
more appropriate to do than raving our butts off for "charity."  This simply 
isn't enough.  If people really would like to honor the heroics of the 
security guard, or mourn the death of a fellow raver, we all need to look 
deep into ourselves, and find the true meaning of these past occurances, and 
what they mean to us.  We need to really talk to each other about it, and 
support each other, and take that moment of reflection throughout our 
community in the hopes that we can reach that person who might have a 
similar accident in the future.  It's all about education, not partying or 
charity events.  Those merely soften the blow enough to allow our conscience 
to move on with as little guilt as possible.  We simply cannot hide from our 
fears, we must each individually confront them, and only upon fully 
understanding our fears can we really move on.

Thanks again for you post,

Scott =)

I heard about this the night after I talked to a friend about the party.
One of the things that has really been bugging me about parties of late is
the ever present "Yeah that sucked, but it was still a great party!  The
DJ's ROCKED IT!!!" ;(

I said it during the Burning Man/Omar incident, during other episodes where
people had to be carried out of parties on stretchers, seeing people on
respirators, etc.  And usually some pollyanna will pipe up from the drug
induced euphoric moment with "Let's not concentrate on the negative..." or
the even more tepid and dumb "Let's not forget all the other GOOD things
that have happened...." ARRGH!!!

Maybe what needs to be done, instead of running away from this reality, is
to confront it.  Is to ask ourselves "What are WE doing?".  I remember
during many drug induced hours asking myself that same question.  What was
I doing crackerjacking when I coulda been home playin with my kid, what was
I doing in a dark ass club when I coulda been huggin' and snugglin' with
the wife, what am I doing while somewhere out there someone is hurting,
suffering, etc.  These were some of my "E" & LSD thoughts during my later
days of this scene.

Now I have no problem with people going out and doing the do.  I do not
foist the massive responsibilities I have, or my heavy thoughts on others,
but at some time we gotta ask why we do the things we do, and to what ends?
I mean, when someone dies, giving his life for a crackerjacker (who is
still a human), how important does the party become?  Someone has died,
someone was seriously injured, and someone might never have a daddy or
mommy ever again.  What up?

Does the party go on, or are we human enough to really take pause.  Take
time out to assess what is really going on....I'll tell you what's going on
these days, and I don't need to go out to know this either:

It is nothing but a drug party, and it has become the reason the majority
party.  That's it, plain and simple.  This scene has changed, for the worse
IMO.

Yes, there are pockets of "vibe" and "goodness" out there for sure, and I
know some of you are involved in various scenes or cliques that are more
positive.  But, alas, you are outnumbered and in the extreme minority.
Just a note.  Parties these days are all about:
#1 - Scoring the drugs.
#2 - Music
#3 - Friends (only those you'll see in the scene, cuz' you ain't hangin'
otherwise).

Once again, let me reiterate, this does not apply to everyone, but this
scene, as a whole, has become the biggest escape vehicle since television.
And we do know the value TV has in our society and the value-add it
provides overall to our society.  I think the same can be said of the
current state of our dance culture.  People die, and the party must go on.
People get hurt, hospitalized, and the party goes on.  Poeple will never
walk again, never dance again, but the party must go on.  Sick, sick, sick!

"Yeah man, I saw this guy get decapitated, but dood, fuckin' DJ SoAndSo
tore it up, and man, I had a great time, despite the fact, this guy is
fertilizer."  Of course, in order for us to feel better, a group of
genuinely good people will get together to throw a party to collect some
funds for whatever.  How ironic.  And this is often touted  as a way for
the scene to heal itself...yeah, let's throw another drug party, collect
some money then give it to the family.

You know, if I didn't know the people I do, if I were half as bitter as
some would make me out to be, I would have a mind to call up the TV
stations, the cops, and whoever else I could, and have them investigate
FULLY what happened.  But even *I*, with all my high falutin talk won't
step up to that plate. Ironically my honor to many of the people in all of
this means I keep lotsa shit to myself, and that is where it'll stay.

So I have my own little forms of protest.  I stay away from the majority of
all of this.  I do go to really small events, like @ the TOP, or even a D7
party every blue moon.  I would even probably go to Stompy if it weren't on
the weekends I have visitation w/ my son, His Excellency (I love my boy,
he's the BOMB!).  But crackerjackin' @ a party is OUT.  Being out of my
skull is OUT.  And socializing ONLY at parties is OUT, OUT, OUT!

Out of all of this what do we get:  DRAMA.  The drama of people losing
thier lives because of drugs & irresponsible use.   The drama of people
never being able to dance again.  The drama of people throwing benefits
(read drug parties) for the purpose of, er, healing. The drama of girls
snatchin' other girls men, actively.  The drama of guys and girls notchin'
up thier bedposts with the conquests of other people's mates.  The drama of
some mother, some brother, some father, some sister, some daughter, some
son, crying because the person they love will never come home again.

But the party must go on.  Damn, that DJ' really rocked the fucking 
house....

I need a Kleenex, an enema, and even more of a break from parties...months
and counting,
John

P.S.  These are my opinions and thoughts.  I will pray for both of those
people who lost thier lives.  For the person who got so high he would never
ever touch the ground again, and for the person who gave his life trying to
make sure that this person would see his tribe again:  My hopes and prayers
are with you both.  Peace.

"Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people
who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder
and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its waters... Power
concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will."

Frederick Douglas, 1857

I apologize in advance for assuming some things about the circumstances
of the party in my last post.  Probably some of them are wrong and I'll
get plenty of well-deserved flamage for it.  And it's very easy to point
fingers at others when it wasn't your decision to make, so I am guilty
of that too.

However, I look back at how I've reacted to previous situations in my
life (friend borrows my motorcycle and bails off it, etc.) and I have a
hard time believing I would have reacted as those responsible did.  It
would have taken so little effort to search more, and the cost of not
doing so was so high...

Note to self: the ocean is not a swimming pool.  It can easily kill you
through your negligence, stupidity, poor communication, or just blind
circumstance.  A boat is much more than just a relatively bust-free
location.

In fact, many things we take for granted are very dangerous (cars), and
many things that look dangerous aren't.

For instance, despite all the fires, explosions, machines,
flamethrowers, and mayhem at Burning Man, what did people get injured or
killed by almost without exception?

Motor vehicles.  People ran into trucks, got ran into by trucks, got
their tents ran over by cars (with them inside), and I think there was
one drug overdose (from rave camp).

 So let me get this straight..   The boat just kept on goin? Never stopped
to look for the Security Guard?
 It actually just kept on floating away, with the lights low and the music
loud?
 That don't sound like what happened.. But I don't know..
 After the main post of this thread, I greeved, and went on.. Did I miss
that much?
 I myself...  If I were on that boat..  I wouldn't of been having much fun,
knowing that we just left one brave person out in the cold water, a mile
away from shore to be eatin by sharks.. No matter how much beer I
consumed..

 Thats sucks.

Just a thought, maybe we can keep a black list of people that do that 
shit. Make them accountable.  Sometimes people just don't know, haven't 
been in the scene or area 
long enough to know about the unscruplous organisers. I helped CP101 for 
the sad sad story of Circa for their booklet, and I just felt like they 
were really really irresponcible and disrespectful. THEN I find out someone 
elst I know had the same expierience. Just a thought.

I don't know I use to be one of those who was like, "no comercialzation 
is GOOD! The more the merrier."  But now i can't bear the thought. I was so 
upset at the News Week article on the scene I wrote a letter to them. The 
reference to PCP was hurtful, and boy did I have to answer for it with my 
dad. I am 23 for Gog's sake! 

It's just when I was in HK last summer the scene pretty much changed. 
THey played all the cheesy stuff at raves, and it became a meat mkt. I 
couldn't turn on the TV without trance, techno, goa selling something I 
don't want to me. 

I would like to scene to get bigger and more popular, (more choices). But 
then you start getting the ;lager louts with their beer out on the pull. 
You know? Have you ever had to fiend of some drunk asshole in a rave? 
 The 
scene 
have mostly  been filled with people that respect the values of PLUR. 

If people can respect the ideals I would be happy. But with 
comercialization it always becomes sexualised, blah blah blah. You've 
heard it all before.

Q:How many ravers does it take to change a light bulb?

to be better.

Look, people are responcibkle for their own actions. It was unfortuante 
that it happenned at a party, in fact, at all. I am sorry, but nobody forced 
the 
boy to take drugs, or decided for what ever reason to jump. It was a sad 
senario, but lets hope we rememeber about personal responcibility. I am 
so sick of being baby sat in this world, because someone is scared that 
they would be sued.

I was in a party on a boat on New Years, once. Freezing cold, black tie. 
One of my best friend decided to go for a swim, fully clothed. Trust me 
it wasn't anybody's fault but her own. Fortunately for her, she only got 
pnemonia. But two other people we knew died that evening (not on the boat), 
with another freak accident. Things happen... it just does.

In case some people don't know, those DJ's are from Communique records in 
Minneapolis: on of the leading underground Acid/Techno labels in the US. 
Perhaps the best known is Woody McBride who has also recorded on a number of 
european labels and is, i hear, EXCELLENT.

I'm REALLY excited

Argh...Not that I'm an angel, but with Music this good you don't need to 
drop anything.

Let's not forget Jason Mouse from Boston who's playing in the Jungle room. I 
saw him last fall and he was dropping bombs left and right...

I think it shouldn't be you only. I think this list should have zero 
tolerance policy on sexism, rascism, homophobia, people who eat brussel 
srouts,  full stop. I 
thought it was all about PLUR. John I can always count on you!!!!!

Why do I always get in these conversations? Didn't I quit something else 
because of this, (those in the know knows...) and oh, THAT person that 
always emails me about this stuff, haunts me like zits at 14, I don't want to
 hear a word from you..... again.

hello all
my name is April.  Some of you know me. I finally got on line yay!!!!!  

I guess what i wanted to write about was what happens to people who do drugs
at parties.  it's not going to stop.  we all know that.  But maybe we can
educate those who do drugs.  I want to throw my first party sometime in the
near future.  What I want to do with the proceeds of the party is to make
pamphlets about the drugs people are doing. 
I guess the reason I think this would be a good idea is because I'll talk to
people who love 'e' and advocate it's use, yet they don't know what it is.
 about 75-80% of the people i know who do 'e' on a regular basis do not know
that it is a meth-amphetamine and that it has heroin in it.  
I used to tell people drugs were cool, but as soon as i found out what they
do to you, my views changed.  I've dropped 'e' three times, it was fun, but
it wasn't worth it, especially because i feel how it has effected me even
know, when i haven't done it in a really really long time.  
There are other drugs out there that are also harmful that people that people
don't know anything about, yet they still do them (GHB, Special K, Crystal
Meth etc...) Why would someone put somehting in their body that they don't
even remotely understand?
I'm sure i'm not the first person who has wanted to throw a benefit about
drug education.  i guess the kid in me is just asking for support and knowing
that there are you people out their that are willing to support me and my
friends makes me feel a lot more secure and my aspiration.
Hope to hear from all of you soon in the future!!!
Much Love
April :):):):):)

Subject: of course commercialization isn't all right--clarification
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

If it came across like I was advocating commercialization, sorry about that.  
I didn't mean it was all right, or it's good.  My point was that real techno, 
or the non-"cheesy" stuff is not very commercial at all, and it's not going to 
catch on like a lot of people think it will.

It sucks to get all hyped up about a rave, and go there and they're playing 
crap to cater to the people who just want to hear the commercial stuff.  
However, this means the DJs are selling out, and you know not to bother with 
them anymore.  And you also know to avoid those promoters.

If commercialization has any benefits, it is that the allmighty dollar will 
lure away all the fakers, and only the real ravers will be left.  And wouldn't 
that be much better for the vibe?

The same goes if the scene is bogged down by bad publicity.  If the media 
keeps talking about drugs & death that are sometimes associated with raves, 
this will scare off the people who don't know what the scene is really about.

But can we really dis the media for talking about the negatives of the scene?  
Haven't many of the threads on sfraves been discussing drugs, death, and other 
bad things that have been going on?  (not that it's okay for the media to rag 
on the rave scene like they've done in the past, and will continue to do)

I'm no philosopher, but I believe in the yin & yang concept . . . that in 
everything good there is bad, and in everything bad there is good.  
Commercialization and bad publicity are pretty horrible things that we'll have 
to face, but there may be a light (however dim) at the end of the tunnel.

I hate to say it, but no matter how much we discuss it, only the head honchos 
at Mtv and in the media are going to have any input how much commercialization 
and bad publicity is going to occur.  We can only try to address the results.

I'm human, I can and just might be wrong.  Feel free to give your opinion on 
the subject.

Miccaela
(p.s. thanks for all the support from those who responded to my letter.  much 
love to you all  {{{{{{{huggs}}}}}}})

I don't know I use to be one of those who was like, "no comercialzation 
is GOOD! The more the merrier."  But now i can't bear the thought. I was so 
upset at the News Week article on the scene I wrote a letter to them. The 
reference to PCP was hurtful, and boy did I have to answer for it with my 
dad. I am 23 for Gog's sake! 

It's just when I was in HK last summer the scene pretty much changed. 
THey played all the cheesy stuff at raves, and it became a meat mkt. I 
couldn't turn on the TV without trance, techno, goa selling something I 
don't want to me. 

I would like to scene to get bigger and more popular, (more choices). But 
then you start getting the ;lager louts with their beer out on the pull. 
You know? Have you ever had to fiend of some drunk asshole in a rave? 
 The 
scene 
have mostly  been filled with people that respect the values of PLUR. 

If people can respect the ideals I would be happy. But with 
comercialization it always becomes sexualised, blah blah blah. You've 
heard it all before.

Nailvarnish

Q:How many ravers does it take to change a light bulb?

A: 15, 1 to actually do the work and the other 14 to complain how it use 
to be better.

sometimes it's not so much what's being said, but who's saying it and 
what their intentions are.

it's pretty easy to tell where a Chris Rock live at the Apallo HBO special
is coming from, posts are another matter. sarcasm doesn't allways
translate well on the net.

or another example : some people jump off of a party boat. the promoters
head back to rescue them but decside to keep the party swinging. were they
coming from a place of callous, self-centernedness, or was it ther intent
not to create a panic in a tricky crowd control situation ? i don't know -

i think that one of the problems with race relationships in america is
that everybody's so quick to play racism police, for all the good that
does. 

if somebody says something that bothers me, or rubs me the wrong way,
instead of pulling a citizen's arrest, i try and ask the guy to elaborate. 
"i don't understand. what do you mean ?" maybe he's hip to some knowledge
that i'm not privy to. maybe he's just an asshole. and calling an asshole
for what he is doesn't really accomplish much ((espically in the mind of
an asshole)). but all it takes is a "how do you mean ?" for an asshole to
dig themselves into a hole and do your job for you.

"that word" :

i choose to use it to make a point. it's not a word that i've incorporated
into my vocabulary and something that has allways left a bad taste in my
mouth. i remember cringing when i read Mike D throwing that word around in
Grand Royal #1. it's like, "yeah, he's from Brooklyand, he went on tour
with Public Enemy and did Paul's Boutique, but he's still a white boy.
he's not allowed to use that word."

nazi, baby-killer, racist. these are buzz-words. they ignite powerful
emotions and kill most rational thought. use them at your descretion and
be very carefull when accusing someone of being one of them. 

some more thoughts on that word :

i remember thinking all throughout that LA soap opera thing that the media
representitives were fucking cowards for refusing to even identify that
word. if drug use is the 20th century equivilant of whichcraft, that word
has become taboo in a culture that holds little sacred. i think a lot of
polite racists use the word african-american and no one ever calls them on
it. though now after having now used the word in public i can see some of
the logic in that decesion.  

sometimes it's not so much what's being said but who's saying it and
sometimes it's not so much what you say but how you say it.

everything you do and say can be taken out of contex and used aganinst you
in this world. EBL ((i think i got that right)) is a perfect example of
that. they're that techno group that edits together video clips satarizing
conservative figures. check it out if you haven't already. 

i think Dennis Miller hit the nail on the head when he did his bit on
Perot's old running mate ((the first time around)). here was an educated
man, a guy who fought for his country and was tortured for it in a POW
camp, a guy who later came back home and was public crucified by his
country because he comitted one of the cardnil sins of our culture :
he was bad on TV. my old man was in Vietnam. i have a certain amount of
respect for any soul that finds themselves in that kind of fucked-up
situation, if for no other reason than i'm from a generation that'll never
have to worry about a draft. even so, i was busting up when Phil Hartman
was slagging on that guy's ass on SNL...

everything you say can be used against you. your entire essence as a
person and as a human being can be reduced to a 2 second sound byte in
this world. guy shoots 1 hour of material of good people getting down at a
party and 45 seconds of assholes drag racing on nitrus. what material do
you think Hard Copy's gonna use ? words have power, careful in how you use
them, espically when adressing the public. 

sometimes it's not so much what you say, but how you say it. that being
said, i'm out of here. despite the psychaphrenic whether of late, i've
been having a really good week.   

and yeah, i'm glad you're in a good mood too.

Hey party people, long time no post (and from a new address - how
confusing!)...

Yep, I've been here watching most of this time - hey to you who remember
me, and hey to all the people who've come along since I stopped posting.

I can't help but notice a beautiful waxing moon out there tonight.
Wondering if anyone has info on full moon events?  My calendar tells me
the full moon occurs on Saturday... anyone heard anything?

Thanks much, take care all...

This is exactly what I wanted to communicate -- but I was just a little too
agitated to slow down, collect my thoughts and deliver them in a non-biased
way as possible. If I would have done that, this is basically what I would
have wanted to say.

first off,
WELCOME APRIL! I love you tons!
Second off, 
Major props to our newest lister, she has a good idea. In fact she 
and I have talked about education regarding drugs many a time. The 
biggest thing for me is making sure we get unbiased, true, 
fact-for-fact information. Sad thing is, wherever I look, I hear 
"some experts say that MDMA causes spinal fluid to drain whereas 
other experts say it's the actual procedure of testing your spinal 
fluid that drains it." Yup, contradicting, confusing "facts." Nothing 
solid. So what to do?
	Also another thing to ponder is how to go about PACKAGING the 
information. The fact is, there are kids out there who just don't 
give a fuck what they're doing to their bodies, either that or they 
just don't want to know because they know it's bad. They will see a 
flyer saying "the facts about <insert drug here>" and find a reason 
to justify every negative effect the drug has on your body. ALSO, the 
flyers will be less accepted by people if it seems as if it's 
preaching "DONT DO DRUGS". I'm not saying it should CONDONE drug 
usage, because that's the LAST thing wanted to be done in this 
situation. By saying "BE SMART IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO DRUGS and here 
are some FACTS", some may say this is condoning of drugs, but it 
really isn't. The truth is, we have no choice over what a fellow 
raver is going to take at a party, we have no right to walk up to a 
person you don't know and throw their hit of E on the floor just 
because you don't believe in drug usage. All you can do is say "hey. 
before you do that, you might want to know a little bit about what 
you're doing to yourself and how it will effect your body and mind in 
the long run." if they don't want to listen, give them a flyer 
anyhow. can't say you didn't try. 
	I think you get what I'm saying... :)
Take care all and if you're going to Planet New Year's remake party, 
look for me, I'm gonna try to bring some strawberries :)~
Love and hugs and warmth,
Lara

 ummm, to be taken seriously and respected you need to educate yourself 
first. 

 E is not a "meth"-ampetamine. Someone correct me if I'm wrong on any of 
these staments. Methamphetamine is a specific chemical. E is a substance 
related to _amphetamines_. It is somewhat different as certain atoms 
have been rotated on the molocue chain to new positions.

 The chances of there being heroin in any E is incredibly small. Usually 
the caps or pills are far to small for an oral dose of heroin to do 
anything. There have been a lot of tests around the world (that I've 
heard of) that report _very_ few E's containing heroin. 

 While I appreciate your desire to help April, it is with educted 
decisions and actions that will bring about useful change. "The road to 
hell is paved with good intentions."

 Try accessing the Hypearreal archives for information on drugs and E in 
particular. There are several refrences to very good books written about 
drugs. I personally recomend the Psychedelic Encyclopedia by Peter 
Stafford to start. It has a good overview and again can refer you to 
other great books.

While E is quite different from others in it's family, it is still a 
methamphetamine and does have some similar nerotoxic effects. Also, if 
you've ever heard nightmare stories about meth-labs, E is just as bad as 
far as EXTREMELY toxic and environmental nightmare by-products.

Yet people continue to eat Twinkies, Slim Jims, Wonder Bread, and watch
Wheel of Fortune!  I think we should have a benefit party to raise money to
make pamphlets to inform people about these things.  And no, I'm not
actually poking fun at you, these are very scary things!  Welcome to the

Hey marshmallow peeps


Had a weird little dream last night.  No point to it, just kinda weird.
Dreamed that there was another Love A-Fair (I didn't make it to the first
one) to which I was in attendance.  All my friends were there (Amy, you and
Mel were there!), but there were only 200 people.  However, the party was
held at a Home-Base sized warehouse, and it was decorated amazingly!  It
looked like a huge funhouse or something, and it reminded me of what I
always kind of imagined the old Toon Towns would have looked like, it was
all just such fun!  We all ran around like little kids, laughing & playing
among the funhouse decorations, climbing all over stuff & such.  But it
seems like we were there before the party actually started, very strange,
cuz I don't remember any music.  Weird, eh?  A fun dream, I enjoyed the
party (thanks vlad! ;)

And that was all!  A silly fun dream.

Love
Shawna

My assumption is that "gateway's party" is Madness, as mentioned by the
Esteemed Mr. Rice in a previous post, which is this Saturday February 22nd,
sound by Gateway.


Maybe I *might* even make it! (gasp!)

MDMA = 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Supercala what?)

For thoughs of you in LA.
Read this, and call the number.
Maybe you can get some free E or something.
Although it probably won't live up to BayArea grade E.



We are currently recruiting subjects to take part in both of the studies
described above. We are looking for both male and female volunteers who
would be willing to invest the necessary time, energy and inconvenience
that participation would require. We are particularly interested in
identifying prospective subjects who have used significant amounts of MDMA
but have relatively little experience with other drugs. Our subjects will
need to be between the ages of 21 and 65, be in good medical and
psychiatric health and have had prior first hand experience with the self
administration of MDMA. The criteria that subjects must be health
professions was recently waived by the FDA with the stipulation that
participants be sufficiently knowledgeable of the controversy over MDMA's
effects that true informed consent be possible. Anyone interested in
participating in these studies can call our research coordinator, Carla
Edwards, at (310) 222-1663.

"Johnny, don't go out and do drugs now...by the way, wanna go to Burger 
King?"

"Make sure you stay out of trouble...I know I will...I'm going tostay 
home and watch Oprah and Geraldo and find out what's really WRONG with 
the world."

Friends,
	This party last saterday was an incredible experience I've 
had not before.
	1)	Got there during Andrew Lucero's set. While waiting
in the parking lot , my friends (family) and I got the butterflies.Weird.
	2) 	The visuals were UNREAL. From outside I thought they
were projected screens, but later realized them to be projected
on everything. Huge PROPS.
	3)	Then Thomas Micheal went on after Andrew Lucero. The
first thing I thought was this guy looks a lot like John Lennon.(no
offence intended).But this guy fuckin tore the shit up! This is the 
kind of techno that starts wigglin my head, then creeps down to my hands,
then my waist starts  doing the Heebee Jeebee. Completly out of
Control. My feet would not stop. The hairs on my body were dancing on
their own. Again UNREAL.
	4)	After about an hour, My body said "Time to chill". I am
waay out of shape. So I go to look for B))marang . Never met him before.
I'm looking for a guy with a tie and I find one, but his name is
Miguel. I am way off, so I go to chill on some bean bags with my brother
Gaby and his girl friend. Then all of a sudden these people come and
ask me if they can lie down with me. They treat me as if I known them
for years. What a great feeling. 
	5) 	I go to find B))marang again and he is all ready 
spinning. I say,"Boomarang". He looks up and I say,"DJ vertiblaaahhh".
I made no fucking sense, I know. I get real excited when I meet Sfravers.
When I realized what I did, I just chilled and did not want to interupt
his set.
	6) 	Then I see Leslie, Whom I met before. I LOVE talking to
this lady. She is just stimulating conversation. And when we were
talking I look down, to find a bag of candy. A bunch of jolly ranchers 
and such. She must be good luck.
	7) 	During this time, someone fell to the ground sick and a
bunch of us tried to move him to the back successfully. It looked as if
he had to much to drink.I believe he is fine. 
	8)	Around 4:30 Leslie and I go to listen to Johndabombs set.
This guy is in such control. Props to him. I believe there were other
Sfravers there but I did not Meet you. I was the big Mexican with
white pants, White hat, goatee with no mustache, and wearing a multi-
colour vest. If you saw me I'm Vertigo (aka Memo Lemus). This is the
closest I've come to meeting Sfravers and as minimum as it was, it 
was the best feeling. I hope to meet more of you, soon.

					Pure Love
					VERTIGO

firstly:
HI APRIL!!!!!!  Nice to have ya aboard!!!

secondly:
I'm all for drug education.  While working in the dorms I tried to
distribute drug info (not pro or con, just info) so my residents could
make their own educated decisions.  So I'm for it.

thirdly:
what is the deal with everyone talking about heroin in their e?  I would
think that since heroin is most effective when snorted or injected (from
what I understand) and heroin is not very cheap, why would someone
'cutting' MDMA want to put in heroin?  It just doesn't seem like a smart
business decision to me.  :/  If it is actually happening then I have on
ething to say to the folks doing it:  stop!  I don't want to hear about
anyone else getting heroin in their e!

This is Nick's research as of 1994, but I doubt much has changed since
since heroin is (probably) still more expensive than E and thus it doesn't
make sense to "cut" E with heroin.  I can ask him if anything's popped up
recently, however.

Education is a good thing.  Just be sure you know what you're talking
about.  Giving out medical advice if you do not have a medical background
is not a good idea.

In your opinion, sure.  That's a wonderfully valid opinion to have - in
fact many people feel all you need is a couple of times with the right
set/setting and you've basically obtained all the benefits which there may
be - sorta like reading a really good book.  Ah, but I see you didn't like
it - the book metaphor still applies, not everyone is a Shakespeare fan.
Just so long as those non-fans start telling us how Shakespeare shouldn't
be read, or is "bad for you", I'm fine.

About 5 years ago a really excellent flyer was produced by some
then-SFRavers called "Info-E".  I can't find the original online but it
has been recently redesigned with the same information, and is available
at < http://www.hyperreal.com/drugs/infoe/ >.  Some of the information is
outdated but none is completely invalid.

In my opinion a "rave about drug education" is not the most effective way
to educate folks, since parties are about dancing, music, and non-symbolic
communication, whereas "education" is about broadcasting a message.
"Thump thump thump hey, crystal will mess you up! thump thump thump"
Write up some flyers like the Info-E folks did, and you can get across
some simple concepts; but if you really want to /educate/ folks, create a
resource that is deeper than that, and make sure you have all the facts.
That's why there's an archive of drug information on hyperreal, so that
people can read and learn about them, both the good and the bad.  

I completely apologize if the tone of this response is somewhat smarmy or,
er, "harsh".  I didn't intend it to be - this is just a subject which I
take particularly seriously, and hope others will too.

Look it up rather than rely upon rumor.  It's all online.

  http://www.ecstasy.org/e4x/e4x.ch.06.html 
  http://www.ecstasy.org/e4x/e4x.ap.01/e4x.ap.01.007.html

No "experts" claimed MSMA drained spinal fluid, that was a
misinterpretation of a research report by a pop journalist.

umm...im in a hurry, but i saw something about not giving medical advice 
unless yer a doctor.  

that's probably good.  however...i've met some people out there that know 
more about keeping the body healthy than a lot of doctors out there.  so 
i would choose your doctors wisely.  

***for instance...

i have a friend who was rushed to a hospital because his body was 
swelling.  they told him he had a toxic liver and they needed to remove 
his gall baldder.  he kindly refused that offer...he asked them if there 
was anything he should do different for his diet and they said, "no it 
doesn't matter what you eat."

he went to a cancer clinic in mexico and cleaned himself out naturally 
with herbs.  

i've heard that in these cancer clinics they have an 80% cure rate.  the 
only reason the other 20% die is because they've already convinced 
themselves they're going to die before they even get there.  

***disclaimer...im not a doctor.  but my good friend who is a doctor has 
told me it's ok to be a healer.  so i can offer a little info here and 
there.  but if it's too complex, im gonna pass you oon to someone that 
really knows what they're talking about.

With all this stuff of whats in E thread, educating the masses on drugs
and whatnot one must really remember...

What you buy off the street, is off the street:

This stuff is being made/cut in anything from really elaborate labs
(that look REALLY clean and pretty), to kitchen sinks (next to dirty
dishes and old food).

		Belive me...
  
I think that the best way to caution people would be to inform them that
what they're taking may/maynot be pure (again it is doubtful that X is
cut with heroin due to the expenses, on the other hand, it's doubtful
that a dealer would use crushed glass (remember THAT one old skoolers)
to cut his E as well. The usual inert ingredent is MOM (milk of
magnesea[I know, sp]).  But then again a whole 'batch' of anything could
turn up bad if not cut enough (anyone else remember the 'China White"
deaths in LA in 91???).  I've even went 'puffies' when tokin' on the
ole' Jnt and told later it was laced with opium (and that one was
w/friends who "forgot" to tell me).

Caution peoples, if you wish to alter your perception with syntehics...

Fuck PLUR first of all.  Now that that is out of the way, did I say it was
OK for Africans to use this word?  And BTW I was referenceing Mike Bolgers
post.

I stand by what I said.  The fact you thought I was talking about someone
else is evidence you did not read the post.  Also your inference that I
said it was ok for one group to use it was just that your inference and
jump in logic.

I also despise the fact that you DARE say the shit to me again, to make a
point.

How about this asshole...fuck off.

Also, kiss my ass.

And oh yeah, FUCK PLUR!,

Good insight as to what my son will have to deal with when he gets older.
I guess I look at being bi-racial as THE best place to be in this couldron
called America.  I eman, you defy classsification, so I guess "human" would
be the best bet since you are an amalgam of all things.  This is the right
direction, IMO, this country and the world needs to go to get away from the
severe tribalism we are constantly embroiled in.

Indeed and understood.  Funny how people will really show their true colors
if there is no threat of retribution.  Much like cyberspace, where nobody
knows who or what you are or may be.

Funny, that dumb MCI commercial that touts all this "On the internet, ther
eis no race, no color, no this no that..." and my SO and I laugh since it's
obvious that what they're trying to say is "hey you don;t havre to deal
with these very REAL issues with our country if you're on the net.  You
become and amorphous blob of bits.  Finally a real escape from our everyday
contrcut of isms we've built around ourselves.  Now there are no problems,
as long as you stay in cyberspace.  Now as for gettting a loan for a new
house?  That's another problem. ;)

And thus the dilemma many whites and some blacks have with the word.
Whites,especially the younger ones who did not have the benefit of going
through the civil rights struggle or integration, don't understand the
paradox.  Simply put whites used the 'n' word to objectify and opress
blacks.  So the word has a certain power when a white person utters it.
That is why there is such a halting gasp when a white person, especially
those in power like cops, or business mean (read TExaco) use the word.
People understand that there are other implications due to the blanace of
power.  Now two African-Americans who may use the same word doesn;t have
the impact.  First we took the word, and created our OWN definition of it,
thus taking the sting out of it.  Giving the word another purpose than what
it was orignially intenede for.  Whites, because of history, do not have
this benefit. Why?  History, and please read what I said about the word
before.  No it may not be correct, to some a word is just a word.  But
often it is who uses the word that counts.

So homosexual men can call eachother f*g, I cannot since I am heterosexual.
Women can call each other a b*tch, I cannot, I am not a woman.
Whites can call each other wh*tey, I cannot I am not a part of that group.

Se how it works, there arte dozens of examples, and if people took the time
to realte to something other than bits, they would know this is common
practice in the real everyday world.  Now I am not saying it isn't fucked
up that such a paradx exists for mere words, but words are very, very
powerful, and have great weight.  Our Constitution is just words, but they
have a power when weilded.

Sorry people, words are NOT just words.  If they were, we wouldn't be
having this discussion.

No you're not.  I dig where you're coming from brotha.  AThis Amerikkka has
really fucked things up for the lot of us.  We are actually dealing with
the consequences set into motion hundreds of years ago.  And unlike South
Africa, we have YET to deal with our issues in a forthright manner.
Whether this be racial ineqaulity or gender inequality, we are light years
behind the ideal of the constitution that all people are created equal.  In
this country the only eqaulizer is money, and the more of that you have,
the more rights you have.  The converse is also true.  So is the Nike and
Rebbok and thge Adidas. :).

In reality, race is a social construct created by Europeans during the
18-19th centuries.

There is only one race IMO, the Human Race.  Until we all get to that
point, we'll continue discussions like these.

Like I said, warnings or no, two people dies during a party.  Loss of life
is a terrrible thing.  Especially if it happens during a so-called

Let's put this question into play:

Why would a MDMA cook put heroin in extacy when the cost of heroin is much
more expensive than the MDMA?

The only reason a drug would be cut with another drug is to lower the cost.

I want to publicly apologize for my language and tone to Mr. Jordan.  It
was uncalled for and was written before I had my mroning coffee.  That is
NO EXCUSE for my behaviour or the mean-spiritedness in which that post was
made.

I'm gonna lay off for a little while, cool off, and do some other things.

I hope that Mr. Jordan will accept this public apology.

I also apologize to the list for that bombasticism & vitriol.

Much peace and love today my brothers and sisters,

Hello, Everyone :)
I'm soooo excited about my weekend, and I'm looking forward to the Planet
New Year Makeup Party.  :)  I know there are a lot of people who are
probably going to say something like "Coolworld sucks" or something along
those lines, but I say, I'm going to do what makes me happy :)  Ya know, I
regretted having chosen to go to Love A-Fair before I even got there.
There was soooooo much negative vibe about it that I was wanting to sell my
ticket so I could go elsewhere and avoid the "nightmare" that I was sure it
was going to be.  If my cousin and his friends hadn't wanted to go, I would
not have gone.  But ya know what?  I went and I had a WONDERFUL time!!!  I
loved every moment of being there, and best of all, I talked to lots of
great people that night (HI, Lara, Eric, Yam, Baljeet, and everyone else I
met!!)  So, as they say about the net, "It's the PEOPLE, Stupid!!" :)  In
the future, I'm not going to listen to any of the negative vibe about
such-and-such promoter, and I'm going to go wherever and make up my own
mind where I want to go.  Thanks for listening, and sorry about the
bandwidth....Have a great day, and take time out to smile!! :) :) :)
Love and slinkys,
Thomas

PS-I will be the 5'7" guy with the glitter all over his hair and face, and
prolly some extra thick eyeliner like I had on at Love A Fair (and blinking
red lights in each hand) ....don't know about the clothes yet....Hope to
see ya this weekend, and say HI if ya see me!!!!

PPS-Are we going to count down to midnight since it's a Planet New Year
thing??  Just wondering if I should bring my noize makerz :) :) :)

One of the reasons I went ballistic is I said I didn't like the word, AND
you didn;t give a fuck.  You went ahead and used it, in an attempt to
de-sensitize me or teach me a lesson, or to make a point.  I hate that kind
of condescention.  And I hate it when you go about spouting that PLUR junk,
yet in an instant DISRespect me by using the word n****r.  See it's a two
way street.  You can't expect me to have much respect for you if you dis me
by using that word.  You have got to respect one person if you wish to have
that respect returned.  That is how I live my life.

And I never said it was OK for anyone to use the 'n' word other than
blacks, you inferred it.  But one must admit it is not so much the word as
much as who weilds it.  There is plenty to back me up and I've addressed it
in other posts.

Gay brothers can call each other f*g, I cannot.  I do not belong to the
group that has taken the wpord as it's own.  By me using the word, it
becomes and insult.  Why?  I am not part of the group. As a matter of fact
I am part of the group that uses that word usually to insult or hurt those
brothers who are gay (i.e. heterosexual).

Same with other groups.  And that is the point.  No sir, it is NOT just a
word.  There is no such thing.  Words carry great weight and great
consequence.  Ask anyone who has dared, in these days to utter that word ,
the 'n' word to someone who has not accepted you as part of the group.  A
fight would definitely ensue in some areas, or you might be chased.

I do not threaten.  I know how I can be, look at my last post to you.  Fact
is, if I get a bug up my ass, as I did previously, I turn into Mr. Hyde,
and it get's really ugly.  There is no doubt that I have a strong duality.
One part is logic, reason, and reasonability, compassion, understanding.
The other is a pit bull & rottweiler mix, just beneath the surface,
waiting.  I have, until recently, been able to keep my dog in check, but
sometimes his head gets out of the gate.  I put him back in now and muzzled
him just to communicate with you.

See, deep down inside, I don't like dogs that bite either.  Although I
certainly do love brother Neils who never rests until the wicked are at
bay.  Now that man there is a warrior!

Really?  Are you certain?  You mean:

-There have been no lynchings?
-There has been no racial discrimination?
-Whites hardly use that word anymore (at least the whites who are in power)?

No sir, it is more than a word.  Ever study Kabbalah?  Words are NOT just
words, they can bring life or death (and please SPARE em the X-Files
reference.  I knew about Golem before I became a Jew and certainly before
those writers who do X-Files).

who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder
and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its waters... Power
concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will."

Frederick Douglas, 1857

Yes, I admit that I did make a mistake in mixing-up Tina and Mike's
posts.  Tina, Mike and others I am sorry.  John, you really have a lot
of hostility in you - can you say karma?  I have nothing more to say as
I make it a point not to let people like you drag me down to your level.

Have a nice day,

p.s.  Just because this guy doesn't believe in PLUR doesn't mean that
you others should be affected by him... believe in what YOU want to
believe (it's your reality!)

John, apology accepted!  As I hinted at before, I have followed your
posts and replies for some time and I've always found them to be
intelligent, thoughtful and responsible.  I can understand responding
to a post at a bad time - I think most of us have done such things
before but, it takes a special person to apologize.  Thank you.
I can agree to disagree.  I can be very wrong and I just might be. 
Unfortunately, some of the things we discussing involve a lot of
emotion, both historical and contemporary.  I do understand your views
on the subject, I don't agree with all of them.  I believe that we can
shape our own reality if we try hard enough.

Peace,
-SoNiC


p.s.
I also think that I'm taking a  break for a while now.... if any one
needs to contact me please jot down my email address now, as I'll be
unsubscribing today for a month or two (gotta concentrate on other
matters!).

Love you guys.......

Heroin is easier to obtain, but you are definietly wrong about the costs.

Also, the heroin usage rate has dramatically increased over the last few
years, as cocain has been much more difficult to get ahold of.

There are alot of people besides ravers who use drugs, and just because
ravers don't tend to attract to heroin, it doesn't mean that the rest of
the world doesn't.

Heroin in extacy... pure myth.

How do you know for a fact that E sometimes has heroin in it? It is more
likely that you have heard this floating along the grapevine, just like
everyone else.

Usually in any venue that is a bar or club they throw the lights on 20min.
before closing so they can get all the bottles and stuff cleared. Plus its
usually last call for all us drinkers out there... =)

I Just wanted to drop a few lines seeing how there were not that many reviews
on TLC it was such a good party, The DJ's rocked all of them big ups to: Maya,
Deaks, Tim, scott, sabine, and who ever else I missed you guys made my night
thanks. I was glad to see all of you SFR's there like Micron, deepfog, Ivan,
Anthony, (Anthony's friend & his G/F) Ethan etc.. the lighting was great the
chill room was nice and kewl, tony kicks ass!! one thing it was very hot but
they had a good amount of fans to try and combat that. I love the dance studio
probably one of the best spaces in the city besides the Indiana ST.space.
I can't think of to much else other then it was a superb party I look forward
to the next one. BTW Scott (or any one else) I need Ernies number so if someone
has it can you please E-mail me privately with it. That is my $0.02 and my late
review.


peace every one,

Macadio

thanks to brian and wayne for clearing this up.

People should REALLY read up before spouting off mis-information.  I'm
not picking on anyone, just pointing something out.  It seems like there
is a lot of mis-information on here and personally i think the less the

That is not true... heroin is much easier to obtain, but probably pretty
hard to get rid of, heroin could be put in pills and cut into low amounts
of ecstasy and sold 'as' ecstasy to be gotten rid of faster. 

I know for a fact that some ecstasy contains heroin. not so much that i've
seen here as when i was living in phoenix, but it does. there are labs that
test what is in ecstasy, and their results often times show some amount of
heroin in the samples, as well as ephedrine, speed, caffiene, cocaine,
ketamine, and many other drugs, often times the "e's" do not contain any
chemical related to mdma at all.

Read up on the subject... there are a LOT of really good books out there
about mdmda, as well as books about what the illegalization of mdma has
done to the quality of the drug to the end-user.

the best resource for information related to ecstasy on the internet is at
http://www.ecstasy.org

If you want to see what is in the ecstasy YOU are using... 
see this page: http://www.ecstasy.org/testing.html

No, it does make sense.  To my knowledge, ecstacy is not physically
addicting (the drug, anyway ;).  Heroin is, however.  "First time's

I don't use any of those on any occasion.  I find them all offensive. 
My take on it is this: if you have class, you don't use "unclassy"
language.  Folks that use those words, along with the "N" word, have
zero class.  Period.  That's another tool I'll use when trying to teach
my kids to treat all people like potential friends, not probable enemies
based on their physical differences.

I found a page with this text:

"You've probably heard stories of E being spiked with addictive and
poisonous substances. True, when you buy "Ecstasy" there's no quality
control and you may well get cocktails of other drugs, particularly when
the dealer has run out of MDMA. You may also get a dud. But not heroin or
poison."

This will back those of you who believe there is no heroin in e. I have
also seen test results which did show an amount of heroin in the pills,
which i have no found on the internet, so cannot post.

I know some of you will look down on me for what I am going to say, but if
you do then it's your problem, not mine.

I have tried heroin by itself orally before. I liked the effect to an
extent, but later became nausious as i had done too much. I have not done
heroin since then, but I remember what the effects are like, much as you
remember the effects of your first trip on LSD. 
I have also taken pure MDA, the drug that MDMA is synthesised from.

I have taken way more than my share of ecstasy, and I will say this...
I can almost always tell what is in the e i am taking, or at least what
drug the effects are most similar to. I have taken pure MDMA very few
times. The majority of e's I have taken have contained MDA or a very
similar drug, and a lot of those pills have also contained heroin, or a
very similar drug. I do not go out and take every drug in the book, but I,
from the combination of experience and the very extensive reading i do on a
drug before i take it, am usually able to identify what qualities the drug
has. Im rambling here, (probably a side effect of too much e) =o)

But what my point is, is that if what was in a lot of pills I have taken
was NOT heroin, it was a very damn close substance...

You tell me what it is?

-much love

There is absolutely no way for any of us to educate someone who does not 
wish to be educated.  I commend April's desires to help her community, and 
educate about drugs, but unfortuantely most people won't listen.  I agree 
that education is a top priority, and much more needs to be done, but it's a 
matter of approaching the issue carefully enough that some people do listen. 
 Also, we must all take this responsiblity on ourselves, and really learn 
about the things that we do to our bodies.  Few people on their first night 
of drinking, pick up a fifth of Jack Daniels, and pour it down their 
throats.  Why?  Because we see all the time what alcohol in excess can do, 
not only to our bodies, but also how drunks directly affect those around 
them, intentional or not.

Many drugs out there today are killers, particularly because we never ever 
know 100% what it is we are buying and consuming.  I have never met anyone 
that has tested their drugs before they took them, in fact most often people 
don't even bother to ask where they're pills come from, much less what 
impurities might be found in them.  As a community, we are in dire need of 
some serious social assistance in the realm of education.  Our government 
certainly doesn't see fit to provide the much needed money to improve our 
nations decaying public schools, and they turn the other cheek when it comes 
to our countries' drug issues, but it is our duty to first educate our 
government as to what our needs are as citizens and then apply pressure 
where needed to assure that those needs are taken care of.

Amsterdam has a great idea when it comes to drugs.  Everyone always talks 
about smoking weed in Amsterdam, buying huge sticky buds right in the cafe 
and lighting up right there, and nobody minds, but the real truth is that 
smoking marijuana is illegal in Amsterdam, but their government is 
progressive enough to tolerate marijuana use when used safely and in 
moderation.  Also, I have seen government sactioned medical reports on 
Ecstacy in the Netherlands, including booths set up at various club/rave 
events where doctors and medical researchers provide serious education on 
the Ecstacy that is being sold in the area, including pictures and visual 
samples of varying pills, their actual pharmecutical properties, (what's in 
them), and both their immediate and long term effects.  Although drugs are 
illegal in both countries, I believe that the United States needs to look 
toward other, more progressive countries, their policies on drugs, and 
follow suit, truly educating the masses, and saving lives.

So good luck April, I hope that whatever you do, you get the support that 
you need, it's a great idea, and with your best intentions, you'll help a 
lot of people.

Thanks for listening...

Smiles,

Scott =)

first off,
WELCOME APRIL! I love you tons!
Second off,
Major props to our newest lister, she has a good idea. In fact she
and I have talked about education regarding drugs many a time. The
biggest thing for me is making sure we get unbiased, true,
fact-for-fact information. Sad thing is, wherever I look, I hear
"some experts say that MDMA causes spinal fluid to drain whereas
other experts say it's the actual procedure of testing your spinal
fluid that drains it." Yup, contradicting, confusing "facts." Nothing
solid. So what to do?
     Also another thing to ponder is how to go about PACKAGING the
information. The fact is, there are kids out there who just don't
give a fuck what they're doing to their bodies, either that or they
just don't want to know because they know it's bad. They will see a
flyer saying "the facts about <insert drug here>" and find a reason
to justify every negative effect the drug has on your body. ALSO, the
flyers will be less accepted by people if it seems as if it's
preaching "DONT DO DRUGS". I'm not saying it should CONDONE drug
usage, because that's the LAST thing wanted to be done in this
situation. By saying "BE SMART IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO DRUGS and here
are some FACTS", some may say this is condoning of drugs, but it
really isn't. The truth is, we have no choice over what a fellow
raver is going to take at a party, we have no right to walk up to a
person you don't know and throw their hit of E on the floor just
because you don't believe in drug usage. All you can do is say "hey.
before you do that, you might want to know a little bit about what
you're doing to yourself and how it will effect your body and mind in
the long run." if they don't want to listen, give them a flyer
anyhow. can't say you didn't try.
     I think you get what I'm saying... :)
Take care all and if you're going to Planet New Year's remake party,
look for me, I'm gonna try to bring some strawberries :)~
Love and hugs and warmth,
Lara

I'd appreciate it if you would tell us more about how you know this for a
fact. You mention that lab tests have shown heroin in the samples... unless
you can produce these lab tests please do not say this. There was a series
of lab tests that has been posted to this list a couple times in years
past, and although many ecstacy samples have a lot of funny things in them,
not one of them anywhere was ever found to contain heroin. Maybe the
workings of the entire drug market has changed dramatically in the last
year or two from how it has been for many years before then, but I
seriously doubt it. One of the advantages of the internet is that a great
many people and resources are able to share their knowledge with each
other... this heroin and mdma thread has come up many times before on
sfraves, and not one person has ever successfully come forward with any
solid evidence of heroin in the capsules. If someone did, I'm sure everyone
would very quickly take notice, not just here but on all the rave mailing
lists. So then if you do have facts, please share them. If your facts are
second hand, please just quiet down and pay attention.

Your own quoted source above for valid information on ecstacy has an
article saying that there is no heroin mixed with MDMA. Did you not look at
your own source?

It seems like this myth should die as it's been hashed to the ground
numerous times. That will only happen when each of stop spreading second
hand information.

-Your message just came in about why you think there's heroin in your e. My
answer would be that MDMA has an incredible range of effects. Some people
get happy, some people get sad, some people get floaty, some people get
heavy... chances are if you expect or look for any kind of sensation while
on the drug, you will find it. If you know what heroin feels like it is
probably very easy to make your MDMA experience feel like heroin. That's
part of the whole empathic experience. But it is not a good reason for
justifying that your drug is anything other that what it is suppossed to
be. I bet you got MDMA much more often than you think. The different forms
that this single drug takes confuses a lot of people into thinking it's
completely different drugs each time. Again, unless you have any facts...
you mention studies done. Unless you can lead us to these studies, please
stop mentioning them. The only studies that have ever shown up here show
exactly the opposite of what you've said.

I mean no disrespect, but this is such an insidious and malignant topic,
and it seems it needs to be treated intensly.

Dear List:

	Here are some thaughts for people to ponder throughout this blame-flame war.

1.  Has it crossed anybodies mind that the reason  the organization that promoted the boat party 
CAN NOT respond to anything going on at this point due to legal-liability reasons because they 
are trying to keep a barioer of seperation between the fact that their event was a private diner 
dance cruiz, and not a rave.

2.  Have any of you for a second stoped to wonder how bad the situation for the scene would get 
if the media assumed that this was a rave party and not some private event?

3.  Have we not seen the ignorance and trechory of the media to manipulate the truth and bring 
negative publicity to our scene by presenting one sided reports on rave events.

4.  If you think it is hard for promoters to get permits now, wait untill the headlines read 
"two die at drug rave", the media is ruthless when it comes to things like this.

5.  Mabee there is a reason why they are keeping silent, and mabee everyone else should as well!

6.  Before we all go of half-cocked and create more trouble then good, lets consider ALL the 
senarios.

7.  This is an atomic bomb that is just balancing on the brink of exploding, lets not rock the 
boat(pardon the termonoligy)  or we might contribute to the scenes ditruction.  

8.  If this thing goes off because some insurance investigator with a real bug up his ass was 
monitering the list and made 'his own' conection between the posibility that this event might 
have been a rave(which it wasn't), and not a private party(which it was) then we could ALL be 
contributing to the aftermath that will follow.

9.  Lets not lose sight of the big picture:  If we love our scene, and we want it to not be 
damaged by this tragedy, then we will let this thread go without any further posts.  

10.  I am sure that once the group that organized the event knows more information, then they 
will release it.  But now is not a time for speculation.   Asumptions and rumors can only create 
more damage.  lets not add fuel to the fire.

Lets all bond together in thought during this time of tragidy, not insight a blame-flame post 
wars thatimplies that his boat party was a rave and people were taking drugs.  

If anyone has anything more to say or add to this thread, it should be done in private.

PLUR
Keep it real.

Yes, this appears to be an urban myth.  Dealers CUT pure drugs with more 
inexpensive additives to increase their PROFITS.  Heroin costs more than 
ecstasy - do da math.  

I've noticed that the effects I have had mirror what, as my research tells 
me, should be expected at a "low" dosage of approx. 75mg - not the 
120-150mg stronger dosage that brings on a crazier trip.  Obviously 
what's marketed is not a pure product.  There is no consumer protection 
on the black market (another unfortunate consequence of prohibition).

Personally, I always suspected that "tylenols" didn't refer to a 
particular kind of e, but rather what it was probably cut with!! :P

Mike,

I liked everything you wrote and I respect and agree with everything.  I especialy like this 
last part.  It could not have been said more to the point.  I hope that everyone on the list takes 
this into consideration in lou of tragedy on the boat party.

That's the real beauty of electronic music.  As technology advances, and 
electronic music intstruments become cheaper, more and more people open 
themselves to the possibility of creating music on their own.  Anyone can do 
it now, and it's really not that expensive.  The world is filled with such 
vast differences in culture, and musical taste, and as we begin tapping into 
this vein of creativity, and fully realizing our individual musical 
potentials, I think we will all find new music daily that more closely 
reflects each of our dreams, emotions, and experiences.

I'm excited.

u are SO right about people creating new forms of music (ie new
alternative/hiphop/ect) its already happening...  and its a good thing!

some people are just not down with progressive music (ie trance,
breakbeat...) and they may never be...

personally i don't think mtv's amp, nor LIVE 105.3's transmitter
adjustments, or ESPN's background music will ever attract a huge number
of people to our scene...
just a thought :)

HI there,

So, welcome to the wonderous world of Techno.  I think you'll find as much 
depth and meaning in techno music as with nature itself.  The real beauty of 
the music, is that it subscribes itself to no set boundaries...anything 
goes...granted hi NRG stuff has its purpose, but it falls trap to the same 
retrictions that are placed on other popular musical genres like 
"alternative", and r&b.  At one time, alternative really meant that - it was 
an alternative form of rock to the existing scene, however over time, both 
alternative and r & b have lost their originality and instead of being 
pioneers of music, forging new and innovative ground, they have driven 
themselves into the ground by preying on the wealth found in americas 
stereotyping, and pigeonholing of what music should sound like and how it 
should be wrapped up and presented to us in quick, colorful music videos.

People are definately ready for a change, and electronic dance music is the 
just the thing.  Europe has embraced serious dance music on a major scale, 
its impact being felt in every aspect of European life.  In fact, Germany 
has acknowledged techno as one of their official musical exports!  We cannot 
possibly fathom all that this type of music has to offer to the world, but 
we aren't far from finding out.  I talked to an executive of mtv just before 
the end of last year, and there are serious steps being taken to adjust the 
face of mtv to prepare for the onslaught of this relatively new form of 
music on america.  So prepare yourselves, we are only just now watching this 
wave of music begin to peak.

Enjoy the music, and the ride,

Scott =)

Subject: Confessions of a techno newbie / it's go
Date: Wed Feb 19 1997 4:34PM

I've been hearing a lot of concern about techno's growing popularity and 
what
effect it will have on the whole scene.  I just thought I'd share my views 
on
the subject, why I'm not to worried about it . . .

First of all, I'm one of the newbies myself.  I used to listen to (actually,
I
still do) alternative, hip hop, and r&b, and some other stuff as well.
However, I've always been attracted to techno.  Sure, high energy and all
that
was okay, but the few techno songs I used to hear (the first being "Charly"
and "Sesame's Treat," i believe) I loved.  I couldn't get enough of it, but 
I
didn't have any friends who listened to it, so I didn't know where to go to
get more.  Ravers were just people I saw on TV, I never saw one in real life 

before.

Then came along the infamous Prodigy and Chemical Brothers buzz clips, and
Mtv's Amp.  It blew me away about how much stuff I had never been exposed to 

(not even the super popular songs).  I began taping Amp through my stereo,
and
I'd listen to the tapes 24/7 (this was the only techno I had).

I expected my friends to feel the same way.  So at a kick-back party I 
popped
one of my tapes in.  First song was Orbital, i think, "halycon and on and
on,"
whatever that songs called (I'm trying, y'all)  It did not go over well.
"What is this???" they asked.  "It's techno," I say.  "Techno?  It sounds a
little weird to be techno," they reply.  "It doesn't sound like the normal
stuff."  "Normal stuff?"  I say, thinking they've known about this stuff all 

along, "What normal stuff?"  "You know, like Gina G and all that."

Needless to say, before the first song was over, the tape came off.  That
leads to my first conclusion, that most people aren't ready for, or
interested
in, techno music.  My friends aren't that crazy about The Prodigy even. 
 They
like the song, but they aren't going to be charging any record stores to get 

the new album.

When I came to school yesterday, I mentioned to these same friends that 
there
was a rave last weekend (the loveaffair thing).  "RAVE???" they said.  "You
should have told us!  We could have had hella fun!"  You see, most people
have
this idea of a rave being all about sex, drugs, and techno (and you don't
have
to be 21!!!)  Perhaps the media is responsible for this, I dunno, but it's
supposed to be some grand, gigantic party.  And whether they like techno or
not, they all like a good party.

However, I'm not too concerned with this either.  #1, you can't go to rave
and
not like techno.  I know my friends would become weary of dancing for over 2 

hours and never hearing Real McCoy.  #2, there are plenty of clubs playing
HiNRG, alternative, industrial, house etc., that are much cheaper than a
rave,
within a reasonable distance, less likely to be broken up by cops, serve
alcohol, and you can "meet people there--" the meat market atmosphere. 
 It'll
take one or two raves before the average person moves on to something more
appealing to them.

So if the music and the rave isn't turning them on, then what is?  What
turned
me on to techno was how simply sitting down and listening to the music could 

take me to a whole higher level--something that doesn't happen listening to
most popular music genres.  Raves are only attractive to me because of the
music, but especially that nonmeat market, superficial vibe so present in 
the
r&b / hip hop house parties I've been too.  As for alternative, I could 
never
dance to it . . . you can't express yourself like you can with techno.  You
just bang your head or get in the mosh pit and throw chairs.  Not the same
effect on the soul, imho.  But when I talk about how the music affects me to 

my friends, they think I'm going nuts.

>From someone who's on the "other side," return all your black gear you were
going to wear to mourn the death of the scene.  Straight up, the american
teen
isn't going to trade in their Alanis Morrissette and/or Snoop Dogg cds for
Orbital or even Prodigy for awhile.  I'm concerned about what might happen
when they get bored with alt. and hip hop, but most likely they will create
new forms of rock and rap to listen to, instead of turning to techno.

In other words, I think everything will be fine.

Miccaela
becalmacidrage   (<------it's an anagram)

P.S.  I'd like to 1.  apologize for waste of bandwidth, 2.  hear your views
on
the subject (even flaming, although I don't know what I've said to deserve
it), and 3.  ask if there are any ravers in Sacramento who wouldn't mind
hooking up with me and educating this poor ignorant girl about the scene
(don't you feel sorry for me?  I have no friends w/ the same interests, I'm
an
outcast  *sniff sniff*)

The pharmacology is incredibly different than "ordinary"
methyl-amphetamine.  Although, MDMA (Ecstasy) contains the term "MA" in
it's name...it's actions are completely different.  The negative actions
that are seen from use of e are in its binding and subsequent damage to 5HT
(serotonin) nerve terminals.  The level of damage and the ability of the
brain to repair itself is completely unknown and incredibly complex.
However, drugs (such as Xanax, Prozac, etc.) that are mass marketed by
companies located in this very area act upon the same region of the neuron
and are readily accepted by the American public.  Not that this changes the
effect of e...it just puts in in perspective.  The daily intake of these
accepted prescribed drugs is really no different than the raver who
ocassionally drops e to have a good time or to learn something about
themseleves or their world (IMHO).   To be perfectly honest, I can
sympathize with the ocassional recreational or spiritual drug use much more
than the addiction to psychoactive antidepressants that saturates this
country.  Not an attack...simply a comparision.

Heroin?  That's an old myth.  Not only are the costs too high to cut e with
heroin...ingesting it doesn't have much of an effect.

I'd be happy to give you information that you could use to put together
some factual literature.  There is a lot of conflicting information out
there.  There is also a lot of room for personal beliefs here but _factual_
information is always good to help influence decisions.   Your heart seems
to be in the right place in concern for those around you.  Caution should
be taken to prevent forming a biased opinion; be careful not to judge.

Next topic...how neurotoxic is television?  :)

peace,

p.s.  speaking of drug trips...check out david lynch's new movie, "lost
highway".  it opens the 28th nationwide.  it'll blow your  m i n d.

Forwarded from the On-U mailing list.  Lee Perry is in many ways the
originator and inspiration for many of the techniques used to make 
electronic dance music.  He started as a record producer in Jamaica in the
early 1960s and is responsible for a phenomenal amount of the classic 
tracks of that era, and then went on to invent or pioneer many of the
studio techniques that underlie dub.  I can't overstate his influence
(often unnoticed) on all kinds of music -- house, techno and jungle included.

He's also completely crazy, though he's crazy like a fox.  A true trickster,
a shaman, a force from beyond.  He's been holed up in Switzerland for years
and now, suddenly, will descend on SF to do a show.  I have no idea if it
will be any good, but I can easily predict it will be memorable.

Rejoice and tremble in your boots. Consult your local bookmaker, oracle
soothsayer or psychic.

Lee Perry is confirmed at Maritime Hall in San Francisco for two nights; Friday
and Saturday, April 4 and 5. Said to be the only U.S. dates. $22.00 advance.

Phone orders only at this time. They will take Visa and Mastercard. Phone
415-974-0634.

Needless to say, we will be there, but I'm trying not to get my hopes up too
high. I had tickets to see him in SF in the early '80's and he cancelled.

Now, what are the odds of him actually making these shows? I think it's about 4
in 10. And if he only makes one show which will it be? I would say Saturday
(soon come). 

Everyone do some ju-ju...

> it doesn't make sense to "cut" E with heroin.

: No, it does make sense.  To my knowledge, ecstacy is not physically
: addicting (the drug, anyway ;).  Heroin is, however.  "First time's
: free..."

        It makes even less sense if you're aware that heroin doesn't
work when ingested orally. The digestive process breaks it down. That's
why it is generally injected, and sometimes snorted, and sometimes even
dissolved in water & taken as an enema.

        Of course, some drug dealers are pretty stupid. Just because
it doesn't make sense doesn't mean it won't happen sometimes. Some
drug dealers would be ignorant enough of the facts to try to make
"E" by mixing meth & heroin...

        Anyway, "E" ... IS related to Methamphetamine. If you're
doing high doses regularly, all you're getting is the meth effect.
You might as well just switch to meth. It's cheaper & it'll take
you where you're going more quickly ... there's a number of people
on the list you could talk to about that ...

This post was so contrived that I can't even take the time now to post

exactly what I would expect from you.

It WAS A RAVE. I have the FLYERS TO PROVE IT! (AND THE SF RAVES CALENDAR,

Call the media! -- So what if "RAVES" will be affected. Except for those
HOME BASE type "RAVE PARTIES", I really doubt that there will be a negative
effect on the underground side. And so what if there were no more HOME BASE

I guess you forgot to imply that you see your livlihood in jepordy when you

It might be a good idea, for those who rave in groups, to select a designated
watchdog/guardian in your group, who will be sober and able to respond to
a crisis.  That person can have as much fun as anyone else at a party while
still keeping tabs on the rest of the group.
Another thought, this one kinda obvious: if you have a friend in distress,
and you feel help is needed beyond your ability to handle it, ASK
SOMEONE IF THEY CAN HELP YOU!  Chances are you'll find one
of us compassionate individuals who will either help or get help.  Let's
work together, my sisters and brothers.  How's about we care for one
another?  :)  Mom says: If you can't be good, be careful!
Love, peace, and safety,
Eric

Hi there,

I agree with some of what you said, however although it is the promoters 
responsibility to provide a safe environment in which people can have fun, 
the promoter cannot possibly be held responsible for each individual persons 
actions.  I've seen kids at your parties that have passed out from too much 
GHB and the like, and I'm certain that you do everything you can to promote 
to the kind of people that you believe will best suit your party's 
aspirations, but noone can hold you responsible for that person's lack of 
knowledge about GHB.  The best that you can do, is to try and educate more, 
or perhaps search people more at the door, but people will always find a way 
to get around these things...this is uncontrollable.  The thing is, that no 
one person has any more or less right to the possible enlightment that can 
be found at raves.  Granted, Nomad caters to a much different crowd than 
yours, but they (for whatever their intentions) are allowing for new people 
to experience a different perspective from what they have ever known.  We 
all on sfraves know very well how raving has affected us, and what it has 
meant to our lives, and who are we to say who can or cannot be a part of 
that?

As far as the promoters of Splish go (Nomad), well we can do nothing but 
make assumptions as to why things happened the way they did.  When was the 
last time something like this happened at a party?  I'm willing to bet that 
they did the very best that they could with what resources that they had. 
 Perhaps they were simply not prepared for that type of occurance...but are 
you?....am I?...maybe we really need to focus on educating the promoters on 
what to do in case of such an unfortunate time, so that if something like 
this does happen again, we will all be better prepared to handle it.

Either way, some type of action does need to happen.  Not directed at Nomad 
in particular, but to all of us, as it is OUR responsibility to watch out 
for each other as well as ourselves.

Smiles,

Scott =)

It's long been my belief that promoters are responsible for what happens at
their parties. The promoter picks who they 'market' to, they pick who they
let in and they either do or do not facilitate some form of what I'll call
magick to  protect the party and those who attend it. Might sound wishy
washy and new age but I've been to plenty of parties where I felt safe and
protected and I've also been to plenty of parties where I could feel random
violence waiting to happen, and it all, quite literally, begins with the
promoter.

A whole complex of things including the promoter's intentions and
awareness; the people at the party, their intentions and awareness; things
done before, during, and after the party to direct all of the above toward
a positive result, ultimately shape the energy that guides and informs the
party.

I would call turning the music back on with two people overboard, the
actions of people not terribly tuned in -- to anything.  How I would feel
as the parent of one of those missing were I to know this, horrifies me.
What could there possibly be to celebrate at that point? If this did in
fact happen, ultimately, no one but the promoters can be held responsible
for that decision.

Anyone facilitating the gathering of hundreds of people most of whom will
probably be out of their heads must have no illusions about their
responsibility for creating as safe and as healthy an environment as
possible.

Whether or not, as the promoters, Tom and Stacy should be held legally
responsible, I hope that, to the appropriate degree, they do feel
personally responsible: they invoked this voyage, and none of it would have
happened had they not. Oonly they will know if they did *everything* they
could to make it a safe trip. If they did, the deserve our sympathy, if
they did not they deserve our wrath.

yours in deep regret
ethan

wuzzup Rob,

You mention that drug dealers are pretty stupid...

I agree.

But, MDMA cooks are usually far from stupid. A few I have known are
UCBerkely PH.Ds, etc just to give you an idea. 

Again, it might happen sometimes (rarely), but for the most part, I believe
that 99.9% of the E on the market does not have H in it. Also, as far as
imported pills (from Amsterdam) breakdowns have been done that show no
signs of any H. 

A more frequent cut for E is speed. Speed give you the euphoric feeling,
keeps you up, and makes you happy. It's cheap, its a somewhat similar high.

But, for the most part, I agree with you.

This Saturday at midnight, Evolution invites everyone to a special Full
Moon ceremony on the beach in San Francisco.  This will be a brother and
sister circle with a bonfire and drumming, facilitated by our sister
Zoraida.

To find us, take Fulton St (the 5 or 21) down to the end.  We will be on
the beach across from the windmills.  Hope to see you there!

Right on Cami.  I can only hope that more people will follow your lead and 
find out what they're taking before they're taking it.  You are a great

Yea but I've also heard from someone (a cop actually, while he was giving a
speech) that people sometimes drop it into their coffee and drink it.
Although if I remember it right the heroin has to be in a particular state.

Anyone else heard this? Or am I being a fool for listening to to him?

While I totally consider ecstacy.org and the hyperreal archives to be the
best source available to someone like me about recreational substances,
there have been two long standing concerns I've had about the on-line
information provided about MDMA and such.

1) This one may just be in my head, but I've always felt that writings by
Nicholas Saunders and others were somehow slightly "biased" in favor of the
recreational use of MDMA, and not completely neutral. Something like the
flip side of the D.A.R.E. program, although that is not a preferred
example. I dunno, maybe it's just my perception.

2) It wasn't more than two decades ago, I believe, that MDMA was legal to
buy in the U.S. First discovered in 1913... ....much of what we know comes
from recent discovery. What kind of effect does MDMA have after 40-50
years? No one really seems to know because it just hasn't been around long
enough. This is still a relatively new drug and there is still a lot that
is unknown.

Anyone else hear where I'm coming from on this? Or I'm I just loosing it?

        I said *some* drug dealers are pretty stupid.

> But, MDMA cooks are usually far from stupid.

        Certainly the good ones would have to be somewhat intelligent
        in certain areas. Most people don't buy direct from the cooks,
        though. 

	There's crappy cooks, too. Some of them aren't too bright.

	I'd say all these people are doing something where the risks
	outweigh the benefits by a long shot, so they at least have
	some blind sides in their intelligence ...

Cops lie? ;]
My girlfriend is a  high school teacher and last year a uniformed officer
from the Santa Clara Co Sheriffs dept. dropped by her classroom for some
"straight" talk about THE DANGERS OF DRUGS.  During the course of his
speech, the nice mr officer mentioned MDMA and claimed that it was invented
in the late 1960's by "homosexuals" as a gay love drug! Argh! My girlfriend
had to just sit there and keep quiet, she couldn't tell her class the truth
as district policy expressly prohibits drugs as a subject for classroom
discussion.  Except for lying police.  


As far as heroin in E is concerned; in college I remember reading about how
the heroin being sold on the street was so diluted, and the efficiency of
oral ingestion so low, that eating enough heroin to get any effect at all
would be difficult.  

But I also just read (no, I don't remember where) that a much more potent
form of heroin is beginning to appear on the street, leading to a rash of
overdoses and dead rock stars.  Maybe this more potent form is active
orally? I bet that you would still have to eat an awful lot, I can just
imagine these great big horse (pun intended) E/H pills, yuck!  But still,
the only reason to cut E with anything is to make more money, cutting it
with smack would not accomplish this.

I have heard of a lab in Florida, but the cost for analysis was $25 per 
pill.   Seems like that only makes sense for people who buy a great 
amount of the same batch, or can spend $50 an e and wait a few weeks!

This has happened only *once* at a Friends and Family and we took it very
seriously and brought the individual to the hospital immediately. And, we
have not thrown a party that size since then because we haven't felt safe
in our, and the community's ability to take care of itself at those sizes
and beyond.

True, though, as you note, tragedy can and does befall everyone, intentions
notwithstanding. Thus I would not assess blame based simply on the
occurrence of tragedy but, rather, on the response to it, which is the only
point I took issue with, and then, only theoretically so.

On a totally separate note, given that Alta Vista is happilly archiving all
this for all eternity, I'd be really happy if you didn't publicly associate
events I've helped produce with alleged drug overdoses. I'm sure you
understand.

take it easy

Subject: Drug Education
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Just two comments/suggestions:

1.  the hyperreal site is good for drug info, esp. about E.  I've checked it 
out, and I learned a lot.

2.  possible theme for the pamphlets (or whatever):  when i visited another 
website (can't remember which), they had a theme called "Just Say Know."  I 
thought this was great, it wasn't as anti-drug as "Just Say No" (not that 
being against drugs is a bad thing, but not everyone is willing to accept that 
view), and it encourages education.  There's no point is saying no if you 
don't know what you're saying no to, the same goes for saying yes . . . but we 
all know the saying "knowledge is power," and I think we'd all agree it's 
pretty accurate.  If the medium of education stressed education rather than 
trying to force a set of morals onto people, the raver could use it to make a 
smart decision about drug use.

If anything UG, if someone would be kind enough to send me a private 
email, kissy kissy to you.  Otherwise, does anyone have the skinny on who 
the guest dj will be at (gulp) Nikita?

Not for me, for a friend whose first UG was Koinonea a coupla weeks ago.  He 
bounced around all night in glee.  Definitely a return-customer.  It's 
his bday this weekend and he wants to celebrate it right.

As for me, see you all at Madness Saturday night (yea!!)

Hey guys,
       (Just one last post before I log off of sfraves for another two
semesters.)

           This is a great post about how to stop E Neurotoxicity!

        After reading that thread about the reorginazation of neurons,
I thought I'd put in a little bit of my knowledge and opinion. I've 
basically spent most of my free time this summer reading the current 
journal articles on MDMA, and I'm a junior chemist at Harvey Mudd College 
(which btw, has a pretty cool scene here...), so I THINK I am somewhat 
reliable of a source (though I am always learning, just like everyone else)

        If you don't like boring scientific brain stuff, just skip to the
        end for answers on how to stop E neurotoxicity. There are actually a
        lot of really effective things you can do, and I've tried to list
        all that I know of (I'm sure there are more things...).

Q: What does E do?
A: It causes the massive release of serotonin from serotonergic presynaptic
neurons. Basically the neurons terminals that contain serotonin as their
neurotransmitter are caused to fire (ie. release serotonin into the synapse)
by MDMA. 
A very simplistic view of serotonin might describe it as the "happy
neurotransmitter," since low levels of it are associated with
depression. After this massive release your body probably cannot recollect
all of your serotonin (some gets degraded, some just floats away). Hence
your serotonin levels drop.

Q: What else does E do?
A: It inhibits TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase. This enzyme is the first of two
steps which transforms tryptophan (an amino acid) to serotonin. Hence new
production of serotonin is halted (or at least slowed down signifigantly).

Q: Is this what causes depression the next day?
A: Most likely, yes. After a night in which a chemical has caused the
massive release of serotonin into the synapse, and then significantly slowed
the new production of serotonin, your serotonin levels are likely to be
markedly lowered.

Q: Is MDMA neurotoxic?
A: Yes. It selectively degeneretes (note - it does NOT kill, as far as we
know) serotonin neuron terminals. In experiments on monkeys, after stopping
MDMA use for approx a year, the neuron terminals were found to
regenerate. 

MY THEORY - It's at this point that the serotonergic neuron terminals grow 
back to the wrong place, hence causing the abnormal connections we were just
reading about in the "Rave Drug May Damage Brain...." or whatever. But this
is just my theory on things...

Q: What causes the neurotoxicity?
A: This one's a doozy.....  After the serotonin has binded to the receptor
on the other side of the synpapse (the post-synaptic neuron), there is a 
reuptake pump (on the pre-synaptic neuron) that sucks back up the serotonin 
from the synapse. Every now and then the pump will suck up a dopamine
molecule (another neurotransmitter that isn't really related to the
"feel-good" effects of E). That dopamine doesn't have any business being
inside of a serotonin neuron, so MAO-B degrades the dopamine, IN THE 
PROCESS OF WHICH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IS FORMED!!!!! 
        
Q: So what's the big deal about Hydrogen Peroxide?
A: Nothing normally. H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) is toxic to animals because it
splits in two to form two hydroxyl free radicals, which are very reactive
and very damaging. Normally your body can handle these varmits just fine,
just by reducing them with anti-oxidants (like Vitamin C, E, or
glutathione).

Q: H2O2 and MDMA: so what's the connection?
A: MAO-B also degrades serotonin, but not as well as it degrades dopamine,
but there is usually so much serotonin as compared to dopamine inside of a
serotonergic neuron, that it has a hard time getting around to the dopamine,
so very little H2O2 is formed. HOWEVER, during an E trip, a whole heck of a
lot of your serotonin is outside in the synapse, not in the neuron, so the
MAO-B has a much easier time getting to the dopamine, and hence forming more
H2O2. (Also I think E causes a larger production of dopamine elsewhere in
your brain, and eventually some of that dopamine will get inside of the 
serotonergic neurons). Now there is a much higher level of H2O2 INSIDE of
your serotonergic neurons than your body can effectively get rid of, and
NOW we start seeing brain damage: specifically, selective serotonergic
neuron degeneration.

MY THEORY - The neurons form abnormal connections after being damaged, maybe
because they just hook up with the closet thing nearby. If you could stop
this degeneration damage somehow, there would be no way for the neurons to
grow back abnormally since they are already fine.

                        END OF BORING SCIENTIFIC STUFF

Q: So how do I stop this shitty neurotoxicity?
A: Many Many different ways. Below is a list of the ways I am currently
familiar with, though I'm sure there are probably more...


1) Stop the reuptake of serotonin (and hence the accidental reuptake of
   dopamine also which is the real cause of the neurotoxicity) by taking an
   SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). So take:

                                Prozac 

   Take it 3-6 hours afters taking your E dose, and this will significantly
   reduce neurotoxicity. THIS IS A WELL DOCUMETNED EFFECT! This is not one
   of my other theories. If you do this your brain will love you for it. Any
   other SSRI will also have the same effect (Xanax? Zoloft? Are those SSRIs?) 
   This might even make your trip a bit better, because it will keep the
   serotonin in the synapse longer....

2) Stop the breakdown of dopamine by MAO-B. This is the ultimate step which
   produces the toxic hydrogen peroxide. The documented case I read about
   used:

                               L-deprenyl

   which I believe is a commonly prescribed anti-depressant, though when I
   think about it, maybe it's not since.... Well does anyone have any info
   on this or where to get it? It would be greatly appreciated.... Anyways,
   take it the same time that you take your E, cause that's what worked for
   the rats.... Other MAO-B inhibitors will also work (ask your doctor about
   this....)

3) Increase relative serotonin levels. If you eats lots of tryptophan at the
   same time you eat your E, this will overcome the inhibitory effects that
   E has on TPH (tryptophan hydroxylase), which will increase relative
   serotonin levels, which will decrease the degradative actions of MAO-B on
   dopamine (since all of the extra serotonin will be getting in the way),
   which will produce less H2O2, and hence less damage. So....

        Take something like 2-3 capsules of tryptophan with 1 capsule E.

   Unfortunatley, the FDA has taken tryptophan (an amino acid!!!) off of the
   market for what I believe is essentially political reasons (they found it
   later to be a contaminent in a Japanese pharmaceuticals tryptophan
   product that was causing the sickness, not the tryptophan itself.....)
   You can still probably get it in Mexico though and you probably can even
   mail order it for European Pharmaceutical companies. It's not like it's a
   Schedule I drug like E is....
   This might also make your trip a bit better because you will now be
   continually producing serotonin. IT WILL ALMOST DEFINITELY HELP WITH
   POST-E DEPRESSION....

4) Stop the free-radical damage. This is the easiest to do, since
   anti-oxidants are extremely easy to come by. Some suggestions:

        Glutathione - This a naturally occuring tripeptide in your body. I
                      THINK it is one of the chemicals your brain uses in
                      the process that gets rid of free radicals. And it
                      itself is an anti-oxidant....

        Vitamin C
        Vitamin E
        Melatonin (fairly good report in recent Newsweek on this)
        Many others....

   It would probably be a good idea to take some with your E, and then maybe
   about 3-6 hours later....



                 Summary

Prozac & other SSRIs                    3-6 hours after taking E
L-deprenyl and other MAO-B inhibitors   When you take your E
Tryptophan ***                          When you take your E
Anti-oxidants
    Vitamin C
    Vitamin E
    glutathione ***
    melatonin

*** - highly recommend

        Well, that's it.... Hope I haven't gone too overboard. I would like 
to give one last thanks to the SF scene for giving me what I believe was the
greatest summer I've ever had. Thanks much to all you out there who have
make it so special....

                                          lots and lots and lots o luv,

                                                Jason Sydes

I know this...If someone were to overdose at one of your events, I know that 
they would be clearly loved and cared for very well...You and the rest of F 
& F are very mature and responsible people.  I in no way wanted to indicate 
anything otherwise...I have always valued your efforts a great deal, and 
your contributions to our house are immense.  However, I merely wished to 
prove a point, and although I may have gotten a touch too specific, you 
heard me...thank you for your reply.

My sincerest apologies...I got a bit lost in the moment I'm afraid...all of 
this angry talk left and right about things people really don't know much 
about gets me worked up a little...anyways - point taken...

Take care,

Smiles,

Sorry I forgot to include this info...
$20 pre-sale
$25 @ the door

the people who are organizing this event advised me that they highly 
recommend presale tickets as to avoid long lines and to get a discount.  
I think that's a good idea.  They said that they are putting a lot of 
tickets on presale to facilitate this.

Thank you and hope to see you there!

Good insight as to what my son will have to deal with when he gets older.
I guess I look at being bi-racial as THE best place to be in this couldron
called America.  I eman, you defy classsification, so I guess "human" would be 
the best bet since you are an amalgam of all things.  This is the 
rightdirection, IMO, this country and the world needs to go to get away from 
thesevere tribalism we are constantly embroiled in.
Being biracial myself, I don't agree that it's the best thing to be.  I'm too 
"white" for some black folks--since I'm so light people assume that I'm a 
"wannabe," or that I'm stuck up, etc.  And as for white people, they still see 
me as black.  And white racists still think of me as the infamous n-word (I'll 
leave it out so I don't offend anyone, but I won't act like I don't use it, 
because I do).  Being biracial is not a problem when you're around openminded 
people (whether they be black, white, or anything else).  It doesn't mean 
you'll immediatly identify with them either.  Being biracial around racists 
(be they black, white, or anything else) is just as bad, perhaps worse than 
being just one race, because you signify the union of two races that those 
people believe should never mix.  And we cannot forget that you're always 
expected to choose which "side" you're on.

To avoid flaming, let me say that I am not saying that all whites or all 
blacks are racists, or that being biracial sucks.  I love everybody and I love 
who I am.  But I've learned that not everyone loves me and who I am.

Racism is going to exist in America as long as there is black, white, latino, 
asian, pacific islander, etc.  It's human nature to categorize people and also 
judge groups of people without a rational basis for that judgement.  I'm the 
first to admit that I'm prejudiced and can be pretty damn ignorant.  That's 
why I rarely call anyone racist or trip off racist comments because I make 
them myself.  My white friends sometimes talk about black people, and my black 
friends talk about white people.  It's a fact of life.

I figure most white people have said "nigger," for whatever reason.  Most 
black people have used the words "cracker," "poor white trash," "honkey," etc. 
 I know I've used both.  But everyone has an ignorant moment, and I'm not 
going to base my opinion on someone because they used a racial slur.  If 
someone treats me and and all sorts people with respect, no matter what their 
race, I don't care what words they use.  Actions speak louder than words.  
I've met many racists who've never used a racial slur around me, and many 
great people who have used every word in the book.  I refuse to let words like 
nigger or cracker or whatever else get me riled up, because I'm not going to 
let a certain combination of letters have that much control over my emotions.  
But that's just me.

If someone doesn't like you to use racial slurs, respect them enough not to 
use them, at least not in their presence.  How you show respect is much more 
important than your vocabulary.

Thanks to everyone who came to Euphonic Genesis!  It was lots of fun!  I
also want to thank everyone who was extra-nice to my mom and my
boyfriend's mom.  They had so much fun that they plan on coming to more
parties!!  Special thanks to the kids who gave them hugs, glitter,
stickers, glowstix, and lillipops.

Also, an apology to the poor guy they dragged out on the dancefloor. 
They had just arrived, and didn't understand yet that people dance BY
THEMSELVES at parties ;-)

For a while, they thought that the partyers were afraid of them being
there, but I convinced them otherwise.

We ended up having a lot of people bring their parents to our party.  We
even had special laminates that said "Parent Pass" on them.

Bringing my mom to Euphonic Genesis was a big step in my becoming closer
with my mother.  She thanked me repeatedly for caring enough to include
her in my life.  I saw not only an emotional change in my mother, that
night, but a physical one.  When I drove her home (at about 11:45--she's
not used to staying up late) she was hyper, giggly, and more positive
than I'd seen her in years.  When she looked at me, she had a twinkle in
her eye.  She looked as if a weight had been lifted off her.  She looked
younger, happier.

I remember my mom warning me that she wouldn't like the music at the
party...

           ...I got her ON TAPE saying, "I really liked the music"!!!

Stay tuned for more information; my mother will be posting from this
e-mail address, someday soon, to give her account of Saturday night.

Once again, thank you all very very very much for your help!  You have
helped me live out one of my dreams--to share the magic of raving with my
mom!

Love and kisses to everyone,

      Libby Rose (aka Spunky or HuggyBear)  :-)  :-)  :-)

(more venom? why?)

yes, maybe it was a rave...but you know what, I have been thinking about
this alot, it was not a rave put on by my rave family, maybe under a big
umbrella term whatever nomad does can be coined a rave, but you know
what...I dont want the fact that my family throws raves and nomad throws
raves to get confused...there is a difference. I think that this is a very
delicate issue, the general public may think that that is a rave...but WE
know there is a difference...that is what we are trying to distinguish by
saying it was not a rave...

RE: raves the underground will thrive...you also said that there should be
moreregulation of raves...I think that that is absurd! regulation of raves
means that we dont get permits, more regulation means more water/security

oh come on...^&*()^&^&*&*&*(*&*(&...what are you talking about...maybe you
have a pretty secure little underground that YOU run around in, but what
about the rest of us that are still looking for our niche...still trying
to find our own thing? ... more bad press just makes it harder and harder
to let new undergrounds get going...how many supposedly underground
parties (define underground yourself, I dont want to argue over
definitions) get busted? ... and what is the result of their "regulation"?

damn man...dont be so selfish, there are LOTS of people that enjoy
massive parties, just because you dont, dont go putting your energy
towards shutting them down for the rest of us. LOOK AT ALL THE POSITIVE
REVIEWS OF THE LAST HB PARTY...speaks for itself.

I think that it is a natural reaction to differentiate bad apples from
good apples...think about it this way...

fnf/harmony/sweet/pro soy are raves, so is nomad, ... but can YOU see a
difference? I thought so...can joe schmoe newspaper feeder see the
difference? NO! NO! NO! that is why we a re differentiating ourselves from
them.

your right it will, but we all help push it along, wheredo we want to go?

well...I mainly go to parties because of the wonderful people that take
part in it....drugs sure is one part on the  whole "scene"...but it
should not be that important....the music..the community..and the vibe
is what makes everything work..its not the drugs....this is were all the
ignorance comes in.. most people think of "raves" as a place to get high
and wasted...but this indeed is a big misnomer!..people who put drugs
into their #1 list should just stay home and get fucked up
there......peace..christian

If you don't think that drugs are a leading factor in the international
success of raves and rave culture, I suggest you:

(1) Watch *any* show spotlighting raves (Hard Copy, 20/20, Leeza, etc.,
etc.) They may be sensationalizing the drug use to a degree, but they have
gathered factual material with which to sensationalize. That is the
difference between manufactured news and slanted news. No matter how you
try to argue "how little" or "how much" with regard to the media's portayal
of drugs, you can't deny the drugs. Remember, they didn't make it up!

(2) Take a look at many of the rave flyers that sport thinly veiled drug
references. The Bagok Tribe 'Lucky Charms' flyer has to be the worst flyer
I have ever seen with regard to blatant "drug + rave" marketing to the kids
tactics, but there are others...

(3) Take a look at the home page of Hyperreal, where "Drugs" has about the
same amount of home-page real estate as "Raves" -- Hyperreal is known to be
the #1 world wide resource for raving and rave culture and drugs are linked
to it from the get go. There are five major things on the home page:
"Raves" "Music" "Publications" "Chemistry" [read: recreational drugs info]
and "Tools and Information."

For a culture that has nothing to do with raves, 20%'s a lot of real estate
for a completely unrelated subject.

(4) Take a closer look at a significant portion of the discussion on this
list (or most any other "geographical" rave-list) that is specifically
related to open conversation relating to: drugs consumed, drug
contamination, drug references ("420, dude!!1!" -- "That was a PHAT party!
I was on 2.5 hits of E!!1!" -- "What vitamins can I take to feel better
after E'ing my ass off all night?", etc.) Add to that constant" E vs. LSD,
vs pot vs sober vs natural stimulants" discussions...

I am *not making a statement here either endorsing or condemning drugs*. I
am not saying this applies to each and every raver on the planet, I am
simply bringing home the fact the issue of denial about just how important
and just how integral drugs and drug useage are with the world wide "rave"
movement.

Now, I say again, in reply to "most parents [and the media, and government,
and law enforcement, etc. etc.] see these kind of parties as drug-fests
where everybody gets high and wasted.."

And what part of that is not accurate?"

Whoaaa..pretty hefty explanation my friend:)....I think you
misunderstood me..I never said that drugs were never part of the
"scene"...it is a part of the "scene" we all are in...but hey..must we
give importancs to it?..what happened to the sense of
community..spirit..and togetherness..that should be on everyones #1
list?..it is true that most indviduals today are highly into drugs..but
hey..thats there decision not mine right?..thats what so fucked up about
the "scene" these days..look around and see all these tweaked out
kids...you cant even go up to them and give them a hug anymore..which I
think is a shame..doesnt everbody love hugs?..so..again to clarify my
point..i agree that drugs will always be part of our "scene"..but should
we prioritize this over what is more important........peace..christian

man, i've been away for too damn long...

:)


my take on the role drugs play in the rave scene:

you CAN rave without drugs and have an excellent time and feel the vibe and
give love and dance and that's beautiful...

but i don't think the scene would exist today if it hadn't been for the
drugs. the concepts of peace and love and all that have existed for a long
time, but i think it was Ecstasy that really drove those ideas home in the
minds of most ravers.  the idea of "we're all one" that really drives a
spiritual vibe at some parties has been around for a while, but that idea
was never quite real for me until i took acid.

_maybe_ you could take away all the drugs and the scene would keep on
going. i don't know.   but i think drugs were one of the integral building
blocks that allowed the scene to flourish in the first place, and they are
still very much a part of that scene. i doubt i would have fallen in love
with raving if i'd been sober at my first party.

and besides, who'd want to take away the drugs?  (okay, okay, i know...)

the problem with the media's portrayal of raves as drug-fests is the
negativity implicit in that... the idea that we're all putting ourselves at
great risk for nothing but a bit of hedonistic pleasure.  while there is
_some_ risk, and the pleasure is nothing to sneeze at, there's a lot more
to it than that -- which is exactly why drugs are an important part of the
scene.

Not a flame, but I just wanted to say that I fell in love with raving
after my first party, and I even managed to dance longer and harder
than my friends who were all up on speed that night...and the only
thing I was on was the excitement I felt because I was raving for the
first time.  I think it's kinda sad that you didn't get a chance to
rave sober the first time since one's first rave is probably, imho, one
of the most memorable.

This is supposed to be "Consciouness Lab Ambient Sound Research."  FYI,
"RE:" will be performing live with C-Lab at this party.  You will most
likely hear down beat, idm, and d&b out of us rather than ambient.  We still
all love ambient, but we've just been branching out into other realms.  See
you there.

"You'll come for the drugs...you'll stay for the fellowship"
(That was humor, BTW)
I agree with what Christian says here.  If a person's primary interest is
in getting high, there are many, often less expensive or free, alternate
environments that are perfectly suitable.

i think notifying the media would definitely be stooopid and
irresponsible as well as just plain old mean.  If people are happy with
their group then good for them, but i don't think it is their right or
perrogative-sp? to ruin the scene for everyone else.  Massives-as much
as i *personally* dislike them- do serve a purpose.

back east a LOT of the parties are *underground* and invite only....and
i'm not sure that serves any positive purpose.

One thing i DO like about the SF scene is its openess.  I remember when
i started partying 5 years ago i really appreciated having the option to
choose from several parties.  Having these options gave me the ability
to actually CHOOSE my place in the scene and CHOOSE which type of
parties i want to go to and be involved with.  By going to bad parties i
was able to appreciate the good parties and really see and appreciate
the effort that goes into the *good* ones. okay i'm rambling...sorry.

To sum it up:
Choice is good and i feel that i nor anyone else has the right to
dictate what is right for other people.  Let people figure it out for
themselves and lets leave the media OUT of this, because that will only
do BAD for everyone.

Hip hip hurray! I take it he means March 5th, though. To add to the

	I think that one of the most insidious things about drug use
is that it tends to make you attribute any positive experience you 
might have to the drug. If you participate in some wonderful meditation
ritual that gets you totally stoned while you're on E, you're likley to 
think "wow, the E is really kicking in hard" rather than "wow, that was
a really powerful ritual."

	The flip side of this is that it tends to make you believe
you *can't* really enjoy yourself without the drug ...

I just wanted to say that I went to my first rave sober (@16) and
continued to go for the music (still sober) till I was 18....I think a
major problem that hinders the progression of the rave culture (I said
hinder not stop) is the excessive use of drugs. I've seen too many people
go downhill due to excessive drug use and overdose. I'm not saying stop
using drugs, start using drugs or change your habits, I don't think it's
my right to tell any of you what to do or not do. I am asking that
you as human just think about what you do before you do it, think about 
who it will affect and be smart about what you do. Hey, if you don't look
out for you body and brain and community who is????

Wayne, et al,

I think we're all in agreement here, that the scene, for the most part, 
is in unhealthy trend towards making drugs the #1 priority.

Let's not argue about it then, OK.  Let's start talking about how we, 
individually and collectively, are going to combat this trend.  How can 
we re-emphasize and return to our sense of "community"?

peace

 That's a widespread opinion in "our" American culture. That's why 
you can be drugless ( but not sober ) dancing "in the light" and folks 
will be coming up to you and assume you're on some great drug(s) , and 
they want some of what got you to your ecstatic state. 

 I've been dancing in my trippy sorta way for 20 years, and the same
question used to come my way more than once.

 It's all part of our "ingestion to happiness" culture. Buy something,
ingest/use it, and get deleriously happy and fullfilled. Hey, it
happens to everybody else in TV commercials, why can't I ? But, you can't
get there unless you buybuybuy something outside yourself - you're
weird or even dangerous if you can get out of this world without the
help of "stuff".

I realize this you are being rhetorical, but here is my rhetoric.


my 2
is that Rave is the concept of an all night gathering of dancing and
partying.  A party is a grassroots Rave.  Generally, people refer to
massives as Raves, and underground parties as Parties.  In the past,
when House music was breaking, there were house parties.  I did not hear
the word "Rave" until that ear-hurting "James Brown is Dead" song came
out and and someone told me about the concept of the all-night
gatherings that happened outside of the club venue.  That is probably
why I personally can't call a club night with techno a "Rave."  DJ's
have been spinning all kind of dance music in clubs since the disco era,
and it is constantly changing genre, so what's the dif now?  Since the
music that was originally introduced to the public in the Rave venue is
now and has been in liquor-licensed clubs, people sometimes call them
"Raves"  It's more important to seperate the music from the venue when
talking about it, but it is less important to validate one venue from
the other.  People have preferences over both the music and the venue. 
It's just nice to have a choice in this city.  It's not like that in
Boston, that's for sure.  Be glad we have a really loving, caring,
wonderful scene here, overall, I mean!!!

Peace,

Goldilox

THIS SHOW IS NOT TO BE MISSED!

>Lee Perry is in many ways the originator and inspiration for many of ...

>Not only that, but his shows here are with Mad Professor....

I have been waiting for a show like this for years. You will not be
dissapointed. This guy(Lee Perry) is absolutely crazy... with some very
funny lyrics, from childish jibberish to downright nasty. And lately it
seems that anything the Mad Professor touches turns to gold.

Anyway some releases I have currently been into are:

-Lee Perry - Who put the voodoo pon reggae (with the Mad Professor) Kind
of overproduced with some really booming bass that your body will not be
able to sit still for. A good version of "Come back"

-Lee Perry - Experiments at the grass roots of dub - This is alot more
experimental. I'm really glad someone is willing to put out something
alittle less mainstream, as far a bub or dub/reggae goes. This one has
some interesting underwater-sounding  vocals. 

Hope to see some of you at the show,

Martin

I agree completely with you; drugs ARE a part of the scene AND
they play an important part of the scene.  BUT this doesn't also
mean that they are THE most important aspect of the scene.  I've
been hoping that the recent pleas by various people, including
yourself, to focus back on the important things rather than the
drug aspect would be headed.  Unfortunately this doesn't seem to
be happening too much (the recent dinner/drop getogether for the
NYE makeup party being an example; not to pick on anyone in particular,
it's just one that sticks out in recent memory.)  

To me, the things that are important are those you mentioned, all which 
come from the gathering together of our community to share ourselves with
each other.  It's through our ability to share our love and compassion
for each other that we gain.  The insight brought about through E is
secondary, IMO.

I've grown and discovered new things about myself through my interaction
with you all, and I would hope that everyone else who may come into
our scene would have the same opportunity.  They need to be properly
prepared for what they will encounter and how they can benefit from
it, not misinformed by some tabloid t.v. show and shut out of this
growth.

as do i.  but i doubt that i would have initially. you are fortunate,
perhaps, that you were able to see the value in raving without chemical
enhancement. i don't think i could have.

It is kinda sad at any point to 
> need the drugs to enjoy what you are doing. 

WHY? what makes it sad?  true, it's sad that this society directs us to
such an ingrained place of negativity that some people can't see past the
negativity to the light and love in the world.  but there is nothing sad
about the fact that Ecstasy enabled me to see that positivity.

and i did enjoy the 2 hours i spent sober at my first rave.  in fact, i
enjoyed them a lot, i gained an immediate appreciation for techno, and i
discovered for the first time the joy of dancing.  i'm not knocking the
non-drug-induced benefits of raves.  however, without E, raving
would have been little different from clubbing for me-- not
something i'm usually into.  taking Ecstasy that night, on the other hand, 
_changed my life_.

i don't think we should be so quick to say "this ISN'T about drugs!"
anymore than the media should be so quick to say that's ALL it's about...
the truth lies somewhere in between.  drugs are ONLY a PART of this scene,
but they can be a VALUABLE part of the scene if we are conscious of their
benefits and risks and use them accordingly.

Love and Light,

bri

I'm glad that people recognize that there are greater components to 
raving than just a "drug party," but I have to respond to what I feel is 
a hypocritical anti-drug tinge to these discussions.

I'm pretty tired of seeing anti-drug tirades against all those people who 
use them "for the wrong reasons" or "too much" with the disclaimer at the 
end, "note: I am NOT AGAINST DRUGS.  I take them often myself!"  Why is 
it that people feel THEIR drug use is reasonable but others' indulgence, and 
drug use in the scene, is somehow worse (or different from their own?!).
The "scene's" use is composed of a bunch of individuals' using, that 
includes a lot of the critics.

I'm also concerned that we are adopting the mainstream culture's
anti-recreational drug use mentality (except alcohol and tobacco, which
are just fine, of course).  For example, we must defend drug use as
transcendental, OR we must distance ourselves from the stereotype of a drug
party.  Why is this same standard not applied to alcohol?!  In other 
words, why can't it just be accepted that the dominant mood-altering 
substances at parties are drugs rather than alcohol.  Would you go to a club 
and then feel you had to defend the fact that you had a few drinks?!

In other words, apologies for choosing to indulge are expected only for
DRUGS, not for alochol.  Can you imagine - "I went to a club, and it was
just a huge booze fest!  Now, I drink too, but not to the extent as those
who use ethanol for the wrong reasons.  And it's really a shame that so 
many people feel they have to drink just because it's a club."

What bothers me, basically, is the assumption I see that drug use is 
categorically bad, and therefore one must jump to criticize the use, or 
must justify your own use in a higher context than just having fun.  

Yes, drugs can be just recreational, or they can have a higher intent.  But
why are we then judging one to be more valid than the other?  Doesn't that
seemingly liberal, "enlightened" approach actually smack of anti-drug
propaganda - i.e. forcing drugs to be evaluted on some arbitrary standard
that alcohol does not have to live up to? 

Try your morning without coffee, a deep depression without that slice of 
chocolate cake, and the party at your friend's house without a glass of 
wine before slamming ravers for doing drugs at a PARTY.

A moderate druggie
and proud of it,
N

Re: "hey, let's focus on the community and the hugging...."

Yeah, but all the hugging and the community and the music and the dancing
in the world is not going to overcome the public's opinions on the stigma
of raves being a happy haven for kids to experiment with drugs. Many of
these kids are tweaked out on Ecstacy, LSD, Ketamine, GHB, pot, or a
mixture of those etc. at an age when it would be considered quite a scandal
if they were caught with beer in their posession.

You *have* to change that reality before the majority of the population
will be able to hear about the good aspects of raving: love, hugs, music,
community or anything else, and to an extent, these are still all memes of
a subculture in denial. Unless you do that, ravers/raving/raves *will* be
perceived (correctly) as a subculture in denial about their collective drug
useage.

To add another comparison, There are other groups and other eras that had
the same problems and the same realities with regard to being a community
of predominately drug users that socialized in groups, locations, music,
bands, etc. that ultimately found cohesion from their collective drug usege:

"The 60's."

As a group, they had all the negative and positive aspects that the world
wide rave scene has, and to this day, you can't be a proponent of that
subculture without a "regular" person retorting "But wasn't that just a
bunch of hippy kids high on acid and pot?" and if you are a truthful
person, you must answer "Yes."

Ravers are, stereotypically, "just a bunch of slacker kids high on acid and
pot, (and now even more)" and must be equally honest with themselves as a
demographic that the community that they choose to associate themselves and
their image with, for the most part, is comprised of a bunch young people
that really like to get high.

I am not calling you that. I am not calling me that. I am not calling my
friends that I celebrate with on an almost weekly basis that, but there are
a *lot* more of "them" than there are of "us", and until "they" can be
educated, can be excited about going out to a rave without the primary
directive to be "to score some E" and to really appreciate everything that
raving is "while sober", we're doomed to be lumped into the stereotypical
collective of "rave" that is fundamentally based on getting high.

But We (and the SF Raves community in general) are not a representative
sample of the world wide rave community. If you want to see a more
representative sample, go to a Ghost Tribe or Bagok Tribe or almost any
other "least common denominator" ma$$ive "come one, come all, just bring
your $20" type party -- take a look around. The meadian age hovers around
15 or 16 and the *majority* of the people there will be high as a kite.

That is not the reason that or the people I go out with to celebrate, but I
am never looking to associate with the "median" of any subculture, so you
won't find me there.

But your parents, your civic leaders, and your churches will not know the
difference, and it's not really their responsibility to understand the
nuances between what "We" do and what "the median" does while at or why
they go to a rave. They don't have to. "The median's" actions are in the
fat middle of the bell curve that is rightfully used to determine the
essence of any statistically arranged collection of data -- and that
basically tells all you need to know.

Symantically he was quite correct and you backed him up.  After all, high
is high, yes?

Anyway...

but I know plenty of people who go to raves just to enjoy the music.  drugs
play a part, but not in everyones experince.  it is up to the person at the
rave how they want to experince the rave.  what things they want to do while
at the rave.  but first and foremost it's about the music.  it was about the
music forst, but then drugs made their way onto the scene.  yes, to most it
may seem like drugs are the key element at raves.  a little e, some nitrous.
 it's all part of the experince.  but it goes deeper than that, one must look
at the rave as a place to get a close to techno as you can.  drugs, for some
people, enhance this experince.  For some people there is nothing that makes
the music come alive like drugs.  But I know plenty of people that use drugs,
but go to raves, and stay sober (sometimes) their take on the rave is that it
kicked ass.  if the dj is good enough, and he/she is spinnin' a set that is
just GOOD.  then you don't particularly need to enhance the experince with
drugs.  though for some people it might help.
     you can't say somebody is wrong for going to a rave/party and takeing
drugs.  because even if drugs wheren't a major factor to the scene in the
begining, they have become a major factor.  What people must do is reliaze
that not everyone at a rave is doing drugs.  that many come to the rave
solely to listen to good techno.  to see their favorite dj spin.  raves
produce a bond wiht people.  friendship cards, adresses, email adresses, all
of those things bring people closer together, that is what a rave can do.  it
is about the vibe that is at the rave.  if the mindstate that you come i with
is that I just wan to get fucked up, then the vibe shrinks a little.  If
everyone does that then you've got a lot of people that are gone.  But if you
come in with the minstate of haveing a good time, groving to some really good
techno, maybe doing some drugs, then the vibe is intact.  and everyone,
wether thier doing drugs or not can enjoy the rave.
after all it's about music....about good fucking techno blasting  you away.  
peace

I disagree.  It's usually the easiest means for teenagers to buy drugs.
Especially E, speed, and K.  The sensory overload is what many people I've
met want from the experience of being on drugs at raves.  On top of that,
there is very little, if any, authority checking on what they're doing
there.  Tell me many other places you can find like this at 15 - 18 years
old.

This mailing list probably draws the people who are most supportive of the
rave culture of the population at any given party by virtue of the fact
that we're reading and writing about it every single day.  A lot of you
seem to be getting much more from these parties than a drug experience.
Not so for a majority of the people out there at a party.  A lot of them
may be at the beginning of their search for "something more", but for
younger party goers, it's about experimentation and new experience.

If you do get something more from the scene than a place to get high,
hell yeah you'd love to shake the negative connotations that the scene
has with it's tight knit to the drug culture in the public's eye.  I doubt
this will ever happen, and that's sad in a way to those of us.

To those that feel drugs are great and intergral to the scene and the
"peace love and unity", why wouldn't they put drugs on their flyers and
sell drugs and push for their legalization?  The people that I've met
that have this view aren't saying it's only about the drugs (and would
anyone ever anyway?), they're saying it's about the drugs & the music &
the family.

Isn't the view that there is nothing wrong with doing drugs (excuse me,
"responsibly") the attitude of ravers at large?  I personally can't
subscribe to this belief, and it makes me hot and cold about the rave
scene all the time.  I've realized over my time and involvement in this
culture that I've been on a quest for meaning in life, spirituality, and
fulfillment.

Youth subcultures have seemingly replaced organized religion for many
people I've met in the last eight years, and your first statement really
pointed evidence to me once again of this, even if in jest--as with
organized churches, people go to find fellowship with others who share
beliefs and ideas and moral opinions.  I wonder how many people on here
who are really involved still find their spirituality from somewhere
other than the rave scene.

If you've got some thoughts and opinions on this, I'd love to hear them.

peace,
Marshal

Does anybody know which of the DJs from the last Spundae (2/16) were
spinning upstairs (besides Jeno)? That was truly great music up there and
I'm trying to find out if any of those guys have CDs or tapes.

hey all!

so i guess just about everyone's gonna goto PNY tomorrow nite. so, 
i thought this would be a good time to bring up the subject of sfraves 
laminates. i guess there's not a lot of laminates floatin around out 
there. i've been wanting one for the longest, and haven't been able to 
obtain one til anthony E gave me his (thanx guy, that wuz soooo kool!). 
i know a lotta you prolly want one also, so, i asked my friend (from 
nyc-rave...he does liquid magazine and soon to come on march 3rd, 303 
magazine <~~~~ya'll should check it out, its PHAT! http://www.vibe.org , 
sorry for that lil bit of spam) to design one, and he did, and it turned 
out pretty kool, i think. anyhow, i'm gonna try to print them out and 
copy them at kinkos and laminate them...maybe 'bout 200 of the... by 
tomorrow nite. 

So, if any of u'all would like one, come ask me for one tomorrow at PNY. 
I'm feelin kinda sick, but i'm still gonna try to make it. $6 for a

Sounds like a bust since the Beach is off limits after 10pm and is
frequently patrolled.

Irving Walsh (author of "Trainspotting") has a new novel out about the
club and drug culture called (ahem) "Ecstasy."  Kinda pertinent to our
discussion about the perception of the scene's inseparability with drugs,
especially _that_ one!  His other books have been well-reviewed, so I'm
gonna pick this one up... 

BTW, I learned of this in a review in UC Berkeley's student paper, which 
writes that this novel is supposed to appeal to the "rave generation - a 
blanket term for those staving off the impending boredom of adulthood in 
a drug-fueled blitz."  Jeez.  (And I thought at 27 I already qualified as 
an adult!  guess not!)

 I've been a Methodist my entire life. And while I know that many people in
the scene feel at least somewhat religious towards raving and it's
lifestyle, it is far from being an organized one. I mean, if anything
SFRaves shows us that even among us the subscribers, there is no clear
sharing of similar beliefs, ideas, or moral opinions. Oh shure, there are a
couple of things that are shared, like a belief in living with Peace Love
Unity & Respect, or that blacklites are pretty cool, and Underground Dance
Music rules, but that's far from being a complete religion. What do I mean
by "complete religion"? Every major religion that I can think of has a
belief about how/why the world came into being, how/why human beings showed
up, specific do's and don'ts, ect.  There are exceptions, ofcource. I can't
really say I know much about Scientology (except that they hate
newsgroups), for example. Or remote religions like Balinese or Confushism.

 I'm not saying Raving (or an offshoot of) will never have religious
beliefs. But religions take time to develop. Raving's only been around a
little while, people! Give it time.

I do wish that Christianity would in some ways be more accepted into Raving
culture. Often I see Buddhist or Hindu or some other "eastern" religion's
art at a party. I guess this is because  because Christianity has in the
past been the most visible religion for people in this country and eastern
religions in general have a more open attitude about altered states, sex,
ect.

 And while I'm at it I'm going to get one last Religiously Rave Related
Rant (say that 5x fast) out: Whenever the topic of contemporary religion is
mentioned in this group, Christians are usually getting knocked one way or
the other. I pretty much keep my trap shut when this happens because that
thread would go nowhere fast. But I do want to mention that not all
Christians share the same beliefs. Examples: While Catholics do not openly
accept homosexuals as part of their congregation, Methodists do and without
a "Don't ask don't tell" policy. We OPENLY welcome all people. (Sound
familiar?)  And in California, many Methodist Churches have offered their
churches as sanctuary for people to buy and sell medical marijuana. The
reason? "Jesus broke the law of the land to help people." And in some ways
Christianity has been wrongly portraed by the media. (As if EVERY Church
Father was a child molester) Sound familiar too?

Give Christianity a break, it's not all bad. You may even *gasp* like some
of it.

Hi folks!  ]=)


 A few days ago someone stated that E had meth-amphetamine in it. I 
answered that I thought it was only related to amphetamines by the virtue 
of the last A in MDMA.

 Someone obviously thought I was way off base and sent back (in all upper 
case) that the MA in MDMA stood for meth-amphetamine.

 Well, I drug out (  ;)  ) my trusty Psychedelics Encyclopedia to see 
wha' s'up.

 from page III - 65 

MDMA -- full name is N-methyl-3,4-mehylenedioxyphenylisopropylamine


 MDA is 3-4 methylendioxy-amphetamine or 3-4 methylendioxyphenylisopropylamine

from pages III-67 & 282 (I'm paraphrasing)

 Aminization (chemical conversion to amine form) makes MDA, MDMA and 
amphetamines, meth-amphetamines.

oh, cool.  i actually like it when calm discussions start about 
religion.  sounds actually like methodist is a pretty cool religion.  one 
question seemed to come up about people finding spirituality from places 
other than raving.  

i wasn't brought up christian, catholic...whatever.  in fact, in school, 
i wasn't exposed to any of that.  i remember my gramma was, she used to 
go to church and eat those funny looking bread things that i wanted to 
eat too, but my gramma didn't want to let me.  i just thought they looked 
yummy!  well if you saw how overweight i was when i was 5, you would 
understand that everything looked yummy.  

but anyway, back to spirituality.  those of you who may have read the 
'birds' post a while back...that is when i found spirituality.  but it 
wasn't just instant.  i actually read books by anton wilson and listend 
to some terence mckenna tapes which suggested an idea of god being the 
entire universe, and therefore since i am part of it, me being a part of 
god.  hence the phrase "god within".  maybe some of you know that old 
hardkiss song.  

obviously it should be true that we can find spirituality without 
raving.  but it's a definite way for a lot of people.  who is to say 
'god', whoever he may be (NO, IT'S A HE, NO IT'S A SHE!...oh, go 
away...yanno?)  one time as i was smokin a fatty with my now passed on 
David Sarlin...I said "do you think our race will evolve to where we 
don't need drugs to reach these dimensions?"  He said, "Yeah, yeah..."  
Man i loved that guy.  he was so generous.  

maybe we can just look at raves and drugs as a launch pad to take us to 
the next level.  level of what?  well, of spirituality of course.  a 
dimension where only the people that can conquer their own fears make it 
out whole.  and there is a tremedous reward for conquering one's own 
fears.  total peace of mind.  that's more than any amount of $$ could 
buy, any morsel of food could satisfy, and any drug or other stimulant could 
please you.  

love you guyz...mean it.

Hi all!  ]=)


 I recently recieved notice from UCSC to remove my sig file with it's 
refrence to Dionysus Dreams. This came about due to a complaint that 
someone called in.

 I'm sorry to say I strongly suspect that this complaint came from one of 
the three lists I'm sending this post to. Most likely a SFraves 
subscriber (but I have NO way of knowing anything for certain here).

 I am somewhat saddened by this realisation but not surprised. I do hope 
the individual who did this is reading this. I don't hate you, I'm just 
very saddened. I am exceptionally poor and working very hard to put myself 
through school. I was hoping to get my own buisness off the ground and 
my sig file was an attempt to do this.

 In any case I am now well known enough so that removing my sig file 
doesn't really matter. I doubt it did me much good anyway. People hire me 
because I am dedicated and produce kick ass results when I bring my 
little circus to town.

yours in peace,


Ran D.Dreams

for managing to throw a damn good party despite all the BS.  These
people had it together: nice space, free fruit, good music, one person
with their ear to a police scanner AT ALL TIMES, sane dealings with the
police when one did show up, and all in all this is the first big party
I know of that went off all night in SJ without a bust (I'm sure there
have been more but I never heard of them).

Sure, the whole volume thing was a bummer, but I actually enjoyed being
able to talk to other people without yelling for a change, so it wasn't
all bad.

So to all those who were stressing hard, losing backpacks, dealing with
The Man, and everything else in order to make it happen: thank you, and
congratulations.

but I know plenty of people who go to raves just to enjoy the music.  drugs
play a part, but not in everyones experince.  it is up to the person at the
rave how they want to experince the rave.  what things they want to do while
at the rave.  but first and foremost it's about the music.  it was about the
music forst, but then drugs made their way onto the scene.  yes, to most it
may seem like drugs are the key element at raves.  a little e, some nitrous.
 it's all part of the experince.  but it goes deeper than that, one must look
at the rave as a place to get a close to techno as you can.  drugs, for some
people, enhance this experince.  For some people there is nothing that makes
the music come alive like drugs.  But I know plenty of people that use drugs,
but go to raves, and stay sober (sometimes) their take on the rave is that it
kicked ass.  if the dj is good enough, and he/she is spinnin' a set that is
just GOOD.  then you don't particularly need to enhance the experince with
drugs.  though for some people it might help.
     you can't say somebody is wrong for going to a rave/party and takeing
drugs.  because even if drugs wheren't a major factor to the scene in the
begining, they have become a major factor.  What people must do is reliaze
that not everyone at a rave is doing drugs.  that many come to the rave
solely to listen to good techno.  to see their favorite dj spin.  raves
produce a bond wiht people.  friendship cards, adresses, email adresses, all
of those things bring people closer together, that is what a rave can do.  it
is about the vibe that is at the rave.  if the mindstate that you come i with
is that I just wan to get fucked up, then the vibe shrinks a little.  If
everyone does that then you've got a lot of people that are gone.  But if you
come in with the minstate of haveing a good time, groving to some really good
techno, maybe doing some drugs, then the vibe is intact.  and everyone,
wether thier doing drugs or not can enjoy the rave.
after all it's about music....about good fucking techno blasting  you away.

Just for fun, check out this clipping that showed up (part of a drug news
bulletin) in my box right next to Wayne's message:

FRANCE: To seduce adolescents, publicity agencies use more or less
disguised forms of  drug-related illusions.  Ads are filled with "rave"
codes related to the use of Ecstasy, that are not picked up on by parents
or censors.

but younger party goers also--(if they know what their doing,) know what the
hell is going on.  I myself took the drugs, then got interested i what
exactly io was takeing.  the net proved a very useful thing for that.  at
these raves you've gpot to expect to draw a somwhat 'street smart' youth, who
knows what the fuck e is, what speed is.  and probably have done it befor.
 everyone that i've talked to has told me to not try things for the first
time at raves.  and most youths today have been brought up in the know.  or
at least that is the way i feel about it.  maybe their not walking
encyclopedias on drugs, but they know what they are, and what they do.  this
of course cannot speak for everyone at a rave, the unusaula naive, or stupiod
that goto a rave, then try e, for the first time, might find it to be fun,
enjoyable, stimulating.  but they probably could have/would have done it on
the streeet had they not been at that rave.....
     peace,

Hi Beautiful Ppl-

Just in case you think techno hasn't spread to all life forms..

I caught a speech by Kim Polese of Marimba and Vint Cerf (aka the "father of 
the Internet") on Wednesday.  Vint had a short video intro, which was set to 
some pretty pounding techno. Pretty cool for a 60+ year old technology geezer!  
We'll have to get him to a rave some time!  Prolly see y'all at the NY makeup 
party. Price is right, commercialism notwithstanding.

Nathan

Drugs, drugs drugs.

It seems that this list has gone to only discussing drugs this last week. 

We all know that some ravers take drugs. We also all know that some
senators, mayors, police officers, parents, and teachers do the same. There
is no 'scene' in which some of the participants do not use drugs. The
people in the rave scene approach this fact differently, making the
decision to inform those who do take drugs what possible side effects,
benifits, and experiences that the use of each drug may have or cause. The
openness in talking about such a taboo topic draws attention such as
Gay/Lesbian materials did not that long ago. 

The fact remains that there are those who are in the rave scene for the
drugs alone. Yet there are people in every scene that are not in it for the
all, such as those who go to church only because they know there are
virgins there.

I'm keeping this short because I've made my point, I'm just going to ask
one thing, could we please start a discussion on something other than a
dead horse?

-much love

Well, it's not totally barren out there, as anyone who's been to St. John's
Divine Rhythm Society can attest.  Along similar lines, I thought I'd
mention:

Techno Cosmic Mass.  Sunday 23 February, 7 pm, at We the People Auditorium,
2nd & Harrison, Oakland.  510-835-4827.

"The Techno Cosmic Mass blends Western liturgical tradition with ecstatic
music and dance, urban shamanism, multimedia imagery, and Eastern and
indigenous spiritual elements to create a multi-cultural, intergenerational
and ecumenical form of worship.  Celebration of this Mass has uplifted and
inspired young and old of diverse faiths and traditions from coast to
coast."

I'd like to point out that St. John's Divine Rhythm Society
celebrations are transdenominational, open to people
of all faiths, or of no faith at all.  Although SJDRS events take
place in an Episcopalian church,  we are not in any way
affiliated with the church.  It is very important to SJDRS planners
that our event *not* promote Christianity or any other specific
spiritual path other than the ones that individual attendees choose
for themselves.

If there is any particular spiritual view fostered by SJDRS, it is
only the idea that "We are one in the Dance."

Lee

Mine will be there :)
Shall we have a meeting place like at Love-Affair?? is there one already?

If there isn't, how about if we all meet outside :) in the middle of the
place 
at 12:00. It won't be hard to locate ourselves if we are all in the same
spot :)

Just an idea...
Hugs

My mom will be 47 on Tuesday.

I was sure to educate my mom, prior to the party, about what she was
going to see.  Still, she left at about 11:45, so not many people were
high yet.  That's probably a good thing.

My mom's pretty open-minded.  She understands drugs a lot better than
some people.  She also knows that not everybody does drugs.  I explained
to her that the rave scene helped in my getting into drugs, but it also
taught me how to do without them.

I'm planning on taking my mother to more parties, so she'll have plenty
of opportunities to learn more about the scene.

You go!! :)  I **totally** agree, I am so sick and tired of some of the
caffeine freaks of the world trying to tell me *I* might be wrong for
using drugs!
I tend to believe that caffeine and alcohol are the opiates of the masses.
I've heard of VERY few trancendental experiences associated with the
average cup of coffee; people just drink it 'cause they're hooked on the
stuff.  And (imho) people are little more than blind sheep for not
admitting it to themselves, let alone each other.  Recreational
psychoactives, on the other hand, are often the doorways for the
shepherds.  It's true that not everyone who uses psychoactives uses them
for personal development, but the simple fact is that the *opportunity is
there* for personal realization and enhancement, whereas this potential is
almost completely lacking in caffeine and chocolate, and even alcohol
(although not quite to such a great extent, as alcohol *can* open people
up, IF used in the proper context).  
Anyways, just my $.02 again...  Thanx Nancy for the killer post!  :)

No.  If it's someone who's posted to the list, then look in
http://hyperreal.com/raves/sf/people/, or even
http://hyperreal.com/raves/sf/archives/ if you need to.  If they're on the
list but have never posted, let me know and I might be willing to look
them up on the list (the membership list is not made completely public).

I have been meaning to respond to this thread for a while now, but just 
haven't gotten around to it.  Don't worry it will be short and sweet (and 
hopefully not flame bait!:)

The aspect of raves that struck me first was the freedom of it.  Freedom 
to do drugs, to not do drugs, to dance with utter abandon, to roll around 
on the floor, to make new friends, to sit by yourself, to enjoy 
the music, whatever.  The thing is - just about anything is accepted (at 
least to a degree).  IMHO, that is still the coolest thing about raving.  We 
are all free to experience it in our own way (as long as we don't hurt 
anyone).  I will be sorry when that changes.  I, personally, enjoy raves 
sober, my reasons for going tend to have to do more with the music than 
anything.  But, I don't want to tell others how to enjoy their rave 
experience.  I was free to experiment when I wanted to and I am glad; I 
wouldn't change any of it.  Granted, some people are not incredibly 
educated about the concept of moderation, some are a little young to 
be making educated decisions, some will never educate themselves; but 
aren't there always people like that - in every group or scene?  I agree 
we can do our best to educate each other, about the dangers of doing to 
much, not knowing what you are doing or who you are getting it from, 
knowing when to stop, etc...But, there will always be those that f*ck up 
and there is not much we can do about that.  That's just part of life. 
  
I really don't care a whole lot what society in general
thinks raves are (just like I don't care what it "thinks" about a lot of 
things :).   I know what raves are - to me - and that's whatever I make 
them.  

I love that many ravers are into higher pursuits, like healing the earth, 
nurturing community, peace, fighting hunger and homelessness, and the 
list goes on.  I wonder how much of that comes from opening their minds 
with psychoactives?  Hmmm.
I don't know if raving will change the world for the better, but if it does
it would be the icing on the cake.  Because in the meantime, we all just 
have a really good time (while we're not fighting about it:), don't we?  
(sorry about the babbling - I thought it was going to be short!)

Cheers***
Cami

hi all:



__ new design ___

it's time to announce some more great news!  those of you who have visited
x-radio recently have noticed a dramatic change in the site layout and
design.  i think it's much stronger, much nicer, and considerably cleaner
than the old design, so please check it out again sometime soon if you
haven't seen it yet.

every sunday from now on we will feature a new music title, which we'll
place on the front of the site (goa gil, an awesome trancer, is this week's
feature... our first).  this will be a title that the entire x-radio crew
agrees is one of the best available.  we'll encode all the tracks, tell you
a little about it, and even put the cover art on the site so you can check
it out.  we'll try to pick carefully from all our favourite genres to keep
things balanced.  if you have any favorites, let us know!



__ new server ___

on wednesday we retired the old hardware and installed a new pentium pro 200
motherboard and processor.  it's fast!



__ new music ___

in addition, we have added a second distributor to the x-radio supplier
list, so our title list has more than doubled to about 560 different cd's
now.  i may be wrong, but i believe this is one of the largest selections of
techno titles on the web.  i've also got another two distributors in the
works, and once we bring their catalog's on-line, we'll have a complete
selection of the more mainstream titles, including Future Sound of London,
Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and Astral Matrix. Of course, we will continue
to search for the best independent labels on the planet so you can get the
best selection around.



__ new year ___

and, as somebody pointed out to me the other day, february marks our
one-year anniversary!  we wanted to have a party, but nobody's had time to
plan one.  i guess i'll just have to spend more time at other parties to
make up...



__ new plans ___

and our plans for the near future...

 a secure server, 
 another thousand cd titles, 
 a few live events,
 some killer dj mixes,
 and a music-oriented music mailing list!




take care!

pauly and
the x-radio crew

Hello all!

Figured I'd write a bit of a review whilst I wait for my broccoli to cook
(yes, it is currently 5:30 am and I just got back!).

WOOHOO!  I had *such* a KICKASS time at this party!  It has been quite a
while since I've really gone out, as many of you know, and this was the
first party I've been to in several months.  Started out beautifully, when I
read the price tag, $5!  Now *that's* a great price!  Like gee, I coulda
bought a big mac & large fries instead. ;)  Anyway, nifty space, at the
Cyborganic office, I like the two story setup, groovin funky ambient stuff
upstairs, and pounding techno (a lot of detroit from what I heard)
downstairs.  I found the vibe to be very groovy both upstairs and down.  And
it was so wonderful after all this time not raving to see so many friendly
faces of so many friends I haven't seen in so long!  I was quite surprised
at the number of friends I saw there, kept hearing from other people "wow,
this is the old school crowd!  They've all come out of the woodworks!"  I'm
so completely happy to have been able to make it to a party where I could
see all the beautiful people I "grew up with" over the past year and a half.
It felt pretty old school to me (as I hear described on the list nowadays it
seems), every where I looked people were smiling, if you made eye contact
the smiles grew wider, Nancy had oranges of course! :) people were blowing
bubbles, people had glitter & pacifiers, and it was just so nice to see so
many familiar faces.  Had several amazing experiences here.  One was the
music.  It rocked!  I have not danced so hard (boy will I be sore tomorrow!
:) since last september at the Harmony 3 Year party (geez, five months!).  I
just looove that hard pounding techno.  And more specifically:  this is the
first party where *several times* a dj would play a song that I have at
home, completely *love*, but never expected to actually get to hear it at a
party!  And fuckin Minor Minor did it wild, he has now twice done that for
me on two separate occasions, played a song I love but *never* thought I'd
hear it at a party, in fact this time played my ultimate favorite song, the
one I least expected to hear at a party, Birds On E!  Ack! Me and Brad
thought we were gonna die when we heard that,  "oh my god!! it's birds on e!
Aaahh!"  Stub out the barely smoked cigarettes, mad dash out onto the dance
floor to grind our feet into the ground, hee hee! :):)  Frank boy, you made
my night.  And then I also got to hear a couple of faves I know from Joe
Rice's tape (altho he was not dj'ing at the time), also some big time
favorites.  Boy when that happened, I really thought I was gonna explode
along with everybody else, everybody's screamin & yellin at the top of their
lungs, such amazing dance floor energy.  You know the kind, where you make
occasional eye-contact with other dancers, and you both smile at each other
cuz you just *know*!  I danced so hard, I just couldn't keep it up any more
(gotta switch twixt downstairs & upstairs every now & then) so I headed
upstairs again to see what went on up there.  Get up there & everybody's
groovin big time to the ambient stuff that's going on, and then they throw
on "Sexual Healing" by Margin Gay!  That was so cool!  I've never heard that
song in that context before, very groovy, nice touch.  The positive energy
was just so high this evening, my cheek muscles were beginning to hurt from
smiling so much, honest!  

And another groovy experience was that I did this whole party sober, and had
a *fucking great* time, which really means a lot to me.  Of course I know
academically that I can have a good time with our without drugs, but those
amazing times when I have such a kickass incredibly intense time at a party
with no drugs just really drives that point home to me yet again.  And I
still did all the great e-things people do at parties, hang out with friends
in little love-puddles etc, and it felt just as great and natural doing it
all completely sober, which was wonderful!  It really means a lot to me,
because it really proves to me that I am into raving for (what I consider to
be) the right reasons: the music, the vibe, the wonderful random people you
run into again & again, beautiful friends, sharing experiences with people,
and generally being at peace with myself when I'm there.  This experience of
course is very important to me when I have them on something (insert
appropriate drug here), these drugs often facilitate these situations,
allowing people to have them when they would otherwise be too uptight or
caught up in their own little worlds, which I find beautiful that such a
thing can help people do that.  But to be able to do that without any of
that really makes me feel like I've grown, evolved, become more who I want
to be for real.  That was all me out there tonight, and it's all me now, and
it will be all me when I wake up in the morning (afternoon? ;) feeling
refreshed and ready for another day instead of spun out and grouchy. :)
Yippeee! 

What a beautiful weekend this has been.  Spent the first part of it with he
whom I love eating sushi, listening to live jazz, laughing & playing, eating
corn-pops on his balcony, and coloring mandalas in the sun, and the next
part of it with the above described experience.  Only to come home to find
the wind blowing beautifuly through the trees, the wind-chimes softly
tinkling, an expansive view of the City and Bridges glowing in the distance,
a full moon blazing above, and my comfy bed waiting for me.  I am at peace.

I love my life right now.

:)
Love
Shawna

I CAN'T AGREE MORE! THE VIBE SUCKED!!

The music was weak and my patience was growing very thin with the freaking
tramps dancing up on the stage...   I think they have some issues to deal
with. Like their need for attention....  and the fact that 1/2 of the guy
there were gawking didn't help. I dunno, it just seemed really chessy,
over-populated and lame. 

I was dancing up on the stage. I was wearing a white t-shirt and a fishing
hat.... I think I'm going to stick with FeelGood Entertainment. Thing is,
I saw the same people working this gig as the FeelGood raves... Hmmmm???
Makes me wonder.

Carlos was a nice guy though.... a lot of smiles and positive energy. But
we need to lose the tramps who were dying for attention. Isn't it about
the music and the unity??? Lets put an end to the showboating by our
fellow rave attendees.

I'm off to bed.... see you guys at the next event... Stairway to
Headphones. I can't wait, this is going to be the shit.

-Byroni

[ to sfraves list ]

 Recently, in someone's comments about the Planet New Year make-up party,
this was said:
"...and my patience was growing very thin with the freaking
tramps dancing up on the stage...   I think they have some issues to deal
with. Like their need for attention...."

 I didn't go to the make-up party, but I don't think that's important
for what I'm trying to say. I've read the same basic statement, in 
different terminology, in previous posts to SFRaves over the years.
I'll let others deal with the psycho-sociological aspects of the 
word "tramp" and get to the point. '

 Why not let someone at a rave be as pretty/sexy/slutty as they want to
be, AS LONG AS they're not physically forcing themselves upon others?
They want attention - so what? After a few hours of posing, they'll
probably get tired, and maybe another mode of thinking will kick in.

 ( Let's agree right now that physical and other intrusive/aggresive
   actions like rude words or hand gestures signing sexual intercourse
   are not what I'm talking about! Only visual displays that preserve
   the space between the displayer and the "audience" )

 If raves should be a space to feel free, why not as a space to be free
to be pretty, if only in your own mind? I'm applying my experience
from the science fiction fandom sub-culture ; people come to conventions
in all sorts of costumes, and gals who would never show more than
2" of flesh between collarbone and neckline in the "mundane" world
would be in costumes with severe decollete ( not to mention the 
brass-brassiere Amazons ). 

 To these fan gals, the convention was a "safe" place of fellow
fans and people they knew like a second family, maybe better than
their own family. I get the same feeling from raves. 

 If it's felt that "displayers" are distracting, well, that something
each person has to handle. If it's felt that the exhibitionists are
giving raves a "bad image" to first-timers , that will be corrected
by experience. And if they're the type to say "Oh, those raves are
horrible because they have those freaking tramps dancing up on
the stage!", well, maybe they're a bit too uptight for raving!

Hi everyone, here's my review for CoolWorld's PNY. Overall, I give this
party
1/2 star point. It was definitely a party I would have rather missed...

I got to the HomeBase location at around 11:00pm after being in line for 2
hours,
I finally get to go in at 1am. Payed my $6, gave my can O' food, and went
in to 
partee :) I have seriously NEVER seen that many HomeyG's in one place
before.
It was scary :( Anyhow,

My friends and I decide to go in and check out the place (you know, check
out the rooms and stuff) so we go into the jungle room and see everyone
standing there.
It was odd. No one dancing.. I left, and went outside to meet all my other
frends...

Lara, Rhona, Ace, Fernando, Ryan, Eric, Startiana, Natasha, etc etc etc etc
etc...
(I didn't forget you April! ;o)) They all seemed to be having fun (I wonder
why? ;O))
but not as much as they could have :( the vibe was amazingly evil, and it
was
extremely cold and dark outside. But we kept our vibe pretty friendly, so
people
came up to us and stuff.

At around 3am or so, we decide that is time to bring GoodVibes to the
party,
so we begin to be happy and share with everyone :) for example,

Eric and Rhona gave their Teddy Bear to this girl that was having a good
time
after Ryan gave her a bracelet after all her stuff had been stolen and
stuff.
She was EXTRA happy, I gave her a hug and we all just started to make her
trip the most wonderful! :) 

There was this couple sitting down in the ground freezing their ass off, so
I 
let them use my coat and my elephant so they could warm up (while I was
cold myself, but they seemed to be needeing it more :o)) that made me
happy,
and it made them happy :o)

Giving out blow-pops to people and candy, and hugs and kisses. Dancing, and
being happy despite of the evil vibes surrounding our group :(.

Then around 5, I start getting REAALLLLLYYYYY tired. So I get my friends
and
decide that is time to go home....

It was definitely a party worth missing though...I was afraid of dancing,
or going inside. There was someone who went into cardiac arrest [?] and
someone got stabbed in the back, and there were a couple of fights...

Overall this party gets 1/2 star point. :o)
Plur to alls
Pab

 RIGHT ON LARRY! Personally I think it is a lot of fun for folks to get 
loose at a party. If the worst part of the make up party was people 
dancing I'm sorry I didn't go.  =)

Hey people :)

It's been a really long time since I've reviewed anything, but last
night's Madness really gave me the urge to dust off the old keyboard and
type a few words.

I had a similar experience to Shawna's, when it comes to the crowd, & the
vibe.  A lot of the people I met raving when I first moved to San
Francisco were there - including some real surprises like John Draper,
Leslie (still on the list?), and a bunch of the Harmony crewmembers.  Many
of the people who were active on the list when I got here, and have now
faded into lurking (much like myself) were there, and it was very good to
see them.

But, as usual, I did a lot more dancing than socializing...  The music was
really fantastic.  The basement was where the action was, for me, despite
the heat and a couple of problems with the sound system (as usual, the
Gateway crew was very quick to respond, good stuff :)  Minor Minor spun a
fantastic set, hard and minimal, had everyone moving & smiling.  I think
that the real star of the night, though, was T-1000 from Detroit.  I'm
really glad that he'll be at Mad on monday, because the heat down there
prevented me from really thoroughly enjoying dancing to his set, despite
*incredible* music.

What also really blew me away was the lighting.  I have been disappointed
by the last few parties I've gone to, in this respect.  But the lighting
at Madness was exactly what I like - visual chaos, lots of lights, and no
central focus thereof - there were a few strobes, some flashing spinning
things, some pin spots, a disco ball, some christmas lights.  There was
enough light everywhere that I didn't smash into people, but not so much
that I was blinded - and everywhere I looked, my eyes were stimulated and
entertained.  I don't think I've seen visual mayhem pulled off so well
since the Beautiful People parties prior to the Harmony 3yr.

It's good to know that I am still capable of enjoying raving.  I have had
not-so-great-sometimes-bordering-on-bad times at the last bunch of parties
I've been to, and I must admit to having feared that I had outgrown
raving.  Not so, and am I ever glad to know it :)

Feeling more like a raver than I have in a long time, I say bye bye and
see you next time (Mad w/T-1000!)

Thoughs tramps got my attention..
   If Luciana were to have made it to this party.. She probably would of
wanted to dance on stage. But I don't think she would of apreciated you
calling her a tramp.. Anyways..
  Great party.. I couldn't agree with you more about; the music in the main
room. It was pretty week.. But the jungle kept on going, and going,
non-stop. Kind of like that mysterious bunny rabbit..

I'm sitting here kicking the shit out of myself (I'm double jointed in the 
knees) because I went to PNY last night instead of Madness. You see, for the 
past several months, I've been trying to "convert" several of my friends into 
ravers, which has been VERY difficult, to say the lease.  Anyway, last night I 
got 8 count 'em 8 of them to go with me to PNY.  I normally avoid massive, but 
I figured it was possibly a good idea, based on everyone's great experience 
with the Love Affair party. 

So we get there, around 11, wait for an hour in the line, then get in and split 
up into groups.  Went into the Jungle room, where (as posted) very few ppl were 
dancing. I did like the laser, but the music was to put it nicely, 
"uninspiring".  So we went into the other (techno) room, which was packed, and 
it seemed EVERYONE needed to be somewhere else-- they were just walking around. 
It was impossible to dance, as no matter where we were, there were constant 
people walking through and bumping into us. 

My group was standing there, very bored, and giving me annoyed looks that I 
dragged them to this. Six of them left at two, and I stayed with one until 
four, and just tried to dance away the evil energy, but it was impossible due 
to the aforementioned walkers. I think there must have been shuttle buses 
running from Bay Area correctional high schools to and from the party. 

All the while, it sounds like this kick-ass Madness party was going on...  
aren't there ANY SFravers who work for the Psychic Friends Network, who can 
predict this shit for me? Damn damn damn, it will be months before I'll be able 
to get them to come again. It's time to recruit from the inside, rather than 
proseletyzing to existing cliques. Who wants to be my raver buddy?  :)  You 
people have fun today, ya hear? 

Damned, 
Nathan

Oh yeah, same thing at Madness of course, knife fights, some guy threatening
some other guy for looking at his woman wrong, cocaine everywhere, $5 water,
etc.  And I originally just couldn't decide which party to go to.  Hmm:
Cool World or Madness, Coolworld or Madness...  Decisions, decisions!  After
flipping a coin, finally decided on Madness.

I must confess to being happy that at least *somebody* had fun at the Cool

parties have you been to?

Subject: Yet another Madness review...
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Thanx so very much goes out to one of F-8's customers who ran over to
Ameba to pick up a tix to Madness for me.    As usuall,   my bus connections
were totally phucked.    Just as I get to the bus stop,   I see the bus pull
away (Arghhh!  - yet another hour wait,  clearly I'll miss getting a ticket
now),  but I call ahead and some kind generous person was willing to go
to Ameba to pick up a tix,  and I make it to F-8 just at 8 pm when Mystr-E
was about to close.

I hung out on the haight,  waiting for the info to update,  hoping
upon hope that the location would be reachable via public transpo,   so
I sip some "programming fluid" waiting for the update.

I call shortly after 10 pm,  and learn "Oh Joy!!"  a SOMA location,  so
I head to SOMA,   with full intention of dancing my Waa Waa off BIG TIME,
and that,  my friends was just exactly what I did.

Not many people recognized me or came up to say Hi,   but that's OK,   as
my first rave in SF as "JohnnyD" and not "crunchman",   it was just purrrfict

I arrive to be greeted with a really mellow chill zone,  and proceeded to
look around this new venue (for me),  but I later learned it was used a number
of times before.

I eventually wind up in the basement as Alex was on the turntables developing
his set,   and looked around and saw Brian....    Hi Brian...

There were a few people (non-netters) who didn't know that Crunchman was
dead and I set them straight...

I headed back up to the chill zone for my pre-dance stretching exercises
I hold as being so important,   and make it down to start a long night of
dancing.

I met some dudz on the bus that were surprised that I was going to madness.
Obviously someone who doesn't know me,    but he seemed surprised I was going
to the rave.....

Anyway,   Alex didn't let me down,  as usual was a good bit of great techno
choons,   churning out those speakers.....    I wasted no time getting into
the groove....

Already,  it was getting hot in there,   but I didn't care,  and started
shedding my outer clothes,   and after that,  didn't care how hot it was,
but eventually had to talk to Monte and ask that he set up another fan,
which he did....  Thanx Monty....

Minor-Minor ripped it up BIG time,   going extra hard and building up the
energy level in preparation for T-1000 from Detroit...

Holy shit...  That dude was SICK....   he had me bouncing all over the place,
between the walls and ceiling,   but by that time,   the water was dripping
all over the turn tables,   and T-1000 eventually had to move them slightly
to keep them dry....    Afterwards,   there were a few glitches,   but
he recovered brilliantly,  and kept up the energy.

I don't recall who went on after that,    but while waiting for him to develop
his set,   I chilled and met and talked to Marco and a few old friends from
the list.

All in all,  the party was PHAT and a total bargain for just $5 and restored
my faith in the amazing SF Rave scene....   Totally nothing like it anywhere
else....

I'm honored to have been able to spend yet another time with you fine folks
before I fly down to PB on Tuesday...    I'll be BACK!!!

Oh yea,   while waiting for my favorite breakfast place to open up,   I decided
to check out the Endup....   We all end up at the Endup....    :-)    I didn't
stay long,  but got in another hour's dancing...   :-)

Thanx folks....

JohnnyD

Well, Shawna and David said *everything* I wanted to say (damn you
guys! ;), but I wanted to give a big, resounding "me too!" since I
haven't posted a review in so long. That was honestly the best party
I've been to in so long. 

It seemed like I knew everyone there... The whole old school crowd was
there: many people from the old Beautiful People parties, lots of
SFRavers (including long lost Shawna!), and just people that I haven't
raved with in so long. I was also so happy to see a good amount of my
favorite Cyborganic friends there... I was especially pleased to see
Forrest dancing his ass off with a sick grin during T-1000's set. >:)

Unfortunately (maybe it's been the winter), I've been getting old and
tired... So I only lasted until about 4am before I had to call it a
night. But I'll be back once the weather gets warmer and my life gets
less stressful...

Anyway, I felt like I was not so much at a "rave"(tm), but at a really
cool, under control party with a whole bunch of friends listening to
great music, at a place I'm at more often than my own apartment (I'm
at 654 way too much these days).

Mad crew, as always you guys kick ass, and I will see you tommorrow to
get my ass kicked (again) by T-1000!

I was the one with big pants and glow sticks. Did you see me??
huh, huh?

:)

SO now I'm *really* kicking myself for not coming down for Madness. 
Beautiful weather in Portland this weekend but it's been crummy otherwise.
Friday night I took my amp and monitors out to a bar in Vancouver, Wash.
where my friend Jeremy was playing.  Even though he was playing a good
set, the promoter kicked him off the decks after 45 minutes "because the
kids aren't dancing" (well, the kids weren't dancing much previously when
the DJ was playing shite "progressive" house and trance).  Then, last
night, back at my office where I was doing a practice set, the guy who
is illegally living down the hall from my office (because he is a waiter
in the restaurant downstairs which owns the building) shut me down by
plugging in his heater at 1:30 am which tripped the circuit breaker --
not that this hasnt happened before, the last time Thursday afternoon.

So yes, I'm whining -- I heard that AO wouldn't be playing at Madness and
I can't make it down for Mad Monday night, so, phooey!

Glad everyone had a great time, though.

        I think that part of the reason Christianity is not incorporated
into raves is that as an organized religion it has a history of repression
and exclusion.  Repression of many of the more villiage centered tribal
religions (by wiping them out or replacing pagan ceremonies with Christian
ones), witch burning (which is about repression of womens knowledge).
Exclusion: there is a tendency for christianity to mark a line believe in
christ and those who don't.  a line whihc historically has been used to say
basically who is thought of as human and who are not. IN addition, much of
christianity is based on having the priest as the intermediary between the
lay person and God. I know that for many of the protestant religions this
does not stricly hold, but there still seems to be something of that
attitude among many of the people.
        The eastern religions (mysticism, really- and this may really be
the key point) are a bit more about self-discovery.  In addition, they tend
to be a bit more about the "here and now" rather than focusing on the
afterlife.  Thus eastern mysticism is genrrally a process of enlightenment
and it deals with many thinhgs which are not generally discussed in our
culture.  Mainly, I am thinking of the conception of our bodies and souls
as energy. They also highlight the "oneness" and connectedness of us all,
which makes sense when thinking about dancing and the group collective
energy that flows at the rave and beyound.
        Raves are these little mini-tribal experiences and they have that
mixture of life and mysticism rolled up in the event.  So the eastern
religions (and tribal religions) with the emphasis on sprituality as an
aspect of living day to day life speak a bit more directly to what a rave
is all about.  Whereas with Christianity, where much of the spiritual
experience  is reserved for the afterlife, it misses speaking to some of
the magic of the rave.  (O.K. this previous pasage is quite vague and
sloppy- so sorry if you don't know what I am talking about).  Finally one
last point reguarding *magic*: Christianity has tended to view much of this
as being somewhat siinster and from the devil, thus a bit suspect.  While,
the eastern (and tribal) religions/mysticisms tend to connect it to our
very life force.  Talking about Chakras, transcendentalism, Chi and the
like.  More of a natural mystery to be explored - the way we are- instead
of good or bad.  You know?
        I really believe that Christ was a pretty amazing
person/diety/budda.  What he supposedly had to say is very powerful and
really fits right in with the eastern religions/mysticism.  Especially his
message of love-- intense stuff when you really think about it.  Fits in
with PLUR as well.  But people read Christs words with many different
interpretations-- look to the  relatively new school of revisionist
theology, who ask WHAT did Christ REALLY say to the stereotyped Southern
Baptist who tend to follow a more literal take on the Bible.  But the
organized religion of Christianity has a pretty poor track record over
history of truly promoting this message of universal love.  So many of the
symbols of the church are apt to be very loaded symbols.

Peace, Understanding, and
Love,
Dennis

Yes indeed, sorry if I implied otherwise.  But the milieu of SJDRS
certainly demonstrates an openness towards Western/Judaeo-Christian
spirituality that parallels the attitude towards other traditions that
seems to be more common in those parts of raving culture that make some
overt acknowledgement of the spiritual elements of the experience.

WOW
that was my first massive experience.
I haven't read any of the other reviews, because i didn't want their feeling
to influence mine.
It was definitely different.
I felt a negative vibe the whole night, except for when I was outside with
all of my friends.  and i met so many of you!!!!! Hello to all.  I can't
remember your names without the faces, but you are all in my heart (well, i
do remember most of your names, but i don't want to leave anyone out.)
I was so happy when i saw lara because I drove up by myself, hoping to see
her there.  I wandered around Home Base for about an hour before I found her
though.  She took me outside to where everyone was hanging out. I had the
best time outside talking to all of you people... that is one reason I love
being sober... I remember who you are better... I remeber your names... and
your faces too :).
Inside, the vibe was so bad... People were so rude, they would run into you
at full force and not even turn to say sorry.  The worst part of the night,
though, was wwhen I was walking into the deep house room.  I was pushed out
to the side and I saw like 5 thug looking guys kicking something or someone
on the ground.  Noone did anything (fear is not always trivial I learned that
night) to help. the bad guys just dispersed into the crowd and got off free
of charge.  OUCH!!! That hurt.  I've been taught that the rave culture was
about love and friendship... PLUR...  But noone could help him because one
person is helpless, We need to join together stave this off.  
Therre were also so few 'ravers' there (I call ravers those who go to parties
to dance, make friends, meet friends, join together in a state of Peace Love
Unity and Respect.  Those that go to parties to keep the vibe up and promote
good karma... help out others in times of need... smiles!!!!!!:}) I'm used to
all 'ravers' all the time.  Where you can stop anyone and say, "why hello
there, how are you today?" and everyone is nice to you, for the most part.
 I'm spoiled. 
On a happier note, though... the drum and bass room was so phat!!!!!  best
vibes inside any of the rooms.  My favorite part of it was standing by the
speakers and feeling the little hairs sticking up from between my braids
vibrate.  HEE HEE HEE.  It was pretty cool.  
To all of you that I met... It was wonderful meeting  you!!!!! I hope to see
you at a party sometime in the near future.  To all of my old friends,  I
love you guys too!!!!!
A quick question... Why were their girls booty shakin'... why were there
girls gyrating on top of speakers getting egged on by calls of "hoochie mama"
(no seriusly, it happened!!) I mean, sure this girl had a kick ass body, but
respect yourself, please.
Maybe that's just a massive.  A lot of my friends said that not all massives
are this phony and negative, that i should try it again.  I don't know,
maybe, but if another one is as bad as this, you can bet i'm staying
underground for the rest of my life!!!!!
Much love
April :)

I was in a really good mood, and ended up running into a few old friends.
 The atmosphere in general was kinda.... weird.  But that's ok, I wasn't
really paying that much attention to it... Too much fun dancin and sittin
against the speakers. hee hee!

It sucked that they closed off the chill room hella early.  That and the fact
that the house lights kept getting turned on every so often.  And the
security guards with megaphones... And that ending hallway to nowhere... Oh,
and the fights... THAT was.... interesting (first rave something that big has
ever happened at for me).  Oh and that icky icky line/crowded raver
pasture... That sucked! Good thing that I'm not claustrophobic! My friend Val
said that there was a naked person there too... ??? ok.... To each his or her
own, I guess.

But hey, it was only $6, and I got to take my little brother to his first
rave. Through all the "little" annoyances, and that TERRIBLE weather, I still
somehow managed to have a really good time.  Looking forward to seeing
everyone at STAIRWAY TO HEADPHONES!!!

Rave on! 
Just another little raver girlie....

Well, the worst part of the party were the huge number of gangsters who
attended and someone got stabbed in the back. =[

Heyas everyone!  I just subscribed to this mailing list so let me
introduce myself:

I am a 17-year-old freshman at Sierra College (Rocklin) and I live in
Roseville.  I have never been to a rave but I *love* the City and am
transferring to SF State Uni. in Fall of 1998.  I am a manager at
Starbucks Coffee here in town and I am a big Alanis Morissette, Spice
Girls and U2 fan (going to the Oakland, San Diego and Seattle POPmart
'97 shows).  I live for the summer and ocean (both are very spiritual
for me) and am looking forward to experiencing my first City rave.  Nice
to meet you all! ;)

Cheers,


John-Eric ;)

IMHO

Well, there it is 11:30 and I'm at Kama Loca realizing I have no idea where
Maddness is but I digress. There were only about sixty people there and I
think I'm being kind of generous with that number. The bar area had Felix
spinning who was great. I never heard him before, but his sound just kicked.
The main room had Gavin who was better at Spundae. Sadly, I left about 1:30
since during the time very few people arrived and even fewer were dancing. It
just felt weird. 

So what do I do? I go to PNY since I just needed to dance. I thank the team
for putting on the party making up for the diaster. That is a touch of class.
Luckily, I just went there to dance since I knew I wouldn't know were to find
this community. The music was good in the main room, but it seemed that
everyone was going somewhere and few were just stopping to dance. Not happy
campers. So I just end up smiling and saying hello to people hoping to spread
some joy. There was one angel of the evening I would like to thank. She was
handing out ice and that was a cool relief from the heat. The rest is
articulated by others on this list.

peace and joy,
Carl

Very well put..
 Although I was also nudged around alittle harder than nesesary. I still
have to say.. I had a blast.... And honestly.. I would much rather be
pushed around, than to have some one just park there self right infront of
me, not dancing. I hate when that happens.
 But about these tramps, hoochie mamas nStuff onstage.. They were just
dancing, they way they like to dance. Each and everyone of them I saw up
there, looked like they had a good head on there shoulders. You ever think,
they might just be up there, to get away from the,,, booty grabbers or
something?
  I just don't think there is nothing wrong with being a show girl, I
guess.
  Most of em I know, have alot of respect for them selves. But they work
WAY to late to goto any ravEs..

Yanno?

Greetings,

Well not to be a real jerk, but I am going to be anywayz!  But what the
hell were you expecting out of a GETTO CHILDREN party.  (notice that
cool world is not in caps because it is not worth the energy.) 

This was a short comment, but believe me I could go off on this subject
for dayz!!

Well...seeing how I was considering going to this party for lack of any
other real partys I had heard about, I am REALLY glad I didn't!!! I've
never been to a cool world party because I try to avoid massives, but I
was thinking for six bucks, why not!?!? I was kinda mad that my ride
fell through, but from reading many reviews about the party, I called my
friend and told him I was glad he flaked on me. (he was a bit confused).
Anyways, I have two newbie ravers who really really want to go to a
rave, and so I was wondering, what looks good for this coming up
weekend?  Um, I've already said no to Space Childern, so, um, anything
else?  Well, thanks in advance!

Matt the SmUrFy

P.S.  Anyone out there in Sfraves land have a picture of a smurf that I
can use for after my messages? I've been looking for one for quite a
while and I can't computer draw at all, so, just wondering! :) Once
again, thanks in advance! :)

I do know what you are fucking talking about. I have been raving for
nine years, But un-cool world is a total sellout now. A prime example of
a cool semi underground gone totally comercial. =


Comercial =3D sellout, trader, gathering of the mis-guided

A getto child circus of negative vibes bouncing everywhere.And in my
opinion any attender of un-cool world is a sellout to the whole rave
community. =


Sellout =3D Sooooo fake, Has not even the slightest clue, Wish they      =
		=

	      could dance, Oh momy and dady bought it for me

Please someone, help these mis-guided souls to see the light at the end
of the tunnel (and no I don't mean the galactic tunnel where you think
your going to have a good time but the russian's will be ripping   =

you off. Oh ya gota love that VIBE)

This is Victoria's insert (hellosmile@juno.com) (She Is On Crack And
SPcl-K_)

First of all He's lieing about the crack and K it was a joke. I feel
that un-cool world is a sorry excuse for a rave. Second of all it should
be called a RAGE because you change the V in RAVE to a "G".
If you don't get what I'm saying then your on crack and K. thank you and
bye bye, have fun at all the masssives you massive freak.
 =

And Here is Paul's (Plur@juno.com insert) (Twinkle Dork)

I'm Gay( JK No and no, not John F. Kennedy ). I thought coolworld was a
movie. And that movie sucked. just like I do to other guys.

And Back to Kermit,

To jump to another subject since I am on the negative side of things.
You people that bashed April (one of the sweetiest souls I have ever
rubbed into) All I can say is have fun at the next cool world.

Hi everyone. I'm a HUGE Alternative Rock fan. I don't know what the hell I'm
doing on a rave list. Anyway I just want to know if there are any other
events that I can go to where I can enjoy Alt. music. 

The good concerts don't come around often enough. 

Thank you for listening...

Ken

Thanks to all my cool friends that did come to Kewl-Aid at my house last
week on Tuesday. And if you couldn't get through on the phone for
directions. Sorry, these two preppy bitches were on the phone all night.
But we'll forgive them for they know not what they do.

The cops never showed up and my dad comes back tommorrow and the house
is cleaned up, lets see if he notices that there was a mini-rave/House
Party at our home.

Things that broke:
     Chia-Pet

Things that were taken:
     Milk (everyone got cereal with milk in the morning except for me)

Thank god that this time no doors were beaten down.

Love.Luck.Lollipops,

that guy was the best...

we used to pile in his pad after every Basics/Gathering...yanno, there 
was once a time when massives were cool and had good energy, yanno.  
Yanno?  

Dave Sarlin had a neato house in Berkeley...we trippers would climb up 
the backyard, over the fence, and walahh! ( i know that's not the right 
spelling, who cares?  shoot me. )  

then we were in another world.  the rose garden at tilden regional park.  

he used to let us crash there all day, sometimes we'd all meet there 
before the full moon.  

he was funny to talk to.  used to kind of mumble his sentences and finish 
with a mumble and a laugh.  funny cause he had this unique way of 
projecting his intent so we never needed to know what he was saying, but 
it was still kinda oddly funny.  

ill never forget the time i went to the thai bbq with him.  at this 
buddist temple.  perfect type of food for after a rave.  

although there are lots of cool people in the SFR community...Dave Sarlin 
was one of the most giving intellectual people I ever knew.  For those of 
you that don't know who the hell this guy is, he died last year.  He will be 
surely missed.  But it's cool, though, every once in a while I call for 
his spirit, and he shows up.  I can't see him, but I can definitely feel 
him.  actually its more like seefeel.  oh. he's here right now.  gotta 
go!  ;]  

love deep  [or is it deep love?]

I love raves, dig house and techno to death...but sometimes my friends like to 
groove to Hip Hop and rap. 

Can't seem to find any raves with that kind of music or for that matter any 
clubs that play hip hop.

any ideas or leads.

Well, I only payed 5 dollars for madness and I thought that party absolutly

Once again proving the law of Rave Admissions:

The most inexpensive parties are the funnest.

I've been hearing about Q-Bert recently and I want to check him out
somewheres.  I don't know a whole lot about him, but I've heard a couple of
records that he's done  work on, and I've heard that he tears it up live.
I've also heard that he's from the Bay Area.   

What are the parties like that he spins at?   Any info would be appreciated.

Warm Regards,

I just came back from Mass, which was thrown in San Luis Obisbo.

I had one of the bombest weekends I've had in a long while.

I suggest that everyone try to get down to a party in SLO, Santa Barbara,
or in one of the smaller towns on the coast sometime soon. The party had
300+ people in two rooms. Everything at the party reminded me of the
parties I used to go to before the big bucks started being pored into the
scene, when the vibe was the thing that drew you to the party.

The beats were just right. Getting away from all of the big name DJs in SF
and hearing some new sounds made me feel like it was my first rave all over
again. I never realized how bored I was getting with regards to the sounds
in SF where many DJs really sound the same. (needless to say, I was *not*
extremely disappointed to miss Cool World). I went down there with DJs MODA
and Jazz-E who were obviously feeling the killer vibes too, who both played
excellent sets. Mike (I don't remember his DJ name) also dropped some
jungle which had me going. Needless to say, I haven't danced that hard for
years.

Sunday afternoon, Mass threw a beach party. The turnout wasn't huge, but
the smiles and energy were there. The friendliness that used to be an
integral part of the SF scene was very much alive and well in SLO.

Props to Austin, Mike, and the whole Mass crew.

I recommend that everyone try to get down there sometime soon.

I think I speak on behalf of the rest of the MAD guys when I says 'thank you'
to everyone that came out and supported the MADNESS event. Special thanks
must go out to The CLOUD FACTORY crew for the assist on lights, etc., GATEWAY
for hooking the sound, C-Labs & my tried and true blue boy from way way back,
TOMAS for the Downtempo musical assist. And I can't forget the Man of the
Hour, Alan Oldham aka DJ T-1000, for coming down and playing for an hour or
so.  For those that were there, you felt it. for those that missed it, you
can catch him tonight for the last time at MAD.  Thanks again!!

Wait a minute! wait a minute! Kermit PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE explain just what
the hell you mean here! Are you really saying what I think youre saying? I
think this thread has been dubious enough with all the obvious sexist crap
that has been thrown about and now we're going back to this
cultural/ethnicity insensitivity stuff again. So before I go nuts, and more
importantly, before the likes of John S. Lee have to break you off something
proper, I think a further clarification of your comments is necessary.

Me too :)   Even when that fight happened and there was this huge open
circle all of a sudden with noone dancing, there I was in the middle all of
a sudden - not a care in the world.  (you might have recognized me -
enormously tall and part of the time I had my friend michael's green
glowsticks)
Best thing about the party: a massive for $6
Worst: the ratio of ganster-types and people who just walked and walked
Anyone that uses homebase should OPEN THE THIRD ROOM! :)
 (the big room in the back is as big as those two front rooms combined,
isn't it?)
peace, Max

Qbert is a three-time world-champion freestyle DJ - a member of the Rock
Steady Crew and Zulu Nation.  On March 15 the Southern Exposure Gallery at
SFSU is presenting "DJ Qbert's Turntable Trickery Workshop" as part of this
gallery's vital Artists in Education program (set up to counter the lack of
art education for youth in public schools).  I'm not sure of price (free, I
think, but they need DONATIONS) or time.  Call the gallery for more info.

Just wanted to write to thank everyone who made Madness such
a great event. Every person who came contributed to the
warmth and the friendliness of the night, and it is because
of you that the party was what it was. Thanks especially to
the volunteers who helped us create the mood, worked the
door, helped to set up and helped to clean up. You guys are
the best!!

God, no kidding.  I've never liked cruel world, and I never thought I 
would see the day that I would go.  But I hang my head in embarassment as 
I confess: I went. I found out about Madness too late, as I promised my 
new boyfriend that I would go with him to cw. He hasn't been in the scene 
very long and doesn't know about the GOOD parties yet.  I am looking 
forward to showing him! ;) I went with him and he paid my way.  I ain't 
even gonna pay *$6* for a cw event.

It was as bad as the previous posts have indicated.  I wasn't saying 
anything, but I was giving my SO that look of "I told you so". The music 
was uninspiring, to say the least, as mentioned there were more people 
walking around than dancing, someone sprayed PEPPER spray into the air in 
the main room and I kept coughing, it was just WAAAAY too crowded - it 
took forever to get anywhere.  Mark was my only breath of fresh air: he 
brought a backpack FULL of different friut and candy to give away. What a 
sweetheart! ;)  

By 2:30 I could not take it anymore.  I had witnessed the 3rd fight of 
the evening and the entire atmosphere was just plain evil. I said to 
Mark, "I'm leaving and I am leaving NOW."  He did not object.  His words 
were: "That was not a rave or a party.  That was a social catastrophe!"  
Very well put.  He's going to let me pick the parties for awhile now. :):)   

I hope I have not lost any respect from my friends on this list for going 
to that....that.... that monstrosity.  My heart was at Madness. Really-it 
was!

love,
Amy

Then it's a good thing that Madness was only $5, rather than the more common
$10-$12, cuz then all of a sudden Coolworld woulda been more fun!  ;)

Oh yeah, one other question.  Was the money that people paid for the
original coolworld (vs make up party) refunded to them?  I sure hope so, cuz
if not that would make their final ticket prices $41!

Hey everyone,
	Firstly, "Club" Cool World was not a rave, it was a big club. The Thug
factor was one as I have never seen. I almost got punched by accident on
my way to the water counter. There was "tagging everywhere". I just felt
really uncomfortable (unlike the Love Affair massive).As for the girls
dancing on top of the speakers, I kinda licked...woops...I mean liked
it, but I felt one lady was being a bit provacative (sp?) when she
lifted her dress to show her undies and doing the freaky-freaky
dance. Then Guys started yelling "Take it off". I was just waiting for
someone to get violated because of this. 
	Secondly, The people I met from Sfraves, and their friends made
up for all the negativity. Lara,you are the bomb: thanks for making me
feel so accepted. Orson,you are the bomb: thanks for the laminates,they
are very cool. Anthony E, you are the bomb: how did you like the tape?
Pablo: even though I didn't get to really speak with you, you're still
the bomb. April, you are the bomb: welcome to the list and I still
love your Dalmation (sp?) Ace, you are the bomb: Thanks for whatching
out for everyone. Eric, Fernando, Christina, Arron, Maggie and anyone
else I may have missed: You all are the bomb!! 
	Lastly, I think I will be attending Omnisonic on Friday and
Stairway to Headphones on Sat. If any of you are going let me know so we
may meet. I should have more mixtapes and other stuff to give out.
				Peace

Hey Dan,

Friday nights at DV8 in San Francisco is a hip hop/rap club...it's name 
escapes me, but I know a few people who go there regularly and seem to like 
it.  It is moving however, soon I think - but I don't know where.  Also, 
maybe Saturday nights at the Soundfactory I think...not sure.  There are 
rave type events that are dedicated to the rap/hip hop sound, but I honestly 
don't know where you could get hold of that type of information other than 
keep asking around...

Yeah I know about those places. Thanks for the info anyway. 

I would go to those places more often but the lines are soooo long. Also all 
the women think you are trying to pick up on them, the places are populated by 
thugs with bad attitudes and the cover charges are ridiculous.

I was really hoping to find a cool club or rave with a friendly and fun loving 
attitude with some killer dj's spinning the beat.  I may have to throw my own 
party(hmmm.)

-dan



Good Luck,

Smiles,

Scott =)

I love raves, dig house and techno to death...but sometimes my friends like
to
groove to Hip Hop and rap.

Can't seem to find any raves with that kind of music or for that matter any
clubs that play hip hop.

any ideas or leads.

So who all's going to Mad tonight for T-1000?  I'll be there--tall,

Hi all
I'm curious to know--are there any ravers who got tix this weekend for the
U2 show in Oakland?  
(I justify this post's rave-relatedness based on Bono's quote, "we're
going to see what happens when you take a rave to a supermarket, and then
put that supermarket inside a stadium and invite 80,000 of your mates."
Scottish DJ Howie B will be performing with the band as well...

peace
Timothy

Last time I had a house party at my house...  I thought I got rid of all
the evidence but. They found a beer bottle in the shower..
So don't forget to check the shower!  And the closets to!

Alll Right!!! Big Hugs and Thank Yous to everyone who came out to my very
first house party. It was great!! A few Christmas lights and Dave Q's disco
ball really made the living room. Along with Adam M. who supplied the
turntables and was my "Obi-Won" for Zen and the art of house parties. Big
thanks also to Deepfog, Andy W., and everyone else who spun! The dining
room was set-up as a great little chill area and it was such a great night
outside on the back deck!! And I had no idea that my house would close-in
the music so well. 

This was such a "no problems" party that I think it's definitely the
beginning of a trend... ;-)

 If you were the enormously tall person /w the red shirt on. I remember
you.
 And that big azz back room...  That room is HUGE! it is almost the same
size as the Sankofa/Eon -to- Eon building (999 98th Ave, Oakland)....  I
hope I get to see it agian..

 Rumor has it that; the Oakland police are not going to let promoters use
the facility after the next time, if there are any more conflicts. (O.D.'s,
fights, ect.)

 So..  to all the promoters..  Make sure there is a big fat ass sign
infront next time, stating this fact. If it is a fact ofcourse. And
ofcourse.... The sign could just back fire! Isn't life grand?  =]

Gotta go.. LATE agian!

hello all-

here's a (GASP!!!) rave related review from matt.

maddness was everything i look for in a rave.  not too big, great music, good variety of music in both dance floors, good people, and a wonderful vibe from all my friends that i haven't seen in quite a while!

love to you all-

matt

Hi everybody. I was wondering how others feel about Rampants
response to a friend's email. He told Rampant that the quality
of one of their pressings wasn't too great... Was their response
out of line? Or was my friend asking for trouble when he 
expressed his opinion?

Please respond privately if you care to. I'd like to hear
people's opinions...

The messages from both parties are copied below...

I'm sorry you don't like Brownie's Breakdown mix. For us to go thru the 
whole manufacturing process again and re-master this mix would cost 
about $2000. As yours is the only complaint we have received out of the 
1500 pressed and sold, it doesn't seem likely that we will be doing 
this. 
However, one technique used by some DJ's is to adjust the level of the 
bass frequencies on the mixer's eq.If this does't help why don't you try 
playing the other THREE mixes that you like so much and stop fucking 
moaning! 3 out of 4 isn't bad and is better than most record companies 
provide.

Your letter will be added to "Rampant's Cheekiest Letters Collection" 
and so far it ranks #1.

DAMB!
To all you who have said the CW makeup party suxd:

___it was a 6 dollar party___

* 6 dollar crowd (1000s of em)
* 6 dollar music (2 crappy, low energy rooms, some chill thingy)
* 6 dollar lighting (my laser pointer actually helped them out)
* 6 dollar water! (i think, ha)
* 6 dollar drugs (atleast i heard that, since there were over 4000 dealers)

PEOPLE...
	please dont judge massives by this party, it was the bottom of 
the bucket, and we all know this. the difference between this party and 
FGE's one a week ago at the SAME space is stagering.
	we came to this party with this in mind, **BUT**

	we still were able to do our -=GLOWSTUFF=- thing, despite all the 
hard looks in line & inside, we still were able to dance and smile in the 
company of other RAVERS, it was all about the mindset! i dont think ill  see 
all you at the head phones party, Mhg is getting her wisdom teeth out and 
needs me :)  much PLUR!

can we please stop making generalizations about prices of parties?

i've been to some GREAT $20 parties, and some @#$%^& ones.

i've been to some AMAZING $5 parties too. and some not-so-good ones.

point #1: you can't judge a party by its cover.

point #2: "it was a 6 dollar party" is not an excuse for anything.


love,

brian

Agreed, but I believe there is validity in suggesting an inverse
relationship between price and party quality (this has been my
experience).

	have a nice day.

well...i just have one thing to say.  it seems as this guy from rampant 
records has a strong need to be RIGHT...so I'll take that into 
consideration...I'll let him be right.  yanno?  i don't need to be 
right.  step out of the way and let the guy from Rampant be important.  

But I'll take my $10 somewhere else.  

thanx for the info matt.  btw, good music yesterday.  =]

Well, it's really hard to say without having heard your friend's
original message to Rampant. You should probably post that before you
ask other people to judge the situation, for clarity's sake.

really?  i grew up on Basics/Gathering parties a few years ago, and it 
was like a big family.  and they were 15 or 20 dollars.  but now things 
have changed.  the big raves haven't been as good.  now we need some of 
these other well-respected guyz to step up.  

Cloud Factory?
Harmony?
Friends and Family?
Pengo?  (jk blake!)  

how about a 'joint' venture?  can ivan 420 handle that?

I've been reading people's comments about the PNY party this weekend, the 
comments about the "booty girls" in particular, and quite frankly I'm 
disturbed...

Here's the thing - There is something that separates raving and ravers from 
the social masses.  What we all share is the ultimate freedom to be yourself 
no matter what that may be.  Our house is 100% culturally diverse.   Few 
other groupings of people can make such a claim, but here in our little rave 
world, we can say that, and mean it.  What this means is, that we will 
accept anyone for whatever their ideals as part of the greater whole.

Sometimes these people are just like us, glitter and lollipops, great big 
smiles and blinky lights, these people are the easiest of course to accept 
and make a connection with, and become our instant best friends.  Sometimes 
though, "just like us" means something entirely different, because "just 
like us" is taken from a different perspective than one you observe.  This 
does not make this other perspective wrong, it merely makes it different. 
 Variety is the spice of life, it opens our minds to new and wonderful 
possibilities.  Without people and experiences different than the ones we 
each currently know of, how will be able to learn or grow?  

It's possible that these people dancing on the stage, wiggling their behinds 
at everyone, look a bit too different for some to accept.  But they, with 
all of their preconceptions, seemed to be having a great time accepting all 
of us, so much in fact that they were able to dance however they wished. 
 Why can't we then in turn appreciate what these girls have to offer the 
world spiritually?

We all have prejudices, we all use stereotypes to fall back upon to protect 
us from the things we don't know about, and this is alright.  It's perfectly 
human to want to protect your ideals and way of life, but there is a fine 
balance between protecting what you believe, and insulting or hurting others 
to acheive that protection.

Here's a thought...what if one of those girls is on sfraves?  How do you 
think that she might feel being publicly called a sleezy, slutty tramp by 
the same people that she was so comfortable with and trusted only a couple 
days ago?

Granted, they might not quite "fit in" to our rave culture through looks or 
actions, but since we are so open minded, we will accept them no matter who 
they are...right?  It may be difficult at first, but I believe that we could 
be a whole lot more constructive in their learning about what raving means 
to them, than name calling and singling them out as a negative aspect to a 
positive thinking culture.

IMHO,

Scott =)

Here's my perspective on this whole thing:

Coming from a different musical and cultural background from most of y'all,
I can definitely see that there is such a thing as "rave culture".  While
it is a very kind and gentle culture, with smiles and lollipops and glowy
things, it is a culture nonetheless.  People in the scene make the mistake
of confusing gentility with acceptance, though.  Just like any other
'scene', there are those whose attitude meshes with the scene and those
whose doesn't.

It is only natural for people to defend a scene from what they feel is the
encroachment of others.  Who wouldn't?  When I was younger, and people
started listening to ska and dancehall and all of the stuff that I thought
was the private domain of me and my friends, I was scared as hell!!  I
thought that goonish jocks and teeny-bopper would start skanking, and that
would be it.... we had fights, hostility, all of that shit... all from a
scene that was originally based on individuality and respect.  Five years
later, real ska and dancehall culture is just starting to recover.

The point is this:  defend your scene from the intruders.  Do it with all
your heart. Do it with all your soul. Just do it using the tools that make
your scene great to begin with, not with your fists or with scathing
rhetoric.  If you show some class, and evangelize what is good about UG
culture, you will either scare off or prosteletyze (sp?) the booty-shakers.
And you will have retained your own dignity in the process.

Well, he's got a point here.  It costs a lot to manufacture records and
they probably got a test press before ordering a full production run to
insure that it sounded ok.  So the Rampant guy may have thought, "Well,
the test press sounded ok, and no one else has complained, so maybe he
just got a defective copy..."

But this is just pure assholishness (nice word, eh :).  Even if he didn't
offer to send a replacement (which I do *not* think he is obligated to do,
btw), he could have explained that there are always bad units in a
production run of records.  When you put in an order to have something put
to vinyl, you are implicitly agreeing to a 10% overrun of records.  That
is, they press 10% more than you request to account for the fact that many
of them will skip, sound bad, etc.

Brian is absolutely right about these points.

> point #1: you can't judge a party by its cover.

But I can't agree with this one.  If you read the whole cover, and
follow "Krusty's Rules" for parties, you *can* judge how a party will
*probably* go off.  To paraphrase my meager memory of the "Krusty's
Rules":

1. The larger and fancier the flyer, the worse it's going to be.  Small,
simple flyers are the best.

2. The more phone numbers, the worse it's going to be.  If it has more
than two numbers, there's a problem.

3. The more overpublicized a party is, the worse it's going to be.  When
I saw a party getting huge advertising in any form, I avoided it. 
There's going to be too many immature people looking for a public forum
in which to get baked and look mean.

4. And the most important rule: go with promoters with good reps.  My
faves were FnF, Gateway, and Harmony.  I've been to good parties by
other promoters, Nomad and FGE included, but NOTHING beat those three
promoters for consistently phat, vibey parties.

5. Actually, point 4 ties with point 5 for importance: go where other
ravers you know and love are going.  We all have been at some really
crappy party where the sound was awful, the lighting was nonexistant,
and there were just too many darn bodies packed in one place, but we
found some friends to party with and it turned out to be a killer night
after all.  The *people* make the party.

Fellow ravers,

I was wondering if someone could give me an advice which venue to rent
(Friday or Saturday)  for a small rave of around 100. 

Having no clue of the going rate in SF I'd really appreciate some hints. 

Regards
Jan

I'd have to see your friend's original email to know whether Rampant's
response is out of line.  If you expect courtesy, it helps to be courteous.
Think your friend is up for posting what he really said to them?

I've already received many responses to the Rampant Issue. Several
people have asked to see the original post, before making any
judgements. That makes complete sense to me... So, I emailed my
friend and asked him if he has the original. Unfortunately, he sent
the mail from a Netscape browser, as he was checking out the 
Rampant Web Site, and didn't CC: a copy to his account...

I have included some questions that I asked him while in a 'Talk'
session...

At the end of this post, you will find Brian's address. He is the one
who wrote to Rampant, and welcomes any email in his direction
as well. I'm sorry that neither of us has the original. You can obviously
choose whether or not you believe what he originally wrote. Regardless,
I believe it was in poor taste for Rampant to react the way they did.
Brian wasn't asking for a new copy of the record. He was just pointing
out that he wasn't completely satisfied with the recording quality...

'Transcript' from the Talk session

Me:
did you write it in anger (i.e. bitchy) or was it cool headed?

Him (Brian): 
i've had the record for over a month and i half.  i was writing from a
very clear head... i just wanted to let them know that i had a minor 
problem with thier records!

nothing big...it was not a big problem that i had with them.  i had no
idea that i was going to get such an attitude !

Me:
do you mind if I forward this to sfraves?

Brian:
please do!  i want people to know that i wasn't trying to be malicious
when i wrote that!

it really hurt my feelings that a company such as rampant could be s
o rude to a simple complaint!...jason has the same record with the same
problem!

Can someone tell me what drugs this boy is on?
he's the only person that considers coolWorld to be the best party
he's been to! ;o) he either a) hasn't been to a good party, b) he's on way
too many drugs at once or c) all of the above.

I'm just kidding with you MrNStuff.... 
Love and hugs
Pab

Sorry, just a waste of bandwidth :o)

Of cousre the party was kool to you because you did not see the people
that were getting kicked around on the floor. One again these are getto
children party's and should not be connected with the positiveness of
the rave scene!

Kermit,

I still don't know what the hell you're talking about with your misspelled
"ghetto" reference, but your language is creeping towards racism. Please
knock it off. 

 Put your "positiveness" into perspective.

Yes, thank you.  The sexist language quotient on this list is definitely 
increasing, and it's disheartening to _this_ woman, at least!

Look for a future post on why "hootchie mamas" gyrating on stages at 
"raves" are upsetting to many women.  --N

Getto children is a new term we made up last nite. I am normally a happy
person but all the BS about cool world and madness party's from ignorant
people who are supporting these f___ing wished they knew what a rave was
fakes!!!!! I am so totally disturbed about the mis interpritaion of what
a rave is, is making me sick!!!!!! How can you see any postitiveness
from a party where you know they will be a fight, stabbing,
shooting!!!!!

I WISHED I WAS STILL A TADPOLE, BACK WHEN I SAW ONLY THE INOCENSE IN
LIFE!!!!

Um, Kermey, I believe you're being called a racist for that comment, and
I would tend to agree.  Again, could you explain, in clear terms, what
you mean by "ghetto children"?

Not that I've ever been to a "championship", but I would reckon that it's
based on (1)style (scratching, cuts, tricks like cueing with your toes), and
(2)record selection.  Hip-hop djing has more competitive aspects to it  than
rave type djing, where there are less show-offy type of things to do with
the records.

I never once shot down living in the getto... If you got that out of

I am refrencing to the type of people/scene not about where people live.

have heard a lot of records on Rampant and they all seem to sound very poor,

that is, but I haven't bought anything from them since because I can never

Your house party was a really kool place to mellow out with all our
close friends. Thanks to all that spun to upllift my negative spirits. I
hope your bro is still kool with the nites event. 

And as for the trend I sure hope it does become one at your house. The
park behind your house set a really loving and peaceful mood.

I've been a subscriber a little less than two weeks now, and this is

 This post was deliberate.

 Kermit,

Who's "we"?  I picture a crew of jaded old-school Resistance Ravers hiding
in some underground bunker in Berkeley, stockpiling mixtapes and Evian jugs,
holding out for the doomsday Rave.     Sheeesh, lighten up, will ya? 

 Okay, so there are different kinds of parties: the Harmony type, the
Coolworld type, and everything in between.    You have a choice, and
everyone else has a choice, for what to do on a Saturday night.  Stop trying
to fight against the evolution of things.  You remind me of my Grandpa
Fidget, for chrissake.    Everything that happens, happens for a reason
(well, you may or may not subscribe to /that/ magazine.)  But all you're
doing is giving yourself a hernia and everyone else a headache. 

By the way, a ghetto is an ethnic neighborhood, and I imagine you're being
quite rude to a number of people on this list by continually using the term
as an association of bad vibes.

You keep talking about "positiveness" while you're spoutin' out negativeness.  

>I WISHED I WAS STILL A TADPOLE, BACK WHEN I SAW ONLY THE INOCENSE IN LIFE!!!!

Funny, you're still acting like a Tadpole, the way you're  fightin' and
fussin' because things ain't going the way you want 'em to.   

Is you a frog or is you ain't?

your pal,

To further enhance what vertigo said...
yes, the vibe inside was bad, negative, awful, evil and most of all SCARY!!!
but outside we were all trying to make the best of a bad situation by loving
each other, smiling and trying to help the few who needed it.
love
april
(with my fuzzy dalmation backpack full of candy, if any of you see me at a
party. most likely i will always have a bag completely full of candy....
please do not hesitate to ask and take more than one or two.  That is why i
have candy... so enjoy!!!!!:)

The point I am trying to make is, " Ghetto  Children " are the people
that kill the happy vibe. Keep it from flowing. Usually by looks,
attitude, and their immature desires to fight. Beacuse thats all they
can do, beacuse they sure can not dance!!!

it's not what the party makes of you..
it's what YOUR funky ass makes of the PARTY!
yes, the vibe SUCKED!
oh man april i am SO sorry that was your first massive experience, 
because dear, there are some good massives out there! i pomise!

anyway, i stood in line from 8:45-10:30, thanks to the people who all 
cut in front of me.. i LOVE YOU ALLin all seriousnesess, i hope you 
got the best out of that extra half hour you had in front of the 
JUNGLE speakers and not walking around causing shit. which i saw ALOT 
of going on. a really NICE cop ran into me while about 100 scary 
looking people rushed the hallway that runs to the chillroom.. he was 
like :i am SO  very sorry!" and ran after the crowd.. you know 
something's wrong when the ravers are meaner and scarier than the 
cops.. hemm not to talk bad about cops or anything :)
	SO! lesse.. lara got in her car and went to berkeley and picked 
up about 7 people in her car, then went to home base super early, 
hoping to have no line. WRONG! i guess $6 tyo get in really inspires ravers 
to arrive early an'shit.. anyway, it was great, meeting some of the 
people in line, sharing stickers, candy, bouncing around, dancing up and down 
the line.. good vibe, i was thinking, this MIGHT JUST BE OKAY!! 
but THEN we got in. wow i awlmost wanted to go back and stand in line again!
my smiles and pink feather boa that stariana let me borrow on, i 
walked into a packed room of tall all-dark-clothed-wearing people.. and ran 
straight outside!
	where my friends and i had planned to meet(we were there 
during love a-fair too) sadly, the outside was NOT as safe haven for us 
as it was last weekend.. my friend's backpack got stolen, another's 
camera got stolen.. right from under our noses.. and inside, well that was 
WORSE! my friend got his wallet stolen by some pricks pretending to 
be narcs or something to him (he wasn't even selling..) and people 
stared at me like i'm some kind of freak (was it the fact that i was 
smiling?!) :))~
	anyway, i DID try to have fun, dearest ORSON made my night 
along with Fernando, the best part of the night was groovin underneat h 
the huge white sheet up against the speakers in the jungle room with em.. the 
jungle didn't hold me that night, dunno.. just not the same as audio 
impact? VERTIGO! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LOOKING FOR ME AND FINDING ME! 
i think everyone should meet this kind, sweet guy! :) so happy to 
meet and hang with sfravers, oo hallo to you all! (april, ryan, ryan, 
sherry, kawai, eric, PABS!!, orson, umm everyone else..:))
	i was so scared when i walked in and thought about april being 
alone :( at her first massive THERE! :(( 
HOMEBASE PLEASE HAVE ONE MORE PARTYY
CoolWorld did you no justice!
the only good thing about CoolWorld was the fact that they let me 
bring 
in my strawberries and fuzzy blanket to hang out on outside. i'm 
still deciding what to do this weekend, i want it to be perfect cuz 
it's my last weekend as a TEENAGER i'm turning 20 on damn march 3 
(pisces unite!) 
	i'm sooo sorry for my silliness in my review, i've been 
thinking about how wonderful it is when you can go to a shitty party and 
find 
a group of friends and have a bombass time that lasts hours after the 
party cleared out.. thank you, all of my friends for putting a 
perma-grin for life on my face and filling my heart with so much 
love.. time 2 move on to bigger (or smaller) and better parties! ;)
love you all!
lara
~~EBF!!!!ILOVEYOU!!!!~~~
p.s. one more thing.. if you ever get the chance to meet Ace or 
Aaron.. they are incredibly beautiful people. they don't have email, but 
Ace spent all of PNY watching out for our group outside and their 
stuff, caught a guy trying to run off with a friend's backpack.. he's 
so concerned about everyone else, he forgets he came to have fun 
himself! :)) and Aaron, for buying $30 of water  for everyone to 
share.. OH there are many other beautiful people out there that aren't 
on the list :) its a shame we can't share them all on-line as well as 
off.. anyway.. smooches!

It seemed pretty clear to me that most of this guys posts were either
blatant cries for attention or miserably unintelligent or the result of 
a sadly spun mind ... it was a monday you know! ... you choose =)

(Long...as usual!)


Friday Night
After a tour of diverse SF bars, me and my woozy group hit 1015.  
Good-sized crowd, not too packed or empty (as Nikita usually vacillates 
between!).  

We got there at 1 and Jerry Bonham was already on the main 
floor - and was still on when we split 4 hours later!  He spun some hard 
progressive trance (I think I might have just invented that category, but 
that sums it up) - a little too out-there for the mostly mainstream 
crowd, I think.  Jerry kept paring the music down with minimal beats, 
building bridges to the next phase... a great technique for creating an 
intense trancey set... but whenever the music slowed, the entire crowd 
stopped, unsure how to dance to "just beats!"  I did the "raver sway" :).

People crowded the front (disco and hip-hop) room - but although it was 
the "clubber" crowd, the vibe was relaxed, without any unnecessary 
rudeness or ogling.  As usual, the shift in atmosphere at 2AM when the 
barpeople left was palpable.  And Nikita must know their clientele, 
because right at 2 they abandoned disco in the front room and moved to 
_much_ more underground sounds!

Had fun with my non-raver friends there... Seeing "Last Call" spelled out by 
the lasers and flashing along with trance was a little weird though!


Saturday Night
After a tour of diverse Berkeley parties, a woozy me and my ragtag raver 
group hit Madness.  Got there around 12:30, and at first I 
was disappointed... the party seemed so empty and decorations so sparse 
compared to the incredible Koinonea party in the same space a few weeks 
ago... but we decided to give it a shot... UG ravers must be a bunch of 
laggers, because by 1:30 the place was finally full of happy ravers and 
the energy was transformed!  Most of my group spent the night upstairs, 
but I (of course) planted myself on the dance floor and could not be torn 
away... a slave to the beat... 

Minor Minor was still on when we got there, playing harder, more minimal 
stuff then I've heard from him before (and it rocked), and then T-1000 
came on for a huge portion of the night - what a treat!  His music was as 
technical and robotic-sounding as his name... music expressing a 
nightmare of the industrial age... or maybe turning into melody what is 
seemingly devoid of humanity?  (just questions I wrestled with while 
dancing my ass off)... Serious Detroit, some of it sounding really 
experimental.  I couldn't keep still, and the expressive and joyous crowd 
on that teeny hot dancefloor kept my spirits skyhigh :).  

I've never enjoyed minimal techno in the past.  I actually had to leave a 
party once a while back that was Detroit all night long.  But I have been 
through some sort of rave metamorphesis... suddenly I am a child of the 
beat... if there is a beat, I can find the soul of the music and my body 
will move to it... Categories of trance or goa or house or minimal are 
meaning less to me, I can become absorbed into the throbbing rhythm and 
take off from there - it's a wonderful feeling!  I finally feel like a 
true dancer.

The partygoers dwindled around 3, leaving a small group of about 30 of us 
on the dancefloor, and that's when it got the most fun.  Room to move and 
breathe and smiling people and relentless beats...

We left at 5:30, when the party was on its last legs.  But a few of us 
were still raring to go, so we hit that refuge of the night, the End-Up.  

Four bucks seemed a bit steep, but in we went (too desperate to bitch).  
What a funny scene!  All the remnants of the partying world deposited 
there... from strutting queens (and I mean that in the most appreciative 
manner) to tweaking trendies to "suburbanites" to ravers... and we were 
_all_ gettin' down.  The music was house, ranging from deep to cheese, 
and it was all good.  We danced and danced until we could go on no more, 
and finally drove home in the crystal-clear light of Sunday morning.

A good weekend.
:)

You are incorrect about there being no violence. There was a good
amount. You were 
just in the raver state of mind. Hear no evil, See no evil. Which is the
best state of mind
to be in. But maddness has turned in a comercial party and has lost the
touch of the underground.

I hope you are getting my drift!

I don't know who you are, "Candy Raver Kermit," but I know one thing for
sure: you don't know who *we* are.  

sfraves has never been the kind of place where people indulge in careless
talk about "getto children" and "bitches".  I think your appearance on this
list is a sign of how the times have changed.  This kind of rough language
is used by people to impress others with how tough they are, how superior
they are.  We are *not* impressed.  And though there may be some interest
in flaming right back, I suspect we're also going to get past that as well.

This kind of talk indicates either deep-seated racism (which is doubtful
among the people likely to be interested in this list and this scene)
or very shallow life experience.  Who are these "getto children" and where
do they come from?  I wonder if you've even given this two seconds of 
though, "Candy Raver Kermit."  If you ask *them*, I bet you'll find out
they come from anywhere between and including West Oakland and Blackhawk,
or any other two random points on this planet.  

If you judge any group based on their clothes, their way of talking or
their skin color, it's certainly a way to stir up discussion and yelling.
But this is what James Brown meant when he sang about "talking loud and
saying nothing."  

As our little underground dance music scene started spreading out into wider
society, we started seeing some of the superficial and negative attitudes
circulating in general society start creeping in as well.  

If we really believe in the ideals we expressed in the past under the banner
of the House Nation, we had better be prepared to deal with this whole ball
of wax.  

The party Saturday night was not a "getto children party," it was a Cool
World party.  The vibe at their parties is the vibe *they* develop.  It
has to do with motivation and perspective.  Enough said.

As for the "ghetto," let's do a little thought experiment.  Imagine that
the places people consider to be "ghettos" had never existed.  Those are
places where people, regular people just like us, grow up, live, have
families, work, play, smile, cry, conduct real lives under difficult
circumstances.  It's not just about people roughing each other up and worse
on the street.  That's a fact of that life, but not the only one.  

One other thing -- there music in the "ghetto" -- a LOT of it, it comes
straight from the heart under the most difficult circumstances.

Without the "ghetto" we would have:

- No jazz, born in New Orleans, Chicago, Kansas City, Harlem New York and LA.

- No rock'n'roll, born on the doo-wop streetcorners of Manhattan, Brooklyn
  and the Bronx.

- No disco, born in the gay underground clubs from New York to San Francisco.

- No hip hop, straight from the streets of Crooklyn.

- No house, from the heart of Chicago and New York.

- No techno, from the soul of Detroit.

- No jungle, from the polyglot sprawl of London.

- No reggae, from the hardest ghetto of all, Trench Town Kingston.

This is an important issue -- how we talk to each other and the terms we
use.  I don't think anyone here really condones this kind of abuse of the
language and sloppy thinking.  The question is, how do we deal with it?
Online "communities" are fragile and easily sidetracked and even destroyed
by carelessness, cluelessness and malice.

I apologize for going on and on like this, but I feel that the issue of
what our obligations are to deal with these superficial and messed-up
attitudes in the "kids" entering into this scene is a very important one.

We all have our residual prejudices.  The only shame is in not dealing with
them and using what we learn to help others.  It is not a nice process,
a happy process.  It is a necessary process.  There is much wisdom in the
statement: 
  
  Positive education always corrects error.

peace out
phred

Of cousre the party was kool to you because you did not see the people
that were getting kicked around on the floor. One again these are getto
children party's and should not be connected with the positiveness of
the rave scene!

I would have to disagree with some points...
my first party had a very played up flyer
(my first was only in mid oct...)
it was in Santa Cruz at the Su-Bud house, called Pure-X
it was a phat party. I didn't know vibes that well yet, but being my first
eeeee it was a fun experience... i do not recall any bad vibes.  I had a most
wonderful time.  
I love parties so much because of my fabulous first experience...
And the flyer had 3 numbers and was very big and colorful.
so, don't judge a book by its cover, it might suck, bbut then again it might
be bomb.
another point to make.. try to go to all party crew's parties and find out
what kind of party they throw.  If you like the vibe at they're party, keep
going, if you had an awful time, don't go to another (unless you believe in
2nd chances)
love april

Your message was well spoken. 

I think people have misunderstood understood my terminology of "Ghetto
Children". This term was created to summarize a specific type of person.
A person who comes to a party souly to destroy the love we all share. To
hurt for  the soul purpose of self gratification. Some people may
understand what I mean if they have experienced what I am referring
about. 

I know one person that does know what I am talking about and this
person  brought to my attention some things that happened at Madness
that really disturbed her deeply. 

My term Ghetto Children is used for those people that only wish to
hurt others. It does not matter what neighborhood they are from East San
Jose, South San Francisco or the rich Cupertino or Los Gatos. I have
many friends from these not so happy places but they still live in the
sky with the care bears all happy as can be. But for those that inflict
hurt on others for no reason they to me are named the ghetto children.

I just have to say that I agree with this post entirely. Please think a
lillte bit before you post something to 400 people you dont know ... (of
course we all post bandwidth wastin stuff once in a while =) ... but you
gotta respect the fact that you dont know who or what the background of
most of these people are ... I am sure people here have grown up in a
"ghetto", not me... but its not a joke, its a cultural disease ... people
are born into situations(ie. born living in a "ghetto". the first 1/4 of
their lives is spent figuring out what that situation is with respect
to ever expanding communities (ie. my ghetto, your ghetto, hmmm ... you 
dont live in a ghetto, hmmm.... you dont live in my city ... state
church, school, nation, massivelover vs. UGlover ad nauseum)... if they
are lucky, they figure that part out(the part about how much does my
born-situation(for lack of a better word) affect my potential... I must
emphasise If they are LUCKY ... figuring this shit out is half the
battle... once you can see yourself as a part of a certain community and
structure that you were THROWN into, you can start moving into the
intentional restructuring of this situation 

... damn....that cartoon book
explanation of heideggers' philosophy sure is enlightening! 

learn to respect yourself...that is all you really need.

Ok, Now, I'm am starting to get upset. This means one of two things:
1.Someone should straighten this guy out, maybe he's just misunderstanding
several very key and fundamental things here(race/gender relations, a rocking
party vs. a not-so-rocking party)

2. If I have to be the one to do the straightening out here this guy will end
up with extra orifices(orifi?) when I am done with him. I will wait until
tomorrow an ddecide then.

Some of my friends want to go, but im not sure if its gonna be good or not!  I
really hope so.  Well if any of you are, I hope to see you this weekend.

Peace

I love kermit dearly
he is a very very good friend of mine
stop twisting his words!!!!!
his ghetto children refered not to people who live in the ghetto.
it refered to the people who were negative and threw out that vibe...
stop bashing him for his own thoughts on what he feels
And after my experience with the cruel world party, i can't say his feeling
was wrong.  
and by the way... look who's throwing out negativity now... don't be so harsh
 on others feelings.  Listen to what they have to say, post your opininions,
but don't try to hurt them.  Another thing... don't twist other people's
words... it's hard to re explain what you have said after someone else
completely turns it around.
love
april :/

a ravE actually, but I didn't concider it one. But I did have a good time,
and I probably will at my next massive. 

 For me..  It's a matter of things that DON'T HAPPEN that make my night
more special.. Because.. These things DO HAPPEN more than they don't.
 I was 78% sober at Cool World by the way.  =]:..

Things = Stuff

But much lovez though..
And your post was funny.
Ok?

Remember the kids back in elementary, middle and high school who would pull
the fire alarms, or the ones that spread rumors about others, or the kids who
always got in fights? What they wanted was attention.these where the only
ways they new how to get it. The only way Kermit knows how to get attention
is by angering others. He feeds off of it. Ignore it. 
Peace and much respect,
Jonathan

I don't see what is racist about this term?
ghetto is a term applied to a bad neighborhood as far as i know,

i think you are the one being racist saying that only certain ethnicities
are in the ghetto. Ghetto is not a term specifying any race or ethnic 
background what-so-ever, unless you are prone to belief in stereotypes.

 Well, I don't think I have ever met Kermit (Matt) but I have met 
b))merang and listened to him spin. Not only is he a fabulous ambience DJ 
but he is one of the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met. 

 Which is far more than I can say about the recent spat of posts by 
fly-breath. While I can understand the outrage and anger that is 
lingering from such an obviously "scandelous" party, it seems Mr. Frog 
you are mearly burying yourself on this list (for the most part).
 
 Take a deep breath and say "why"?

Thanx!
I think. I don't know?


What about if you throw a.... ravE?


Nevermind.. I am just fishing for negativity. Disregard.
It just hard to tell where your heart is when you use the word PARTY on
this list.

 Just in one of them "feel picked on" moods I guess..
  Sorry for having a good time peoples..

 Not really though.. Because I already let enough people get to me.. This
is just computer stuff.

 Ouch.. Advil anyone?
 So sew me.. I can't spell Tylonol..  =]

My newly found friend Yogi's backpack got stolen at that... that.. thing.

 We both thought it was more drug related, because all he had in the
backpack was a can of Nitro (not for sale). For being on 4 hits a Acid, he
took it very well. He was just alittle disappointed. It really sucked to
see the look of disappointment on his face.. Cause you could just tell,
that it hurt him, knowing that someone would do that at such a time/place.
He didn't care about the loss, as much as the fact.

But.
Is it a small world after all? Or was there some jerks just going around
ripping off everyone's gear?

If your friend, and my friend are not the same person. It is clear that;
there are actually people out there that go; just to take advantage of good
people.



I sure am sick of alot of shit.
Sometimes reading this list really disturbs.......Even me.

I have about 7 or 8 copies of Rampant records. I have the first and I have
some recent ones too. I have never noticed a pressing problem with any of
their records as well as any sound problems. Now I can't account for their
rude response.

derogatory term, so i'm sorry for jumping to conclusions.

Thanks for helping me out. You and April so far are the only people that
are really seeing what I am saying. I think a large percentage of the
folks on sfraves are a little trigger happy. They jump at something =

before they even really understand what is trying to be stated. =

In about a bajillion other posts on this list I've seen the term
"gangstas" used to refer to vibe-killing, attitude-copping, potentially-
violent party poopers.  Why not stick with that?  "gangsta" to me means
someone who chooses to gang and bang, whereas "ghetto children" seems like
a slam against kidz who happened to grow up in da inner city.

In other words, Kermit, you're pissing people off with "ghetto children"
because there's nothing wrong with being from the ghetto, and not all kids
from the ghetto cop the anti-vibe you're talking about.

Oh well, flame on....

PEOPLE!!!!!

this is a rave mailing list and we people are not perfect, so we all make
mistakes! 

This list should have freedom of speech, yet if someone says something that
is offending, PLEASE, DO NOT bash that person for it. Post a reply to, or
better yet, privately e-mail that person and tell them what you thought was
offensive and why. The person whose head you are bashing in might have
thought that "thunder-thighs" were extremely spicy chicken legs, not a
derogatory remark slandering those who are overweight. And when they said
that the 'crackers in this restaurant were stale' they probably werent
saying in a mean way that there were elderly caucasions there.

I know these two examples are rather cheesy, but I am just using them to
make a point.

I'm sorry, as long as I'm on this track, there is a couple other things i
have wanted to say, but haven't been in a 'voice-my-opinion' mood til now. 

It seems to me that some ppl that subscribe to this list edit the mail they
recieve rather than digest it. Sometimes I will read a post that had a lot
of feeling put into it, and then read a reply that, rather than containing
feedback, contains one line stating "The word is spelt 'temple' not
'tempel'." A reply like this really discounts the the emotion was put into
the initial post. I want my voice to be heard, not graded for errors.

Another thing, and I have been guilty of this before(who hasnt?) brings
a couple of words to mind, "impulse, assume," and maybe even 
"impatience". Take this for example;

- You finally finish downloading the 158 e-mails you recieved from SFRAVES
mailing list during your lunch hour, and begin to skim for topics that seem
interesting, you see a subject that draws your attention, so you open it.
You read the first two lines hurriedly, and think to yourself, 'FUCK THIS!
I gotta send a reply to this!' So you angrily write your reply dissaproving
of the statement that had been posted. Then three seconds later think,
'hmmm, maybe i should read the rest of that post." Don't we feel dumb now?

Sorry to bring up negatives of sfraves, but to me, these things can put a
damper on and/or bury posts that really deserve attention. There is so much
energy in this mailing list, i feel it every time i hit the 'check mail'
button.

-EVEN MORE LOVE!!!

-justin

 Personally I always thought that "thunder thighs" meant a women who had 
thighs that could crack your head like an egg. Oh too die for...

asbestos undies in place.

Hmm...
This seems a little out of line and a little out of character from what
I've experienced with Rampant.  When I had my radio show at KDVS, Rampant
used to send CDs from time to time (Planet Rampant, etc.) and I have
picked up many Rampant vinyls over time.  I have not had any problems with
the pressings I've picked up.  It's possible that your buddy just got a
bad rekkid... maybe the person at the shop left it in the sun or
something.  :/
Seeing as Rampant puts out some really fun left-coast breakbeats, I think
it would be a little harsh to just ignore the label from now on, but also
there are plenty of other labels and artists out there, so it's not like
you'll be missing out on techno all together.  
I'll keep buying Rampant rekkids, if I like 'em.  I'd like to hear the
track that your buddy had a problem with, tho...

Hi there sfraves.old.pals,

In many ways, my attitude is a mirror of the list. Sometime's we're mostly
happy. Sometimes we're not. Most of the time I can resist. Sometimes I
cannot.

I've decided to do my best to funnel my negative rants once again to
/dev/null instead of punishing you whenever possible.

To quote Steve Simitzis: "I am a very peaceful animal until provoked."

Thanks. :-)

*sigh*

Well to top it all off, you do appear violating every raver's favorite
Net.No-No and responding publicly to private messages.  Clearly Chinley has
specifically mentioned this, and if I'm not mistaken (correct me if I'm
wrong joe), you appear to have done it also with Joe Rice's message.  I'd
hafta say your biggest problem here is not thinking for a single second
about what you're saying before you say it and how it affects other people.  
"Open mouth A.  Insert foot B."

*sigh*

I know I know I know I'm not supposed to let this get to me but I can't help
it!  Ack!  My god, what on earth is this person talking about?  Was there
some enormous knife threat at Madness (no doubt caused by some evil Concord
circle-dancers! ;) that we happy rose-colored-glasses-wearing ravers just
missed cuz we're blind?  I sure as HELL dont think so!  And I'm sure that
Joe as one of the promoters would be the one to know.  I know that smiling
dancing ravers offering you water can frequently be mistaken for evil knife-
& gun-wielding criminals who are out to sell you crappy drugs, but COME ON!
And Madness *commercial*???  "Puh-leaze.  Oh. My. God.  Like I am SO sure."
Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.  (whoops, mental image I did
*not* want). And the unmitigated gall of the Madness folk to charge *$5*!
Obviously they're just out to make a buck.  Shit, they can have my buck!

Really, some facts about where you get your opinions of Madness being
overly-commercial and full of violence would be warranted.

Madness reminded me once again about why I fell in love with raving in the
first place, and *most* everybody here knows it.

Again:
*sigh*

And I apologize to everybody else for letting him get to me. :(

Much love,
Shawna

I would just like to say to anyone who flames anyone for any comment:
Let he who has never sinned cast the first stone!!

Remebr that before you flame me with a remark about religion for this
one.
By the way I am not Chirstian or Chatholic I am Jewish.
So why am I posting something that Jesus said? It makes since thats why.
Everyone needs to get off the stupid flaming shit. Its poitnless.
Everyone on all of SFRaves has probably said something to someone about
ghetto chidlren or adidas freaks or massive-rats or preppy bitches that
talk all night on your phone.
Everyone!!! Wake up and smell the ceptic tank! Boys are not made of
snips and snail and puppy dogs tails. Girls are not made of sugar and
spice and everything nice.

Welcome to Reality 101! Its a cruel world. How do I know??
Whats the first thing that happenes at the begining or birth.

You are all comfy in a nice bubble of warm fluids. Some fat lady that
looks liek a circus tent that wants you to call her moms does all teh
eating/breathing/pissing/shitting/crack for you for nine months.
Then all of a sudden your little bubble of warmth is popped all the
fluids drain out. Then the hole starts to squeeze you out. May take a
day and a half or a few mintues. Then right before you think its gonna
squeeze you to a pulp your out.
Bright lights are in your eyes. Theres a fat ugly doctor with bad breath
looking at you. He shoves something down your throat nose ears etc.
He cuts your cord and hangs your upside down and smacks your chubby
little ass. You scream in pain.
They wash you off in cold water wrap you in a blanket and had you over
to this half disenflated bitch that wont stop buggin you with "Awww
isn't he cute."; He has his fathers eyes!"; and "What a good strong
boy."

Everything is peaches and cream for a while and then you start
kindergarten. Then comes Jr.High where everyone excludes you fromt ehir
clique and then comes puberty. Acne. AIDS. Teen Pregnancies. Fights.
Gangs. Parents. Peer Presure. School Work. Money. Jobs. and a whole
bunch more of uncomfortable shit.

This goes on until you kick the bucket and die!

And now they tell us we need to be little happy ravers.
Well Okay with me I can do that. But If i say some comment like ghetto
children or adidas or plur don't piss on me just because what i say or
the terminolgy is un-acceptable to your eyes!!!

SFRaves is
1. A paging sevice
	-How the fuck eles are we suppose to get in contact with a raver 
	who's phone numebr we don't have?
2. A place to gripe
	- How the hell else are the promoter gonna know if we like or 	don't
like their little rave.
3. A place to shit on COOL WORLD
	- Come on people we all know COOL WORLD doesn't throw raves. 		Its a
party productions. They don't need the be plurish
	besides if it wasn't for COOL WORLD what raves would all the bad 	vibes
go to?
4. Not a place to flame other peopel and take out all the stress from
being a raver in a scene thats is deteriorating faster than we can say
Peace. Love. Unity. & Respect
5. FUN for the family.

If you read all this thanks.
And I leave you with this note.
Shit on me and fuck you all.
By the way if you see me at a rave you know that i am cool and full of
good vibes even of the e.
Thsi is life people learn to deal with the ghetto children of society.
Okay I think I am done posting for at least a month now.
Please flame me openly so everyone can see how nicely you all prove my
point.
Oh and to all my FRIENDS on SFRaves: I love you all and don't take this
personally because deep inside you all agree and are tired of all the
bull shit on this mailing list.

Love.Luck.Lollipops,
Paul

Its acceptable because they were on the phone all night and friends who
wanted to come couldn't get intouch with me to get directions.
I think anyone would be mad if people you didn't know were on your phone
make calls to you don't know who (probably someone in Paris, France) and
refused to get off the phone. That's why that stamement is acceptable.
Thankyou very much.

OK so..
Fuzzypants Paul says:
"And I leave you with this note.
Shit on me and fuck you all.
By the way if you see me at a rave you know that i am cool and full of
good vibes even of the e."

Paul, I met you once at a party, and I talk thru e-mail once in 
awhile and I know you can be a good vibin person..BUT! since when 
does the attitude "shit on me and fuck you all" fall into the 
category of good vibes? 
I hate to get into this whole mess but it seems that you and Kermit 
are throwing this whole thing into SFRaves about how "ghetto 
children" ruin the vibes at parties, yet then you post that CoolWorld 
parties aren't raves.. If you don't want to be around these type of 
people, then here's an idea, don't go.. or go, make the best of it, smile..
and don't complain.. we have 
plenty of good parties out there.
	 try to put it into a "ghetto kid's" 
POV (point of view).. they go to clubs, hear a few club djs are 
spinning at a HUGE thing in an abandoned wearhouse in Oakland, and 
there will be easy access to drugs, girls/boys and other people's 
shit to gank or something. or, maybe some ofthem DO go for the music. 
	they show up, and find a bunch of what they think are freaks 
dressed in kiddy clothes, running around hugging and kissing 
people they don't even KNOW, smearing stinky gooey glitter and vicks 
vaporub all over the place..their eyes wild with the 
vibe/drug/music/whatever they're excited about. I know that a friend 
met a girl at a partyy who said she HATED the party because she 
thought people were too nice there. It's all about the perspective. 
You'd have to be a damn fool to go into a Cool World party expecting 
it to have a great vibe.. There are 2 totally different types of 
people coming together to do 1 thing -- party and have a good time -- 
and our definitions of "partying" are incredibly different.
I guess this is where my point kicks in ;))
 There is no one perfect group to belong to. 
you're not COOL just because you smile and give a sticker to someone 
one night then bash people the next day by callingfriends you invited 
into your home "bitches" or whatever. you're not COOL because you 
know all the phattest tunes and you wear the funkiest shit. those 
things don't make you cool. what makes you cool is what comes from 
your heart. if it's love, warmth, caring and happiness, you're down. 

	i know the intentions of Kermit and Paul and all are not to 
hurt anyone, they are in fact expressing their opinions. Perhaps we 
all got a little out of hand bashing them, but then, perhaps they got 
a little out of hand themselves. Now let's all just take a deep 
breath, forget the term "ghetto children" even came to mind, and let 
each other have opinions in peace. Express your opinion, hell yes!
It's our right to express whatever we damn well please.. but do it 
without the razor-edge next time, your words and spirit will be much 
more respected in the longrun, even *if* flaming boosts your ego a 
lil bit :)
love, hugs and PEACE to you all (for once guys?! :))

Hey everyone,

Well our first collective party went great.  Dispite the fact we had to 
change locations at 2 am we all had a lot of fun.   I know this is not 
really san francisco rave teritory but there is no central coast list and 
well I'm from the bay area.  

   We found a great space but unfortuantly the owner as well as the  san 
Luis Obisbo police department would not allow us to continue the party 
past 2.  We had a back up location and because we know of this in 
advanced we planned a free outdoor sunset on Sunday the next day.  Wow 
what work this whole event was but now that I look on it, it was all good.
We got about 300+ people and lost only about 100 buck for the whole 
weedend but it was well worth it.  

	We decorated the place with daygolw paintings, blacklights and 
Jesica T worked out a nice lighting display for us.  (btw she will be 
moving to sf soon to provide you sfr's some w/ nice eye candy and some 
fresh ideas :)  We charged $7 (even though we had nice flyers.  We got a 
deal from monochrome (LA) but after the hastle to get them up it wasn't 
worth it - a whole notha story)    

Good things:  No drugs and a GREAT vibe! All the dj's were great.  Thanks 
MODA and Jazz-e for comming and staying to play at the beach party.  
Stareyes layed down some sick jungle and Spaceboy did great for his first 
jungle set.  Morgan rocked but we had to cut him off at 2 but he 
continued at the new space with Mika playing some trip hop, Diego-v 
played some house and Maris went on as well.

 Sunday was beauty full.  30-40 close friends on the beach dancing and 
enjoying the tunes of Jazz-e, MODA, Spark-e, Alex and spaceboy.  We 
started around 3 and continued till about 10.30 pm when the mostly full 
moon luminated the sky line.   We built a huge bon fire and succeded in 
gettting everyone to their feet to join hands and dance around the flames 
together for at least 20 minutes.  (Dennis - Eric I wish you could have 
seen it. )

Thanks Dennis for your kind review and again Moda for comming out,  I'll 
calll ya.  

This friday Morgan's planning another SLO party but however we have the 
same restrictions as with MASS that we have to close at 2am.  (Damn the laws)
So they have a back up location to move the party to. 
   Mike and I just 
found a warehouse out side of town.  The owner will allow us to go all 
night and she even likes the dance movement,  and would mind us doing a 
monthly party there.  If it works out we will have another "old school" 
party planed in March or April.  

This Friday is Axcess with Morgan, Greg (harmony) {can't wait to met ya 
again and hear you spin},  Rico, Astronut Skot, Alex and um another I 
think.  I don't know the voice mail off hand but It will be a 5 dollar 
party.  

                          Support the underground. 

 (btw what happend in SF with Willie Brown, 
Raves, Restrictions, his daughter (did she go to the hospital or 
something).   I heard some rumors, whats the real story?)

PLUR<

       Austin

I agree. That was just an outburst cuz i was pissed off that people are
actually looking for something in your email to flame you with and
taking every little thing personal.
Thats what gets me.
And about those bitches that used the phone...
Vanessa brought them and I am gonna have a discussion with her tommorrow
as sonn as i see her. I don't know them and they were a bad vibe at the
party. Ask anyone who was there (except for the people on drugs)

Lara, you are cool because you get your point accross without flaming
anybody. Thats what I wanted people to do.
Everyone could learn from Lara.

Now I am gonna go to bed. So I will read email tommorow after school.

Love.Luck.Lollipops,
Paul

P.S. Even people that are send out the best vibes can send out the
nastiest vibes. Also, when ghetto children dogg you out its just nothing
because you know they don't understand the point of the rave. When a
raver doggs, its far worse, because they understand a rave and still
have a reson to dogg you. All the negative energey that all the massive
freaks creat is so little comaperd to a raver throwing off negative
vibes. One ravers energey is more powerfull than all of the masive
freak's.

well, i've already gotten one SPAMMER kicked off his ISP by using the
techniques below (making sure the postmasters associated with the spam
account know that their users are sending out unsolicited e-mail). I've
also been updating my mailfilter to auto-file/delete the offending
message each time i receive a spam (generalizing things when I notice a
pattern or an ISP/organization that caters to spammers (e.g. sallynet.com).)

I suggest you all start doing the same because it is our silence that
is allowing these creeps to proliferate!

Anyways, here are my mailfilter rules I use to zap the spammers:

##
## Delete Advertizing Spams
##
Comments "Authenticated sender is" ^ ? "/usr/local/lib/mh6.7/rcvstore +spam"
Apparently-To rizzi@netcom.com ^ ? "/usr/local/lib/mh6.7/rcvstore +spam"

## generalized from Internet.Promoter@alberta.sallynet.com, and
## sesame@alberta.sallynet.com
To alberta.sallynet.com ^ ? "/usr/local/lib/mh6.7/rcvstore +spam"
Message-Id sallynet.com ^ ? "/usr/local/lib/mh6.7/rcvstore +spam"
>From The.SECRET@wavenet.com ^ ? "/usr/local/lib/mh6.7/rcvstore +spam"
## "Unsolicited Commercial E-mail" flag from bizops@isp-inter.net
Subject (UCE) ^ ? "/usr/local/lib/mh6.7/rcvstore +spam"

and here are tonights attempts at fighting the good fight against spammers:

From: "Niels P. Mayer" <mayer@netcom12>


I've just added the "e-mail signature" of a most recent SPAM you've
sent to my mailfilter, so I will not receive any more SPAMs sent from
your organizations to my mail-address. I have effectively been doing
this in the past, allowing me to ignore unsolicited e-mails sent from
your organization(s) against my will, and despire repeated protests and
unsubscribe requests. Of course, your addresses and front-organizations
keep on changing, so I really am getting tired of updating my
mailfilter to auto-delete the crap you assholes are sending me.

Just to make things clear, THIS IS A PRIVATE E-MAIL ADDRESS USED FOR
BUSINESS PURPOSES ONLY AND YOUR MAILINGS ARE INTEREFERING WITH MY
BUSINESS PRACTICE. I REQUEST THAT YOU CEASE AND DESIST SENDING
UNSOLICITED E-MAIL TO MY E-MAIL ADDRESS. This is not the first time I
have requested that you cease annoying me. If this HARASSMENT doesn't
stop, will begin taking further measures, which could be legal, or as a
last resport, I will stoop to your own cretinous level (how'd you like
it if people  started spamming you all back? Maybe you'd one day find
your e-mail addreses added to a reflector to some high-volume USENET
newsgroup containing discussions on topics which you have no interest
in??). Would such actions be any different from your repeated attempts
at sending unsolicited mail against the will of the majority of e-mail
users out there?

However, I'd rather keep things on the up-and-up, so howabout if you
stop using my address for unsolicited e-mail? Please remove it from all
your lamo internet marketing lists because I will go out of my way to
disparage and ignore any products being sold using such sleaze-tactics.

Thank you, and good night!
	Niels.

PS: some info for netcom, incase you are interested in taking action
against these organizations that seem to be spamming many netcom
accounts.

      ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''  A VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
                                        'Your Future Depend on it'
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Dear Friend:

Before  you listen to what we are going to announce, please read  the following 
' Editorial Excerpts '  from some important publications in the United States :

New York Times:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''  " In concluding our review of financial organizations to effect 
change in the 90's, special attention should be called to the  'World Currency
Cartel' based in California. Members of this organization are amassing hundreds 
of millions of dollars in the currency market using a LEGAL METHOD which has 
not been  divulged to the  general  public.  While their purpose if any is not yet 
known, their presence has most certainly been felt" .

ABC Nightly News:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''      "Members of the World Currency Cartel are among the 
                               wealthiest, most powerful men/women in this hemisphere".

More Excerpts  later;  But first let us tell you this:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''                                                        
For a short time, the World Currency Cartel will instruct a limited  number of  
people worldwide how to CONVERT $25  INTO ONE HUNDRED OF LEGAL
CURRENCY. We will transact the first conversion for you, after that you can
quickly and easily do this on your own hundreds or even thousands of times 
every month. TAKE ADVANGE OF THIS 'SECRET FLAW' !
                      '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
We are sure you can see the power of this, however it is even more explosive
than we have yet disclosed. While currency does fluctuate daily, we can show
you how to CONVERT $99 INTO $580 as many time as you want and every 
single day. That means you will be able to exchange $99 AMERICAN LEGAL
CURRENCY DOLLARS (the green paper you buy your groceries with) FOR
$580 OF THE SAME, AND YOU CAN DO THIS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU
WANT EVERY DAY....... VERY LEGALLY & EFFORTLESSLY !!!
                                        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
It only takes about 10 to 15 minutes each time you do this. You can do this
from your home, office or while travelling. All you need is an access to  any
phone line and you can do this from any city on this earth.

Again, we must reiterate: 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''     Anyone can do this and the source is never-ending.
As long as the Global Financial Community continues to use different currencies
with varying exchange rates, the SECRET FLAW will exist.
                                              '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''  
We at the World Currency Cartel would like to see a Uniform Global Currency
backed by gold, but until then we will allow a LIMITED number of individuals
to share in the UNLIMITED PROFITS provided for by the world paper currency
differentials.

We will espouse no more political views nor will we ask you do so. We can say,
however, that our parent organization  'Diamond International' benefits greatly by
the knowledge being shared as we ourselves along with you benefit likewise. 
Your main concern, however, will be how you benefit.

In a short time with almost NO investment or training, you will be a Currency Ex-
change Professional who can make all transanctions from your own home by 
telephone or by mail.....NO ONE CAN STOP YOU FROM EARNING 
                                     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' MILLIONS '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''      
The amount of exchange is entirely upto you. Working just 2 to 3 hours a week, 
you can soon join the list of other Millionaires who does this on a daily basis !
The transactions are so simple a 16 yrs old teenager can do this!! 
DON'T BELIEVE US, EXPERIENCE IT FOR YOURSELF!!!
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Unlike anyone else,  we will assure  you great  wealth and you will add to our
quickly growing base of supporters and join the list of Millionaires being created 
by using  SECRET FLAW in the world currency markets.
               ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

rumbles in world finance markets. While at this time, their game is not completely
known, they certainly be watched by those making major moves in currency 
contracts".

Wall Steet Week:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''    " Watch them, monitor them, extract their knowledge and try
                                   to become one of them. That is the soundest financial
                                   advice I could ever give someone".

National Business Weekly:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''     " While this reporter has been left in the cold as to 
its method of operation, we have been able to confirm that World Currency Cartel
and its members are literally amassing great fortunes overnight".

Barons:
'''''''''''''''''     " Simply put, they (World Currency Cartel) are the single most powerful
                   financial entity to emerge in this decade".

well, ok.  i stand kind-of corrected.  corrected because SDream's right, in
my six-month raving career i've avoided less-than-great raves with pretty
good success by following the rules he outlined.

however, i didn't mean to say that you couldn't make any pretty good
guesses about parties.  i simply meant to say that the price of a party is
not _necessarily_ an indicator of its vibe.

and, SDream, don't those hamstas get in free, anyway?  ;)

there's a delapidated record store down the main strip, but then it's a 
street that i think goes diagonally out from the main strip.  i walked 
there from the MGM, it took about an hour to walk. it would be a 15 
minute drivenorth of the MGM on a side street in a neighborhood with a 
lot of low income shady "motels"...you know what  i mean?

good luck, captain.

When I lived in the dorms at UCD in 1992-1993, our dorm was reall trashed
really quick.  There were roaches everywhere, there were holes in the
walls, etc.  Our building was the music, arts and crafts specialty program
and we were all really close and we all had a lot of fun no matter what.
Anyway, our building, Sereno, was lovingly called "Ghettodorm".  Don't
believe me?  Ask Joe!  Back me up here, toughguy!
:)
Long live the ghetto!!

PS:  I picked up a record by 'Ghettoelectro' on Bottom Heavy unlistened
just because the artist had 'Ghetto' in their name... turns out it's a
really cool rekkid!

Your term ghetto children is a bunch of bs.  Using your own logic or rather
explanation, I would figure that people who happen to be unfortunate enough
to live in a ghetto to exhibit the tendencies of destroying the love we all
share.

Is that what people in the ghetto do?  Destroy love?  What about the peopl
ein the ghetto who work, take care of thier kids and protect them from the
evil that MAY exist in their realm?

You see, that is what happens when you use a word, and either don;t think
before using it, or you don;t consider WHERE you're pulling the term from.

The racism?  It could go either way.  I wish people would THINK before
making up new terms.

And what does that have to do with your phraseology?  How does her  being
distrubed at certain events translate into you calling people ghetto
children.  How do you know they are from a ghetto?

Geez...this list these days has been going right into the really stinky hole=

So, a ghetto is a place where people get hurt?  I just don;t get it?  WHY
did you choose the term ghetto for a group of negative people w/o even
thinking about the larger ramifications of using such a word?  How does
your classification affect those who live in real ghettos?  Oh yeah, when
was the last time you visited, and stayed in a ghetto?  Inquiring minds
really want to know.

Huh?  Oh no, once again youtr characterizations way off.  For one, the
people on SFRaves take each of your words as your own voice and your truth.
Use your words wisely and choose them in a similar fashion.  People on this
list willt ake you to taks if they disagree.  You've got to have thought
about things well enough to defend them need be.

As for understanding, I think people understodd EXACTLY where you were
coming from.  And that is why you're getting buried in your own BS.  No
sir, on the contrary, I think people understand quite well.

A word to ya:  Think carefully before you post.

Peace,
John

And, er, who lives in these, er, bad neighborhoods?  Ghetto is a eurpean
word.  I beleive it has semitic origins.  Neils, help me out on this one
please.

And does a bad neighborhood mean all the poeple in it are bad?

Ok, here's my beef:  Why is it that peoples parents have done sucha
godawful job of expanding thier childrens horizons beyond thier gated
communities?  I remember being brought up (a long time ago, before fucking
MTV ok?) and there was this poor section of our neighborhood.  It was where
all the, er bad blacks lived.  People int he neighborhood called them boos.
Hell, I was a kid, my parent didn't raise me to be a Panther so I started
calling them that as well.  Hey after all, they dressed worse than I,
weren't the cleanest, and often wore shoes that were worn or didn't match.
They were poor people.  When my dad heard me call these folks that at the
table, he glared at me and said, in a most stern fashion "Just because they
live there doesn't mean they are any less than you.  They are people not
boos.  And oh yeah boy, do you know what that word means?" I replied "Yeah
of course dad, it's a term for those people becuase they live in that part
of the neighborhood!"  So rigtheous I.  My dad looked at me again and said
"Those people look just like you, and I would bet that they would do better
if they had the fortunes you were lucky enough to be born in.  Also son, I
can see that you need to know a word before you use it.  Boo is another
term for jigaboo son, it means nigger.  Now how do you feel?"  So righteous
no more.  I lowered my head, and my father looked at me "Never use that
word again in my presence or under any other circumstance."

You see, we often know little of what we speak, and yet have such glorious
explanation for our verbal foibles.

So I ask again, what does ghetto mean to you?

>
>i think you are the one being racist saying that only certain ethnicities
>are in the ghetto.

Nobody said that.  The only thing anyone said was that ghetto means ethnic
neighborhood.  Your OWN racist tendencies filles in the proverbial blank
with a face of your choosing.

In THIS country however, we use ghetto to signify inner cities, usually
poor, filled with people of color (oh yeah, when I use this term I mean
anyone who is not melanin challenged ;) ).  Now there are plenty of areas
where there are concentrations of poor whites.  People do not say they live
in ghettos, but I've heard whites call people white trash, or trailer
trash, and I beleive that is another form of bigotry.  But ghetto, due to
the amrican experience, brings to mind brown, yellow, and black faces.

So, what do you mean when you say ghetto or say that it's use is appropriate=
?

>Ghetto is not a term specifying any race or ethnic
>background what-so-ever, unless you are prone to belief in stereotypes.

What stereotype?  That race exists?  That people who live in inner city
'real' ghettos are people of color?  What stereotype are you talking about?
I dunno, the only stereotypes that I've been confronted with contnually are
those spouted on this list.  Almost as bad as TV at this point.

I can't beleive we're even talking about this.  It's so obvious as to defy
all logic.

I give up.  When does the next shuttle leave?

Bye,
John

And what side is that?  The right one?  The wrong one?  Thye bigoted one,
or just the racist one?  The one where you don't understand terms but use
them?  Or the one where people are enlightened and uplifted by every word?
Or is it the one that buys into the stereotypes of ignorance just so you
can point the finger and create a "them", the non-ravers w/ a negative
attitude, or "us" the REAL ravers, PLUR all the way, and non-ghetto
attitude.

I wanna know what side you're talking about.

Out,
John

Well, maybe if you looked harder you might have found a woman doctor who
may have taken a bit more care with the delivery.  But since you chose Mr.
ObGyn (WHY do men go into that science anyway?  It's not as if guys KNOW
what you're talking about when you say you feel PMS, bloating, pain, etc.),
you get what you pay for.

You must've been bron during the 60's.  They don;t do this anymore.  At

How else?  By talking to them face to face...personally, like normal

set up a meeting time.

Paul Hayden,

Ever lived in a ghetto?  Please answer publicly, so we can at least
determine the hypocrite value of your words.

So far you've been very adept at showing your racist and sexist tendencies.
Can't wait to see what else is carwling under that skin.

"Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people
who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder
and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its waters... Power
concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will."

Will start checking out the deep house scene in the following weeks . . .
Can someone on this list suggest some good places in the S.F. scene that 
caters to the thumping sounds?

Club Universe @ 177 Townsend is one right?

HOOOOOOoold on, big man!  Calm down!  Everybody just chill, ok?  He said
he didn't mean anything racist by it, and I'm willing to let that part
go.  The terminology is unfortunate, and if he's smart he'll use that
wet throbbing grey mass inside his skull to generate a less offensive
term, but violence isn't going to prove anything, y'know?

<< I think people have misunderstood understood my terminology of "Ghetto
Children". This term was created to summarize a specific type of person.
A person who comes to a party souly to destroy the love we all share. To

understand what I mean if they have experienced what I am referring
about.<<

This logic is, at best, extremely flawed and I would go so far as to say that
you are now re-defining your original definition of who you believe "Getto
Children" are. If this is your real idea of who and what constitutes a
"Getto" child, tell me how the word getto plays a role in the definition
itself. My interpretation of how you define "getto" is that you are using
that word as code for racist/ethnocentrist sentiment. Not to mention your use
of the word "Bitch" in reference to the two WOMEN who were on the phone at
the house party you attended(But it's my understanding that you'll be
schooled on that a little later too, so hang tight!).  

Phred went to great lenghts to educate us all with his earlier post so I wont
further elaborate on that subject specifically. But I would like to take this
time to address something that I feel is vital to discuss.

I am continually amazed at how people on this list refuse to believe that
issues of race/class/gender have no place on SFR, yet virtually every week,
we're dragged into this debate in some form or another. I strongly believe
that we as     
a House Nation will never truly progress as a movement until we can recognize
and overcome these basic obstacles. If not, how are we any different than
those who are on the outside, looking in, who we wish to change?  While we
preach peace, love, unity, etc., we do absolutely nothing to facilitate the
realization of these things here on this list and more importantly, in and
around the dancefloor and in our everyday lives.  And I know it's possible
too. It can be done.  Ask anyone who went to Freedom '93,  when for a few
moments, it seemed as though the whole history/future of the SF Dance scene
could have 
been destroyed within minutes, but with the love, dedication and  sense of
responsibility of the people in attendance, they turned a potentially
catastrophic event into one of the greatest triumphs I have ever personally
witnessed. Inspring moments like that are why I do what I do today.  But what
about the present? What are we doing to bring about real and positive change
so that the Kermit's of the world come to understand the concepts of basic
human understanding, concepts that are fundamental to the Dance Music
Community on the west coast? I think we have to go beyond stuff like eternal
flame wars like the one we're involved in now to find the answers.  

My last concern is list-related.  I havent been here that long, but I can't
help but think that a lot of that discussion here is totally out of line and
I beleieve something should be done about it.  I'm not saying these people
should be censored, I dont really know what I'm saying here.  People who are
admistrators on this list, Brian, etc., would it make sense to issue warnings
to people in situations like this?  Am I totally out of line here? someone
with some real experience here should respond to this.  

Respect, 
Monty

rocked.

i wish i could have stayed longer, but i was dead tired and felt a cold
coming on...

T-1000 was _killer_.

but it was _Sho's_ set that _really_ made me dance like a
maniac... that was probably the techno highlight of the last few months
for me.

Huge props to all the MAD/Madness crew for two great parties in half a
week!

Love,

brian

So, you're ghetto child if you like something.  So you're negative if you
don't agreee with King Hayden (should be Prince Hayden, Kings are a rarity,
princes are a dime a dozen), thus a ghetto child.  The logic is impeccable.

Is a house a ghetto or a neighborhood.  Please read the dictionary and go
from there.  Proper useage of words would get us a long way to
understanding what you're talking about.  The recent sewage out of your
mouth along with Mr. Kermit (I use to torture frogs when I was growing up.
I even remeber the first frog I pithed, and dissected btw) lead me to
beleive that neither of you hasd a clue.

But I could be really worng.  You and Mr. Kermit may well be from the
ghetto and if so, I need to shut my f-ing mouth.

I see.  And what exactly is a good vibe gangster called?  Just wanna know.
I figure since you've defined the negative you might be able to tell me
what the positive is.

Not according to Webster.  But in general I agree.  The relaity is this
rarely happens.  Inner city ghettos look different than Appalachian
ghettos.  In complexion as well as other attributes.

Not until you give it negative connotations or use the word to indicate
negativity toward a particular group.

So why not speak some, truth that is.  You have just redifined the word.
Congrats.  I wish I had such specialized skills in reorganizing the truth,
or at least manufacturing it.

Ghetto children = racist terminology.

Hows that for a definition.  In this case, there are racists under my
virtual bed, and I want them GONE.  Disperse evil demons:

I will sing of mercy and judgement,
Unto thee O lord will I sing.
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way.
I will walk in my house with a perfect heart,
 and set no wicked thing before my eyes.
Not even these stupid racists and sexists
 that are luring me into their rotten spell.
Ignorance can't fool me Lord, I'm not like the onther, I know
thier cowardly game.
With a fear of truth so great
they can only find strength behind thier PLUR facade.
Who so slandereth his neighbor will I cut off.
I'll cut out all right, I'll cut off, thier little minds.

But obviously several people on this list did, and they took offense at
it.  References to ghettos tacitly refer to a predominance of certain
ethnicities, and connecting those ethnicities with negative behaviour is
certainly going to offend some folk's racial sensitivities.  None of it
refers to me, being melanin-challenged myself, but it offends me just
the same on behalf of those that it would refer to.  I'm not surprised
that it caused something of an outcry, and my response was intended to
be a calm request for clarification, not an indictment.  Since Kermit
has responded since then, this issue would seem to be closed, although
now the question becomes one of finding a better term to describe a
negative and even violent influence at an otherwise peaceful event. 
This topic has come up before, and a search of the archives will reveal
discussion and suggestions on alternative terminology.

Literately yours with phat hugz,

I think you are being entirely too nice. Someone already explained the
european origins of Ghetto, which is a place where Jews were forced to
live by all those big-hearted, love-spouting, hypocritical 
do-unto-others-as-you-would-do-unto yourself Christians, and later used
by the Nazis as a convenient place to herd Jews together in poverty and
misery (after confiscating their property) for a few years before they
started deporting them to the concentration camps. Of course, Nazi's 
wouldn't have been able to perform their genocide without hundreds of
years of history and discrimination that allowed the person on the
street to start thinking of Jews as "the other" and dehumanized them to
the point where violence and repression and genocide could be justified
against them, and even codified into law and "the will of the people."

In the USA, we have a conventiently extensive culture of racism
(slavery of blacks, exploitation of Irish, Italians, Japanese, Chinese,
Native Americans) that can be plundred to allow "good hardworking
americans" to practice similar banality of evil w/o any kind of
remorse. And it clearly pervades our thinking and language when crap
like "ghetto children"  rolls off the tongues of our children so
easily, so unthinkingly.

Anyways, webster defines it as the following (i think a def. of this
was already posted in a different thread):
ghet-to n., pl. -tos  or -toes. 1. A slum section of a city occupied by a 
  minority group who live there because of social or economic pressure. 2. 
  A section or quarter in a European city to which Jews are or were 
  restricted. 3. Something that resembles the isolation or restriction of a 
  ghetto.-modifier: ghetto children.[Ital]

Basically, these (Kermit and Paul) idiots pissed me off enough that
I've added them to my mail-filter because I will feel the need to flame
them otherwise, and I have better things to do with my time, and the
readers of SFR could probably do without the negativity these creeps
are inspiring in me. So I will never see mail from anybody with PLUR in
their e-mail address, or his lamo tadpole friend. Happy, hungry,
healthy mailfilter. I gave Paul a fair chance given his hateful
rantings about homies and hoes a few months ago -- he clearly doesn't
get it and I don't need to waste valuable diskspace on his blather.

PS: it's amazing that after everybody's complaints about "gangstas"
these people needed to come up with an even more insulting description
"ghetto children" (c.f. webster's definition)... i understand where
they are coming from (w/r/t a thuggy rave w/ a bunch of people, white,
black, asian, latino, etc all acting "tough"). Thugs and disrespectful,
threatening, pushy, violent people has nothing to do with race, or even
economics, or living in the ghetto. Some perfectly evil, violent
assholes are born and raised upper middle class, or even rich. Many of
them are white and come from "good families." Their economics has less
to do with their being than the culture and the parents which created
these monsters.

This has more to do with the fact that our society is passing on it's
esteemed values of capitalism, greed, selfishness, combativeness,
materialism, contentiousness, lies, us-vs-them onto it's children. The
children have no choice and no other examples by which to live as the
partents, media, government has implicitly told them that -- pointless
turf fighting is good (vietnam, gulf war, cuba, panama), stealing from
the helpless is good (Keating, S&L loan crisis), destroying your
neighborhoods and nature for selfish gain is good (strip-mining, 
clearcutting, NAFTA, etc), and that other people don't matter as you
selfishly push your way to the top ... Is it any wonder that Johnny
ganked his classmate's new Nike sneakers when you've shown him how
you've ganked your business partners so you can afford that fancy  new
car? (and then conveniently say -- "nothing personal, it's just
business!")

Everything's personal!

Some children can rise above the lies and the sickness of what "being
American" is all about. They see through the sham of consumerism and
note that thoughtless consumption and reckless pursuit of personal
freedom only comes at the expense of others caught behind you in your
exhaust. When enough people are barreliing down the road to individual
freedom, we all end up living in everybody's exhaust, and everything
becomes a shithole. So start thinking about that before one points and
makes fun of those one or one's forebears left in the shithole. They're
fighting and pushing their way up and out just like one's forebears
did, and one may get hurt in the process, just like one might have hurt
them... it's real easy and convenient for one to talk about "stopping
the violence" when one is sitting pretty in your gated master-planned
suburban community, watching the desparate antics of the riff-raff on
"Cops" or "True Stories of the Highway Patrol"... And no, saying "there
ougtta be a law" isn't going to help the situation. It's just another
wall between you and them, and every wall eventually comes tumbling
down.

Realize we're all in this ghetto together. Better make the best of it.

Heck yeah!  They usually hop a ride in someone's backpack until they get
past security, then they jam around all night, shaking their furry butts
on top of the speakers, going for rides on the turntables, and even
chatting with the SFRavers in the chill space.  They bring the flyers
and the half-burned-up glo sticks home to me so I don't feel completely

The key is to try to respond to posts like Kermit's in a rational and calm 
way (wait a little while) and try to help him to understand why what he 
said was offensive.  I am just using Kermit as an example.

I think the main problem here is a lot of people posting without thinking 
for two seconds.  People are really not thinking about the fact that what 
they post is going to be read (maybe, if not deleted first) by 400+ 
people (most of whom they do not know) of diverse backgrounds and 
philosophies and ages.  We cannot continue to be so flippant about what 
we post to the list.  Even when we are very careful, we run the risk of 
offending someone; just think how that risk increases if we do not think 
before we post.  Everyone who has been flamed on this list knows that it 
was most likely due to the fact that they posted quickly, without 
thinking first.  People are all pretty quick to jump on the bandwagon to 
point it out, too; which is not so great either.

I am really not against new people joing our little microcosm of a list, I 
just hope that they would try to show the respect that they seem to spout 
about all the time in PLUR and in their sigs.  Learn what respect means.  
Look it up.  Think about the way they would like to be treated by others.  
Another suggestion I would give new people to the list is to read the
sfraves archives, which are located on the hyperreal web page 
(www.hyperreal.com).  They will give you a good background on the 
discussions that have come up on the list, as well as the things people 
post that tend to cause a lot of problems and misunderstandings.

Here's to increasing respect and responsibility.

By the way, that was a great post, Neils.

There was something in there that seemed original (to me) w/r/t trying to
describe the "less kind" not very "ravey" least-common-denominator type
people you expect to and often see at the larger parties: "thugs." -- This
description seems to have more of a "not nice people" feeling attached to
it than a specific race or class like some people thought "gangsters"
thought did.

What do you think?

Then again, maybe this will get me flamed? Please, be kind if you feel the
need, I am only recycling this from Neils' post. If you want to help me
filter your reply, just put "Addidas" anywhere in your subject or message
content -- it goes right to /dev/null nicely.

well, we weren't... and that's why you need to explain. We don't know you,
and we can't tell whether you're being sarcastic or serious or funny or
whatever because we can't hear the tone of your voice.

E-mail's a different form of communication, and unless you start spelling
right, forming complete sentences and thoughts, and thinking long and hard
about how people could interpret (or misinterpret) your posts, then people
are going to jump ALL OVER your (thus far) stupid messages.

 I already put in my vote for "thugs" - I don't think there are any of
the 19th century Thugees here on SFRAves who'd object!

<snip>

then why is he using the term "ghetto" in the first place???

seriously, I know from personal experience that if you're not careful what
you say on sfraves, you're going to get jumped on. (figuratively, of
course) This, IMHO, is not the fault of the jumpers but the person whose
sloppy and imprecise speech caused the problem in the first place.

Kermit's references to Ghetto Children may not have been intended as
racist, but the fact is that this society and this list equate the term
"ghetto" with very specific and very valid race issues, and Kermit was
stupid to have thrown out language like that without thinking of the
consequences of hiw words. Now, he's gettin' his and instead of opening his
mind and realizing that his choice of words may have been less than
perfect, he's just arguing and fighting more and more... sort of a sign of
immaturity if you ask me.

If he wanted to say there were bad-vibey people there, he could've just
said that without bringing some very loaded language into play.

I OBJECT!!!!

the word "thugs" contains the word "hug", thereby deprecating the
intrinsic value of the hug and disparaging huggers.  i will NOT STAND for
this kind of intolerance on MY list!!!!!!

I heard this announced on David McBernie's excellent World Music show
on KPFA (94.1) this morning.

Bally Sagoo (w/ others, including DJ Cheb I Sabbah)
Feb 27 (i think)
1015 Folsom 
Tix available at Reckless Records (SF) and somewhere else that I didn't write
info: 415 552 3778

I have Bally Sagoo's CD "rising from the east" (well, actually, I made
a digital copy on DAT before giving it as a gift to my sister) and it's
pretty cool sounding. Basically hip-hop but with East Indian influences
replacing the african-american orientation of hip hop. Some people call
this Bhangra, though I find Bally Sagoo's CD to be more hip-hop
sounding than Bhangra. THere's even an attempt at doing an
Indo-influenced House track (which is ok).

Chapati? Yeah, we pati'd all night!

How To Test For Thugs ( WARNING: Possibly Harmful To Tester!!! )

1. Approach the group of males to test for thug-ness.
2. Hug the meanest looking ( if you're a guy ) or the horniest
   looking ( if you're a gal ) - if you're a guy in drag, make
   your own choice.
3. If they just laugh and smile, then they are not thugs ( at least 
   in your case. Care to give me some make-up hints? ). 
4. If , instead, you find yourself immediatley in a veeery bad
   situation - well, I warned you, so Tough Shit (TS).

5. hug + TS = Thugs

Aw shucks, I couldn't resist this one...  According to the OED, here is
part of the etymology of 'thug':

" One of an association of professional robbers and murderers in India,
who strangled their victims;"

Does this not call our terminology into question?


(okay, okay, splitting hairs n' all... I will now return to my auto-erotic
erudition ;)

I don't remember if I'm still on Neils' kill file or not, but I have quick
question: what is Bhangra like? I've heard that it's sort of an Indian
influenced house/breakbeat, and I saw a CD at Rasputin called "non-stop
Bhangra jam" (I won't even go into why I think that title is funny as
hell... =) and I'm, y'know, curious.

	I have been folowing this thread since it began.  I also believe that these kids are 
totaly in the wrong dimension on this issue, infact it is my opinion that the redefine the 
apitamy of hipocricy.  But is it fair for us to just add all of them to the "filter" without 
giving them a chance to show us, and prove to themselves that they can grow out of their 
ignorance and learn to understand their mistakes, and use them as examples to teach others.

	If we ostrisize them and let our own frustration and outrage dictate our actions, how are 
we beter then them.  Ignorance is a wierd thing.  They show ignorance with their inexcusable 
assumptions, generalizations and prejudices with their slang and volgarity.  But we show them 
the same with our outrage and flaming, and never give them a chance to show that they can learn 
by adding them to a "filter"  It is rather arogent on our part. 

Shit roles down hill.   

We need to give everybody a chance.

Education is a more promising tool for change and positive development than a "filter"

	Lets see if they grow up, or not.  I personaly find it very ammusing.  It is incredible to 
see exactly to what extent someone with a "know it all" atitude and a low level of life 
experience will go to to prove a point.   

	It's kinda funny, but years from now, Paul and kermit and others like them will be siting 
around asking themselves "how could we have been so blatently ignorant and called ourselves 
ravers???!!??"

	Anyways, just food for thought.

Keep It Real

Ray Vonie.

I agree about the last part about positiveness from a party when fights,
stabbins and such go on right before your eyes. The thing is, even though
the EVilVibe can get to us, we as ravers must still try to bring out the
best in us..our best vibe, so that other
ravers and other people who are having bad trips from the 'fights, stabbins
and such' end up having an Ok time rather than a Shitty time...

After reading all 200+ messages about GhettoCHildren, Ravers
and such, I relalized something...

Its all about understanding. The only reason we don't like HomieG's, its
because we don't udnerstand them. Its like they have their OWN culture
(much like we ravers) and we just don't understand them. the same way they
don't understand us...

The reason I bring this up, is because at PNY, as I walked down the hallway
to
go outside after freaking out in the jungle room, this ghettoguy stops me
and asks me
if he can touch my fur coat... I said "Of course!.." and instead of just
letting him touch it, I gave him a hug...

It was a weird experience, since he didn't know what to do... and I didn't
know how he would take it. but it was all good!. He didn't say anything and
the hug didn't last very long, but after 30secs he said: "your coat is da
shit" and smiled while quickly turning his head to pretend he wasn't
looking anymore... he was with this girl, who
even though was a Ghetto type girl, she was 'dressed' up for a r ave, and
she smiled at me. so she obviously was one of those people who are there as
a link between our world and their world....

I walked back torwards them a minute later and gave them both some
Blow-Pops 
I had borrowed from Eric ;o) (thanks Eric). It was a very new experience,
yet
rewarding...

:o)

To enhance what Vertigo+APril said even more ;o) ..

The party overall was Evil and freaky, it was like being in a horror movie.
(totally, I walked down the jungle room, looking around, people passed out
on the wet dirty floor, people with their heads down (obviously having a
bad trip) no smiles, it was
a world of darkness and negativity...but outside, it was something else, it
was
like Recycling... People from inside would come for a walk outside with
frowns upn their faces, and we would make sure they had a SMILE before
going back in :o)

Maybe add some more tips :o)

If you did decide to go to a party and it turned out to be awful, don't let
it get to you... other people might be having the time of their life! in
that case,
worry more about letting them have the BEST TRIP ever... ;o) and have fun
while at it...

being Negative is contagious ;o(...

An empty warehouse
Silent but for the murmurs
of happy ravers.

I turn to the crowd
place the needle on the wax
and crank up the bass.

Explosion of sound
Lasers ripping the chill night;
the Dance has begun.

Circle dancers spin.
Glo-sticks flash sick green lightening;
music warping minds.

Music pounds their souls,
ripping frenzied screams from them,
releasing, freeing.

I slow the fever
I pull the music down now
to touch their faces

Fade in faster beats
Machine gun fire snare drum
Bursting with a BOOM

Pounding again now,
the people freak to my beats...
the trance rewards them.

Your skin is prickling
I'm prying open your mind
scooping up your thoughts

Machines without souls,
the turntables play the souls
cut into vinyl.

Years of poetry
become a single moment
of hedonism.

People come to me
Hugs, sweet acceptance and joy,
Smiles, stickers, candy.

I pour it all back,
weaving tunes for my family,
my beloved friends.

Time blows soft away
Sweat, water, wet vibrations
Blasting ocean beats...

The music flows on
A stream carrying the sun
Light flowing upward

The light returning
Ravers, like stars, disappear
Just a few remain.

Finally, no more
the music fades to grey dust
Clapping my payment

An empty warehouse
Silent but for the murmurs
of happy ravers.

Hey SDream-

That was the best thing I have heard in a long time. I am almost without words
that haiku had some much depth to it. That I think I can speak for most DJ's
and or musicains. That is the inside of our heads trying to uplift and open and
give the crowd a peak into our inner thoughts and fellings. That was great it
put a smile on this face =)

Just had to share with you and the rest of this list.

BTW, not to detract from from the controversy de jour, but did anyone
happen to pick up the San Francisco Chronicle and check out page B1? 
The headline:

	Prayer Party - Techno Mass Rocks Religious in Oakland

It pictures Ron Pilato and Lynn Stone.  Now, forgive me if my memory is
failing me, but don't we have a Lynn Stone online here?  Also, this
article seems to be about a post-denominational Rave church!  Yup,
that's right, now it's more than a music genre, it's a RELIGION!!!

The atricle is online at:

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/chronicle/article.cgi?file=MN63859.DTL&directory=/
chronicle/archive/1997/02/25

No pics, but interesting none the less. Hmmm....if raving can officially
considered a religion now aren't we protected from busts? ;^)

    ``I was born and raised a Catholic, but I don't think I'm ever
       going to find a Catholic Church where I can dance with reckless
       abandon in the middle of the mass.''
                                                    Jill Martin
my sentiments exactly.

hugs,

Terry

YES i am mentioning godawful drugs on here. 
;)
I have a little question. I have a friend, see.. and he was on 4 hits of 
E on Saturday night, and he seemed to be able to control it, except for one 
thing. 
HIS EYES KEPT ROLLING INTO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.
like, literally. he even told me a number of times, "I can't see." 
Now I know what 1-2 hits of E does to MY body but i would NEVER want to 
know 
what 4 hits would do. I don't know how it affects my friend, I can't 
feel what he's feeling,but when he's walking around, holding perfect 
conversations in this state, you would think he is ok. BUT 4 hits of E 
that's ALOT of chemicals fucking up your brain.. So here's what I'm 
trying 
to ask..
What's up with this eye-rolling thing? Is this a sign that I should 
get him some help? I was sitting there watching him going "oh shit 
he's gonna pass out".. If i had seen him from across the room I 
woulda been like "DAMN! he's still alive?" cuz all you could see most 
the time was the whites of his eyes. But, he was otherwise completely 
functional.. I hate being such a worrier, especially now. He's okay 
right now and all (i.e. not on 4 hits of E, or i should HOPE he 
isnt!), 
but 
should I have done something for him? How close is he to.. well 
passing out, or leaving us for good when his eyes roll abck like 
that? ive seen it happen before, but you shoulda seen him.. if he 
hadn't been talking and whatnot, i would have done something. but he 
seemed 
to be ok..

My really good friend had 2 seizures while on E.  I was with her one time
when it happened, and one time when she was high before she had a seizure.
I recall her eyes rolling back, although this is not a scientific proof (I
really don't want to deal with any flames for this opinion).

It scares me when I see it just because it reminds me of what might follow....
I feel the same way with heavy breathing - just doesn't look to healthy...

It appears that the phone number that was posted for the 1015 Folsom Bally Sagoo event on Thursday is actually a home phone number.. but of a very tolerant person!

He says that the doors will open at 9pm, the cover is $15, and it goes until 2.  21+ as always.  He describes Bally Sagoo as a "Punjabi DJ from England"

The correct information # is 415-789-8565.

p.s.  no, I'm not really back on SFRaves, just lurking for a day or two, and I have to say it's pretty disappointing to see the same old same old being rehashed endlessly.  Though I do miss some of you a whole lot!

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

   If I remember correctly, just a few, short months ago a flame war was
started that scared off some of the most frequent posters.  I didn't step in
until the very end, and by that time it was too late.  Before we lose
subscribers, whether they like to post or not, let's think about what we're
writing.  Not if it has anything to do with raving, but just if it is
offensive or tasteless in general.  Stating your opinion is one thing, but
flat-out insulting someone for the whole list to read is quite another.  I'm
not notorious for long posts, or even very insightful ones.  However,
something even of this size has to mean I had something important to say, so
please don't just ignore it.  I can skip over and delete negative messages
with the best of them, but if I can convince just a few people to help spread
more PLURry messages, than that will help.  Let's not let this get out of
hand, and maybe start in on some more uplifting topics.  It's not a big
problem yet, but it could become one.  Thank you for your time.

John, you are the true essence of SFRaves.
You did not read any of my email. You think I am racist and sexist.
What does race have to do with a ghetto?
My mom lives on the very border of a ghetto in SF.
She is not in it, but we know many of the people who are.
Where did you get sexist from?
I think you're funny how you and at least half of the people here on
SFRaves can twist our words around into something they are not. I have
met a lot of people here on SFRaves at raves and no matter what they say
they are are all super cool. And you probably have met me many a times.
And you should know that ravers are not racist nor sexist.
Please read it carfully and understand that most of what anyone saids on
SFRaves is in joke to poke fun at.
People here need to take some valium to settle down.
And while i wrote all of this i have been laughing and smiling.

Love.Luck.lollipops,
Paul

ghet-to   n. 1. In certain European cities, a section to which Jews were
formerly restricted.   2.  Any section of a city to which many members of

(daytime) party on march 16.  sounds like they may be doing them monthly 
now.  if you like house music, these parties are the sh*t.  see you there.

It's called nystagmus.  It's a side effect of MDMA.  Check the
Hyperreal drug archives for more side effect info and dosage warnings.
This seems like an extreme case.

And here's a nystagmus information page (not related to MDMA side
effects).

 I like goons! If you stretch it out a bit when you say it it sounds

Hi all!  ]=)


 While I have had my disagreements with John and Neils, I am very happy 
to say that I fully support their viewpoints concerning the whole "Ghetto 
Children" debacle. 

 All the posts supporting this terminology have either sounded 
defensive/hateful or goofy/drugged out. I applaud Neils and John in their

hmmm...  i will not go so far as to claim that the American Cancer Society
isn't a good cause, but, for the record...

they do tend to favor and promote _drug-therapy_ research (i.e. medical
developments that will contribute to the profits of pharmaceutical
companies) rather than _natural-prevention_ research.

now i think someone should start a chain letter to give money to the group
of professional psychaiatrists lobbying to get E and acid re-legalized for
clinical use...

flames anyone?

>From what I've heard, someone is usually one sign and not a 
combination of two signs even if you're born on a cusp. You may 
exhibit characteristics of both but will show a larger percent
of the traits of your single true sign. Your single true sign can
be determined but you must know your exact time of birth as well
as the latitude and longitude of where you were born. A good
astrologer or astrology book should then be able to determine
your true sign.

Comments "as a list administrator" will just get ignored, or "who the f---
are you to tell me what to say or not say?" contested.  I've written a
number of the folks privately recently and gotten both of those two
responses.  

Warnings are useless because I am opposed to the idea of kicking someone
off the list, since the first thing they'll want to do is resubscribe
using a different AOL screen name or whatever, which I have no way to
guard against.  

My thoughts these days have leaned towards setting up a moderated mirror
of the list and somehow hacking majordomo to allow for multiple
moderators, with safeguards against two moderators approving the same
message.  If someone knows their way around majordomo and wants to hack
that in, drop me a line.

hello everybody,

WARNING: FLAMING MATERIAL!!!

posting ten messages in a row and thirty a day to sfraves is incredibly
RUDE.  the fact that there was NOTHING worth reading in ANY of them is
beyond rude - it it immature, moronic, and asinine.  until you have
something interesting to say, please SHUT THE FUCK UP.

when i go to a party, i expect that there may be high-schoolers running
about dressed as muppets, staring vacantly around and saying "OHMYGOD,
I'm CANDYFLIPPING and you're my NEW BEST FRIEND!"  in person, this is
amusing and sometimes even endearing.  when this sort of crap arrives in
my mailbox by the dozen, demanding my TIME and ATTENTION, it is only 
infuriating.

here on sfraves, every time you post you are DEMANDING time out of the
lives of 400+ other people, who unlike you do not spend their days/daze
being bored at school.  grow up and show some consideration, even if you
apparently can't show any intelligence.

btw, your claim that your RACIST and SEXIST terminology is not so, because
you don't mean these words the way other people do, is simply stupid.
those words are abstract symbols - they only have meanings BECAUSE people 
conventionally agree on a particular meaning.  people who randomly
redefine words are babbling idiots.  think about that.

p.s.
don't bother to accuse me of reading a sentence or two of your mail and
then jumping down your back.  until now i have actually read your
blitherings, perhaps because i hoped you would reveal that this has all
been just a bad joke.

The two most commonly used ones are "filter" (part of the elm
distribution) and "procmail".  If your unix box is using Qmail instead,
qmail has its own built-in filtering mechanisms, see "man dot-qmail".

Hi all!  ]=)

 Someone just recently asked about list moderation and I just wanted to 
add a little something (I consider this rave related as it concerns this 
list).

 My very favorite aspect of SFraves is it's "seeming" chaotic structure. 
While there is a guidelines list it is cheerfully ignored by most. While 
this list is supposed to be about raves _many_ other topics (most only 
remotely related to raves) are discussed freely and somtimes for days.

 I say "seeming" as the list is like a life form in that is self-regulating. 
For me, the oppertunity to develop communication skills here is 
dreadfully appealing. And what a place it is! The diversity is sometimes 
overwhelming!! And while certain thematic "links" are formed by 
individuals with the same outlooks, it is so much fun to jump from camp 
to camp in ways that can not be done anywhere else

 I like a situation where I can fuck up badly, be called on it, with no 
damage done except to my ego (well, for the most part ;). I enjoy being 
flamed (ducking!), flaming others, supporting others and just generally 
running around here and having a good time.

 I would like to thank all of you out there who have taken the time to 
respond to any of my posts! THANKS!!! I love SFraves!!!!  =)

 I really appreciate the freedom that SFraves has given to many of us.

smiles,

Ran D.Dreams

Hey all, 

I recently piced up a pair of 1200's for a steel of a price and was 
wondering 
if I could get some recomendations on any good vinyl out.  I like funky 
basslines and hard building techno. 

I just heard a great one today called  "SASH!  Encore claire Fois"  I 
think is the trake name on an English lable Matix... something.  Ahhh I 
got to write these things down!  It's in French.  Anyways any help is 
apreciated.

PLUR,

       Austin

Well said Fred.

You're words are 100% the way I think that most people on this list feel, 
but are reluctant to post.  Unfortunately though, there are a lot of 
careless words being thrown around this list regarding the Cool World party 
as well as nearly every other topic.  I don't think that some people realize 
the depth of this list, and how many people actually read and are affected 
by their words.

As far as the changing times on this list...yes, things have changed a great 
deal.  Not only sfraves, but the entire dance music/underground rave 
culture, and it will continue to do so.  The important thing for all of us 
to do, is to take these changes in stride.  Remeber that we are not all 
alike, that there are as many differences in people as there are people 
themselves.  After all, we are all on a similar path, we are all of the same 
culture, and we are all in this together, like it or not.  We need to 
realize that what things are true for the individual, are true for the 
whole.  I cannot consider myself a truly spiritual person if I shut out 
those who are not like me.

By calling someone "Ghetto Bitch" or "Racist", one merely succumbs to the 
negative aspects of their own energy.  Someone can get their point accross 
very well without the need to use words of this severity.

Maybe Kermit's intentions were negative ones, maybe they were not, but by 
replying to his post with more negativity only contributes to that 
negativity, thus fanning the flame even more.

I do not agree with Kermit's choice of words, or attitude toward those 
"Ghetto Children" or his attitude toward  people who have replied to him.  I 
also do not agree with the attitude and choice of words of those who posted 
the replies.  However, if we are to continue with discussions like these, in 
a public forum, we each must remember to treat one another with the respect 
that we all deserve.  If someone wishes to call me or anyone else an 
asshole, fine, that's their perogative, but do it privately, don't spread 
that negativity accross a whole sfraves list that hundreds of people will 
read.

There is no peace, love, unity or respect in these types of posts.

IMHO-Thanks for listening,

Smiles,

Scott =)

p.s.-I just read a post about someone thanking someone else for being on 
"their side" in this issue.  There are no sides here, we are all on the same 
side...we are all trying to reach happiness and understanding, in whatever 
that might take.  Lets not make these things personal.

Does your mom or you live in a ghetto?  The answer is NO.  You may live
near a ghetto, everyone in Sf does.  But that is a far cry from actually
being and living in one.  My point is made....NEXT!

True.

Doubtful.

And you speak for all ravers?  When were you elected?  Ravers are
respresentative of the culture which they were sprung.  We bring our own
ideals and our own predjudices with us everywhere we go.  The challenege is
to recognize the, er, 'bad' or negative parts of our perosnality and strive
to work on them.  THis is not required for memebership in the human race,
but if we were to practice it, I beleive we would have a much more peaceful
planet.

Nope, ravers are ravers, and they may very well be sexist and or racist.
Raving cures nothing, especially social ills such as racism and sexism.  As
a matter of fact, it may certainly spawn these attitudes (look at where
women are in the scene today...second class status.  Sad but very, very,
true).

Yep.  How's that for a party.

Ok I've GOT to know:

This scene, from my totally unscientific analysis, is literally filled with
those OTHERS.  You know, Aquarians & Capricorns.  Many if not most of the
DJ's, Promoters, and personalities are this sign.  I've checked.  Now the
funny thing is I know that there are Pisces out there, after all, where
else would all the positivity come from.  Where else would the near freaky
energy come from.

the time is now my brothers and sisters to be counted.  Besides I am
curious.  E-mail me privately and let me know if you're one of us, a
Pisces.  Creative, Articulate, Loving, Fond Of Inebriation, Empathetic, and
of course Excellent Lovers (but we don;t talk about it much).  Oh yeah, did
I mention flighty (other sign characterization of us, but we know that
flexibility is a sign of an active mind!).

So stand up and be counted, besides, I wanna know!

One point.  There is usually a Pisces party thrown by Dj Buck.  I'm gonna
try to contact him and see if he has any plans for this year, now that he's
back.

Me: 3/17/xx (after all, xx marks the spot).

Pisces,
John

P.S.  I like the other signs too, but Pisces, oh my Pisces.  There is
something special about us.

Hello all you SFRavers :)!


My name is Paula.  You might have seen me here and there.  Hey, you might even
know me!  I'm the crazy one with the big ear to ear smile and gives out a whole
bunch of bracelets and candy =)!  Did I just describe about 400 people you
know?  Sorry.  

Well, I was introduced into the scene May 96', almost a year now.  But, I was
first brought to the BnB by Terry before I was acually brought to a party. 
Thanx Ter ;D!  So I met a lot of you there (I was wearing a blue alien benie).

Now that I have e-mail, I will enjoy speaking to you all, and reading many of
your postings.  So everybody take care, be happy, Keep smilinG, and lotsa
hUUUUUUUUUUUgs!

oxoxoxoxoxoxo,

Paula =7!  P.S.  I also like that, "See no evil, hear no evil, speak 
 no evil".  I don't know about dressing up like 
 monkeys part =)!  Love ya!

deep voice.  into material stuff.  friendly.  opposite side of scorpio.  
intense.  scorpio people oriented.  taurus object oriented.  

yanno.  take it or leave it.  these are verry generalized and do not 
apply to some tauruses/scorpios.  and im certainly no astrology expert.

It's on Doc Martin's CD titled "Unlock Your Mind." You can check it out on
the Moonshine Records Web site at www.moonshine.com. Be patient, I think
they have a 2400.

I know that Virgin Megastore has the CD as well. I just bought it!

Hi Everybody!  

I am Libby's Mom.  I recently attended my first rave (Euphonic Genesis in
San Jose.)  I was really impressed with how nice everybody was to me.  I
was worried some people would be put off by having parents there, but I
received lots of hugs, glitter, glowstix, and stickers to put on my face.
 Thanks to Paula for the bracelet, Sandra for the stickers, and Colleen
for loaning me her glowstick, and for everyone who gave me hugs and a
warm welcome.

I thought I wasn't going to enjoy myself, but outside of the music being
too loud, I had a good time.  (I should point out I am a musician, so
that is something for me to think the music was too loud.)   The artwork
was very good, even Libby's aluminum foil covered star.  (We aren't the
most artistic family.)

I am not a big-crowd type of person, so decided to step outside for a few
minutes to get some fresh air and give my ears a rest.  I got outside
just in time to see the cops pull up.  I thought, now wouldn't this be
something if the party got busted and I got arrested, but it turned out
to be a just noise complaint (I can understand why.)

I was happy to see there weren't  very many people stoned, not at least
while I was there.  Being in the medical profession, it makes me feel
really bad to see kids brought into the ER having bad trips, getting
sick, even dying.  There is a better way---you just have to find what
works for you.  For me it is playing music.  

Take good care of yourselves and remember there are adults who care about
and love you.  

Hugs to all of you....................Jenny  (Libby's Mom)

I'm not, thus I cannot explain.  Hey skeptic, this post was for Pisceans
only.  I have to extend myself all year long by reading the rest of the
zodiac, this is MY MONTH do you hear?!?  I will be the psychic for pisceans
only during this month, that's where all my psychic energies will be going.
You Taureans and the rest of the other 10 Zodiac signs can take a rest.
Man, not only are the rest of the signs stubborn, but oh how they love
attention.  Especially Taurus.  talk about the bully-bull-bull (Thanks
Harvey Sid Fisher).

Example:  This post.  I posted for pisceans, and what do I get, three
Taureans bucking up.  How typically Taurus.  Just wait a few months.  Then
you can push people around, in your normal everyday skeptical fashion.

Oh yeah tough guy: Many ;)'s and :)'s to ya and anyone like ya!

I don't beleive you!

Sorry to post to the list bout this but I am il desperado!

*****U2*****
**POPmart '97 World Tour**

_April 28, 1997_
_San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium_

2 FLOOR seats for sale!
(purchased through MTVs advance ticket on-sale last week so they are
GOOD seats:  direct center of stage and about 30 feet close to Bono!)

I am NOT scalping or making a profit off these:  $120 for both tix
(exactly what I paid for them)!

Please give me a reply to this address if you are interested or call
(916) 773-4117 and ask for John!

*****Do NOT miss this once in a lifetime WORLD EVENT!*****

Cheers,


John-Eric

PS -- Why am I selling them?  I am getting tix for Eugene and Seattle
which are closer to my home so easier to get to but if I don't sell them
then I guess I am going to 4 shows then!  Hee hee!

PSS -- I miss you all AMMLers ... Ilin, Ryan, Neeti, Bri your letters
are coming soon! :-D  And Todd I am sending the CD to you but I need
your addy again so I will call you today maybe! :-D

actually you cant be both. If you send me you birth data i will do your
chart on my 
computer and tell you which one you are.I would need your date of birth,
the city you were born in and the time of birth from your birth
certificate. the time
is extremely important for an accurate chart since you are on the cusp.
If
you send me a sase i will also send you a hard copy of your whole chart.
Otherwise i will just email you a few details.

that same offer applies to all other fishy ravers on the list.

see you all at Space Children this sat...i will be the guy with long hair

Kermit,
	I don't Hate you.
	I don't think anyone on this list hates you.
			Vertigo

Ps. I believe Hate is like Love.
Before you can actually Love someone, you must Love yourself first.
Same goes for Hate.

POT CLUB IN SAN JOSE
 A Cannabis Club is set to open in San Jose next month. Proponents of the 
group which
 would supply marijuana for medicinal use made the announcement before 
the City Council
 last night. The council granted Robert Niswonger a business license to 
open the club on Race
 Street near Park Avenue. Prosecutors and San Jose Police say they treat 
the club as though it
 were a pharmacy opening in midtown. The law requires customers to have a 
prescription from
 their doctors.

problem:

1.)How can I print out the gif in color 20 times

I used AltaVista, probably one of the best search engines of all time,
but I didn't have a lot of time to go through the THOUSANDS of
references to "Prodigy", most of which refered to the ISP.

Thanks for saving me a ton of time!

I feel myself easily intrigued by astrology and its characteristics. So 
for any others who may like to know more about their sign, just flip 
through what I've put together for you...


"The moon pulls the deep tides of our bodies, minds, and spirits. She is 
ever changing yet ever remaining, the reflection of our essence and 
powers, reminder of the quickening, waxing and waning of all things."

--> Essentially the zodiac is made up of a belt of stars which circle the 
earth's elliptical yearly path around the sun. "ages" are decided by the 
point where the elliptical path coincides with the vernal equinox.In 
calculating an individual astrological chart, the aspects are decided by 
positions of sun, moon, and planets as seen from earth, against the 
backdrop of the zodiacal belt of stars. The moon signs are decided by the 
moon's position on the monthly path.
 

* The Elements:

In astrology there is an elemental system of fire, air, earth, and water.

FIRE people are volatile, tempermental, aggressive
WATER people are sensitive, emotional, passive
EARTH people are solid, stable, and stubborn
AIR people are fragile, intelligent, and spacy

(Of course, consider these only basic characteristics in one sense or 
another)


* The Signs:

ARIES rules the head and is considered an intellectual, yet fiery sign. 
Aries people are often brilliant, sometimes to the point of genius. They 
are great starters or initiators of projects, but not always good at 
sustaining and completing, often relying on more earthy, stable people to 
take over, while they move on to further adventures. they are known to be 
impulsive, rebellious, aggressive, and active.

TAURUS are earthy people and are considered sturdy, practical and 
grounded. They are known to be persistent and capable, tending toward 
stubborness and materialism. taurus can however see the "spirit of the 
matter," in the sense that money is a reflection of loving abundance, or 
that practical matters can serve less visibleneeds. they can be most 
generous and loyal, providing a steadying influence to more other types.

GEMINI is a mutable air sign, ruled by Mercury, planet of movement and 
communication. gemini are head-trippers, overflowing with playful ideas 
and speedy thoughts. they can see many sides of aa question and provide a 
variety of points of view. however, this ability can take the negative 
form of con-artist in its detrimental aspects.

CANCER is a watery sign, loving and emotional. cancerians are protective 
and tender-haerted, easily concerned with the troubles of others, 
sometimes to the point of over-identification. they make great parents 
and often keep warm hearths.

LEO people are great performers and usually take the center of attention. 
all children are ruled by this fixed firey sign, as they require the 
center for their very survival. fixed fire is deep and steady warmth and 
makes leos loyal and devoted in relationships and projects. negative ego 
problems can make them obnoxiously show-offish, or repressed and shy; 
healthy egos make them good leaders and creative artists.

VIRGO are organizers of enviroments, information, etc. they can be 
extremely analytical and make good critics. a virgo keeps an efficient 
house or office, but can be picky to the point of irritation in their zeal 
to be perfect. virgos often understand the value of loving service.

LIBRA is the sign of balance and diplomacy and grace. librans always try 
to see the other person's point of view, hence are sometimes called the 
peacemakers. in detriment this can make them seem somewhat indecisive or 
two-faced, as they find themselves caught between opposing issues.

SCORPIO (this is me!) is the deepest and most passionate of signs, 
connecting with mysticism, sexuality and the secrets of life and death. 
it is symbolized by four emblems: the scorpion, serpent, eagle, and 
phoenix. each represent a stage of tranformation from the depths to the 
heights of conciosness. scorpio people are intense  and powerful, but can 
be overly tempermental and volatile if they have not tamed their egos.

SAGITTARIUS people are free-spirited, impulsive, and wise. they make 
great travelers on the inner and outer planes as free-wheeling gypsies or 
adventerous thinkers. they do not like to be tied down and sometimes are 
considered irresponsible by more committed friends, but they always bring 
a fresh and exciting air to whatever they do.

CAPRICORN are ambitious, far-seeing and great at organizing groups. They 
make good politicians and leaders, combining high ideals with step by 
step practicality. like the mountain goat which symbolizes them, they 
will acheive great heights because of their ability to climb precarious 
places with care.

AQAURIUS is often called the sign of universal brotherhood/sisterhoo. its 
native can be quite detached and are capable of an overview that gives 
them a valuable understanding of social trends. watery types may find 
them a bit dry and unemotional, but they are loyal to the truths they see.

PISCES is a mutable watery sign, and very emotional and mystical. 
pisceans are extremely sensitive and receptive, and make passionate 
lovers and parents. they are so sympathetic to others that they sometimes 
become victimized, and have to be careful to define their boundaries and 
protect themselves.


***** Happy Birthday, Everyone!!!!!!!! *****

Yes, it was, and in spite of the hellhole we turned it into physically,
the "ghettodorm" was a bunch of the most loving, caring, close-knit
communal group of folks I've ever been with (except for you wonderful 
sfravers, of course =).  As a result of this experience, though, I don't
know if I would be the right person to consult, as far as the definition
of the word ghetto is concerned.  That year, for me, connects the word
"ghetto" with a very positive (if not chaotic) experience, and I'm not
sure that's necessarily true.  But then again, it's just a word, to be
wielded however one so chooses, just another symbol for communication.
After all, interpretation of definition is part of the intrinsic beauty of
language.  Anyways, I believe I'm beginning to ramble...

Plur, (because I like the term, no matter who puts a stigma on it)-

with e being related to methamphetamine, which is water soluble, my guess
would be a maximum of 3 days until it's out of your system.  note this is
a guess.  the only drug that really stays a long time is pot (30+ days, longer
for heavy users) which is fat soluble, and stays in the fatty tissues of the
brain and body for a long time.

When I reply to someone, shouldn't it automatically go to the list, cause I

Cheer up just realize that you now free of the opression that a car
causes, not that that will fix things but you can take something bad and
look at the good parts. Did you ever concider getting a motorcycle, the're

I, as some of you know, have a book that I bring to parties for 
people to draw in, write in, and do whatever they please in. Last 
weekend, at Planet New Year's nonetheless, a person by the name of 
Chris wrote in my book (I believe he went to the college I attended 
for awhile). What he wrote struck my heart and I feel compelled to 
share it with you.. It goes something like this... 

If I were to tell you I loved you, what would you do? 
If I, 
upon the first time seeing you, said with gazing eyes, "Amazing." And 
you say "what?" and I say "You're absolutely beautiful," how would 
you feel?
Would you feel flattered, confused, frightened, loved? 
Would you embrace me? Would you trust me? Would you beleive me? Would I 
believe myself? 
Can a lone sole believe in instantaneous true passion? 
Can the entire world, or someone's entire heart change in the blink 
of an eye?
Is my need to beleive in such things tearing my insides out or 
putting them together or both?
There is a quote, by Jack Kerouac, which drives itself straight to 
the deepest point of my innards. "The attainment of enlightenment is 
to be considered neither a high state nor a low state, everybody 
equally attains it because everybody equally knows that lightening 
strikes in the blue sky."
I love you, though I hardly know you, though I've never kissed or 
embraced you. I love you because you are reading this, and hopefully 
you know what I love. You are seeing all my hopes and hearing the 
only advice I have to give, my only true wisdom.
Believe in passion, for that is all there is.

Love to you all,
Lara

I just wanted to pop in (like I haven't already been doing that enough 
this week) and clue you a little bit in on the people working hard to 
bring you Warmth.  

I'm most excited to be working with Spencer on this project.  He's the 
one that got me motivated enough to help put an ug together.  the other 
cool thing is he has skills i don't.  are you with me?  i like to spin, 
make music, and generally make people feel good by talking with them.  

but spencer, man.  this guy can decorate.  he is also dedicated to raving 
after only having been going out for less than (1 year, spence?)  He's 
doing more for the scene than most people that have been going out for 5 
years are doing.  I dunno.  I'm a pretty simple guy and that's just my 
opinion.  come see for yourself.  

If you can make it to see us, cool.  the map points going to close early, 
so if you think you want to go, get there early.  call the vm...415.339.8059
oh, and the guest dj is going to be really good, too.  he's been a friend 
of mine for a few years and i really like his style.  the music is going 
to be pretty across the board...without giving away what and when.  

anyway, off my soapbox!  gotta go...hope to see some of you there.  

love, deep

I must confess my concentration escaped me and my fingers wilst I typed 
the name "deepfrog" instead of deepfog on our warmth invitaition.  Plese 
note that 

"deepfrog" is not thus but indeed: 

deepfog.

Thank you and plese excuse my carelessness.
 
be happy and be warm

 I don't know if that "Thanks" was meant sarcastically or not, but I
took it as a challenge! ( being a hopeless web search junkie ).

1. Used Alta-Vista Advanced Search ( does boolean logic )
   http://altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=aq&what=web

2. Used the search string "Prodigy AND techno AND british"

3. On the second page of the results, found
   http://www.nerdworld.com/users/dstein/nw1093.html

4. Which had a link to:
   http://oden.rsn.hk-r.se/prodigy/   
   which is a Prodigy fan page, which is mirrored on
   http://www.sn.no/~bvs/

 .. and that guy has a sub-page of Prodigy and other music links.

I'm going and bringing along some not-usually-raving friends. I decided on
Analog for two reasons. First, there is going to be jungle. Second, my
friends really wanted to have a "massive" experience. Though there are
plenty of negative opinions about massives, I'm hoping for a positive
experience which will be more a function of our attitudes than anything
else.

It is the jungle which really attracts me even though the atmosphere may
not be as warm as say, Warmth. :)

Terrence.

I happen to have the dancing baby movie. To save bandwidth, I just ftp'd it
to the Hyperreal ftp site under /incoming. The filename is "zm135.avi".
Enjoy! Maybe someone will put a link to it on the Hyperreal Web site.

The volume of mail and  the very high fluff/content ratio on this list just
pushed me over the edge... I don't have the time or the desire to delete
100+ messages a day, so good bye everyone!

I've had some great times meeting many of you, and I know I'll keep seeing
you at parties and such. (if I go to any soon... school is really taking a
toll on my sanity =P )

anyway, take care (and watch out for viberation =)

Ok, I'm not one to review Clubs, But....


I'd have to say Wish was one of the most vibey events I've been to
during the week...

The last time was when that other German DJ was @ Mos Isley (Anyone
remember that weekly?).

Arriving @ 10-or-so I whisked myself to the first available spot'o'floor
and gruvved to Kenneth Sol's set (Hey Kenneth!).   His set was a fine
blend of housey/techno, but I really appreciated his mixing style:
Scratches, drop outs and spinbacks galore.  Very detroit - east
coast'ish.  Fell into a small Caporea(sp.) circle (Now THAT was FUN!!!)
until the security became a lil worried, and if I saw a bunch peole
kicking each other, I'd get worried too...

The Bahia ( heh, like no one has been there before) was done up in it's
nice Wishy fashion.  Red laser beaming on the mulitcoloured screen.
Blacklights giving everyone the "glow teeth" look. Nice posters hanging
around.  Crowd rainged from cubbies, regulars, ravers (see- we CAN all
get along)... Even a face or two from Cool World (Yea, I WAS there).    

I took a break unitil that famillar trance style got me back to my feet,
and was that place PACKED!!!
Hardsequencer:  Well, he DJ'ed a Mayday-type set.  Mucho breakdowns in
case the crowd couldn't handle long intense sets (Come on Germany, have
some faith in SF... There is a hardtrance scene out here too...).
Vocals, which tripped me out (only used to words with deep house or
gabber sets).  The music selection was forigen to these ears, but
delightful.  I couldn't 'go off' due to the many breakdowns tho...  =(

Had to 'bail' @ 1AM (I hate pagers) becuz of a friend in need.  So I'm
sorry that I coudn't talk to those I was supposed to talk to...  But hey
I'll be @ Wish next week (F-8 night)...

BTW: For those that were 'In the Void',  I was the bouncy guy in the
black'n'grey _PUMA #7_ tshirt w/a sweater around my waist...

Yeah, I can look and edit the header... I don't mind typing in

everyone :)

Ever lost the most important thing in your life?  Everything suddenly
changes. 

Food loses it's flavor, colors seem pale and washed out, and things that
you once viewed as relevant become insignificant. 

Somehow this list doesn't seem very important right now, so I am
unsubscribing for a while. I hope to see some of you out.

Please, if you have a loved one, make sure they know how much you care
about them. 

Without love you are nothing.

Subject: Astral Matrix, girls in cages & GEMINIS
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Astral Matrix is my favorite live act.  Some times I find live music a
little dry, ohh boy, not his.  Check out his new tape, I think it's called
Live in Toronto, it'll make you bounce around the room!

I know the post about girls dancing provacitivley has bluured out but I want
you all to know my 2 pennies worth.

Our society seems to make it very hard for a girl to be sexy without
recieving negative attention.  Even just wearing a small t shirt evokes
raunchy cat calls from guys with hmmm, perhaps a smaller brain.  So it's
nice that girls feel comforitable in our world of raves to flaunt and gyrate
to their hearts desires.  What I particuarly DON"T LIKE is the feeling of
forced sexuality I get when a promoter purposley puts girls in cages or
skimpily clad girls on stage to dance. The debate has raged on these pages
about individual peoples motivation for raving; music, friendship, drugs.
But I've never read anyone who said "I go for the free sexy stage show"
correct me if I'm wrong about that.  There is no doubt that techno(and all
the diff genres below it) is sexy music. one of my friends says if a DJ
makes her think of sex at least once, it's a good set.  But not everyone is
turned on by females, and even people who like girls aren't nescesarily
turned on by the visual of a half naked one grooving to the music.
Putting a girl in a cage to skank away is objectifying women-turning them in
to merley sex objects- I think it then makes it harder for the girls on the
dance floor to dance sexually w/o becoming the target for horny young males
- there are better ways to revere the beauty of women.  Basically I think
promoters should allow us dancers to choose ourselves what we think is sexy
and if they still feel the need to put people up on display they should
cover more of the bases, like a chip n dales style danser, a dyke danser
blah blah all the other sexual stereotype styles, instead of assuming that
we all like buxum boobsum half dreesed women!

and to the one who wrote that Geminis don't go in for astrology...You're
such a gemini!!

        True. I haven't heard of *any* cases of people losing lives,
	freedom, relationships or jobs because of coffee either.
        Could it be that it just ain't that strong a drug? Like
        it shouldn't even be considered in the same class as E
        or LSD? To me this is a no-brainer. I'd also put cigarettes
        in this category - cigarettes have definite long term
        health problems associated with their use, but short-term
        problems? Never heard of any.

> I tend to believe that caffeine and alcohol are the opiates of the masses.

        We've already thrown out caffeine (unless somebody can show me a
        "coffee casualty" somewhere) so now let's talk about alcohol.
        Alcohol should be as illegal as heroin. It definitely would be,
        if it weren't for one simple fact: it's just too damn easy to
        make it. All you have to do is take some orange or grape juice
        and leave it unrefrigerated for awhile. Fermentation is everywhere.

A semantics note:  The word "skank" is used by many of our rudeboy and
rudegirl ska-listening friends to denote the dance that they do.  When I
read the post (being a rudeboy at heart myself), I thought
"what do sleazy girls and ska have to do with one another?" Just a thought....

please, people, let's not start this one again.  the last round of religion bashing (about a year ago) left many, including me, with a very bad taste, and i really don't want to have to go through that again.

sorry for jumping the gun, i just don't want to go through the same mockery i got last year for my personal religious choice.

love to you all-

depends on how you define strong.  Caffeine and nicotine are _physically
addictive_-- after a short time taking them regularly, you NEED them in
order to feel as good as you USED to feel without them. i would call that
a short-term problem.

LSD is totally NON-physically-addictive, and one of the least
psychologically addictive substances i've ever encountered.  There are
also NO physical health risks associated with it, and the psychological
risks are virtually nil among people who are educated about the drug's
effects and risks.

Ecstasy is also not physically addictive, though i have found it to be
psychologically so.  Still, there is a big difference between physical and
psychological addiction (at least for me).  There may be some long-term
neuro-physiological ramifications of Ecstasy use, however the evidence is
not a fraction as conclusive as the evidence of the damage that nicotine
and alcohol do to body tissues.

Alcohol is not as addictive as nicotine, but Alcohol is more
incapacitating than most recreational drugs (which makes it particularly
dangerous when driving) and, unlike, pot, E, acid, shrooms, etc., alcohol
often brings out the belligerent / violent sides of people. 

When people talk about the risks and negative effects of drugs, they often
forget to compare the risks and negative effects of everyday activities.

Ever drive to work?  Better chance you'll get killed on the road than
taking E.  And you're polluting while you're at it.

Ever have sex?  I find it plenty psychologically addictive.  And god knows
what could happen to you. :)

I'm only half being tongue in cheek here.  My ability to expand my mind
with psychedelics is at least as important to me as my ability to get to
work at 60 mph.  AND i consider it less risky.

Love,

brian

        Could it be that it just ain't that strong a drug? Like
        it shouldn't even be considered in the same class as E
        or LSD? To me this is a no-brainer. I'd also put cigarettes

        We've already thrown out caffeine (unless somebody can show me a
        "coffee casualty" somewhere) so now let's talk about alcohol.
        Alcohol should be as illegal as heroin. It definitely would be,
        if it weren't for one simple fact: it's just too damn easy to
        make it. All you have to do is take some orange or grape juice
        and leave it unrefrigerated for awhile. Fermentation is =
everywhere.

> most such negative effects of drug use are directly or indirectly related
> to their illegality.

	Alcohol is legal, and many people have lost lives, freedom, 
	relationships and jobs as a direct result of using alcohol. 
	There are so many stories about this they have become cliches.

> depends on how you define strong.  Caffeine and nicotine are _physically
> addictive_-- after a short time taking them regularly, you NEED them in

	Granted, but the difference between how you feel with vs. without 
	caffeine is so minor that this doesn't become much of a problem
	for most people. Cigarettes are tougher, but still minor.

	Come on - are you *really* comparing the effects of LSD or E
	with a cup of coffee & a cigarette? Please!

> LSD is totally NON-physically-addictive, and one of the least
> psychologically addictive substances i've ever encountered.

	I disagree with your assesment of the psychological addictiveness
	of L. The intensity of the L experience makes it *very* psycho-
	logically addictive to people who are attracted to that *intensity*.
	Maybe you're not one of those people - in which case you're probably
	not doing L very often.

	Also, L does kill - the experience can detach you so far from
	reality that you do something fatal - like (cliche time) jump
	out the window because you think you can fly. Or maybe jump
	off a boat because you need to get away from the angry, 
	bad-vibey people who've been waiting too long on a cold dock
	and you're sure you can make it to shore somehow ...

> Ecstasy is also not physically addictive, though i have found it to be
> psychologically so.

	Aaah. So you're one of those who likes the warm fuzzies more
	than intense weirdness. Well, we all seem to find our favorite 
	poison...

	E is not as intense an experience as L, but it's still a hell of
	a lot more intense than caffeine or nicotine.

> Alcohol is not as addictive as nicotine ...

	Depends on what you mean. It's harder to get *physically* hooked
	on alcohol - but if you do get hooked this way the withdrawals
	are more likely to kill you than heroin withdrawals (alcohol
	is a typical barbituate in this respect). Psychologically,
	alcohol also has a strong pull for certain types of people...

> When people talk about the risks and negative effects of drugs, they often
> forget to compare the risks and negative effects of everyday activities.

	I agree. Deciding whether it's worth it to take these risks 
	is a quality of life issue, like deciding about your personal 
	relationship with cars or latex.

	I just wish people wouldn't spend so much time trying to
	decieve themselves about the very real risks. I call comparing
	E & L to caffeine & cigarettes an exercise in self-deception.

Since Gateway was supposed to be doing a "make up" party for there NYE bust and
the VM keep saying "call back" to this number and stuff and if you call the
number that  is on the flyer the number is disconnected? They are doing a party
this Sat. so My question would be are they honoring the NYE tickets at this
party? and what about if you can't make it? Like me im spinning and helping out
with a gig on this Sat. so are they going to honor my ticket at there next
event? Since they disconnected there VM number some of us are left in the dark.
They did not seem to post much about this up and coming event either, I believe
just one post I saw and they did not mention a ticket Honoring thing? I know
Gateway would not "burn" anyone but I would just like for someone to clear that
up for me, seeing how I and a whole lot of other people paid $20. So monty,
sutek, john, alex or anyone from Gateway if you could respond to me privately
or post something about this situation. And just to let anyone Know. I don't
want my money back or anthing like that I just want to party.


Peace all,

no, i'm contrasting them-- LSD and E give, granted, much stronger, but also
much more beneficial effects, without fostering dependence (at least i've
managed not to become dependent on them, which is something i couldn't say
for cigarettes).

actually-- and this is the interesting thing-- i like Acid more than E.  no
substance has ever benefitted me more than LSD. i always seem to gain
clarity and understanding from it.  and when i do take it, i go for the
weirdness-- i'm bored by low doses. however, if i take it more than a
couple times a month it loses its appeal. whereas with E, i went through a
phase of taking it more and more often, 'cuz i liked how it made me feel,
even though i wasn't really gaining anything from the drug anymore.  that's
why i find E more psychologically addictive than LSD.  but i suppose other
people might find the opposite, i don't know.

>
>        Also, L does kill - the experience can detach you so far from

if you are educated about the drug and plan your set and setting, etc.
before you take LSD, the risks are minimal. no one ever died or went crazy
taking LSD under the advice of a psychiatrist back when it was legal...
those psychiatrists didn't know anything about LSD that we don't know if we
do our research.  but people went and took LSD carelessly and fucked it up
for themselves and the responsible ones too... [Hofmann, _LSD, My Problem
Child_]

true.  i agree on the intensity point.  but i think it's their subtlety
that makes nicotine and other physically addictive drugs particularly
insidious.

i'm aware of the risks of the drugs i take, and generally play as safe as i
can.  to _me_, use of certain drugs is important.  use of others (mainly
the physically addictive ones) is scary.  i certainly advocate that
everyone become familiar with the effects and risks of a drug before
consuming it.


Love,

brian

the short-term effects aren't as overwhelmingly obvious as emphysema (sp?)
or lung cancer, but they do exist - smaller oxygen transfer capacity and 
generally shortness of breath, propensity for chest infections like
bronchitis i believe, and of course chronic anemia (iron deficiency).

smoking for a couple months might not give you cancer, but if you are and
athlete or somebody else who is very aware of your level of fitness (like
a _dancer_ maybe?) then you will notice the difference.  after all, you've
killed off all your lung cilia - how can there _not_ be a difference?

Mac-
I'd love to be able to answer your question about the Gateway NYE party, but
I think we need to clear up something. I, and many of the Dj's you mentioned
in your post are not members of Gateway. I play at Gateway events, and we
utilize the Gateway Sound behemoth on Mondays @ MAD,  but I am not in any way
one of those who are responsible for Gateway event scheduling, finances,
coordination, etc. 

I'm sure that Claire, Rob and Jon Carel would be more than happy to answer
any questions that you might have. Hope that clears things up for you a bit!

        I totally agree. Actually cigarettes seem like the stupidest            	drug around. The short term risks may be relatively low, but
	there's just no benefit at all. I feel so lucky to have been
	able to quit 14 years ago.

Last time I called the Gateway number they said they were going to do a
free make-up party for NYE as an outdoor even in Golden Gate Park.  The
date has slipped my mind.

And I think this weekend they are having a party, but it is not a make-up
for NYE (as far as I know-but I won't even be here!).

Take notice that these are only my own thoughts and observations. They are
not authorized by either gateway or pacific, nor should they been taken as
coming from any part of either gateway or pacific, nor is it fair to use
my words to set expectations - or maybe it is, I dunno. This is just what
I feel on the subject of their make up party...

	I have an idea. The next time anyone bumps into them and they are
not busying tuning their sound system, setting it up, controlling lights,
or otherwise busy, why not ask them what they want to put together as the
makeup party, what they have already tried to line up, and maybe even tell
them want will do as a makeup party. If anyone does this, I will also
advise that you do not demand to know what they are doing for you, but
instead just try and find out what their plan is and has been (there is a
big difference on the other end because one puts me, atleastm in a 
defnsive position and the latter does not seem like I am being accused 
so much).
	I know they have been trying to put together what they feel would
be a sufficient make up party for the one people paid $20 for. Maybe if
you work with them and communicate what you would like in such a make up
party, it will happen sooner... I wasn't in SF, and therefore I wasn't at
their NYE party, so I really have no reference point on the party, the
need for a makeup party and the like. I think that if they are not
approached in an accusitory way, one is more likely to get some idea to
want they want to do and have been trying to do... 

The usual disclaimers about not being a part of the promotion group apply
here; I don't own stock, I don't get a cut. I just know what level they
like to do things to, but it may be a while before they can do things to
such a level unless someone has a 3 or 4 room space to do it in (that is my 
own insight again, and not one affliated with Gateway or Pacific for 
that matter)...

Anybody want to make it readable by anonymous ftp? I don't have
an account on hyperreal, so i have no way of becoming group
"users". I very much doubt user anonymous is group users.

tonight i had dinner with an old friend from high school... i haven't
really talked to her in a couple of years.

so we were catching up on eachother's lives, and i say "i don't know if you
know anything about the rave scene..."

turns out back in 92-93 when we were juniors in highschool (back when i was
anti-drug and had never _heard_ of raves) she was driving down to SF every
weekend with her sister or her boyfriend and going to raves.

she hasn't been in a couple of years, but she expressed interest in coming
to a party sometime.

:)

love,

brian

hehe....yeah, I have my backpack....it only got stolen once, and the rest of

 Hey guys! This is probably just an innocent mistake but this kinda 
private chit-chat doesn't belong on this list, nor do most folks here 
want to deal with it.

It seems to me that Analog would be the most happening party this
weekend...but some could argue that others would be the most happening as
well. What do you consider a happening party?

Hi all!  ]=)

 Well, as a very few of you may know or have noticed, I've been stressing 
like no tommorrow lately. With good reason to be sure, however it is 
still stress.

 I just wanted to say to all of you that the best drug in the world is 
friendship! I recieved two gifts (and another on just yesterday) from two 
very different people today and aww man have I been just flying! I feel 
soooo good!  =)

 Getting some gigs in the last week or so has helped. And I think I'm 
_starting_ to learn how to be truely grateful for the blessings in my 
life (like great music and amazing people to hang with).

 Big hugs to Martin Randall, Jess Burkson and Richard Sun. Big thanks 
also to Dagny and the LightSeed crew.

 Now of course this is just a happy peak and I'll slip back to my normal 
operative mode (which would be a blessing considering how I've been 
feeling lately!). But I think I've hit another platue (sp?). And I don't 
think I could have done it without all the shit I have gone through.

love you all,


Ran D.Dreams

People -

This monday (March 3rd) it's the return of the infamous Monday Night
Dinner.  This time it will be a pot luck at Natoma on the Lake (residence
of Sarah & Steve.)  Hoping to see some familiar faces, and maybe some new
ones too, eat yummy food (vegan, vegetarian or other :), drink lots of
chai (prepared by yours truly!) and have a great evening together. 

If we can talk him into it, there may be a live performance by Saturn5,
but regardless, we're a stone's throw from MAD at the Bahia Cabana - where
many ravers wind up after a long weekend.

E-mail myself (dlowe@saturn5.com) or Sarah Aberant (sarah@saturn5.com) for
directions and for ideas on what to bring food-wise. 

Sorry to those of you who get this twice :)

<from socal-raves>

Well, I went to the Ninja Tunes tour last night in Downtown
San Diego not really knowing what to expect.  I'd heard only
good things about them, so decided to check them out.

Bottom line:  HOLY SHIT CAN THOSE KIDS SPIN!

Their mixing skills defy hyperbole.  There are four of them
altogether.  DJ Food (actual DJ name Strictly Kev), DJ Vadim,
DJ Kid Koala, and I forget the fourth guy's name unfortunately.

DJ Kid Koala stole the show.  His average record stayed on the
turntable for about 30 seconds as he mixed, scratched, and
did various other ungodly things to those records without
ever missing a beat, WITHOUT WEARING HEADPHONES!  I'm still
not exactly sure how he did what he did, I think it might
have been magic.  I talked to him after the show, and he
is the most humble guy too.  (Real name Eric, he's from
Montreal, the rest are from England).  The flame that burns
twice as brightly burns half as long, so he probably only
spun for a total of 30-40 minutes, but man, he brought
everybody in the place to their feet screaming and yelling.

My only complaint would be music selection.  _Approximate_ breakdown:
60% hip hop
30% trip hop
5% electro/old school breakbeat
5% jungle

Far too much hip hop for my tastes, but their presentation of
it was certainly as good as it gets.

If there are tickets left for the Troubadour show, buy them
and go.

in the words of the Human Torch:  FLAME ON!


1) Never heard of anyone losing their job in a caffine related situation,
eh?  Well then you must've never worked in a professional office setting.
EVERY person I have ever known that has ever fired anyone has done so
looking past the coffee cup sitting on thier desk! And I have seen plenty
of inter-office yelling matches take place after that all-important second
cup has been downed

2)  yeah, alcohol is _so_ easy to produce.  Liek dropping some seeds on
the ground and waiting for weeds to sprout up isn't?

FLAME OFF

if i maybe so bold.  

but that doesn't make us better than any of the other signs.  not at all.

in fact, it can even be a handicap.  one of the saddes things i see very 
often is a scorpio who isn't aware of their verry psychic connection. 
they usually are negative beyond belief.  watch out.  scorpios can be 
really positive or really negative.  im sure some of you have met some of 
those dark ones.  =\  but i also understand where they get trapped.  

in our physically oriented world (disgusting eating and sexual habits to 
boot), we are wired into our bodies somehow with a spirit connecting us 
to the "other side".  capricorns ( i know a lot of them, hi goat 
people!)  are usually wired up to "see" psychic energy (whatever that is) 
and scorpios sort of "feel" it.  feeling is a whole lot more intense 
than seeing.  that's why i think some scorpios have a lot of problems 
dealing and coping and end up destroying their bodies with drugs and 
alcohol, which usually have a higher tolerance to these substances.  how 
do i know all this?  experience.  i love meeting people, and i have a 
mental database.  i would never tell most of you to your face, because 
i've found that people don't like to be boxed and categorized.  

i don't know how many scorpios ive met that have said once we found out, 
they say (or I say)..."oh, no wonder!"  

anyway, off my soapbox.  it's time to hear from other scorpios, or other 
signs.  i think it's a pretty interesting discussion line, and is sort of 
rave related, because of it's spiritual nature.  

in closing, i would like to say that i believe there is a place where we 
are all pure energy and linked.  there is a place where we ALL understand 
where each other is coming from, and there is no need for discussion 
groups like SFR to grow, and drugs are not necessary for thought 
acceleration.  

there it doesn't matter what sign you are.  we're all linked.  

and theres a lot of love there.  a lot.  

love, :>

hi, i just wrote this poem and i thought i'd share it with you all. if
you don't delete this right off the back or are one of those nrr
restricting fools, then tell me what you think. 

 Stupid is the boy who forgets how simple it is to tie his 
			shoes.
	Remember the rabbits, his sister tells him.
	  But, hes to busy thinking of his toys.
	Boys and their Toys, will they ever learn?
		Learn to spell your name,
		 his teacher tells him
	        Do you know what 2+2 is?
		   Or rather 1+1?
	But, he knows its not that simple.
	     Simplicity hides himself,
	  hes quite complicated to find.
       When looking for him close your eyes.
	  Imagination is your only guide.
		   Take my hand,
		dont take my hand?
	      Theres lots of touching
		Hes a big boy now.
	        "Why are you late?"
		 "Where were you?"
		    , He asks.
		    Questions?
	    The answers already there,
		    you know it.
	    "Dont look at me that way."
	    I wont look at you at all.
		     -But one-
		     plus one
	      its not that simple.
	     He keeps telling himself

I was seriously thinking about all the way people were responding to
mean words and anything negative in any way. And i was thinking how did
all this come about and I saw that none of the negativity was there
until an advertisment about COOL WORLD's $6 make up. Then after it and
all the reviews were in about the event.
Which i think is good because when i don't go to a certain raves(whether
massive/underground/party) i wanna know how it was and about how food it
was and stuff.
We all do. right?
So right after the CW reviews people started posting sorta mean stuff.
Then it got meaner and meaner. Soon people jsut got tired about it and
stoped respoding to flames and falming people.
And I looked at all this and said? What caused all the negative posts.
What were they all getting at. What was the one unifying factor
envolving all thos negative posts? Do you know?
Yes, it was Planet New Year. And who brings you that? COOL WORLD.
So maybe there is some truth to what many people say about COOL WORLD
causing negativity among gererally happy good vibe ravers. And thats
what EVERYONE on this list is. You can't argue that point.
Well? What do you think? That's what I think.
Take a look at all the flames and negative postings. They all relate to
one thing...  COOL WORLD

Keep tha negativity and the flaming down.
We are all happy ravers in reality. Lets be the same in cyber-reality.
I am gonna be the first to start? Who will join me?

Peace.Love.Unity.Respect,
(anyone who filters those words confuses me)
Paul

Guess what???
My friend's brother (who doesn't know a thing about E or Raves and is a
total bad vibe) wants me to sell E for him at raves? I thought it was
very funny. I asked him who he was getting it from and he said. His
Connection. I asked him how much he said $5 a hit!! What a joke.
I asked him what kind of E is was and he said (get this) PURE!!!
I asked hime how did he know? He said because....
because....
because it was WHITE!!!!!
He said he was gonna give me 100 hits and I would sell it for him and
keep %50 of the profits.
I think that is the funniest thing alive.
I don't even sell cigarettes let alone Ecstacy.
Love.Luck.Lollipops,
Paul

I had the coolest ... well kinda ... dream last night.

K ... I am going to my first rave ever and for some reason it's in the
country-side ... like on someone's farm on the east coast (like the
Maryland area).  Then for some reason my (old) friend Corey is there and
he sells me 100 Ecstacy pills and a whole bunch of heroin (which is
funny cause I've never done any drugs ever in my life).  Then (in the
country still ... no party has begun I could just *sense* it was a rave
from the good vibes) I take *all* 100 Ex pills and nothing happens ...
just get a little buzz! :-)  But then all of a sudden the country turns
into an empty and dismal urban city scene ... like what SF would look
like if a nuclear bomb went off!  And then my friend Corey just goes to
sleep but now the Ex is kicking in bigtime for me and I O-D and die in
the street!  Nice dream, huh? :-)

Byeeeee!  And suck in this *drop dead gorgeous* weather we have been
having especially today!  Everyone have a grrrrrrreat time at *Warmth*
if you are going or any other raves this weekend ... I can't go :( but
oh well!  Stay safe and try not to O-D on 100 Ex pills like I did in my
dream!  Hee hee!

John-Eric :-)

I dunno if you're serious about this, but this is just too funny! I don't

For those in California who happen to have an interest in legal actions

regarding drugs, there are bills pending to change the scheduling of 
GHB

to schedule 1. There are lots of pro's and cons to the use of this

substance but I for one don't believe that this drug has near the abuse

potential of other schedule 1 (most dangerous) drugs. Schedule 1 drugs

are specifically classified as such because of their abuse potential 
and

total lack of medicinal use (oddly, Marijuana is still schedule 1).

Although there is potential for abuse, there is a wealth of positive

applications. Check out some of these sites:


http://www.ceri.com/feature.htm

http://www.erowid.com/entheogens/ghb/ghb.shtml

http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/ghb/

http://www.nepenthes.com/Drugs/GHB/


It's interesting that GHB is being targeted and to date, flunitrazepam

or Rohypnol-"roofies" which seems to be the real "date rape drug" is 
not

being attacked. I wonder if the fact that Rohypnol is made by a huge

chemical co.-Hoffman-La Roche, and GHB can be made at home has anything

to do with this.


Interesting also is the fact that LA's liberal candidate-to-be-mayor,

Tom Hayden is co-author of the bill! 


Here's info on these bills. Something that is way cool is that you can

"subscribe" to a bill and you will be e-mailed automatically when any

activity occurs:


http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/bilinfo.html


the bills are SB54 (state senate), AB6 (state assembly and identical to

SB56) and SB3 which looks identical to SB54 but who knows?


Let's do something about this now. I'll try to pass on anything I hear

to those interested. Once bad laws get passed they are a real pain in

the ass to change. MDMA has been schedule 1 for over 20 years and just

now are researchers being given a reasonable chance to prove that E has

great therapudic potential (something that shrinks knew all along) and

that it is reasonably safe. It will still be years before E will be

rescheduled if at all.


I know. I know. It sounds like BS but write or E-mail your state 
senator

and state assemblyman and ask him to look into the other positive side

of GHB. refer them to:


http://www.ceri.com/feature.htm

The facts and truth are evident. We just need to let them be known.


It's easy to find out who your politicians are too. All you need is 
your

zip code.


Go to:     http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/yourleg.html


Most of them have home pages on the net as well. Let your voices be

heard. Attached is the letter that I'm sending.

Dear Assemblyman/Senator



RE: AB 6, SB54, SB3



Please take the time to look into the positive aspects of the drug GHB
before voting. The most damage is being done by lack of knowledge and
lack of proper regulation. This drug does not belong on schedule 1
amongst dangerous drugs of zero value. 


Rohypnol or flunitrazepam is the "date rape drug" that you should be
spending your time and efforts toward rescheduling. 

see the following from the DEA:

http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/rohypnol/rohypnol.htm


As to the positive effects of GHB here's a web site to look at:

http://www.ceri.com/feature.htm


Take the time to look into this. Upon inspection you will find that there
is tremendous potential in the use of this drug as a treatment for
alcoholism, as a tool for the management of heroin addiction withdrawal,
as a sleeping aid and even possibly as a novel form of anti-depressant.
We need to get it in the hands of those who can prescribe it and not bury
it deeper in the underground. One other note to mention: GHB is not, like
Rohypnol, sold through organized drug channels (see DEA rept). In other
areas of the world, it is even sold in health food stores!



We have a serious drug problem in California today. Let's focus our
attention where it belongs:


Alcohol and tobacco abuse especially by our youth.

Methamphetamine production and abuse.

Banning truly dangerous and useless drugs like Rohypnol

Overcrowding of jails with non-violent offenders.

   

Education Education Education Education

kids must KNOW why to say NO. They don't "just say no"



I've included the most recent action taken on one of the bills, Assembly
Bill 6.

Note the reference to "rave" parties. Also note that it is being reported
as a date rape drug.

                                                         Page 1


Date of Hearing:  February 25, 1997

Counsel:          Jerome McGuire



                ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY

                    Robert M. Hertzberg, Chair


         AB 6 (Bowler) - As Introduced:  December 2, 1996



Urgency statute.  2/3 vote required.


 ISSUE:    SHOULD GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE (GHB) BE CLASSIFIED AS A  

SCHEDULE I DRUG UNDER HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION 11054,  

SUBDIVISION (E)?


 SUMMARY:  Adds gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to the list of Schedule  

I controlled depressant substances in Health and Safety Code  

Section 11054, Subdivision (e).


 EXISTING LAW: 


1) Classifies controlled substances in five schedules according to  

   their danger and potential for abuse.  Schedule I substances  

   are the most restricted and have no accepted medical use.   

   (Health and Safety Code Section 11054, Subdivision (a)-(f) -  

   Schedule I substances.)


2)  Places two depressant substances - mecloqualone and  

methoqualone - in Schedule I.  (Health and Safety Code Section  

11054, Subdivision (e).)


3)  Makes possession of a Schedule I depressant substance an  

alternate felony/misdemeanor, punishable by 16 months, 2 or 3  

years in the state prison or up to one year in the county jail;  

makes possession for sale a felony, punishable by 2, 3 or 4 years  

in state prison; and makes sale, furnishing or transportation a  

felony, punishable by 3, 4 or 5 years in state prison.  (Health  

and Safety Code Sections 11350, 11351 and 11352.)


 BACKGROUND:  


1)   Author's Statement.  According to the author:

   

       "AB 6 will add the new 'designer drug' Gamma Hydroxy  

       Butyrate (GHB) to California's list of controlled  

       substances.


       As was the case last session, with the 'date rape drug'  

       Rohypnol, GHB is not currently recognized by California law  

       and is therefore not illegal to possess or use.  AB 6 seeks  

       to rectify this situation and list GHB as a 'Schedule 1'  

       controlled substance, thus allowing law enforcement to  

       prosecute individuals for possession and use.


       <color><param>0000,0000,8080</param>Like Rohypnol, the growth in
the use of GHB has been  

       astronomical.  The drug has been linked to a number of  

       deaths, and the stories of young people overdosing on the  

       drug have been spreading across the state and country.  In  

       addition to the great dangers associated with personal use  

       of the drug, GHB has also been linked to a number of 

       sexual assaults, and is being used in a manner similar to  

       Rohypnol."

</color>

2)   Development and Original Medical Use.  Gamma-hydroxybutyrate  

(GHB) is a substance which naturally occurs in the body.  As such,  

GHB cannot be a patented substance.  GHB appears to act as a  

neurotransmitter in the brain.  GHB was synthesized in 1960 and  

developed for use as as an anesthetic.  GHB fell into disfavor as  

an anesthetic in England because it lacks analgesic - pain  

relieving - properties.  However, it appears that GHB is still  

used in Europe as a surgical anesthetic.  In its synthesized form,  

GHB is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. 
<color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>While GHB is  

not produced by any major pharmaceutical companies in the United  

States, GHB is legally available in the United States for the  

experimental treatment of narcolepsy, a sleeping disorder.  It is  

also used in the treatment of heroin addition, alcoholism, and  

other conditions.

</color>

3)  Reported Recreational Use and Effects.  In California, GHB is  

   produced in non-legitimate laboratories and is usually  

   distributed as a liquid, diluted with water.  Users of GHB  

   often mix the drug with alcohol and take it combination with  

   other drugs.  <color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>GHB has reportedly
become popular at "rave"  

   parties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. 

</color>

   The intended effect for recreational users of the drug is an  

   intense, euphoric "high" of about two-hours' duration which  

   includes the lowering of sexual inhibitions.  The drug  

   typically induces sedation and sleep after the "high".  Side  

   effects include nausea, respiratory depression and arrest, coma  

   and seizures.  


<color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>4)  Medical and Agency Reports. 
Hospitals and poison control  

   centers have reported an increase in overdoses on GHB.  Deaths  

   have been attributed to the use of the drug.  However, a  

   warning about GHB written by the Federal Food and Drug  

   Administration (FDA) in the April 1991  Journal of the  American  

   Medical  Association stated that no deaths from the use of the  

   drug had been reported.  In December 1996, Federal Drug  

   Enforcement Administration reported that at least three deaths  

   had been associated with GHB use, although GHB could not be  

   considered the sole cause of these deaths, especially  

   considering that the combined use of alcohol and GHB produces a  

   more pronounced CNS depressant effect.

</color>

5)   Schedule Classification Issue.  Because it appears that there  

may be legitimate medical uses for GBH, the issue is raised  

whether the drug should be classified under Schedules II, III, or  

IV so that physicians may prescribe GHB under regulated  

procedures.



 ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT:  None on file


 ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION:  The California Attorneys for Criminal  

Justice state,

"Using criminal penalties as a means to stop drug abuse is a  

strategy that has been tried and that has failed.  Rather than  

further extending the reach of our criminal laws, with little or  

no benefit to to public safety and at great expense to the state,  

we should be looking towards other ways to stop the abuse of drugs  

- offering treatment programs to those who want help, for example.  

 Adding one more substance to the long list of those the  

possession or use of which can land people in jail or prison will  

do nothing to make Californians safer and will eat up state  

resources better used otherwise."

I totally agree! Why do some of you feel the need to send 6-7 (2) line 
messages to the entire list...DAILY!  I love SFRaves but lately it's 
really been a burden.  I don't mean to stifle creativity in any way.  
That's truly not my intent. I'm just asking for a little self restraint 
for the benefit of myself and others like me.

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Yes, I have said it and agree still. I also think people should cut down on
using the  "CC:" to SFRaves also. Some of these post that show up should
really be just sent to the originator, and not the whole list.

Yup! Many props to Deepfog for Love-o-Matic! I hope I can make it to
warmth. I wanna meet the rest of you DJs that'll be spinning there. Aren't
almost all the DJs from the list?

If I show up, I'll be wearing a brown "M&M (medical marijuana)" shirt. If
you see me there, say "HIGH! Do you wANna smoke a bowl?" And I'll probably
say "Hell Yes! Let's go to the chill room" and you'll say, "Cool!" and then
we'll get DANKtified! Sorry to all of you for the Drug Related Content, but
I'm a pothead and I can't help it (and I don't want to either)!

BY DESIGN
Baby's Night Out
With Blankies, Pacifiers and Hello Kitty Paraphernalia, Ravers Are 
Turning Dance Floors Into Playpens

By MARK EHRMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

Los Angeles Times   Thursday January 2, 1997
Home Edition
Life & Style, Page 2


Never mind the high-decibel techno music pounding away at 120 beats per 
second or the trippy, continually morphing fractal graphics projected 
onto giant screens or even the late hour. When it comes to how people 
dress for raves, they might as well be heading to "Romper Room."

   Lining up outside a "map point" recently (a location where ravers 
receive tickets and directions to underground raves), hundreds of girls 
with their hair in pigtails wait alongside guys with hands encased in 
puffy white Mickey Mouse gloves. Over at Magic Wednesdays--a weekly club 
based in the World in Hollywood that serves up rave music and ambience on 
a weekly basis--glo-stick-waving late-teen and twentysomethings gyrate on 
the dance floor decked out in candy-colored outfits, Dr. Seuss hats, Bert 
and Ernie backpacks, Hello Kitty paraphernalia and whistles. And just 
about everybody has a pacifier dangling from the neck on a string of 
plastic beads--when they're not sucking on it, that is. For most 
scenesters, retro-fashion may be the ultimate in regression, but ravers 
have gone beyond that. Way beyond. Over the years, raves may have grown 
and gone suburban, but the clothes have never left the crib. In these 
multimedia fantasy lands, baby wear rules.

   "When you were young, didn't you used to play with toys?" asks 
21-year-old Justin Pitter, who goes by the nom-de-rave Kryolon. Pitter 
has shown up at Magic Wednesdays (he also hits about two full-blown raves 
a week) sporting a Superman shirt and pants, a pacifier and a transparent 
plastic backpack with a can of Play-Doh hanging from the zipper and 
plenty of toys inside. "When you got older, your parents told you not to 
do that anymore. Now that we're grown up, why not go out and act like 
kids? It's colorful and it's happy and it's all about having a good time."

   "I'd say the kiddie crowd is the most visible crowd within the 
ravers," says Ken Lawrence of Pure Acid, a company that operates 
concession booths at raves and at clubs such as Magic Wednesdays.

   Pure Acid offers ravers not only CDs of popular DJ mixes, but 
pacifiers, whistles, toys, beads and the No. 1 rave refreshment, Charms 
Blow-Pops. "Raves and clubs like this pretty much give you an excuse to 
act more childlike than you usually do--all without hurting anybody. So 
people like to dress up like cartoon characters to add to the silly 
environment. It's a synergy of everybody coming together and making a 
strange environment. It makes it more fun."

   While that may be valid, it's also true that the pacifier--the most 
ubiquitous rave accessory and the item that probably served as the 
genesis for the baby wear craze--sometimes has a more practical purpose: 
It keeps ravers from grinding their teeth while high on the scene's drug 
of choice, Ecstasy.

   Pitter and his club companion, 22-year-old Aimee Macabeo, a.k.a. Star, 
say they never ingest anything more potent than water. But many other 
ravers privately admit the pacifier's ties to Ecstasy, although many also 
add that it has evolved away from its drug roots into a cute fashion 
accessory.

   "The whole scene is based on drugs," says Atousa, a veteran L.A. raver 
and designer of the clothing line A Liquid Affair. "But it's gone totally 
mainstream. It's a whole lifestyle for these kids now. You'll see kids 
sitting on the floor and they're playing with dolls and eating candy and 
you think you're back in kindergarten. I've even seen kids carrying
blankies."

   Atousa cruises the scene looking for inspiration for her designs. For 
instance, she recently created an opalescent jacket with a fur collar and 
hood. The effect, she says, "is to make you look like Snow Bunny."

   Nowadays, stores such as Ministry of Aesthetics, Pasty and Ultramarket 
sell rave wear by such designers as A Liquid Affair and carry plastic 
toys and trinkets, many with cartoon motifs imported from the capital of 
cute, Japan. Still, putting together a baby wear ensemble seldom 
translates into one-stop retail shopping. With raves typically costing 
about $20 a head, high-ticket clothing is rarely an option. So many 
ravers sew their own.

   "It's cheaper and you have the freedom to do anything you want," 
Pitter says. He and Macabeo, he says, often spend afternoons in the 
garment district hunting down fabrics to stitch into pants, shirts or 
dresses on their home sewing machines. Macabeo adds that only one brand 
inspires her to pay mall prices: the Hello Kitty stuff sold in such 
stores as San Rio Gift Gate in the Beverly Center. "I can't help it," she 
says. "I love Hello Kitty."

   *

   Those without design skills usually hit the thrift stores. While much 
of the vintage clothing in adult sizes has long since left the Salvation 
Army for the pricey racks of Melrose Avenue, such in-demand baby labels 
as Playskool and Sesame Street remain.

   "I put this whole thing together for less than $10," brags 19-year-old 
raver Theresa Lee, who hits about a rave a week draped in a plastic 
Minnie Mouse raincoat with plastic daisies in her hair, a Sesame Street 
pack on her back, toy watch on her wrist and, of course, a pacifier not 
far from her mouth.

   And, often you can find the best and funnest stuff without even 
leaving the house.

   "I would separate and save stuff that I loved even while I was a kid, 
so I still have it," says Macabeo as she prepares her wardrobe for the 
upcoming weekend's raves. "People would always tell me, 'Oh, grow up.' 
But I never really did."

Sorry to waste bandwith but....

Yesterday's BSP for _New Hope_  listed deepfog as Environment Awareness.
 This is a typographical error (Man, I always wanted to type a 13-letter
word on this list!!!).   The actual affilation is Aware Envrionments.

Rebel Alliance Sound apoligises for any confusion / inconvience....

>Wow you're cool John S. Lee

What were you trying to accomplish?  Trying to get me angry?  Trying to see
if I'd respond negatively to such a post?  Why would I ever want to bolster
such an assumption?

>What rave are ya going to this weekend. I am going to Basics maybe but
>still i haven't decided.

I don't rave.  But Basics has always been a good party.  Have a good time.

>Maybe you and I can go sticker shoping or get glowsticks sometime.

Naw, gave up sticker, glowstick, and lollipop shopping for lent.  Now
shopping ofr a nice 9mm is my spot these days.  Looking for some hollow
point shells.  Also want to learn the fine art of packing my own ammo.
Interested?

>That would be fun.

Fun can often be had by one.  Have fun Paul.  Oh yeah, thanks for the
invite, but I'm very busy this weekend.  But maybe next weekend we can get
together and play a little game of tolchucks and knives right in golden
gate park.  Now that's better than anything Martin could whip up.

>Love.Luck.Lollipops,

Love is a drug,

If any of you guys have taken GHB, would you please post you personal
experiences/opinions of it.....

Also, how readily available is it?  Was is it's legal status?
I know in England you can buy it over the counter at many pornography shops....

anyway...I am very curious and any responses would be appreciated...

thanks...

stick around and you'll see that cool world is not the cause of flaming and
negativity.  it's the people, not the party.  we all choose how we want to
respond to something.  if you respond negatively to some thing and share
your emotions then you too become a source of negativity.  check the source.

still hear, jen

I completely agree.  I hold no malice towards the production entity known
as coolworld.  *People* make the party - if we have a problem with
massives, or bad vibe, it's the audience, not the promoters who are really
the source.  Same thing with negative posts... there's just no excuse for
throwing bad vibe over a third party (pun).. you can't blame them, we can
only blame ourselves.  I personally think the attendence of massives
includes a dark element that is certainly an issue to be aware of or maybe
even complain about, but I'll tell you I certainly had a good time at
almost every massive I've gone to because I love the music, and I love the
people I'm there with, and to me that's all that matters.  Max

Sorry to waste bandwidth guys, but I do want to clarify that I understand
the difference between close raves with ravers, and massives with club
kids and "gangsters" etc...  In my post I was really just talking about
massives.
plur,
Max

Here's another haiku:

candy ravers???  blech!
who let these kiddies in here?
trance is for grown-ups.


Much love to the lurkers, and SOME of you more vocal folks :)  :) !
I'm not bitter, no, but I am:  outta here.

Whoa, wait a minute, listen to what you are saying...man I have to
*strongly* disagree with you.  The promoters of a party have a *lot* to do
with the vibe.  The party/rave/event/gala/whatever starts the moment the
idea was sparked in the promoters/organizers head.  The vibe starts right
there.  End of story.  If someone comes up with an idea, hey lets throw
this party we can make bank, I can tell you a little bit about what the
vibe might be like.  I don't care who shows up to the party, I can still
tell you what kind of vibe will be around the whole night.

If, I, as a particpant in planning parties thought that I didn't have
anything to do with the vibe, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.  I have a
lot to do with the vibe that is set at parties I help with, that's why I'm
there.

I gotta agree to some degree with Paul on this one.  Reading that article I
was taken WAAAAAY back to when this stuff was just getting in the public
eye.  LA has it when it comes to rave fashion.  I remember the first cat in
the hat hat I saw, of course it was in LA.  Damn those kids could dress.

Yeah there was other fashions too, but the cartoon cahracter element was
the most fun part.  Seeing what people has put together, and they were
perfectly comfortable wering the stuff as everyday too.  Kinda cool IMO.

Now I ain't goin' to no candy rave, but I think the idea is cool.  And it's
cool that that element is surviving.  Sf gave up alot of the costumes
really quick, it's good too see that vibe still exists somewhere.  And that
people are still into that elment of dance.

There are few things better than getting completely out of your head
(flipping was my spot) and watching a living, breathing, organic cartoon
character dancing to beats.  Then again I do miss my bra-booty-betty's,
damn that shit was D_O_P_E!  More bounce to the ounce...those were the
days....

See y'all later...the weekend is nigh, and I got my original candy raver
for the weekend (my son).  Although he hates dance music, he's into hip-hop
& jungle.  He ain't 'bout no house...yet that is.

Out,
John

Subject: SFRaves, PLUR or .... (very long)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hey everybody!

Long time, no post, but I am sure this one will make up for it :).

	As many of you noticed, last few weeks SFR has been *different*...
I have been on the list for a year now, which is not that long, but I feel
like the list has lost a lot of it's appeal.  More than once in last few
weeks I thought about leaving the list, because I wouldn't have to deal
with unnecessary flaming, stupid posts, and basically 90% of the posts I
have to read every day that don't bring anything to my life (except
headache).  The reason I stayed is because I've meet some wonderful people
through this list (Leslie, Tim K., Nancy, Kirsten, Noah, Micron, Terry,
Patrick, Andy W., - to name the few I consider great people, and whom I
have met because of the list), and I would feel like maybe I would be
missing the opportunity to meet great people without being the part of the
list.  Maybe, I would also meet these people at parties, because we were
meant to run into each other at one point or another, but the list gave me
the opportunity to speed up this process.

	I also like finding out what different people did over the weekend,
their rave experiences, their views on issues that are related to the
community we share; somebody's first rave, and the thrill that goes with
it....  Sometimes I like reading *intelligent* flames (John S. Lee,
BlackAdder and Niels, Leslie etc.).  Cute, sappy posts :) about people
falling in love at a rave etc. can be fun as well.  But lately, it seems
like most of this charm has disappeared and people are just their to post
unnecessary posts most of the time, try to preach 'how to be a raver',
flame others in a bad way etc.

	Here is where my PLUR section begins.  PLUR is starting to be a
very meaningless word, and more I stay on the list, the word irritates me
more and more.  I am sure many of you heard the saying "A dog that barks
doesn't bite."  In many cases I have seen, people who *preach* PLUR, only
know the words it stands for, but they are so far from understanding the
meaning of some of those words.  Many of the examples are on the list.  The
once I have noticed:
Is it respectful?
- to call people names
- to try to find something in somebody's post, so FLAME can begin
- to post 10 meaningless messages a day
- to tell people what "real raver does" and if you don't do it you can't be
a "raver"
- to tell people which drugs are good and which are bad, and if you do bad
drugs they don't want to hang out with you
- to have no understanding of what others do, even after they try to explain it

	Anyway - these are few things I have noticed, and rarely I find
people who preach PLUR to follow it in real life as well.  So, I rather
find out what people are like, and start liking them for their qualities,
than for their loudness about PLUR and PLURiness they have.

	My thoughts on this subject - if you have any constructive input, I
would be more than interested in it - if not, please don't post stupid
things (flames for the sake of it) - we have enough of them as it is (you
can send them to me if you really need to).

*B*

P.S. see some of you at "Warmth"

Hi...uh....
Does anyone know if there are any jungle/breakbeat-esque bands who record or
perform with live drummers?  Not just percussion accompaniment, but real kit
drums as the main rhythm section. 
                                                                            
            I'm a drummer in a band that plays:
psychedelic-droney-triphop-surf-acid-noise-jazz-downbeat-guitar-bass-n-drum
=) like music.  I'm starting to sneak in jungle and breakbeats when I can,
and I would really like to hear if anyone else has tried this with a real
drummer.  So! If anyone could point me in the direction of some bands, other
than Tortoise, that are maybe doing something similar....that would be cool...

PS the Platinum Breakz compilation is too cool.....

This Saturday Gateway Systems invites you to SHINE with James Dee,
Ethan, Darin Marshall, Sutekh and John Carel.  Float on an ambient cloud
while groovin to Joe Rice, Consciousness Lab, Claire, and Rich.  Free
breakfast will be served in the A.M.  Feel free to bring didgeridoos,
drums, altar art or contibutions.  Tarot card readings, smoothies, and
food will also be present. Tickets will be on sale at a map point in SF
that night. 
For info. please call 415.536.9453.  Thank you....    Feel it-Love.


 For those who have tickets from New Years...
SHINE is not the make up party for the Gateway/Pacific New Years.
Together, Gateway and Pacific Sound Systems are currently working on
obtaining permits from the city of SF for a daytime festival in the
bandshell in Golden Gate park for a Saturday in April.  We will be
flying in live acts/DJ's tba, also performance art groups, and providing
free food and beverages.  We apologize for not being able to create a
make-up event sooner and appreciate your support and understanding.  The
co-production on New Years was our most elaborate and beautiful
production. We obtained all the insurance, space contracts, security,
etc. the city required and were denied permits a week before the event. 
The cities reason being "There are not enough police officers available
for the event." With all other city perameters met, we perhaps
mistakenly, decided to continue.  All of us with Gateway and Pacific put
in all our energy, time, money and resources to create a magical night
which sadly many of you of never got to experience.  Our intention is to
create a magical outdoor festival (with permits) to bring in a new
season and some new sounds. If you are dissappointed, angry, happy,
supportive or just want to give us some imput (please) direct it to this
e-mail address or leave a message at 415.536.9453 or the Sunset vm. Have
a positive weekend...

Hello, all you sweet SFRavers (and some pleasantly not-so-sweet).

Branka's wonderful post has prompted me to post as well.

Many of you know me, and many don't, since I've been off the list for a couple of months due to other time commitments. Last Monday, I subbed again just to see what was up. I was planning to unsub quietly again, but (are you surprised?) I would like to share some thoughts first.

SFRaves is different things to different people.   Young, old, different backgrounds, different perspectives. That's part of the pleasure and wonder of this list, that a diverse group of people can come together because we share something in common.. we love to dance all night.  We love the music and the scene.  The list has had its ups and downs, but has held together because of the common thread.

But, as Phred pointed out recently, it is a fragile thing.  And there are a few things that can poison it easily.  If you are committed to being a part of keeping this virtual "community" alive, there are some things you *must* remember.

1.  You're talking to REAL PEOPLE here!  This is more than just an internet group.  Most of the people on this list personally know at least a few others, and many of us have met *many* others.  That's because what holds us together is dancing together.... this is not an abstract, intellectual discussion group of faceless people, folks... this is the online connection to many people who you see every week out dancing.  Remember that.  There are faces attached to these (usually amazingly creative) email addies.  Meet as many as you can!

2.  WALK the WALK.  One of the premises of the rave scene is that, through dance and music, we can connect and transcend in new ways.  If you want to be part of the future, act it.  If you want to change the world, it has to start with you. That means becoming consciously aware of who you are and how your actions affect others.   You want to make the world a better place (and hopefully everyone does) ... then be a better person.  Let us set the example, which sometimes means catching ourselves in inappropriate behavior and *changing it*!

3.  THINK before you SPEAK.  Write your message, read it, read it again, and edit it, and do it again before you send it!  It's challenging to communicate in writing as clearly as you might in person, but learn to do it.  Half the problems on the list come from people misunderstanding other's intentions.... and that's usually because the messages were poorly thought through in the first place.  If you have something to say, it should be worth the time to compose your post so the reader will understand.  And personally, I think profanity is rarely appropriate.

4.  Be NICE.  How simple is that?  You don't have to like people, but treating people with respect is required if you want the same in return.

5.  Be HUMBLE.  I know sometimes we all think we have the magic answer and know the only way things should be, but that's not likely now, is it?   The arrogance of youth and the cynicism of age are the two most poisonous ingredients on this list... and both would probably be softened quite a bit if people took a minute to realize they don't know everything, and that other people see the world in a different way.  

5.  Don't fight in PUBLIC.  Personal arguments belong private.  Never cc your flame to the list.  We don't want to know.

6.  SPEAK UP, YOU LURKERS!   There are 450+ people on this list, and I know for a fact many of you silent ones have thoughtful and interesting things to say.  Please don't let the bullies scare you off, cuz this is your list too.

7.  Use your HEAD.  Don't post about illegal activities.  That's stupid.  You want information, fine, but avoid talking about personal actions that may reflect on you and the others around you in a negative way.  This is a PUBLIC forum.

8.  Wear more HATS!  OK, that's optional.  But always way more fun!   I'm feeling much more like myself lately, so it's probably time to pull out a crazy headpiece tomorrow night for Warmth.  Special hugs for all other hat-wearers!

I hope to see many of you out, and encourage you go come introduce yourselves to me if we haven't met.   And you better all be coming to the campout, hear?!?!?

Much love,

I have been a raver for 5 or 6 years now and have often had to face
the possibility of burnout.  I am wondering how other people manage to
stay enthused with raving while others move on to other things(not
that that's necessarily bad).  One thing I like to do is have a unique
"theme" to meditate on while dancing at each party. When my mind
wanders I return to my "theme" in an attempt to gain insight into the
subject.  Here are some of the things I have thought of:

Helping out or putting on your own parties.  Very fun but it carries
its own burnout/disillusionment factor.

Traveling to other areas.  I have traveled around N. America and
England but don't have the resources to do so right now.  The recent
descriptions of LA sound enticing, however.

Trying out new scenes.  Been to a jungle or goa party?

Does anyone have any other suggestions?

Greetings all,
I don't suppose there are any Sacramento-area ravers heading out to SF
Sat. night?  (I'm in Davis <*sigh*>.)  My ride will be skipping out on me,
and I really gotta' get some groovin' on.  I was looking at either
Analog or Warmth (I figured that I'd leave the massive/ug decision in
the hands of fate).  I'll pay all your gas if you want; right now I'm
just dying to meet more ravers, dance to some rad tunez (my own
collection's pretty weak) and share the vibe with you lovable folx!
If you can help me out, reply (privately, of course) or give me a buzz
whenever, thanx soo much!  Much love,/\/\/\/

Since I am broke and only have 3 bucks to my name I am going to go to a
High School Dance. I am going (mildly) raved out. Bell botoms, ringer
shirt, small backpack, bracelts, necklaces, whistles glasses,
glowsticks.
Wish me luck, I just may be the only raver there.
Hey I know what yer thinking! :)
But I am bored and my rave buddy is sick so. I am going to go circle
dance at my school.
Maybe i will bring a mixed tape to the DJ the school hired.
Who knows turn my school dance into a rave.
Love.Luck.Lollipops,
Paul

Hi.  Sorry to do this, but I don't know how else to do it.

About 4-5 years ago I was in Amsterdam & met this kid named Jesse Collins,
who was touring Europe.   I'm pretty sure he was from Santa Cruz.   I
haven't seen him since, but we hung out there and became pretty good
friends.   I moved out to California 3 years ago and have been on & off
trying to locate Jesse, but haven't been able to .  I reckon he's about 26
or so now; and I don't know if he's still in Santa Cruz.  Any info would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

b))merang

I know how u feel.  I've unsubscribed on and off during the last few months.
I've also known others who have done the same.  I seem to can't help coming 
back.  I don't go out as much anymore and have difficulty keeping up with the
high volume posts.  But I still seem to come back.  I find that I'm deleting
alot more these days, but here I am.
I still get facinated with some of the communication that goes on here.  Lurking 
on sfraves when I can, helps me stay connected to a "scene" that has given me
so much.
I'm not sure exactly why I decided to come out of lurk mode.  Maybe its because I 
relate to your post, and appreciate your willingness to express these feelings and
continue to be a part of the list and make an effort to keep sfraves as something
u find to be special.
For me I have to say that I appreciate (not as often as I use to) the feelings I get
from what I am able to see in others here and when I go out, the love for the music, 
that brings us together.  I love the high I feel, from that sense of sharing the music
with myself enjoying the feelings that I get to experience from it.  I love the high
I feel when I am able to sense  the sharing of the love of the music that brings us
all together.  I like being able to see this in our words, how we dance together, and
just seeing the expressions on peoples faces.  
I also really appreciate the differences that people are able to express, and see 
how many of us can enjoy and struggle with some of our differences.  
They always seem to be more tolerable and more beautiful when I can be in tune
with the "vibe".  
Sometimes the "vibe" is more obvious to me than other times, but I think it always
exists.  When we are sharing the vibe, we can share so much.

I hope I didn't ramble on for too much.  I guess I'm just feeling a little sentimental
about our list along with some mixed feelings.  Thank you to all of u who help keep
the vibe alive here on sfraves, by your expressions and relativity to raving.

:)

If a company is interested in me I ask them if they do drug testing.  If
they answer "yes" I will not take the job.  If more people did this, then
this unconstitutional, insulting, and highly offensive invasion of our
rights might stop.

Think about it: do you want to be working for a place where people think
drug testing is a good idea?

Note: I don't even drink alcohol, so I have no problem with passing.  I
have a moral objection to it.

Actually, scientific research has shown that caffeine *decreases* one's
ability to perform memorization and other mental tasks.  Adequate sleep,
good food, good vitamin/amino/herbal supplements, and daily exercise works
so much better than pounding Mountain Dew used to (I drank several cans a
day in college).

I have found that riding my bicycle to work is a _much_ better wakeup call,
doesn't tear up your stomach, and saves going to the health club (how many
people do you see _driving_ to a health club where they proceed to sit on
the stationary cycle for half an hour?)  Not to mention getting me in shape
to bounce around to drum and bass for hours.

Sorry if this seems self-righteous but it really does work for me.

Okay this is how the dance was you guys and this is vrey scary.
First I will list the bad aspects

BAD STUFF
---------------
*Music was same as radio
*DJ never mixed anything. He just let it play
*The (wanna be) house music sets were only 5 minutes long.
*I was the only raver there (scary)
*People were doing a lot of freaking
*People were drunk
*It cost $5

GOOD STUFF
----------------
* Vibes. Surprisingly enough the vibes were quite qood.
* I got props for dancing (like I care)
* No guys tried to start shit.
* Gangster guys and Jocks actually asked to borrow some of my neckalces
for times. ??????
* Everyone liked my clothes.
* I could breath properly

INTERSTING THINGS
---------------
* The DJ had wonderful equipment. Tecnics 1200.
* They would clap like they do at raves.
* Some other peole had whistles ???? They were off by far though
* I asked th DJ to play some house and he played some Prodigy!!

OVERALL
---------------
Overall I would say that i had more fun in that 1 hour than i had at a
lot of massives. That's a scary thought. When HS Dances become more fun
than raves that saids something bad for raves. It really concerns me
too. Thats's waht is very scary to me. Many rave promoters could learn
from my school about throwing a rave with a good vibe.

Love.Luck.Lollipops,
Paul
P.S. And yes I am still a raver. I am not a HS Dancer now :)

Hi all!  ]=)

 Wow! There is sure a lot of you folks!

 Anyway, I have been/am writing a play. It is based on a Greek tragedy, 
The Bakkhai by Euripedes. It (The Bakkhai) tells of the invasion of the 
City of Thebes by a Dionysian cult. The king of Thebes doesn't realise he 
is dealing with the god himself (Dionysus) and eventually dies (a Greek 
tragedy is distinguished by the death of an aristocat).

 My interpetation is based on a rave with the King of Thebes being Head of 
Security and Dionysus (the god of exctasy) being a DJ.

 The reason I'm telling so many is that my play development workshop 
class (at UCSC) is presenting a read through of my play. I can have 
guests be there and after the reading there is a feedback session from 
the observers. The process is designed to help me, as a writer, to 
rewrite the play if neccesarry (almost a guarentee).

 If anyone is interested in attending (it's free ;) it will be held at 4 
PM on March 5th at the UCSC Perorming Arts Complex in room B-100. It is 
an accademic setting and guests are expeced to respect the setting and 
facilities.

 Any questions?

hugz,

Ran D.Dreams
